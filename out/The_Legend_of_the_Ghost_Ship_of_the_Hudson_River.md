**CW: pregnancy loss, suicide**

\*\*\*\*\*

I don’t know if it was the wind that woke me that night, or the mysterious piping music that sounds when the walls between worlds wear thin.  I was nine years old.  I jerked awake, drenched in sweat, at three in the morning on an October school night.  Some silent siren’s song drew me out of bed and to my bedroom window.  Past my suburban backyard, I could see the serrated darkness of the Hudson River as it ambled, lazily, towards the Atlantic Ocean.  I’d spent many lazy days watching boats as they made their way up and down the river, a little perk of my Hudson Valley childhood.  My dad taught me all the different types - the container ships and barges and pusher tugs, the yachts and the passenger vessels.

But I’d never seen anything like the ship passing by that night, gliding leisurely south.  

The boat looked like one of the pirate ships I’d seen in fairy tale illustrations.  It had a broad wooden body, two masts like telephone poles, and billowing white sails.  On either side of its pointing bow spirit were wooden carvings of strangely-alluring monsters - women with wide-set eyes, flowing hair, and tentacles instead of legs.  One she-creature smiled, the other bared her teeth.  No flag flew from the ship’s masts.  

I watched, entranced.  Then, fear cut me like the lash of a whip.  

The ship wasn’t sailing on the water.  Rather, it floated above the river, as though sailing through the air.  

Terror took hold and I dove back into bed, buried myself under the covers, and faced the wall, my back to the window and the river.  I clinched my eyes shut until sleep came. 

The next afternoon, it was on the news.  

A timber barge and its pusher sank the night before.  Some mistake was made; a fire broke out, then an explosion a few miles north of Kingston.  The vessel carried eleven crew.  Two men were pulled out of the water, seriously injured but alive.  Eight bodies had been recovered.  At the time of the broadcast, one crew member had not been accounted for, dead or alive.

Days passed, then months, then years.  The final man was never found.

\*\*\*\*\*

The legend goes like this: The Ghost Ship of the Hudson flies no flag, and it bares no name.  If it once had a destination, that destination was forgotten long ago.  The Ghost Ship drifts - slowly, but purposefully - up and down the Hudson River, from the Adirondacks to the mouth of the Atlantic Ocean, eternally.  Its crew is comprised of individuals who once sailed the Hudson in another vessel, whose voyage was cursed, who died in the river’s watery embrace.  The ship is invisible.  It belongs to another plane of existence.  It can occasionally be seen from the shore by an individual of extraordinary sensitivity; when it is, the sighting should be considered a dark omen.

Sometimes, the Ghost Ship hungers for a new crew member.  It chooses its quarry from a vessel, any vessel - a yacht or schooner, fishing boat or tugboat - floating along the Hudson.  Some say the Ghost Ship chooses only the pure of heart.  Others, those who truly belong on the water, or the conflicted, or the ones most beset by mental turmoil.  By one method or another, the quarry is marked.  

This marked individual will see the Ghost Ship.  They will inform their fellow passengers or crew mates of the sight - an old wooden clipper, with two masts and white sails, that floats above the river like an apparition.  But they will not be taken seriously.

Then, an emergency.  Their vessel will catch fire, or strike an obstacle, or experience mechanical failure.  It will never reach the shore.  Most aboard are fated to drown in the black, polluted waters, and the few survivors never receive an adequate explanation for their trauma.  Water-logged bodies are recovered and accounted for.

All except for one. 

As the wreckage is cleared, invisible to the living, the Ghost Ship continues its endless voyage - with one more unlucky soul onboard.

\*\*\*\*\*

Nearly thirty years after I spied the Ghost Ship through the window of my childhood bedroom, I stared into the inky depths of the Hudson River - this time, up close, as little waves broke against the dock between Piers 82 and 83 in Manhattan.  I wondered what it would feel like to plunge into the icy water: first, paralyzing cold; then the comforting weight embracing my body like a blanket, carrying me home.  

Since that night, I’d both feared water and felt myself drawn to it.  I swam competitively as a teenager; I’d enjoyed submerging myself in the chlorinated pool, the water tamed and domesticated like an exotic pet.  I tried boogie boarding for a couple months, in college in Santa Barbara.  The waves of the Pacific enticed me - their lulling repetition, the way they knocked me about like a rubber duck, diving and bobbing.  But after a near-miss - I’d been caught in a riptide on Dockweiler Beach in Los Angeles - I shied away from the waves when they became too tall for comfort.  

Out of habit, I placed a hand to my stomach.  Not protectively, not anymore.  I threw my uniform shirt over my shoulder, turned away from the water, and strode towards Pier 83, where six small cruise ships bobbed and pulled against their tethers.  

I’d tried to get out of my shift that night - bartending a floating dance party on a boat for some Moroccan House DJ.  But Marissa, my supervisor, wouldn’t let me off the hook.  They’d booked three charters that evening; they were stretched thin as it was and, since Peter and Jenny quit, they couldn’t afford to lose another bartender.  If I called out, Marissa would have no choice but to put Laila - inexperienced Laila - at the second floor bar all by herself, thrown to the drunken wolves.  

So I sucked it up and went to work.  I’d never do Laila dirty.  And besides, I’d intended to be near the Hudson that night anyway.  

I patted my purse.  The pills rattled obediently in their little orange bottle.

\*\*\*\*\*

“Dude, try this.  Too sweet?”  Laila asked, shoving a cherry-red cocktail into my hand.

The river cruise ambled north along the Hudson, between Inwood and Jersey.  The initial bar rush had subsided.  Outside, on the second-floor sundeck, the DJ performed under a canopy while party-goers - mostly girls-and-gays in their 20’s and 30’s with a yuppie vibe - took designer drugs and sipped tequila sodas and swayed to the repetitive, otherworldly music in heels and sequins and see-through tops.  

While I zoned out watching the debauchery, Laila had been inventing a cocktail with Casamigos Reposado and a squirt bottle of raspberry syrup she’d found in the fridge.  I hesitated.  Then, I remembered I no longer had a reason to stay sober, and took a sip.  I liked it.  I could taste the tequila, but the raspberry and lime and cranberry juice masked the sickly-sweet aftertaste that usually kept me away from that particular spirit.

“It’s good,” I said to Laila.  

Laila, a 24-year-old hijabi nursing student, gave me a suspicious look.  “Too much lime, or not enough?”

“Try it yourself.”

Laila, a practicing Muslim, didn’t drink.  But she didn’t consider sampling her concoctions, technically, “drinking.”  I secretly doubted God would be thrilled with Laila enabling others to drink, whether or not she partook herself, but Laila’s relationship with the almighty wasn’t any of my business.  I still called myself a Methodist even as I routinely, intentionally indulged in sin.  For instance: I’d gotten pregnant out of wedlock.

Laila shook her head.  She smiled conspiratorially and beckoned for me to come closer.  “Ahmed and I haven’t told many people yet,” she whispered.  “But we’re expecting.”

Laila rested a dainty hand on her still-flat stomach.  I resisted the urge to do the same.  I kept a smile pasted on my face as Laila babbled on about ultrasounds and pregnancy subreddits and the two-bedroom apartment they hoped to move into.  But when she dashed away to use the bathroom, l let my Supportive Older Friend mask slide off like shedded skin.  

As I mixed margaritas for two giggling twenty-somethings, tiny crop tops and tight shorts hugging their perfect curves, I fought the urge to pitch my Boston shaker into the river.  Once upon a time, I’d been a careless young working girl who hit the nightlife with reckless abandon, my future a bright, shining thing, plump for the picking.  I’d moved from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles after graduating from film school.  I worked on-set jobs as a second AC with a moonlight gig at an equipment rental house, absolutely certain I was cake-walking my way towards my dream career: union cinematographer.  Friday nights, I’d prowl Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood with my girl group, dancing on tables and shrieking as we sauntered from dive bars to burlesque clubs to after-hours parties in repurposed warehouses. 

Now?  I was a broken toy.  Damaged goods.

After the half-dressed twenty-somethings pranced away with their margaritas, Laila pushed back behind the bar, frowning.

“Guys, I saw something really weird out on the water,” she said.  “A boat.  This old boat, like the Flying Dutchman from Pirates of the Caribbean.  It had white sails and creepy mermaids on the front.  And… I mean, I don’t know much about boats, but… it looked like it was floating in the air, not the water.”

Neither of our cashiers appeared impressed.  Devonte leaned on his register, lanky arms hanging over the counter.  Renata took a long swig of her watermelon Red Bull and tapped on her phone.  

“Probably a promotion for some shitty movie,” Renata said disinterestedly.  

“A company out of the Chelsea Piers does tourist cruises on old-school clippers,” Devonte explained.  “That’s probably what you saw.”

Laila shrugged.  “Maybe.”

I kept my mouth shut.  Memories flooded my consciousness like water through a burst dam - Girl Scout campfires, local fish tales, and the thing I saw that night through my bedroom window.  *No.  No.  It wasn’t real.  It couldn’t be real…* but the timber barge.  The explosion.  The one body never accounted for.

I snatched a stock list, swiped Renata’s lighter, and snuck out of the bar.

\*\*\*\*\*

*This is ridiculous.  This is ridiculous.*

I stood at the railing of the first floor stern deck, where the crew kept mops and buckets and lengths of rope, and watched the twin jets of water set spinning by the boat’s motors.  I scrunched the stock list in my hand like a torch.  *Ridiculous or not, I wouldn’t let them take Laila.*   

I thought about prom night - about Rob from AP Euro - and involuntarily cringed.

Rob wasn’t my dream prom date.  In fact, I’d been completely ambivalent about prom altogether.  But my friends wanted to go, and Rob asked nicely, and I didn’t want to be a wet blanket, so to prom I went -  a night of half-hearted dancing, lukewarm finger food, and itching in my borrowed dress.  Afterwards, my group retreated to my friend Laura’s family cabin, which backed onto the Hudson River, to drink cheap vodka out of plastic cups.  

“You guys ever hear of the Ghost Ship of the Hudson?”  Rob slurred.  

We all nodded.  Everyone who’d ever grown up in the Hudson Valley knew the story of the Ghost Ship.  

“Well, d’ya know,” Rob continued, “if you offer your blood to the river, one of the Ghost Ship’s phantom crew members will appear to you?”

Shuddering at the memory, I pulled my sharp little bar knife out of its sheath and ran the blade over the palm of my hand.  The pain was oddly comforting - a biting kiss.  I gingerly clutched my paper torch in my injured left hand, blood dripping down my wrist and, with Renata’s pilfered lighter in my right, set it aflame.  I extended the flaming sheet of paper over the edge of the railing, belching grey smoke, and allowed droplets of my blood to drip down into the deep purple water below.

A sudden gust of wind cut through my thin jacket.  It quelled the flame, then tore the entire makeshift torch from my hand.  The burned sheet of paper danced in the air behind the boat before disappearing into darkness.

*Fuck.  It didn’t work*.  Of course not.  I wasn’t even surprised - Rob from AP Euro’s dumb ritual hadn’t summoned a river ghost on prom night, either.  

I turned, and recoiled with a gasp.  I wasn’t alone.

A guy stood at the other end of the deck, his back to me.  He had longish auburn hair and a slender, sinewy figure.  He dressed differently than the other partiers, more Williamsburg hipster than Manhattan raver, in a stained white tunic and oversized denim overalls.  A roadie for the DJ, maybe?

The man turned and locked eyes with me.  I caught my breath.  He wasn’t a he at all, but a young woman.  She had a heart-shaped face, deep-set chocolate eyes, and an upturned nose.  The baggy man’s shirt she wore couldn’t hide her large breasts.  Or the slight convex bulge of her belly. 

I clinched my teeth.  It was like that time I’d gone on an acai bowl kick: all of a sudden, everywhere I looked, there was yet another shop selling acai bowls.  Now, it was pregnant women.  Pregnant women at Starbucks and on the subway and waiting in line behind me at the market.  First Laila, now this chick.  I took a breath and forced myself to smile reassuringly.

“Hey,” I said, “are you okay?”

The girl studied me wordlessly.  I laid my hand on her arm, and immediately pulled back.  She was freezing cold.  

“You should go inside,” I said, in what I hoped was a comforting tone of voice.  “You’re like ice.”  I looked critically at the sky - clear earlier, now crisscrossed by menacing clouds.  “And it looks like it’s going to rain.”

The girl didn’t respond.  But she didn’t fight as I took her by the wrist and led her to the first floor concession stand.

The concession stand was quiet.  Only a few partiers hung around the lower deck, staring at their phones or relaxing in folding chairs.  Raul, the first-floor bartender, sat on an overturned milk crate behind his register.

“Hey Raul,” I said, “can you get me a hot chamomile tea?  It’s for the pregnant lady.”

Raul frowned suspiciously.

“Please, man?”  I pressed.  “Just a tea.  I’ll put it down as my employee meal.”

“Sure I’ll get you a tea,” Raul said nonchalantly.  “You don’t have to say it’s your employee meal.  But what pregnant lady are you talking about?”

“The girl…” I turned.  My heart gulped.

The pregnant woman in overalls had vanished.  

\*\*\*\*\*I

*Laila could survive.  She was a high school swimmer, made it to the state championships.  She could make it to shore.  If she weren’t the quarry…*

 considered, as I jogged up and down the back stairs, whether I should warn the crew we were all staring down imminent danger.  Layers of dark clouds obscured the sky, and the boat’s usually gentle course up and down the river had become uncharacteristically choppy.  Laila saw the Ghost Ship.  Disaster was predetermined.  

But what would I tell them?  ‘Hey guys, so the other bartender thinks she saw a clipper ship floating on top of the waves, and it sounds a whole lot like this camp story that gets kicked around my hometown, so I think we should head back to the pier before the boat sinks and/or blows up.’  Even in my head, it sounded ridiculous.  

I found her leaning on the railing of the outdoor bow deck on the first floor, staring pensively into the dark river.  The pregnant ghost girl.  I went and stood beside her.

“You’re a crew member,” I asked, “of the ghost ship?”

The girl gave me an unreadable look.  

“Well,” I said, trying to sound confident, “you have to talk to me.  I’m the one who called you.”  I extended my injured hand.  “I gave my blood to the Hudson.  So as long as blood flows from my wound, you’ve got to answer my questions.  Honestly.”

The ghost girl studied me as though I were the least interesting specimen she’d ever laid eyes upon.  Then she spoke.

“I suppose,” she said.  Her voice was low and gravelly, with a hint of an Irish accent.

“The Ghost Ship wants Laila, right?”  I asked, getting right to the point.

The ghost girl nodded.

“Why?  Why did the ship choose her?”

“I chose her,” the ghost girl said.  “Because she fascinates me, and it’s my turn to choose.”

“She’s pregnant,” I countered.  “She doesn’t look it yet, but…”

“I know,” the ghost girl replied, without a hint of sympathy.

I took a deep breath.  “I want you to take me instead.”

The ghost girl looked me up and down, her brown eyes appraising my slightly out-of-shape form.  

“No,” the ghost girl said.  She turned away.

I pushed down the familiar feeling of rejection.  “Well, why?  Why don’t you want me?”

“Because you’re faded,” the ghost girl said, neither pity nor scorn in her voice.  “The one I desire thrums with vitality.”

*Faded.*  Tears stung my eyes.  I’d felt that way for months, as though the color and texture were draining from my very being, leaving an empty space behind.  

Once, I’d thrummed with vitality.  I remembered my going-away party, two weeks before my thirtieth birthday, at the Argyle in Hollywood - how I’d swigged vodka out of the bottle and kissed strangers and danced the night away.  I was celebrating my new job with Harvest Moon Digital in New York City, an agency that produced commercials and promotional materials, and my impending move back home to the east coast, to the City that Never Sleeps.  

The thought of shooting corporate videos hadn’t exactly thrilled me.  But I’d be behind the camera every day - a videographer, not an AC or a camera PA - and the lady who’d interviewed me promised the occasional music video.  So I threw myself into the job.  I threw myself into New York City, exploring the avenues late at night.  Then came the buyout.  And then, the pink slip.  The new corporate overlords laid off 80% of the Harvest Moon staff.  They claimed they needed new blood, that our content had gone stale.  

*Stale.*  Years passed, my youth slipped away without me even noticing, and I’d become stale.  After six months of sending my resume to anyone who’d accept it, netting me three first interviews and zero job offers, my self-esteem was effectively shattered.  No one wanted to hire a thirty-seven-year-old videographer.  I gave up and started my own small business shooting event videos.  Weddings paid well and bartending provided extra money on the side; my income remained stable, but it felt like a step down.  Like I’d hit my peak and begun to slide.

I sighed.  The ghost girl clearly had no empathy for Laila or her baby, and she wasn’t remotely impressed by my self-sacrifice.  I looked at my left hand.  The blood still flowed, but not as freely.  *Think.  Think.*

“What’s your name?”  I asked the ghost girl.

“Ada,” she replied. 

“That’s a pretty name.  When… if you don’t mind me asking… did you, die I guess?”

“March fifteenth, nineteen-eighteen.”

“Oh!”  I didn’t comment on the fact that this chick had been haunting the river for over a hundred years.  “Where… where were you going?  And was your baby’s dad, I mean your husband, with you?”

Ada stood silently for a moment, staring intently into the distance.  I saw a sudden flash of lightning in the sky.  A raindrop brushed my cheek, then another.  

“I was traveling to Brooklyn,” Ada said finally.  “I had no husband.  I met Edgar at the country manor where we were both employed: me, in the kitchen; him, tending to the horses.  He told me he loved me, promised we’d marry soon.  It was only after my monthly bleeding didn’t come that he informed me he was already married.  He wanted to… get rid of it.  The baby.  He said his aunt knew how.”  

“I’m so sorry,” I said.  

*Christ*, I thought, *this Edgar ass is even worse than Andrew*.  

Andrew.  Fucking Andrew.  

Andrew never made my heart dance or my loins cry out to the heavens; I couldn’t feel for him what my friends who liked dating said they felt for their Tinder conquests and situationships.  Dating made me miserable.  But I wanted kids, and I wanted my kids to have a father.  So I’d created an OKCupid profile and matched with Andrew, 43, who worked in consulting.

On our first date, Andrew and I walked from Williamsburg to Crown Heights, talking and laughing the entire time.  Il thought I’d found the cheat code to coupled bliss.  We got serious fast; we stopped using protection.  The red flags - his condescending comments, his quick temper, his baseless accusations - were no match for my screaming biological clock.  

“My cousin found me a job in Brooklyn,” Ada continued.  “So I dressed as a boy, and my brother arranged for my passage on the coal ship Cressida.  And…”

She didn’t finish her sentence.  She didn’t need to.  She’d been chosen - someone had done to her what she was about to do to Laila.

“I’m pregnant, too,” I said.  The words twisted my heart.

Ada sneered.  “There’s no child in your womb.  Only an empty hole.”

*Fuck you.*

*An empty hole.*  A cheap imitation.  A cruel prank, played on me by my own body.   

The two lines on the pregnancy test had been the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen.  I danced to CVS for pre-natal vitamins, filled my refrigerator with fruit and vegetables and lean meats, began Googling cribs and strollers and imagining a wardrobe filled with tiny clothes.  All of my insecurities - about my job, my body, my professional peak and drop - melted away as I embraced the identity of *mother*.  I began noticing parks and museums and daycares; fantasized about walking down 5th Avenue hand-in-hand with my chubby toddler.  

I wondered what my child would look like - would they have my tan skin and wavy black hair, or perhaps Andrew’s strong jaw and icy-blue eyes?  Maybe they’d be a theater kid, like I’d been; or a Star Wars nerd, like Andrew was.  They’d play soccer, or join the band, or be obsessed with amphibians; have a part-time job at the Times Square Olive Garden, or win creative writing competitions, or go to college and study rocket science.  The seed-sized being snug in my womb was a tiny ball of endless possibilities.  

Then, my first ultrasound.  The doctor’s kind voice: t*here’s no evidence of fetal growth.  I’m sorry.*  

My doctor called it a blighted ovum.  An anembryonic pregnancy.  Andrew’s sperm had impregnated my egg, and the egg had implanted itself in my uterus.  The gestational sac - the container in which my baby would grow - developed.  But no baby had formed.  Instead of a ball of endless possibilities, I carried inside me an empty hole.  

My life, once glittering with hope and anticipation, became colorless and cold.  Andrew called my poor gynecologist to demand my medical records, insisting I “prove” I hadn’t had an abortion behind his back “because that’s what women do;” I blocked his number and cut him out of my life.  I’d been given a choice: take the pills, or wait for nature to take its course.  The world lost its wonder.  And I became furious at the world - the world that insisted on parading cheerful pregnant women in front of me.  Like Laila.  Laila, with her youthful glow and her adorable nerd husband and her shimmering future.

The boat hit a large wave, throwing me against the rail.  The rain began to fall freely.  I stared at Ada, who watched the water.  And I *knew*.  

“You don’t want Laila because she fascinates you,” I said.  “You want her because you’re jealous.  She gets to have a baby, and you’re stuck like this forever.”

Ada whirled.  The wrath on her pretty face convinced me I’d hit the nail on the head.  

“Well,” I ventured, “I think you’re going about this the wrong way.  Maybe somehow… do you ever see a white light?  Or maybe you have some unfinished business, or…”

“Of course I see the white light,” Ada snapped.  “I’ve seen it every day.  Every day for a hundred years.”

“Then…I don’t get it.  Go into the light.  Set yourself free!”

“You think I’ve never thought of that?”  Ada’s dark eyes burned.  “I wasn’t chosen.  Someone else was.  Our boat capsized, and I was bleeding, and the water was so cold, and I felt myself sinking under, and I saw the light.  I felt myself pulled into it.  So I did what you’re attempting to do.  I begged.  I begged the Ghost Ship to take me instead.  Because if I’d gone into that white light, my baby *couldn’t go with me*.”

“Your baby,” I murmured.

Ada nodded.  “I felt my baby disappearing from my womb.  And I knew, if I followed the light into the world beyond this one, I’d go there alone.”

The boat shook again.  Fat drops of water flew into my face, blurring my vision.  I understood. 

I had the pills.  Misoprostol and mifepristone.  They sat on my kitchen counter, instructing me to take them, to clean out my womb, to free myself of the empty hole in my belly.  But I couldn’t.  My baby didn’t exist.  But I couldn’t let go of the possibilities, of the fantasies about birthdays and Christmases and graduations, of the swirling ball of potential within me.  So I’d bought another bottle of pills.  Sedatives.

They were in my purse now.  Waiting for me to return to the dock.  That night, I’d walk to a quiet spot along the Hudson.  I’d swallow the sleeping pills until they made me sick.  I’d climb over the railing, and I’d fall into the river, allowing its cold weight to pull me under.  I’d give myself over to the ambling water I’d watched from my childhood bedroom.  And I, with my nonexistent child, would dissolve into a billion little pieces.

“Your child belongs in the Hudson,” I muttered.

Ada’s face scrunched.  “What?”

I hadn’t realized I’d spoken aloud.  But my words obviously touched something.

“Do you know,” I said carefully, “that the Hudson River empties into the Atlantic Ocean?  And that actually, all oceans are connected?”

“Yeah, I know that,” Ada snapped.  “Just ‘cause I’m low-class doesn’t mean I’m an idiot.  What’s that got to do with anything?”

“Well…um…” I stuttered, “okay, how about this?  You had dreams for your baby, right?  You thought about what they would be like, in the future.”

Beyond the Jersey shore, I saw another burst of lightning, this one closer and larger.  I felt my stomach drop as the boat took a dive; grasped the railing to keep my balance.  A violent storm was brewing.  A dangerous one - mighty enough to capsize our boat.  When I straightened, Ada was staring up at the hazy sky.

“I was gonna call her Juliet,” Ada said.  “Oliver if it was a boy, but I wanted a girl.  I’d have worked hard so she could take dance lessons.  Or piano.  I always wanted to play an instrument when I was young, but my parents couldn’t afford it.”  

I nodded.  I smiled.  I’d stared, enchanted, at tiny ballet slippers as well.  A loud clap of thunder sounded.  Fearful cries from the upper decks.  

“And I was gonna save my money,” Ada continued, “to send her to school.  Teacher’s college, maybe.  She was gonna have her own career, her own prospects.  So she’d never have to depend on some lout of a man for security.”

Another rumble of thunder.  The boat jerked violently.  Overhead, the music abruptly cut off.  The rainfall became faster, thicker.  I shielded my eyes with one arm against the downpour.  I took a breath.  Absentmindedly, I put my hand to my stomach, to the empty hole contained within.  The cheap imitation.  My little ball of endless possibilities, trapped forever in stasis.

“Your baby is trapped,” I said.  

Ada’s eyes narrowed.  Her smooth skin, impervious to the rain, seemed to blanch.  But she didn’t argue.  She didn’t push back.  The gash on my hand still leaked slender streams of fresh blood, but it was clotting fast.  My time was running out.

“You’re not trapped alone on this boat,” I continued.  “Your baby is stuck here with you.  And… and I don’t think that’s her destiny.  I think she’s meant to flow with the river to the ocean.  Because I think the ocean’s the only thing big enough to hold her.  One water molecule for every life she could’ve lived, every person she could’ve been.”

The boat tipped perilously.  I was tossed back onto the cold, hard deck.  I landed in a puddle, catching myself on my injured hand, sending a wave of pain through my core.  There were many frantic voices above me now - male and female, partier and crew.  I imagined how our night would end: the horrible accident, bodies floating in the Hudson.  One body never recovered - that of pregnant, promising Laila, who would belong to the Ghost Ship for eternity.  

When I regained my footing, Ada was as she had been - bent over the railing, like a contented lover on a sunny day.  But her pensive, pained expression had changed.  I could see tears in her pretty eyes.

“Your baby - Juliet - is supposed to be playing with penguins in Antarctica, now,” I told Ada, allowing my imagination to run wild.  “Hanging out with surfers in Brazil, or cute otters in Alaska.  And then… then, water becomes vapor.  And vapor travels on air, and people and animals breathe it in.  So Juliet would be a part of everything.  She would experience everything.  All the lives.  All the possibilities.  Forever.”

The boat bucked again.  A fresh shudder of pain cut through my body.  This time, it came from inside me.  My stomach.  The pain kept going: reverberating tremors that felt like my uterus was being torn in half, ebbing and flowing like waves, each crest more powerful than the last.  

I collapsed to my knees.  I felt a warm wetness trickle down my thighs.

\*\*\*\*\*

I miscarried in the crew bathroom on the first deck.  I vomited yellow bile into the stained metal toilet, crouched on my hands and knees, lay curled on the dirty floor as the cutting pain rippled through me.  I sat on the toilet and felt the blood drain from my body, thick clots collecting at the bottom of the bowl, until I couldn’t keep my body upright and collapsed back to the ground, crying and trembling and sweating, the concrete floor never cold enough.  

I didn’t notice the sea calming, the boat’s sharp movement smoothing, the cease of the rain against the windows, or the restored music upstairs. 

What felt like hours later, there was a knock on the door.  I summoned the energy to pull myself to my feet and turn the knob.  It was Laila and a couple of our female co-workers.  They said they hadn’t seen me since before that freak storm, and they’d gotten worried.  They brought me a change of clothes, towels to wipe the blood off the floor, Tylenol, a bandage for my cut hand, and an olive jar where I could keep the tiny, fragile gestational sac agonizingly expelled from my body.

Soon after, the boat docked at Pier 83.  Damp revelers stumbled away in various states of drunkenness.  My pain had subsided enough that I was able to walk off the boat myself, but Laila insisted on driving me back to my apartment in Crown Heights.  While I waited at the dock for her to pull around, I stared, yet again, into the endless depths of the Hudson River.

I dug through my purse and extracted the bottle of sedatives, found a trashcan, and dumped them all.  Then, I returned to the water’s edge.  I clutched the olive jar in my hands - the makeshift urn for my gestational sac.  My little black hole.  

I marveled that a thing so small and fragile could be a vehicle for all the possibility that lived in my head - or for such anguish.  I undid the lid, pulled out the jelly-like sac, and flung it into the gurgling darkness.  My child - all the children that could’ve been - belonged with the eternally churning river.  

*I love you*, I whispered.  *I’m sorry I couldn’t be your mom*.

\*\*\*\*\*

Beyond me, the Ghost Ship of the Hudson sailed silently onward.  I couldn’t see it, but I felt its otherworldly presence against my soul.  No flag, no destination, no name.

Except that night, it sailed with one less unlucky soul onboard.
