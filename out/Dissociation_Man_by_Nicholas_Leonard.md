My name is Matthew Did, and I lost the ability to be worried about anything. Anything. Absolutely anything, especially myself. I’m not depressed. I actually quite enjoy life and I’m capable of finding enjoyment in being awake and conscious, but something happened the other day that made me realize I am without a fundamental human ingredient. I don’t know why I lost this or where it went, but I just don’t have it. I was the victim of a sextortion scam. 

**Something to know about Matthew Did!** the title of the groupchat on instagram was. The user, who I thought was some Australian woman, had made a group chat on Instagram with about fifty or so of my followers. Old high school classmates. A neighbor. I stopped checking to see the people in the group chat, blocked the culprit and left the group chat. Everything was there alright, damning evidence and all, a whole gallery of photos and videos that I did actually send to this supposed woman- and yet I drank my coffee nonchalantly while watching the sun rise outside my apartment window. 

Yeah, I got a little startled when I saw it, but this was the morning that I realized my reflexes were very ill. I didn’t tremble. I didn’t get sick to my stomach. I just drank my coffee and watched the sun nurse the beaten down infrastructure of Lynn, Massachusetts. The houses might’ve been pretty once. Not many people sat on their porches anymore. I didn’t have a porch. I had a balcony that had a chicken-wire kind of flooring that I never went out on. No. I could see Lynn perfectly outside my window. 

I went into work that morning as if nothing had happened. I worked in the deli at Stop & Shop on Washington Street at the time. I wore something similar to a scientist’s white lab coat, even though I rarely got any stains on it. My hair was short but I still wore one of those plastic hairnets. 

I sliced thin flabs of turkey and roast beef for sweet old ladies who watched me as if I was doing the greatest thing in the world. Of course there was a good proportion of customers who eyed me down as if I was the scum of the Earth, but that never bothered me. *Something to know about Matthew Did,* I thought as thin folds fell one by one into my hand; meat on plastic. While those words whispered through my head beneath the sound of the radio-friendly playlist the store had on repeat, I wondered what the old ladies would have thought if they were in that group chat. I imagined if they would gasp.

My lack of worry perplexed me all throughout my shift. I checked my phone when I went on break, and no relatives or friends had sent me alarming text messages, so I figured that my lack of a reaction was some sort of premonition that meant that everything was going to be alright. But then my supervisor came into the breakroom while I was putting my phone away. 

Jerry Segnalazione was a chubby and middle aged man with a heart of gold. Some of my fondest memories of working at Stop & Shop were of him and I sitting in the breakroom. He would give me Kitkats sometimes while telling me about his and his son’s baseball card collection. I had no interest in sports but I gave him my attention. He would share funny stories of other grocery stores he worked at, but I had an inclination that I wasn’t going to be hearing any funny stories about vagrants smearing their shit on the restroom walls that morning.

“Jerry.” I greeted.

“Matthew.” He sounded incredibly cautious. He languidly approached the table I was sitting at and studied my face as if I was an alien in a skinsuit. 

He pulled up a chair but didn’t sit down. He gulped and continued to speak. “I um got an interesting message this morning.”

“You did?”

“Yeah.” He said, guiding his big body onto the seat as languidly as a boat coming into shore on rough seas. “I don’t wanna be the one to tell you this-”

“I know what it is, Jerry.” 

He looked shocked. All he could do was blink.

“Well,” he fidgeted in his seat, “what the hell happened, Matthew?” He whispered. “Who- who else saw that? I’m sorry, dude.”

I didn’t say anything back. I just looked at the table and saw how smooth it was. There was nothing to say so I shrugged.

“Do you know who else was in that group chat?” Jerry went. “I checked. Everybody here. The whole damn staff. The carriage boy had the biggest smirk on his face when he punched in this morning.”

I didn’t care. 

“What the hell, Matthew? You know HR is gonna be pulling you in later today, don’t you?”

I raised my eyebrows, forging a reaction. 

Then disappointment came over Jerry’s face the way you close somebody’s eyes directly after they died. He struggled out of the chair. “I mean, I didn’t wanna see that.” He said without looking into my eyes.

I gulped. “I’m sorry, man.”

“That’s not my problem. Tell that to HR.” He said underneath his breath, and walked away. 

I sat there for the rest of my break wondering why I didn’t feel guilty, scared or disgusted. A virus had spread, wafting out of the shards of a spilt vial, and I was immune, standing unbothered in the fumes. 



That afternoon, after I got fired, I went and picked up a pack of cigarettes on my way home from work. I tried cigars before, hit my friend’s vape before, but never really took up smoking. I walked around Lynn, sucking on a cigarette like it was a lollipop. Feel something. Feel some grief. All I felt was an empty comfort; a ghostly c’est la vie. 

I passed by gas stations, old brick buildings infested with vines, past hispanic kids playing hopscotch, past some white-trash looking dude playing a guitar, and all I did was suck and suck down the smoke. I felt jittery and at ease, but that was it. I walked around smoking like that for an hour until I got thirsty, so I went back to my apartment and got myself a drink of water. 

Still no worried texts from family, just the cold shoulder from my now former co-workers. 



I lost my job obviously, and I did apply to others but the search for work fizzled out. I found it more important to walk the streets of Lynn in search of where my bad emotions went. Where my disgust was hiding. Where my self-pity had gone flying off to. Which alleyway my sense of embarrassment was lingering in. I walked past the plastic bags and litter on the street. I wandered down the gaps between buildings and houses like they were mazes too easy to solve. Of course I was smoking the whole time. I became more a part of the city than I had been when I was working at Stop & Shop. 

I didn’t care that I had lost these once uneasing emotions, but a part of me now realized they were important to have, so I kept looking. I walked around as if they were something tangible to find; a runaway cat that you didn’t like but felt a responsibility for having. I became jittery. I was hungry because I was eating less. I was still eating, yeah, but I wasn’t eating as healthily as before. I was just spending more of my savings on cigarettes than I was on food. 

Another thing, my money was dwindling because I didn’t have a job anymore. I didn’t have a new job because finding my sense of… sense of what exactly? Well, finding whatever that was more important than having a job. A source of feeling, even if it was a negative feeling, seemed much more important than a source of income. I mulled the sextortion situation over in my mind throughout my Lynn excursions, and I still felt no embarrassment or disgust about it. It was whatever. I didn’t care. 

I stopped showering. I stopped brushing my teeth. I stopped changing the sheets on my bed. I cut my own hair because I couldn’t afford a barber, and I just didn’t like it getting in front of my eyes. 

*Something to know about Matthew Did,* I thought while meandering through Lynn. 

I would occasionally check the Stop & Shop parking lot to see if I had left my sense of… sense of what… 

Anyways, I made it a habit of crossing through the Stop & Shop parking lot. Sometimes Jerry would see me and waddle over to me and give me a Kitkat. I think he felt sorry for me. 

While stomping behind the grocery store, lurking through the pines around it, I wondered what had exactly caused my eradication of negative emotions. Did seeing the creation of that group chat cause something nuclear and instant to go off in my brain? A shock so great that it made every other disheartening that it made every other disheartening thing of life seem unimportant. I don’t know. 

I think the carriage boy, the boy collecting shopping carts and bringing them back into the store, became scared of me. He would see me, try not to look at me and hurry back into the store. One time one of the other supervisors came out and asked me not to walk around the parking lot unless I was there to buy something. With a mouthful of yellow teeth, I apologized. 

So, I started sneaking around at night, looking, searching. One time I even snuck into the store and looked in the bathrooms. No. My old emotions weren’t in there. They found me shoveling through boxes of pasta down one aisle and threw me out of the store. 

Children who were playing outside or walking home from school became scared of me. I could see it in their eyes. *Something to know about Matthew Did.* I didn’t care. I wasn’t embarrassed. I wasn’t ashamed. I walked among them. 

Well, I lost the apartment. I wasn’t able to pay rent anymore. I started bumming and begging for cigarettes, but my breath and odor was a real repellent to people so I rarely ever got a butt from anybody. I still got Kitkats from Jerry. I asked about how his and his son’s baseball card collection was going but he said he had to get back into the store. 

I was becoming a goblin, and I didn’t care. 

One night in an alleyway I caught a rat and ate it. It was still squirming in my hands even after I had dislodged a chunk of its guts from out of its side. 

The rats do. I’m not hungry. I don’t care. *Something to know about Matthew Did.* Matthew did care. Matthew did not care.

I’m still in Lynn, bumming around. If you come down to the Stop & Shop on Washington Street in Lynn, Massachusetts, you might see me looking around. Please, don’t be startled by my appearance. It’s really nothing. Appearances aren’t everything after all. Maybe you could help me look. 

Anyways, I’m usually walking through the Stop & Shop parking around 10 before they close. Come. Come see me.
