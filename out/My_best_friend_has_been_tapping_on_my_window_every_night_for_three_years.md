This is a cry for help, I’ve kept it bottled up for way too long. I can’t outright tell my friends or family without being committed or possibly imprisoned, especially after the investigation into Michael’s disappearance got a lot of eyes on me specifically. I’m sure the more astute of you could figure out who I am but given the situation and the state of my mental health that’s a risk that I’ll gladly accept because I need to say my peace. 

I’ll start from the beginning, Michael and I were inseparable since we met in 5th grade, we bonded over a shared love of video games and fishing, we grew up together and stayed friends even after highschool and choosing separate career paths. That’s all fine and dandy and I imagine that’s something a lot of people could relate to, nothing out of the ordinary ever truly happened, at least, not that I can recall. However, everything took a shift after Michael returned to our hometown. 

he had been working on a dredge in South Carolina for a couple years, we stayed in touch for the entire duration playing games online and calls every now and then but this was out of the blue. Michael showed up on my doorstep at five in the morning with nothing, no bags, no phone, no anything except the clothes on his back. Something was off, all I could do was stare at him, I opened my mouth but before I could say anything he tilted his head to the side and made the expression of someone trying to convey confusion.

“Are you alright Brian? Do you not recognize me or did you miss me so much you’re just in shock? what’s going on here why are you gawking at me like that, man?”

“I- I just wasn’t expecting company this early that’s all”

I stammered.

“Something about that expression says it’s something more serious than that, are you sick man? Is this a bad time? Rhetorical question it is a bad time to be knocking on doors but I’m in a bit of a situation and I don’t have anywhere to stay at the moment, would you mind if I crashed on your couch for a bit? I’ll try to explain a few things in the morning, or rather, the afternoon… whenever I wake up”

I blinked at him a few times.

“Sure man, I’ll get you a blanket and a pillow”

I go to my living room closet where I keep spare blankets, pillows, and sheets. I turn around and Michael is sitting on the couch with his back turned to me, looking out the window at the rising sun and the morning birds chirping and fluttering around the bird feeder on the porch.
I hand the blanket and pillow to Micheal 

“Mmmm”

I nod to his response as he lays down and covers himself.

I head back up to my room, I’ve never known him to be involved in anything that would require a two hundred mile trip with no personal belongings, and I’ve never known him to show up unannounced.

An hour later I went down to make a cup of black tea, I couldn’t sleep once I was already woken up. Michael laid in asleep on my couch. he was taking deep breaths. I thought I seen him stir and quietly rushed past into the kitchen where I began setting up my keurig. I heard a cough from the living room.
Michael sat up, stretched, and seemed to notice the keurig making its noises. He got up and slowly walked to the kitchen rubbing the sleep out of his eyes and combing back his semi matted curly blond hair with his fingers.

“Mmm… that tea smells nice”

“I wouldn’t know”

I say as I glance up at him.

“You’re right, you wouldn’t”

Michael was never really a morning person and he didn’t get much sleep on the couch to begin with. He sat down bleary eyed in the dining room chair across from me. I began to search for anything wrong with him, I clearly didn’t hide my study of his face well enough because he looked at me quizzically.

“Why are you looking at me like that man? Do I got shit on my face? It was a rough trip up here I wouldn’t be surprised if there was”

I relaxed, he didn’t look like he was on anything and he didn’t look like a man on the run, what caused him to bolt here with no belongings and without warning?

“It’s nothing man, just checking if you’re alright”

I looked down into my cup.

“Fair enough, you’re probably a bit confused on why I’m here”

“Yeah, a little bit, that’s pretty out of character for you brother”

He nodded and rubbed the stubble on his face.

“Well, I’ve been going through something, I’m in way over my head and I just needed to get out for a while”

I stared at him.

“You’re not doing drugs or running with the mob are you?”

“What the fuck? No, no I’m not on drugs or running with the mob. Look man, I can’t explain it in its entirety I just needed an out for a little while and I needed it bad and fast. You’re the only person I felt comfortable enough to go to”

I leaned back exasperated.

“Brother this is inconvenient”

He put his head down slightly

“I get it man I get it, it’s really short notice. I know you don’t like surprises or unexpected intrusions, I’m sure me popping into the door this morning almost gave you a conniption fit and I definitely should’ve called ahead. Let me make it up to you, let’s go out to the black pond we used to play and fish at as kids”

The black pond was what we called the pond seven miles into the woods behind Michael’s family farm, I had a love hate relationship with that place. During the day it was fine but as soon as the sun would set it became a different world, a horrifying one painted with deep blacks and grays. The water content in the clay and mud was so high that most of the trees around it appeared to be dead and barren. I loved fishing at it in the daytime, but hated getting stuck there at night. I could’ve sworn that I would hear whispers and see things behind trees there at night, of course it could’ve very well been my imagination as I was just a kid and easily spooked.

“Well, do you want to go?”

I glanced up at Michael before looking back down at my hands.

“No, not really, also where did that come from? We haven’t been over there in at least a decade now, you forget something there, you feeling nostalgic? Are you sick?”

He paused and looked from side to side.

“Sick? What the fuck do you mean sick?”

“Sick like dying, did you find out you have cancer or something?”

Michael sat back and interlocked his fingers in his lap.

“In a way yes, in all actuality no”

I stared at him dumbfounded.

“Mikey, what the fuck does that mean”

“It means quit asking questions and let’s take a ride out to the farm”

I sighed.

“Which car are we taking”

“Let’s take mine, it’s bad enough I forced my way into your house, I can drive”

Twenty minutes later we got to the farm gate and I, being the passenger, had to get out to both open and close it.

“You call ahead and let your mom know we were coming?”

“Nah”

“You seem to be doing that a lot lately”

I said while looking back at the gate through the window. he just scratched his neck and glanced at the rearview mirror.

“What’s going on Michael, what happened? This is extremely out of character for you, I’ve never known you to be the nostalgic type”

He looked uneasy, darting his eyes to any and all unoccupied spaces.

“I talked to somebody, they did me a favor. I had to go through hell to get it. The prize for my labor is out here”

I stare at him.

“Mikey do you know how vague and cryptic that shit sounds? That’s almost no better than the explanation you gave me at the dinner table this morning, what person and what kind of favor?”

Michael smiled in an extremely unsettling way.

“You’ll see Brian, it’s going to be amazing, literal decades in the making. This person is legit, I know they made good on their promise, it’s the type of person they are”

His mood shifted.

“They better have”

On that last statement we both fell into a deep silence until we reached the turnoff on the old dirt road that lead to the black pond. 

“We’re here”

We both climb out of his pickup and walk towards the bed where our fishing gear is laid. We both silently grab our tackle and poles and start for the pond, it’s around a hundred yards into the woods from the dirt road. We set up on the bank and prepare our lines before we both cast out.

“I can’t believe it man, I’m so exited. Now that we’re here I can’t stop smiling”

I glance at him from the side and notice him absolutely beaming.

“Uhh, well, where’s the prize or favor or whatever that you were talking about?”

Michael, still beaming, says.

“Oh, I won’t get my prize until midnight”

I look at my phone, it’s only seven forty five
 
“Damn Michael, couldn’t this have waited? I’ve got to go in to work at four”

Michael’s smile faltered as he turned to look at me.

“This is extremely important Brian, I need you here, I need you right now more than anybody else. This is life and death we’re talking about here. You cannot abandon me, not on this day”

“Damn, fine, let me go back to the truck and call in sick or something. You know, you’re acting really fuckin’ weird right now, I’ll humor you because you’re like my brother but you need to chill out a bit. Ever since we turned in towards the farm you’ve been acting like a completely different person and I’m not vibing with it”

Michael’s face showed guilt.

“You’re right man, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t be acting like this, not after showing up unexpected and strong arming you into coming out here”

I softened a little.

“Apology accepted”

I turn to head back to the truck and make my phone call.
Hours pass as we sit and reminisce, telling stories of new encounters and experiences we hadn’t shared yet and in the midst of our conversation I brought up Hannah, Michael’s sister who passed over ten years ago before I realized my mistake.

“Do you remember when we would try to get Hannah to do a full spin on the swingset?”

I immediately froze, realizing I overstepped a boundary. After Hannah passed she was a sore topic for Michael, he loved her, almost not even like a sister, more akin to his child to which she was in a way, their parents were absent. The only adult around regularly was their papaw, he took care of the farm, the house, and what few animals were there. Their mom was a drunk and their father was a womanizer who ended up getting shot after fooling around with the wife of a banker. Sadly, papaw passed away not too long after Hannah did, from a broken heart they say. Their mom, even more sadly, inherited the farm and let it run into the ground leaving Michael with nothing.

“I do remember that, it was fun. To this day none of us had ever made it all the way around the bars on a swingset”

I was slightly shocked to find that mentioning Hannah didn’t put him in a mood, especially with the way he’s been acting. We both sat in silence for a while.

“You… you didn’t have much of a reaction to Hannah’s name”

“Hmmm? Oh…. Yeah, no. She’s coming back”

I freeze, stunned, the sun is starting to drop behind the trees with finger like shadows beginning to cover Michael’s face leaving only glint in his eyes as he looks in my direction.
“Brother, what do you mean by that? Who’s coming back?”

He slowly breaks into a smile and while slightly giggling he says.

“She’s coming back Brian, she’s almost here, I told you I asked for a favor. My prize is almost here”

I stare at him, growing extremely uneasy
“Okay, buddy, this is starting to get a bit weird but I’ll sit through it with you and I’ll be here for you”

“Oh… Brian….. I know….I need you for the exchange, I can’t get her back without you”
I stand frozen until the words register and upon realization, I turn, I turn and I bolt towards the truck. 

I can hear heavy footsteps advancing towards me, I make it to the driver side door before finding the door locked. Michael caught up with me and smashed my head into the top of the door frame, I turned around and put up my elbow to fend him off. He kept grabbing me and lashing out like an animal, I hit him one good time up the side of the head and it caused him to stagger back far enough for me to make a break for the dirt road leading to the farm. As I’m running I hear his truck start just before the sound of tires skidding and biting into the earth as he whipped the truck around to chase me. 

When I realized what was happening I dove for the rickety fence to the right of the road. It’s not super sturdy but it’s sturdy enough to fuck up his truck if he tried to ram through it to get to me. I kept running along the fence until it stopped, when it ended I ran into the woods to the right hoping I could remember how to get back to the farm house through the woods like I did when I was a kid. I heard Michael yell something intelligible before barreling down the road in his truck. After that it was complete silence, I felt my way through the ever darkening woods and attempted to follow the creek that I thought I knew from when I was a kid. losing all hope of finding my way out until I saw a glint of yellow light in the distance. I started towards it slowly at first but when the shadow of the building widened and became familiar I fell into a dead sprint, it was the farm house.

I get to the fence surrounding the house and look around. no sign of Michael’s truck, no sign of a disturbance of any kind, no noise, nothing. Just a single light on in what I remember being the master bedroom. Im not stupid, even with no obvious sign of Michael I wasn’t going to waltz in and put my feet up on a table, but I needed to go in, the nearest house is two hours away on foot and I was already feeling like shit. 

With luck Michael’s mom wasn’t on a bender and the phone bill was paid, I needed to call the cops, tell them that my best friend has gone batshit insane, talking about sacrificing me to his dead sister or something. I slowly creep up to the house, everything still looks clear and relatively undisturbed. I open the back door and stare down the long dark hallway filled with shadows of what I remember being Victorian style end tables and shelves. I walk on the edge of the floor closest to the wall in an attempt to stifle creaks in the old wood, it didn’t work as great as I would’ve hoped. Every creak sending a shock down my spine and causing my body to tense up ready for a fight. I enter the kitchen, the only light is the moon bleeding through the curtains, I find the phone next to the fridge. It’s not glowing green, picking it up and pressing the buttons confirms what I expected, it doesn’t work. 

I slowly put the phone back onto the receiver and head to the stairs, this is going to be loud. I creak all the way up the stairs wincing with every step until I come upon the bedroom door. I see the outline of Michael’s mom, sitting in front of the window far back enough to not be visible from the outside rocking in her chair. I slowly walk up behind her, whispering to her asking if she can hear me. As I get close to standing over her I notice her face is gone, what’s left is black edges with dark red oxidized meat and white eyes looking, yet seeing nothing.

I stumble back in shock before I get hit in the head, I still don’t know what it was. It hit me so fast and hard it didn’t hurt, it felt like waking up from a dream. No pain just fuzz. Everything was slightly black tinted as I was drug down the stairs, across the floor, the stepping stones, the yard, then the bed of the truck. The truck I hoped wasn’t there. It felt like seconds between the house and the pond. Next thing I know I’m laying on the bank, Michael loomed over me, crouched like a wild animal and gazing at the edge of the water. I slowly started coming out of my blunt force trauma induced haze, my first thought was that I needed to remain hazy, don’t let him know I’m awake and aware. Minutes pass and nothing, Michael kept checking his phone. Fog began to roll in and what sounded like whispers grew louder and louder.

“Ahhh…. It’s time Brian. Your brains might be scrambled but as long as you’re alive…. You’ll do. I didn’t want you to be involved in this to begin with, but I accidentally killed mom, she was the one I was going to trade but I couldn’t help myself. That was years in the making, I’ll never apologize for that, I’ll never apologize for any of this. Not if it brings her back, there’s nothing I won’t do to bring her back. I loved you Brian, but I always loved her more. She was all I really had or wanted. I’d trade you a million times for my Hannah back, Any second now I’ll be beckoned to offer you up and I’ll make the trade with no hesitation”

I continue my charade of sleep until I notice the voices getting louder. Michael then sits on the middle of my back and readies himself. I hear him gasp and as I look ahead into the murky water where I see a black lump form. I feel him loosen and lean forward, shifting his balance to the front before a ghostly white face appears under the lump.

I take the opportunity to lurch my lower half up and forward, Michael slips and headbutts the back of my head sending a shock through my skull. I quickly rotate under his legs and throw him to the side, we’re comparable in size with him having maybe five or six pounds on me and maybe slightly more muscle but he was caught off guard. I put my forearm over his throat before he grabs mine with both hands, I see wild desperation and anger in his eyes. I remove my forearm from his neck to grab his hands around mine, his grip is strong but he’s on the ground so I twist and put my shin across his neck. 

I successfully choke him with my shin before turning over and attempting to crawl away, as I crawl I feel a sharp pain in my right calf, I look back and see that Michael has buried a large pocket knife into my leg, as I look in horror he pulls it back out and continues stabbing my leg, I roll over again and before he can bury the knife into my shin I kick his hand hard enough with my good leg to break or hurt something vital to his grip. I lunged for the knife and so did he, we wrestled and grappled for it while cutting each others hands, I finally took it from him before stabbing him in the head, it wasn’t like the movies or games it glanced off a bit taking a large flap of skin with it but not really penetrating the bone, of course I was also hesitating slightly, he was my friend, I grew up with this man. 

He screamed angrily before I continued my assault on his skull, each scream becoming weaker and more gurgling as the blood from his face, eyes, ears, cheeks, forehead began filling his mouth and covering his lips. All that was left afterwards was a carved bloody pulp with ragged shallow breathing. I wiped the blood off me and nearly began to cry before I noticed whatever creature he summoned was still staring just above the water. I locked eyes with the creature and after what felt like an eternity I grabbed the truck Keyes off Michael and slowly started backing away, limping and never breaking eye contact with the creature, it seemingly never moving.

I went to the hospital and while I was there I asked for the police because I needed to report a crime, the nurse said the police were already on their way due to the nature of my wounds. After I was treated I told the cops a remixed version of what happened, I told them about everything except what I saw in the water. They’d never believe that, sometimes even I don’t believe that. They went to the farm, they found Michael’s mom….. but they never found Michael. I found him though, or rather, he found me. 

A month after what happened I started hearing taps on my window at around midnight, at first I ignored it but eventually I would get up and see. I’d see Michael standing there, grinning through peeled and shredded flaps of skin. I called the cops the first couple times but after several fruitless searches and wary looks I stopped. Besides, I don’t think there’s much they can do. I noticed that he never heals, and if I didn’t know any better I’d say he’s been rotting over the past three years. He whispers to me sometimes, should I hear him out? I miss him.
