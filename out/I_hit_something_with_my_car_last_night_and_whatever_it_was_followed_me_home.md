It happened last night. I was just getting off work and it was later than I had expected. Inventory night was always a monotonous affair at my job. This one had been worse, since we were badly understaffed.

I was annoyed by the delay and the fact that I was leaving almost an hour later than I had planned. I still had to pick up my medicine before the pharmacy closed and I was not going to make it unless I moved fast.

I rushed to my car and departed. Almost as soon as I got on the road, the sky opened up and a downpour started, cementing the already crappy day that I was having. I hated driving in heavy rain. It was stressful enough just trying to see anything. But it really did not help that my tires were threadbare and honestly dangerous to have when it was raining that badly. I knew I would be hydroplaning back home if it kept up.

I almost considered getting a hotel or resting in my car somewhere, but it looked like the storm was not ending soon, and I did not want to spend my night on the side of the road somewhere.

I drove on and managed to pick up my prescription just before the pharmacy closed, and started on my way back home. When I was about halfway there, the storm intensified. The rain was coming down in sheets, and I swear I saw a bolt of lightning lance through the sky and strike the ground only a few hundred feet from where I was driving.

I started to look for a safe place to pull over when I heard a strange static-like hiss. It sounded like someone was broadcasting the sound of a tire having its air let out. I was disturbed by the odd sound and looked around for its origin. My eyes left the road for only a moment, but that was all it took.

I looked up just in time to see a blur of motion, and the hissing sound intensified. Then there was a crash and thud. I felt the car rolling over something, and I knew I had hit it. I managed to stop from swerving and losing complete control. I saw a safe place to pull aside in the downpour. I jumped out and walked over to where I thought I had seen the thing I hit.

Whatever it was, it was gone now. All I saw was a splash of oddly colored liquid being washed away by the rain. It must have been blood, but the color seemed strange. Almost more of a fluorescent orange color than red.

I kept searching for a few minutes to see what had happened, but I could not find anything. Another bolt of lightning struck nearby, and the thunderclap was almost instantaneous. I felt stupid for looking for the thing out there in the storm and was worried I would get struck by lightning too.

I moved back to my car and decided to check something before leaving. I looked at the hood and bumper. I saw traces of the same orange fluid being washed off by the rain. But the strangest thing I saw was a hard, almost bone-like substance that was jammed through the hood and stuck down into the top of the bumper. It almost looked like a deformed deer antler, but the size and shape were all wrong. I tried to pull it free, but it would not budge.

I considered myself lucky that that thing had not gone a different direction and speared right into the glass and struck me. Whatever it was, it was strong and was lodged in my car really good. I figured I could investigate further tomorrow, and another even closer bolt of lightning convinced me to get back in my car and get out of there.

I managed to make it home without further incident and was exhausted. I was just glad to be done with the day, and as I stepped out of my car, the garage door finished closing behind me. Once the sound of the rain outside was drowned out, I turned back to my car as I heard an odd hissing sound and a bizarre chiming, like someone striking a tune on a xylophone.

I looked at the hood of my car again and saw the strange bone-like object. As I stared at it, the single overhead light bulb in the garage began to flicker. The sight was eerie, and I wondered again just what the hell I had hit with my car.

I decided I was too tired to deal with it that night, so I went inside and went straight to bed.

Normally, falling rain helps me rest easier, but I had trouble finding sleep despite how tired I was. The rhythm of the rain felt strange and there was an unusual amount of lightning strikes that continued to fall. Many of which felt too close for comfort.

When I finally dozed off, I had a bizarre dream.

I was in a dark forest, and it was raining heavily. I could not find my way out, and I felt drained. I walked out into a clearing and was struck by lightning. I remember the sensation was so strange, it did not hurt, but felt like the electricity energized me. But something struck me from behind, and I fell. I fell so hard that it felt like something had come broken when I landed. A part of me had come off. I could not feel my hands, and when I looked down, they were gone!

The last thing I heard before I woke up was a distorted hiss that morphed into one intelligible word,

“Return...”

I woke up in a cold sweat. I realized the window to my bedroom had opened up somehow. I figured I must have left it open slightly, and the wind did the rest, but I don’t remember leaving it open.

It was four in the morning and despite how tired I still felt, I knew I would not be able to get back to sleep.

Instead, I went to the garage and turned on the light. I looked at that strange object lodged in my car. The thing has a strange glow to it, like it was absorbing the light overhead somehow. I tested a theory and turned the light off again and surely enough, the object had a dim phosphorescent glow.

I started rummaging through my tools and managed to find a pair of pliers, shears and a pry bar. I knew it might cause some cosmetic damage to my car, but I figured it was already damaged at that point, and I had to study this thing a bit closer.

After working at the edges and pulling and prying and in one case, cutting the sections back from the car, I was able to pull it free.

It was strange, but when I held onto it, it felt very warm. It was so cold in the garage that I had not expected it and nearly dropped it upon examination. I was still baffled about what the thing could be.

I looked up the material online and even took a picture and compared it to a variety of animal bones, antlers and even a host of rocks and some bioluminescent algae, but nothing fit.

I spent most of the early morning examining the thing and I had to leave it alone for a while when I realized I had to get ready for work. Before I was out the door, I got a call from my coworker Ben. I answered and he was quick to ask,

“Hey, how's it going? Did you still have power over there?”  I was confused by the call just to ask that, but I realized the storm was still ongoing, so many people might have lost power.

I responded.

“Yeah, no outages over here, just some lights flickering. Why, what's up?”

“Well, it's crazy but the store is out of power, a lot of downtown is too. It’s strange, the lines are intact, but something just killed them. I figured I would call and tell you if you did not already get the notification, but people are being told to stay home since we can't work.” I was surprised the whole grid was down, but thankful I was not being affected yet.

“Oh wow, well thanks for the update. See you tomorrow if everything is back to normal, I guess.”

“Yeah stay safe out there.” He responded and the line went dead.

I figured that despite the loss in pay, it was not all bad. It would be an extra day off for me. So, I settled in on my couch and caught up with a few shows I had been watching. I zoned out binge-watching TV until it was into the evening.

The storm had not relented at all, and I saw the lights flicker repeatedly.

Near ten o'clock, the power finally went out. I had readied myself and had candles and flashlights all set. But the way the storm had whipped up was troubling. I heard the wind howling and the lightning began striking more and more.

I sat down on my bed and put some headphones on, trying to drown out the terrible sounds of the storm while I read a book and tried to get sleepy.

It was starting to work, and I was about to nod off when I heard a disturbing sound. It sounded like it was coming from just outside the room and I heard it clearly despite my headphones. It sounded like a raspy whisper and then the static hissing sound I had heard yesterday was back.

I stood up and grabbed the flashlight, panning around my bedroom in a paranoid state.

I did not know what was happening, but I did not like hearing that sound again. Something felt wrong. I waited for a few minutes on alert. Finally, I released the breath I didn’t realize I had been holding. After exhaling and turning to sit back down in my bed, I heard the whisper again. I heard it take on a more definitive voice and the word it uttered sent a chill down my spine.

“Return.....”

The same voice, the same word I had heard in my nightmare. It sounded like it was in my mind, but not just in my mind this time; it was just outside my bedroom door.

I thought I might be going crazy, but I strained my ears to try and listen. To my horror, I heard a large dragging sound coming from outside. It was like someone was pulling a bag that was too heavy, and the sound echoed throughout my house and in my mind.

I grabbed my phone from the nightstand and was about to call 911 since I thought an intruder had broken in, when I saw that my phone was completely dead. When I shone the flashlight on it, I saw that the area by the charging cable was blackened and scorched. It had been burnt by an electrical overload. It was not just dead, it had been destroyed by something.

I heard the heavy dragging sound again and the voice calling out once more, clearer than last time and more forcefully,

“Return!”

I started to panic, I had no weapons in there with me, nothing to fight with and no means to call for help. When I looked around, I saw on the shelf near my nightstand the strange object I had recovered from my car yesterday was glowing fiercely. It started to emanate waves of sickly colored light and for a stupid moment I considered using the sharp edges of it as a potential weapon.

But as soon as I took hold of the object a lightning bolt struck the ground just outside my house and the hissing sound became a primal roar.

The demand to “Return!” Grew louder and louder. To my horror, my door began to heave as something heavy crashed against it.

I was paralyzed with fear and thought I was going to die. Then the door finally broke off and I heard a massive form shamble into my bedroom.

The air around me felt charged, like the ozone was being agitated. I stole a glimpse at the nightmare thing that had broken in. The effort hurt my eyes and what I beheld was difficult to put in words. It appeared as a vague, undulating mass of orange limbs enveloped by sparking arcs of electrical current. The whole sight was an impossibility.

I thought I might scream, or cry out, but I just looked on in dumb confusion at the blasphemous mass.

I gripped the object I was holding in numb terror. Suddenly the sharp edge of the surface cut my hand and finally caused me to react to something, beyond incomprehension at the sight before me. I cried out from the cut as the monstrous bulk closed in towards me.

The thing was less than a foot in front of me then. It stopped moving and made a screeching sound, followed by a sharp hiss. Then the familiar word, perhaps the only sounds intelligible to humans that it could utter.

“Return.”

My broken mind finally yielded the answer. I looked at the thing and its shifting, distorted image hurt my eyes, then I looked at the pulsing object in my hands, humming with the ambient energy being given off by the eldritch nightmare in the room.

Then I finally considered the word “Return”

I forced myself up on trembling knees, terrified but committed to this last-ditch effort. I held out my hands and offered the object to the creature.

There was a long and terrible pause, followed by a clicking sound and another sharp hiss. Then in an instant, the object was snatched from my hand and a sound like sharp rock digging into flesh was heard. Then I saw a change.

Though my eyes could not fully focus on the distorted mass of limbs and energy, I did notice in the general area of the mass, where a head or face might be, there now stood a familiar antler-like formation.

The creature hissed and the sound caused a wave of energy to pulse through its body and sympathetically course through the length of the horn-antler of the thing.

In the next moment the air felt charged with electricity and a brilliant flash of light heralded a literal lightning strike straight through my ceiling and right where the thing had been.

I was blinded momentarily by the light. When I was able to look again, the creature was gone. There was a large hole in my roof and rain was falling into my bedroom, but I was confident that I was finally alone again.

I have no clue just what the hell it was that I saw.

Though I think whatever it was, was what I hit on the way home last night. Somehow, I had hit it on the way back and that part of it had broken off on my car. Then it followed me back. I don’t know how it was able to track me down and find me. I’m just glad I still had that thing, whatever part of its body that it was, because if I had not been able to “Return” it, well I don't want to think what would have happened.

The storm has stopped too, not just the lightning, but the rain as well. I don't know how, but I know that thing was connected to the storm, particularly the lightning, in some way.

Whatever the case, I am grateful to be alive. I don’t think I will be driving in any thunderstorms again anytime soon. Stay safe on the roads out there and be careful. You never know what you might find, or what might find you....
