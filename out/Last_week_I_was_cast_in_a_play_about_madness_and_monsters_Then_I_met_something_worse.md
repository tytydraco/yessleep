*“The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.”*

I used to think that Lovecraft quote was dramatic—until the night it came true.

I was recently cast as the narrator in the theatre’s adaptation of *The Call of Cthulhu*. I’m a frequent flyer when it comes to these plays, and I’m often given access to the theatre after hours to rehearse. There’s a strange calmness in its solitude.

I flipped through my script, staring out into the empty audience, when something caught my eye. In the fifth row of chairs from the stage, nearly dead center, sat a lone book that I knew hadn’t been there earlier. Was someone spying on me?

“Hello?” I called into the dark. Silence answered me.

I sighed and stepped off the stage, weaving through the chairs. “Fine, I’ll bite,” I muttered as I squeezed into the row. I reached the book—and gasped.

It was one of my childhood favorites:
*The Threaded Doe.*

I smiled, hugging the book tightly to my chest as memories of my mother reading it to me before bed came rushing back. It was a gentle tale about a magical deer who stitched stars into the night sky—our favorite story. But the warmth vanished the moment I opened it.

Grotesque sketches of creatures with hollow eyes and mangled limbs filled the pages—*The Threaded Doe* was gone.

Closing the book of falsities, I turned back toward the stage… only to find it gone. In its place stood a lonely red door, surrounded by nothing at all. A relic in the void.

My legs trembled as I slowly walked toward the crimson beacon of uncertainty. With shaking hands, I reached for the knob and turned it gently.

*Creak.*

The door groaned as it opened wider. My heart thudded rapidly in my chest as I peeked inside. I was met with the scent of damp pine needles and rich earth. I gave one last look to the emptiness behind me, then stepped through.

The forest was lighter than the theatre. The moon hung low, and the trees were cloaked in a thin layer of fog. I glanced down at the book still in my hand—and shivered. The pages were now blank.

Before I had time to process, I heard the cry of an infant in the distance.

My feet moved on their own.

I pushed through brush and bramble, the wailing child my compass in the night. For ten minutes I followed the sound, until moonlight revealed a slight clearing with an old well in the center. Just visible inside of the well bucket was the edge of a blanket.

As I approached, the crying stopped.
With shaking hands, I reached into the bucket and wrapped my fingers around the lump wrapped in a soft blue blanket. It squirmed gently and cooed in my arms.

“Who the hell leaves a ba—” My heart stopped.

Staring up at me was no baby.

Red eyes. Sharp teeth. Grinning. Its limbs were jointless, stretched too far, and its mouth split open like wet paper.

The thing leapt from my arms to the top of the well, crouching, ready to pounce.

I bolted.

“Zig-zag, Sophie—zig-zag!” I gasped, legs burning, lungs raw.

A building appeared between the trees—a small hut. I didn’t stop to knock. I flung the door open and slammed it behind me.

The creature let out a shriek and scratched violently at the walls.

I looked down. The book was still in my hand. Something was different though. I opened it.

A picture of the demon child stared back at me, but it was no child. Its limbs were jointless, stretched too far, and its mouth split open like wet paper. Above it was a single word scrawled in blood-red ink: **Cravyn.**

My breath caught in my chest. Panic bloomed in every nerve.

Then something moved inside the hut.

My eyes scanned the dim room until they stopped on her. A small woman, rocking slowly in the far corner.

“Sophie, so happy you could join me,” she croaked, extending a bony hand.

“H-how do you know my name?” I whispered.

She smiled with two rows of yellowed, crooked teeth. My stomach turned.

“Oh my dear, I’ve been waiting for you for ages.”

I backed away, arms crossed tightly around my shivering body. “Where the hell am I?” I shouted, barely holding it together.

“This is the Land of Lore,” she whispered, “where forgotten stories rot… and some come back to life.”

She lifted her hand and began to chant in a muffled, ancient tone. I didn’t recognize the words—but I felt their weight.

The floor beneath me began to shake.

Then came the bugs.

Tiny black creatures with beady red eyes poured through the cracks in the wood, twitching in every direction.

The woman rose to her feet and laughed—a high, wild, maniacal sound—as the swarm surrounded her.

I stumbled backward, tripping over a stool and crashing to the ground.

“Drel’sen vora,” she murmured.

The bugs turned toward me.

I screamed as they filled my eyes. My ears. My mouth. I couldn’t breathe.

I writhed on the floor, pleading for her to stop. She cackled, delighted by my agony.

At last, she raised her hands. The swarm retreated.

I looked up. Her grin was even wider now.

*“You better wake up, Sophie. Wake up. Before you forget how to…”*

My eyes snapped open.

I was back in the theatre.

I sat up, frantically patting my arms and legs. No bugs. No pain. Just me. I sighed in relief…Until I saw the book.

I crawled towards it and slowly opened it with shaking hands.

A photo of the old woman stared back at me, her haunting smile frozen on the page. Above her, the name: **Eldra of the Hollow.**

I turned the page and my ears filled with a sharp popping noise as I read the words:

Eldra of the Hollow whispers to insects and commands them with cursed breath. Her plagued creatures infest the body, burrowing deep into the flesh and mind. Only when the swarm retreats will the nightmare end.

Unless, of course… *they laid eggs.*
