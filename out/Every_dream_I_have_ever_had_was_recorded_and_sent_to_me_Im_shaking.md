I had enough money for the video recording of my dreams, so I bought it and eagerly waited for the team to show up. The team is part of a company named Disinter.


I discovered them after a bored search about the science of dreaming, which led me down a rabbit hole of people discussing dreams they had that happened to have occurred in real life afterwards. Far down that rabbit hole was a user on a forum who mentioned Disinter, an obscure company that was supposedly able to record just about anything from a conscious brain. It didn't ask for any bank information, and they had multiple video files of proof that could only be produced by high tech government technology.


When the team showed up, we greeted each other. They were friendly, enthusiastic, and chill to be around. I won't go into detail though as that's not what's important. They put a white MRI-like machine on my head, and after a few minutes of sitting absolutely still, the machine was lifted and the team promised they'd send me mp4 files with my recorded dreams in them. A rush of intrigue washed over me. But there was also a pinch of unease. Dreams can be absolutely random and the contents seem normal to us only when we're in the dream, so would I be watching a ton of uncanny looking creepy stuff in real life? I decided that couldn't be the case half the time at the very least and waited patiently for the email.


A few days later, it arrived.


"Your Dreams Are Here"


A rush of excitement ran through me and I opened the email right then. There were 288 attachments. Each one was labeled with a different time period. The first one was labeled "September 13, 2005 - September 23, 2005," which, as promised, was exactly three years after I was born. I scrolled down to the bottom. Surely enough, the last attachment was titled "December 28, 2022 - January 4, 2023"


I clicked the first attachment. The first dream was of everything being blurred out, as if being censored. Child me looked around, and I watched as I was pretty much seeing my childhood home again, and from my own perspective, although it was all blurry. Still interesting nonetheless.


Nothing to be concerned about though, as most of the dreams that followed took place in my childhood home. Things like old toys were interesting to see again. Other toys I couldn't recognize, so I wasn't sure if I made them up or not. And some toys were distorted shapes of random different colors and blurry formless variations of the same thing.


In the one named "October 7, 2006 - October 17, 2006," the seventh dream began in the dark. What's happening here? A night light came into view. Oh, this is me in my bedroom at night, I'm guessing. The sound of the living room clock ticking. For some reason it was nostalgic. But then there was a… sound. It sounded like a fwump, but muffled.


This was one of my childhood nightmares.


The POV looked at the night light. A hand covered it and brightened it, revealing a silhouette of an arm. Child me followed the arm and noticed a silhouette of a man. It was still. Child me stared at it. I knew what he was feeling. I remember this very dream. I was frozen, adrenaline rising, I wanted him to leave. I couldn't leave as my reaction was to freeze. Watching this dream, remembering having it myself, I knew what was coming next. The silhouette's mouth opened, revealing a simplistic bright red covering the lower half of its face. It wasn't so creepy watching it in the present day, but when I was a kid, it sent me shivering. Watching it back was like a form of closure. I wasn't afraid of it anymore, so I felt safe. And besides, it was essentially just a rip off of Treatsforbeasts… It didn't matter anymore.


That's not to say I didn't have any nightmares that stick with me to this day. Around the 2 hour mark in the recording titled April 13, 2007 - April 23, 2007, the scenery changed to that of an office filled with thick dark smoke. Computers and papers were strewn all over the floor. The smoke hung over me. This was a recurring nightmare of mine. This one still sends chills up my spine. I was cold watching it play out. Child me looked around until he found a door. They sprinted up to the door and turned the knob, but it didn't move.


Watching the dream in the present, I knew what was going to happen next. My breathing had become shallow. Child me looked behind him. A group of tall windows made up the wall across the room. As child me stared at the windows, a series of screams came from the hallway. They became distorted, sending chills down my spine as I watched on. These were creepy screams I hadn't heard in over a decade. I almost skipped through the video to avoid hearing them for any longer, but I needed closure.


My child self looked around at all the debris on the ground. Some of the computers were misshapen. Some looked glitched out. Some were more rectangular. Others were missing their back half. It was also odd how clear what I was watching was. It was in the highest quality I've ever watched anything in. The smoke began to surround child me, even obscuring the floor. As far as I remembered, he had no idea where to go. He stumbled around, waving his hands around as if it would help with the smoke. As he walked around, he eventually fell through the smoke.


Falling from a great height terrified me when I was a kid. Let alone being in a burning room or entire building. I would freeze thinking about it. Watching this dream, my stomach tightened. I turned my head away but continued to watch the video with my peripheral vision. It was a dream, but ideas are still impactful. Also, there should be more careful approaches to bringing up certain events to kids.


You probably think I woke up during the fall, but unfortunately I didn't. The ground got closer. My stomach tightened more as I watched the ground get closer. Child me hit the ground. Face against the pavement. Faint sirens and sad saxophone lounge music blared from all directions. From what I remember, I couldn't move. Child me audibly hyperventilated and began to cry. I'm just glad I didn't yet know the true effects of falling from great heights. Instant death, liquification, a huge mess on the ground.


I found I had the dream again in July 2007 with little difference. Once more in October 2007 with the only difference being that I was able to turn my head and see black buildings, firefighters, and paper. Then I had multiple flashes of the dream throughout 2008. I couldn't recall these flashes myself, but they were clear as day in the recordings. They always took place in that office. Everything was arranged differently each time, aside from one computer always having a cracked screen with the exact same color distorted picture.


The only time I remembered having the dream in 2008 was in September of that year. Even then, it was practically the same. Terrifying to me then, still terrifying to me now. Especially when watching it back. All the distorted and misshapen objects, less clutter than what would make sense, and eerie moments of silence sent more chills down my spine.


Most of the dreams were random scenes with blurred or distorted objects in random scenes. I'd be in my kitchen, looking through the windows and seeing a purple sky, copies of one house sitting beside each other, no fence, absolutely no sound whatsoever. Then I'd be in a room that looked to be like a mashup of my childhood bedroom and my current bedroom, complete with a bathroom sink with no faucet. Then I'd be in my 12th grade Math class. The teacher is an unrecognizable man wearing white clothes decorated with random grey splotches. Most of my classmates have elongated faces with irregular shaped mouths, no lips, and no noses. Some of them are classmates I had in that class in real life. At least they looked normal. There were also one or two classmates who looked normal as well, but I couldn't recognize them at all.


I'd look at a piece of paper on my desk. Random symbols were all that was on it. I'd look up at the ceiling then back down at the paper. The top of the page then had the school district logo, name of the school, and my name printed on it. The rest of the page then had random words for sentences all over it. I'd try to read it, but the page would be lifted off of my desk. I'd look up and see a boy my age with an oval shaped head and black curly hair holding the page, then tearing it up a few times and laughing.


Okay then.


That's really how it was with the dreams. There was no actual plot. Just random settings with random objects and a lot of misshapen, cloned, and distorted stuff… Be it objects, animals, or people. I didn't even remember most of the dreams I was watching.


Another thing I noticed was that all my nightmares had a much more coherent storyline than my other dreams.


One nightmare I watched back was from 2007. I was sitting on my bed, looking towards my door when I dark human figure with charred coloured skin and a messed up face popped up. It had a squiggly mouth running from the top of his head down to his chin. A pit formed in my stomach as I watched. This dream was still unsettling and downright terrifying. I thought I had gotten over it by the age of 10.


Child me looked to his left, only for another human figure to peer up from the side of his bed. It had dark red and somewhat purple skin, eyes without eyelids, and a v-shaped mouth with thin black lips. The pit in my stomach tightened as I continued to watch. It was very detailed. I wanted to skip through it. Child me looked down at his blanket. I skipped through the recording until I got to the next dream, which was of me eating pizza while a Rihanna song weirdly set to the tune of an Aphex Twin song played behind me.


There was an odd period of time from around March 2009 through September 2013 in which… well… I'll just explain it head on.


In one dream, I watched a video on YouTube of security camera footage showing a tall man in a suit following a shorter man around and standing still in his front yard for an hour. Watching the dream, I recognized the video. I had watched it back in 2014 and it gave me a load of chills then. Watching it again was just as chilling. Another thing I noticed was the YouTube logo in the dream was the post-2013 logo and in the dream, child me peered at the upload date. March 17, 2011.


One thing confused me. The dream was part of the May 14 - May 24, 2009 file. Somehow, I watched the security camera video in my dream years before I watched it in the real world. And I'm not misremembering anything either. Right after I watched the dream, I looked for the video on YouTube. When I found it, I compared it to the one in the dream recording. Same locations, same angles, same camera timestamps (2011,) same upload date, the same tall man was there, the same shorter victim was there… everything.


Maybe it was a mistake. There's no way I could see something in a dream before it existed in real life. Besides, in the dream, I was watching it on the computer in my childhood home, the home I lived in around 2009. In real life, I watched the video on a phone in an apartment.


But then I watched a dream from a July 2009 file. A news report played on the TV showing a tsunami carpeting a field with a landfill of wood, trees, cars, and broken up houses. "From the Pacific," the bottom headline read. This seemed quite vague, but I knew it was familiar. I pulled up videos of  the 2011 Japan Tsunami. I didn't expect to find it, but there it was. The exact video from the dream with the same details. Same field layout, same pieces of debris in the same spots. It gave me chills.


In an October 2009 file, I sat in the passenger seat of a car going down an iced up road. Child me spoke. "I can't believe I'm in Russia." The driver's hand pointed towards a tail of light in the sky. The light dissipated, then an ear puncturing loud bang erupted from the light's direction. Then I was reading a news article about a meteor exploding in the sky over Russia, with the publishing date just being Early 2013. I felt as much as a small rush of adrenaline. How was I seeing this?


In a March 2010 file, I was sitting on a roof in London, England, watching an apartment building burn. A news helicopter circled it, and the Big Ben clock stopped ticking. Chills ran down my spine watching the dream, as it reminded me of the fire in 2017.


In an April 2011 file, I was walking down a hallway while wearing a medical mask and gloves. A voice spoke over the system. "Please wait until further instructions are given." Child me walked into a room to the right. Three women sat in the room. One on a chair, one stood beside a TV, and one was laying on a bed. Each of them wore masks and gloves.


"What's going on?" Child me asked.


"Virus," the woman in the chair said.


The woman on the bed uttered something but I couldn't make out what it was. It didn't sound like a foreign language or even anything that would come from a human. Or even an animal. She wasn't showing any signs of sickness. And the virus I suspected it was didn't have any such vocal symptom. It was a dream though, so there's that.


"Stay away," the woman beside the TV said.


A man spoke over the PA system again.


"Today is March 12, 2020. Covid-19…"


After speaking the virus's name, his words trailed off into gibberish.


"2020? That's 9 years away! I'm in the future! Hopefully this virus doesn't kill everybody. Hopefully they make a cure," Child me said.


I felt frozen in confusion and amazement. I couldn't recall this dream, or any of the predictive dreams I had watched so far.


In a November 2012 file, child me was walking throughout his home, in which everything had a shiny glow. He opened the door, revealing a hideous sight. The trees standing around the houses across the street were infested with little black creatures the size of leaves, every window on the four houses I could see were boarded up, a pale white human head was sticking out of a storm drain, and little holes were forming on the road. Out of each of them came 10 foot long centipedes that squirmed off in all directions.


An intense sinking feeling overcame me. I remembered the dream. It was a nightmare that plagued my mind for days afterwards and had given me a fear of holes for a month. The head still gave me a sinking feeling. The centipedes still gave me chills. One thing I remembered about the dream were symbols in the sky that looked like a code. Watching the sky in the recording, because I was too creeped out to look anywhere else, the code slowly popped up. It was familiar, but the type of code it was has escaped me.


As I stared on, a dark red circular object hovered by and stopped above the doorstep. Oh yeah, this guy. An eye popped out from the underside of it. It had a brown pupil that glanced towards child me and just stared. Another pit formed in my stomach. It's difficult to describe how uncanny and realistic this thing looked. How the eye was part of it and somehow bigger than it. Child me looked at the road. The ground began to shake. More centipedes crawled out of the holes, then the head in the drain sunk out of view. It looked as if it had been pulled down by someone or something. I didn't want to stick around to watch some realistic looking freaky stuff, so I skipped through the video, looking forward to a complete scenery change.


I hope that dream wasn't a predictive one. Maybe it was some random stuff put together in anticipation of the supposed Mayan apocalypse, but it all stood out so weirdly. I never had a dream like that one before or since then. There was no indication of when the scene took place. The architecture of the homes reminded me of the homes around the northeastern US that were built in the 70s. It couldn't be far into the future. The adrenaline is rising. When and where did that dream take place? Maybe the creepy things in that scene were localized to that area only? I can't be sure, unfortunately. It's all speculation.


The final predictive dream was of large cartoon-like bombs with the Russian and old Soviet flags falling down on Ukraine during the winter. It's probably obvious what that was predicting.


After getting to the end of a December 2014 file, I was exhausted. By that time, I had dedicated a few hours each day for three days to watch a bunch of the dreams from each file. I closed the file I had open and checked the time. 1:30 AM. I had no idea it was that time already. I shut my laptop off, then I went to bed. I promised myself I'd take a lot more time to process all of what I had been watching at some point in the future.


The next morning, I woke up with somebody's arm around me. It was rotten green and white and its smell… I covered my nose to block it out. I pushed the arm off me and looked to my left. A rotted face with dangling skin and missing eyes laid on the pillow beside mine. I froze.


What the hell is this doing here? How did it get here? When did it get here?


After a minute of cold feelings, I looked towards the door. As I turned my head, I swear I saw its head move.


That shit didn't just move, did it?


I was about to jump off my bed and run, but a breathy throaty weak voice hit my left ear.


"Help us. We're contacting you using the most advanced measures possible for us. We first contacted you 10 years ago. Help us."


Chills ran down my spine. That hellish looking thing was alive. I could only associate something like this with wild hallucinations. However, I hadn't ever had a wild hallucination before. Maybe I was dreaming? I layed back down in my spot, resting my head on the pillow… and facing away from that horrible thing that was somehow alive despite its physical condition.


Ten minutes later, its presence vanished. I had woken up from whatever that dream was all about. I looked to my right and there was a crease in the bed. As if someone had been laying there. I didn't want to entertain the thought I may need to go to a doctor, so I got up and did my usual morning routine. Afterwards, I sat down at my desk and started up my laptop. Once my notifications flooded in, one caught me off guard.


"January 5, 2023 - January 15, 2023"


How? It's not like my dreams could've been recorded after the time I was visited by the team. I clicked on the file and a video started. I was walking down my home street, watching cars roll by. I skipped through the video and saw some familiar sights. I watched the running dream I had in the middle of last week, I watched the white lines in the sky dream I had on Saturday. I realized these were the dreams I had over the 10 days after the 4th. But how? They were never recorded. But they were recorded anyway somehow.


I skipped through the rest of the video and watched every dream I had that morning while thinking about sending a message to the company. After the video ended, I wrote up a message asking them how I got my most recent dreams despite not getting them recorded by the team after having them. While waiting for them to respond, my heart dropped.


The zombie dream wasn't in the recording.


I went back and skipped to the end. I was standing on a beach, covering my nose with my hand. The picture faded to white, then the video ended. That was indeed what I was dreaming right before waking up to see the arm and smell the body's terrible odor. But where was it? The dream about the zombie wasn't there.


I sent Disinter a second message asking about the missing zombie dream. An hour later, I got a response to both my question about the extra recording and the missing zombie dream.


"We thought you might appreciate it. Some of your dreams are very unique. Especially 11242012BrightHomeDarkReality04:23S, and so it's amazing we could have you as a client! We're sharing with you weekly recordings of all your dreams for the foreseeable future. Thank you!"


"Every piece of content in our recording(s) is unedited, preserved, and the content is owned by you. Anything not included in our recording(s) was a real world event. If you believe you recall a dream that wasn't included in the recording(s) make sure you:


Have watched the recording(s) all the way through.


Double check by watching the recording(s) all the way through a second time.


Consider you may have misremembered a past event as a dream.


Consider you may have imagined a dream you have misconstrued as a dream you had in actuality."


When I had the time, like… two weeks later, I revisited the late November 2012 file and scanned through it until the title mentioned above popped up at the top of the screen. Child me was in a bright home. He opened the door revealing the twisted scene I already described. It was that dream. Why would they find it so interesting? Was it the code-like message floating in the sky? I waited for the message to pop up, then I transcribed it. This is what it reads:


- .... . / -.-- ..--- -.- / -... ..- --. / -.-. .-. . . .--. . -.. / .. -. - --- / --- ..- .-. / .-. . .- .-.. .. - -.-- / .... . .-.. .--. / ..- ...

I need to continue on with my usual business right now. After that, I'm going to give myself A LOT more time to process all the dream stuff. I don't want to watch certain dreams again. I may even avoid opening the files those dreams are in despite the dozens of lighter dreams that accompany them. I'm just going to think about what all of this might mean. Well, out of what I watched anyway. There are dozens of files I haven't opened yet, and I don't feel very eager to. What if I think a dream about me dying is foretelling something?


This was exciting at first, but now I'm overwhelmed with confusion, amazement, and the creeps. I can't recall watching the nightmares without being overwhelmed with chills. I can't recall the predictive dreams without wondering how the hell I got information beforehand, then becoming overwhelmed with the unknown and a ton of anxiety about the future.


Don't get me started on where the hell that zombie came from and whether or not it's going to come back. A pit formed in my stomach just typing about it. I'm very creeped out.


I just noticed something on my sock. It looks like rotted flesh. Damn it, I don't want to have to move away from here.
