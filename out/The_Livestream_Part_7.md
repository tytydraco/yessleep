**Part 7 - History**

There was nothing none of us could say or do to stop Warren from going. He threw his headphones on the table and left the chat as we heard him walking out of the room and closing the door behind him.

-  “God dammit”, Henry sighed.

-  “Well, at least he’s going to the church first”, I said, “maybe they can talk some sense into him.”

I texted Warren asking him to please give us a call after his visit to the church before he decided to once again venture in alone in that house. It didn’t take long before an “*Ok, I will*” lit up on my phones screen.

He was a lot of things, Warren, but stupid wasn’t one of them. He wouldn’t put himself in harm’s way if not absolutely necessary. That much I knew.

Meanwhile, we all kept our eyes on the livestream, but there was still nothing but static, while discussing different scenarios and possible other ways to beat this thing. But we quickly realized we were out of our league here. Maybe Warren was right to contact the church after all.  
Our minds were on Ali, was she still in there, what had happened to her?  
We all knew that calling the cops again would be pointless, no way they would come back a third time.

A “ding” rang out from the chat as Warren logged back in, this time from his phone.

-  “Hey guys!” He said loudly, as the wind was blowing hard around him,

-  “I’m right outside the church now, but it doesn’t seem to be anyone here”, he said. “I’ve tried all the doors, but they’re locked, which is weird seeing how this would be a place that people would come to for shelter in this kind of weather”.

-  “Maybe you should just go back home dude”, Jen said. “We can talk this over some more and you can go back when the weathers cleared up?”

-  “Yeah, I don’t see that happening any time soon”, Warren said. “The skies are darker than I have ever seen them, hang on, I’ll switch to video so I can show you guys”.

We all got closer to our monitors, trying to make out what Warren was filming while he was walking around the grounds by the church. He wasn’t kidding, the skies looked almost edited, like straight out of a movie, they were so dark. The rain was coming down so hard we could hear it almost bound of the ground, and the wind ripped through the air with such force it sounded like it could tear the roof of the church at any moment. As he panned the camera past the church, we all almost simultaneously yelled out to him.

-  “Warren! Look”

-  “What? I can barley hear you guys”, Warren yelled back.

-  “There, at the back of the church!” Jen exclaimed, “There’s a light in the back window!”

A barely visible, dimly lit small window on the far end of the church could be seen on the video, the light flickering as if it was a candle on the other side of the painted glass, dancing within the safety of the thick stone walls, trying to mimic the trees movements of being tossed back and forth from the storm on the other side.

We could see that Warren had picked up on what we had found as he was rushing over there, the video bouncing this and that way as he was running towards the light.

-  “Hello!?”, Warren yelled while banging on the window. “Is anyone in there?!”

Around the corner there was a back entrance to the church, a small step leading up to a quite large wooden door with two huge brass door knockers which Warren promptly started to slam into the door with all his force.

-  “Hello?!” – He cried out again, while repeatedly banging so hard on the door we almost thought he would punch right through the massive wooden structure.

Finally, after what seemed like forever, we could see one of the doors slowly opening inwards, filling the frame with warm yellow light escaping out from the church as if trying to fight of the darkness surrounding the building.

-  “Come in, my son!”, we heard a deep voice with a clear Irish accent, say in the background as we watched Warren go through the opening.

-  “What are you doing out there in this hideous weather, my boy”, the voice continued. “Come, lets get you warm and dry!”. You could tell by the sound of the voice that it belonged to an elderly man.

Warren was holding his phone by the side of his leg while following the man into the room with the lit window. We all kept quiet and watched as he was led to a chair beside a table in front of a fireplace where the flames where dancing around each other in a chaotic manner. The man fetched a blanket from a cupboard and placed around Warrens shoulders and offering Warren a big cup of warm tea before he himself sat down opposite him.

-  “Come now, son. Tell me what you are doing out here in this weather. Are you alright?”

-  “You wouldn’t believe me…” We could hear Warren say softly.

-  “Why don’t you try me, my boy”, the man answered.

-  “I have my friends here with me!”, Warren suddenly said a little bit louder, lifting his phone to the man’s attention. A catholic priest, as we now could see.  
A very old one at that. His eyes sat deep below a pair of thick grey eyebrows. His hair, what he had left, shifting in the light between different kinds of white and grey neatly combed backwards, and his face, as kind as it was, showed proof of many years and experiences.

-  “Hello…” we all said quietly.

-  “Oh ok…”, the priest continued, his eyes jumping from looking at us to looking at Warren, clearly confused about what was going on.

-  “Listen.” Warren said. “We are caught up in… something that we can’t really explain, or… believe even”, he continued. “This was the only place we thought could help us, can you help us?” Warren said with a heavy voice.

-  “Well.” The priest answered. “If you tell me what is going on than maybe I could?”

-  “Right.” Said Warren, drawing a deep breath and glancing down at us as we all gave him reassuring nods to go ahead and tell the priest the whole story.

Warren continued to do his best to summarize the experiences we’d had during the last couple of days. He had positioned his phone so we could see the priest sitting at the opposite side of the table, slowly leaning in and listening intently. Occasionally, he looked over to all of us with a worried look as if trying to determine if this was just an elaborate joke or hoax, but it seemed our expressions matched the feeling in that room as to reassure the priest he wasn’t being pranked or made into a joke.

-  “…and that’s when Jen there”, Warren nodding over towards his phone before continuing, “found that this exact church had investigated that house once before, back in the 40’s.” Warren said. “They had concluded that it was a…”.

-  “Demonic possession…” The priest quietly interrupted while looking down in to his cup and slowly stirring his tea.

-  “Yes! Exactly!” Warren said, “But when they tried to perform an exorcism, the woman had murdered the priest and her entire family in a fit of rage before she herself died of a heart attack or something like that?”

-  “That’s… somewhat true”, the priest said, again very quietly.

-  “So, you know about that story?” Warren asked excitedly.

-  “I do”, the priest said. “Long have I feared the day that this would come back to haunt me.” He continued. “I knew, even back then, even as a small boy, that it wasn’t the end, that there still was something…dark remaining. I have sensed it a few times, I have felt the distinct feeling of not being alone, of being watched, of being…hunted.”

He took a big zip from his cup before clearing his throat and once again lifting his sight to look Warren in his eyes with a firm look.

-  “That priest that went there that day, that was my father.” He said.

-  ” And he wasn’t there alone.”

-  “Y..you where with him?” Warren asked quietly.

-  “Aye”, the priest nodded in a confirming way. “I was there, nine years old, in 1949, as it was my father’s wish that I’d learn all there was to learn about priesthood. Good or bad. “ He continued.  
“ I was there to see my father foolishly, alone, trying to perform an unauthorized exorcism. A duty never performed by just one person.  
My father was a strong man, a man of God. He was sure that we were dealing with something demonic, and he felt he couldn’t wait for the proper channels to investigate and approve such an action. He feared for the children of the house! With good reason, as history came to show. But he was certain that he could help that poor family.

I was there, to see my father being lifted into the air by an invisible force, before having his neck twisted and falling dead to the ground.

I saw that woman fly out of bed and attacking the husband as I ran for all that was sacred towards the door. I ran down the street with tears streaming down my face and my heart in my throat. I ran and ran until I collapsed on the street, and an elderly couple rushed over to see what was happening. They were the ones to phoned the police. It wasn’t until later that I found out that everyone in the house had died, and that I surely would have been one of them, had I not run. But I always, always had a feeling that there was something left behind from that day. Something that lingered. And now, alas, it seems it is on the hunt again.”

 

We all sat in silence and listened to this incredible story. We couldn’t believe what we were hearing. Everything that had happened to us over the last couple of days were being confirmed, we weren’t crazy, we weren’t hallucinational. These tings were happening for real.

-  “Ali!”, we suddenly heard Jen scream over the chat. “She’s still in the house! We have to do something!”

Warren looked over to the priest as if waiting for an answer to what to do.

-  “ My friends,” The priest said quietly, “I’m afraid an old man like myself isn’t a match for what dwells in that house. I can barely stand up or walk without a cane, let alone battle a demon from the depths of hell.”

-  “But we can’t do nothing!” Warren said firmly, thrusting his fist down hard on the table. “We can’t just leave our friend there to die, or worse!”

The priest drew a long deep breath before once again looking up at both us and Warren.

-  “I might have something that can help. I have feared this day for my whole life, but I have not been idle. I’ve been studying this phenomenon for a long time and gathered much information over the years. Follow me down to the crypt below the church, and I’ll give you what I have on how to combat these things”.

Warren took his phone and followed the old man to a doorway leading to a winding stone staircase, lit only by a few lightbulbs on the wall, descending under the old church. But for every step he took downwards, the reception got worse, eventually the connection to Warren was lost, and we all sat staring in silent waiting for him to get back online.

A buzzing and crackling sound rang out through all of our speakers and headphones, but it wasn’t from Warren.

The livestream had come back online, and on it we could clearly see Ali standing in the living room of the house, with completely white eyes, her head tilting to the left, starring straight into the camera and slowly raising her hand pointing her finger towards us.
