I sat up suddenly in my bed, sweating, and breathing heavily.

Something felt…wrong. The sheets under me were smooth but felt like they had no texture. I ran my fingers over them, but it was like my nerves couldn’t register the touch properly anymore, like my senses had been muffled by a thick fog. The air was dense, and the dim light coming from my bedside lamp seemed to have a strange vibration.

My heart pounding in my chest, an immediate sense of dread washing over me. The window looked out into the blackness of the night, a void that seemed to stretch on forever, and yet, it felt like something was watching me from the darkness.

And then, it happened. I wasn’t lying in bed anymore. I wasn’t even standing. I was…floating? No, *falling*. But not down. Up.

Gravity had flipped, like a switch, and I was being pulled through the ceiling, as if it didn’t exist anymore. My mind couldn't process it at first, like it was stuck in a loop of denial. There was no transition, no sensation of breaking through solid material. I just slipped through.

My heart raced as panic set in, limbs flailing in the empty air. I was being dragged upwards, faster and faster toward the night sky. My room disappeared beneath me, shrinking into nothing. I saw the roof of my house, my street, my town below me, but they weren’t familiar anymore. They looked distorted, as though I was seeing them through ripples of water, warped and twisted. I accelerated faster up toward the stars.

The night sky began to change as I accelerated upward. The sky above was no longer black; it was pulsing with hues—reds, greens, yellows—colors that felt *impossible*. And the stars… if they even were stars… seemed to shimmer in patterns that felt alive, writhing in the sky like they were putting on a show for me.

My breath came in ragged gasps, my body fighting the surreal sensation of weightlessness. Every instinct in me desperately tried to grab hold of something, anything, but there was nothing to grab onto. Just the endless sky.

*What is happening?* My mind scrambled for answers, but the thoughts came disjointed, fragmented. The world had turned on its head. No, *reality* had. Before I could scream, the stars themselves seemed to expand, each one growing larger and larger until I realized they weren’t stars at all—they were openings. Holes, gateways into something else, something far beyond my understanding.

And then I saw it. A ship. Not a ship like the ones we know. No metal hull, no lights blinking, no engines burning. This thing… It was *alive*. A mass of shimmering, undulating flesh and darkness, pulsating with veins that stretched into infinity. The closer I got, the more everything around me lost shape and meaning, bending and folding in on itself, as though reality was being torn apart. I didn't want to get closer, everything in my being was screaming no, but I was being pulled faster, and faster.

And then, everything stopped. It was if I blinked, and I was suddenly inside of it. The ship? The creature? I couldn’t tell anymore. I was surrounded by a pulsating glow, and I could *feel* it in my mind. The space around me was filled with a low, vibrating hum that penetrated my bones. The sound wasn’t just something I heard; it was something I felt deep inside me, like the vibration of my own blood was shifting to match it.

I tried to scream, but no sound came. My throat was paralyzed, my mouth open in a silent cry of terror. The walls, if you could call them that, were smooth and veiny, glistening with a slick, oily substance that moved in slow, deliberate waves. It was like I was inside a lung, or a heart, of some grotesque, living machine. Every inch of this place felt *sentient*, aware of me, of my fear. The air was thick with a metallic tang, like iron, and it felt as though something was crawling on my skin, something invisible.

That’s when I saw them. They weren’t like any aliens from movies or books. No little gray men or insectoid creatures. No, these things were *impossible*. They defied shape, flickering in and out of existence, their forms bending and stretching in ways that hurt my eyes, like looking at something beyond the third dimension. Their skin—if it could be called skin—shimmered with translucent patterns, like galaxies spiraling across them, as though they contained entire universes within them.

And they spoke. Not in words, but in thoughts. My mind felt like it was being ripped apart as their presence pushed into my consciousness, probing, searching. I could feel them rummaging through my memories, my thoughts, my very essence. It was like they were dissecting my soul, peeling back layers of who I was to examine something much deeper.

*You are ready*, the thought came. It wasn’t a voice, not in the traditional sense, but a deep, resonating vibration in my mind. I could feel the weight of those words pressing down on me, crushing me from within.

*Ready for what?* I tried to think, but the question came out broken, fragmented. I didn’t know what I was asking, or who I was asking it to.

The aliens, or whatever they were, seemed to pulse in response, their shapes flickering faster, almost as if they were laughing at me. My body convulsed, jerking involuntarily as they dug deeper into my psyche. I was nothing to them. Less than nothing. A speck, a fleeting thought in the grand, cosmic scale of their existence.

Time ceased to exist. Minutes, hours, maybe days passed, but I couldn’t tell. My mind was unraveling, coming apart at the seams. The things I was shown… the things they forced me to see… I can’t describe them. Not fully. They were *wrong* in ways that go beyond words. I saw the end of the universe, but not just *our* universe. I saw other realities colliding and merging, being torn apart by forces beyond comprehension. I watched entire universes be born and then die. I saw beings of light and darkness, things that existed outside of time, feeding on entire galaxies. 

I saw *what comes next*.

And then, as quickly as it had begun, it ended. The floor of the ship disappeared, revealing the endless space below. I was falling again. This time, down. My body spiraled through the void, falling faster and faster, until I back in my bed. My room was there. My house. Everything was as it had been.

I sat up, gasping for air. My heart pounded in my chest, the echoes of that strange, pulsating hum still vibrating in my bones. I looked outside. The sky was clear, the stars twinkling innocently above. But I knew. I *knew* they were out there, watching. I know now, they're always watching.

And I can feel them, every night, just beyond the edges of reality. I'm terrified to slip through again.
