The road to the Deathwish Well was lined with dark pines on both sides. The needles caught the low winter sun, such that the whole walk was in shadow except for the occasional blinding flash of sunlight when you turned a corner.

The road itself was pockmarked and uneven, strewn with fallen needles and branches, a hundred tripping hazards.

Jordan’s mood had lifted as soon as I agreed to join him at the well.

“Two for a spill,” he said, smiling wide. “Shit, I wonder what’ll happen to him.”

“Sounds like he’ll fall, right?” I said. “Or he’ll like, drop something? I guess spill can mean a lot of things. You can spill blood too.”

As I spoke, I checked back over my shoulder. I had the odd feeling suddenly that someone was listening.

“That’s part of the fun, I guess,” said Jordan. “You just give it a name. Then it gives you a surprise.”

Jordan was practically skipping.

“Did you know Frank Wu was the one who stole my Jordans?” he asked. “That was back in fifth grade. He said he’d kill me if I told anyone. I was so stupid, I really thought he’d do it.”

I remembered the day he came home in too-big loaner flip flops from the school’s lost and found. He’d told dad the new Jordans had disappeared from his gym locker. My dad had lost it, going after him with a belt while Callum and I screamed for him to stop.

We rounded another bend, and the road began to go downhill. A small valley stretched out before us. Near the base, I spotted the rubble of what must have once been a house: an ancient, crumbling stone chimney surrounded by rotting wood.

“Not much farther now,” said Jordan.

It was deathly quiet as we descended into the valley. As the road curled past the fallen house, I was even more sure someone was watching. The rubble was blackened from some fire long ago. I imagined a whole family burned alive, watching us as we walked past.

The well itself was a quarter mile away, down a smaller dirt path overgrown with weeds. Burrs caught in my socks and mud squelched underfoot as we walked, but Jordan didn’t seem to notice. If anything, he was walking faster now, more eager than ever to reach his goal.

Finally, past a pair of lonely pines, we reached the well. It was built of simple, flat stones. They might have been bound together by some kind of grout, but most of them seemed loose and disconnected, fragile even. A sheen of moss covered the whole thing. It barely even looked manmade, more like a natural feature of the place, something ancient and eternal.

It was starting to rain harder now, with dark thunderheads moving fast overhead, rolling over the sun. The coin in my pocket felt hotter than before, almost like it might burn my fingers.

“What do we do?” I asked.

“You just throw it in and say a name,” he said. “It’ll take care of the rest.”

He plucked the coin from his pocket and held it up. I could have been wrong, but I swore the rain sizzled as it struck the metal. For a moment, Jordan hesitated. Then he gently tossed it into the well’s gaping mouth.

The coin fell down into the darkness, clinking against the wells sides. It took far longer than I expected before we finally heard the plunk of water.

For a moment after that, everything was silent. Even the rain didn’t seem to make a sound. Then, just at the limit of my hearing, came a low, guttural sound. It wasn’t a word exactly, but it was definitely a question.

I looked over at Jordan. For the first time in a while, I saw that he was afraid.

“Frank Wu,” he said, stuttering just a little as he spoke the words. They echoed down into the darkness of the well, and then stopped all at once, as if they’d been swallowed.

Jordan looked over at me.

“Now you,” he said.

I reached into my pocket, hesitating. I could feel the heat radiating off the coin even from a few inches away. I was sure it would burn off my fingertips if I touched it.

“You promised,” said Jordan. “You promised. If I hit Frank with this little half-ass wish, he’s coming after me for sure tomorrow.”

I reached down and took the coin. It didn’t burn me. If anything, it felt good when I held it. I’d been shivering, I realized, but now the coin’s warmth spread all throughout my body. I held it up in the rain, and it almost seemed to glow.

“Go on,” said Jordan. “Throw it. You’ve never felt anything like it, trust me.”

And so I did. I gave it a small toss, and the coin arced through the air and then down into the dark. A few seconds later, it hit the water, and the low sound returned, asking its burning question. Asking for a name.

“Frank Wu,” I said, and as I spoke the words, a feeling of intense pleasure coursed through me, like I’d eaten something warm and delicious.

*Two for a spill,* I thought, wondering what I’d just done.

“You won’t believe how well you sleep tonight,” said Jordan. “And when you wake up, the first thing you’ll want to do is run back here and do it all again.”

As he spoke, something echoed from deep down in the well, the sound of something breaking through the water. Then came the echoes of thuds against the well sides.

“You’re going to want to move,” said Jordan. “You’ll be right in its way.”

The thuds were coming faster now, moving closer to the surface. I looked down and realized I was standing right in the spot where the path met the well. And yet, as I heard the thuds growing closer an closer, I found that I couldn’t move.

“Mikey,” he said. “Now.”

The thuds were almost at the surface now and coming faster. I’d been paralyzed like this before. Once or twice when my dad had really gone after Jordan, it was like I’d left my body. I’d just stood there, watching the violence happen.

“Now!” shouted Jordan, and this time, he wrapped an arm around my waist as pulled me hard. We fell in a heap into the grass at the side of the path. As we did, the thumps reached the surface.

I didn’t see the thing. Not exactly anyway. But I would tell that there were places where the rain no longer fell. The thing that exited the well was impossibly big. Certainly it couldn’t have fit down that dark hole.

I tried to make sense of its shape. It might have been a buck, but three times the size. But then I tried to count its limbs and counted six instead of four. The shape wasn’t stable either. It seemed to expand and contract with each ragged breath.

For a moment, it loomed over us, its bad breath making my stomach turn.

I knew that it could have killed us in an instant, or mutilated us in some terrible and permanent way. I sensed, in fact, that it even wanted to, that it only held back because it was bound in some way I didn’t fully comprehend. That the only thing stopping it from tearing our guts out was the fact it had heard Frank’s name instead of ours.

“Frank Wu,” Jordan whispered. “Frank Wu.”

And then it turned and galloped off down the path toward town.

“What’ll it do to him?” I asked.

Jordan smiled.
