Two nights later and I’m at home in North York. It’s well past midnight – New Year’s – and I’m flopped on the couch, nursing a double Maker’s, my third that night, trying to let an insipid infomercial wash over me, to squeegee Lorraine Clayborn from my brain. I’ve tried for hours to get to sleep. But her haunting words and that ghastly face I caught in the men’s room mirror have a hold on me and won’t let go. The image of that zombie keeps flashing in the corner of my eyes like an eyelash out of place. Hell, I just can’t shake the feeling that…

My attention is then stolen by the television set, drawn by a kitschy, plaid-suited salesman-type strolling across the screen. Even on the tube I can make out his bad skin – ice pick acne scars with a few lingering red pimples, radiant like traffic lights on a dark road against his marbled, alabaster flesh. He’s prattling on about something – desires, dreams, day to day frustrations. The usual snake-oil pitch. With his poor complexion, he looks so human yet so compelling. I can’t pull myself away from him. The infomercial itself is unremarkable, the wooden acting, shoddy lighting and camera work enough to give you an unintended hardon. I don’t remember what he was selling, or much of what he actually said. I do remember his name: Morgenstern. Same as the person Lorraine mentioned when breaking down her 2005 dreamworld loop. The creature, she said. I don’t think too much of it at the time – Morgenstern being a pretty common name in Ontario – or anywhere for that matter. But still, how odd.

I’m startled out of my trance by the sudden jangle of my doorbell. By now it has to be two in the morning, so having a caller at this hour is more than a bit unsettling. Grabbing my service weapon, spooked from the bizarre week, I creep to the door in boxers and undershirt and peer through the peephole, only to find my partner waiting anxiously on the front stoop. Relieved, I unlatch and open the door to let her in. I shrug apologetically, seeing Dee’s eyes on my Glock. Unfazed, likely sympathetic to my paranoia, Dee says nothing and drifts toward the den.

In her hand is what has to be a dozen sheets of A4 paper that look to be from a Xerox machine. We exchange curt pleasantries, her stern face telling me this is business. I point her toward the couch.

“You got one of those for me?” she says, chin-nodding to the juice glass of whiskey on the coffee table.

I chuckle, “Of course.” Dee is more of a beer drinker, opting for cape cods when she needs to tie one on. She once told me that scotch tastes like nail polish remover, so this will be interesting.  

I hand her two fingers of bourbon in a rocks glass, and she takes a stone-faced pull.

She smacks her lips and examines the glass. “Huh, that doesn’t taste like Bushmills.”

My smirk vanishes. Another dig at my indeterminate ancestry. “Fuck you,” I mutter.

Dee glances up once, trying for levity. This is serious. Christ, she was half in the bag when she got here.

“So, what’s up Donkey Kong?” I ease myself into the La-Z Boy, fourth drink in hand. “You aren’t still sore about Catney taking my side on the Clayborn case, are you?”

Dee shakes her head. Her eyes are staring into space, her mind a thousand miles from the room.

I take a sip of whiskey. “So, what’s up? Why’d you show up here so late? Don’t have anyone to spend New Year’s with?”

She twitches her lips, her eyes still steered from mine. “You remember what she said? Clayborn, I mean? About her and her family being the only real people and how the rest of us are holograms. How some of us are dead and don’t know it?”

With sweat forming moist crescents on my brow, I nod.

“I seem to remember something like that.”

“Well, yesterday I went to visit her in the hospital ward.”

“Say what?”

“She didn’t lawyer up. I asked her about this Morgenstern character she mentioned, the one she said she made the deal with. I figured her delusions might cause her to say something that could lead me to the kids.”

“You double-dipped on this without bringing me along? You know how much I love visiting the ICU.” I say the last part jokingly, but I am genuinely hurt by the exclusion.

“Just listen,” she snaps. “She told me her kids left on Christmas night – or Boxing Day morning, I guess – just after midnight. She doesn’t know where they went but told me that the reason they left was because they’d figured out the dreamworld was fake.”

“Uh huh,” I grunt, shaking my head, imagining Lorraine Clayborn with gauze wrapped around her head to the bridge of her nose, lying in bed in a smock, intubated, IV in each arm. “And how exactly did her kids figure out they were reliving 2005 over and over again?”

“They found proof. And she told me where they found it. She told me that her kids found newspaper reports of the night she’d murdered them all in the microfiche at the Meadowville Library near their home.”

A bit too buzzed, lost in the plot, I shake my head and ask, “What? Reports of when she murdered her husband?”

“No, reports of when she murdered all of them and herself in a previous year. Or rotation.”

I stare at her for a beat. “You’re not making any stinking sense her, Donkey Kong.”

“Rule 9, remember? Clayborn said that the world outside the loop goes on as usual and that news of that world can be accessed here in the dreamworld if you look in the right places.”

“Okay…”

Miffed, Dee sighs through her nose. “The kids found proof of the real world outside the looping dreamwork by going through the microfiche at the local library. They found archived articles reporting on the rotation when Clayborn killed them.”

Starting to get it, but woefully underwhelmed, I stare her down with my best hound dog look. “Sounds like she’s a stone-cold nut case to me.”

“I went to the library, Tim. I got access to the microfiche and found these.”

She takes four sheets of A4 and lays them on my sticky crumb-littered coffee table so that I can read what’s printed on them. I do a double take, screwing up my eyes, the sweat trickling down my nose. The headlines read: HIDEOUS MURDER-SUICIDE IN SUBURBIA, MOTHER POISONS SON, STABS HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER THEN HANGS HERSELF; EXTENDED FAMILY BAFFLED “THIS WASN’T THE ‘LO’ WE KNEW”; POISON FOUND ON DAUGHTER AND HUSBAND ALSO, ORIGINAL MURDER PLOT GONE AWRY.

I read between blinks, my face clenched into a fist. We haven’t contacted the newspapers, nor have we had any reach out for comment on this case yet. Plus, we still haven’t found the two kids. Where did these articles come from?

“Wuh-What?” I stammer out, unable to complete my thought, my fingertips kneading the back of my neck.

I can read the same bewilderment on my partner’s face. This is so surreal.

I exhale, letting my shoulders slump. “Another dead-end, huh?” I ask without heat, meaning my partner’s endless search for the kids.

“It gets weirder from there.”

“Yeah?”

She then hands me a set of photocopied news articles, each one with the date highlighted – 2006, 2007, even 2016. Reading them, I shake my head, pressing the heel on my hand into my orbital bone. They didn’t look doctored. And even if they were, how did they make their way into a public library’s microfiche collection?

“This doesn’t make any sense,” I wheeze. The monotonous buzz of the television set grown, I click it off.

I then notice there is one more sheet of A4 paper lain in Dee’s lap. The one she has yet to reveal. She seems to be guarding it like a precious heirloom. Like an illicit search history. Her glossy hazel eyes betray trepidation. Bad news. Perhaps the worst.

“What?” I squawk, finally impatient. I try to force a laugh, but it lands like a dead bird in the room.

Drawing in on herself, as if trying to climb into her own skin, Dee’s glance sinks into the floor, her thumbs dogearing the paper. Whatever’s written on it is faced down.

Not about to push it, I try changing the subject.

“So, what’re you thinking?” Meaning the articles she has shown me. “Are you thinking Clayborn planted these somehow? Or that guy Morgenstern maybe?”

My mind then flashes to that schlocky infomercial. *Morgenstern*.

“I don’t know,” says Dee, returning that mile-long stare through the wall. “Maybe she planted it, but this seems like a lot of trouble. And a lot of resourcefulness. Plus, why plant articles implicating herself?”

I scan the photocopies again. They are published in reputable(ish) rags. And they all look authentic. Too authentic to dismiss.

“Adding to all the weirdness,” she says, “I went up to one of the librarians working at the desk, right? To inquire how these got into the microfiche collection? And this dude started getting all hostile, asking me to handover the photocopies, telling me I’m causing a disruption and have to leave. He actually came out from behind his desk and started pushing me, actually trying to shove me out the door. He didn’t stop even after I showed him my badge. Finally, I had to threaten to arrest him for assaulting an officer to get him to ease off.”

My forehead puckers. “What did this guy look like?”

“Tall – really tall – long pale face, blonde with a ponytail. He looked kind of like Jay from Jay and Silent Bob. Or that Harvard student – the real obnoxious one – in Good Willing Hunting. You know the guy I’m talking about?”

“How you like them apples?” I recite the famous line from the movie.

“Yeah,” Dee chuckles, her first sign of mirth that evening. “That douchebag. Anyway, I wouldn’t have thought anything of it except Inspector Catney calls me in this morning to his office. When I got there he tells me I start at the Domestic Violence unit at 08:00 tomorrow.”

“You’re being transferred out of Homicide Unit? For what?”

She shrugs. “I asked for an explanation, being real polite, right? Asking what I did wrong – but it was the same old bullshit. They need support down at Domestic Violence. I’ve done good work here so maybe I can help prop them up, blah blah blah.”

I set my jaw and rack my brain for an answer.

“Somebody at the courthouse?” I begin spit balling. “Or maybe the Crown Prosecutor’s office? Somebody tight with Clayborn from when she worked there? But Catney told us she had no strings left to pull.”

“It isn’t them, Irish. It isn’t the bureau either. It’s something to do with me finding those.” She gestures to the Xeroxes.

I cock my head back. “What? You mean that librarian – that Cyril O’Reilly-looking punk was a somebody? Some judge’s nephew or something?”

“I don’t know,” Dee talks over me, in no mood for sarcasm. “All I know is –”

She then cuts herself off, her voice falling to a whimper, her eyes darting over my head and scanning the windows. Gooseflesh forming, I crane my neck and look about too. No one’s around. Nothing to be seen out the window beside the street and the usual parked cars.

Settling back into the couch, Dee continues in a whisper, “All I know is that ever since taking those photocopies, I’ve been getting followed.”

“Followed?” I balk. “How do you mean?”

“Exactly what I said. Followed. I’ve caught a black Camry following three lengths behind my Crown Vic. The windows are tinted so I can’t see the face. I try pulling them over, but they always turn a corner and vanish before I can get to them. And I’ve also been seeing this woman – about my age – a redhead in a wheelchair. I’ve never seen her being assisted by anyone either. She never looks my way, but I see her. She’s literally everywhere I go now.”

I nod pendulously. Dee worked a beat for several years in the Region of Speck when she was a cadet; she knows these neighborhoods and their residents better than anyone. And our district – consisting of the municipalities of Aakoziwin, Haggert and Hewitt – has just under a million residents, so there’s no way you’d keep seeing the same face pop up time and time again without it being on purpose.

 “Look, let me see if I can talk to Catney, or even Deputy Metcalf, put some pushback on your transfer. No sense in you working anywhere but Homicide, except if you’re going up the ladder.”

Dee looks crestfallen, her mouth forming a squiggly miserable line.

“Tim,” she says. “I wouldn’t bother with that. I’d focus more on getting to that library and figuring out what’s going on for yourself.”

Uncurling her balled hands, she plucks the single A4 from her lap and holds it out for me to take. Not in a goading type of way. More as a tepid offering.

Exhausted and sourly buzzed, I rip the paper from her proffered hand and read its printed side. The first thing I notice is the black and white photograph. It’s of me. It was my staff photograph taken at the badge pinning ceremony when our chief was sworn in ten years ago. I had a little less bread in the basket then. The headline is the second thing I notice: HONOURABLE AND BELOVED DETECTIVE GUNNED DOWN IN DEADLY AMBUSH: Organized Crime suspected in connection with slaying of Speck Region police detective “Irish” Tim English. The article is published in 06.

I peruse the article, reading it again and again. The details sure do smack of enough truth: I had worked in the old Toronto Drug Squad in the mid-nineties before landing in the Region of Speck Homicide Unit, headquartered in Haggert. Before my transfer I had hoped to go into the Specialized Investigations Unit in the city, but was told, in the most delicate of terms, that they needed police who could work undercover. Which I understood; a cop like me working undercover in the Toronto underworld would be about as subtle as a gold star pinned to your chest. Regardless, my time working drugs, taking down wise guys and bikers had earned me plenty of enemies, plenty of roughnecks itching to take me out and pay good money for it. I’d always figured this would be how my ticket would get punched.

I’m numb to the prospect of my nearing demise; having come close to death’s door many times, spending most of my week visiting the morgue, and being fiscally castrated by my now ex-wife, living another decade seems scarier to me than getting snuffed out by some outlaw MC goon. In fact, some gangster getting his revenge on me seems far more glamorous than eking out my last days on a pension, or stuck in some nursing home on Main Street. What jacks my heart rate is this one detail: gunshot wound to the head. With that detail alone, I recall the grisly visage in the men’s room mirror the night we charged Lorraine Clayborn: the blown-out eyeball and gaping gullet.

A deafening quiet permeates the room.

“I didn’t want to show you,” Dee says. A kind of apology.

“A little too late for that, isn’t it? Why’d you bring it then?” I surprise myself with my own vehemence. I suppose the not-so-subtle harbinger of my own death has affected me more than I care to admit.

I fold the paper in half then hand it back to her.

When she’s gone, I sit and stew in my underwear. Sleep now a pipe dream. Again, my mind catches on that name: Morgenstern. Sprinting into the kitchen, I dive under the sink, retrieving week-old newspapers I meant to use to line my German Shepherd’s kennel with. Skimming the classifieds, it doesn’t take me long to find what I’m looking for: Morgenstern and Legian, “We Sell Dreams by the Skyful.”

I drive to the address printed on the ad the next morning. There I find a mustardy cinderblock office building situated near mounds of upturned earth and unmanned cranes, like a fancy overseer’s office instead of the usual double-wide trailer. Alone in my car, I stare at the mustard building then glance at the torn-out ad lain on the passenger seat. This place looks as banal and innocuous as the rest of the boxy Aakoziwin suburbs.

I don’t have a warrant or PC to search the premises. And I doubt this could even be considered official police business given the Joshua Clayborn case is closed. I have to just hope this Morgenstern fella isn’t averse to coppers. And of course, they might be closed, given the date is January 1st. Still, there could be a phone number for emergencies posted on the door. Plus, I doubt this Morgenstern guy's business is completely legitimate.

I open the door and begin wheezing myself out of my vehicle, but as soon as I plant one foot on the clay-coloured soil, I’m seized by an intense sense of dread. Like déjà vu if déjà vu could feel like a waking nightmare. Cold sweats. My blood singing in my ears. Something’s not right here. It’s hard to make plain on paper, but I’m certain I’ve been there before. That I’ve tried do all this before – like for a separate investigation. And the fact that I can feel this but can’t remember any of it frightens me. Chills me to the bone.

So, I leave without looking back. Leaving Mister Morgenstern and his associates unmolested. I’ve tried searching all the databases at my disposal for a Morgenstern or any history pertaining to that address or business but found no matches. Zip. Nadda.

Nothing adds up. Nothing makes sense.

I haven’t bothered broaching the subject to my unit commander, Inspector Catney. Somehow, none of this seems real to anyone except me and my partner.

I have done some digging into my apparent slaying next year, going to that library and sliding through the microfiche. Turns out there’s no connection to my years in the Toronto Drug Squad; the guy who took me out was just some spaced-out tweaker on oxy nursing a sawed-off shotgun. He was hunkering down in an apartment I was checking out, following a lead in another case. This makes me feel worse than the prospect of dying – knowing I’ll be taken out at random, almost a fluke – by some junkie nobody. Like all I’ve done on the Job – all the cases I’ve solved, don’t add up to much.

I’ve asked for a transfer out of the Homicide and Missing Persons Bureau, to somewhere quieter and behind a desk. I’ve also been upping my home security and thinking about retiring with part of my pension. Or just finding another job altogether. I don’t know. It all seems arbitrary, considering that I have a deep suspicion that I won’t make it that far. That I can’t stop what’s coming. Maybe Lorraine Clayborn is right; maybe we’re just stuck in an endless loop, reliving the same cycle over and over.

The weirdest part of all is that I’m writing this all five days after New Year’s. So how come all the calendars still read [2005?](https://www.reddit.com/user/snickeringhaystack)
