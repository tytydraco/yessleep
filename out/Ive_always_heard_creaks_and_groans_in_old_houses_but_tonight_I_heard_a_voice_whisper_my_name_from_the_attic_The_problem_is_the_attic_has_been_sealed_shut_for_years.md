I’ve always loved the history of my house—an old Victorian with creaky floors and hidden nooks. The attic, though, was sealed when I moved in. The previous owner had boarded it up, and the realtor mentioned something vague about water damage, nothing I felt the need to question at the time. Over the years, I didn’t think much about it. I had no reason to. The house was full of quirks and sounds that seemed typical of an old home—wood creaking, pipes groaning, wind howling through cracks.

But a few nights ago, something changed.

It was past midnight, and I was lying in bed, trying to sleep through the usual noises. As I started drifting off, I heard something new: a faint, rhythmic tapping. It sounded like it was coming from above me. From the attic. I tried to ignore it, telling myself it was just the wind or maybe the house settling, but the tapping grew louder, more insistent.

Finally, I got up and wandered to the hallway beneath the attic door, staring up at the ceiling. The tapping stopped. I stood there for a moment, heart racing, telling myself it was nothing. But just as I turned to go back to bed, I heard it—my name. Whispered softly, almost too quiet to hear, but unmistakable.

“Daniel.”

I froze, my skin prickling. I told myself I must’ve imagined it, that it couldn’t be real. But then it came again, clearer this time, almost… pleading. “Daniel, please.” It was coming from the attic.

I backed away slowly, heart pounding, and tried to rationalize it. There was no way anyone could be up there—the attic had been sealed shut for years. No way in or out. Still, my name echoed in my head, the sound too real to dismiss. Something wanted me to open that door.

The next day, I convinced myself it was just my mind playing tricks. But when I walked past the attic in daylight, I felt a strange pull—an urge to know what was behind the door, what was trying to call me. By afternoon, I couldn’t take it anymore. I grabbed a crowbar, climbed a chair, and began to pry the boards loose. The wood splintered easily, revealing a thick layer of dust beneath. As the last board fell away, I reached for the door handle, my hand trembling.

The attic was pitch black. I turned on my flashlight and climbed the creaky stairs. The air was thick, musty, and it felt as though no one had set foot there in decades. My beam flickered across old furniture, forgotten boxes, and layers of cobwebs. I nearly turned to leave, convincing myself there was nothing here, when I saw something in the corner.

An old rocking chair, facing the window.

As I stepped closer, the air grew colder, unnaturally so. My breath fogged up in front of me. I reached the chair, shining my light onto it, and that’s when I noticed the imprint. A deep impression in the seat, like someone had been sitting there for years.

Before I could move, the chair began to rock. Slowly at first, creaking back and forth. And then, from behind me, that same voice whispered again. “Daniel, you shouldn’t have opened the door.”
