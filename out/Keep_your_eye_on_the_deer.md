Pine trees sway in the wind while glimmers of sunlight peak through gaps in the needles and branches. I’m sitting with my friend, Tom, in a hunting blind. I say hunting blind but it’s really just a fallen tree that we laid branches over. We are covered in camouflage, long sleeve shirts and pants. Our faces are covered in dark greens and black to hide our pale complexion from our prey.

Across from us in a giant field, a group of six deer casually graze through tall grass. Every so often, one of them raises it’s head suddenly to stare off into the distance at something. Only to put its head down several moments later. 

We’ve been out here for at least several hours and the sun was beginning it’s descent into the horizon. There are still several hours of daylight left. Several hours for us to bring home a trophy buck.

“It’s getting late.” Tom whispers to me. 

I just nod to signal I understand. When hunting you need to minimize noise. This is our fifth weekend in a row sitting out here waiting for a buck. Truth be told, we had seen smaller bucks on several occasions. But they wouldn’t get us any bragging rights back at the bar. 

The wind is blowing directly into my face. The cold breeze penetrates my face paint like little frozen fingers caressing my cheeks. 

“God this is miserable.” I muse to myself. 

On the far tree line, we see a large hulking shape moving through the trees. Something big was making it’s way out of hiding and into the field. I feel my hands begin to shake with excitement, as a massive set of antlers appears. This is the biggest buck I’ve ever seen. It’s a monster of a deer with twelve antler points.

I look over to see Tom’s bulging eyes staring back at me, his hands shaking as well. We creep into a better shooting position while I get my bow and arrow ready. Tom nags me for being a try hard but I love the feel of a bow in my hands. One hand squeezes the leather handle while the other notches an arrow.

I get down on one knee while Tom perches himself on a branch above me. I can’t normally stay in this uncomfortable position long but today I can’t feel anything. Adrenaline is racing through my veins while tunnel vision clouds everything except the antlers.

The buck makes it’s way to the group of deer. They take notice immediately and keep their eyes trained on him. Maybe this is the biggest buck they’ve seen too. As this beast of a buck approaches, one of the does makes her way to greet him. 

She approaches and lifts her nose to touch the nose of the newcomer before collapsing to the ground like a rug was pulled from under her. We watch as the buck lowers its head and starts eating grass, like nothing happened. 

Tom and I exchange a puzzled look. What happened to the doe and why was the buck so unreactive? Normally, deer bolt off into the trees at the first sign of danger. One of the other does stomps her foot and snorts loudly. In a flash, the rest of the deer scamper off into the forest. Their white tails flap up and down before disappearing completely into the trees.

But the buck was still standing there. He wasn’t even eating now but staring directly at us. What was he looking at? Did he detect us? 

“I don’t like this one bit” I crane my neck up and whisper to Tom. 

He pulls out a pair of binoculars and pushes them into his face. The binoculars hit the ground almost immediately as he lets them drop to the ground.

“What is it?” I question trying to stay quiet but he doesn’t respond.

I snap my eyes back to the buck and a shiver runs down my spine. The deer is staring right at me. I pick up the binoculars and zoom on the deer.  
  
“K-ke-keep your e-e-eye on th-th-the deer.” He stutters while his body begins to shake.

The deer doesn’t have eyes. Dark eye sockets fill the voids where its eyes should have been. Its face hung from its skull covering only half of its skull. Its teeth are stained black and are dripping blood. I walking corpse is staring directly at me. 

“TOM,” this time I shout “It’s time to get out of here!” 

Tom looks down at me, his expression is petrified. The color from his face is completely gone. For several moments, we just stare at each other in disbelief. He slowly turns his head back to the field and then immediately snaps it back to me.

“Ava the deer is gone!” he cries out.

I scan the field with the binoculars but the deer is gone. The field is quiet as a tomb, not even the wind blows. I hear Tom struggle above me but before I can remove the binoculars something hard slams the back of the head. My vision immediately fades away.



When I wake up it’s completely dark. I had been unconscious for hours because the trees looked like silhouettes against the twilight sky. The night’s frigid air was making my body shiver uncontrollably. My head was throbbing and I could feel a bump on the back of my head. Color had left the world completely except for a fiery glow in the woods. The glow was faint but it looks like someone had setup a campfire.

I stood up and made my way through the field towards the forest. Tall grass brushed against my bare forearms. I flinch as a briar catches my skin, stabbing into my flesh. I stumble in the darkness until I reach the tree line. The fire looks brighter now and I start to smell smoke. I have the urge to call out to Tom but hold back. What if that thing hears me?

Under the trees, the ground is mostly empty. I don’t have much trouble finding my way except for the occasional low hanging branch. I narrowly miss hitting my head on the nearly invisible branches. I push aside a tree branch and see Tom sitting in front of a campfire. He is frozen like a statue while just staring into the flames. 

“Tom!” I shout to get his attention. 

Tom’s head turns slowly to face me but his eyes look straight the entire time. The fire light dances on Tom’s face, illuminating his blank expression. For brief moments, his face is visible before being plunged back into total darkness. 

“Hey…man” I question “Are you alright? I saw the fire from back where we were hunting.”  
  
Silence. Tom doesn’t speak a word but just stares back at me. His face is devoid of emotion. We study each other for what feels like an eternity before he opens his mouth and vocalizes.

“Let’s just stay here tonight,” Tom speaks without moving his mouth, his face plunges into darkness “we can sleep in the dark if you want to…”

The sides of my head begin to tingle before spreading across my body. The fire roars back to life but Tom’s face is now hanging off his head like an open door. His skull stares back at me and he has black sores on his neck. I blink and Tom is instantly replaced by a massive monster masquerading as a deer. Its face is gone, all I see are the dark eye sockets of its skull. Furry flesh hangs off its exposed skeleton like a poorly worn coat. 

My body jumps back as my feet kick up into the air. I fall on my back before rolling and jumping off the ground. I sprint back the way I came and feel the ground begin to rumble. I glance back and see the monster racing after me. I put my head down and run as fast as I can through the woods ahead of me. 

Small branches smack my body as I blindly rush through the forest. I still feel the monster chasing after me. My skull collides with a thick tree branch slamming my back into the dirt. I feel antlers spear into my forearm before lifting me like a rag doll. My shoulder feels like it’s going to tear from my body. The monster hurls me into a nearby tree trunk with a thud.

At this moment, I realize I am going to die. The scent of rotting flesh fills my nose as my throat starts to gag. I close my eyes and accept my fate. I hear the monster approach me, its steps vibrating my body into even more pain. 

The ground starts to shake faster and I hear the monster crash into a tree. I open my eyes and see it’s antlers stuck in a thick pine branch overhead. I see my chance and dash away as fast as my legs will carry me. 

I feel ground shake less and less as I continue sprinting through the forest. In the distance, I can see the field now visible by moonlight. My arm throbs in pain with each step I take. It feels like someone is hammering nails into my bones. I stumble into the field and see a full moon shining down on me. 

I am out of breath but I don’t have time to wait around and recover. So I jog while my lungs feel like they are catching on fire. I find the path Tom and I used to get to our hunting spot. My truck is parked at the end in a small parking lot just off the main road. 

With my one good arm, I enter the pickup truck and start the engine. My right foot slams the accelerator into the floorboard. Rocks soar as my tires tear into the gravel parking lot. I finally hit the main road and hear my tires screech against the asphalt leaving a white cloud behind me. I glance in the rearview mirror but see no sign of the monster. All I see is moonlight shining through the trees back at me. 

At the local hospital, I pull into the drop off lane in front of the emergency room. I don’t even turn off the truck before jumping out and limping through the sliding doors. Each movement sends a jolt of pain through my arm. Dark green puss is leaking out of the puncture wounds in my forearm and onto the floor. The wound smells like it’s rotting but I can’t keep my nose away from my own arm! 

A nurse walks out, looks at my arm and immediately yells, “CODE BLUE! We need a doctor STAT!”

I’m nearly shoved onto a gurney as nurses swarm my sides and rush me down the hallway. I see at least four faces looking down at me with worried expressions. The gurney blasts through the operating room doors and I feel my vision start to fade away.

When I awake, I see that my left forearm is completely gone. A bandaged stub of an elbow is all that remains. I still feel like I have an arm but nothing is there when I go to grab it. That and the painkillers make it hard to feel anything at all.

I’m writing this because I don’t know how much time I have left. I can see small sores forming on my skin and my vision is blurry. I need to warn you before its too late. 

I shudder to think what would’ve happened, if that thing didn’t get stuck. If it had gotten me. So, if I don’t make it, just remember one thing: If you see a deer acting weird or staring at you for a little too long, keep your **fucking** eye on the deer!
