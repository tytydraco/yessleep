She always liked the past most. Her style told you as much. 

So you introduce yourself at the second-hand book store when you see her again. The one where you saw her the week before, browsing the hard-cover collectible section, and you wonder why the fuck would anyone would pay two hundred bucks for a George Eliot. 

You say something like, “Couldn't get through Middlemarch, myself.”

And you immediately think what a stupid, dumbfuck line to open with. But it's done. 

And you can tell she knows it was a bad excuse. 

But, she smiles anyway.

Then a week later you walk into the house she had made for herself. 

A house of old things. 

Rows of porcelain ornaments in an antique cabinet. Wooden chairs with brass-buttoned cushion-tops and silver-lined crockery in the kitchen. A rolltop writing desk perpendicular to a finely carved dresser in her room—both in the same dark shade of wood, well-pollished, fanatically dusted.

Things that reminded of something you never knew.

Over the following months she teaches you why. That old things were transcendent; and the atmosphere within many old things was much more than an affectation. 

That it was a world inside this one. 

The past still speaks, she said. Her dresses and the bouffant she wore on special occasions, it was to keep her closer. A way for her to belong in the world she had made; her style the vessel that aided the escape.

But the past, for me, now, it's just a painful reminder.

And that night—as had become the norm by then—I could hear it, coming from somewhere down the hall.

I stretched with a yawn and turned the lamp on. The clock on the wall read 2:01. 

The same time as always.

Every night since I moved to this place, this shitty old apartment with falling wallpaper and leaks in the loungeroom when it rained. Cheap in more ways than one, but it was the closest place I could find. The closest to her, at least.

Always the same, the sound was. Always beginning at the same time.

I didn't think much of it, at first. 

When I noticed the time was the same the third night, that's when I started paying attention. Something wasn't entirely regular, to put it mildly. I'd never had much truck for the supernatural, so it took a lot to get me curious.

Several nights of 2:01 was more than enough.

So I edged the bedroom door open one night, and more distinctive it became as a quiet kind of groaning, elongated and deep, that lasted for exactly three minutes when I timed it later on. 

Maybe I should've considered unknowable things more in my life. The one in three of us who believe in ghosts, they're probably better prepared when faced with shit like that. 

So, fuck no, I thought, and went back to bed. It was just the pipes, most likely.

After a month I was more or less used to it.

Well, as much as is possible, for the routine groaning of a potential ghost in your apartment. Which idea was stubbornly hard to shake.

I didn't know where it came from, exactly. Still hadn't been ballsy enough to check after three weeks. By the resonance, though, I reckoned it possibly came from the upper duct down the hall. Sounds as unsettling as that usually came from small spaces, I reckoned Mulder and Scully would say.

But it was fine. I was fine. Nothing had come of it yet. And part of the not caring was that it wasn't the sound that woke me.

It was the dream I had beforehand.

Which was the same one it always was.

This dream of the park down the river where we celebrated our third anniversary, before I proposed.

One of those dreams, like all dreams that make you feel rich, that carries warm well into the morning. 

Like a buffer, of sorts, when the sound came.

Maybe that was the point—and to this day I like to think that it was, if only partially.

I could still see it clearly after I woke. She was wearing that roses on white summer dress, looking at me while I uncorked the wine, some midrange bottle of cabernet. Pure love in her eyes. 

Her face and the setting were enhanced, almost dazzling. More radiant, somehow. 

Like a filter over us. On a blue blanket on the sloping grass under the big oak tree, no world on the periphery outside, only brightness. 

Everything seemed to glimmer, especially her. 

And then the sound brought me back. That same groan. Aching, and foreboding.

Fuck it, I thought. It was time to stop being a pussy.

She'd have wanted me to be brave.

Might as well try.

I got out of bed and skipped getting dressed. Whatever it was, pants probably wouldn't make the difference. And I didn't have much time.

The bedroom door creaked as I opened it slow and stepped outside. The lightbulb in the hall was low wattage and exposed and it was a soft yellow haze in the air that barely reached me.

How I moved from there was let's say on the apprehensive side.

The groaning grew louder—but it wasn't coming from the duct.

Strangely, it was coming from the kitchen. And with the benefit of proximity, there was no way it was the pipes. Whatever was producing that sound, it had to have a mouth.

Tentatively, I peered inside. 

At that moment I would've happily exchanged what I saw for a ghost. Funny that. How one expectation, no matter how awful, can still bait and switch you. 

When I turned, there seated at the small table by the wall, it was me.  

How I was the night after she died. 

His head was in his hands, and he was convulsing and groaning and moaning with such an energy that must admit it felt almost embarrassing as I absorbed the image—which wasn’t easy. Lasted just a flash, though. The sheer impossibility of whatever the fuck was going on quickly snapped things back to reality, which reality was rapidly feeling more unreal.

I didn't notice that I'd stopped breathing. 

When I finally breathed in, it was something like a gasp. And it was loud enough to hear.

The other me clearly noticed, and slowly looked up. We locked eyes in a moment utterly pregnant with trepidation, before finally, I saw recognition in his eyes.

And then, suddenly, it became malice.

Immediately he threw the table aside and lunged forward and I barely had a chance to back away before I sprinted desperate down the hall. And he was far less than human as he crashed out from the kitchen so fast that he smashed to the other side—but it didn't slow him down.

As I turned closing the door I saw his face brutally twisted with bloodshot eyes and hands outstretched, roaring my way like a wounded wild beast.

I locked the door and scrambled backwards to the bed. In a second he was there, banging with such loudness and force that his fist soon broke through and splinters of wood fell to the floor.

I could see his fevered face through the crack. His malice had turned to fury.

It was more than clear, what he wanted.

Nothing good.

His blooded hand thrust a clawed shadow through a dim slither of light, and held; only just realising, apparently, that the gap wasn't enough for his body to pass. 

And so he groaned, once again. Loudly, then quietly, then not at all.

Three minutes must have passed. 

He vanished entirely, and the door was instantly restored.

Like he was never there.

Which after staring at empty space for who knows how long, is what I managed to convince myself of. Just long enough, thankfully, that I could go back to sleep.

The room then fell beneath into some other place. 

Passing frames of convoluted scenes too short-lived to make sense. 

Then a brief picture of the past in her beautiful face, and only her face, that I couldn't hold on to.

And then I was back in the park. 

But it wasn't the same. What radiance had been, was gone.

It was just me, on a blanket then grey, on a slope surrounded by grass a darker shade of grey, under the big oak tree swaying serene in a light breeze.

And she wasn't anywhere to be seen.

Maybe it was relief that I felt, and it was painful, but such is the case for the past. 

When I looked up, the sky was deep cerulean blue.

And the sun was brighter than it had ever been.
