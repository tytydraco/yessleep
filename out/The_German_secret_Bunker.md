For clarification, this story is 100% true, and it's not fake. 

One day, I went with my dog into a German forest but then noticed something I had never seen before in all these years. It was a pipe coming out of the ground. That didn't make much sense because the forest was far away from civilization. Well, I explored the pipe and the surroundings, and guess what? I found what I needed – a very small metal door in a hill that led to a bunker. The door was completely closed, and there was no way in, so I searched a bit more around the pipe. And there it was – a very small hatch on the ground, cleverly covered with fake plastic leaves. I tied my dog to a tree and tried opening the hatch, and with a bit of strength, it finally opened. There was a ladder leading into the absolute darkness.

Everything was quite down there...

For a moment, I thought about going back up because I had a bad feeling, but curiosity convinced me to go further. It was very weird to be there, and I couldn't see much because I used the light from my smartphone. I found some doors that said "Labor," which means "laboratory" in English. Also, I found two locked doors with "Gefahr" written on them, which means "danger." On one of the doors, there was even a sign saying "please don't remove the files." It was very strange, but then I accidentally touched a button with my hand, and suddenly, everything went very loud. All the machines made noise, and the lights flickered on and off. To be honest, I thought it was cool, and in that moment, I even saw stairs leading down to another floor, but then I heard other weird sounds – steps running towards me. I wouldn't say it was an animal because you could hear shoes walking on the metal ground. I panicked and tried to escape as fast as I could. I ran to the hatch and climbed it. Surprisingly, the steps completely stopped as soon as I was out of the bunker. I released my dog from the tree and wanted to close the hatch again. But... The moment I touched the hatch, I heard someone climbing the ladder, but not at a humanly possible speed. No human could climb that fast. I closed the door and ran as quickly as I could with my dog back home because it was already night.

Later, I called the police and told them about the situation. They informed me that there are no bunkers in that forest. They asked around, and after a while, they told me that there had never been a bunker in that specific forest. One week later, I went into the forest again, and everything had disappeared. The pipe, the door, the hatch – everything was gone as if it never existed. To this day, I'm still traumatized, and I can't comprehend how that was possible.

And no, I don't want to disclose which forest it was or its location. But I think Germans will recognize the forest due to its size and large hills. However, please never go to such a forest, and please don't search for bunkers!

If you have questions ask me pls. And yes I have pictures of this but I can’t post it here.
