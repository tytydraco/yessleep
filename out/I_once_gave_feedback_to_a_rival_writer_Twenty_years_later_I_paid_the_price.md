I woke in a well-lit basement covered in wall to wall inspirational quotes. Literally every surface was filled with them. Most were posters, but some of the words were simply written in sharpie, filling in the gaps where nothing else would fit.

*“We are all apprentices in a craft where no one ever becomes a master.” - Ernest Hemingway*

*“When your story is ready for rewrite, cut it to the bone.” - Stephen King*

“Good stuff,” said a voice that I almost recognized. Then I turned around and saw him. It had been maybe two decades, but he looked basically the same, just a pound or two pudgier.

“Anthony McCann?”

“So the great Elliot White actually recognizes me after all these years,” he said, a little too impressed with himself. “I guess I shouldn’t be surprised. After all, you did say my story had promise.”

I tried to get up from the chair I was sitting in and realized my hands and feet were ziptied in place. The more I writhed, the tighter my bonds became.

“I said what now?” I asked, trying not to betray my growing sense of panic.

Anthony grimaced now, then raced to his laptop, pulling up a scanned image of a marked-up manuscript with a few of my handwritten notes on it. He held it up to my face so that I could read it. At the end was a short handwritten paragraph:

*Dear Anthony,*

*I think this shows a lot of promise. Joel is a character I definitely haven’t seen before, and Susan sounds like someone I’d maybe want to date if she were a little older. That said, I think this needs another draft or two to get ‘there.’ You might think about adding some details that makes Joel a little more likable. Right now he comes off as kind of a stalker, which I’m sure wasn’t your intention. I’m not saying he has to save a cat from a tree or something. Just a little self-awareness would help. I also circled a bunch of typos. Might want to run spell-check next time before you submit.*

*Peace out,*

*Elliot*

I remembered the story now. I’d read it during the undergrad workshop we had together junior year. The piece was clearly autobiographical, even more thinly disguised than usual. To say the protagonist was a predator would have been an understatement.

“For a long time, I let it sit in a drawer, you know,” he said. “I might have given up on it. And then I saw your first book out at Barnes & Noble. Of course I bought a copy. You’re welcome by the way. Can I be honest? I’d give it a B+. Good for a first novel, I guess. Probably could have used another draft.”

“It’s not my favorite either,” I admitted. “But that was fifteen years ago. I’d like to think I got better.”

Anthony made a face. Then he absentmindedly pulled a sword from where it had been resting against the wall. He started doing some kind of bizarre martial arts move, possibly to intimidate me. In a way, they worked. I could imagine that sword going right through me. It was probably the kind of replica you’d buy at a mall, but I was sure it would still get the job done.

“Well, *The Mermaid and the Pelican* was definitely better,” he said. “Honestly, very few notes on that. I can see why it won all those prizes. I just have a few line-edits, but overall, A-minus. Maybe even an A. Of course, you followed that up with *The Kitchen Sink Gang,* which even you have to admit was total garbage. I figured you needed the paycheck. Still, embarrassing, right?”

“Anthony, what’s the point of all this?”

“The point!” he shouted. “The point is that I took your advice! About ten years ago, I got back to writing. Well, revising to be more accurate. I took your notes on my story to see if I could make it any better. I was like Oscar Wilde, adding a word in the morning, deleting it by sundown. Or at least, that’s what I thought. I sent it out to a dozen magazines, and you know what? All rejections. If I heard back at all.”

“It’s a tough business,” I said, trying to wriggle my wrists. The only result was that one began to bleed, the bonds tightening even more.

“It’s subjective,” he said. “That was the problem. But see, I’m a data scientist by trade. In my old position, I ran A/B tests for a game company. Group A would get one version. Then Group B would get something else with a few changes. Maybe a different color scheme or a different title. Maybe a different difficulty level.”

He paced around the room, gesticulating wildly as he spoke.

“So my scientist brain goes, aha! Maybe we can use that same methodology on a story. With enough trial and error, maybe it could even be the *perfect* story. Are you following?”

“I’m trying.”

He sighed, rubbing his eyes. Then he slammed his sword into the floor, where it stuck fast.

“What I’m saying is, while you were out there releasing basically unfinished drafts of your shitty novels, I’ve been here polishing. I revise, and then I run a test. I put two versions of the story up on social media then pay a nominal fee to display it to readers. I get maybe a thousand eyes on each version. Then, through some proprietary software of my own invention, I can tell just how far each reader got. Did they make it to the end? Get bored after the first paragraph? And of course, the ultimate question: which version did they like better?”

“It sounds impressive,” I said. “How did it go?”

“Well, you’re going to tell me,” he said. “You see, for the first twenty-two versions of the story, I saw fairly steady improvement. Then the next ten showed only minor upticks, sometimes even downward movement. Finally, over the last five versions it’s steadied out. My edits are down to one word here, another there. And it’s my scientific belief that it’s now the best story it can possibly be. Of course, as the author I can’t count on myself for an unbiased opinion. For that, I need a professional.”

“You want me to read your story?”

He nodded.

“As I said, I’m a scientist. All I want is your unbiased opinion. After that, you’ll be released unharmed. One thing though. Lie to me, and you’ll endanger the entire experiment, undoing over a decade of work. Lie to me, and I will kill you in an extremely unpleasant way.”

“Give me the story,” I said.

Ever so carefully, he approached me with a pair of scissors. For a second he hesitated, as if considering jabbing me in the throat. Then he snipped free my left wrist and quickly backed away, tossing a stapled printout of the story at me from a safe distance.

The story wasn’t long, maybe four thousand words. It had been over twenty years since I read the original, but the gist was still the same: Joel, a college senior, thinks of himself as a romantic idealist and tries to convince Susan, a high school sophomore to run off with him to Mexico, “where they can get married and live out their days on the beach, surrounded by an army of beautiful children.” The whole thing was pretty vomit-inducing.

I tried not to show any reaction as I finished the last word.

“Well?” he asked.

“It’s definitely a big improvement,” I said. “The flow is much better.”

“What about the part with the yellow roses? That was new. Did you understand the symbolism?”

“I don’t always get everything.”

“Of course not. There’s actually a *lot* of symbolism in here. I have some diagrams. But that’s beside the point. You liked it?”

“Yes,” I said, praying he wouldn’t see through me. “It’s hard hitting. The emotional effect is extraordinary. Just like all great writing should be.”

And in a way, it was true. The story truly was terrifying. If I’d seen it from a competent colleague, I might have even marveled at the way he captured its unhinged protagonist.

But in a deeper way, the story was shit. It had always been shit. It would always be shit. And what he’d been doing for the last decade was polishing shit.

And if I hadn’t been afraid for my life, I might have told him my real advice: to give up on it. This story was for practice. Maybe the next one would be better, and then the next one after that. Maybe he’d need to write ten thousand pages, and then finally, on the ten-thousand and first page, he’d actually produce something good.

That wasn’t to say revisions were worthless. Usually, they helped. You could go from okay to good. Even good to great. But sometimes, you just had a fucking trash fire, and no amount of fiddling with the garbage was going to save it.

“Extraordinary,” he muttered to himself, walking over and grabbing his sword. “Extraordinary.” Has I said the wrong thing? I imagined all the places where he might plunge the blade. Was he the sort of man who’d kill me quickly, slashing my throat or burying the steel in my ribcage? Or was he the cruel kind who’d want me to suffer, slicing open my stomach, watching me bleed out slowly.

“Anthony,” I said, ready to beg. “What I meant was–”

Then he clapped his hands and smiled.

He got out a sharpie and wrote on his wall, “The emotional effect is extraordinary, just like all great writing should be. -Elliot White”

“Promise you were telling the truth?” he asked one last time.

“Promise.”

“Then the next time you’ll be reading this is in my bestselling collection of short stories,” he said. “Once I write the rest of the collection, of course. For now though, I’ll release you to your drivel. Good luck trying to hit number one on the bestseller list again. You’re going to need it.”

I woke up in a wooded area behind a rest stop several states away from home. After a little explaining, the cops came to take me home. I tried to tell them everything I knew about Anthony, but they never did track him down. Maybe they didn’t really believe me.

After I got home, I took a week to just drink, take baths, and try to get my head on straight. It was even longer before I sat at a keyboard again, ready to finish the novel I’d been working on.

Yet when I actually started writing, I felt light. Free. Usually, I grind out fifteen hundred words a day, methodically laying one sentence in front of another until I hit word count. Now, it was like some untapped geyser in my head had begun to spew paragraphs one after another. I looked up after a week and found that the entire book was done.

When I told my agent it was ready, she told me her usual congratulations. Then she offered to give me a few more days to polish it up before she took a look.

“Okay,” I said after considering for a few moments. [“But just for one more day.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)
