Before my cardiac arrest, I was a bad person — a really bad person. I stole, cheated, and hurt many people. There are dozens of innocents I traumatized for a lifetime. My near-death experience changed me for the better, but it didn’t change the past.

I can’t recall much from when I died. It’s like looking at a fish just below the surface, you can’t clearly make it out but you can see the outline, and if you look just right, you’ll see it all — even if just for a moment. There was fire and brimstone, and an entity cloaked in shadows whispering words I couldn’t understand. Those visions have never left me.

At the end of my first week in the hospital I lay in a cold bed pondering my life. As I fell into a disturbed slumber, a loud scratch echoed across the room. A frightened gasp escaped my lips. Just outside the window, a dark figure loomed. It was pawing at the glass with dirty fingers.

I slunk halfway underneath my covers. Whirring machines monitoring my vitals beeped quietly.

*Tap. Tap. Tap*

Its slimy hands slapped the windowpane. They slid down, leaving greasy stains. I could feel its hatred radiating through the reflection. Then it cupped its hands together and peered into the room.

I looked on in horror. *My* face stared back at me. There was one glaring difference, its eyes were deep pits of black — my blue irises swallows by the darkness. A crooked smile crossed its face and it disappeared into the night.

I didn’t sleep a wink that night. At one point I started screaming uncontrollably. Nurses rushed in and sedated with me a large needle. I saw it again in my dreams, but it was no longer smiling.

For three months I remained in the hospital. The rehab was as excruciating and it was monotonous, but eventually, I was back on my feet. Throughout my time at the hospital, there were no other sightings of my ghastly doppelgänger. I convinced myself it was all a hallucination.

On the first night home, I bought a nice bottle of wine and celebrated with a few glasses. I hadn’t touched a drop of alcohol since the accident, so it took almost nothing to get me drunk. Parked in front of the TV, I let the warm glow of inebriation wash over me.

“You left me all alone down there…” a garbled voice awake me from a drunken slumber.

The other me stood in the doorway of my living room. It glared with devious intent.

“You deserve to suffer with me. This pain is too much to bear. I will drag you into the darkness like the dog you are — *we* are.”

It took a ragged step toward me. Ash billowed in its wake. I jumped from the couch and yelled, “You’re not real,” until my throat became hoarse.

“Oh, but *we* are real. If I think, therefore I am. I’m in agony, therefore I am.” It responded flatly.

I fled into my bedroom and slammed the door shut. After propping a chair against the doorknob, I crumpled into the corner sobbing.

“You can’t hide from yourself. Not for long.” Footsteps receded down the hall. I was left alone with my cries.

For weeks, I remained locked in my room, only leaving to grab food deliveries from my doorstep. At night wicked laughter would float through the house, but the other me stayed hidden. By the end of the month, even the laughter disappeared. Once again, I started to believe it was all in my head; the near-death experience having altered my brain chemistry.

Sunshine streamed through my blinds and I felt happy again. The fear dissipated like smoke on a windy day. I ventured into the world and felt a semblance of normalcy return. How short-lived that was.

I’d called up an old friend, a reformed criminal now involved in youth mentorship. We met at a trendy restaurant just after 7 pm and sat in a corner booth. After exchanging pleasantries, he said something that my blood run cold.

“By the way, this is the craziest thing. There’s a guy sitting on the other side of the restaurant who looks exactly like you. If I hadn’t known better I would have thought it was your twin.”

“What….who? Point him out for me?” My voice trembled.

“The guy wearing the sunglasses. Right there.” I followed his finger.

The man waved menacingly as my line of sight met his. A lump grew in my throat. I immediately excused myself and practically ran from the table. My look-alike followed.

I bolted into traffic in an attempt to lose him but to no avail. He was hot on my tail and a foul stench filled the air. Careening into an alley, I ran into a dead end. A barbed wire fence blocked my path forward.

“I won’t go back without you. We will share this eternal torment.”

“I won’t go. There’s no fucking way. If you’re really me, why do you want to see me suffer so badly?”

“You are already suffering….”

I backed into the fence. My hellish twin advanced. As I looked for a way out, my door brushed against a long, metal pipe — left over from a long-abandoned construction project. In a single fluid motion, I bent down, picked up the blunt instrument, and cracked it into his skull. His head exploded in a shower of blood and smoke and he crumpled to the ground.

Flames engulfed him. Smoke twirled in the air, twisting into a rapidly oscillating tornado. My mouth was forced open as the smoke was driven into my gullet.

I fell to my knees. Unbearable pain paralyzed me. Every atom in my body felt like it was being pulled apart at the seams. I began to black out, but the agony never dimmed.

I awoke in a hospital, strapped to the bed. The pain had gotten worse. I wasn’t dead, but I wasn’t living either. Eventually, they moved me to a long-term rehab facility, unable to diagnose a specific issue — but I’d knew I’d never leave.

Typing out my story took months. Each keystroke was like a bullet to my fingers. I'd only last a few minutes before passing out from the excruciating pain.
