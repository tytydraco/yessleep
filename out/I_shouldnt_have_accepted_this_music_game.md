I recently moved to this new apartment downtown with my mom, just the two of us. Mom sold the house because she said it felt "too empty" without Dad there. Moving was a way to escape from all the memories that have become so bittersweet. She got a new job, I went to a new school, and she even replaced her mattress and all the sheets so she wouldn't have to sleep next to that big dent he left in the bed just reminding her how 'not here' he is. She moved all of his stuff into a storage thing we're renting just so we wouldn't have to see it, but I snuck a couple of his things to my room. None of this is really super relevant, but it's context or something, I guess. Ever since we moved, I've been having really creepy encounters that I can't fully explain.



The head of my bed has to be by the window which, I know, is bad Feng Shui or whatever, but it doesn't really fit anywhere else in the room comfortably. A few weeks ago when I was trying to sleep, I heard a quiet knocking at my window. It went to that tune everyone knows, the "Shave-and-a-haircut" thing? That. I thought it was like some bird or something and just ignored it, but after a few minutes, it happened again, louder this time. It was unmistakable. Our apartment is a few floors up, so it couldn't have been anyone *actually* knocking on my window unless some weirdo with a ladder thought it was a great night to prank some random girl.



Anyway, I tried ignoring the knocking again, hoping it was just a tree scratching the window, but it happened again. *Rat ta-ta-tat tat...* It almost felt like whatever it was was waiting for me to respond, to finish the line, so I reached up and knocked on the window. I heard a rustling and then everything was quiet for a few minutes, so I thought I had scared away whatever animal was scratching or whatever it was, but then I heard the *whistling*. It was the start of the tune to "*Row, Row, Row Your Boat*", that we all learn in kindergarten. I felt my heart stop and was completely frozen. It took a few seconds, but the whistling repeated. I hesitantly whistled back the "*Gently down the stream*", and there was another rustling followed by silence. It stayed quiet for the rest of the night, so I managed to sleep.



I was headed to school the morning after my little call-and-response game at the window, and on the way to my car, I looked around the apartment building to see if there might've been a bird's nest by my window; maybe it was just a bird singing in the night. There wasn't even a tree. At least, there wasn't one that reached our room. It felt like my whole body went cold, but I just decided it was all a dream or some weird effect of sleep deprivation making me hear things.



I didn't have another event for a couple of days and had managed to forget about the whole thing until I was getting ready for bed, and as I pulled on my sleep shirt featuring the logo of one of my favorite bands, I heard the knocking again. *Rat ta-ta tat-tat*, just like the first night. My blood ran cold. It wasn't a dream. The knock repeated, just as it had the first night, and paused. Waited. Waited for my response. I knocked back, holding my breath. Again, there was a rustling and a moment of quiet, so I got into bed, sitting cross-legged and facing the window so we could play our little game again. Then came the whistling. A different tune this time. It was "*Ring around the rosy*" this time. Then it waited. Waited for me to finish the song.



"Who are you?" I asked, my throat completely dry. "If you're some creep watching me change, then get out of here!" I hissed, not wanting to wake my mom.



It only whistled in response. I was listening to the whistling more clearly now than the first night. It sounded human, but something about it didn’t sound right. I felt sick to my stomach. I pulled at the blinds and peered through the window, my hands shaking, but saw nothing. I was reaching to open the window when another knock made my whole body flinch. Not a rhythm this time, just a single knock. It sounded *angry*. I shakily whistled back the rest of the tune, and that seemed to satisfy it. Once more, a rustle, then silence.



A couple of weeks went by with no additional encounters. I even got my psychiatrist to put me on some anti-psychotics, hoping that would rid me of the problem forever. Naturally, I was wrong. One night, I was tossing and turning, unable to sleep, and I heard it. *Rat ta-ta-tat tat*. I was starting to get used to the routine by the third time, so I knocked back before it had a chance to repeat itself.



There was less of a pause this time before it started whistling. It took me a second because this time, it wasn't just the normal kindergarten song that everyone knows. I didn't recognize it at first, but my eyes fell on my dad's old music box he used to play for me every night before bed. I don't remember the name of the song it plays, but I carefully started winding it as the whistling stopped. As the soft music started playing, I felt my stomach turn. So many memories came flooding back all at once, I felt almost seasick. The thing seemed satisfied, regardless, so I put the box back down and waited. Instead of a whistle, I heard another music box. It was so unnatural, it sort of sounded like a recording of a different music box or like how a parrot might mimic a music box. It played the first bit of “*The Wheels On The Bus*”, then waited. I hesitantly whistled in response, which satisfied it enough to rustle and go silent.



A couple of nights ago, I was having trouble sleeping because I couldn't stop thinking about my dad, so I tried listening to the music box he left me. I wound it a couple of times, but for some reason, it wouldn't play. I guess maybe when I played it again after not playing it for so long, it must've broken somehow. I'm pretty sure I've heard about that happening, or someone told me about it when I got the music box in the will.



Last night, it came back. I was almost expecting it this time, I hardly even flinched at the first knock. It was undeniably really creepy, but I was starting to think maybe it wasn’t so bad. All it did was occasionally quiz me on children’s songs. I returned its knock within a few seconds, then waited for the whistling or the music box. This time, it started playing “*Twinkle Twinkle Little Star*” on the music box, so I finished the phrase with a whistle. I waited, but it only played the same tune again. I repeated my whistling, confused. There was a single knock on the window, then it played again. It took me a second, but I remembered that “*Twinkle Twinkle Little Star*” and the ABCs have the same tune. Did that have something to do with it?



“It’s ‘*Twinkle Twinkle Little Star*, ’ right?” I whispered. It only replayed the song in response. I took a second, cleared my throat, and quietly sang, “How I wonder what you are.”



Everything went quiet for a moment. Everything was still.



“Thank you for playing with me.” I heard it say in my voice. It was the first time I heard the thing speak, and it sounded *exactly like me*. I tried so hard to scream, but I couldn't make a sound.
