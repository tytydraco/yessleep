I was feeling really nostalgic so I bought some pogs on Facebook marketplace. It wasn't a sealed pack or anything like that, it was just a random assortment.

I was checking them out later on, seeing all my nostalgic favorites like Pure Poison and eightballs of various types when I noticed one I'd never seen before. It was this grinning school bully-looking kind of guy wearing a jean jacket. He looked like it was straight out of some cheesy sitcom or old movie for kids. Like Biff from Back to the Future.  It was so 90s, that was the time of my childhood and I love this stuff. Mementos from a dead culture... I put it in my pocket and then went out to get some dinner. 

Here's where things start to get weird. I went to my local pizza place to get a steak sub. I love doing that on Friday nights.  While I was eating the sub, I pulled out the pog to look at it, and the bully-looking guy was frowning now!  I mean am I really over thinking an old pog? I put it back in my pocket thinking that maybe I just didn't take a close enough look at it before when I first found it. 

Later that night I'm brushing my teeth, changing my clothes. I took my wallet out of my pants and the pog came out and flipped onto the floor.  I picked it up and wow, the bully guy is really looking angry now. He's frowning, his eyebrows are all slanted down. He seems somehow a little more extreme than he did before. This is some weird stuff. My hand is starting to feel cold, I mean wtf right? This is a piece of paper from the 90s, I can't let this thing put me on a head trip. I took the pog outside and threw it in the trash can. All is well, right?  No not really, that night I have a crazy dream with the bully guy chasing me through the hallways of this random school, telling me he's going to take my lunch money and stuff me in a locker, and as corney as that sounds, and even though I'm an adult and haven't even been in school for about 18 years... In my dream it is literally terrifying! I'm at this guy's mercy and it's awful!  

I woke up to the sound of the garbage truck picking up my trash. The mechanical arm of the truck picked up the can and shook it upside down so the trash would fall into the truck, roughly setting it back down in the road when it was done. I put on some clothes to go outside and bring it in from the street and while I was out there I saw that some of my trash had missed the truck and fallen on the ground. I'm out there picking it up, I'm a good neighbor, no one else is going to do it, and wow, what were the odds of this? The pog is out there face down on the ground. Curiosity is getting to me, like what is the face going to look like now?  The sun is shining. I'm an adult man. I might be having a mid life nostalgia fueled crisis but what do I have to worry about? It's a 30 year old piece of paper made for kids right?  

I picked it up, flipped it over, the bully is scowling, he looks basically the same as last night, but then I notice there's some writing going in a circle around the perimeter, was that really there the whole time?  It's a little hard to read, it's small text and the color doesn't show up well on top of the graphics but I can see it well in the sunlight. It says "You're mine now chump!". I threw it back on the ground and tried to go about my day, but you guessed it, that night I've got that dream again. I'm running around a school being chased by that bully, I feel so vulnerable, when it's happening I really feel like I'm there, I can't tell it's a dream, and the fear is so palpable!  I'm running through an empty class room but I don't feel like me, you know? My arms and legs are all spindly and it's like I'm in the body of a scrawny young kid! Even though I'm in the school, it's nighttime out and no one is there but me and the bully. The bully is yelling stuff out like "come on out chump!" and it's all I can do to stay one step ahead to keep running and hide from him.

My nerves are shot, when you wake up after a nightmare you aren't well rested. When you wake up after two nights of nightmares, it's just torture. I'm looking for my matches right now. It's the only thing I can think of to do. I've got to destroy this pog today or I feel like something real bad is about to happen.
