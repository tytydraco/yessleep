“***Arise, young one, your presence is needed***.”

“Wha-“, I jolted upwards in bed, letting out a gasp that was more like a breath of air being sucked down.

I woke up twenty minutes later than usual. Most days, I’m already out of bed before my alarm even goes off, but today was different—*I was just exhausted*.

“Great,” I groaned, fumbling to silence the alarm that had been blaring for God knows how long.

I dragged myself out of bed, starting my morning ritual—the same routine I’ve followed almost every day for over a decade now: shit, shower, shave, coffee. As I was getting dressed for work, my phone *buzzed* with a text from my supervisor, Trevor.

“*Meet*.”

That was it—just one word, as vague as ever. But I knew better than to expect anything good from it. The last time I’d received one of Trevor’s cryptic “*meet*” messages, it had led to a tirade of a staff meeting about supposed missed deadlines caused by ‘*recent budget cuts’*. He tore into us hard, and the silence afterward was deafening. I’d felt like a failure that day—until Amanda, one of the chief financial officers and a work friend, quietly reassured me that we’d been ahead of schedule.

Still, Trevor’s tirade left a sour taste.  So much so, I stopped trusting him.

As I headed out the door, another text came in—this time from my wife, Brenna:

“*Good morning, sleepyhead! Had to leave early :( Things are crazy at the hospital rn. Thinking of grabbing steak tonight at Billy’s. You in*?”

I smiled at her message; the thought of a date night lifted my spirits. Maybe today won’t be so bad after all.

“*Sounds like a date ;) Good morning to you too. I love you and can’t wait to see you later*,” I replied before starting my car.

As my engine warmed up, I took a sip of my coffee, enjoying the rare sunshine peeking through the grey Midwest sky. The weather around here is usually bleak—overcast skies, freezing temperatures, and constant rain, the usual. But today, the sunshine felt like a gift. With good weather appearing imminent, a steak dinner date tonight, and Brenna’s beautiful face on my mind, I let myself believe.

*Nothing could ruin this, not even Trevor.*

I pulled out of the driveway and heard a *ding* notification ring from my phone. I presumed it was Brenna replying.

The drive to work, as usual, was long and uneventful—thirty-five minutes of alternating between civilization and isolation. The first ten minutes took me through Fredtown, the town in which I resided. The remaining twenty-five minutes were spent on a winding road cutting through the dense wilderness, with nothing but pine trees and silence for company.

Fredtown itself was... ‘*unique*’. The city was dominated by federal employees—military personnel, high-level researchers, and even agents from organizations we couldn’t even begin to guess. Crime here was laughably low too. The common running joke amongst townspeople was that jaywalking could land you in federal prison.

I made my way to the edge of town before continuing onward into the scenic part of my drive. Though beautiful, the forest had an eerie quality, especially at night here. Maybe it was just my nerves, but I always felt like something was watching me the closer I got to work.

As I approached my destination, the forest opened up, revealing the sprawling field that housed the facility. The plant stretched out about a mile or two in radius, a fortress of steel and concrete amidst the trees. I parked in my usual spot several rows back from the electrified fence that guarded this place.

This wasn’t just your *ordinary power grid*—it was the *centerpiece* of our nation’s push for groundbreaking energy solutions. From solar to experimental technologies, it has many of the revolutionary changes that you have seen within the last thirty to forty years. Everything was being developed here under the watchful eye of the Department of Energy. It was my job to oversee research and administration, but even after a decade, I still didn’t fully understand this place.

Sure, I followed orders, studied data, and ran tests they assigned me, but the bigger picture was more complicated than that. My most recent project now, for example, involved designing containment protocols for massive surges of electrical power. On the surface, it seemed practical—preventing equipment damage or accidents from occurring. But when I dug into the specifics, I realized the scale of it was absurd: the system they wanted could handle a surge powerful enough to supply energy to the entire state of California *for three million years*.

Not only was it impossible for any known capable technology we currently had to prevent that kind of surge all at once, but they *specifically* wanted it for this site.

It also seems the more I try to dig, the more I find that I cannot even access the needed information due to insufficient levels of clearance. This was concerning as I was only one position down from the Head Supervisor of this sight. All of it didn’t add up and it seems they are willing to pay us for our ignorance\*. And our ignorance they have\*.

For a moment, I sat there, letting the engine idle as I prepared mentally for my day. That’s when I remembered the text I’d received earlier. I fished my phone out of the center console, and I unlocked it. What had felt like the start of a promising day evaporated the second I saw the message. *It wasn’t Brenna*.

*The sender was an unknown number*.

“*They have escaped, you must find me*.”

My stomach dropped. Just as I was trying to process what I’d seen, another line popped up on the screen:

“*Before they kill us all*.”

Confusion joined the fear now gripping me. *What the actual fuck did I just read*?

For a few seconds, I couldn’t think straight. Was this some kind of prank? A sick joke from one of my coworkers? If it was, they’d picked the worst possible day for it.

But... what if it wasn’t a joke? And what did they mean by '*kill'*? This was a power grid, not some black-site facility. Sure, the place had its mysteries, but nothing about it screamed *serious danger*.

I shook my head, trying to rationalize it. *It’s just a prank*, I told myself, though the creeping unease of the ominous message lingered. I sat there for another minute, collecting myself once more. I glanced into the rearview mirror to adjust my hair and wipe the sweat from my face…

Something caught my eye.

*A figure*—just beyond the tree line.

I quickly snapped my head in that direction, but whatever it was... *it was gone*.

“What the-?” I mouthed looking around me now to see if there was anything else.

*What was that*? My eyes darted back to the same spot in the tree line. *Am I losing it*? I tried to rationalize what I’d seen—maybe it was security or an employee taking an ‘*unauthorized smoke break’*. But why would anyone be standing out there, just beyond the perimeter?

I took a deep breath, forcing myself to look composed in the overhead mirror. I reached into my coat pocket and took a quick swig from the flask I kept hidden. Confidence in liquid form, though it didn’t do much to calm the growing knot in my stomach. I set it in my glove compartment, as they canister only had a bit left.

As I stepped out of the car, my paranoia only intensified. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was... *wrong*.

In the reflection of my car’s side mirror, I noticed something in my peripheral view. *The figure*. This time, it stood a row back in the parking lot, still as a statue. I froze, pretending not to notice. My eyes flicked to the mirror again, trying to make out any details—but just like before, it vanished.

My heart was now beating out my chest. Every instinct screamed at me to get back in the car and drive far, far away, but I forced myself to stay calm. If anyone else saw me like this, they’d think I was high, crazy, or both.

I walked toward the facility, trying my best to act normal. My eyes darted to the mirrors of parked cars as I moved through the lot, scanning for any sign of the figure. And just like before, it only was visible in the corners of my vision.

It wasn’t following me in a conventional way either. At one glance, it was a few rows back. With another glance, it was closer—*just one row away*. Each time I looked directly at it, it was gone. For what felt like an eternity, I played this game of cat and mouse. By the time I was only twenty or so feet away from the gate, my nerves were completely shot.

Relief washed over me as I approached the entrance of the facility’s gate, the sight of armed guards offered some small measure of comfort. Randy, the old but good-natured security guard, waved me over with his usual easy smile. Randy and I were close, and I always made sure to start a conversation with him anytime I could. Today, however, I wanted to get inside as quickly as possible. I tried my best to keep up the performance.

“Hey there, boss man,” he greeted, though his expression shifted to mild concern as he noticed my uneasy demeanor. “You alright? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I hesitated, debating whether to tell him. But what could I say? *I think I’m being stalked by a shadowy figure that doesn’t move when I look at it. Yeah, right*. Instead, I forced a weak smile and deflected. “Just some stuff at home with Brenna. Nothing I can’t handle.”

“Ah, good ole’ marriage drama. I get it,” Randy chuckled, “Just so you know, though—if I find out you’re giving her a hard time, I’ll bury your ass six feet under.” He grinned, his laugh easing some of the tension.

I smiled back, but my unwavering feeling of unease lingered.

I handed Randy my work ID, but I noticed the figure from earlier was gone. *Where did it disappear to now*? The security gate and its surroundings are generally an open area, intentionally that way too. It was only about twenty feet behind me from when I last saw him…

“You sure you alright there, boss?” Randy looked up after handing me my ID back to see me glancing back to the parking lot.

“…Yeah,” I finally spoke after a minute of gathering myself.

I waited for the gates to buzz open. As they did and I walked in, the sense of safety replaced the dread that I was feeling, knowing I would be fine in the facility. As the gate closed behind me, I glanced back one more time and saw movement from the tree line again. It had almost looked like--well maybe the fear was getting to me, but it almost looked like I could see a *couple more figures* in the tree line, sitting there before walking back and fading into the forest.

I made my way to the nearest security station, home to what we liked to call our "*finest*." I explained to them what I’d seen. The desk guard leaned back in his chair, unimpressed, and replied in a condescending tone, “We’ll send someone to check it out. Probably just a homeless guy or a junkie trying to camp out.”

I even showed them the messages I had received.

They reassured me nothing real would happen as, “*No one was dumb enough to try and attack federally protected property on U.S. soil, especially when it housed military personnel*”

Translation: *They won’t do anything anytime soon—if at all*.

Still, I had no better options. I wasn’t in immediate danger and my priority was to get to work. I left the security station, entered the main administrative building, and headed straight for my office.

**NEW MESSAGE ALERT**

To: ------------------------------

Time: 8:34 AM CT

*Good afternoon, Mr. (REDACTED), you have a scheduled meeting with Mr. Trevor (REDACTED) at 10:30 AM CT in Conference Room C. Please be advised: attendance at this meeting is mandatory and of high priority.*

*THIS MESSAGE IS AN AUTOMATED RESPONSE.*

The email glared across my laptop screen. I stared at it, distracted by the morning’s events playing over and over in my head like a broken record.

*No one else saw anything—not even Randy*, I thought.

I resolved to focus on work. I logged into the system and began my work: three daily safety checks of the entire grid. On a normal day, all sensors read green, signaling everything was running as expected. Occasionally though, a sensor flashed yellow or orange to indicate a minor error, which was logged and addressed by yours truly.

I then noticed sector 7-B was flashing yellow. *Perfect*, I thought. Though annoying, the problem was manageable and quick to resolve.

But then, as if fate had sensed my day wasn’t hard enough, the indicator started flashing red.

Red meant only one thing: *a serious fuck up*. It wasn’t just a problem; *it was my problem*. Red alerts always required immediate on-site attention, and usually, that meant the next twenty-four hours of my life were stuck fixing it.

I groaned, muttering a string of curses under my breath. Any hope of enjoying my night out with Brenna was now gone. I was pissed.

Still, a part of me welcomed the distraction. At least this gave me something worthwhile to focus on instead of the unsettling shit I’d seen earlier.

I left the corporate building and made the short walk over to the massive hangar that housed part of the grid. It was only about ten minutes away, but it felt a lot longer. The campus was sprawling, with four buildings dedicated to the grid and a handful of others for miscellaneous site operations.

When I reached the hangar entrance, I braced myself for what was sure to be an unpleasant encounter. Inside, I found Mike, the lead engineer—or as I often referred to him in my head, *the lead grunt*.

Mike and I didn’t exactly see eye to eye. Our relationship could best be described as… *toxically professional*. Every interaction with him felt like a test from God. He had a habit of pushing back against anything that came from administration—*especially if it came from me*.

The tension between us was fueled by our vastly different backgrounds. Mike was ex-military, a hard-ass with years of experience in various feats of engineering, which included the B-2 (though that was from the rumor mill). He considered my seven years of college a waste of time.

*His favorite line*?

“*You could’ve joined the military, learned everything faster, and fixed your shitty attitude debt free*.”

Technically, as his boss, I could’ve pulled strings to get him fired, but I’d never do it. As much as he annoyed me, Mike was damn good at his job—*one of the best*. Letting him go would’ve been a dumb, emotional move. But that didn’t stop me from occasionally finding ways to get him back, like enrolling him in HR’s behavior management classes.

“Hey, Mike,” I called out, trying to keep my tone normal, “We’ve got a red alert in 7-B.”

He glanced up from whatever he was working on and smirked, “Oh, great. Another problem. What’d you guys do this time?”

*Here we go again*, I thought, already regretting my decision to come here.

“Listen, let’s skip the formalities, you already know I’ll be stuck here for the next twenty-four hours, so don’t go busting my balls here.”

“Relax, don’t get your pretty pink panties in a twist, I already sent a couple of my best down, they’ll be back any minute now.”

Mike paused, a flicker of worry crossing his face before quickly retreating behind his usual demeanor.

“...That was a few minutes ago, and I still haven’t heard a thing,” he finally said, his tone laced with irritation rather than genuine concern.

Mike wasn’t one to care about others either, it seemed, often giving the cold shoulder and even disregarding safety for results. It was something I’d called him out on more times than I could count, but he’d always brushed it off as no big deal.

“I don’t got time for fucking around either, last thing I need is you up my ass even more than it is right now,” he mumbled, as he went back to working on his project.

I bit back my irritation, forcing a neutral tone. “I’m just the messenger, Mike. Let me know what you find when they get back.”

But even as I said it, I was already over it. His constant attitude was grating on me, and I made a mental note to send someone else next time. *Today’s already bad enough without this bullshit*, I thought.

Just as I was walking back to my office to continue on with my day, I heard it—*the sound that marked the beginning of the end.*

Coming from the distance where 7-B was housed, a scream tore through the air, distant but unmistakable. It was *raw, guttural, and filled with such primal terror* that it didn’t even seem human. It froze me in place, my blood running cold. I turned back toward Mike, who was already looking in the direction of Sector 7-B. His expression was unreadable at first, but as the seconds passed, the same fear I was feeling began to creep into his features. He tried to hide it, but it was there, undeniable.

“What the hell?” Mike muttered low and intense.

He took a step forward, then hesitated, his hand clenching into a fist. “I told them not to—” he grumbled angrily, but his words cut off as we both saw it.

Emerging from the direction of Sector 7-B was a person. At first, it was nothing more than a slow-moving silhouette, but then the smell of iron and salt hit my nostrils. I gagged and doubled over at the mere smell of it, causing my stomach to rise into my throat. I caught myself on a workbench as I held back the urge to vomit. *What was that*? The sound of shuffling feet echoed unnervingly and unrhythmic against the cold metal walls. Then, as the figure approached the overhead light that illuminated him, we saw one of the engineers Mike had sent to check the sector appeared…

*At least what was left of him*…

His body was drenched in blood, a gruesome painting of crimson streaks and gore laid out. His left arm was severed cleanly at the shoulder, while his right ended in a jagged stump where his hand should have been, oozing thick, dark fluid. Half of his jaw hung lifeless from one side of his face. Fractured bone and dangling tendons twitched in areas where it had been exposed. Below, he was disemboweled from the sternum down, his innards dragging beneath him. It was coiling around his legs as he staggered forward, nearly tripping on them. His eyes were wide, bloodshot, and glistened with terror, as if he had seen Hell for himself. He staggered forward, driven by sheer will or some desperate instinct to reach safety.

“Holy.. wh-what the fu- wha- ho-” Mike said in a quivering voice.

We just stared at the current reality unraveled before us.

Then, as if flood doors opened, the hangar exploded into chaos. Engineers screamed, scattering like startled birds, while frantic calls for medevac filled the air in the mix. I saw a few sprinting to the nearest Red Phone to place the call.

Mike snapped out of his hypnosis, rushing toward the mangled engineer.

“JESUS FUCKING- BAILEY, we need to get medevac for you, where did the others go?” his voice barely holding together as he looked up and tried calling to the other engineers, “DOES ANYONE SEE THE OTHERS?!”

He whipped around to face me, his expression a mix of terror and urgency.

“Go and get one of the guards, tell them to radio this in and to lock down the hangar” Mike barked to me as I stood there.

His voice broke my trance. I nodded and turned to run, ready to call in a *Code Purple*.

Hangar employees began to creep towards the hallway leading to Sector 7-B, their faces held with dread. A few dared to step in, their movements slow and deliberate, as if trying not to provoke something unseen.

Then a faint sound interrupted us as it drifted from deeper inside Sector 7-B—*whistling*.

But it wasn’t normal. Something was wrong with it. The tune was off, *warped, inhuman*. A haunting, disjointed version of *Yankee Doodle* echoed through the air, its cadence crawling under my skin.

The PA system kicked on with the accompaniment of red-blaring sirens buzzing throughout the place, jump-scaring everyone, including me.

The robotic voice began its repeating message.

“*This is an emergency broadcast alert, please remain calm and find a place of secure shelter. Protocol 999 will be taking place. Do not let anyone into facilities, lock all doors, and close all blinds until the conclusion of this broadcast. If you are outside, seek immediate shelter. This is an emerge*\-”

I turned back to Mike, my heart pounding in my chest. The fear in his eyes mirrored my own. And then the whistling came again—*louder* than before. It was threading its way through the screams, alarms, and the general, frantic chaos around us. The warped *Yankee Doodle* grew closer.

I grabbed Mike’s shoulder, “We need to get out of here!” I shouted, realizing whatever that was, couldn’t be good.

“Bailey is in no shape to move right now!” his voice horse and panic-stricken.

“Mike, we have to go, we can’t take him—*not like this*!”

He hesitated, torn between survival and loyalty. We both knew the truth—*Bailey was beyond saving*. Even if a medevac arrived in time, how could anyone save someone who’d been so gruesomely ripped apart like this?

Mike made his decision. He knelt beside Bailey, whispering something in his ear. I couldn’t hear the words, but I saw his lips tremble. A single tear slid down his face before he noticed me watching. He wiped it away quickly, and then stood and turned to me, his face hardening.

“Let’s go!”

I bolted towards the entrance, Mike close in pursuit. Around us, others fled in a panic, some ahead of us, others trailing behind. The chaos of the hangar spilled out into the open as we ran, but the sound of that unnatural whistling followed us, growing with every step no matter how far we ran in the opposite direction.

We made it to the entrance with no problem. As we did so, we heard more violent screams erupting from behind us. We turned back and saw limbs from various people thrown into the air. In front of us rushed armed security, military personnel, and other trained professionals responding to the incident inside.

Just then Mike turned to me, “Where are we going?”

I had no idea what to do now. To be honest, I thought about just leaving him and booking it towards my car to get the hell out of this place. However, I knew the entrance to get in or out was locked down during *Protocol 999*.

I glanced over to the gate and saw the same scene being played out as it was from behind us.

*There was no escape now*.

“Let’s head to my office” I said.

We had about a couple minutes worth of running, however, our prime years of athletic endurance were far behind us. If only I had just used that six-month membership to our local gym that work had provided for free annually…

Just as it felt like my heart would explode, I spotted somewhere to hide and pointed to Mike to rest there. We hid in the hedges, hoping the thick cover of brush would hide our location from any impending danger.

As I’m writing this, we are still hiding. I tried calling 911 and they told me to sit tight as they tried to contact federal support as they had no jurisdiction on our property. Hopefully, help would get here sooner than later.

I looked up after a moment and noticed Mike sitting there with a thousand-yard stare glued to the nearest rock he saw on the ground. His appearance sunk in sadness, instead of shock like mine. It was something I wasn’t familiar with seeing from him. After all, this guy was made of bricks, physically and emotionally.

Just as I was about to check on him, a piercing scream erupted nearby, cutting through me like a knife. Mike broke his locked gaze and whipped his head toward me. Before either of us could process what to do, more agonizing wails tore through the air behind us—*closer this time*. Ten feet, maybe less.

Then, sickening noises replaced the screams—*tearing flesh, snapping tendons, and the squelch* of something unknown happening nearby. Each sound burrowed into my brain, leaving scars I knew would never heal.

Silence fell hard. Not comforting either—it was heavy with anticipation for what would happen next. My body felt weak, trembling. We sat frozen, wide-eyed and pale. Neither of us spoke, too paralyzed to even form a thought. The bushes weren’t safe. *We had to move*.

I was about to suggest the idea when Mike seemed to make his own decision. Slowly, he leaned forward and parted the dense shrubbery, just enough to peek through. His movements were deliberate, and careful, trying to remain unseen by whatever might be out there. I watched as his expression shifted. At first, it was confusion. Then his face went entirely still, his breath caught, and he moved back while the brush fell back into place.

“What’s wrong?” I whispered just loud enough so he could hear me, but he just sat there.

Concerned I spoke up a little louder.

“Mike... Mike, you gotta talk to me here man. What’s going on out there? Is it that bad?”

Finally, he spoke, his voice eerily calm,

“*They’re watching* [*us*](https://www.reddit.com/r/UrbanUbe/)*"*
