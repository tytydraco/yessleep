My father has always had a thing for believing in UFOs. Ive always use to pick on him for it. He always would say, "Its just cool".

One day, 6 years ago, to be exact! We went to Puerto Rico. My brother had passed away and we were bringing him over to his hometown, to have him buried there since our whole family lives in PR. 

We were never really close until my brother passed away, and it did make him feel guilty about it all. Somehow, he had a change of heart and started to get more closer with the rest of us. We were sitting at my grandmother's and I'm not sure how this subject came up. I guess we were finally sitting down talking about stuff and him asking me questions. 

He tells me he wants to tell me something, but he doesn't want me to tell others, because they might think he's crazy. Now, my dad is a very serious person, and we were raised strict. Seeing him vulnerable while grieving for the loss of his only son, he started talking more about his feelings.

It was me, him, my mom, and my grandmother. I was taking a nap, and still felt jet lagged. Anyway, I'm dragging this out. He started telling his story. Kept saying, "Please don't tell anyone, it's not like nobody will believe you, or any of us anyway. They still think I'm crazy, and you're crazy for believing"

I've always been a skeptical person with the paranormal. (I have stories for those for a later time) I even was skeptical of UFOs.

Back in 1974, my dad was probably 9-10, living in Puerto Rico. He grew up kinda poor, living with 7 other siblings. Grandfather was never home since he was a mortician. My dad wanted to make his own money and help. Always was a hard worker. He was a paper boy, so he had to be up early in the morning to get the paper ready for his route. He would have to be up at 4 in the morning every day in the summer. 

One morning, any normal day of course, he's getting ready, it was about 4 in the morning, and he said he felt something so odd, he assumed he was an airplane or something. He said that what happened next still questions what happened to him. A bright light had basically lit up so fast, like a quick flash of light. Mind you, its 4 in the morning, it's still dark out. 

Before he could even think what the heck happened, he said he woke up and it was like time had passed. He said he didn't understand that when he woke up, he was basically laying down in the garage like he fell asleep. He's never been the type to fall asleep easily. At least that's what my grandmother said when we were talking. It was the first time he ever mentioned it. He basically believes that he could of been abducted because he doesn't remember how he ended up in the garage sleeping. Time must of passed within 5 hours after the incident of the flashing light. 

I kinda laughed it off and he gave me a serious face and said, "I'm really not kidding, this is why i don't say anything".

I honestly believed him after that because he's never been the type to joke around since, in all honesty, he was a serious person. 

From that point on, we ended up getting along more and we both enjoy hearing stories from others. 

I did do research around that time to find out when Puerto Rico started having UFO sightings. And around the 70s the was a lot of activity of people claiming they have too, seen things in the sky. 

I've always asked him if he's ever thought looking into hypnosis. Maybe his subconscious mind could help him find out what truly happened.

Its 3:39 Am... Don't hate on my typos lol
