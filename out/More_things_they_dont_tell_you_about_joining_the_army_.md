Ok, I got some more time so I’ll post another story for you guys. I’ll just get right into it then. 

After I graduated OSUT (one station unit training) I went back him to WV for 2 weeks and then had to come back to the place I just graduated. Big surprise, the army messed up my paperwork so I was stuck there for about 3 months, which wasn’t too bad because I was actually treated like a person instead of a trainee (big difference). As a holdover I was tasked out with helping behind the scenes with everything from helping setting up ranges to setting up random stuff for the FTXs (field training exercises) for the next class.

 On their 3rd FTX myself and 3 other holdovers were waiting around 2330 standing guard by the ammo and supplies the company had brought in for the FTX. At the time it was me, the XO (executive officer) of the company, and another guy sitting in the HMMV waiting for the rest of the company to come back from NIC (night infiltration course), which is the videos you see of the trainees crawling under C wire with live rounds getting shot overhead. 

Anyways, the important thing to know is it’s just myself, XO, and another holdover (I’ll be referring to him as A) sitting in a clearing in the middle of the woods in the middle of the night. I’m telling some stories of growing up in Appalachia, and topic of whistling in the woods came up. I told A that he should never under any circumstance whistle while he’s in the woods, especially at night. It’s also important to note that A is from the city, I think he said Atlanta or something like that. 

Can someone tell me why his ass decided to whistle like he was calling a dog. I start to berate him with insults like “dumbass” and some other things I shouldn’t repeat. I kept asking why he had thought it was a good idea. He told me:

“You’re telling me you believe in that bullshit?” 

Then XO finally spoke up and told him that it was really dumb on his part to whistle. We later found out that the XO was from the country in Arkansas and he had grown up hearing similar stories. In the middle of myself and XO verbally assaulting A, there was a loud whistle from the other side of the clearing. We fell silent and looked at each other. On the opposite side of the clearing was a windscreen with bleachers, the whistle sounded like it came from behind the windscreen. A said it was probably the wind blowing through the windscreen. 

Almost on que there was another whistle, but this time it was the exact same whistle A had done, like he was calling a dog inside. After the 2nd whistle XO turned on the headlights of the HMMV and I saw the reflection of eyes at least 7 feet off the ground, but I couldn’t make out a silhouette in the trees. Then, I swear to god the eyes moved up more as if the creature was climbing a tree. The eyes disappeared in the leaves but we could see trees shaking violently on the other end of the clearing. As we were watching the trees in front of us shake we heard an awful scream from behind us, like a mountain lion kind of scream. 

After the scream finished echoing through the forest the trees stopped moving all together, all that was left was the sound of branches cracking and falling, it was moving away from us. After that sound had faded the scream came again, this time from in front of us. After we heard that XO put the HMMV in drive and drove towards the main road saying that the rest of the company and Cadre can deal with any lost supplies. So we sat at the intersection of the paved road and the dirt road from which we came. 

Eventually the company came marching down the road and XO flagged down some of the cadre and stepped out to talk to them. After he was done with that conversation he drove myself and A back to the barracks we were staying in and told us that we had ruined months of planning for the FTX and that they had canceled it all together.

The next day I heard people talking about how they had the duty truck take over 10 trips back and forth bussing trainees back to the company. Part of me is glad A had whistled because what if those things were there and we never saw or heard them, what would happen if it had attacked the patrol base? I have so many questions. 

I’ll be posting more sometime soon, thank you for the support.
