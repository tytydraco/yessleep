How dangerous is it to tell someone that you are not real while you are Lucid Dreaming?

Can you get trapped in your mind? I want to share my real experience about this.

Today I slept at midnight, nothing abnormal but the dream I saw was bizarre. In the dream, I woke up from sleep, it was morning and the sun was shining. I was got to go to my university at 3pm and it was supposed to be 8am at the moment. But when I got out of bed, I was terrified. My eyes were crossed, I had got cross view and I realized one of my eyes were flipped in its socket. Damn, it was so real... . I tried to fix it but no it got worse and worse, eventually my eye ball fell of. I hold my eye ball in my hand. Then my mother came in and said put it in water, we will tell your father and put it back in with surgery.

I still didn't think I was dreaming, nor I was suspicious. I went to a mirror and looked at myself, I could see the flesh of my eye socket and now I remember, my nose was slightly  longer in the reflection but I didn't realized at the moment. Then I continued my day like all normal. Then we gathered in a family, my loved ones and people I know, most terrifyingly my lost-dead ones were in there too. We were going to a reassembly party on a high road. Some of them wanted to take a picture and we all agreed, we got into position and right before thr picture is taken, I lost balance and they laughed and talked about me being a weirdo and shit, damn I was embarrassed. Then I looked at my picture and saw my eye is in its place, I told one of them, he was my university student and he said the phone completes one of your eyes with AI no worries, weirdly I bought it.

Then we finally gathered in a family house, the house was large, it was a mixture of the houses I have been in my childhood. My childhood was spent in a village,  so everywhere was carpets, full of old and nostalgic furniture. I wandered around a bit but I realized that no one is talking to me and I was got to go to university at 3 pm, what time is it now? I didnt find any clocks. Then I realized, I knew that. Yes, I was dreaming, I said okay now, I need to wake up and waited... but nothing has changed. It was uncomfortable, I sat at the corner of the room and waited.

Suddenly someone came in, he was my highschool mate that I hadnt seen him for years, and he said what's wrong, I didn't care and said "you are not real, nothing of these are real, we are in a dream". The face of him suddenly changed from worried to serious and said "talk no more, it won't end good for you, you know what happens when you sleep in a dream? You won't wake up" . I said I don't care and continued to sit in my corner and eventually I fell asleep. 

When I woke up, I was in the same room, the same corner, the same house. I said to myself "Is this another dream?" Then I realized my eye was back, so yes, this is another dream and he came back, my highschool student that I hadnt seen for years. And then another one came too but I didn't recognize him. I knew the brain can not generate a new face and all the people you see in your dreams are the ones you know or saw at least once. They sat at a table, my highschool mate spoke up and said "Who am I?" He was very mocky at me, like they wasn't even taking me seriously, always smirking and making fun of me. I said him his name in real life and he laughed like I was a little child and said "Who is this?" Pointing the other guy and I said "I don't know". I told them  "I know this is a dream and the brain can't create a new face, so you are someone I know but I don't remember". Their face went serious and gave me a look of "Look at this motherfucker, he knows everything" and looked at eachother, waved their heads like they are disappointed. Then they went back to mocking and the other guy said playfully "Come on, Who am I?", I repeated "I don't know". Then I looked more and more his face and I remembered, yes, he was one of my father's friend's son. And I told him his name but he again, wasn't taking me seriously.

Then I said, "I know you two are actually my brain, when I am talking to you, I am actually talking to my subconscious, so why not know myself and my brain better" and they said "What you want to talk about?", I told them that how you(I was talking to them as 1 individual : my brain, my subconscious) process data, create imaginary that is THIS real? And they 2 told me 2 words that I hardly remember now : Boofus Boolean? I kept that in mind. Then my dad came in with a very mocking style, laughing. He and then those 2 started to make fun of me, my father said how they can't take me seriously while I can't even pronounce the letter "r" properly. I realized, yes, I couldn't pronounce the letter at the moment fr and now I remember, in my childhood, I was never able to pronounce the letter "r", I always pronounced it like an "l"(I am not english, our "r" is like the spanish "r", you got to roll your tongue to pronounce) and my father was telling my teachers about this, he was angry about how I can not pronounce the letter. 

I was fed up already, I wanted to wake up, but no I was trapped, I couldn't wake up at all. Those 2 went, dissappeared with the table that they were sitting at. I sat sadly, I was annoyed by all this, then my 2 sisters came in and God... I lost my elderly sister a year ago, she died while giving birth. She and my younger sister came in, their hands on my shoulders. My elderly sister was very supportive and it got me all emotional but I just couldn't and pushed them 2 and said "No, you died, you are a simulation" and angrily pushed them to the wall, holding their necks angrily and said "I want to wake up!" Then suddenly they flashed and turned into different people. My younger sister ran away, I didn't saw her but my dead older sister turned into another one of my university mates, a short guy with eyeglasses, he had a nerd look. And I remember now, he was too real. He was frightened while I was pressing him to the wall, I was surprised and released him, he didn't say anything and ran away like an NPC, then I went after him. He got into a room where there was a big table like a thanksgiving table and my cousins, other relatives that I saw was sitting at the table. I was shocked and acting like a crazy person, every one was looking at me worried but didn't say anything. The shame I felt while everybody looking at me like that, I said no I am dreaming, I took a pen and wrote the words they 2 said me "Boofus Boolean" on my hand and went away, Everybody dissappeared, the got empty. Then I looked at my hand again and the text was changed to "190028"

And this is when, I woke up again. It was my room again, the same sun, the same morning. I took the phone out and looked at the clock, it was 12am now, and I was all thinking, damn, I won't be able to wake up. I tried to go to bathroom, the house was empty, I thought maybe my mother went to her job early. I tried to open the doors but damn, the doors was very hard to open, the doors like wanting to be shut. I hardly opened the door and got in, then released it and the door slum shut like someone shut it. Then I opened the phone again and it was 2pm already?! Then I said,  okay, I am dreaming again.

And this is when, I woke up again. Everything seemed real now. You know how a lucid dream is,  crystal clear and sharp, you can't tell the difference visually but logically. I wanted to open the doors again but no, it was the same thing, the house was empty, the doors won't open. I got scared and called my stepmom, I called her name, she was as mother to me as my genetic mother and she called me from the other room, I got surprised. I went to her and she was there, she said what's wrong. I got angry as hell and told  "my brain" that "This is getting to far, wake me up! I WANNA WAKE UP". Then she gave me a very disappointed look and said "let's go", I didn't know what to tell but followed her and I got into another room in the house and saw my stepmom again, lying on the couch. I got crazy and told her "Stop! Who is this?!", It was 1 to 1 clone of my step mother and she woke up. They both told me "Who? I can't see anybody?" Then I told to them "Just look, you 2 are in the same room" They both looked around and acted clueless. Then I thought what kind of a game is my brain playing?! Are you making fun of me?! I told the other mom to get close to the couch, god damn, they 2 were face to face, looking at eachother but couldnt see themselves. Like what the fuck is this? Am I in a kind of 4th dimension or something?! Then they both look me with a big smile and wide eyes and said "Son what are you doing?" 

And this is when, I woke up again but the imaginery was very blurry, distorted. I tried to wake up but the sheets was like glued, I felt like I am trapped tied to move but no I couldn't. I tried to. After a while, I finally got out of bed. It was like the bed released me. I looked around and everything was distorted but I recognized, it was my childhood house. I opened the door, the room wss fairly dark and went to the kitchen. The sun was shining, it was morning again. Then I saw my elderly sister again but she was he child. She was like 8 years old and said "good morning" like nothing is weird. I tried to look at her face but her face was erased, I got scaredz it was like someone scratched her face on a picture, all distored void on her face. I said fuck it and tried to go as fast as I can, the house was endlessz the rooms were stretching away. With every step I take, it was getting harder and harder to continue. I was hardly moving forward like some kind of force was against me. I finally got to a place, a washroom and heard my dad, calling me, I went after and tried to get close but no it wss insanely hard to get any closer...

It was when I finally woke up in real life, I looked at the phone, it was 8:28AM, hours had passed but it felt like days. I was sure now, I wasn't dreaming.
