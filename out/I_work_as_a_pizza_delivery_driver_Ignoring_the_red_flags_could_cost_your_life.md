Howdy! Your friendly neighborhood pizza-delivery Dino here, with the latest tips on how to stay alive in this gig economy. My previous post about red flags to watch out for is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pnovqi/i_work_as_a_pizza_delivery_driver_some_deliveries/).

For the record, most of the customer requests are pretty standard. Wear a funny hat. Do a funny dance. Shout a funny phrase. Usually just stuff to brighten up someone’s day. The red flags, though, are for the *special* customer requests. When I say “red flag,” I mean red sticky notes on the pizza boxes. Usually written all in CAPS in case the redness isn’t emphasis enough for how important they are. Some examples of recent red flag deliveries include:

*Leave pizza outside room 665. Keep headphones with music on at all times while in the hotel. NEVER REMOVE HEADPHONES.*

Or...

*DO NOT PET THE CAT*

The red flags are never as simple as they seem. Take the hotel, for example. A swanky four star resort with bellhops and a smiling concierge. Always the same, elevator up to room 665, leave the pizza outside the door, back down to the lobby and out of the hotel with headphones on and the music cranked. BUT—

On my most recent delivery to that hotel, my phone battery died.

As soon as the music died, I heard only silence. Even though all the patrons around me were speaking. Even though the concierge was babbling. One couple was conversing right next to me, their mouths moving… and no sound coming out.

All the hairs on my neck stood on end.

Then I realized the concierge was watching me. He opened his mouth—and I quickly got into the elevator and went up to the sixth floor. Luckily there was an outlet nearby and I had my charger. I plugged in my phone and hurried to room 665. Here, the silence was less spooky since there was nobody around—

“Help!” cried a voice within.

I froze.

“Please! Don’t leave this time! Please, help me! You’ve got to bring help!”

The pleas went on and on. Had the person inside always been shouting for help, and I’d never heard before because of the headphones and loud music? When I stood there hesitating, the voice seemed encouraged.

“You CAN hear me! Don’t go—just wait right there. PLEASE! YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!”

I looked at the red flag on the pizza box: *Leave pizza outside room 665. Keep headphones with music on at all times while in the hotel. NEVER REMOVE HEADPHONES.*

… and I set the pizza down and walked away like I always did. Retrieved my phone and charger and put my headphones on. In the lobby, I turned my phone on and the music up. The battery lasted the thirty seconds it took me to cross to the front doors, and I don’t know if anyone spoke to me or called to me because I was blasting Baby Shark, a song I figured not even Hell could get through.

I do think often about that voice in room 665 though.

And I wonder whether I should have helped the girl inside, or whether it was wise to leave her there. I wonder if it will come back to bite me.

It sounded like my voice.

\*\*\*

If you’re wondering why I keep working under such dubious, hazardous, almost definitely illegal conditions, it’s the same reason I once considered stripping.

It pays good money.

Turns out I haven’t got the body for stripping. Or the strength, dexterity, charisma, or dancing skills—or any of the things strippers require to actually be good at their job once I googled it for two seconds.

A shame because I would make a damn good stripper if I had a different body and a different personality.

The best way to make a lot of money as a lazy person is to be born into a rich family. My parents failed me on that account.

And my rent doesn’t pay itself.

I have given some serious thought, though, to the advice telling me to find out the boss’s red flag (assuming the previous delivery girl was telling the truth about him). The boss is very secretive and whenever I ask him about anything he snaps, “Your job is to deliver pizzas, not questions.” Finding his secrets out would be easier if I could Google him, but I unfortunately don’t know his name.

How is it I’ve been running deliveries for weeks and don’t know his name? Weirdly enough, it’s not on anything in the pizzeria or on our website. And the thing is I forgot to ask when he first hired me, and kept intending to but he always had jobs for me right away, and now it’s been so long since I started working that it would just be really awkward. So I’m just praying it never comes up in conversation.

Cowardly? Sure. Lazy? Definitely.

I’ve been just calling him “Boss” though and he seems fine with it.

Anyway I finally had a chance to do some snooping last week when a job came in. The boss wrote on the receipt while on the phone, and when he hung up told me, “Fifty bucks tip for topless delivery,” slapping the receipt on the box.

“Ew,” I said. “Nope.”

“I thought you needed money?”

“I have standards.”

He arched an eyebrow. My rumpled T-shirt read: *The secret to success is low standards.*

“… *low* standards.” I underlined the word *standards* with my finger in demonstration. “Not *NO* standards.”

“Fine.” He untied his apron. “You watch the store.”

“Huh?” Seriously? He was trusting me to manage the place? I’d barely gotten out a grunt of surprise before the boss slung off his shirt and snatched up the pizza box. I think I gawked. A silverback would have been envious of his gloriously hairy back. I’m talking like a full magic carpet. If you shaved him, you could knit a sweater or three.

“Hey,” he said. “Eyes up here.”

“Sorry.” I busied myself at the counter, tying on an apron since, I guessed, I was now on pizza duty.

“Just one thing…” He pointed over his head as he opened the door and the bell jangled. “If the bell doesn’t ring, there’s no customer. So don’t speak to anything you see in here that *ain’t* a customer, capeesh, Dee-noh?”

“Dino,” I muttered. Like Dinosaur, which is my full name in case you missed my first entry. I remind him basically every time he says my name, and one day I even came to work in a full hood with dinosaur teeth and a face to help him remember, like the kind kids sometimes wear. His face lit up when he saw me. “Whoa, hey, look!” he said, grinning big. “It’s a dee-no-saur!”

So I mean, at this point, he’s definitely doing it on purpose.

Anyway. Did I capeesh? I didn’t even know how to spell capeesh. Turns out it’s “capisce.” I was still mulling over his directions and asked him, “What if I see something and it’s a customer?”

He growled, “Then the bell will fuckin’ ring, won’t it?”

Okey dokey.

When the boss was gone, I went snooping around, and in a drawer of a desk, I found my resume, now stained with grease and a scrawl in the boss’s handwriting:

*DIE-NO. GOOD OMEN?*

So apparently the boss had barely glanced at my mediocre credentials and instead hired me just based on my name which he thought was a good omen and *definitely knew how to pronounce.*

I put the resume back and gasped when I looked up.

Standing at the counter, peering over the desserts case, was an old woman.

“Oh!” I said. “Hello! I didn’t—”

At that moment I realized I hadn’t heard the bell ring.

“—didn’t get that pizza out of the oven yet! Dino, *tsk tsk,* you stegosaurus-brain! Better go and grab it. Come on, girl, you need to remember to do your job…” I kept on babbling, pretending I’d been talking to myself while the old woman’s eyebrows lifted, and she frowned and leaned closer, squinting at me like she wasn’t sure if I’d genuinely overlooked her or was faking it. She looked like an ordinary old lady, but in the pastry case—in the reflection in the glass—her mouth was wide and gaping and opening wider—

*Ding Ding!*

The bell above the door jangled as the boss came in. I looked up with relief—

The old woman was gone.

He took one look at my face and snapped, “The fuck you do? You got that look.”

“Look?”

“Your ‘yuppish’ look. You break a rule? Yup… ish. That fuckin’ look. You talk to anything strange?”

“Nopish.”

Since then, I’ve decided I prefer managing deliveries to watching the store. At least the boss got the fifty for doing the delivery topless. “I made sure they *paid*,” he growled ominously. Then he handed the bill to me and said, “For managing the store. You take care o’ them red flags, I’ll take care of the everyday creeps.”

“Deal,” I said.

\*\*\*

But the job that really got to me… the one that makes me think that maybe, just maybe, I should get my act together and write a better resume and get a regular minimum wage job that’ll barely cover my rent… was yesterday’s delivery.

Most of the day was ordinary deliveries. No red flags. Which meant no big tips, no bonuses. So by the time I got a pizza with a red flag I was actually happy about it. This was a new one. It read: *DO NOT LET THE BUNNY MASCOT SUIT SEE YOU.*

The address was to a shopping mall kiosk, and the boss told me this one was a little more difficult and to absolutely make sure not to be a “yuppish” about it. Then he gave me two hundred bucks and added, “fifty if you make it back.”

Mildly disconcerting, but I wasn’t gonna complain about the extra incentive. $200 for an hour round-trip delivery, plus fifty?

What a great gig!

As long as I don’t die.

But his extra warnings had me super cautious as I pulled into the parking lot of the shopping mall. Unlike a lot of malls these days, this one wasn’t rundown or spooky with empty storefronts. It was a pretty classic mall, like in the heyday way back whenever people thought it was cool to hang out at shopping malls. Smoothie shop, clothing shops, a sneaker store, a toy store… at a glance through the double doors, I didn’t see any mascot. I wanted to be careful though. So I didn’t enter right away. I kept checking, staying to one side of the doors—the part of the frame that’s metal, so I couldn’t be so easily seen while peeking through the glass.

No bunny mascot. No ANY mascot.

I did, however, see the jewelry kiosk I was supposed to drop the pizzas at—this small kiosk with shiny bracelets and earrings, and an impatient woman who spotted me and kept trying to wave me over. And after one last look around, I pushed open the door, walked straight to the kiosk, and handed the pizzas to the grateful-looking seller who handed me a fiver. The mall still seemed clear, and I glanced at the red flag again as I was turning away: *DO NOT LET THE BUNNY MASCOT SUIT SEE YOU.*

Not "the person in the bunny mascot suit." Just "the bunny mascot suit." Must've been a mistake or maybe just the boss's shorthand.

Anyway, I’d just pocketed the five and was about to walk away when I finally saw the bunny mascot. It was one of those mall easter bunnies, cream-colored with chubby cheeks and buck teeth and flat black mesh eyes that, if you look close, you can see through. I was still too far away though. It stood in the hallway leading off to the bathrooms, and it was staring right at me.

*Shit.*

I sprinted straight out to the car and, without looking back, drove out of the parking lot.

I finally breathed easy once I got onto the highway and headed back to the pizzeria.

When I got back, as soon as I walked through the doors (the bell dinging overhead), I asked my boss why not let the bunny mascot suit see me? What happens if they do?

He made eye contact and then looked deadpan behind me.

I turned.

The bunny mascot was at the window, paws on the glass, staring straight in at me. Only now I was close enough to see clearly through the black mesh of its eyes into the suit. And it didn’t look like there was a person inside. So maybe that hadn't been the boss's shorthand after all.

“Quick,” snapped the boss. “Surrender something important. What are you OK losing? An eye? A finger?”

“*What??*” I glanced back at him, then at the window. The mascot was gone. I hadn’t heard the bell ring. But when I turned around, I screamed.

It was looming over me, just behind me. And it’s… mouth? Face? Was opening. I could smell a rotten whiff from inside.

“This is the only time I’m doin’ this,” sighed the boss, and out of the corner of my eye (I was scared to look away from the mascot), I glimpsed him grab one of the knives and lay his hand down on the cutting board and then quickly, with barely a wince, *CHOP.*

—a thick, hairy-knuckled finger spattered on the counter.

I screamed.

The bunny turned.

“Here you go.” The boss came out from behind the counter and put the severed finger in the bunny’s outstretched paw. The bunny clapped the paw to its open face (mouth??), seeming to swallow the finger. Then it turned and walked out of the store.

“Hush,” said the boss as he bandaged his hand while I shrieked my head off. He told me: “Other deliveries are waiting. Normal ones. Get to it.”

What else was there for me to do?

I took the pizzas, trying not to stare at the boss’s bloody hand with its missing finger, and I went and did the deliveries. After that he sent me home for the day claiming I needed sick time.

When I came in this morning (after much debate about whether I should or not), I found him slicing peppers to put on a pizza… and his hands were whole. No missing digits. When I asked the boss what happened to his finger, he just asked what I was talking about and played dumb.

“That Easter bunny costume with nobody in it,” I told him. “I *saw* you give it a finger.”

“What? Like this?” He flipped me the bird and laughed.

I stared thinking maybe it was the gloves that made his hands appear whole, but he took them off after he finished chopping, and he still had five hairy-knuckled fingers on each hand. I squinted and finally I told him: “Your pinky finger is lighter than the rest. Like it hasn’t gotten as much sun. And the nail is clean. No dirt. Almost like a brand new finger.”

He considered me with a sigh and finally said, “Ya wanna know why I call you Dee-noh and not Dino, kid?”

“Why?”

“’Cause dinosaurs… they went extinct. I don’t want you to go the way of the dinos.”

A pause as I registered this rare note of affection from my boss. He had, after all, saved me from whatever that thing was. And despite my breaking a rule, he hadn’t fired me. I thought about his comment about my name and said, “That’s sweet, but that’s totally not the reason is it?”

“No, it’s ‘cause I forget ‘cause the name’s supposed to be Dee-noh. What kinda parent names their kid a dinosaur?”

“Actually it was me who chose the name.”

“Explains a lot,” he grunted.

Anyway that’s what happened when I fully, completely broke a rule. I told my brother about the mascot thing and he asked if I was high and where he could get whatever I was on (I mean yes I was high—that’s the only reason I told him). I can’t really talk about this job with family and the boss isn’t much of a conversationalist, so I decided it’s helpful to write this stuff down.

I might quit tomorrow.

If you don’t hear anymore updates, either I'm applying for other jobs, or I finally gave in and petted that [cat…](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)

EDIT: Hey, I forgot to add, for the *DO NOT PET THE CAT* rule, I took pics on my last delivery. One look at [this lil guy](https://imgur.com/a1sPynr) and you’ll understand why my immediate thought was, *So this is how I die.* I mean, just *look* at him! If a red flag takes me out, it’s probably gonna be this one.

… though I admit he’s slightly less cute if you obey the rule and leave him [glaring](https://imgur.com/FLT9Hz1) at you.
