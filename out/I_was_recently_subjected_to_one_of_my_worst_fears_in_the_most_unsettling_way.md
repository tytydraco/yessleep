Let me give you some context. I’ve always had an extreme fear of loud noises, I suppose you could call it a phobia. A phobia is an irrational fear, so some who don’t experience similar phobias will find it difficult to relate, but I’ll do my best to explain.



My earliest experience of this fear was when I was around 3 years old, I was in the back seat of the car holding one of those cheap ballons on a stick you get in fast food restaurants, and I distinctly remember being startled by the noise in made when it popped for no apparent reason. Several of these balloon incidents were enough to make me realise that I couldn’t stand the sound of fireworks, I would just stay inside and wait for it to be over. Whenever there was thunder, I would wear noise cancelling headphones in the house. 



I’m 26 years old and it just seems to get worse. last year I was invited to a new years party, but as soon as I arrived, I noticed that the entire floor was covered in balloons. I couldn’t focus on anything except the balloons. I didn’t even say hi to anyone, I just left immediately out of fear that one might suddenly explode. There is something about anticipating the noise that makes my heart race, my mind telling me that I’m in danger and that I must run away as fast as possible. Luckily, people have usually been respectful about my phobia, no one has ever tried to torment me with it…Until about 3 days ago. Here’s what happened. 



Over the weekend, I decided to spend some time alone and go for a walk. I wanted to go somewhere I didn’t know, so I drove to some small town about half an hour away, just to see what I might find. Parking was going to be a problem because of the heavy construction work going on in the town’s center. After a while failing to find a space, I arrived at what seemed to be the limit of the residential area, where the houses met with the thick forrest. The road I was on made a sort of U-turn and sloped downwards leading to a dead end. I stopped the car and got out, I couldn’t see any reason why I couldn’t park here, I wasn’t obstructing the road, and there was nothing here anyway. 



On one side was a concrete wall with a massive grey pipe protruding out of it, a trail of moss suggesting occasional water flow, and on the other, a tall mudbank with the forrest beyond it. What seamed to continue the dead end road was a tunnel, too small for a car, that went under the surface level of the tarmac. I thought about exploring it as there was light inside, but something was bothering me. I noticed a groupe of four people standing in a circle by the mudbank, occasionally looking at me and sniggering. I couldn’t tell if it was me they found so funny or if they were just chatting between them, but it was making me feel uneasy. They sounded strange, sort of erratic, constantly giggling. I discreetly looked their way, it looked like they were on drugs, I couldn’t tell, I quickly swivelled my head back towards the tunnel as I thought one of them had noticed me. I looked again, this time holding my gaze, but they didn’t really seem interested in me, their attention was more focused on whatever they were doing, then, they left. 



I waited a good ten minutes just to make sure they weren’t coming back. Once I felt I had waited sufficiently, I double checked that every door of my car was locked, looked around one last time and headed for the tunnel. The entrance was made of stone blocks forming an archway, but the walls on the inside were just earth, rocks and patches of concrete. About twenty meters in, the tunnel made a sharp right turn, I kept on, incandescent bulbs dimly lighting up the path. After a few minutes I could see a slightly brighter light at the other end of the tunnel, I got closer, it was another stone archway. I walked through, and down a couple of steps made from the same stone blocks, I was very surprised by what I had come across, it almost felt like I was dreaming this whole place. 



I was about to continue walking when I heard a loud bang. I looked behind me, it sounded like it had come from outside, it was distant but loud enough to make me jump. I waited, then carried on, another bang, this time louder, it was definitely coming from the entrance of the tunnel. I started to notice a pattern and covered my ears, expecting even louder noises to come. Even with my ears covered, I could tell that the third bang was deafeningly loud, it echoed throughout the tunnel, and this time accompanied by a brief flash of bright light, they were explosions. At this point I was panicking, I felt the familiar rush of adrenaline caused by my phobia as I pushed my hands into my ears as hard as I could. Then I saw a figure turn the corner right after the entrance, and run towards me, I didn’t know what to do. 



After a moment, it stopped, I couldn’t tell what it was doing, it was fidgeting. It suddenly started running again, and within seconds there was a flash of light followed by an even louder bang. It got closer, to a point where I could see his face, I got even more nervous when I realised that it was one of the four people hanging out by the mudbank, and before I knew it, he had stopped right in-front of me. It was strange, he was facing me, but almost seemed like he hadn’t acknowledged my presence. He was unnerving to look at, his eyes were bloodshot, there was sweat streaming down his pale face, he just looked completely out of his mind. After blankly staring at me, he fumbled around in his pocket and retrieved a red cardboard tube, it was a large firecracker, I jumped at the sight of it. Before he could even start looking for a lighter, I interjected with the most polite and calm voice I could possibly muster :



“Excuse me, sorry to bother you, before you light that, I must tell you that I’m incredibly sensitive to loud noises, I don’t wish to interrupt you, but is there anyway you could possibly wait 1 or 2 minutes while I get out of here, like that, I’ll be out of your way and I won’t disturb you anymore.”. I waited, then with the same blank stare he said : “Yeah sure, I understand, no worries”. I was relieved, he actually seemed quite understanding, his goal obviously wasn’t to frighten me, he never could have expected to find me here. But then I got a horrible feeling of dread when his drooping mouth subtly curled up into a sneer, like he was trying to contain his laughter, he wasn’t taking me seriously, he even found this whole situation to be hilarious. 



I didn’t care, I ran as fast as I could towards the entrance of the tunnel, my hands covering my ears. At first I didn’t dare look behind me, but then my curiosity got the better of me, and to my utter horror, he was running right behind me, just inches away, laughing maniacally, pointing the fire cracker to my back, desperately trying to light it with his other hand. I was so scared that I felt like I had doubled my speed and outrun him, I had no idea, I was so close to the entrance that I didn’t bother looking back and hoped for the best, I dashed straight to my car, got in and drove off as quickly as possible, I never saw him come out of the tunnel. 



I spent the whole journey home wondering what had just happened and what the guy had planned on doing, the more I thought about it, the more disturbing it got. Ever since that day I’ve had trouble sleeping, I can’t stop thinking about what happened and how surreal it all was, I jump at the slightest creek in the house, wondering if I’m really alone. Sometimes I fear that the guy somehow got into my car before I drove off without me noticing, that doesn’t seem possible, but then again, everything went by so quickly, where could he be now? I can’t even remember what the name of the town was, nor where it was, I’ve been looking for it on a map, I’ve spent ages looking for it, but it never catches my eye, I guess my mind must have erased that information for my own good.
