In our small desert town, every teacher warns the kids: never go into the fields. We hear it starting in first grade. No explanation. Just don’t.

When I started middle school, my mom enrolled me in a charter school, hoping I’d stop hearing about it. She thought it was some creepy small-town tradition.

But in seventh grade, the warnings got more specific. Even the charter teachers told us:
"If you see black tarps on or near the bushes, stay away. Never go into the field."

By the time freshman year rolled around, I told my mom the warnings had stopped. It was a lie. She grew up in the city — seventy miles from any kind of field. I never told her why the kids around here actually stayed away.

My freshman history teacher once told us the human brain doesn’t fully mature until around 25. That’s why young people make impulsive decisions.
Then he said something that stuck:

> "Our town has a lower mortality rate for young adults than the rest of the region. It’s not by much. But it’s there.
Especially for the younger ones."



I figured he was full of it. Just another weird desert superstition.

One afternoon, I had to pick up my little sister from school. My mom had gotten herself into some trouble again, and I was used to filling in — cooking, homework, bedtime. I was more of a parent than she was.

The sky was angry that day. Black clouds, flashes on the horizon. The middle school was just across the street from the high school, so I walked over and signed my sister out.

My history teacher was in the front office. He offered us a ride home. I thanked him but said we lived just around the corner.

As we were leaving, he said, “Don’t go through the field. They’ve spotted black tarps today.”

I waved him off.

It started sprinkling. I looked down the road — saw a group of local skinheads hanging out near the corner, watching us. I didn’t want to scare my sister, so I lied.

“We’ll cut through the field,” I told her. “It’s faster.”

She froze. Her face went pale. I told her she could hold my hand the whole time. I even told her Mom was making her favorite stew for dinner — another lie. Mom hadn’t cooked for us in six months.

Reluctantly, she nodded.

We stepped into the field just as thunder cracked. She jumped. I started singing her favorite song to calm her down. The rain picked up, and lightning flashed across the sky. That’s when she let go of my hand and took off running toward home.

She was fast.

I shouted and chased after her — but I slipped on the wet dirt and hit the ground hard. I looked up just in time to see her stop and glance back at me.

Then she was gone.

Not “ran off” gone.
Just... gone.

I panicked. I thought maybe she’d sprinted the rest of the way home. I ran harder than I ever had. My lungs burned. My legs shook.

When I saw our house in the distance, I almost cried with relief. The front door was open. I could hear the TV on — the afternoon news.

I slipped my shoes off at the door and hugged my mom as she walked out of the kitchen.

She hugged me back, smiling like nothing was wrong.

Then she said,

> “Baby… where’s your little sister?”
