*The following contains a transcript from a short radio broadcast that has been picked up by various listeners across the continental United States. Many have been perplexed by its sudden appearance and how it seems to preempt whatever song or radio program they are listening to at the time. It has even been known to appear on streaming programs such as podcasts or Spotify. Listeners have described hearing different episodes and there have been many different situations and incidents.*

*John Pratt contacted me with his story. He was a touring musician, had been for many years. The road had been his home and livelihood as he and his band had crisscrossed the country, playing shows most days out of the year. You could hear the weariness in his voice. Whether this was from his high mileage lifestyle or an encounter with “The Rules of the Road”, I didn’t know. I’d let him tell me.* 

Once upon a time, we were on the cusp. 

The cusp of being discovered, the cusp of money and stardom, the cusp of greatness. 

We had spent years slaving away, fighting for every inch to reach the top until we had gotten to that critical point. 

That final year we were on a cusp alright: the cusp of complete failure and self-implosion. 

I suppose with a name like Spit Weasel, it was an uphill battle from the start. At first, it was just a name that we had thrown together because we needed a name for the flier. Then, we had used it for booking our next batch of shows because we were lazy and it was the path of least resistance. We had always planned to change it to something cooler down the road. We had never expected it to stick. 	By the time we had ordered the first batch of t-shirts—a skinny rodent rocking a Gibson Flying V underneath the name Spit Weasel—it was all she wrote.     

“At least we didn’t go with Shit Weasel like we’d first talked about,” Bret said one afternoon while we were bemoaning our unfortunate moniker. 

“Always looking on the bright side,” I said.

“History’s full of dumb band names that hit it big. What the hell’s a Foo Fighter? How about The Lovin’ Spoonful? That’s a band that’s literally named after jizz. Didn’t stop them from hitting it big. It’s like a badge of honor past a certain point. When the fans start loving us in spite of our name, then that’s when we’ll know we’ve truly arrived.”

“Loving Spoonful is jizz?” I asked.

“Totally. I mean, think about it. How much do you have, when y’know...shoot your load? Not much more than a teaspoon, right?”

“Shit, man. I guess. Ain’t ever really measured it.”

“The average volume of ejaculate in an adult male is roughly five milliliters. That equates to your big ol’ lovin’ spoonful.” 

You had to be careful when Bret started going off on one of these rants. He loved the sound of his own voice and could go on forever. However, he wasn’t the only one that loved the sound of his voice. The fans and critics ate it up. Being as he was our lead singer and all, I guess that was a good thing. 

“Spit Weasel,” Bret said to himself. “Spit. Weasel. Kinda sounds like a sex act of some kind. Probably is. That’s why I think it works. It’s kind of exciting. Hell it could be the name of a dildo. Did ya know that there are at least two famous bands named after dildos?”

Although The Lovin’ Spoonful revelation was new to me, I had heard the rest of this bit numerous times. Next, he was gonna tell me Steely Dan was actually the name of a vibrator and that The Buzzcocks, well that went without saying. But it didn’t matter what I said, he was going to continue his spiel as if it was a song that we had all requested, a song he couldn’t stop singing. 

We all zoned out in the van as Bret continued his routine. We were like the spouse that had learned to tune out their significant other by nodding along, except at this point none of us were nodding, we just stared blankly out the windows of the van. Unless we were on stage or doing an interview somewhere, we had no interest in putting up a front. Even then, it was getting harder and harder.

Speaking of spouses and divorce and things that end, I don’t think there’s a couples counselor on earth that could keep a band together once that particular kind of acrimony sets in. A marriage on the rocks has nothing on a band that is destined to break up. It’s like a fuse that’s been lit. There’s nothing to do but sit back and watch the fireworks.

# 

Let’s meet the members of Spit Weasel. I previously mentioned Bret Hilton, our frontman extraordinaire. He was the guy at the center of all of the promotional band photos, the guy the music journalists flocked to. The guy described in the music mags as the “tousled haired lead singer of Spit Weasel...with an animalistic fury that was hard to ignore, his voice only matched in raw power by his piercing blue eyes.” 

Next, there was Keith Hayes, the drummer, whom I’m pretty sure we only kept around because his name was Keith and we thought it would be good luck to have a drummer in a rock band named Keith. Name notwithstanding, he wasn’t the best or most imaginative drummer, but I guess we didn’t really need him to be with the kind of music we played. One article described Keith this way: “with his frantic drumming, flesh colored beard, and receding blonde bushy hair giving him a clownish appearance, Keith is the quirky heart and soul of the band. He is just as likely to keep the rhythm as he is to do a flying leap off of his trap set or bang the cymbals with his forehead.” 

You had Ted Lang, the bassist. Silent and stoic and steady as a rock. The magazines and blogs described him as “looming” a lot. At 6’5 or 6’6 or however tall he actually was, I guess you could say that he loomed. I don’t know if it was because he was so big or what, but I can’t rightly say that I ever saw him get drunk. This wasn’t for lack of trying either. It was like the alcohol didn’t have an effect on him. 

Finally, there was me, your humble narrator, John Pratt. I was the one described as “putting on an intentional non-descript presence” and having “a silence that belies his role as the verbose songwriter and lyricist of the band.” It’s not that I was really that quiet. I just let Bret and Keith have the spotlight while I smirked in the background or offered a witty aside or two. It was too hard to compete when those two were going at it. And Ted, he didn’t have to move a muscle to get noticed, a towering statue. So I guess that left me all non-descript with my heart on someone else’s sleeve, my words coming out of Bret’s mouth. 

We formed in the late 90s with an origin story not much different than so many other rock bands at that point in time: a bunch of drunk twenty-somethings in a college town somewhere fall in together somehow and end up with a guitar, bass, and drums in the basement of someone’s rental.  

We started out with no idea of what the hell we were doing. It was clear from the get-go that once we decided we were going to be a band that our first step was that we should practice and play and do it a lot. We fell into a steady routine of practicing at least four times a week. We did this in the basement of Keith and Ted’s rent house. We would descend into that cinder block dungeon and it would be hours before we would emerge again. We would piss in a little sewer drain that sat at the corner room and we would fill a hubcap ashtray with butts and a 55 gallon barrel with crushed beer cans until it spilled over. The air was heavy with sweat and cigarette smoke and humidity.

We eventually got a weekly gig at one of the chill dive bars that leaned towards the punk side of things, a place called The Observatory.

After that, the next item on our agenda was to record an album. We certainly had the songs, more than an album’s worth of them. 

Summer came and it was time to go on our first real, bonafide tour. This would be in support of the release of our debut album, *Half-Empty.* It wasn’t any sort of coordinated thing, just playing anywhere and everywhere, from coast to coast across the continental US of A. Some nights we were the headliner, some days we would open for whatever other band happened to be playing in that area. 

We played pool halls and dives and nightclubs and biker bars and casinos and bingo parlors and restaurants. On more than one occasion we played the early evening slot at some busted-ass strip club in the middle of nowhere while a lone dancer with a c-section scar twirled on the pole and cowboy and ranchers drank from bottles, disinterested.  

Wherever we went, people weren’t actively coming out to see us. We hadn’t been a band long enough for that. It was all just happenstance. They happened to be in the bar that night. They happened to be stopping in for a bite to eat. They happened to be there to see the headliner. Whatever the circumstance, we hoped they happened to catch us, actually listen to us and fall in love. We were trying to grow a fanbase one fan at a time, win ‘em over any way we could.

The most memorable show from those early days was this Vietnamese karaoke lounge in Vegas. Yeah, our first big Vegas show and it was in a strip mall. I don’t know how Tyler booked the place, but it was packed with old Vietnamese men and some younger kids. They ate it up, the kids playing air guitar, the men nodding. We sold twenty CD’s that night, cleaned up in tips, and scored a bag of banh mi sandwiches. 

It was a world of wonder. I couldn’t believe that we were actually doing it, living the dream. Sure, we were scraping by, but every night I was doing what I loved. I knew after that first tour that I was never going to do anything else. Anything else would just be pretending.

In those days the internet was becoming more mainstream and more and more people were turning to online websites and blogs and message boards for music recommendations. Music fans were using MySpace to preview songs. They were downloading stuff off Napster. We would show up at shows and people would already know our songs. It was great. 

We started filling up the local joints every time we played, even had a couple sellouts. Local girls actually gave us the time of day (although Bret had never had a problem with that, even before the band)

By the time we were ready for our second tour we had grown cocky. We fancied ourselves as veteran traveling musicians now.

Alcohol was our drug of choice. Pot was second, but couldn’t hold a candle to our lord and savior Father Booze. We lived to get liquored up before a show and all during, just like many of our heroes had. We didn’t really dabble in the harder stuff. We were aware enough of rock ‘n roll’s history to know that didn’t usually end up too well.  

The exception to all of this was Keith. If you had some pills, he’d take ‘em. A handful of some weird brownies passed around at a show? Good as gone. Shrooms? Sure. I saw him snorting lines of unknown powder on numerous occasions. The way he would toss back the booze was like he was trying to burn the candle down at both ends, like he was trying to get a head start induction into the 27 club. The only good thing is that I never saw him break out a needle or tie off a vein. 

Our shows had become more drunken, raucous affairs. All of us (except for Ted and his magical constitution) had puked on the stage at least once, a sort of initiation. We got banned from certain clubs for our behavior.

Further down the road, we booked us a showcase at SXSW, the music festival in Austin. It was a big deal even back then, but not near at the level of overexposure it is today. You could still get a label deal if you played at the right place at the right time. Here rock and roll was still alive, if not alive and well.

The showcase was the next success. We were signed to a mid-tier indie label, Grindstone Records. They had been the label for some more successful bands than we were presently and behind them we’d have access to more resources in promotion and touring.

# 

I didn’t mean to get into this whole VH1 Behind the Music type of deal, but I think it’s important to see how we started out and how we got to where we were and how stagnant it really all became. That cusp I mentioned earlier? We spent years there. It came in a series of little advancements, but ultimately no matter how far we got we weren’t that much better off from where we started out.  

Despite the success of being signed to the indie label and getting a two-record deal, we were no closer to hitting the big time. Despite getting reviews in more esteemed publications, despite the stronger promotional arm behind the bigger label, it still didn't amount to much in the way of fame and fortune, just some cool stories we might tell our kids one day

Maybe we just weren't as good as we had all thought. 

Whatever our resentments were about our lack of success, one thing was certain: there was a certain draw to Bret, by all parties involved. From the audience, from the label, from the press. The interviews of the music mags all heavily focused on him. There were a couple of dreamboat photo sessions the label paid for featuring him with his pearl snap shirt unbuttoned all the way, his jeans down low. I got the sense that they were trying to make a star out of Bret, that a rebranding was coming down the pike. Bret Milton and The Weasels. 

Unless Bret wanted to take a night off, he didn’t play a single show without having some new chick end up at his hotel room. I know that’s not saying much in a rock and roll band, but Lord knows how often the rest of us struck out.

As far as Keith cared, pussy was just another drug, and an inferior one at that, something best experienced while under the influence of other drugs.

The exception to all these romantic failings was Ted. Good ol’ reliable Ted. He was anchored in life to whatever he decided and in his case it was life in the band and a good woman named Heather. She had understood the lifestyle and remained by his side through it all. She had started out shipping out our CD’s from online sales while we did our second you and even did some legs of various tours as our merch girl once we had signed to Grindstone. When she wasn’t around, Ted was constantly calling her or sending her postcards, buying souvenir keychains with her name on it from truck stops. 

# 

The years passed on the road, each one a blur indistinguishable from the next. The struggle continued, the poverty, the hard miles, the nights of playing to a crowd of fifteen in Dubuque, Iowa. Yet still, when I was on that stage with that guitar in my hand, that was the only time I truly felt normal, for that moment in time all was right with the world. I wouldn’t trade it for anything. 

I couldn’t go back.

# 

After that current tour, we ended up back at our homebase with the longest break we had taken in a long time. It was a break from touring, a break from recording, a break from the road. 

Ted and I, we both fell into jobs for the time being, Ted as a bartender and me working at a music store and giving guitar lessons on the side. Keith, who had begun to look real sickly towards the end of that final tour, entered a treatment facility and disappeared for a while. It seemed the brotherly bonds we had formed on the road were growing weaker. 

Bret became scarce. He would answer our calls every now and then and would hang out some, but he was distant and we didn’t see him much. We’d soon find out why.

We found out that Bret had signed on to record a solo album with Vitality Records, an imprint of Warner Bros. So in other words, a major label more or less. The big time. Some agents at Grindstone had brokered the deal. 

That almost ended it all right there. There was a big confrontation, a band meeting. Even Keith was there, newly sober for the time being. The rest of the band simmered in a suppressed rage and jealousy. Bret spoke his piece. We spoke ours. He explained that this could be a big step for the band, that after he recorded and toured this solo piece we could get back together and make a new album. 

What could we do but hope that we could trust him?

The rest of us took the dreaded hiatus, the death knell of so many bands before us. We sunk down into the drudgeries of our new lives.

 Keith took up a job painting houses and his newfound sobriety slowly slipped away. "They told me it could take several tries," he told me at the bar one time.

Ted seemed happy bartending and playing in the occasional cover band. He and Heather got married. I’d talk with him and jam on occasion, ask if he’d heard any updates from Bret. 

As for me, I fell in love with a brunette bartender that worked with Ted. Her name was Evie and her eyes were green and she looked like a dream. She had an array of tattoos that began at her elbow and went upwards, the black ink intricate on her pale skin. She was cool as hell. Dug music, too. The good kind.

For once it seemed like I was going to finally make a relationship work. It helped that I wasn’t on the road all of the time. We ended up moving in together, a small yellow cottage with white trim and a muddy yard. I felt happy, a measure of peace that I hadn’t known in some time, the big dream slipping away from me and replaced by something else.  

That something else turned up soon enough. In that whirlwind of romance and moving in together and getting after it whenever we could, Evie missed a few days of her birth control and got pregnant. 

After our son was born I started thinking, maybe I *should* just give it up. Maybe this was it.

Evie was my cheerleader though. She came through in ways that just made me feel luckier than ever. She encouraged me to give the thing one more big try, what with everything falling to place with Bret’s solo record more successful than anything we had ever done. Why not give the band thing one more try with his new popularity behind the tour?

“If you don’t try one more time, you’ll always be wondering, ‘What if?” she told me.

It was true that while at work when I wasn’t daydreaming of getting back home to hold my son, that I found myself daydreaming of being back in the band. I longed to be in the studio again, getting back out on the road, different clubs on different nights, friends in every town. 

# 

 Our fourth and final album was titled *Sometime After Never,* a not-so-sly nod to when I thought that we would finally achieve real success. I had a plethora of songs to choose from for this album, songs I had written during the hiatus. I chose the best of the best and we recorded what was probably my favorite of all of our albums. 

We had signed a deal with Vitality Records as a band and for the first time ever I felt like a real professional musician. We had budgets and managers and green rooms and everything. The only thing they skimped out on was the mode of transportation. I had hoped for a tour bus with a driver. Instead, we got an Econoline van with a trailer. At least it was a van that had a model from the current year, much less the same decade. 

It was here that the cracks in the foundation widened and the facade started to slip. It was clear that after the initial buzz of our first few shows back together that we had drifted apart. 

I found myself more and more annoyed by Bret. He seemed like such a phony now. He always had that potential, even back in the early days. But Bret didn’t become the current Bret we now knew until after the solo record, his ego and worst traits amplified like a guitar hooked up to a Marshall Stack. He acted like he was doing us all a favor by schlepping it with us. 

We noticed that on this tour that the crowds started getting prettier and younger and more dominated by the fairer sex. The cruel irony of the situation was that I was no longer able to play in that sandbox; Evie and Benjamin awaited me at home. If only this development had happened a lot sooner, back when we were all younger. 

Oh well. What I had with them was more stable and more fulfilling. I had plans on buying a ring once this tour was over, finally making it official with Evie.  

We were driving to Boise after a gig in Missoula when I heard it. Bret was driving and I was riding shotgun. We didn’t have a driver for this leg of the tour and it was the four of us in the van, just like old times. 

Per the long established bylaws of the band, the driver of the van had dibs on whatever was playing on the stereo. Bret had something playing quietly on the stereo. It sounded eerily familiar and it got under my skin. 

“Hey what’s this? Sounds familiar.” I couldn’t place it, but I just *knew* that I knew this song. 

“Oh nothing. Just that solo album.”

“Solo album?”

“Well...mine.”

*That’s a little vain,* I thought. Guess I wouldn’t expect anything less from ol’ Bret.

“I’m just picking it apart. Seeing how I can grow as an artist, what I can do better the next go-round.” He must’ve sensed my thoughts. 

*Had I heard this song before?* I had never even listened to the solo album in its entirety. Jealousy, I guess. 

It didn’t sit right. I turned the stereo up and started the song over. I took note of some of the lyrics, that line that went…*I’m coming undone, I don’t want to be the one.* And then there were those chord changes: the D-minor to B-flat and to the F and the C. I pulled my phone up to the notebook section where I would often write lyrics and ideas that came to me. 

There it was. The lyrics I had written down over a year ago were almost verbatim to what was coming out of the stereo. I had even written down the chords. I had never gotten around to finalizing it and practicing it with the band. There it had sat, long since forgotten only my phone, stolen somewhere along the way. Had he ripped it from my phone? He wouldn’t have had to necessarily. I could’ve been playing it on my acoustic in the motel room and all he had to do was be right there with the voice recorder on his phone handy. 

How many of my other song sketches had he snagged this way?  

“You motherfucker,” I said, looking over at him and reaching to turn off the music. 

*“I wouldn’t touch that dial, Johnny-boy,”* a voice from the stereo speakers said, clear as day and loud as hell. *“Not unless you wanna miss out on the feel good hit of the summer by our favorite rock & roll rascals, Spit Weasel*.”

“Wait, what’s going on? Someone playing our songs on the radio?” Ted asked from the backseat. “Turn it up.”

“I haven’t touched anything,” Bret said. 

The voice on the radio continued. 

*“Yessiree, we’ve got the latest from those fellas coming up right here in a jiff, right after the latest edition of “The Rules of the Road.” Here’s a taste to wet your whistle.”*

Just then, there was Bret singing the chorus of a song from our latest album, us playing behind him. It cut off and went back to the disc jockey. 

*Buck Hensley here with a special musical edition of “The Rules of the Road”. That was Spit Weasel with a cut off of their latest album,* Sometime After Never, *and we’ll hear more from them in a minute. But first, we’ve gotta get to our usual business.*

*You ever hear of a Chinese fire drill? I don’t know if it’s kosher to use that term nowadays. Heck, is it even kosher to use the word kosher? Guess they started calling ‘em Chinese fire drills on account of having some sort of issue with the Chinese, fear of the other and all that, as more of those folks found themselves over here. Maybe it was an inferiority complex? More and more it’s starting to seem like the case.* 

*Whatever the case may be, seems to me like yet another entry in a long line of entries of humans and whatnot fearing the dreaded* “other”. *Now I reckon you’d do well to be fearing the other, but you’re wasting your time if you think it’s somebody in the same species, much less an organism made from the same molecular elements.*

*I mean we all breathe oxygen, we all put our pant legs on one leg at a time. It’s not like we use super special sonic vibrations to stun our prey. It’s not like we then turn this vibration up to eleven and sever their covalent bonds until their internal organs are liquefied and leaking out into a delicious human slurry that we then slurp up with our funnel shaped proboscis. Them’s the kind of other I’m worried about.*

*But I digress, I know you fellas are anxious to hear your song on actual cosmic radio. On to tonight’s Rule. If at any point during your journey you come across a train on a railroad crossing that you have to wait on, then you and your party must perform that unfairly named ritual known as the Chinese fire drill. Why don’t we call it the label executive fire drill or the focus group fire drill? Everyone in your party must exit the vehicle, run around the perimeter of said vehicle, and return to their seats. All while the vehicle is in park, of course!*

*What are the consequences of refusing to follow this rule? Well, I’ll tell you. If you don’t perform this harmless little prank, then you will lose what you love most.* 

*Isn’t that something?* 

*Kind of unfair, don’tcha think? Small price to pay to avoid this, though.* 

*Welp. That’s all I got for tonight. I’ll be signing off to the sweet soulful sounds of Spit Weasel. Y’all stay safe out there. Stay rockin’. Stay rollin’. Stay lonely. I’m Buck Hensley and these are “The Rules of the Road.”*

His voice faded into static and the familiar opening riff of “Bullet Train” rang out over the car speakers. As the song progressed into the verse, it seemed different somehow. Heavier and more layered, slower and slower and slower. The song, it was cascading over me in slow motion waves like I was super stoned. I could barely move my head to look over at Bret, everything was passing so slowly, the weight of the song crushing me, crushing us all. 

When the final notes rang out, we realized we had somehow ended up parked off on the shoulder of the interstate with no idea of how we had gotten there.

“What in the fuck?” Bret said to the quiet van.

Keith rose with a start from the very back, “What’s going on? Van trouble?”

“Are you serious right now? You slept through all that?” I asked.

“Slept through what? Just had this dream that they were playing us on the radio.”

# 

There were two weeks left on the tour. As soon as it was over, I was done. Done with the band, done with Bret. I didn’t bring up the stolen song again. I was thinking of getting a lawyer involved as soon as I got back home, see what my options were. I wanted to take him by surprise.

We never figured out what was up with the radio broadcast. We had some theories, from a shared hallucination brought on by white line fever, to a prank from the label, to Keith spiking us with LSD somehow. Keith was adamant that he didn’t spike us, said there was no way he’d waste good drugs that way. 

The tour began to peter out in a series of headlining shows, each one with less of a draw than the previous. Somewhere in that final string is where it happened, the inevitable.

Leaving a club in Lawrence, KS there was a railroad crossing. We were on the outskirts of a dying industrial section that had made some attempts at revitalization. A closed restaurant to our right and a liquor store to our left, the club we had played at in our rear view. There was the telltale sound of a train's horn, the red-eyed sentries chiming and lowering their candy cane arms and me stopping the van. I looked back at everybody, put the vehicle in park.

"Y'all remember the rule?"

"C'mon, John. It's late dude," Bret said.

"I think we should do it," Ted said. "That was some trippy shit. What could it hurt?"

"What rule was this?" Keith asked.

"We're supposed to do a Chinese fire drill or some bad shit will happen," I said. "We received this supernatural radio signal."

"John, do you know how crazy that sounds? Do you actually believe it? I'm not sure what we heard," Bret protested.

The train was barreling down now, it’s light boring through the nigh a couple blocks away. We were running out of time.

"What have we got to lose? I'm getting out," I said and opened the door.

Ted opened his on the passenger side. I could see the back door open and Keith ducking out and sliding towards the back of the van. Bret stayed inside.

"Goddammit Bret. Are you really gonna fuck us over? Get out of the fucking van," I said, reaching towards him.

We were running out of time. How long could the train be?

"Keep your fucking hands offa me. I'm not doing this paranoid shit." Bret slapped at my hands.

"You're not gonna ruin this too," I said through gritted teeth.

Just then I felt large steady hands on my shoulder, pushing me aside. It was Ted. He plucked Bret out of the van with ease, tossed him over his shoulder.

"Ted, goddammit!" Bret yelled, kicking his feet.

"Look, he's laughing," I said. I could see the strained smile on Bret’s red face as his struggling waned.

"Let's hurry. Train's almost passed," Ted said as we scurried around the vehicle. I rounded the back and jumped into my open door. I could see the end of the train coming a few blocks down like a dark line being erased. Ted tossed Bret in the back and plopped down back in his seat.

I looked around. "Wait. Where's Keith?" He was nowhere in the vehicle, nowhere nearby.

Nowhere at all.

I looked at the other side of the street to the liquor store. I could see his bald head shining under the lights as he stood at the counter, checking out. I rolled down my window and started screaming at him. He gave me a little wave and held up a brown paper bag, shuffled towards us. 

It was too late. The train was long gone by the time he got to the van, horn still blaring off in the distance as it chugged off and away to destinations unknown. 

#  

Every night there was dread. Even the days were filled with it. I texted Evie constantly. Waiting for the day when she wouldn’t respond, waiting for the phone call that would come to tell me of Benjamin’s sudden death from choking or SIDS or smoke inhalation from a house fire. 

But nothing ever came and the fear slowly faded, the belief returning that the world was bound by laws and science that didn’t involve supernatural radio programs. I focused on the reality of my current situation, that the band would be dissolved as soon as the current tour ended. 

At least I was leaving. I didn’t see it surviving after my departure. Keith would be too unreliable for Bret’s ventures and Ted would likely hang it all up to spend more time with his wife, Heather. He had been talking about starting a family. 

A final show in Chicago that wasn’t advertised as a final show—but one that sold out all the same—and all of my fear, all of my unhappiness, all of my doubt evaporated. 

Up there on the stage and the music flowing through me, I was the happiest I’d been in a long time. For that brief moment in time, music was the cure for what ailed me. My only true salvation. 

Hail, hail rock & roll. 

# 

Forget riding back to Richmond with the rest of the guys. I was going to take the next flight out of O’Hare. Ted would make sure my amp got back ok and I took my Tele and Martin with me. I didn’t even have a farewell drink with them.

My flight was scheduled to leave around noon. I got a room at an airport motel, smoked a cigarette in the parking lot and told Evie I was coming home early. I could hear her smile through the phone, could practically see it. 

“I’m done, baby. I’m done,” I said to her, my voice cracking.

The familiar darkness of a motel room and the intimate hum of those window air conditioner units that you've known all these years. You're waking up to the feeling that someone has slid into the room with you, that it’s maybe the ghosts of all of those who’ve slept here before. 

But you feel it watching you from the shadows, and maybe you can hear it breathe. Your eyes are blurry and out of focus and you chalk it up to still being half asleep or maybe even still dreaming. As your eyes adjust you see that, no, this is happening. There is a silhouette, a figure at the foot of the bed. You can't move and you can't scream and you've heard the stories about sleep paralysis and maybe it's just that, maybe all you have to do is wait for it to pass. Pray that your heart doesn't beat against your chest until it stops, that your breath keeps going in and out. 

And somehow the lamp is flickering beside you on the nightstand and you catch sight of the thing at the foot of the bed, the thing crawling onto the covers. With its vinyl black eyes and the bloody tongue wrapped in guitar strings and one rigid arm dragging behind it, it pulls itself closer and closer. The rigid arm spinning around mechanically, the shirt sleeve sliding down its wrist and it's not a wrist at all. It is an arm, just not a human one but rather the arm of a turntable, an arm that ends in a needle, a needle way longer than any record player ever would need, two feet long and shiny and gleaming. When the needle enters your ear there's pain, but you can’t react and this must be what it's like to wake up frozen on an operating table, aware of everything. 

When the darkness returns and you can move again, you see a shaft of light shining through the curtains and realize it’s morning and you call back home and find out that everyone is ok. You splash water on your face and you’re so thankful that it was all just a dream.

Except as time passes you find out it was anything but.

They call it musical anhedonia. At least, that’s the closest approximation of it that I could find through my research on the internet. It’s the lack of pleasure derived from the listening of music. We’ve all seemed to know these people throughout our lives, these weirdos that just don’t really care much for music or have never been moved by a song. Well, I’m one of them now.

What I have seems to be more of a unique case of it, though. It’s not that I just no longer enjoy music as is the common case of musical anhedonia, it’s that it all sounds like an atonal wash of sound. I can’t even pretend to like it; it’s painful. There’s no difference in me listening to “Born to Run” or “Let it Be” or “Stairway” and the dulcet tones of a jackhammer on sheet metal. The first time I picked up a guitar since that visit in the hotel room, I tried to play a G chord and it was like pulling out a splinter. I got nauseous with each strum, sick with worry that something was drastically wrong.

Sometimes I think it would’ve been better to have lost all of my hearing instead of the  affliction I’m now left with. At least I would have all those songs in my head. I could revisit those glorious places in memory, hear the guitar solos on crunchy low wattage tube amps, the chord changes and drums, the triumphant howls. Hell, I could probably even still write and compose music as a deaf guy like Beethoven composing his 9th Symphony. 

The more severe symptoms have faded with time and now music is just background noise to me now. It all sounds like tinnitus to me now. Painfully annoying at worst, easily ignored at best. I haven’t picked up my guitar in years and I sold the majority of my record collection years ago, keeping any leftovers for Evie and Benjamin. I got a job in a factory. The beeps of my forklift backing up instill in me the same joy as the songs I hear Evie singing in the shower.

Of course there were the others. What was to become of them and the things they loved most? It was different for us all. Some were worse off than others.

Ted’s wife Heather was dragged from her bed late one night. Her screams echoed through the neighborhood. Her fingers clawed tracks through the yard. They found her body in a ditch with a broken neck and numerous bite marks. 

Ted was at work when this happened, came home to an empty bed and a wide open back door, bloody fingernails on the threshold for when she had clung on for that final second before she was dragged away. 

Ted was never a suspect, working at the bar and all. They weren’t even sure that what got her was *human*. 

When I heard about what happened to Keith I couldn’t help but chuckle in the face of it all. I’m glad one of us got out ok. 

When it was all said and done, what else did we expect Keith to love the most? What was it that he lost? 

Well, he got completely sober and joined the seminary. Now he gets high on Jesus and preaching and the straight and narrow. He has no use for the rest of us heathens and Ted and I have no interest in hearing about how everything that happened to us was part of God’s plan.  

We haven’t spoken to him in years. 

That leaves Bret. What was Bret’s one true love? It wasn’t his talent or his career or his status that he had lost, it was what he loved most. One late spring night, Bret went missing. A girl he had been dating said he had went out for a long walk along The James. He was apt to do this, liked to get high and stare out at the water and think of songs. 

That night, though, he never came home. They scoured the river, never found his body. There were no reported sightings of him. He had simply disappeared off the face of the earth. 

The label scraped up enough new studio demos, B-sides, cut tracks, and other stuff Bret had lying around to release a posthumous album. It made numerous “Best Of” lists at the end of the year. I didn’t listen to the album to see if any more of my old songs were on there. I wouldn’t have been able to tell the difference. 

Sometimes I think that maybe he wasn’t going to the river to think, but rather to stare at his reflection in the water like good ol’ Narcissus, the guy from Greek mythology. 

Maybe there’s a wildflower growing along The James with Bret’s name on it, coming back year after year accompanied by its one true love: the reflection of itself on the river’s surface.

There’s a void in me that will never be filled, something that once gave me so much joy that I can’t find a replacement for. When I look at my wife, my child, and I’m lesser than the person I could have been. I’m just not as happy. 

Yeah, I hate to keep harping on myself and boo-fucking-hoo on me when there are people that have actually died, but my experience is all I’ve really got. There’s a more disturbing implication to what has happened to me, something that I’m ultimately thankful for, but that I’m not sure I can ever forgive myself for. 

If I look into my heart of hearts I know that the rules were right. My family was spared because there was something out there that I simply loved more. What kind of guy leaves his woman and kid behind alone at home while he goes off and chases his little rock and roll fantasy? The kind of guy that has other priorities. 

I remember something a roady once said, out there on the road during one of our bigger tours. He was grizzled and weathered and had the appearance of a man that had been rode hard and put up wet. We were smoking and drinking at one of the many aftershow parties and he said this with experience in his voice: “Women come and women go and divorces happen and friends die and kids grow up and in the end the one thing that is always there is the music.”
