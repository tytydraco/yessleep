You see, its actually the best way to kill something.
 I live in Obscurit√©, of course, I don't stay in a place permanently, I travel, I even bought a van for this.

Anyways, I am a Cleaner, y'know, take a job, go there, destroy and clean everything, then leave.
Pretty easy, right?
No. No its not.

There's always a few tricks to do this, but only a few of them matters.

Leave no trace, be careful, and always aim to the head. **Always.** In every single situation.

Anyways, I got a job a few weeks ago, pretty simple job, go to an old building in Vide Brilliant, clean up the mess, get out.

I mean, Vide Brilliant, nothing happens there, right?

I got to the neighborhood where the building was located, it was silent. And cold, a lot colder than normal actually.

The building was some sort of a old storage building, it had a sign on it, but the goddamn graffitis, so I couldn't make out anything else than the letter "N".

I looked at the door of the building, there were broken, metal doors.
I entered, there was this weird rot smell all over the place, and there were weird drawings on the walls, too.

I started to erase them, to destroy anything related to whatever the hell happened here.

But a particular drawing wasn't getting erased, somehow. It was a light bluish green crown, and, I just left it there.

Then I proceeded to the main room, and oh boy, I finally saw what the hell that rot smell was.

The room was full of corpses, a lot of them, all dressed in worn robes with blood red eyes on them, and weird masks.
 
There was a slightly faint triangle on the ground, and a bunch of severed limbs around it.

But, I mean, its my job.

So I proceeded to simply burn the building down with the corpses, the easiest way.

Then something happened.
A weird, purple light started to emit from the corpses, as they suddenly standed up, slightly levitating.

Hell, like, magic zombies? I must've been hallucinating again.
I was not.

They started to come towards me, so I shot them, again, and again, and again.
They, didn't die. I mean, it was kind of idiotic to try to kill something that is already dead.

Then I saw that, the limbs were... reconnecting? I really don't know the correct term for that.

Then I realized, the magic was coming from that particular group of reconnecting limbs, which were failing miserably.

You see, necromantic magic is weird as hell.
It comes from a source, or the Head, as some people calls it.

When the Head is destroyed, the flow of magic is cut, and simply, it stops.

So I started running towards the limbs that were trying to reconnect, and started shooting every single one of them, then I remembered I just needed to burn it, but I still needed to make it stay in a place long enough.

Oh, yes.

I started running away, and they followed, to outside the building, and then, into my van.

When all of them was inside, I got the spare gasoline I kept for things like this, and then poured it everywhere, while trying to not get killed by weird magic zombies.

Then I set it on fire, but one of the things got my arm, damnit.

So, uhh, do anybody know what the hell happened on that place?
