I’m typing through cold sweat. On my phone. In Sam’s exam room. Lying on a leather table. I’m hyperventilating with a cold compress on my head. I’m so hot. And oh my god, my head. It's killing me. Never had a fucking headache like this before. I’m sweating like a pig, my hands are shaking lioke crazy. so excuse me if I type in unintelligible ways.

I must hurry. Sam might come back any time.

Alrught. So I went back to my desk. I had a hard time concentrating after the incident. The rest of the day went normal, more or less. But I couldn’t focus. I kept thinking “Travis” and “I made them all disappear” like what did the crazy man mean by that? Who else did he make disappear? And how did he know about Travis? Was he... perhaps... involved in Travis’ disappearance?

Travis disappeared, jumped out of window at work 5 years ago, was never seen again.

All we know is his case went cold after a year, and the police wrote him off as dead. And they refused to keep looking for him because “Travis Windwell is a grown adult man, he can go wherever he pleases; every adult that is of age has the right to ‘disappear’ as you call it”.

Not gonna lie, I’m bitter as hell that they refused to look for him.But I sort of just got used to it. I miss my brother every day. But part of me has kind of accepted that he’s gone and will never return – and all I have left of him is the memories. His straight black hair (like mine), his bright grey eyes and the dimples when he smiled. How could a 29-year-old man just disappear like that?

It was NEVER like Travis to just disappear without saying something. He would always call my mom to let her know his whereabouts, even for being a little bit late from work.I still try to go over the day he went missing. It was the 20th September 2018.

He was at work, in his office. Like always. I remember.... he called me that day. He said he had an ear infection and needed antibiotics. Wait. Antibiotics. Oh yeah. That was the last time I ever heard his voice – or any sign of life from my brother.Could it be that the antibiotics are WHY he disappeared? I mean. I told you about the crazy man in the ER yesterday.

I told you he took some striong antibiriotics and yes. Maybe it WAS a psychosis after all? Or is there more at play?It could be that the meds DID cause his craziness. And maybe... just maybe... no. No way. What was the name of the meds? The meds the weird man took. The meds Travis took. No. NO. wasn’t that the same ...? no. the fuck. It cannot be. They didn’t BOTH take the same pills and BOTH got a psychosis from it?Fine. Makes sense. Biut then again how did the man know about Travis? How are they in connection with each other?

Strangely, nothing happened for the last 3 days. The crazy man didn’t show up again. It all went normal again until about an hour ago.

The crazy man came and entered the ER door again today. This time he looked very angry. And there was no sign of a med reaction of any kind.He stared at me. Just stood and staredd. He stared. For a whole minute . or loinger. I don’t know. But I could tell sth was up this time and it was NOT the medicine.

“Melissa.”

I squinted my eyebrows in confusion buit didn’t say anything. He continued. “Melissa... “

I raised my brows now. What the hell did he want from me?

I noticed one more thing. His skin was not yellow anymore. It was yellow yesterday but now it was not.

He aggressively walked towards my desk. Fast.  He walked weird. In a way that he was dead, or like a nu,b walking zombie. He walked as if he were dead inside, his body just moved while he wiggled a little. Like you would expect a slightly drunk person or a zombie to look when they walk fast.

He walked extremely fast and then suddenly stopped abruptly in front of my desk.

One redditor advised me to use salt (and lots of it). since sprinkling the salt in front of my desk in a cirlcce wasn’t an option (as the cleaner would get mad at me), I put several open containers at the front of my desk in a row. As a protection wall. It seemed to work. (Thank you, stranger, for the advice.)

He then stood there, still staring in the same manner, his face had not budged. He stood and wiggled to the side a little, like he was drunk.He opened his mouth to say sth but then stopped and closed it again. He stayed like that for a few secs. Then he slowly opened his mouth again, and said (in a deep, evil, aggressive voice): “I know where Travis is. I knew all along. For the last 5 years I have known. Heh heh heh heh. I’ve got him. I got your brothaaaaaaaa. Heh”Knowing that the salt stopped him from coming closer to me, I figured I might as well just ask him. “What do you want? Who are you?”

He continued staring at me blankly and wiggling like a drunk. “I want revenge.”

“Why? For what?”

“You and your colleague are at fault. YOU are at fault. My dad died 5 years ago. He never woke up. it was YOUR mistake.”

“no.” My face went white. I couldn’t help but stare at him in disbelief. That incident. this old man came in after a car accident and sadly couldn’t be saved. ... Jason and Sam had to put him in an artificial coma and then turn the machines off. As he couldn’t be saved. I was the receptionist – of course I had to make him wait a couple secs because we weren’t sure what was wrong and he had nobody with him exceot... no. wait. NO. yea. The middle aged man who accompanied the old guy. It was.. no. Yes. a yellow blond man in a suit. The suit was burgundy colored. So the evil weird man was the son!

I thought I knew  what the deal was now. He wanted to take revenge on US for letting his dad die. -and he blames Us for it.

I noticed another thing. The man’s breath stank more of sulfur than it did yesterday. Like OOF did it stink. I nearly vomited into my mouth. And my eyes watered. It really stung. The stench stung in my eyes, my nose and throat. And my stomach too I think.Another thing I noticed: Speaking of Jason.. where is he?! He nverr missed a day of work, he even comes into work when he had a deadly flu or the plague. He is a typical healthcare worjker – extremely stubborn when it comes to his own health and never wanting to admit that he’s sick. But today I haven\*’t seen him yet. I’m not sure if that has sth to do with the weird black shit he wiped away two days ago – but that was the last time I saw him.

But boy do I feel sick....... I think I need to vomit.Whatever, back to topic. I had a flashback of the incident. I was scared to death. The man continued. “I know what you did. YOU made him wait on purpose although you KNBEW he was an emergency. You clearly didn’t care if my dad died. That’s why you made him wait. F You let anyone in before, except when old people need help. Old people are worthless. Once you hit 50 you’re nothing but a sack of old shit. That’s what it looks like.” He paused a few seco and then continued. "You killed my dad. My one and all. My only trusted person I had left. You took it all away from me. And now it is MY turn. Heh heh."

Before I could open my mouth and reply to that, he tried really hard to move towards me. Buit it didn’t work. it looked kinda funyy. Like trying to push his face through a glass window. But the salt seemed to be doun the trick.Suddenly he stopped wiggling, stood very firmly and started grinning. In an evil manner, like teachers used to grin when they caught a kid doing nonsense. Like “ha, I got you”. “I saw your nametag and then traced your ass back. You stopped working here 5 years ago, and then got hired again this summer. I know ALL about you.” His tone of voice now had a tone of sarcasm and mock in it too.“aww. What’s wrong babeh? You’re looking pretty pale. Heyh? Feels bad being caught!  Heh heh heh. Now you’re gonna feel how I feel.” He let out a brief, slightly-aroused groan. “Quitting the job right after my father’s death? Heh heh. Aww. pussy boo. Looks like Miss Thick glasses couldn’t habdle the guilt?” He tilted his head and showed a fake-concerned expression, in a mocking way. He then reached into his suit pocket, slowly. "Ehhh. Now I’m gonna show you something that you Will Not be able to handle for sure." He pulled out a phone, poked around, and then turned the screen towards me.

I felt kinda silly being a 26 year old woman feeling intimated by a man laughing and staring and stinking at me. But I couldnnn helop it. But then he showed me a video on the phone - and then I had a reason.What I saw made me jump out of my chair and knock over all the salt containers kff tce table.I saw a basement. I saw the camera moving. No windows, it was pitch dark. The only light I saw wS  a phone flashlight dim. Then the camera moved as if someone was walking and led to a corner. I saw a dirty extremely gross matteess lying on the ground.

And on the mattress I see the silhouette of a man. The camera moves closer to what appears to be a man. The camera points at him. I see that the man is tied up. In shackles. He’s bleeding and chained to the mattress. Struggling to breathe. In the background, I hear evil deep voice giggling (like the man standing before me, I recognized that voice). He said "I will chop them off. Heeeh heh heh. Choppy chop-chop, choppidy-chop. Funny heh?"" Then the man on the mattress screamed in terror. He tried to scream, that is. It sojnded like he screamed with his mouth closed, or he had sth stuffed in his mouth. The voice of the mattress man sojnunded weirdly familiar. Too familiar. A voice I haven’t heard in years. I hear the weird man shushing. Then a hand moved towards the prisoner's mouth and a cloth is pulled out. Then the prisoner screamed VERY loudly and violently. "YOU ARE SICK! No!! NO!! Let me GOOoO!!!! HEEELP! SOMEbody HELP!! MELISSA!!! MOM!!! DAD!! Heeeeeeeeee-" then the shushing is back. "Honey honey.! We don’t you to disappear UNDER THE EARTH now, do we?" The prosoner shook his head aggressively and then stopped screaming. Now the canera was on his fsce. It was dirty and full of filth, mud and his hair was all dirty and mushed. I had a hard time recognizing it as The face looked very squashed, there were dried tears all over it and It was all dirty and full of wounds and filth. But it looked too familiar . The voice. And the fsce. Very distinguished. I was starting to get a strong intuition. I wanted to puke.

Tgtje evil ma#n's voice started again "good boy. Yaaaaaaaa. Goooooooood boy. Mhmmmm. Now. You either sty down here for nother 5 years or you do as I say? Hmmmm? Will you sign now?" "Fuck youuuuu", said the (no. Wait. eXTREMELY familiar. And very distinguished. It can only be…. No.) man on the bed weakly and whiningly. Now it was clear. I knew who the man was. It could only be one person . I nearly screamed. But couldn’t. I was too scared to scream. The video ended there.Then the man pulled the phone away,  grinned evilly, and put it back in his pocket. He nodded snd giggled and looked at me. No… then the man leaned towards me. And put his finger on my lips, still grinning evilly.I was too shocked to react. I stared back at the man for a few Seconds. Then I got up from my chair, escaping the finger and freeing my lips. I did what I couldn’t avoid. I stood there and stared in disbelief. Then, I said it. It slipped right out of me.

No, I screamed it. "TRAVIS!!!! "

then screamed again, but with my mouth closed, then again, and again, progressively weaker. The man must have noticed the spilled salt. He jumped äat me and tackled me. He strangled me. Closed my mouth and nose with one hand. Strangled me with the other. and the next thing I know is, everything went blsck.

\------------

Next thing I knew I was here. I don’t remember much. I just remember that extremely angry headache. I’ve never had a headache this bad. It hurt so fucking terrible I wanted to chop my head off with äa chainsaäw to stop it. I was hyperventilating wildly and my pulse was äat 200. And boy did I feel hot. I remember hearing some indistinct mumbling. It sounded like Sam's voice. I also heard the voice of my coworkers. Sam must have noticed that I had woken up and then put his hand on my forehead. "What the…?", I struggled to say with a weak voice.

My mouth was so dry. "Sam? What…? Woah!!! Woah. Where am I, where am I?" Then I inhaled exasperatedly. Sam pressed my häand to calm me down. "Melissa, it’s all good. Ok? I’m here. All is okay. I-" I interrupted him. "No??? No. No!! Now.. don’t tell me that I fainted!""You did. You spent 6 hours lying unconscious next to your desk. Dan had to call me and we brought you here. Dan carried you here."Sam felt my pulse, with his other hand still on my forehead. "Mmm. Not good. Your heart is way too fast… for jesus sake!"

He grabbed a cold compress and put it on my forehead, and fixated it by placing his hand on the conpress for a few seconds. He then hooked me to sn IV and I begged him for something to kill the headache. So he added some painkillers too.I didn’t tell Sam what happened. I couldn’t either. He had to leave the room bc another emergency arised. He left me allne in this room. I don’t understand anything of what happened these last 3 days but I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to think. I can’t… what the heck. And owww my head. I gotta puke. I’m sorry.

I gotta stop here. Sam is back. He wants to check on me and run a blood test. I don't know what to do. I need to find Travis. And prevent this revenge-angel from doing worse things.

EDIT: I really do wonder where Jason is. I'm concerned about him too.
