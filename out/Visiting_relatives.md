My husband and I haven't been back to his hometown for a few years, mainly because he has only few relatives alive. 

Another reason is that they have very strange beliefs, you know, that kind of local gods that don't be known out of the town.

He once wanted to put a statue of the god in our new house, because his mom asked so,but I didn't agree. That's no use,i said. After all, he is a househusband, the main source of income for the family is me, and I am an atheist,and I pay for the house mortgage. So he just give up.

When I married him, I knew he didn't like to work. But he was so gentle and took good care of me at that time. And…too good looking.When I said I was infertile, he hugged me and said it must be difficult.

For a long time, I thought, if I wasn't infertile, and he wouldn be willing to adopt, and we would have a perfect family.

He said that this year has been the fifth year since his last went back, and we have to go back. I only went back his hometown for a few days in the early days of our marriage and his parents's funeral,and besides that he went back alone. But since he asked, I think it's okay to go back, after all, we haven't had a family traveled this year.

I asked him to buy some gifts, and he said, but dear, I don't have money. I wanted to say that I just gave him a few thousand yuan three days ago as food expenses for this month, and there were no large expenses in the past two days. But in the end I gave up. After all, if I asked him, he would only say that I was stingy and never gave him enough money.

I drove for a few days back to his hometown and gave several relatives the new down jackets and cigarette. Winter is coming, and down jackets are very practical.

They told me that I came back in time because they were about to offer sacrifices to the god activity. I asked them is that mean I needed to get up early to offer sacrifices to the gods, and they said no. But I still woke up very early the next day because I kept dreaming that I was in a foggy forest and I just couldn't get out.

They said I could be the first to the Poe divination. For fun, I asked if I would have a child. It gave me three same result,one of the blocks has its flat side facing up and the other has its flat side facing down, and the village chief was very happy. She told me that it meant that the gods agreed very much. 

I didn't understand. I couldn't get pregnant. I knew it when I was in high school. The probability was only 2%.
"So, he agreed? About me having a child."

"It's her, you can't call the god him." Her expression suddenly became serious. I apologized for my rashness and helped cook for the whole morning. 

At noon, the whole village had a meal together. The food was delicious, but I suddenly vomited. I thought it might be too tired. Fortunately, they were very tolerant and let me leave early to take a nap.

The village chief gave me a bowl of porridge. She told me that it was normal and that every woman would feel this way,when you having a new life. I didn't tell her about my infertility. My husband and I had tried for two years but to no avail.

What made me angry was that my husband didn't come back that day. He was playing poker. When he came back, he apologized to me, but I was still very angry because he is drunk.
I slept well that night and dreamed of a little girl. I braided her hair and blew bubbles for her。

The next day, they told me that the statue had to be delivered by my husband and me. I didn't ask why. The village chief told me that the mountain was called the God's territory in their dialect, and there was a temple on the top of the mountain. 

As for the statue, it was made by a male carpenter a long time ago. Thry need to take the statue up there and only take it down the mountain the same time in next year. 

I asked her what those nameless tablets were. She said that there used to be very cruel customs in the nearby villages. The more miserable the death of the baby girl, the more likely the next child would be a boy, so those nameless tablets were for them. I touched my belly and thought of the little girl in the dream again. I felt a chill.

It was foggy on the mountain that day, even though the weather forecast was for a sunny day.

After walking for two hours without reaching the destination, I realized that we might be lost, but my husband said not to worry, as he had been playing in the mountains since he was born. It wasn't until he took me to a cliff that I felt something was wrong. I was still holding the statue because he thought it was too heavy, and the last thing I heard him say was, "Go to hell."

I tried to get up, but my pelvis must have been broken. I tried to stay awake, but it was difficult.
At this moment, I seemed to be back in my dream and saw the little girl. She looked really small.

"Thank you for helping us, now...it's my turn to help you." The voice didn't seem to come from her throat, but from dozens of little girls at the same time.

I asked her what I should do, and she said I needed to keep walking, keep walking, and I couldn't let go of her hand or ask questions during the process. Don't look back.

So I take her hand, and I heard a voice from behind that I still don't know how to describe, but my intuition told me that I couldn't look back, otherwise I would die, and she said, "Don't be afraid."

I don't know how long I walked, I was panting, and when I felt that my legs could no longer move another meter, I saw the light.

"See you on the other side." She waved at me, and I vaguely saw a woman more than two meters tall standing behind the little girl, but seeing her was not scary, but reassuring.

When I woke up, I found myself in the hospital, and the village chief was there. There were also a few policemen, who told me that my husband was dead. 

Police said since he owed a gambling debt of 100,000 and bought me an insurance policy (but he was stupid enough to fill in the wrong name,He wrote me as the beneficiary), they thought that he was trying to murder me, so when he pushed me off the cliff, he also slipped and fell down. The statue was broken, and he seemed to be broken more than the statue.

I was shocked by the news and wanted to get up, but I couldn't get up because of the pain. Then they said that my pelvis was broken, and it was a miracle that the kid was still alive. I asked, what kid?

They said that because we hadn't returned for three hours, the village chief had someone look for us. Finally, she was the first to find me under the cliff.

When they found me, my lower body was bleeding. When they rushed me to the hospital, they found that I was already eight months pregnant. Logically, the baby should have suffocated to death or miscarried, but she cried very loudly after the doctor pulled her out. It was just because she was born prematurely that she was very thin. After checking the baby's health, they confirmed that it was actually a healthy baby.

I asked, can I hold the child? Doctor said of course, so I held my daughter, and she was as soft and warm as I imagined countless times in my dream

I just remembered that I never had a chance to ask the little girl her name, but maybe she just didn't have a name.

Because this matter was really bizarre, I received at least half a month of invitations for news reports. I chose a newspaper that was most reliable in name lists and said the name of the god, thanking her for blessing me, and finally attracted the research of folklore experts. 

As for my husband, oh my ex-husband, I really wanted him to be dead,but he is already dead, and I can't let him dead again.

I asked the village chief what should I do of my ex husband's dead body. She thought that although my husband had done many evil things, he was a child of the village after all, so he should be buried in the village anyway. 

We wanted to bury him casually near the temple on the mountain, but unfortunately it rained heavily the day after my accident, which triggered a small mudslide, destroyed the temple, and also destroyed the old tombstones of several craftsmen in the village cemetery. 

The women in the village were discussing how to rebuild it. After all, it was a lot of money, and they didn't have time to care where a scumbag was buried. The village chief said she would take care of it, and I didn't have to care.

When I left the village with my parents, I asked the village chief if she felt ok, and she said she had a premonition that everything already happened in her dream. She also said that I was welcome to come back next year. 

I took away a portrait of the god and a small wood carving of her.

Later I heard that he was hastily buried in the cemetery near the village. 

At that time, I had moved back to my parents' house because I couldn't walk at least for a few months and my daughter was too young. I found an easy job at home, the salary was a little lower then my old job, but I didn't worry about the income, after all, although he was a scumbag, he left me millions of insurance money.
