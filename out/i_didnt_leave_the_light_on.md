today my neighbour of 4 years is moving. she didnt even talk to me, i found out when she started the packing up her belongings and putting them into her car. i tried to strike up a conversation but she just gave me a tight smile.

“can i help with anything?” i offered

“no, its fine thanks” she replied, bluntly.

later that day her and her husband drove off for good.

it was sudden, but we were never very close and i assume theyve been planning this for a while. good for them.

i sit in my lounge wondering what to do for the rest of the evening. maybe i’ll just order chinese and watch some tv. shit. right. i misplaced the remote. ah well i’ll just watch netflix i guess.

a few weeks later another neighbour put their house up for sale. it was a flat shared by four professional 20-something-year olds. i guess its good weather and stuff so it kind of makes sense that people are selling right now.

weirdly enough last night i got this weird smell, something metallic, as i lay in bed. not sure what that was.

the next morning i came downstairs and one of the chairs was pulled out from the table, even though i couldve sworn i tucked it in. maybe im just being silly, i mean i probably just was tired and forgot to put it back before going to bed.

but i couldnt help but feel a little uncomfortable that day. as much as i want to, i really dont think i left that chair there.

today i caught up with my friend natalie for a coffee. her boyfriend proposed and theyre planning the wedding. they want to go to bali for a honeymoon, which sounds nice. she said i seemed a little off, and i admitted ive been feeling a but nervous recently. i told nat ive been thinking of investing in a security camera, and she said if it makes me feel better, but shes a little concerned it will just feed into my anxiety.

i guess shes right, plus being realistic it would be a waste of money anyway, and moneys already a little tight right now.

its been getting worse, ive started to hear footsteps some nights, but i never see anyone. small things seem to be out of place but nothings missing and all my doors are locked. i think i should talk to someone about this, im concerned about this.

its been a week and ive scheduled an appointment with my psychiatrist. i mean i know i have anxiety, thats nothing new, but this paranoia isnt normal and i need to get to the bottom of it. my third close neighbour miguel is apparently talking about wanting to move, but he hasnt said anything to me about it. apparently his kids are having trouble sleeping because of noise or something. i dont exactly know what he means, but its understandable.

today when i came downstairs in the morning, the light in the kitchen was on. i know i didnt leave it on, i even switch it on last night, i didnt even cook. a chill ran down my spine but i can just wait for my appointment, its only a few days away now.

today i walked out to miguel, as he hauled boxes into the moving van. hes a friendly man, but he seemed a little awkward now.

“hey so, how comes everyones moving right now? is there something up with this area or what?” i ask

he shoots me a sideways glance as he begins, before closing his mouth again and frowning. “well you know, its been waking us up a lot, its just been so noisy. ever since, well…”

“ever since what?”

“well i dont mean to judge, but ever since… well…” he trailed off uncomfortably.

“what are you talking about? ever since what?”

his wife and son approached with armloads more stuff and he stopped talking, shaking his head. “look im sorry its probably personal, i’ll just text you to explain later”

“okay…” i felt uneasy for the rest of the day. what was so personal he couldnt tell me then?

later that night, as i sit in bed watching netflix (not the tv, since i still havent found the remote), my phone pings. its miguel. im not even sure why hes up its past midnight, its 1:42am to be exact. but i open it anyway.

“hey its miguel :) sorry i couldnt say earlier, but the kids have been having trouble sleeping since that noise started at night”

“what noise?”

“i mean its not my business why he’s there, im not judging, but its ever since you started letting that man in through your balcony door in the early hours.” i stopped reading, fingers shaking. this has to be a joke. please be a fucking unfunny joke.

i took a deep, ragged breath, and i noticed that awful metallic smell again.

thats when i heard it.

the click of the balcony door lock undoing, and the door creaking open.
