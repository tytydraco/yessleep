 

A solitary rain drop assaulted my forehead. Followed by another. And another. Soon a soft pitter-patter of droplets began falling all around me, pulling me back to consciousness.

I glanced down at the half empty liquor bottle in my hand and then turned to the sky. An angry black cumulonimbus cloud loomed overhead, threatening to spill its contents onto my cabin cruiser at a moment’s notice. The boat was already swaying back and forth as gravity began a violent match of tug-of-war with the waves. 

“Fucking hell,” I grunted as I attempted to stand. 

I hurriedly ducked into the cabin and plopped down in the driver’s seat. I tossed the bottle of whiskey aside, hitting the carpeted floor with a soft thud. I promptly started the engine and slammed the vessel into drive. The rain was picking up already. 

“Hey man, what’s happening?” John wondered aloud as he groggily rubbed his eyes. 

“What the hell does it look like?” I grumbled impatiently. 

“We’re in the middle of the fucking ocean and this storm is approaching faster than Frank if we were college girls,” I chuckled to myself, but John didn’t find it amusing. 

His eyes grew wide as dinner plates as he uttered, “oh fuck. Davy, I thought you were supposed to be on deck watching for clouds or some shit.” 

“Yeah well, that was the plan until Mr. Jameson got involved,” I muttered, nodding toward the bottle of booze rolling across the floor. 

“I heeeard what you saiiid about me,” Frank slurred as he stumbled toward the steering station. 

“Go back to sleep Frank, you’re drunk,” I ordered. 

“You too John, I got everything under control.” 

“You don’t teeeell me what to doooo. I’ll do what-” Frank was interrupted mid-sentence as a lightning bolt cracked through the air, sending thunder echoing around the cabin. 

“Okay I’m going, but only because *I* want to,” he spat. 

“Big baby,” I mumbled as he slunk off to bed. 

After a little over an hour we finally reached a rocky coastline. We were cruising parallel to the shore, only about a fifteen minute ride from our destination when it happened. The water grew choppy and the wind howled savagely. Clouds covered every inch of the sky. Without warning, rain pounded down from the heavens in sheets, brutally slapping against the windshield. My visibility suddenly tanked. My heart smacked against my ribcage, attempting to escape from my chest. Sweat pooled above my brow, but I kept my composure. We were in deep shit and now was not the time to panic. 

“John, get your ass up here!” I barked as he swiftly flew to the helm of the boat. 

“I’m here. What do you need me to do?” he asked, his stern countenance undermined by the unease lurking behind his words. 

“Turn on the radio and try to reach the coast guard,” I requested as John started fiddling with the controls. 

I provided him thorough instructions as he obediently carried out his task. 

“Good, now that you’ve got it working, hold it up to my mouth,” I urged. 

I clutched the steering wheel so tightly that my knuckles were turning white as I struggled to maintain control of the vessel. John extended the radio so far that it lightly grazed my beard. 

“Not that close you dingbat,” I chastised as he retracted his hand slightly. 

“Perfect. Now hold down the button on the side,” I directed. 

“Hello, can anyone hear me? This is David Jones of the Queen Elizabeth’s Revenge, please come in… hello, can anyone hear me? *Anyone*, do you copy?” 

Nothing but static flowed from the device. 

“Shit shit shit,” I frustratedly seethed. 

The boat was vigorously tossed from side to side as unrelenting waves continually clobbered the stern. It was only a matter of time before we’d be dragged onto the jagged unforgiving beachfront. Or worse, we could capsize. I had to think fast. I frantically scanned my surroundings for something, anything that might offer a sliver of hope. And then I spotted it. Our salvation.

Barely visible through the onslaught of rain, a vast cavern lay embedded into the shore. I thrust the throttle forward, my eyes glued to the opening. 

“What is it? What do you see?” John asked anxiously. 

“Over there. See that cave opening? If we can just make it in there we should be able to wait out the storm or at least hunker down until help arrives,” I explained, attempting to mask the dismay in my voice. 

“Hey, what’s goinnn on out here?” 

“SHUT UP FRANK!” John and I screamed in unison. 

Frank murmured incoherently to himself as he disappeared back into the sleeping quarters. The entrance was rapidly approaching. Just as I thought we might be in the clear, a massive wave battered the starboard bow, sending John and me crashing into the wall.  

Random items from around the cabin were flung everywhere. It was as if a tiny tornado had ransacked the room, leaving a disgruntled captain and one hell of a mess in its wake. 

“Holy shit,” I croaked. 

A throbbing pain sent shock waves searing through my lower back. I brushed it off the best I could and scrambled to my feet, hastily reclaiming my chair. I was granted a brief moment of repose when I noted that we miraculously hadn’t capsized. I steeled my resolve and channeled all my remaining energy into getting us to safety. We weren’t out of the danger zone yet.  

“What the fuck was that?” John groaned as he wearily stood. 

I disregarded his question and kept my eyes locked on the cave. Out of my peripheral vision I could make out the hulking form of another enormous surge of water quickly approaching. We were so close. Just a little further. 

My hands ached from how tightly I gripped the steering wheel, but I didn’t dare loosen my grasp. The colossal beast had grown to a staggering height, its crest eager to smash our little boat to bits. I only saw two possible outcomes. Either we made it into the cavern unharmed, or we’d be dashed against the rocks like a housefly in a window sill. I pushed the craft to its limit, catapulting us forward on sheer will power. 

“Come on, come on,” I breathed through clenched teeth. 

The wave crashed down behind us, barely avoiding a catastrophe, and propelled us into the alcove. I let out a breath I didn’t know I’d been holding and eased off the throttle. I glanced over to John as a smile inched its way across my face. The color began to flush back into his features and he stared at me slack-jawed, speechless after witnessing the incredible feat I had just accomplished. 

“We fuckin did it buddy!” I yelled, overcome with gracious reverence to whatever deity had decided to spare our lives. John rose to his feet. He silently shuffled over and threw his arms around me. 

“You fucking saved us,” he uttered through joyous tears. 

“You bet your ass I did. Now go check on Frank,” I commanded as he released me from his iron grip.

I stationed the boat and allowed myself a moment to soak in our surroundings. My eyes took a bit to adjust to the inky darkness. The cave was spacious. The entrance, however, was a lot more narrow than I had initially realized, which would work to our advantage. It could offer adequate protection from the elements until the storm relented. The ceiling must have been at least five stories high. Hundreds of stalactites adorned its surface like glistening icicles overhead. A small beach area lined the back wall and it appeared to tunnel deep into the earth. A growing sense of trepidation bubbled inside me the longer I gazed into it. 

The alcove was dimly lit, but that section was *too* dark. I couldn’t shake this intense feeling of dread and my mind began conjuring up images of whatever archaic malevolent force dwelled within, hoping, praying for some unlucky soul to wander inside so it could tear them limb from limb. 

“Can you believe that bastard slept through the entire thing? Had to make sure he wasn’t dead,” John scoffed as he reemerged, successfully snapping me from my trance. 

“Seriously? We could’ve been fish food and he would’ve been none the wiser,” I chuckled wryly. 

John and I spent the next hour cleaning up the cabin while Frank snored obnoxiously loudly from the other room. Once we were finished, John joined me on the deck. The storm hadn’t let up, the rain somehow hammering down even harder than before. Again, I found myself transfixed on the impossibly black void. 

“Fucking creepy isn’t it?” John asked grimly. 

“That’s the understatement of the century,” I muttered meekly. 

“I’m tired. I’m off to bed. Let me know who wins the staring contest,” he quipped. 

John hadn’t been gone for two minutes when I heard it. Soft low melodic notes drifted gracefully to my ears, a feathery soprano emerging from somewhere in the unknown. I had never heard anything so breathtakingly beautiful in my entire life. I strained to listen, forcing my ears to perceive every word, every tiny vibration of those majestic vocal chords. I floated toward the source of the enthralling music. My legs had a mind of their own. 

I opened my eyes as I caught myself climbing over the edge of the boat. I clamored back up and collapsed, panting as my chest suddenly tightened. Black spots dotted my vision. I couldn’t hear it anymore. I kept my ears perked up in terrified apprehension. Nothing. Only the thunderous rain was audible in the eerily silent chamber. 

“Must be losin it,” I murmured as I dragged myself inside. 

“Davy! Davy wake the fuck up!” I was jostled out of my fitful slumber as John shook me awake. 

“Davy, it’s Frank. He’s not here,” he whispered frantically. 

“Did you check the toilet? Frank hurry up in there, John needs to shit!” I hollered, receiving no response. 

“I’ve checked everywhere. He isn’t on the boat,” he insisted gravely, distress overtaking his countenance. 

“He probably went exploring or something. We’ll go looking for him in the morning if he doesn’t turn up,” I grumbled. 

John reluctantly conceded and got back in bed. Before nodding off I made sure to put in ear plugs in an attempt to block out any more disturbances. 

I yawned and stretched my arms toward the ceiling. I’d succeeded in gaining some much needed rest. Sunlight filtered in and illuminated the cabin, bathing the room in a warm golden glow. Sunlight. The storm was gone. I pocketed my ear plugs and burst through the door. 

“John! Frank! We beat the storm! Let’s get the fuck outta here!” I cheered, lost in my own delight. 

I was met with deafening silence. 

“John?... Frank? Come on guys, joke’s over. Let’s go home,” I tittered, the horrible realization hitting me like a freight train. 

This was real. My friends had vanished. 

I rushed to the deck, scanning for any sign of my companions. A sinking apprehension bubbled in the pit of my stomach as my gaze connected with that oppressively dark pit embedded in the rock. Even in the daylight it swallowed up any source of light, radiating despair and abject hopelessness like nuclear waste. I knew what I had to do.

I took a long pull from the bottle of Jameson. “Little liquid courage never hurt anyone,” I determined, readying myself for my perilous journey. 

Armed with my bowie knife and a flashlight, and mustering every ounce of bravery I had, I set off. I’d barely stepped two feet out onto the deck when I froze. My blood ran cold and my heart thumped in my ears. The singing had returned. 

Mesmerizing notes in a language I didn’t recognize emanated from the abyss, paralyzing me with their spellbinding elegance. I was completely captivated. I would have been content standing there listening to that glorious melody for the rest of my days. And then she emerged.

A woman gradually approached the boat, light graceful footfalls almost imperceptible over her graceful song. Her appearance was absolutely enchanting. Jet black hair cascaded down her back in waves. Her petite hourglass frame resembled something out of a magazine. Her stark white gown hugged her body in all the right places, exposing her luscious curves. And she was incredibly gorgeous. Her deep blue eyes connected with mine, perfect teeth smiling up at me as she captured my heart. I drifted toward her, hypnotized by her riveting beauty. She reached the water’s edge and I watched as it splashed her feet. She immediately recoiled, hissing at the undesired contact.

I was torn from my stupor as a deep fear crawled through my bones. This was all wrong. That woman shouldn’t be here. I felt helpless. No matter what I did she would surely lure me back with her enrapturing lyrics. And then it hit me. My only shot at redemption. 

I snatched the ear plugs from my pocket and jammed them into my ears before the woman had an opportunity to recover. I glanced up. Her features had twisted and distorted. Her beautiful face withered away into a gaunt haggard shell. Skin stretched tightly over jagged bones. Her teeth had decayed, hideous yellows and browns jutting out from her rotten black gums. Hollow sunken pits where her eyes should have been bored into my skull, resonating desolation and loathing hatred. Suddenly, she unleashed an ear splitting shriek. 

I screamed in agony as her shrill screech reverberated through my core, shaking the very fiber of my being. I threw my hands over my ears and crumpled to my knees. The ear plugs did little good to shield me from the relentless explosion of sound. Something warm began to trickle from my ears. My vision grew blurry and the world went dark.

I awoke in a hospital bed. The coast guard had sent out a search team after we were reported missing. I had been found two days later, incapacitated on the deck. I suffered severe hearing loss and I’m now completely deaf in my left ear. 

The authorities searched every inch of that cave, but John and Frank were never located. Their families are still hopeful that they’ll turn up, but I don’t have the heart to tell them that they won’t ever be coming back. What haunts me the most isn’t the disappearance of my friends or whatever that was lurking in the darkness. No, what torments me every waking moment, is that god forsaken voice that I can’t erase from my head.
