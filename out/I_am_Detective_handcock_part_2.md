"Yes his name was victor mendez. We were able to identify him by his dental records. Hancock leaned forward in his chair. How long was it from the time he went missing and when he was thrown through the window?"

Cindy shifted in her seat. “Umm i can't be sure but i think it was only maybe five minutes. Everything seemed so fast. I don't know what could have done that to him”

Isaiah spoke up suddenly. “Are you sure about the time frame? I know this might be hard to hear the coroner said he was expertly skinned. It was border line surgical. His skin was just peeled off the way you would take off your coat."

“Isaiah!” Hancock shouted. 
 
Isaiah threw his hands up in surrender. “I'm sorry I'm just trying to figure out how a man is, undressed, skinned and thrown through a window in under five minutes.

Hancock leaned in close to Isaiah and whispered. "This girl has been through alot and she is our only eye witness. Take it easy." Hancock’s deep blue eyes burning into him. Isaiah shook his head in silent shame.

"I'm sorry ms.Tallulah. I didn't mean nothing by it."

Hancock cleared his throat. “So what happened after that?”

“He started to go crazy,” Cindy said, wiping her eyes with her sleeve. “He just kept screaming what the fuck is that? Then he turned to me and shouted.”Who's doing this?”  “Who's out there?” "Then he pointed the revolver at me. I swore I didn't know. I begged him not to hurt me.”

“He ran out of the room and I heard a door slam out in the warehouse and then some commotion outside. I realized this might be my only chance to free my mom and brother. I ran over to them and started trying to untie them. My mom kept whispering for me to just run but I could leave them.”

"I was almost finished with the knot in the rope around my mom’s hands when my dad was shoved through the door. The man that had left with my father had returned. The mask with the jagged teeth pulled up over his face.

“What the fuck is going on here?” What is that? He held a duffle bag in one hand and a shotgun in the other . "when he came into the room I thought he would kill us all. Cindy said in a half sob.  "The man who had run out peaked through the door." "He is dead, man. That thing on the ground is victor."



The body was missing. I guess when I turned my back to untie my mom. Someone took it. There is no way he could have been alive. “He was just there” The man with the cartoonish skull said walking the rest of the way into the room. He pointed to a bloody trail leading to the window. Holding the shotgun inches from my dads face. 

The man known as Marco shouted  “who's out there?”

He kicked my father in the ribs. “What kind of game are you playing?”

“He didn't do anything” I shouted “we dont know whats going on. Marco walked over and put his face an inch from mine. “It's a shame.” “you and your family almost made it out of this. Now I'm going to go out there and find your friend. I'm going to bring him in here and kill him in front of all of you. Then I will deal with you one by one.

“Did he never pull down his mask?” Hancock said, writing something down on his notepad. 

No, I couldn't tell much about his face. His mask was pulled up over his nose and he wore sunglasses. 

Marco turned to the other man and said. “Let's go.” “Go where.” he replied, trembling with fear. “We are going out there and finding whoever is doing this?” “Let's just leave them man, we got the money.”

“Marco roughly pushed the other man out the door and he turned back to us. I have the keys to your vehicle. If any of you leave this room I will put you down. There is nowhere to run. With that they left the room.”

“We all gathered in the middle of the floor and held each other tightly. The entercom crackled to life. It started to play this creepy old song”

“Do you remember the song or what it said?” Hancock offered.

“I think the chorus said only the lonely over and over again.”

“Ahh the Roy Orbison song, that's a good one.” Isaiah just raises his eyebrows at the older man. As if to say. “If you say so”

The music played loudly through the speakers but I could still hear something. After  I concentrated on the sound. It was screaming like an animal caught in a trap. Now I know it wasn't an animal at all, it was those men. The song ended and all was silent. I started to hear a faint squeaking like a mouse getting closer. Then a lump of jingling metal fell from the same vent as the phone earlier. I walked over and realized it was a set of blood soaked car keys. Our car keys!

"I grabbed them and untied my family. We carefully crept through the warehouse. We timidly looked out the exit. We saw no one and we made a dash for the van. As we all piled in the van something caught my eye. There was a man hanging from a nearby tree from one foot. I sat up and studied him. I could now see his eyes had been cut out. 

“That was Tim Patton, the man with the cartoonish skull mask.” Hancock says. “I guess so Cindy reptiles. We drove straight to the police station after that. 

"The man known as Marco has not been found. So you didn't see him again after he walked out of that room. "

"No, I don't know what happened to him. I think he's probably dead. What makes you think that? Asks Isaiah. Cindy says coldly. “Look what happened to the other two.” 

Hancock stands and pushes in his chair. “I need a moment of fresh air.” he leaves the two sitting at the table.

Handcock burst through the door of the interview room. “Sorry I got my wires crossed." Went to the wrong interview room."He chuckled uncharacteristically.

“Is there anything else you want to ask Cindy Hancock?” Handcock just sat there looking down at the table as if he didnt hear him. “Hey did you hear me” Isaiah patted him on the shoulder. Handcock turned and looked at Isaiah, his eyes a dull yellow. The last few buttons of his shirt were undone and there just below his neck was a teardrop shaped scar. Isaiah had never noticed this scar.

“Yes i am detective Handcock” he replied. 

 Everything was different after that day. I know it sounds crazy but this man has been my partner for two years. I know this isn't the man I know.  The moment he walked back in the interview room something was off. From the moment we met he called me by my first name. Since he walked back in the room that day he's called me Toadvine.  He never used to call me by my last name.

I have to get to the bottom of this but where to start.
