  

I guess it started during the pandemic. Working from home, boredom. A no longer sexually active wife it's so tiring being a nurse. No time for me, no sex, no love.  
 

I was accused of being selfish, but I needed attention, and I didnâ€™t care from who, I wanted to be wanted and my wife was looking tired and older. From stress? Perhaps. But I knew what she used to look like, and I knew guys wanted her when she was younger.  
   
 

I began to look for something new and exciting, someone who'd want me. But I'm no   
 cheat. This would all be fantasy, taboo.   
 

I looked at photos of my wife before. She was stunning, and maybe other people would enjoy her as well. What harm could it do? Just a few strangers admiring my wife. It would give me a confidence boost knowing how wanted and desired she was, it would turn me on knowing they wanted to please her.

 I met people online, they asked for her photos, I obliged, they enjoyed and desired her and I enjoyed knowing that she was mine and so many strangers wanted her.

I began taking more photos of her without her knowledge. Every day, a new account, every day, a new person wanting her. But she was mine all mine

 I'd receive photos of a sexual nature from strangers. "Send this to your wife." I kept it for myself. Sometimes, they'd ask for photos of me. I'd respond in kind. I didn't find them attractive, but it was nice to be wanted, to be desired. My loneliness just continued, and my special online friends were very nice to me, they made me feel special, my wife just worked and worked. 

 One guy in particular wanted my wife. He asked her name and where she was from. Where was the harm, right? He offered money for information on her. He was paying top dollar for these photos. Why shouldn't I take it up a notch. Enjoy her. I certainly used to. And the money would be better in my pocket than his.

 More photos, more information, more money. My brain so wrapped up in my customers I no longer had time to make love, I could only perform after speaking to my friends.

 Eventually, the pandemic ends. I go back to the office, and things quieten down. Things are good at home. I stopped the photos and the payments. My main customer isn't happy. But what is he going to do.

 I come home from work one day to an empty house. No signs of a break-in, no signs of a struggle, but she's gone. It's just me alone.

 The police have questioned me, I told them nothing about my online life, I was very careful, my phone is clean, I used back ups that no one knows about. 

 So now I see her every day. On the news, on billboards, on missing posters. Was it worth it to get my fix. The whole world gets to see how beautiful she was. I still receive money from well wishers and the media for stories. Everything is going to be okay.
