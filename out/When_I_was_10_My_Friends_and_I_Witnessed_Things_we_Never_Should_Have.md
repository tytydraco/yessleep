I'm sure if you lived in a small town like me, you had some sort of urban legend, too. Maybe it was that the old man up the road killed his wife. Maybe it was a scary clown living in a gutter who killed kids. Whatever it was, it probably got less scary as you grew up and realized it was probably just older kids messing with you. But my town had something different. And I've been keeping it secret for 19 years.

It all started the summer when my friends and I were 10 years old. We spent hours out by the creek, or riding our bikes. It was, by all accounts, a typical childhood summer. Well, that all changed one day.

It was me, my twin brother Ryan, and our friends, Gil, Laura, and Steven. We were exploring the woods trying to find a perfect location to build a fort when we saw something strange. A tunnel. It was overgrown and looked to be almost ancient.

"Relax," Steven said, sensing our unease. "It's probably just an old sewer pipe. Or something."

"I don't know, Steve," Gil, our resident nerd, said. "It looks really old, kind of like the ancient temples that I saw in my NatGeo magazine."

"Blah blah blah stupid NatGeo magazine." Steven mocked. "Whatever. It looks cool, let's go in." Before any of us could object, he rushed into the tunnel.

It was decidedly not an old sewer pipe. It went on for seemingly miles, with all sorts of ancient artifacts that I'm certain we probably could've sold to a museum and be set for life. I studied anthropology in university, and the things I saw in here didn't resemble artifacts of any known civilization. That's what frightens me the most.

We finally got to the end of the tunnel. And wouldn't you know it, Gil seemed to be right.

At the end of the tunnel was a room, filled with gold and other offerings. A painting on the wall farthest from us depicted some sort of... monster? Deity? God? I don't even know to describe it. Below the...thing, were humans, bowing down to it. There was writing on the wall, but it was in a language none of us recognize.

"Laura, when you get home, ask your dad for help with whatever this is." Gil said, reaching his hand out and feeling the painting. Laura's dad owned the library in our town and was probably the smartest guy here. (Not a brag, considering our town was in a state with one of the highest illiteracy rates in the country.) Laura nodded.

"I'll take a picture of it and show it to him after mom goes to bed. She thinks I'm mowing my neighbour's lawns right now." She said, pulling her camera out. She took a picture of the writing, but took a few more of the temple.

We left, and kind of thought that was the end. Maybe Laura's dad could figure out what it said, but honestly, I don't think any of us were that invested at this point.

The next day, as Ryan and I were getting dressed and ready for another day of whatever bullshit we had planned to do, my mom called us down.

"Ryan! Michael! Your friend wants to see you!"

We rushed downstairs and were shocked to see Laura, who usually had chores to do in the morning on her uncle's farm and would join us later in the day. She looked out of breath.

"Guys, I have to show you something." She was clutching the photos that she had taken yesterday.

"Did you get your dad to translate it?" Ryan asked.

"Yeah. And I need to tell you. Come on." She pulled us out of our house, where Gil and Steven were already waiting.

"Basically, he said it's some extinct language from the middle east." She explained.

"The middle east? We lived in America." Steven said.

"Yeah, genius, we know. Shut up and let her finish." Gil nudged Steven.

"And there's not really a direct translation, he said, but it basically says that a God who gets forgotten will unleash his wrath on the world by like, destroying worldly treasures and something about making people remember. I'm not sure what they mean."

"Wow. So we found an old temple for a God?" I asked. "We could be rich!"

"Well, that's not all. Look at some of the pictures I took." Laura pulled out some of her pictures.

There was... something in the background. It didn't look like any animal I've ever seen, but it wasn't exactly human either. It was tall, almost too tall for the frame. And it was staring right at us.

"Are you sure that it's not just like, a camera flare or something?" Gil asked.

"Oh yeah, a camera flare that made a creepy monster show up, real smart." Ryan said, pushing Gil.

As we walked around town, theorizing on what it could be, an old pickup truck pulled up next to us.

"Laura, there you are, I've been looking for you everywhere!"

"Oh yeah, sorry uncle I-"

"Whatever. Get in the truck. I need to show you something."

Thankfully, her uncle let us all ride in the back of the truck and go with them.

"I mean, I've seen fucked up creatures be born here, but ain't nothing like this. Pardon my French."

There, in the barn, was a baby goat, or what I assume was once a baby goat. It had sharp teeth, sharper than regular goats, and looked like its bones were all messed up.

"Weird thing is that it's still alive. Usually these things are dead by daylight." Laura's uncle said, bending down to inspect the goat. "Even weirder still, I can't recall any of my goats being pregnant before last night. Like this thing just appeared. Well, I'll be off to milk the cow. Laura, let me know if anything happens to it."

We all just stared at it in silence for a while. Unlike other deformed animals, it seemed to be doing just fine, thriving even.

"This is weird, right? Like, weird weird. Not cool weird." Steven remarked, and for the first time he didn't have anything snarky to say.

"Totally. Maybe it has something to do with that thing we found yesterday." I said.

We were all quiet for a while.

"No, no, it can't be. Just because some goat had a freaky baby doesn't mean the world is ending." Ryan said, walking away from the barn. "Let's go, Michael. This is stupid."

I wish he was right. I would give anything for him to have been right about that. Because the next day, things got weirder for us. And the day after that, and the day after that.

The next day, Ryan and I woke up with scratches all over us. Both of us blamed the other, but I think it was just wishful thinking. Deep down, both of us knew that no kid, or human for that matter, could've made cuts that deep.

It was like a nightmare only my friends and I could witness. Laura's dad's library had its entire religious section set on fire, everything else untouched. There were no signs of break in. Steven, who went to church on Sundays, would wake up extremely ill, only on church days, and be fine on Monday. Gil seemed to have it the worst. We actually didn't see him for a few days, which was out of the ordinary, so we went to check up on him.

We entered his bedroom to find him in the corner, hunched over a book. It was massive and heavy looking.

"Uhhh... Gil?" Steven said, looking concerned, which was unsettling to me because neither of them ever got along very well.

He startled. "Jesus, you scared me. Wait- I shouldn't say that. Guys, come in. I need to tell you something."

Slowly, we all stepped forward, unsure if it was a trap or not.

"I've been studying a lot of religions. I couldn't find anything about that temple we found. It's gotta be a really, really old one. Like, one that got forgotten a long time ago."

"Dude, where is this going?" I asked. It hurt me and Ryan to move a lot, there were scratches everywhere. They seemed to be growing every night.

"So when the writing said that thing about being forgotten and punishing the people who forgot him? It looks like we forgot about whatever this God was a long time ago. And it's mad now. That's it, that's why Steven gets sick before church, that's why your dad's religious books all burned, Laura, and I don't really know what the scratches are doing, but it's gotta be something. Do you guys need bandages or something? Because I have some if you need." Gil explained.

"Uh, yeah, I could probably go for some." Ryan said, lifting his shirt up. I did the same.

"Wait a minute-" Laura said. "Guys, stand like, right next to each other."

Our friends looked at us in shock.

"What, is it bad or something?" I asked.

Gil pushed us towards his mirror. Then, we saw why they were so scared.

This whole time, we hadn't seen it, and it had been right under our noses- literally.

Across both of our chests, the scratches made a shape. It was... a face? But it looked familiar.

"Laura, do you still have those pictures you took in the temple?"

She pulled them out of her pocket.

That monster in the background of the picture she took. It was there. The same faces, on our skin and in the photo.

"Okay, this is messed up, man. I- I gotta go." Steven stammered, and he ran out of Gil's room.

We watched him run away through Gil's window.

"I'm scared." He said sheepishly. "I feel like we did something by going in that temple. Something bad."

The next day, I guess he was proven right. Steven didn't get home last night. There was a whole search for him and everything. No sign of him anywhere.

That night, Gil, Laura, Ryan and I all met up at Laura's uncle's farm. We walked through the fields, trying to clear our heads.

Suddenly, we heard a weird noise from the barn. As we went in to investigate, we saw that weird deformed goat again. Even though it was only a few weeks old, it already looked fully grown. It looked at us. I don't know how to explain it, but its eyes... they didn't look like a normal animal's eyes. It pushed past us, and started to walk away.

I honestly have no idea what came over the four of us. With everything that was going on, we probably weren't in the right headspace, plus us being stupid 10 year olds didn't help.

We followed it all the way into the woods, and back where it all started. That god forsaken tunnel we never should have gone down. As the deformed, spiny goat led us down, we heard something. Chanting.

At the end, in the room with the painting, was Steven. He was moving, bowing down to the deity, just like all of the people in the painting were, and chanting in some strange language, but he didn't look alive. His eyes seemed dead, like he was possessed.

"...Steven?" Laura said finally.

He looked up at us, tears in his eyes and shook his head.

It took us until then to realize the goat was gone.  I opened my eyes for just a second, a choice I regret all the time. In it's place, I saw something I'm not sure I can explain, to this day.

It was the thing in the picture. Horns, like a goat, massive in stature. The same thing on the painting.

It was The God.

"Guys..." I said under my breath. "We have to go. Leave as quietly as you can, I'll get Steven."

Laura and Gil began to sneak out of the temple, but Ryan stopped me.

"I'm helping, too."

Together, we tried to grab Steven, who was bowing to the god. It towered over us, seemingly basking in the feeling of being worshipped again. "Come on, dude. Let's go." Ryan said, trying to pull him up. Steven looked at us for a moment, shaking his head again.

"You heard that stupid thing Laura's dad translated. If it gets forgotten bad shit will keep happening. As long as I'm here, it's not forgotten. Go. Just go! I promise it'll be okay."

"What? No, I can't leave you, you're my friend." I said,

"And you're MY friends, dude. This is what friends are for. This is gonna sound stupid but I love you guys. Please go, I don't want you getting hurt."

Ryan and I stood in silence, not wanting to leave him.

"Are you deaf? Go, I said, go! Before it makes you stay, too!"

We ran, only looking back when we were fully out, Gil and Laura waiting for us.

"Thanks, Steve." I said, holding back tears

All the adults told us the same thing. That we had seen something we shouldn't have and that whatever we think we saw was just our brains trying to protect us from what actually happened. That they searched all over the woods, and that there was no temple. Laura's dad and uncle didn't even believe us. They chalked it up to our imagination.

Life went on, and we all grew apart, only seeing each other a few times a year. We don't really talk about that summer much. I mean, we all think about it, sure, but I don't think any of us want to be reminded of it. One day, we had met up for dinner at Gil's place, and he wanted to show us something.

In his basement, was a shrine. A painting of that fucking entity decorated the walls. His two young kids sat, praying to it.

"Dude what the fuck?" Laura asked. "This is insane."

"No, no, you guys don't get it. What Steven did was great, and it bought us some time, but he's not going to live forever. What happens in 20, 30 years when he dies, huh? He'll be forgotten. What happens when we die? As long as he's not forgotten, we're safe, right? Now sit down with us, and pray."

"I'm not going to-"

"PRAY!" Gil demanded.

Laura, Ryan and I got out of there pretty quick.

So, why am I writing this? Well, that thing's rules were pretty clear. As long as he's remembered, everything is fine. And there's nothing more permanent than writing. So, if by some off chance somebody finds this at some point in time, maybe think a bit about what you remember and what you forget.
