Do you ever get that feeling that you’re being watched? The rational part of your brain has its say, and you know that it’s ridiculous to *feel* being watched. But still, just a lingering dread that puts you on edge and sets goosebumps all over. 3 days ago this feeling started, and it would just be intermittently throughout the day. I’d be having lunch and all of a sudden feel, I don't know, violated? Then the feeling would dissipate and I'd shake it off as nerves or stress or some other self diagnosing buzzword. The nights were hard. Around 9pm or 10pm it was constant. It felt close. Like someone was in the room with me. I couldn’t sleep that first night and stayed up watching TV.

When morning came I noticed the bruise. It was on the inner side of my left arm, stretching across the bicep and forearm. It was a large oval shape, and purple in the centre with blackened edges that faded into my skin. I decided to call off work for health reasons and see if I could get some rest, but I just…couldn’t? I felt tired, I *was* tired. I’d lie down for hours with drowsy and heavy eyes, rotting away in bed, the occasional wisp of fear shooting through me as I could sense my unseen stalker. I decided to try a couple of sleeping pills but still I’d lay there. Awake, active, afraid. *Afraid?* Afraid of what? I thought I was crazy. I mean, part of me still thinks I *am* crazy. But after that second night there’s no doubt in my mind that something is watching me. Something is *after* me. 

That evening the corner of my bedroom felt occupied. The source of my irrational fears concentrated in that empty space. I held my eyes shut and tried to ignore its gaze, the still silence occasionally interrupted by a stream of howling wind. Restless, I writhed around in my sheets, prodding a tender pain on my bruised arm. As I shifted, so did the eying intruder. The derivation of that stare began to trace around the room. I opened my eyes only to sense a halt in its movement, closer now, situated directly across from the foot of my bed.  

Fatigue crept in, my keen alertness overshadowed by a sudden desire to fall into a deep sleep. My eyelids fluttered as I drew a yawn, an unnatural shift from the past 40 hours of inability to be half this dozy. It didn’t feel right. I used what strength I had remaining to sit up and stumble out of bed, only to find myself giving at the knees the moment I tried to balance upwards. I had laid there sideways, on my floor, I could feel the oncoming fog of slumber. I’m not sure how long I was there, and I don’t know if I was dreaming, but I swear that I heard a whisper. *My name*. My full name. I shot awake. I was on my back now, and wriggling around my mouth were two fingers. I let out a muffled cry, I was pinned to the ground by this thing, its palm cupping my chin as it violently dug deeper down my throat. My eyes were still shut, and my eyelids felt as if they had weights attached to the lashes. I thrashed at my assailant but only struck air. As a last ditch effort I gripped my eyelid. I couldn’t pull it up so I pinched the centre and stretched it outwards. The room just barely faded into my vision, and I felt the fingers slither out of my mouth. No longer held by an invisible force, I stood up, and I could sense its predatory leer back in the corner. It was waiting. Waiting for me to fall asleep. 

It's 3am right now. I’m feeling sluggish. And I can feel it staring at the back of my head.
