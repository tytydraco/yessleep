People around Clinton, Illinois still say her name like a bad memory — Imogen Blue.

Funny thing is, not many of them even remember much about her. That’s how it is with small-town ghosts. The longer they’re dead, the fuzzier the facts get, until all that’s left is the feeling of them. A chill up your spine in the kitchen at night. A sound on the stairs when no one’s home. The creak of old floorboards like something breathing right beneath your feet.

Imogen Blue lived alone in the house on Kleemann Road — that sagging old farmhouse with its peeling white paint and crooked screen door that never sat right on its hinges. Folks used to say she’d lived there all her life. Born in that house. Died in it too.

Some said Imogen went strange near the end. Started talking to herself on the front porch, rocking in that old wooden chair long past sunset. Said she could see things in the fields that nobody else could. Things with long fingers. Things with yellow eyes.

But it wasn’t the fields that kept her up at night.

It was the house.

⸻

If you live there long enough — if you stay in that house after dark — you’ll meet Imogen Blue sooner or later.

It starts the same way every time. Real quiet. Real polite.

The slow, deliberate sound of footsteps on the stairs. Up and down. Up and down. Like pacing. Like waiting.

And you’ll tell yourself it’s the house settling. It’s the wind. It’s a dream.

Until the doors start to slam.

Hard enough to rattle pictures on the walls. Hard enough to make your heart jump sideways in your chest.

Not the wind. Not a draft. Not mice or creaky boards.

It’s her.

Sometimes — if you’re unlucky enough to be awake in the dead middle of the night — you’ll hear the front door go first. That sharp CRACK of it snapping shut like a trap. Then the footsteps start. Heavy. Deliberate. No rush. Up the stairs… pause… down the stairs… pause… again and again until you feel like you’re going crazy.

People who’ve stayed there say she’s angry. Not sad. Not lost. Angry.

Because Imogen Blue didn’t want company when she was alive. And she sure as hell doesn’t want it now.

⸻

But the part nobody tells you — the part that keeps you staring at the ceiling long after the footsteps stop — is what happens when the house goes quiet.

See, Imogen’s a creature of habit. She likes her patterns. She likes her stomping and her door-slamming and her pacing.

But every now and then… it just stops.

Silence. A dead, waiting kind of silence.

That’s when you know she’s left the stairs.

That’s when you know she’s standing right outside your door.

Breathing. Waiting.

Maybe deciding.

My grandmother used to say ghosts like Imogen Blue don’t stay behind because they’re trapped. They stay because they want to. Because they’ve carved themselves into the bones of a place so deep, they’ve forgotten how to leave.

Imogen Blue died alone in that farmhouse. They say it was years before anyone even noticed.

But if you sleep there tonight — if you sit there long enough with the lights off — you’ll learn the same lesson we all did.

She’s not lonely anymore.

She’s listening.

And someday soon…
She’s going to open your door.
