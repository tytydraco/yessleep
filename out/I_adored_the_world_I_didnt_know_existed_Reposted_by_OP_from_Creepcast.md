I really appreciate all the people who took the time to read this story. This story is based off an actual case that happened. Its called the Fritzl case, if you are interested and would like to learn more about it. I am only 13 years old and watch the show with my dad pretty often. If you read my story on the show I would really appreciate it. This is Part 1 out of a multiple part series. If you would like me to make more, comment or vote in the poll.

At the time of typing this, I am 16 years old and I'm about to turn 17.  The story I am telling you all today takes place 7 years ago.  If you are sensitive to topics of suicide, drug abuse, and child abuse, I strongly suggest to not read.  The story I am telling is exactly what happened, nothing is a lie.  Without further warning, this is what happened.

I woke to the sound of my alarm clock to what it says 7:00 A.M. I jumped out of bed because, at the time, I was pretty short. I found my way to the light switch and flipped it on. The room wasn't anything special. It just had a bed, a little table, sink, toilet, and a mirror. There was also the door that Papa used to bring me food and my medicine.

Papa never really said much when he came, except on some nights I'll sit on his lap tell me a story. My favorite one is "The Soldier and The Snake". Its about a soldier marching into a swamp and meeting a snake. The snake speaks to the soldier about riches beyond anyone persons' desire under the swamp. Excited, the soldier jumps into the water. He swims deeper and deeper. Eventually, the water pressure starts to hurt him, but driven by greed and determination, the soldier swims on. He eventually passes out and drowns in the water and floats up to the top. The snake chuckles and says, " Never be determine if it kills you to get what you want."

I was washing my face in the sink when Papa opened the door and walked in. He was holding a bowl of cereal and my medicine. "Hi Papa," I said. He didn't say a word. He set the bowl on the table and just stood there, staring at my medicine in his hand. He looked like a mix between anger and sadness. His eyes were bloodshot and tired. I walked up behind him and put my hand on his back. He whipped around and struck me on my face. I fell backward with tears and, instinctively, started kicking at him from the ground. He dropped to his knees and wrapped his hands around my throat. I couldn't breathe and all I could do was kick. Since I was only 10 and not very strong, I couldn't get away.

Right when it felt like it was gonna pass out, he stopped. He took his hands off and got up from his knees. He took one last look at me and I saw tears in his eyes. He ran off, slamming the door with such force that the mirror fell. Pieces of glass went everywhere. I slowly stood up, massaging my neck. Still shocked at what just happened, I went over to the table and sat down. I looked at the cereal which was grey and didn't look very appetizing, but still it's all I have. Once I finished, I took my pills with the milk from the bowl, then walked over to the fallen mirror and gasped. Where the mirror had once been, was a door just big enough for me to fit through. I shakily reached for the knob and opened it. It swung open revealing a dark hallway.

It had wallpaper with trees on it and was illuminated by dim hung light. I took one last look at the room I had spent 10 years of my life in, took a deep breath, and stepped in.
