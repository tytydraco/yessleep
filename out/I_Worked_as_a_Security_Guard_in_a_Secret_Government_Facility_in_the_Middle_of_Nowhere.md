I looked at my Mickey Mouse watch. The time was 5:36 PM. I was licking my ice cream while sitting next to my mom in the car. To my right, was my 4 year old cousin Henry, who was fast asleep on his mother’s lap.   
 In the front, my dad was driving the car with his brother seated next to him. Then a truck from the opposite side suddenly came into our lane and rammed into our vehicle, causing it to turn turtle.   
With great difficulty, I managed to extricate myself and pulled my cousin brother out of the wreckage as well. And then suddenly, the car exploded, and it went up in flames….   
I opened my eyes and realised I was still in bed. The same dream had come and gone a thousand times before. It had now become a constant part of my life ever since I was a 9 year old kid.   
I slowly got off the bed, patted and hugged my dog Buster, a 3 year old German Shepherd.   
I walked into the kitchen to put a kettle of water on the boil. And switched on the TV  
My attention immediately turned to the news. There was a nuclear explosion in Russia in a small town that was just a couple of hours away from Moscow. The details regarding the explosion were still shrouded in speculation.   
‘What could have caused this? I hope the damage is minimal.’  I thought to myself, as I got ready for work.  
I showered, ate breakfast with my dog, and was out the door by 8, with a hot cup of coffee in hand. Buster raced ahead to get to the guard post.   
My partner Joe had already completed his shift, and was waiting for me to relieve him of his duties. We high fived as usual, and he started to walk back to his quarters.  
 I settled into my chair and made an entry in the log book.   
My name is Michael Armesto,  a 30 year old security guard working for a secret government installation located in an obscure location out in the hot Nevada desert. The facility is centered around a medium sized building occupying 3000 square feet of space.   
A 10 metre high wired fence had been erected around the base to provide added protection. There was nothing else around the facility for miles, with the exception of a huge boulder field, and mountains at a distance.   
For over 5 years now, my colleague Joe and I have been working in shifts to ensure the guard post is manned at all times.   
When compared to other secret government bases, the security requirements here are not as stringent. And yet, neither Joe nor I ..ever had any clue about the kind of work that was being done here.   
Every day, like clockwork, a bus carrying 25 people would arrive at the facility at 9:00 a.m. sharp. I would have to open the gates to let them through once the customary security checks were performed.   
These people always wore lab coats and looked like scientists. They would work in the facility till 5:00 PM and leave by the same bus at the end of the day.  
 In all this time, they never once smiled or waved at me.  
It was as if their bosses had strictly informed them not to even initiate eye contact with people outside their circle.   
Anyway, I never took offense to that. My job was to provide security, and I was doing that to the best of my ability.   
As I sat back in my chair, ready to take another sip of coffee, my phone began to ring. It was from the hospital, and I answered it.   
A minute later, I called Joe and asked him to stand in for me. He immediately understood.   
I put a leash on Buster and climbed into the jeep along with him. I started the vehicle and began driving towards the city to check on my wife Jessica. She was receiving treatment for Lung cancer at St Mary's Hospital, which was a 5 hour drive from the base.   
Jess had never smoked once in her life and for her to go through all this hardship, really broke my heart. I would have normally liked to stay by her side during this crisis, but I could not afford the cost of treatment on my own. Thankfully, the insurance from my government job so far, helped me cover most of the medical expenses.   
After arriving at the hospital, I headed straight to her room and found her with tubes attached to her mouth. She was heavily sedated and looked like she was in pain.   
I came to know from the doctor that she had suffered a heart attack due to long term COVID related complications.   
While she was stable and out of danger for now, she did need to undergo an emergency surgery in the next 3 days. The surgery would cost $30,000, and that was not covered by my insurance policy.  
I walked out of the hospital feeling a bit dazed. As I started to drive back to the base, my mind was busy trying to come up with solutions.   
I had only $2000 in my bank, and that clearly wasn’t enough.  
‘Maybe I could contact my boss, and apply for a loan?’ I thought to myself. I kept driving while mulling on the best course of action.   
Then at a certain point, I suddenly snapped to my senses and immediately stopped the car. I had been driving for over 4 hours now. It was 7 in the evening, and night had already fallen.  
And yet, I could not spot the base at a distance. Usually by now, the flood lights would have been turned on, and the facility would have been easily visible miles away.  
 Instead, all I could see up ahead was pitch black darkness.   
Something was wrong.  
I called Joe on his phone. He was unreachable.   
I stepped on the gas and drove as fast as I could.   
When I finally reached the facility, the situation looked much worse than I had feared. The entrance gate was left half open. There was no one manning the guard post.   
The entire building was just sitting there in the darkness with no power. I tried calling Joe’s number again. No response.   
I then called my boss, who was stationed at Carson City to apprise him of the situation, and to also request reinforcements. He was not reachable either.   
‘What on earth was going on?’ I asked myself. This was completely bewildering on so many levels.  
I slowly drove up to the base, and stopped the jeep a short distance away from the front gate. I wanted to be able to make a quick exit if things turned hostile.   
I took a torch light from the dashboard and unfastened my sidearm from the holster. I got down from the vehicle, and softly whistled at Buster to follow me.  
I slowly walked past the gate and checked the guard post.   
I saw a body lying face down on the floor. From a distance, I couldn’t identify the person clearly but as I got closer, I recognized Joe’s uniform.  
I ran towards him, and turned him around and got the shock of my life.   
I stumbled backwards in fear and hit the floor hard.   
I don’t know what they did to Joe.   
But he was lying there dead! Very dead. It was like he had been zapped or electrocuted.  
The only thing that was remaining of him was his skeleton. Not an ounce of flesh was visible on his body. And yet, his uniform looked in pristine condition.   
‘How is this even possible?’ I asked myself.   
Joe’s rifle was still there, leaning against the wall. I holstered my sidearm and picked up his rifle.  I checked the magazine. He hadn’t fired a single shot.   
I now turned on the tactical light and started moving towards the government facility with a rifle in hand. Nobody could ever enter this building until they had a high level of clearance, and every person who had clearance was issued an electronic key card to gain access.  
 I was shocked to see the door was left ajar here as well.   
Before entering, I headed back to check the junction box. The darkness was making me paranoid, and I wanted to see if there was anything I could do to fix it first.   
When I reached the box, I discovered that the power had been deliberately shut down. I turned it back up, and the entire place lit up like a Christmas tree.   
But the whole place wore a deserted look. And the bus that was usually used to ferry the scientists was still parked in the Parking lot.   
I doubled back towards the entrance, and slowly entered the building with my rifle pointed forward.   
This was the first time I set foot inside the facility. And if this was supposed to be a top research lab, I couldn’t see any signs of it.   
The place had been hastily evacuated. There was not a single soul in sight.  
All I could see was waste paper and computer cables strewn all across the floor. Everything else had been cleared out.   
Buster then took off on his own and ran towards the far end of the building. Something had caught his eye, and I followed after him. He stopped against a large sofa and was barking at me.   
I looked down and could see something metallic hidden underneath the sofa. I stretched my hand to retrieve an aluminium briefcase. It was covered in blood.   
Somebody obviously was holding onto it for dear life, and then tossed it under the sofa as a last ditch attempt to prevent it from getting into the wrong hands.   
‘Did the scientists manage to escape? Or did something bad happen to them, like it happened to Joe?’ I thought to myself.  
“Could the nuclear explosion in Russia have something to do with this?” I wondered.   
A hundred questions were going through my mind now, and I had answers to none of them.   
I decided to get the hell out of there as quickly as possible. I ran back to my car, threw the briefcase in the backseat, and began my drive back to the nearest city I could find.  
Twenty minutes into the drive, I began to get curious about the briefcase. I had to stop the car to take a look. I switched on the light in my vehicle and opened the briefcase. There was some kind of telescope inside.   
On its base, it bore the insignia of a bright, burning sun with a single eye at its center. It also had a tag attached to it and was labelled Korelo ZX4 – 1969.  
The telescope in itself was a weird looking contraption, the likes of which I had never seen before. It was the size of a camcorder and comfortably fit within the palm of my hand.   
There were two identical knobs on either side of the device. The one on the left moved freely clockwise or counterclockwise. It felt similar to those old radio transistors where you could switch back and forth between stations .   
The knob on the right looked the same but had a small pointer attached to it. It had limited range of motion and worked like a switch. Close to the pointer were 3 printed dots, one larger than the other,  in ascending order. I guess this signified the 3 levels in which this device functioned.   
I held the telescope gently in my hand and peered into the eye piece. With the moon being the only  source of light in the desert, I could hardly spot a thing.  
 I then turned the knob on the right, and the device immediately roared to life.  I could even feel it mildly vibrating in my hand.  
As I peered into the eyepiece again, I now had clear vision of the space all around me. A green display had opened up and was providing clean imagery with stunning levels of detail. I slowly started to turn the knob on the left and the telescope began to zoom in and out.  
I could see the creatures of the desert ….miles away, coming out their holes …looking for prey. Their heat signatures capturing perfectly… the contours of their own body as they moved swiftly across the sand.   
As I kept zooming in further, I could now even see the local diner of the nearest town that was more than 50 miles away. I could figure out the make and model of cars parked in front of the restaurant, and could even read the number plates on them.   
And then I looked upwards, pointing the telescope at the night sky, hoping to see the stars a little more clearly. And everything suddenly went opaque. It was like staring at a blank wall.  
 I moved the telescope away looking confused. Everything looked normal. There was an abundance of stars scattered across the night sky, and there were hardly any clouds.    
I looked into the telescope again and started zooming back, and then my heart suddenly skipped a beat.   
Thousands of feet high up in the sky, a large spaceship was hovering midair. It was big enough to accommodate an entire football field. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as I just kept staring at it for several moments.   
Then I slowly began to pan the telescope across the skyline, and soon realised that I was in for an even bigger shock!   
I could see at least two more spaceships thousands of miles away. Make no mistake. They were clearly visible as the one I was standing in front of.   
‘Ok Mike, What else you got?’, I said out loud to myself.   
I then turned my focus back to the ship in front of me, and turned the right knob again. I saw the second dot get highlighted on screen, and the telescope suddenly zoomed in to reveal the inside of the spaceship.   
The unfolding images were a little grainy but still definitive enough to provide sufficient visual quality. It was like an XRAy, CT scan and MRI all rolled into one.   
As I kept adjusting the left knob to get a clearer visual, I could see a large workstation occupying most of the space inside the ship.   
Close to the panel, two people were standing and conversing with each other. They did not look human at all. In fact, they looked like aliens!   
By this point, I was already sweating even as the cool winds of the desert were hitting my face, and ruffling my hair. I continued to stare into the telescope completely transfixed.   
I turned the right knob one more time. I could see the last big dot getting highlighted on screen, and then I suddenly started hearing weird noises.   
Buster who was keeping silent all this time, let out a soft howl and dug his face into the sand. But the noises didn’t stop. It sounded odd and animal-like.   
Like the garbled speech of someone attempting to speak with a mouthful of water. I knew I was now eavesdropping on the aliens talking amongst themselves.   
And, I think they realised this as well.  
 Because one of them abruptly stopped talking, walked towards the work station, and then punched something on the console.  
 In a matter of moments, the other alien turned around and took a step forward in my direction. It looked like he was peering down at me, fully aware of my existence. A wry smile appeared on his lips.  
At that very moment, I felt a shiver go down my spine.   
I immediately switched off the telescope, put it back in the briefcase, and ran towards my car. Buster followed suit.   
I decided to get to the nearest town and drove as fast as the car would take me.   
‘Did that alien really spot me? Am I in trouble?’ I thought to myself.   
All this, combined with today’s mysterious events at the base, only managed to further heighten my paranoia.   
It took a whole hour for the anxiety to start wearing down. Since nothing untoward had happened in all that time, it was slowly becoming a little easier for me to brush this off as a mere coincidence.   
When I finally reached town, I decided to stop by my cousin Henry’s place. I desperately needed somebody to talk to.  
Yet, as a precautionary measure, I drove around town for the next 30 minutes just to make sure I wasn’t being followed. I then had dinner at a diner nearby, and waited for another hour just to be on the safe side.  Finally, I was convinced that I was not being followed, and decided to head to Henry's place.  
It was already 5 am when I finally reached his home. I wasn’t surprised to see him awake. He runs a small illegal gambling den in the city, and so usually worked late into the night.   
 Henry was sitting by the fireside enjoying a pint of beer. I quickly brought him up to speed with the events of the day.   
When I was finished, he asked, “Do you still have the telescope?”  
I nodded. He took it out from the briefcase and pointed it at the sky. I showed him how to work it and warned him not to crank it up all the way to level 3. He nodded.  
And then, he saw it too. All the three spaceships were suspended mid-air. Just like I had spotted them the first time.   
He was in shock and whistled softly to himself.  
“What’s gonna happen Mike? Why do you think they are here?” he asked. I shrugged not knowing what to say.  
“Are they going to hurt us?” he asked, sounding worried.  
“I’m sure the government already knows of their presence. They must be dealing with them” I replied back quickly, though not fully convinced.   
He then panned the device straight at me and said “I can see your heart, lungs, spleen, and guts from here Mikey!”   
He then pointed it down to my trousers and exclaimed, “Somebody’s packin down there!’.   
I grabbed the telescope and put it back in the briefcase.   
“I want to sell this thing to help pay for Jessica’s surgery. Do you know any buyer?” I asked Henry.   
He told me about a smuggler in Tipmann Avenue which was an hour’s drive away from my cousin’s home.  I decided to visit him first thing in the morning.   
We finally decided to call it a night. I was totally exhausted and immediately fell asleep.   
I looked at my Mickey Mouse watch. It was 5:36 PM. I was happily licking my ice-cream in the backseat of my car when a truck came and rammed into it. I looked around but I was all alone in the car. I started doing everything in my power to try and get out. But I was unable to open the door. It was stuck. I tried to smash the window with my foot. But I failed again. It was too strong. Then a man looked at me from the outside. He had long hair and wore a French beard. He smashed the glass with his elbow and rescued me from the wreckage. ..  
I opened my eyes and realised I was still sleeping on Henry’s couch. It was the dream again. But it was different this time. And I had never seen that guy before.  I then looked at the clock, it was 3:00 in the afternoon and my cousin had already left for work.   
 I got up from the couch and took a quick shower. Put on some of Henry’s clothes. Then I saw a new jacket in his cupboard and tried it on. It fit perfectly. So I decided to keep it. I took the telescope from the briefcase and put it in the inner pocket of my jacket. Got in my car with Buster and took off to meet the smuggler whose address Henry had provided.   
When I was halfway along, I was waiting at a signal to take a right turn to Tipmann Avenue. A man with long black hair and a French beard stopped his bike next to my car.   
I was a little taken aback at the coincidence because he was the same man who had appeared in my dream this morning. I kept staring at him while he had his sight fixed on the road. When the signal tuned green, he raced ahead and I decided to follow after him.   
After a few miles, he stopped his bike in front of a store and went inside.   
“Good morning. What can I do for you?” he asked me when I entered the same shop with Buster. The man with long hair was manning the counter, and it looked like he was  into the dry cleaning business.  
 He was wearing a sleeveless jacket with a nameplate that read Adam. What surprised me was that there was another man seated just a few feet away who looked just like him. They were identical twins.   
“You saved my life” I said to Adam.   
“Excuse me?” he replied back sounding confused.   
 “You saved my life when I was involved in a car accident. But that was only a dream” I said to him  
Both brothers looked at each other, and started laughing like I was a mad person.  
I took the telescope from my jacket, and just placed it on the counter in front of him.  
The room suddenly went quiet. Nobody was laughing anymore.  
‘So, I am in the right place afterall... There's something definitely going on here’ I thought to myself.   
I could see he immediately recognized the device for what it was, and I now had all his attention.   
“Who are you?” he asked for the first time, fully serious.   
“My name is Michael. I used to work as a security guard. I found this lying around in an abandoned building.” I said. I refused to divulge any further details about myself.   
“How did you find me?” he asked, still looking confused.  
“In my dream like I already told you. Now I realise this sounds both stupid and bizarre. So did you really save my life? Of course not. I saved my own life from the car wreck, and I saved my cousin's life as well.\`\`  
“But there must be a reason why you came in my dream this morning because I spotted you on your bike a few hours later. Now I have reached a point in life where I can longer just ignore incidents like these as mere coincidences.”  
“So I decided to follow after you, and here I am, right now... in front of you… in your own store.”  
 I then tapped on the telescope with my finger and asked. ” So are you interested?”  
Adam looked me in the eye for a moment, and then took a deep long breath.   
He finally asked, “Ok Michael. How much do you want for it?”   
I said, “30k. In cash and would like it now please”.  
“Why the urgency?” he asked.  
“My wife needs emergency surgery, and I need the 30 grand to make that happen”  
Adam nodded.  
“Let's go test this thing upstairs. But your dog stays here. Don’t worry. My brother will keep an eye on him. You cool with that?” he asked.   
I looked at his brother, and he raised his hand to assure me Buster would be fine. I nodded, and followed after Adam to the terrace.   
I could see Adam was comfortable with handling the telescope. He had obviously used it before. He placed it in front of his eye and then began to fidget with the controls. He panned it at various office buildings and kept testing it.   
He then passed it back to me saying it wasn’t working properly. I took it from him and tested it myself. I looked into the telescope. The green display was working fine. I could zoom in and out. I then cranked it up to level 2. Now, I could see people working inside their offices.  
I kept panning the telescope and then all of a sudden, Adam came into my line of vision. The telescope zoomed inside of his chest, and what I saw made the hair in the back of my neck stand up.   
There was an alien residing inside Adam’s body, and he was looking right back at me.   
Before I had any time to react, I fell to the floor feeling fully paralyzed. Adam had just tasered me. The only thing I could remember  after that was his fist coming in contact with my face, and I lost all consciousness.   
When I finally came around, I realised I was still at the dry cleaners. Buster was busy licking my face and wagging his tail. He was obviously happy to see me awake.   
Adam must have carried me downstairs after he had punched the lights out of me.  
 I looked around the store and the twins were nowhere in sight. On the counter, I saw the telescope and next to it was a stack of bills totalling 30K. There was also a note attached to it.   
It read, “Break your little finger if you get into trouble”.   
I looked at my palm and noticed a puncture mark in the webbing of my right hand between the ring and the little finger.   
‘What did they inject into my hand? What did that note even mean? And why did they leave the money on the counter without even taking the telescope?’, I thought to myself.  
My head was swimming with many unanswered questions. But I was grateful for the money. I immediately wired it to the hospital and asked the doctor to get started with the surgery.   
But first I wanted to check in on Henry. For some reason I began to worry about his safety. I got in my car and started to drive towards his place   
When I parked the car outside his home, Buster immediately began to bark. He could sense something was wrong too. I took out my pistol from the dashboard and ran towards his house.   
I decided to enter through the backdoor hoping it would give me some kind of tactical advantage if necessary. I kicked the door open, and entered the kitchen to get to the living room.   
My heart just sank when I looked at Henry’s body. He was sitting lifeless on his favourite chair. He had been killed just like Joe. All that was left of him were his skeletal remains. I dropped to my knees and the tears just started flowing down my face.   
Buster started barking loudly again. His face looked really tense and I soon realised why.   
Three large aliens had come out of hiding and their eyes were all fixed on me. They were at least 8 feet tall with large hands and muscular bodies. The alien in front of me was brandishing a baton kind of weapon in his hand.   
Every time he swished it in the air, electrical sparks flew out of it. Buster suddenly lunged at him to tear into his leg but he casually managed to kick him away. He flew back 2 feet in the air and yelped in pain.   
I then aimed my gun at him to take him out, when another alien whacked me in the head from behind. And I fell to the floor unconscious for the second time in less than 5 hours.   
When I regained consciousness, I realised I was seated in a large elliptical room. A huge workstation was occupying one half of the room. This included a giant display at the centre that was throwing up all kinds of data. On either side of the screen, there were large control panels with switches, buttons, displays, knobs and other monitoring instruments. I could see at least 6 aliens hunched over busy at work.   
At the centre, was a large swivel chair that was overlooking the entire operation. I could see somebody seated in it with their back turned towards me. I tried to get up but I realised I was confined to a chair. My waist, wrists and legs were all cuffed to it. I looked around for Buster and I found him asleep in a corner.   
Before I could call out to him, I heard a voice say, “Hello Michael, Welcome Aboard”
