I can still remember the Christmas of 1977 like it was yesterday...

It was the week of Christmas when a series of inexplicable events plagued my hometown of Plattsville, Kansas*.

Although I was 6 years old at the time, I was old enough to know that what was happening wasn't normal...

Anyway, it all began in the early morning hours of December, 20th when Joe Miller, the town's drunk was found dead in front of Larry's Bar & Grill.

At first, his death was ruled accidental until the mayor of Plattsville was found bound and naked in his basement.

Fortunately for the mayor though he survived his harrowing ordeal.

The next victim wasn't so lucky...

Harry Burns, a manager for the local bank was reported missing by his wife after he failed to show up for their yearly Christmas Party.

His body was discovered the next day by Sue Jones, an employee of the bank.

Someone or something had placed his body inside the bank's vault.

Several more deaths followed and things got even stranger...

Witnesses began to come forward with reports of a strange-looking humanoid creature seen at each of the crime scenes.

Soon, rumors began to fly about each of the victims and their past misdeeds. 

It wasn't long before each of their crimes came to light including Joe Miller's vehicular manslaughter charge and Harry Burn's embezzlement charge.

Things started to get even weirder when several of the townspeople began reporting break-ins in their homes. 

Oddly enough, nothing was reported stolen.

Anyway, it didn't take long before authorities begin to find a connection between the break-ins and the murders.

This was a relatively quiet town and crime was virtually nonexistent, so for all of these things to happen was quite odd.

To make matters worse, mayor Burns (he's Harry Burns older brother) decided to cancel the annual Christmas Eve Parade and implement an 8 O' Clock curfew.

So you can imagine just how disappointed everybody was...

With nothing to do, my parents made me go to bed early with the promise of presents in the morning.

Reluctantly, I headed to bed.

With the anticipation of Santa's arrival the next morning, I immediately fell asleep.

Around midnight, I was awoken by the sound of rustling downstairs.

Thinking it was Santa, I sprung out of bed and quickly ran downstairs only to be greeted by this god-aweful-looking creature.

This thing was massive with its long horns and by god, it was wearing what looked like a Santa suit.

I stood there frozen in place staring at this enormous creature, even peeing on myself because I was so scared.

Anyway, this creature stood there staring at me as it reached into the bag that it was carrying and pulled out what look like a human leg.

It then proceeded to devour the leg and I swear, I heard the bones crunch as it ate the leg.

Watching this unfold as a 6-year-old was traumatizing, to say the least.

Anyway, after it was finished devouring the leg, the creature looked straight at me and then placed a finger on its lips gesturing for me to keep quiet. 

Then, it flew up the chimney (which was physically impossible for something that size).

In that instant, the creature was gone along with the strange events that plagued the town.

That was 45 years ago...

I'm 51 and now, a mother and grandmother.

Christmas is in a few weeks, and strange things have been happening again in Plattsville. 

I'm afraid the creature is coming back for me and my family but I'll be ready...
