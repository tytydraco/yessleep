so this happend a few years ago when we still lived in our hometown. we used to take shortcuts but after this we never did again.
but i will remember this to this day, i wil never forget!
this was in the winter of 02.

It was a dark and stormy night when my best friend pedro and i decided to take a shortcut through the woods on our way home. The rain was poring down, and the wind was howling, making it difficult to see more than a few feet in front of us.

as we trudged through the thick undergrowth, i couldnt shake the feeling that we were being watched. i glanced over to pedro , who seemed oblivious to his surroundings, his attention focused on his phone.

'Hey, Pedro, do you feel like someone's watching us? i asked, my voice trembles slightly.

Pedro looks up from his phone and shrugged. 'Probably just your imagination, Mario. Let's just keep moving.'

But i couldn't shake off the uneasy feeling. i quickened my pace, and Pedro followed suit. Suddenly, we stumbled upon an old abandoned house. The windows were shattered, and the paint was peeling off the walls.

'Let's check it out,' Pedro said, seemingly excited by the discovery.

I hesitated, but my curiosity got the better of me, and i followed Pedro inside. The inside of the house was just as eerie as the outside. The walls were covered in cobwebs, and the floorboards creaked under our feet.

As we made our way through the house, we came across a room with a strange symbol drawn on the floor in what looked like blood. Pedro's phone suddenly died, and so we were plunged into darkness.

Panic began to set in as we desperately tried to find our way out of the house. But every time we thought we found the exit, we would end up back in the same room with the symbol.

That's when we heard it - a low growling coming from the shadows. Pedro let out a scream, and we both ran towards the door, only to find that it was locked.

'We have to get out of here,' Pedro shouted, his heart racing with fear.

But it was too late. The growling grew louder, and suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a hulking creature with red glowing eyes and sharp claws.

We screamed as the creature lunged towards us, but before it could reach us, Pedro pulled out a small vial from his pocket. He threw it at the creature, and it let out a blood-curdling screech before disappearing into thin air.

'What was that?!' I exclaimed, panting heavily.

'I don't know, but I always carry this vial with me, just in case,' Pedro replied, his hands shaking.

We managed to find a way out of the house and ran all the way home, never looking back. From that day on, we never took shortcuts through the woods again, and i always made sure to have my best friend by my side, especially in the dark. We never spoke of that night again, but we both knew we had encountered something truly terrifying.
