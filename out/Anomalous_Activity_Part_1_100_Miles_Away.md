“*God this dust is thick, what the hell could’ve happened here?*”

“*I don’t know, and frankly don’t really care, we’re just here to search the debris*”

“*Damn, this guy couldn’t have had much of anything in his house. There’s barely any furniture*”

“*What the hell… There’s some little thing down here.*”

“*Well grab it!*”

“*It’s a little microchip thing?*”

“*That’s a SIM card dumbass, put it in the bucket. Maybe there’s something on it.*”

“*Well we got evidence, put it in a phone and let’s see if there’s anything.*”

“*Alright, toss me that hair pin. Alright, I got it. Photo app? 10 minute long video? Let’s see this.*”

“Oh god, oh lord, is this working?.. Ok, it is, I’m praying that this will send it time, but Mom, Dad, Kayley, anybody who could watch this, I need help. Please get somebody.”

“I can’t open my door. My door is locked shut. Any of my doors, even. I can’t even close a door. Look!”

*Struggling can be heard*

“See? It’s locked shut. That’s not the bad part though. My windows are locked too. My garage door is, the bedroom door is, the closet, the pantry, and all my windows are too foggy to see through. I’m stuck here-“

*A notification can be heard*

“What the hell? ‘100 miles away…’ What the hell does that mean?”

*Typing is heard*

“Some number just texted me ‘100 miles away.’ I’ve just asked who it was-“

*Another notification is heard*

“What the fuck? That’s my address! What the hell?”

“Alright, I can’t deal with this shit anymore. I’m breaking down my door.”

*Several crunching sounds are made*

“What the FUCK? FUCKING BREAK ALREADY!”

“GOD DAMN IT! Where’s a screwdriver? I’ll just take the hinges off.”

*Drawers are opened*

“There it is! Now just unscrew this, unscrew that…”

“There- What the hell? What the fuck? WHAT THE FUCK! WHY IS THE SKY RED? Get me the hell out of here-“

*A distorting sound is heard*

“Ugh, god- WHAT? WHY THE FUCK AM I IN MY CHAIR? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?”

*A notification is heard*

“76 miles away. What the hell? What’s 76 miles away?”

“Let me try again, where’s my screwdriver… Are you fucking serious?! It’s back in the damn drawer?!”

“What is going on… Alright, door is off. Sky is red. Take one step out and-“

*A distortion sound is made*

“What the- GOD DAMN IT! What about the garage door-“

*A notification is heard*

“63 miles away. Great. Let me get this damn door open.”

*A struggle is heard*

“GOD DAMN IT! I can’t open this shit! WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO?!”

“*Is this some kind of joke? This can’t be real-*”

“*Just keep watching.*”

“Let’s try the window now. Screwdriver goes in…”

*Glass breaks*

“Now jump out, maybe if I got fast it will work. Here’s hoping.”

*A distortion sound is heard*

“FUCK! FUCK! Come the FUCK on! I’m scared, I’m scared. Don’t tell me I’m going to die here!”

*A notification is heard*

*48 miles away.*

“Out the window again.”

*39 miles away.*

“Come on, COME ON! LET ME OUT! PLEASE! This isn’t done by a person, WHAT KIND OF HELL IS THIS?”

*28 miles away.*

“PLEASE! PLEASE LET ME OUT!”

*14 miles away*

“God, WHAT AM I MEANT TO DO? SOMEBODY! PLEASE! HELP!”

*5 miles away*

“Please… PLEASE! I WANT TO SEE MY MOM AGAIN! AT LEAST LET ME SAY GOODBYE TO MY FAMILY! AT LEAST- What the hell? What the fuck is that? WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?! WHAT THE FUCK! WHAT THE HELL?! NO NO NO, PLEASE NO-“

*The video ends*

“*That is the fakest shit I’ve ever seen, what kind of jackass left this here? This wasn’t even worth looking at!*”

“*Maybe not for you.*”

*A single gunshot can be heard, with a body falling on the ground*

“*I got something. Not sure what it can help with, but it’s something alright.*”

*Steps can be heard walking out of the entrance to the wreckage*

“That’s who we’re looking for. We don’t know who they are, but they gather any proof of anomalous activity. Do anything you can to stop them and figure out what they’re doing. General Khovaz, you may leave. Just find out who these people are.”
