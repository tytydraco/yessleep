A few months ago, my neighbor passed away. Or neighbor, actually. Our houses are at least four hundred meters apart. We have a field and then an expansive meadow with grazing sheep between us. It's only when the windows light up in the evenings that I can catch a glimpse of the neighboring house.



Here in eastern Norfolk, most people live sparsely, and if you wish, you can live as neighbors for years without more than needing to raise a hand in greeting when you see each other. So we had lived side by side for almost twenty years. Occasionally, we would nod to each other when I walked the dog and he sped past in his old Bentley.



What I knew about my neighbor, probably thirty years my senior, I had mostly heard from others: He used to work as a traveling salesman and was eccentric in his ways. In the past, he had often hosted lively parties, but since his wife died, he lived mostly isolated from others. In recent times, home care barely made it inside.



The couple had decorated the house themselves. From the outside, it looked quite ordinary, a white-painted one-story house with blue trim, stretching out towards the sea. Inside, however, it was more peculiar. Green thick carpets, dark wallpaper, several small bars, panoramic windows facing the sea meadows, groups of blood-red leather sofas, and black-toned glass tables with large ashtrays. What the villagers often described with great fascination was how the couple had covered several doors and insides of cupboards with a leopard-patterned fabric.



The interior seemed taken from an exclusive American home in the 70s but had become outdated over the years, a style now perceived as antiquated. Someone had described the house as one of those eerie places seen in the TV series Twin Peaks.



I had never set foot inside myself. So when the house was put up for sale, I attended the viewing to see for myself how my unknown neighbor had lived. What others had told me was confirmed as I wandered around inside. However, something I had not understood was how present his wife still was in the house. I noted, for example, that there were still dresses hanging in the closets, despite the fact that the wife had been dead for many years. One of the bedrooms, which must have been hers, was also completely untouched. Next to the bed was a dressing table with brushes, nail polishes, boxes, and perfume bottles. I understood that he must have deeply mourned his wife. That his vitality had extinguished and time had stopped after her death.



With a certain feeling of shame, I thanked the real estate agent for the visit. I had played the role of an interested house buyer when in fact I was just curious and snooping around.



In the following days, I couldn't free myself from the impressions of the house. The smells of stuffiness and cigarette smoke. The sense of abandonment and deep sorrow, bordering on a kind of obsession. All of this lingered. For several nights, I also had the same unsettling dream.



I walked across bleak fields at dusk. The landscape lacked an end. Wherever I looked, I saw stunted junipers. Darkness descended. Despite walking alone and seeing no one, I had a strong feeling of being watched. That someone or someones were watching me. The feeling intensified, and I started running without knowing where to flee. Suddenly, I fell to the ground. My foot had gotten caught in a branch loop. I tried to get up, but my foot was stuck. Then I heard laughter right behind me. When I turned around, two figures stood in the darkness. It looked like a man and a woman. They were not facing me but each other. I couldn't see their faces, and the couple didn't seem to see me lying there. I screamed for help but realized my voice wasn't heard, that it was choked off. Desperately, I grabbed my throat to get air. That's when the couple turned towards me. I still couldn't see who they were. But they looked at me, and I heard their laughter.

So suddenly I woke up from the dream and sat up quickly, turned on the bedside lamp, and took a deep breath. After a few more deep breaths, I glanced to the side of the bed. Something was moving under the covers. I gathered my courage and approached. Quickly, I pulled away the covers and stepped back a few paces. The horror of what I discovered paralyzed me. In front of me in the bed lay the same man and woman as in the dream. But now their faces were illuminated. They smiled at me and reached out their hands, as if to reach for my throat. Then I woke up with a start, now for real, completely drenched in cold sweat. After the dream, I couldn't possibly fall back asleep. I got up, drew back the curtain, and looked out the window. I gazed towards the neighbor's house and could only make out its contours.



Some time after the sale, the old neighbor's house began to be rented out. I hadn't met the new owners yet, and despite keeping a daily watch over the house, I hadn't seen anyone clearing out the estate. It became early summer, and I occasionally saw different cars driving up to the house. The temporary tenants succeeded each other. Soon enough, I realized that the house remained untouched and was rented out as it had been left when the man died.



So one evening, when I took my evening walk with the dog, I ran into two slightly giggling women. I understood they were summer guests and greeted them good evening. The women stopped and wanted to chat. They apologized and explained they had had a few glasses of wine. They said they had chosen to rent the house because the pictures on the website had such a strange and different atmosphere.



One of the women, the blonde one, eagerly wanted to share something they had experienced in the house. The other, the dark-haired one, silenced her friend and preferred to get tips from me on different places to visit. The blonde woman interrupted me as I was about to mention that the beautiful coastal road along the northern part of the island was worth seeing, with its sea stacks and kilometers-long stone beaches. She looked me in the eyes and asked excitedly:



"Do you know who lived in the house originally? Did you know them?"



I replied that I didn't know much about the owner. That the wife had been dead since I moved here in 1999 and that the man had lived alone since then. The blonde woman was surprised and said:



"We thought it was the opposite. That it was the woman who died last."

"Why's that?" I asked.

"The closets are still filled with women's clothes."



I told them what I thought about it. That the man hadn't been able to throw away or get rid of his wife's belongings.



"Why aren't there any men's clothes left then? That's strange, isn't it?"



I agreed. We concluded that it was peculiar to rent out the house at all when the personal belongings hadn't been removed. Before we parted ways and I continued on my evening walk, the blonde woman said:



"Then there was the incident with the radio. Last night, we were listening to the weather report. Can you guess what happened?"

"No, no idea," I replied.

"Yes, I turned on the radio, and from the speaker, we heard an elderly woman's voice saying, 'I'm here. I'm here. I'm not disappearing.' Wasn't that creepy?"



The dark-haired woman nervously laughed and explained that her friend had a vivid imagination. That initially, the voice had sounded scary in the context but soon turned out to belong to an actress reading lines from a radio play. We said our goodbyes, and as a final note, I assured them not to worry and that they could contact me if they needed any help or wanted more tips on excursions.



That night, I had trouble falling asleep. I thought about the old neighbor and realized I had never seen his face up close. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't remember what he looked like. Granted, we usually only crossed paths from a distance, quick meetings in passing. But shouldn't I be able to recreate his face in my mind? Upon further reflection, I also couldn't recall what his voice sounded like. I had always perceived the neighbor as a rather strange recluse, but now, after his death, he had started to become an increasingly inscrutable puzzle.

I fell asleep only after taking a sleeping pill. In a haze of different images and memories, I tossed and turned in the bedclothes. Half asleep, I found myself in a state of hallucinations and dreams. I was being chased in total pitch-black darkness with no place to hide. I saw emaciated figures sitting listlessly on the ground that I had to step over to pass by. Panic set in when I discovered a slowly crawling spider on my neck that I tried to swipe away.



I woke up with a start. The sheets were in a heap on the floor. The clock radio read three o'clock. I had only slept for a few hours. Drowsily, I went to the kitchen to drink something warm. At the same time, I glanced towards the neighbor's house. The lights were also on there. I boiled some milk with a few spoons of butter in it. That's what my grandmother used to do when I was little and had trouble sleeping. The lukewarm and slightly sweet milk soon filled me with a sense of calm. Outside, the sun began to rise on the horizon. I went out and sat on the porch. The air was fresh, and I could already feel the sun rays warming up.



During the morning, I mowed the grass and tended to the rose bushes. To my delight, I discovered an abundance of wild garlic growing in the damp corner of the vegetable garden. The fertile Norfolk soil was perfect for such plants. I made wild garlic soup for lunch and enjoyed the peacefulness as I sat eating on the garden bench.



Then, quite unexpectedly, she stood right in front of me. The blonde woman was out of breath and speaking incoherently. I only caught a few words and realized that something had greatly frightened her. She asked me to follow her to the house. I quickly wiped my mouth with the napkin and tried to calm her down. Instead, she turned and ran ahead of me. At times, she looked back to make sure I was following.



On the steps to the house, I heard or saw nothing of the woman. I called out cautiously, opened the door, and went inside. Everything inside was just as it had been during the viewing. However, there were three suitcases in the hallway. I understood that the women were about to leave. I walked through the living room and into the study. There was no sign of life anywhere. I called out louder and cautiously pushed open the door to one of the bedrooms. Sitting on the edge of the bed was the other woman, the dark-haired one, with her back to me. I asked what was wrong, but received no answer. I approached and gently tapped her shoulder. She turned around suddenly as if I had awakened her from a trance.



"Oh, there you are," said the blonde woman hurriedly behind me. "We need to leave. Now. This is the craziest place I've ever been. Can you imagine giving the key back?"



I took the house key and asked what had happened. The blonde woman went over to her friend and tried to get her to stand up. They made their way out to the hallway. The dark-haired woman was unresponsive. Her gaze just stared blankly ahead. Outside, we heard a car pull up in the front.



"That must be our ride. Finally."



The blonde woman sat down on a chair while the dark-haired woman carried out the suitcases. I crouched down and gently took her hands in mine.



"Tell me. What happened?"



She didn't answer, continuing to stare straight ahead. Could she have been in some sort of shock? I stood up, thinking I should help carry out the last suitcase. Then the woman began speaking in a monotone voice, almost to herself.



"I was alone on the meadow below the house. I was walking among the juniper bushes and picking flowers. Then I felt like someone or something was watching me. The feeling grew stronger and stronger. I was being watched even though I saw no one. I got scared and started running back towards the house. That's when I fell. My foot got caught in a branch. Behind me, I heard two people laughing. They were standing right behind me. I covered my ears and screamed out loud. That's when Maria came and asked what had happened. She said she hadn't seen anyone or heard any laughter."



Maria took me to my bed, and I fell asleep exhausted. Then I woke up with a start and realized I was no longer in my bedroom but in my wife's. I got up confusedly, bumped into the vanity table in the darkness, and realized I must have been sleepwalking. I looked out the window. I saw that the man we met with the dog was also awake. There was light over there in his house. When I turned around, I noticed something in the bed where I had been lying. It was moving. I gathered my courage, approached, and pulled back the covers. There lay an elderly man and woman. They laughed with the same voices I had heard outside, and then they reached out their hands towards me.



"Where are they now?" I asked.



The blonde woman entered and replied, "It was an illusion, of course. A dream. She has a fever. Come on! We have to leave now," said the blonde woman, at the same time taking the suitcase from my hand.



Supportively, she led her friend out to the waiting car. I followed in confusion and saw them sit down and close the doors. Then I recognized the car. It was an old Bentley, just like the one my old neighbor used to drive. And then something so strange happened. In the driver's seat sat an elderly woman, partly obscured behind the windshield. I barely had time to see her before they drove off. But I really thought I had seen that woman [before.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAKDy2C2epnlNnlwYJa32aQ)
