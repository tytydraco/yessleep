*“Hey! Hey kid! Hey, wake up!.. God damn it all…* *Wake up!”*

To my slight dismay, I was gaining consciousness again. My vision was hazy, I could barely keep my eyes open but the stabbing pain in my back forced me to stay awake.

*“There you are! Now don’t you fall asleep again son! Keep your eyes open!”*

My mind instantly became more clear.

*“Dad?”* - I quietly called out in a haze.

*“Uh… Not exactly son… Alright lemme’ try this.”*

Ice cold water splashed all over my face. I shot straight up in reaction to the cold shock and frantically threw my head around in all kinds of directions in confusion.

*“Wooaah! You alright there son?”*

*“Wha- Ugh- Who are you!?”*

*“Calm down now, I ain’t here to hurt ya.’”*

Someone was sitting beside me, almost hunched over my face. It was an older gentleman with a thick white beard and untrimmed eyebrows. He was wearing a dark green raincoat, one of those old-school ones made of that rubbery material with a pair of cargo pants in the same color to match. After making sure I was alright and fully conscious, he grabbed his rifle and hung the sling around his shoulder as he stood up.

*“Whew, thought we lost ya’ there.”* - The man said in a humorous tone.

*“How long was I out?”* - I asked him, drying my face off with the sleeve of my jacket, still sitting on the floor.

*“No idea kid, I came here about 10 minutes ago myself.”*

Without responding, I remembered the gushing wound inflicted on me by that monster as I quickly put my hand on my back, patting around in search of the gash.

*“Don’t worry kid, I patched you up, you should be fine for the time being, long’ as you don’t touch it”* - The man said in a casual tone.

*“Name’s Russell, Russell Cook, but to be honest I’d rather you just call me Russ.”* The man said as he reached down and grabbed my hand and shook it.

*“What is this place?”* - I asked him, as soon as I had gotten up on my feet.

*“Good question kid! That’s exactly what I’ve been tryna’ figure out for years!”* - Russell said before letting out a laugh.

*“No, I don’t understand, what is this place? What was that thing that attacked me?”* - I asked while trying my best to keep my composure.

His eyes drifted away from mine, down towards the floor to my left.

*“Look kid, as I said, I honestly don’t completely understand any of this either, but before I tell you all I know, we gotta’ get outta’ here.”* - He said in a gloomy tone.

*“What? Why? You wanna go out there?”* - I asked him.

*“Nope, as a matter of fact I’d much rather stay here.”* - Said Russell while heading towards the door, now back in his casual tone of voice.

*“Then why are we leaving?”* - I eagerly pleaded.

Old man Russell turned around and hastily marched back towards me, his dirty combat boots thudding against the snow-white tiling below.

*“Look here junior, we don’t have a choice. And if you’re gonna come with me, you’re gonna live under my rules, understood?”* - He said as he grabbed both of my shoulders.

*“Okay…”* - I responded, scared shitless. This old man had a generous amount of kick in him.

*“Alright, good.”* - Russell said as his lips formed a friendly grin.

We made our way out of the gas station and started crossing a field of grass that laid behind it, partially covered by snow. I still had a lot of questions but I didn’t want to get on the gentleman’s nerves by asking too many questions, so I thought to myself that I should probably keep quiet for the time being. I looked up at the thick, white clouds above. Around the time I got attacked, the sky was mostly gray so I figured it must’ve been noon by now. I turned my focus back towards the direction we were walking, increasing my pace to catch up with the old man.

*“So kid, how’d you end up here?”* - Russell asked in an obvious - but appreciated - attempt to make small talk.

*“I uh… Crashed my car and headed south to look for help.”*

*“Really?”* - He responded as he let out a chuckle.

*“Yep, really.”* - I said in a jaded tone.

*“Well, where’d you crash?”*

*“A dozen miles north of here, on a dirt road, the one off’ i-95.”*

*“Ah, I see. What were you doing out there?”*

*“I was headed to Dover but I decided to take a detour.”*

*“Dover? What were you gonna do down there?”*

*“I was gonna attend my old man’s funeral.”*

*“Oh… Sorry kid.”* - Russell said, taken aback by my sudden answer.

*“No it’s fine, really.”* - I assured him.

*“So, how’d you manage to crash the car?”*

*“There was a pick-up, driver turned off his headlights and rammed into me.”*

The man stopped abruptly and quickly turned around to face me, a look of fear plastered on his face, something I thought impossible.

*“What did it look like?”* - He asked, sounding like he hoped his concerns were in vain.

*“Uh… black? It was a Ram 3500, I’m pretty sure.”*

*“Shit.”* - Russell said quietly.

*“Why? What’s going on?”* - I worryingly asked as the fear that was still inside me started surfacing once again.

*“A dozen or so miles north of here you said, right?”*

*“Yeah I’m pretty sure… What’s goin-”*

*“Don’t worry about it, just… get a move on.”* - He interrupted, as he started walking faster.

As the border of the woods ahead, previously hidden behind a wall of fog, became visible, I thought about how I still wanted my question about the pick-up answered. But on the other hand, if I didn’t shut up, the old man would probably lose his shit this time around - and in hindsight - I understand why. We kept walking in silence for a long while, switching between a normal and a fast pace occasionally.

\*\*\*

After about an hour or so of walking, we were now deep in the forest. I didn’t want it to seem like I thought the man had led me into a trap or something but in truth, I was beginning to have my doubts.

*“Hey uh… Russ, where are we even going?”*

*“You’ll see soon enough kid, wouldn’t wanna ruin the surprise.”* - Russ said in a lighthearted tone.

After the old man’s statement, my nerves calmed a little. I started looking around as I kept on marching, despite the seemingly never-ending cloudy sky, it was pretty beautiful. A little snow here and there, mixed with the deep green of the forest. As I was taking in the beauty of the nature around me, almost in a daydreaming-like state, old man Russell’s footsteps suddenly stopped. I turned my head back to him, he stood completely frozen in place.

*“What’s wrong Russ?”* I asked.

*“Sh!”* - He shushed aggressively.

*“Did you hear that?”* - He asked in a half-whisper.

*“Hear what?”*

As soon as the words exited my mouth, every single hair on my body stood up as I heard that terrifying neck-snapping sound coming from about 20 feet to our right. Now I too, stood completely frozen, unable to move a single inch.

*“Don’t move until I tell you to, alright kid?”* - Russell whispered.

*“O-okay”* - I answered.

There it was again, the snapping noise. Only this time, it kept going, every two seconds or so. My heart started beating faster and faster as adrenaline started coursing through my blood, just like it had last night. The noise got more frequent and closer by the second, until I could hear it from all directions, snapping at least once every second.

*“Run!”* - Russell said loudly, his voice echoing through the woods along with the snapping sound.

I did as he said, we ran straight ahead as fast as we could. Despite his age, Russell was quite fast. Even though I wasn’t the athletic type, I wasn’t *that* out of shape, but nonetheless, I could just barely keep up with him. As we ran, that damned snapping sound just kept following us. After only a minute or so I was starting to lose my breath, even with all the adrenaline, I was starting to slow down.

*“Keep going if you wanna live, kid!”* - Russell called out in between rapid breaths.

I let out a groan, forcing my body to run faster, a sharp pain developing in my lungs. I couldn’t breathe at all, I wasn’t gonna be able to keep this up for long. As I started slowing down again, the snapping kept getting closer and closer to me, it only took a few seconds before it sounded like it was right behind me. Then, all of a sudden, it stopped. My legs gave out as I crashed onto the forest floor, hitting my knees on the rock-hard root of a pine tree. Russell ran over to me and helped me get up. We both stood bent over, our hands on our knees, trying to catch our breaths. After a few moments of gathering ourselves, we stood up straight again, I wiped sweat off of my forehead while Russell let down his rifle from his shoulder, readying it as he scanned our surroundings. After he had looked around for a minute, he put his rifle back on his shoulder.

*“You alright there kid? Looked like you fell pretty hard there.”*

*“Yeah I’m fine for the time being.”* - I responded, still not having quite caught my breath.

*“Alright, good, we got no time to waste, we gotta’ keep moving, we’re almost there.”*

\*\*\*

And he wasn’t lying, just a few minutes of relatively slow walking, we arrived. A half abandoned, half renovated log cabin. It stood in a small clearing in the woods on flat ground, the lantern that hung from the roof of the small porch gave me a sense of comfort. We made our way inside, a musky scent of old wood hitting my nose. There were three small rooms. The one in the middle had a fireplace, a table with three chairs around it and a small gas stove. The other two rooms were basically just two small bedrooms on each end of the cabin. My room was to the right of the front door and Russell’s was on the left.

*“Make yourself at home kid, I know it ain’t much but it’s better than anything you’ll find in this place.”*

*“No, no, this’ll do.”*

We said good night and headed to our rooms. The small bed with old, plain, white sheets and white covers with a flower-pattern on them stood in the corner of the room. I sat down and looked around the room. By the door, there stood a small, wooden desk accompanied by a small, old chair, seemingly made of the same, dark-brown wood. I decided it would be best to try and get some sleep, so I laid down on my side, facing the wall, feeling a slight pain around the wound on my back as I did so. I started thinking about how crazy all of this was, this place, these monsters, the weather, all of it. Why was I acting like any of this was fine by any means? How was I satisfied with the less than bare minimum information Russell had given me? I kept pondering until my mind simply couldn’t stay awake any longer. I drifted off to sleep.

\*\*\*

I woke up, feeling more groggy and exhausted than I’d felt in years, my whole body was sore. I guess it’s only natural when you severely overexert your unfit body. Nevertheless, I had to get up and get to it because I did *not* want Russell to think I was just another lazy young man. I got up and out of bed, still wearing my black, oversized sweatpants I had been wearing the whole time as well as my plain white t-shirt. I put on my black sneakers and my black bomber jacket and headed out of my room. I walked through the living room, Russell wasn’t there. I kept walking forward until I stood in front of Russell’s room. I started contemplating if I should knock or not but I figured it would be for the best. Just as I was about to knock, the front door creaked open. I turned around to see who it was.

*“There you are kid!”* - Russell said with a smile on his face.

*“Morning.”* - I answered, trying my best to seem at least a little energetic.

*“What were you doing outside?”* - I asked curiously.

*“Oh, just having a cigarette, was just about to head inside and check up on you.”*

*“You smoke?”* - I asked, a little surprised.

*“Yep, and you?”* - He answered.

*“Yeah.”*

*“Well, come on outside and let me share one with ya’ then.”* - Russell said before letting out a slight chuckle.

*“Sure.”* - I answered with an awkward smile on my face.

We sat down on the cold, damp wooden steps of the porch. I looked around, it was pretty bright outside. There were no sounds, the air felt thick, like it usually does when everything’s covered in snow, that echo-y atmosphere was very noticeable and felt strange since there was pretty much no snow left.

*“Here ya’ go.”* - Russell said as he extended his paper pack of Marlboros to me.

*“Thanks.”* - I said as I pulled one out.

*“So, how long you been’ smoking?”* - I asked, in an effort to make small talk.

*“Eh, on and off for the past 40 years or so.”* - Russell said with his cigarette in the corner of his mouth.

*“On and off?”* - I asked.

*“Yep, wife didn’t appreciate it very much.”* - He said as he let out a melancholy chuckle.

*“I see.”* - I responded in a quiet and serious tone as Russell lit his cigarette.

*“Don’t sweat it kid, she was gone way before I ended up in this place.”* - Russell said as he exhaled the smoke.

*“How’d she die?”* - I followed, as Russell handed me the old-school zippo lighter.

*“No idea, she died in her sleep while I was in Afghanistan.”*

*“You were in the military?”* - I asked, even though I wasn’t very surprised.

*“20 years.”* - He answered.

I lit my cigarette, realizing this would be my first drag for more than 24 hours, which hadn’t happened for years. We sat in silence, enjoying our cigarettes. My mind started to wander, I thought about quitting smoking, how my dad’s funeral went and if my family wondered where I was. That’s when I realized I hadn’t asked Russell if he had a phone.

*“I forgot to ask, you got a phone by any chance?”* - I eagerly asked him.

*“Nope, sorry kid but there’s no point, phones don’t work here.”*

I should have figured really, if you could contact people “on the other side” or whatever, Russell wouldn’t be here. I turned my gaze forward and - I didn’t really feel sad, nor did I feel completely hopeless, I’d best describe it as a somber, empty feeling that hung in the air. I glanced towards Russell and I could kind of sense that he was preparing to answer the multitude of questions that would come his way about what this place is.

*“Those… things that attacked me… they looked like kids. Do you-”*

*“Yep, only seen em’ two times before yesterday though.”* - Russell interrupted.

*“To be honest, I don’t know what they are but, all I know is they only appear during the morning. We used to call em’ scratchers.”*

*“We?”* - I asked, confused as to why he hadn’t mentioned that there were other people stuck in this hell with us.

Russell winced in recoil of his slip-up before he sighed.

*“Yeah… To tell you the truth kid, I haven’t really been honest with you. My wife didn’t die in her sleep, she died here. Now, how exactly she died isn’t something I’m interested in getting into.”*

*“I understand.”* - I replied.

*“Was it just you two?”* - I followed up.

*“Our son.”* - Russell said as he took the last drag of his cigarette.

*“Oh.”* - Was all I could say.

*“Ya’ know, you kinda’ remind me of him sometimes, he was tall, skinny, not very athletic and not very outgoing either. He was nothing like me or his mother. I tried changing him, to make him more of a “man”... I gave him hell for not being like me and I wish I didn’t”* - Russell ranted, as his voice started to break.

I wasn’t sure how to respond so I just defaulted to the most typical, consoling thing to say.

*“I’m sure he was a great guy.”*

*“Yeah, he was a good kid.”* - Russell said, his voice now as strong as usual.

*“So uh… How about that thing yesterday? The one that makes that snapping noise.”* - I asked to change the subject.

*“They thankfully never got to meet one of those but I call them snappers, I’ve never actually seen them though, just heard 'em.”*

*“Creative.”* - I replied in a jesting, smug tone.

*“Yeah, I was never the creative type.”* - Russell said while smiling.

*“By the way, how’s your body feeling?”* - He asked.

*“A little sore but good enough”* - I replied

*“You think you can go for a hike?”* - He followed up.

*“I don’t know, why? Where are we going?”* - I asked.

*“To get you some real clothes, the stuff you got on now won’t last long here, you’ll need something a little more sturdy.”*

*“Where would we do that?”* - I asked, completely confused.

*“You know the gas station you were at?”*

*“Yeah?”* - I replied

*“It’s probably gonna disappear soon.”*

*“What? What do you mean disappear?”*

*“That’s all there is to it son, they just disappear. Hardware stores, convenience stores, gas stations, motels - and if you’re lucky - gun stores. They come and go about once a month and I happen to know of a hardware store that’s got everything you’ll need about 7 hours north-east of here.”*

*“Okay…”* - I responded, a little surprised at how casually Russell was talking about it.

*“So, you up for it or not?”* - He asked as he stood up on the porch.

*“Yeah, sure.”* - I replied after a few seconds.

*“Alright then, let’s head inside and eat something before we go.”*

And so we made our way inside, Russell pulled out two cans of beans in tomato sauce from the tiny pantry in the corner of the living room. He opened the cans and emptied them into one of those survival kit pots and hung it on the makeshift cooking station made of cast iron that stood in the fireplace. He lit the fire and we waited.

\*\*\*

After about 10 minutes or so, the food was done. I hadn’t had actual food for more than two days and in hindsight, I don’t even understand how I hadn’t starved; maybe it had to do with this place. Russell went back to the pantry in the corner of the room and pulled out two porcelain bowls and two spoons and put them on the table.

*“You must be starving kid, dig in.”* - He said as he sat down on the chair in front of me.

*“Thanks.”* I said as I pulled out a chair and sat down.

I poured some of the beans in my bowl and just started gorging on them. Plain beans in tomato sauce had never tasted so good before, probably because I was quite literally starving. Which made me once again think about why I hadn’t really *felt* all that hungry.

*“Say Russ, how come I haven’t felt hungry since I ended up here when all I’ve had is some Fritos and half a can of beer?”* - I asked after I finished my bowl of beans.

*“Alright so, I’m not totally sure but it seems like our bodies can’t sense how long it’s been since we’ve eaten. That said, you still need to eat or you’ll die, our bodies still work the same, they just don’t react like they should or - send the right signals.”*

*“Oh, okay”* - I responded.

*“Alright, I’m ready kid. We should head out as soon as possible so prepare whatever you need and meet me outside.”* - Russell said as soon as he finished his food.

*“Yep.”* - I replied as I walked back to my room.

I entered my room and sat down on the bed, there wasn’t really anything for me to prepare so all I did was just make sure that my shoes were laced tightly. After lacing my shoes I sat up straight again, took a deep breath and headed out. I sat by the dining table in the living room and waited for a few minutes. Russell came out of his room, fully geared and ready to go. Part of me was a little worried about how I had basically nothing but regular clothes.

*“Alright kid, let’s go.”* - Russell said as he put on his hiking backpack.

*“Oh right, almost forgot, wait here.”* - Russell said as he walked back into his room.

I heard him rummaging through his room, looking for something.

*“There it is!”* - He exclaimed as he started walking back out to the living room.

In his right hand, he had one of those modern survival hatchets. It was small but it looked sharp and well-maintained.

*“Here ya’ go.”* - He said as he handed me the hatchet.

*“Thanks.”* - I replied

Russell opened the front door and made his way outside and I followed.

*“Alright now where’s my compass?”* - Russell said to himself as he dug through the multitude of pockets he had on his cargo pants.

*“I got one.”* - I said as I pulled out my swiss army knife.

*“North east right?”* - I said as I looked back up towards Russell.

*“Yep, just point the direction and we’ll start walking.”* - He said as he looked out into the woods.

I turned until the red triangle pointed towards north-east,

*“That way.”* - I said as I pointed in the same direction.

*“Alright let’s go.”* - Russell said and started walking.

I’ll spare you the details of this long trek, not much happened which was a nice change. We walked for about two hours at a time and took breaks in between, pretty much only talking during those breaks, mostly about basic stuff like the weather, nature and politics. As we walked, I spent most of the time just fiddling around with the hatchet Russell had given me. And after three breaks and *a lot* of walking, we were almost there.

*“Alright kid, we should be pretty close by now.”* - Russell said in a relieved tone.

*“About time!”* - I responded.

*“Hahaha, yeah must be real uncomfortable walking in those plastic so-called shoes you got on.”* - Russell said as he looked back towards me over his shoulder.

*“Eh, they’re not too bad.”* - I said as I looked down at my shoes, knowing Russell was 100% correct.

*“There it is!”* - Russell said as he pointed forwards.

*“Where?”* - I asked.

*“Right ahead.”* - He said as he picked up the pace.

We got closer to the border of the woods and, just outside the forest there stood a huge hardware store. It stood by the side of the old tarmac, it didn’t fit in at all. It was way too big for its surroundings, it was as if it was pushing away the nature around it to make space for itself. There wasn’t even a parking lot or anything, it was just there. So we stepped onto the tarmac, Russell tapped the road with the toe box of his combat boot.

*“Yup, this road ain’t real.”*

*“What do you mean?”* - I asked, a little confused.

*“This road right here, it doesn’t exist in real life. My bet is that it’ll be gone within a few weeks, just like the hardware store.”* - He said as he looked both ways while slowly crossing the road.

*“Oh.”* - I answered.

We now stood in front of the hardware store. “Heft n’ Craft”, the big plastic letters spelled on the front wall over the entrance, its green light illuminating its immediate surroundings.

*“Heft n’ Craft… What kinda name is that?”* - I scoffed.

*“Yeah, no idea kid.”* - Russell said as he chuckled.

*“Well, we better get in there and get all we need before nightfall.”* - Russell said before I could say anything else.

As the electric, automatic doors opened, I thought to myself that this would be fun. A shopping spree without having to pay a penny sounded pretty nice to me. But, I was wrong, to say the least.

\*\*\*

We were now inside, some background music was playing on the speakers all around the store, the echo it made through the otherwise completely silent store was a little unsettling. The background music wasn’t the kind of music you’d expect either, it was more like the background music you’d hear in an elevator. As we slowly walked through the store, I looked around at the shelves stacked with all kinds of tools and thingamajigs, it looked like nobody had been here at all, as if it was completely new.

*“Alright kid, first things first, go get yourself a big hiking backpack, like mine.”* - Russell said as he turned slightly, so as to show me his backpack.

*“Yes.”* - I answered in a “copy that” - kind of tone.

*“Then you should change into some fitting clothes, sturdy boots, tactical clothes and a real… jacket.”* - Russell said as he looked me up and down, a look of slight pity on his face.

*“Yeah, I’ll get to it.”* - I said, feeling a little embarrassed over my clothes, even though I shouldn’t have.

*“Good, I’ll go get some stuff I need to stock up on now, since we’re two people now.”* - Russell said as he smiled.

And so we headed in our separate directions, I went to the clothing and boots section. As soon as I got there, I saw a pair of black hiking boots. They were pretty similar to Russell’s, just a little more sleek and modern-looking. They were the only ones that caught my eye and they felt comfortable so I decided I’d take them. My next objective was pants, I walked over to where all the pants were and again - one of them caught my eye. A pair of black cargo pants with gray zippers on all the pockets. I tried them on and they felt nice and most importantly - looked cool, so I took them.

*“Man, this is pretty cool, I feel kinda badass.”* - I thought to myself as I looked down on my pants and boots.

And that’s when I remembered Russell had told me to get myself a backpack first, so before getting any more clothes, I decided I should do that first. I went over to the area where the backpacks were, there were only three different kinds of hiking backpacks, a camo-green one with orange details, a dark-blue one with white details and a black one with gray details. Naturally, I picked the black one. I put my new hiking backpack on and went back to the clothing section.

\*\*\*

I now had all the clothes I needed and a cool, black tactical jacket. I walked over to a mirror and looked at myself, I thought I looked more awesome than I had ever done before. Who knew that actually putting some thought into the clothes you wear would feel like this? As I was posing in the mirror, a voice called out to me out of nowhere, startling me.

*“You all set kid?”* - Russell called out from my right.

I flinched as I snapped my head towards the direction of the voice. It was, of course, Russell.

*“Hahaha, did I scare ya’?”* - Russell teased.

*“Yeah, haha.”* - I awkwardly chuckled, having almost soiled my brand new pants.

*“Well? You got everything?”* - He asked to reiterate his question.

*“Yes sir, everything.”* - I answered.

*“Well alright, let’s…”* - Russell stopped in the middle of his sentence as he looked past me, looking like he was listening for a sound.

*“Russ? What’s going on?”* - I asked quietly.

*“You hear that?”* - He asked.

*“No. What is it?”*

*“I dunno’.”* - He said as he slowly started walking towards the direction the sound was coming from.

I turned to look in the same direction, and as I started walking with him, I grabbed my hatchet that I had hung on the right side of my backpack. After a few steps, I heard the sound. It was almost like the sound of someone rummaging through the shelves, occasionally broken up by a pitter-patter kind of sound.

*“Stay here.”* - Russell whispered as he reached behind with his hand, so as to show me that he wanted me to stay.

*“Okay.”* - I whispered back.

As he turned to look down the aisle where the sound was coming from, his eyes went wide and he looked pale. He looked like he was in shock. But before he could do anything, a loud screech-noise erupted and filled the building, it was almost deafening and - I immediately recognized it. It was those God damned kids. Russell snapped out of it and started running at me.

*“Run kid!”* - He yelled, his voice making my whole body vibrate.

I did as he said and started running. I could now hear the thing behind us start chasing us, I looked back and saw the scratcher slip and crash right into some shelves. I looked back ahead and followed Russell’s lead. We were now at the checkout, Russ stopped for a split second while looking around.

*“Alright let’s hide over there, quick!”* - Russell said as he pointed to one of the store counters.

We dove under the counter and sat up, we could barely fit. As we sat, balled up under the counter, that same, blood-curdling screech filled the store again. A few moments later we started hearing the footsteps of the scratcher, its long, black, nails that were now more like claws scraping against the floor.

*“Why is that thing here!? It’s not supposed to be here now!”* - Russell whispered to himself frantically, boiling with rage.

*“Didn’t you say those things only appear during the morning?”* - I asked.

*“Yeah, I thought so!”* - Russell whispered.

The footsteps stopped for a second before resuming, this time getting further away. We kept hiding for a few minutes before Russell slowly crawled out from under the counter, stood up and started looking around. He bent down and looked at me, who was still balled up, scared shitless.

*“I think it’s fine now.”* - He said as he reached out to help me get up.

I nodded as I crawled out and grabbed his hand, he pulled me up as I stood up. I patted down my clothes to get rid of dust and whatnot - but strangely - there wasn’t any. Russell let down his rifle from his shoulder and held it at his hips while looking around. I was still holding my hatchet as well. After a few seconds we assumed it was safe, so we started walking towards the exit. Russell gestured for me to get in front of him, so I nodded and started walking.

\*\*\*

It was dark out by now, I could see myself in the reflection of the glass pane of the automatic doors. I kept walking towards them, until something caught my eye, something in the reflection. I couldn’t quite see what it was so I stopped and tried to focus on it. Before I realized what it was, it was already too late. It was the scratcher, creeping behind a shelf. I turned around quickly.

*“Watch out!”* - I yelled, pointing at the scratcher.

As the scratcher realized it had been caught, it pounced on Russ before he could react. The scratcher tackled him to the ground, making him drop his rifle. Russell screamed out in fear as he was wrestling the scratcher. It was now on top of him, inches from his face, gnawing at the air. Russell turned his head to look at me.

*“Get out of here kid! Run!”* - He screamed at me as he struggled against the scratcher’s brute strength.

I snapped out of it, turned around and started running, as the automatic doors started opening slowly, I tried to pry them open in panic. That’s when I asked myself what I was doing. Was I really gonna just leave him behind? After he had saved me and taken care of me? Without Russ I would’ve been dead. I couldn’t leave him behind.

I turned back around, looked down at my hatchet and charged the scratcher that was getting closer and closer to biting Russell’s face off. I screamed out as I swung my hatchet at the back of the scratcher’s head. As I planted my hatchet in the back of its skull, the scratcher let out a horrible screech in pain. I backed away as the scratcher turned towards me. It cried out in pain and shook its head around, it was horrifying. I readied my hatchet as it started running towards me on all fours. It pounced on me this time, and as soon as it was within reach, I swung my hatchet once more with all my might. The hatchet sliced right into the side of its skull, cutting right through its left eye before stopping, the scratcher went limp immediately. I stood there, looking at the lifeless scratcher I was holding up with my hatchet, I was unsurprisingly in shock. I dropped the hatchet and as I did, the scratcher plopped down on the floor along with it. I once again snapped out of my shock and started running towards Russell.

*“Russ!”* - I yelled as I ran to his side and sat down.

*“Hey! Wake up man!”* - I yelled while shaking him.

I looked around on his body to look for any blood, there was, and a lot of it too. On the right side of his stomach, there was a gash, it looked just like mine. As I looked at his wound, my mind started racing in panic. I didn’t know what to do. Russell coughed.

*“Hey! Russ! Wake up!”* - I yelled again.

*“Right… compartment… bandage.”* - Russell tried his best to talk.

*“Where!? In your backpack!?”* - I asked frantically.

Russell nodded. I turned him on his right side to access the right compartment of his backpack, he groaned in pain. I opened the compartment and started looking for the bandage. After throwing out everything that was in there, I found it.

*“I got it!”* - I said.

*“We gotta’ get your jacket off!”* - I said.

I sat Russell up as I pulled off his backpack and then his jacket. I pulled his shirt up and started wrapping the bandage around his abdomen. I didn’t really know what I was doing but I had to stop the bleeding somehow. I wrapped it as tight as I could and before I knew it, it had run out. So I tied it up and put pressure on the wound, Russell groaning in pain once again as I did so.

*“I’m alright kid.”* - Russell said quietly, barely being able to talk.

Without responding, I laid down on my back and closed my eyes, a feeling of hopelessness once again washing over me. I knew I wasn’t gonna survive without Russell.
