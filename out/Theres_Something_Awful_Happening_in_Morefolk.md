Ladies and gentlemen of Morefolk, you all must be terribly confused. I've sent this message to your emails and your phones, which took quite a lot of time, so please listen to me. As you're all well aware, there have been a series of murders in this town of ours. Murders that have, up to this point, had their details kept private. For the "sake of investigation", as our police department puts it, the specifics of these crimes have been kept under wraps. Bullshit. All of it. It's all a load of bullshit. Our police aren't keeping this information secret for the security of the investigation. They're doing it out of cowardice. 

Isn't it strange that, even in a small town like this where everyone is connected, nobody seems to know anything about the recent deaths?  Ellie... Sasha... Claire... Jackie... all taken away from us. Yet, nobody has anything to say? Do you seriously believe that the husbands of the pregnant women that were slaughtered are keeping quiet because they're too "traumatized"? Or, perhaps they keep quiet due to some kind of nondisclosure agreement they have with the police, right? Wrong... all wrong. The police have BRIBED and BULLIED the husbands of the victims into silence.

It's come to my attention through my own investigation that this goes deeper than just the police force. They're being ordered around by an agency that remains unnamed even within the files I've managed to crack. All this is to say, this situation is much more than it seems on the surface. After finding what I've dug up, it's obvious to me why they're trying to keep the husbands quiet. You know what? Fuck that. I never trusted these damn cops. I knew something suspicious was going on. You all have a right to know the truth. 

Below is a leak of a transcript containing some very... interesting information. The police force is going to lie to you, they'll tell you that what I am about to expose is purely fabricated. They're cowards, all of them. I dare you to look into their eyes as they lie to your face, and tell yourself that you trust them. With that being said, allow me to grant you the real truth.

(Start of Transcript)

Detective Casper: "Alright, the date is February 17th, it's 8:45 AM. My name is detective Casper. Everything from here on out is on the record. Mister Middleton, I appreciate your willingness to speak about what happened last night. Typically we wouldn't... handle things this way. We'd have you cleared psychologically first, and this session wouldn't occur for a while longer. Unfortunately, this isn't a conventional situation. I hope you understand.‚Äù

Middleton: "Yeah... I do"

Detective Casper: "That being said... your voice is shaky, and your eyes are still red. Are you okay? Can you do this right now?"

Middleton: "Do I look okay to you? I'll be "okay" when that crazy bitch gets executed. You hear me?"

Detective Casper: "I hear you, and I promise you, the more help you give us, the closer we'll get to delivering justice. You're doing a brave thing here today, I hope you know that."

Middleton: "I'm not fucking brave. I couldn't do anything to stop that... that goddamn monster. I'm not brave. I'm angry. I just want that thing dead."

Detective Casper: "I know... I would too, trust me. You keep referring to the suspect in rather inhuman terms. Why is that? Was the suspect wearing a mask or some other form of concealing clothing that made them appear less human?"

Middleton: "You... you aren't going to believe me... I just know that thing couldn't have been human... it couldn't have been... it looked human but it just wasn't."

Detective Casper: "I apologize, I've gotten ahead of myself. Let's not focus on that right now. Let's start from the very beginning. Typically, criminals of this sort tend to "stalk" and "survey" the homes of their victims. They spend time figuring out the schedules and patterns of behavior of their victims. Did you notice anything strange before this tragedy happened? Maybe a car suspiciously driving past your house repeatedly? Perhaps someone consistently looking at your property? Anything at all?"

Middleton: "No, never. Everything seemed so... so normal. I swear, I didn't see anything like that."

Detective Casper: "I understand. Thank you. I would also like to mention, if at any time you require something to drink or eat during this interview, please tell me. We will be happy to accommodate you."

Middleton: "I'm okay, thanks. If... if I put anything into my stomach, I'm afraid I'll just vomit again. My throat already hurts enough as is..."

Detective Casper: "Understood. Once again, you're being very brave, please stay strong, for your wife."

Middleton: "Please... call her Jackie..."

Detective Casper: "Sure. Do it for Jackie, okay?"

Middleton: "Yeah... for Jackie...."

Detective Casper: "Alright, thank you, Mr. Middleton. Now, going forward, I'm going to ask you to describe the events that happened last night. If at any point in time you feel uncomfortable, we can take a break. Do you understand?"

Middleton: "I understand, I do...."

Detective Casper: "Very well, let's proceed. According to your call with dispatch, the events unfolded at or around 1:13 AM. Is this correct?"

Middleton: "That's correct."

Detective Casper: "Right, now then, could you explain what exactly happened that night? I will ask you to be concise, but I will refrain from interrupting you. I'm all ears, okay?"

Middleton: "Alright... well, Jackie and I were in bed, asleep. I remember waking up to the sound of thumping. I couldn't exactly place it, but I soon realized it was coming from underneath the bed. Jackie woke up right after that. I got out of bed and... I looked at the floor. There was a fucking hand... just, sticking out from under the bed. It was a woman's hand. This whole time, the thumping from under the bed just continued and continued..."

Detective Casper: Was there anything on the hand? Any jewelry, any identifying scarring or tattoo?"

Middleton: "No... nothing like that. It was just a pale hand. Jackie couldn't see it at the time, but she was already really freaked out by the bumping. I shouted at the person under the bed, I told them to come out. I heard a lot of shifting around, and the bumping immediately stopped. The hand stretched forward and clawed at the floor like it was dragging the rest of the body forward with it. I... oh Jesus..."

Detective Casper: "Are you alright?"

Middleton: "I can keep going... please. I can do this."

Detective Casper: "Very well, please continue."

Middleton: "It took a while for that... that thing to come all the way out. It... it looked like a nude woman, but it just... it was so off. It couldn't have been human. There's just no way."

Detective Casper: "How do you mean? What made it appear so inhuman to you?"

Middleton: "There was... a long, stitched-up gash on her abdomen. Her eyes were so cloudy and grey... and it looked like tears were leaking out of them. She was nearly bald, her head only had a few short hairs sticking out of it. Oh God, the smell... she smelled like utter shit... and the way she moved. She didn't stand up at first. She just laid on the floor and looked up at me... You have to believe me. That thing was not a human. It was something else... I'm not crazy. I swear on my life I'm telling the truth."

Detective Casper: "I believe you, I do. You're a great help to us right now. Here, take some tissues. It's okay. You're doing great. Take your time, alright?"

Middleton: "Thank you... I uhm.. I appreciate it. Please continue to believe me... What I'm about to say doesn't sound real, but, but... but it is. I promise it is."

Detective Casper: "I'm here for you. It's okay. Every detail matters."

Middleton: "Okay... Okay... She uh, she opened her lips while staring at me. She didn't move her mouth or... or move her lips or tongue. But she made this, just... this awful noise. It sounded like an infant crying. Just... that sound coming out from her lips, it isn't natural. It isn't human. The crying sounded... like if you took a recording of an infant crying and you looped it over and over again. It was the most horrific shit I've ever heard."

Detective Casper: "She didn't even move her mouth? You said it sounded as if the crying were coming from a recording. Did you happen to notice any audio-playing devices on her person?"

Middleton: "No... she was completely naked, she couldn't have hidden one anywhere. That... that sound... it was coming from her.."

Detective Casper: "I understand. Please, continue, if possible. What happened after that?"

Middleton: "I just... froze. I couldn't move a muscle. It was like I was having a sleep paralysis episode. My body was stiff as a rock, and she stood up and faced Jackie. Jackie must've been so scared... she couldn't move either. She just laid in bed, with a look of horror on her face... Oh God... I should've done something, but I just... I couldn't. I felt completely numb."

Detective Casper: "It's understandable, oftentimes we freeze up in horrifying moments. It isn't your fault."

Middleton: I know, but... this was different... This wasn't just me freezing up in fear, it was like... it was like nothing I've ever felt before. She, uh, she was standing next to Jackie, and... I... I think I'm gonna be sick. Please, can I just... take a break? Please?

Detective Casper: "Of course. We'll take a fifteen-minute recess. You're doing a fantastic job, you deserve a break."

(15 Minutes Pass)

Detective Casper: "Alright, we are now back in session. Mister Middleton, are you comfortable resuming where we left off?"

Middleton: "Yeah... I am. I still feel sick, but I have to do this. I do. That monster stood next to Jackie and... it just... it tore into her. It just dug its horrible fingers into her stomach and began ripping and clawing and just... it was so awful. There was so much screaming and so much blood... oh my God. Jackie... Our poor baby... he was supposed to be our baby... he was supposed to be alive. He was supposed to be named Jack. He was supposed to be alive and be our baby. And that fucking monster just... took him from us. It clawed its way inside and ripped Jackie open and tore out our child..."

Detective Casper: "Please, Mister Middleton, I know you must be hurting. Please, stay focused, or you'll upset yourself further. What did the suspect do with the child?" 

Middleton: "She... She... she tore into her own abdomen... she tore her stitches apart and opened her own abdomen... her own womb... and she forced our baby inside of her... she fucking... she fucking... oh dear God..."

Detective Casper: "Mister Middleton, our forensics crew didn't recover any DNA that might belong to the suspect as of yet. From the sound of it, she should have bled quite profusely inside of the room, based on your description. Wouldn't you think so?"

Middleton: "I told you, she's not fucking human. She didn't even bleed. It was like... just an empty cavity in her abdomen. And she stuffed our baby in there... my wife is dead, my unborn baby is dead... you think a human could have done something like this?"

Detective Casper: "I think you're understandably upset by this event. I think that some details might be exaggerated or misunderstood in your head."

Middleton: "You don't... you don't believe me, do you?"

Detective Casper: "Look... we are taking everything into account. We are truly trying to bring justice for you, Jackie, and Jack. We really are. We are going to consider your account going forward in our investigation. Your help is appreciated, Mister Middleton."

Middleton: "Fine... believe me or don't. But mark my words. When you find the fucker that's responsible for this, you'll see that it's only a vicious creature. Don't try to reason with it. Don't try to arrest it. Put a bullet in its fucking skull? You understand me?"

Detective Casper: "Noted. Do you have anything more you would like to add to the record?" 

Middleton: "Just... just kill it..."

Detective Casper: ‚ÄúAlright, this marks the end of the recording at 9:27 AM‚Äù

(End of Transcript)

Funny how the "official record" is still being kept secret, huh? These bastards know what they're doing. Every single interview with the husbands has consistent themes. No signs of forced entry into the home. Knocking under the bed. The man is unable to move. The descriptions of the woman and the sounds she makes. What she does to the poor mother and child... it's all consistent. Something horrible is happening in this town. The police, and whatever agency is contacting them, are suppressing this information. I am going to blow this whole thing wide open. I am going to find out what's going on, for the sake of our town. 

Know that this is not the final leak I will spread. Know that I am urging each of you to embrace the truth. Know that I am calling on each husband they tried to threaten and bribe into silence to speak out. You all have a right to safety and transparency. This cannot continue, for the sake of our friends and family. Morefolk is a place of dignity, there's no room for gruesome murder and government corruption here. This will not be the last you hear of me. 

Signing off for now,
