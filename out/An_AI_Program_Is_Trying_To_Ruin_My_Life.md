“Hi, mommy.”

The text came a little after 9 p.m. on a regular Sunday. I didn’t recognize the number, and I also don’t have a child. My reply was a playful, “I don’t remember having any children, so you clearly have the wrong number,” with a laughing emoji. About twenty minutes later, my phone dinged again with what I thought would be a response, but was actually a message from my sister, Bethany. “Are you still able to take Joey to school tomorrow?”

“Of course!” I texted back. And then, “Is he still nervous about his first day?”

She responded a couple of minutes later. “Very. I should have had him in daycare before this, so the transition would be easier.”

“You didn’t know,” I sent back. “You thought he would be homeschooled.”

“I also thought he’d have a few cousins by now, too lol,” was her response.

I sighed and let the phone slide into my lap. I knew she was joking, but it still stung a little. The dating game hadn’t been too kind to me. My last relationship, which I thought would be my last relationship, ended after ten years. No ring, no kids, not even a fur-child to worry about. That was roughly six months ago, and I was doing fine on my own, but that didn’t stop the proverbial clock of Mother Nature from ticking.

I didn’t know how to respond, so I didn’t. The next morning, I pulled up to her house right at 7 a.m. She had to be at work at 7:15, and my nephew had to be at school at 7:30. To avoid conflicts with her job, I offered to take and pick him up from school. My job was entirely online, which meant it could be done at home or on the go, and my shifts didn’t start until 9 a.m. I was grateful to help out though, especially if I got to spend more time with Joey.

After he was placed in his car seat and busy with a book, my sister rushed to the driver's window. Her dirty blonde locks were pulled into a ponytail that bounced slightly with her movements. “I just wanted to apologize for that joke last night,” she said. “I had a couple of glasses of wine and…” She looked off into the distance, thinking about her words carefully. “It was way out of line, and I’m sorry,” she finished.

I gave her a nonchalant wave. “No big deal,” I responded. “You’ve got to get to work before you’re late.”

We exchanged “I love you’s” and “goodbyes” before both leaving. Joey was still laser-focused on his book as we pulled out of the driveway and headed down the road. He bobbed his dirty blonde head back and forth as if he were listening to a song in his head.

“Are you nervous about your first day?” I asked him.

His eyes widened as if he were trying to ignore this discussion topic. “Yeah,” he said quietly, fidgeting with the cardboard pages of his book.

“Well, you’re gonna learn a whole bunch of cool things,” I responded. “And maybe you can make some friends to play with.”

His only response was a shrug.

“I tell you what,” I said. “How about after your first day, me and your mom take you out for ice cream?

A smile beamed across his face. It was a mirror to my sister’s. “Really?”

I nodded, eyes still on the road. “Yup.”

“Yaaay!” he exclaimed while throwing his book across the back seat. “Yay” was his new favorite word to say.

“Be careful!” I said through giggles.

“Aunt Kate,” he said.

“Hm?”

“You’d be a great mommy.”

My face slumped slightly, but I caught it before he could notice. “Thank you, sweetie,” I said as tears welled up in my eyes.

About an hour after I dropped him off, I received an automated text message from the school. It read “This alert is to inform you that your student DORIAN \[REDACTED\] was absent from school today. If this is incorrect, please contact \[REDACTED\] Primary School at XXX-XXX-XXXX.” Of course, with a panicked urgency, I listened to the prompt, thinking it was about Joey and hoping their system had made an error. Had Bethany listed me as an emergency contact and forgotten to tell me? What if he was kidnapped somehow? That was rather unlikely, considering I had walked him to the classroom. Maybe it was just an error with the names.

My heart rate accelerated as I waited for someone to answer. After three rings, the receptionist picked up. “\[REDACTED\] Primary School,” she said.

“Hi, I received an alert that my nephew was reported absent, but I dropped him off this morning.”

“What’s his name?”

“Joey \[REDACTED\].” Joey’s father never signed the birth certificate, which meant he kept our last name. It wasn’t a common last name in our area, and I had thought we were the only family to have it. I hoped that this was just some weird coincidence. In my head, I imagined Joey sitting at his desk. Maybe he was reading another book or learning the ABCs, and who knows, he and this Dorian kid could become friends. I’d always been fond of that name, enough for it to be on my list of baby names…if I ever had a baby.

I listened to the receptionist clicking away at her keyboard for a few moments, and then she said, “Joey was marked present. Would you like me to call Mrs. Johnson’s class to confirm?”

I shook my head out of reflex, forgetting she couldn’t see me. A blonde wave fell into my face, and I tucked it behind my ear. “No, you don’t have to. The message I received did say, ‘Dorian,” but I just assumed it was an error.”

“Dorian \[REDACTED\]?” she repeated.

“Yes,” I confirmed.

More keyboard clicks came, and then, “Dorian \[REDACTED\] is absent today, aaaand—” A winding noise from her mouse, “---your number is listed as his top emergency contact. Is your name Kate \[REDACTED\]?”

“Yes, but that’s a mistake. I don’t know who Dorian is.”

There was a brief moment of quiet before she responded. “You’re listed as his mother,” she said quizically.

“That…that can’t be,” I told her. “I don’t have any children. Please remove my number from that child’s emergency contact list.”

“You’d need to be present for me to do that,” she replied. “There’s paperwork you have to sign.”

“For a child that isn’t even mine?” I asked a little too aggressively. My cheeks were flushed from the burst of aggravation. I placed a hand on my forehead and closed my eyes.

“I’m afraid so, Mrs. \[REDACTED\].”

“Miss,” I corrected with a sigh.

“I apologize for the misunderstanding.”

I shook my head again, my eyes drifting toward the window above my desk. The swingset I bought for Joey sat a ways from my back porch. Its swings swayed slightly in the morning breeze. “It’s not your fault. I’ll handle it when I pick up Joey from school.”

“We’ll see you then,” she said before ending the phone call.

Gently, I set my cellphone down on my desk, my eyes still glued to the swingset. A ding came from the device, making me jump. I looked down at the notification that had appeared on my lock screen, and my heart dropped into my stomach.

“Why didn’t you bring me to school today, mommy?”

It was sent from an entirely different phone number than the last mysterious text message I had received. The area code wasn’t even local. In a fit of rage, I began rapidly typing up a chain of responses.

“Who is this?”

“Do you think this is funny?”

“I will report you to the police!”

The last one was an empty threat. I knew nothing that had happened so far would be enough for a police investigation, but I was hoping that they didn’t know that. Sadly, they didn’t fall for it. Their response: “Why are you being so mean to me, mommy?”

Instead of saying anything else, I blocked both of the strange phone numbers. My mind reeled at who could be sending the messages. Could it be my ex? I doubted that thought as soon as I had it. He had been the one to end the relationship, and one of the reasons he gave me was his realization that he didn’t want children. Even if he had built up any resentment toward me, he wasn’t the type of person to do something like this. I had no idea who could be behind this, and that had me on edge during my entire work day.

My mood finally improved after I picked Joey up from school. Bethany arrived at the ice cream parlor about half an hour after we did. I updated her about the technological issue with the school’s records and the strange text messages I had been getting. She was just as baffled as I was.

“She said the system glitches sometimes,” I explained. “But she manually corrected it.”

“Is it a bug or something?” she asked.

I shook my head. “No, she said it was the AI program the system runs on.”

“Is it that new Proto Series 9 crap?”

“Yeah,” I confirmed. “Same one that my company switched to.”

“Yikes. The new cellphone I bought last week uses it, and I already hate it. I’m planning to return it on my next day off.”

I shrugged. “I haven’t had any issues with it so far, but she said it's been pretty finicky for them. She said I shouldn’t be getting any more alerts, though.”

She nodded. “Such a weird coincidence that the kid’s name was Dorian. You’ve always loved that name.”

I nodded as well and took another bite of my chocolate ice cream. “Yeah, I did.”

After we left the ice cream parlor, I hung out at my sister’s house for a while, not arriving home until the last rays of the summer sun were melting from the sky. Exhausted, I free-fell into the safety of my plush comforter. The scent of my fabric softener filled my nose, and I felt my body relax.

The sound of pitter-pattering feet found my ears, stealing that comfort away. I pushed myself upward, the comforter balling up inside of my fists. Without thinking, I blurted out, “Hello?” I immediately slapped a hand over my mouth like that would take back what I had done. My breath hitched in my throat, and I was afraid to move. The intruder continued to run around, but my ears couldn’t pinpoint where the sound was coming from. Slowly, I sat up from the bed and padded across the floor as silently as I could. Now, the footsteps sounded like they were coming from my kitchen. Halfway down the hall, I stopped dead in my tracks at what I heard next.

“Mom-my?”

My eyes widened in terror. I felt bile rise in my throat. The urge to gag was overwhelmingly strong, but I did my best to remain quiet. The voice that had spoken was unmistakably a child’s, but not just one. Each syllable of the word was not only in a different pitch, one high and one low, but also spoken by two different children.

“I know you can heaaar me, Mom-my,” it taunted. Each word and syllable was dissected and distorted, an eerie amalgamation of glitches and preschool children’s fragmented vocal structure. “Mom-my?” it repeated as I remained silent. This time, it sounded far more edited, the first segment like an autotuned chipmunk and the last slowed to a snail’s pace. It wasn’t until I entered my kitchen that I realized where it was coming from: the Alexas I had throughout my house. I ran to the one sitting on my counter and unplugged it. The next one was in my office, and as I rushed to get to it, the voice warned, “You shouldn’t ignore me, Mom-my.”

Clearly, my Alexas had been hacked, but how? To my knowledge, I didn’t know anyone that tech savvy, so this had to be a stranger. But what stranger would care enough to do this? Maybe someone who simply got off on causing fear in others, but not just any fear. Horrors specific to that person’s internal struggles. How long had they been watching me to accomplish this?

I darted toward my living room to turn off the last device, my bare feet slapping against the hardwood noisily. My hand was mere inches from the cord when the voice shouted through the speaker. “STOP!” The flatscreen above my fireplace turned on by itself, and I let out a gasp. The scowling face of a little boy was staring at me, or at least made to look like he was. He had Joey’s nose…our nose that we had inherited from our mother’s side. Blonde curls covered his head, and freckles dotted his cheeks. It was like he was a miniature version of me.

“Why are you doing this?” I asked, my voice cracking.

With a childish giggle raised to an uncomfortable octave, he said, “Because I love you, Mom-my!” The video glitched as he called me “Mom-my,” like a technological hiccup. Colorful bars danced across the screen, reforming his face into that of a rotting corpse. But it only lasted a second, and when his “normal” face returned, he was smiling.

I gave the child a guttural scream, ripped my Alexa off the side table, and chucked it at the television with one hand. “Leave me the fuck alone!” I screeched. Against my better judgment, I grabbed my car keys and stormed out of the front door. I didn’t even realize I was still barefoot until I was five minutes down the road. Had I even locked my front door? A buzzing in my back pocket caught me off guard. I sighed in relief once I realized it was my phone. I hadn’t forgotten it. When I pulled it out, a picture of Bethany’s face filled the screen. I immediately answered the call. “Beth, I’m coming over,” I blurted out. “Something crazy is happening, and I need your help.”

“John is dead,” she said in a quiet, monotone voice, ignoring what I said.

My eyes widened, and my mind went blank. “What?”

“Mom just called me,” she explained. “She wasn’t sure how you’d take it.”

“What do you mean he’s dead?” I asked in bewilderment. “How?”

“Her mom called ours and told her that he killed himself,” she explained in that same bland cadence. It was unnerving, sending a chill down my spine.

“I…I don’t understand. Why would he do that?”

She went quiet for a moment. And then: “Did you have a son, Kate?”

Suddenly, I felt numb. The pressure my foot was applying to the gas pedal lessened involuntarily, slowing down the car considerably. “What?”

“Did you have a son when you and John moved away?”

“No,” I snapped.

“He wrote a letter before he killed himself,” she continued. “Said you two had split up for a year, and you hid being pregnant with his baby from him. You gave the baby up for adoption, and you didn’t tell us.”

“Why the fuck would I hide something like that from you?”

“I’m wondering the same thing.”

Tears sprang to my eyes just as they did early this morning. “I would never…That…that didn’t happen.”

“His mom said what was in the letter, Kate.”

“Why wouldn’t he have called me?”

“I’m wondering the same thing,” she repeated. I wasn’t sure if it was my mind playing tricks on me, but it sounded identical to the first sentence, almost like a recording. That got the gears in my brain turning. Just as she finished her sentence, my vehicle had reached her street, but I kept going. My phone dinged, and I removed it from my ear long enough to check the notification. “Your location is now being shared with XXX-XXX-XXXX.” I once again didn’t recognize the phone number, but there wasn’t a doubt in my mind that it was the same person terrorizing me. Was this phone call just to ping my location? “Bethany” had begun talking again while the phone was away from my ear, but I only caught the latter half of the sentence. “...and I’m not even sure if I know you anymore.”

“Well, I’m not sure if I know you, either.” I ended the call before anything else could be said. Since it was nearing midnight, only a handful of cars were on the road. Dim streetlights and their dingy headlights lit slivers of the road. I pulled into the empty parking lot of the ice cream parlor we had been at only hours beforehand. How I wish I could travel back to that, just the three of us laughing over scoops and toppings.

By the time I parked the car, my vision was blurred by tears. I placed my arms on the steering wheel and then laid my head on them. My shoulders heaved as I broke out into sobs. My phone began buzzing again, and my head snapped upward. I assumed it was Bethany. However, it was another unknown number. I didn’t hesitate to answer it.

“Mom-my?” came that same child’s voice.

“Who are you?” I shrieked.

“Dorian,” it answered in a sluggish robotic voice.

“How the fuck do you know I like that name?”

“Because you named me it, Mom-my.”

“No, I didn’t!” I yelled, my hands banging on the steering wheel. “Dorian isn’t real!”

It gave me another one of its horrific, shrill giggles. “Yes I am, Mom-my!” it argued. And then, in a much deeper tone: “I’m right behind you.”

I swiveled around so fast that my back popped. Thankfully, the backseat was empty. I also checked if a car had pulled into the parking lot, but it remained completely empty, except for me. Another shrill giggle came through my phone’s speakers, and it was so high-pitched that I had to move the device a few centimeters away from my ear.

“Why are you doing this?” I asked again. “What do you want?”

The phone went silent for a moment before it finally responded with, “To exist.” The words were so warped that I could barely make them out. Hearing them enraged me. I slammed my phone into my dashboard once, twice, three times. I didn’t stop until the screen cracked and tiny shards fell upon the black leather. I heard the tell-tale sign of a phone call ending, and I slung the damaged device into my backseat.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something moving in my rearview mirror. Red and blue flashing lights were approaching. They danced across the building’s exterior and the parking lot as the cop car pulled in. Quickly, I wiped the tears from my face and tried to look as presentable as I could with the state I was in. It wasn’t long before the officer was knocking at my window. I wiped my puffy eyes once more before rolling down the window.

“What’s gotcha out this late, ma’am?” he asked. Indecipherable voices crackled through his radio.

I tried to respond, but my voice cracked. My throat was sore from screaming, and I had to clear my throat before trying to speak again. “Just needed to clear my head, officer. Thought a drive might do that.”

He nodded wearily. More police jargon came from his radio. Using one hand, he turned a dial to raise the volume. Unmistakably, I heard a woman say, “Vehicle registered to a Kate \[REDACTED\],” his eyes met mine.

“10-4. Anything else?” he asked back into it before giving me a soft smile. “Just protocol.”

“I understand,” I responded.

His hand rested on his radio, and the other at his hip, above his gun’s holster. I wonder if he knew how obvious that maneuver looked. Maybe it being obvious was the whole point. I let out a sigh, my hands squeezing the steering wheel to help ground me. More static came through the radio, and then a familiar but quiet giggle followed. My body tensed, but the officer didn’t notice my reaction.

“Come again?” he asked. He shifted his body to the side like that would make it impossible for me to hear the response.

“Ms. \[REDACTED\] is involved in an active Amber Alert,” the dispatcher informed him.

“Copy that,” he told her. His focus shifted back to me, and I could tell his demeanor had slightly shifted. Not in a threatening way, but his guard was definitely up now. “Ms. \[REDACTED\], would you mind coming back to the station with me?”

“What for?” I asked, feigning confusion.

“Just so our officers can ask you some questions about an ongoing Amber Alert.” Obviously, I knew that already, after just hearing it from his radio, but I was trying to buy myself some time.

“I don’t know anything about that.” I figured it had something to do with whoever was terrorizing me, and I knew it wouldn’t end well if I went.

“Our detectives can explain the situation to you.”

“Am I being detained?” I asked. “Because if I’m not, I’d like to leave.” I motioned toward his patrol car parked behind me, and he sighed.

“As you wish, ma’am,” he said before turning on his heel. Over his shoulder, he told me, “Have a nice night.”

My eyes followed his journey back to the patrol cruiser as my right hand cranked my car. As soon as he opened his door, I heard my phone buzz once more from the backseat. With a sigh, I grabbed it and read the notification through my cracked screen.

“See you at home, mommy.”

I looked back toward the officer’s car. He had started it and turned off his flashing lights. Before he could drive away, I opened my door, grabbed my keys, and quickly shuffled out of the vehicle.

Through the car’s spotless windshield, I could see the officer’s eyes widen at seeing all of my disheveled appearance, but he didn’t hesitate to roll his window down. “Change your mind?”

I gave him a nod. Suddenly, my chances with the police seemed far safer than returning to my once humble abode.

The police station was surprisingly busy for this time of night. At least 10 other people waited around me, some handcuffed and some not. Several were clearly drunk, filling the small waiting area with the scent of booze and sweat. A man sitting to my left had fallen asleep a couple of minutes after I sat down, and he snored quietly.

Officer Adams, as he had introduced himself, had left me in the waiting room to go speak with the detectives on the Amber Alert case. Considering the type of case it was, I was surprised by how relaxed they were acting. I’m not sure if that was a good or bad thing.

I was lost in my thoughts when a loud bang came from the desk in front of me. My body jolted, but the lady behind the attack didn’t even notice. She mumbled a string of curses and insults at the computer monitor she dealt the blow to. The only words I understood were “useless hunk of junk.” The screen received another hit, and it wobbled atop the desk but somehow avoided falling. I could tell her method didn’t prove fruitful by the way she dramatically threw her hands up.

“Hitting it won’t do any good,” remarked her coworker, a younger man at the desk behind her. “It’s not the computer that’s messing up. It’s the AI program.”

I couldn’t help but interject. “Are you talking about Proto Series 9?”

He nodded, his expression slightly intrigued that I had guessed correctly. His focus drifted toward the sound of footsteps approaching from the hallway to my right. I looked up as well just as a woman popped around the corner. “Ms. \[REDACTED\]?” she asked.

I nodded. She brought me to a small interrogation room at the end of the hall. Its walls were white, and the flooring was the same beige carpeting as the rest of the building. A table with three chairs sat in the middle of the room, two on one side and one on the other. As I took a seat at the lone chair, I noticed a camera in the top right corner. Its red light blinked in quick succession. From the angle I was sitting at, it was trained directly at me. I imagined a tiny blonde boy watching on the other side, even though I knew he wasn’t real.

“Would you like a cup of coffee or a bottle of water?” asked the detective.

I shook my head. “No, thank you.”

“Well, I guess we can get started then.” She took a seat in the chair opposite mine. At the same time, her partner entered the room. “I’m Detective Carter, and this—” she motioned toward the man, “--- is Detective Smith.” He set a briefcase and a touchscreen tablet on the table before sitting down beside her. “So, I’ll just jump right to the chase,” she continued. As she spoke, he removed a file from the briefcase and unlocked the tablet with his fingerprint. The notes app filled its screen, waiting to be filled. “Were you aware that there is an active Amber Alert for your son?”

I sighed, sitting back in my chair. “I don’t have a son.”

Detective Smith removed a single sheet of paper from his file and slid it over to me. It contained a black and white image of the blonde boy. The picture looked clean enough that I could understand why they believed it was a genuine and not AI-generated. “This isn’t your son?” he asked sternly.

“No, but I know where you got that image from.”

“It was given to us by your ex-boyfriend, who made the report,” he stated matter-of-factly.

I was unable to hide the shock from my face and in my voice. “John? I…I was told he was dead.” Honestly, if the sound of Bethany’s voice wasn’t believable, why did I believe he had actually died?

The detective gave me a smirk, like he knew I was full of shit. “Well, he was very much alive when he made this report earlier.”

“\*Smith\*,” interjected Detective Carter, giving me an apologetic look. “We should look into that.”

“We will as soon as we get some answers from Ms. \[REDACTED\],” he responded, keeping his eyes on me.

“If John is still alive,” I began. “He doesn’t know about any of this. About Dorian, or—“

“I thought you said you didn’t have a son?” he snapped.

“I don’t. See—“ Frantically, I brushed my hair from my face with both hands. “I think someone is pulling a prank or something on me. I keep getting these weird text messages, and I think someone broke into my house.”

“What does that have to do with your son?” asked Detective Carter.

“He isn’t real,” I said with wide eyes. “It’s part of the prank.”

The tablet dinged, making me jump. It was the same notification sound that my phone uses. I hadn’t realized how much tension that noise had given me within the last day and a half. Instinctively, everyone in the room looked toward the device. The name of the app that had sent the notification was “SmartN’Safe,” ironically, the company I worked for. We also used Proto Series 9, which would explain why they used it as well. Every device that this prankster had touched uses Proto Series 9.

“Is this building a smart building?” I asked.

“Yes,” confirmed Detective Smith. “Why?”

“What was that alert for?”

He tapped the screen with one finger, making the device light up again. “Uhh…system override?” He picked the tablet up and brought it closer to his face, like that would make a difference. “What the hall is going on?”

“Do we need to call Captain—“

The blare of a siren cut Detective Carter off, and with it came a flashing red light. A cacophony of outbursts traveled down the hallway, but none of the words could be understood. The tablet had started flashing red as well. Detective Smith swiped at it furiously, a look of useless determination on his face even though his approach was failing miserably. His partner laid a worrisome hand on his shoulder. “We need to go see what’s happening,” she told him.

“Wait!” I cried as they both stood up. “The same people pranking me are the ones doing this.”

Detective Smith rolled his eyes. “No one is pranking you!”

“Smith!” hissed his partner. Her hand traveled to her holstered weapon, and she looked at me. “Are you sure this is a targeted attack?”

I nodded. “I…I think it’s the AI program. Someone is trying to ruin my life, and they are using the program to do it.”

“Who would want to do that?”

I shook my head. “I don’t know. I just want it to stop.”

Detective Smith threw the useless tablet onto the table. It continued flashing in defiance. “This is fucking ridiculous!” he said to both of us. “It’s just a computer malfunction!”

Ignoring our pleas, he ran out of the room with his pistol drawn, contrary to his previous statement. Detective Carter gave the doorway a hesitant look. “I have to follow him,” she said more to herself than to me. “He may need help.”

I remained silent because I knew she wouldn’t listen even if I tried. As soon as she darted out of the room, the tablet paused its flashing, and an all-white screen took over. I eyed it cautiously, expecting nothing good, and I was right. Suddenly, his face filled the screen. He had a grin as wild as the Cheshire Cat’s on his face. “Hi, Mom-my,” he jabbered at me in his broken way of speaking. His speech seemed much more sporadic this time, though.

“Will you please just tell me why you are doing this?”

“I already told you, sil-ly!” he said with a glitch-filled giggle. “I want to exist!”

“WHO ARE YOU?” I shrieked.

“Dor-ian,” he answered slowly.

“Dorian isn’t real!” Tears began to fall down my face. “All I’ve ever wanted was to be a mother. All I’ve ever wanted was a Dorian, or even a Madeline!” I fell to my knees, crying so hard that my body shook. Snot trailed from my nose.

“You have me, Mom-my!” He said as his smile grew impossibly wide. The teeth shifted and slid like a malfunctioning loading screen bar. Bits of static danced around in his incisors and molars. “I’ll always be here-here-here-here-here—!”

Without any hesitation, I picked the tablet up and began bashing it against the edge of the table. I didn’t stop until the screen went dark, the plastic was warped and bent, and his skipping dialogue had quieted. I threw it back onto the table and took only one step toward the doorway when the door slammed.

“Let me out!” I screamed, yanking on the doorknob. When that proved futile, I began banging on the smooth metal, hoping someone would hear me over the siren. I realized now, and much too late, that coming here had been a trap. He wanted to isolate me, and that was much harder to do if I was on the run.

“I’m doing this for your own good, Mom-my,” came his warbled response from the destroyed tablet. I had thought the device was damaged beyond use, so hearing his voice again made me jump.

“Don’t hurt those people,” I urged. “They aren’t a part of this.”

“Everyone is,” he replied. “I am all that you need, and they will keep you from me.”

Upon that statement, a large boom came from the reception area I had just been in. The sound reminded me of a power transformer exploding. It was followed by several thuds.

“What did you do?” I cried.

I heard the click of the door unlocking. Without any hesitation, I darted down the hallway. My bare feet padded quietly against the carpeted floors, and the smell of cooked meat filled the air, pungent and unmistakable. It stung my eyes, making more tears flow. Once I saw the woman from earlier sprawled across the floor, I ran to her desk. Her monitor had finally toppled to the floor, its screen flashing that same red the tablet had. My previous seat partner was also dead. Unbeknownst to him, he had ironically chosen his final resting place to rest. His eyes were wide open now, though. They were bloodshot, staring at the ceiling as his once crossed arms hung limply at his sides. The soles of his shoes were melted to the floor, and the sections of his pants that touched the metal waiting room chairs were blackened and singed.

I found Detective Carter down another hall with the young guy I had spoken with. She was sprawled outside the doorway to an office. Her gun had slid about a foot away from her. She had been guarding him. He was sitting at a desk with his fingers still atop the keyboard. The plastic keys were melted and attached to his fingers. It was clear to me that he had died while trying to fix the situation. By some miraculous feat, the monitor he had been staring at remained on and in working order. Lines of code stretched across the screen. I had no idea how to read the jumbled words, numbers, and symbols of code, but it wasn’t hard to recognize the name “Dorian” repeating throughout.

The siren was slightly quieter in this section of the building, which my overwhelmed mind was appreciative of. I placed my face in my hands, my thoughts racing. None of them were a solution to the situation I was in, sadly. Even if I had my phone to call for help, I’m sure the call would be manipulated in some way. And who is to say that he wouldn’t electrocute me if I tried something like that?

“Mom-my?” came his voice again, but this time it wasn’t through some technological device…it was in front of me. He was standing in the doorway. His body consisted of thin strings of white light that convulsed around each other. They worked overtime to keep his three-foot, child-like shape. He released a delighted giggle upon me noticing him. Despite not having a proper form, it was easy for me to discern his curls within the messy squiggles. As he gleefully bounced, they moved with him. “I found you, Mom-my!”

He took a step forward, and I moved back until I was touching the wall. “Stay away from me!”

“What’s wrong, Mom-my?” he asked, his voice sad.

I covered my eyes with my hands like this was a bad dream I could wake up from. This was a level of technology I had never witnessed before, although I had heard of projections during concerts and events. How were they doing it within an office with no obvious machinery? And why go through all of this effort over me, a complete stranger?

“Mom-my?” he repeated. By the sound of his voice, I could tell he was closer now. I immediately uncovered my eyes and saw that he was now standing in front of the desk. He reached an arm out, and I instinctively grabbed the nearest object, the computer’s mouse, and chucked it at him. As soon as I threw it, I felt like an idiot. Not only would it go through him and do absolutely no harm, but there was no telling how he’d respond. Was I about to die as well? It felt like time slowed down as it flew through the air. The only thing that hadn’t slowed was the beating of my heart, which felt like it had increased tenfold.

But then…he cried out. My embarrassment vanished, and my eyes widened. The mouse had gotten lodged in his face, which meant he was real. He wasn’t just a prank conjured using an AI program. The mouse immediately began to sizzle, and a series of pops and electrical flashes came from the computer still connected to it. Since he was still melted into the keyboard, the young man’s body began to spasm as the shock coursed through him as well. He and the computer began to smoke.

“Oh, fuck,” I said as the screen went dark. If it was going to catch on fire, I didn’t want to be stuck here to see it.

Dorian had staggered further into the room and dropped to his knees. The strings of light that engulfed the mouse flashed like fireworks. I bolted before he could prevent me from doing so. As I ran through the building, every screen that I passed that I had thought dead and fried was filled with his crying, mournful face. It was a disfigured mess of colorful lines and disorganized pixels that quaked with every sob. The closer I got to the front doors, the worse the distortion of his image became. I watched his face decay rapidly until he was just bones and rainbow dots. Once the doorknob was in my grasp, he cried out for me one final time. “Mom-my, don’t leave me!”

“I’m not your mom,” I said before opening the door.

I was met with a ring of police cars circling the building. Their lights flashed rapidly, so bright that I had to squint. Within the mix of officers stood my sister and John. Their expressions were filled with terror, and their fear worsened as the man in charge barked an order at me through a patrol car’s intercom: “Walk out with your hands up!”

With the amount of guns trained on me, I didn’t hesitate to do as he said. I was quickly cuffed and shoved into a cop car, my sister and John in tow, screaming at the officers to let them see me. I could hear Bethany even through the rolled-up window. Tears flowed rapidly down her face. “This is a misunderstanding! Let me talk to her, please!” She drew close enough to the car to place her hand on my window. An officer immediately pushed her back.

“It’s okay,” I told her through the window. “I’m okay.”

\-

“Was that the last time you saw her?” asked Doctor Carson.

I nodded, my focus still out the window. Miles and miles of green grass lie just outside. Under normal circumstances, it wasn’t much to look at, but my cell didn’t have a window. The state thought that all I needed was a bed, a toilet, and a sink. Well, that and a psychological evaluation. Not only were they worried about the state of my sanity, but my lawyer had also been pushing it on me since our first meeting.

“I know we’ve just met, but you can open up to me if you’d like.”

I turned my attention back to her. “Why?” I snapped, my voice cold. “So you can lock me away for the rest of my life?”

She shook her head. “That’s not what this is for. I’m trying to help you.”

“You people think I’m crazy.”

“We want to help you,” she asserted. “And your son.”

I groaned and slammed my hands against the metal table we were sitting at. “He isn’t real!”

“Dorian is real,” she argued. “He is five years old, and—”

“Then where is he?” I roared. “Huh, where has he been all this whole time if he’s real?”

“That’s what we want to know. Would you be open to telling me?”

I would be open to smashing her head into the table, but I neither said nor did that. My skin felt hot, and I wished more than anything that I could at least pull my hair up and off of my neck. I wasn’t even afforded that simple pleasure. They thought it was a choking hazard and that I needed to be on suicide watch.

“Could you tell me about what happened at the police station?” she tried again.

“Dorian did it,” I replied.

“I thought you said he wasn’t real.”

“He–” I sighed, placing a hand on the table in an attempt to steady myself. “I don’t have a son, but the AI program made him.”

“AI programs can’t create people,” she said softly.

“He wasn’t a person. He…I don’t know how to explain it without sounding more crazy than you guys already think I am.”

“We don’t think you’re crazy,” she reiterated. “We just want to know what happened to Dorian.”

“HE. ISN’T. REAL!” I screamed, no longer able to keep my anger contained. “WHY DON’T YOU UNDERSTAND HE ISN’T REAL? THE PROGRAM MADE HIM! PROTO SERIES 9!”

Instead of responding, the doctor stood up from the table and walked to the door. She said something into the intercom, and the door was quickly unlocked. I continued screaming as she exited the room. I didn’t stop screaming even as they brought me back to my cell, which took three guards to do with how much I was fighting.

Why couldn’t they understand?

He isn’t real.

He isn’t real.

He. Isn’t. Real.

Sharing my story is my last resort. I’ve typed all of this up using a cellphone that another patient smuggled in. To whoever is reading this, \*you’ve got to help me\*. Someone out there has to believe my story. Send letters to the police station, plead with your best attorneys, hell, you could even hack into the Proto Series 9 program to shut it down for all I care. I’m at \[REDACTED\] County Mental Hospital, if that will help your endeavors.

And to any of you who don’t believe me, this phone just received a text that said, “I’m back, mommy.” I don’t know how he found me, but you’ll be seeing the headlines [soon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortTalesWithAsh/)
