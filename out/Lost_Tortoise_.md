The events of this story have happened over the course of the past few days. I plan to keep it as log, updating it to keep record should anything happen to me.

My wife and I moved to a hot southern state for a number of reasons, one of them being to get the right climate for our pet sulcata tortoise to live outdoors. I got my Sulcata when I was just 18 years old. I raised him up from the size of an egg. He literally shipped to my house in a Tupperware container you would take soup Togo from a restaurant in. He did all the growing up with me into my 30s. Was a part of my wedding party... he was a big 60lb 18" wide tortoise living the dream in a house my wife and I picked out with a courtyard suited just for him.

Than one day I came home from work, the first thing I do is water my plants because we're in a drought currently. I notice that a bunch of them have been nibbled on, some eaten completely. Didn't really bother me, figured it was just the Deer and I like having deer nearby. There is a huge Abandoned golf course in the neighborhood with all kinds of critters.

So I move on to the backyard to water there and I have a few ongoing landscape projects that I had to work on. All before even setting foot in my house.

My wife comes home and storms into the backyard... "Where is our tortoise?"
That's when I realize it wasn't deer that ate those plants and I frantically rush into the courtyard.

The tortoise is gone and the wrought Iron gate. He used his strength to break the lower hinge off of the concrete so he could push himself under this massive heavy gate and snack on the tasty plants on the otherside. I knew they were strong, but not that strong...

We spend the entire evening driving around the neighborhood with the Led lights on my truck shined into everyone's yard to try and locate him. Probably looked like a UFO flying by to the neighbors inside, spotlights illuminating their whole house.

We then walked the neighborhood and I was able to see a path of grass laid down at the house across the street and in it found remnants of him nibbling on it as well as poop.

To annoy our neighbors more, we hung up flyers and signage the following day and stuff flyers in neighbors mail boxes.

That day a neighbor calls and they had actually taken videos and photos of our tortoise. Apparently a bunch of neighbors got together to photograph it thinking it was a native species (literally from Africa) my neighbor told me she let it wander off into the abandoned golf course because there are ponds their and turtles like to swim.

To make matters worse, this all happened a block over while I was watering my plants they were photographing my tortoise.

It's getting late already so my wife and I just walk the neighbor hood again planning to explore this golfcourse we never even knew we could access the next day.

And so we set out down an access path with our two dogs (husky Shepard collie mutts) hoping they'll smell their old friend.

The path runs between two houses and puts you right in the middle of people's backyards. I'd hate to live there, who knows, anybody can show up in your backyard.

Of course their are people sitting out in their backyards too as we begin to snoop around... the path leads on to the golf course but I walk the edge of these people's yards first, apologizing and explaining our situation to hopefully recruit a few extra eyes.

We run into this young couple with some kids playing out on the trampoline, at first the husband/dad is confrontational, which shouldn't be unexpected as we just showed up in his yard with our two dogs.

I explain the situation and his demeanor dose change, but then he tells us to be careful of the homeless man in the park. He says the previous day a homeless man tried to fight him but he just left and called the cops because he was out walking with his kids. He notes he would've fought him if his wife and kids weren't with him.

He's trying to scare us off from walking around his yard and I tell him, "the more we all walk around this park the less likely homeless people will want to stick around."

Crossing into the main part of the golfcourse you go over this bridge and a wooded creek and come out to the big fairway that's just grown out into a grassy meadow with sporadic live oak trees. A concrete path loops up ahead of the creek and then loops back down to the tree line to cross another bridge into the next section which is right where the neighbors house is that the tortoise was seen at last.

Up into the fairway is some picnic benches and there is a man dressed in black shorts walking over to one, he's probably 5'9 and wearing a backpack.

My wife and I our walking the dogs up the path which inevitably loops over that direction to the picnic tables. Scanning the area for any signs of the tortoise.

I start to hear this noise, like a very loud bird, it's such a strong sound that it shakes you.

My wife is like, "Omg, I think that's the homeless man they were talking about"

"Who?" I ask

The only other person around is the guy in the black shorts with the bag.

I tell her there is just no way...

Looking over to the man is about 500yds away. I can make out he's got long shaggy hair, and he's at the picnic bench. He is violently pacing around the bench like an animal guarding it's turf. He'll stop pacing for a second and just stop to make this God awful noise.

It was not volcalization you would hear coming out of a humans throat. It was like a bark, it sounded like they were coughing out the word "Hate." 

It was loud, like he held an invisible megaphone to amplify it. The sound literally shook you.

I tell my wife let's just try to talk to him, if he lives out here we'll see if he has seen our turtle.

She doesn't like the idea of this and as we draw nearer, he continues to aggressively pace around the picnic bench but then stops and looks directly at us muttering that awful sound. We then realize he's been talking to himself the whole time he paces about. We can make out the words murder and Fuck, hoping he's just babbling on to himself and not talking about us.

I grew up in a family with a rule never to call the cops, my granfather who was a cop taught us this, bring cops into your life causes problems... Despite this I immediately pull out my phone and call 911. Apologizing to the operator for the nonurgent call, but that my wife and I feel in danger and our concerned about the other families that use this park. this homeless man seems to be mentally ill and is behaving very aggressively. He presents harm to others and himself. The operator says she'll get an officer out and to call back immediately if their is a problem with the homeless man.

My wife and I cut across the field to the other bridge. Through some tall grass, rather than have to pass him on the walking path. We Ignore the yelling and noise this mentally unstable person is making, not acknowledging their presence whatsoever.

This next area we search really heavy. This is only within a few yard of where he was seen last. We find deer poop, racoon poop, a massive watersnake quite literally 8' long and as thick as a big man's arm. Oddly bones everywhere, figure from a coyote getting a stray cat or deer. We see some deer. No signs of a tortoise however other than some digging that could've been a rabbit or squirrel.

My wife and I begin to head back and she is very stressed about this homeless man. I tell her that tomorrow I will bring a gun and a flyer and hand him the flyer, offer him $500 to find the tortoise. I joke that a junkie will have every stone turned over in the park and the tortoise found in a day to get that money.

We cross the bridge, and the homeless man is just sitting on the picnic bench keeping to themself. My wife comments how the cops never came and then I look up and point out to her a cop sitting at the road ahead at the very far end of the course. He almost immediately pulls off as I point in his direction.

"See they're not going to do shit" she says

"Hold on a second"

"I think he's pulling into that other neighborhood access over there to get the jump on him."

We hang tight for a a couple minutes....

Now I will note, I am not one to carry gun, I am tall, very strong, very muscular, and know how to fight. There are very few men or animals on this planet that can over power me, at least I'd like to think. Also, for most of my life I've been able to talk my way out of just about anything, I learned well staying out of trouble in the public school system growing up avoiding fights and detention. 

I will only carry if I feel my life is threatened and especially if my wife or dogs are in danger. Yet even in then... I have glocks, HKs, CZs, FN, Sigs.... more pistols than I own shoes. Heavily modified and tricked out with high lumen lights and red dot sights. I do competitive shooting as a hobby. Despite all of this, I brought with me a snub nose 38 special revolver that only has 5 shots and fits in my pocket.

So this next day we just brought one dog, figured the other dog was being a distraction preventing one from picking up the scent. We pretty much let the dog take us wherever it's nose lead. It lead us to some more deer, we did find more bones. no sign of the tortoise though. As we head back we run into the same young couple with their kids and theyve got this big mean looking bully dog... they were the ones that warned us about the vagrant. I told them about the encounter we had yesterday and how we called the cops we basically came to the same consensus to keep calling the police if we see him. Eventually they might do their job. 

https://imgur.com/a/XyBuR5i

They were actually out with their kids looking around the ponds for our lost "turtle," it was cute the kids kept saying turtle, they were young maybe 5 and then the other 6 or 7 years old.

We were in and out the next few days until finally I decided I would try to bring my thermal scope out. Yes tortoise are cold blooded reptiles; but sitting out in the sun all day should give them enough thermal energy to show up on the infrared. 

We go without the dogs this time, and I figured it out, that apparently if you ever want to outrun the thermal on a police helicopter... do it on a +100 degree day in the south. They literally won't be able to find you in an open field.

I couldn't even see my wife in the thermal, the grass and the trees, the concrete path had absorbed so much infrared radiation from the sun that they were glowing a brighter white than a person's body. The device was practically unusable.
That is... until I got underneath the canopy in the wooded creek and found a frog. Among the bright white grass the frog was a perfectly black specimen hopping about. This left me with two options. Hope the tortoise is a big black boulder stumbling about in the white grass, or go out after sundown and hope the tortoise is still hot from basking in the day.

The next day my wife and I go out with both dogs, we head behind the houses he was spotted near last. We hear this hammer clicking like someone is setting up tent post. I follow the noise and find this old bald dude, he looks rough and I assume is homeless, not the same guy from before, but his ragged appearance makes it look like he has been out here sometime.... and he is just beating at rocks in the ground around a small mountain laurel with a hammer... I approach the man while holding the gun in my pocket, I have my wife sit back with the dogs. Then I try to approach in the least confrontational way, "Excuse me sir, are you out here often."

He has a deep southern drawl and explains to me yes he is.

I ask him if he's seen a tortoise. Figuring he probably doesn't have a phone I ask him to contact the police if he sees it or turn it in to one of the neighbors.

He replies that he will talk to his boss and points over to the house the tortoise was seen at last.

There a woman is standing in the backyard and she waves to us.

The man goes back to wittling at the rocks with his little hammer.

"Hey you both so sorry about your turtle."
This unknown woman approaches us like she's known us for a few years.

Apparently all of the neighbors here are old ladies and the gossip at tea time amongst eachother. I guess my wife had spoken with this woman for an hour on the phone.

She tells us the same story we've heard, thought it was native, and that she'll keep an eye on the pond for him. She explains the man we had spoken too is a handyman and he's doing a project for her out in the old golfcourse.

As she's telling us this her daughter out of nowhere comes running at us with this big year old pup dragging her on a straight track to our two dots.

Our dogs have a pack mentality and they go absolutely nuts. We don't even get an opportunity to finish the conversation with the neighbor. The dogs are barking and going nuts.

The girl was probably 16-17, rookie dog owner mistake. we see her later that day hiking around with her dog looking for our tortoise. All round nice people. It was concerning to me though that this girl was out here alone with this potentially dangerous homeless man possibly lurking around.

The heat really takes it out of you, we're exhausted, drenched in sweat so I head back with my wife, we drive around the neighborhood and I scan people's yards with the thermal, saw a few stray cats but nothing out of the ordinary.  No tortoise.

The next day I head out on my own this time with my little 38 revolver, a bottled water, thermal, and a flashlight. The sun begins to set as I enter the park. I look over and see the young couple playing in the backyard with their two kids. 

Today I hear dirt bikes/ four wheelers whipping around in the distance. I can't help but think how bad it would be to run into the homeless man in the dark that night.

I make it out into the clearing and see that there is a guy on a dirt bike just hammering it back and fourth. Leaving ruts all over this lawless place. A young couple carrying a baby and walking a dog passes by and greets me on their way out.
There is a man with fishing rods hiking into the park. The picnic tables are all empty fortunately.

I hike across the second bridge and begin scanning my surroundings with the thermal.

As I'm walking I come across the kid on a dirtbike and his group of friends on quads. I approach them to ask if they've seen my tortoise and as soon as they spot me they book it out of the park. Girl riding on the back of one of the bikes screaming as the driver jumps the hills in the park.

I get pretty deep into the course and the sun is beginning to set. I'm scanning these wooded areas and I think I see the tortoise only to find out it's a rock, still 100 degrees F from earlier in the day. 

I see some deer pass by and then jump as I hear the jingle of a dogs collar right behind me. This woman in her late 20s early 30s came up on me out of nowhere.

I awkwardly say hello as I stand their drenched in sweaty clothes with a fanny pack, cowboy hat, and $6000 thermal imaging device in my hands, I also did not have my wedding ring on due to the swelling being out in the heat like that causes.

It wasn't quite dark yet and I wanted to ask if she saw my tortoise but didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable as Im sure she was just running into this strange man alone in the woods.

I did the natural thing and pulled my phone out to pretend I was doing something on it and totally not looking around people's backyards with a thermal imaging device.

I walk off in a random direction texting my wife about how this woman is probably going to go on reddit and write about a human trafficker she ran into out in the woods.

The sun set now and the thermal is amazing, I can see all these birds in the trees. A herd of deer grazing about, I'm able to scan this brush and see right through it.

https://imgur.com/a/OyW1rD6

Of course there is that impeding thought, what if I scan the bush and there is a humanoid figure just standing in them staring at me.

And I just get this feeling that I am being watched. I truly hope I don't see someone in those bushes.

This is the kind of stuff I fear, not the pumas, rattlesnakes, gators, scorpions, rabid stray dogs, etc...

https://imgur.com/a/Q6wafK9

I continue to scan around with the thermal, and I see something smaller moving around in the thicket? Could this be him? 

It was a rabbit, and as he made his way along a whole group made their way out of the bushes.

I cross the bridge into the large stretch of fairway, scanning the brush along the edge of the creek.

https://imgur.com/a/pkNOFcC

Is that a person? I quickly turn back to this humanoid figure. I zoom in... a backpack... my stomach drops... the person waves their hands above their head as if to throw something forward. I ponder what this might be. After a few minutes or so of observing this strange person they shine a light off in my direction.

I realize that their not some serial killer and I'm actually the creep standing on top of a hill in the dark spying on this person fishing.

The next night I head out late. It's already dark out, my wife is in bed already. It's 10pm on a worknight. I have a backpack with me, a bottled water. A knife. My 38spc. And a pvs14 nightvision device with a helmet to mount it too, as well as my thermal scope.

I walk down the street to the entrance of the course between the two houses, rather ominously the house light at the entrance is flickering on and off, the other neighboring himself dark. Creating this strobe effect as I enter the course.

The house nextstoor smells like a cigarette, the lights are on in back by the pool but the owner must've just finished their smoke and went back inside, patio was empty.

I look around the course. I really didn't even need night vision. The moon lit things up so well that I could see quite far around me.

I hike across the bridge and stop at the otherside in a nice clear spot illuminated by the moon on the pathway.  Opening up my bag to set up my nightvision helmet and put it on.

I turn it on and look around. This was great, it was almost as clear as day out, didn't even need the IR illuminator with how bright the moon was I could see very far out and things were very clear.

I scan a bit from where I'm standing but really don't hesitate to pull my thermal out.

I decide I'm going to hold it up to the other eye and cross reference both the thermal and nightvision so they can almost impose on one another in my brain.

I try walking around but my depth perception is totally screwed doing this, and being in knee high grass with snakes I decide to just stick with the nightvision for moving and use the thermal for scanning.

Moving around I do see some deer across the way on the move.

https://imgur.com/a/jMltaqi

I then come across something unusual. 
Something is sort of hanging around funny on this live oak tree up ahead.

Looks like a worm wriggling about.

I zoom in on it, strange object just sort of flailing around. I then start to meander my way around it to get a better angle.

It was not something in the tree. It was in the middle of this dark field, and as I zoomed in more I made out what it was. It appeared to be a man pacing back and fourth in the dark flailing his hands in the air wildly, best way to describe it is like one of those whacky wavey inflatable arms things they put up at car dealerships. Rapid, all over the place, and discontorted. The human anatomy doesn't allow arms to bend like that.

There was no way I said, my mind was screwing with me. I was thinking there would be a person out here and I manifested it.

I looked away and looked back again, doing a double take I couldn't find anything, scanning about until I was right at the spot again, and the thermal has this green tracker that let's you know when you're over something hot again it targets it for you.

And there it was again, it was a man alone in the middle of a dark field pacing back and fourth flailing his arms around violently in the air like they're tentacles. Not a sound from that direction, just in the darkness in silence.

I'm watching him for a few moments and then all of a sudden he stops moving. And just stands there, I can't tell which direction he is facing, but I get this unnerving feeling he can see me.

I put my thermal down and closed that eye to see if I could get a better look with the nightvision. Darkness, he was just out of the field of vision. I couldn't see past the tree he was behind. I lift the nightvision piece up to get a look with my naked eye... because if he can't see me I can't see him right?

Darkness, can't see anything past the tree. Everything around me though seems to be lit up in the moonlight. I look down at the bright white fishing shirt I am wearing. Why did I wear that? 

Slowly I began to circle off to put myself out of the clearing backing up towards the creek in the shadows of the treeline.

I look up through the thermal in the same location. He is gone... so I scan off to the right, it looks like there sre some hogs or dogs or coyotes off in the distance, I continue to scan. And he is right there...He'd closed about half of the distance from the center of the field towards me now. Now only about 50yds away, right up by the big live oak tree.

I couldn't tell what he was doing now, he was just there in the dark by himself, it looked like he was bent down scratching his legs frantically, like their were bugs under his skin.

I took my helmet off and backed my way across the bridge watching him through the thermal. From there I turned speedwalking out of the golfcourse. But in such a manner, I did so quietly, not to be sneaky, but so I can hear if footsteps were chasing after me.

As soon as I hit the street that speed walk turned into a jog home. I didn't even put my helmet and nightvision away in the bag awkwardly carrying it past some neighbors walking their dogs not saying a word.

I have to find my tortoise. I'm going to go out there again tonight. This time with something bigger than a 5 shot snubnose 38spc. I don't know if it was the homeless man or someone else. Whatever it was, I hope I don't ever run into it out their at night again and if I do cross paths with it again I hope I'm left alone.
