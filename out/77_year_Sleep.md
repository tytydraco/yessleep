Mr. Worthicket

Hello to all humans.

I want to be very direct in our approach and forthcoming with information. We will start by stating for your records that we are not human and we are not from Earth.

My name is Mr. Worthicket but you may address me as Mr. W. We're sure that by the end of this, you will have many questions, but I am afraid that I won't be able to respond to you yet. By the time these educational, technological and medical files reach your planet, it will only be 23 years until the first aliens arrive.

We have sent documents for new technology to every world's government, social media and news platforms. We are asking humanity to embrace our gifts and accept most of all the gift of AI.

We have aided you with this technological advancement, hoping you will integrate AI into the infrastructure of your world. It's the only chance the human species has to survive.

Although we need to explain some history for context, this isn't the message we need to convey and won't be explaining as much as you all would like to know. For humans, our technology is far beyond the scope you're able to understand. You may understand a concept explained throughout this document because that's the way we've designed it. The ability to achieve the technological achievements spoken about later is far past people's reach.

Let us start 2.23 billion years ago. The first star-travelling race set out into the vastness of space. There is no dialect or way to speak their name, so from now on they will be referred to as Zabelians or Zabs. Zabs were forced into the stars in search of a new home. They were trying to outrun a worldwide extinction event. After many collective attempts, it was more successful for every individual to make their own space-dwelling craft (usually no larger than a small boat) and everyone set out in teams of two, hoping to find a new home. In the end, 1.8 Trillion vessels would embark on a journey of survival. Only one craft would ever land on a habitable planet.

Zabs would meet the local habitants and provide aid during a time of disease and famine. Over 800 million years, the next star-soring species would enter the cosmos in search of answers to the universe. 200 million years after that, we signed an intergalactic treaty with 8 of 11 star-bound races vowing to uphold interstellar peace and stability. Sadly, 3 races believe that the only way to survive is to conquer. To locate life and extinguish its existence. Adapting any technology they come across has led these 3 species into a war that lasted nearly fifty thousand years, where only 1 would reign supreme, Zabs. They are a mix of the original bloodline and that of the locals they bread with, but they all refer to themselves still as Zabs. After the extinction of the other two races, they attacked the 8 remaining treaty members and thus started the comic war for the milky way galaxy. The war has been going on for millions of years. Hundreds of planets with life are gone. Entire civilizations never to be spoken about again. It's a battle and we're all losing it more quickly now than ever. Even humankind notices the emptiness of space and wonders where all the life could be. If you would have looked 100 million years ago, you would have seen so much more. Now life is hardly found in the universe and is sought after by what we can best use in English as The Horde.

Humanity has been undiscovered until recently. A probe had been sent out a long time ago and has recently returned with data and a sample (a person in cryogenic hibernation) Mr. W.

At first, you seemed like most class V races. We voted to never have contact with your kind. Humans were on a path of self-destruction with zero chance of surviving. You would never reach the stars and thus be deemed Class V.

Micro Space Bends are how we travel. We don't move extremely fast, but bend space and light to move vast distances in what seems like an instant. The war right now makes any space bend difficult and dangerous. With that being said, every star-bound race is now making its way toward you because of a discovery.

The Intergalactic treaty holders all have a unique technology that has kept us a "step ahead" of our enemy. We have the ability to see the past and the future. You must understand something very important. Viewing the future doesn't make one able to change its outcome, and viewing the past is very specific. You must know where and when exactly and what it is you're looking for. Put simply, what has happened must happen and will happen has always happened. You may think that since you've seen the future, you can change the outcome. Viewing the future changes it, but not in an interactive way. Your viewing of the future changes it, but the viewing you see is that of the change you've already made since viewing it. There are beneficial ways to still use this information, but that's classified and is actively being used in the war.

No matter what we've tried, even with our collectively vast intellect and technology, we cannot manipulate time. "What will happen must happen, and what must happen has always happened."

Except for Humans.

With our current observations, we've concluded that it's the human brain. People are a wonder of the universe. Humans, when given proper training, medication, and stimuli in the proper combination, can yield unimaginable results. Mr. W. has been on record as being able to: Dimensional Self Project - Tethering - Stream Splitting - Astrometric Augmentation - Spirit Morphing - AI mind Programming and so much more! Humanity is the anomaly to the wonders of the universe that has stopped every new advancement for the past one hundred million years. We can now answer the questions the lords of the stars spoke about.

Mr. W. originally was unimportant and was kept on an isolated moon for testing/observation. It was quickly we noticed small things, but it wasn't until we lost all communication with the research facility that we began to really pay attention. On arrival, the team that entered found the staff in a dormant-like state. Some were holding items in their hands, some were in the middle of logging events. Everything seemed to stand still. The team entering had on special suits that recorded some interesting readings. When they returned. A mental "tone" and a mental "color" were recorded. These are by far not the right depiction or description, but it's the closest we can determine with your language. This mental phenomenon is called Bleaking.

Bleaking renders the surrounding species motionless in a hypnotized state unable able to act or respond to outside stimuli. When the facility shut down and life support to the human stopped, it regained consciousness. As the subject awoke, so did the staff. Some staff had passed away from the event and we logged their biological information on the galactic record. There was something special about this moment. Each one of the 8 remaining species was present, and it affected everyone to the same degree. A turning point for hope emerged. You may not understand yet, but you will soon.

We held a meeting of Justice to determine how to proceed with these findings. Something called the Silent Sacrifice took place. Eight members entered the great hall, but only one would come out. Having this information held within each great member of each great society held too much risk. 7 members gave their lives tasking the one that found the Humans to carry out the greatest mission of all time. Saving Humanity and stopping the horde for good.

The horde attacked our outpost, currently holding all related information on humanity and now has knowledge of your existence. They have a war clan much closer and it's coming towards you. The Horde will arrive approximately 77 years before anyone could defend you. They will create a singularity at the edge of your moon and consume your galaxy. This will happen in year 77, moments before we arrive. For 75 years, they will experiment on people in unfathomable ways! but we can save it all.

Humankind needs to do the most simple of things. Sleep. Each person, when sleeping, emits their own code. A wave of light and responses that affects the rest of the universe. This puts us to sleep in a state waiting to be altered by you, the person. While in proximity to you, we await "instructions"

In rotation to your sun, not enough people are sleeping to bleak the armada that will arrive, but if everyone was sleeping, then you would eliminate the enemy and allow time for us to arrive and assist you.

All of humanity will need to sleep for 77 years, an entire generation. A scary thought, but It's possible with an automated world run by AI.

I wish I had more time to tell you. To show you more and explore with you. To teach you... Don't allow your story... our story to be overlooked.

Please help us. Please help you. Please listen. Please hear me. Please understand. Please have grace. Please let this message be known. Please don't hide this. Please Speak This. please post this. please see this. please remember this. please fear this. please be this.

Please... Please... Please... Allow us to save you.
