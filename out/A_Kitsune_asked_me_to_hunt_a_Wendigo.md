Hey everyone, it’s Glenn Matsuri again—

I’ve been on a break. A real break this time. After everything with Naamah—and then Moloch again—I promised myself I’d live life on my own terms for a while.

I never wrote about when I went back for Moloch, though it felt like I should. Maybe that’s because it didn’t feel like much of a story. Not compared to Naamah, or the Piper. Moloch was… easier. Too easy.

Six months after I sealed Naamah, I started thinking about that statue. The cult’s idol, the massive figure I saw in that warehouse when all this started. I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was unfinished. It haunted me like a splinter just under the skin—something I couldn’t ignore.

So I went back.

The warehouse was the same. Abandoned, silent, and stagnant, as though time had stopped there. I don’t know what I expected—some cultists waiting in the dark, maybe, or some fight for my soul—but all I found was dust and decay.

And there it was.

The idol.

It sat in the center of the room on its crumbling altar, still grotesque and imposing even in the faint light filtering through broken windows. Moloch’s form was carved into rough, ancient stone, half-man, half-bull. His massive shoulders hunched forward as though bearing the weight of his own cruelty. His head—a bull’s head with hollow, gaping eyes and curled horns—stared forward, unseeing but aware.

It didn’t feel dormant. Not really. It felt like something was watching me through those empty sockets, waiting.

I wasn’t sure what I was doing at first. I brought Naamah’s piece—the obsidian Queen—because instinct told me to. The pieces… I don’t know, they teach you things, in a way that’s hard to explain.

I approached the idol, the silence thick around me, and I placed the Queen at its feet.

At first, nothing happened. But as I focused—on the idol, on Moloch himself—I felt it. The air shifted, the room vibrating with an almost imperceptible hum. It was like the stone statue breathed, just once, before going still again.

Then, a crack.

A hairline fracture split across the idol’s chest, spreading with a sharp, audible pop. And I felt something pull.

I don’t know if Moloch resisted. Maybe he never saw me coming, or maybe he didn’t care. But I knew what was happening as the obsidian King took shape in my hand. It was cold—colder than the Queen had ever been—and its sharp edges pressed into my skin like it was warning me not to hold it for too long.

The hum faded. The room went still.

I looked up, and the idol was empty. Hollow.

Just like that, Moloch was bound.

I walked out of that warehouse with the King in my pocket, feeling like I’d gotten away with something. I expected blowback. You don’t just waltz in and snare a demon that’s been feared for millennia. But nothing happened. Days passed, then weeks, then months. Now, it’s been three years.

The King sits beside the Queen on my shelf. Two obsidian pieces, small and silent, but heavy in ways I don’t think I’ll ever fully understand.

In those three years, I bought a house. An actual house this time, not some cramped apartment. Avery, my girlfriend, moved in about a year ago, and life finally started to feel like it was mine again.

Sometimes she asks me about the pieces. About the Piper, Naamah, or if I ever think there’s more out there. “You should take me with you next time,” she’ll say, half-joking but not really joking at all. I’m not sure she truly believes me, despite her claiming to. 

For a long time, I laughed her off. I told her I was on a break. I told myself I was done chasing things that were better left unseen.

But lately, things have started to feel… wrong.

Little things. Scratching sounds outside the house at night. Lights flickering in rooms no one’s been in. A smell—sharp, faint, like woodsmoke mixed with something sweeter, like flowers or incense.

Two nights ago, I woke up to a shadow moving outside the window. It wasn’t human—its movements were too fluid, too unnatural. I sat up, but by the time I looked, it was gone.

I know something’s coming.

And for the first time in years, I don’t think I’m going to be able to laugh Avery off.

The first time I sensed it, I was alone in the house. Avery was out visiting her sister for the weekend, and for the first time in years, the silence felt… off.

It started with the sound.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

It was faint at first, like claws against glass. I froze mid-typing in my office, fingers hovering over the keyboard. The tap-tap-tapping came again, deliberate and slow, from the direction of the living room window.

I turned my head toward the sound. It stopped.

The lights were still on, but suddenly, the house felt darker. Thicker. I stood up slowly and made my way toward the living room. The tapping didn’t return, but my pulse thundered in my ears. I flipped on the light switch, and the room lit up in an empty, quiet stillness.

Nothing.

I sighed, running a hand through my hair. You’re hearing things. I turned toward the kitchen—

Tap.

The sound came from the floor. Right behind me.

I whipped around, heart lurching, and there it was.

A fox.

It was small—no larger than a housecat—but it stood upright on its hind legs like it was perfectly natural. Its fur was snow-white, soft and clean, and behind it were tails—nine of them—fanning out in slow, lazy motions like drifting silk. It stood there on two legs, its tiny paws folded behind its back as it stared up at me with glowing amber eyes.

I didn’t move.

It blinked at me, cocking its head to one side like it was studying me. Then it grinned.

“Hi!” it said cheerfully.

I nearly tripped over the coffee table. “What the—!”

“Wow, rude.” The fox’s voice was light and sing-song, like it was scolding me for knocking over a vase. “You’d think after everything you’ve seen, a talking fox wouldn’t be such a shock.”

I stared at it. It stared back, ears twitching.

“What… are you?” I managed, my voice shaking slightly.

It took a dainty step forward on two legs, still unnervingly small and fox-like. “I’m Kitsune, of course! You’re Glenn Matsuri, right? I’ve been looking for you.”

I took a step back. “You’ve what?”

The little creature nodded, its tails swishing. “Oh yes, you’ve made a bit of a reputation for yourself. Naamah? Moloch? That’s some big business to get tangled up in. And now here you are, living in this nice little house with your girlfriend, playing normal.”

The fox said it casually, like it knew everything about me. My grip tightened on the doorframe. “I don’t know what you want, but I’m not interested. I didn’t ask for any of that.”

Kitsune let out a dramatic sigh and sat back on its haunches, still upright. It shook its tiny head, as though I’d just said something laughably stupid. “You don’t get to poke around the unknown, Glenn, and then get mad when the unknown pokes back at you.”

“That’s not how this works—”

“That’s exactly how this works,” it interrupted brightly. “And lucky for you, I’m not here to haunt you. I’m here because I need your help.”

I stared at it. “Help?”

The fox’s grin widened, and it took another slow step forward. “Word gets around, Glenn. The demons you’ve dealt with? Bound up nice and neat? I hear you’re pretty good at it.”

I frowned. “I’m not good at it. I just—”

“—survived it? Yeah, yeah, that’s what they all say.” Kitsune waved a paw dismissively. “Look, you’ve got a gift, okay? And I’ve got a problem.”

“What kind of problem?”

“Well, I’d love to tell you, but first…” Kitsune sniffed the air and tilted its head, the amber glow in its eyes brightening. “Do you have tea? Or snacks? I’m starving.”

I blinked at it, my jaw slack. “Snacks?”

“Yes, snacks,” it repeated cheerfully. “I’ve been traveling a long way to find you, and I’m absolutely famished. It’s the least you can offer before I explain why your perfectly normal life is about to get less normal.”

The absurdity of the moment finally hit me, and I couldn’t help it. I laughed—sharp, dry, and disbelieving. “No. No way. You’re joking.”

Kitsune just tilted its head again, expression perfectly serious despite the playfulness in its tone. “Do I look like I’m joking?”

I couldn’t deny it: despite the glowing eyes, the multiple tails, and the fact that it had broken into my house, it was… oddly cute. Like a stuffed animal someone had animated with pure sass and unsettling wisdom.

I sighed and rubbed a hand over my face. “Fine. You can have tea. But you’re explaining everything.”

The fox’s ears perked up, and its tails swished excitedly. “Deal!”

It trotted past me on two legs like it owned the place, heading straight for the kitchen. I followed behind, still trying to wrap my head around what was happening.

As I put the kettle on, I glanced back at Kitsune, who had perched itself on the counter. It looked at me, its grin returning.

“Oh, Glenn,” it teased softly, “you’re really going to regret being so hospitable.”

I muttered under my breath, “I already do.”

But deep down, I knew: whatever this was, it wasn’t leaving anytime soon.

I made tea for the Kitsune. It was ridiculous, all of it—boiling water, steeping leaves, and pouring a cup for a magical talking fox with nine tails sitting on my kitchen counter like it belonged there.

“Is chamomile okay?” I asked, setting the cup down in front of her. “It’s all I’ve got.”

The fox’s tails swished lazily as she leaned forward, inhaling the steam with a pleased sigh. “Chamomile’s perfect. You’re a good host, Glenn. It’s no wonder she lets you wield her power.”

That caught me off guard. I blinked. “She?”

Kitsune waved a paw, dismissing the question. “Never mind, we’ll get there.”

As I leaned against the counter, watching the little fox sip tea—still upright on two legs—I couldn’t help but remark, “You know, Henry had fox butlers in his manor back in Naamah’s world. They wore tuxedos and everything. You wouldn’t happen to be related, would you?”

The Kitsune perked her ears up, tilting her head with mock seriousness. “Oh, absolutely. Distant cousins. Long family line of excellent service.”

“Really?” I asked, surprised despite myself.

The fox’s expression went deadpan, her bright orange eyes staring flatly into mine. “No. Not really.”

I felt my face flush. “Right.”

She snickered into her tea, clearly pleased with herself, then set the cup down delicately. “Alright, enough tea and chit-chat. Let’s talk business.”

“Business,” I echoed. “Sure, let’s hear it.”

She hopped down from the counter, tails trailing behind her as she paced the kitchen floor like a professor delivering a lecture. “There’s a Wendigo up in the mountains, Glenn. It’s a nasty piece of work, and it’s causing all sorts of trouble. People disappearing, settlements going quiet, that sort of thing. I want it gone. Sealed away. And you’re going to help me.”

I frowned, still trying to process the words. “Hold on—a Wendigo? Why are you asking me for help? You’re, you know…” I gestured at her tails, her glowing eyes. “…a Kitsune. Aren’t you powerful enough to deal with it yourself?”

She stopped pacing and gave me a look—one that made me feel like I’d just asked if water was wet. “Powerful? Sure. But this isn’t just some random Wendigo. This one’s personal.”

“Personal?”

Her tails stilled, her gaze flickering for just a moment before returning to that same mischievous glint. “We Kitsune don’t like Wendigos. It’s… complicated lore stuff. Let’s just say Wendigos exist because of imbalance, desperation, and corruption—all things I hate. Plus, this one’s been targeting people under my protection.”

I crossed my arms. “So what’s stopping you from handling it on your own?”

“Because I don’t seal things, Glenn.” She pointed a paw at me. “You do.”

The room went quiet for a moment as her words sank in. “What do you mean, I do?”

Kitsune sighed, like I was being slow. “You sealed Naamah. You sealed Moloch. And you didn’t get yourself infected with demonic rot doing it, either. Which means you’re special. Or dumb. Or both.”

“I didn’t ask for any of that,” I muttered.

“Well, congratulations, you’ve got a gift. And she lets you use it,” Kitsune said, hopping back onto the counter.

“She?” I repeated again.

“Naamah,” she said, grinning with all her teeth. “You’re using her power, whether you like it or not.”

My blood went cold. “That’s not possible.”

“Oh, but it is,” Kitsune chirped, sipping her tea again. “Not directly, mind you. Probably passive. Involuntary. She’s a chess piece now, remember? Bound up tight. You’ve got the leash, so you’ve got the power.”

I looked toward my office, where the Queen and King pieces sat. “Why would she let me do that?”

Kitsune’s grin widened. “Who says she’s letting you? She’s a demon in a box, Glenn. She doesn’t have much say in the matter.”

The room fell silent again as I stared at her.

“Don’t look so freaked out,” she said, waving a paw dismissively. “If you had demonic rot, we wouldn’t be having this conversation. You’re clean. Well…” She squinted at me, her tails flicking thoughtfully. “…mostly clean. Your soul’s already claimed, anyway.”

I tensed. “By who?”

Her eyes gleamed, and she leaned closer, her grin positively smug. “The Piper, of course.”

The room felt colder. I swallowed hard.

“That’s not funny,” I said.

“It’s not a joke.” She shrugged. “Anyway, back to the matter at hand.”

“You’re telling me I’ve been pulling off this… sealing thing with Naamah’s power?”

“Yep. Handy, huh?” Kitsune set her empty cup down and hopped onto the table, tails twitching. “Look, here’s the deal: this Wendigo is causing chaos, and I want it snared. I can’t seal it. You can. So let’s team up, and we’ll solve both our problems.”

“Why do you care so much about this particular Wendigo?” I asked, narrowing my eyes.

Her expression faltered for just a second—so quick I almost missed it. “Let’s just say Wendigos… offend me. Everything about them—their hunger, their corruption—it’s like watching a sickness that spreads and never stops. They’re unnatural. An imbalance in the world. This one is worse than most. I can’t just let it run wild.”

Her voice was still playful, but something sharper hid beneath the surface.

I stared at her for a long moment, trying to gauge just how much of the truth she was telling me. “And if I say no?”

Kitsune tilted her head, her grin returning. “You’re welcome to say no. But we both know you won’t. This is what you do, Glenn. You see something wrong, and you fix it—whether you like it or not.”

She hopped down from the table, landing on her hind legs with an unsettling little bounce. “So what do you say, partner? Ready to bag yourself a Wendigo?”

I sighed, pinching the bridge of my nose. “You’re going to make this miserable for me, aren’t you?”

Her tails swished, and she beamed. “Absolutely.”

Somehow, I already knew I wasn’t getting out of this.

“What if I say no?” I asked again, my voice sharper than I meant it to be.

The room shifted.

The Kitsune, up until now lighthearted and joking, froze mid-step. Her tails went still. The playful glow in her amber eyes dimmed, and her grin flattened into something unnervingly neutral. It was like watching a flame suddenly snuffed out, leaving only smoke and silence.

“Least you forget, Glenn,” she said softly, her voice low and deliberate, “I’m capable of haunting too.”

Her form began to change.

The fur along her small, fox-like body rippled unnaturally, as though something larger—something wrong—was trying to force its way to the surface. Her limbs stretched and twitched, thin and too long, her silhouette suddenly looming larger in the dim kitchen light. Her tails snapped and curled like serpents, their movements erratic. Her face stayed fox-like, but her features sharpened, the mouth opening impossibly wide, filled with teeth that seemed to layer over one another, grinning far too much.

The light overhead flickered. Shadows stretched across the walls, flickering like frantic, clawed shapes.

I took a step back, my stomach knotting.

“Least you forget,” she repeated, her voice layered now—something sweet and sing-song undercut by something deeper, darker, ancient. “I’m not just here to play games. Not when there are other options.”

I couldn’t move. Her glowing amber eyes bored into me like twin embers, unblinking, unrelenting.

Then, in an instant, she snapped back to normal.

The fox was small again, perched upright on her hind legs, ears twitching innocently. Her tails swished behind her in a smooth, carefree rhythm. Her grin returned—bright, cheerful, and almost irritatingly cute.

“Call it a carrot-and-stick situation!” she chirped, the sing-song tone back in full force. “And right now, Glenn, I’m offering the carrot!”

I stared at her, my heart still pounding in my chest. I didn’t even realize I’d been holding my breath until I exhaled shakily.

“Alright,” I muttered, wiping a hand over my face. “Okay. Fine. I’ll help you. But I need to get ready first. I can’t just disappear for God-knows-how-long—I have a job. A life. I need to make arrangements.”

Kitsune tilted her head, watching me with amusement, like she found the idea of my normal responsibilities quaint. “That’s fine. Do what you need to do.”

I exhaled slowly in relief. “Good. Just… give me a few days.”

“Three days,” she said immediately.

I looked at her sharply. “Three?”

Her grin widened. “That’s all the time you’re getting, Glenn. I’ll be back in three days’ time, and when I come, you’d better be ready.”

She turned, hopping off the counter in one fluid motion before striding toward the living room with that same, casual gait. She stopped at the threshold and glanced back at me.

“Oh, and Glenn?”

“What?” I said warily.

She smiled sweetly, amber eyes glowing faintly. “Don’t keep me waiting.”

Then, with a swish of her tails, she disappeared into the shadows of the house.

I stayed frozen in the kitchen for a long while, listening to the silence that followed. The light above me had stopped flickering, but the weight of the room felt heavier—like it wasn’t entirely mine anymore.

To be continued.
