 I moved into this house two weeks ago. It’s a steal—way below market price for a place this size. Sure, it’s old, with creaky floorboards and a musty smell that clings to everything no matter how much I air it out, but I figure I can fix it up. After my breakup and losing my job, I need a fresh start, and this house feels like a chance to rebuild. It’s just me now, a 27-year-old trying to piece my life back together, and this place—drafty and worn as it is—seems like a blank slate. At least, that’s what I tell myself.

The first few days are normal enough. I unpack my boxes, arrange my mismatched furniture, and try to make the place feel like home. But then, small things start happening. I leave my keys on the kitchen counter, and when I come back, they’re on the dining table. At night, I hear faint scratching sounds—like nails dragging across wood—but when I check, nothing’s there. I tell myself it’s just the house settling or maybe a mouse problem. Old houses have quirks, don’t they?

The clocks start acting strange. There’s this old grandfather clock in the hallway that came with the place, and one night, I notice it’s ticking backward. Not just the hands moving the wrong way, but the sound itself feels reversed, like time’s unwinding. I think it’s broken, so I stop it, pulling the weights down. The next morning, it’s ticking again, still backward. I unplug every clock in the house after that—my microwave, my alarm clock—but somehow, they keep going. Even my phone’s clock starts glitching, the numbers counting down instead of up. I stare at it, watching 11:59 flip to 11:58, and a cold sweat prickles my skin.

I try to ignore it, but I can’t shake the feeling of being watched. Shadows dart in the corners of my vision, vanishing when I turn to look. One evening, I catch my reflection in the bathroom mirror, and for a split second, it doesn’t mimic me. I wave my hand, but it just stands there, staring with hollow eyes. I blink, and it’s back to normal, copying me again. I laugh it off—stress, I tell myself, rubbing my face. I’ve been sleeping poorly, and my mind’s playing tricks. But deep down, I know something’s wrong.

A few nights later, I wake up to whispering. It’s soft, coming from the walls, like a conversation just out of reach. I stumble out of bed, press my ear against the plaster, and the voices stop. My breath fogs in the chilly air. Then, as I pull away, words appear on the wall, scrawled in elegant, looping script: Welcome home. My heart slams against my ribs. I grab a cloth and scrub the words away, my hands shaking. The next morning, they’re back, this time saying, You’re mine now. I stare at them, the ink glistening like it’s still wet, and my stomach twists.

I decide I’ve had enough. I pack a bag—clothes, my laptop, my phone—and head for the front door. The handle turns, but the door won’t open, stuck like it’s cemented shut. I yank harder, then try the windows. They won’t budge either, not even when I swing a chair at them. The glass doesn’t crack; it just flexes, absorbing the impact like rubber. My phone won’t connect to the internet, and calls drop before they can ring. Panic claws at my throat. I’m trapped.

That’s when the house starts to change. The walls feel alive, expanding and contracting in slow, rhythmic pulses, like they’re breathing. The floorboards groan underfoot—not from age, but as if they’re shifting, responding to me. I check the photos I hung on the walls—pictures of my family from better days—and their faces are blurred, like they’re being erased. In one, where my mother used to stand smiling, there’s now just the faint outline of the house’s facade, its windows like unblinking eyes staring back at me. I rip it off the wall, but the image stays burned in my mind.

Time stops making sense. Days blur together. I find myself in rooms I don’t remember entering, holding objects—like a spoon or a book—I don’t recall picking up. The whispers grow louder, weaving through the air, and the notes on the walls multiply. Stay with me, one says, scratched into the kitchen cabinets. You belong here, another taunts from the bedroom ceiling. I try to hold onto my memories—my mother’s laugh, my ex’s voice—but they’re slipping away. All I can picture is the house, its peeling wallpaper and sagging beams closing in.

Last night, I looked in the mirror, and what I saw wasn’t me. My skin’s covered in the same faded wallpaper pattern that lines the halls—yellowed and peeling, cracked like old paint. My arms feel stiff, like wooden beams, and my legs seem rooted to the floorboards, creaking when I move. I try to scream, but no sound comes out—just a hollow rasp, like wind through an empty room. The house is consuming me, making me part of it.

I don’t know how much time I have left. Somehow, my laptop connects to the internet—maybe the house is letting me do this, one last act before it takes me completely. I’m posting this here because I need help. I need to know if anyone else has experienced this. Has your house ever felt alive? Has it tried to take you, to rewrite who you are until you’re just another piece of it? Please, I need answers before it’s too late. I can hear the walls breathing louder now, and the whispering—it’s calling my name.
