I work security for a research company, if you can even call it security. I can't say the name of the company, as I may be fired, or worse. I'm here to explain to the world the things they found in the mountains, as it destroys our entire understanding of evolution. I don't exactly know where I was stationed, as we are not told the locations we are deployed to. Based on accents of the researchers at the research station, we may be somewhere in Siberia, or Russia. I was assigned to this research group, towards the base of the mountain. Bunch of crates around, from carboard boxes, military crates, to shipping containers. There was a lot of equipment as well, which was to be expected.

 Heaters surrounded computers, machines, and those plastic foldable tables you'd find at frat parties. Mind you, it was fucking freezing. Everyone was wearing at least three to four layers of pants, jackets, or whatever they could put on to keep from freezing their asses off. With all the heaters focused on keeping the equipment from turning into a block of ice. I've been skiing before with family, (Wife, and teenaged son) and it never got this cold. (I don't know if it was because we were standing around or what.) I did see one other security guard, let's call him Steve, who was assigned to my group. He looked miserable, face red like a tomato, and ice forming on his beard. We were chatting a bit to pass the time. Just shit to lighten the mood, like "Isn't as bad as California traffic." "a bit chilly out, isn't it?", that sort of thing. He did seem to enjoy the talking, as he smiled a lot more, and looked more alive than before. 

It wasn't long before we were approached by this tall guy in a thick white coat, I'd say he was around 6'7. Looked like he was ready for the arctic, dressed in a pair of goggles and this thick cotton mask you'd see in every Skiing photo. He removed his white cotton mask, face red from the cold. "Hey, I need you and your friend to follow me over to our station." He said while pointing over to what looked like an enclosed tent. I couldn't see much, as the snow was decently bright from the sun. Without letting me or Steve speak, he turned around and started hopping through the snow over to his tent. Steve looked over at me, shrugging before following the researcher. Once we got over to the tent, we saw this massive hole in the ground. I'd say it was a car or two wide. Deep too. Like really deep. A light just barely visible at the bottom, where I assume they have set up a little camp. The researcher climbed down the ladder that was fixed to the opening of this gaping hole in the earth, traveling down into the darkness. We followed him, eventually reaching the bottom. Felt like hours trying to climb down there. 

At the bottom, we were met by three more researchers who were claiming to have discovered something alien. They handed us what looked like pictures of the structure. It looked like one of those doors you'd see in Sci-Fi movies about alien planets or future representations of earth. Except, it was way more rusted. There were huge dents in the door, as if something, or someone tried to escape. We tried to question the photos, but were quickly shut down by one of the researchers. Steve and I were told there was already a team waiting for us at the entrance, and all we had to do was walk down the tunnel to find them. I didn't question it at the time, which in hindsight, I should of. 

Once we met with the team, the instructed us not to leave your assigned group. They split us into groups, as it would help cover more ground. Me and Steve were put in the same group, along with four other people. They also told us, that if anything seemed strange, or off, evacuate your operating zone, and run for the exit. Now, as you can probably guess, I was losing my shit. What was in there that called for such precautions? I would have asked more about it, but team leader, (or who I assumed to be based on him telling everyone what to do) had already began handing out Night Vision Goggles for everyone in each group, instructing that everyone stay silent, and move quietly while in the Facility. 

He called it a Facility, which got me wondering why they knew about it before we did. How many times have they been in there? Quickly after, we started moving to the entrance of the Facility. The red light above the big rusty door lit up the small space around us, before turning to this green blue mixed color. I'm assuming some speaker was also present, as this loud buzzing sound filled the cave tunnel before the door started to grind open. It made this horrible sound, like taking a rusty knife and running over steel. We were hit by this wave of warm moist air coming from inside the structure. 

It smelled like a hospital mixed with an old attic, with the slightest hint of pennies, or blood. Inside was this pretty big room, like the lobby of a building, or a 4 car garage. The Ceiling was curved, like an aircraft hangar, with pipes running along the roof. there was a chain-link fence on the right, containing large rusty metal crates, and barrels. They didn't have any markings on them, neither did the crates. There was a gate further down, but it was locked with a padlock, assuming so no one would steal whatever the hell was in those containers behind the fence. One of the team members made a sharp inhale, causing all of us to look over. He was staring into a vent, located on the ceiling.

 I don't know it was, but whatever he was staring at, was staring back at us. It was this, thing. It had no face. I don't know what the fuck we saw, but it had no face. Not like the slender man, no. It had human features, or what was trying to look human. It's eyes were way too big, white, with tiny dots in the middle of each eye. It's nose has seemed to of rotted away, and it's lips were torn, or chewed off. The gums were this deep red, something you'd see in a horror movie, and the teeth. I can't forget the teeth. It's mouth was ajar, showing what looked like thousands of rows of razor sharp toothpick like teeth, filling it's skeleton like face. We were in total shock, as if time had come to a complete stand still. It felt like an eternity before the Team leader raised his fire arm, and shot it right in it's face. 

The sound it made, was like a freight train slamming it's brakes at 800 mph. I guess this triggered something, and everyone else started shooting at this thing. It soon crawled away in the vent, the screeching continuing as it faded into the facility. I was hysterical, hyperventilating and trying to run out of the room, so was everyone else. I don't know what horrors are locked in that facility, but whatever it is. Maybe they're in here for a reason. I will keep you all posted, as I have another deployment there tomorrow. I'm not looking forward to going deeper in that place. Neither are the other members of out group, as some of them have already quit, and refuse to come back.
