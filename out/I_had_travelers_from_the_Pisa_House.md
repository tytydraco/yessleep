In theory, I did know that buying this house could be a bad idea. It wasn’t in the best neighborhood in the city, but it also wasn’t in the worst. It needed some work for sure, but it was in my price range. There was the matter of the old house next door whose foundation was so wrecked that the house was literally, visually leaning towards my house. I remember my agent chuckling nervously when he took me to see it. I believe he said something along the lines of “they’re like close friends, just wanting to be near each other.” I don’t think I even bothered to respond to that quip. But, I’d wanted a house and this was in my price range, and look, MY house wasn’t the one leaning, so technically it was fine. 

It was not fine. 

The house next door was uninhabited and just sat for a number of years that I lived there. I’d begun to refer to it as the Pisa house, feeling very proud of myself for my clever wordplay, but it wasn’t an unreasonable moniker. Every time we got a reasonably strong storm, I eyed it nervously, waiting to see the incremental creep closer and closer, until my own investment was crushed. It never did. It was a spooky looking house, the tilt aside. The neighborhood was historic, but not historic enough to be taken care of. The Pisa house was probably circa 1905-ish like mine was, and benefited from some of the nicer details that came from the era it was built. A pseudo-Victorian, but some years too late to be impressive.

The trouble came when the neighborhood started gentrifying. I’m not pro or anti-gentrification. To be honest, I’m probably a little too dumb to understand it all anyway. All I know is that when younger couples started buying up those affordable little shotguns, breweries and coffee shops seemed to follow quickly after. The Pisa house being an eyesore and a hazard started seeming like a legitimate problem to these folks. Then, almost overnight, the city tore it down. Quite literally overnight actually. We’d been going through an insane hot spell, and night might’ve been the only time the workers would agree to do manual labor outside. 

The first storm since the tear-down happened was much easier without the old beast looming over my side. My view got better, too. It’s nicer to look at an empty lot with a tree and some grass, than it is to look into the guts of a rotted out house. No one squatted on the lot and it just seemed to sit, growing grass. I’d felt extremely validated in my decision to buy my house since then, up until it started to get cold outside. 

Maybe it’s a simplistic look on the world, but I came to realize that everything and everyone has to go somewhere. None of us can really disappear. Spooky or practical, it’s just true. And when it gets cold is when we all try to find our place to go. 

What you have to remember is that I’d been living in my house for at least five years at this point. I knew its groans and wheezes. I knew when a bat got in the attic and when I had a possum in the crawlspace. It was an old house and it had its quirks, but I’d learned how they all sounded. Then the new sounds started coming in. 

Glass shattering. Footsteps too large to be an animal. Blustering winds when it was perfectly still outside. All of these still seemed too quiet to be real, but too loud to be ignored. I didn’t sleep, which goes without saying. I felt eyes on me all the time. I wasn’t loved enough in the world for anyone to check on me, and I was too proud to ask anyone to come look. It was me and my house. I was more angry than scared at some point. I had not bought a haunted house. No one had died in my tenure there, so I was furious it seemed to haunt itself overnight. A bad investment, if you will.

Then a knock on my door one late September evening. A young woman who looked more at home in the trendier areas of the city than this was standing on my front porch. She looked like she fit right in at the natural wine bar that had just opened a block over. In fact, I remember thinking to myself, maybe that’s where she’d come from. 

“Hi,” she started nervously as I opened the door. “My name is Helen. I’m from the neighborhood association and -”

“When did we get a neighborhood association?” I grumbled, still holding the door half closed. 

“Oh, yes, well it’s new. We’re just getting to know residents and handing out information about the meetings.” 

She paused, waiting as an indication for me to say something. I did not.

“So, I have some information here-”

A crash sounded from the attic, shaking the house to its foundation.

“What the fuck was that?” she gasped, all semblances of her carefully crafted professionalism gone.

“The house is haunted.”

I wasn’t wrong and it was a fair statement, but mostly I’d been hoping it’d make her go away. Instead her eyes lit up as she glanced past me at the staircase, straining to see in the dim light. She smiled then, eyes meeting mine. 

“Would you like me to get rid of it?”

I had started to notice over the years that gentrification had somehow brought along a bunch of new-age bullshit with it. The hardware store that had been shuttered since before I even moved in had turned into an art gallery with bleached white animal skulls in the front windows. I always thought it was a little gross, but apparently it was spiritual. Or something. I still don’t know. I was more of a watercolor person. Still, she looked like a clientele of “tarot night” which I had seen a flyer for the other day. If I sound grumpy describing it now, it’s because I still find it irritating. 

Back then though, with this woman on my porch telling me she could end my sleepless nights, yeah, I let her in. 

We stood in the attic, the light getting weaker and weaker as the evening turned towards night. I had done a lot of work on the rest of the house, but the attic was in its original form. Dusty and old. The small window to the side is where the Pisa house used to almost touch. I thought it’d be lighter in here without the old house blocking its view, but it seemed darker than before. 

“I feel something,” she murmured, lowering herself to the floor. 

The attic got darker still. 

“I need to invite them to speak with me,” she asked, now looking towards me. “I have to warn you that some interpret that as an invite to stay.”

“Well, don’t invite them to stay!” I sputtered. 

“Spirits, we invite you to speak with us. We wish no harm, only to understand,” she spoke to the now eerily still attic.

I slid down the wall in the far corner, trying to make myself as small as possible while I watched. It was silent for some time, but Helen didn’t open her eyes. I’m not sure how long we waited, but it felt like time was stretching, tight like a rubber band. Until it snapped. 

“They’re traveling,” she began to speak, eyes still closed. “They had a home for many years and it left them. It’s not just people who leave, they say. To be deserted by your home…” she trailed off then began again. “There are four of them. They are confused. They slipped in here from the cold. They say they came from Pisa. They’re laughing.”

I blanched at that and she opened an eye to glance at me. 

“Are you from Italy?”

“No, I- well it’s a long story,” I managed to get out.

“They fled in the night,” she continued, eyes now shut again. “It’s not their first time running. They’ve been many places. Forced to leave in their waking lives and forced to travel in their sleeping lives. It’s a punishment for… they won’t say. They’re being punished for something.”

“What…” I ventured, “what do they look like?” 

“Cold,” was her only reply.

“Can they pass on?” I asked. I’d heard that lingo before on late night ghost-hunting shows.

“They’re laughing again,” she said. “Passing on is all they’ve been doing. They say there is no after. All they do is pass on and on and on and on,” she began to choke. 

I shot up and rushed to her. I had no idea what to do but her eyes rolled back in her head as she continued to choke. If it was a seizure I didn’t know what to do for that either. 

“Go!” I shouted helplessly to the attic. “Go on, you’re not welcome here! You can’t stay here! You’re not welcome!” 

“They’re laughing,” she choked out.

Then as suddenly as it started, it stopped. Helen laid on the floor, a sheen of sweat on her face, but her breathing became steady. She stayed still for some time before opening her eyes. 

“They’re gone.” 

I helped her down to the kitchen and put a glass of water in front of her. She was still pale but regaining some more color. I had never replaced the fluorescent lighting of the kitchen, but now that blinding white light was a comfort in stark contrast to the shadows of the attic we’d just escaped.

“They’re gone,” she said again, hands still shaking around the glass of water. “I don’t think they’re coming back.”

“How do you know?”

“They were so angry. They were angry because they had to leave again.” She paused to catch her breath, her voice shaking now. “They’ve been leaving forever. I got the impression that there used to be a lot of empty places for them.”

“Well, I don’t really feel sorry for them,” I muttered. 

She grinned then, catching my eye.

“I’m still not joining the neighborhood association,” I said. 

“Fair enough.”
