Hello, I have never made a post on here before, but I am unsure of where to turn with this. My boyfriend, Ben (26m), and I (25f) have been living together for almost eight months now. We have been together for two years and it made sense financially for him to move into my apartment, as he was spending most nights here anyway. We met each other at a bonfire on the beach, a small get-together organized by mutual friends of ours. We exchanged glances across the fire for around an hour before he got the courage to offer me a beer. He was softspoken and awkward, virtually the complete opposite of me. We shared a beer between the ocean tide and the crackling fire throughout that night and have been together almost every night since then. Ben was my rock and I loved him entirely. He was always the type to find small ways to brighten my life, like throwing my pajamas in the dryer so they would be warm for me after my shower, making me hot tea during nights when I couldn’t sleep, etc.

However, things began to change after Ben got his new job. We had both worked from home the entirety of our relationship (our jobs allowed for remote positions during COVID and stayed remote ever since). A month ago, Ben applied for an office job with a different company where he would essentially be making a third more of a month’s salary doing the same work he is now. I was hesitant about this change, as the most amount of time Ben and I have spent apart since that bonfire was a weekend Vegas trip I took with my girlfriends last year. Even in those two days with casinos and parties grasping for my focus, I could only think about Ben. I was just so used to glancing at my side and Ben being right there, always having a constant knowing of his presence. I gulped back my anxieties and remembered that A) we desperately needed money for the house we were saving for and B) it could be beneficial for Ben and I to spend time apart. If even the thought of being away from him for eight hours a day was giving me withdrawal symptoms, I needed to find peace in solace again.



The first morning of Ben leaving for his new job three days ago was the most difficult. It felt as if my skin was attempting to sink into his body, that my anxious gut was screaming at me not to let him go. My nervous system was reacting to his departure as if I were never going to see him again. I wrapped my arms around his neck tightly as we slowly inched toward our front door. 



He pulled his face from the curve of my neck and smiled, “This will be good for us. This way, we 

will be able to savor every moment together even more tenderly.”



I buried my face into his chest and groaned in protest, “Can’t we just stand here on this doormat forever?”



“If only,” Ben chuckled. He pushed his lips into my forehead with an exaggerated “MUAH!” and hurried out of the apartment before I could hug him again, shutting the door behind him. 



I sighed.

Without missing a beat, he quickly cracked the door and poked his mouth through. “I love you!” he whisper-shouted, and closed the door yet again.

I spent that day writhing on the couch, my eyes darting between the clock and the front door instead of work emails and video meetings. The minutes stretched into hours, and the only thing on my mind was the embrace of Ben the minute he walked through that door. For context, his place of work is about a 32-minute commute from home, and with a grace period of an estimated seven minutes to walk to the car and pull it out of the parking garage, he would be home about 5:39 PM.

Shit, maybe I am clingy.

Ben got home that evening at 5:30. I jumped with the swing of the front door as he dropped his bag in the entryway. He shoved the door closed with his shoulder and sauntered into the kitchen, his eyes on the floor. He leaned onto the counter facing the living room, stretching his arms in a wide base below him.



I slowly rose from the couch. “Hey, how was work?” my voice wavered.



Ben’s eyes shot up at me through his eyebrows. “What do you think?” he snapped.



I gripped the sides of my thighs. I couldn’t imagine how tiresome this job was if it caused Ben to be so exhausted at the end of the day, so rigid in his responses.



My nose burned and I blinked. “Oh, uh… I’m so sorry.”



He half-nodded with a grunt and turned to the fridge, yanking it open and grabbing a beer.

I couldn’t fathom the urge to refrain from hugging Ben, especially after the day I spent pining over his presence, but I couldn’t move from the ground I stood. It was almost instinct, like my body refused to go near him in that moment. I couldn’t decipher if the lump in my chest was fear, concern, confusion, or all three.



“I missed you,” I shook, my hands bunching the sleeves of my sweatshirt into tight knots.



The beer can touched his lips and he froze. His eyes widened until they bulged, and he jerked his head in my direction. A wide, toothy smile slithered across his face as his eyebrows stretched into his forehead.



“I missed you too!” he shrilled as he slammed the beer can onto the counter and sprinted across the apartment, scooping me up into a hug and twirling me in a circle. My skin grew goosebumps as his cheek squished into mine, his hands grasping my back like talons.



“My gosh, you’re so cold!” I exclaimed, and he quickly set me back on the ground. I patted the back of my hand onto his cheek. “Are you coming down with something?”



Ben straightened his back and cleared his throat. In monotone, he said, “Maybe you’re just… hot.” He pivoted his entire body at once and speed-walked down the hall into the bathroom, slammed the door shut, and started a shower.



Already? He was already wanting separation from each other moments after he walked in the door, moments after our reunion from an eight-hour work day, he was already secluded in the bathroom. My teeth ground as I attempted a deep breath. His humor peeking through his exhaustion was comforting, but I couldn’t shake how cold he was, both in demeanor and physical state. The memory of his hands through my sweatshirt felt foreign and frosted, as if someone outside had switched them out with their own. I predicted that it would be a long time before either of us got used to us being separated by the outside world.

I figured that a warm soup might help soothe Ben from… whatever ailment he had come down with. Hopefully, some chicken noodle soup would rid the mystery fever and bring my boyfriend back to our senses. I switched on the stove and instantly became Betty Homemaker.



17 minutes after Ben went to the bathroom, he emerged into the kitchen in a towel. His dark hair strung in front of his eyes, dripping water into a puddle below him. His skin was glowing a healthy peach flush, and his eyes were bright with that smile I had missed.



“There he is!” I exclaimed and brought my palm to his cheek.



He jumped back. “Oh — I… yeah.” His eyes fell to the ground as his shoulders sank into his chest.



I furrowed my brows at him. “Hello? What is going on with you? I work all day, I make you dinner, and you can’t look at me?”



“No, it’s not —”



I reached my hand out for his shoulder.

I can’t remember anything else from that night.



I woke up the next morning with a gasp, my pulse pounding through my body as I shot up from my pillow. I whipped my head to my left and found Ben sleeping peacefully beside me, his shoulder blades rising and falling in a soft rhythm. The new light of the morning cascaded across the muscles of his back like mountains at sunrise.

I grabbed my chest and sighed. A nightmare. An incredibly horrific nightmare. I admired the back of his head, gazing at the messy tufts of hair falling in all directions and smiled. He was real, this was real, *we* were real.

I placed my hand on the center of his back and he jolted awake.



“Jeez!” Ben shouted, propping himself on his elbows. He tucked his head into his chest, his bicep shielding his audible grimaces.



“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you!” I exclaimed as I pulled my arm back into myself.



“Well, you did!” he shouted once more.



Ben turned to me and I felt my blood run cold.

His face was pink with black char surrounding gashes across his forehead. The left half of his lips melted into his chin, exposing his teeth through the back of his mouth. His eyebrows were completely gone, along with one of his eyelids, and his cheeks fell into his neck like the jowls of a bulldog. His watery eyes bulged at me, the surrounding areas of his irises red and veiny.



I shrieked and threw myself backwards out of bed, tumbling to the floor wrapped in bedsheets. I thrashed on the floor and wriggled out of the sheets, leaping to my feet and sprinting to the bedroom door.



He hurriedly sat up in bed. “What?” he questioned with a panicked inflection.



I gripped my hand on the doorknob and smashed my back against the wall. “Your face!” I screamed, my breath burning my throat.



Ben hobbled out of bed to my vanity, examining himself in the mirror.

He sighed, “What about my face, Amber?”



I let out a shaky breath, “You’re hurt, Ben. You are terribly hurt!”



He rolled his glassy eyes and grunted. “I don’t have time for this,” he muttered, then proceeded to walk into our closet and start getting dressed.



My lungs tightened as my eyes fixed on the window, steadily blurring in and out of focus. I slipped down the wall onto the ground, my chin frozen in a raised position. I could not form a thought in those moments. My mind whirled as it grasped for some sort of grounding, some sort of explanation for reality. Ben’s complaints as he stirred around the apartment faded into background noise as if I were underwater.

Suddenly, the front door slammed. My brain snapped from its comatose state, which had only felt like a few seconds, and told my eyes to look at our bedside alarm clock.

7:17 — 21 minutes since I had woken Ben up.

I don’t remember much of yesterday. I had called in to work and spent most of it on the couch. I decided to try and sleep away this nightmare, this fever dream, whatever stupid hallucination I had been experiencing for the past two days. I remember drifting off into a haze of darkness, desperately attempting to reset my mind.

I was woken up by the walls shaking as the bathroom door shut. 

I glanced at the clock: 6:09

I heard the shower curtain faintly squeak along the rod and the faucet turn on.

I shivered. Quietly, I tiptoed across the apartment towards the bathroom. I passed the thermostat and found it was set to 60 degrees. Ben and I preferred the apartment to be colder side, but never below 70. We simply did not make enough money for a skyrocketed electric bill. I figured Ben was becoming too used to his new salary already. Regardless, I was freezing. I rubbed my hands along my arms and turned the knob back to the usual 72 degrees.

I approached the bathroom and gently placed my ear on the door. I could make out little musical hums in Ben’s voice with the water splashes dimming as he went under the shower head. My feet shivered on the cold floor, and I noticed the lack of steam seeping from under the crack of the door. Was he really taking a cold shower in our already arctic apartment?

I decided to pick my mental battles, as these nightmares are already messing with my psyche as is. I was just glad to hear Ben’s happy hums. This was real.

I began to grease a pan in preparation for a chicken dinner for Ben and I. I switched on the stove and waited until I heard those beloved popping sounds of the warmed fryer.

The shower stopped with the curtain squeaking once more. A beat, then a door opening, then heavy footsteps approaching behind me in the kitchen. I turned to find my Ben, soaking wet in only a towel, his face perfectly the same as it had always been, beaming with delight.



I relaxed my shoulders and let out a deep breath, “Hi, you!”

I stepped forward to hug him but he leaned away.



“Hey, uh… still wet,” he said.



My throat knotted. “Right,” I sighed, “I’m making chicken if you want to grab a plate—”



“Did you touch the thermostat?” he snapped.



He darted into the living room and quickly switched it back down. His head whipped over his shoulder and he shot his eyes through me.



I crossed my arms. “Ben, it’s cold! We can’t afford that utility bill with the air conditioning that low.”



He closed his eyes and growled, “It can’t be hot.”



I shook my head, “It won’t—”



“No!” he barked and stormed into the bedroom.



I switched off the stove and followed him into the bedroom. As I entered through the door, I found his towel thrown to the floor and him already tucked into bed, seemingly already asleep. I leaned into the doorway, bumping my forehead into the doorframe. I hated that new job that he got. It had only been two days, and it seemed that both of us were losing our minds.

I gently crawled into bed and shifted under the covers. I studied Ben, studied that same back and that same hair and that same soft snore that I had been studying for the past two years. He was physically the same as he had always been, but the darkness he exudes is becoming more sinister with every short moment I have spent with him the past few days.

I pressed my lips together and took my eyes to the small motivational sign hanging above my vanity: *This too shall pass.*

I leaned over Ben and kissed his cheek goodnight, a guttural howl from him quickly following.



I remember nothing else from last night.

I woke up this morning similarly to the morning before, my heart racing and my lungs gasping for breath. I turned to my bedside table and read the clock— 6:42. I turned back and found Ben at my side, the same back rising and falling. This was absolutely real.



“Ben,” I whispered.



He shifted slightly under the covers.



I whisper-shouted, “Ben!”



“Whaaat?” he grunted into the pillow.



I smiled. “Can I see your face?” I asked in a sing-song tone.



He didn’t respond.



I traced my finger down his arm, “Ben—”



He jolted upwards and screeched, “You bitch!”



I jumped. Ben had never spoken to me in that manner, let alone demean me so blatantly. He had always been my sweet Ben, so gentle and loving that I had never felt safer than in his presence. I couldn’t help but be rocked. Was I still dreaming?



He whipped around and revealed a fleshy mass hanging across his face. There was only a triangular void where his nose had once been, and pus oozed from blisters plastered under his gelatinous eyes and drooping mouth. His skin looked like strawberry taffy stretched over his skull like a poorly adjusted mask, and his teeth jutted out of his jaw with an overstated underbite. His pillow was stained red and orange with fluids dripping down into the mattress.



I froze. This was real.

I am writing this from my closet floor. Ben is off to work again as if nothing has changed, and here I am taking another day off work and replaying the image of his face melting in my mind. I am questioning my own tether to reality and whether or not I should commit myself. I will update as soon as I have any further information as to what is going on with my boyfriend or why my mind is tricking me in this manner.
