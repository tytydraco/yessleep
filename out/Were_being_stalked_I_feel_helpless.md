It’s only 9PM and I already feel the impeding dread of what’s to come. As me and my girlfriend sit in bed we can feel it’s eyes fixated on us, not letting us out of its sight. 
Let’s go back a bit, I (19M) and my girlfriend Tabby(18F) enjoy going on paranormal investigations quite often. On one particular night we decided to take a look at a particular cemetery only about 15 minutes outside of our hometown. I’ve been to Asbury multiple times, although I’ve never encountered anything more than a few scratches, and the feeling of being watched. The only major difference this night was me and tabby decided to go alone instead of bringing our usual investigation group. 

It was her first time going to Asbury so she was fairly excited to see the new place. I have her a quick history of the place, explaining how it was the towns oldest cemetery with graves dating back to the Civil war, and is rumored to be built beside an unmarked Native American burial ground. When we finally pulled up to the cemetery from the long forested gravel road, we noticed immediately that something felt off. I was filled with a sense of immediate dread and felt an icy stare that went straight through me and into my soul. I decided to brush it off and assure her we would be fine saying we were probably just paranoid, it was a darker night under a new moon. As we walked through the cemetery the feeling got worse, as if we were being stalked by something from a distance. It didn’t feel like the usual demonic or ghostly presence I’ve grown accustomed to, this was something much more sinister. After about an hour of checking graves and walking around with EMF readers we settled on a particular spot by the grave of what we assumed to be an unmarked witches grave. It had a metal spiked fence around the grave, and concrete over where the coffin would lie. I brought out a spirit box and decided to test my luck with getting something to communicate. After turning it on and hearing the static of it switching through the radio stations we finally heard a deep, but clear raspy voice come through saying “RUN”. I felt that same Icy feeling shoot through me and my fight or flight activated. I looked over at tabby and she was quite obviously on edge, paranoid that something would happen. It was at this point I decided to quickly pack our equipment and grab her hand, fast walking to truck so we could leave. 

When we finally left the cemetery we felt relieved, knowing we couldn’t be followed by whatever spirit haunted the graveyard. Fast forward about 2 weeks later. It was around 9:30pm as we were getting ready for work. She works a nightshift at a local nursing home, and I work the night shift at a local gas station. It was at this point we felt that same feeling as we did the night at the graveyard. We felt something watching us as the world around us gave off the worst energy I’ve ever felt. We hesitantly walked outside leaving for work and could feel this creature getting closer. We didn’t waste anytime leaving, terrified of whatever was watching. This continued almost every night until we decided to have a backyard campfire 2 nights ago. 

Everything felt fine and we stayed outside until around 2AM when we put out the fire and started to walk to the backdoor. As I went to step inside I heard it, a howling like a coyote coming from behind the fence. The worst part was it didn’t sound like a normal coyote, it sounded almost like it was imitating a the howl of one. We ran in and locked the doors, fearing it was the creature that’s been watching us. For the remainder of the night we heard it walking around the house, scratching at the outside wall and making a strange noise. We sat and listened to it feeling on edge until morning when it slowly faded off. 

It wasn’t until yesterday that I could say the story got worse. I woke up around 3AM and went to go grab a drink from the kitchen, trying not to wake tabby or my roommates in the process. As I was grabbing a drink I heard my roommate screaming from outside. Saying she was scared and locked out, that something was watching her and she needed in. I ran to open the door when she walked into the kitchen asking what I was doing. I froze and turned around to face her, still waking u from her sleep. It had gone silent outside, until I heard a faint but audible whistle coming from outside. I felt the hairs on my neck stand up as my roommate quietly asked what was whistling outside. I simply told her not to worry about it and we walked back to our rooms. I know it’s a skinwalker that’s watching us, or something similar. I’m scared for what tonight may bring, if anyone has any advice that may help us get rid of this creature please comment below. For now I’m just waiting, until it decides to make a move…..
