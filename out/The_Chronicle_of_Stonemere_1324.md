In the year of our Lord thirteen hundred and twenty four, in the season of Lent, I set my hand to this record with trembling spirit. I am Brother Matthew, the least of the brethren in the house of Saint Cuthbert, charged with the keeping of accounts both spiritual and temporal.

It is not my custom to write of matters unfit for the pulpit, nor of tales whispered by peasants round their hearths. Yet my conscience bids me, for what I have witnessed in the village of Stonemere presses upon my soul with such weight that silence seems the greater sin. These things I lay down not to delight the curious, nor to stir vain superstition, but that the Church may discern whether what has passed is judgment from God or the snares of the Enemy.

I write with care, for there are truths that bite like serpents when uttered aloud, and darker still when set in ink. Should this book fall into unworthy hands, let the reader beware. I am but a poor monk, yet I know that the forest west of Stonemere is not as other forests. It broods. It watches.

Before I record what befell, I pray that God Almighty preserve me from error, lest I set down lies that may imperil the soul. And if it please Him, may He shield my hand from the evil that lingers even as I write, for I swear by the holy Cross that I hear it even now, moving in the branches beyond the cloister wall.

Entry I

In the year of our Lord thirteen hundred and twenty four, when the frost yet clung to the earth and the fields lay barren, there arose much fear among the people of Stonemere. They spoke in hushed voices of the forest that lies to the west, which in their tongue is called the Black Wood. From of old it has borne that name, for the trees therein are darker than others, and the paths within do not keep their course.

The elders say that since the days of our forefathers no man who entered after nightfall returned in his right mind. Some were found days later, wandering with hollow eyes, speaking no word but the name of Cain. Others were never found at all, save for bones gnawed bare, though no beast would dare feed so near the village.

The priest, Father Anselm, forbade the people to give ear to such tales. He exhorted them to prayer and fasting, reminding them that the forest is but God’s creation and that only sin gives power to the fiend. Yet I confess that his words rang hollow, for his own countenance grew pale when the wind carried laughter through the trees. It was not the laughter of children, nor of men, but something lower and heavier, like the grinding of millstones deep beneath the earth.

The villagers crossed themselves and hastened their steps whenever they passed that way. Even the oxen strained against the yoke if the cart drew near the wood’s edge. I myself did not enter, for though I trust in God’s mercy, I am but flesh, and the memory of those hollow-eyed wanderers sits heavy upon my mind.

Entry II

In the week following the Feast of Saint Benedict, sorrow fell upon Stonemere. The miller’s son, a boy of seven years named Tomas, was lost. His mother swore she had seen him gathering kindling near the pasture at vespers, yet when the bells rang for compline he did not return. They found his small footprints pressed into the mud, leading toward the Black Wood. There the trail ceased.

At dawn, the men of the village gathered with Father Anselm. They bore torches, though the sun had risen, for none trusted the shade of those trees. They called the boy’s name until their throats grew raw, and they searched till the light failed, yet the paths bent strangely beneath their feet. One man said he had walked a circle, returning again to the same ash tree thrice, though he swore he had kept a straight course.

That night, I heard from those who went that the wood was not silent as it should be. No birds sang, no fox stirred, but there was a sound like breath drawn deep and long, as though the forest itself were alive and waiting.

When the men returned empty-handed, the women wept. The mother tore her garments and cried that she heard her child calling from within, but Father Anselm forbade her to go, lest she be lost also. He spoke sternly, yet his hands shook as he lifted the cross.

It is my duty to set down true witness, yet my soul trembles to write what follows. For though the boy was not seen again, in the night the wind carried his voice across the fields. More than one swore to hearing it. He cried his mother’s name, weak and plaintive, as though standing just beyond the edge of the pasture. Yet when the people ran to the place, there was nothing but the black of the trees.

Entry III

On the third night after the loss of young Tomas, his mother swore she heard him calling once more. It was past midnight, and the moon hung thin as a sickle. She rose from her bed, though her kin begged her remain within, and went forth with a lantern toward the pasture. Her voice carried through the dark, crying his name as if to guide him home.

At dawn they found her. She lay upon the very edge of the Black Wood, as though she had crossed its border and been cast out again. Her body was pale, colder than the earth itself. Her mouth hung open, yet no sound issued, and her eyes were wide as though frozen in terror. Her throat bore deep wounds, yet no blood stained her garment nor the soil where she lay.

Upon her breast the people beheld a mark, black and burned as though pressed by an unseen hand. It was the shape of a palm with fingers spread wide. The flesh around it was not torn, but seared, as if the very fire of hell had touched her.

The villagers recoiled in dread. Some fell to their knees, praying aloud, while others fled to their cottages and barred the doors. Father Anselm bade the men carry her to consecrated ground. She was buried that same day, without vigil or hymn, lest the people lose all courage.

Yet I, Brother Matthew, cannot rest easy. I saw with mine own eyes that black hand, and though my tongue dared not speak it, my soul quailed. For it seemed not only a mark of death, but of possession, as if the woman had been claimed by something that still waits within the wood.

Father Anselm spoke many words of comfort, yet I noted how his eyes wandered oft toward the western trees, and how his fingers trembled when he made the sign of the cross. I fear his faith wanes. God grant mine remain steadfast, for the air about Stonemere grows heavy, as though judgment itself draws near.

Entry IV

Since the burial of the miller’s wife, a shadow has fallen over Stonemere. The people go about their labors, yet without song and without cheer. Children are kept indoors, and no man lingers after sunset. When the bells ring compline, every door is fastened, and the streets lie empty as a tomb.

On the eve of Saint Joseph, the herdsman awoke to find two of his oxen dead in the stall. Their bodies were not torn, nor had wolves entered, but upon the flanks of each beast lay the same black hand that we saw upon the woman. The flesh was scorched, the hair curled inward, and though the air was cold, a stench of burning hung about them.

The people trembled greatly. Some cried that the plague of Egypt had come again. Others whispered that the miller’s son was taken in payment, and more must follow. Father Anselm forbade such speech, yet his voice lacked its former strength. He commanded fasts and processions, and the villagers obeyed, carrying the relic of Saint Cuthbert through the fields. But when they passed the Black Wood, the air grew still, and all fell silent, as though the very trees mocked their prayers.

As for me, I keep close within the cloister, yet even there the dread pursues me. Last night I swore I heard footsteps in the yard, though when I looked from my cell, none were abroad. The wind carried a sound that was not the cry of owls nor the voice of men. It was the same laughter the others had spoken of, deep and grinding, as of stones turning far beneath the ground.

I confess with sorrow that my hand trembled so greatly I could not hold the Psalter. My lips formed the words, yet my heart was far from peace. If this be a trial sent from God, may He forgive my weakness. Yet I fear it is not trial but judgment, and that the fiend himself has set his dwelling in those woods.

Entry V

These past weeks I have observed a change in Father Anselm, one that grieves me more than the wailing of the villagers or the silence of the fields. He, who once stood bold at the altar, now walks with downcast eyes. His words from the pulpit are fewer, and when he speaks, he dwells not upon Christ’s victory but upon watchfulness against the Devil.

In the night I have seen light from his chamber, though none dared disturb him. At length I went, thinking he had fallen asleep with the candle burning. Yet when I entered softly, I beheld him kneeling before the crucifix, his face as pale as wax. Before him burned not one candle but seven, their flames trembling though the air was still. He did not hear me, but whispered prayers I scarce understood, calling not only upon Christ but upon Michael the Archangel, upon Saint Benedict, and upon names I have never heard upon holy lips.

When he rose, his hands shook so that the wax dripped upon the floor. He bade me say nothing to the brethren, but I saw in his eyes a fear deeper than any villager’s. It is as though he believes his prayers hold back some flood, and that if his voice falters, we shall all be swept away.

The people trust him still, but I wonder how long. Some murmur that his fasts grow strange, that he speaks to himself at the altar, that he has written charms upon scraps of parchment and buried them at the edge of the wood. If this be true, I fear for his soul, for such arts belong not to the Church but to the Enemy.

Yet I dare not confront him. For when I looked into his eyes, I thought I glimpsed the same shadow I have seen moving beneath the trees, and my heart failed within me.

Entry VI

On the Feast of Saint Mark, the people gathered in the church, seeking comfort in the holy mass. The nave was filled, though no man raised his voice in hymn as before. All knelt in silence, their faces pale as though carved of stone. Father Anselm began the liturgy, yet I marked how his words faltered, and how his hand shook as he lifted the Host.

Then a thing befell that I scarce dare set down. As the bell rang for the elevation, the candles upon the altar sputtered as if struck by a wind, though the air was still. The flame of each candle bent toward the west, as though drawn by breath from the Black Wood itself. The people cried out, and one woman swooned upon the floor. Yet worse was to come.

For when Father Anselm raised the chalice, a black stain spread across the fair linen of the altar, though no drop of wine had yet been poured. It was the shape of a hand, dark and wide, the same mark that lay upon the woman and the oxen. The priest recoiled, spilling the chalice, and crimson ran down upon the stone as though blood had been shed.

A great fear fell upon all, and many fled the church. The doors were thrown wide, and I heard their footsteps beating the earth as they ran. Only a few remained, clutching their rosaries with white knuckles, their eyes fixed on Father Anselm. He trembled so that the chalice rang against the paten, and no word passed his lips.

I myself fell upon my knees, praying the Pater Noster with all the strength left in me. Yet I confess with shame that my eyes wandered, and in that moment I thought I saw, through the narrow window, a shadow move among the trees though the sun stood high.

I know not how long we knelt. At last Father Anselm spoke the words of dismissal, his voice hollow and thin, and the mass was ended. But it was no ending, only the beginning of our undoing.

Entry VII

Since the sign upon the altar, the people come no more to mass. The doors of the church stand open, yet few cross the threshold. They say the sanctuary itself is tainted, and that Father Anselm has lost his grace. He walks among them still, yet his eyes are hollow, and his voice is scarcely more than a whisper.

The villagers no longer speak of Tomas, nor of his mother, as though silence might drive away remembrance. Yet in the night their cottages shake with the sound of stones grinding, as though millwheels turned deep beneath the ground, though no river flows near. More than once I have heard it myself, even within the cloister, and my heart has failed me.

Last night I dreamt that I stood in the Black Wood. The trees bent inward, their branches like arms outstretched. In the midst of them was a figure clothed in shadow, holding the hand of a child. I thought it was Tomas, but when the boy turned his face, it was my own countenance I beheld, pale and hollow-eyed. I woke crying aloud, and the brothers came to my chamber. I told them it was but a vision born of weariness, yet I fear it was more.

I strive to keep the hours, yet when I take up the Psalter, the words fall dead upon my tongue. Oft my lips move, but my heart is empty. I know the Lord is merciful, yet I feel as though He has hidden His face from Stonemere, and that the fiend now rules where once Christ reigned.

I tremble as I write, for as the sun sank this evening, I heard a voice call my name from beyond the cloister wall. It was soft, like the cry of a child. I dared not look, yet the sound clings to my ear even now.

Entry VIII

This very night Father Anselm is gone. None saw him depart, yet his chamber lies empty, the candles burnt low upon the floor. Upon the table I found parchments scrawled with words not of the Church. They were prayers, yet mingled with strange signs, twisted circles, and names I dare not set down. It is plain to me that in his fear he sought not the mercy of Christ, but the power of forbidden arts.

At dawn some of the villagers said they beheld him walking alone toward the Black Wood, bearing no lantern, his head uncovered. They called to him, but he did not turn. He entered beneath the boughs, and the trees closed behind him. None have seen him since.

The people wail that their shepherd has abandoned them, and indeed it seems so. Yet in my soul I wonder if he was not called. For in the night the grinding laughter has grown louder, nearer, as though the forest itself draws breath at the loss of our priest.

This evening I ventured to his chamber once more, though my knees failed me. Upon the wall above his bed, the plaster was blackened in the shape of a hand. Its fingers stretched wide, reaching upward toward the crucifix. The wood of the cross was darkened also, as though fire had licked it, yet the figure of Christ remained untouched.

I know not what this portends. Yet I fear that if Father Anselm was claimed, then soon the same hand shall fall upon us all.

Entry IX

The days grow heavy, and the nights without end. Since Father Anselm’s passing into the Black Wood, the people have scattered. Some have fled to other villages, some shut themselves in their cottages and speak no word, and some I fear are lost already. The fields lie untended, and the bells are silent. Only I remain within the cloister, bound by vow and by fear alike.

Yet I am not alone. Each night the sound comes nearer, the grinding of stones as if the very earth turned upon itself. At times it breaks into laughter, low and cruel, and it fills my marrow with trembling. Last night I heard my own name called, soft as a whisper, and though I pressed my hands to my ears, still it sounded within me.

I confess with sorrow that I have begun to long for it. Not with joy, but with a heaviness of soul, as though some part of me is drawn by cords I cannot cut. I read the Psalms, yet my eyes fall shut, and in my mind I see the trees bending inward like a mouth about to close.

Today I returned to the church, seeking comfort. The altar still bears the stain of the hand, though it has sunk deeper into the stone as if the very rock were consumed. When I knelt, I felt the floor quiver beneath me, and a voice rose up from the earth itself, bidding me enter the forest. I fled, yet even now I hear it.

If God has hidden His face from Stonemere, then who shall deliver us? My ink runs thin, and my strength also. I know not if I can hold fast much longer.

Entry X

This night I can endure no longer. The voice calls ceaselessly from the wood, nearer than my own breath. I hear it through the walls, through the stones, even through my prayers. It is not Tomas, nor Father Anselm, but another that wears their tongues as a mask.

I have barred the door, yet I know it is vain. The hand is upon the wall of my cell, black and spreading. Each hour it grows, its fingers reaching toward my bed. The crucifix above me darkens, yet the figure of Christ remains, as if He will not depart, though I fear He has turned His face away.

My lamp burns low. The laughter rises. I know not whether it comes from the wood or from within my own breast. My hand trembles, yet I cannot resist. I go now into the forest. May God have mercy.
