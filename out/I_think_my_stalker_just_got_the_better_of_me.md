My first takeaway from the whole shitshow is that you should never, under any circumstance, open erotic videos from a memory stick that appears on your front porch in the middle of the night. 

I had neither the need nor the desire to view this Secret Santa porn, but I wanted to know who was sneaking around my front porch at that hour, so I plugged it into a old laptop that I was about to trash and opened the file.

I wish I hadn’t opened the file.

I seemed innocuous at first. “Alton1013.mov” looked like a home video of a sandy-haired boy of about six. I assumed his parents had recorded it, but quickly saw two people who were clearly his father and mother in the background. Within less than a minute, I was struck by the odd fact no one in the video acknowledged the cameraman; it was as though they were being filmed unknowingly. 

I installed a Ring camera that afternoon. I live alone and was thoroughly creeped out, but there was nothing I could report to the police. What could I say – that I was upset the anonymous porn turned out to have a child, but no sex?

I tried to sleep that night. The damn baby crying next door made things difficult, which was odd, because I’d never heard a baby there before. 

Which meant that I was awake for the Ring notification. 

I couldn’t tell who it was, but it was obvious from the footage that they’d left something on the doorstep. I regretted the last time I dove into such a “gift,” but do you think I learned from previous experience?

Not having learned from previous experience, I headed to my front door. I didn’t turn on any lights, because I felt certain that the night visitor would be watching me. So I stalked through my apartment, hyperaware of how loud my own breathing was while all other sensory input had vanished.

My head trembled as I lifted my eye to the peephole. 

The porch was empty. At least, the part I could see was empty. 

I placed my hand on the knob and pulled.

The memory stick lay between my feet. 

I sat on my couch and stared at it for ten minutes in the dark. I didn’t want to turn on any lights, there was nothing to report to the police, I don’t have any friends here in this new city for me to stay with, and I couldn’t sleep knowing that the unopened file was in my apartment.

The night visitor had known exactly what I was going to do. I suppose I always had as well, but it took some time for me to accept it.

This video was darker than the first. 

The boy was crying, *sobbing*, as great globs of snot poured from his nose. Most people can tell the difference between “pouty crying” and “terrified crying,” because kids aren’t good actors. This was the latter. He couldn’t move very far, since his wrists were tied to a metal pole. His parents were nowhere in sight. 

I thought about calling the police at this point, but had no believable explanation for how the videos had come into my possession. The best-case scenario would be that this whole incident amounted to nothing. The worst-case scenario was that this was a crime in which I was the only suspect.

I didn’t call the police. 

The third memory stick came while I was at work. I’m pretty sure that the night visitor knew I’d been waiting for him, and changed the drop-off time as a direct result.

This delivery only had still photos. The boy was not in any of them. Every picture was of me. Walking to my car, grocery shopping, cooking with my new kitchen knives (this photo was taken from outside my apartment’s window). I recalled every moment, but didn’t remember anyone taking pictures. After spending the next two hours wracking my brain for any possible culprits, I came up empty-handed.

I didn’t sleep that night.

I installed a second camera that faced the porch from a different angle; I was determined to figure out who this was. Of course, that meant I was on my porch for a good half hour that evening, and the person must have seen me. 

I came inside to find a newspaper article wedged beneath my kitchen window.

The story had been published earlier that day. The boy was missing. His name was Liam.

A photo of his distraught parents accompanied the text. They were the two people from the first video.

I knew two things: this person was always three steps ahead of me, and it was time to move out of my apartment. I decided to leave most of my belongings in place; if I was seen packing, the night visitor would know what I was doing. At best, they’d follow me back to square one. At worst, they’d get violent.

So I closed the blinds and packed in the dark. I didn’t know where I was going to go, and that seemed the best way to stay safe from my visitor. 

The sun was rising on my second morning without sleep. Dream and shadow danced with one another, fraying the edges of reality. Around dawn, I grabbed a duffel bag and backpack before opening my bedroom door. 

A memory stick was in the hallway. 

I snatched it and fell to a seated position on the floor. I really, *really* didn’t want to see what was on it. 

But not knowing was worse, so I scrambled to grab the laptop from my backpack. My hands trembled so hard that I almost couldn’t get the stick into the USB slot.

It was worse than I could have imagined.

Liam was dead. Far too many of his internal organs were on the floor next to his face, which was frozen in a permanent scream. 

I couldn’t hold back from scrolling through the pictures. I was unable to move my mouth fast enough to tell myself to stop.

Subsequent photos were even closer and more intimate. I could see the lines in the wood grain as Liam stood, afraid and uncertain, before my front door. In the pic, he was alive and whole.

The next photo was taken just a few inches from the agonized gawk of Liam’s corpse. A crimson blade reflected a thick coating of fresh blood. 

I looked closer to see that the knife had been stolen from my new kitchen set. 

I raised my eyes to see an object a few inches farther down the semi-dark hallway. Unable to control my own actions, I reached for it.

Something plopped to the floor from inside wrapped newspaper clippings. It rolled to a stop against my knee. I grabbed it and felt the soft, yielding touch of human contact.

It was a severed finger. The skin was still warm. 

There’s enough evidence to remove all reasonable doubt that I killed Liam, so I can’t tell the police. I can’t tell *any*body. I’d beg for help, but this is clearly a trap with no way out. So consider this my last will and testament. This road was always built to go off a cliff.
