I don’t really know how to start this. I’ve never posted like this before, but tonight—after someone told my memories like they were theirs—I needed to get it out.

My brother Eli died in a car crash about a year ago and I haven’t really talked about it much to anyone. I just haven’t wanted to. 

My parents have been on my case about going to counseling. They said I’m bottling everything up and “festering”, as my mom put it. 

Eventually they presented an ultimatum: Go to therapy or pack my shit and find somewhere else to live.

I wasn’t exactly ready for that kind of independence just yet. 

Seeing as how my options for living somewhere else were next to none, I swallowed my pride and went.

And yeah, I expected it to suck because how could it not? 

A bunch of strangers bawling their eyes out into tissues while everyone sits around in awkward silence drinking bad coffee sounds like anybody’s personal hell. 

What I was not expecting was for everyone in the room to already know my backstory, more specifically…who my brother was.

You see, they knew things…personal details and memories that only I and I alone should know. 

Maybe I’m reading too much into it, after all, I’ve only been to one session, but what happened tonight is still sitting heavy in my chest.

Just…read this and tell me if I’m overreacting.


No one met my eyes when I walked in and took a seat in the only remaining cheap folding chair.

The smell of instant coffee gone stale faintly hung in the air as the bulbs of the overhead lights buzzed softly, flickering and dying every few seconds. 

Every part of that community center room grated on my nerves as I waited for the session to begin.

There were seven of us total that sat in a loose circle in tense silence, not counting the facilitator.

The facilitator was a gentle-looking woman named Jean with gray-streaked hair and a voice like chamomile tea —warm, but distant.

“Why don’t we introduce ourselves again,” Jean said. “Since we have a new face.”

They went around the room, each person giving their name and a tense sentence in quick succession.

“I’m Greg. My brother was fatally shot three times.”

“I’m Mark. My little brother died in a boating accident.”

“I’m Lillian. I lost mine to leukemia.” She smiled as if remembering something she liked. 

That’s how it went, each sentence hung in the air like ghosts—present, but weightless. 

I kept waiting for someone to joke, to make this whole thing feel normal in the slightest, but no one did.

When it was my turn, my voice trembled with emotion, but I spoke as clearly as I could.

“I lost my brother…in a car crash…”

I said the words, “He was eleven,” and immediately, I was back in that living room. 

It wasn’t supposed to be anything more than a quick drive, twenty minutes tops. I almost went, but Eli begged and told Dad that we should try the new pizza place across town on Sycamore Ave because he wanted that large pepperoni with extra ham he had seen on TV.

I remember Eli wearing that ugly yellow t-shirt with a faded cartoon dinosaur on it. It had a stain the size of a quarter by the collar and a hole under the arm. He always wore that damn thing—to bed, to the grocery store to Mr. Carter’s soccer practice, it didn’t matter.

Dad caved in and let him tag along while I stayed behind and played video games with my friends. 

It should have been me…that’s the part I can’t shake.

Jean nodded. “Thank you.” She gave that thin, polite smile people use when they want you to think you’re brave.

She started writing in the notebook in front of her, the pen dancing line after line until she caught me staring and quickly shut it.

Nobody else in the group reacted to what I had said, they simply moved on like we were reading grocery lists.

I wondered if they were all just as numb as I was to the trauma. 

Maybe that’s how this all worked. Maybe grief doesn’t fade, it just gets quieter until you forget you’re still listening.

I remember playing Xbox when my mom screamed from the kitchen. The phone slipped out of her hand and hit the floor with a quick thud. 

She didn’t have to say anything, I already knew, and it felt like my world was coming down. 

Something in the way she spoke the word “accident” broke me in half emotionally as it left her mouth. 

I just sat there motionless staring at the colors that bled into each other on the TV screen, hearing her sob into the phone as if the game would un-pause reality.

“Lucas?…Lucas?” Jean’s voice pulled me halfway back, and it took a second to register that she was saying my name.

I was still staring at my controller as it vibrated against the floor until the person to my left nudged me and I snapped back to the present.

“Yes?” I asked, trying my best to pretend I was all right.

“It’s time to share a memory, Mark is about to start.” Jean informed me with a look sharp enough to silence a scream.

The guy who nudged me introduced himself as Mark. He cleared his throat and shifted forward in his chair, the legs dragging across the floor with a shrill squeak. 

As he spoke, his fingernails tapped against his thigh — tap-tap-tap-pause-tap, over and over. I assumed it was a nervous tic, but the rhythm burrowed into my skull like it was trying to knock on something I’d forgotten.

“He had this ratty green hoodie that he wouldn’t take off for anything, not even in the summer. You would think that it was surgically attached to him or something.” He laughed nervously as his eyes met everyone else’s. “He claimed that it was ‘lucky’ and had special powers. It had this little tear under the left elbow where he wiped out on his bike from going downhill too fast.”

When Mark mentioned the hoodie, I saw the wreckage of the crash all over again. 

I remember the paramedics cutting through it with precision, the blood turning the fabric stiff, and the torn sleeve caught in the door. 

I felt myself hyperventilating as I pressed my palms against my knees and did my best to stay quiet. 

I was trying to keep it together, to be strong, but that never stops the images. It never does.

I wanted to say something, and I almost did, but by the time I caught my breath, Mark was already done.

Jean thanked him with a smile before moving on to Lillian.

Before she could speak, the sound of an incoming call interrupted the session.

The sound came from Mark’s pocket and for a few fleeting seconds, “All Apologies” by Nirvana played.

Under the chords, I could’ve sworn I heard Eli humming along, like he was sitting beside me just for a fraction of a second.

“Sorry, that was just my folks.” Mark apologized and silenced his phone. 

What seemed like such an inconsequential moment made me shiver slightly.

Nirvana was one of his favorite bands and “All Apologies” was especially important to him as it was one of the first songs he learned how to play on guitar.

My chest loosened a small bit as Lillian began speaking.

“My brother, he used to eat orange popsicles. Even during the winter season, he craved them like nothing else.” She spoke with a soft, nostalgic smile tugging at the edges of her mouth. “He had this weird habit of calling them ‘sun sticks’. I don’t know why, he just made it up one day and it stuck.”

Eli called them “sun sticks” because he said it was like holding sunshine. 

Mom kept a box in the freezer year-round because he would devour them all the time, even in winter. 

I could still see his face, his numb tongue sticking out through his orange-stained lips, laughing like brain freezes didn’t apply to him.

But then, the smell of iron hit my nostrils sharply, like blood sucked from a split lip. 

I swallowed hard, trying not to gag as the back of my throat tasted exactly the way it had that night when I inhaled the scent of metal and the lingering dust from the deployed airbags.

The car was a twisted red husk of itself in the lot. The cracks in the windshield spiderwebbed all around and the passenger side was crushed like a soda can. 

“Clover”, the fluffy, stuffed rabbit Eli won at a carnival was still in the back seat. 

I couldn’t help but notice that his blue converse shoes were missing as well. I remember asking everyone where they were, like that was the important part.

They were gone.

The passenger door was clenched shut like a fist. I remember the paramedics prying the door open, their hands slick with something bright, the hoodie snagged on the frame.

The sharp, nauseating scent of gasoline and metal hit me like punch to the gut.

Could anybody else smell this?

I glanced around but no one else seemed to notice, their faces were of a blank, neutral expression…except for Greg’s.

I thought he had dozed off in his chair, but his eyes were locked onto me. I couldn’t tell if he was trying to read something off my face or not.

I pretended not to notice, but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t slightly rattle me.

These memories, they didn’t just sound familiar…they sounded like they were talking about Eli and not their loved ones.

I tried to rationalize everything in silence in the hopes that I could convince myself that maybe these were all just creepy coincidences.

Even so, I declined to share a memory of myself and Eli due to feeling uncomfortable. 

“I’m not ready yet.” was my excuse.

Thankfully, no one pressured me, but I remember Jean gave me that same soft smile from earlier, her eyes lingering on me for a second too long, like she was remembering something I hadn’t said yet.

I wasn’t entirely sure what to make of that but regardless, I started listening harder to every story told.

Every memory shared felt like I was looking into a broken mirror from different angles, but with the same pieces staring back at me.

What eats me alive isn’t that Eli died that night, it’s that I didn’t. 

Every time I close my eyes, I see the empty seat where I should’ve been, and I wonder if maybe I did die, if maybe this is just what it feels like to keep going in a life that wasn’t meant for me anymore.

That’s all I could think about as I stared at the floor.

I wasn’t sure how long I had my head down looking at the tile, but I saw a coffee stain near my chair that I hadn’t noticed before. 

It looked vaguely like a…rabbit?

I remember when mom dropped a tray of brownies on the kitchen floor while we were sitting on the couch in the living room watching TV. 

He told me I nearly jumped out of my skin and ever since then, he would give me shit for being such a scaredy cat. 

That’s when Eli christened me with the nickname “Rabbit” a while back because I would always jump at loud noises. 

Seeing that coffee stain in the exact shape of a rabbit made my stomach plummet. 

This wasn’t just a stain anymore, this was something that knew the nickname Eli gave me, turning a private memory into a violation.

I told myself I was imagining things… but the longer I stared, the more it looked less like a rabbit and more like a body lying twisted on the pavement.

I glanced up in perfect silence just as everyone else did the same. It was like we’d all been given the same invisible cue that the session had concluded. 

For a second, I felt like I could feel Greg’s eyes watching me from a distance, but then, just like that, the sensation was gone.

I told myself it was nothing, but the rabbit-shaped stain wouldn’t let me go.

It shouldn’t have bothered me as much as it did.

As I was about to leave like everyone else had, I turned back to see all the empty chairs, except one. 

Mark sat there, looking down at his hands.

I had to blink twice before I realized what he was holding. 

It was a green hoodie—same color, same tear under the elbow. 

It looked just like Eli’s. 

Still damp, like it had just been pulled from the wreck…


I’m home now. I threw my clothes in the laundry and took the hottest shower I could stand, hoping that it would calm my nerves.

Unfortunately, it didn’t.

I keep telling myself I imagined it, that it wasn’t Eli’s hoodie. But if it wasn’t…then why did it have the tear under the elbow? I mean, maybe a lot of hoodies rip there. 

Maybe I just wanted it to be his. 

I don’t know anymore.

Sorry for the rambling, I know this reads like I’m just some lunatic connecting dots that aren’t there inside the wreckage of my trauma. 

Maybe that’s exactly what it is. 

But I can’t shake the feeling that something followed me home, something I can’t entirely explain or write off. 

It’s not even that I believe in ghosts or whatever—I don’t. I really don’t, but I can’t stop looking at the laundry basket in the corner because I expect to see Eli’s hoodie to be sitting in there, still wet from the accident.

Maybe everything can just be considered coincidence because Eli couldn’t have been the only one in this zip code, let alone the world who has a hoodie of that color. 

Orange popsicles can’t be all that uncommon to like and enjoy year-round. 

Nirvana is a piece of pop culture so of course their music is going to be everywhere.

But…I didn’t tell them about Eli’s hoodie, the popsicles, or that song.

They just knew somehow? 

Like “sun sticks”? That was ours. 

How can people just know memories that only you have experienced?

There’s another session next week. I think I’m going. 

Not because I want to—Christ, I really don’t.

My only reasoning for going back is that I need to understand what the hell is going on.

God, I just want my brother back. That’s all. 

If it’s him in that room, even in some fucked-up way, I don’t know if I should be terrified or grateful.

Next week, I’m going to test them. 

I’ll invent a memory about Eli on the spot, something no one else could possibly know. 

If someone else claims it happened, then I’ll know for sure. 

This isn’t just grief. 

It’s something else.

If they share another memory that was never theirs…I’ll post again.
