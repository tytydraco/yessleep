June
Something is rotting the back deck. Something is stunting the garden, all the strawberries shrivel before they’re even ripe. Something is melting the siding. 

July
At night I hear the breath of the house. It’s not summer air from open windows. The walls heave in and push out, rattling, struggling. At night I hear a sick and smokey breath.

September 
Something is chipping the counter tops. Something is darkening the tiles, sticky and sweet in the grout. Something is moulding the new groceries.

October 
I’m terrified of staying here, I think it’ll kill me, it knows I’m trying to leave. Screaming “this is the house you grew up in, this is the house where you die” louder and louder until my tears hit the floor and it’s as if there was never a sound at all. 

November 
Something warping all of my mirrors. Something is pulling on my bathroom door, begging and pleading to catch me off guard. Something is clogging my sink.

December
All my friends are texting me but my phone keeps dying and my car keys are constantly misplaced. I don’t know what to do I feel like I’m losing my mind. Why haven’t the neighbours noticed, i can understand not say anything about the state of the house but don’t you smell the death aren’t you listening cant you hear the grinding cant you hear the screams cant you??

January 
Something is always just behind me. Something is under my skin, turning my blood sludgy and brown. Something wants me all to itself.

March
Does anyone know a good exorcist and a lawyer? Something is in that house and it wants to be in my head. Something is something is something is I think something is wrong
