If there’s one thing a teenager loves it’s having the house all to themselves. Such was my case. My parents were to spend the weekend at my maternal grandparents’ place for my Grandma’s birthday. I was supposed to go too and told them I needed to catch up on some homework. That wasn’t entirely a lie.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was just that I didn’t have as much to do as I said I did. In my defense, what sixteen-year-old is going to pass that up? Don’t get me wrong, I loved my grandparents, but god damn their house was boring as hell. I can tolerate reminiscent stories of someone’s youth for a couple hours. An entire weekend of it, though was beyond what I could handle.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Not to mention, there was always that thrift store smell whenever I went over there which was weird because they never mentioned shopping at one. Little did I know, I would have egg on my face because staying home alone would lead to the most terrifying night of my life. It was Friday afternoon and I’d just gotten off the bus. When I walked in, my parents were already downstairs with their suitcases.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“There you are, Hector. We’ve been waiting for you to get back so we could leave.,” my mom scolded

&#x200B;

“Yeah, sorry, traffic bottlenecked on the ride home,” I replied.

&#x200B;

“Just don’t forget to do what we told you,” my dad said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

While they were away, I was to handle the household chores. This was a small price to pay for some peace and quiet. Plus it wasn’t as if I was planning on having any ragers since my friends were all busy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I won’t.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They left and I went straight into the kitchen, grabbed some Root Beer and Chips, then went back into the living room and plopped onto the couch. I figured I could handle doing the chores tomorrow which would have been a breeze if not for the horse shit I had to deal with. I did do my homework while watching Cartoon Network so I was at least somewhat productive. I watched a few shows on Adult Swim before growing bored and deciding to switch inputs so I could play some games. As I did, the batteries gave out which stopped the tv on the local channels and the news happened to be on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Annoyed, I got up to rummage through a kitchen drawer. While doing this, I overheard what the anchor was saying.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“This most recent disappearance marks a string of many in the Pine Spring area within the last two weeks. So far, the police have no leads and are strongly encouraging residents to stay inside and not go out after dark.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Not thinking much of it, I got a fresh pair of batteries and used them to replace the dead ones in the remote. Then I booted up my Wii. I’d been meaning to get around to playing Metroid Prime so I popped it in. The hours flew by and I managed to save before falling asleep. Waking up the next day, I yawned, then brushed some chips off my shirt, got up, and stretched.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My parents would be getting home by noon on Sunday so I had the day to do chores. I put on some Nickledoean and then did the dishes. After expending a fuckon of elbow grease I finally finished them and loaded the dishwasher. The phone rang with my dad’s number.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey, Dad,” I said

&#x200B;

“Hey, Hector,” my dad replied, “Your mother wanted me to call and make sure you’re alright.”

&#x200B;

“I’m fine. Why does she think I can’t handle being by myself?”

&#x200B;

“You know how she is, so have you been doing good? Your grandpa’s been giving me the stinkeye since we got here.”

&#x200B;

“Sounds rough.”

&#x200B;

“Yeah, I just hope we don’t get into it. Anyway, how have you been?”

&#x200B;

“Alright, I just got done with the dishes.”

&#x200B;

“Good, keep at it. Oh, and trash pick up is tomorrow so don’t forget to wheel it to the curb.”

&#x200B;

“Got it, later, Dad.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We told each other goodbye and then I hung up and resumed doing chores. By sunset, I was through with most of them and felt that I deserved a break and got back to Metroid Prime. As an aside, that game gets confusing as hell and I had to consult a walkthrough multiple times while playing. I had made it to  Phendrana Drifts and gotten the Wave Beam when My stomach growled. In the mood for pasta, I paused my game, then put a pot of water to heat up on the stove for some spaghetti, and then turned on the oven for some garlic bread.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was about to resume playing when suddenly there was a knock on the door. My parents never mentioned I’d be getting any visitors.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I went over and replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hello?” I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

From the other side, I heard someone say in a deep voice. “Ho! Ho! Ho! It’s me, Santa Claus. I’ve come to give you your presents!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Confused because it was the middle of January, I responded that I wasn’t expecting any and told them that they must have the wrong house. They didn’t reply so I thought that was the end of the matter.  An hour later, I remembered that I’d forgotten to grab the mail and paused my game to retrieve it. Going to our mailbox, I grabbed the envelopes from within and was about head back inside. That’s when I saw him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I heard a hiss and whipped my head up, surprised to see someone standing on the roof. Staring down at me with eyes glowing yellow as the moon, pale skin, and a grin full of pearl-white sharp teeth with two fangs was something I only thought existed in movies and stories. It was a goddamned vampire. I didn’t register this immediately as I was busy trying not to shit myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In Batman-like fashion, he leaped off the roof, gliding straight for me. Luckily, my legs were faster than my brain and I ran out of the way, causing the vampire to faceplant into a street lamp and fall to the pavement. He was back up almost instantly and I ran back to my house with him giving chase. I felt the breeze on the back of my neck from him trying to grab me before making it back inside, then slamming my door and locking it.

&#x200B;

My breathing was rapid and no matter what I did I couldn’t calm myself down. I couldn’t believe it. On top of vampires apparently being real, one was trying to kill me. Why he wanted me specifically, I have no idea.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Let me in,” he rasped from outside, scratching at the door.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My throat went dry and I hoped he would just go away. When he didn’t say anything else, I realized I was holding my breath and exhaled. I knew some things about vampires such as they can’t enter a home without permission which meant I was safe. Beeping coming from the kitchen made me jump before I remembered I set the timer. Scolding myself and making a mental note not to be out after dark for the foreseeable future I turned it off.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Pacing back and forth in the kitchen, I was trying to decide what to do. The most obvious course of action would be to call the cops. However, somehow I didn’t think they’d take a teenager calling about a vampire seriously. Then again I could leave that part out. The problem with that, though would be how exactly would they be able to help?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Last I checked they weren’t carrying garlic spray and silver bullets. I’d heard somewhere that vampires are also weak to running water which would have been a viable option if it weren’t already well into winter. Of all the homes in the neighborhood, he had to pick mine. I needed to calm myself down. My friend, Connor lived pretty close by and I thought I'd give him a call.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Yo, Hector, what's up, man?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In the background, I could hear him playing Halo. I explained to him that my parents were away.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"My folks are away too, some kind of work thing, so what have you been doing?"

&#x200B;

"Just watching TV and playing games mostly. I've finally gotten around to Metroid Prime."

&#x200B;

"Cool, hey, guess who I have coming over?"

&#x200B;

"Beats me."

&#x200B;

"Sydney."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That was the name of the most popular girl at our school.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"For real?" I asked.

&#x200B;

"Yep, and I got a little something in my shoebox to share with her if you catch my drift."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I gave him a sharp whistle.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Good on you."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Are you fucking kidding me? He pulls the hottest girl in school and meanwhile, I'm stuck dealing with this shit.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Connor must've noticed something off in my tone.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Is something the matter? Don't tell me you're jealous," he said slightly smug.

&#x200B;

"No," I scoffed, "Okay maybe a little, but this is about something else."

&#x200B;

"Are you having problems with Butch again?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Butch was the most fierce bully in our school. While he'd break the nose of just about anyone for looking at him wrong, for some reason he always signaled me out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"If you are I'll fucking roll up. I got the bat. You know I'm good."

&#x200B;

"No, I mean not lately."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was trying to think of how to explain my situation to him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Let's say, hypothetically you were dealing with a…"

&#x200B;

"Vampire?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was taken aback.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"How did you know?"

&#x200B;

"One tried to jump me on my way home from the gas station, but I gave them the slip. What about you?"

&#x200B;

"There is one outside as we speak.  Wait, you're going to have Sydney over with one after you?"

&#x200B;

"It's not like they know where I live."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I rolled my eyes and continued.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Anyway, one almost got me when I went to get the mail. I need to know if you have any tips for me."

&#x200B;

"I mean you should be good as long as you stay inside, right?"

&#x200B;

"Yeah, but he seems to have it out for me. I need to find a way to get rid of him."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A harrowing thought entered my head.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Wait, shit, the trash."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If I didn't have it out for pick up tomorrow, my parents would kill me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Dude, you're seriously more worried about that?"

&#x200B;

"Obviously not, but you've seen my mom's bad side."

&#x200B;

"Point taken. Hang on, I hear my doorbell. That's probably her."

&#x200B;

"Wait, what about me?"

&#x200B;

"I don't know man. Try garlic or something."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As soon as the phone call ended, there was another knock on the door. Instantly, I was on edge. Cautiously, I approached.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Who is it?" I hesitantly asked.

&#x200B;

"Pizza," I heard someone reply in a gruff voice.

&#x200B;

"I didn't order any."

&#x200B;

"It's on the house."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At the mention of free pizza, my apprehension dissipated. I opened the door to see someone in a Papa John’s uniform and jacket. They had gloves on and their hat was pulled down to cover their face. In his hands were two extra large pizzas.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"They're kind of heavy," he said. "Why don't you invite me in so I can bring them inside for you?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I nearly said yes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Wait a minute…" I replied, narrowing my eyes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I snatched his hat off, revealing the now hissing vampire. With a scream, I backed away, throwing the hat at the vampire.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"No, I was so close," the vampire screeched.

&#x200B;

"Will you get out of here?" I yelled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dropping the pizza boxes, he hissed, turned into a bat, and flew away. With a sinking feeling, I knew that the delivery driver he stole the clothes and pizza from most likely wasn't alive anymore. When I was sure he was gone, I looked down at the boxes. Free food would be one positive to this experience. I took them in and set them on the kitchen counter.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Lifting the lids, I was dismayed to find them covered in anchovies and pineapple. I wondered what sick bastards ordered them. Something in the corners of both boxes drew my attention. It was two containers of garlic sauce. This gave me an idea and I grabbed them before throwing the pizza away.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

First, I needed to make dinner. Since the water was now rapidly boiling, I dropped the pasta inside followed by putting the garlic loaf into the oven.  We had some leftover lemon pepper chicken from the other night which I incorporated into the pesto sauce. As I cooked I began forming a plan to take care of the trash. It wasn't going to be easy, though. When the food was done, I grabbed a spray bottle from under the sink.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I filled it with water and garlic sauce, then grabbed half the loaf of garlic bread, taking a bite. My parents kept a Bible in their room. However, since I wasn't very religious, I wasn't sure how effective it would be. Steeling myself, I got ready to head outside. With luck, maybe the vampire decided to bother someone else.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was only one way to find out. I opened the door and stepped out, carrying the garbage. So far so good. I kept in the shadows to be more innocuous and managed to reach the trash. Dropping the bags in, I was surprised I made it that far without any issues. That didn't mean I was going to lower my guard. Dropping the bags in, I started wheeling the trash bin to the curb.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All the while, I was constantly looking over my shoulder. Finally, I heard the wheels roll onto the sidewalk. I actually did it. Something cracked against the side of my face and I screamed, dropping the garlic bread and spray. Then there was a familiar obnoxious laugh.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Hey, dipshit, I heard your parents were away," Butch said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In his hands was a carton of eggs which were rotten based on the smell.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Butch, can we not do this right now?" I pleaded. "I'm just trying to take care of the garbage."

&#x200B;

"That's funny, same here" he replied, throwing another egg.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I managed to dodge it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Don't you have anything better to do?" I snapped, knowing full well the answer to that question.

&#x200B;

"Fucking with you is too much fun."

&#x200B;

"Yeah, and I bet your dad will have fun with you when you get home."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Instantly, Butch's laughing stopped and I knew I made a mistake. His dad left him and his mom when he was little so it was a sore spot for him. With an animalistic growl, he threw the egg carton to the ground and balled his hands into fists.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"What the fuck did you just say?" he asked, glaring down at me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I stammered out my response.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Maybe I should have worded that better. What I meant to say was…"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I bolted. Despite his size, Butch was incredibly fast and able to keep up with me. He yelled that he was going to pound my face into a bloody pulp and caught me in a flying tackle. Grunting from the impact and his weight on my chest, I could only stare up at his sadistic smile.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I'm going to enjoy this," he said, cracking his knuckles.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He raised a massive fist. Behind him, a figure loomed, making my rapidly beating heart stop.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Butch…" I wheezed.

&#x200B;

"Shut the fuck up."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Right before he could hit me, the vampire grabbed him by the neck.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"What the hell?" he asked, trying to get free.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was no use. The vampire's inhuman strength allowed him to easily lift Butch with one arm. Then it tossed him aside. He was never one to quit while he was ahead and got right back to his feet.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I don't who the fuck you think you are, but nobody messes with…"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I saw his expression change with the realization he was messing with the wrong person. The vampire only grinned back at him. In one fell swoop, the vampire was on him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Get off," he screamed in vain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I did not wait to see what happened and tried running for my front door. Luckily I had the foresight to unlock it before heading out. Unfortunately, the vampire was already done with Butch who fell back with his eyes still open. The vampire turned its attention back to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Stay back," I warned, trying to raise my spray bottle only to come up with an empty hand.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Shit," I said, glancing at the bread and bottle on the sidewalk.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I tried fleeing to no avail. The vampire was much faster than me and cut me off at every turn. As he backed me away, we ended up in the street and I tripped, falling back. I was exhausted and felt like a fish in a tank with a cat hovering over it. My fate was sealed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I promise this won't hurt…Much," the vampire said, opening his mouth wide.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Just then there was the revving of an engine accompanied by headlights. The vampire was struck by a truck head-on and hit the asphalt. Connor got out. Cuts were on his face and a wooden stake was in his hand. Before I could ask him what happened, he stormed past me. The vampire was still dazed and he didn't let that opportunity go to waste.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He brought down the dagger, driving it straight into the vampire's chest. He could only let out a pained croak as Connor brought up his leg. With mad fury in his eyes, he slammed his foot down on the stake, driving it all the way in. The vampire screeched in pain and burst into flames, leaving only a pile of ash. The wind blew it away.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Connor helped me up.

&#x200B;

"Thanks."

&#x200B;

"No problem. Why was that vampire wearing a Papa John's uniform?"

&#x200B;

"I'll explain later. What should we do with him?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Butch was still on the ground. To our surprise, he let out a moan and sat up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Oh shit, he's turning into a vampire," Connor exclaimed.

&#x200B;

"Does that mean we should take him out now?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We silently debated this for a moment before deciding it was too cold to wait that long and headed inside.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"So, mind telling me what all this is about?" I gestured to his face.

&#x200B;

"Yeah, remember how I said that the vampire didn't know where I lived? I was wrong. They got Sydney."

&#x200B;

"Holy shit, are you serious?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Apparently, her parents' car was attacked on the way to his place. By the time she got there, she was already fully transformed. She told him she wanted to invite another friend over. It turned out to be the vampire he encountered earlier.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Good thing I stumbled across that camping gear in the garage or I would've been a goner. Shit's fucked man. I missed out on scoring big time."

&#x200B;

"Hey, at least you got close."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He shrugged.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Have you been cooking something?"

&#x200B;

"Oh yeah, chicken pasta. Want some?"

&#x200B;

"Hell yeah."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We came to find out that facing vampires worked up quite an appetite. Speaking of, someone pounded on the window. It was Butch, now a full-fledged vampire. He was already scary before and this only made him even more terrifying.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Let me in," he growled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Connor and I looked at each other, then grabbed our things and went upstairs with Butch still hollering at us. Out of sight out of mind. Soon, after I changed clothes, we forgot about him while playing Co-op on Borderlands 2.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Wow, it's already dawn."

&#x200B;

"Jeez, I didn't know we were up that long."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We grabbed our dishes and took them downstairs.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"And then after I turn you inside out, I'm going to use your bones to pick my teeth," Butch yelled.

&#x200B;

"Has he really been out here all night?" Connor asked.

&#x200B;

"Looks like it."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The first rays of sunlight peeked over the houses. If there was a vampire Darwin award, he would get first prize. The moment the light hit him, his skin sizzled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"What the fuck?" he screamed before also bursting into flames.

&#x200B;

"Well, guess that's that," Connor said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My parents arrived at the same time the garbage pickup came. They were annoyed to see Connor with me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Hector, we didn't say you could have anyone over," my mom scolded.

&#x200B;

"You never said I couldn't either."

&#x200B;

"Don't get smart with me."

&#x200B;

"It's fine," Connor interjected. "We've just been hanging out and I was about to leave anyway. Later, Hector."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I gave him a wave and then he left. Although my parents were upset with me, they were too tired to fully care. Luckily I haven't had another experience like that since then. I never go out at night alone and I always make sure the trash bin is wheeled out the day, not the night, before pickup. Both habits I still repeat to this day even though I've long since moved towns and thankfully my parents have too. Better safe than sorry.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don't know where those vampires came from. I only hope none ever make their way to where I live now. Connor and I keep in touch and still hang out occasionally. When we do, we always make sure to [have](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) extra [garlic.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)
