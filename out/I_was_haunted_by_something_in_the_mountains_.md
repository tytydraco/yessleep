I almost barfed just from the sight. 

I cover my mouth trying to hold down my lunch. 

It ate them. 

It ate all of them. 

My friends were gone...
I start to cry softly. 

Ok. Ok I need to calm down. 

I walk back to my previous hiding spot. I wait and wait. 

Then I hear the walking, he sounds like any ordinary person on a midnight stroll, except I know better than to trust that. 

This thing has been stalking me and my friends and it ends tonight. Though it wasn't that long ago that it had started, I knew better than to think of it as a mere human, no way in hell.
I sigh as it walks past me. 

Ok maybe the ending tonight thing was a little too frivolous of thinking. 

I need to get out of here before I became this things mid night snack. 

I look back to Tianas open dead eyes staring up at the moon. I suddenly wish I could've done more, hell I wish I could go grab her right now and run back. If I did so, I knew it would be the end of me. 

I couldn't have this I needed to run. 

Yes that's what this was a need. 
Not a want. I wasn't running away because I wanted to but because I needed too. 

The vision of Tianas lifeless eyes plow through my thoughts. The guilt creeps in. I know she asked for a fun little hike and picnic not a slow painful hike and being hunted by a thing that looked like a man but was too tall to truly be one. 
Whatever this turned into non of us was aware it was ever a possibility.

My friends all split up hours ago to do different things of course I went with my crush to find a lake.

 Who wouldn't.

I sigh at my stupid decisions, I swear I make the worst of them.
We had seen the thing this morning that's when all hell broke loose. 

I heard my friend Jake screaming and I thought he was pranking me but no he was headless when I found him so no joke were to be found. Probably ever again actually. 

Then jasper and when I found him his legs were missing horribly torn off and he had passed out from the pain by the time I got there. 

I was too scared to move him though so I put something over him instead. I doubt it did any good that thing knew where he was. 

There was no reception on my phone out here in the middle of no where. 
No wifi, no phone calls..

Mountains, caves, water all beautiful and all things I crave but today I was terrified of it. I wanted nothing other than civilization, I miss the loud metropolian people going about their days to remind me that I was also a person just like them. 

All I felt like right now was helpless prey, food. 
That's it, I was guilt ridden.

 This thing was like body part hunting or something. It was like playing build a bear but with people's limbs, in a creepy cave workshop or something. Why did it take legs and heads. That's when I heard my oldest friend Jen screaming I ran as fast as I could, towards the sound. 

I could feel the dirt under my nails the scrapping of the dirt on my boots.

I never felt fast enough, even if I was?

 what would I do when I met the thing face to face?

I got my answer, 

I ran up quietly behind some large trees and up ahead, was its back as it walked away from Jens mutilated body. She was left for dead missing both arms, she had probably bled out in seconds. 

I hid in a deep crevasse of the tree waiting and watching. 

The scene before me brought no comfort but right now I had to be logical and tactical which basically just meant wait and hide until the threat doesn't know you're there anymore. 

So I did that waiting. Of course my last and only friend had to come running to help. My crush for three years now. Her beautiful golden locks falling around her face as she screamed and cried over Jens lifeless body. 

I had to whisper to her. "Hey shh, come here" 

She looked over to me with her teary sad big blue eyes and I felt my heart break. 

Then I heard the giant footsteps and I saw Tiana look over to the origin spot of the sounds in awe. 

That's when I knew this was it. There was nothing I could do.

Right? 

It walked out from behind a giant tree and it swiped at her she started screaming again running around wildly, falling and stumbling.

It swatted at her with it's long nailed hands.

I felt my stomach sour. Please Tiana run. I was rooting for her.

I heard a loud gross crack and thud. I couldn't see what was happening from here until I saw her body come flying right in front the giant tree, that I was in.

Her torso was missing. She was cut entirely in half.

I almost barfed and screamed but I clapped my hand over my mouth breathing loudly into my palms trying to calm myself.

It was just me now.

It was just me now.

It was just me now.

The memory of this event has changed my perspective on life. 

On humanity, on the world and the creatures that live amongst us without us even knowing.

I typed the last word out, right as my friend came in.

"Hey, how've you been." I smile at her, "I've been, ok" I felt my happiness at finally allowing myself to make another friend.

It's been 10 years since the attack, but everyone still thought I was nothing more than a traumatized, paranoid, PTSD, riddled girl with low self esteem issues.

While they aren't entirely wrong, I think that my life in rehabilitation gets better, day by day.
