 The excitement of Halloween filled the air as the sun went down. In the park by my house, there was this scarecrow that always showed up during this spooky time. It usually just stood there, looking kinda creepy but not moving, with its clothes all neat and clean.

But this year, something weird happened. As I walked over, I noticed the scarecrow acting differently. Its gaze, which used to be stuck on the swings, now shifted to the slide. The bright blue eyes that usually caught everyone's attention were now faded and lifeless. And its arms, which were always fine, looked kinda discolored and skinny compared to before.

My friends used to tell stories about this scarecrow moving every 20 years, but I never believed them. It sounded like a made-up thing with no proof.

But then, as I kept watching TV later that day, there was a knock on my door. It was around 7 pm, which is when kids usually go trick or treating. I opened the door and found two kids one dressed as Elsa and the other as Darth Vader. As it got later, more kids came by for treats.

But something strange was happening. When one family was leaving, I saw the scarecrow take a few steps and turn its head towards my house. I got a bit freaked out and quickly shut the door. My heart was racing as I realized the scarecrow was getting closer.

I couldn't believe it. What my friends said was actually true! It moved. My thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door. I looked through the peephole and saw something so scary that I jumped back. The scarecrow's eyes were red, its shirt turned purple, and its hat was missing.
I locked my door as the knocking continued. Only 3 hours until midnight. I thought maybe I could wait it out. But the knocking got louder and stronger until the door broke down.

I felt like I couldn't breathe. I wanted to hide or something. But my gut feeling told me I had to do something. So, I grabbed the biggest thing I could find, which happened to be a lamp. I went downstairs, shaking all over.

The scarecrow noticed me, and I lunged at it, swinging the lamp as hard as I could. Hay went everywhere, and I thought, "I did it!" Still scared but kind of proud that I took that thing down.

Then, I heard a voice saying, "Wait until next year."

The words sent shivers down my spine. It made me realize that what I thought was just a Halloween story might be real. The scarecrow wasn't just a decoration, it was something else, something that would keep coming back. The spooky promise of more scares hung in the air, leaving me with a feeling that Halloween would never be the same again. As the night unfolded, I couldn't shake off the eerie certainty that the scarecrow's presence had opened a portal to a world where Halloween wasn't just about costumes and candy but a chilling adventure into the unknown, where the thin line between reality and spooky tales blurred in the pale moonlight.
