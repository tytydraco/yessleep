NEED ADVICE. YES, I have tried google but am UNABLE to find anything applicable to my situation. For the past week I have been tormented relentlessly – TARGETED – by a disgusting and EXTREMELY HARD TO KILL black bug. Must be killed TODAY!! Help identify and explain HOW TO REMOVE!!!

Bug looks like an ant or wasp. Size of my palm. 5 body segments. Black but with white dots which LEAK something white. Has wings but does not use them to fly. DOES use them to jump (and high!!). Legs are THICK and HAIRY.

Showed up one week ago when MY food began going missing. CONTEXT: I don’t believe in refrigerators. They are a SCAM designed to sucker you into paying extra for UNNECESSARY appliances and energy. I have NEVER gotten sick from meat that has been left out nor have I ever felt the need to ““freeze water”” like you fucking sheep. 

I leave my food in the open where I can access it QUICKLY because I am BUSY. I have had NO PROBLEMS with this until this little BITCH BASTARD decided he was gonna waltz into MY fucking house and eat MY shit!! Ate an ENTIRE box of Chinese leftovers and chewed THROUGH the bag of a doordash order just to eat MY fucking McChicken.

Thought it might have been the neighbors until I HEARD the thing crunching down on a crab rangoon and SAW the fucker. I IMMEDIATELY grabbed a newspaper from the pile but it JUMPED out of the way before I could hit it and I ended up knocking THREE PLATES off the counter which of course BROKE because they’re CHEAP and LAZY!! For the record I am NOT going to clean that up because that is ITS fault and again I am BUSY.

That night I could barley sleep through its fucking crying!! It was WATCHING me when I woke up. Clinging to MY ceiling, dripping its disgusting fluids onto MY face. When I ordered lunch it followed. Watched me, every bite. I watched it too. Dinner was the same. Fucker went to bed hungry that night. THAT was a win. Just made the crying worse though.

The next morning, it wasn’t there. Thought I was FREE for a while. Ordered more burgers. Had them leave it outside because I am BUSY. When I opened up the bag, the bastard JUMPED right past my face and scampered off somewhere under the piles. I fell back and nearly BRAINED myself on the counter.

I looked in the bag and, and. Just crumbs inside. Couldn’t see straight. My breath STOPPED in my throat. My fucking food. MY fucking food. He would pay. He would BURN in HELL for this. BURN IN BUG HELL!!

I came up with a plan. Went out for noodles, got two boxes. While I was out, I went somewhere I’d never been. The grocery store. Bought two boxes of rat killer. Two sets of leftovers. One for me, and one for him. I opened the first box and POURED it over the dish. Flipped the noodles and POURED even more. I used up a whole box. Discarded it onto the piles and stored the other in the cabinet. Just in case.

I went back to my room, and opened my own noodles. I had never waited SO LONG to eat. It was beautiful. I CACKLED to myself between bites picturing how he would SQUIRM and SUFFER.

After only a few bites, I heard the crash from the kitchen. I rushed in to see him WRITHE, but he wasn’t there. The noodles had been overturned. SPILLED EVERYWHERE. WASTED. I saw the trail of white droplets and followed it up to the now open cabinet. There the second box had been ripped to SHREDS. Powder cascaded out from the cabinet and across the floor. 

I returned to my room, somber. He may not have taken the bait, but my food was still here. He would STARVE in time. As long as I got MINE, and he didn’t. I dug back in, fantasizing about what methods I could use next. It wasn’t until the end that I noticed the white dots sprinkled throughout the now empty box, and the tracks of white powder which flanked them.

It was I who writhed in pain that night. Felt like KNIVES were pushing their way out from my stomach through my belly, and chest. I vomited FOUR times at least, and slept for NO TIME at all. Its cry was different that night. Chirping. The bastard was LAUGHING. I know he was. LAUGHING at ME. 

When the sun rose, I MADE my MOVE. I fell out of bed and carried myself towards the source of his cacophony. I SHOVED boxes aside. I KICKED up the trash and OVERTURNED piles, clawing through the scum and rubbish. 

When I found him he FROZE, and for a moment I could see his FEAR. It was the most DELICIOUS food I’d had in WEEKS. I SLAMMED my hand onto the wall where he clung. He dodged, but I followed. As he scurried under boxes and bags I tossed them aside and behind me. I kept pace. I swung with HAND and FOOT and FURY. He tried weaving through the shards of broken plate in the kitchen but I did NOT care. I struck at the shards, cutting my hands to bleeding. I did NOT lose pace.

He was getting TIRED. I could tell. I had him backed into a CORNER. Brought down my hands in a rhythm, as he sidestepped one I CAUGHT him with the other. I heard him CRACK, felt the satisfying CRUNCH of shell on skin. I brought my hands down AGAIN. And AGAIN. I struck with FISTS and CLAWS and HUNGER, until my hands were a bloody mixture of red and white.

When I stopped to look, he was on his back, legs curled above him, his former brilliant black now muted red and white. I dropped to my knees and took a deep breath. I was SHAKING and EXHAUSTED, but I was victorious. MY home, MY life would be MINE again. As I began to rise, another sharp twinge from my stomach caused me to GASP in pain. And in that moment, he righted himself, turned to me, and JUMPED straight into my open mouth.

I fell back. I reached for him, but it was too late. He wriggled his way DEEPER beyond my grasp. I could not breathe so I began to SWALLOW. I swallowed over and over, trying to CRUSH him with my throat. I produced no saliva but I continued DRY. Eventually, I found my breath. I reached for my throat but could not feel him there. Rather, I felt a new pain in my chest, higher this time. Like something was STUCK inside.

Yet another night I spent SLEEPLESS. By that point I could handle the pain, but the CRYING. It felt like it was coming from INSIDE my head. I couldn’t tune it out, I couldn’t shut it off. Since I couldn’t sleep, I ordered food. If I couldn’t rest I could at least eat IN PEACE for once. When it arrived I shoveled it down instantly, I was SO hungry. 

But I CHOKED, I had to cough it up!! Somehow I could only stomach a few bites. I felt a TIGHTNESS in my throat, like it was CONSTRICTING. And after an hour, I was still SO HUNGRY. I took a few more bites and AGAIN I choked and coughed it up. My chest was on FIRE and my stomach was bellowing but I couldn’t get it down!! Something was BLOCKING it.

The crying had stopped, and I slept for the first time in days. When I woke, I was STARVING. I took a few more bites and AGAIN. Choke, sputter, cough. Again, choke, sputter, cough, repeat. He is in there. I know he is. And he is EATING. MY. FOOD. SELFISH BASTARD!!! HE WON’T LEAVE ME ALONE!!!

I need to get him out. I feel like I haven’t eaten in days. I can barely sleep. Sometimes I feel a jolt in my chest and start coughing out of NOWHERE. Like food has been pushed back UP. He’s alive in there and he’s WRIGGLING.

I tried to vomit but nothing WORKED. I stuck my hand in my throat but when the vomit should have come it got BLOCKED. Only a splash of acid escaped my throat. It felt like getting PUNCHED from INSIDE. 

I am typing this with knife in hand. If you do not answer me I will CUT HIM OUT. I have to. I’m SO HUNGRY!!! I’m so hungry! So hungry.
