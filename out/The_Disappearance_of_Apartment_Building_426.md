I remembered the night it happened so clearly; I had been living downtown. 

I was sleeping, but at exactly three in the morning, I was woken up by a deafeningly loud sound, almost like a horn blaring into my ears and the most violent earthquake I've ever felt. As if the ground itself were falling apart. 

Just as it had come the noise and rumbling ceased.

 I looked out my window and couldn't see anything. A dense fog had come in. So thick it looked as if someone had glued a bunch of pillow stuffing to the outside of my window.

I could hear people talking down in the streets and went to check out what was going on, thinking a massive earthquake had just hit us.

Multiple people were gathered across the street, talking to each other, their voices were riddled with confusion. Some were frantic talking about how one of the buildings had vanished. 

I saw where apartment 426 used to be. There was just an empty lot now as if nothing had ever been there 

In the middle of the night, across the street from me. A seven-story apartment complex had completely vanished, along with everyone in it.

The police searched for months.

 The story was all over the news. 

The missing posters of the two hundred tenants of apartment 426 littered the streets. Cops were everywhere desperately searching for all those people.

But life moves on, there never came any leads to the case. The police got others to investigate and people moved on.

Now all that remains from that night are the memories of all those who went missing.

It wouldn't be until years later that I got any real clue as to what happened.

I was over at my father's house drinking with him and one of his buddies. The guy used to be a cop and the topic of disappearances came up. 

I asked him if they ever found apartment 426 or any of the tenants. His face twisted into a grim expression and he leaned forward before speaking in a hushed tone.

“Look, I'm really not supposed to talk about it, but it's been years, and I trust neither of you will say shit to anyone. 

We found the building. 

It was a couple of months after the whole thing went down. One of the cops was at the lot where the building used to be when his radio picked up a stray signal. 

He said it was hundreds of people screaming all at once. Like the sounds of hell were coming through his radio. 

We all assumed the signal was coming from inside the building and that it proved our theory that it had somehow sunk into the ground. 

So we brought in a ground-penetrating radar. Lo and behold, there it is, two hundred feet beneath the surface. Funny thing is, we had already done scans when it first happened, and it hadn't been there. So why was it there now? 

Anyways, they drilled into it from a nearby metro station.

 It took them months. 

They weren't really hoping to find anyone alive. I mean they knew how slim the chances were. If those people hadn't run out of food, they would've run out of air. 

I guess they just wanted to know what happened. 

The thing is, when they finally got in, it was completely empty. Not a fucking soul. 

This place was completely sealed, no exits.

Trust me, they looked. 

It's as if everyone that was in the building just up and vanished without a trace. 

Well, that's not entirely true. Because they did find one of them, a couple of months later. 

They were excavating an old stone foundation in the old port, when they hit something soft. 

Guy gets out, and there's just blood everywhere. The excavation shovel had cracked open one of the huge boulders and there was a guy fused in there.

It gets weirder cause this guy's skin was fucking translucent. 

Like they could see everything inside him and shit.

His blood was still warm as if he'd just been alive. 

They're obviously freaking the fuck out and call the police and they aren't really taking it all that seriously when they get there. I mean, I can't even blame them. I wouldn't have believed it myself if I hadn't seen it. 

They're just about laughing in this guy's face until they see the guy in the rock. 

I was friends with those guys and they told me they'd never been that scared.

The dude looked like a human-shaped sausage, you know, like a clear casing, and you could see all his insides. 

Parts of him were completely fused with the rock, like there was no separation between where the skin started and where the rock ended.

I kinda laughed at them at that point, cause I thought they were pulling my leg but they looked so seriously at me that I stopped. 

I mean, I'd never seen those guys like that; they were genuinely horrified.

So they brought the body to the coroner and he looked just as baffled. Said he'd never seen something like it in his twenty years of working there. 

So what killed this guy? 

Well, as it turns out, it was blunt force trauma from the excavation shovel. 

I mean how the fuck does that even make sense? The guy was encased in stone. How the fuck was he still alive? 

They ran his blood and identified him as one of the missing people. We called his family to come and identify his body. 

By the time they got there, he'd just up and disappeared again. Poof, just like that gone into thin air.

We couldn't explain it; there were cameras all over that place, and they caught nothing. 

We never found him again. 

You know? 

We never found any of the others either. 

I quit after that. 

Couldn't really stomach it anymore.”

We sat in silence for a while just thinking about what he said.

I'd never heard this guy lie in my life. But what he'd just told us was completely nuts and somehow I'd believed him. I mean I was there that night. I saw that the building had vanished.

I guess hearing it from his mouth with all the additional information. It all just made it too real for me.

After a while he looked up at us, plastered on a smile that didn't reflect in his eyes and changed the subject to a completely different topic. 

I could stop thinking about what he told us so I left shortly after. 

I'm back home now, and it's foggy as hell outside. I got back at just the right time. Now I'm writing this out for you guys. Because I can't get it off my mind. People have to know what happened to them. 

They had families. 

Had lives.

I can't just let them fade away into nothing.

So I'll try to uncover more for you guys. For their families. I promise to update you guys soon.
