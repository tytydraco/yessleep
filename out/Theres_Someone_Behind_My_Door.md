There is someone behind my door.



I guess I should bring some context, perhaps that would make the situation more clear and less eerie. I feel as if I’m going insane. Maybe you guys could give me some clarity?

I’ve always been an easily scared child, more than most, but that is due to my own fault, if anything. As a child I’d watch the most terrifying movies, in secret, despite the disapproval from my parents, because I’d be the most courageous kid in the morning, and then would sob and beg to sleep in their bed at night. Maybe giving fuel to the nightmares wasn’t the best choice, but there was something about the adrenaline that came with watching a concept that was meant to terrify you. The tension and dread in waiting for a jumpscare, the anxiety in what would happen next, the adrenaline when it finally happens- they’re addicting feelings.

Every few months, when the stress of exams and clubs and whatnot would dial down, I’d dim the lights and pop open my computer, searching for a new scary movie to give me that feeling- that adrenaline, that urge to cover myself up in blankets. But I haven’t watched a good one in such a long time. Nothing that has made me feel like the terror I felt as a child. 

I’ve always shut my door when sleeping, ever since I woke up and almost pissed myself when I saw my mother standing in the doorway one night, thinking it was a murderer come to torture me. My mother started having lots of night shifts at the hospital lately, and so I usually keep the main light outside my room on so the house isn’t fully dark when she comes home, and also because it makes my mother feel less guilty about leaving me alone, since she says that keeping the house illuminated makes robbers less likely to break in.  

That’s when I started noticing *it*.

I was trying to sleep one day, when I turned over to face my door and something seemed *off*. The small narrow gap under the door, where usually there was a line of light, was obscured. A subtle figure, outlined by the light.

It looked as if there was a person standing behind my door. 

At first I thought it was my mother, but when I focused more on the gap, waiting to see if I’d notice any movement- there was nothing. It was still. Perhaps it was a shadow of furniture I never noticed before. That soothed my beating heart a little, but it still felt…a little unnatural. I wondered if I should check it out, but I was paralyzed in my bed. I simply turned over and after a few hours, I ended up falling asleep.

I slept, turned away from the door for a few nights after that.

Today, though, I decided to stop being such a coward. I left the door open. I haven’t done that in years, but the best time to start anything, is the present, right?

I turned to stare at the open doorway, and after an hour, there was nothing out of the ordinary. The courage and bravery I first had staring at the wall outside my room slowly evolved into boredom, and I ended up falling asleep.

But then I woke up in the middle of the night. And when I turned around, the door was shut. And beneath the door, in the narrow gap that was supposed to be filled with light- was the dark outline of someone standing. I’m not sure if it was just my sleep-addled brain, but suddenly I got the guts to get up, and open it.

There was a second in which I regretted it, in which I felt as if I had done something *terribly* wrong- but when I opened the door, there was no one there. Those feelings turned to relief- and I turned to go back into my bed, back into the blanket and back to sleep, facing the wall away from the open door, closing my eyes, but suddenly I couldn’t. There was something off again. I took a deep breath to clear my mind, and that was when I noticed it.

An exhale of breath that wasn't mine.

I still would like to think it’s my sleep-brain just going insane again, taking a slight fear of mine and turning it into this convoluted mess of a nightmare- but the more of the quiet breathing I hear coming from behind me that isn’t mine, is more that that hope starts to wane. I’ve been tightly closing my eyes for the past thirty minutes, and suddenly I got the bravery to slightly open my eyes- just a bit.

The door is still open, I can tell because the room isn’t so dark due to the light outside, and because the light slightly shines on the wall that I’m facing, and when I peaked open the lids of my eyes to see that wall, I noticed something. 

There is a shadow of something behind me.

I don’t know what to do guys- it’s been an hour, but I think I should turn around and see what it is.
