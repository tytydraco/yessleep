it was a dark winter evening, one in december, i was freshly 18 and in a relationship that lacked communication skills, not from my end anyways. my boyfriend and i began to argue at around this point, this night was no different.

after many tears were shed, i decided to go for a walk. i live on the “back roads” of a small village, the roads by my house are not lit, and have no path to walk on, only the small patches of grass on the side of this fairly busy road.

it’s 6pm, and pitch black, but i decide on the walk anyways. a very stupid idea for an eighteen year old girl to have. once i reach the motorway/highway bridge, i take a break at the top, looking at the cars go by, wondering where everyone is headed. there is a homeless shelter near this bridge, but i have never faced any issues, or strange encounters other than the odd stumbling, drunk man, who pays me no mind.

soon i feel hands wrapping around my waist, tight and wrong. part of me, full of delusions and a hopeless romantic, thought it was my boyfriend who found me and came to apologise. no, it was not him.

i feel a man pressing up against me, and he turns me, aggressively towards his friend. they are both around the age of thirty, unshaven, clad in baggy clothing, holding shopping bags that clinked whenever they moved. the man holding me did not speak english, but his friend did, both speaking polish, laughing and smelling of cigarettes.

i have never been in this sort of situation, and it was not the right time to find out that my stress response is freeze. i felt paralysed, unable to move, (quite literally) and unable to speak. they complimented my hair, and my eyes, though in the dark. they asked me my name, where i lived, what i was doing out so late. they kept talking to me, asking me any question that came to their mind. i felt it was best to answer, to not show fear, though the man behind me felt me shaking. they asked me if i wanted to come back with them, assuming to the shelter. i told them i was 16, which felt right in the moment, but i doubt they would have cared for my age.

i felt the man tightening his hold on me, and i could feel his “excitement”, i wanted to scream, cry, yell, but it was just us on this bridge. hardly anyone ever crossed it. i told them my boyfriend was about to come here, that he was waiting for me, a white lie, a saving lie. they kept asking questions but the man’s hold loosened until he let go of me. i ran, as fast as i could over the other end of the bridge, the opposite way they were going. i had never run so fast, i sat on a bench in the village, screaming crying. a few people walked past me, but nobody even cared to ask if i was okay. i called my boyfriend, and he walked me halfway home.

i will never walk alone in the dark again, and to this day, i have not crossed that bridge, no matter how bright it is outside.

to the two men on the bridge, lets not meet, not ever.
