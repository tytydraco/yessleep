Everyone has a BFF, at some point in their lives. We'll, everyone but me. I've always been the invisible girl. None of the kids will have anything to do with me. I've tried talking to them, inviting them over, taking part in sports, but nothing worked. They would just look at me funny, turn around and walk off. The teachers were the same way. Never helped me on questions, never picked me to answer, they wouldn't even call my name, just look at me and move on. 

Today that all changed. I was putting my things away when I get a tap on the shoulder. I turned around to a girl with low pig tails, and a flowered covered dress. "Can you show me around? I've tried to ask others, but they just walk away." She said. She is getting shunned to? But why! She looks like she would be a popular person! "That's okay, no one talks to me either, but I'll gladly show you around!" I said holding my arm out, for her to loop her arm in with mine. 

I gave her the tour of the whole school. Showed her the dorms, and took her to the park. "I still cant believe how big this place is! She was thrilled at this point. "So do you just attend the classes? How do the dorms work? Also, will you show me your room?" She has a million questions, but I didn't mind. I answered them all as quickly and correctly as possible. 

Once we made it to the dorm, I showed her my room. It wasn't much, but I didn't have much either. She danced around the room like a friend, looking at everything, and snooping through stuff. It's like she has known me for years. She stopped once she realized I was just watching her raid my room. 

"Listen I know me showing up wasn't planned, and you're probably upset with me." She hung her head down. "Why would you say that? Why would I be upset? I asked, now confused. "Well because when you left, you told me to promise not to follow you." She said, sending my confusion into overdrive. "I think you may have me mixed up with someone. I've never seen you before. I've lived here, since I was a child. The Dean took me in so I wouldn't have to go to the system." I revealed. 

Her hands flew to her mouth. Tears started running down her face. "You... you don't remember?" She said as if she couldn't believe it. At this point I'm getting upset. "I don't know what the hell you're talking about Amber!!!" I shouted, surprising even myself. Her eyes got wide, and I could see the hurt in her eyes before it was replaced with.... excitment?excitement?! 

"I never told you my name!" She exclaimed. I was stunned. My head started hurting. My breath catching in my throat. My head. My head. Then, it all flooded back to me. The Dean... I was 7. He killed my family... he hurt me. Forced me to attend the private school he ran. He got caught because of Amber. Amber, was his daughter 11 when we met. She took care of me. Since I was a child. She helped me get away. I was 18. "Please don't leave me Kyra. You're my best friend. You can't leave me." I heard her crying. 

My eyes snapped open. Amber was knelt down next to me. "I couldn't live without you, so I joined you." My eyes stung as I wrapped her in a hug. "The Dr. Couldn't... there was so much damage." She began to cry. "I promised to be strong but this past year was so hard, I couldn't do it." I was now crying right along with her. "I've been dead for a year? Im dead?" The question lingered in the air. Come to think of it I don't remember much after going to the hospital. I looked at her and she got an amused look on her face and said "well yeah, why do you think no one talks to you?"
