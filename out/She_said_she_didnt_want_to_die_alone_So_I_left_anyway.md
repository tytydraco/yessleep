I keep dreaming about a house that has no windows.

Four blank walls. Concrete the colour of ash. A door that doesn’t have hinges, just a single crack down the middle like a wound. It’s always open a little. Just enough to invite you in.

I’ve never been inside it—
Until this morning.

The letter came last night. Folded in half, no envelope. Just placed on my pillow while I slept. The handwriting was shaky, uneven. But I knew it. I know it.

***“I waited. The room is cold. You said you wouldn’t leave. Please come.”***

***– C.***

I burned it.

Didn’t matter. The house was already here.

••

I took the train to the coast. Not because I thought the house would be there, but because it felt right. The shoreline was where we used to go on the good days. Before the coughing, before the tubes and the chair and the hospice bed that smelled like boiled bleach and forgotten skin.

I didn’t even check a map. Just walked.

The town was wrong from the first step off the platform.

Empty, but not abandoned.
No birds. No traffic.

Just heatless wind that smelled like chemical smoke and old sugar.

I knew I’d find it. And I did.

Past the skeletal trees, past the black field that buzzed with flies, I found the house with no windows.

Same as the dream.

It breathed through the open crack.

And I stepped inside.

••

The world twisted.

I stood in the hallway of her flat. Not as it was before she got sick—but after. Grey light through thin curtains. Bedpans by the sofa. Bottles on every surface—codeine, morphine, Lorazepam. The smell of rot under rose spray.

A photo on the wall: her graduation. Her smile frozen in amber. I couldn’t look at it for long. The longer I stared, the more her face blurred.

From down the hall came a sound.

Not footsteps.

Wheels.

A chair being slowly pushed across carpet.

***“Connor…”*** a voice rasped. ***“I can’t reach the water…”***

I turned.

And there she was.

But not really.

A shadow slumped in the old wheelchair, wrapped in a hospital gown soaked to the hem with brown water. Her head lolled. Tubes trailed behind her like dragging vines, tangled around her feet.

Her eyes were open.

Too wide. Too wet.

Her mouth hung slack, jaw unhinged like a snake’s, as if she was mid-scream but had forgotten what the sound was for.

***“I waited,”*** she said.

She rolled toward me without pushing the wheels.

I ran.

••

The hallway twisted with me.

Tiles replaced carpet. Fluorescent lights flickered to red. Machines beeped and gurgled in the walls like organs failing in sequence.

At the end of the corridor was her hospice room—but wrong. Bigger. Endless.

Rows and rows of beds lined the space. Each one filled.

Not with her. With me.

Dozens of versions. Some younger. Some older. One sobbing into a blanket. One lying catatonic. One smiling with cracked teeth, hands stained red. One holding a pillow tight to his chest.

All of them staring at the far end of the room.

Where a shape stood.

I thought it was human at first.

Then it moved.

Its legs were melted together, forcing it to walk in a dragging hop. One shoulder jutted up like it had been broken and never reset. Its arms were bound in leather restraints that fused into its skin. Its chest pulsed like it was trying to breathe through scar tissue.

Its face was wrapped in gauze soaked through with blood, but I could see the imprint of a mouth moving beneath it.

And from the cracks in the gauze, it whispered—

***“You left.”***

••

I ran again.

Through doorways that led nowhere. Stairs that bent sideways. Rooms that filled with salt water the moment I blinked. I clawed at the walls until my fingers bled.

The house wouldn’t let me go.

It was me.

And every room I entered showed me another part I thought I’d buried.

The night I promised to stay until the end.

The day I signed the DNR and left the room before she could wake up.

The last voicemail she left. I never listened. I didn’t want to hear what she sounded like dying.

Now I heard it in every wall.

••

The final room was hers.

Not the real one. But how I remember it.

Sunlight through gauze curtains. The scent of lemon balm. Her books stacked neatly by the window. A photo of us on the nightstand, faces younger than we ever felt.

She lay in the bed.

Beautiful. Untouched. Eyes closed.

***“Connor,”*** she whispered, without opening them. ***“I’m so cold.”***

I stepped closer. ***“I’m here.”***

***“No,”*** she said. ***“You’re late.”***

Her mouth opened and the scream spilled out—not from her lungs but from everywhere. The walls trembled. The bed collapsed into rusted steel. And she changed.

Not into a monster.

But into the last moment I saw her—gasping, grey-skinned, eyes desperate. The real version. Not the dream. Not the guilt-curated one.

***“You told me you’d stay,”*** she said. ***“Even if I couldn’t talk. Even if I couldn’t breathe.”***

***“I was scared,”*** I said. ***“I—I thought you’d want to go in peace.”***

***“You thought you couldn’t handle watching me go.”***

She sat up. Her bones cracked like dried twigs.

***“I forgave you once,”*** she said. ***“But you buried me in silence. You turned me into this house.”***

The walls began to dissolve.

I felt myself sinking.

••

I woke back in my flat.

Sweating. Shaking. Screaming her name into the dark.

The photo of us on the bedside table was shattered.

And beside it—another letter.

***“It’s not over. I’m still here. Come back. I forgive you.”***

I don’t know if she means it.

I’m not sure if I’ll return to the house.

If i do, maybe I’ll be brave enough to stay.
