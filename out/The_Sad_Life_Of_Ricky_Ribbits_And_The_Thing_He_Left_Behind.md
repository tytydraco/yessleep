I’ve never spoken about this out loud since I was a kid. Ricky was something that I tried to leave behind a long time ago.   
Ricky was my friend.  
I guess in a way, whether I like it or not, he still is.  
\-  
I met him in 1993 during my junior year in high school. I was sixteen. My family had moved to a backwoods, backwards little town in the middle of the Sierra Nevada. To this day, you’ll still see lifted trucks there cruising the main street flying the stars and bars with empty beer cans rattling around in their beds.  
I was from Los Angeles, so I was out of my element, and it was a little bit of a culture shock to me being the only hispanic kid on white mountain. There were native kids there too, but they stuck to their own and went to their own school on the reservation about twenty miles outside of town.   
I was the only brown face in the school pictures, but I wasn’t the only one who stood out.  
Ricky did too.  
\-  
Everybody went by their last names or nicknames, just like the school had never made it out of the fifties. The first nickname I heard that day belonged to Ricky.  
Ricky Ribbits.  
Sometimes it was Frog Boy.  
Or just plain Ribbits.   
Small town bullies aren’t terribly creative nor particularly intelligent, but they’re far from ineffective. Somehow, they take your whole life before it even starts, and you spend decades trying to get over the wreckage they made of your youth.  
It comes as little solace that their lives, whether short or long, are usually full of misery.  
I met Ricky the first day I moved to that awful place.  
\-  
He was the only kid in the cafeteria who was reading a book. He was sitting by himself with a paperback copy of The Terminal Man.  
I sat across from him and ate in silence. Just before I was finished, I heard that distinctive voice that has stayed with me ever since.  
“Welcome to hell friend.” He didn’t even look up over the book.  
“Thanks.”  
“The food is shit, the guys are assholes, and all the girls tell me they’re spoken for. I think they’re lying.”  
“I’m Ray.”  
He peered around the beat up paperback and eyed me up and down.  
“Ricky, huh?”  
“That’s uh… a good book.”  
“Yeah. I’m on a Michael Crichton kick after Jurassic Park and Rising Sun.” He smiled and moved the book back in front of his face.  
“I heard they’re making a Congo movie next year.”  
“They’ll probably ruin it.”  
“I completely agree. The Rising Sun movie kinda sucked. Especially compared to the book.”  
He put the book down and looked me up and down.  
“So school finally has another reader! Well, at least I’m not the only kid who looks different anymore.” He started laughing. It was an odd wheezy croak that was impossible not to laugh at. It was infectious.  
That little bit of conversation was enough to build a solid friendship on.   
\-  
Ricky and I were best friends by the end of that first week. I miss that about being a teenager; the ability to forge a life long bond within a few short hours.  
What I don’t miss is the lack of judgment that also leads to life long consequences.  
\-  
Ricky rode around on one of those little amigo scooter things, because walking was difficult for him. He actually shuffled more than walked. He suffered from some kind of condition, I never really asked what it was and he never offered to tell me.   
His legs were short and turned at odd angles. His arms were abnormally long, his torso bulged in random places, and his stomach was distended. He didn’t really have much of a neck, almost like his head melted around it, covering it with things that looked more like jowls than cheeks. His lips looked as if they were inflated and his tongue never quite fit in his mouth, which gave his voice a gurgling quality that almost sounded like he was underwater.  
Sadly, he came by his nickname honestly.  
He would wear a baseball cap over his long hair that he kept in a ponytail, and he was always wearing a black Tool t-shirt with the picture of a double ended box wrench that looked like a dick and balls.  
I both witnessed and experienced the bullying well before the end of my first day.   
\-  
Blake Vaugn.  
Of course he was a jock.  
Of course the girls at school swooned over his monosyllabic charms.  
Of course he was pretty.  
Of course he was cruel.   
The first time I saw him, he smirked and dubbed me, “O’Ray”; a nickname that stuck until I moved after that awful night in the middle of my senior year.   
The entourage behind him of more than ten, all laughed at Blake’s mastery of wit and not so subtle racism. They were an assorted bunch of muscular myrmidons that followed Blake both on and off the field. An unruly band of mullets, wrangler jeans, and dim prospects.  
They all croaked at Ricky as they walked away.  
\-  
Ricky made it clear that no one would give a shit about the bullying.  
He made it clear that the town was not very kind towards people who looked different.  
He was right.  
More than he knew.  
\-  
Ricky would have to leave his scooter outside of the classrooms at every period, so of course it was vandalized at least once every couple of weeks.  
One time, something had been done to it that caused Ricky to lose control of it going up the hill towards our english class. It rolled backwards and spilled over the side of the hill, sending Ricky rolling towards the bottom.   
He broke his right arm.  
Nothing was done. No one was punished.  
\-  
Most of the bullying towards me was verbal. An assorted cacophony of racial slurs that I won’t repeat here.  
I remember one time where someone had filled my locker with beans. As I opened it, they spilled all over the floor. I was livid.  
At lunch that day, Ricky told me a story.  
\-  
He was nine.   
Blake and his friends had collected a bunch of dead flies from the window sills in the classroom, and at recess, Blake made Ricky eat them in front of everybody.  
“What did you do?”  
“What do you think I did? Nothing. Look at me. I’m barely four feet tall. Those guys would have kicked my ass! I told my mom and she went to the principal, but that just made it worse. I stopped telling my mom anything after that.”   
“I just wish I could do something.”  
“We could always just kill them all.”  
I just smiled, but Ricky let out that wheezy croaking laughter.   
\-  
Over the summer before our senior year, Ricky started going to the doctor a lot. He didn’t want to talk about it. He started to become more depressed.  
He was also getting into weird shit. Satanic shit. He didn’t talk to me about that either, but I saw the books in his room and the notebook he kept next to them.  
He was taking notes.  
Lots of them.  
Whatever disease he suffered from was getting worse, which made him angry. It was getting harder for him to walk and his breathing was labored when he spoke.  
He insisted we go to the Harvest Dance together just before Halloween.  
“Ricky, I don’t know if that’s a good idea.”  
“Why not?”  
“Because we don’t have dates, Ricky.”  
“Come on man! I need someone to drive me. My mom’s working. Please.”  
“I don’t know.”  
“Um… I don’t know how long I’m going to be around Ray. I’ve never been to one. Please.”  
Two weeks later, we went to the dance.  
\-  
I watched him that night. He wasn’t using his scooter, he was walking. I could tell it was hard on him.  
I watched him walk up to every girl and ask for a dance.  
I watched them shoot him down and down, time after time.  
I watched him shuffle on the dance floor by himself to the music.  
I watched people whispering to each other and laughing.  
Finally, I watched a girl agree to dance with him.  
It was a slow dance.  
She was easily over a foot taller than him.  
I saw the look on my friend's face. His eyes were closed and he was smiling.  
That whole dance, Ricky was elated. I was happy for him.  
He couldn’t see the face of the girl that he was dancing with. She was clearly embarrassed. She looked like she was on the verge of tears as people were whispering and smirking.  
Ricky was blissfully ignorant.  
When the dance was done, Ricky looked up at her and she quickly changed her face to a smile. He kissed her hand and thanked her for the dance.  
He walked back to me and hopped on his scooter.  
There were tears in his eyes and he was still smiling.  
“Okay. I’m ready to go home.”  
\-  
I didn’t tell Ricky what I saw. It never even crossed my mind.  
When we got to his house, he asked me if I could help him with something.  
I helped him fill two boxes with books and notepads. Books on the occult and The Anarchist’s Cookbook. Some books that looked really old.  
Lots of notebooks.  
One of them fell open.  
The things he had written. The things he had drawn.  
I got a glimpse of not only the pain he’d felt, but the pain he wanted to cause in others.  
The things I saw were terrible.  
Things he wanted to do to everyone in the school.  
I had no idea of the ugly things in my friend’s head.  
\-  
We took them out behind his house and put them in his firepit, doused them with gasoline, and set them all on fire.  
He was quiet for a long time.  
“I finally feel ok. I’ve never felt this good. My life has been so hard. You’re the only friend I’ve ever had. That was the only girl I’ve ever touched. I’m happy. I don’t want to end, being angry.”  
I could see tears rolling down his deformed face in the light from the fire, but he was smiling.  
“I’m not going to be around much longer, Ray. Could you do something with me?” He looked up at me and all I could do was nod. He pulled a pocket knife out and cut his right palm. He handed me the knife.   
I don’t know if kids still do this, but it was a big deal when I was young. I couldn’t say no.  
He was my friend.  
I took the knife and slit my left palm.  
When we clasped our hands together, he squeezed my hand and bowed his head.  
“Now I’ll always have a piece of you, and you’ll always have a piece of me.”  
I should have asked him what was going on, but I couldn’t.  
“Blood Brothers.” was all I could say.  
“Blood Brothers.”  
The next Monday, everything would change.  
\-  
When we got to school, it was obvious that Blake and his friends had been busy. There were xeroxed copies of two polaroid pictures plastered in every hall of the school.  
Hundreds of them.  
The first picture showed Ricky dancing with the girl; his blissful face pressed against her. The look of her extreme embarrassment on her face was the focal point.   
Directly under that on the page was another picture.   
Ricky was smiling as he shuffled away from the girl, unaware that just behind him, she was trying to wipe away the kiss he had given to her hand. The look on her face was one of exaggerated revulsion and disgust.  
Everyone in the background was stifling their laughter.  
\-  
“You want me to take you home?”  
“I’m good. I don’t want to talk about it, Ray.”  
Ricky didn’t want to talk that day. He didn’t want to talk all week. He just went about his days with a distant smile, never saying a word to anyone.  
\-  
That Thursday night, five of the football players collapsed on the field. Three of them died. Someone had spiked the Gatorade jug on the sideline with antifreeze.  
Everyone suspected Ricky, but no one saw him do it. Even having seen those awful notebooks and the things he wrote, I couldn’t see how Ricky could have pulled it off without being noticed.  
It was almost impossible that Ricky was the person who did it.   
The next night, Ricky went missing anyway.  
\-  
He was found on Saturday morning hanging by a rope from the branch of the gigantic oak tree just past the end of the football field. His scooter was on the ground underneath him, and there was a ladder propped up against the tree.  
There was a typed suicide note that wasn’t signed.   
Everyone in town with the exception of Ricky’s mother, just accepted that Ricky had committed suicide.  
Everyone came to the conclusion that he couldn’t live with himself after what he had done to the football players.  
The bruises all over his face and body were blamed on multiple failed attempts to climb the tree.  
No one cared.  
\-  
Ricky’s mom left town after a few weeks. She couldn’t take it anymore.  
People kept vandalizing her home in the middle of the night. Words like,  
“MURDERER” “FROG MONSTER” “BURN” “FREAK”  
were just some of the things people had painted along the siding. Others were far more creative.   
One morning, she found fourteen dolls of Kermit The Frog hanging by nooses from her eaves. The general consensus was that she had given birth to a monster, so she should have to pay some small price at the very least.  
I have no idea whatever became of her.  
\-  
It was almost Christmas when it was discovered that the girl who had danced with Ricky had a complete mental break and had poisoned the Gatorade. She couldn’t handle the guilt any longer.  
She confessed to it.  
She had been humiliated by the pictures.  
She didn’t think she had put enough antifreeze in to kill anyone. She just wanted to make them sick.  
She was sorry, but she never said anything about the boy who was most likely murdered for something she had done.  
She was arrested.  
No one cared about what happened to Ricky.  
\-  
I started having nightmares shortly afterward. I kept seeing Ricky’s notes. I kept seeing him swinging from that branch.   
In my dreams, I was following someone, but I couldn’t see their face. I was watching them sleep through their bedroom window. I was trying to get into their house.  
When I was awake, I always felt like I was being watched. In the beginning, I thought I was imagining my shadow moving slightly slower than it should. Like it was struggling to keep pace with me.  
\-  
Life went on. Ricky’s house remained empty. All the windows had been broken. The graffiti covered the whole house. There were For Sale signs up, but no one even wanted to acknowledge it was there.  
One morning, I woke up on autopilot and eventually, I found myself standing in front of the ruin that used to be Ricky’s house. I had no memory of driving there.   
Someone else had done the driving.  
I got out of my car and sat on the front porch. I missed my friend.  
People passed in their cars and looked at me like I was crazy for being there.   
Just when I was about to get up, I heard a frog croak from the backyard.  
And then another.  
And then another.  
There was another sound. A low persistent drone.  
\-  
When I walked through the back gate, I could smell it. Something was dead.   
The sound of hundreds of frogs erupted, and I recognized the drone.  
Flies were swarming around the body of Jake Collins. He was hanging by a rope from the back porch. Hundreds of frogs were climbing over each other underneath him; their tongues lashing out at the cloud of flies.  
\-  
I ran out of the backyard screaming.   
I was questioned at the Sheriff's office. Jake Collins had been out with his best friend, Blake Vaugn the night before, but he had never come home. His body showed signs of decomposition that indicated it had been hanging there for at least a week.  
They said there were no frogs anywhere, nor any flies. I found out later though that Jake’s mouth had been full of dead flies.  
\-  
Everyone thought I had been involved somehow. I didn’t tell anyone about the dreams that I had been having.  
Everyone avoided me at school.  
\-  
Two nights later, Benji Mackey was found the same way hanging from the same tree where Ricky supposedly committed suicide.  
The tree that had become affectionately nicknamed, Ribbit’s Tree.  
Even though my parents had said that I had been home all night, I was taken in for a forty eight hour hold.  
That night I couldn’t sleep. I was exhausted. At one point, I watched my shadow move across the floor while I was sitting still.  
I blamed what I was seeing on how tired I was. I watched it move across the floor and out of the room.  
\-  
I was released the next day.  
During the early hours of the morning, the school janitor had found the bodies of fourteen boys hanging from Ribbit’s Tree.   
All of them had been beaten before they were hanged.  
All of their mouths were full of dead flies.  
As we left, I noticed that I wasn’t casting a shadow.  
\-  
My parents insisted that I stay in my room. They were making plans to go back to Los Angeles and stay with family for awhile. Apparently, they had both been harassed by people in the town. It seems that the town's mind was made up that I had something to do with the murders.  
We were going to be leaving early the next morning.  
That was not to be.  
\-  
I heard Ricky. He told me to get up. I remember walking outside in my boxers and a t-shirt. I felt like I had no control over my body. I felt him pushing me.  
I looked down at the sidewalk. I could see my shadow being cast from the streetlamp. It looked like there was something perched on my shoulders. Something that was moving.  
Across the street, I saw a car that I recognized instantly.  
Blake Vaugn’s. I kept walking towards it and I watched Blake and two of his friends get out of the car.  
I tried to yell, but my mouth wasn’t working.  
Something else had control over me.  
Blake and his friends grabbed me and threw me inside of his trunk.  
Just before they closed the trunk and everything went dark, I could see a rope lying next to me.   
\-  
I was taken out to Ribbit’s Tree and thrown to the ground at the foot of it. They were drunk. Blake was the only one who spoke.  
“I don’t know how you did it, but I know it was you. Now we’re gonna do to you what we did to your friend.”  
They tied a noose, wrapped it around my neck, and then threw the rope over the lowest branch.  
“It was really funny when that little froggy fucker tried to get into my house that night. Pulling up on his special scooter with a gun. Fuckin’ hilarious. It was almost too easy with him, but you, you were even easier. Vaya con Dios, asshole.”  
I felt Blake’s fist pop into my stomach and while I was doubled over, they tied the other end of the rope to the front of Blake’s car.  
Blake jumped into the driver’s seat and backed up, slowly pulling me into the air.   
I dangled at the end of that rope for what felt like an eternity. Illuminated by the headlights while Blake and his friends opened beers and toasted each other.  
I caught my shadow  cast against the tree out of the corner of my eye. It started to move up and along the rope to the branch above. I heard the rope rip somewhere above me and I fell to the ground.  
I rose to my knees and clawed at the rope. I had expected Blake and his friends to come running over to me, but they were all looking up.  
Something was moving in the tree above me. It was hard to see what happened next with the headlights shining in my eyes.  
I could hear sounds like branches breaking and the screams of the young men. It was all very quick; the things that were done to the other two boys.   
Blake was not so lucky.  
He was screaming at me to help him.   
He tried to run towards me, but his legs were both broken at odd angles.   
I stood up and I could see that something was hunched on his shoulders. A shadow.  
It was pressing downwards and Blake’s body began to collapse in on itself. His torso began to bulge in random places and his stomach became distended.   
I watched as his arms began to pop and stretch forward to a freakish length.   
Part of the shadow rested on the top of Blake’s head, and his face began to move down over his neck, almost like his head was melting around it, covering it with things that looked more like jowls than cheeks. His lips began to bulge. He started to scream, but it was more of a gurgle.   
Finally, I watched the shadow move inside of Blakes mouth and pull out his tongue until it was hanging on by only the smallest shred of flesh.  
I turned and ran, not wanting to see what was next or to possibly be next.  
My shadow did not follow.  
\-  
I was quiet when I went inside. I was still shaking when I pulled my covers to my face.  
My parents were sure that I had never left, and they would go on to tell the Sheriff as much. The bodies of Blake’s friends were never found, but Blake was found at the foot of the tree. He was on his haunches, crouched like a frog, unable to move.  
He was left alive, but his brain was as broken as his body.  
As far as I know, he’s still alive in a nursing home. If you can call that alive.  
\-  
Life went on. My family moved, but my shadow didn’t follow. At least not right away.  
It was strange how no one noticed.  
I could never tell anyone.  
I couldn’t tell them about my friend.  
Part of me was scared that if I did, it would come for me.   
I had more nightmares. More pictures in my head of people I barely knew or didn’t know at all who were killed in terrible ways.  
After a while, my shadow returned, but every once in a while, it would leave for a time.   
Years later, thanks to social media, I saw that the Legend of Ricky Ribbit’s was alive and well. Kids would leave small offerings at the foot of Ribbit’s Tree asking for Ricky’s help with bullies or abusive parents.  
There were also reports of suicides, murders, and missing children.  
I recognized all of them.   
I know what I would need to do to stop this, but I can’t take my own life.  
It’s not fair.  
\-  
I’ve tried to go on with my life. I’m married. We had a son eight years ago. His name is Daniel.  
Daniel was born with Down Syndrome, and up until last week, he’s always been very happy.  
Last monday, he didn’t want to go to school. He told me he was being bullied. He told me the names of the boys who were calling him names.  
I wish I didn’t know. I want this to stop, because I know what’s about to happen.  
My shadow left me that night, and it still hasn’t returned.  
I caught Daniel talking to someone in his room last night who wasn’t there.  
His new friend, Ribbits.
