I think the biggest misconception about The Devil—as we presently mundane beings know him—is that he’d *need* us to do his bidding, to carry out his will. The real idiots believe him to be some near-equal rival to God, ever-engaged in a grand cosmic war, with Earth as its theater; us as the spiritually malleable players. But that, scripturally and even logically, is false. Neither is he some cool, sorcerous libertine, uninterested in Holy Affairs yet never quite ignorant enough to miss out on spoiling them when the occasion for mischief arises. He is, in every sense of the word, a prisoner; doomed to an eternal sentence in the Hadean depths, the everblack pit, Stygian and smoldering and inescapable.  

But he’s still Satan, still The Adversary—just not to God. He’s *our* antagonist, and in no way does he care for us, and he certainly doesn’t need us. I’m belaboring over this explanation, this *proper* identification of The Fallen One, for this simple reason: to impart the idea—the fact—that those in power, those who overseer and rule us, are not in league with the undivine one. They have no accord with him; the atrocities they allegedly conduct do not gain for them further influence or power that their perfectly human means wouldn’t have otherwise begat. They defile and destroy, sure; but it’s not getting them anything from him, from below. They are LARPers, regardless of what they may or may not believe.  

I have no love for Satan, and I certainly don’t respect him. But I would never underestimate him, nor reduce his diabolic machinations to be humanly amenable. His power—his influence—is insidious, pervasive. **Eroding.** No human may deal with him equally, and certainly not profitably. He hates us—he is not a liberator.  

You can slit throats and open bellies as sacrificial pledges of allegiance to the sun—that won’t stop it from cooking your skin with cancer if it radioactively deigns to.  

I learned this grave yet admittedly obvious truth in a rather unique and terrifying way, when I tried not to make a deal with the devil, but to opt out of one that had been made prior to my birth. Upon death, I wanted to be annihilated; I desired neither the unceasing, intoxicating bliss of Heaven nor the eternal agony of Hell. I just wanted oblivion—pure nonexistence, no existential or ontological remnants of my being. True, sterile and stagnant Death.  I've been so tired of existing, lately. So fed up with the dull, feasibly inescapable monotony of human life; the endless march towards death, which my ingrained-at-youth faith wouldn't let me believe was the end of existence. Being faced with a "part two" to life, one that would go on forever and ever...I just couldn't except it. 

So, I called upon that Wretched One, the most (ironically) esteemed of the incarcerated, and offered him a lifetime of service in exchange for an eternity of nothing. I’d seen his “work” firsthand, his subtly wrought malignancy, and knew that he was not entirely powerless; more so only physically cut off from literally walking the Earth and spreading despair. But I also understood that I’d have to do most of the heavy lifting on the terrestrial side of things.  

Seeing as how I wished for the utter destruction of my soul, I figured that he’d be happy to oblige. My spirit as some abstract item distinct from my corporeal vessel—or bolstering life-force—was useless to him, so he’d have no reason to demand it. My total eradication was more in line with his *true* goal: The end of mankind, his only way of getting back at the creator he’d so foolishly thought to depose. What he’d do upon the utter extinction of mankind is anyone’s guess. I certainly wouldn’t care—I'd be dead.  

Through means I won’t bother relating here—both for the sake of time and the necessary admission of heinous activities—I managed to book a nebulous meeting with that Chthonic fiend and lay out my intentions.  

Seeing as how I was still mortal—and therefore susceptible to death and an *improper* afterlife—I paid him all the due “respect”, lest I incur that long-harbored wrath. Seeing the mutual benefit in my grim proposition, he heartily agreed, and supplied me with a few diabolical abilities and pieces of antediluvian knowledge I wouldn’t have otherwise been able to acquire, no matter how much money or ill-defined power I possessed. The site at which we’d held congress was then summarily sanitized by hell-fire, leaving naught but blackly scorched earth.  

Using these ultramundane tools, I was to wreak havoc upon my kind, and—if things went really well—augur the emergence of that *other* entity, who’d dare to contest Christ, despite the failure of past attempts.  

But life has a funny way to going a completely different direction than the one you’d envisioned, as the old saying commonly (and annoyingly) reminds us: *God laughs while you make plans.*  

I was all set to incinerate a whole swath of people who’d gathered for some middling sporting event, when a man, mid-30s and dressed appropriately for the pre-spring weather came up to me and said, “If you could forestall that” (referring to the fiery orb growing in my palm) “for a moment, I’d be extremely grateful. There is something you should know, before continuing.” 

It was the man’s inflection—more than his apparent knowledge of my intentions—that caused me to close my fist and extinguish the incendiary nova. He’d sounded as if the decimation of the crowd would be of no greater imposition than an impatient waiter’s latest inquiry into what he’d like to eat.  

I was intrigued, so I waited for him to explain, while the game or match or whatever carried on beside us.  

As if he hadn’t the slightest worry of having no game to return to, he waved to someone in the crowd—a gesture which intimated, *be right back*—and said, “Well, we’re aware of the deal you made. And while I’m sure you think it’s smart, maybe even genius, it just won’t work like that. He’s the Destroyer, sure—but souls aren’t something he can destroy. He can rend and tear and blast to his black heart’s content, but you—your spirit—will persist; and you’ll just have earned yourself a spot right by him, in you-know-where. So, I suggest you just relinquish these powers of yours and go about your regular life.....maybe attend Mass once in a while.”  

I balked at him; I somehow hadn’t thought I could be deceived, not so lamely.  

“So, you’re what, an emissary? An angel sent to show me the right path?”  

The man visibly cringed, a response a normal man would’ve had at seeing someone holding a ball of fire in their hands.  

“Oh no, not at all. Let’s just say I’m a very interested third party, and that I’m thoroughly, unfortunately familiar with the Adversary’s business model. Earth is a big place, but it alone will never fill Hell. There’s a lot of acreage up, down, around there—the purported geometry differs from place to place. I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s actually limitless, given mannkind’s propesnity for procreation, and the domain’s intent. So long as men and sin exist, there’ll be room in Hell.”   

A whistle signaled the end of *something,* and the two teams—who'd been amateurishly or professionally competing, I couldn’t say which—broke away from the field to convene at their respective sidelines. My unannounced and unallied interlocutor smiled, then promptly rejoined those he’d left behind. 

Through the same occult and urelatable affairs, I managed to once again gain an audience with The Dragon. Obviously, he was not happy with my violation of our agreement, and swore to, well, himself, that he’d ruin me; that my life from then on would be hideously, deliciously awful. But a casual invocation of Christ’s name sent the ophidian offender shrinking away, the flame-rimmed portal blinking out of terrestrial occupancy like a popped balloon.  

I was still terrified, considering that I had literally conversed with the devil not once, but twice; and had in the second instance angered him enough to warrant his personal intervention in every moment of happiness of my life. I believe in God and his sovereignty, but unlike Satan, terror *actually* poses a considerable threat to my faith in the Lord’s ever-vigilant care. 

But I nonetheless continued with my life, considering myself “lucky” to have dealt with the devil and lived to ruminate upon the theological implications. It wasn’t until a few weeks later—when I’d successfully though foolishly forgotten my sub-surface teleconference with unenviable one—that I reaped what I’d sown.  

While reading a Greg Egan story and understanding very little of the mathemetical exposition-dumping—but nonetheless enjoying the story for its broader Sci-Fi allure—the floor of my apartment collapsed, revealing a flaming pit below. This was both terrifying and bewildering, seeing as how I live on the fourth floor, and would’ve felt if not heard the eruption of the Earth beneath the complex.  

Glued to my lounge chair in a paralazying fear, I watched as a black, shadowy, and thorn-lined tendril rose from out of the pit, leaving in its wake tufts and motes of inky darkness, like Hadean spores. Even though the pit smoldered with a sallow haze and belched visible fumes, I felt no heat; and neither were there any noticeable effects upon the apartment itself, beyond where the rupture had come through in the floor.  

The disconcertingly ophidian tendril rose to the ceiling, where it stained the surface blackly; spreading itself like a prodigous weed. Despite the utter lack of anthropomorphic identifiers, I felt as if this thing were in some way sentient, as if I stared at a sinister intelligence come to wreak havoc upon my life.  

Intuition proved true. The thing, after streaking itself haphazardly across the ceiling and down the walls, spoke to me; it’s voice grave and sonically Tartarean:  

“You wished for oblivion. I would’ve given that to you, but you defied me. Reneged on our deal. You think *He* can protect you? While you are here on this Earth, you are up for grabs, as you’d say. This is as much my territory as His, in the bidding for souls. And now, I will grant you that wish, though not in the fashion you’d think.”  

Without waiting for a response from me—not that I would’ve been able to provide one in my thoughtless shock—a limb of that Stygian stalk shot out, impaling me in the forehead. There was a brief but unforgettable moment of searing, white-hot agony, and then my mind rebooted itself. I awoke on the floor sometime later, directly on the spot where there’d once been a smoking aperture to Hell itself.  

Knowing that the experience hadn’t simply been a hyper-real nightmare, but seeing no physical evidence of it having occurred, I went to the bathroom to wash my face off and give my mind some more time to accept what had happened. It was then that I saw the strange rune that had been seared into my forehead by the mind-probing tendril. To try and describe its shape would be futile; I've never seen anything like it, and doubt that any artist could truly replicate its form and style. It’s one of those things that can only be seen, but never described or reproduced regardless of how faithful an attempt to do so may be.  

Wanting—desperately needing—a bit of fresh air, I left my apartment. It wasn’t until I tried to buy a pack of gum at a stall that I noticed my sudden anonymity. I asked the vendor for a pack, but he provided no response; and even dealt with another customer immediately behind me. As politely as I could, I tried to interrupt the two men, but neither paid me any mind. Frustrated, I walked away, and on a crypitc hunch, asked a passerby for the time. They seemed to ignore me as well, as if they hadn’t heard me.  

After a few more tests of this nature I realized that I was invisible—that I'd been rendered totally inconspicuous. Not physically immaterial, as was testified by the fact that I hadn’t slipped through the Earth upon waking. But otherwise, undetectable by my fellow human beings. The dark irony of the situation nearly sent me falling to the floor; I’d been given my own dose of mundane oblivion: invisible to everyone, socially nonexistent. It wasn’t *thoughtless,* it wasn’t an enternal immateriality—but close enough, in a wicked trickster’s eyes.  

As I mentioned before, I can still physically interact with the real world, and have thus typed up this record of my experience. I guess it can serve as a warning to those who would make a deal with the devil and not follow through. If you’re gonna make such a foolish, existentially damning decision, at least get the job done.  

Perhaps that ambiguously identified third party can help me? Who knows. But I'd certainly take Heaven over this.
