Hello, I wanted to message because I realized my current situation has been weird. I have always been told by people that when you wake up in the middle of the night it was because someone was watching you, but that was always a childhood joke. Now I want to make it clear that this situation isn't just my problems with sleep, but I always feel like something is watching me. I've gone to people, but everyone just says I am paranoid. Hell one of my friends joked about me being a schitzo, but I know it has to be more than that. In order to not make this super long I am going to start on the first event.

My first encounter with odd things happening in my life had been when I was in middle school. My mom acts like this didn't happen and if I bring it up it is audibly denied. One day during class we got an assignment to write a card to people in the old homes asking them to tell us a story they had from their childhood. I wrote along with my class something like: My name is (blank) I go to (blank) and would love you to write back a story! About a week later we all got our letters back and most people only read theirs in order to do the paper on the assignment, but at the time I had gotten really into history and wanted to know about what cool things my elder wrote about. I remember ripping open the letter and inside was, to say the least, odd. I don't fully remember or have the letter but this is a long the lines of what it said:

Dear (my name), 

Thank you for writing to me. I decided to write to you something I have long tried to suppress, but who better to tell then the new youth. Now, when I was a teen I roamed the same streets as you, but back then there were less houses and a lot more of the woods you could explore. Now if you go down Weldhound Drive past what used to be a blue house there is a path behind it that leads to a beautiful creek. Me and my friends used to catch all kinds of things there. If my memory is right if you travel down the creek a while you'll find a old rope swing we had built. If you can tell me what was carved on the tree we left it on I will tell you some more cool places to explore.

Your New Friend,
Alex from (the name of the old person home)

I had told my teacher about it and she was eager to tell me to explore. I was extremely  excited since it was September in the south it hadn't gotten cold outside yet and it was a sunny day, so when I got home I told my mom I was going on a walk which wasn't out of the ordinary for me. When I got to Weldhound Drive, which was only two blocks from my house, it took me a few tries to find the dead end that had a rotted what looked like it used to be blue house. This house was dulled and molded. The roof was caving in and vines were surrounding it looking as if it could be swallowed up by nature any day now. The grass was over grown, and overall it was extremely unkempt.
