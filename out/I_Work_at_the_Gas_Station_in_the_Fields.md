Hello, Hola, Pryvit, and Bonjur.

I’m new to reddit, we just got modern internet where I’m at so this is all kinda new to me.

I guess I should start out with who I am. My name is Adam or Alex or something that begins with an A, I’ve been here too long to remember but that’s beside the point. I’m here to talk about my life as one of the two workers at my gas station.

I don’t know how I ended up here or what I was doing before this, but I’m here now and that’s all that matters.

On to the gas station. It looks like it’s ripped straight out of the 80s or 90s, it has those cheesy color patterns you see on the walls, and bright neon signs that light up the gas pumps. We have everything that has, is, or will ever existent. Our current store motto is.” If you can think it, we have it.” I always thought it was weird, because the station its self isn’t that big, but sure enough whenever we get The Customers coming through, they find everything they want or need right here. They even have stuff I’ve never seen before, like a sphere that shows you knowledge that the human mind was never meant to see. Weird shit for Weird “people” and all of that.

Next up is the area I’m at, to be honest I couldn’t tell you where the fuck I’m at. The station is along a long road, that stretches seemingly forever in both directions. There are no towns or cities near us (at least not that Kelly or I know off), and the entire thing is situated in one big field. One time during the day I tried walking down the road, I think I got about a hundred miles in before I was placed back in the station. I will say this though the field is very pretty, me and Kelly sometimes have picnics on one of the hills before our shift begins. That’s about it in terms of the area outside the station parameter.

The gas stations parameter is the exact opposite. For one there’s the house out back, its completely fenced in. Kelly and I live there, its very modest with two bedrooms and one bath room, we also have a small garden going, mainly it’s just tomatoes, potatoes, and spinach. Then there’s the small pond to the left of the station, it has about every fish ever known, just don’t go out at night or it will drag you into the void.

Now finally we can talk about my work day. According to the Owner were supposed to be on clock all hours of the day, however during the day the gas station is pretty much self-service so were able to do whatever we want, but we just end up sleeping most of the time. In a typical shift I get to sit at the counter drinking coke and playing my Super Epsilon on the Shitty CRT TV next to the counter, or I just restock and clean the store.

 

Overall, super simple. There is one rule, we can never go out front after 10PM.I don’t know why we can’t but from what Kelly’s told me, the Field Folk will take any worker they see and drag em away. That’s properly why we have a weapons locker in the employee office full of military grade M16s and night vision goggles.

One last thing before I end this post. They’re only 7 People who visit the gas station regularly. Mr. and Mrs. Jones and their son Thomas. They typically come in at around 2 or 3PM in their 1973 ford pickup and buy a full tank of gas, 16 beers, and a pack of gummy worms. They don’t talk, but they’re faces always show a very deep sadness.

Then there’s Lynol Hemsworth, he’s the exact opposite very boastful and eccentric, he typically rides in on his horse at 4PM , while wearing his explores outfit with a saber on his hip, he’ll typically get about 2 pounds of hay, 7 boxes of 577-450 Ammo, and a bottle of brandy all the while talking your ear off with his think accent.

Then there’s Homeless Craig he lives in a tent across the street, but he only comes out at night. He’ll typically get 2 books related to Quantum Physics or 18^(th) century Russian literature, A bottle of Merlot, and wagyu beef from Kobe. For a homeless guy he speaks very eloquently however he does say weird shit sometimes about how “The owner isn’t who we think he is.” or that “There’s a town not far away.” Weird dude.

Next is the Witch, she’ll typically just pop out of the women’s toilet at any time of the day to get some eye of newt, or bird beaks, normal witch stuff. She’s super nice though and even gave me a random potion, I’m still on the fence if I should drink it or not.

Lastly is Kevin ,he’s probably the most normal customer we have. He’s just some dude from Pheonix, he’ll typically get a pack of reds, a 15 dollar scratcher, and 50 on the deiseal for his lifted truck, he also never stops talking about “This will be the years the Cardinals win the Superbowl.”

That’s it, that’s a day in my life. Theres too much for me to list here, but I might share some more later if any of y’all are interested. Anway I got to go load up my rifle, the Field Folk are trying to get in again.
