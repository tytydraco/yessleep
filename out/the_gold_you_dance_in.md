Catalina swiftly spins and swirls in the air. Her hands following her body as her green dress dripped out in gold accents follow her movements.The music guiding her through every step she makes on the dance floor. Every key on the piano making a beautiful note that makes her sing along to the melody, as her priceless, gold jewelry sways along with her.



Catalina was an elegant beautiful woman with a tall form and slim shoulders, with her olive skin gleaming in the moonlight. Oh how Catalina loved to dance. Her back bent to every tune of the piano. The love she had for her blond hair as it swayed with her in the moonlight. That's where she met my father. He held her hand ever so gracefully, so politely while asking her to dance. Catalina didnt remove the disgusted expression on her face, until Alejandro lifted his face and she saw him. She noticed his beautiful hazel eyes, his thick brows smiling alongside his teeth, and his ever-so-manicured hands revealing his wealth. 



Being as shallow and vile as she was she dipped down into a polite courtesy and followed him. And with the soft melody playing in the background she followed him blindly, entranced by his smile, and soft hands. He took her outside, in the brightness of the moonlight and they danced. Letting the chirping of the crickets lead their bodies, using them as their melody. As they swayed she thought Alejandro reminded her of *Arturo.* Her now late father. The way his lips curled into a smile every time her eyes gleamed, patted her on the back to comfort her and guided her like her father.



She still didnt love him*.* Even if he’d kill himself for her, she needed to know he was worth something to her. She then glanced at his thick, gold watch and fell in love with him. She loved his soft, warm breath, and his smooth hair. 



This is the story my mom tells me. This is the story that never helped me fall in love with love. I fell in love with gold. The gold in my hair. The gold in my wrists, and the gold in my heart. But never in love. “That’s why we named you Baila, meaning dance, it is something i fell in love with when I met your father. Every time i say your name I don’t think of dance I think of love. The love that never once was if not for Baila”.



The story my papi tells me is the same version of events but completely different views. While making pottery he says, “The ballroom felt like a tenebrous void. Until I met your mother. She was like a sublime light in the dark ballroom. She lit up the room with every step she took every time her hips twisted. I loved her right when I saw her. I still love her and she loves me”. He never went much into detail about leading her into the moonlight. Or her cunning smile after seeing his face and watch



I don’t blame her. She was destitute. She used to joke about living just like the cockroaches scurrying on the floor of her apartment, where she lived, with her father and 12 siblings, 6 of whom floated into the wind because of disease. As for my father, the word destitute wasn’t even in his vocabulary. Even in a basic t-shirt and slippers, he reeked of money. Trust fund baby, golden spoon, diamond spoon, now that's in his vocabulary



Friday is when the distribution of the perfect life that my mother, Catalina built shattered. You can never build a relationship out of greed and she never understood the weight of the effects that looking at his watch would've done. The gold jewelry is nowhere to be found on her desk. The jewelry that swayed her the first night she met my father gone. No longer seeing my father because of late-night work shifts. And I am no longer winning anything in my life.



Her perfect life was shattered



Why did he take it? He had no reason to. Couldn't you have bought another one? Alejandro, you took my heart and twisted it removing the liquid from it. You removed the liquid gold in my heart. Alejandro, why? I have done nothing but love you as my father. I loved you and still do, even though every night I dig my fingernails in the dry parts of my knee and I squeeze until the smell of liquid metal comes oozing out. Alejandro, Mom knows but she loves the liquid gold oh so much. Instead of putting the heart back in my chest she soaked the liquid gold from the floor and sold it. My name can no longer be Baila. Because that woman always lied my entire life. She fed the lies to me. Baila for her doesn't mean love. It means money. Without her money, Baila is nothing to her. I am nothing to her.



What is even gold to him? Gold is like water to him. Gold is like paper to him. I’d always known him as a sweet kind man. Yes a little spoiled but he was still my father and he was mine. 



The jewelry her father died for. The jewelry that he stole. For her. For Catalina. Alejandro should go to her papa’s grave and apologize. He’s going to say sorry to my grave since I'm dead to him. He didn’t need to blame me. His own daughter. Accuse me of something that I would have never done. Catalina didn’t choose to believe me. I’m not the one with the money.



After getting thrown out. *Forever.* I let the metal plate on my shoulders slip down and punch my heart. The heaving pain of running until i lose my mind. The water spilling out of my eyelids is the remaining gold I have left. The only thing to remind me of my home. The loss of my parent's love and affection knocks my skull and makes me realize I am alone in this tenebrous world where I have not even the dust on the ground to support my pain. To support the tears heaving on my eyelids. Did Catalina not think that I knew what Papa did to the gold? That he sold it to his lover. Throwing her daughter out on false accusations to cope with the pain of losing the only thing that her father could give her. Her father didn't even bother to give her a heart.



Alejandro, you thought I didn't know I wasn’t your only child



*When you are young they assume you know nothing*
