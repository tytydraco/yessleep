I love watching ghost hunting shows, to the point where I bought an EMF reader a while back for funsies. I’d been dying to go ghost hunting, and my perfect opportunity finally arrived!  

My friends and I caught wind of an abandoned children’s insane asylum about 2 hours away that wasn’t patrolled by police or security, so it was easy to sneak into. We planned our excursion for Friday night, and I could barely sleep all week I was so excited. The drive there was smooth and we got super stoned while jamming out to music to make the time pass. We pulled in a few minutes shy of midnight and ran excitedly to the building.  

My heart was pounding with anticipation as we entered. The building had 5 floors, and the bottom level looked like a frat house. Graffiti lined the walls and empty beer cans littered the floor. It was kind of lame, so we decided to head to the 4th floor. You see, the 5th floor of the asylum was where the most mentally ill children were kept, so we figured let’s just get closer to the good stuff.  

It’s dark. Much darker than the 1st floor. It feels colder too. We start slowly walking down the hallway and I think to turn my EMF reader on. It crackles and crackles but reads nothing. We’re peeking in rooms as we walk down a hallway. There’s old, dusty medical beds, forgotten medical equipment, random garbage. We come to what looks like used to be a dining area, and suddenly I hear a beep! I pull my reader out of my pocket, adjusting the volume when we hear a faint children’s giggle come through. We all froze, staring wide-eyed at each other and just as I looked down, a red kick ball came rolling slowly past us.  

A couple of my friends started panicking, but I had to see the 5th floor. I urged them forward and it’s a decision I’ll regret forever. We make our way up and through the halls. These rooms are different. The medical beds have chain and leather restraints still attached. The air is thick, like it’s almost hard to breathe. We make our way to a corridor and find the old building’s elevator. One of the group, my best friend, walked over to it with me to check it out. The doors were missing, so we curiously looked inside the open elevator shaft and the elevator itself looked to be way down at the bottom level.  

I started to feel dizzy, so I took a step back. A sudden cool breeze hit the back of my neck but after that, everything went black. I came to on the floor with my friend’s pale, horrified faces looking down at me. I broke out in a cold sweat and stared at them, confused. “WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!?” one of them shouted. I noticed that someone’s face was missing and looked towards the elevator shaft. Instantly, I realized what happened. I pushed him. I pushed my best friend down the elevator shaft. I felt the blood drain from my face and just as I felt like I was about to vomit, it all went black again….
