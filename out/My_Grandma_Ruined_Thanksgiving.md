First off excuse my poor grammar. I’m kind of in a tight situation. I’m in tears and trembling Luckily things have been silent so I’ll start from the beginning. If I’m going to die I want people to know the whole story.  
  
Thanksgiving was a family favorite holiday. Endless food, football to watch with the family, and sometimes there was even snow on the ground. Mom and Dad usually fight but Thanksgiving was the one day they actually got along.  
  
And it was genuine too, not like they were just faking it or something. Uncle Tony, my dad’s brother, and Aunt Rita always brought their cranberry sauce and sweet potatoes. Their daughters Bailey, 7, and Jessica, 16, were like siblings since I was an only child. Especially Jessica since she was the same age as me.  
  
Then there was my mom’s brother Jerry… well he was really the only negative of the whole day. Jerry was… well to be honest a deadbeat. He has 1 kid, who he never sees. Used to beat his ex girlfriend. Well ex girlfriends, he has a history, but I’m talking about the mother of his child specifically. She ran away with the kid years ago. He was about 7 at the time.   
  
Shame I never see my only other cousin anymore but honestly I’m just glad he’s safe. We all know he  just shows up for a free meal, but mom won’t turn him away. Still holding out hope for her brother I guess. My parents used to fight over it almost daily but my dad just kinda gave up.   
  
He never physically or emotionally hurt any of us so I guess he didn’t wanna waste his energy on it anymore. Anyway, enough diverging. It was now just the 8 of us on Thanksgiving. It used to be 10, a full house I know. My grandma and grandpa on my mom’s side  used to come every year. My grandpa passed years ago. It was extremely hard on the family, but my grandma took it the hardest.  
  
 Her health over the years really just deteriorated after that point. She lives in a nursing home now that can take care of her. We still visit her every thanksgiving though. It really makes her day, and seeing her happy like that honestly makes mine too. But anyway the day was just beginning. We were watching the parade, the dog show, the usual. Jerry showed up, sadly, about 3 hours after everyone else. So now the 8 of us are sitting in the living room and we hear a knock.  
  
 I go and answer and it’s my grandma. My grandma who’s supposed to be dying. “What the hell?” I think. I shrug off any thoughts of confusion and embrace her. “Grandma, it’s so great to see you!” Everyone else in the room hears this and drops what they’re doing.  
  
Except Jerry of course. Couldn’t be bothered to see his own mom. My mom quickly welcomes her in to the home.  “Mom, how-how did you make it here?” My grandma explained that she was doing much better and the staff let her out for the holiday. “Well I was doing better, and they just let me out, simple as that dear”.  
  
The day just got a whole lot better in my eyes. She usually had that affect on thanksgiving. She came in and said she had to use the bathroom. Well I guess being old does that, so she excused herself.   
  
Jessica was the only one who seemed concerned. She lead me to the kitchen while everyone talked about grandma and asked me “Wasn’t grandma in a wheelchair not three weeks ago?”   
  
Hmm. That was odd but sometimes people make recoveries. “I mean I guess. But she probably got better, right? Simple as that”. Then we saw something on the table a pink paper that had not been there when we went in.   
  
“What’s this?” I said. We went over and looked at the paper. It was a list. “Maybe a recipe?” Asked Jessica. I picked it up and read aloud “Grandmas Rules. These rules are essential to survive-”. Jessica cut me off right there. “Oh, hell no, I’ve seen this on Tik Tok and Reddit”. I had no idea what she was talking about, but I kept going.   
  
Grandmas Rules. These rules are essential if you are to survive grandmas visit. She has gone to the bathroom for 30 minutes. You MUST read these rules. These lists have appeared in every room in people with it. That is not your grandma. It’s- well it doesn’t matter what it is right now, the most important thing is surviving.   
  
Rule 1: Do NOT let her see these lists. She doesn’t know you have them. I’ve worked extremely hard to get these lists to you please don’t ruin it.  
  
Rule 2: You must eat everything Grandma gives you. Only her food, however.  
  
Rule 3: You must not ask her why she took so long in the bathroom. Trust me, you don’t wanna know anyway.  
  
Rule 4: Don’t ask her when she is leaving.   
  
Rule 5: Be kind and polite. Don't upset her.   
  
Rule 6: You must not ask about her health.  
  
There are only six rules you need to follow. But if any one of you breaks a rule, I don’t know what will happen. Maybe she’ll just dispose whoever broke the rule? Maybe she’ll dispose of everyone? I don’t know. Good luck. You’ll hear from me again if you survive.  
  
“What the fuck?” I spoke. I’m assuming the rest of the family had seen their list too because I heard more wtf from the living room. Jessica looked me and the eyes and said “there’s no way this a joke. I’ve seen things like this online, we got to do what it says”.  
 She’s always been the superstitious one of the bunch but for some reason I believed her. I mean, she was supposed to die soon, how is she walking? We went to the next room, and they didn’t have the same thoughts. My mom was furious at us thinking we did this.  
  
 Jessica pleaded with them to listen, but they wouldn’t have it. To them it was a prank. Now, I didn’t even know what to think. One moment I was happy to see her, now I’m dreading her coming out of the bathroom. I mean… the lists. They just appeared out of nowhere. Everyone was discussing it when Grandma came out of the bathroom. Exactly 30 minutes later. Jessica wasn’t fuckin around; she hid the lists in her pocket and went quiet.   
  
The day went on awkwardly. Everyone was on edge, like deep down the knew the list might be real. It was like this for an hour until Jerry eventually asked “aye ma, so how is it that you’re walking around and stuff? Weren’t you basically crippled?” Fuck. Everyone kind of stopped what they were doing. For starters, rude as hell. Secondly, he broke a damn rule.  
  
 “Grandma” just looked at him and before we knew it, his head was gone. She’d devoured it instantly. Just. Like. That. “OH FUCK” Rita screamed before she was…silenced.  
  
 I guess it only took one person to break a rule for her to go feral. She began to twist and contort into something I can’t even describe. In 30 seconds, it went from awkward to a straight up nightmare.  
  
 The thing… it. It started attacking the rest of us. Mom, Dad. Uncle Tony. They were closest to her in proximity, and it didn’t take long for them to get cut down. I didn’t even have time to think, I just ran.   
  
Cowardly I know. But I ran. Luckily Jessica was right behind me, and she had Bailey by the arm. We ran upstairs into the bedroom and locked the door. We’re hiding in the closet right now, and I think it’s gone. Maybe it left? Idk but it’s been silent, and I’ve had time to wright this.   
  
Bailey doesn’t understand what’s going on and we are struggling to keep her silent. Me and Jessica are silently sobbing to ourselves. It’s been hours and I want to scream for my parents. For them to come back. But I know. That thing killed them.  
  
Fuck. I can’t type anymore I think I heard something. It sounded like my grandma's voice. I got to go but if anything is reading this, please send help. For the love of God please.
