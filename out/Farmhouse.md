When I graduated, a friend asked if I wanted to come play music with some friends in Toronto before I left to teach ESL in Korea. He got me a decent job doing AV work at an old hotel downtown with his crew, so even before I got my physical diploma, we’d packed everything into my 2006 Sunfire and drove from Newfoundland to Toronto in 2 days.  
The Korea plan was bullshit, by the way. I didn't care what I did after I graduated; I was tired of reading, I needed a break, and at least in Toronto we’d play some shows, I'd make a little money, and meet some new buds along the way. I was in my 20s and I had access to my student loans for another month.   
We started the band pretty fast—I wrote a bunch of songs for my own ep and the fellers liked them enough to want to get play shows, padding the set with some covers, some indie punky nonsense, playing Blondie, Rihanna, Ty Segall covers. The whole band (Macky, Doug, Stein, and me) all worked at this hotel downtown built before the turn of the last century.  
Sidenote, our storage was underground and had this blocked off door behind some old hall speakers. Old hotels are all like this, pristine where it counts but look like bombed out hospitals beyond the staff only doors. We wedged open that blocked off door once and found it led directly into the sewer system below the street. Cool to discover, the old rusted out chambers seemed to go on forever, and as a Ninja Turtles fan growing up, I definitely have an affinity for grimy spaces like that, but there were a lot of times you’d be hanging in storage by yourself between events late at night, the air pressure would change with the subway coming into King Station a block away, push the door open a crack, and plenty of times it sounded like something was breathing just out of sight. That feeling of being watched made my skin crawl.  
Anyway, when I started at the hotel I was part time for the first month, so I had time to write, time to get high, and I still had the Sunfire so I spent a lot of time just cruising around our neighborhood—it was the end of August so it was hot and lazy. 1000% what I needed.  
Mack had a two bedroom in the west end north of Little Portugal with his (at the time) friend, Huntsy. Absolute garbage; years after all of this we found out Hunter stole Macks rent cash for coke a couple months before he disappeared. Such a dumb shit. Back then though, his coke habit was still in the party phase which meant his bed was free a few nights a week, and on the nights it wasn't, Stein and I shared the combined living room/kitchen. 4 twenty-somethings crammed into this basement apartment with a cat they called Bananas.  
We did that for the first 3 months I was in Toronto, the first 2 weeks of which Stein and me would switch out who got the floor and who got the love seat until it got to a point where we realized both of us preferred the floor and would each take one loveseat cushion. Needless to say, between the 4 of us, we were all actively trying to find good excuses not to be home all the time.  
So one night we’re at this afterparty. If my social anxiety wasn’t so brutal I'd have been trying to hook up with somebody to go home with. For instance, Stein found a girl on tinder in October sometime and started staying at her place now and then (both cushions mine on those nights; full on luxurious). Anyway, a friend’s band had played a great show and the guitarist had half the crowd over to his townhouse off Queen West and I was already planning to pass out on a couch if the opportunity availed itself.  
That night I was battling the anxiety hard with darts (cigarettes), just chainsmoking Canadian Classics. Rachelle popped out and we started talking about Ru Pauls Drag Race, I was tankered and saying Ru Paul was the Professor X of the LGBTQ community:  
‘They’ve brought together all these people that dont neatly fit into society and has given them support to accentuate their secret powers—Drag Race IS X-Men’  
…something like that, it was fuzzy and dumb.   
Anyway, we’re laughing about dumb shit and at some point I asked her if she believed in ghosts. Back when I bartended it was a great way to get silly spooky stories out of people and gauge their beliefs to a certain degree. Little cringe looking back and for a lot of reasons, I stopped asking people after this.  
She told me about this group of friends in high school out in rural ontario, out where the german farmland is, way the fuck out. It was one of those haunted highway legends: you drive down this one road just after sundown, weird things happen. Sort of thing you could swap out ghosts, aliens, cryptids etc. for whatever else, good spooky fodder. She said they all dismissed it, but avoided the stretch all the same. Supposedly, if you caught it at the right time, your radio signal would drop out and in the static you'd hear some low bassy tonal pattern in the hazy frequencies, some people hearing faraway voices crackling through.   
Anyway, if you made it to the end of the road, you'd come upon this gated wooden fence, the fence would lead down a short trail, the trail to a wooden bridge over a small river, from the bridge the trail would lead to these overhanging trees that linked together overhead blocking out the sky shaped like a keyhole. On the other side of that thicket, there would be a field, a massive wheat field, and in the field would be an old farmhouse, a farmhouse that wasn't there during the day.   
I'm not sure what the deal with the farmhouse is, but a few weeks before she graduated, Chelle and her buds got brave and went out. She said there were two cars full of kids, 7 or 8 of them, and they were set to hit the McDons in the town over after they went out to the gate. So the two cars started out.  
It was all innocent, the sort of ‘let’s get the Ouija board out’ teenage spook ‘em up that passes the time. The cars rolled around the corner of this little dirt road and started down. Chelle was in the car behind and as soon as they rounded the corner, the fella driving the car ahead just took off, kicking up dust and disappearing around a bend in the road ahead. They laughed and rolled their eyes; teenage boys are idiots. They were listening to AM radio to increase the spook factor when it happened.  
The signal dropped. No tonal pattern, no faraway voices, but their signal was gone. Letting it hiss quietly the girls were giggling as the farmland stretched out on either side of the lazily winding road ahead. The road was oddly narrow, tall pines having been planted in sequence acting as a barrier between the rolling fields and the road. The dust from the lead car had settled, the twilight fading into night, the drive was short enough and after an hour the girls arrived at the old dilapidated  gate, but their friends were nowhere to be seen.  
Chelle said when they pulled up, they were alone which didn’t make any sense. There weren’t any other roads off the stretch they were on, no driveways, just a straight shot and nothing else. If the other car had turned around they would have crossed paths, but what do you do in situations like this? You try to freak out your friends, so almost immediately they started coming up with theories.  
‘Maybe the road got them’  
‘Maybe we died in a crash and this is purgatory’  
‘Maybe one of us is insane and you’re just imagining us’   
The giddiness turned to boredom as they waited until one of the guys flicked on a flashlight and hopped out. They started daring one another to go past the gate. Chelle said she was a little shit and started goading the boys in the car to go further and further.   
‘Trevor, I bet you can’t make it to the bridge’  
Trevor’s eyebrow raised, he grabbed the flashlight and started down the trail. He didn’t return. At most the bridge was a 5 minute walk past the gate, so after 15 minutes they were in a panic. Still no sign of the other car and now Trevor was gone. Chelle and the others collectively gulped, clicked on their cell phone torches and inched past the gate toward the bridge.  
‘It’s not funny Trevor!’ They started calling to him, and then the bridge came into view, the rushing water beneath drowning out their calls. It was still, the sky bright from the moon, Chelle remarked that it was calm on the bridge.   
‘RAH!’ Trevor jumped out of the bushes, the flashlight under his chin. The girls screamed and he started cackling. After berating him, telling him to go fuck himself etc. they hung out on the bridge a while, the early summer wind blowing through the forest. Having come this far they figured, well why not? Let’s go see if the farmhouse is really there.   
They made it to the keyhole of overhanging trees that seemed to extend a little too far, on edge the entire way until they got to the edge of the forest, finding themselves looking out into a wheat field, the moon huge above, and sure enough, silhouetted on the horizon was a farmhouse. The farmhouse that wasn’t there in the daylight.  
They stopped, Chelle saying she felt sick. How was this not bullshit. They’d been down this trail plenty of times over the years. In the winter they’d come out and slid on the hills back here. The farmhouse was just dumb legend, but she looked at me with this intensity.  
‘It was there that night. I can’t explain it at all, but it was there, and when we went back a few years later it was gone. Just like it’d been every other time we’d ever gone there.’  
Trevor started running through the field toward the farmhouse and the little crew followed, but this was one of the weirder parts of the story, she said Trevor eventually ran out of breath and they all caught up to him, and so there they were just trudging through the wheat for what seemed like 20 minutes and when they looked up, it was as if they were no closer to the farmhouse at all. They were a little ways away from the edge of the forest, but could still easily make out the keyhole back to the trail. They commented on it and walked another 10 minutes until they realized they were essentially in the same spot, like they were walking on a treadmill.   
Chelle said at that point they kind of gave up on the whole thing. No one was dressed for a hike and aside from Trevor, everyone just wanted to get back, so they started back to the woods. In through the dark overhang they started joking a bit and eventually made it back to the bridge, but not before they saw it.   
Trevor at the back of the pack said something like, “Fuck that” and just started sprinting back to the car. When they looked back to the overhanging trees, back quite a ways, obscured by the darkness, stood in the middle of the trail stood a tall figure, glaring at the group.   
At first frozen, the crew weren’t sure what to do, aside from staying quiet, when the figure took a step toward them. As soon as it moved the group followed Trevor lead and took off back to the car. Trevor had it started and as soon as they were in they took off down the dirt road at full speed, everyone out of breath.   
Back to the line of trees and the outstretched fields the radio crackled back to life, the mix of AM static, multiple signal mingling, dead voices from the ether breaking through until suddenly the signal cleared and their phones all collectively started buzzing and pinging with messages from the crew in the other car.  
‘Where are you guys?’  
‘Helloooo’  
‘Where did you guys go?’  
‘Are you even coming?’  
‘Fuck it, we’ll see you guys at McDons’  
What had happened was unexplainable and by the time they pulled into the McDonalds parking lot they’d calmed down and started to rationalize everything. Chelle said the guys in the other group all had the same story, that her group just disappeared behind them at a certain point, that they waited at the gate for like 20 minutes waiting for them and when Trevor’s car didn’t show up they just started back to the McDonalds thinking Chelle’s crew got too spooked and turned around.  
‘That’s probably the only time I’d say, like, anything paranormal happened to me. We went out a few days later and everything was there except for the farmhouse, but the whole time, even in the light of day, it felt like we were being watched.’ She shuttered, ‘gives me the heebie jeebies thinking about it.’  
I told her about the handful of other stories people had told me over the years, but I’ve always been a skeptic of paranormal stuff, so for me, that and the occult was novel but explainable. Like, there’s that whole thing about ghost sightings having a major influx in the 19th century, just as gas lamps were being introduced into households. Turns out ghost sightings and carbon monoxide poisoning share a ton of similarities.  
Anyway, the night went on, I passed out on buddy’s couch and the next week or so I was just living this part time AV tech, post grad, end of summer lifestyle, living out of a suitcase, sleeping on Mack’s living room floor, playing music when we had the chance, and so on, but I couldn’t get Chelle’s story out of my head, so one night I messaged her.  
‘Where is the gate? Can you pin it and send it to me? I want to go.’  
‘That’s fucked, don’t do that.’  
We went back and forth for a little while until she said something like ‘Your funeral’ and sent a screenshot of the inlet road. ‘Be careful dude… I know what I saw’  
A few days later, I jumped in my Sunfire and started the two hour drive north. What a fucking mistake.  
To get me in the mood I popped this movie soundtrack Sonic Youth had done for some horror movie in the 80s. And after stopping off for road snacks and bopping along, my google maps started redirecting me in weird directions. Like, routing me seemingly away from where I was headed. I followed it to a tee and it led me to the highway overpass that was under construction. If I’d followed it blindly I would have driven straight into a 30 foot deep pit. So instead I had to find another way around. I seriously drove in circles and kept coming to dead ends until finally, around 2pm I figured a way from one dirt road, through what looked like someone's property, back onto a stretch that led me to the inlet.  
Driving out, sure enough, there was the row of trees. All in a line on both sides of the road, spaced evenly just spaced enough that they wouldn’t quite hedge. The regularity of their spacing was uncanny and didn’t leave any room to pull off on the shoulders, but I kept driving along. I flipped the radio over to the AM signal and a country station hummed out some Waylon Jennings hits as I rolled along. Sure enough my cell phone signal started disappearing, but the radio signal was strong and after a while I finally made it to the end of the road, and sure enough, there was the wooden gate.  
Dilapidated was an understatement. The wood was rotted away, the hinges on the gate rusted and crumbling, I started down the path. The bridge was moss covered and beaten down but well built, and there in the distance, sure enough, were the big overhanging trees, leaned to make a keyhole through the woods. 5 minutes later I was on the edge of a wheat field. The horizon was wide, the sky enormous, the sounds of chickadees and running water, the soft tidal swells of wheat swaying in the wind made the moment incredibly peaceful, but there was no farmhouse. I stood for a while there, turned and went back to my car. I’d return after sunset.  
I took a few pictures of the gate, sent them to Chelle, and her response was not the most positive.  
‘What the fuck dude, you actually went?’  
‘Yeah, it’s really peaceful out here — now to see if the haunted farmhouse comes out after dark muahuhahahaha’  
‘That’s fucked. Leave man. So dumb. Just like Trevor.’  
I went for a bite at the MacDonalds a little ways away, killing some time, filling up on gas, when I asked this gas station clerk if he’d heard of this haunted farmhouse etc. and the steely glare I got back should have told me everything I needed to know.  
‘Lots of people drive off the road down there for no reason. Lots of folks gone missing around there over the years. Best to keep clear. Bad juju all the way around.’  
’Sure, but you don’t actually believe it do you?’  
‘Best not to go lookin’ for things you don’t wanna find’  
Re-fueled on snacks and gas, the day slipping away, I started back to the road. Routing through the dirt road, through the private property, finding the inlet and parking to watch the sun set over the fields around me at the crossroads. I smoked another cigarette and listened to the AM radio crackling, the warm summer air cooling as the light dipped below the horizon. Flicking my cigarette, I hopped back into my driver's seat, turned up the radio, and put the car into drive.  
The road seemed narrower than before. The trees on the shoulders leaning in over the road. I chuckled to myself, ‘spooky stuff.’ Headlights from another car crowned around a turn up ahead, coming on super fast. I flashed my high beams to indicate theirs were on, but they continued, completely blinding me.   
As they approached it was apparent we were going to crash head on, they were almost entirely in my lane, forcing me to swerve. I clenched my jaw trying to thread between these headlights and the tree line. Whipping past, they blared their horn. I couldn’t make out the figures in the car, only their tail lights in the kicked up dust through my rearview.   
I stopped my car and breathed, turning the radio down, lighting another cigarette, wondering why the fuck I was out here in the first place. What a dumb way to get your kicks… but I pressed on. Another 10 minutes down the road the radio cut out, not to static, to dead silence. I was so zoned in, I barely registered when I finally came upon the gate.  
‘Alright.’ I exhaled to myself. Clicked on my headlamp and started down the trail I’d been on mere hours before. The first thing I noticed was how much quieter it was at night. No birdsong, no scampering chipmunks, just stillness and the river ahead. I walked along listening carefully, past the bridge, through the overhanging trees, until I was standing back on the edge of the wheat field.  
I swear to fucking god. It was there. This two storey farmhouse up on the crest of the hill, silhouetted by the moonlight. Matching Trevor’s energy I shrugged and started into the field. Walking for 20 minutes, I was away from the treeline and getting out of breath when I stopped and looked up.   
That’s when I saw it.  
This silhouetted figure walked out on the porch. The glow of a cigarette ember illuminating the figure only enough to make out its inhuman features. I froze and just watched as the figure gazed out into the field, one puff after another, until it extinguished the cigarette under its heel. That’s when it started into wheat directly toward me.  
I instinctively ducked down and started inching back to the forest at that point. Everything felt weird, disconnected like a dream, it felt unsafe. Back to the keyhole, there was no sign of anything, looking to the horizon, I took one last look at the farmhouse, the figure nowhere to be seen, I breathed a sigh of relief and started back toward my car, checking the path behind me all the way.  
I was speed walking and when I got to the bridge I could feel its eyes. Spinning around I expected the figure to be stood in the path, but nothing. I jogged back to my car, locked the doors, started the engine, and closed my eyes for a second, catching my breath. When I opened my eyes, it was there in my rearview, obscured by my exhaust, I could only make out its tall form and its terrible eyes, red in my brake lights.  
Jamming it into drive, I sprayed rocks behind me as I peeled away into the night, the figure fading into the darkness. I was driving way too fast for the little road, but every part of my psyche was screaming. The radio cracked back to life, these low dreadful tones eking through the manic chattering as I scrambled for the volume knob, tears forming in my eyes. Silent in the car I took another breath, still driving as fast as my little sunfire would take me when in my periphery I saw movement in my rearview mirror. Focusing, there was nothing. I looked back to the road ahead when I heard it breathing behind me. Suddenly ahead I could see headlights. In my panic I’d drifted into their lane and at the last second laid on the horn as I  pulled my car back to my side.  
As soon as I was past them, the breathing stopped. The radio was softly playing Merle Haggard and I made it back to the crossroads. I drove silent and slow all the way back to the city, the Am radio coming and going as it pleased, my single loveseat cushion waiting for me on the living room rug back in Mack’s basement apartment.  
I haven’t been able to shake it ever since. Any time I’m alone its red eyes are still on me, it’s breath close and distant simultaneously, and when I messaged Chelle a few days later she said the same thing. Whether it’s mental or whatever, that thing is just there, waiting for its chance.
