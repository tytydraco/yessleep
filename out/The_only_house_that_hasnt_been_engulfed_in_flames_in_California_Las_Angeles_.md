A couple of months ago a group of 3 witches moved into California in some broken down 5 bedroom house. From the very first week they were causing trouble and they would wake their neighbours up from their loud rituals. The witches got into arguments with many people and they cursed their neighbours. They summoned demons and they had people possessed. People stayed clear from them after a while and they allowed them to do what they want, in fear of being bewitched. There was always rumours about the 3 witches and the things they did. Nobody wanted them around. 

Then the fires started in Los Angeles California. The fires ravaged through homes and area like it was nothing. The fires don't discriminate from rich or poor, all are equal to the fires. Death toll is still rising and even though the 3 witches house are in the middle of the fires, their house isn't burning down. You can hear laughter coming from that house and they are doing spells on the fire, to control it. They are even doing spells to control the dead who have been afflicted by the fire. Their house is completely fine and uncompleted untouched by the fire. 

Some have entered the house as refuge from the fire, but they never came out. Those that did come out weren't the same and were clearly bewitched. There is only one way to take down these witches and the house. It's by going inside the house and lighting it up from the inside. There is magic around the outside but if someone can carry fire inside the house, that would be great. It's just awful that we have these fires engulfing las Angeles, but now we have some witches that are causing trouble within the fires. 

Fire kills witches but causing another fire will only make the fire situation worse. No wonder the witches came here and they must have known something like this was about to happen. Who ever causes fire inside the witches house will surely be arrested, and nobody will believe it. I mean their house is completely untouched by the fire and the other houses have all consumed by it. The witches aren't coming outside but they are safe inside th house. It just takes one person to go into that house and set the witches on fire, which will undo the magic done by them. 

Sometimes I can see figures within the fires that are close to the witches house. They are the guards for the witches house. One guy tried to enter the witches house to burn it, then one of the firey figures consumed him and the witches laughter could be heard. To consume the witches house on fire will add to the problem of the fire all around las Angeles. The fire wouldn't even touch their house and everyone is too distracted to even take notice of how intact the witches house are, even though all this fire is around us. 

There is nothing we can do.
