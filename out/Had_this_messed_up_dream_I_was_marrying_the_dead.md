So I saw this video on tiktok where they say that if you're getting married in a dream you're marrying the dead or something around those lines. 

I 18M now, had this dream back around the year 2020 or so where I was getting married with this girl, I'm not really sure what she looked like but the thing that was messed up was that she actually looked dead, like you could see her bones and a bit of flesh kind of similar to the cartoon called "Corpse Bride" which I'm sure some of y'all have seen. 

The dream continued and for some reason I actually felt like I was in love with this girl (i know desperate much smh) and in that same dream my family was trying to ruin my marriage with her but I was telling them I was in love and all those dumb reasons, even though they tried to break off the marriage, I remembered we moved from place to place trying to find somewhere peaceful to get married since my family always got in the way. I honestly don't know what was going through my mind at that time but I really did have a whole life with this corpse even though I knew she was one I was still madly in love and when I woke up that early morning around 2-3 it was hard to go back to sleep since the atmosphere in my room felt a bit off (kind of like you we're being watched) but that was one dream I won't be forgetting. 

Also note when I said "I really did have a whole life with this corpse" I didn't mean family as with kids lol just to make sure we're all on the same page here. Sometimes I wonder why I even had that dream in the first place and no it's not that I was desperate for a relationship or something and no it's not hard finding a relationship for myself I'm a pretty decent looking guy I'd say at least a 7/10 I was only single at that time because I wasn't really into having a whole relationship thing and would rather just play it off as "close friends" instead. 

Fast foward to when I found that tiktok video a year later, I was creeped out about it. First of all I remembered the dream which means there was a reason like people always say and second the tiktok saying "getting married in your dream means your marrying the dead" but what if I'm already married to this dead smh, who knows if she's probably still watching me right now, I know this sounds like one messed up hilarious dream though but damn she better not haunt my future bride lol. (Also yes I know tiktok can be making things up, but just saying this is one messed up dream I won't be forgetting)

After going through that dream it took me at least a few days until I was able to get rid of that weird feeling that I always had when I was sleeping but just thinking about it kind of just reminds me of those times when it did happen. 

I mean I do hope I'm not the only one that has been through the same situation such as this and please if you have, do say it in the comments so I know I'm not alone with this and hopefully share how your experience was when it did happen, if not then if any of you know exactly why I would have such a dream like this then please do explain. ðŸœ²
