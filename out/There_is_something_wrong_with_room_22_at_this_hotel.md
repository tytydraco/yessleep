I’m just a 22-year-old student finishing my honors. I stay with some relatives fairly close to my college. Its more convenient that way, as its closer than from home (which is like a 14-hour drive away).

It’s just my mom, sister and I so whatever chance I get (mostly semester holidays), I go spend it there with them. My girlfriend also lives close to where I normally stay so, I see her every time I visit home as well. I didn’t see them this year so far. I miss them.

I have four college friends and we all come from the same town down south. Luckily of the four of us, Brandon has a van which we use to go home. Kamesh, Connor and I just freeload with him at the back, while Jenna (Brandon’s girlfriend) sits in the front with him. Brandon is sweet so he doesn’t charge us anything. As he says: “I was going there anyways”. So, in return the three of us pay for the hotel room at Carinhill Hotel at the halfway stop.

(Maybe now should be the time I point out that none of my college friends actually knew me before college. Brandon, Connor and Jenna, all knew each other from their schooling days. Brandon and I met at campus one day while I was getting lunch, and we just ended up chatting in the queue. Brandon is a friendly guy so he invited me to his lunch hangout spot where I became friends with Connor and a little bit acquainted with Jenna. Kamesh and I became friends because we both have the same major. What solidified it was the dude didn’t bring a calculator for our first calculus lecture. He just leaned over and was like “Hey do you have a spare calculator that I could use, I didn’t think we actually would do work today”. That is all it took. I ended up introducing him to Brandon and our group grew more. Other than our social interactions at campus and the few nights we stay together on the way home from campus, I don’t really know them as well as many other friends know their friends. I’ve only ever been exposed to their “campus” and “fun” side if that makes sense. It’s like work colleagues; you know them but you don’t truly know them unless you choose to become really close)

**21****^(th)** **July 2024**

The semester was over - finally. As always, we met that Sunday mid-afternoon and left for the holidays. We reached Carinhill Hotel roughly about 10pm that night.

Carinhill is a small town in between the mountains if you travel off the main highway. So small in fact, that if you didn’t know it was there initially, you probably never saw it off the highway let alone been there. The only reason I know it even exists is because we use it as a halfway stop to spend a few nights to rest. Brandon has some family in Carinhill where he stops to spend a day or two, it really depends on how long of a break we have honestly. We don’t really mind it though as we all have majors that finish exams around the same time period– so we get those three to 4 days extra.

I say we don’t mind it but the thing is – I don’t really like Carinhill very much. 

Sure, I said I don’t mind visiting there but that’s because Brandon just does us a huge favour by taking us home and back to campus. Irrespective, I appreciate my friend’s kindness.

It always struck me as a strange place. For a small town, Carinhill was busy – felt like a downscaled city almost. When you think of a small town, you automatically think vintage, rural even. But, Carinhill was different. It was as urban as the city I grew up in. But Carinhill Hotel – Carinhill Hotel was rundown almost. I never understood why they never did anything to change it. Carinhill as a town apparently made a lot of money, so you would think more visitors right? And with more visitors it means more money at the only hotel, right?

To help you visualise how the hotel looked, try imagining a rectangle, and then take one of the shorter sides away, now make each of those individual lines remaining a rectangle to form a “U” shape. That’s how the hotel was structured, it really was shaped like the front of an ocean monument from Minecraft. It had two floors, room 1 – room 15 on floor one and room 16 – room 31 on the second. In the middle of the “U” area, was a pool and some chairs and tables with a bar further down. This is where we spent most of our time. The inner walls were musty brown, most of the paint was ripping off though. It looked horrible, like a scab desperately trying to clench onto your skin. The railings on the second floor were wooden – with some of the railings missing a few beams. The ones that were still there, either had the paint flaking off or the beam was rotting down. All the room doors faced towards the inner “U” shape. Maybe, I grew up a bit privileged, but a hotel was meant to be elite. Not some place with broken wooden flooring and railings. I wish I had better options. But, right now, what choice did I have?

When we arrived, Kamesh and I went inside to make our booking for the room while the rest went to park and unpack the van.

‘Whooo, this place is buzzing”

“Yeah, why is it so busy?”

“Have no idea, maybe there’s that special again? If so, let’s see if we can get the bigger rooms at a bargain!” Kamesh shouted excitedly.

“Even if there is, we might have to regardless. Connor, you and I are gonna share. Brandon and Jenna are getting their own room again”

“You know what that means” he smirked at me.

“What?”

“Black Eyed Peas” he continued smirking

I looked at him with complete confusion.

“Brandon is gonna have one thing on his mind tonight - Boom Boom Pow, gotta get that”

“Dude - what is wrong with you man”

“NEXT”

The mere fact that we were in a line at reception on a Sunday evening had me baffled. Carinhill was never busy on Sundays, but today felt different.

“Hi sir, my name is Kirsty, do you have a booking?” the receptionist said in a monotone voice

“Uhm no, I need two rooms please”

“Two?” she replied looking at me as if I said something weird – “We currently don’t hav-“

“There’s our favourite guests” said a voice from afar.

I looked beside me where the voice come from. Down the hallway was Mr Wilson walking toward us. Mr Wilson used to be the old caretaker until the old owner left the hotel to him (I still don’t know the full lore on that story but I do know that he used the profits to open two restaurants in town).

“Hi Mr Wilson”

“Nice to see you here – we didn’t see you last time” Kamesh added.

“Ahh yes, it’s been a while hasn’t it? I barely see you boys anymore. You know me, always running around tending to the restaurants in town”

“Yes yes, I’m glad to see you well Mr Wilson. It’s really busy today, is the special back or is something happening?”

“I forget you boys aren’t from here. Yes, there’s this big festival happening in Nathanville. Circus folk or something like that”

Nathanville is the city closest to Carinhill about two hours away, so possibly some late travellers booked the night on their way there. It made sense why it was so busy now.

“How may I help you boys?” he added

“We need two rooms please, preferably one of the big ones” Kamesh said while he smiled to Mr Wilson.

“Two, hey” – he looked a bit taken aback but then proceeded “I think we have two”

“But sir” – Kirsty interrupted from behind the counter – “We don’t have tw-“

“Its okay, give them room 6 and 23” – he interrupted.

“Sir” she shouted back at him.

“Its fine, they will be fine” He said calmly.

“Okay sir” - she said sounding worried while shooting a sharp gaze at him.

 “That will be R3000 for both rooms per night, how many nights” as she turned towards me.

“Two..”

“Yes, R3000 for both ro-“

“No, I meant two nights, two rooms” I interrupted softly.

Mr Wilson looked at us and told us to have a good stay. While we said goodbye, I could only hear the frantic typing on the keyboard from Kirsty. She looked annoyed but was still worried. I wanted to ask if she was okay but then again, it was almost 10:45pm and I am sure she was just tired. We took our keys and met up with the rest of our friends in the lobby.

Connor and I took the bags to our room while Kamesh went to the bar to see if it was still open. We have stayed at this hotel probably twenty times but never have we stayed on the second-floor balcony area. Room 23, 24, 25 were the balcony rooms. Below was room 7, 8, 9. The remainder spread apart. Room 1 – 6 on the bottom left, with room 10 -16 on the right. The second floor had started room 17 on the left-hand side and ended room 31 on the right-hand side.

As we came to our room, room 24 was next to ours and the corner room was 21.

“Hmm, weird” I said to myself

“What?” Connor asked.

“Nothing” I brushed it off

“No tell me dude” – Connor asked worryingly.

“I just feel tired, can’t read numbers properly I guess”

“Dude, what are you talking about?”

“Nothing man, let’s go in”

“Whatever weirdo, let’s go to the bar quickly man-Kamesh just messaged me and said its open” he said while throwing down his bag and putting his wallet in his pocket.

“I’ll catch you there, I just need to make a call”

“Okay see you there dude”

I don’t drink nor do I smoke so when they have a few drinks, I just hangout – or go for a swim in the pool. I wasn’t in a rush as they were.

I opened my phone and called my girlfriend to let her know I arrived safely.

“Hey”

“Hi, how are you?” she said excitedly.

“Well I’m really-really tired but we just arrived at the hotel. And you, how you doing?”

“I’m okay, I just missed you. Hey you should probably rest. I can’t wait to see you soon though. How’s everyone doing?”

“They okay. All of them are at the bar right now, It’s quite humid here actually. The pool isn’t looking too bad so I might go for a swim.”

“But it’s so late and you tired”

“You know I love swimming. Maybe I could use a good swim to sleep better later”

“Make sure you don’t swim till too late, okay? You will get sick if it becomes cold. I love you”

“Yes, yes. I love you too”

I cut the call while walking towards the curtains and opened it slightly seeing all my friends having a blast down by the bar area. I changed into my swim suit and headed down.

“Man, Kamesh is such an idiot man”

“Why?” I chuckled as I arrived.

“The bar lady asked him if he wanted it on the rocks, man really said ‘I would prefer it in the sheets’”

“Oh gosh, Kamesh is like that. At the cafeteria, he asked this girl for her number and she said she has a boyfriend. So guess what bro does, he’s like – Well then can I have his number instead, because he sure must be fine if he got a girl like you”

“Broooo” Jenna laughed out loud

“Tell me I am wrong? If the man can get a fine lady, he too has to be fine or either he has to have a lot of cha-ching”

“Dude no, just no” Jenna said while still laughing.

“Hey Ashiq’s gonna go for a swim” Brandon started to randomly hype me up.

“Yeah man, it has been a while”

“I would join but I am already drowned”

“You man drunk”

“Oh shit you right” as everyone burst out laughing

We spent a good hour there. My friends had a few more drinks and spoke about how their semester went while I joined in the conversation every now and then. Brandon and Jenna left the pool around 11:30pm and I left a few minutes after.

I went up to the room. My body was still dripping with water. The air was warm though, even for an evening. I watched Connor and Kamesh down at the bar from the rusty railing. My eyes panned up –it was just darkness in the horizon. No lights in the distant, just a void. Suddenly a gush of wind hit my face. I was taken a back. Then it went silent, eerily silent. Where did that wind come from? I chose to ignore it and entered the room. It was dark, unusually dark – just like outside. We didn’t even draw the curtains closed at the end of the room. I turned the light on and headed for the bathroom. I checked my phone for messages before I placed it on the counter by the sink and opened the shower door and went in.

BZZZZ …. BZZZZ …. BZZZZ …. BZZZZ

My phone started buzzing on the counter. I opened the shower door and looked out. The room was filled with steam from the shower. So much so I couldn’t even see the reflections off the mirror as it was all fogged up. I slicked my hair back and grabbed my phone. 12:00am, no new messages.

“Hmm, that’s odd’ I thought. Normally my phone has this weird thing where the screen turns on for a split second every hour, but it never buzzes. I didn’t get any calls, nor did I receive any messages. I placed it back on the counter and went back in the shower.

BZZZZ …. BZZZZ …. BZZZZ …. BZZZZ …. BZZZZ …. BZZZZ

I snatched the phone to see why it was buzzing. Nothing. No notifications. But it was cold to the touch. As if though I placed it in the freezer. Even if I was tired, I sure was awake now. First the wind out of nowhere and now this. I started to get that uneasy feeling again, the one feeling I always get when I visit here. But it was a bit different, now it felt like there were reasons to feel uneasy.

“You are overthinking it Ash – the mind is a scary tool.  Just breathe”. I reassured myself.

The water pressure began slowing down and I heard a rustling sound coming from the shower as the water slowly forced its way through the rusted shower head.  Of course, the shower head was slightly rusted. I could only imagine how rusted the pipes were. Shortly after, the water began to get colder. I swear I must’ve been there for less than five minutes now. I bet the geyser was probably busted or maybe I just used up all the hot water in the span of only five minutes. I turned the shower off slowly turning the knob and went to adjust the shower head back down.

“SHIT”

Instantaneously, I flinched as I got burnt touching the showerhead. I looked up at it as if though it burnt me intentionally. You know, the same thing you do when you stub your toe on the side of something and ask why it was there type of thing.

The rustling got louder. Loud to the point the showerhead started shaking.

“Why can these people not maintain this damn place?”

As the rumbling began to slowly disappear. I could hear sound of some slight wind.

I stared at the shower head. Is it windy again outside? See, nothing to worry to about. I slowly reached up to the shower head. The warmth of my hand created steam as I placed my finger closer – it was cold. Ice cold, just like how my phone was. How was that possible?

Just a second ago it was hot enough to burn me and now it’s as cold as ice.

“Shhhhhhhhhhhhh”.

I drew my hand back. It was a voice. Coming through the holes of the showerhead. I stepped back. No, there’s no way. Maybe it’s just the wind I’m hearing? I’m sure its windy outside. You scared right now, so your mind is playing tricks on you.

“SHHHHHHHHHHHHH”.

This time a gust of wind busted through - sending the shower door open. My body flinched. My heart started to race. Without a single thought I rushed out the shower, grabbed my phone and went to open the bathroom door.

I heard 3 loud knocks on the bathroom door.

“Busy” I shouted – still shivering. Not because I was scared but because the air became so cold.

I wrapped my towel around me and opened the door to the room.

There was no one there.

I stood there for brief moment. Trying to gather my thoughts. What on Earth Is happening?

Just then Kamesh opened the door.

I jumped back startled.

“Woah, sorry man, I should’ve knocked” he said.

“No … Uhm , you just startled me is all”

“You okay bro? Did you just finish shower?”

“Yeah, I’m fine. Just cold”

I paused and pointed at the door.

“Did you knock on the door just now?”

“What?”

“Did you knock on the door just now, the bathroom door” I repeated.

“Bro, I just came in now. You saw me walk in. I knew you were deaf but I didn’t know you were blind” he said while he started to laugh.

‘I’m being serious.” I asked

“Dude, is the lady giving you trouble? You have been on edge this whole day”

I sighed.

“Yeah I’m fine. It has been a long day”

He went to use the bathroom while I changed.

I stared at the bathroom door the whole time while he was in there. The glow from around the door frame illuminated the room. It was like I was expecting something to happen. But nothing did.

Kamesh and I just spoke and we played some PUBG on our phones for a bit.

We were slightly interrupted by a loud banging sound from next door.

“What the hell was that?”

 It came from the same side as the bathroom. Then again, and again.

Kamesh and I got up.

“Dude it is past midnight – what the hell are they doing?”

I was going to complain. I took the landline and phoned reception.

“Reception, how may I assist you” a voice from the other side of the line.

“Hi, yes, there’s loud banging sounds coming from next door. I don’t know what is causing it, but could you please check it out. We are trying to sleep.”

I may have lied but I wanted it resolved.

“Sure sir, I will send someone to check it out.”

“Thank you.”

I put the phone back on the line and saw the time pop up. It was 1:37 a.m.

“Dude, where’s Connor?” I asked. “It’s almost 2 a.m”

He didn’t hear me. Kamesh was completely laser focused his game.

“BRO” I shouted.

“I think he went with some of the girls down there”

“What girls?” I think if there were girls they would’ve ran away as soon as you spoke to them man” I said jokingly while nudging at him.

“No seriously, after you left. These two girls came by the bar area. One of them had an eye on Connor. I tried hitting on the other one.”

“Let me guess”

“Yeah, my pick-up line didn’t really work, never does”

I sat up and laughed.

“Dude, do you really think grabbing a girl’s hand and saying – “I don’t see a best before here, but I can totally see a different date in the future” will ever work?”

“If she doesn’t catch my drift, she’s not the one” he said while smiling at me,

“Sometimes I wonder who’s the nerdy one here. Anyways, so he went with them?”

“Hmm” he replied and went back to his game.

“Ahhhhh” I sighed.

I texted him to ask where he was. Just one tick. Either his phone was off or he didn’t have any reception.

“You know what dude, I’m gonna go find him. Even if he doesn’t come now, at least tell him that we will leave the door open for him”.

Just then, the loud banging happened again. I went in the bathroom and punched the wall.

“Can you shut up” I shouted annoyingly. I was furious now. The banging noises caused me to have a bit of a headache.

I walked outside, I took a glance at the room next to us where the noise was coming from. Room 22. I wanted to walk up there so badly and confront whoever was making those noises but I turned away and went to the pool area below.

No Connor. No anybody actually. Everyone was probably asleep.

I went to Brandon and Jenna’s room. Knocked on the door but no answer. They must be sleeping I assumed.

Dude probably got himself lucky and ended up in those girl’s room. But I know drunk Connor, he could be looking for us and end up in reception. It happened before. It’s worth checking it out.

I walked up to the lobby but then again, no drunk Connor. I did see that there was a guy working at reception and walked up to him.

“Hi there, how may I assist you?” he smiled kindly.

“Hey, if you see this dude come here, please send him to room 23” I said while showing him a picture of Connor

“Sure sir, not a problem” he laughed

“Thanks, by the way. Did you call the room next to us that was making those noises?”

“Sorry, my shift just started. May I ask what happened?”

I explained the banging sounds and told him to I asked to send someone to check it out.

“May I have the room number?”

“Room 22”

He scrolled on his pc and then looked up at me.

“22?” He asked confusingly

“Yes, 22”

“Sir, there is no one in room 22. In fact, we actually do not have a room 22”

I was baffled.

“I am telling you it was room 22. How can you have rooms up to 31 but not a room 22?” I shouted at him. I felt a little bit frustrated. Maybe I shouldn’t have but in the moment I was now too tired to be doing this.

“I am sorry sir; I’ll have someone check it out as soon as possible”

“I’m sorry for yelling, thank you again”

I felt bad as I walked back to the room. I kept telling myself, “I’m sure it was room 22”. I went back inside and told Kamesh I couldn’t find Connor. I also briefed him on my conversation with the receptionist as we both continued to play games.

**02:22**

For some reason I stared at the time. Not sure why, but for some reason. I did.

 

**02:23**

“AAAAAAARGGGGHHHHHH”

As soon as the time changed a loud desperate shriek came from outside. The hallowing scream jolted the both of us up.

“What the hell was tha – “

Two loud knocks on our room door interrupted Kamesh.

Then two softer ones followed.

“Who… who… who’s there?” my voice slowly trembling.

I stood up and went to the door. I slowly leaned towards the peek hole and placed my eye against it.

The hand I placed on the door started trembling. My legs slowly went numb. I clenched my teeth. The slight movement of opening my mouth caused a tear on my bottom lip.

“Who is it?” Kamesh asked.

I stood there silent.

He looked at the door. He heard the sobbing.

“Ash, who’s there? ASH!” he shouted.

I turned towards him and grabbed the door handle. It was warm, as if though someone was holding it already.

“ASH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHO IS THERE?” he shouted at me as he stood up.

He walked towards me.

“Who is there? Dude this isn’t freaking funny”

“The recep… it’s the receptionist” I whimpered.

“Then open- “

“No”

“Why?” I could see he was worried.

“Dude you freaking me out. Let me see”

He pushed me aside but I still held the door handle tightly. He moved around me, stood aside me and leaned down.

“There’s no one here” He looked up at me.

He grabbed the handle to open the door.

“NO” I shouted.

“Dude, there is no one fuc –“

“Don’t. Open. The. Door” he shakenly added.

He stepped back and looked at me.

Words could not escape his mouth. I could see he was trying to say something but it wasn’t coming out.

“She’s still there, isn’t she?

“NO - I’m just messing with you asshole, that’s payback for being so weird”

He pushed me and opened the door.

“See there is nobody there”

I peeked around him. He was right, there was no one there.

He shut the door and immediately there was a knock again.

 “Help me. Help me please. Please help me” a cry from the other side.

 I stepped back from the door and slowly looked at Kamesh. Kamesh was dumbfounded. I could see now he was scared. His smile was gone, and he looked at me.

“Bro, how did you do that?” He asked.

I just looked at him.

“I know you pretended to knock on the bedframe but how are you doing that now, and … and you probably played a scream, off a sound cloud bu….?”

I was too paralyzed with fear to answer,

…

…

…

That’s the only way I could I describe how I felt. The fear didn’t even settle in fully. I think because it was beyond that. I just closed my eyes and silently prayed as three more knocks followed. I tried closing my eyes and prayed again.

This time my prayers were interrupted by deep scratching in the vents. It was like the sound of hardware nails being used to scrape the rust off iron sheets.

I opened my eyes to see a now tearful Kamesh staring up at the ceiling. I could see the spit gulp down his throat. The tears roll down his cheeks.

The feint sound of small water droplets falling down. It was coming from whatever he was looking at but I was too afraid to look up.
