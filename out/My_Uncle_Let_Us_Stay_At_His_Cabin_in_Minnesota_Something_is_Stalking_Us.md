&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It sure was nice of your uncle to let us stay in his cabin,” Danny chirped from the back seat.

&#x200B;

“Yeah it’ll be a nice change of scenery from Nowhereville, Arkansas,” I replied.

&#x200B;

Gravel crunched beneath the tires of my Toyota Tacoma as we screeched to a halt.

&#x200B;

“Jeffrey, you really need to get those brake pads changed out,” Rachel scoffed as she

unbuckled her seatbelt.

&#x200B;

“Rachel’s right for once bro. That shit sounds like a dying cat,” Danny chortled.

&#x200B;

“Shut up Danny. You know I’m always right,” Rachel smirked, pretentiously flipping her platinum

blonde hair behind her.

&#x200B;

“What was that? You said you’re always wrong? Come on now, don’t be so hard on yourself,”

Danny quipped, earning him a disapproving scowl.

&#x200B;

“Alright you two. Let’s get all our stuff unpacked then we can decide which one of you has the

lowest IQ score,” I grinned, stepping out into the frigid evening air.

&#x200B;

“Jeff, can you get the cooler? My hands are full,” Danny implored.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, just give me a second. I'm carrying shit too,” I retorted.

&#x200B;

“Baaaabe, this stuff is heavy,” Rachel whined.

&#x200B;

“Just set it down. I’ll come back out to get it,” I exasperatedly sighed.

&#x200B;

“Thanks, you’re the best,” she fawned, planting a kiss on my cheek before skipping merrily into

the cabin.

&#x200B;

“Gee, thanks,” I muttered, trudging through the thin layer of snow that blanketed the ground.

&#x200B;

I was on my way back out to retrieve the absurdly light boxes that my girlfriend had been too

lazy to carry in, when I caught movement out of my periphery. I whipped my head in its direction.

&#x200B;

In the dim fleeting light I thought I could make out some kind of forest creature peeking back at

me from deeper in the woods. It was obscured by a large pine tree and at that distance I could

only discern a pair of glowing eyes staring directly at me.

&#x200B;

The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and a sense of trepidation began to bubble in my

gut. I reasoned that it must’ve been a deer and promptly brought the rest of our belongings

inside.

&#x200B;

“When are Trent and Savannah supposed to get here?” Danny inquired as I plopped down on

the sofa next to Rachel.

&#x200B;

“Sav just said they’re like an hour away,” Rachel answered despondently, without even glancing

up from her phone.

&#x200B;

“Well what do y’all want to do until they get here?” I wondered aloud.

&#x200B;

“Doesn’t matter to me,” Rachel mumbled.

&#x200B;

“How about we start a fire? It’s kinda chilly in here,” Danny suggested.

&#x200B;

“That sounds like a great idea. I think we packed stuff for s’mores. Would you mind helping me

with the firewood? My uncle keeps some of the side of the cabin,” I replied, eager to feel the

warmth of the flames licking against my skin.

&#x200B;

“Yeah sure thing man. No, it’s okay Rachel, we’ve got it. No need to offer your assistance,” he

teased.

&#x200B;

He was rewarded with a glare and the middle finger.

&#x200B;

“Seriously though, what’s her problem?” Danny asked as I handed him a log from the stack.

&#x200B;

“Don’t worry about her. She’s just upset that the cabin has no WiFi and her Tiktoks won’t load,” I

admitted as I heaved a couple pieces of lumber.

&#x200B;

“She’ll be fine once Trent and Savannah get-”

&#x200B;

I froze. A chill ran up my spine as that prior sense of unease returned tenfold.

&#x200B;

“Danny, do you see that?” I whispered.

&#x200B;

“See what?” he murmured, tracing my gaze.

&#x200B;

The eyes were back. Only this time they were about ten feet in the air. Twin orbs illuminated in

the dusk, clearly visible through the foliage. Only this time they were closer.

&#x200B;

“Probably just an owl dude,” Danny reasoned.

&#x200B;

“Y-yeah probably,” I stuttered.

&#x200B;

I ushered Danny inside, desperate to escape the creature’s line of sight. I slammed the door,

tossing the firewood aside and swiftly turning the lock.

&#x200B;

“Babe is everything okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” Rachel questioned, concern

washing over her features.

&#x200B;

“He’s fine. He just saw an owl and got spooked,” Danny nonchalantly explained.

&#x200B;

“Yeah he’s right. I’m good,” I replied, sensing the color flush back into my face.

&#x200B;

Danny was right. It must have been a bird. Nothing else could’ve been that high above the

forest floor. At least that’s what I told myself.

&#x200B;

Danny helped me ignite the fire and before long, we were all laughing and telling college stories

amid the dancing flames.

&#x200B;

“Then out of nowhere he puked all over this girl’s dress!” Danny told Rachel in between giggles.

&#x200B;

“So she slapped him so hard that he fell flat on his ass!”

&#x200B;

They erupted into a fit of uncontrollable laughter.

&#x200B;

“I’m sorry J, but that’s fucking funny,” Rachel wheezed, struggling to regain her composure.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, yeah we’ve all done things we’re not proud of,” I bashfully remarked.

&#x200B;

“Danny what about the time you downed a fifth of Jack and woke up in nothing but your

underwear in some random dude’s front yard?” I retorted.

&#x200B;

His cheeks turned red.

&#x200B;

“Okay, you got me there. Still don’t know where my clothes went.” he chuckled.

&#x200B;

Our attention flew to the door as a loud knocking reverberated through the room.

&#x200B;

“They’re here!” Rachel giddily squeaked.

&#x200B;

“D-train, can you get that?” I blubbered through a mouthful of chocolate and graham crackers.

&#x200B;

The door swung open the second Danny flipped the lock.

&#x200B;

“We’re here bitches. Who’s ready to get fucked up!” Savannah yelled, sporting a bottle of liquor

in each hand.

&#x200B;

Trent tailed closely behind, loaded down with more gear than a pack mule. Rachel raced over to

Savannah and threw her arms around her, squealing and hopping up and down excitedly.

&#x200B;

“Hey Trent, I can grab some of that if you need help,” I offered.

&#x200B;

“That’d be great, dude, I’d really appreciate it,” he acknowledged as I hoisted one of the multiple

backpacks dangling from his saddled body.

&#x200B;

“Y’all can stay in the guest bedroom,” I stated, setting his stuff down on the neatly made queen

sized bed.

&#x200B;

“Thanks man. This place is pretty nice,” he mentioned, surveying the room.

&#x200B;

“Yeah I’m kinda surprised my uncle let us stay here. He doesn’t allow many visitors,” I admitted.

&#x200B;

“There’s gonna be plenty of time to unpack. We’ve got s’mores out here if you’re hu-”

&#x200B;

Trent abruptly grabbed my arm before I could rejoin our friends.I turned back to him, shocked at

his sudden advancement. A stern expression overtook his countenance.

&#x200B;

“Before we go back out there, you didn’t see anything... watching you when you got here, did

you? I didn’t say anything to Savannah because I didn’t want to freak her out, but I saw these

creepy ass eyes just staring at us from the forest,” he whispered coldly.

&#x200B;

I swallowed hard, fear snaking its way back into my palpitating heart.

&#x200B;

“I think I saw a deer or something when I got here,” I murmured.

&#x200B;

“Keep your guard up, but I’m sure it’s nothing,” I instructed.

&#x200B;

Trent’s grip slipped away from my arm and he nodded, grim expression unwavering. Though I

feigned tranquility, my mind was throwing out every sickening scenario it could conjure. That all

but confirmed it for me. Something was out there. And it was stalking us.

&#x200B;

As unnerving as the situation was, Trent and I managed to subdue our concerns. We drank the

night away, recounting tales from our pasts and enjoying each other’s company. Every last one

of us awoke with a nasty hangover the next day.

&#x200B;

After taking some much needed time to recover, we ventured into town to sight see and peruse

the ample stores and restaurants the town boasted. The sun was low in the sky upon our return

and the eyes from the previous night were the last things on my mind as we all prepared for

another evening of laughs and heavy drinking.

&#x200B;

“Here’s to yours, here’s to mine! Here’s to gettin’ drunk and high!” Danny roared, throwing back

a shot of whiskey as we all followed suite.

&#x200B;

I grimaced as the liquor burned its way through my insides.

&#x200B;

“Woo! Who’s ready for another?” Savannah shouted.

&#x200B;

“Ooh me!” Rachel exclaimed.

&#x200B;

“You boys want one?” Savannah proposed, eyeing Trent.

&#x200B;

“Nah I’m good for now,” I responded.

&#x200B;

“That’s all you babe,” Trent agreed.

&#x200B;

“I’m gonna take a smoke break. Anyone wanna join?” Danny asked, extending a pack of

Marlboro reds and a lighter.

&#x200B;

“Ew no, that’s gross,” Rachel sneered.

&#x200B;

“Fine suit yourselves,” Danny frustratedly mumbled.

&#x200B;

The girls downed their shots and I watched their faces scrunch up at the foul taste. A smile

began edging its way across my face. Trent was grinning from ear to ear, stifling a laugh.

&#x200B;

“Again!” Savannah screamed with child-like enthusiasm.

&#x200B;

She began to lift the bottle to her lips, but Trent shot out a hand to stop her.

&#x200B;

“I don’t think so. You’re cut off for now, hun,” Trent commanded, as Savannah pouted and

crossed her arms in defiance.

&#x200B;

“Ha! Sucks for you!” Rachel slurred, snatching the bottle.

&#x200B;

“Nope, you’re done too, sweetheart,” I affirmed, plucking the whiskey from her hands and

placing it firmly out of her reach.

&#x200B;

“Come on. Just one more. Pleeeeease,” our girlfriends whined in protest.

&#x200B;

“AAAAAHHH!”

&#x200B;

A horrifying shriek sent panic rippling collectively through us. Trent looked me dead in the eyes,

terror visible in his pupils.

&#x200B;

“Danny,” he whimpered.

&#x200B;

We bolted for the door in unison.

&#x200B;

“Y’all stay here. We’ll take care of this,” I ordered.

&#x200B;

The words came out brittle and weak. We hurriedly rounded the corner of the cabin. Trent

cupped his hands over his mouth and yelled at the top of his lungs,”DANNY!” He was met with

silence.

&#x200B;

And then... laughing?

&#x200B;

Danny emerged from behind a nearby evergreen, doubled over in stitches.

&#x200B;

“You should see the looks on your faces!” he sputtered.

&#x200B;

“I should’ve recorded it!”

&#x200B;

I watched as Trent’s petrified demeanor suddenly melted into one of rage. He began marching

furiously over to Danny.

&#x200B;

“You stupid little shit! We thought you were actually fucking hu-” he paused and the words

caught in his throat.

&#x200B;

I quickly understood why.

&#x200B;

Directly behind Danny stood an impossibly tall lanky figure. The crown of its head towered at

least ten feet in the air. Gray ashen skin stretched tightly over its emaciated frame. Claws sharp

as butcher knives protruded from each digit, primed to flay its next meal. And those eyes.

Gleaming reptilian spheres burned into the night.

&#x200B;

And behind those heart-stopping predatory orbs? Hunger.

&#x200B;

Danny’s boisterous laughter ceased when he noticed our bewildered expressions.

&#x200B;

“G-guys?”

&#x200B;

In an instant the thing pounced on Danny, razor-like fingers raking into his back with sickening

speed and precision. Danny wailed in agony, begging and pleading for his life, but the creature

showed no mercy. It smiled, showcasing rows of jagged pointed teeth, as it burrowed

relentlessly into Danny’s neck, sending blood and viscera hurtling in all directions.

&#x200B;

A tiny gasp released Trent and me from our joint daze. We turned to see the girls peeking,

wide-eyed, from behind the entryway. We darted toward the cabin and pushed our girlfriends

inside, swiftly slamming and locking the door.

&#x200B;

Savannah began hyperventilating and rocking back and forth. Rachel sobbed hysterically, as

her entire body trembled uncontrollably. Trent just stared in dumbstruck shock.

&#x200B;

Shattering glass snapped us out of it as glistening shards flew across the room. Rachel and

Savannah screamed in terror. The beast inserted its hideous head into the newly formed hole,

crimson teeth gnashing aimlessly at the air. Adrenaline surged through me and I leapt into

action.

&#x200B;

“The windows are too small for it to fit through. If anyone has cell reception, call the cops. And

stay out of its reach,” I demanded.

&#x200B;

“What are you gonna do?” Rachel mewled.

&#x200B;

“I’m gonna blow that fucking thing’s head off.”

&#x200B;

I retrieved my uncle’s shotgun from under the bed and rushed back to the group.

&#x200B;

“I can’t get a signal,” Savannah uttered dejectedly.

&#x200B;

“I can’t either,” Rachel squeaked.

&#x200B;

“Looks like we’re gonna have to figure something else out,” Trent sighed.

&#x200B;

Just as I whipped out my phone to vainly check my own reception, a speaker I hadn’t even

noticed crackled to life overhead. We glanced at it, then each other, puzzled at the unexpected

disturbance. Demented cackling bellowed from the ceiling.

&#x200B;

Then it spoke.

&#x200B;

A gruff voice that I vaguely recognized slashed through the silence like a rusty knife.

&#x200B;

“Sorry to do this to ya, nephew. Y’all really do seem like good kids,” my uncle rasped, sounding

almost elated.

&#x200B;

“Uncle Wyatt, you sick fuck, I’m gonna fucking kill you!” I seethed.

&#x200B;

“Now, don’t bother tryin’ to talk back. I can see ya, but I can’t hear ya. Anyway, people in town

were startin’ to raise suspicion at all folks going missin’. You and your friends will keep Bessie

satisfied for a long time,” he wheezed.

&#x200B;

And with that, we were left unsettlingly alone once again.

&#x200B;

“That stupid piece of fucking shit. I swear when we get out of here, I’m going to blow his fucking

brains out,” I raged, fury enveloping me.

&#x200B;

“This is so fucked up. We’re all gonna die,” Rachel cried, tears streaming down her cheeks.

&#x200B;

“No, we’re not. I have a plan, but you’re not going to like it,” Trent stoically confessed.

&#x200B;

“Alright, a plan. That’s good. Let’s hear it,” I requested.

&#x200B;

“This place only has one exit right?” he probed.

&#x200B;

“Babe, do you see another way out?” Savannah interjected.

&#x200B;

“No, but I just wanted to be sure,” Trent sheepishly mumbled.

&#x200B;

“She’s right. There’s only one door, but I could prop open the window in the bedroom,” I chimed

in.

&#x200B;

“Perfect. I’ll distract the thing. Sav, while I’m doing that, I need you to sprint to the car and drive

into town to get help.”

&#x200B;

He turned his gaze to me.

&#x200B;

“You and Rach hole up in the bathroom until help arrives. Everyone understand?” he prompted,

surveying our faces.

&#x200B;

“But won’t you die?” I whispered meekly.

&#x200B;

“There’s a good chance that I will. But this should help my case a little.”

&#x200B;

He grinned as he produced a sleek nine millimeter from his waistband.

&#x200B;

“But why you? Why me? Baby I’m not ready to lose you,” Savannah sobbed, sloppy tears

staining her shirt.

&#x200B;

“You know why, Sav. I played football in high school. I’m the biggest one here and it’ll take the

longest with me. And you used to run track. You’re faster than all of us combined,” he

acknowledged.

&#x200B;

“I know, but it’s just not fair!” Savannah wailed.

&#x200B;

“Hey, look at me. You can do this. And I’ll be right here when you return.” Savannah glanced up

at him, teary eyed.

&#x200B;

“Okay. I believe you,” she conceded.

&#x200B;

Trent placed his hands on her hips and pulled her in close. He kissed her deeply.

&#x200B;

“I love you, Savannah Mullen,” he uttered endearingly as they stared longingly into each others’

glimmering eyes.

&#x200B;

“I love you too, Trent Baker,” she reciprocated.

&#x200B;

We stood in silent reverence only for a second.

&#x200B;

With new-found ambition, Trent exclaimed, “now if you’ll excuse me, it’s time for me to skin a

cryptid!”

&#x200B;

“Wait, before you go, I have something that might help,” I mentioned.

&#x200B;

I sprinted into the bedroom and returned with two walkie talkies.

&#x200B;

“Savannah, take one of these and let us know when you make it out,” I advised, handing her

one of the walkies.

&#x200B;

“Great idea dude. Can y’all throw something out the broken window to get the thing’s attention

while Jeff helps me?” Trent implored.

&#x200B;

“Anything for you babe,” Savannah answered.

&#x200B;

She scooped up a vase from the coffee table and cocked her arm like a quarterback, ready to

send it through the window at a moment’s notice. I accompanied Trent to the bedroom and

helped him prop the window open as a loud shatter resonated from the other room.

&#x200B;

The thing re-emerged snarling and snapping viciously. The girls screamed in tandem.

&#x200B;

“Good luck out there. Give it hell,” I directed.

&#x200B;

“Will do. And if I don’t come back...take care of Savannah for me,” he requested sternly as a

solitary tear rolled down his cheek.

&#x200B;

I solemnly nodded.

&#x200B;

“Oh and Trent?” His eyes met mine, half of his body outside the cabin.

&#x200B;

“Thank you.”

&#x200B;

He flashed me a thumbs up and slipped into the night. I joined the girls as Savannah prepared

to make the mad dash for her car.

&#x200B;

“Sav, you got this. We know you can do it,” Rachel reassured her.

&#x200B;

“Once you hear Trent, go for it,” I reiterated.

&#x200B;

“Got it,” she murmured, a gleam of determination sweeping across her face.

&#x200B;

Suddenly, Trent’s muffled voice rang out.

&#x200B;

“Hey big ugly, over here!”

&#x200B;

A chain of rapid gunshots tore through the air as Savannah raced through the door. The beast

unleashed a deafening roar that was loud enough to wake the dead.

&#x200B;

And then we heard... a nauseating wet ripping noise. Trent. He didn’t even scream. We locked

the door behind her. I took Rachel’s trembling hand and led her into the bathroom, barricading

us inside. I had just flipped the lock when Savannah’s terrified voice cut in through the walkie.

&#x200B;

“Guys. Someone slashed our fucking tires,” she whimpered.

&#x200B;

“Fuck,” I cursed.

&#x200B;

“Okay, do you think you can make it back to the cabin?” I urgently inquired.

&#x200B;

“No. That thing... It’s right outside the car. It’s watching me.”

&#x200B;

Her voice quivered. My heart hammered in my chest and I said a silent prayer that Savannah

would somehow be okay. But my prayer went unanswered as the sound of shattering glass

emanated both from outside and through the walkie talkie.

&#x200B;

Savannah shrieked, the most dreadful guttural scream I’ve ever heard rising from inside her.

Then the walkie went dead. Radio silence. We tried to reach her over and over again, but we

were only met with static with each futile attempt.

&#x200B;

That was nearly an hour ago. The creature is in the cabin now. I can hear it lurking just outside

the door. I’ve got a death grip on the shotgun. When it inevitably breaches the barrier between

us, I’m going to blow that ungodly abomination to bits.

&#x200B;

We will make it out of here. For Danny. For Savannah. For Trent. And when we do, I’m going to

make my scumbag uncle wish he was never fucking born.

&#x200B;
