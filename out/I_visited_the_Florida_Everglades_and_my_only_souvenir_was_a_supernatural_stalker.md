I know it's still out there. Something followed me home when I returned from my trip last week. That thing, it was in the swamp, I did something there, and it followed me all this way. I don't know how much longer I have. But I need to tell someone what happened before it's too late.



Last week I was visiting family in Florida. It was a nice time to go, since it's freezing here this time of year, so the trip would be a good vacation. 

I grew up in Florida, but moved away when I was eighteen. I had not been back to visit my family for several years. It seemed like a good time to go and after visiting I was going to meet up with an old friend from school.

Lewis and I grew up together. He was my best friend for years before I moved away. He stayed when I left and eventually we fell out of touch. Now he was living in a small house near the Everglades doing some sort of ecology or environmental research. I realized I had never been to the Everglades before, so it would be good to see him again and check it out for the first time. I called him up and he was happy to hear I would be in his neck of the woods.

After spending some time with my family near Orlando, I started the long trek south to see what sort of place Lewis had taken up near the state's' most famous stretch of wetlands.

I finally got to the muddy driveway and did not see his house. I figured it must be further down the path. I stepped out and was surprised how it still felt humid despite the fact it was nearing wintertime. I walked a bit then saw a figure coming down the path to meet me. Despite the beard and the fact that he was balding a bit, I knew it was him right away. I was already smiling as he approached and he was chuckling,

“Man, it's been too long, how the hell are ya?” I shook his hand and clapped him on the back and returned the greeting,

“Yeah it has, not too bad, how about yourself?”

He chuckled again,

“Ah you know, dodging gators and making moonshine, living the dream as they say. It's an honest life.” He tried to sound serious for a moment, but we both laughed at the same time and we walked the rest of the way to his small house.

I was surprised by the hike and why he said not to bring my car any further. I was about to ask but he read my mind,

“Road sucks out here, don't want you to get stuck. I sold my car last year, got the old airboat for getting around. Works with the stuff I need, I just Uber anywhere else or get delivery, which many of the drivers don't appreciate.” He grinned and I believed him, this place was rough to reach.

We finally arrived at a haggard-looking building that tottered above the shifting swamp on a wooden catwalk. After looking at it, I had to ask,

“Why here?” He paused as if considering, then answered,

“It’s fine for my purposes, it's close to the areas of significance for my research, the ecology grant money has got to go somewhere so why not me? I got a nice stipend from FSU, it's not much but I just have to do my research and put up with the mosquitos and that's that.” He smiled and I appreciated the simplicity that he apparently wanted.

We went inside and it was a bit of a mess to say the least. Garbage, beer bottles, and the smell of even stronger alcohol made me think the moonshine comment was legitimate.

He shrugged as we walked in,

“Sorry, was a little busy, couldn't tidy up. But take a seat and Il grab ya a beer.” He shuffled to the kitchen and I looked around at more of the controlled chaos that was his living and work space.

Papers were strewn all over the floor. As I looked, I almost cried out when I saw what appeared to be a large, motionless Alligator. I relaxed when I saw the gator was just a taxidermied one.

Lewis returned with a few luke warm Miller’s and we cracked them open and spent some time reminiscing about the past.

After a while Lewis suggested something that sounded cool,

“Hey man, why don't we take the air boat for a ride, it's a little loud but it's fun and we can explore a bit. It's kind of like being a pirate on the open seas, except instead of wind and sails it's swamp water and loud engines.” He smiled and despite the bad sales pitch it did sound fun.

We walked outside and down a small dock to a moored airboat, the large fan looked rusted and the thing swayed and shifted on the dark brackish waters. I took a closer look at the surrounding area and was surprised. When I imagined the Everglades, I had the image of the nicer spots of wetlands where manatees swam, but it just so happened that Lewis’s house was by the more “Swampish” sections.

I did not want to voice my concern about the location, or that his boat looked like it could barely stay afloat. Fortunately, once we stepped on and the fan roared to life, I did not worry about my esthetic concerns or anything beyond how loud the fan was.

We were on the water and moving in no time. I had to admit it was a little fun as we sped around the channels of water. No one else seemed to be out and about just then, so it felt like the entire area was ours. As we were moving along at speed, I spotted a sign that concerned me though. It looked like a warning sign and I swear I saw the faded words, 

“Keep out!” I turned back to Lewis,

“Hey man, I think that sign said we aren't supposed to be in this area.” He waved his hand and scoffed,

“Nah its cool, it's just something that the tribe puts up to keep out poachers and other undesirables, its okay. We aren't here to do any of that. Most of this area is still Seminole land and I respect it, though I do pass through on occasion for a short cut.” He grinned again and I did not know if I believed him that it was “Okay” with them, but I let it go.

We slowed down a bit. The engine stuttered, and the fan died for a moment. Lewis grumbled,

“Damn thing, piece of crap engine. I just fixed it.” He started taking a closer look at the stalled fan and as he worked, I looked around. The area was preternaturally dark compared to the other spots, and I noticed the heavy canopy of trees overhead in this area particularly.

As we floated there, motionless I took in the sights and sounds. Then I thought I heard something else, besides the buzz of insects and the splashing of fish. It sounded like....crying? I strained my hearing, and I heard it again. Someone was crying for help.

I turned to Lewis and grabbed his shoulder,

“Hey do you hear that?” He stopped what he was doing and listened.

“Mmmm I think so.”

“I think someone needs help, just over there. I heard someone crying, let's go. Do you have any oars or even a big stick to push us along?”  I asked, anxious to investigate.

He pulled out a pair of paddles and I started slowly propelling us towards the sound. The sounds grew louder as we progressed, and I tried to paddle as fast as I could, while Lewis continued trying to fix the engine.

We made it into a shadowy section of mangroves, and it was getting harder to see. I pushed us along, all the while Lewis was trying to do something with the fan and complaining about the lack of light.

The cry rang out again and as we looked on, we saw a strange glow near a small inlet that housed what looked like a single burning torch and some strange stones. I looked to Lewis and he shrugged,

“Not sure. Wish I knew what it was.”

I got the boat closer to what I hoped was solid land. As we neared the edge of the small island, we heard a loud cracking and breaking sound. Lewis groaned in irritation,

“Shit, that better not have broken the hull. It sounded bad.” We couldn't check just yet, but I agreed.

I looked over the edge and saw what we had apparently struck. It was a small stone statue that was half submerged in the water. The boat had broken off the top half of whatever it was and the other portion was still floating on the surface of the surprisingly clear water. The piece looked odd, it had natural striations, but also a strange suggestive set of grooves which looked like they might have been carved into it.

As I looked at it, I felt an odd sensation. My ears suddenly popped and there was a strange feeling of decompression, like pressure was being let out in the air around us. I looked back at Lewis, but he must not have noticed it. He was too busy swearing and freaking out about his boat and the potential damage the collision had caused.

Suddenly we heard a voice cry out again, clearer and more desperate than before,

“Help! Someone help me!”

We were reminded of why we had come out to this little island. I jumped off the boat, aiming for what I thought was the ground. I nearly fell back into the water when I landed, but I managed to grab a bundle of tangled branches that were leaning down towards the spot I had jumped. The branches held firm enough to pull myself up the rest of the way and step onto studier ground.

“I need to go look, someone's out there.” I called back to Lewis, not even looking to see if he was going to come ashore as well.

I rushed into a small brush of trees, past more of the strange stones and some strangely carved wooden effigies.

I nearly tripped when I stepped into a think pool of mud. I thought it might even be a sinkhole of some kind. I avoided falling in and rushed further toward the direction I had heard the voice from.

Then I saw him. It was a boy, maybe twelve or thirteen years old. He was standing near a tree with his back to the water, he was covered in mud and it was hard to even make out his features. He was calling for help in between fits of coughing up what looked like gobs of mud.

I rushed over to try and help. As soon as he saw me, he called out again,

“Please help! It's after me, something pulled me under, its trying to get me.” I rushed over to the kid to check on him. He was slowly being pulled into another sinkhole, worse than the last one I had passed. His legs were snared by some of the vines growing in the basin and it kept him from being able to climb out of the muddy vortex.

I grabbed his outstretched hands first.

“Hold still, Il get you out.” I tried to reassure him while struggling to get him unstuck. I nearly got pulled in myself, but I was finally able to free his leg and pull him out of the mud pit. He was filthy, but otherwise seemed uninjured. The shock of the event was causing him to hyperventilate, and I tried to slow him down. I asked him about what happened,

“What happened? You said something was after you, chased you here? Was it a gator? Is it still nearby?” He tried to answer but his voice was shallow. He had been screaming so hard he had almost lost his voice. I could barely make out his mumbled response.

“No....no gator, something in the mud, something dragged me down, tried to pull me in. I’m not supposed to be here, you aren't either, it's not safe. There is something bad here, I never would have come if I had known what spot this was. Something was trapped here long ago, I can't believe this is where I had to get stuck. I got lost, my raft was damaged. The water here was deeper than I expected, I couldn't get back so I swam up here thinking it was safe.” He was starting to panic again, but I tried to settle him down.

“It's alright, my friend and I will get you home, what was your name?”

He took a deep breath and finally started to control his breathing. When he sensed the immediate danger was gone he answered,

“Nokoski, my name is Nokoski. But we don’t have time to talk. We need to leave, do you have a boat? I lost my raft back that way and I am not getting near the water again, or the mud.” I nodded my head and held out my hand, showing him the way back to the boat.

As we walked I heard Lewis calling out to me and when he saw us walking towards him, he looked relieved and concerned all at once.

“What happened to him?” Lewis asked once we were closer.

“I think he got attacked by something, may have been a gator but he was not sure, let's take him back home. Where is home Nokoski?” I asked the boy but his face had turned pale and he stood on the shore looking down at the broken rock that the air boat had knocked down when we had reached land.

He shook his head then froze, standing quiet and still for a long moment before saying something I couldn't understand. He looked like he was on the verge of shock again and he kept repeating,

“The totem, the totem.” I tried to ask him what was wrong and he turned around and looked at us. He looked completely horrified and I had no idea what had suddenly happened that could make him so scared.

“You two need to leave now! Stay away from me!” Before we could ask why, he dove back into the water despite his previous protests and started swimming as fast as he could away from us and the strange little island we had landed on.

“What the hell was he talking about? I'm so confused.” Lewis said, scratching his head.

“I don't know but I think he’s right, something feels off. He was looking at that little stone that we toppled and kept saying “The totem" I think we may have accidentally desecrated an important site. Let's get out of here.” Lewis nodded his head and we turned back to the boat and departed.

As we slowly paddled away from the strange island, I thought it was odd when I looked back and saw that the stone in the water was no longer visible. In fact the area behind us seemed to look more like sludge or mud rather than water.

I tried the ignore the bad feeling I had focus on getting back. We barely shared a word about the strange event we had witnessed as we slowly floated back.

We got back late and I was exhausted. Lewis offered to let me stay at his place for the night, before heading out to catch my flight back home the next morning.

I agreed. Despite the run-down state of his home, I did not want to try and find a motel at that time of night. I slept on his couch and had a hard time getting comfortable. Lewis had managed to fall asleep almost immediately and I could hear his snoring from where I was.

Just when I did manage to nod off, I thought I heard something outside that made my ears perk. It sort of sounded like wet footprints on the deck outside. I sat up and tried to focus on the odd noise. It shifted slowly and moved on. I was not sure what it could be, but I was a bit concerned. I considered telling Lewis and asking if animals or other things often ventured near his front deck. But when the sound finally died down, I managed to get a few fitful hours of sleep before my alarm woke me.

I said goodbye to Lewis and promised to try and visit again soon. As I was leaving back down the road towards where I had parked my car, I saw something odd. It looked like large muddy footprints on the deck outside his house, they seemed to circle the entire place and even though I did not have time to investigate further, I got a creeping sense of unease when I considered the sound of footsteps last night, and the odd muddy prints I was looking at that morning.

I resolved to send a message to Lewis when I got to the airport and tell him what I saw. I never ended up sending the message though, as I ran into traffic and barely made my flight on time.

When I got off the plane, I was anxious to get back home. Despite the strangeness of the last day, my trip had been a good one. But I was tired and was planning on using my last day before going back to work to relax.



It was two days after my return, when I got the call telling me that Lewis was dead.

I was shocked, I had meant to call him when I got back, but I didn't think it was urgent and now he was dead. I was apparently the last person to have seen him alive and the circumstances of his death were very disturbing. He seemed to have been drowned in mud, not outside his house near the swamp, but in his own bed.

My heart sank and my mind raced. Who would have wanted to kill him? Then I thought about the muddy footprints, that strange encounter with the boy and how he had said something had tried to pull him into the mud.

Worst of all I considered how he had turned pale when he saw the small rock totem we had toppled, when we arrived to try and help. He had tried to warn us away from something bad but left without giving us more details.

I told the police everything that happened that day and I was informed of their intent to keep me as a person of interest for the investigation into his death.

When I hung up the phone I was crushed, confused and scared. I had no idea what had really happened to him, but whatever it was, felt like it was connected to what we had seen. I felt a lingering sense of danger as well. I felt terrible for what happened to Lewis, but I was glad to be far away from where it had happened.

The next day was when I saw the footsteps at home for the first time.

I was just getting back home from work. It was a dry day, no rain or snow, despite how wet the winter had been so far. It made the presence of those muddy prints even more jarring when I saw them. A line of the tracks could be traced from the woods near the backyard all the way to my front door.

Unnerved by the sight I bent down to inspect them. I was disturbed when I saw they looked exactly like the ones I had seen outside Lewis’s house that night. Despite the large humanoid shape, no boot imprint or anything like that was present. There was not even the outline of a barefoot, just a large general shape and it looked about ten sizes too large to be a normal human print.

I followed the tracks to my front door and saw an even larger concentration of mud outside. My doormat was saturated, and I saw mud on my door handle as well.

Seeing this after Lewis had just been killed and learning about the detail in which it had happened cause me to fly into a panic. I did not see anyone, or anything around, but I rushed to unlock my door. I hurried inside and slammed it behind me, locking it again the moment I was inside.

I turned on the lights and frantically searched for any trace of mud in the house. I was relieved when none was evident. At least in that moment, I relaxed and felt a bit safer.

I kept thinking about the mud, the boy calling for help and the horror in which he had fled after he told us to run. Then I thought about Lewis, he had been drowned in mud. It couldn't have been an accident, something from the swamp had gotten in and killed him, smothered him with mud.

I looked outside through my front door and knew then that whatever had killed Lewis had followed me back home somehow.

We must have done something when we were on that island, violated the sanctity of somethings home perhaps? I remembered the boy's words about a totem. Had we broken a sacred object? What was it doing there? And how did this thing know who we were and how to find us?

I had many questions and few answers. The one thing I did know, was that my time was running out.

I didn't leave my house for the rest of the night and when I tried to sleep, I swear I heard dull scratching on the windows outside and the slow shambling walk of something dragging muddy feet along the perimeter of my house.

Yesterday I stayed inside. I didn’t know what else to do, I knew I was in trouble, but I couldn't tell the police that some mud monster followed me home from Florida and was stalking me.

I calmed down a bit during the afternoon and even risked ordering food for lunch. When nothing had shown up and jumped out at me when I got my food, I relaxed a bit. I felt safer knowing that at least in the day I was safe.

That feeling did not last through the night. When it started to get dark, the subtle fear crept back into my mind.

I decided to distract myself with a shower, since I realized I had not had one for a few days. I turned on the water and was puzzled when nothing came out. As I waited, all I heard was a low grumbling in the pipes. I sighed when I thought I might have to call a plumber. I wish it had just been the pipes, since in the next moment something did come out of the showerhead; it just wasn't water.

There was a large bulbous mass of mud and viscous dirt pressing through the showerhead along with a trickle of the water trying to move through the mass. A large glob of the mob fell onto the shower floor and dirty brown water broke through the filth, streaking the shower with brown rain.

I stepped back in disbelief at the sight. I fled the bathroom and shut the door behind me.

I shuddered when I considered how the mud was trying to reach me, trying to pull me into whatever death spiral had claimed Lewis, and who knows how many others.

As I mulled over the hidden threat that stalked me, a more mundane thing drew me out of my paranoid concerns. Despite my fear, I remember groaning out loud when I saw my neighbor Marty was home. And of course he was knocking at my door.

He was the worst sort of neighbor, a rude, passive aggressive old bastard who was also a member of the homeowners association. He was the sort of person to shut down a kids lemonade stand for not having a business permit.

Despite my disdain for the man, I hoped for his sake he would not stay long at my door. I had no idea if anywhere around me was safe anymore.

He knocked and knocked and eventually after muttering some colorful language, slipped what I assumed was some insulting or passive aggressive letter under my door and left.

I did not bother looking at the note, but for a fleeting second I almost considered asking him for help and calling out, but the moment passed and I was left alone in the house with the creeping feeling spreading as the skies darkened.

As it got later and nothing happened, I thought I might still be safe inside. Though I was getting hungry and I had nothing to make. I did not want to risk leaving, so since it seemed like visitors were safe, I decided to order dinner.

After half an hour I heard a knock at the door and knew my pizza was there. I got up and moved to the door and saw a young delivery driver waiting outside. Just as I moved to unlock the door I heard a strange sound outside. I looked back at the glass and it had what looked like a giant muddy handprint on it.

I nearly screamed, but I had no words for what I saw through the grime slicked glass. I saw the poor man's head snap back and a large roiling cloud of filthy water and mud envelop him.

I watched on in shock as mud spilled out of the man's mouth and he gurgled and struggled to breathe. I thought for a moment to try the door and see if I could save him, but just as I reached for it, I saw the handle slowly turning, and shaking slightly. It was like the thing was trying to open it, even as it enveloped and suffocated the writhing and convulsing delivery driver.

I stumbled back in stark terror. I couldn’t move, couldn’t speak. I just watched as the hapless man was consumed by the amorphous blob of mud. When he finally fell down, I slowly inched closer to the door and looked around. The body was gone and all that was left was a box fallen open on the ground with muddy pizza strewn over my porch.

I was too horrified to even react to the grizzly display I had seen. After the poor driver had been killed, the shifting muddy prints moved around slightly, but did not leave. They just seemed to pace around on my porch, patiently waiting to breach the thin wall of defense that was my door and consume me as well.

I waited for a while, nervously watching the spectacle, until I could not see any new prints on the ground. I thought it was over, but then to my surprise and concern, I saw an old man walking toward my front door. His cane tapping along my drive way in angry rhythm as he moved, completely oblivious to the danger he was walking into.

I hated Marty, but he did not deserve to die. I couldn't open the door, but I decided to open the window slightly and shout out a warning,

“Marty get back, go home, it's not safe. Go home and call for help!”

He bristled and ignored me and kept walking up to my porch. When he was a few feet from my door he launched into his tirade of grievances. He seemed unaware of all the mud and mess of human detritus the creature had left when it killed the delivery driver. He just seemed to look down at the muddy pizza and the mess on my porch.

“Do you have any idea what time it is? What is all this racket? And look at this mess? I swear you single handedly bring down the property value of this neighborhood.”

I tried to warn him again, but it was too late. His long list of complaints was cut short when he was hoisted off his feet by a tendril of moving mud and before he could protest, another appendage of living mud jammed itself down his throat. There was an awful moment where the confused old man had no idea just what the hell was happening and how he had walked into mortal danger. Then he started to shake violently, like he was having a bad seizure. He fell to the ground and the mud coalesced around his head. He was submerged in the roiling mass of mud and vanished with his list of complaints forever unheard.



The deaths happened just last night. I’m still trapped. I stayed inside again today. It's still out there, it has to be. I thought it might be safe to leave in the day. But when I tried to go, I saw a river of mud trickling from my door to some unknown point in the forest beyond and I stopped myself. I tried to call out for help, but my phone was damaged, it seemed to be oozing dark brown water and was totally fried. The only device I have is my laptop and the only thing I can think to do now is write about what happened and warn people away from the curse of that damn place.

Whatever we did in Florida, whatever that totem was, breaking it was bad. It's after me now and I don’t know how much longer I have. I don't know what in the hell it is, but even now I question whether or not I locked the door earlier when I tried to leave. I need to check now for my own sanity.



It's here! I went to the door and stepped on a muddy print. I heard something shifting in my kitchen. I’m in my bedroom now, the door is closed and locked, but I hear it outside. I don't know what to do now. It has come for me and I need to get out of here. I don’t know if I can ever get far enough away, but I have to try. I’m going to try the window, it's only a single story drop and I should be okay if I run, at least I hope so.

I need to go now, the door is moving and I hear something on the other side, I swear there is a light tapping now, like a gentle knock. I look down and even in the dark I can see the small puddle of muddy water oozing under the door.

Its now or never.

I'm sorry Lewis, I should have warned you. Maybe I’l see you on the other side, but hopefully not that soon.
