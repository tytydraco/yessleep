(Part 2 is linked in the comments) It has been two years since my last update, I wasn’t planning to ever update. I wanted to forget this I wanted to pretend it never happened, but I think writing out the rest of the story will give me closure, at least that's what my therapist suggested. It's been awhile obviously but i can still remember everything so clearly. I left off in the hotel planning to go to work to check if there were any old newspapers on the house, but i never made it to work. I finished typing the last update and posted it while in the hotel room. I was trying to think about what I should do, should I abandon him and my house completely? Should I ask for help? But who could I ask, who would believe me? I remember coming to the conclusion that I should just go try to find out some information on the house and figure out what to do after finding any hints on what it could be. Then I got a text, I felt my phone buzz in my pocket. I felt so nervous debating if I should even look at the message, but I ended up pulling out my phone to check it even though my stomach churned with nausea.
 It was from my mother,
 “Veronica, the whole family is worried about you.”

I felt relieved that it wasn’t from Larry, but also confused about what she was talking about. I responded,

“What are you talking about?”
My mother texted back very fast, “Larry is really worried he told us about your behaviors recently…”

I felt like puking after reading that sentence and it became clear he no, it was texting my family. My phone buzzed again, 

“Veronica the family is planning to come to your house at 12 today to discuss this we love you”

I texted quickly feeling my heart race, “ NO!” and i began to text another message after, “please don’t come something isn’t right I-” I didn’t even finish writing when my mom responded.

“He said you would be like this, the family is coming at 12 i'm not going to respond anymore to argue.” 

I felt like crying, I couldn’t convince her since Larry had already convinced her I'm acting crazy or something. I looked at the time it was 11 I had one hour. So i did something foolish, I grabbed my things and got into my car and i drove home. I remember my heart racing, stomach churning, I couldn’t save Larry but I could save my family. I got to the House, parking on the streets. I sat in my car looking at my house I didn’t know what to do, I didn’t know what I could do. Larry was not near any of the windows, I got out of my car and slowly walked to the door I nervously opened the door I half expected him to be there waiting for me, but he wasn’t. However I saw the attic ladder was down. I left the door open and slowly walked in looking around the house I noticed the walls were fine, not bleeding which was good right? I was so foolish reader I was so fooled by a sense that maybe I could do something. The door closed behind me and that little hope I had disappeared and putrid stench filled the air and i heard laughing from the attic. The whole house felt like it was rumbling, laughing at my stupidity. My legs were shaking, I was shaking as pathetic as it sounds I couldn’t even move my body. The house practically hummed my name in Larry’s voice. “Veronicaaa” I felt like puking, slowly stumbling back finally getting the strength to move my feet. Slowly stepping back then turning around to see the door covered in red ooze I felt like crying. I'm an idiot, an idiot for believing I could stop whatever this was. As i looked at the door I felt a cold hand touch my shoulder, the house stopped shaking, but I didn’t. I was terrified.

The thing in Larry’s body said into my ear, “I said we would meet again didn’t I?” 

I turned to look at him tears in my eyes, “You.. stole my husband!” 

It tilted it's head smiling that wretched toothy grin, “I stole him? No my dear i'm just using his vessel for now. Your husband is dead.”

Now I was crying it finally hit me fully, my husband was dead. It held up Larry’s hand to catch my tears and it licked them off his hand.
“Ah I really missed this.” It said still smiling, I wanted to puke but I didn’t.

“Why?”, I croaked out. “Why haven’t you taken me yet? I'm in the palm of your hand why WHY!? WHY MUST YOU TORMENT ME ANY LONGER!?”I cried screaming.

It cupped my face forcing me to look up into my husband's face, “ Oh darling for entertainment”, It said, wiping away my tears again. “You will have your turn, don't you worry, because the walls must be fed.” He grinned, removing its hands from my face.

 I sobbed, falling to the ground and crying. “This is too cruel..” I cried and I felt him pick me up and put me on the couch. 

How pathetic I must have seemed begging to just be taken. A knock was heard at the door and I remember thinking, how utterly useless I was. It answered the door using Larry’s body. I heard whispers as my family shuffled in, they were probably discussing what they were going to say to me or whatever lies that creature told them. I felt like vomiting I stood up and wandered to the entrance my face must have been red from crying. I saw my mother look so sad at my appearance.

I looked up at that thing, “please let them go Ill do anything”, I said and all it did was smile that disgusting toothy grin.

My mother patted my arm and lead the family into the living room which had a couch and a few stray chairs. Everyone was sitting while I was standing beside “Larry”. I felt sick, I had done  nothing but add fuel to the fire. Now my family and I were going to be eaten. 

I felt it whisper in my ear, “do you want to say goodbye before I devour them?”

 How pathetic I must have looked and this being still wanted to toy with me, I felt like crying but I did not say a word just shaking. My family looked anxious probably concerned for my well being. 
Then it spoke walking past me and to  the center of the livingroom, “Thank you for all gathering for Veronicas sake…”

I remember thinking, why? Why continue to play this sick game when it had us all where it wanted. We were prey waiting to be killed and they didn’t even know it. I wanted to beg and scream and I almost took a step forward when I felt something tug me back. I looked at my shoes and found them stuck to the ground engulfed in red goo. I looked at “Larry” to see him smiling still talking but I had blocked his voice out to focused on trying to figure out a solution to escape.

It smiled, “Veronica what do you think?”, it asked.

I looked at him helpless, “ Please let us go..” I said in a shaky tone.

“Oh Veronica…the walls must be fed!”, He smiled his smile reaching his ears.

 My family gasped a few starting to stand up. Larry’s body festered up and turned into ash, I saw my dad puke. I looked around for something I could do, but I realized the walls were bleeding. My family was screaming as they made there way to the front door. However at this point they had already touched the red goo and slowly there body turned to ash. Every single one of them was ash, except me I was stuck to the ground helpless. Then I blacked out. I woke up on the front porch, I was dazed slowly remembering the events, I hoped it was some sick dream. My phone buzzed, I checked it it was a message from my friend Emily. 

“I heard you aren’t doing well so a bunch of us are coming over to help you cheer up!<3”

Another text from Larry’s number, ”The walls are still hungry.”
I left the house, went into my car and just drove. I texted my friend and told her to not come, but knowing her she'd go anyway. Then I kept driving and driving trying to clear my head and eventually I stopped at a gas station two hours away. I felt so utterly defeated knowing I couldn't stop that house from eating all my loved ones. I'm sure you are judging me for just leaving my friends to die, and let me say I have judged myself more than you could understand. I started my life over in a new state, I deleted social media and even got a new number. I don't know why that house didn't devour me, but I have so much guilt for being the only one to make it out alive. I have a therapist although she believes that all my loved ones died from some freak accident involving a gas leak, which caused me to hallucinate. You may be wondering why the police didn't get involved with all the people who were devoured and I think that's the weirdest part. I recently reinstalled social media and I came across my friends' and families’ accounts and they were still posting. Even though I knew for certain they were no longer alive. That's when I got a DM from Emily on Instagram. It was an address to my old house and a message, 
“The walls are still hungry veronica, see you soon”
That house must be using my friends as vessels to lure more people into the house. So here is my warning: be careful of the houses you enter, because sometimes they are hungry.
