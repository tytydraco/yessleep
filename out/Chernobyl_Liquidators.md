I have a friend let's call him Sergei, its not his real names since he told me that I can only post this if I hide his name.

I have known Sergei for a while and I met hime while playing mudrunner and we have talked ever since.  
He is very nice but he has had a light ptsd from his time in the military.

His father told him lot's of stories which definetly could fit in here but those are for another time.

He comes from a middle class family, not to rich not poor, he lives a very comfortable life and works as a extra help on a small farm owned by a very nice lady whose husband bought the farm but died a while ago so she hires him and pays him quite nicely, she is a very nice lady but is a bit older and is lonely but she has a motherly energy which he really enjoys since his mother worked on airplanes and was not always there for Sergei.

Anyway to get back to the story I was going to tell.

I am telling this like sergei told it to me and he told it to me from his perspective so here we go.

  
One time I got stationed at pripyat, and I often patrolled there.

Most of the time nothing happend with one exception.



So I was on a night patrol through pripyat riding through the streets in my UAZ-469.

I drove about 20 ish minutes from the base to start my patrol.

I stop at the new designated parking spot for my patrol.

I turn off the engine and enjoy the heat for a bit longer before I step into the cold night air.

I close and lock the door behind me and I take in the surrounding environment.

I walked for a short while before I stopped again to look around and observe.

The abandoned buildings were the same ones that were built near my hometown, I laughed internally at that little thought but my mind wandered to a different thought.

The radiation is what is constantly in my mind. And especially when I would dig trenches.  
I know the radiation was getting worse because of all the digging me and my squad were doing.

When I was a teen I did a lot of reading about the chernobyl disaster and the parts about the chernobyl liquidators are now resonating within my mind.  
They sprayed water everywhere to keep the highly radioactive dust from blowing away and spreading, but we are undoing that work and making it the radiation worse by kicking up dust and digging into the radioactive soil.

Thinking of that makes me hear the sound of water.

Wait a damn minute there is actually the sound of water getting sprayed

What the \*&\^# I thought to myself as I approached the sound.  
I was standing at a intersection and was about to peak the corner before I just got the feeling I should only peak around the building.

I listen closely and I Hear of water getting sprayed on asphalt and the lazy rumbling of the 6.0L v8 from a zil 131

I recognise that sound.

My uncle drove a Zil 131 and would tow a grain trailer.

I would help my father fill that trailer with the grain from our farm and from those hours spent with that truck I recognise that sound immediately

I snapped from my thoughts and peaked around the corner.

And there a group of men dressed like the chernobyl liquidators were walking about a street length away and were hosing down the city.  
Why were there people in costumes dressed like Chernobyl liquidators walking around pripyat?

Maybe the government knew that we were digging trenches and sent people to hose down the city to keep radiation levels down I thought.

some are wearing the recognisable trenchcoat issued to liquidators, some are wearing full body suits issued and soviet era PBF gas masks.

But still something looked

Off

So I looked even closer, I was straining my eyes for a better sight and at that moment the moon appeared from a cloud which had obstructed it and now they were bathed in moonlight. And I realised what was wrong and my blood ran cold as the ice in the wolga river.

All of their clothes were torn, and had tears as if they were used for years after the disaster hosing the city down every night since the disaster.

Even the truck looks battered with dents and rust and the large water tank it carried was also rusted and had large dents and scratches.

I grabbed my ak74. I was a lucky guy and had once found a optic in a small hunting shop which I immediately bought. It was a okp-7 I had stuck on my rifle with a side mount.

I held my rifle tighter and slowly pushed the selector lever from safe to semi auto.

I grimaced at the clicks it created but luckily the ghost like liquidators didn't hear it.

I slowly released my right hand from the grip and moved it down to my radio to try to alert my squad but I had forgotten something.

For fun some guys had been playing music via their radio's and I had tuned in to the music.  
It was great fun but I forgot to turn down the volume so when I pressed the send button to start talking the beep that notifies you that you are now sending was very loud.

And that they did hear and they all stopped dead in their tracks.

Even the truck had turned of it's pumps and stopped watering.

The deafening silence of the night was only broken by the sound of the truck idling.

And they all slowly turned to look at me.

Because the moon was so bright that night I could see their faces or rather their gas masks covering their faces.

Their gas masks were worn out and some of them have a cracked visor but the most disturbing part was the blood.

All of them had small amounts of blood on the filter like they had coughed up blood through the filter.

Some of them even had small trails of blood from the glas visors.

This sight still haunted me to this day.

Their gazes went right through me like the radiation went through them like on the day of the cleanup.

I was frozen in place but just for a second.  
But they were not and started sprinting at me way faster than a man would be able to with the heavy water canisters they were carrying on their backs.

I shoved the radio back in my pocket and started running as fast as I could.

My rifle was hanging on it's sling banging against my legs as I ran.

I grabbed and turned around and saw the truck accelerating towards me.  
The liquidators which stood close to it had grabbed onto the side and were hanging on the side of it like they were action heroes.

The liquidators on foot were closer than when I started running but they were not catching up.

I heard the sound of their heavy boots stomping on the pavement.

I turned a street corner and another one.

I heard the truck's tires squeling under the load of the truck going through a corner at speed.

They could not see mee but I knew they knew where I was because I heard the truck accelerate again towards the second corner.

I was getting tired and hopeless, but then I realised I had my ak.

I waited at another corner for the truck to arrive.

I flicked the selector lever from safe to full auto.

And there the truck came around the corner, belching black smoke.

I grinned and opened fire.  
The truck shuddered from the bullets but just slightly slowed down and belched even more black diesel smoke before speeding up again.

I fired a quick burst at the men on the side and only one fell of the truck.

But then he rose again and tried to run towards me with iron determination, missing a step and nearly falling but he was not very fast.

But I was not paying that much attention to him as the truck was getting closer, so in a last resort I emptied the magazine into the truck and that seemed to do something so I took off again.

And then I saw my car parked and Boris my replacement and buddy waiting for me looking confused.

Hey whats going on he shouted, rifle at the ready.

I reached him and I could barely stand on my feet from fear.

No time we have to go, I said between panting.

What do you mean segei? Why were there gunshot, are you shot are you okay.

I lost my patience and shouted I'm fine but we have to go and I clumsily tried to ram the key into the keyhole. While Boris kept asking me what was going on but I ignored him and unlocked the car door.  
But then he asked me why the hell he heard a truck.

And I froze for and turned to look at him.

I felt a shiver run down my spine and I screamed at him;'WE HAVE TO GO THEY ARE COMING''. Even more confused Boris asked who:'Who are you talking about?''.

I looked at him and said:'the liquidators are coming.'' And proceeded to grab him by his collar to move him to the passenger seat.

It looked like that worked since he finally started to understand and he got in the car.

I got into the passenger seat and boris tried to start the car.

Nothing happend, he tried again, nothing.

He cursed and hit the steering wheel.

I ducked under the dash searching for a lever.

I while under the dash I heard boris exclam:'what is that truck and then I felt a shiver run down my spine.

That are the liquidators I answered and they are coming for us.

After I said that I found button and pulled on it.

Try again I asked and he tried again and the 4 cylinder engine sputtered to life and I pushed the choke back and emerged from under the dash and saw the truck bounding towards us belching black smoke and leaving a trail behind it.

Boris slammed the gas pedal and the car protested but jerked forward and we were finally on the move.

Let's get to the barracks I shouted of the sound of the engine.

He nodded and hopped a curb, to go around a corner faster.

I grinned at him and told him that if we practiced a bit more he could try to become a racing driver.

Even in the tense situation he laughed but stopped because the big truck was in our rear view mirror.

I grabbed my ak and climbed to the back seat, and opend a box.

I knew that in the back there was a box with 7n24 ammo that was only for emergencies because it was quite expensive but this was a emergency so I ripped of the top and grabbed a magazine which already was loaded with the rounds.

I saw the black tip and a devilish grin appeared.

Let's see how they like this, I said to myself while inserting the magazine and racking the charging handle.

I opend the back window and I flicked the selector lever from full auto to semi auto and let loose five rounds and watched as the tungsten carbide round ripped into to the old soviet truck chasing us.

I had a better efffect than before since I saw a liquid spray from the truck, probably the radiator.

Then I switched to full auto and we turned a corner and I got a clear shot at the side and let the ak run.

I saw the rounds impacting the side of the cabin, the water tank and quite a few liquidators fell of the truck.  
They did not get up as before.

The truck was strangely going faster, and catching up so I searched for another magazine loaded with these wonderful rounds.

But to my dismay there were none so I grabbed a preloaded stripper clip and shoved the rounds down the magazine, followed by another one of the large stripper clips we had put in that box earlier.

I grabbed the full mag, locked it in the gun, racked the charging handle and took aim.

I had switched the gun back to semi auto, to conserve ammo and fired two bullets at the truck to keep it at bay.

Then I got an idea, I looked closely and saw the driver sitting in the cab.

I shot at him twice but missed so he ducked under the dashboard and behind the engine.

I shot at the engine a few times but that did slow the truck down so I kept firing at the engine until a lot of steam came out and it grinded to a halt.

I excitedly exclaimed, I GOT HIM BORIS I GOT HIM FINALLY BYE BYE YOU CREEPY FUCKERS.

me and boris laughed and after some time we were at the base tired because the adrenaline had worn of and the excitement had long since been replaced with exhaustment.

I was so tired, I didn't even notice the guards strange looks seeing al the spent casings lying on the floor of the UAZ.

We just crashed on our beds and slept until morning.  
We told the commander that there enemies which had ambushed us but we got away.

He believed it and I never saw the liquidators again.

But in my dreams they still watched me and even when I got to go home, somtimes late at night I stil see them standing at the edge of the forest. Watching me but never doing anything.

This is my ghostly story from pripyat.

  
Sergei told me that he always has his makarov in his Mercedes M class in the center console alongside some spare magazines, but he said he never needed it for anything except for one time when he saw a big bear in the woods and fired a warning shot to scare it of but that is it.

I hope you enjoyed the story and any complements I will pass on to Sergei.

Until next time my friends.
