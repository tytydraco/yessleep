Around the middle of October, I found myself making my way through the boonies. I was on the road taking in the empty scenery while enroute for a scheduled interview for a janitorial position. The job piqued my interest since it mentioned something about in-house boarding being included. The idea of working around the elderly and sickly was unpleasant to say the least. But earning a living rent-free took precedence over the fact I’d potentially be living and working in a hospice home.

There was nothing worth noting about the drive other than the vast nothingness of farmland and numerous abandoned churches which was typical for the southern states. The drive took longer than it should have, and I had to heavily rely on a printed-out map route since there was no cell reception around these parts. After following a seemingly endless straight road that appeared to not have been maintained at all, I had finally arrived at what can only be described as a complete eyesore of a small brick office building. It was off to one side of the road with nothing but disarrayed cobblestone as a driveway leading all the way up to the building.

The building looked like a piss poor attempt of a single-story office drawn by a six-year-old was taken from paper and made into reality and then dropped into the middle of nowhere. Fake flowers of every possible color and poorly tended bushes riddled the front. I almost made a U-turn as soon as I saw the place thinking it was a bad joke.      

After collecting myself and pushing all negative thoughts into the back of my mind, I parked my truck in one of the few poorly marked parking spots and made my way through the front entrance. The main door was a basic automated sliding glass door like one you would see walking into a supermarket, immensely adding to the silly factor of the place. The moment I crossed that threshold into the building, my nose was assaulted by the repulsive smell of death.

Upon entry I saw a short and portly looking man in a poorly tailored black suit hunched over the reception desk with his back to me and a young female. She appeared to be around my age and sat behind the desk with a very uncomfortable look on her face. The moment she and I met eyes I could visibly see her relax a little. She pushed her long black hair behind one ear and gave me a very warm “Welcome! How can I help ya?” Her southern dialect was thick, and you could tell by her tone that she was thrilled to see a new face. Doing my best to sound professional, I told her that my name is Elias and that I had a scheduled meeting with “Mr. Grady”.

As soon as I said “Mr. Grady”, all emotion drained from her face and she looked down at her lap with a blank expression, hair hanging in her face as if she had completely checked out. The portly looking fellow then turned around to face me. His head was nearly bald and what was left was slicked back. If it weren’t for any sense of professionalism, I probably would have bust my gut laughing at his cartoonish appearance, he certainly matched the tackiness of the place. With a heavy emphasis and a deep, grumbly voice he said, “I’m DOCTOR Grady.” 

Dr. Grady let out a huff and gestured to a door that was located almost directly behind the front reception desk. Next to the door was a very out of place small window with blinds and I instantly felt sick to my stomach. I couldn’t help but imagine this uncomely and cartoony man just burning a hole in the back of the young receptionist’s skull with his eyes. As we passed into the room which I assume he considered his office, I could see out of my peripheral that this poor girl was still in a frozen daze. I pulled the door mostly shut behind me, not for the sake of the interview but more for her.

Dr. Grady walked behind an old wooden desk and plopped in a large computer chair. He motioned me to take a seat in what appeared to be a plastic school chair which had been positioned facing his desk as centermost in the room as possible. After looking me up and down for a moment as if sizing me up he spoke, “Welcome to Peach Tree Hospice- again my name is Dr. Grady and I’m the proprietor of this little piece of heaven.” The sarcasm was apparent. “The pretty young thing out front is my stepdaughter, Caroline.” He went on to tell me a little about the place and that his wife “up and died” last year leaving him no choice but to take over.          

He only spoke about his wife briefly. From what I understand, she had a bad heart that only got worse with time. In her own way of coping with the unknown of exactly how long she had, decided to open a makeshift hospice home. Just short of two months after officially opening, she passed away. That’s all I know about Dr. Grady’s wife as he never once mentioned her name and didn’t have any family pictures in his office. This brought something else to my attention, most doctors tend to have their certifications and whatnot proudly framed and displayed. However, there was nothing like that in this office.

Thankfully, the rest of the interview was normal, and Dr. Grady asked me some of the typical questions. When I brought up my years of security experience, it seemed to grab Dr. Grady’s attention and without another question he announced, “I’m sold. To be honest with you, we have some damn kids from a reservation not too far from here that like to play gross pranks every now and then.” He didn’t mention what sort of “gross” pranks, but I let my imagination fill the gaps. Dr. Grady rose from his chair and told me to join him for a quick tour of the building.

The layout of the building was strange but simple. It appeared to have the shape of a cross with the left and right side being long and wide hallways with six rooms on each side for the residents. I guess you’d call the entrance the base of the cross and the top was just an empty space with one door off the side for storage. The walls were all painted a puke green color and lined on each side were metal handicap safety railing to assist with walking. There were some simple Halloween decorations hanging from wall to wall that I could tell were hung with care, likely Caroline’s doing. Given the overall look of the place you couldn’t tell what it would’ve been used for previously.

As we neared the end of the left side of the large hallway, the repugnant scent of decaying flesh overwhelmed my senses. It took everything in me to not vomit profusely. Dr. Grady noticed this and let out a light chuckle and said, “What you’re smelling is Ol’ Miss Donahue, she expired a couple hours before you got here. Still waitin’ on that damned coroner and his son to come take care of it.” He told me how the coroner’s office was only about ten minutes away, which I can only imagine had just been good planning on his wife’s part.

We made our way to the righthand hallway away from the rancid smell and Dr. Grady stopped at the last room and opened the door. “This would be your room if you’re keen on taking the job.” I imagined all the resident rooms were the same as this one. It was a single room layout that had been remodeled for handicapped accessibility, complete with a large bathroom. The only thing that stood out about the room was the total lack of any windows.

Lost in thought about the idea of living here, Dr. Grady spoke up, “Don’t you worry, this room hasn’t been occupied by anyone else previously.” The thought hadn’t even occurred to me that there was the possibility that people might have passed in the room. If I had to be honest though it wouldn’t have been a deal breaker since I had no belief in anything supernatural and wasn’t religious in the least. Realizing that Dr. Grady was growing impatient from the tapping of his foot, I told him that it looked great and asked when he needed me to start. He replied with an almost hearty “That’s what I wanted to hear.” We left the room and returned to his office to discuss the finer details of the job.

In total there were only four current residents, not counting the recently passed Miss Donahue: each of them occupying the left-hand hall rooms. Dr. Grady told me that lights out is exactly 9pm. He laughed to himself and assured me this wouldn’t be a problem with any of the residents since the only remotely mobile-capable resident is a wheelchair bound Vietnam veteran in his late eighties diagnosed with dementia who they called “Sgt. Sammy”.

Dr. Grady didn’t mention anything specific about the other residents or their names, I didn’t ask either because it’s not my job to know all about them. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t curious at all though. I was however told that there are two full time volunteer nurses that take turns coming in to check on the residents during the weekdays and they tend to the resident rooms themselves.

As we exited the office the sun was starting to set. I was to be moved in and officially start by next Tuesday, just four days from now. Luckily, I didn’t have much to begin with making the move a breeze. I’ve always been sort of a black sheep in the family, so I didn’t have any strong connections with anyone or close friends that I needed to let know I was moving, good-byes and mushy stuff that I didn’t care much for.

It only took me a few trips back and forth and by Monday night I was completely moved in. Thankfully by that time the rancid smell had dissipated entirely so I assumed the coroner had made it around at some point. Still taking in my new surroundings, it took a long while to fall asleep that night. Dr. Grady didn’t mention one thing- every morning at 6am sharp, classical music is played over an intercom system kind of like a wake-up call. The tune was as low-quality as you can possibly imagine. That was an eerie way to start my first day.

Making my way to the reception desk, I approached Caroline with a few questions that were left unanswered in my conversations with Dr. Grady. She and I chatted for a few minutes, and she informed me that the closest store was a little gas station just outside the reservation. Unfortunately, it was about a twenty-minute drive from the hospice home. Regardless I figured it would be a good idea to make the drive later that day and acquaint myself with the folks there.

Manning the register of the little shop was a tall native man that I’d guess to be in his late forties or early fifties. I greeted him as kindly as I could hoping to make a good first impression since it seemed this place would be my only source of food and necessities. He introduced himself as “Luca” and told me that the store is open twenty-four hours a day and either he or his wife will always be there.

We made some small talk until I mentioned exactly where I had just started working. That’s when the mood shifted something fierce. He made a couple strange gestures and spoke in native tongue for a moment before quickly retreating to a back room and returning with a small pouch with a string tied around it that smelt strongly of sage and other herbs. Luca urged me to wear it.

Normally, I would’ve questioned something of that sort, but he wore an extremely worried expression, and I really didn’t want to offend the guy. I quickly tied the pouch around my wrist which visibly pleased him. I thanked him and waved him goodbye before the interaction could get any weirder. As the door closed behind me, I could hear him say in a low and serious tone, “Be cautious, young one.” 

When I returned to the hospice home and made my way in, Carolines eyes instantly met the pouch tied to my wrist and she let out a short laugh. I just shook my head as if to say, “don’t ask”. Without Dr. Grady around her personality really shined and it wasn’t hard to tell she was genuinely a people-person. I mentioned something about how eerily still the place seemed to be.

The response I got was something I didn’t quite expect. She told me that the residents aren’t simply hospice patients, but sadly were all totally estranged from family or simply didn’t have anyone. Each resident was deemed a ward of the state, and visitors weren’t an occurrence whatsoever.

Come to find out Caroline is twenty-six years old, just a few years younger than I. She shared with me that the only reason she’s working the job is because she feels like it’s the best way to honor her mother’s memory.

She told me that her mother had always aspired to be a doctor but couldn’t because of her health, that’s when Dr. Grady came into the picture and soon after her mother's health drastically declined. We chatted long enough that we watched one of the nurses come and go and it was about that time for Caroline to head out too. Before she gathered her things, she showed me a notepad with phone numbers listed and told me to use front desks landline if I needed to call anyone. She then turned the automatic door off and signaled me to lock it behind her.

Around 6:30pm I started making my runs. I was told that I could choose when I start my daily cleanup and decided that since I’m an insomniac that this would be a good time so I could wear myself out a little before trying to sleep. I didn’t even make it halfway to the storage closet before I heard an elderly man’s voice yell at the top of his lungs, “SHUT THE FUCK UP!” It startled the absolute hell out of me and stopped me dead in my tracks. To hear that out of the blue when the place is typically otherworldly silent was like a wake-up call back to reality.

They couldn’t be yelling at me; I hadn’t even made a sound yet. I figured it was probably just the sergeant getting angry with something as old vets are infamously known for being angry fellas. Curious, I started walking towards the sergeant’s door trying to listen in. As soon as I was directly in front of it, he barked again at the top of his lungs. “I SAID SHUT THE FUCK UP!” This was followed by loud thumping on the wall from in his room.

Flat out concerned at that point, I knocked on his door hard enough that he’d hear me through his fit of rage. He called out angrily and stammered a little. “Who-who the hell is it? I-I have a bayonet dammit!” I didn’t want to scare the piss out of the old-timer or give him a heart attack, so I quickly announced myself as the new janitor and told him my name. I could hear a couple old guy grunts and then, “Janitor? Open the door so I can hear you better for Pete’s sake!”

I opened the door cautiously since I didn’t want my end to be met by some old vet’s bayonet. The room was lit by just a single old lampshade in the corner of the room. Its light was very dim keeping me from discerning much of the space. Facing me in his wheelchair was Sgt. Sammy in a night robe, holding on tightly to a very old and rusty bayonet.

Stupidly, I asked the sergeant if everything was alright to which he immediately exclaimed “No! Dammit! Can’t you hear that? Tell the jackass next door to shut it!” As soon as he said that he smacked the wall several times with his old bayonet. The wall he was smacking went to Miss Donahue’s room.

I didn’t have the heart to tell them it had been days since that resident passed, mostly out of concern that he’d go into a dementia driven rage. I told him that I would go “talk” to them, but before I could even turn, he stopped me with, “Hey! Youngin’! What’s your name?” He then rolled closer to me allowing me to make out his features. Sgt. Sammy was dark skinned and very frail. His face and hands were riddled with scars, likely from shrapnel and who knows what else. It didn’t take a genius to tell this man had once seen his share of combat.

Repeating my name to him again, the sergeant promptly asked a following question, “Where ya’ from?” I glanced at my phone for the time, 7:09pm. I needed to get to work, not chat until lights out. I told him I was from here (South Carolina) and that I recently moved in, just down the other hall.

I gestured towards Miss Donahue’s room hoping to end the conversation and go “talk” to her and he stopped me again. “You-you moved into this place?” I nodded my head in agreement, and he said in a low and almost sad voice, “You dumb, dumb son of a bitch.” He then stabbed the bayonet into the door, forcing the door shut in my face.

I was left baffled by the whole encounter. I stood there looking at the sergeants’ door for a moment. Recalling what he said about hearing something, I walked over to the next door, Miss Donahue’s room, and pressed my ear to the door and listened. I didn’t hear any sound after listening for a few seconds and chalked it up to the sergeant just having some sort of PTSD episode or something.

I awoke to music playing late that night and it left me in a state of confusion. In a total stupor I sat up in bed and tried my best to focus. I flipped over my phone to check the time, 3:33am. This irritated the absolute piss out of me because once I’m up, there’s usually no going back to sleep. Then, almost on cue with my irritation the music got louder. It was the classical wake-up tune. Agitated, I forced myself out of bed and see if I could find a way to shut it off.

The moment I opened my door that retched stench was back and ten-fold worse than it was the day of my interview. I had forgotten to eat apparently and dry heaved repeatedly since I had nothing to expel. The smell had to be the equivalent of basking in fresh human shit. Unfortunately for me, that is exactly what it was. When I opened the door, I was met with a pool of diarrhea that had been left directly outside my doorway.

In a fit of gagging, I glanced towards the resident side of the hall. This is what I saw- laying in the dead center of the hallway was one of the residents that I haven't met yet. It was too dark to tell, but they appeared to be completely nude, and vaguely familiar somehow. I tried to call out to them but ended up choking on my own words. Still hunched over from heaving, I pulled myself together and retreated to grab my flashlight. When I returned out to the hallway, avoiding the pool of liquid filth- the resident was gone.

Furious, I went to the storage closet, grabbing the mop bucket and a full bottle of bleach. I got to work once again. I did everything in my power to clean up after the resident given the little light I had and must've mopped the same spot over and over what felt like a hundred times. Even after a ridiculously long, hot shower the stench was simply too overpowering. It stuck to my nose like glue, agitating and infuriating me even further.

At some point I must have passed out from exhaustion and frustration. All I know is that I woke up just short of an hour later, exactly at 6am to the damned tune of the classical wake-up call. With the abhorrent stench still lingering, I made it my goal that day to figure out who in the hell it was that left me that wonderful “present”.

After downing a couple cups of coffee and regaining some clarity, I opened my bedroom door and made my way to the front desk hoping that Caroline would be there. Just the thought of interacting with a normal person brought me to life a little. It was about 7am and the sun was just starting to peek through the few large front windows of the building, these were the only windows the building had except for Dr. Grady’s creepy office window. Seeing daylight settled my nerves immensely, until I saw Caroline.

She was aimlessly tossing papers left and right at the reception desk like she was looking for something but wasn’t sure where to begin. She must have felt my eyes on her because before I could ask what was wrong, she spun around to face me. She looked completely distraught, her long black hair was a mess with a red ribbon barely hanging on.

Her eyes met mine and she instantly started crying hysterically and threw herself into me. I never knew how to react in these kinds of situations, so I just let her cry for a few minutes before she unglued herself from me and fell heavily backwards into her desk chair. By that point my shirt collar was soaked in her tears. She gave me a half-hearted look and apologized, and finally spoke.

“I’m so sorry Elias. I’m an absolute mess right now.” I began to ask her what was going on and she just shook her head vigorously. “Dr. Grady…the nurses, they’re all gone.” Stumped, I asked her what she meant by “gone”. She shook her head again and said, “They all disappeared last night.”

Seeing her like this, I didn’t even want to mention the events of last night to her. It was totally beneath the current situation. After she calmed down a little, she told me that the police would be arriving soon to get a statement from us. About twenty minutes later a police cruiser pulled up right to the front door. 

The officer we spoke with had no information to share and only asked us the most basic questions such as when we last saw them, etc. It was apparent that the local police weren’t taking the situation very seriously. When the officer left, I told Caroline I was going to make a run down to the gas station outside the reservation and offered to bring her with me. She told me she didn’t want to budge in case someone called and didn’t want to leave the residents completely alone. Not wanting to leave her in the frantic state she was in for long, I assured her I would be back as soon as possible.

Speeding off to the gas station like a bat out of hell, I completely disregarded the poor road and smacked every other pothole. I’m pretty sure I was just taking out my anger on my poor truck. The usual twenty or so minute drive quickly became a six-minute drive. I pulled into the dirt parking lot of the gas station and parked haphazardly, jumping out with the engine still running.

When I got inside, I could see Luca sitting behind the front counter. He must have recognized the look of exhaustion on my face and quickly ushered me to the back room. The room was filled top to bottom with all sorts of knick-knacks, tribal related items, and old pictures. Luca picked up a large walkie-talkie and briefly spoke to someone. His tone was gentle as he spoke and the responding voice sounded female, so I assumed it was likely his wife.

We sat face to face just a few feet from each other in the cramped room. He observed me for a moment before he spoke, “Tell me everything.” I did my best to describe everything that had happened last night and how Dr. Grady and the nurses were now missing. As I rambled on in frustration, he didn’t so much as flinch at anything I described. When I finished, he took a long, deep breath and uttered, “He finally snapped.” I guess he could read the look of total bewilderment on my face because he raised a finger as if to tell me to be patient. “Let me explain, young one.” 

Luca began to speak in a serious tone, “We warned the white lady many times.” He continued by saying, “The man who calls himself the doctor, his mind is rotten.” “We once made many visits to that place to give our support, but when that man took notice, he ran us off.” I asked Luca if he knew about his wife’s passing, to which he nodded and said, “She was sick, and a black cloud hung over her.” He continued by telling me how when she had passed that they tried to speak to Dr. Grady to offer condolences and in turn were threatened viciously and told to never return.

I remembered Dr. Grady mentioning something about the kids from the reservation playing pranks and asked Luca about it. He admitted that some of the children had likely overheard the elders speaking on the matter. And as kids do, decided to make a game out of messing with “the angry fat-man.” Luca told me that those children are under a careful watch as they do not want their young ones anywhere near that place out of fear of how Dr. Grady might react. The most important thing he told me that vastly stood out in our whole conversation was that ever since Dr. Grady came into the picture, six people had already gone missing.

With two more people missing as well as Dr. Grady, Luca advised me to pack up and leave as soon as possible. Of course, I had already thought of doing exactly that, but the guilt of leaving Caroline completely alone in that place would eat me alive. Luca gave me plenty of time to collect my thoughts and we soon returned to the storefront. A fair skinned, young native woman now stood behind the counter which I presumed to be Luca’s wife. She must have overheard some of our conversation because she exchanged a very worried look with Luca. They spoke with each other for a moment and then Luca signaled me to come towards them.

I stepped forward and they both embraced me in a bear hug at the same time and performed a short incomprehensible chant, almost whispering it to me. Again, I’m not a touchy-mushy person so the interaction unsettled me more than it helped. I did my best to force a smile and express my gratitude to Luca and his wife who stood before me. In their own way I know they were just trying to be helpful. Before exchanging our farewells, I bought a pack of cigarettes and Luca gave me a lighthearted laugh as if he completely understood. I quit smoking years ago, but my nerves were an absolute wreck. I chain smoked the whole drive back to nightmare I called work, and home.

By the time I returned to the hospice home hours had already passed since I left. I was sure Caroline wondered what took so long or thought I had just taken off at that point. I parked next to her blue Volkswagen “Bug” and made way back in with the mindset of somehow convincing her to leave too. The air in the place hung thicker than ever as I entered. The first thing I noticed was that Caroline wasn’t at the front desk. Concerned, I started up the hallway, then heard a distant conversation. To my left I could see that the sergeant’s door was open and made my way over as I followed the source of voices.

When I got to the door of the sergeant’s room, I could see Caroline and Sgt. Sammy sitting in his room just chatting away. The sergeant was the first to notice me and grumbled something I couldn’t quite make out. Caroline then looked over to me and gave me a half-smile. She gave the sergeant a light touch on his shoulder and got up and joined me in the hallway, closing the sergeant’s door behind her. She was the first to speak up and said, “He’s actually a really kind fella’, a tough nut to crack but still kind.” A thought came to me just as soon as she said that. I asked her if she would consider the other residents’ kind too, hoping to get a little information on them.

“Couldn’t say, none of em’ talk and all of em’ have been bedridden for so long that they can’t stand on their own two feet.” She noted that she had only ever caught quick glimpses of them a handful of times when the nurses would forget to close the doors. Unwillingly, the imagery of the resident I saw somehow crawling all the way to my door using just her arms became stuck in my head. Caroline spoke up again, “Curious are ya’? Follow me.”

Caroline started back towards the reception desk, and I followed. To my surprise she whipped open Dr. Grady’s office door and disappeared for a few moments. When she returned by the reception desk she handed me a small file and said, “We’re not supposed to see this but who in the hell is gonna’ stop us?” Without hesitation I opened the file and laid out what appeared to be each residents’ information next to each other.

I put off the sergeant’s info to the side as I felt I already knew enough about him. The other four, however, left me entirely baffled. They were all about the same ages, early to late sixties and each one looked almost identical to each other with just slightly different facial features. They all had long black hair just like Caroline and pale skin to match. One of these residents was the cause of the mess I had to clean up, that much I knew for sure. But why did they all hold such a close resemblance to Caroline? Each current resident had an extremely crude “YES” written across each respective picture.

All color had drained from Carolines face as she stared blankly at the papers spread across the desk. Then, as if it took everything in her to form the sentence she said, “Why-why do they all look like me?” I was as dumbfounded as she was. Carefully reading each paper, I found that every resident except for the sergeant had been committed due to “Severe post-partum depression”. Underneath that on each paper read “Total catatonic state”.

Staring at the papers in front of us, a realization came to. Miss Donahue’s information wasn’t there. I asked Caroline and she quickly ran back into Dr. Gradys’s office and returned with another file marked “Expired” and threw it down on the desk. The first paper when I opened the file was Miss Donahue’s info, both our eyes met the paper and Caroline collapsed into her desk chair. Miss Donahue was in fact much older than the other residents, yet still held an eerily close resemblance to Caroline. Struck across Miss Donahue’s picture was a crudely written “NO”.

Caroline was clearly petrified by now and I really couldn’t blame her. I brought up the idea of us both leaving. She nearly agreed, then backtracked the idea just as soon as I thought this weird Twilight Zone episode could finally end. “I can’t just leave em’ all here to fend for themselves.” This girl was going to make me pull my own hair out. I tried reasoning with her the best I could, but she was dead set on holding down the fort until the residents could be relocated.

“What about Sgt. Sammy dammit!” She was hysterical. The sergeant was mobile, and it was certainly possible if we could somehow convince him. She had clearly developed a friendship with the old vet and who was I to convince her to abandon him.

I asked if she knew anyone that could look after him at least until he could be moved to another home, she instantly shook her head. The thought of reservation came to mind, and I asked Caroline if she had any contact info for anyone on the reservation. She started to shake her head no, then stopped herself. She went to the reception desk drawers and started shuffling papers around and retrieved a business card and handed it to me. The card read, “Luca’s Stop & Shop” it was like an instant relief to see his name. The card had a number listed and I dialed it as fast as I could into the landline.

The line rang for what seemed like forever until a familiar voice picked up. “Luca’s stop and shop, Luca speaking.” I quickly greeted him and filled him in on the situation. He told me that his people would happily look after the sergeant until another home could take him in. To my dismay, he said that none of his people would be able to pick him up until the morning. He conveyed that if I can bring the sergeant myself as soon as possible that it would not be a problem.

Out of options I quickly thanked Luca and told him I’d get right back to him. Caroline must have caught the gist of the conversation and nodded in agreement. Now all we had to do was convince this cranky old vet to come with us. I felt Caroline would be the better person for the job and left it up to her. I stood off to the side out of eyeshot as Caroline lightly knocked on his door. She spoke softly and said, “Sgt. Sammy, got a quick minute? I need to talk to ya’.” The sergeant must have super hearing when it comes to pretty voices because he immediately answered with, “Ho ho, must be my birthday! Well now, come on in!” The door stayed open, and I listened in. She cut right to the chase with him using as soft as a tone that she possibly could.

I guess Carolines charm didn’t quite cut it because within a couple minutes the sergeant was cursing and yelling at her to get the fuck out of his room, calling her a lying succubus among many other derogatory things. She tried pleading with him but got no further and eventually gave up. As she exited the sergeant’s room, she wore a look of total defeat. We were at a loss. With Caroline determined to stay, I decided the best course of action was to call Luca again and at least let him know that we were going to hold down the fort until the morning. It was 6:49pm, and any hint of daylight was now gone.

The landline was dead, my brain went into total overdrive. In disbelief, Caroline grabbed the phone from me and started frantically dialing numbers. She had mentally broken down by now and began to pace up and down the halls before dropping against one of the walls, curling herself into a ball and hugging her knees. She began to repeat over and over, “I’m alone. I’m alone. I’m alone.”

My presence didn’t seem to be much of a comfort. I crouched in front of her and tried my best to calm her, but it was like I didn’t exist. I think I was the one who truly felt alone. Caroline stayed like that for a long time until fatigue got the best of her, still curled up in a ball against the wall. Every couple of minutes or so I could hear her lightly humming what sounded like some lullaby in her sleep.

Creepy? Sure. Completely out of the ordinary? No. I figured it was probably just her own subconscious trying to calm her with a childhood song or something. I didn’t want to just leave her there, so I carefully picked her up and carried her to my room. I gently placed Caroline in my oversized recliner, and she quickly adjusted to the new comfort while still sound asleep.

12:36am, there was no way could willingly go to sleep. I made a cup of coffee to put off any concern of dozing off. Persistently, I watched the time go by on my phone, eying my door every now and then. To say I was feeling paranoid would be a total understatement. I glanced over at Caroline a couple times with the thought of her getting up and stabbing me in the neck or something but pushed the notion to the back of my mind. Afterall, she was sound asleep to the extent of snoring loud enough that it was kind of funny.

Between listening to Caroline snore and watching the time on my phone I might as well have been counting sheep. I was awakened to total discomfort in a pool of my own sweat; my senses came flooding all at once and smacked me like a fucking freight train. The smell. The smell was back and more indescribably repulsive than ever forcing me to vomit uncontrollably. My room door was wide open. Caroline was gone. I nearly jolted out the room to begin yelling for her but was stopped dead in my tracks at the doorway.

The classical tune rang out. It blared at full volume and completely off pitch, loud enough to make anyone lose their sanity. I felt a repetitive thumping through the floor. The thumping persisted continuously, copying the melody of the music. My eyes then fixated on something red on the floor just outside my door, a red ribbon. My brain told me to find Caroline, but my gut was churning painfully as if to tell me to just run. I stepped across the threshold of my doorway into the hall.

There I stood in the wide hallway, contemplating my life choices while my eardrums were blasted with deafening music. Still fixated on the red ribbon, I forced my gaze down the resident hall. The only source of light was the overhead lights in the hall which flickered on and off dimly and intermittently. After staring into the abyss of the hallway for what felt like forever, I was able to make out a figure I recognized. Dr. Grady was facing the empty wall opposite the resident rooms. I only recognized him as Dr. Grady from his unmistakable figure. There was more wrong with this sight than I could have possibly imagined. He was stark naked, bathed head to toe in red.

The thumping vibrations continued, now feeling more like violent earthquakes. The lights stopped flickering for a split moment, just long enough for me to locate the cause of the unearthly tremors.

Dr. Grady was swinging one arm overhead over and over to the melody of the music. Within his grasp was a lock of long, black hair. Attached to the hair looked like the remnants of mangled head. He swung it against the wall, over and over rhythmically to the tune. With every swing I could make out chunks of flesh and blood splattering in every direction. I tried to yell bloody murder at the top of my lungs, but the music drowned out everything but the pounding quakes of the head beating against the wall.

I found myself rooted in fear, trying to take in the nonsensical brutality I was witnessing. He wasn’t alone. Spread out across the hall were all the residents that resembled Caroline. Each one had a mix of limbs forcefully removed and had been laid stomach down. One was still barely conscious; I could see her eyes glued to me in total fear like she was begging for help.

Bolting for the front door at full sprint deciding that if I was to die, I’d at least die doing everything in my power to escape this place. By the time I was about to make the turn towards the entrance, I could see that Dr. Grady was now facing towards me wearing a grin that stretched nearly ear to ear. In a grotesque act of mockery, he held the mangled head in front of his lower half with both hands and began a vulgar thrusting motion. As I passed by Dr. Grady, I could now tell that the foul odor was protruding from him. It was as if he had been sleeping in the filth of a sewer for days.

Complete and total desperation to survive blinded me as I continued toward the entrance. I slipped and stumbled numerous times. The entire main hall up to the front door was covered in blood, masking any existence of the porcelain white floors. Indiscernible body parts were strewn all over the place and I couldn’t help but imagine that it all belonged to Caroline and that I was being forced to run through her like some kind of sick gauntlet.

No less than twenty feet from the automatic front door, I realized it was locked. I could tell by the small red light at the top of the door which signified “locked”. Locked or not, I wasn’t stopping. I ran straight at the door taking heavy steps to keep myself from slipping sending waves of gore splashing with each step. I crashed through the entrance at full force sending thousands of glass shards everywhere and didn’t stop until I was in my truck. I scrambled for my keys out of the center console and turned on my brights as fast as I could, flooding the front of the building in light.

Sitting in the truck, drenched in blood that both did and didn’t belong to me, I could feel the shards of glass that stuck into my arms and legs now. The adrenaline must have run its course and the pain felt like hundreds of needles burning into me. Fighting through the pain, my eyes never moved from the shattered entrance from the moment the brights came on. I was ready to throw the truck into gear and run anything down that dared come out of that building. I couldn’t explain it, but there was no way I was going to drive away and let Dr. Grady just walk out of there.

The dashboard in the truck reads 5:25am. Between the shards of glass stuck in me and the torment I had just experienced, I was extremely nauseous; I can still vaguely hear the music. I don’t know if it was still playing or if it was just ringing in my head. Remembering I had a pack of smokes, I dug around for them in the driver side door, eyes still glued to the building.

The moment I focused on the tip of the cigarette and lit it, something from inside the building slowly came into view. Being pushed out by Dr. Grady; still sitting in his wheelchair was Sgt. Sammy. They had stopped right outside the entrance and Dr. Grady just stood there with the same twisted grin.

The sergeant’s head was tilted back, and his trusty bayonet had been sent straight down his throat leaving just the handle visible. I had either seen enough or was just delirious enough to not really react. I took a long drag off my smoke and said to myself, “Who’s the dumb son of bitch now.” I could feel my mouth move, but I couldn’t hear my own words. I put the truck in gear and floored it.
