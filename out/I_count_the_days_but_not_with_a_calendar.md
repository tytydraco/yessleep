I was about eighteen, still in the mindset of being mature but doing stupid things. Like any eighteen year old. I had received my drivers license about three months before and was deadset on completing some sort of ‘cross-state adventure.’ Alone. After all, I was leaving for college in another state a couple months later and although I would still call my parents after any minor problem I faced, I believed I had reached the pinnacle of independence.

My parents didn’t believe so, telling me that an eighteen year old girl travelling alone day and night across a US state border was not safe, so they arranged me to go to a ‘camp’ of sorts. I was irritated, of course, but I trusted my parents more than myself, so I agreed. I had to rush the next morning. I had always had issues with punctuality, and the morning I was supposed to be picked up by a small caravan of five, I had slept in. The five people were all distant family friends of my parents. I didn’t know who they were, but my parents decided they were close enough to keep me safe, but not too close so that my sense of ‘independence’ wasn’t diminished. 

It was a long drive: eight hours to be exact. It was also quiet. I hadn’t realised that these kids, around my age, had also been forced into this without knowing each other. I guess I finally felt some sort of camaraderie to them, the type of feeling you get from complaining about teachers and petty grievances in school. When we arrived, I was shocked by the number of people. Four hundred. I had imagined some indie camp my parents had seen on the local bulletin board. Not this. Four of the other kids were too, except for this one girl. She must have been a bit younger, maybe seventeen. Instead of a look of shock or amazement, she stared down with a gloomy look. As if she knew something we didn’t.

The camp was fine, boring even. With the same kind of monotonous itinerary of an elementary summer camp, but stranger. With no devices, no communication to the outside world, not even any ways of identifying the time. Calendars were sparse, something about “time flying when you’re having fun” which although I couldn’t tell the time, definitely didn’t feel like it was.

However, after what felt like about a week but could have been less, the first disappeared. I hadn’t noticed, after all I only really tried to converse with those five kids I had travelled here with, until that seventeen year old girl told us. This regularly happened, with a new camper leaving every day. In fact, I had used it as a way to tell the time I had been here. I thought maybe their parents had brought them home, but when one left after another, that possibility started to seem less likely. 

Using this metric, it’s been about a year. 356 campers who have left. The only ones left are the seventeen year old girl, two of the guys from the group I came with and me. Maybe my parents never maybe wanted me to be independent. Maybe they wanted to teach me to never leave them again. The counsellors are no longer the sweet people they started as. They pass us disgusting breakfasts and dinners with not contempt, but pity. Activities have turned into tests of intelligence, strength and endurance, and although I succeeded for some, I failed too many. I’m leaving tomorrow, back to my home in Maine. Apparently the rest of the children were as well. We are given one opportunity to use a device before we leave, which I am using right now. And I only have one worry. If the ones who fail leave, then what sort of torture will the last one standing be subjected to? And after knowing all of this, what if that seventeen year old girl knew she would be picked last? She wasn’t sad. She was terrified.

I have heard of cults like this. Diminishing a large group of people down to one person. Someone who they can use as… I don’t know what. I suppose I’m glad I’m leaving. I fear facing my parents, learning their true intention for why they would send me to such a torture. But I know one thing for sure.

I am dependent on them. I will never leave home again.
