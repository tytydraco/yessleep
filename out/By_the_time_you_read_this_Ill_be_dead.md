I live, well, lived in a family of five. We were constantly moving to ghetto houses every 2 years which I found odd. All of which were small and barely had any room, so growing up was a bit challenging, especially with my two brothers.

They were both 7 years old, while I was 13, so you can imagine they were the golden pairs. They both would always whine to get their way, and throw the worst tantrums you will ever witness to get it. 

However, sometimes my parents who cherished and spoiled them beyond comprehension sometimes got fed up with their behavior, which is how this whole thing started.

Before the whole thing started, we ended up moving once again. This time, the house seemed like a mansion compared to our old  neighborhood, and the neighborhood could be Beverly Hills for all I could comprehend.

So me and family settled in after some time, and everything was good, I was at the peak of my life until I started getting Insomnia again. My parents took me to a doctor, but I could tell he hated me.

He wasn’t all playful like he would to a kid, which I was grateful he wasn’t, but he wouldn’t even ask me a simple “How are you” or even a “Hey”. Just looked at me with a blank face resisting the urge to frown.

After a couple of weeks of meeting with my Doctor, my Mom came up to me with something in her hand. She told me, “Honey, I finally got your medication from Dr. Wanan” She showed me the pills I will be taking, except I found this odd because I saw the exact same bottle of pills on the Doctors desk, except the pills inside had a different color and even a different shape. While I did find this odd, I ignored it, popped the pill, and went back to playing my game.

I was actually dozing off, and I eventually fell asleep. But what I experienced during the sleep makes me wish I just kept my former ongoing insomnia. I was in a nightmare, but this one was different from any other nightmare I had.

I was in my living room, watching Television like I usually was, except I saw that my backyard door was open, I got up to close it, and I went back down. Except when I looked back it was still open, so I tried to close it again.

When I went back to the couch, it was still open, in fact, it looked like I never even budged it from how it originally was. 

I gave up, thinking the door was broken, so I went to tell my parents, but they weren’t there. I thought that my parents were busy somewhere with my brothers, so I thought nothing of it and continued watching television.

Until I saw a shadow walk past the backyard, my heart pounded harder than thunder. I immediately ran upstairs for my parents, but then i remembered that they weren’t here. When I realized that I wanted to die, I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and dialed 911, but for some reason the called was literally declined.

It took another pair of balls to grow out  to check the yard, and nothing was there, but I heard a door closed. When I looked back, the backyard door was closed and locked, I ran to the fence door to escape but it was jammed. 

This is it, I’m dead, I thought to myself.

I heard a voice. I was scared from my hair to my toe nails. “This is how you open it, watch closely” it said. The backyard door opened, and 1 minute later an entity with a black body and what appeared to a distorted human mask for a head. “What th-“ before I could finish what I was gonna say, I felt a pressure in my stomach, I looked down and the demon was staring into my eyes, as he penetrates his hand into my stomach even further.

I vomit blood, and he punches me in my hip, I am sent flying as a loud crack is all that’s heard. I thought I was gonna be sent to a different state until I hit my fence. The demon smiles and lunges towards me. I put my arms up to shield my head, however, I then feel intense sharp pressure in the back of my head. He wasn’t trying to attack me, he was distracting me from his partner.

Before I have time to look back, a third demon hops the fence and somehow  gouges out my eyes in a flash. 

I was in too much pain to even care about the demons, until I realized something. I can’t see anymore.

All I can do is hear the laughter of the demons and then unbearable pain all through my body, they were eating my flesh. I hear my parents, but instead of them screaming, they get closer and eventually also chew on my body. Soon after I wake up, with my heart pounding so much I thought I was having a heart attack.

I tried informing my parents, but all they did was say it was a nightmare. I told them how I was afraid to sleep and told me to take another one of those pills. I did, however, after the trauma of the nightmare, they took me to the doctor.

The doctor who gave me the medication, Dr Wanan, was visibly confused and irritated. “You want to sleep, then take these pills!” I was shocked, my parents didn’t mind this. I told him about the nightmare, and he smiled, “ What happened during the nightmare?” I teared up as I told him the story, he hugged me and said “Don’t worry, keep taking the pills and they should go away”. 

I then pop one of the pills and soon we were ready to leave. However as he weirdly hugs me one last time, a bottle of pills fall out, the top of the bottle has a sign that is familiar to a biohazard sign. I know one of these. My grandpa  used to be a doctor,  told me those same bottles of pills with the biohazard sign  were used in POW camps to dispose of useless men. 

When I looked further into the bottle, it had the same color and size as the ones I took. I then look to his desk to see the bottle of pills that are in his “Insomnia” section. 

I clicked to a realization, he was giving me pills to give a heart attack and kill me in my sleep.

It was too late, I had already swallowed one. I immediately knew, this one would for sure kill me. It’s 4 hours until my bedtime, and I’m making the best of the 4 hours.

4 hours.
