When I first met Timothy, he seemed like an ordinary guy. We worked together at a small marketing firm, and he was known for his quiet demeanor and impeccable work ethic. Timothy was mute, so he always communicated in sign language, something I was familiar with since both my parents were deaf. Over time, I developed a crush on him, drawn to his kindness and the gentle way he communicated.

Our interactions were brief and professional, but the more I got to know him, the more intrigued I became. Despite his silence, Timothy had a way of making me feel understood. There was something in his eyes, though, that always seemed guarded, like he was hiding a deep secret.

One late night, we were working in the office together. Everyone else had gone home, leaving the building eerily silent. I was struggling with a presentation when Timothy tapped me on the shoulder and offered to help. Grateful for the assistance, I agreed.

As we worked side by side, I made a joke about our boss. It wasn’t particularly funny, but I expected at least a smile. Timothy looked at me, and for the first time since I'd known him, he smiled.

I wish he hadn’t.

His teeth were extraordinarily long. Not just a bit out of the ordinary, but unnaturally long, sharp, and perfectly white. They didn’t look like teeth at all, more like fangs. The sight of them made my skin crawl.

He quickly covered his mouth, his eyes wide with fear and embarrassment. He signed, “I'm sorry. It's a condition. I don’t like to show them.”

I tried to laugh it off, but the image of those teeth was burned into my mind. I could barely concentrate on the work in front of me. When he left that night, I felt a strange sense of relief, like a weight had been lifted from my shoulders.

Over the next few weeks, I avoided Timothy as much as possible. It wasn’t easy since we were still working on the same project, but I managed to limit our interactions to emails and brief sign-language conversations. He seemed to sense my discomfort and became even more withdrawn.

Then, one evening, I stayed late again, trying to finish the presentation. The office was dark, the only light coming from my computer screen. I heard a noise behind me and turned to see Timothy standing in the doorway, his eyes wide and frantic.

“I need your help,” he signed, his hands trembling.

Against my better judgment, I followed him. He led me to the basement of the building, a place I had never been before. The air was damp and cold, and the flickering lights cast eerie shadows on the walls.

“What’s going on?” I asked nervously.

He didn’t answer. Instead, he led me to a small, dimly lit room at the far end of the basement. Inside, there was a single chair and a mirror on the wall, revealing our shared reflection. Timothy closed the door behind us and turned to face me.

“I need to show you something,” he signed, his expression filled with desperation. “But you have to promise not to scream or run away.”

I nodded, fear gripping my chest. He slowly opened his mouth, wider than any human should be able to. His teeth were even longer than I remembered, extending far past his lips. They looked like they could tear through flesh with ease.

I backed away, my heart pounding. “What… what are you?” I squealed, my movements jerky and frightened.

He closed his mouth and sighed, tears welling in his eyes. “I don’t know. I’ve always been like this. My parents abandoned me when I was a baby. I’ve tried to live a normal life, but it’s getting harder to control… the urges.”

“What urges?” I asked, my legs wobbly like jelly.

“To feed,” he signed back, his expression filled with sorrow. “On human flesh. But there's more. I have feelings for you, and I didn't want you to find out this way. I brought you here because if you screamed or tried to run, I would have to... stop you.”

My mind was spinning. The fear was overwhelming, but so was a twisted sense of pity and an undeniable lingering affection for him. “I... I think I have feelings for you too,” I stuttered, slowly reaching out to feel his shirt, feel his heart pound like mine from pure adrenaline. “But this is a lot to process.”

“I need your help,” he signed desperately, taking a step back. “I don’t want to hurt anyone, but the hunger is getting worse. Please, you have to help me.”

“I… I’ll try,” I nodded, not knowing what else to do.

In the weeks that followed, Timothy and I grew closer. Our relationship evolved into something deeper and more intimate. We spent countless nights together, researching his condition, searching for any information that might explain what he was and how to control his urges. During those late nights, we shared our fears and vulnerabilities, holding each other close as we sought answers. Despite the horror of his situation, I found myself falling for him even more. We began sleeping together, though we had to get creative with our intimacy.

As we lay tangled in the sheets, I joked, laughing to ease our grim situation, “You know, I’ve wondered—are you a better kisser or a better biter?” Timothy looked at me, his eyes twinkling with a mixture of amusement and relief. “Oral is off the menu. Or let’s just say,” I continued, “if I’m ever asked to rate your oral skills, I’ll have to give you a ‘sharp’ review.”

One night, I received a frantic text from Timothy. He was crying, begging me to come to his apartment. When I arrived, the door was ajar. I entered cautiously, calling his name.

I found him in the bathroom, hunched over the sink. His face was covered in blood, and he was sobbing uncontrollably. On the floor lay a mutilated body, a stranger I didn’t recognize. The sight of it made me gag, and I stumbled back, fear overwhelming my senses.

Timothy looked at me with pleading eyes. “I couldn't stop myself,” he signed, his fingers twitching in discomfort. “I'm so sorry.”

Panicking, I turned and ran out of his apartment. I couldn't process what I had seen, and my mind was in chaos. Was that his true nature? How many times had this happened before, and how could I have ignored it to get close to him? This was crazy, I had to do something.

Later that night, I received a call from the police. Timothy had slit his wrists. When they found his body, all of his teeth were missing, torn out. The police were baffled, and the stranger's body was nowhere to be found.

The days that followed Timothy's death were a blur of grief and guilt. I was haunted by the images of that night—Timothy’s final moments, the bloody scene, and the cold, lifeless gaze of the stranger. I was tormented by the thought that perhaps I could have done something to save him. My nights were filled with nightmares of fangs and blood, my days clouded with the crushing weight of loss and unanswered questions.

I threw myself into investigating Timothy’s past, hoping to find some semblance of closure or understanding. But the more I delved, the more I felt a growing sense of dread. The deeper I got, the more I realized how much of Timothy’s life had been shrouded in mystery.

My search led me to a small town where I found Timothy’s ex-girlfriend, Shontoll.

Shontoll was hesitant to talk to me at first, but eventually, she opened up, revealing nothing significant about Timothy but her discomfort was palpable. She seemed nervous, avoiding eye contact and fidgeting constantly.

“Timothy was... complicated,” she said, her voice tight. “He had his issues, but he never talked about them much.”

“Did he have any family? Anyone close?” I asked, sensing she was hiding something.

“No, not that I know of,” Shontoll replied quickly, almost too quickly. “I think it's best if you leave now.”

Her abruptness and the way she avoided my questions made my skin prickle with unease. I thanked her and turned to leave, but just as I reached the door, I heard a small giggle from another room.

I paused, my hand on the doorknob. “Is there someone else here?”

Shontoll's face paled. “No, it's just... Please, you need to go.”

But I couldn't ignore the sound. I took a step towards the noise, and before Shontoll could stop me, the door to the other room swung open. A small child toddled out, looking up at me with curious eyes. He smiled at me, and my blood ran cold. His teeth were long and sharp, just like his father’s.

Shontoll quickly scooped him up, her expression a mix of fear and desperation. “You need to leave,” she said, her voice shaking. “Now.”

Realization hit me like a freight train. Shontoll knew about Timothy's condition all along. She had to have been the one to mutilate Timothy and remove his teeth, perhaps to hide the evidence of their child's true nature.

As I backed away, Shontoll's expression hardened. “You know too much now,” she whispered. “I can't let you leave here alive.”

Panic surged through me as I turned and ran, my heart pounding in my chest. I could hear her footsteps behind me, gaining on me. I dashed out of the house and into the night, desperately trying to find my way back to safety.

I reached my car, hands shaking as I fumbled with the keys. Just as I got in, I saw Shontoll reaching the door, her face twisted with determination. I locked the doors and sped away, my mind racing.

As I drove, the weight of what I had uncovered bore down on me. Should I expose the truth about Timothy and his child, potentially ruining their lives and legacy, or should I keep their secret, living with the horror I had uncovered? Should I hope that Shontoll would find a way to stop her child from developing into a new Timothy?

What would it mean for the child if the world knew about his condition? Would he be ostracized, experimented on, or worse? And what about Timothy's memory? Did he deserve to be remembered for his kindness and struggle, or should the monstrous truth be revealed?

As the night swallowed me, I realized that some questions might never have clear answers. Life is a series of moral dilemmas, a tightrope walk between right and wrong. Sometimes, the line blurs, and all that remains is the choice we can live with.

With the darkness closing in, I drove on, unsure of what to do, and haunted by the thought that some secrets are better left buried.
