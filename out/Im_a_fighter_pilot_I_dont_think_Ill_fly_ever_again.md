For some context: I'm a pilot in the F-16 for the Royal Netherlands Air Force.

Today I was on a regular joyride with 2 others we'll call them Sam and Jack. We got a radio message from the airbase that there was an unresponsive aircraft flying over Netherlands airspace. They told us to intercept it. As we were about to catch up with the plane we lost all connections with eachother and the airbase. This is where things started to be odd.

After a little bit we were flying next to the aircraft. It seemed to be a civilian private jet. Probably some billionair's. As we try to contact it we get no reaction this is also when we discovered our radio systems weren't working any longer.

Luckily we still had thought of these moments a while ago and practiced sign language. So we used that communicate. I told them I'd go check out the cockpit, Sam would check out the left side of the plane. Jack the right side for any sign of life. As I fly to the cockpit and look in on the first sight there seemed to be nothing so I get back to my mates who also finished checking the windows. Jack said it was all clear. Sam looked absolutely horrified.

As we see the look on Sam's face we try to ask him what's wrong. He looked absolutely frozen so me and Jack try to get him go communicate but it looked like something controlled his mind to completely freeze his body. So me and Jack decide to look for what he possibly could've seen. So we check out the left side of the plane but both of us couldn't see anything off so we decide to head back to Sam to check out his condition. He was gone. There was no trail left of him. We didn't hear any explosions whatsoever. After a little arguing we finally decide that Jack goes looking for him or any trails left on the path we were flying meanwhile I check out the plane some more. So there he went. I first decide to take a second look at the cockpit when it struck me. 

I finally understand what Sam has seen. It was my dad's face. But it wasn't him at the same time. Because he died 7 years ago in plane crash and thats when I realized. The plane we intercepted was the exact same plane he pilotted. His face looked pale white. A shade of white I'd never seen before. Big black eyes. I could look right into them and what looked like I could see the crash right in his eyes. A waterfall of tears coming out of his eyes. Not just tears. It was dark red. The color or blood. A mouth with a wide smile. Inhumane wide. So wide a regular person's lips would tear apart.

I tried to turn away but I couldn't. His big black eyes overwhelmed me. It looked like he controlled me. I finally managed to look away from that horrifying face. That's when I saw Jack returned. He told me he saw Sam's jet in the sea but Sam disappeared.

Jack saw the look on my face still horrified. He asked me what was wrong and I explained everything that happened. That's when I saw the same look Sam had on his face and hesitantly pointed upwards. I look up and there it was. My dad. It scared the living life out of me and scared I start pulling stick nearly crashing into the jet we intercepted. I try to maneuver that monster of my jet but it doesn't work. It's like he was glued to the glass of my cockpit. Pulling 9G's and almost damaging my plane's airframe he finally let go. 

I sighed a sign of relief and return to Jack. But he still had the same look on his face Sam had and his finger pointing up. After signing and deploying flares for some time I was finally able to get his mind back to reality he still looked horrified after what he saw. We thought we were finally done and decided to shoot down that doomed plane. As we move into attack position we get a lock on the engines  and signal to open fire. Just as I was about the press the fire button my dad appeared out of thin air on Jack's cockpit. I try to shoot down the plane ro hopefully end this curse but it wasn't working for some reason. 

This is the part that made me quit my job. He broke Jack's cockpit glass and pulled him out of the cockpit instantly killing him. Jack's plane goes down with a smoking engine. I decided to retreat.

As I retreated the plane turned around following me and I could clearly see my dad now controlling it....
