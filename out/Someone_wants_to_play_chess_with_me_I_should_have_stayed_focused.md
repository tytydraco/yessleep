I never cared much for chess. It always felt like something ancient and impenetrable, like a church sermon in a language I didn’t speak. I thought it was a thing for quiet minds who didn't care for long silences, and relatives who knew how to sit in the same room without needing to fill it. That wasn’t me. I grew up on noise : my entire childhood consisted of video games, loud dinners, and anxiety.

But then came *The Queen’s Gambit*.

I'm sure you've heard of it. Honestly, I didn't even mean to start watching it. Emily put it on one night while I was half-scrolling through my phone, the way you do when you're not really trying to be present. But something about the show pulled at me. The weight of the pieces. The precision of each move. The way silence could become tension, and tension, somehow, beauty. I watched one episode, then another. Then all of them. By the end of the week, I’d ordered a cheap wooden board online. I started watching tutorials late into the night, playing games against bots that beat me ten times before I finally won once. And when I did win (as in, when the bot somehow blundered), I felt something bloom in my chest : a mix of control and elegance. I enjoyed playing, and I started getting quite invested.

It became a quiet ritual. I just played a few games before bed; it was a hobby.

The email arrived on a Tuesday. A gray one, the kind where the clouds feel like they’re pressing on your skin. I’d just finished eating cold leftovers, something truly forgettable, and was curled up on the couch with Emily, half-listening to her talk about weekend plans while my thumb scrolled thoughtlessly across the screen.

Then I saw it.

**"Subject: Care for a game? :)"**

No sender. No address. Just that single line and a link.

I showed it to Emily.

"Huh, that's a weird one. Probably a scam. Don’t click random links," she said, brushing hair from her face.

But I did. It was dumb, I know. I tapped the screen without really thinking. Maybe because the message was way too uncommon, and I was being way too curious.

The screen blinked once and there it was: black background, a chessboard with pieces on it. Extremely minimalistic : no ads, no buttons. Just two words at the top of my screen:

**"Your move."**

I hovered for a second. Then played e4; king's pawn, a very standard opening. Safe. The bot responded with e5, equally standard. We went back and forth for a few moments. My moves careful and cautious. Its replies cold and immediate.

After about fifteen moves, I slipped. A lazy trade, one pawn down. Annoyingly enough, the top of my screen was showing a sad face emoji, as if trying to taunt me. I sighed, turned my phone off, and immediately felt the weight behind my eyes. That heavy, syrupy exhaustion that doesn’t grow slowly but lands all at once.

"I’m gonna crash," I muttered.

Emily didn’t look up. 

"Don’t let it keep you up all night."

I barely made it to the bedroom before I passed out, clothes still on, my phone still in my hand.

I woke up to six missed calls from David, the father of one of my best friends.

At first, I thought it was a pocket dial, or maybe a favor he needed; something benign. But the voicemail I listened to was just five seconds of silence, followed by a breath. A shaky inhale, like someone trying not to cry. I called him back with my heart already sinking. the words came slowly, like they were trying not to be said.

"It's about Josh… there was an accident."

Josh and I were very close. He had been in a car crash late last night. He wasn't even drunk; lost control on a curve, was probably driving slightly too fast. The police said it was quick. No suffering. Like that somehow made it easier to hold.

I sat on the edge of the bed, phone still in my hand, and stared at the wall for fifteen minutes. My ears were ringing. I felt completely hollowed out. Then, mechanically, I opened my phone's browser. The website on which I was playing the game last night was still there. It took me what felt like ages to make sense of the new message lingering at the top of the screen.

**"Every move counts. :)"**
