I'm all alone.
I don't mean that in a 'im all alone I have no one' way, I'm literally all alone.

I'll start with what I remember I suppose? Please bare with me.

Tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick that constant noise would drive me mad if it wasn't the only thing I could hear.

I woke up in the hospital this morning, cold so so cold and silent, no beeps no footsteps nothing. Frost on the window, there was frost before I closed my eyes that night the freezing tarmac sticking to my skin. I can't remember I can't remember I can't remember, was that today? When was it? It must have been yesterday? I think or a week ago, I'm confusing myself and probably you too. I'm sorry.

As I was saying I woke up in the hospital, which makes sense I think I was in a crash? I can't quite remember, we was on the way to Cheltenham I know that. To pick up my friend. Then black. Then looking at the tarmac my body glued to the road I heard crunching of glass, and saw lights flashing, a big scream then I woke up.

I woke up to no one, no sound, no people, no lights, nothing.
Just a key slipped under my door and an empty iv in my arm.

Clothes in a pile on the chair next to me too cold for the weather, you could see my breath. A white puff as I sat there.

I got dressed, looked for my phone to call well, anyone someone I can't remember their name. It was dead anyway.
I pulled on my socks looking out the window, that's when I noticed just how quiet it was. Nothing moved. Nothing cried. Nothing spoke. It was like everyone had left and I hadn't got the memo.

Tick tock tick tock tick tock, that infernal clock never stops but it brings me comfort.

I opened the door and walked out, I slipped the key in my pocket, I still have it now.
There was mess everywhere, equipment on the floor. 

Holes in walls, blood everywhere
Everywhere.
Lining the walls
Plastering equipment like a fresh coat of paint.

Meat chunks... Attached to bone.
Everywhere I look.

and then I saw the hand.

I ran, hoping I'd find someone, anything I didn't know where I was going but I ran down stairs, tripping on rubbish coating the floor, I made it to the lobby and slipped over in a puddle on blood.
More and more blood, The copper smell shooting up my noise as I was covered in the thick, coagulated mess. I still have some on me, I'll have to try and find a tap that works.

That's when I heard the tapping. 
TapTapTapTap.   TapTap.  
TapTapTapTap.   TapTapTapTapTap.
TapTapTap.          TapTapTap.

The first noise. Like cold water had been poured over me I went still and ridged.
I forced myself up and I pushed the door and I ran, I ran, I ran, I ran. 
Why did I run?
How could I have been so stupid.
There's Nothing, nobody, nowhere. I don't know what to do, what can I do?? 
NOTHING
nothing.
I'm scared. 
Calm down you're safe.

I found a Tesco, and found an office. 
It's where i am now. Speaking to you.
Someone liked to keep their login on a post it note.
 I can't get on anything else.
I tried the news.
Twitter.
Even Facebook.
Nothing. 

Only Reddit but I still might get nothing.
I'm getting used to nothing.

They have electricity but I can't figure out how to make the water work. Nothing here but me and the clock. 
Ticking and tocking.
 It's 19:23pm. It's pitch black. 
The silence is worse now and this blanket isn't helping much. The Frost is creeping it's way in, I can feel it in my bones. no heating, just my luck. The world is out to get me today.
I keep picking at the sleeve of this jumper I borrowed from the hook on the door, it's a bit useless at keeping me warm.

I have a book too. I found it tucked in the draw, and my phone is charging. I think i might not be totally alone. Just can't contact anyone yet.
 I hope. 
Please. 
I don't want to be alone. 
I keep thinking I can hear noises.
A howling in the distance. 
And the screams the follow. 
I'm going mad.
I know it's not real. I know I seem mad. I'm not I promise. I promise. I'm just cold and scared. I don't want to be alone. Please. Is anyone there?
