Yes, it probably sounds insane... I should start with the backstory, but God, how hard it is to remember the simple, happy times before everything that happened...

I met my wife, Katherine, when she was twenty-four and I was twenty-eight. We lived in a small town in Kentucky, you’d have trouble finding it even with a map and the population was tiny, everyone knew each other. I’d worked as an electrician all my life, first at a factory, then I started my own small business: repairs, wiring, private jobs. My love life had never really worked out until I met her.

She worked as an elementary school teacher, smiled at every child, was kind and polite to everyone. My Katherine was the only ray of light in the darkness around me.

I loved her for her simplicity. She could find joy in the most ordinary things: morning coffee, the smell of wet grass, a cheap movie on the couch. We didn’t have much money, but we had peace, a home, a dog, and that feeling that everything was right, that everything would be fine.

I spent evenings fixing things while she wrote lesson plans or knitted. Sometimes we’d sit in silence, listening to crickets, or stay up all night talking about everything and nothing, thinking about children and what we’d name them.
Back then, it felt like life had finally found its meaning.

The problems began maybe two months ago. At first small things. She started having trouble sleeping, then began looking at me strangely, as if something in my face disturbed her.

I asked if everything was okay, and she laughed:

“Sorry, just tired. The kids at school are driving me crazy".

Gradually though I can’t even say exactly when it got worse. She slept less. Not because she had insomnia, but because she was afraid to fall asleep.

I asked her what was wrong, but she said she was fine. Still, when we lay together, she’d suddenly get up and go into another room, returning only at dawn. She started having nightmares, but never told me what they were.

One day I lost my temper… You have to understand, I was just worried about my wife. From the lack of sleep she started to look worse—dark circles under her eyes, red eyes, pale skin. She lost weight, and every time I tried to help, she pushed me away. So I sat her down across from me and directly asked what she was dreaming about.

She was silent for a long time, trembling and glancing at me furtively, as if… She was afraid. And then, when tears began to roll down her cheeks, she whispered:

“There’s a man in my dreams… God, I… I’m scared, Tom…”.

I went to hug her, and when I reached for her, she flinched, as if I’d frightened her. After that, things seemed to get better or so I thought. How wrong I was.

She used to ask how my day went, but now she just stared out the window. With each passing day, she spoke to me less and less, her words short and dry, and then she’d go to the bathroom or kitchen for some “errands,” closing the door behind her. And it wasn’t just the silence her eyes had changed.

If before they were green, emerald-like, full of life and love, now her gaze made my spine go cold.

There wasn’t anger or hatred there, no… It was something closer to mistrust. Wariness, as if she was seeing me for the first time.

Over the next week I began to feel anxious, a strange burning under my skin. As if something was wrong, but I couldn’t tell where the crack was until I realized. She was studying me.

When I drank coffee, I could feel her eyes on me. I’d look up and she’d immediately turn away, pretending to slice fruit, but her fingers trembled and the knife froze halfway to the board. I’d step outside for a smoke, and when I turned around, I’d see her peeking through the curtain then she’d instantly close it. When I showered, I’d catch her watching me, studying my body, then she’d run away. She started doing it even while I slept.

She almost stopped talking to me, instead writing something in a notebook and hiding it as soon as I entered the room. Photos began to disappear from their frames, she’d talk on the phone with someone, but hang up the moment I came in. I made an appointment with a psychologist for us, but she refused said she was afraid to be near me.

It all happened so suddenly… It seemed just yesterday we were stargazing in each other’s arms, and now this. The strangeness grew every day. Sometimes she asked me to sleep on the couch. I agreed, hoping it would calm her, but it was useless her paranoia only worsened. It got to the point where, when I tried to hug her, she screamed, “Don’t come near me!” and flinched as if I’d hit her.

After one of those nights, I decided I had to find out what was really going on. Even if it meant taking her to a doctor afterward.

I pretended to be asleep when she stood in the hallway, then she slowly approached soft, careful steps. She stopped at the foot of the bed, and for several seconds there was a dead silence, broken only by her uneven breathing. I could feel her watching. Not just watching comparing. That’s when I became truly terrified, a cold dread twisting inside me as my wife became something I couldn’t recognize.

Then the bed shifted slightly she sat down on the edge. The air grew heavy. I could feel her stare physically, like pressure on my skin. Then her cold fingers gently touched my wrist, held it for a few seconds, then quickly let go, as if burned, and whispered:

“Pulse faster than Tom’s.”

My heart clenched so hard I nearly twitched. She leaned closer. I could hear her breathing against my face short, shaky. She smelled of lavender and something sour that made goosebumps crawl down my back. Her lips barely moved.

“I remember clearly… Tom had a small scar right here…”

She touched my cheek.

“But you don’t.”

I clenched my teeth to keep from gasping. Those few seconds of silence lasted an eternity. What scar? I never had a scar on my cheek I’d know if I did! I wanted to sink into the ground and scream all at once, but I kept lying still until I heard a choked sob and her fading footsteps.

The door slammed. I opened my eyes, my heart pounding furiously. I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night too afraid to close my eyes.

In the morning, I went to work early, dreading the hours until my shift ended. That evening, over dinner, I said:

“Kate, we need to talk. What’s going on?”

She gripped her fork so tightly her knuckles turned white, then looked me dead in the eye.

“Tom, you… you’ve been acting strange.”

“What do you mean?”

“I don’t know. Sometimes you look different. Sometimes your voice sounds wrong. You even smell different.”

I didn’t know what to say. My head was chaos, and somehow I just laughed.

“Kate, maybe you’re just imagining things?”

“I don’t know, Tom.”

My eyes fell on the knife rack. There was a clean strip of dust where the largest kitchen knife should’ve been the one we used for everything, bread, meat, anything. I distinctly remembered it being there before that night. My heart slammed into my throat with a primal panic. I looked at Kate, and she was staring right at me, I wanted to speak, but couldn’t. It hit me then my wife might be planning to kill me.

The next morning she left for work, and I like a caged animal started searching the house. I hadn’t slept in nearly forty-eight hours. I know I should’ve just left, or taken her to a hospital… But she’s my wife. I love her. She has to see that I am me.

I tore through the apartment, frantic, desperate to find something anything that would help me understand what was happening to her. And I did.
After about an hour, in the back of the closet behind a pile of sweaters, I found her wooden box. Old, slightly cracked. The lid was ajar, and when I opened it, a thick notebook fell into my hands. It smelled of coffee and sweat. Her initials on the cover, written in her neat cursive. My heart froze as I realized it was the diary she’d been hiding from me.


The paper bent under my fingers. Her handwriting familiar, but this time jagged, shaky, the page stained with what looked like tears.

“He’s sleeping. I stand by the bed and watch. He looks like Tom, but he’s not. Tom had a scar on his left hand, from that accident by the river. This one’s skin is smooth. He smiles, but the smile doesn’t reach his eyes. Something replaced him… I keep counting days, marking steps… If the real Tom, my husband, is alive, where is he?”.

A wave of nausea rose in my throat. With each page, her handwriting grew more erratic:

“I tested his speech. He says ‘I love you’ in the same tone, but without warmth, not like before. Tom smelled of vanilla, but this one smells of dust and cheap cologne".

I couldn’t believe what I was reading. My knees trembled, the air around me tightened like a noose. I flipped to the last page.

“I can’t let this thing stay in our house. It wears his smile, his name. I tried talking to it, begging, but it just smiled and said all the right words. It didn’t defend itself. Maybe because it isn’t afraid? Its right hand twitches when it lies. I could have killed IT today, but for some reason I couldn’t… I know I have to. For Tom. I won’t let some monster wear his skin".

My hands were slick with sweat. My whole body was sweating, even though the room was cold. I placed the diary on the bed and sat down, trying to process everything I’d just read.

An accident? God, she was exaggerating. All that came out of it was a concussion and some bruised ribs. I stayed in the hospital for about… a week. Yeah. Seven days.

Then my phone rang, making me jump. It was Sheriff Martin, a kind old man I’d known for years.

“Tom, everything alright over there? Katherine called. Said someone’s living in your house pretending to be her husband.”

I froze.

“What did you say?”

“Says you’re not you. I’ve known her for yeara always seemed stable. Domestic quarrel, huh?”

“No. Just… stress. She’s tired.”

Evening came slowly.

I sat on the couch, elbows on my knees, looking at an old photograph the one that used to sit on our mantel before all this. Katherine and I by the lake, smiling, her arms around me, the sun so bright that day we had to squint.

I stared at us, at the little details: her blonde hair catching the light, her hand around mine, the green shimmer in our eyes. It felt like a lifetime ago.

When the door creaked open, I nearly jumped. My wife’s if I can still call her that steps were slow and tired, her bag thudding softly to the floor. She looked exhausted, her eyes red, her hair a mess. I stood, holding the diary.

“Kate… we need to talk.”

She looked at me warily, like a trapped animal sensing a snare.

“What’s that in your hand?” Her voice was even, but something trembled in it.

“I… I found this. I need to understand what’s happening,” I said, showing her the diary.

Katherine froze.

For a moment, I thought she’d break down crying but instead, she slowly stepped closer, looking straight into my face, her cold breath brushing against my skin.

“So what did you figure out, Tom? That I’m crazy? You think I’ve lost my mind, don’t you?”

“No. You wrote that I’ve been replaced. That I don’t have a scar.”

She turned away, her lips pressed tight.

“Tom had one. We even joked it made him look tougher.”

“Listen, sweetheart,” I took a step closer, a strange knot tightening in my gut, “I’m the same man. I remember everything, how we met, the candles at our wedding, how you laugh when we watch comedies, what you said about that stupid show when we finished it. I remember everything, Katherine. It’s me.”

She stared at me, unblinking, her shoulders trembling as if she were freezing. I looked into her eyes, and there was something there pain and horror mixed together, as if I stood before her as someone both familiar and wrong.

“You say it like you’ve rehearsed it,” she whispered.

“Because it’s true!” I stepped closer, my voice cracking into a shout. “What do I have to do for you to believe me? What?!”

Katherine said nothing. Just breathed heavily, like she was fighting herself, staring into my eyes. Then she suddenly backed away, step by step, toward her bag. I didn’t realize what was happening at first.

She bent down, as if for a handkerchief… and in the next moment, I saw the glint of metal. A knife. The missing one.

“Kate…” I breathed, disbelieving. “Katherine, put it down…”

“Stop. Stop pretending, you monster.”

I managed half a step toward her—she raised her hand. At first, I thought she was only threatening me. Panic tightened my fists, I wanted to yell, to grab her shoulders, to make her listen but then
A strike. Burning pain slashed through my chest, everything went white. The last thing I saw was her face so familiar, twisted by terror and despair at once. She stood over me, her hand trembling, her lips whispering something like:

“Tom… where are you, my love?”.

And then everything went dark.

I woke up in a hospital.

At first nothing but fog. Then the smell of antiseptic, the faint beep of a monitor, unfamiliar voices. I tried to move my head pain shot through my body.

The doctor explained I’d lost a lot of blood but somehow survived: the knife missed my heart by an inch. Katherine… Katherine had run away. I listened, not believing any of it was real.

A couple of days later, Martin came by. I told him everything about the knife, the diary, her thinking I wasn’t me. He listened, frowning, taking notes. When he finished and was about to leave, he turned back:

“Didn’t expect this from Katherine… Don’t worry, we’ll find her. When you’re discharged, come by my place I got some Cuban cigars from a friend, we’ll relax a bit".

Without thinking, I said:

“I don’t smoke".

He frowned, about to say something but then just nodded and left, closing the door behind him.
For several minutes I lay there, staring at the ceiling, trying to come to terms with everything that had happened. Then I noticed a small mirror in the corner of the room. I looked at my reflection and froze. My face was pale, my lips dry. But that wasn’t what caught my attention.

Interesting… Can eyes change color from green to blue?..
