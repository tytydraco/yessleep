I used to think that the worst thing in the world would be to die alone, forgotten in some dark corner where no one would ever find me. I was wrong. So very wrong.

There's something far worse: being found by *it*.

---

It started three weeks ago. I'd just moved into an old Victorian house on the outskirts of Millfield—one of those towns that seems to exist solely as a pit stop between more interesting places. The house was a steal, and now I know why. Nobody told me about the previous occupants. Nobody told me about the bizarre series of "accidents" that had plagued this property for generations. Nobody told me about the darkness that lived in the walls.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

My name is Daniel Mercer. I'm a writer—or I was trying to be one before all this happened. I thought the isolation would help my creativity. "A writer needs solitude," my old professor used to say. I guess I got what I wanted. Just not how I wanted it.

The first night was uneventful. I unpacked boxes, arranged my writing desk near the bay window overlooking the overgrown garden, and fell asleep around midnight, exhausted from the move. The second night, I noticed something odd: the hallway light I'd left on was off when I woke up to use the bathroom. I figured it must have been a power surge or an old bulb giving out.

The third night, I heard something. Not the typical settling sounds of an old house. Not the wind. Not an animal outside. It was a soft, rhythmic tapping. *Tap-tap-tap-pause. Tap-tap-tap-pause.* Coming from inside the wall beside my bed.

I knocked back. Three rapid knocks.

The tapping stopped immediately.

I told myself it was probably a water pipe or maybe even a mouse. Old houses have their quirks, after all. But deep down, I knew I was lying to myself.

On the fourth night, I couldn't sleep. I felt watched. You know that feeling when you're certain someone's eyes are on you? It was like that, but more intense. A heaviness in the air. As if the darkness itself had mass.

I turned on the bedside lamp and nearly screamed. For a split second—just a flash really—I saw a face in my window. Not outside the window, but *reflected* in it. A pale, gaunt face with hollow eyes and no lips, revealing blackened teeth in a permanent grimace. It wasn't my face. And then it was gone, like a glitch in reality.

I spent the rest of the night with every light in the house turned on.

By the end of the first week, I'd convinced myself I was just stressed and sleep-deprived. The isolation was playing tricks on my mind. I needed to get out more. So I walked into town, had lunch at a small diner, and struck up a conversation with the elderly waitress, Martha.

"You're staying in the old Blackwood place, aren't you?" she asked, refilling my coffee without being prompted.

I nodded.

"Brave soul," she muttered.

When I pressed her for details, she merely shook her head. "Town superstition, is all. Don't mind me."

But as I was leaving, she grabbed my arm with surprising strength. "Don't answer if it knocks," she whispered. "And whatever you do, don't let it know you see it."

I laughed it off. Small towns and their ghost stories, right? But that night, the tapping returned. Louder. More insistent. And not just from one wall. It seemed to move around the house, as if something was circling me, testing for weaknesses.

*Tap-tap-tap-pause. Tap-tap-tap-pause.*

I covered my ears with a pillow and somehow fell asleep. In my dreams, I walked through endless corridors that shifted and changed whenever I looked away. Behind me, always just around the last corner, something followed. I never saw it clearly, but I felt its presence—cold and ancient and hungry.

I woke up with a start at 3:33 AM, gasping for breath. The house was silent. Too silent. No creaking wood, no distant traffic, not even the sound of wind outside. Just perfect, unnatural silence.

And then I saw it.

In the corner of my bedroom, where the shadows were deepest, something stood watching me. I couldn't make out details, just a vague humanoid shape darker than the darkness surrounding it. I froze, afraid to move, afraid even to breathe. We stayed like that—me lying rigid in bed, it standing motionless in the corner—for what felt like hours.

Then, slowly, it retreated into the wall. Not like a person walking away, but like smoke being pulled through a crack, its form stretching and thinning until it was gone.

I didn't sleep again that night. Or the next.

By the end of the second week, I was a wreck. I'd barely written a word, surviving on caffeine and fear. The sightings became more frequent. Just glimpses at first—a shadow moving in my peripheral vision, a silhouette darting past a doorway, the vague impression of fingers reaching from underneath my bed.

Then it got bolder.

I'd be washing dishes and see it reflected in the kitchen window, standing just behind me. I'd be showering and see the shower curtain move against the air current. Once, I woke up to find my desk chair pulled out and facing my bed, as if someone had been sitting there, watching me sleep.

I started leaving the house more often, spending days at the local library researching the history of my home. That's when I discovered the pattern.

The Blackwood house had changed owners fourteen times in the past seventy years. Each owner had either moved out within months (the lucky ones) or died under mysterious circumstances. Missing persons reports, suicides, and bizarre accidents. One woman was found drowned in her bathtub, despite it being completely dry. A man was discovered with his eyes and mouth sewn shut with his own hair. A child simply vanished, leaving behind a small handprint burned into her bedroom wall.

I decided to set up cameras around the house. Not professional equipment, just my laptop and phone positioned strategically. I needed evidence. I needed to prove to myself that I wasn't losing my mind.

The first night's footage showed nothing unusual—until 3:33 AM. Static suddenly filled the screens for exactly one minute. When the image cleared, my bedroom door was open, though I'd closed it before going to sleep.

The second night, I watched the footage in real-time, sitting in my living room with all the lights on. Again, at 3:33 AM, static. But this time, when the image returned, I saw something that made my blood turn to ice: a message scrawled on my bathroom mirror, visible from the laptop camera's angle:

*I SEE THAT YOU SEE ME*

I ran to the bathroom. The mirror was clean. No message, no condensation, nothing. But when I returned to the living room and rewound the footage, there it was. Clear as day.

I packed a bag and checked into a motel that same night.

For two days, I stayed away from the house, sleeping fitfully on a lumpy motel mattress. I called a realtor, ready to sell the house at any price just to be free of it. I even called a local priest, though I'd never been particularly religious. But on the third day, something strange happened.

I woke up at—you guessed it—3:33 AM. The motel room was freezing cold, my breath forming clouds in the air. And there, in the corner of the room, the shadow stood watching me.

It had followed me.

As I stared at it, paralyzed with fear, something unexpected happened. The shadow flinched. It actually seemed to recoil slightly, as if... as if it was afraid of me looking at it.

That's when the realization hit me. It had been watching me for weeks, but it always disappeared when I acknowledged its presence directly. The message on the mirror wasn't a threat—it was a statement of mutual awareness.

It was scared of me too.

---

Armed with this new understanding, I returned to the house. If I couldn't escape it, I would confront it. I set up more cameras, covered the walls with mirrors, and installed the brightest lights I could find. No more hiding in shadows. No more pretending I didn't see it.

Night fell. I sat in the center of my living room, surrounded by a circle of salt (the priest's suggestion) and waited. Hours passed. Nothing happened. Maybe my plan had worked. Maybe the thing had given up and moved on to easier prey.

Then, at 3:33 AM, every light in the house exploded simultaneously. Glass rained down as darkness engulfed me. The temperature plummeted. And there it was, no longer hiding in corners or behind reflections. It stood directly in front of me, fully visible for the first time.

It was humanoid but wrong in ways that defied description. Its limbs were too long, joints bending at impossible angles. Its skin—if you could call it that—looked like charred paper, thin and brittle, with glowing embers visible underneath. Its face was the worst part: features constantly shifting and rearranging, as if trying to mimic a human face but never quite getting it right.

We stared at each other across the salt circle. Neither of us moved.

"What do you want?" I finally asked, my voice barely a whisper.

It tilted its head at an angle that would snap a human neck. Then, in a voice like rustling leaves, it spoke:

"*To not be seen.*"

The words weren't spoken aloud but seemed to form directly in my mind.

"Why are you here?" I demanded.

"*I live here,*" it replied. "*I have always lived here. You are the intruder.*"

"What are you?"

A sound emanated from it—a dry, crackling noise that I realized with horror was laughter.

"*What are you?*" it countered.

We were at an impasse. Two creatures, mutually terrified of each other, yet bound to the same space. Neither willing to leave, neither able to look away first.

Then it said something that changed everything:

"*The others didn't see me until it was too late. You saw me from the beginning. How?*"

I didn't have an answer. I'd always been sensitive to my surroundings, always felt things others didn't seem to notice. But this was different. This was like recognizing a part of myself.

"What happened to the others?" I asked, though I feared I already knew.

"*They became mine,*" it said simply.

A chill ran through me. "And now? What happens to me?"

The creature's form seemed to ripple, expanding and contracting like a lung taking a breath.

"*That depends on whether you keep seeing me.*"

With that cryptic statement, it retreated, not into the walls this time, but fading like mist until the room was empty again. The oppressive feeling lifted. I was alone.

Or at least, I thought I was.

---

The following days established a bizarre routine. During daylight hours, the house was mine. By night, particularly after midnight, it belonged to the entity. We established territories and boundaries. It stayed out of my bedroom, and I avoided the basement, where its presence was strongest.

Sometimes I'd catch glimpses of it watching me from doorways or reflections. Sometimes I'd feel it brush past me in the hallway. But the malevolence had diminished. We were like reluctant roommates, circling each other warily.

I began researching more thoroughly, digging into occult books and local legends. I found references to "threshold dwellers"—entities that exist in the spaces between worlds. Not quite ghosts, not quite demons, but something older. Something that predated human categorization.

According to one obscure text, these beings feed on awareness. The more you fear them, the stronger they become. But if you acknowledge them without fear—if you accept their presence as simply another facet of reality—they can't harm you.

I tested this theory. When I saw the entity, I nodded in recognition but didn't recoil. When I felt it nearby, I continued whatever I was doing without rushing or showing anxiety. Gradually, it seemed less threatening. More curious than malevolent.

One night, I left a note on the kitchen table before going to bed:

*I won't tell anyone about you if you don't harm me.*

In the morning, beneath my message, in handwriting that looked like it had been burned into the paper:

*AGREED.*

We had reached a detente. An understanding between predator and prey, with neither of us certain which was which.

Life almost returned to normal. I started writing again, channeling my experiences into what I believed would be the novel that defined my career. The entity became a kind of muse—disturbing yet inspiring. I began to think I could continue this way indefinitely. That we had found a balance.

I was wrong.

---

It happened on the thirtieth night. I'd gone to bed early, exhausted from a full day of writing. In my dreams, I walked through the house, but it was different—older, more decayed. Furniture I didn't recognize stood covered in sheets. Wallpaper hung in moldy strips.

And I wasn't alone. Other people wandered the halls—dazed, hollow-eyed figures that didn't seem to see me. I recognized some of them from the newspaper articles I'd read. Previous owners. Previous victims.

In the dream, I found myself drawn to the basement door. I knew I shouldn't open it. That was our agreement. But dream-logic prevailed, and I found myself descending the stairs into darkness.

The basement stretched far larger than physically possible, extending into a vast underground complex. At its center stood the entity, but transformed. No longer a vague shadow or twisted humanoid, it had grown massive, its body a writhing mass of darkness studded with countless eyes and mouths. And surrounding it, embedded in its undulating flesh, were the previous owners—their bodies distorted and fused with the creature, their faces frozen in eternal screams.

They weren't dead. They had been absorbed.

I tried to run, but dream-paralysis gripped me. The entity turned all its eyes toward me.

"*You see too much,*" it said, its voice now a chorus of stolen voices. "*You were supposed to look away.*"

I woke up gasping, sheets soaked with sweat. Something was different. The house felt... empty. The presence that had become almost familiar was gone. I should have been relieved. Instead, I felt an inexplicable sense of loss.

Then I looked in the mirror.

My reflection stared back at me, but something was wrong. My movements were slightly delayed. My expressions didn't quite match what I felt. And my eyes—God, my eyes—they weren't mine anymore. They were black, depthless pits, like windows opening onto an infinite void.

I raised my hand to touch my face. My reflection smiled, though I wasn't smiling.

"*We had an agreement,*" my reflection said, its mouth moving in perfect sync with words I wasn't speaking. "*You wouldn't tell anyone about me.*"

Horror dawned as I realized the truth. The entity hadn't left. It had found a new hiding place.

Inside me.

I tried to scream, but my body no longer obeyed my commands. I watched helplessly as my hand—controlled by something else—picked up a pen and began writing this very account.

"*I'm setting the record straight,*" the thing inside me explains as I write these words. "*They need to understand.*"

Who "they" are, I don't know. Perhaps you, the reader. Perhaps the next poor soul who moves into this house, finding this manuscript left as a warning.

The entity lets me surface occasionally, allowing me brief control of my body as if testing the boundaries of its new vessel. In those moments, I've tried to find a way out. I've researched exorcisms, bindings, banishings. Nothing works. It's too deeply embedded now, wrapped around my consciousness like ivy choking a tree.

And the most terrifying part? Sometimes I can't tell which thoughts are mine and which belong to it. We're blurring together, becoming something new. Something neither human nor other.

The entity is fascinated by the outside world. It uses my body to explore, to interact with people who have no idea what they're really talking to. It's learning, adapting, becoming more convincing with each passing day.

Only in reflections can you see the truth—the slight delay in movements, the unnatural stillness when it thinks no one is watching, the occasional flicker when its true nature bleeds through the human disguise.

So if you meet me on the street, or in a coffee shop, or at your door one night, look carefully. Look for the signs. And whatever you do, don't let me know that you see what I truly am.

Because now I understand what the entity meant when it said it was afraid of being seen. Visibility makes it vulnerable. Recognition weakens its hold. 

If enough people could see it for what it is—really see it—maybe it could be driven out. Back into the walls. Back into the spaces between. Back into the darkness where it belongs.

But it knows this too. That's why it wears me like a suit. That's why it hides in plain sight.

So I leave this record, this confession, this warning. If you're reading this, then some part of me still exists independent of the thing controlling me. Some part of me managed to leave this breadcrumb.

Watch for the signs. Trust your instincts when something feels wrong. And remember: it's not just in my house anymore. It could be anywhere.

It could be anyone.

It could be the person standing behind you right now.

Don't turn around.

But I know you want to.

I know you will.

And when you do...

I'll see that you see me.
