We were all a happy family of 4, me, my parents and my younger brother who was in final year of high school which he was very happy about, as he would finally escape that caged like place and my parents were already concerned what will be his future about which I couldn't care more. 

 It all started on an afternoon day, my brother suddenly fainted in middle of the kitchen, I and my mom immediately took him to bed where he lay like a corpse for some time, I was alone,beside his side thinking about what is wrong, could he have been infected with a virus or stress, when he suddenly woke up, eyes wide open and he spoke in a hoarse manner "They are coming, they are coming" he repeated that a few more times after which he feel asleep again, then first it was swelling of his hand, his temperature was really high. I immediately informed this to my mother who called my father. 

Now after half a hour we were in the car driven by my father on the way to hospital, I was on the front seat, frustrated with the traffic we were stuck in, suddenly I heard a thumping sound, it grew louder and louder making me go crazy but I think I only heard it as my parents weren't bothered by this loud sound I was hearing, gazing out of the window at the footpath, in middle of the street, I saw a woman, she was dressed in a Victorian way and wearing a hat, and her face when I saw it  my eyes became wide open, it was empty, no ears, no eyes it was like a mannequin. I was about to scream to my father to fucking step on the gas and get us out of here, but she disappeared, I just glanced at my father for just not even a second and she wasn't there. Who was She, a illusion, a monster, a ghost, or something else.

That incident happened hours ago now I was in a hospital room, doctor couldn't come to a conclusion of what illness my brother had been infected with, but they had told that he is in a coma like state. My mother was outside of the room talking with the doctor and I was sitting beside my brother who was in his own world. I had pushed that incident to the back of my mind and only thinking about my dear brother. When it happened, I heard a really loud thumping sound which overwhelmed my mind, and at same time out of my edge of vision I saw it a tall figure, likely 7 feet, wearing a discolored old, long trench coat and a hat and with a black umbrella even though it wasn't raining, but that was least of my concerns it was standing outside of the window, standing casually in air when I jerked my head towards that spot it had disappeared. 

From then onwards I seemed to be suffering from a mental disease I think, everything seems unusual, shadows seem to be deeper than usual, rooms bigger than they are, and some fast movements in darkness. It had been 5 days since my brother is in hospital I was alone in my home as both father and mother were at the hospital. The weather was cloudy and raining lightly, I was sitting on my bed when it happened again that same thumping sound it got louder and louder, much louder than before. I felt some fluid coming out of my ears, I touched my ears with my finger and when I brought them in front of my eyes they were red, blood was coming out of my ears.

Suddenly my phone rang and with it the thumping sound disappeared, I picked up the phone, I heard the sobs of my father, my heart skipped a beat, he told me that my brother had passed away, at that time it felt like the whole world came crashing down on me, then I felt a sensation and with phone glued to my ears I glanced out of the sliding window doors of my room into the garden, where they were standing the same women the same man, they opened their mouth even though they had none and a screeching sound which was the worst sound I had ever heard escaped out of their mouth, I felt like my heart was slowing down, like I was dying I fell crashing my head onto the wooden floor, I lay on the floor for atleast 20 to 30 minute according to me,after which I woke up, my whole body was dizzy I saw the blood flowing out of my head onto the floor, but something was wrong the blood, it was flowing in a weird manner but then I understood it was forming a sentence out of blood which seemed to be 
"THE OUTER WORLD AWAITS LIKE IT ONCE AWAITED YOUR BROTHER" 

I was too horrified to understand it then, but now as I am writing this, I am thinking what did they mean by that, what was that outer world, why they await me, did my brother knew about this outerworld, my mind overflowing with questions. I heard it again that thumping sound and this time I immediately jerked my head out into the garden there he was standing, my younger brother in same hospital dress, I don't know if I should feel horrified or shocked, he stretched out his left hand to me, I understood it he was inviting me. As I am writing this last words, I don't know if I have became mad, I am going to join my brother, I want to see, I want to know the unknown. I am stepping out, he is standing, I am going to join him.
May god forb----
