I received a series of fax messages listed below. Reading them I don't think I should get rid of them, or notify the sender that they got the wrong person.

My name is Joe Evans
I am a student at "Morisvile Early Collage Campus"
I recently received a series of fax messages which I have re-typed below. I need guidance on whether I should send it back to the original sender or not.

In the unlikely event that you happen to hear an unfamiliar noise that captures your attention, we kindly request that you approach the situation with immediate caution. We suggest thoroughly investigating your basement or seeking assistance from a neighbor within your apartment building. Additionally, seeking guidance from a knowledgeable individual and maintaining a calm and tranquil environment might prove to be beneficial.

We kindly request that you remain composed and refrain from unnecessary displays of alarm as we have established protocols in place to ensure your safety. If feasible, identify any available objects that may serve as temporary tools and patiently await the arrival of the Federal Bureau of Universal Knowledge (F.B.U.K.) authorities, who will promptly locate you and initiate a secure evacuation procedure. Find solace in a secure area, such as below furniture or inside closets, and conceal yourself until the evacuation is successfully completed.

In the highly improbable occurrence that you encounter a Soul Eater (vanator magicae), it is of utmost importance to expeditiously flee in the opposite direction. Under no circumstances should you engage in combat with a Soul Eater. If unfortunately cornered by such a creature, assume a protective position and make a large amount to alert other individuals of the presence of the Soul Eater.

We sincerely appreciate your valuable time and attention.

Warm regards,

Tommy Steelslate

If you feel like, under any circumstances, you are being followed home, evacuate the area immediately. Feelings of being followed or stalked might be signs of a 6050/8 scenario. In the case that you have feelings of dread, locate a possible weapon or protective armor and attempt to evacuate the immediate area. 

In the situation that you hear an unfamiliar noise in your home during such a situation, run and hide. Do not try to fight with any possible threats  during a 6050/8 scenario. Attempt to find a safe place to hide, and do not exit unless F.B.U.K. operatives arrive.


Hide in a bunker issued by the F.B.U.K., and wait. If you do not have a bunker, it may be too late for you. The amount of time that you should stay in the bunker depends on the degree of 6050/8 that has entered your home.

Do not exit your bunker if you feel you are being watched, stalked, or that something is waiting outside for you. Trust your gut, if you think something is trying to starve you out, don’t go outside. If you think that something is trying to break in, ready a potential weapon. Do not try to kill the creature, instead use any weapons to disorient the creature as you escape. 


Do not try to exit the bunker, your home is their home now. Running from your bunker should be  a last resort only. Your bunker is a line of defense. 

Attempt to stay away from electronics, with the exception of a fax machine, as these can be used to gauge your position, location, and status. It is imperative to your survival that this info is not presented to the 6050/8.



Sincerely
Tommy Steelslate

If a recruit is concerned about the risks of their current position, please inform director Lux at once. Interviews are allowed to resolve any conflict or unrest among employees, and the same opportunity will be extended to recruits. Under no circumstances should an employee try to organize or establish a union. All employees on strike will be blanked or killed (as well as any known relatives of the strikers), and any mention of a union will be reported to HR.

In the past, multiple illegitimate fax messages have been sent to employees by former director Tommy Steelslate. Any papers sent by Tommy or his associates will be reported and burned. Under no circumstances should one read these messages. If one is caught reading said messages, they will be subject to an immediate blanking.

Any fax messages signed with the names Iccarus/red herring, Tommy Steelslate, or Deadmind will be incinerated at once.

If one is found trying to communicate with anyone designated as a P.O.A.C. they will be subject to termination. If one is found to have DNA or lineage similar to a P.O.A.C. or a P.O.A.O. they will be terminated. If one is found carrying a weapon designated as a O.O.A.P., they will be terminated. If one is found with connection to any P.O.A.C. or P.O.A.O., they will be killed via the process of atomization. 











Thank you for your time,

Warning: This should only be sent to fax machines inside of bunkers. If this is sent to a machine outside of an F.B.U.K. designated bunker, stop reading at once and incinerate this paper.

If you are trapped in your bunker after a 6050/8 scenario, Attempt to follow the protocol discussed in the following text:


Watch any potential entrances to your bunker such as your ventilation system, which you have manual control of, your door, or your piping system. Inside the bunker, you will have access to all of these systems via a smart system device.

Ration your supplies. Help may take a long amount of time to arrive. Your bunker is pre-packed with food, water, a salt lick, and a fully loaded gun. These supplies will only last for so long though.

Awareness is key to surviving this scenario. If you sense something moving, there is a good chance that you should run. If you think that there is more than one thing hunting you, there probably is.

Trust your instincts. If you think a thought is irrational, it’s not. No thoughts are irrational. The only thought that is irrational is the thought that the fear you are feeling is irrational. If you feel like it’s crawling through the vent, it is. If you feel like it is trying to starve you out, it is. If you feel like it’s mimicking the voice of F.B.U.K. operatives to lure you out, it is.
