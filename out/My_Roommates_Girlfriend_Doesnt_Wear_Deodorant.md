I live with my best friend and his girlfriend. The living situation is as ideal as it could be for someone that’s single with no kids. Only a cat and myself to take care of.

My best friend works at the only grocery store in town and his girlfriend is unemployed. There were times she’d help take care of my cat by feeding her or playing with her when I wasn’t home. It could be counting as employment if you count soda and snacks as currency. 

Everyday around 3pm she wakes up, grabs an energy drink from the fridge, and heads into the other spare bedroom she set up as a gaming room. Most evenings are filled with her playing games in VR or on her computer.

She rarely leaves the ‘gaming room’. The only time her boyfriend or myself see her is when she comes into the kitchen to grab snacks then it’s right back to the room. Sometimes she wouldn’t even go to the bed to sleep. She’d sleep in the gaming room.

When I first moved in I started to notice a nauseating smell coming from her. She always smelled like she never wore deodorant. The smell clung to her and to the room like a gasoline scented candle.

Her boyfriend and I tried our hardest to get her to put on deodorant but her response was always “I’m sorry. I keep forgetting.” Don’t get me wrong, she showers but showers only hold off the stench for about an hour then it comes back. She once made the excuse of sweating it off too fast but it’s hard to believe at times. 

One night my best friend and I heard her do her usual rounds of gaming in VR. Jumping, constant stomping, and laughing. None of which bothered either one of us. But every now and then we’d catch a whiff of her usual scent coming from under the door. 

After a couple hours the sounds of her gaming stopped. It was normal for her to stay in VR for a few hours then sit down to watch a movie on her computer. Maybe even pass out in her gaming chair or on the spare mattress. 

The next morning I saw my friend making breakfast and asked if his girlfriend went to bed with him last night. Not to my surprise he said she hadn’t. Nothing out of the ordinary. 

The whole day passed and neither of us had seen her come out for snacks, use the bathroom, or even say hello. We both figured she woke up later than she wanted and went straight to gaming. Maybe she had snacks in the room from last night or left over soda. No matter the situation, we knew she was awake because we heard music and sounds of her eating. 

Over the next couple days my friend and I grew curious as well as concerned. Between not seeing her and the smell somehow growing increasingly worse, we had to check on her. 

Her boyfriend knocked on the door. No answer. Called her name. No answer. The only thing we heard was what sounded like a closeup recording of someone eating chicken wings. I came up behind him and gagged. The smell had become unbearable even though it came from under the door.  

Once we opened the door, my friend sprinted out of the room. He tripped over my cat, fell to his knees, and vomited in the carpeted hallway. I opened the door more to see his girlfriend laying on the floor. 

Her mouth half open. Her VR headset was still on her head with music playing from it. Her neck looked like someone snapped it over their knee. The bone wasn’t protruding through the skin but you could every bony detail bulging under her skin.  

I could hear my best friend continuing to puke with mixed in cries of agony. I slowly peeled off the headset to reveal milky white eyes. The entire time I had to hold my breath because not only did her usual smell permeate the room but so did the miasma of the dead. 

Before I left the room I had planned to cover her with a blanket to conceal any more details of her death from her boyfriend. When I found a blanket I noticed a deep red, bloodied mark on her arm. It looked like someone or something was scraping the skin to attempt to reach the bone. To my horror, I realized what that eating noise was.

I covered her with the blanket and saw my friend holding my cat. My cat was licking her lips the way that cats do after they eat wet food. That’s when my best friend came to the same realization I did about how she died and what the eating noise was.
