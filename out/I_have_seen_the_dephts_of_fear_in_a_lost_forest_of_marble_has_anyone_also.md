In the olden streets of Brazil there are many rundown houses, some abandoned, some just left to rot by the owners while their busy day to day life leaves them no time to take care of home – the only sign of residence being dim lights inside, or the eventual rabid barking dog in the yard. On my street there was this once luxurious house – we would even call it a mansion, given the size and the detailed architecture that could still be seen between rubble and growing, overtaking foliage. The lights where always dimly on, the gates and windows always closed, ever slightly so.

The ominous title may see hyperbolic, but I have ventured deep into the depths of fear once when urban exploring there. I had an adrenaline addiction when i was a child, and have always been fascinated with urban exploration. This was amongst the first few times, and was the last, I ever partook in the activity myself. I had dived into a realm of no man’s making. Adulthood and law school made me a dull man, so I post this also as a hallmark of my own adventures.

The kids would always make up ghost stories about the place. There was a huge yard that seemed to spam endlessly to besides and to the back of the house, never ending in what you could see. The tall grass that sprawled about the ground and big, thick foliaged trees that grew created a pseudo forest full of rubble, tales of monsters, killers and aberrations. Very few ever tried going into the terrain of that house, although everyone in our friend group was dared to do so – mostly by me. The lights that gave the impression of someone being inside, and the loud barking of a large dog that started shortly after anyone set foot inside the yard – in the rare occasions anyone dared so – where enough to discourage venturing further, no matter the ever-looming allure of the place.

One lightly rainy day during summer vacation, I must have been 12 years old or so, I was the only one among my friends to have been left on the street – as everyone was out enjoying the beach, and my family decided to stay for the holidays. Feeling bored and ever so brave, young lonesome me decided to jump the fence and go further than the tall grass of the front yard this time. I was armed with a kitchen knife I snuck out with, and a flashlight – because every good urban explorer absolutely needs a flashlight!

When I set foot in the yard, I heard the loud barking of always. This time, I decided to stay my ground, we never saw the dog, so it must be leashed somewhere it could not get to me. After a short time, the barking stopped. I set forward, the house seeming bigger than ever before, standing tall as a skyscraper above my head, and the trees facing me with the daring intent to swallow me in their leaves. The front door would not be a smart idea, as there could be someone inside, and it seemed sturdy enough I wouldn’t be able to open it by myself anyways.

I took a deep breath and walked into the dark foliage, tiptoeing over rubble, bricks and concrete, leaves, and tree roots, rustling through the branches until I fell into a clearing. I didn’t exactly fall, it felt like I was pushed, but between the low vision ahead of me and the unstable ground, I couldn’t be sure.

The place was hauntingly stunning. The backyard of the house seemed to go on for miles. The place was littered with sculptures that formed a sculpted marble forest of their own, big bronze statues of Chinese dragons, buddhas big and small, tall and weathered arches that one would think made up a larger building a long time ago sprawled all over the place, however with no cohesion or seeming purpose to their placement. There were many frowning demon faces that one would sometimes see in front of homes to ward off evil spirits, Umbanda symbolism strewn about the ground with crosses and dream catchers hanging from jotting gargoyle fingers. 

Hindu architecture, from what it seemed, awkwardly mixed with the shapes of traditional Portuguese or perhaps Italian buildings of the country’s founding. On one side of the yard, quite far away, there seemed to be a ruined modern looking construction, cross cut to reveal an interior filled with greenery. So many ornaments laying everywhere, from several cultures, a cacophony of styles.

I was mesmerized by the place, the dark and gloomy afternoon sky seemed to open with rays of light that shone shyly on the more intricate and larger pieces of whatever was ahead of me. I then heard a loud, sharp scream. A howl, maybe, a shriek. A gurgle. I ran instinctively, in between the large ornaments, inside the arches, until I saw what seemed like a shed, what would be one if not for the immense pagoda tower that reached to heights I dared not fully inspect in my fearful run.

I went in and shut the door. Gasping for air, I then froze thinking of what I gotten myself into. I remembered the knife and pulled it out of my pocket. Whatever was running after me had stopped. Did anything come running after me? Silence. Every sound suddenly stopped, I could not hear my own breathing, as loud as it was before. The clicking of teeth broke the dead silence, the hushed moaned breathing of something big. I looked at the window beside me, the decapitated head of a large bull stood there, clicking and clacking its teeth, maddened eyes rolling about in their sockets, staring at me, at the walls, at nothing, and at me.

I ran out the door, at the place where the sculptures outside stood, there flashed imagery of a dark bog, white, bloated bodies everywhere. Dead people halfway buried into the ground, sunken into the water, eyes still blinking and mouths moving. The scenery then reverted into the lush garden of everything where I once was, and I sprinted back to front of the house. I heard the galloping of a huge thing, and a gurgling bellow. I felt scared, but the feeling came and went, wonder and fascination intertwined and alternated between happiness and sadness. I stopped for a moment, apathy overtook me, and faced back.

A headless human slithered towards me, when it came so close I could feel our atoms intermingle, I saw a crazed round eye in a pitch-black void stare me down. I stabbed it with my knife and kept on running, I felt nothing – emotionally or physically – as I plowed through the leaves, branches and rubble that before felt so heavy and impeding to walk in. I heard the whimper of a dog as I jumped the wire fence to the outside, hitting my face on the concrete because of my hasty dive.

I woke up in my bed, my parents where not home yet, still in the supermarket buying groceries I presumed. The darkness of the twilight was setting in, leaving my home in a dimly lit gloom, the light posts outside churning an orange glow onto the bedside. It all felt like a dream, and I would take it as such where it not for the dirt in my clothes and the cuts in my arms left by my adventure in the forest of leaves and concrete. My flashlight was left in the door to my room, the light on, facing me. The battery seemed to die as it wanned off.

Ever since that day, I had grown a huge admiration for urban explorers, as the city keeps it’s memories of olden times and deep deeds buried in it’s entrails, anomalies lie in the wake of wonder, and perhaps my experience isn’t so unique, as many more abandoned marbled forests lay in towns and cities worldwide. 

To this day i every so often have dreams of a bull's head gnashing teeth from across a hallway, or an arched stairway littered with buddahs and bones reaching to a blackened bog in impossible geometry above me. Remnants of trauma, or maybe a specter of that place haunting me. I posted this story to perhaps know if anyone has delved in places like this, and maybe share their story here. Has anyone?
