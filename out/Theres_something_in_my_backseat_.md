I thought missing my dad’s funeral was the worst case scenario. I was wrong.

Long drives have a hypnotic effect on you, the passing broken white lines like a swaying pocket watch from some shady hypnotist telling you to sleep. 

Not to mention with the thoughts of your fathers body mangled in a hospital bed flashing in and out of your mind it’s safe to say the 15 hour drive from Stony Rapids to Regina felt like years.

On my first day driving; around 8pm, I had been on the road for 7 straight hours only stopping once to pee and fill up on gas and snacks. I honestly was not in a good state to drive. Almost no sleep and intermittent periods of intense pain and anxiety that the flat Saskatchewan landscape turned into green oil paintings through my welling tears.

Safe to say when I thought I heard a whisper over the radio I brushed it off immediately as just me hearing things through my delirium. 

Just 30 kilometres from my hotel I heard it again, this time I could almost make out a single word. 

“Fault” 

I quickly look around me, going 110 I do my best to look behind me and all over the car the best I can without swerving into a ditch. 

Once again I chock it up to my exhausted mind playing tricks on me while in the isolation of my car on a dead road near the middle of the night. But I decided to drive the rest of the way in without any radio just in case. 

Just 2 kilometres outside of the town of La Ronge where I booked my hotel I heard it again. 

“It’s not your fault” I heard in a whisper so quiet that even without the radio I almost missed it. 

I immediately jerked my head to my back seat and through the darkness I swear I saw something just fall behind my back seats and into my trunk. I could not make out any sort of figure but the worst part was the noise, the sound I heard when it jumped in the back was like the scurry of a thousand rats, as if whatever this thing was had hundreds of legs on all sides of its body moving in unison to stay out of my sight. 

 I immediately pulled over and got out. The cold wind of the night shocking my system as I disrupted my warm hideaway provided by the cars heater. 

Call me crazy, call me a pussy I don't care. I’m exhausted and mentally shot so if I’m not just imagining things I want absolutely nothing to do with whatever the hell that was. 

I’m only a couple kilometres away from my hotel. I'll just walk, go get some rest and come back to my car when I have a clearer head in the morning. So I quickly grab all my valuables out of the front seats, lock the doors, and write down the location of my car and start walking. 

I get about half a kilometre down the road when I look back and my car is the same distance behind me as it was when I left. Not like I am in the same spot I did move up the road but it’s like my car was tied to me with some imaginary string keeping it at the same distance. 

The engine was not on, I had the keys in my pocket, the doors were locked. 

It’s strange what your mind remembers in moments of terror. I remember looking both ways down the road, as if to confirm I wasn’t the only one seeing this. I was.

This isn’t my imagination playing tricks on me anymore, this isn’t explainable. No one else is on the road at this time and I am all alone with a possessed chevy equinox. 

I stood there for what might have been minutes just looking at my vehicle, not moving, not started, just sitting there staring back at me waiting to start walking like a dog looking at its owner before going on a walk. 

 Finally I see headlights in the distance heading towards me. I’m snapped back into reality and without conscious thought I put my hands up to try and wave down the passing truck. 

Not surprisingly a guy flailing his arms around at you on the highway at 1 in the morning isn’t exactly a situation most people would feel hospitable in. He just drove by. 

That didn’t overly shock me but what made my bones tense in fear was what I saw in my car as he drove past. In my back seat the headlights flashed the silhouette of a massive black mass of fleshy tendrales sloshing around like a puddle of sentient intestines.

After about 10 seconds of paralysing fear. Bugs buzzing past my face, with the light passing truck still imprinting hot white dots in my eyes. I did the only thing my mind could think of, I ran. 

Never looking back, that thing could have my car. I don't care anymore, I ran and ran and ran until finally I got to the hotel. 

Running past several other cars in the parking lot over to the check in desk on the far southern side of the parking lot with the hotel to the north. Only illuminated by the 3 street lights above the parking lot and the spattered lights of occupied hotel rooms. 

The sight of the lights in the checkout office gave me a feeling of relief sailers must feel after seeing the shine of a lighthouse after clearing a severe storm. 

I ran up the check in office and bursting through the front door nearly giving the clerk at the front desk a heart attack. 

The clerk was a 20 something kid with long blonde hair with headphones in and a Dead Kennedys t-shirt on. 

“You good bro?” He said taking out one of his airpods. 

“Check in for McNeil” I said through my heavy breathing, slamming my ID on the desk. 

“Umm okay” the clerk responded, looking around as if he wasn’t sure I was just some hallucination from the drugs he was obviously on. 

“Room 4E, just up the stairs to the north and down the hall.” he said after an agonizing 20 seconds of him looking at the computer and before handing me the keys. 

I grab the keys and as I turn around and walk out to the stairs outside I look out at the parking lot and see a white chevy just sitting directly in the middle of the parking lot. There were a few other cars in the parking lot, I only saw it from the side so I wasn’t certain it was mine. 

I was exhausted, I could barely see straight, I had just ran for 20 minutes straight and I had experienced something I couldn’t even explain with a clear mind. I had no plan but for whatever reason I began to walk towards the car to check the license plate and confirm it was mine. 

It was. 

I walked up towards the side of the vehicle and as I made my way to the back I saw the whole thing shift side to side, as if whatever this thing was staring at me, following me completely by rotating its entire body to face me. 

I could see its jet black slimy tendrils illuminated by the street light further down the parking lot, slinking forever forward as if it had no end. Its disgusting form faces me like an unholy abomination that defies all logic, looking at me destroying my concept of biology and reality just by existing. 

My mind became a blur, everything that had happened to me over the last few days hit me all at once like a runaway train. I was overcome with emotions and my knees buckled. 

I was now on my knees in the middle of the parking lot, that thing looking over me as if I was bowing to its command. Just then I was startled out of my trance by the front desk clerk suddenly appearing in front of me, giving me a look of concern with his headphones in his hand though I could still hear the heavy metal instrumentals blaring through them. 

It seems my existential crisis in the parking lot looked like something he should probably deal with from his desk window. 

“Hey man, umm… do you need me to call someone for you?” He said sincerely. 

I looked up at him and somehow felt a moment of comfort, this kid seemed genuinely concerned for me. Maybe he’ll understand, maybe if I explain to him what is happening we can figure a way out of this situation together. 

Just as I had this thought and opened my mouth to speak I noticed the door to my trunk behind him open slightly. 

“LOOK OU…” before I could even finish the 2 words the creature in my back seat had slipped one of its hellish tendtals out of the back and slit the clerks throat from ear to ear before slowly slipping back into the trunk of my car, using it as some sort of protective shell.

I’ll never forget the face he made, the look of concern was replaced with shock and terror in the blink of an eye. 

Blood spurting out of his now open carotid artery with the rhythm of his slowly dying heartbeat. I just sat there on my knees, the brief second of hope I had dying as quickly as he did. 

As the kid fell to the floor, blood pooling like a lake, I still sat their motionless, some desperate part of me wanted this to still be a dream or some fucked up hallucination brought on by grief-induced exhaustion. 

As much as I tried to wake up or confirm to myself this wasn’t reality, the kid's lifeless body still lay in front of me growing whiter and whiter with every passing second.  

Just as my reality was once again collapsing, my driver's side door opened. 

“They are gonna blame you for this ya know.” A high pitched voice whispered in my ear as if right behind me. 

“No they won’t, YOU DID THIS! NOT ME!” I shouted back 

As a result of my shouting several of the occupants of the hotel rooms around me turned on their lights, some looking through the drapes at the commotion. 

“You think they’ll believe you?” it responded seemingly genuinely curious of my response. 

I didn’t say anything, they wouldn’t believe me. I looked around the parking lot. There were no cameras, several people watching now, all the police would see is a man going through mental anguish and a kid with his throat slit in the middle of nowhere. 

“Just drive to the police station, I’ll be in the back seat, you can show them first hand you're not crazy and you didn’t do this” it whispered. 

I was now rocking back and forth in complete hysteria. I don’t know if I was mentally shot or I had subconsciously completely given up at this point, but I began to consider it. 

Realistically it was right, what options did I have, either I could get in the car and probably be killed or I could go to the police alone and try to explain myself and be disowned from my family and locked away in a mental institution or prison for the rest of my life. 

No matter what my life was over, I couldn’t live with the guilt that I had inadvertently led this kid to a gruesome death. I had to tell someone I couldn’t live this way, either I come clean or I die and both options seemed equally dreadful. 

So against all of my body screaming at me to stop I got in my car. I almost felt a fraction of second of comfort as I remembered the warm on my heater still trapped inside. 

Once I sat down and closed the door I felt a sort of stomach dropping regret I can’t even describe to this day. 

“It’s not your fault” it whispered. 

“I know it’s not, you killed him, you killed me” I responded in a low aggressive but broken tone. 

“Let’s go talk to the police, let's figure this whole mess out” It said after some silence. 

I pulled out of the parking lot and headed to the police station on the other side of the town a short 5 minute drive away. 

“You’re special you know, he gave me you, of all people he could have chosen he chose you!” it said just a minute into the longest drive of my life. 

I didn’t want to respond, whatever the hell was happening was something beyond my understanding. But eventually I realised if I was going down I might as well know why. 

“Who?” I responded. 

“Your father,” it whispered. 

I slammed on the breaks, and looked in the rear view mirror. Just in the moment it occurred to me how large this thing was, it tensed in fear like a child about to be scolded by their parents. Even in its tense state it still took up the entirety of the back of my car, I couldn't see a sliver of my rearview window. Just the sight of it made my stomach turn in with dread. 

“DON’T YOU EVER TALK ABOUT MY FATHER HE WOULD NEVER LET YOU DO THIS TO ME YOU SON OF A BITCH!” I screamed through my tears that seemingly had no end. 

“Oh I’m sorry, your father did want to protect you, on his deathbed after the accident he prayed for your protection. I just think he didn’t realize who he was praying to.” It responded.  

I slumped in my chair, what was left of my sanity was now gone. I looked out my drivers side window and into the inky black void that was my surroundings. Only light coming from my headlights and the street light a kilometre down the road. 

Without another word I shifted the car back into gear and started driving again. 

“I think you’ll learn to appreciate me after a while, it was your dads wish for me to look over you after all.” it continued, whispering and whispering never shutting the fuck up until I would completely collapse and fall apart at the seems. 

I turned onto the road the police station was on, a long road with a dense forest on my right  with thick spruce trees all along the road. Nearing the end of the road close to the station I noticed an extremely thick tree at the end of the road. 

If this thing was right and I’m destined to be watched over by this thing from some sick bastardization of my fathers final wishes then I wasn’t giving it the satisfaction of having me for long. 

My foot slowly pushes the gas pedal, as my car gets faster and faster I unbuckle my seat belt. 

I wanted to make a prayer for my family in these brief seconds but I didn’t know what could be listening so I simply let the trees rush pass as I reached 120 km/hr. 

As I was just 300 or so feet away from my fate, it spoke one last time. 

“It’s not your fau….”
