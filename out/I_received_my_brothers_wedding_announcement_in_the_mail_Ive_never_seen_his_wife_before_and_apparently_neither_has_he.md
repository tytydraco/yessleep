I almost missed it altogether, buried as it was under all the junk mail and "preapproved" credit card offers. The announcement was printed on a 7" x 5" piece of white cardstock. The right side featured a photo of a couple while the left bore a simple message in a plain font: 



*Just Married. David and Emma. June 6th. Acadia.* 



I read that strangely unceremonious message twice as I stood in front of my mailbox, trying to recall how I knew the couple. The only David I knew was my brother, who was not only single, but perhaps the *most* single man I've ever known. I looked over to the photo of the happy couple, and I'm not being hyperbolic when I say that my jaw dropped. 



The man in the picture was in fact my younger brother. He was strolling down the beach, hand in hand with a young woman, both of them caught mid-laugh. He gazed adoringly at the woman—at "Emma", I guess—who was covering the top half of her face with her free hand. I thought it was strange that she'd be obscuring her own eyes in a wedding announcement photo, but the card itself was so strange that I didn't dwell on her pose. The announcement was either a prank (which would have been remarkably out of character for my humorless sibling), or David had subverted my every expectation and eloped. 



Once I got past the initial shock of the card, I went back inside, tossed the junk mail, and gave David a call. It was evening where he was, but not so late that he would've been asleep. He picked up after six rings. 



"Well mazel-fucking-tov!" I told him, squinting down at the woman's face. 



"Huh?" 



"Who's the lucky gal?" 



He paused, clearly trying to puzzle out my question, then: "What the hell are you talking about, man?" 



Ok, so it was a prank. If he had secretly gotten married and wanted to hide it from his family, then he wouldn't have mailed me an announcement. From the confusion in his voice, I figured he wasn't in on the joke. It sounded like one of his friends pulled one over on him. I explained the situation, then sent him a photo of the card. 



Instead of laughing it off like I expected, David got so quiet I thought the call had dropped. He eventually said he had no idea who "Emma" was, nor who had sent me the card. Sure, some of his friends were pranksters, but how would any of them have gotten my address without David's knowledge? He said he'd ask his friends about it, and requested that I see who else had received the wedding announcements. Up until that point, I'd still thought of the card as a harmless joke, but the severity of David's reaction put me on edge. Maybe there actually was some woman in his life that, for whatever reason, he didn't want people knowing about. 



After the call, I texted my parents and a few of our family friends. One of my old neighbors had indeed received a card, and seemed a little disappointed when I revealed it was only a prank. My parents checked their mailbox upon my request, and only then did they find the announcement. (Thank *god* I called before they could discover it on their own. I genuinely think my mom would've had a heart attack.) So far, those are the only two households that have received the cards, and I found it bizarre that David's friends knew either of those addresses.  



Before I fell asleep, I texted David my update. He said that he hadn't yet found the culprit and planned to continue his search in the morning. Again, I was somewhat perturbed by his seriousness. Was I missing something? I spent the next few hours trying to figure out who his "bride" could have been. In doing so, I quickly started to feel like every other woman on Earth was named "Emma." There were so many significant women in mine and David's lives who bore that name that sorting through them all seemed pointless. 



There was, for example, our childhood friend and neighbor, who David harbored an unrequited crush on for years until her family moved away. There had been a tragic incident at our high school in which an Emma in David's year fell head-first behind some lockers, dying from positional asphyxia. I had dragged David along to a rager at an Emma's house in college, which had ended in both of us spending a night in jail for public intoxication. Apparently, my life was just one big stream of Emmas, and none of them seemed plausibly linked to the marriage announcements. 



Now, here's the part of all this that I'm still struggling to make sense of. The night after I called David about the card, I woke up in the middle of the night to my phone ringing. I checked the caller ID and saw that it was David. I assumed he was calling me about the stupid prank, and part of me wanted to ignore him until the morning. Then again, he could've been having some kind of emergency, so I picked up the phone and grumbled "what?" into the mic. There was silence for a few seconds, and then I was shocked to hear a woman's voice on the other end. 



"Hello." Said the voice, quiet and slow and unmistakably feminine. I sat up in bed. 



"What? David? Who is this?" I double-checked the screen and confirmed it was in fact David's number. 



Another long pause, and then: 



"Yes. This is David's apartment."



After that, the caller hung up. Disturbed, I called David back immediately, but no one picked up. I sent him a text asking who had just called, then called him three more times. No one picked up, and I was starting to panic. Yeah, yeah—I know the most likely explanation was that he simply had a woman over, but something didn't feel right. I guess David's paranoia was rubbing off on me because I was so weirded out that I actually phoned David's buddy Mike, who lived in his same apartment building, and made him do a wellness check for me. 



When Mike got to the apartment, my brother was asleep inside, perfectly safe and sound. He didn't have anyone over, and there were no signs that anyone had broken into his apartment or messed with his phone. And yet, I hadn't imagined the call, at least not entirely; according to the phone logs, there had definitely been an outbound call from David's phone to mine. He had no memory of calling, and even if David had a history of sleep talking (which he doesn't) the voice certainly didn't sound like a man impersonating a woman. 



I'm at a complete loss. I tried giving the card a more thorough look this morning, trying to see if I'd glossed over some clue. The longer I stared at the woman in the photo, the more creeped out I got. Why was she covering her eyes? If someone had gone through the trouble of creating fake couple photos, why not give "Emma" a more natural pose? Frankly, I could only look at the marriage announcement for a few seconds at a time before I had to put it down.



Maybe that's why it took me so long to realize that the woman's mouth had been flipped upside down.
