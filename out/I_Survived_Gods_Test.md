I sat in the dim light of my apartment, staring blankly at the mess around me. Dishes piled high, clothes I hadn't bothered to pick up in weeks, and newspapers cluttered the floor like a layer of dust on my past. Everything about this place felt dead, as lifeless as I felt inside. It's been ten years since my parents died, but some days, it feels like it was just yesterday. Other days, like tonight, it feels like they've been gone forever. I stopped believing in anything after they passed. Faith, hope, God—none of it meant anything to me anymore.

But old habits die hard. I found myself sitting on the edge of my bed, hands clasped together like I used to when I was a kid, reciting half-remembered prayers. My words were hollow, slipping from my lips without meaning. I didn't believe anyone was listening. Why would they? I hadn't been to church in years and hadn't even thought about God in any real sense since I watched them lower my parents into the ground. But here I was, whispering prayers into the void, feeling stupid for even going through the motions.

The silence in the room felt suffocating. I let out a heavy sigh and ran my hands through my hair, pushing it back as I leaned forward, elbows resting on my knees. What was the point of all this? Every day felt like it bled into the next, an endless loop of nothingness. My friends had long since drifted away, and I couldn't blame them. I barely left the apartment anymore. Maybe they got tired of trying to pull me out of this pit when all I did was pull them in with me.

It was in the middle of that silence, that heavy, crushing stillness, that I heard it.

At first, I thought it was just my imagination—a voice, soft but clear, cutting through the haze in my mind. I sat up straighter, my heart pounding for reasons I couldn't explain.

"Jude," the voice said, smooth and comforting. "Jude, I've been watching you."

I froze, my mind racing. Was I hearing things? The voice was calm, almost soothing like it was speaking directly into my thoughts.

"Who...?" I whispered, my voice cracking from disuse. My heart thudded against my ribs, the pulse-quickening as the voice continued.

"I am God," it said simply as if that explained everything. "And I have chosen you."

A cold shiver ran down my spine. God? That's ridiculous. I hadn't believed in God in a long time. But there was something about the way the voice spoke, something that made my skin prickle with fear and... a strange sense of comfort.

"You feel lost," it continued, as if reading my thoughts. "You've drifted far from your path. But I am here now. I want to help you find your way again."

I didn't respond. What could I say to that? My brain told me this was crazy, that I was losing my mind. But there was a part of me, the part that had been drowning in loneliness and despair, that wanted to believe it was real. I wanted to believe that someone—something—had come to save me from myself.

I sat there for what felt like forever, staring into the darkened corners of my apartment, waiting for something else to happen. My heart was still racing, but my body felt frozen as if I couldn't move even if I wanted to. The voice—that voice—kept echoing in my mind. "I am God." It was absurd, wasn't it? I wasn't some religious zealot or a man of faith anymore. But what else could it be? It wasn't like I'd had visitors recently, and it didn't sound like the kind of voice that came from a mind cracking under pressure. It was too...calm.

"I know you're afraid," the voice spoke again, softer this time, almost gentle. "But there's nothing to fear. I've come to help you, Jude."

I swallowed hard, feeling the dryness in my throat. "Help me?" My voice came out quieter than I intended. I didn't want to sound desperate, but I knew I did. I felt desperate.

"Yes," the voice replied, as steady and comforting as before. "You've suffered long enough. I can see the weight you carry, the burden of your loss. Let me lift it for you. All I ask is to walk with you, to live through you, and to experience what it is to be human."

Something about the way it said that last part made my skin crawl, but I brushed it off. I wasn't in the position to question help, no matter how strange it seemed. Living through me? Experiencing humanity? That didn't sound so bad, did it? The Catholic teachings from my childhood floated to the surface of my mind—God moving through us, guiding our actions, helping us be better. Maybe that's what this was.

I felt a flicker of something I hadn't felt in years. Hope. If this was real—if it wasn't some kind of delusion—maybe this was my chance. My chance to make sense of everything that had happened, of everything I'd lost.

"What do you want from me?" I asked, my voice a little stronger now.

"Only what you've already been willing to give," the voice said, patient. "Your life, your experiences. I want to walk beside you, feel what you feel, and help you heal. In return, I will show you things you've never known. You'll find peace again."

Peace. God, did I want that. The kind of peace that didn't feel like drowning in sorrow. The kind of peace that would let me sleep without waking up in the middle of the night, gasping for air with my heart pounding like I'd just been buried alive.

I hesitated for only a moment longer before nodding, though I wasn't sure who I was nodding to. "Okay," I whispered. "If you're really God, and you can do what you say... I'll let you in."

The second the words left my mouth, I felt something—like a cool breeze slipping inside my chest, filling the hollow space that had been there for so long. It wasn't unpleasant, but it was strange. Like I could feel the presence of something...someone else inside me.

"Thank you," the voice said, quieter now but still soothing. "Together, we'll do great things."

I exhaled, realizing I had been holding my breath. The apartment seemed quieter now, still dark and cluttered, but there was a lightness in the air that hadn't been there before. It was subtle, barely noticeable, but it was enough to make me feel...different.

I stood up, shaky at first but steadier than I'd been in weeks. Maybe months. There was a new energy coursing through me, something alive and warm. It made me feel like I could take on anything. Maybe this was what faith felt like. Maybe I was finally finding my way back to something greater than myself.

"Now," the voice spoke again, guiding me, "let's begin."

The days that followed were the brightest I'd had in years. The voice, soft and steady, kept me going, encouraging me to make small changes in my life. At first, it was simple things—cleaning up the apartment, tossing out the piles of trash I'd let build up for months. It was amazing how different it felt, how much lighter the air seemed once the place wasn't suffocating under the weight of clutter. The more I cleaned, the more I felt like I could breathe again.

I started taking better care of myself, too. The voice, always calm and reassuring, nudged me to shower more often, to eat real food instead of living off frozen meals and takeout. The act of making a sandwich felt oddly fulfilling as if I was reclaiming something I'd lost. For the first time in what felt like forever, I actually looked forward to the little things. It was as if the voice had flipped a switch inside me, lighting up the parts of me I'd buried in the darkness.

"You're doing well," the voice would say, that comforting tone wrapping around me like a warm blanket. "This is the first step. You're on the right path."

And I believed it. How could I not? My life was improving slowly but surely. I wasn't just sitting in that dingy apartment, staring at the walls anymore. I was living again. The voice kept me focused, kept me grounded, and I found myself trusting it more with each passing day.

But it wasn't just about cleaning and eating better. One morning, as I sipped on a cup of coffee I'd actually brewed myself instead of grabbing from the convenience store, the voice nudged me toward something bigger.

"It's time to reconnect," it said as if it knew exactly what was on my mind before I even thought it. "Your friends have been waiting for you. They miss you, Jude."

I stared at the cup in my hands, the steam swirling up in delicate patterns. My friends. I hadn't thought about them in a while, not really. Sure, I saw them maybe five times a year, but it was always awkward like we were strangers who shared old memories but nothing else. Over the years, I'd shut them out, unwilling to burden them with my misery. Yet, the voice was right. They were still there, waiting for me. Maybe now that I had "God" with me, things could be different.

"They're important to your journey," the voice continued. "Reach out to them. Show them you're changing, that you're healing. They'll see it, and you'll help them too."

There it was again—that idea of helping others. The thought didn't just sit with me, it bloomed inside my chest like a seed sprouting new life. Maybe I could help them. Maybe this wasn't just about me anymore.

That afternoon, I sent out a few simple texts to the people I'd grown distant from. *Hey, it's been a while. Want to catch up sometime?*

To my surprise, they responded. Enthusiastically. Within a few days, I was sitting at a small café, sipping coffee with old friends I hadn't seen in months. At first, the conversation was light and casual—what everyone had been up to and how work was going. But as the hours wore on, we slipped into more personal territory.

It was Tom who brought it up first. He leaned back in his chair, eyes distant as he spoke about how he'd been struggling with anxiety, how it felt like the walls were closing in on him sometimes. I listened, nodding sympathetically, but I could feel the voice stirring in my mind.

"He needs to confront his pain," the voice whispered, soft but insistent. "Push him. Make him face it head-on."

I hesitated. Tom's words were heavy, filled with uncertainty, and it didn't feel right to dig into that. But the voice... it sounded so sure, so certain that this was the way. I shifted in my seat, trying to figure out how to approach it.

"You know," I began carefully, "sometimes you have to face that stuff directly. I've been going through some things myself, and what's helped me is... confronting it. Really digging deep, even when it hurts."

Tom blinked at me, surprised. His expression shifted—was that discomfort?—but I pressed on, the voice urging me forward.

"Maybe you need to look at what's really causing it," I continued. "Stop avoiding it. Let it hurt for a while, and then you'll come out stronger."

He didn't respond at first, just stared into his cup. The silence felt heavy between us like the air itself had thickened. My heart started to race—had I gone too far? Had I pushed too hard? But the voice was calm, unbothered.

"You're helping him," it said, soothing me. "This is what he needs."

Tom finally looked up, his eyes dark and stormy. "Maybe," he said quietly, but there was a tension in his voice, something fragile that I couldn't quite place.

The rest of the conversation was more stilted after that. We talked a little longer, but the warmth from earlier was gone. I left the café feeling uneasy as if something had shifted, but I couldn't pinpoint what it was. Still, the voice reassured me, telling me that this was how people grew—through pain, through confrontation. I convinced myself that I was helping Tom, even if it didn't feel that way at the moment.

That night, as I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, the familiar pain in my back returned. This time, it was sharper and more intense than it had been before. I groaned, shifting uncomfortably as the ache spread from my shoulders down my spine.

"Relax," the voice said, gentle but firm. "This is part of the process. It's how you grow."

I clenched my teeth as the pain intensified, a burning sensation now radiating from my shoulder blades. It felt like something was pressing against my skin from the inside, trying to break free. But even as the discomfort grew, I found myself accepting it, welcoming it. The voice was right—pain was necessary. It was how we became stronger, how we grew.

As the night wore on, the pain dulled into a throbbing ache, but I didn't fight it. I let it consume me, drifting into a restless sleep with the voice whispering softly in the back of my mind.

"This is only the beginning."

The next few days passed in a blur. My back still ached, but I pushed it to the back of my mind, focusing on the progress I was making. Things were... good. Or at least, they seemed that way. I was reaching out to friends more, keeping the apartment clean, and eating better. The voice kept guiding me, offering bits of advice that I followed without question.

But Tom had been quiet since our last meeting. At first, I chalked it up to him needing time to process what I'd said, but after days of radio silence, a small seed of doubt began to grow in my mind. Had I gone too far? Had I pushed him when he wasn't ready?

"You did the right thing," the voice reassured me. "He needs time, that's all. Growth comes through pain, Jude. You'll see."

I wanted to believe it. I needed to believe it. After all, the voice hadn't steered me wrong yet. My life was better because of it. So, I pushed my doubts aside and focused on the next step in my journey—reaching out to Mark, another old friend I hadn't seen in months.

We arranged to meet at a local bar, the kind of place we used to frequent back in the day before everything had fallen apart. When I walked in, Mark was already there, sitting at a corner table with a beer in hand. He smiled when he saw me, but there was something in his eyes—a flicker of hesitation, maybe. Or was it just my imagination?

"Jude," he said, standing up to greet me. "It's been a while."

"Yeah," I replied, forcing a smile as I shook his hand. "Too long."

We made small talk for a while, catching up on the usual things—work, life, the weather. But the voice was there, in the back of my mind, waiting. It felt like it was biding its time, waiting for the right moment to step in.

And that moment came after Mark's second beer, when he leaned in a little closer, his voice lowering as he talked about his recent breakup.

"It's been rough," he admitted, his eyes downcast. "I thought she was the one, you know? But... things fell apart. It's my fault, mostly. I guess I've just got too much baggage. She couldn't deal with it anymore."

The voice stirred, its presence stronger now. "He needs to face the truth, Jude," it whispered, insistent. "He's hiding from himself. Make him confront it."

I hesitated again, just like I had with Tom. But the voice's pressure was stronger this time, more urgent. It pushed me, and before I could stop myself, the words were spilling out.

"You know, maybe she left because you weren't dealing with your own problems," I said, my tone sharper than I'd intended. "Maybe she saw the cracks and realized you were never going to fix them."

Mark blinked, his expression shifting from sadness to confusion. "What?"

"You've got to face it, Mark," I continued, the voice pushing me forward. "You can't just blame it on her leaving. If you want to move on, you've got to face your own shit. Stop hiding behind the breakup like it's all on her. You're the problem, and until you deal with that, no one's ever going to stick around."

There was a long silence after that. Mark stared at me, his face tightening, a mix of shock and anger flashing across his features. I could feel my heart racing and the blood pounding in my ears. Had I gone too far again? Had I pushed him like I had with Tom? But the voice kept whispering, reassuring me.

"This is for his own good, Jude. You're helping him grow. Pain leads to understanding."

"I—I didn't mean it like that," Mark stammered, his voice shaky. "I... I don't know. Maybe you're right, but..."

His words trailed off, and he looked away, his jaw clenched. I knew I'd hit a nerve, but instead of feeling guilty, I felt something else—a sense of satisfaction. The voice was right. This was how people grew. By facing their pain head-on.

The rest of the night was awkward. We didn't talk much after that; we just exchanged a few strained words before Mark made an excuse to leave early. I watched him walk out of the bar, the weight of the moment pressing down on me, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I had done the right thing.

I sat there alone for a while, sipping my beer and replaying the conversation in my head. The more I thought about it, the more I convinced myself that I had helped him, just like I'd helped Tom. It didn't matter that they both seemed uncomfortable, even hurt by my words. Growth was painful. That's what the voice kept telling me, and I believed it.

As I walked home that night, the pain in my back flared up again, sharper this time. I stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, wincing as the burning sensation spread across my shoulders. It felt like something was moving beneath my skin, pushing against it, trying to break free. I stumbled, clutching at my back as the pain intensified, my breath coming in short, ragged gasps.

"Breathe, Jude," the voice whispered, calm and patient. "This is part of your transformation. You're becoming something more. Embrace the pain."

I stood there, hunched over in the cold night air, gritting my teeth as the agony ripped through me. But I didn't fight it. I couldn't. If this was what it took to fulfill my purpose, to help others grow, then I would endure it. I would let the pain shape me, just like the voice had promised.

After what felt like an eternity, the pain dulled, leaving a throbbing ache in its wake. I straightened up slowly, my body trembling, and continued walking home. By the time I reached my apartment, I was drenched in sweat, my legs barely able to carry me to my bed.

As I lay there, staring at the ceiling, the voice hummed softly in my mind, soothing me, calming me.

"You're on the right path," it said. "Soon, you'll understand everything. This is just the beginning."

I closed my eyes, my body still aching, but I felt something else now—something deeper. A sense of purpose. Of destiny.

Whatever was happening to me, I was ready for it.

I texted Mark again, asking if he wanted to meet up. The first few texts went unanswered, but I kept pushing. After what happened last time, I understood why he might not be too eager to see me. I told him I wanted to apologize and that I just wanted to talk things through and make things right. After a long wait, he finally agreed.

We planned to meet at my apartment this time. Something about the isolation of it felt right. The voice told me it was better this way—no distractions, no interruptions. We could really get into what was holding him back, and I could help him grow.

The day came, and Mark showed up looking uneasy, fidgeting with his jacket zipper as he stood in my doorway. I tried to smile, to put him at ease, but there was a nervous energy between us that made my skin prickle. Still, I invited him in, and he hesitantly stepped over the threshold.

The apartment was clean now, almost unrecognizable compared to the mess it had been before. Mark glanced around, visibly surprised at the change. "You've been busy," he commented, his voice strained with forced casualness.

"Yeah, I've been making some changes," I said, keeping my tone light. "Trying to improve, you know? Just like I want to help you do."

Mark's eyes flickered with something—worry, maybe—but he nodded and sat down on the couch. I could see how tense he was, the way his shoulders were hunched forward as if he was bracing himself for something.

We made small talk for a bit, just like we did at the bar last time, but I wasn't interested in the surface-level stuff anymore. The voice was there, whispering in the back of my mind, urging me forward. It was time to help Mark break through his walls.

"You've been struggling," I said, cutting off the light conversation. "Since the breakup. I know you're trying to move on, but you haven't really faced the real problem, have you?"

Mark stiffened. His eyes darkened, his lips pressing together into a thin line. "I... I don't want to get into all that again, Jude," he muttered. "Not like last time."

But the voice pushed harder, louder now, drowning out any second thoughts I might've had. "He needs to feel it, Jude. He needs to suffer if he's ever going to grow."

I leaned forward, my hands clasped together as I stared at him, my gaze unwavering. "You're never going to get past this if you keep running from it," I said, my voice firm. "You need to face the pain, Mark. You need to feel it, deep down, or you'll never heal."

Mark shifted uncomfortably, his eyes darting toward the door. "I... I don't think this is a good idea."

Before he could move, before he could stand up to leave, the voice gave a final command. "Show him. Make him feel it."

My hand shot out and grabbed his arm, gripping it tightly. Mark froze, his eyes widening in shock. "Jude, what are you doing?"

"You need to feel it," I repeated, my voice steady but my grip tightening. "This is the only way. You can't keep running from the pain."

I twisted his arm behind his back, forcing him to his knees as he yelped in pain. My heart raced, but the voice was there, soothing me, telling me this was right. This was how I was supposed to help him.

"Jude, stop!" Mark gasped, struggling against me, but I held him firm, pushing him down harder. His body twisted under the pressure, his breath coming in ragged gasps as I forced him to the ground.

The voice was relentless now, filling my mind with its commands. "Make him suffer. Only then will he understand."

My free hand reached for his throat, pressing down as his eyes filled with terror. His hands clawed at my wrists, trying to pry me off, but I didn't let go. I pressed harder, feeling his pulse quicken beneath my fingers.

"This is for your own good," I whispered, my voice trembling with some twisted form of reassurance. "You'll thank me for this."

Mark's face twisted in agony, his body writhing as he struggled to breathe. His gasps turned into choked sobs, and I felt something inside me shift, something dark and violent taking root. The voice hummed in satisfaction, feeding on the pain I was inflicting.

And then, suddenly, it wasn't just Mark who was suffering. A sharp, searing pain erupted in my back, so intense that I staggered, releasing him. My hands flew to my shoulders as the pain spread, tearing through me like a wildfire. I collapsed to my knees, gasping as the burning sensation reached its peak.

Mark scrambled away, coughing and choking as he stumbled to his feet. I barely noticed him flee, my mind consumed by the agony ripping through my body. I could feel something moving beneath my skin, pushing, stretching, breaking free.

The pain became unbearable, and I screamed, my voice raw and animalistic. My shoulders were on fire, my flesh tearing as something sharp began to poke through the skin. Blood soaked through my shirt, and I ripped it off, desperate to see what was happening.

My back was a mess of torn skin and blood, but beneath the gore, I saw them—two jagged, bony spikes protruding from my shoulder blades. They were growing, pushing their way out of me with sickening cracks and pops, stretching upward like twisted, blood-soaked wings.

The pain was unimaginable, but through it all, I felt... elated. The voice was there, soothing me, telling me that this was my transformation, my reward for doing "God's" work.

"You're becoming something more," it whispered. "This is your destiny. Embrace it."

I collapsed onto the floor, my body trembling, blood pooling beneath me. My vision blurred, the edges of the room darkening as I fought to stay conscious. But even as the darkness closed in, I couldn't help but smile.

I had done it. I had helped Mark, just like I was meant to. And now, I was becoming something greater—something divine.

As I slipped into unconsciousness, the last thing I heard was the voice, calm and reassuring.

"You've done well, Jude. You're almost ready."

The voice had grown louder and more demanding over the past few days. It wasn't satisfied with the small acts of pain I'd inflicted. I'd pushed Mark and Tom, I'd made them suffer, but it wasn't enough. The voice told me they were only steps on a path, a necessary part of my transformation, but there was more—something bigger, something I wasn't yet ready to see.

That night, the voice called to me with a new urgency.

"Now is the time, Jude," it whispered, its tone colder than before. "You've prepared yourself for this moment. You must bring suffering to the world. Only then will you truly become what I need you to be."

I didn't question it. How could I? Everything the voice had told me up to this point had been right. I had seen the changes in myself, the transformation happening before my eyes—before my *soul*. The spikes in my back were proof that I was becoming something more than human. The pain, the agony I endured, it was all part of the process.

But this time, the voice wasn't asking for words or emotional suffering. This time, it wanted something real. Something irreversible.

"Go out tonight," it commanded. "Find someone. A soul that needs to feel my presence. Bring them pain, Jude. Bring them to me."

I didn't ask why. I didn't hesitate. I simply did as I was told.

I left my apartment without a second thought, the cool night air hitting my skin as I stepped into the darkness. The city was quieter than usual. Empty streets stretched before me, illuminated by pale streetlights casting long shadows on the pavement. I felt a strange sense of calm as I walked as if I knew exactly what I needed to do.

The voice guided me, tugging at my mind, pulling me toward the quiet alleys and backstreets. I walked for what felt like hours, my body moving on autopilot until I saw her. She was standing by herself, waiting at a bus stop. A middle-aged woman dressed in a dark coat looking down at her phone. She was alone. Vulnerable.

"This is her, Jude," the voice said, its presence now overpowering. "She's the one. Her soul is ready. You must help her. Bring her pain, bring her closer to me."

I felt my heart racing, not with fear, but with anticipation. My hands twitched as I approached her, my footsteps barely making a sound on the cracked sidewalk. She didn't notice me until I was right behind her.

"Excuse me?" I said, my voice steady, almost friendly.

She turned around, startled. I could see the confusion on her face as she took a step back, her eyes flicking to the empty street around us. "Can I help you?" she asked, her voice shaking slightly.

"You need to feel this," I whispered, taking a step closer.

Her face contorted with fear, and she tried to back away, but I was faster. My hands reached out and grabbed her throat, squeezing tight before she could even scream. The shock in her eyes quickly turned to panic as she clawed at my arms, struggling to pull free.

"Shh," I whispered, tightening my grip. "This is for you. You need to feel the pain. It's the only way to get closer to Him."

Her gasps filled the air, her body thrashing as she tried to fight me off, but I held her down, pressing her into the ground, the cold pavement beneath us. My grip tightened even more, my fingers digging into her skin as her struggles became weaker, her eyes wide with terror. I felt no remorse, no guilt. This was the right thing to do. She needed this. I was giving her a gift.

Her body stopped moving after a while, the last breath escaping her lips in a faint, broken sound. I held on for a moment longer, waiting until the life drained from her eyes. When I finally let go, her body fell limp against the pavement.

I stood there, breathing heavily, my hands trembling as I looked down at her lifeless form. A strange sense of satisfaction washed over me. The voice had been right. This was necessary. I had done what was asked of me, and now... now I would finally receive my reward.

And then, the pain hit.

It was unlike anything I had ever felt before. A burning, searing agony exploded in my back, sharper than the spikes that had emerged before. I screamed, my body convulsing as I fell to my knees beside her corpse. My hands clawed at my back, but there was nothing I could do to stop it. The pain grew worse, spreading from my shoulders down to my spine as if my entire body was being torn apart from the inside.

And then I felt them—something large, heavy, and wet pushing through the torn skin of my back. The spikes, the ones that had been there for days, began to stretch and grow, tearing through the flesh with a sickening crack. Blood poured from the wounds, staining the pavement beneath me as the spikes unfurled.

I gasped, my breath catching in my throat as I felt them grow—long, jagged, blood-soaked wings erupting from my back. They spread wide, casting dark shadows in the dim light of the streetlamp, each movement sending waves of pain through my body. I could feel the blood dripping down my sides, pooling beneath me as the wings twitched and flexed, heavy and sharp.

But through all the pain, I felt... alive. I looked up at the sky, my body trembling as I knelt in the pool of blood, her lifeless body beside me. The wings beat once, twice, heavy and strong, sending gusts of air around me.

"You've done it," the voice said, soft but triumphant. "You've brought her to me. You've embraced your destiny, Jude. This is what you were meant to become."

The pain was unbearable, but it didn't matter. I had become something more—something divine. I had fulfilled my purpose. The wings, though grotesque and soaked in blood, felt like the final piece of my transformation.

I had killed for God. And in return, He had given me this.

As I knelt there, the blood still seeping from my wounds, I felt a strange peace settle over me. This was what I was meant to do. This was who I was meant to be.

I woke up in the hospital, strapped to machines, barely able to move. At first, I thought it was a dream—one of those nightmares where you can't scream, can't even open your eyes. But it wasn't a dream. This was real. I couldn't move, couldn't feel anything from the neck down.

They told me I had been found in the middle of the street, covered in blood, barely alive. The police thought I was the victim of some random attack. They said it was a miracle I'd survived at all. The woman—*the woman I killed*—they said she hadn't been so lucky. They told me they'd found her body next to mine, beaten, strangled. But they never suspected me. Not once. They said someone must've attacked us both, that I'd somehow made it out alive while she didn't.

It's strange. You'd think I'd feel relieved that I wasn't caught. But all I could feel was… devastation.

I had failed Him.

The wings—*my wings*—were gone. When I came to that hospital bed, paralyzed and broken, there was nothing left. No evidence of the transformation I had undergone. No proof of the divine being I was becoming. I had blacked out after my wings emerged, and now they were gone as if they had never been there at all.

And that… that is what haunts me the most.

I didn't get to finish the work. I didn't get to bring the world closer to Him, to help them understand the beauty of suffering, the purity of pain. When I lost consciousness, I must have disappointed Him. I failed God at the moment when He needed me most.

Now I lie here, in this bed, day after day. Paralyzed. Bedridden. Useless. They gave me this device to help me communicate and to speak my thoughts aloud so I could share my story. But what good is it now? What good am I now?

Still… even in this broken body, I feel something. A kind of peace. Yes, I failed Him in the end, but I was chosen. *I was chosen* to let Him experience life through me. And for that, I am grateful.

Every moment of pain, every act of suffering I brought into this world… it wasn't for nothing. I allowed God to live through me, to feel what it means to be human. That was His wish, and I gave it to Him. Even if I couldn't see it through to the end, I did what He asked of me. I let Him feel.

I lie here now, knowing I won't ever walk again. I won't ever leave this bed. But I still feel blessed. I was His vessel. I carried out His will, even if I didn't finish it.

No one knows what really happened that night. They think I'm a survivor, some poor soul who barely escaped with his life. But that's not true. I wasn't the victim. I was *chosen*. I was His instrument. And I will never forget that.

I close my eyes, and sometimes I can still feel the wings, the weight of them, the blood dripping from the tips. In those moments, I smile. I may have disappointed Him, but I let Him live through me. I gave Him what He wanted. And that's enough.
