I was 11 years old when it happened. The kind of age where you're still naive enough to believe the world is safe, but just old enough to start feeling the chill of things that don't quite make sense.

It was around 7:30 PM when my mom, my older sister, and I were on our way back from my friend Asher’s birthday party. The night had already settled in, and the streetlights flickered on as we passed down familiar roads. We had to make a quick stop at our old apartment complex. My mom was helping her friend, who had just moved into a new place, unpack with her babies—Echo and Aether. So, we pulled up, parked, and got out to lend a hand.

My sister was busy with some boxes, and I was tasked with carrying the babies’ potty training toilet down the outdoor stairs. The kind of errand that would have been boring on any other day, but tonight… it felt different.

I walked outside, my shoes tapping on the cold cement stairs as I descended. The night air felt heavier than usual, like it was pressing in on me. But what really struck me as strange was the flickering beam of a flashlight, bouncing on the walls of the stairwell, illuminating the dark space like someone was searching for something.

I froze.

At the bottom of the stairs, standing next to an old, beaten-up car, was a man. His face was hidden by the darkness, but I could make out his silhouette. His posture was strange. He didn’t move at first, just stood there with his head slightly tilted down, as if looking at the ground—but there was no reason for it. The moment I saw him, I felt a prickling sensation crawl up my spine.

I tried to ignore him and keep walking, but the man lifted his flashlight, its beam shooting in my direction. He was watching me now, like he was waiting for something. He didn’t say a word.

My legs stiffened, and I quickly ran back up the stairs, clutching the potty training toilet in my arms like it was some kind of shield. I reached the top, breathing a little too hard for comfort, and I found my mom still unpacking in the parking lot.

“Mom,” I said, my voice a little shaky. “There’s someone down there… he’s just standing there, staring at me.”

My mom looked up at me with a faint smile, too distracted with the move to really register the panic in my voice. “Oh, don’t worry about it,” she said, brushing it off. “That’s just our old neighbor, Jerry. He’s always out here fixing his car.”

“But Mom, he—he didn’t look normal. He was just staring at me… like he didn’t even blink.” I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off about the whole situation.

But my mom wasn’t listening. She turned back to the boxes, waving her hand dismissively. “He’s harmless. Don’t make a big deal out of it. He’s just doing his thing, fixing up that old car of his.”

I watched my mom walk off, but I couldn’t shake the image of the man, still standing there, his body rigid like some kind of mannequin. I hesitated before walking back down the stairs to finish my chore.

And then… I saw it.

He had gotten out of the car.

At first, I thought he was going to walk toward me, but no—he didn’t move at all. He just stood there, by the side of the car, his hands fiddling with something under the hood. The flashlight was still in his hand, swinging side to side as he “pretended” to fix the car, but the whole scene felt wrong. His motions were stiff, almost mechanical.

I walked faster, eager to get back to the safety of my mom’s side. As I turned around and looked at the man one more time, I noticed something that sent a shiver down my spine: his head was tilted slightly, like he was watching me again, but now there was something more than curiosity in his gaze. It was like he was waiting for something… maybe me?

I didn’t wait to find out.

I hurried back to the car, my heart racing. But when I looked over my shoulder one last time, I noticed something strange. The car was empty now. There was no sign of Jerry, or whatever his name was. He had disappeared completely—vanished into the night without a trace.

We left soon after, and I tried to convince myself that my mom was right, that it was just some weird, eccentric neighbor who liked to stand around late at night fixing his car. But every time I close my eyes and remember the way that man’s head tilted down, the way he stared without blinking, I can’t shake the feeling that he wasn’t just some neighbor at all.

To this day, I wonder if he was really waiting for me, if maybe something about that night wasn't just a coincidence. Sometimes, when I drive past that old apartment complex, I can't help but glance over, half-expecting to see him standing there in the shadows, flashlight in hand, watching, waiting.

Maybe I’ll never know. But one thing’s for sure: I haven’t been able to look at a flashlight the same way again.
