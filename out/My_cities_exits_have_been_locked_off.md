I live in a small city,there's no skyscrapers but the buildings are fairly large,there's some gun shops,malls,city essentials. As of 5 weeks ago military shutdown all roads and highways leading in or out of our city,they shoot anyone who try to leave, they've handed out some food and have compacted most of us in small camps near the center of the city,but some people like me are staying in their apartments and even inside malls,the cut off communication systems but have allowed us to have wifi,so not TO bad,I've looked online to see if there's any stories about this but no,there's no news articles about this,on the TV and computers there's a line of text simply stating:"stay near large groups and have a gun nearby,be safe" I don't know what it means.

I went outside recently,with 2 other guys,1 of them was a teen,16-17,he split off from us to take a piss,went with a revolver,10 seconds later,shots,we went to check on him. He was mauled to death,the type of mauling you'd see if a grizzly fused with crocodile and a pitbull,could barely recognize him,we took what remained and buried it,if I wasnt afraid I sure am now,feel bad for his parents.

There was a skirmish,one of the camps was shot up by some fucking lunatic,good news is that for the time being communication networks are back up thanks to a madlad,his name's Gary,fucking Gary,I owe him a pint now. I woke up last night, something was on my balcony,scared it off with the light but I got a good look,it was large,6-8 feet tall,4 arms with sharp claws,rest of the body I couldn't figure,made me shit myself,went up to that military checkpoint after learning that their handing out metal bars to put up on windows and balconies.

They destroyed an apartment complex,the evacuated it and then detonated some bombs,bet one of those things was there,people here started calling em "big armed fellas" funny name for such a beast. Military updated the text scroll now says: "abandon any pistols or lo caliber weapons,start using shotguns and semi-automatic weapons" military also got some helicopters up,BAF's must be scaring em.

They rolled an entire fucking battalion into the city,anyone they spotted on the streets or away from camps got shot,they got some of those BAF's as well,total fuckin martial law down there. BAF's fought back and mauled a couple soldiers, battalion decided to retreat,Gary says the kill count is 12 soldiers to 3 BAF's,I looked at some BAF corpses,their heads are splitjawed with 4 rows of sharp teeth,torso is all hairy.

JESUS FUCKING CHRIST,I BARELY SURVIVED A BAF,SHOTGUNED ITS BLOODY BRAINS OUT.

After my near death encounter with a BAF I decided to join a small milita callin em selves"big armed fellas extermination corps"
They got some full auto guns,ak's shotguns the sort,so for BAFEC has killed 21 BAF's. We found a man,got his armed sliced by a BAF,we watched his last moments...as he turned into a BAF,killed em.

We got a fella in BAFEC,his name's Jaiden,he theorizes that BAF's work like zombies,contact with with claws can cause someone to turn into a BAF if they survive,we believe that some BAF's will let their victims escape.

I saw a dog get devoured by a BAF,the BAF is now a red mist.

BAFEC now has a operation post in an
 apartment, military hasn't done jackshit since their battalion failed,we were able to retrieve a damaged APC however, so it's all good I guess.

Militaries pulled out recently,spoke to the few commanders who were staggering, apparently the BAF's have moved to a different city,from what they said BAF's are actually known as appolyons, apparently they rapidly evolve based on how well fed they are or due to climate.

Being left with this knowledge I've returned to a fairly normal life,just with the knowledge that theirs probably another city going through this same thing,I'd say to hell with it,I think it's time I get Gary the pint I ow him.
