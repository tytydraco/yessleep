  
I left home earlier on, and managed to find a job by agricultural feed company. My parents divorced because of mother’s drug problems and I dad ran off with his secretary. So, after working at the feed company and sleeping in my car, a co-worker at the feed company David, and the boss’s secretary offered me a place to stay.  
David was a pretty good friend to me, something he felt like my actual father wasn't ever in contact with me and had disappointed me in a lot ways and Sarah was more than a sister too, she taught me how to use makeup and gave me some wine to drink with her. I have conflicting feelings about David because he did play the role of a father well, he was always supportive of me and cared about me and my life. Even in writing this, I keep wanting to defend him. But at the same time, the point of all this is that he and Sarah have really fucked with my life, even now.  
  
When I first moved into the home with them, Things were generally calm, they had a list of chores I had to do to pay rent, but beyond that thing went well with them. Then suddenly around a month later David suddenly told me that my new punishment for not doing my chores was ‘losing rights’, like having the door removed from the room, strict curfew, and regulated phone use.   
I’m just 19, I thought maybe I would play it safe as I didn’t have anywhere to go  
 Most of my offenses had to do with talking back, attitude, disrespect, sloppiness, not doing chores, coming late from work, basically any kind of look on my face or action that they interpret as having a bad attitude, any excuse to ‘punish’ me anyhow. I wasn't a bad kid at all. I really wasn't. They always saw me do my work, and always treated me like an angel there, I never smoked or drank or snuck out. I rarely even cursed, and not in the house. I was terrified to do anything like that and be caught, because I was already being punished so often for much smaller infractions.  
  
Me complaining about being punished seemed to make them more creative with their punishments instead, always telling me stuff like "my house, my rules" and "you're never too old for a spanking." It also coincided with me losing sleep, having these bad dreams, and seemingly being agitated easily. David, and Sarah demanded I tell them where I kept the drugs that clearly were impacting me, but I began to believe the cause for my problems were the foods, drinks, and especially the awful Tannis Root necklace they gave me.  
  
My dreams kept getting worse, and my skin grew paler. I noticed my stomach had gotten larger. My boss began to eye me much closer, while my other co-workers avoided me. I heard what they said about me, and I knew it was Sarah behind the vile rumours. The reason for my drastic change, they believed, was that I snuck out late at night and engaged in naughty activities.  
  
I lost my job soon after, and that's when Rob and Sarah began to act strangely once again. They became nicer, reattached my doors, and I felt myself 'sobering up' as if a fog had been lifted off me. They gave me an allowance, and I spent most of my days shopping around. Suddenly, David and Sarah disappeared. I began to receive cheques in the mail to support me, but almost every piece of furniture they owned had disappeared, along with any proof they lived there. The house was now managed by some trust that sent me monthly stipends. It was as if none of us acknowledged it ever happened, and I even questioned myself occasionally... did this happen to me?  
  
A few days ago, I noticed that David’s desktop was still around; no password, just a tap of the keyboard, and it opened up. That's when I discovered it – hundreds of files and folders of videos and photos. Different girls levitating off their beds as hooded people recited some chants. I knew what it meant and searched the files for the period I arrived there, but before that, I noticed the humps emerging from all the women, and an abrupt stop of videos for each of the girls. Watching a few of the last entries, I saw the women convulse violently – all after 5 months, and I was on my eighth month here.  
  
I soon saw the footage marked special; it was me and a clear demonstration of what was done to me. Strangely, as I levitated off the bed, a strange smoke surrounded my body. My entire body froze and went completely ice-cold numb. Everything just made sense. And nothing made sense. I basically stopped believing in my whole world, my existence, my childhood, my parents – just everything. Even thinking back to that moment right now is making me shake.  
  
I instantly vomited at what I saw, as the reason for my sickness and large stomach became understandable. The necklace attached to me filled me with overwhelming disgust at David and Sarah. I was also disgusted at myself for letting them disappear. I went to my old boss at the Agri-store, but he still looked at me with disgust like some drugged-up streetwalker. Heading over to the hospital and police with the information I uncovered resulted in them simply ignoring me or advising I take supplements for my weight. They said I would need a medical aid scheme for them to take me seriously.  
Its been some stressfully weeks, and I have begun to feel it move in my stomach. Something doesn’t feel right about it and I’m scared what’s going to happen it I let this head in this direction.
