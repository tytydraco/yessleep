There was a piece of driftwood floating in the lake on what appeared by all accounts to be a warm and sunny day. The sun made a brilliant and somewhat dazing appearance after the morning storm earlier. Kyle and I were sat on the dock, taking in the sights and reminiscing on our second wedding anniversary. A warm breeze drifted between them and I sighed, leaning my head against the camping chair. 

“You will have to drag me kicking and screaming from this place.”

“Oh, I know,” Kyle smiled and then pointed up at the sky. “Look, there’s another one of the birds!”

We’d seen large birds swooping low all day, each one dazzling, not only because of their size but because of how opposite they were to the small sparrows back home. Kyle had reckoned them to be turkey vultures. Or maybe hawks. Really any large bird could do. 

“Why do you think they’re all gathered around here?” I asked. 

“Storm just blew through here so maybe it riled up the fish?” 

“Maybe,” I answered. “Oh, do you see that big old driftwood out there? Is that driftwood?” 

Kyle narrowed his eyes against the sun. 

“I think so. It looks like maybe it blew off a dock?” 

It bobbed slowly in the distance, unfazed by the choppy water. Maybe five feet in length, it still didn’t seem totally out of place out on the water. Kyle turned his attention back to the swooping birds but I followed the driftwoods progress. Up and down, it rode the small whitecaps. 

“Don’t you think it looks kind of weird?” I asked him.

“Mm not really,” Kyle answered, his eyes closed and basking in the sun.

I nodded, not saying anything. I was determined to enjoy this trip and had said as much beforehand. It had been a difficult time at work lately and admittedly I had not handled it well, feeling my anxiety threatening to overwhelm me at every opportunity. This trip was to celebrate our marriage, yes, but also Kyle had maintained that I needed a break. I was not going to ruin this vacation by fixating on a totally innocuous piece of literal wood. I came here to be a more relaxed and happy person. To be a different person. 

In true anxiety Liz fashion however, I had googled the area before they came. It was about two and a half hours south of their city and to be honest, it really seemed like not much happened here. It was a lake town, barely a town at all. More like a passing through space for sunburnt tourists. 

Only one thing had caught my anxious eye and it was an article from almost five years ago about a woman who went missing. By all accounts it looked to be a domestic violence incident, which while not comforting, had a distinct reason for happening that I knew I did not have to worry about. Neighbors in the news article reported fighting between the couple and the article went on to report 911 calls had been and the dismissed long before they ever came on this lake vacation. Nothing was ever prosecuted because nothing had ever been proved, but he looked like a mean guy in his mugshot and that was enough for me. It was sad and depressing and all of those things, but in my anxious brain, this was an avoidable threat. 

I was having a harder time getting rid of the image of her in the paper. She had pale blue eyes and shining blonde hair, her face frozen into a permanent grin in the photo. They always pick happy, smiling pictures of victims. I understand why, but something about still always seemed shocking to me. It was the idea that as happy as she looked in this photo, it hadn’t mattered. She had died anyway.

I couldn’t help my brain from drifting to that woman though as I sat on the dock. My eyes almost searching the water for her body, but only coming up with driftwood and the odd bird.

“Will you go grab me another drink?” I asked Kyle who was now dangerously close to drifting to sleep. 

He nodded and bleary eyed made his way back up to the cabin. 

The driftwood floated closer. 

It looked like a body.

It was not a body. It was a piece of driftwood. 

It had a weird shape.

It had been tossed around a little bit but it was still driftwood. 

It was rolling over. 

Driftwood does that sometimes. 

It was getting closer. 

Well, it is a lake with water and water moves things. 

It was moving closer faster than it should have. 

That was too fast for a piece of wood. 

That was too fast for anything. 

It hit the dock. 

Pale, sightless eyes met mine. A mouth opened in a silent scream, revealing only a few warped teeth, and lake water pouring between crevices where other teeth should have been. Whitecaps crested and fell where her lungs should have breathed. The smell was beyond anything I had a frame of reference for. Every living, breathing, human part of my body felt frozen. There was nothing human about the thing in front of me, but I still recognized her nonetheless, and reached out to touch the missing woman. 

It felt like lake water flooded my being and the last thing I registered in my small, anxious, human brain was the clouds drifting back in front of the sun as I sunk beneath the green water.

And then, like nothing at all, I was back. 

Kyle hummed to himself as he walked back down to the dock, two pina coladas in hand.

“Pina colada, freshly made for my baby girl,” he sung as he handed it to me, sitting stock still on the dock, staring out at the horizon. I vaguely registered some water dripping off my hair.

“Did you get splashed by something?” he asked as his hand drifted up to touch my hair. “Wow, you’ve been getting some sun! Your hair looks almost blonde.” 

“I’m feeling like a different person already.”

“Well, that was your goal,” he smiled and leaned back in his chair.
