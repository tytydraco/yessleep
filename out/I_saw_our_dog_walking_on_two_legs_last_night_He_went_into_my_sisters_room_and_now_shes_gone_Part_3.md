I’m writing this as we prepare to leave Father Moretti’s house. A lot has happened—horrible, *horrible* things—and I’m the one to blame. What was I even thinking? How will I ever forgive myself? It hurts just to put pen to paper, but I can’t allow a single detail to fade from memory.

We fled our home six days ago. We searched for Father Moretti’s house all night, and by the time we found it, it was nearly dawn. Dad kept glancing nervously in the rearview mirror the whole drive, and Mom was half-conscious from fear and exhaustion in the back seat. My heart pounded with every twist in the road, terrified that *thing* might appear in front of our headlights at any moment. But by some miracle, it never did.

Father Moretti’s house is tucked behind a row of barren trees—a small stone building with stained-glass windows that catch the early light in rainbow shards. The walls are streaked with moss, and the yard is overgrown, but it still feels like a church somehow, like a piece of holy ground hidden and forgotten.

When Father Moretti opened his door, I almost didn’t recognize him. I remembered him from when I was little, but he looked much older now—probably in his eighties. His hair was a fine dusting of white, and his hands shook slightly. Still, there was an energy in his eyes that made him seem stronger than he appeared.

He studied us like we were ghosts from his past. When Dad introduced himself, Father Moretti muttered, “Martin… David’s boy,” and his gaze softened with recognition before he let us in.

Inside, it felt part-home, part-chapel. The walls were lined with worn shelves crammed full of religious texts, prayer books, and ancient scrolls, but there was also a sofa with faded cushions, a well-used kitchen table, and a kettle perched on an old stove. Candles and crucifixes hung everywhere, like he wasn’t sure if the place was meant for living or worship.

We settled around a scarred wooden table. Father Moretti eyed us warily. When Dad told him why we were there—how we’d seen Rufus change into that *thing*, how it came for me, and how Amelia was gone—Father Moretti let out a low, humorless chuckle.

“I waited my whole life for this town to need faith,” he said bitterly. “And now you come to me with such a bizarre story… when I’ve no strength left to offer?”

He motioned toward the door. “You should leave.” My chest tightened as Mom began shaking her head, pleading through broken whispers. Dad’s voice cracked as he begged for help, desperation in every syllable. Father Moretti stared at us a long time, his expression unreadable, then sighed.

“All right,” he said at last, more gently. “I’ll let you stay. No one has ever come to me seeking God until this day. Now that someone has finally come, it would be the greatest of sins to turn them away, even if I have lost much of myself in the wait.”

I practically collapsed with relief.

He brewed tea and prepared a simple meal. None of us had much appetite, but he insisted that we eat. He asked us to explain everything again in more detail, scribbling notes and muttering words I couldn’t make out. I caught fragments—mentions of protection, evil, his family’s responsibility. He didn’t seem to fully understand everything he was saying, but it was clear he knew more than he let on.

When we finished eating, he asked us to rest. He moved his own belongings upstairs so we could all stay together in the larger room downstairs. He promised we were safe in his home.

Later, as we settled into the room Father Moretti had given us, Dad told Mom and me to rest while he went to talk to him. Mom had developed a slight fever. She lay down on the creaky bed, muffling her sobs in a pillow. I sat next to her, holding her for a moment. I wanted to stay and comfort her, but my curiosity got the better of me—I needed to know what Dad and Father Moretti were discussing. So I slipped out.

I found Dad just outside Father Moretti’s study. He gestured silently for me to come closer. Inside, Father Moretti was completely absorbed in his books and scrolls, muttering to himself. I could only make out one phrase: “I have to remember… I have to remember…”

Dad motioned for me to leave him be for now, so we went back to our room and tried to collect ourselves.

It must have been hours before Father Moretti finally emerged and went down to his basement. He returned with a large bag of charcoal. Without a word, he stepped outside and began placing small crucible pots around the house’s perimeter. He filled each with charcoal, lit them, and soon a thin ring of smoke rose around the entire property. The smell drifted inside—not sharp or stinging, but warm, earthy, and almost comforting.

When he came back in, Dad asked about it.  
“It’s to keep evil away,” Father Moretti replied. “I don’t remember how I got it or how it works, if it even does. But don’t worry, it won’t harm your breathing.”

That night, over dinner, Dad thanked him for letting us stay and for poring over his books all day trying to find something useful.

“But Father,” Dad continued, voice trembling, “I don’t understand. How can a dog—the one I’ve had for a decade—become… that? And I need my daughter back. It took Amelia. The whole town searched for her, and we found nothing, not a single clue. I don’t know what to do anymore. I—” He broke off, gripping the table, eyes wet with tears.

Father Moretti set down his fork and rubbed his temple. For a long moment, he didn’t speak, and silence filled the room. Finally, he sighed and leaned back in his chair.

“I’ll be blunt, Martin,” he said, sounding both steady and frustrated. “I’m old, and my memory’s weak. I can’t even make a decent cup of coffee without that dusty old recipe book.”

His gaze drifted toward the window, like he was searching beyond it. “My family has preached faith in Millbrook for over a century, but we didn’t just spread sermons—some Morettis dealt with the supernatural. Some even left Millbrook to learn from secret organizations about… something.” He paused, frowning as he tried to recall. “I can’t remember. It’s all so faint.”

He sighed again, heavier this time, and looked back at us. “They wrote books, journals, left behind knowledge so others could follow. I’ve spent the day reading them, trying to piece together anything that might help. I found two things: the sacred smoke boundary and—” He stopped abruptly, his brow furrowing. His expression turned guarded, and for a moment, he seemed to wrestle with himself. “Well, I suppose there are things I’m not allowed to reveal. Secrets that must stay within the Moretti family.”

Dad leaned forward, jaw tight. “Father, if it can help us—help my daughter—why keep it hidden?”

Father Moretti’s eyes softened, but his voice stayed firm. “Because some knowledge isn’t meant to be shared lightly. I need to see the evil with my own eyes before I can do more.”

Dad was silent for a moment, then said, “Then come with me, Father. Come to my house. I’ll show you the footprints I saw. The water might’ve dried up, but something must be there—an imprint.”

Father Moretti shook his head. “A faint footprint isn’t enough.”

Dad’s chair scraped as he stood abruptly. “Then what do you want me to do, Father? How do I bring you proof?” he asked, desperation leaking into his voice.

Father Moretti didn’t flinch. He folded his hands on the table. “Calm down, Martin. I want to help you—I do. But finding proof is never easy. I know your daughter is out there and she needs you, but if you rush into things, you might end up regretting it.” With that, he left for his study, not even finishing his meal.

That night, Mom tried to soothe Dad, insisting Father Moretti was only being cautious. Dad rested his head on her shoulder, saying, “I know, Sarah. But I… I can’t stand doing nothing while Amelia—”  
Mom started to cry, placing a hand on his head. “Our girls are brave. Amelia will be okay.”  
After a long pause, Dad murmured, “I’ll find a way, Sarah, if it’s the last thing I do.” Then he closed his eyes.

*I know you will, Dad. You always find a way*, I remember thinking as I peered out through a slightly open curtain. The smoke rose thickly from the pots. Beyond it, I felt a presence—like eyes on me. I tried to tell myself I was just being paranoid, but deep down, I knew I wasn’t.

In the days that followed, an unsettling routine took shape. Father Moretti kept burning charcoal. The smell seeped into our clothes and hair until it became a permanent reminder of why we were there. Mom and Dad tried to act normal, but it was obvious they could think only of Amelia. Dad spent hours coming up with ways to prove our story, but he also helped Father Moretti with chores from time to time. Mom looked hollow, with dark circles under her eyes. She kept trying to distract herself by assisting in the kitchen or tidying the cluttered bookshelves, though her face betrayed her exhaustion.

I think it was the night of the fourth day when I heard Dad shouting. He was with Father Moretti in his study. I ran to him immediately.

“If you want proof so bad, I’ll *get* it for you!” Dad yelled, striding toward the front door. “I’ll walk out there right now, track down that bastard, and drag it here—or let it tear me to shreds so you’ll have your precious *proof*!”

Father Moretti just flipped through his books, not reacting. Mom grabbed Dad’s arm. “Martin, have you lost your mind? It’s too dangerous!”

Dad looked right at her, his voice trembling. “I can’t wait any longer, Sarah! Amelia’s out there, alone, and God knows what that *thing* is doing to her!”

“Martin, please,” Mom’s voice shook. “It could kill you.”

Dad hesitated, obviously torn. He looked at me, then back at Mom, and sighed. “I don’t know what else to do,” he whispered, tears in his eyes. “We’re running out of time.”

Silence hung heavy in the room, broken only by the crackling fire and the rustle of Father Moretti’s pages.

Then, almost without thinking, I spoke. “There’s another way.”

Both Mom and Dad turned to me, their expressions a mix of confusion and hope. Even Father Moretti paused, glancing over his shoulder.

“What do you mean?” Dad asked, his voice cautious.

I hesitated, my heart pounding. “It’s just… I think it’s still out there. Watching us.”

Mom frowned. “Clara, what are you talking about?”

“Sometimes, at night,” I began, my voice barely above a whisper, “I hear things. Rustling in the trees. Movement just outside the boundary of the smoke. I always told myself it was nothing, that it was just my imagination. But what if it’s not? What if it’s still waiting for us to let our guard down?”

Father Moretti turned fully, studying me. “Go on,” he said quietly.

I took a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves. “I think we can lure it out,” I said. “Make it think we’re vulnerable. If we can get it to come close enough, maybe we can catch it—or at least get the proof you need.”

Mom shook her head, panic flashing in her eyes. “No. Absolutely not. That’s too dangerous.”

“It’s *already* dangerous,” I argued, my voice stronger now. “If we don’t do something, we’ll never find Amelia. We’ll never stop this thing.”

Dad looked at me, his expression unreadable. “And how do you suggest we do that?” he asked.

I swallowed. “We let the smoke die down,” I said. “Make it look like we’re getting careless. We act normal—like we’re not scared anymore. And then…” I hesitated, the weight of what I was suggesting pressing down on me. “And then we wait.”

Father Moretti’s eyes flickered with something—concern, maybe, or recognition. He stepped forward, his hands clasped tightly in front of him. “And if it comes?” he asked. “What will you do then?”

I swallowed. “We run to the basement. We’ll keep the charcoal burning there. It’ll be safe.”

Dad frowned. “And if it doesn’t work?”

“It *will*,” I said, trying to sound confident. “It has to.”

No one spoke for a moment. Then Father Moretti said quietly, “I may have something to help. Wait here.”

He turned and disappeared down the hall, leaving the three of us to exchange uneasy glances. My heart was racing, but I forced myself to stay calm. This had to work. It was the only plan we had.

A few minutes later, Father Moretti returned, carrying a polished metal case. He opened it carefully, revealing a set of six glass spheres, each filled with a dense, swirling smoke.

“These,” he said, “are concentrated smoke bombs. If the books are right, they’ll release enough smoke to weaken or stun the creature. I hope we don’t have to use them, but if we do, there are only six.”

I nodded, feeling a flicker of hope. The plan was risky, but now, at least, we had a chance.

For a few days, we kept reducing the charcoal in the pots. We went outside during daylight as if unafraid. Each night, I’d walk to the kitchen around midnight, staying visible, acting casual. My nerves were strung tight, but I forced myself to appear calm. I often sensed eyes upon me—could almost hear low growls carried on the wind—but I never saw anything.

Until last night.

It was the chosen night. Father Moretti let the pots burn out completely. The house felt suddenly exposed without that protective haze. He said he’d feign sleep upstairs. Mom moved to the basement, where we had the charcoal burning. Dad hid in the study, glass bombs at the ready, and I waited for midnight before going to the kitchen all alone.

The plan was to wait for the creature to enter the house, incapacitate it with a glass bomb before it reached me, and then immediately run to the safety of the basement. For a moment, it felt like I could do it—but then, in the very next moment, it felt like I was way out of my depth.

The moon broke through the clouds, casting silver light across the floor. I waited, heart hammering, clinging to one of the delicate glass bombs. My free hand shook uncontrollably. I kept telling myself, *You can do this, Clara.*

That's when I saw it. Not the creature, but *someone*, a woman, lying flat on her back in one dark corner of the kitchen.

I didn’t throw the glass bomb right away because it looked like Mom at first. *Maybe she’s been sleepwalking?* I remember thinking.

“Mom?” I whispered, stepping closer.

But it wasn’t Mom. The body was practically a skeleton, like it hadn’t been fed for months. I remember how badly my body started shaking when I recognized Amelia’s face. I rushed over, cradling her in my arms, but her eyes were lifeless. She was dead. Her skin was pale and cold, her body reduced to bones under peeling skin. She barely resembled my sister anymore. Tears streamed down my face as I tried to scream her name. But then, I felt hot breath on my neck.

“She was delicious,” it whispered. I knew that voice. I felt a surge of hopeless terror within me. I couldn’t move; I just stared at Amelia’s corpse—her body was whole.

“I didn’t *eat* her, little Clara,” it said. “I only made pups with her.”

I wanted to reach for the bomb, but I was paralyzed. Tears kept rolling down my cheeks as it laughed—a sick, sniggering laugh that made my stomach churn.

“And she was delicious,” it repeated softly.

“No…” I managed, voice barely a breath.

“You, little Clara,” it rasped, its breath foul against my skin, “you’re stronger than her, smarter than her. You’ll do much better.”

Its hand—a grotesque, twisted thing of fur and flesh—landed on my shoulder. I was paralyzed with fear, unable to breathe, unable to think.

Suddenly, there was a loud *bang*. Smoke engulfed the kitchen, and the creature screeched in pain.

“CLARA, CHILD, RUN TO ME!” Father Moretti’s voice echoed. I didn’t think—I just sprinted. I tore through the smoke, past the creature, and into the hall. Father Moretti and Dad stood ready with more glass bombs in hand.

“To the basement!” Father Moretti shouted.

I fled, my heart pounding so hard I thought it’d burst. The basement door was only a few steps away. *It’s going to be okay*, I told myself. But then I heard the creature again.

“You’ve forgotten too much, priest,” it snarled, panting. “The smoke… *annoys* me. But… *kill* me, it cannot.”

It lumbered out of the smoke, silhouetted by the moonlight. For the first time, I saw it fully—and immediately wished I hadn’t. It was almost twice as tall as Dad. Its horns were huge, curving like a crescent moon, each one over two feet long. Its eyes glowed a fierce red, and its twisted face looked almost like Rufus but warped and disgusting. Where a muzzle should have been, there was a human mouth lined with jagged, yellow teeth. A thick beard clung to its cheeks, but its chin was bare. Its body was monstrous—bulky muscles, patches of matted fur, and limbs that were too long, ending in sharp claws reflecting the moonlight.

I stood there, horrified. Father Moretti threw another smoke bomb, but the creature swatted it aside, baring its teeth in a grin.

“I will have her tonight!” it roared, then lunged for me with impossible speed.

I couldn’t move, but Dad grabbed me and yanked me toward the basement door. “Run, Clara!” he shouted.  
We almost made it, but the creature was faster. Its claws tore through the air, slashing Dad’s back. He screamed, collapsing to his knees, blood soaking his shirt.

“Dad!” I screamed, voice cracking.

The creature stood over us, ready to strike again. Suddenly, another smoke bomb exploded at its feet, forcing it to stagger back. Its roar rattled the walls.

“GO!” Father Moretti bellowed.

I hauled Dad to his feet, his blood hot against my hands. We stumbled into the basement. Mom was there, holding the door open, her face white with fear.

The creature roared in rage, slamming against the walls, but it couldn’t enter through the charcoal smoke. We huddled together, shaking uncontrollably. Mom tried to stop Dad’s bleeding with a torn cloth, and he winced, saying nothing. I clung to both of them, sobbing as the reality of it all—Amelia’s death, my own guilt, the creature itself—came crashing down on me.

That long, dreadful night in the basement felt like it would never end. I tried to keep my eyes shut, but I couldn’t stop picturing Amelia’s face, her sunken cheeks, her lifeless body. Every time I looked at Mom or Dad, a fresh wave of guilt broke over me. They needed to know—*had to know*—but I couldn’t bring myself to speak the words.

The creature’s pounding on the walls eventually stopped, and silence followed. I thought, just for a second, that maybe it had given up. But then I heard Father Moretti scream.

“NO!” I cried, jumping up. I tried running to him, but Mom grabbed me.

“We can’t help him, Clara!” she sobbed. “We can’t leave this smoke!”

Dad tried to stand, but his injuries were too bad. He fell back against the wall, cursing under his breath. Father Moretti’s screams were awful—raw, tearing, like nothing I’d ever heard. I covered my ears, crying, while Mom held me, tears streaming down her face. Dad slammed his fist on the floor in frustration. Then, as suddenly as they started, the screams went silent.

The hours between that moment and dawn stretched on, full of my parents’ muffled sobs and my own silent tears. I kept replaying the last glimpse I had of Amelia, her sightless eyes, how fragile her body felt in my arms. *They’ll see it soon*, I thought again, dread coiling in my stomach. *They’ll know.*

Morning light crept into the basement, and we finally dared to come out. The house was dead quiet, still heavy with the smell of smoke. We found Father Moretti in the hall, lying in a pool of his own blood. His body was covered in deep wounds, his cassock shredded. He had fought with all his strength, but he was just a man against a nightmare. I collapsed to my knees, tears burning hot down my cheeks as I laid my head on his lifeless chest.

In his own blood, he’d scrawled three final words on the floor:  
**Church basement monolith**

The letters were jagged and uneven, written with what little strength he must have had left.

Mom knelt beside me, her eyes darting between the bloody message and Father Moretti’s lifeless body. “Do you think it’s something he wanted us to find?” she asked, holding back her sobs.

“I don’t know, Mom. I—I don’t know anything,” I said as I cried.

“It’s okay, honey. We’ll think about it later. Let’s first give the man a proper burial,” she said, placing her hand on my head.

She didn’t know that it wasn’t just Father Moretti’s death that was making me cry. It was also the horror of knowing that Amelia’s dead body was lying just a few feet away in the kitchen.

After a few moments, I told Mom and Dad that I needed a glass of water and went to the kitchen. I wanted to look at her once before telling them. But when I walked in, the corner was empty. Her body was gone, as if I had dreamed the entire thing. My knees went weak, and I had to steady myself against the counter.

Did the creature take her, dragging her away for whatever cruel purpose it had? …Or—was it just a trick of my mind to begin with? A hallucination conjured by my fear, or even some illusion the monster created to torment me. If that’s true, maybe Amelia is still alive somewhere. I know I sound desperate, but I cannot abandon hope, no matter how insignificant it is.

“Clara?” Mom stood in the doorway, her face gaunt. “What’s wrong?”

*Tell them.* The words lodged in my throat. If Amelia was alive, kindling that hope could destroy them. If she wasn’t… I couldn’t be the one to extinguish it.

“Nothing,” I whispered. “Just… checking something.”

We buried Father Moretti in his yard, in a patch of earth where morning sunlight fell through the leafless branches. Dad’s hands shook as he dug, the shovel biting into frozen earth. Each thrust jarred his wounds, but he refused to stop. Mom knelt beside the grave, her lips moving soundlessly—a prayer without words. When we lowered him into the ground, she pressed his rosary into his palm.

Dad stood rigid, staring at the cross we’d lashed together from splintered chair legs. “He deserved better,” he said, more to himself than us. A tear traced the dirt on his cheek.

I said nothing. The guilt was a stone in my gut, but beneath it simmered something colder: resolve. *Church basement monolith.* The words gnawed at me. Hadn’t Father Moretti talked about “family secrets” over dinner that night? He hinted that there was something even more effective than charcoal smoke.

As we turned back to the house, I paused. My mind went to Millbrook’s abandoned church, the original church built by the Moretti family. Moss crawled up its walls now, and the cross atop it was rusted and crooked.

But that’s where we’ll find the monolith.

Mom touched my shoulder. “Come inside, Clara. You’re shivering.”

I let her guide me, but my mind stayed fixed on the Moretti church. Whatever waited in that basement—holy or hellish—we’d face it. For Amelia. For Father Moretti.

And if the creature followed?

Let it come.

—Clara
