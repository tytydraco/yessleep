dec 14th,2001

I don’t exactly know what to do, I’m currently writing this in my office, my doors are boarded up with all the furniture I could find but I don’t know how much longer I’m going to be here for, or how long it’s going to hold, head my warning if anybody finds this journal

I don’t remember exactly when it started, all I know is that when I first noticed the discrepancies I was visiting my mother’s grave again, it’s a few miles off of Main Street and slightly beyond deadman’s swamp, I still don’t know why she demanded to be buried there of all things,but she was, and my brother obliged

I was placing my normal bouquet of forget-me-nots on top of her tombstone when I first noticed it.

Far beyond the horizon of the Swamp,when the hill started to incline again,stood a four legged creature,I couldn’t identify what animal it was, or even if it was one, but it didn’t seem like anything I’ve ever seen before, legs were long crooked and bent every way that they shouldn’t be.

It’s neck was bent in ways I can’t even begin to try and explain,nothing made sense about it appearance,It had a long and jagged tail that bent upwards and downwards,, it didn’t make sense,

But out of the entirety of its looks,the only thing I could remotely identify was its face

its face was human

It was somebody I’ve seen before

The only person that it could’ve possibly been was Brook

Brook went missing last winter.

According to her manager she apparently got off her shift at the local convenience store early and never came back,

The creature had swayed a bit,simply staring at me with those far to human eyes, and that grin was far too big for any kind of human face to allow without ripping by the seems,its teeth weren't showing,,it stared at me for God knows how long,I had returned its gaze in terror

Then it sprinted it off God knows where, it was faster than anything I had ever seen, and after a second I ran,only I did not know at the time that it was a horred mistake

I ran back to my apartment building

It followed

The next few days were normal,too normal for my liking, but nothing happened,I woke up as normal,went to my stupid job at the radio station as normal,came back home as normal,even alone on the terminals of the train station I didn’t see it,even with poor lighting,I thought I was safe

until I saw it again underneath a street lamp, a block away from me

It didn’t have Brook’s face this time

It had my mothers

It was only a block away from me this time, it was huge, it’s crooked neck was seemingly at its full hight, it was taller than my apartment building, staring at me with black eyes and a closed grin that wasn’t human

I couldn’t move

I don’t remember what happened next to the wall I know is that I woke up on the groundof the pavement I was walking on

It was daytime, but something was wrong

There was no one around, then normally in bustling city that was my home was empty, A husk of a bustling city, and it was only me and the creature,I could see it,it was on top of a few buildings over

I ran back to my apartment, and now I am here, the creature it staring at me through my window

It has my face

It’s jaws opening

I’m sorry, Jacob, I’m sorry I didn’t come to your wedding because there was a big make or brake deal for the radio station, I’m sorry I didn’t come to your daughter’s first birthday,I’m sorry I wasn’t there for your college graduation,

I’m sorry, Lisa,I’m sorry I didn’t come to dad’s funeral,and I’m sorry I didn’t come to Mom’s,im sorry I wasn’t there for you.I’m sorry for missing everything

I’m so sorry.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
