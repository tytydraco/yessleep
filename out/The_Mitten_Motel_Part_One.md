The Mitten Motel is located in the middle of nowhere Michigan. It is surrounded by miles and miles of woodland, making it extremely easy to drive past. Most people don’t even know it exists and those who do, know not to stay in any of our rooms. With such a small clientele, I have no idea how this place stays in business. I’m even more surprised that the cops aren’t banging down our door and putting my supervisor and I in handcuffs. Maybe these stories will be the evidence needed for that to finally happen…it’ll be surreal to sit in a courtroom and have my own words read back to me by the prosecution.

Anyway, let's get into how I got this job and then start spoon feeding the prosecution the easiest convictions they’ve ever had.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I’m a seasonal worker here at the Mitten Motel. I applied here for two reasons. First, I didn’t know anything about this place when I put in my application. Second, I was recently kicked out of my parents house and was on my own.

I slept on park benches for a few weeks before seeing the ‘HELP WANTED’ ad on a newspaper I stole off my parents front porch. I meant to just take it and throw it out as a final middle finger to my father who couldn’t start his day without a cup of coffee and the paper. But, when I went to toss it in the trash I saw the ad on the back. Seeing that I could have a roof over my head as I got back on my feet, I jumped at the chance. 

After hitchhiking my way to the motel, I was finally able to see it in all of its glory. It was a single level motel with ten rooms. The bright red doors clashed with the puke green paint that was peeling from the building’s brick exterior. A single large window faced out towards the road and I noticed there were only two cars in the parking lot. 

A bell hanging from the door frame rang as I entered the area marked as the check-in office. My soon to be supervisor, Dale, glanced up at me from behind a computer that came fresh out of the early 2000’s. The room was pretty much just a glass box, with each wall (except the one behind Dale) being made up of large windows. The room smelled like someone had just poorly cleaned up a dead body, making the air heavy with the scent of chemicals and death. The kind of smell you get at a nursing home.

Dale's eyes slipped back to the screen in front of him as his gruff voice cut through the silence between us. “What do you want?”

I frowned a little at his comment and walked up to the desk, “I want a job. I saw your ad in the paper and–”

“No you don’t.” Dale cut me off, still not looking up from his screen. I tried to peek at what he was doing but I couldn’t get a good enough angle.

“Yes I do. I’ve worked in the service industry before–”

“No. You. Don’t.” Dale simply stated again. Even though the credentials that were about to spill from my lips were false, his rejection made me even more determined to get the job.

I leaned over the desk and closer to him, trying to burn a hole through his head with my eyes. “Okay, tell me how you know I don’t want the job.”

Dale’s eyes drifted to my face lazily. I tried to read his expression, as I’m sure he was trying to read mine. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t get a read on his emotions. He was like a blank canvas. The silence between us hung heavily on my mind, as if trying to suck more words from my mouth, more arguments, more urging, more pleading. But I bit my tongue and forced myself to continue the staring contest with Dale.

“Alright.” He let out a sigh. I could tell he wasn’t convinced, but I was willing to prove myself to him. He waved me over to the other side of the desk. I rounded the corner, just in time to see him minimize a paused Galaga game. He pulled up an employee form and printed it out. A printer under his desk sprung to life as he pulled out a key from one of the drawers. “Your room is number 6…” He dropped the key into my hand, “And this is the form you need to fill out for your employment.” He picked up the warm print and handed it to me. “If you can last the night and return this to me by morning, you’re hired.”

I chuckled a bit, “last the night? What do you mean?” Dale didn’t even smile back as he looked up at me. Again, silence hung between us before Dale turned back to his computer. I shuffled a bit awkwardly, “O…Okay, I-I’ll see you in the morning.” I chuckled again more to relieve nerves than anything else. Wordlessly, I turned and walked out of the door. Dale must have turned the volume on the computer back on, because under the tone of the door bell I heard the distinct sounds of Galaga.

The room itself wasn’t anything special. Like every motel it had two beds, a bathroom, a closet, and a tv sitting on top of a dresser. I didn’t have much besides the clothes on my back so that dresser wasn’t going to get used anytime soon. I was also pleasantly surprised not to find any bed bugs hiding anywhere. The rest of the day was pretty mundane. I filled out the form Dale had given me, walked around and found where the vending machines were, flicked through the channels to find my favorites, and mindlessly scrolled through my phone.

A while later I was ripped from scrolling when loud bangs shook my door. I quickly sat up, nearly jumping out of my skin, my eyes flying to the door. I sat in silence waiting for whoever knocked to do it again. The slamming came again but on another door further down the row of rooms, followed by feet running past my door and the hushed giggles of children. '*Fucking kids'*, I thought to myself as I laid back down and pulled out my phone. 

The banging came again sending my phone flying into the air. It landed softly on my bed as my eyes immediately shot to the door. However, as I waited to hear the giggling and running again, a thought slipped from my subconscious into my consciousness, like an air bubble rising to the surface of calm water. And just like that bubble, the realization sent ripples through my mind and body. My hands became clammy and my throat dried up, as I peeled my eyes away from my front door, and turned to look at my bathroom door. '*I had to have heard that wrong…Right?'* My world tossed and turned like a ship during a storm. I didn’t trust my balance enough to pick up my feet, so instead I shuffled towards the bathroom door. I reached out, my logical side berated me for my irrational fear. It told me that I was crazy. There was no way into this bathroom other than the door that was now right in front of me. But my illogical side told me what I heard must have been true, and it was much, much louder than my logical side. 

My hand wrapped around the knob. I could feel my muscles tensing as if trying to stop me from making any movements to open the door. My body seemed to know that whatever was on the other side was dangerous, it didn’t want me to open it. At this point, both the illogical and logical parts of me were in a harmonious cry to find out what was in the bathroom. One wanted to prove there was nothing to fear, and the other wanted to prove there was. 

My body and mind were in tug of war, as I began to force the knob to turn. But I didn’t even get far enough to unlatch the door before my feet moved on their own. I dove back like I had touched a live electrical wire. I stared at the closed door. My mind had been silenced. All I could hear was the pounding of my heart and my gasps for breath, like I had just ran a marathon. I took a shaky shuffle back before all hell broke loose. Pounding started at my front door again, much louder than before. But somehow, the laughter was even louder. It sounded like children with megaphones were standing around me in the room screaming and laughing. Then the pounding slowly moved from the door to the left wall, then behind me. The pounding circled around my room getting faster and faster, louder and louder. The noise from the children seemed to grow as well. All I could do was tightly push my hands against my ears. I closed my eyes and tried to scream, but I couldn’t hear it over all the noise.

Then suddenly, it stopped. Like someone had just pressed pause on a movie. All at once the sounds disappeared. 

I must have curled up into a ball at some point, because when finally I dared to open my eyes, I was looking up at the now open bathroom door. It was empty just like the rest of the room. Nothing seemed out of place. I would have thought it was all in my head if it weren’t for the blood dripping from my ringing ears and my sore throat.

The rest of my sleepless night was spent sitting in the corner of the room. I didn’t even bother to wash the blood off my hands because I didn’t trust that bathroom anymore. The sun must have been up for a few hours before I even trusted the front door enough to walk out.

Despite the night's events, I was still desperate for a job and a place to stay. So the first thing I did was walk into that check-in office and hand Dale the form. I felt some pride when the first bit of emotion he showed me was surprise. His face quickly slipped back into its usual blank look as I handed him the form. He took it without even glancing at the bloody hand print I had left behind.

He dug around his drawer again after setting the paper down on his desk. pulling out another key, he handed it to me, “this is your employee key. It gives you access to everything you will need while working here. Don’t lose it. You will start after you get yourself cleaned up.”

And that was my first experience with The Mitten Motel. I’m sorry to the paralegal that will be reading through this because, as far as I’m aware,  there isn’t a chargeable offense on this entry. I promise I’ll eventually start getting into them. But for now, I have to get back to work.
