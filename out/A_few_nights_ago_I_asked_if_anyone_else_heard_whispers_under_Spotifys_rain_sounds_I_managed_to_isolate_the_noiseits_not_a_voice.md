I didn’t love the skepticism from my friends, but they weren’t wrong to question me. They all know I spend my evenings riding a potent weed gummy from the nearby res. Still, I hadn’t hallucinated the sound. I’d just given it too much meaning.

I dumped the track into Spleeter. It spat out a folder of WAVs. Vocals, drums, bass, other. The rain scattered itself across the last three, highs, lows, and a smeared hiss.

The vocals track was almost empty. Almost. Near the end, five seconds refused to disappear.

It wasn’t a voice. It was chatter.

*Click, click. Hiss. Tick, tick. Hiss. Zzz.*

I tried Lalal .ai next. Two outputs this time. One labeled “vocals,” one “instrumental.” The rain stayed intact under the instrumental. The vocals were nearly the same as before, just flatter, more compressed.

*Click, click. Hiss. Tick, tick. Hiss. Zzz.*

I still think I found something interesting. A lot of people are telling me to let it go. Nobody’s whispering to babies in their sleep, slipping subliminal commands into rain tracks. It’s just static. An air conditioner switching on in the room where it was recorded. Distant human infrastructure. The mic power-cycling. Or a phone recording, a tiny motor running somewhere behind the lens.

It would help to know how the rain was made. Whether it was simulated in software or recorded straight to a mic. What kind of mic. Where it was placed.

It sounds like rain on a roof. A top-floor bedroom. But I know that’s just me reaching for memory, building a room around a sound. Meaning sneaks in that way.

An expert could clear this up. Or at least narrow it down. I didn’t expect much when I reached out, but the first reply came back fast, confident enough to make me sit up.

“It’s not simulated, or a loop. I can tell you that much right off the bat,” said Mark Hallsan, the sound engineer behind NATURALIS, another rain-sounds artist on Spotify. “I do love a good mystery.”

I’d mentioned them in my earlier post. Their work is well documented. Field recordings. Nature only. Released under National Geographic, with proceeds routed to conservation.

“Any clue as to what the *other* noise is?” I asked him over the phone.

“Eh—no. Not immediately. My hunch is it’s a watermark. In case someone steals their work, they can prove it’s theirs.”

“Do you guys use watermarks?”

“No, we don’t have to, though. We’re all under the Disney umbrella. They’ve got much more sophisticated means to check if someone stole our work,” said Mark. “Here. Let me play with it a bit. Reverse it, chop it up. It could be a name heavily disguised. Maybe even the location where it was recorded.”

The name was supposed to be Napt1me Therapy, but now I suspect that’s just one alias for a single artist with multiple accounts. My hunch came from digging further into their profile. On Spotify, you can start a “radio” from a single song, a playlist of adjacent tracks: same genre, similar sound, related artists.

Two immediately caught my eye: Rainy D4y Sm0ke Sesh and D33p Focus Study Ambience. The AI-art pattern continued. The artists’ photos: a pot leaf, a glowing pink brain. The album covers were stranger still—anthropomorphic animals smoking in bed as rain hammered the windows, anime boys scribbling in notebooks while rain pattered outside.

These artists were far less popular than Napt1me Therapy. Plays rarely broke a hundred per track. The titles were cryptic: “Pull It Off We’re Finished,” “Valuable Things Missing,” “It Couldn’t Have Existed Then.” I played them all, drawn by an eerie familiarity, like I’d heard them before. When the track “I Decided Against It” played, I swear, it might have been the one that started it all. What had once been “Sit still while it sinks in” was now these mysterious clicks, snaps, and blips.

Still, every track, no matter how haunting, preserved the specifications that made the rain perfect for sleep. Soft, flat thuds. Hollow pops.

“It’s rain coming down on a tent,” said Mark during our next FaceTime. “I ran it against a bunch of reference recordings. Same attack, same decay. Each drop hits, spreads, then dies fast. No ring. No echo.”

“And the other part of it?” I asked.

“The crackling. I think it’s coded,” he said. “A cipher. The problem is, without knowing the baseline, it’s almost impossible to crack.”

“Baseline?”

“Every digital signal has a reference point. Volume, timing, pitch. It’s all relative. You hide patterns in tiny deviations. Louder here. Quieter there. A millisecond early. A millisecond late. Pops so small they vanish into noise unless you know what zero is. Or whatever your key happens to be.”

I paused. The answer felt almost embarrassing in its simplicity. “What if the key is right there? In the name.” I said it slowly. “Napt1me. The one.”

Mark didn’t answer right away. His eyes flicked offscreen. “That’s… interesting,” he said. “If one’s the calibration constant, I want to see what it resolves into.” He set the phone down. The screen went dark. “Give me a few minutes.”

“Worth a shot,” I said.

While I waited, I queued up one of the tracks again. Low volume. The rain fell evenly, disciplined. Each drop arrived on time, struck, vanished.

I pulled up the waveforms Mark had sent earlier. Spectrograms. Dense bands of color I didn’t know how to read. Flat. Then a blip. Flat again. Another blip.

It reminded me of numbers stations I’d read about late at night. Shortwave broadcasts used by spies. Calm voices reading digits into the dark. Useless without the pad. Exacting if you had it.

*Click. Click.*

The noise came through faintly on Mark’s end. Keyboard taps. Processing.

I imagined someone listening the way I was now, years earlier. Headphones on. Door shut. Waiting for the right moment to press record. Not trying to capture rain. Trying to capture what rode inside it.

“Okay,” Mark said, finally. “I ran a differential pass. And that’s… not noise.”

My grip tightened on the phone. “What is it?”

“It’s structured,” he said. “The pops cluster. The gaps repeat.” More typing. “I’m mapping it as binary.”

The rain clicked softly in my ears, like it was listening.

“Hold on,” Mark said. “This is spitting something out.”

“What kind of something?”

“Numbers,” he said. “Grouped. Consistent lengths.” Another pause, longer this time. “I ran another track. Same length. I think each one’s a timestamp.”

I felt a chill move through my shoulders.

“Yeah. UTC. Date and time.” He inhaled sharply. “And it’s followed by coordinates.”

I stood up without realizing it. “Where?”

“The coordinates are relatively close to each other. The times are all within a month of each other,” he said. “Let me make sure I’m not forcing this.” Keys clacked faster now.

The screen flickered back on. Mark looked pale, almost pleased.

“Marshall Islands,” he said. “Near Jaluit.”

I did not know that name. Too far away to matter to me.

“Okay,” I said. “What’s in Jaluit?”

“Give me a second,” he said, already pulling up another window. “There was a rain composition study out there a few years back. NOAA-adjacent. Small sample size.” He scrolled. Stopped.

“Found it.”

“And?”

“It was flagged and discarded,” he said. “They thought the sample was contaminated. Rainwater showed an abnormal microbiome.”

I waited.

“They described the rain as amber,” he added. “Slightly viscous. Left residue on collection equipment.”

The clicks in my headphones felt closer now. Not louder. Closer.

“They wrote it off as an error,” Mark said. “Bad collection. Faulty gear. Nobody followed up.”

“Except someone did?” I asked.

Mark shrugged. “Or someone else was already recording out there.”
