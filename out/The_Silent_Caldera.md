Part 1

There's nothing better than some greasy sausage and scrambled eggs after a night of 
hanging out with Jack Daniel's. "Fuuuck, that's good." I mumble between bites. Apparently 
not as quiet as I thought.

"God Dammit, Drew, don't talk like that," my mom says from across the table. Her mouth is 
usually just as dirty, but for some reason draws the line with that one word. For someone 
that claims to be as free spirited as her kid, she really comes to weird standards.

"Big guy using big words," laughs my dad. "Where was he last night? Off celebrating big 
man's achievements or did you finally get a girl to 'shag' you as a Brit would say? 
Hahahaha!" 

My dad can come off across as a prick to a lot of people due to his abrasive personality, he 
just likes to test people, especially me. Dad is really like Santa if he was with the Hells 
Angels, just with less meth. His laugh sounds just like you'd imagine. Today, it sounded like 
a migraine.

"I was just out with a few of the guys. Listened to music and played some video games. 
Nothing crazy."

And like a bullhorn,"Buuullshit! I know that look. I know your mom's seen it plenty of times. 
Where'd you get liquor, boy? I ain't mad, mostly disappointed you didn't let your old man 
have a swig with yah." 

I learned today a hangover is a hell of a lot harder to hide than my dad made it seem. 
Seasoned veteran against a rookie. Can you blame me though? First in my family to be 
accepted in a university. How else could an eighteen-year-old celebrate other than 
smoking ditch weed and downing a bottle of whiskey your friend stole from their parents?

"I bet you wish Pete was here to celebrate with you. Have you heard from him lately? How 
far is he now?" My mother's typical maternal wonder showing. 

"I haven't heard from him in maybe 2 months. Last I heard from him, he said he was about 
to sail to Indonesia from China."

I’m sure that shithead is having an even better time than I did last night. I’ve known Pete 
since first grade, and with all the hippies shit we’ve been into, of course he would take the 
first opportunity to go on one of those cliché "trips around the world to find yourself, man". 
I don't blame him since all we've seen growing up are Oregon forests and lakes.

I had to stay behind to do what I thought a big boy would. Missing out on a trip like that so I 
could get into a university quick. Boy, am I kicking my own ass now.

"Damn, that's quite a while. I bet he's having a hell of a time there." Dad says through 
chewed meat.

"C’mon Dale, gross. Swallow then talk.” Mom glares at Dad. “It would be nice for us to 
have a family vacation." My mom says 

Ignoring my mom he asks," What was he going to visit in Indonesia?"

"He said there was some temple in Yogyakarta he was going to check out, maybe see the 
Komodo Dragons on their island. There's plenty of hiking, who knows."

My dad nodding in fake understanding, "Cool, cool. Hope the kid makes it home okay." 

Pete spent so much of his time at my house growing up he basically became another part 
of our home. My parents sometimes made me feel like he was more their kid than me.

The rest of breakfast was standard. After I finished my breakfast, I went to my room to 
relax the rest of my hangover away.

The next morning, late morning, my mom woke me up," Drew, Pete's called! He wants to 
talk to you. He sounds super excited."
I sat up quick at the mention of Pete. "Alright, I'll be right there."

Heading to the living room, I pick up the land line. First thing I hear is almost a light 
moaning. Like anticipation on the verge of agony.

 "Uh, Pete." 

"Hey! What's up Drew! Bro, I’m sorry it's been a while since we talked." I don't know what 
that was, but almost the moment my voice cut in so did Pete. "Holy shit, dude. You would 
never believe the kind of stuff they have here in Indonesia." 

"Did you hear that? What the hell?"

"The lines do that sometimes. I heard it a few times just calling for a ride."

"Oh, okay." Weird, but Pete would know more than me. "How's it over there, man? I bet 
you've been up to crazy shit? 

Pete gave me a rundown on his arrival to Indonesia. It feels like I can barely keep up as he 
is telling me about the sights he saw or the people he met in light detail. Our conversation 
seemed to slow abruptly once he hit Bali one month after we had last talked.

"Drew, when I tell you, my next stop was beauty of biblical proportions. I imagine it had the 
same terrifying yet prepossessing power those ring angels had in the Bible. I felt real 'DO 
NOT BE AFRAID' energy, you know? Hahaha." 

Whoa "prepossessing"? That's a big word for the likes of Pete. Maybe, its beauty was so 
impressive it helped him spiritually and intellectually.

Pete heard of this inactive volcano from another tourist he met at a hostel, that described had
"mystical" energy about it. I could do nothing to get Pete to stop describing every feeling he 
had at each site of the one location. He explained that it took him so long to contact me 
due to them camping at the peak for weeks.

Woah, that is the longest Pete had stayed in one spot the entirety of his trip, and he has 
told me of some amazing things he’s come across already. This must have been a life 
changing place for him.

“The locals call it Pembersihan Surgawi which translates to ‘Heavenly Cleanse’. Brother, I 
didn’t call just to explain my journey like all the other times. I know you had reasons to stay 
behind, but if there was anyone in the world I know would be the best to enjoy this with, 
would be you. I wish you came with me like we planned.” Pete’s tone the calmest I have 
ever heard coming from him.

“I don’t know man, it just happened so I haven’t told you yet, but I got accepted to 
Sacramento State and you know how badly I want to study Zoology to travel my whole life 
saving animals.” 

Petes voice scratches into a slightly deeper monotone,” You will regret, Andrew.”

Woah, Peter knows not even my own parents call me by Andrew. “Shit man, is it as
spectacular as you make it, or are you just filled with childlike wonder like usual?”

His cheerful tone back,” Nah man, it’s seriously too crazy to believe without seeing 
yourself. You should have time before your classes start right?”

“Yeah, that’s not the problem. I need to junk my car and buy a new one.”

“If money is the only issue, I had some extra cash stored away in my room. Fat stack hiding 
in my dresser. If you dare to brave my loaded sock drawer, it should have enough to get you 
here.”

“How the hell did you get all this money?” 

“Don’t worry about that little bro, Pete gets his cheddar.” 

I roll my eyes at Pete being corny as usual. To be fair, Pete was resourceful in high school. 
He may not have been the smartest, but he always knew he could dig up some wild ganga 
and the kids at school would never tell from the good stuff.

“Alright man, guess there’s no way out of this, huh?” I say defeated yet excited.

“None that I can see. Hahaha!”

“Alright, once I convince my mom a grown ass man can go to Indonesia, I’ll swing by your 
place to get the cash. Where should I meet you?
”
“Bitchin’, fly into Bali. I’ll meet you there. I can't wait to see you man.”

“Me too, later brother.”

I don’t know if it was the neutral tone from the line, but I swear right before I put the phone 
on the receiver, I heard a quick switch from quiet to a raged scream from the other end. 

I put the phone back up to my ear, “Pete?”

Nothing

Weird, what’s going on with the phones in Indonesia?

Part 2

It didn’t take much to convince my dad I was going to Asia, you know, be your own man 
shit. My mom on the other hand was a bit more difficult. I was going regardless, but I would 
rather widdle her down than make her worry. I am her only son.

Once I got a couple small bags packed and my passport, I started on my way to Petes 
house. Hopefully he has enough to cover the flight and I’m not about to have to pay most of 
it out of my own pocket. I can’t leave him hanging, especially since I don’t know where he 
called from, uh oh. 

Petes mom is very kind, she is an exact opposite of Pete and always tries to baby the poor 
guy. I guess we are one in the same there. She lets me into his room, and I dig through his 
sock drawer to find a solid stack of bills. Damn Pete, busy season before graduation, I
guess. I count six hundred dollars. This must cover at least a one-way trip, he’ll have to 
smuggle me back or I’m taking his ticket home.

Luckily, I was able to get a cheap ticket to Indonesia. Some poor guy lost his lunch on the 
way and had to cancel. His loss. The flight was a little sketchy, but after the longest 22 
hours of my life I finally made it to Bali. Flying overhead I got a good view of all the beauty of 
the jungle with far off volcanoes on the horizon.

Leaving the plane, I had to take a wicked pisser, but I didn’t see Pete anywhere. Who knows 
how far he's coming from, or we will be traveling so I might as well use a restroom while I 
can.

God, this bathroom is dingy and smells horrible. Am I that jaded by American standard? Oh 
well, it only seems like one stall is in use. It's strange though, as I approach the piss trough 
across from the only stall in use, I hear a strange noise from the stall. It's obviously rude to 
listen on people while they take a dumper, but this is sounding like the man is in pain. 
Almost a reserved grunting of disapproval. I shake it off and stand to piss, and I hear the 
grunting build. First to a pained hum, then to a slight holler. This is freaking me out; I need 
to piss and leave. While the commotion behind me is growing I finish and skip washing my 
hands and by the time I am walking out they seem to be screaming and trashing around in 
the stall. I don’t know what that man was on, but the Indonesian drugs must be insane.

Shaking off the eerie feeling that man left me with, it's time to find Pete. The humidity in the 
air is making my skin feel as if I was dipped in honey almost immediately as I stepped out of 
the airport. Trying to acclimate myself to the climate difference I scan around looking for 
Pete.

“Damn, Pete. You said you were in Bali, you should have beat me here.” I mumble to 
myself in frustration. 

Unable to become used to the heat and wet air as quickly as I’d like, I find a corner of the 
building to set my stuff down and relax. The exhaustion of the trip finally kicking in.
Only a few minutes later, Pete walks out of the entrance of the airport in a hurry, sweatier
than I. He quickly scans as I did, I can only assume to find me. 

“Yo, Pete!” I shout to grab his attention. 

The moment he notices me; he switches from urgent to his usual calm demeanor. He 
strolls up to me who’s still resting in the shade.
Pete’s never been the most clean-cut guy, but six months traveling through Asia really 
makes you look it. His long red hair is so tangled and dirty you’d believe he had dreads, the 
clothes on him look like they were caked in clay or red dirt, and the smell. There must be 
something bad with Indonesian showers because this guy was dodging them.

“Hey bro, can’t believe you’re actually here I must have missed your landing.” Pete said 
while approaching with his arms open for a hug.

“Yeah man, it's crazy to think I get to do this with you.” I respond slowly standing. 

Before I was all the way up, and with no warning, Pete was hugging me so tight it squeezed 
the air out of me. 

Squeaking I barely get out,” G-goddamn, Pete. How’d you get so strong?”

Pete chuckles,” Organic living, brother!” before letting me go.

“That might be the lamest thing you’ve said.” I laugh

“I’ve missed your ass."

“Likewise, brother. Hey man, can we go? I’m ready to get out of here, someone in the 
bathroom gave me some bad energy.” I say grabbing my bags.

“Oh, really? I was just in there and I didn’t notice anyone?” Pete says looking confused.

“Huh? You were in the bathroom? We must have just missed each other.” 

Pete perks up, "Hey forget about that, let’s get going.”

Thankfully his rented car was close by. I couldn’t stand to be in this air any longer. We get 
in and as Pete turns the key I feel the sweet kiss of conditioned air. My god, do you take 
simple things for granted.

As the car is leaving the parking lot of the airport, Pete immediately jumps on the topic of 
the volcano. “Man, I can't wait any longer to see this with you man. Believe me when I say, 
not only is the view greater than any imagined wonder, but there’s a lake within the crater 
that will change you, man. As soon as we get there- “

I cut Pete off, “We’re not going straight there are we? That flight was a draining twenty-plus 
hours. I can’t wait for this experience too, but there’s nothing I would rather do than crash. 
Is there somewhere decent you’ve been staying?” 

I look from the windows to Pete, and he is staring straight at me, white knuckling the 
steering wheel, wide eyed, and grinding his teeth. I think I see him trembling, what the hell?

He's not responding so I prod him,” Hey, Pete.”

Almost as if a momentary glitch, Pete smiles like he’s back to normal. “Oh, yeah. No 
problem, man. I know exactly where to go, and it's pretty close to the base of the volcano. 
No hiking required, yet.”

I give Pete a confused look,” You okay man?”
Pete now looking at the road, “Yeah, it's been a long trip.”

Part 3

The drive was only thirty minutes but felt even longer. I don’t know what I did to piss of 
Pete. Did he expect us to hike right away? That’s expecting way too much. He’s sweating 
like crazy, and the cars A/C is about to freeze me out. Nah, he’ll get over it, and we will go 
first thing in the morning. 

Driving through a small town that seems to be abandoned, we pull up to a hostel that's 
much closer to the volcano than I thought, Pete breaks the silence and explains to me that 
this I where he met the other guy that told him of the Caldera. 

“Guy was super cool, really introduced me to the magic of this place. I didn’t need much 
convincing after his description.”

“From down here I can already start believing that.” I say looking at the peak from the 
window. “Why are there not more people that live around here? You would think they 
would make a place like this more inviting for tourists.”

“There were a few accidents with some of the locals a long ass time ago, but I don’t know 
the whole story.”

The car slowly pulls to a stop in front of a shack on the verge of a small house, “Well, here 
we are. The guys are nice, you’ll mix with them easy. A couple of new guys showed up right 
before I left so I didn’t have a chance to meet them. Most people you meet in Hostels are 
usually chill so I’m sure they are too.”

Looking at the worn house, it feels unlikely to be a hostel. “Theres no way this is actually a 
hostel.”

Pete dismisses me,“Bah, a hostel is just a place where you can lay your head with foreign strangers right? C’mon let's go introduce you to the guys”

Without the energy to fight Petes logic I sigh, ready to head straight to bed, “Alright, can't
wait to meet everyone.”

Pete’s always been the social butterfly between us.

Walking up to the door, bags in my arms, we can already hear music coming from inside.
Beating on Deaths Door by Lamb of God. I know Pete left with a few of his favorite albums 
to “share a taste of him” with the broader world. I guess he decided to share Sacrament 
this time.

Before opening the door, he turns to me with a smirk. “I left them with Mastodon's
Leviathan. These guys must have liked Sacrament enough to dig through my bag.” 

I shrug back, “Not a bad choice.”

Pete opens the door to lead me in and scanning the room it's not a very impressive room. 
Lucky for me, I don’t require a whole lot. Mostly made for living space, the main room was 
filled with four bunk beds a table and four chairs. The door to the bathroom was open and 
thankfully it seems big enough that multiple people can be comfortable doing what they 
need to. 

Sitting at the table were three guys enjoying beer and jamming to the music Pete left. Two 
of them had long tied up hair and looked as dirty as Pete, and the third was a clean-cut 
blonde guy in hiking clothes you’d see a preppy dude wear in an outdoors magazine. He 
was nodding his head way off time with the music but looked genuinely happy to be there. I 
almost didn’t notice there was another person laying on the top bunk of one of the beds. It 
looks as if he was more into writing in his journal than drinking brews and music. I 
notice he looks almost exactly like the other blonde gentleman at the table. Huh, twins. 
Thats cool.

One of the guys sitting at the table noticed the two of us and turns the music down. “Oi! 
Petes back with his little buddy.” I immediately noticed the thick British accent. 

“Aye, perfect timing bruv. We’re trying to see how many beers it takes to send Gabriel off to 
sleep. Hahaha!" Another thick British accent comes from the other side of the table. “This man is a tough bastard though. That German stereotype is all too true that they can hold their booze.”

The twin at the table begins to laugh, “This sheisse is very weak. No worry for any hangover.”

Pete chimes in, “Drew, do you want a beer? Then we can get you properly introduced.”

“Shit why not,” I say throwing my bags to the bottom bunk next to the door. 

I walk over to the table as one of the British men hand me a beer. I sit down at the last open 
chair next to him, crack it open and take a sip. My god, warm beer? I pretend not to choke 
on the taste of piss, but I can’t make Pete look bad hanging with a lame ass. Nobody else 
seems to mind, so I keep drinking. 

Pete sits halfway on the head of the table, “Guys, I’d like you to meet Drew. I’ve known him 
most of my life and don’t think of anyone better to take to the Caldera with me.” The two
British men hold up their beers to that while the German sips his beer, seemingly neutral to
the room.

Pete points to the man next to me,” This hunk of joy is Ed and the other obviously British
guy is Nicolas. I haven’t had the chance to meet these two new souls that's joined us 
tonight.” 

Ed jumps almost choking on his beer, “Shit yeah. I already said this bloke here is Gabriel, 
real party animal he is, and that sour puss up there is Nathaniel. Apparently, they are here 
to explore the jungles and shit but not like us.”

Gabriel chimes in, "We are here to log and chart the jungle.”

“Haven’t they already done that?” I ask taking another small sip. 

“Ja, but this is more of a hobby. We wish to explore the Amazon, but my bruder ist pussy. 
As you can see, he is not life of party like me.” He leans into the table obviously buzzing 
now, "He ist mute.”

Nathaniel sits up and starts signing something to Gabriel,” Ja I know you can hear me. 
Thats why I say it. Hahaha!”

Pete jumps in,” Will you guys go up to the Pembersihan Surgawi with us? It will give you an awakening you will need before you guys journey any farther.” 

“Nein, we only have so much time before we fly home.”

Its Ed’s turn to push, “Aww c’mon, you boys can spare one day. It’s really a life changing 
experience.”

“Believe me, I would be kicking myself right now if I didn’t listen to Ed here and moved on 
like I was planning.” Petes is the most serious yet somber he has ever been. He’s never 
usually this pushy when someone says no. “This volcano has been everything to me since 
he took me up to that peak, and I just want to share its glory with everyone who has the 
opportunity. Doesn’t that sound good to you?”

Gabriel thinks for a moment, Pete is being very persuasive but after a moment he makes 
his choice, “Nein, Nathaniel is an ass about sticking to schedule. Maybe we come back 
when we travel again.”

The tables mood seems to have altered just from a simple denial. Ed is staring widely 
directly at Gabriel, gripping his can to the point of crushing while Nicolas has turned his 
head and is glaring at Nathaniel. Both men seem to be shaking now. What's happening? 
They don’t seem like that these two strangers want to go their own way, why the hell do 
they care so much?

Pete isn’t doing much but now he isn’t half sitting on the table, he is standing with his arms 
to the side. Is Pete upset too? He just met these guys, why should he care if they come with 
us for this “life changing experience”?

Not sure if Gabriel is as creeped out as I am or if the beer finally hit him. He stands
unsteadily and puts his hand on his chest. “We do have to wake early, so I do hope I see 
you boys in the morning. If not, it was nice speaking with you all. Gute Nacht.”

Gabriel leaves the table and lays down on his bed, not worried to change while Eds eyes 
are still locked on him. Nicolas has not changed, and it hasn’t occurred to Nathaniel he 
was even being watched as he also rolled over and went to sleep.

“Is everything alright?” I quietly ask Pete who's still looking at where Gabriel was sitting.

He quickly snaps his head to me,” Yeah man, it's all good. The boys here just get a little 
bummed when people deny a good time.”

“Okay, I guess I get that.” 

I’m still not sure about that. These guys are starting to throw me off. I’ll make sure I stick 
with Pete until we leave.

“You’re still going, right?”Petes question caught me off guard.

“Yeah, that's the whole reason I flew for almost an entire day. Might as well make it worth 
it.”

Pete laughs,” Awesome, well it's been a long day for you, and we are going to be up pretty 
early like them. You should go get some sleep, hopefully you sleep like a rock. I know I 
will.”

I get up and find the bed I threw my bags on. I get comfortable and start rolling the 
interaction at the table in my head. How could the energy have changed that drastically. 
Before I could think any more on the topic, by brain shuts itself off. Exhaustion got the 
better of me.

Part 4

Never had I been in a deeper sleep, not even my night with Jack, but I think even in a coma I 
would have been jerked awake. A sudden blood curdling screech hit me in my dream but 
pulled me conscious. I’m facing the wall, so I roll onto my other side to see if anyone else 
reacted or if it really was just my dream. 

The bathroom light is on, maybe someone had to piss and kicked a chair. That makes 
sense, but as I close my eyes trying to slip back to sleep, I hear a whimper. I open my eyes 
again, maybe they really hurt themself. I’m no stranger to a sore toe. Then I hear a new 
noise, more of a humming, and there's something else. Is that crying? What the hell is 
going on in there?

I sit up to see who’s missing from their bed. I check the Germans and both bunks are 
empty, do the twins have a piss schedule too? 
The crying and humming are continuing. One of them sound like they really hurt themself 
and I should probably see if they need any help. I slowly sit up, rub my eyes, and stand. 

Then it catches my eye. The other set of beds are empty. Are the Brits up too? I turn around 
and see that Pete is sleeping away like a bomb wouldn’t wake him.

I turn back to the bathroom and slowly walk to the door. I listen and sure enough I can hear
crying and rhythmic humming. My hand almost reaches the doorknob, and I hear the cry 
quickly change to a shattering scream just before it muffles. I quickly throw the door open 
unaware of what was happening.

I need to wake up, this is a dream, right? Red filled my eyes, from floor to ceiling, red. I’m 
dreaming crimson. My disbelief held as my eyes drink in the sight of a man whose hands 
are tied to a rod for the shower curtain. The life draining from his body as I see Ed glide a 
knife down the middle of his chest to his abdomen. Gabriel spasms as Ed reaches under 
his ribs and rips his heart with no resistance. Shock takes over me as he squeezes Gabriels 
freed heart over his head, showering in his blood. 

Something in the tub catches my eyes. Its Nathaniel, lifeless, with an almost identical 
procedure done to him. I realize Nicolas is to my right holding another heart tight in his fist, 
his head and shoulders scarlet. 

My heart is beating out of my chest. How could Pete have been with these men for this 
long? Why did they do this to these poor brothers?

“They refused to be cleansed.” A monotone voice I recognize behind me. ”If you can’t wash 
away your sins, it can always be removed like a tumor.”

No...

Trembling I slowly turn around to face Pete, gazing into my eyes with a stern look of 
indifference.

“We purify them, and they cleanse us. Now their souls are beautiful.”

My disbelief is beginning to drown in fear. This can’t be Pete. This isn’t my brother. It can’t 
be. 

I finally bring myself to speak, “Why Pete? Why bring me out here? Are you going to do this 
to me?”

“No, there is a better way to purify yourself, you only need to say yes.”

Anger overtaking me I can’t help but to yell, “WHY THE HELL WOULD I SAY YES! THIS IS 
INSANE PETE!”

“Andrew, you are my brother, I wish for us to remain cleansed, and together purify. You will 
learn that impurity pains, and pain angers”

“Fuck no, Pete.”

“I hoped you would have made the choice yourself, especially seeing what the poor twins 
had to endure. But if you’re so sure-” Pete leans in very close, our noses almost touching, 
“We can always carry you.”

Almost on cue, one of the men grabs me from behind, his arms round my waist and picks 
me up.

“What the fuck?! Let me go!” I yell, unable to fight his grip. 

Carrying me to one of the chairs I fight but make no progress. He puts me down in the 
chair, holding all his weight on me so I can't get up. Nicolas quickly gets to my legs as I 
begin kicking to hold them out straight. 

“Wait, what are you doing? What the fuck!”

Pete is now standing in front of me.

“This will be worth it Andrew, trust me brother.”
And before I could say anything, Pete lifts his leg and drops his heel down on my kneecap 
inverting my leg completely.

“AAAHHHH FUUUUCK”

I feel every tendon tear as the connection between my bones sever. Blinding pain 
swimming in my head. I can’t think straight. Ed releases me to nurse my overly jointed leg. 

Falling from the chair, I cry. How could this happen? What happened to Pete? What is so 
life changing that he would do this, and for what, a fucking view? The pain and shock from 
what I have experienced is too much for my psyche, I black out.

I wake up outside, bobbing, pain shooting up my left leg from toe to thigh. Only thing in view
is a back, legs and rock. I’m being carried. I lift my head and notice we are climbing the 
volcanos face. Looking to the left I see Ed beside me and my mule, still covered in blood.
The psycho is smiling, not a crazed smile, but one of joy.

He looks over and notices I’m awake, “Hey bro, you slept through the trip up. If you didn’t 
wake soon, we were going to have to make you.”

With no warning, I am slung over the shoulder, fast then slow enough to catch myself on 
my good leg, the pain from the crippled one hits me even harder. I can’t help but to fall. 

“Ahhh fuck! You guys ruin my leg then take me to the top of a volcano?! Pete, how can this 
be any better than just killing me in the bathroom?”

Pete isn’t even looking at me, the other two men match his gaze. They are staring up the 
behind me. Pete points towards forward, “Pembersihan Surgawi that's why.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?!”

Nicolas quickly walks to me and turns my head almost too quickly. What I see almost 
makes me forget my dislocated kneecap. 
What looks like a bowl of earth is being lifted into heaven, and within the bowl is a body of 
water that takes up most of the crater. Its mesmerizing, the dynamic contrast from the 
golden clouds of dawn to the deep blue water within this hole. As I look at the wonder, the 
awe begins to wear out as does any beauty. 

I shout, “Okay, so let's get this straight. You murder two innocent men for denying coming 
up here and destroy my leg, so I have no choice. For what? A pretty view? I don’t feel my
view on life changing!”

“We’re not finished” Pete says. I look up and he’s smiling over me.

He hoists me over his shoulder again. The rough movement makes me scream. I continue
from the rocky movement as Pete carries me over the threshold into the crater. Then, 
silence. I scream and scream from the pain, but nothing. Feeling the air leave my lungs 
with enough force, and yet, still silence. 
It catches me off balance and distracts me of my pain. Silence is beautiful, just as much as 
our surroundings. We are approaching the water, and I remain stunned. Even as questions 
roll in my head.

Pete sets me down once again as he did before, in what feels like an attempt to be gentle. I 
can remain standing this time. I look at Pete and notice he his signalling something, an 
attempt to have me do something. Is he asking me to undress? I give him a confused look 
which appears to annoy Ed. Quickly, he grabs my shirt at my waist and yanks it over my 
head aggressively then points at my pants. What the hell? They want me to strip, for what? 
Pete attempts to signal again, but Ed and Nicolas grab me and begin to yank my pants 
down. They don’t care about the pain as I quietly scream. Before I can react, I am lifted by 
four arms and thrown. 

My body hits water and I submerge. I try to rise, but the surface won't allow it. I see the
radiant sky through an indigo filter. No matter how hard I push up, I can’t reach it. Then I
begin to drop. Kicking my one good leg, I am sinking. It keeps pulling me down, deeper and 
deeper. The cold yet comforting water relaxes every muscle in my body. As my flesh 
loosens, I feel my skin begin to tingle. Sensations of pleasure and anguish envelope me like 
a flame. I’m being molded, mixed in a proverbial pot, into something else. Internally and 
spiritually. It’s everything I’ve ever hoped for, yet the worst experience of a nightmare. I 
keep hoping to wake but sink further. Then I stop, on the brink of slipping into insanity 
brought on by ecstasy. I am perfect. Cleansed of my sins. I am with the water, and that's
when I begin to rise. Slowly and yet too fast. I hope it stops. Please don’t make me leave. I 
need to stay. How could I remain pure if I leave?

I fight as a hand grabs my wrist that pulls me from the water. I begin to cry and turn to go 
back to the water, but I can’t. Urgency to return is blocked by something unknown. I don’t 
understand, I need to be with the water, but I feel something in the back of my 
subconscious refuse. Please let me return, I can feel the impurity of the world crashing on 
my shoulders, and it hurts. 

Pete grabs my hand and begins to force me back the way we came. I am so focused on the 
water I don’t notice I am walking perfectly. We make it over the threshold, and it is loud. 
Crunching gravel and the wind. You don’t realize how loud sound is until it is forced on you. 

Tears running, I look at Pete,” Why do I feel this way?”

“Sin, Drew. The water awakens you to it so you may purge it.”

“How do I stop this?”

“Purify those you can like you and the twins. Only then will you feel its embrace again”

“I need to make it stop, this pain.”

“Then who do you know needs it purity the most.”

I think for a minute, and then it hits me.

 Mother did always want a family vacation.
