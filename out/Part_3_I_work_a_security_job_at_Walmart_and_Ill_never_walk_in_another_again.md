Its been a while since my last post. I'm not going to get too much into the details of what's been happening recently, but I fear that it has something to do with these posts I'm making. Let's get back to the story. It gets intense here.

After a couple of minutes of pathetic grueling on the ground, I stood up, wiping the tears from my eyes. Soon afterwards, two familiar cars parked in the parking lot. Of course, this would be Carson and that freaky woman in the suit I never learned the name of. She got out of her car first, walking towards me with that smile still on her face.

"Good mornin-"

But before she could finish her sentence, I spoke up, interrupting her.

"I quit."

"W-What?"

I clenched my fists, feeling my anger grow.

"I SAID, FUCK YOU. I QUIT!!!!"

I walked through her, shoving her to the side. I took off my security jacket and hat, throwing it on the ground in rage. Carson got out of his car soon after, making his way towards me. He held out his hand, presumably asking to be given the tape. I gave it to him, after all that's what I came here for. He placed it in his pocket and put his hand on my shoulder.

"You did good. You deserve a break."

I walked past him in silence, deep in thought. So deep in thought, that I would leave my electric scooter behind and just walk the way back home. The only thing on my mind being going back home to Shanks. After, God knows how long of walking with my head down, I eventually made it home. I threw myself onto my bed, hoping to sleep my sorrows away. But sleep wouldn't come, not with all the horrors I've experienced. So unable to find sleep, I got up to find something to do instead of laying in bed and crying about it. I called for Shanks, but he didn't come. I assumed he was most likely sleep and didn't bother him, seeing as he wouldn't wake up to most sounds anyways. Then, I just recalled the cameras I had set up back at the Walmart. I'm an idiot for leaving them but the footage should have been sent to my phone once it stopped recording.

I went into the files, and there they were, three separate files of footage. Had no idea where the other footage was, but I chalked them up to just the cameras not uploading properly after the nonsense at 2:00. I checked the first footage, which was the one I set up at the entrance. In the top right corner, it displayed the time and date. Nothing happens in the first couple of minutes until suddenly, I can just barely see a frame of the moon stretching before seeing that faint image of flashing colors and shapes now clearized. The shapes that would spontaneously show up stretched infinitely in all directions and points. Then, I don't really understand what happened next. All of a second, the camera was showing what I could only perceive as random locations across the world. Not outside of the Walmart, but as if the camera was actually at those places. It was happening too fast for me to note any remarkable places. What I can barely piece together from this rather random event, was that my camera was somehow being transported from all over the world in the fraction of a second.

And it wasn't just stopping at transporting there. At times, the locations would get dramatically smaller or bigger. At other times, it would be at locations I've never seen or heard about. Something that was a part of our world but was distorted thoroughly, a sense of familiarity seeing but knowing this wasn't the same place, something was wrong. Nostalgia I guess you can say. In the top right corner, the time and date was constantly changing, a common factor between electronics. But then, it would just stop. As in, the recording would stop abruptly with a single millisecond of some loud sound being played. I couldn't help but be startled. Not just because of what was happening in the video, but because I no longer felt safe in my home. It feels like I had brought that madness and nightmare back into my own home.

I wiped the cold sweat from my forehead, shaking my head in some attempt to calm myself down. It was time to view the second recording. I played it and waited a couple of seconds for something to happen. Soon, the camera suddenly began shaking as I can faintly see the flashing lights of colors and shapes once again. However, the recording was abruptly cut as the shaking had knocked the camera off and sent it twirling towards the ground. And well, that would lead on to the next recording.

Like the other two, the footage starts off with nothing but silence for a couple of minutes or seconds before the random flashing lights of shapes and color appeared once again however. Similarly to the second footage, this camera would end up falling from the excessive shaking and was hurling towards the ground. But just when I thought the footage was going to cut, the screen went to static for a split second before the camera dropped comfortably in some sort of cushion. It was no longer in the Walmart. In fact, it was transported somewhere I could easily recognize.

My house. This was my house.

Using the video as a comparison, I could clearly see it had landed in my bed. But when I got to look for it, it wasn't there. I checked my files again, and this time, there was a new file of footage. Which should have been nearly impossible. My hand shaking, I hesitantly played the footage against my better curiosity. The video played where it left off previously, in my bed. Off screen, I could hear the sounds of shuffling, which I assumed had to be Shanks. But then, my heart would drop in my chest as I see the camera being picked up by an unknown person. The person would then bring the camera into the bathroom and set it up, peering at an angle just right enough to where you could see the living room. Nothing would happen for a couple of minutes and the footage seemed to be longer than the most, so I just decided to skip through it.

I skip through it about an hour or so when I would hear the sounds of my front door clicking and unlocking. I could feel my heart drop into my stomach as I can clearly hear the sound of my voice coming from my room.

"Shanks! I'm home!"

The footage would continue playing and after a while, I could clearly see myself sitting in the living room. My body was trembling at this point as I placed my phone down, not wanting to view the rest of the footage. I turned towards the room of my door out to the living room. That intruder had to still be there, just waiting around the corner for me to show up again. Hesitantly, I slowly walked out into the living room, my heart thumping in my chest. I turned towards the bathroom, my eye just barely catching a figure retreat into the bathroom. Their movement was awkward, almost as if they were leaning most of their body on the side before turning upright. My fight or flight instincts kicked in and I ran to my room, closing the door and locking it behind me. I began dialing 911, constantly looking towards the door in fear that whatever who was there would break the door down.

"911, who is it?"

"Y-Yes! H-Hello, I-I need-" I tried to get the words out but I found it difficult to do so.

*"Sir, calm down and explain the situation to me."*

I took a deep breath in, trying to compose myself once more. 

I cleared my throat and whispered in a hushed tone, "O-Okay...I-I think there's someone in my house."

*"Okay sir, stay calm and move somewhere safe. State your address please?"*

I looked back at the door before placing the phone closer to my face, trying to make sure I wasn't being too loud.

"S-Sure thing! My address is ####, and I live on ####"

*"Okay sir, the police have been dispatched to your location and will be arriving soon."*

I let out a sigh of relief as I smiled weakly.

"T-Thank you-"

But before I could finish my sentence, the voice on the phone spoke up again, and I noticed that they sounded a bit different than from before.

*"Is the intruder in the room with you?"*

"W-What?"

I was confused on why they would ask this. Clearly, they wasn't in the room with me. When I turned back to the door however, I froze, my entire being filling with pure dread. The door was slightly opened, just enough that its head could poke out and peer at me from the crack. All without a sound. I could now identify some of its features. It was barely human-like. Two black eyes without pupils that seemed bottomless, adorned with a pale white face without a mouth or nose. The rest of its body was enveloped in a dark black, almost seeming unreal as the light didn't bounce off of him. The voice on the phone repeated itself again, as this thing spoke.

***"Is the intruder in the room with you?"***
*"Is the intruder in the room with you?"*

Instantly, I dropped my phone and ran towards my bathroom, hurriedly locking myself in. As I did so, I could hear the voice on the phone was now hysterically laughing as the sounds of feet slapping against the ground got louder. That thing out there began banging on the door, a red ominous light suddenly basking my house in its terrifying glory. Black hands began reaching out to me from the cracks, scratching the door and walls in a terrible symphony. I frantically looked around for something, anything that could help me escape or at least fight back. Then, my eyes turned to the bathroom window and I quickly began trying to open it to get outside. The banging and the laughing progressively got louder, until I was finally able to open the window in my fumbling state and began running out into the empty streets.

As I ran for my life, the streets became basked in that red light and the sky became dark. I turned around, looking at my house as it burst into spiders that relentlessly began chasing after me. I ran as fast as I could even while my legs were starting to give up. But just then, I could hear the sounds of police sirens in front of me and within a few moments, a cop car had appeared. I was so glad to see them, as I immediately ran up to their window.

"O-Officer, you have to help me! I'm being-"

But before I could finish my sentence, I was interrupted as the cop spoke up, turning towards me. It didn't have an face.

*"Woah partner, you look like you're having a terrible **nightmare.**"* It laughed.

I turned back towards the wave of spider that were now only a few feet in front of me. I had lost my will to run, opening my mouth to scream as the spiders made contact with me. But then, they suddenly disappeared, just like that. I looked around, my body trembling and shaking with each motion. Everything was back to normal. The streets weren't basked in that red light anymore and my house seemed to be completely fine. I could feel tears begin to well up as I looked down at my shaking head, breathing heavily. I didn't have anything to say. And for a while, I just stood there, so disoriented from what just happened. A ringing sound filled my ears before it faded away to the loud dound of a car honking.

I turned around, recognizing a familiar car. It was Carson's car. He stepped out of the car, taking a few steps towards me.

"What's the matter with you?"

I took a deep breath, hesitating to speak for a moment.

"I-I need to go somewhere man..."

"Where to?"

"Just...anywhere that's not here."

He nodded, gesturing for me to get in, which I did so gladly.

"I know a good bar that's not too far from here." He slightly turned his head back to look at me from the corner of his eye.

I nodded in response. I was hopeful that drinking would calm me down and help me forget these terrible things that happened. The car accelerated with a slight shake as I looked out the window back to my home. It didn't feel like home anymore. One way or another, you could say that I lost my house. Carson turned on the radio, tuning into some random podcast from this **conspiracy theorist.** Nothing too much to note though. Just the usual ramblings of aliens and how the moon was alive. Though, I would find it way much more believable with all the crazy shit thats happened. Conspiracy theorists sounded a lot less crazier to me when you meet terrifying creatures beyond understanding. And now, I can't help but believe some of them might actually have encountered these paranormal entities. Back to the story.

After about 30 minutes of driving, the car would come to a halt. Looking outside the window, I could see that we had reached our destination, parked opposite from the bar across the street. I got out a couple of seconds after Carson did, following him into the bar. The bar boasted a worn, mahogany counter with a collection of stools. Shelves behind it showcased an array of liquor bottles neatly organized. Above us, dim pendant lights hang low, illuminating the polished surface of the counter. The walls were adorned with various  vintage poster. Wooden tables and chairs filled the open space, bearing the scars of countless spilled drinks and animated conversations. Didn't look so far off from some of the movies I've watched.

I sat down as Carson did, holding my head down deep in thought. Carson meanwhile ordered us both a drink before nudging me on the shoulder, shaking me out of my trance.

"So, what made you look so freaked out? Is it about the job again?"

I shook my head, "Look. I-I don't even want to talk about it. I would rather just drink it away and hope that I would forget."

Carson looked down at the counter, nodding understandinly.

"I get it. There's some things I would have liked to forget too."

As he finished his sentence, the bartender placed two small glass cups in front of us before promptly filling them with liquor. Carson placed some money on the table before turning back towards me.

"Wanna hear a story?"

I grabbed my glass cup and nodded.

"Okay so this story happened all the way back when I was just a young lad. 15, or 16 to be precise. Summer had just started a couple of days ago and I was ready to goof off with my friends. My dad, at the time, worked as a police officer. But somewhere in-between a two or three weeks, he would end up quitting after a specific case. Naive I was, I ended up asking what had happened. And hesitantly, he began describing the scene."

He took a shot of his glass cup before continuing.

"He was dispatched to an unknown address after receiving a distress signal. When he got there, he banged on the door to try and see if anyone was inside. However, he had gotten no response. So, he bust down the door. Immediately, he said he could describe the almost overwhelming stench of blood hitting his nose. The shit made him gag. He could tell that the smell was coming from upstairs and so of course, he would begin heading up there. Checking the first couple of rooms, there was nothing inside to note. But it was the last room. That last room that made him quit his job."

I took a shot of my glass before placing it back down, *S-So what was it?"

Carson shook his head, seemingly shivering at having to just describe the sight.

"In the last room, there was an unidentifiable mangled corpse, just laid out against the wall like an art piece. A one-time wonder if you will. The victim had been fucking decapitated, the bone poking out of his neck and blood accompanied by masses of flesh running down his neck. My dad threw up on the spot. He said there was blood and cracks all over the wall, like the victim was dragged around like a ragdoll and had his head smashed into the wall until you could see the bloody paint of his own face. The skin, specifically around the neck, was loose. It had looked the attacker had digged his finger into the poor man's skin and was beginning to pull it off, or worse, was beginning to pull out his collarbone."

I could immediately feel my stomach begin churning as he described the gruesome scene. I felt like throwing up right then and there.

"F-Fuck man!"

"I know right? However, it doesn't end there. There was more to that bloody gruesome scene. In words above the corpse, written in blood, said ***"How does it feel now?"*** accompanied with a simple smiley face. I had nightmares for weeks. I couldn't imagine how worse it had to be for my father in person. The autopsy report said that there was bruising around the neck and most likely the attacker had somehow decapitated the poor guy with just his bare hands."

He paused, taking a shot of his glass. I awkwardly chuckled, feeling my stomach churning up again.

"Well, thanks for the nightmares man."

He smirked back at me.

"Sharing is caring."

Then, his phone would suddenly start ringing, nearly falling off of the counter. Carson grabbed it before so, turning back towards me.

"Sorry, I got to take this. I'll be back."

"No worries." I quickly replied.

Before he left, he ordered a couple more rounds for me before turning and heading for the door. I picked up my glass cup, taking another shot. I was glad to had come out here. It had let me forget about all of the horrible things that had happened, even if it was only temporary. I picked up another glass, taking another shot.

*"You have your mouth sown, huh?"*

I suddenly heard a voice besides me and I turned to look to see who it was. I could feel my heart drop into my stomach as what I saw wasn't a person. It was this shadowy figure wearing a white jacket. Its limbs was twice as thick as mine, it was damn near almost as big as my legs. Its head looked like frozen flames that poked out of the back of its head, shrouded in darkness like the rest of its body. The only facial features I could identify was this completely white cartoonlike smile with sharp teeth that seemed to stretched to the span of its face, gleaming brightly.

"W-What?"

It picked up what was previously Carson's glass cup before flicking it into its mouth, chomping on it like it was a treat.

*"Don't you find it hard to breathe with that...mask?"*

I looked down at myself before turning back towards the unknown entity in confusion.

"I-I have no idea what you're talking about."

It shook its head, its grin getting wider.

*"Drink all you want, but ignoring it won't make it any better. Your job isn't finished."*

I was even more confused now. It reached towards my glass cups now, chucking all of them into its mouth and chomping on them. I thought that maybe I had too much to drink and I stood up to leave. Right before the door though, I would hear someone, or something shriek from behind me.

***"DON'T IGNORE ME JAMES!!!"***

I swiftly turned around, be startled by the scream. I thought it came from the entity from before, but as my eyes locked onto it, it was far, far worse. From across the room, a lanky, pale deformed figure stared at me from across the room. It was tall and incredibly thin, so much so that I could see the faint outline of organs and ribs poking out from its skin. It looked so fragile and yet so domineering at the same time. Where the mouth was, was a mass of flesh that stretched upwards until it hit its eyes. That terror and dread was back again, just when I thought I had escaped it. I opened my mouth to scream but nothing came out.

Without warning, the deformed figure suddenly ran towards me at a speed I couldn't comprehend, slamming me against the wall by my neck with its elongated fingers. I grunted, gasping for breath as I looked up at the creature. It held a knife over its head and swiftly brought it down without giving me a chance to recover. Just barely, I was able to grab the knife with my hands before it made contact with me, the blade hovering just a few inches above my eye. The blade came closes to piercing through my eye on multiple occasions but in the nick of time, I was always able to push it back.

But just then, the creature would end up suddenly disappearing. And I would just be left there, holding the knife within my hand. My eyes widened as I looked at the knife then at the people surrounding me, pulling my hand back. I dropped the knife in shock and disbelief, my hand trembling. I wasn't sure of what just happened. 

"I-I need to go...."

I quickly walked out the door, walking over to Carson who was standing by the car.

"What's wrong? You a light drinker?" He chuckled.

I awkwardly chuckled back, " I guess you can say that."

I got in the car a couple of minutes before he did, leaning my head against the car window. I guess I had never thought about it before, but I had forgotten Shanks back at the house with that... thing. I just hoped now that something didn't happen to him. After a while, Carson would then get into his car and start it up, the vehicle roaring to life. The car began accelerating and I looked back at the bar until it disappeared from my vision.

"You know, the story didn't end there." Carson suddenly spoke.

My ears perked up at this, turning my attention towards Carson.

"What do you mean?"

"After that incident, my whole neighborhood was on lockdown, our parents advising us to not be out for too long in fear that the same would happen to us. Of course, me and my friends didn't listen. One night, I was hanging with friends and riding through the dimly lit streets. After about two hours or so of just fooling around, we decided to see each other off. I was the last to see Darren, one of my close friends, off. I swiftly rode back home and exhausted, fell asleep. Until I would suddenly be awoken by the sound of my phone ringing. It was Darren. I picked up the phone and asked what was wrong, to end up calling me in the middle of the night. He told me that he was scared and that he saw a man standing outside his window, despite him living on the second floor."

He paused, taking a moment to breathe.

"Eventually, I was able to convince that he was most likely just seeing things and that he should go back to sleep. Later that night, I would suddenly be awoken by the sounds of police sirens. By the sound of it, there seemed to be a lot of them, and they were heading somewhere. I was unable to fall back asleep. So, against my better judgement, I decided to see what was happening. I followed the sounds of the sirens, and to my horror, I found myself at Darren's house. I tried to get inside through the cluster of cop cars,  desperately wanting to know what had happened. But they refused to allow me any closer.

But that's when I remembered something. Darren told me of how the bathroom window was never locked, meaning he could sneak out and sneak back in. Or how someone else could sneak in. So of course, I went around to the back of the house and I snuck through the window. I ran upstairs as fast as I could, just fast enough to be able to brush past through the cops standing around. When I ran upstairs to his room, I...I..."

He stammered, opening his mouth to seemingly say something but nothing came out.

"You what?"

".....There was a message written in blood before. Just like before. It simply said: Traitor."
