“Brick!” Yelled Jake.

The ball rolled off the court down near the creek. It would’ve been my ball but I didn’t feel like climbing back up the hill after getting the ball from the bottom of the hill. Jake was already almost down the hill anyways.

I blinked and once I reopened my eyes it was dark. Like midnight.

“What’s going on?!” Yelled Isaac.

I had no answer for him. I expected a shreik from Jake but it never came. We spent about half an hour searching for him before we became more concerned. We were children then. We didn’t think that he was in danger.

Eventually we decided to go home. Looking back I don’t remember if we were planning on telling our parents that we lost Jake or if we just assumed that he had went home, but upon my arrival I was asked by my parents if I had seen Jake. I had then been told to go to bed. Something was off. My parents had never told me to go to bed without a shower. Also just the demeanor of my parents was slightly off.

I did not sleep very well that night. It did not even feel late but as I had said, it was pitch black as if it was midnight. Eventually, I did fall asleep. I was abruptly woken up by blinding sun rays coming through my window as if it was the middle of the day. My clock said 6:04 AM.

This alarmed me but immediately I thought back to the odd happenings of the night before. Something was off. I walked downstairs and said hello to my dad. I then grabbed toast and butter and walked over to the toaster. I saw a note saying “your mother and I left for work early.” This was confusing. My father was in the kitchen. 

I turned around to see… not my father. It was a woman with a similar looking chin and hair color to those of my mother… but not my mother.

I asked who she was. She told me that she was my mother. This scared me. I darted out the door into the bright sunlight. The exhausted feeling of just waking up combined with the mid-day sunshine made me feel nauseous. The idea that my mother was missing and that I have an imposter in my home with my father also didn’t help. I started to feel ill when my father caught up with me. I passed out in his arms.

“Wake up son”

It was a grizzly voice of my father. The alarm clock read 9:30 on the dot.

“What happened?”

“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

“Earlier there was a woman in our kitch-“

“Son, your mother and I woke up 10 minutes ago. You’re having dreams. That is all it is.”

I made my way downstairs. On my way down I could already hear the TV. It was on the news station. A female reporter was speaking.

“A passenger named Tasha Wright had to be held down by an air Marshall after knocking 3 flight attendants down. She was heard making claims that her son had went to the restroom on the plane and not returned.”

The screen switched over to a crying woman being escorted by two police men. She was a wreck, in tears, I felt bad for her.

The female reporter continued before the screen switched back over to her.

“There have been no sightings of a boy accompanying Tasha on any of the security footage.”

What stood out to me most was that at some point during Tasha’s rambling, she said something along the lines of her son disappearing once the sun went away. Just like Jake. I don’t think these are isolated incidents.

I woke up the next day around 6. It was Monday so I had school. I vaguely remember waking up and it was still dark outside, which is pretty normal for it to be that early. But by the time I had gotten dressed, ate breakfast, and walked outside to get in the car, the sun was up. Not just “sunrise” up. Like it was the middle of the day.

For the record, I’m no longer under the impression that these are just strange occurrences. When my mother’s face was not right I briefly brushed it off as me not being fully awake, or that I may have been dreaming that part. There is no more room to excuse the strange happenings.

My “mother” drove me to school that day. I could see in the rear view mirror that she had her eyes closed throughout the whole trip and couldn’t help but notice that she was taking rapid deep breaths the whole time. She was driving flawlessly tho.

Once we arrived at school I heard something bump and then scratch against the plywood floors of my attic. This would’ve startled me on its own but the fact that I was miles away from my house and instead of coming from my attic, the noise came from the clear blue sky, it had a more intense fear factor.

I turned to tell whoever this woman driving my mom’s car goodbye but as I looked inside the car nobody was in the driver seat. The drop off line was full behind me but the cars behind us had no drivers. Just children starring blankly forward.

I had no where else to go so I walked into school. I went straight to the bathroom, startled to see a body lying on the floor inside of the large stall that is typically found towards the back of a public restroom. It was wearing pajamas. I walked into the stall and froze. This body belonged to my mother. I recognized the pajamas as the ones that she was wearing a few nights ago. The night before all of these odd occurrences began. I recognized her face partly.., it looked like several bones in her face below nose had been crushed. As if someone had used the jaws of life on her face.

There is no way to express the feelings that I felt, standing there in the bathroom next to my mother’s corpse. I don’t know if these events are of space above or hell below, but as for me and my town, we are doomed. If you can relate to any of these events or just have any absurd events going on in your town, please comment below. Maybe we still have hope. SOS
