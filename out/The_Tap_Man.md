 Tap. Tap. Tap. 

 What the hell? I said as I jumped out of my seat. I was sitting in the living room watching Everybody Loves Raymond when I heard the tapping on one of the windows. 

 Sounded like the one in the kitchen. I grumbled as I didn't want to get up. I turned the kitchen lights on and went to the window. I sighed as it was just a tree branch from the tree that was too close to the house. Been meaning to cut it down but never did. 

 I just ignored it and grabbed a beer. Perks for being single in your 30's. I sat down back in my chair as a commercial runs through. The Storm Weather Alert comes back on again as I just take another sip of the cold beer. 

 Tap! Tap! Tap! 

 I nearly jumped out of my seat as it was louder this time. The tapping felt almost forced this time. I searched to where the tapping was coming from. 

 Tap! Tap! Tap! 

 Now it's coming from the bedroom window upstairs? I sat my beer down on my table and got up again. The buzz was just starting to kick in. 

 Tap! Tap! Tap! 

 "I'm coming!" I yelled at the noise knowing that nothing was there. I went upstairs and looked through my bedroom curtains and there wasâ€¦ nothing? I opened the window feeling the rushing rain on my face as I look for the source of the tapping. Then suddenly, 

 TAP! TAP! TAP!  

 This time it was so loud that I jumped and bumped my head on the window. "Damn it!" I yelled and closed the window. 

 TAP! TAP! TAP! 

 I hurried down the stairs as I recognized that the aound was coming from the door. Suddenly as I was inches away from it instincts were telling me not to open it but I did. 

 TAP! TAP! TAP! 

 The tapping stopped as i only saw a man wearing a black trench coat and hat that covered his face. My heart Suddenly started thumping real loud as I didn't want to talk to him but I have been raised to know better. 

 "Hello? What do you want?" 

 I saw the man grin from underneath the hat. 

 "Sir will you please let me in and use your phone? My car broke down and I can't seem to reach anybody". 

 Seems like a plausible story. I thought. But then my brain started to kick in. "Couldn't you just call someone from your phone?" I asked him. His mouth suddenly went into a frustrated expression. "My phone battery died." He grumbled. 

 "Alright sir you can cone in." As I go to move out of the way to let him in I saw something on his left hand. A GIANT FINGER! it looked like maybe it was about 6 feet long and he was hiding it behind his back. 

 As he was taking his first step in I pushed him away from me and locked the door. Suddenly there was loud banging on the door. "Let Me In! Let Me In! " The door looked like it was about to come off his hinges but I stood my ground with the adrenalin rushing through me, "No!".

 The banging stopped except with the pounding rain. I just stood there terrified. And then Suddenly. 

 Tap. Tap. Tap. 

 The tapping started again. It has been going on now for hours. I can't sleep for fear of him sneaking in. 

 Tap. Tap. Tap. 

 Hopefully it will stop raining soon.
