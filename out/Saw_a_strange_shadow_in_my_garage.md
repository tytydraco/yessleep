Hi, I am fairly new to reddit and don't really know where to post it but I kind of just wanted to throw it out there to get some feedback.

Yesterday I was working out in my garage, and this is early morning so the sun is fully out. There is a roof turbine on top of the garage, like those spinney ball type things with the curved metal strips. It was spinning and letting some light onto the garage door (view the images for a better picture), at a nice pace creating an oscillating area of rays of light. Very relaxing to stare at mid set. 

There was an object casting a shadow from this ray of light, it looked like a furry rigid leg. I drew it out to the best of my abilities for a better picture. It was ,around a foot and a half as a shadow, with what looked like to be a hairy texture, with one group of hairs which seemed a bit more prominent if that makes sense.  Normally I would think its just a squirrel since they very often run along the roof of all the neighboring buildings and houses and I could often hear them.

The object was to rigid and still to be a squirrel, also from what I could tell it was also pretty big but I could be mistaken. My next assumption was that it was some kind of piece of peeling old detreating support beam. This seemed plausible, Even though it was at an angle I could imagine how something like it could maybe bend or fall however this assumption was quickly put to rest.

While this shadow was sort of freaky it didn't put be at enough distress to react in any sort of manor, just a weird observation between a set. I lay back down on my bench to do another set, listening to my podcast. I finish, sit back up, and the shadows gone, completely. The roof turbine still spinning.

This was really weird for two reasons, one it looked like a still stationary object, perfectly stationary the only weird thing was that it looked hairy. And two I didn't hear a thing, and yes I was listening to a podcast but I hear cars outside, doors opening, much quieter stuff and something moving above me I would definitely hear. I have also heard my fair share of creepy noises, especially at night with all the wild life activity out in the garage but nothing like this.

I would love to hear your feedback on this, I also realized that no images were allowed on this subreddit so I put in some links. Tell me if they don't work or any other way I could share images. I unfortunately wasn't able to get a photo of the shadow which is a bummer I understand but I did draw a recreation to the best of my ability. Also any recommendation to a different subreddit to post this in since I am not 100% sure this is the right place to put this would be great.
