*55..56..57…58…59…*

10 more minutes to go.

Summer vacation. 

School had never really been my thing. I had absolutely no desire to apply myself and my grades showed it. From the moment the bell rang on the first day of school, I begin my countdown to freedom from this cinder block prison. 

However, this summer was going to look different from my normal drug induced escapades. During spring break I was getting into my usual trouble when I pushed it a little too far. I found myself handcuffed in the back of a police car along with my 23 year old boyfriend. 

To be honest, we hadn’t really done anything that bad. It was just a little fraud. Well not just a little, $245,078 worth of fraud. We weren’t supposed to get caught. Or at least that’s what Skylar made me believe. His aunt was old, couldn’t even remember her own address most of the time. She wasn’t supposed to notice the money missing from her account.

We got away with it for a while. Obviously. That is a large amount of money. But once she caught on, she knew it was us. Which led to Skylar and I being detained in a Macy’s.

Fucking idiot. 

I’m smarter than that. I knew the chances of her finding out were high, regardless of the old bird’s memory issues, but something about the possibility of getting away with it teased me. 

I’d been in trouble before, but it never ended in hand cuffs. Skylar and I came from money, which solved our issues usually. Until now. I guess the sheriff was tired of my dad paying the judge off and keeping me out of trouble. 

Skylar was constantly in and out of jail. Being born to old people with money will do that to you. Skylar’s dad was 60 when he was born and his mom 48. Honestly I feel bad for the woman, imagine thinking you’re going into menopause but surprise! Baby. His dad died when Skylar was 15 and his mom passed away from cancer when he was 19. Which left Skylar with a shit ton of money and no one to control him.

Bond was easy for him to achieve. However, for me, it was not. I was 17 so I didn’t have full access to the money that belonged to me. My parents had, had enough of my “shenanigans”, as my mom worded it. She told me that maybe sitting in a cell for 24 hours would make me rethink my “path in life”. 

Whatever. 

So there I sat for 24 hours. On the dot. It was almost comical the way my parents glared at me when I walked through the release doors. 

It was silent until we got in the car. Then my dad started. 

“What the hell were you thinking, Sam? You’re lucky she decided not to press charges.” His brow furrowed as he looked at me through the rear view mirror. 

I shifted my gaze out the window. I could feel his eyes on me as I watched the trees go by. 

“You should probably watch the road before you get us all killed”.

My body jerked to the left as the Mercedes quickly veered to the right and stopped on the shoulder in a forceful manner. 

My dad threw the car in park and whipped his head around so fast, I thought he was going to give himself whiplash. My mom started crying.

“What would Em think? She looked up to you-“

“Don’t you dare speaker her name to me, you piece of shit!” My voice was getting progressively louder. “She would be alive right now and none of this would be happening if it weren’t for the both of you! You KILLED her!”

This was first we had spoken of my sister since her funeral four years ago. 

My mom’s crying became more audible and my dad’s face hardened. 

“Emily and I were left home alone more often than not! It’s your fault she started researching that weird shit online! If you guys had been home more often, none of this would have happened!”

Silence again. Only this time it was deafening. 

My words tasted like venom on my tongue. My father’s face dropped. He opened his mouth like he was going to say something. Instead he faced forward, put the car in drive and started back on the highway. 

My mother’s sobs started again. 

I could feel tears welling up in my eyes and my throat felt like I had a golf ball stuck in it. I fought back my tears and turned my attention back out the window. 

My words hurt them and I knew it. But I meant everything I had said. I wanted them to feel my pain, the grief I hadn’t allowed myself to fully feel. They lost a child. But I lost my sister, my best friend. And it was all their fault. 

The silence between the three of us continued. We barely spoke to each other after that. 

“There will be a punishment coming for you. Don’t think you’re off the hook this time. I don’t know what it is yet, but we’ll find one to fit the crime.”

That was pretty much the last thing my dad said to me. 

Until last week. 

“Your mother and I have decided you’ll be spending the summer with your grandfather. He’s agreed some hard manual labor will serve you best. You’ll be leaving the day after school gets out.”

*BOOOOOOOOOOP*

The final bell. I was free. For now.

I leaned over my desk and grabbed my backpack. I gave a final smile to my teacher and walked out the door. 

Seniors were whooping and throwing papers all down the hallways. I stayed to the far left side of the hall and tried my best to avoid the chaos as I made my way for the door. Then I heard the sound of running feet quickly approaching me. 

“Hey Sam! Wait up!”

I felt an arm snake around my shoulders. 

“Oh hey, Ethan. What’s up?”

Ethan was really the only friend I had made since we moved four years ago. We met at my first and only job, before I got fired. I used to bum cigarettes off him during our breaks and eventually we developed a friendship. He was a year older than me. We didn’t hangout much outside of going to parties and sharing a hangover the next morning. But, I was going to miss him. 

“Are you going to the party tonight? I got some party favors” he said as he waved a small bag with a white powder in it, in front of my face. 

“Nahh. I think I’m going to catch a meeting tonight, I’ve got a lot on my mind. Do you have more of that? I’ll buy some off you- shit. I forgot my phone died. Is it good if I Venmo you when I get home?”

I lied.

He pulled another small bag out of his backpack and slipped it into my back pocket. 

“For sure. I know you’re good for it” he gave me a quick hug and headed back the other way.

I’m not sending him money for shit. I was going away for the summer and by the time I got back, he’d already be gone for college. Win, win.

I pushed my way out the doors and walked into the brisk Colorado air. I took a deep breath and inhaled the air like I had never breathed before. I was going to miss this air and wanted to savor it while I could. 

I was not looking forward to going home. I still had packing I needed to do and no motivation to do it. But my little present from Ethan would make things a little more enjoyable.

——————

I wanted to head straight to my room. But to my surprise both my parents were waiting on the couch for me as I walked through the garage door. 

“Sam. Have a seat. We need to discuss some things” my dad gestured to the empty love seat.

“I’m good. I have packing I need to get to” I hung my keys by the door and started for the stairs. 

“Sit. Now.”

I guess I didn’t have a choice in the matter. 

“What?” I dropped my weight on the seat and rolled my eyes. 

“There will be no funny business while you’re with your grandfather” my mother started. “He has strict instructions to update us weekly with your behavior. If there are any infractions, your father and I have a camp for troubled teens lined up. If you can’t get it together, that’s your next stop”. 

I could feel anger building in my chest. 

I jumped up from my seat. 

“You’re joking right?! Do you two seriously live under a rock?! Do all the horror stories coming out about those places mean absolutely nothing to you? Now you want to send me to one?! You have got to be joking”.

My mother stood from her seat. 

“I suppose you’ll need to get your act together then” she walked into the kitchen leaving my father and I alone. 

“We just don’t know what to do with you anymore, Samantha” I could see guilt in my father’s eyes. He walked closer to me and attempted to give me a hug. 

“Yeah. Whatever” I dodged his embrace and headed to my room. 

There were times I felt guilty for my behavior but I learned to stuff that down like I had a lot of my emotions. I truly felt like my parents weren’t punished enough for Emily’s death. I dealt with the brunt of it and they expected me to carry on as if nothing ever happened. 

I threw my backpack on my bed and headed for my bathroom. I pulled the tiny bag from my back pocket and poured some of the contents onto the counter. Then pulled one of those discount cards that they send in the mail from my stash spot and started evenly dividing the white powder into three skinny lines. Coke wasn’t my drug of choice but it would do the job for now. I grabbed a crinkled dollar from a pair of discarded jeans, rolled it up and quickly inhaled the lines.

Alright. Time to pack.

——————

I finished in what felt like record time. I looked at the clock. 6:02. I had just enough time to get to a meeting. I grabbed my wallet from my backpack on the bed then made my way downstairs. 

“And where do you think you’re going? We need to leave for the airport at 4am” my mom said looking up from her book. “You better not be going to see Skylar! We told you you’re not allowed around him anymore”.

I kept walking towards the hook where my keys hung. 

“Relax. I’m going to a meeting. I’ll be back in a couple hours. Plus, you made me share my location with you guys. You can literally see where I’m going to be” that was part of my punishment after my arrest.

“Oh. Good” she went back to her book.

——————

The ten minute drive to the meeting hall felt like it took hours. I really did have a lot on my mind. That much I hadn’t lied to Ethan about. I hadn’t truly thought about my sister’s death in at least a year. Which was an actual improvement for me. 

Rain slowly and sporadically started covering my windshield. The sound of the light pitter-patter eased my anxiety a little.

I pulled into the parking lot and parked in front of the door where a sign read, Group Grief Counseling Tonight.

This was my parents attempt at “helping me heal my wounds”. At first I thought it might help. After the first couple of weeks I started losing hope that it would be any help at all. My PTSD prevented me from ever opening my mouth to share. 

After a year of going, the PTSD had subsided to the point where I felt like I could share. By that point though, I was angry. None of these people had been through what I had been through. Their sob stories were mere blips, they were just a bunch of whiners. If I could get on with my life, why couldn’t they? Some of these people were crippled by the deaths of their grandmothers that had passed from natural causes. What a bunch of fucking losers, man.

I grabbed my wallet from the passenger seat and opened the door. A red mustang was parked at the other end of the parking lot. 

Skylar. 

Group was actually where I met Skylar. Three years ago I found a handsome boy occupying my chair. 

“Hey I know you’re new here, but you’re sitting in my chair” I said as I approached him. 

“Oh. Sorry, didn’t realize there was assigned seating” he moved to the next seat over. 

“There’s not. That’s just MY seat”

“I’m Skylar” he extended his hand and flashed a beautiful, perfect smile. 

That’s when my trouble really began. From then on the chair next to mine was Skylar’s and our toxic relationship started blooming. 

Skylar’s meetings were court mandated. The judge felt some grieve counseling would help him deal with his parents’ deaths and in turn would keep him out of trouble. 

First we started hanging out in the parking lot after meetings, just talking. Then I started spending time with him at his aunt’s house after meetings and any time I wasn’t at school.

I felt normal with him. We were both damaged but our damages complimented each other. At least that’s how it felt at first. Skylar was everything I wasn’t. He did things I would never dream of doing. I became addicted to it. The more danger that was involved with him, the more I felt alive.

I had become addicted to testing fate. So doing dumb shit became part of my everyday routine. Besides being with Skylar, it was the only way I could truly feel. There was no better feeling than the hard thump in my chest. Anxiety and excitement rising.

Once the judge felt like Skylar had repented enough, the meetings stopped all together. Skylar didn’t go anymore, so I didn’t go anymore. The adrenaline followed Skylar, which meant I became his puppy. Where Skylar went, I went. 

By this time I was 15. Skylar was 20. He knew what he was doing and obviously showed zero remorse for it. For about a year, I was so far up his ass I’m surprised I could even breathe. But then I started catching on. I started becoming distant. Only came around when he wanted to get high or drink. The fantasy faded but the adrenaline stayed, so I stayed- kinda. 

I no longer viewed him as a God, he was more of a tool for my disposal. He bought good drugs, he was always down to get drunk, and he laid good pipe. Three things that were always at the top of my list. When I needed a shock to my heart, Skylar was the answer. 

“Fucking Ethan” I whispered under my breath as I shut the car door. 

As I approached the front doors, someone was leaning against a pillar, smoking a cigarette. 

“Thought I might find you here” Skylar said as he took a drag.

“Ethan told you, yeah?” I took the cigarette from his fingers and took a long puff. “I thought you quit?” Handing the burning tobacco back to him.

“I thought you quit these dumb ass meetings?” He lifted his shoe and rubbed the butt of the cigarette into his heal.

“Yeah, well. Going back to where it all happened is fucking with my head a little. I thought a meeting might help”. I turned to go inside and then paused. “Why are you here? There’s no underage girls you want to pray on tonight? There’s plenty of parties going on”.

“Ouch, Sam. You know you’re the only underage girl I have my sights set on”.

Gross. 

“Just get out of here. You’re a distraction to everyone when you’re here. Your comments make everyone uncomfortable. Just go” I pulled the door open and quickly step inside letting it shut behind me. 

The door pulled open again, the sound of Skylar’s foot steps following. 

“Nah. I’m already here, would be a waste of gas to just turn around and leave now.”

“You’re such a prick” instead of sitting in my usual seat, I sat at the opposite end of the circle, away from Skylar.

“Alright everyone, it’s 6:32, let’s go ahead and get started. Is anyone interested in starting us off tonight?”

My hand shot straight in the air. 

“Oh? Sam? I was definitely not expecting that. But I’m glad after four years you finally feel comfortable to speak. Whenever you’re ready”.

——————

“Come on, Emily. Pick up the phone, where are you?” I paced back in forth in the living room just listening to the phone line ring.

It had been eight hours since I last heard from Emily. This wasn’t like her. She always responded, she always checked in. I also wasn’t able to find her location. The sun was starting to go down and I was getting nervous.

“Please leave a message-“

“Damnit, Emily” I whispered as I slammed my phone on the coffee table. 

Something wasn’t right and I could feel it. Emily and I weren’t twins, we were 11 months apart, but we could always tell when something was off with the other. It was almost like I couldn’t feel her anymore.

I picked my phone up and dialed my dad’s number. No answer. Right, he’s in a meeting tonight. If I call the office, his secretary should answer. 

“Richard Hues’ phone, how can I help you?” A female voiced answered.

“Hi Miranda, it’s Sam, I know my dad is busy but this is urgent, I NEED to talk to him. Please” my voice becoming shaky.

“Sure Sam, let me get him” I heard the click of the door open, the giggle of a female, and then mumbling.

“Hey Sam, Miranda said it was urgent, is everything okay?” My dad said breathlessly. 

“I can’t get a hold of Emily and her location is off. She left at 10 this morning with all that research she’s been doing. I’m scared Dad, I think something happened to her” tears were streaking my cheeks.

My dad sighed. 

“Sam. You know how she’s been lately, she’s been so focused on whatever it is she’s doing on the computer. She’s probably just at the library, lost track of time”.

“Rich!” A voice from the background called.

“Listen Sam, I have to get back to this meeting. Keep me updated. She’ll come home, you know how she’s is”.

“No, Dad wait-“ the phone line disconnected.

“Yeah. Your meeting” I wiped the tears from my chin and set my phone down once again. 

There was no point in trying to call mom. She was out of town for work and never answered her phone when we called. 

Now what? Grandpa hadn’t owned a phone since grandma died and we didn’t really have that kind of relationship with him so there was no reason for Emily to go there. 

I could feel the anxiety building in my chest, the palms of my hands started to sweat profusely.

Think Sam, think. I continued pacing the living room.

The library. Maybe my dad was right. Maybe she had gone to the library and her phone died or something. I didn’t want to leave the house in case she came back. Duh. I’ll just call and ask if they’ve seen her today.

“Hermann library”

“Hi, my name is Sam Hues. I was wondering if you had seen my sister Emily today? She’s 12, has light brown hair, kind of long, a little past her shoulders, and light blue eyes”.

“Oh yes! I know Emily well! I’m sorry honey, I haven’t seen her today” she answered.

Damn.

“No problem, thank you for your help” I ended the call. Tears started rolling again, panic setting in. 

Her computer. Maybe that would help me. She left with all those papers, hopefully the her research could tell me where she had gone. 

To Emily’s room I went. As I walked up the stairs I took extra time looking at all the pictures of us my mom had hung over the years. 

Emily and I winning our first soccer championship. Emily and I at the spelling bee. She won that year and never let me forget. Pictures of us playing at the park. A photo of us in the hospital with our grandma before she died. 

We did everything together. We were pretty much all we had. These photos were just a reminder that if something did happen to Em, I would be all alone. 

I started sobbing uncontrollably. 

“Emily please. I need you to be okay. I won’t survive without you” I leaned over the hand rail and tried to control my breathing. “Come on Sam, you have to be strong. Strong for Emily. We’re going to find her”.

I finished the last four stairs and headed down the hall to Emily’s room. I pushed open the door and a dank, musty smell rushed out and smack me in the face. I pinched my nose. I guess I hadn’t been in here in forever. Emily spent most of her days cooped up in here, with the door shut, clacking away at her keyboard. The space reeked of neglect. 

“Jesus, Emily. Did you forget how to clean?” I stepped over piles of trash and clothes as I walked towards her computer.

The best part about Emily is there were no secrets between us. Which meant no password for me to try and guess. 

I logged on and started browsing her desktop. It was a disaster to say the least. Which was so unlike Emily. All of this was so unlike her. Out of the two of us, Emily was the neat and tidy one. Her room was always pristine, she kept everything organized to a T. It was almost like she had a touch of OCD the way everything HAD to be placed and put back a certain way. All of this was extremely off. 

I kept scanning the desktop, looking for anything that stuck out in the disorganized mess. Then I saw it. A folder labeled “Naga”. Something told me this would lead me to her.

I clicked.

A file with over 100 other files of articles, online forum links, and research notes popped open. 

“What the hell?” My eyes continued scanning. I couldn’t decide where to start. 

I clicked the first link. This has to be where it all started, maybe this will give me what I need. My head was spinning. I couldn’t even begin to process the information I was reading. 

“Why would Emily need a wish granted?” I spoke aloud as I skimmed through the article. 

I had just reached the section where it was explaining how to summon a Naga when I heard the door bell rang. 

Emily?!

Without a second thought I sprang from the computer chair and ran for the door. I almost tripped over several piles of god only knows what as I rushed to get downstairs. I sprinted down the squeaky, old stairs and flung the front door open, breathlessly. 

It wasn’t Emily. 

Two cops were standing at the door.

“Hey Sammy, are your parents home? We’ve been trying to reach them but couldn’t get either to answer their phones. Figured we would come by” officer Lance said as he rocked on his heels.

“My dad is at work still, meetings. And my mom is out of town meeting with a client” I looked back and forth at the officers. Their energies were off, something was going on.

They shot glances at one another.

“This isn’t something we would normally do, but since we can’t get ahold of your parents and you’re the only one here, could you come with us?” Officer Henderson said as he motioned to the cruiser.

“Umm. Sure. Let me grab my phone and some shoes” I retrieved my phone from the coffee table where I had left it and grabbed my black converse from in front of the couch.

I sent a quick text to my parents so they knew where I would be, not that it really mattered. Emily and I were always left to fend for ourselves. They never really knew where we were. 

I locked the front door and headed towards the cruiser. Officer Henderson opened the back door for me. 

“So what did grandpa do this time?” I said as I slid into the middle seat. 

He was always causing some kind of mischief. Hermann was a fairly small town. There was about 2,500 of us living here. It was a pretty tight knit community but the warmer seasons brought tourists and my grandpa had a habit of starting problems with them. I wish I could say this was the first time I had been retrieved from my house to bail him out. They used the same excuse “we’re not really supposed to do this-blah blah” every time.

Lance shifted uncomfortably in the passenger seat. He rubbed the palms of his hands on his pants as Henderson moved into the driver seat.

No one answered me. They didn’t even acknowledge I had said anything. 

“Hey, since I’m with you guys, has anyone heard anything about Emily? I haven’t been able to get ahold of her all day. I called the library but no one had seen her there” I drummed my fingers on the leather as I waited for a response.

They both kept looking forward, the sound of the tires on the asphalt was all that could be heard. 

“Umm hello? You guys are acting weird. What’s going on?” The pace of my heart quickened. 

Lance sighed and took in a big breath. 

“Sammy” he said as he exhaled. “This isn’t about your grandpa”.

The white cruiser pulled into the station parking lot. Henderson parked the car and cut the engine. No one moved. 

“We think we found something-or someone” Henderson said as he placed his hands at 10 and 2 on the wheel. He rested his forehead between his hands. 

“What do you mean? You’re scaring me”.

“Shit” he said as he lifted his head and looked at Lance with tears in his eyes. 

“Sammy-we-we think we found Emily” tears fell like raindrops from his eyes. 

“What do you mean you THINK?!” Panic was setting in. 

“Listen Sammy, we really didn’t want you to see this. But seeing as how we can’t reach your parents, we need someone to identify the body” Lance got out of the car and opened my door. 

Identify. The. Body. 

Identify. 

The.

Body. 

Identify? The? Body?

The blood left my face. The tips of my fingers went cold. Henderson and Lance continued talking to me as we walked through multiple doors of the station. Their voices were muffled, all I could hear was ringing. My legs felt like heavy bags of sand as they continued to carry me through parts of the station I had never been to. 

Then we stopped. 

Coroner.

I stepped forward to push through the heavy metal doors. As I shifted my weight to push, a hand grabbed my arm. 

“Sam. Wait. “She-she doesn’t look like herself-“ Henderson started.

“I don’t care” I snatched my arm from his grasp. 

“No, I mean her body is in rough shape. We’re not 100% sure it’s her, but we have plausible reason to think it is”.

“I need to see her for myself”. I pushed through the doors. 

The room was cold and oddly lit. There were multiple examination tables lined up next to each other but only one was occupied. I moved slowly towards it. As I inched closer, a putrid smell started to fill my nostrils. It grew worse the closer I got to the white tarp. It smelled like a mixture of rotten eggs and that smell that wafts from port-a-potties. 

I covered my nose as I stood at the head of the body. My eyes were now dripping from the smell, like when you cut an onion. Lance took a place next to me on the left side.

“Are you sure you’re ready for this” he asked as he picked up the corner of the fabric covering the body.

“No” I swallowed hard. “But I know she would do this for me if the roles were reversed. Go ahead”.

The tarp lifted and the smell intensified. Henderson quickly turned around and vomited on the clean, white tile floor. 

Horror movies could not have prepared me for the scene presented to me. I had never seen something so horrifying but I couldn’t look away. 

They were right. She didn’t look the same. She didn’t even look like a person. What was left of her clothes was soaked with water, mud, and crimson red stains. Her body was bloated, it looked like it had been waterlogged for weeks. It was so swollen, if you poked the skin, I bet her entire thing would have burst like a Gusher. 

Her beautiful, ocean blue eyes had been removed from their sockets. Pitch black holes left in their place. Trails of bloody tears covered her face. 

There was no hair. Her scalp had been removed. The white of her skull on display for everyone to see. 

Her left cheek was caved in like someone had smashed her face in with something heavy. Her top teeth had been knocked out, probably from the force of whatever she was hit with. 

My stomach lurked and bile made its way up my throat as I looked at the rest of her body. What was left of it. 

All of her limbs were bloody stumps, serrated flesh and bone. The one limb that was still attached, and saying attached is a stretch, was her right arm. It looked like the wishbone from a turkey when you can’t fully pull it apart. 

The worst part of it all was her abdomen. There was a large gash in the middle that went so deep, her insides were exposed, almost spilling out. 

I turned my head. Choking the vomit back down that was attempting to spew out of my sealed lips.

I had a strange feeling of excitement rise throughout my chest. 

I laughed. 

“Very funny, you guys”. 

Lance and Henderson exchanged confused looks.

“Now I’ve never seen a dead body. But this isn’t Emily. This body looks like it’s been dead for weeks! Emily left at 10 this morning, this body looks like it’s been floating in the river for a long time, even smells like it too”. I continued to chuckle to myself.

“What is this? Some kind of Halloween prop? It’s a pretty good one too! Where did you find one this time of year? Come on out Emily! You got me good, I even called dad in a panic”. The two men continued to observe me with confusion. 

“Sam…I know this is hard for you. Shit. Hard doesn’t even begin to explain it” Lance stopped. “But this is Em-“. I held my hand up and shook my head. 

“Is my entire family involved in this?” I started walking down the length of the body. “If you knew it was her, why did you need me?” My eyes continuing to scan the body next to me.

I stopped like my legs had suddenly found themselves in drying cement. If I hadn’t started walking next to the table, I wouldn’t have seen it.

I back tracked to what was probably the neck. The light flashed off a piece of metal. With shaking hands, I reached for the mud caked object. I vigorously rubbed the brown goo away, revealing a gold pendant. 

It was a gold capital E. I clutched the gold S that hung around my neck in the very same spot. This was Emily.

My vision started to narrow, a black tunnel was all I could see. I blinked my eyes, trying to get rid of it. 

*bzzzz bzzzz*

My phone vibrated in my back pocket. I pulled it from where it was and then my legs gave way and the room went dark. 

Text from Mom:
“What happened to Emily?”
