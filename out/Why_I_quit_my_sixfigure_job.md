Most people are usually surprised when I tell them that I quit my six-figure job without a backup plan.



They are a little more understanding when I tell them I was an underwater oil rig welder.



This is a dangerous job, to say the least. But I didn't quit because of how dangerous it was. I quit because of something... Something I still have a hard time coming to terms with. I know I sound troubled, but to be honest, I feel nervous even thinking about it. I know what I saw was real, but everyone around me seems to think I've lost it. But that's not why I am writing this. You see, I am starting to forget things - not just tiny details about the incident but important details. Yesterday, I tried to recall how I found the job, and I'm ashamed to say it took me three hours of racking my brain to remember. It was only two months ago.



Thereâ€™s also another thing. If you continue reading this, I ask only one thing: please understand why I did what I did before judging me.



If you know nothing about this job, just know that it is very dangerous, which is why the pay is so good. I was an experienced welder at the time and had some experience with underwater welding when I applied. They decided to fly me to an area off the coast of Nigeria to live on the tanker for a six-month project - my first real offshore project.





See, the thing about these offshore projects is that you are in the middle of absolute nowhere. If that doesn't freak you out, once you get on the rig, you are there for at least a month, as that's when the next supply ship that brings food and transportation for the workers comes back. You would spend one month on the rig and then get two weeks on land. 





Needless to say, I didn't really care. I was making around $150,000 for the job. That ship could come once a year for all I cared.





The first week on the job was pretty average. I was a bit nervous, but once I started the job, it went smoothly. After the end of the week, I got some feedback and was surprised to see that it was good. I was off to a great start. The second week was the same.





But by the third week, some cabin fever had kicked in. It feels kinda like the movie Groundhog Day, where the same things happen every day. I would wake up, get breakfast, say hi to the cleaning crew, talk to my supervisor about the plan for the day, meet with the rest of the team, and get started on the job - like clockwork.





So, to add some variety, I started going on night walks around the rig. I don't think I need to explain why these are highly discouraged. The ocean at night is really dark. If something... or someone were to fall into it, they might as well be considered dead. Regardless, I still went out.





I remember finding it scary when I first saw how dark it was, but also a bit soothing. Staring at the inky black waters made me feel like I was almost floating in space. You could throw an apple into the waters, and it would feel like it was vanishing into thin air. I remember those first few nights walking around the rig to be very meditative. But it only lasted for those few nights.





I noticed one night while walking around the rig that another one of my coworkers was out.



It was Mason.



Mason was another welder who worked on the rig with me. We chatted a few times before, but I never really had a deep interest in getting to know him further. I found him to be a nice guy but somewhat naive and a bit dull. Something strange was up with him that night, though. I called out to him, but he didn't respond. I started walking towards him from his left, and as I got closer, I noticed he was leaning on the railing, staring at the ocean. His eyes were wide open, and...he was drooling.





I remember putting my hand on his shoulder to wake him up, but he jolted when I touched him, almost as if he woke up from a deep sleep. And yet, the look he gave me was one of absolute fear. But before I could ask him if he was okay, he was walking back to his room. Not going to lie to you, I was definitely a little uneasy. But I just chalked it up to lack of sleep and/or mental health issues.





That's when it happened for the first time.





The moment I looked at the water, I was transported into some weird place. I can't really explain it, rather I don't know how to explain it, but the closest word that I can describe it as is hell. But there's no fire or people burning; there's just a black swirl with a bright, huge yellow eye right in the middle. And I was slowly falling right into it. And as I kept falling into the black swirl, this immense pressure in my chest kept building. My breath kept getting shorter. It felt like my lungs were ready to burst.





And then it said something.





The sound was like a million ship horns blasting at the same time. At first, I didn't understand. And then it said it again. And again. And again. Until I realized what it was saying:





"FFFFEEEEEEEED MMMMMMEEEEEEEE!"





I suddenly woke up. But as I was regaining my wits, I saw it in the water. It was only for a split second before it closed, but I am confident I saw it. The bright yellow eye was almost the size of a small yacht. Before I could comprehend what was going on it disappeared into the black waters.  I immediately threw myself back when I noticed I was leaning on the post. Now I was definitely freaked out. I rushed to bed.





Of course, that didn't help. That thing was in my dreams. I was under the water this time, doing some welding. Then I started to feel the strangest sensation. It felt like there were invisible hands pulling me down. I didn't want to look. I kept staring up. But the pull only got stronger. I went to quickly check down. Within an instant, the ocean floor started opening up. I couldn't make out what was happening. And then I heard it again:





"FEEEEEEEEEEEEED MMMMMMEEEEE!"





It was the only thing it said. I lost my grip and started falling. It felt like I was wearing a suit made of lead. I was sinking faster and faster. I looked down, and there it was - the eye. My breath was getting shorter, and my lungs felt like they were being squeezed. And then everything went black. I thought I had died until I woke up.





I didn't see Mason the next day. Apparently, he was sick, but I am not sure how true that was. I think he saw it too.





Life continued on. As I approached four weeks, I promised myself no more night walks. But the dreams didn't stop. In fact, they only got more intense. I tried to work more to help me forget about that thing. I would pick up any extra hours, but there were only so many hours I could work. I made a deal with myself to get the fuck out of the water as soon as it got dark. It didn't help. I would sometimes zone out and find myself back in that dark place, falling into that swirl helplessly.





I noticed something else as well. I was getting really itchy. But in particular, my feet were starting to itch a lot! I was constantly scratching them. The only time they wouldn't itch, though, was when I was walking. So I kept active and started walking during the day when I had the chance. I would sometimes see Mason on my walks. He seemed like a shell of his former self. Sometime just standing in the middle of the hallway. I think that thing affected him.

  


The itching got worse and worse until one night, I could take it no more. I had to go for a walk. It was rainy that night, but the waves were strangely calm. I made a clear thought not to walk or get close to any railing. I knew that thing was out there, waiting for me - waiting for a fuck up like me to get caught and slip. I kept strolling but noticed something. A figure was standing near the railing. I couldn't make it out at first, but then I realized it could only be one person. It had him again.





I rushed down from the top, at first speeding down to get to him. But the closer I got, the more I started to slow down. It felt like I had been shot with some kind of drug. I saw Mason up ahead. He was leaning far this time. But for some reason, in that moment, I felt a strange calm I had never felt in my life. I still have no idea why. I started strolling down towards him. And then I heard it again:



"FEEEEEEEEEEEED MMMMMMEEEEEEE!"



I wasn't scared this time - no, far from it. I was in utter bliss. The rain felt like it was washing all of my worries and fears away.



"FEEEEEEEEEEEED MMMMMMEEEEEEE!" 



I kept strolling towards him. The logical part of my brain was telling me to get the fuck out of there. I knew it was right, but it felt like my body was on autopilot. My legs almost had a mind of their own.





"FEEEEEEEEEEEED MMMMMMEEEEEEE!"





The closer I got to Mason, the louder the sound got. It felt like my brain was going to crack in half. The sound felt real and imaginary at the same time. The rain didn't help. I kept walking until... I was standing right behind Mason.





"FEEEEEEEEEEEED MMMMMMEEEEEEE!"





Mason was leaning far - very far. I knew what I was going to do next. Rather, I knew what my body was going to do next. The sound was splitting my head in half. The euphoric feeling was gone now. I felt like I was a passenger in my own body. I couldn't move my arms. I couldn't move anything. But I was watching my body react and move anyway. My left arm came up, and with just a slight push, Mason was gone.





It took two seconds for him to disappear into the dark. He didn't scream. He didn't even flail his arms as he fell. He just dropped, like a rock. I stood there for a few seconds, hoping this was another dream. I tried to turn back, but I still couldn't move my body. And then, I saw it.

  


The yellow eye slowly came out of the pitch-black waters. It stared at me. I wish I could put into words how terrifying this was. It almost felt like the entire ocean floor belonged to whatever that thing was. The sound started again in my head. It felt louder than any other time I had heard it. The pain was unbearable.

  


It said something. I thought it would say the same thing as before, but this time it was something else:

  


"Å½Ä˜Ä»Ä˜Ä€ÅšÅšÅšÅšÄ˜Ä˜Ä˜Ä˜Ä˜Ä˜Ä˜!!!."





It didn't sound like English. The pain was too much now. I started throwing up. My body had finally relented, and I was able to move. I immediately fell to the floor. My legs felt like I had walked a thousand miles non-stop. The cramping was too much. My chest felt an immense pressure as if I was submerged under the ocean. I couldn't breathe. The rain was coming down harder.





"Å½Ä˜Ä»Ä˜Ä€ÅšÅšÅšÅšÄ˜Ä˜Ä˜Ä˜Ä˜Ä˜Ä˜!!!!!!!!!!!!!"





As I closed my eyes, I saw something grab onto the rail. I wish I could remember what it looked like. But I know something was there. That was the last thing I remember from that night.





The next day, I remember waking up in my room. I had overslept by an hour. I immediately rushed out, thinking I would be in for a serious chat from my supervisor, but when I got there, everyone was concerned with something else. Apparently, Mason had gone missing.





People reported seeing him last night. Apparently, he told someone that he was going to get some air, which a lot of people found very strange considering it was raining. My heart was racing. The memories from that night started to creep in. I remembered the bliss I felt, and then the slow walk towards him. And then... what I did to him. I still don't believe that was me. I tried multiple times to move or turn the other way. But my body wouldn't listen to me. And then I remembered the sound - how it called to me. And that giant yellow eye under the water watching me.





Nevertheless, he was gone. People searched and searched, but they slowly came to the grim realization. He was declared dead by the end of the week. My heart sank every time I heard his name. I just couldn't take it anymore.





I quit and got on the boat at the end of the month. My supervisor threatened to blacklist me for breach of contract, but I didn't care. I just wanted to get the fuck away from that thing.





I got back home and just started nonstop drinking. I can't remember the last time in two months I haven't been blackout drunk. It doesn't help that much. Every time I sleep, I have that same dream, but it's a little different this time. As I am falling into the pitch black swirl, the eye comes out. But as I look around, I see Mason - falling ahead of me, lifeless and limp, towards that eye.
