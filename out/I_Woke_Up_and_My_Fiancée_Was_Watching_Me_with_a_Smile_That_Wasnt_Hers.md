Something is very wrong, and as absurd as it may seem, I need to tell this. Because if I disappear... it won’t be without reason. And no, I’m not crazy.  
My name is David, I’m 24 years old, I study psychology, and I’m engaged. Her name is Dianna, she’s 22, studying nursing, with beautiful green eyes and lovely wavy brown hair (yes, I’m a very passionate fiancé).  
Yesterday, my fiancée, her parents, and a lawyer came to my house to handle some paperwork.  
They have a large company here in England and want me to take over their business. One of the contracts was written in a strange language, maybe Greek or Russian — I don’t know. I admit I hesitated to sign it, since her parents and she follow a very old religion, as far as I know. Still, I ended up signing the blessed contract.  
Even though part of me begged not to sign, I did. But I copied down some symbols from the contract. If anyone knows what they mean, please tell me. I wrote it on a paper and searched on Google but couldn’t translate it yet for lack of time. If anyone has free time: Δέχομαι να γίνω η θυσία σου. There was also another symbol I couldn’t copy here.  
My fiancée stayed over last night. I’m writing this while she’s in the shower. I don’t want her to think I’m paranoid or crazy, but strange things have happened since yesterday.  
She woke up in the middle of the night and stood by the foot of the bed, with a macabre, malicious smile. When I realized and asked what she was doing, she just smiled even more and said:  
— Oh, darling... you will be perfect for him. I can almost see him in you.  
Who the hell is “him”?  
At least during the day, she acted normal. But when night fell, she got strange again, asking if I wasn’t excited to meet him, staring at me from the corners of the house.  
But what made me decide to write here was what I noticed in her eyes: they are more brown than green. That scares me. What if she’s no longer my fiancée, but something else?  
I know it sounds strange, but she is different...  
Since then, something has changed in me too. I can’t explain it well, but I feel a strange calm, as if part of me has already surrendered to something I don’t understand.  
Last night, I woke up in the middle of the night, feeling a cold wind that wasn’t coming from the window, and I heard a whisper that seemed to come from inside the house — or maybe from inside me.  
I couldn’t understand the words, but there was a force in the voice, something ancient and powerful, that made me freeze in fear.  
Dianna wasn’t in bed when I woke up. I searched everywhere, but she was in the bathroom, with the shower running, and even so, that cold seemed to surround me.  
When I left the room, I felt that presence again — a void that spread through the house, silent, as if someone was watching my every move.  
But there was no one. Just the shadow of something I can’t name.  
I don’t know what’s happening, but I’m afraid of what’s to come.  
If this is a nightmare, I don’t know how to wake up.  
And if it’s not... then I can only wait for what “he” has prepared for me.
