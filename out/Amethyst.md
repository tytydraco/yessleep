“What the fuck is that supposed to mean?”

I tell her I don’t know what I’m saying anymore. I’m out of my mind. Clarissa just watches me as I pack up my things while she sits on the couch smoking her invisible cigarettes. Only she can see the smoke. She tells me we’ve been doing this too long and we should stop because we don’t know the first thing about this stuff, nor does anyone, or what it’s actually doing to our insides. All we know is that we can’t stop, because if we stop, we’ll become immortal, and nobody wants that.

Amethyst is kind of like an amphetamine, but instead of the spiders you would normally see crawling on your skin after binging on, say, crystal, you can feel the webs. You can hardly move your fingers because they’re all tied up in them, and sometimes you can’t open your eyes. I wouldn’t dare stop.

My first stop is at a man’s house named Dave. Dave isn’t his real name but ever since I introduced him to Amethyst, it’s what he calls himself. When I get to his house, I find him huddled in the corner of his bedroom holding a light pink balloon. It’s his birthday, he tells me. The balloon isn’t a real balloon, but actually the soul of his mother who’s been dead for 12 years. “Hello Gail,” I say, greeting the balloon. Dave begins to laugh while he tells me his mouth is dry like those little towels you get at the convenience store, and I am perplexed. I go to get both of us a drink because I am the same. We both take a drink, but like always, the water just glides over the surfaces of our tongues without making any contact, leaving them dry. My thirst could not be quenched and the thought of this always make me laugh hysterically.

Then, Dave pulls out the first rock, glossy and purple, and tells me he wants to try snorting it this time. “You can’t snort it, Dave. Don’t you remember? If you snort it, you will become immortal.” His eyes widen and he gasps before he says, “Oh, and nobody wants that.” It wasn’t until Dave suddenly started to cry that I headed for the door.

My next stop is at a woman’s house who I had briefly dated in my past life. When I open the door, I find her sitting drunk at the breakfast bar of her one-bedroom apartment. I can hardly see since the lights are off except a pink lava lamp beside her, and it smells like Manhattan in the summer. When I sit down beside her, she glances over at the bag hanging out of my pocket and nods like she didn’t know what it was. I pull it out to give to her but before I can make the gesture, she ravenously snatches it from my hands. When I tell her the price, she simply laughs at me and says, “Nobody pays for Amethyst anymore, you should know that by now.” “Oh yeah,” I say, remembering now. She begins sifting through the purple shards, sniffing it. “Good stuff today, did you make this batch yourself?” she says, still sniffing it. I tell her no, not this time. Clarissa spent the entire night in her room meticulously working since she wanted to get it just right. The woman yawned and shut her eyes, and she says, “Tell me again Anthony... Tell me the story of how she was born.” “How was who born?” I asked initiating a pause that lasted over an hour.

“Amethyst.”

She asks me to tell her the same story every time I sell to her, so I roll my eyes, and I begin... It was a light grey morning in the winter of 1917, I say. China. The war was ending and the revolution had just started to make its turn. The President at the time, now supported by Parliament, appointed as acting Premier, and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Wu Ting-Fang Yuan – was on acid. On his trip, he was swimming in the Yellow Jade River where he’d met his dear friend Anthony, that’s me. I told him he shouldn’t be swimming without a life jacket but he assured me it was okay because he’s protected by the aura he’d acquired during the war. Minutes after he’d told me about the aura, I began to see it. I began to feel it with my every being, and then my inner soul. It was bright blue, and it was magnetic. The magnetic field grew stronger as the day went on, and as the day turned into night, the electric current became indomitable. The stars aligned and collided into us. The river turned red and the blue aura spread far and wide to the edges of the Earth. The Yellow Jade River was no more.

And from thereon in, there was only Amethyst.

When I finish telling the story, I sigh and check if the woman beside me is still awake. She isn’t. It wasn’t until I realized she was no longer breathing that I headed for the door.

The hallway of her apartment building is filled with balloons and I realize it’s somebody’s birthday. I light an imaginary cigarette in celebration and begin to walk towards the end of the hall. The balloons moved across the walls and seemed to follow me as I walked. Their shapes shifted from squares to circles, triangles, and back to squares. I can faintly see my mother at the end of the hallway. Naturally, I try to avoid her, but it is just my luck that she sees me too quickly and asks me how I’m doing. “How’s college?” she screams. Thankfully, I make it out of the building before she demands a response.

On the way back to my apartment, each piece of the sidewalk I stepped on seemed to shatter away. I became terrified because I didn’t want to fall through but jolts of electricity passed through me when I tried to run. I was suddenly tackled and a man’s voice informed me of The Law. I didn’t know what was happening. I couldn’t see. Soon, my hands were bound behind my back and I was on a train that barely moved. It just touted us along but really any of us could have walked and gotten there faster.

I’m now lying in a bed in a pure white room, and for a brief moment of clarity, I realize I’m in a hospital. A nurse approaches me and tells me everything is going to be alright, but even I, the deranged psychopath who smokes imaginary cigarettes in the Yellow Jade River, know that is a lie. The nurse begins to hook me up to a multitude of medical apparatus, the most painful of all being the catheter in my dick. The pain is more than I can take, but I can’t move for the spider webs become restraints on my body. I just sit there and stare at the needle in my arm as the water turns red with my blood, and I’m scared.

For the first time in many years, I feel that I actually have clarity and can perceive my surroundings. For the first time since as long as I can remember, I know what is happening. I look into the nurse’s eyes and ask her once again to reassure me that everything is going to be alright, but she doesn’t speak this time. I look deeper into her eyes, and the longer I look, the deeper I see. The nurse is Clarissa! I want to scream out to her and ask how she could do this to me, but I can no longer speak. My lips are sealed. Slowly, she begins to fade away along with everything else in the room. One by one, the medical apparatus dissipates. The door closes and all I can see are the white walls and the white ceiling.

And from thereon in, there was only Amethyst.
