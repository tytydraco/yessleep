I think this is the right place. My sister's talked about this place. Don't mind the name, and don't mind the post history, I don't feel comfortable even so much as making a throwaway for this but my sister is a writer by trade and she feels like this may be therapeutic for me, so she's given me permission to use her account. If she knew what I had to say, she probably wouldn't.

My name is… well, just call me Tony. I'm your everyday average third generation Italian guy, with a Grandpop from Old Napoli, living here in New York City all my life. I grew up in Little Italy, but after a stint in the Upstate due to a… pharmaceutical issue, my grandmother isn't so fond of me being around anymore, so after I finished my parole living with my sister on the East Side, my sister helped me get this place down here in Gravesend by myself for the first time in my life. 

It's a pretty nice neighborhood, if you think about it. The trains can be kind of loud, but Coney Island is just down the street and I can get a real Nathan's Hot Dog anytime I want. The population is mostly Jewish and Italian, with some immigrants scattered here and there, like everywhere else in NYC. 

I live in an ancient three story apartment building just down the street from a bodega named Rhee's, and to the left of a hardware store named Rossi's and directly across the street from a restaurant named Mino's on Avenue U. They've got good food. It isn't even that fancy of a place,but the chef will have you believing you've taken a trip to Old Italia to try some authentic Neapolitan pizza. And the prices are good,which is always a plus for an ex-con who hasn't yet found a job that the owner hasn't flinched as soon as the word Felon falls out of my big mouth. 

My sis is good to me, she's sending me all the royalties off of her seventh novel, but I am getting kind of antsy living off of handouts, and I had made a promise to myself I was going to do what I had to do, grow up, and take care of myself. 

Of course, I've never done any good at thinking on an empty stomach, and Mino's opens early everyday to serve a normal American breakfast menu, and there's nothing like sausage and eggs and a stack of pancakes to make you feel like things are alright for just a little while. 

A very short while, but we'll get back to that. 

It was very early. The restaurant opened to the public at 6 AM and I wanted to get an early start on my job search, so as soon as the lights came on, I was there outside the door. The owner, Jimmy, let me in with a laugh and a flourish toward the booths in the second dining room. He was a skinny looking guy in his 40s, the kind of guy that you can tell works out most everyday, but can't put on bulk to save his life. He was balding, but he always wore a nicely tailored suit and a smile that never quite reached his eyes. My sister calls it shark mouth, a million teeth shining under an empty, dark gaze, you're just waiting for the white membrane to come down and the chomping to start. 

"Early day, Ton'?" 

"Yeah, Jimmy. Just headed out to do a bit of a job search and I want to get a good start." 

He nods, but I can already tell he isn't listening because *she* came out of the bathroom at just that time. I didn't know her name then, but she was a tiny blonde that barely hit five nothing barefoot. She was always wearing tall red-bottomed stilettos and smart business suits, and carrying this expensive leather briefcase. She was a knockout, frankly, athletic and curvy in the right different spots, but she was miles out of my league and I'd never even attempted to say hello to her. She ate here everyday, even on the days I didn't, because I would see her leaving the restaurant at various hours as I sat and smoked at my bedroom window. 

Jimmy diverted his attention back to me and I mumbled my order while I watched the blonde seat herself in her usual booth, the calves blood leather briefcase sitting just to the side of her tiny feet.

"No problem. Coming right up." He clapped me on the shoulder and I flinched under the weight of it. The guy was a lot stronger than he looked, and surprisingly that little slap on my back sent me, a 275 pound man, stumbling forward just a bit. 

He didn't seem to notice as he practically floated across the room to the only other customer that morning and, I assumed, took her order, too. After that, he went back into the kitchen and started speaking to his staff, I could hear the braying Brooklyn accents over the roar of gas flames and the clatter of pots and pans.

I sat down in my own booth and flipped through the local news on my phone. There had been a body found floating near Battery Park a few days ago, one early morning by a jogger as usual. 

I'll tell you, that's why the only place I'll jog in this city is on the treadmill in my apartment. 

I guess the body wasn't all that unusual just… the state of it. It had been mutilated. Eyes removed, tongue removed,missing organs, missing patches of skin and muscle, missing genitals, all the bones there though, perfect and unbroken, just… no teeth, and no feet and no hands. And this was the fourth such body found in this state. NYC officially had a new serial killer on the scene.

NYPD were hoping for DNA to give them some clue as to the identity of the victim, and they had a forensic sketch artist try to recreate his face in a drawing that had been released at the press conference yesterday. 

Jimmy came by at about this time with a steaming plate of waffles for the blonde, and my mini breakfast buffet balanced between his two hands. He made it look easy, dipping like a dancer to place her plate on the table without ever making my platter of food wobble. He came to me next, and even though I ordered first, I didn't mind. Ladies first, after all.

I cut my link sausages into four even pieces each and started on my pancakes as I scrolled down the page to the sketch that had been provided by the artist. 

You ever heard that saying, that the food turns to sawdust in your mouth? Well, that's what happened when I saw that sketch. I knew this guy. He lives in an apartment the floor below mine with several of his brothers. He's a Polish immigrant with a thick accent and a lot of Russian prison tattoos. He works at a dry cleaners in Greenpoint. His name is Antoni Zabrowska or… well, I guess it used to be. His name is John Doe #4 now, another victim of what the news is trying to call the East River Eater. Apparently the bones had… gnawing marks, in places, like… from teeth. And not animal teeth, *human teeth*. 

There's a 20,000 dollar reward for information on any of the four victims' identities, but… let's just say the police make me a little nervous, so I probably wasn't going to be the first call to the precinct that they got, no matter what I knew. 

I choked down my food with a large sip of scalding, damned good coffee and looked over to my fellow breakfast patron. She was happily humming to herself with a voice that sounded like the ringing of a tiny bell, pouring a dark red strawberry syrup over her waffles and nibbling daintily on the pieces. The song was somehow comforting to me after the little digital shock I had just had, I recognized it as a Carassimi tune, *No, Non Si Speri*. 

My grandmother had always played opera from old vinyls as she ran about the apartment cleaning, and somehow that song made me feel a sense of peace, and settled the pit in my stomach. I continued my breakfast, and switched over to a job listing site to decide which place I was going to get rejected from first today.

My scrolling was interrupted as Jimmy appeared behind me and nearly knocked my coffee out of my hand with another clap to my shoulder. 

"Hey, kid. I gotta take off over to my cousin's across the street. I want you to do me a favor. You said you needed a job, I'll give you three hundred bucks to watch this place for the next hour. Anybody comes in, you take their order and pass it to Joey in the back, and you carry it out to them when he rings the bell. You know where the drink machines and coffee carafes are. Oh, and keep an eye on my girl over there. She needs a refill or anything, you see to it she's taken care of. No charge for the meal, you want more just ask for it."

He's holding three crisp hundred dollar bills under my nose and I almost can't believe my luck. Three hundred bucks for an hour of taking orders in a slow restaurant. Maybe I can find a decent suit in a resale shop and I can get some better interviews, hell, maybe I'll have enough left over for one of Mino's pizzas and a good bottle of bourbon with my Netflix tonight.

"Sure, man, no problem. Anything you need."

"Now, that's what I like to hear." Jimmy hands me the bills and I stand and stuff them in my jeans pocket and reach out to shake his hand. As soon as his fingers close around mine, I regret it. My bones bend inward, crushing together under the weight of his grip, and it's all I can do to keep from wincing like a little girl. How does a guy that skinny get that strong? I really gotta ask him about his exercise routine. 

He gives my hand a shake and I discreetly wiggle the feeling back into my fingers as he lets me go. He says nothing else to me as three more men in suits just as nice as Jimmy's come out of the kitchen. One slips an expensive looking wool coat over Jimmy's shoulders, and the second opens the door for him, and they all exit. 

The lumps under their suit jackets say they're armed. 

I see them heading across the street to Rossi's Hardware Store. Huh, I never knew Pops Rossi was related to Jimmy. I knew him as a Chiellini. Pops is a nice old man, with white hair and a close cropped beard. His adopted daughter Becca works at the bodega. I always thought it was kind of strange Becca had been adopted while her father was still alive, but Sam Rhee was stinking drunk half the time,and Becca had a tendency to get in trouble easily so maybe a calm, steady presence like Rossi's is to her benefit.

Jimmy's kind of a weird dude, kind of shady, but hey, I've never made easier money, and I've done some questionable things for money in my time. I finish my coffee and head over to the bank of drink machines at the back of the room to refill it. 

As I pass by the blonde's table, I clear my throat and she looks up to me with possibly the most beautiful green eyes I've ever seen in my life. They're dark like olive around the outside, nearly blue in the middle, and a ring of hazel around the pupil that looks yellow in the golden chandelier light from over her booth. It takes me a second or two to realize she's responded to me.

"Yes? Can I help you?" There's a strange accent to the words, I can't pinpoint the country of origin but it says to me English isn't her first language.

I smell the sickly heavy scent of strawberry syrup and a much lighter floral and musk perfume coming from her. It's intoxicating. 

"I, uh, I mean, it's more like can I help you? Jimmy asked me to keep an eye on you while he's out, and I just wanted to see if you needed anything while I was up." 

Her cherubic little lips turn down in a frown. 

"Jimmy's left? I do hope he doesn't get into any trouble this morning." 

I don't know what that means exactly, and she still hasn't answered me as to whether she needs anything, so I clear my throat again. 

"So uh… you a writer or something? My sister's a writer." I gesture to the many typed pages laid out on the table in a circle around her plate of waffles. 

She laughs, another bell-like sound.

"Oh no, I'm a lawyer. Looking over some notes before a trial next week." 

"Ah, lawyer. That's a complicated job. Good luck on the trial."

She smiles at me again. Her teeth are straight and white like a little line of pearls. 

"Oh, I don't need luck. The prosecution has dropped the ball with this one, it's only a matter of time before I get it thrown out. Their star witness didn't even show up to the last court date." She speaks pleasantly, like she's discussing the weather. A tiny, delicate hand holds out a clear water goblet to me. "A sprite if you please, extra sugar."

Extra sugar in a soda? I try to keep the expression on my face neutral, but it's kind of a strange request… but hey, I'm getting three hundred dollars for this, so if she wants to drink herself into a diabetic coma, then that's on her. 

I take the goblet from her. The momentary contact with her fingers is electrifying, even though her skin is chilled from the cold glass. 

I clear my throat again and head to the drink machines before I make a fool of myself. I pour my coffee and then her sprite, adding the sugar to mine and then hers. I stir it as much as I can, but it's difficult, if not nigh impossible, to get sugar to dissolve in cold liquid, so the sugar just forms a thick layer at the bottom of the goblet as I bring it back to her. She stirs it again herself with her fork, takes a large sip of the swirling sugar floating in the soda, and nods approvingly.  

"Tell Joey I would like another plate. And more syrup please, I've run out." 

"Yes ma'am," I answer with a smile, place my coffee on my table, grab the glass syrup dispenser off of her's and head back into the kitchen. I see an open door beside the walk-in refrigerator and the cook is standing in the morning dark with a lit cigarette and a cup of coffee in the other hand. He only looks at me for a second before he jerks his head toward the stove. 

"Waffles are in the warmer. Syrup's in the fridge on the left. Shake it up before you pour it. It gets thick." 

With that, he turns his back on me and takes another drag off his cigarette. Well, I wasn't exactly expecting a Welcome Party so I can't say his cold attitude really bothers me, especially not when I see the nine millimeter sitting in the small of his back, tucked just under his chef smock, and the three tear drops tattooed just under his eye. If he doesn't want a conversation, I'm not going to push it. 

I open the doors of the warmer over the stove and take out the plate of waffles. They give off a sweet vanilla scent, and the plate warms my hand pleasantly as I open the walk in and make my way inside. To the left, he said. I find a gallon jug of the thick syrup sitting on a wire shelving system. I set the plate and the syrup dispenser down on the shelf as I pick up the jug. Gets thick, he said… he wasn't kidding, it's almost… lumpy. 

I give it a hard shake and the liquid sloshes around, much heavier and thicker than regular pancake syrup. I concentrate hard on not spilling any as I pour it into the dispenser. 

I can hear it over the roar of the fridge fan,a gunshot, and a shotgun blast. Now, it's not the first time I've heard a gun shot in this city, but that's not all I hear. I hear screaming, muffled, but a woman's screams and the sound of loud male Slavic-accented voices yelling from behind me, back inside the restaurant. 

I peek out from behind the fridge door. Joey, the cook, or what's left of him, is laying just before the door. Most of his head is gone, brain matter and blood pooling around the sunken hole of his face. The nine millimeter is laying right in front of me, having slid out of his limp dead hand and I grab for it reflexively. 

It's slick with blood and my hands are shaking, but I try my best to hold onto it and make my way around the stainless steel tables in the center of the room. I've never even shot one of these before, but the blonde waiting for her waffles is screaming and Jimmy paid me three hundred to keep an eye on her. 

I peek through the circular window in the top of the swinging door that enters the kitchen. There are two large men, they have the blonde between them, dragging her out of the booth as she screams, kicks and flails.

She's tiny, they have no problem picking her up. I know these guys, the Zabrowska brothers, my downstairs neighbors. I've never killed anyone in my life but the big one, Misiu, has a knife in his hand and he's driving it toward the blonde's throat as the smaller one grabs a handful of her hair and jerks her head back.

I burst through the door and aim as best I can, and fire. I miss… because Misiu's head isn't there anymore. 

The blonde raked her nails across his face, digging her fingers into the sockets of his eyes and… tore his head off. It lands with a thump on top of the table and now the smaller brother is the one screaming. 

The blonde releases a growl, an unnatural rumbling sound that makes my blood turn cold, and tosses the smaller brother over her shoulder. Her clawed hands find the sides of his head and it is only a second longer before I hear the wrenching, tearing sound of flesh being removed from spine and his head is on the floor now, rolled under the table and staring at me from beside her briefcase. 

The pistol clatters out of my hand and I stand frozen in the open doorway.

There is an eyeball still left punctured on one well-manicured nail. She pops it into her mouth like an olive, and swallows.

()()()()

I've been sitting here in this booth, not moving. She's got the gun trained on me but I don't think she needs it to keep me in line. 

Jimmy came back not thirty minutes later. He was bleeding from a gunshot in his abdomen, and the two suited men with him nearly carried him inside, locking the door behind them and drawing all the shades. His face is gray and his hoarse breathing says the man needs to be at a hospital, not being stretched out on a restaurant table. Another man arrives a minute or so later, pulling antiseptic and a pair of forceps out of a black leather bag. 

Jimmy screams as they fish a slug out of his stomach and the blonde has forgotten about guarding me. 

I can't bring myself to try to run. 

She stands at the head of the table, and uses the knife the men tried to use to take her head off to slit open her wrist. She presses the wound to Jimmy's open mouth and he gulps like a dehydrated man being offered sweet water. As I sit and watch, the hole in his stomach grows smaller, and finally closes. It isn't easy, the man screams, muffled by her flesh, and convulses like he's being electrocuted, but finally she pulls her wrist away with a hiss and he gulps in air, no longer sounding like the death rattles he first came in with. 

They let me go, eventually. Sent me home with another thousand dollars for guarding the place while they were gone. Bianchi, the blonde, Jimmy says she likes me, and she'd like to see me stick around. 

"I mean, hey, you said you needed a job. Looks like I got an Associate position that just opened up. Perfect for you. Not like I can let you go walk away after what you've seen. We start at five in the morning. Be ready." 

Bianchi stands just behind Jimmy, her bloodstained hands petting over the smooth skin of his scalp like he's a pet she's trying to soothe.

I'm sitting in my apartment now, typing this into my cheap laptop and trying to hope I just hallucinated this entire thing. But… I don't think so. I keep looking at the police tip number and trying to decide whether 20K will be enough to get me and my sister out of the City before Jimmy notices I'm gone but… I don't think there's any point. 

I know who has been eating people in the East River, and I'm not sure the police would even believe me if I told them.
