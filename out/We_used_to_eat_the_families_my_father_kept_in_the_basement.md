He always used to put a particular emphasis on dinner, and what we ate during it. Only the foods he deemed "healthy" were allowed, much to the dismay of our young minds. I remember the other school kids taunting me with the exotic-sounding foods they would be allowed to eat, and even the mundane fast food places sounded like the most gourmet of restaurants to me. You wouldn't believe the things I would have done to try a shitty McDonald's cheeseburger. 





Dinner was served at 8 PM sharp every day of the week. If we weren't home, we were expected to be and on the rare occasion somebody skimped out - like that one time my brother stayed at a friend's place a little too long - the consequences were bad enough to deter us from trying again any time soon. I do have to admit that we were quite privileged and grew up in a large home with a great big dining room that happened to be the location of our dinners. A large table stretched out across it and it was furnished with expensive-looking china and fancy fabrics, although these simply provided the background to the food itself. Mother was always stressed in the hours leading up to eight and her footsteps could be heard pattering back and forth as she carried plate after plate into the dining room. Plates filled to the brim with oysters, caviar, squid, heaps and heaps of greens, far too much red wine and five plates adorned with a single chunk of meat. Father said meat was the most important part of dinner, that we had to eat it so we could grow big and strong. 





So we did. 





We feasted on the decadent foods provided to us and at the very end of each meal we simultaneously stuck our forks into the meat before us and devoured it in one bite. Father always said, "*One bite is only polite*". 





"*Polite to who, Father?*" we protested. 





He would never answer. 





Despite the oddity of it all looking back, it never struck us as more than a simple difference in tradition back when we were kids. Sure, it would have been nice to have had no restrictions as our friends and peers seemed to, but we were always very well fed and otherwise well taken care of. As I mentioned earlier, the house we lived in was extremely nice and we never had to worry about much as we grew from young children into our older teen years and all the anxieties that can come with that. 





The only thing I really hated was the noises. You know, things that go bump in the night. Ghosts, demons, whatever you want to call them. I believed in it all and the house only ever fueled that little fear of mine. As I tossed and turned in bed I would occasionally hear footsteps slapping against concrete, or the sound of a child's muffled cry. Sometimes the noises would slip into my dreams and nightmares too, so Mother and Father always used that to explain them away when I'd show up at their bedroom door asking to sleep with them for the night. I knew the noises were real though, even if I didn't know where they were coming from. As I grew older, I learned to ignore them. They became a form of white noise, a backing band of cries and quiet shuffles for my foregrounded life. 





Time went by pretty fast towards the end of my teen years, and the dinner tradition continued which made living a normal college-aged life difficult. I wanted to go to a party? Dinner made it hard. I wanted to travel for a little while? Dinner made it impossible. Eventually, I had enough and decided that I needed to take my life into my own hands which was a tough decision to make given Father's wishes imposed on my own but it needed to be made. After a long few months of constant arguments and fights, I moved out. 





That last night it felt as if the house itself was pleading with me. Begging me to stay. Screaming at me. I stared up at my ceiling all night whilst the constant sound of muffled voices and feet pattering kept sleep far out of reach. At times I could almost make out words, words that sounded like cries for help. I tried to rationalise it if only to keep my own fear in check, but before long I decided that there wasn't much to lose from trying to find the source - especially given it was to be my last night there in quite a while. So with a great deal of fear and hesitation, I slipped out of bed and grabbed a flashlight to explore. 





As my bare feet tip-toed across the wooden floor, it felt as if the noises were growing louder. Beckoning to me. They'd never been this loud before. Eventually, I found the rusty set of steps that led to the seldom-spoken-of basement. Mother and Father always emphasised that we were never to go down to the basement, and it was the only rule of theirs that went untested. Not because of their promises of severe consequences, but because the little hatch that led to the steps had always been out of reach thanks to the large padlock that kept it bolted shut. The hatch happened to be located in the part of the house that scared me the most too given its darkness and unkempt state, so I never had reason to be there anyway.





That night, I found the hatch open. Ever so slightly, just enough for somebody who walked past to notice. Enough for me to notice. The noises that had guided me there suddenly reverted to their status as white noise whilst my heart pounded loud enough for it to be heard. The hair on my arms and neck stood up as I felt my foot against the first wooden step. I took my second step down. Then my third. By the time I felt my feet touch the cold concrete ground in the depths of the basement I lost count. But that was far from my first concern. 





Almost as soon as I took that final step I heard the familiar sound of feet shambling towards me. The place was lit by a single dim bulb that bathed it in a yellow that exposed the cracks in the walls and provided enough light to outline the young man who had walked up to me. He must've been in his early 20s at best and had a look of pure fear in his deep eyes. He pointed towards the far corner and my eyes darted over to a group of 4 other people. A young man and woman who I placed at a similar age to the one next to me, an older man and an older woman. All of them looked extraordinarily healthy for what looked like an imprisoned existence and unclean plates piled up next to them.





A family.





Instinctively, I went to scream. A hand was over my mouth in an instant whilst the four in the corner each held a singular finger to their lips. Before long the Father of the family explained the situation as I tried my best to sob without creating the mass of noise I so desperately wanted to. He told of how they had been taken in their sleep and woken up there one by one. How they were being fed leftovers of exquisite quality by the man upstairs. How they knew he was fattening them up for the slaughter even though he hadn't explicitly told them that. I asked them to describe the man even though I knew what they would tell me, an effort to avoid facing reality I suppose. The man I knew as Father. They showed me around their living quarters, showed me the human bones they found scattered across each corner. A constant reminder of what they believed to be an inevitable fate. 





My tongue went dry as the realisation set in. For my entire life, I'd been eating the flesh that slid off the bones that were now around me. Lives, souls, *people*. The poor people around me had to once again calm me down, and I eventually did if only with their future well-being in mind. I admired their bravery in calling me there yet felt a tremendous guilt for the others who had called me there in years gone by. They deserved better. Eventually, we formed a line with myself sandwiched between the various family members and made our way up the steps. The pitter-patter of feet only intensified the regret that clouded my mind, bringing back memories of the bumps in the night I'd only ever ignored. By the time we crept along in a single-file line I decided to go with them, wherever they may go. Naturally, I knew where the quickest exit would be and after guiding them there we each took off in the direction of town. Some of them struggled to keep up given the various states of bloating they'd found themselves in, but we stuck with each other and eventually made it to the police station. 





An ambulance was called for the mother and son of the family, who I have come to know as Penelope and Noah, because of injuries obscured by the adrenaline of their escape and police formalities then took the focus. I helped in any way I could, and the ensuing investigation was extremely arduous. Beyond the bones I'd seen for myself, the authorities eventually various mismatched personal effects belonging to three families and several single men and women. Anything and everything from tattered bank cards to old flannels to odd shoes. Entire bloodlines eviscerated. They say that there could be more and by this point, the possibility isn't something I can afford to discount. Supposedly it all began right around when I was born and my siblings were toddlers, which is why we can all remember those chunks of meat as ever-present. He preserved the corpses in a custom-built cold room adjacent to the basement and the single chunk servings meant there was always ample supply. They say some of the victims may never be identified. I hope they forgive us for what we did to them.





The night of the escape, the authorities went into our home to investigate and found everything mentioned above in the basement along with various forms of evidence that we never quite picked up scattered across the rest of the house. They found two bloody corpses in the master bedroom, too. I suppose Mother and Father caught wind of what was coming and he slit her throat before turning a shotgun on himself. They didn't leave a note, and I wouldn't have read it anyway. I can only hope the poor souls sentenced to such awful fates by his hand and her blind eyes haven't forgiven them. I let the police break the news to my siblings and naturally their reactions were similar to mine, and sadly we've drifted apart since. I can't quite put a finger on why, but I think we all need some time alone for a while. 





It's been a few months since my life was turned upside down, and I've been trying to move forward. 





The shuffling of feet and the muffling of cries still haunt me though, and I fear the noises will never stop.
