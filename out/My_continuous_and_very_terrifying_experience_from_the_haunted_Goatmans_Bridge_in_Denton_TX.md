Hi. for reference I am a 24 year old F.

Okay, I am going to start out by apologizing for not adding any photos, tangible proof, or deep history lessons here. I would appreciate if you all could not accuse me of lying or being mentally ill. This is 100% true. You must take me at my word because this is still an ongoing experience in me, and I am physically affected every day by ongoing nausea, especially when I look at the photos or talk about the history of this haunted place. I am trying my best to avoid making matters worse. I feel grueling resistance as I am typing this, and am fighting the nausea right at this moment, so I hope you can understsand.

Last Sunday was Father's Day. I was with my boyfriend, my mom and my dad, sitting at the dinner table, eating, when the topic of ghost hunting came up. My boyfriend (Let's call him B) and I love this type of thing. Neither of us are particularly religiousâ€”we are a couple of open-minded, curious  agnosticsâ€”so the idea that spirits could exist and possibly show themselves to us excites us very much.

We had heard about this Goatman's Bridge, officially known as Old Alton Bridge, from a couple sources: friends, Ghost Adventures TV show, and other articles online. We also live relatively close to the location. Please, please look up the history yourself. Just Google "Goatman's Bridge, Denton, history". I will tell you it is KKK related gruesome violence, leading to the death of a successful African American that lived nearby. Every time I read about it now, I feel like I am going to puke.

SOOOO ANYWAYS, WE DECIDED TO GO. My dad has never encountered a spirit before, and this place seemed to be a very popular spot for ghost hunting. We went at about 10pm, a prime time to explore the bridge and hike the trails with little interruption. The bridge at first was empty and seemed a bit spooky, but we didn't see anything out of the ordinary there.

We then hiked a couple different trails nearby. The first one was completely fine. no activity. The second trail, we saw a pair of glowing eyes in the distance when I shone my flashlight in that direction. We all think it was a deer though.

Third trail. We came up to this very scary-looking, grafitti-covered structure. It had words like We All Die, it had 2 pentagrams within the letters of that. There were stars across the top of it with fake blood dripping from every other one and it also had a number of symbols and words that none of us (or Google lens) could decipher. Although, we all did see my nicknameâ€”Jenâ€”written, slightly hidden, within another acronym (I forgot what it was and I'm not gonna look at the pictures right now sorry). Later, B had dug some more online and found out that the structure is actually an alter that had been used for animal sacrifices. And is still being used in rituals by a modern group called the "dark KKK".

All in all, the most exciting part about going to the place itself was me tripping over a root and bruising both my kneesðŸ˜… (yeahhh so kinda boring). the only paranormal activity that the 3 of us had witnessed was my dad expressing he felt an unexplainable quick tap on his back a few yards from the altar.

So we go back to the bridge, and to our surprise about 4 or 5 men (white, early 20s) were sitting on the spider infested bridge, smoking cigarettes and remaining unusually silent. I honestly don't know why anyone would hang out there at midnight and not have flashlights or anything, but hey maybe they're just kind of weird who knows. I didnt have a very good feeling about them though.

AS SOON as I got in the car, I felt like I was going to puke. I was not sick with any illness. I am not sick now either. At first I believed it was and is a visceral reaction to the haunted place.

Now. I know it was, and is, something more.

When we got home, I was in immense pain, unspeakable, excruciating nausea. I went to go wash my hands in the bathroom. When I looked at my reflection, I didn't recognize myself. I was looking into someone else's eyes. I met the gaze of someone violent. Someone with immense hate. It was not my reflection. Rather, someoneâ€”or somethingâ€”was using my body to see through me.

I know it sounds crazy, but it just gets crazier. I apologize on some of these upcoming details. I was not in control of my body or mind at this time. My memory of this part is almost dreamlike. B could see that something had changed in me. He told me to lie down because the nausea was making me lightheaded and very dizzy.

I remember B asking me a series of questions. I don't remember most, but I do remember saying that I am not Jen. I remember how my hate-filled gaze felt resting on B's eyes. I remember my dog not coming over to me like she usually does. I remember telling B that I was unsure of whether he should stay or not, because I was afraid I would hurt him. Physically. I felt extremely violent. To the point that I was digging my nails into my hands as hard as I could, but could feel no pain. I remember wanting to break his hand when I was holding it. I remember fixating on a wall filled with very old photo's of my ancestors. And having a feeling that whatever is in me, is trying to learn how to become me.

I still think that last feeling I mentioned is lingering in me even today. The next day I woke up and couldn't shake the thought that I had this "new body". I tried doing things I don't normally do. I was testing my pleasures, my body, its limits.

I think whatever took over my body is mostly gone. It is a possibility that I may be in fact haunting my own psyche since that night as a reaction to try to cope. But both B and I KNOW. That something took hold of me that night. And I am paying for that every day now.

By the way, I took pictures with my DSLR, some with flash and without. In almost every photo, if you zoomed all the way in you could see at least one red strange-looking pixel lurking in different parts of the photo. I have absolutely no clue if this is a camera related issue or not. But I become more physically ill the longer I look at them. Does anyone know if this is normal for taking raw night photos on a Canon Rebel T3i? The red dots showed up in both images with flash and without flash (so totally dark).

So as you know B did more digging on Google after this whole thing, and he actually found out that women typically have had stronger paranormal experices or reactions at Goatman's Bridge and could be related to this evil spirit named Steve? I do not wish to say anymore about that, so please feel free to look it up.

If anyone has a good cure for nausea besides Pepto or weed, that would be greatly appreciated. Also cures for getting rid of these lingering psychological effects that resulted from that night would be nice too. Open to any discussions or questions/recommendations. Thanks.
