**My first story. Feel free to criticize if you want to. Enjoy!**



Did you hear that?

"What?" Hiroki chimed, his eyebrow slightly arching upwards as he looked back at me, giving me his signature disinterested look as usual whenever he heard something that wasn't either something Outdoorsy like tree-climbing or rock-collecting or beetle-scaling or whatever.

Sarah kept pacing forward alongside the group, her misty green eyes appearing almost a smokey gray from the meager amount of light that illuminated us from the lantern that I was holding. Various discarded leaves and twigs lined the eminent forest, artifacts of a long-forgotten Summer that ended just four weeks ago. Herzen Forest was now a cacophony of red, orange, and yellow tones, the maple trees shaded ever so slightly differently from the other maple forests in the state, which was why we, as mentally well-endowed 15-year-olds, are now exploring it together, after having eschewed it every single time we hit the intersection at Avre Creek, always taking the long walk to the general store instead of taking the narrow, twisting, harrow route through the Old Trail 26.

"I... I think I heard something?" I awkwardly spit out, doubting myself immediately. This wasn't the first time my mind had played tricks on me. Or my ears. Either way, none of my other senses had picked up anything, confounding any additional suspicions about the noise.

As we passed the low-hanging boulders and curtain of abscissing maple trees, the abject monotony of the twilight forest once again swept our ears, only intermittently interrupted by the sounds of us stepping on a twig or two every 10 seconds or so.

Hiroki continued onwards soldierly, not hinting at any sense of leisure or loitering in this part of the forest any more than his friends were dragging him into. Sarah, on the other hand, pressed onwards, looking around absently as I trailed behind them, weary and questioning my own sanity.



Did you hear that?



"...What?" Sarah uttered, glimpsing back at me with a mix of weariness and a skeptic dread that one would expect when traversing a forest with only 2 other people.



"Nothing..." I say, nodding off, back to pushing on begrudgingly.



...We spent the next 10 minutes or so in silence, until, finally, I heard the noise again.



Did you hear that?



This time, I heard the noise again. But it was in Sarah's voice. I look in front of me, but see only forest ahead. Flabbergasted, I turn back, seeing... me. Yatima. 



Yatima looked at me with his misty green eyes appearing almost a smokey gray from the meager amount of light that illuminated us from the lantern that he was holding. 



Those weren't my eyes.



Did you hear that?



"What?" Hiroki chimed, his eyebrow slightly arching upwards as he looked back at Yatima, whilst I glanced back at Yatima, with my eyes glazed over.



Confused, I look at Hiroki. His head turns rigidly, steering to face me. 

His eyes were a misty green, too.



Wait.

Those are my eyes.



"Can you see that?" Hiroki utters, his dried, plump lips bending into a long, unwinding smile. 



Click. Click. Click.



My neck freezes, as I dare not look behind me. I could hear it now.

"Can you hear that?"

I slowly peer behind me, not daring to act out of place.

Yatima.

He had no eyes.
