I found a hole, and it leads to hell.

So, first off, I'll start by saying that this is highly sensitive information. If you don't hear from me, well, you get the idea.

To help you gain a proper understanding of the events leading to this monstrosity of a discovery, you're going to have to know a bit of backstory. 

My friend and I, Josh, have a bit of an interest in exploring abandoned houses. It's fun... I guess. We usually hype ourselves up over potential imaginary ghosts or solving a mystery or whatever. It's a cool little pastime, basically.

A friend of ours notified us that there was a rundown cottage-like house near the end of the suburbs we live in. The cool thing about this house in particular is that it was quote: "A total murder house dude"

Of course, I immediately jumped at the idea of such a thing and called up Josh. We packed up or shit and got all of our essential necessities, a camera, a 12 foot rope, a mic, an extendable ladder, a half pack of cigarettes, and a few chocolate bars 

We started our journey by attempting to kick the door in which I quickly came to the realization that my legs weren't nearly as strong as I thought they were. "Fuck man. Let's just try the window, " Josh said as he lit up a cigarette. "Yeah, cool" 

I took the ladder out of my backpack and set it down.
As I climbed up, Josh held down the ladder while puffing on the cigarette like a pompous englishman.

I took a quick look around and then smashed the window with a nearby brick I was carrying around. 

Glass flew into the house, exposing the insides. The first look wasn't particularly exciting as all I saw was an empty room. "Looks like shit has been cleared out, dude," I said. Josh mumbled something incoherent. 

I climbed inside and opened the first door in front of me, while Josh followed after. 

"What the fuck..." I said wide-eyed. There was what seemed like thousands of sketches painting the walls. Some in even different languages it looked like. The only noticeable one was a very messy "God is Dead" 

"Dude, pull out your camera right fucking now. I found the jackpot" 

Suddenly, I was weightless. I was falling. I was facing a giant caveat in the hole when I felt a hand grip me on my back and pull me back onto the hole. "Hey what the fuck" I said as I was facing the hole. 

It was a hole. In the ground. 

Hole. In the ground. I couldn't believe it. It was a hole in the ground. A hole. 

Thankfully, I didn't fall into the caveat in the ground. Otherwise known as a hole.
"Holy shit dude, it's a fucking hole" Josh remarked

"I can't believe it, I almost fell into that hole"

"Imagine if I fell into the hole" I said

Josh started puffing on cigarettes, like an English pompous shithead. "Hole" he remarked. 

"Hole" I remarked, wide-eyed.
