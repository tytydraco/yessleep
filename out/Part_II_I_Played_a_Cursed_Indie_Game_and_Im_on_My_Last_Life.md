You’ve been here before.

Sure, you have.

The path feels familiar, and the trees bend at your touch.

Do you remember yet?

The game was indie made, the style crass but not unpleasant.

The text crept across the screen and faded into dust. Everything was black, but softly it brightened into a light purple hue. My character stared at me, a pixelated naked canvas.

“Dress your soul,” a low voice intoned.

Okay, so customization time. I bit my lip. I had to be smart about this. I didn’t want the avatar to look exactly like me, you know, just in case.

I clicked the randomize button, which made my character a pale brunette with short spiky hair and broad shoulders. When I clicked confirm, the tablet vibrated, and a bubble saying NO appeared above my character’s head.

Uh, okay? I frowned and clicked randomize again. This time, my character was tanned with long legs.

*Brrrt*, my tablet vibrated.

N O, the screen said.

I randomized again.

*BRRT*, NO

And again.

*BRRT*, NO

Maybe one more time?

*B R R T*, NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO

I sighed, “Okay! Fine.” Marmalade, curled up on my lap, opened one eye and meowed at me in irritation.

I scratched behind her ear and did what the game wanted of me. I dressed my soul.

Dark brown skin, coily black hair,  galaxy anime eyes. 

I took a deep breath and tapped confirm, and this time, it accepted my choice. I hoped I wasn’t transferring my actual soul to the game. But if I was, it was too late.

They gave me a name. My name was  SOUL and if my hunch was correct, then the crux of the game would revolve around me remembering who I was.

I wasn’t sure because there was no directions or dialogue. SOUL just walked through a fairy tale forest. It was sickeningly cute and resplendent with singing animals.

After a few minutes of walking, the scenery devolved into a typical horror landscape.

The sky darkened, the tree branches warped and curled, and the cute animals littered the dirt path dead. Their corpses were visceral, with strings of intestines and clumps of brain beside them.

A large brown house loomed up ahead--the typical haunted house. SOUL stopped at the front door and turned to face me. An involuntary chill trickled down my spine. She was looking right at me, and I swear I could see fear flicker in those large pixelated eyes. 

I didn’t want to do this. I really didn’t. But Benji needed my help and honestly, I was curious. I love horror. I love scary stuff and being scared. I needed to know what was going on and why.

SOUL opened the door, and darkness consumed us.

I hadn’t realized how much time had passed until I heard Anya’s keys in the door and her tired sigh as she walked to the living room.

She plopped into a chair, flinging her arm dramatically over her face. Anya was a nurse. She had always loved her profession, but then Covid had swept through, and the toll and depth of its horror had extinguished the enthusiasm and love she once held for it.

I paused the game.

“Long day?” I asked sympathetically. She nodded, too tired to speak.

“I ordered pizza,” I told her. “It’ll be here in around ten minutes.”

She nodded again, and I resumed playing.

“What are you doing?” She asked.

I just looked at her, eyebrow raised.

“No way,” she breathed, and as though she had forgotten about her exhaustion, she hurried over to my side. “Is this it? The game?”

I nodded. “Yup. I downloaded it this morning and have been playing ever since.”

She leaned in for a closer look.

SOUL was wandering around the dark, empty mansion. I had been right in my assessment of this being a *~ remember who you are *~ game. For the last two hours, I had been exploring and collecting bits of memories and clues to get my lost identity.

So far, I had found adoption papers, a faded locket, and strands of silver hair. I was still exploring the first floor, which was impressively spacious.

Anya watched as I played, and I occasionally snuck glances at her from the corner of my eye. I noticed her initial excitement had faded and had been replaced with a grimace. She looked wary.

I was about to ask her what was wrong when she pointed to the screen.

“Isis, what is that?”

I looked. I saw nothing.

“What?”

“That.” She tapped the screen, and SOUL turned and walked towards Anya’s hand.

I squinted into the scene’s murky darkness, gasped, and jumped back.

A face was staring back at us. A long, gaunt face with sorrowful eyes, its jaw was slack, and its mouth fell open. SOUL walked through its mouth and the screen shifted focus to follow her.

The face was still there. It stared at us. I wanted to believe it was a part of the game but I knew it wasn’t. It looked like

“It looks like a reflection,” Anya said, her hand trembled. We looked behind us, bracing ourselves for what might be there.

Of course, there was nothing.

There were three loud knocks on the door, and we jumped.

“Pizza,” I said weakly; Anya let out a small giggle.

“I’ll get it,” Anya said, hurrying away, Marmalade on her heels.

“I’ll set the table,” I said and I powered off the tablet. That was enough for today.

I didn’t want to but it was as though I were no longer in control of my body. I looked at the dark screen, willing that face to appear once again.

It didn’t and I let out the shaky breath that I had been holding in. I set the tablet on the coffee table and walked to the kitchen. The entire time it felt as though somebody was watching me.

❧

It was dark in the house; it overwhelmed me.

I knew it was the day because I could hear birds singing, and the slightest slivers of light crept behind dusty curtains, the darkness always extinguishing it whenever it came too close.

Somebody was in the room with me.

I could hear ragged breathing and felt fingers caress my skin and play with my hair. It was gentle at first, and then it wasn’t.

 Whoever, whatever it was, gripped my hair by the roots and pulled so hard that I saw white. My head burned, and I sank to the floor, my eyes blurred in tears of pain.

There were footsteps around me, and I heard laughter and admonishing whispers. Then, something gripped my chin and breathed in my face; It smelled like rot and shit and death.

A gust of wind lifted a curtain, the fabric contorted into a ghost, and when the sheet came away, the ghost remained. It stood in the darkening room, staring at me with somber eyes and pallid gray skin. His clothes were dirty and coated in dark red blood.

Benji.

I had found him.

We stood there staring at one another. I found it impossible to talk, and as he turned and walked away, I saw that the back of his head was caved in and crushed. His brain pulsated underneath skull fragments, and I numbly wondered if it hurt.

That was stupid, though, because the dead felt no pain, and Benji was dead.

His death didn’t stop me from scrambling to my feet and chasing after him. I didn’t stop until I was staring into his skull’s chasm.

 “Benji,” I said. I grasped his hand; it was slimy and cold. “Benji, what’s happening? What are you doing here?”

He stopped; he didn’t speak. I wondered if he even saw me. And then he pointed to the stairs. The bottom steps were slick with blood and caked in gore.

“This is where I died,” Benji said, and I jumped at the sound of his voice. His vocal cords sounded as though they had been dragged through gravel and then shredded in glass.

“I fell here,” he indicated to the bottom step. “And my skull exploded. I had only been trying to help. I just wanted to help her...Him. I can’t now?”

He sounded so sad that I wanted to hug him and tell him it was okay. But he buried his face in his hands and sobbed, his grief untethered and raw.

I made to grab him, but this time my hand went right through him, and icy white pain blinded me. The room shook, and Benji contorted. 

Bones snapped, tendons tore, and his spine burst from his back like a bloody flower in full bloom. His grin slid off his face when he looked at me, and his eyes rolled madly in their sockets. He walked towards me, jerking erratically, glitching.

He grabbed me by my throat and lifted me into the air effortlessly.

Benji wasn’t Benji anymore. Benji had become a creature of many masks with none to call his own. Right now, that mask was a blur of colors, some I never knew existed.

Benji, no, this thing, squeezed tighter, stealing all breath from me. My vision was fading, and I knew I would pass out, but just before I did, Benji became Benji again. He looked scared, but determined. 

Benji let go of my neck and wrapped his arms around me in a hug, and then he grabbed me by my waist and flung me from him as hard as he could. I flew through the air and shut my eyes just as I was about to become well acquainted with the ceiling. I waited for the impact.

It never came.

I opened my eyes. I was lying on the sofa in my living room. It was dark. The time on my tablet said 2:30.

My heart was racing, and my throat burned, but at least I could breathe.

I took a few moments to gather myself.

My mind sought reason, and it wanted an excuse for my terror.

It was a dream, a nightmare. But, of course, you’re dreaming about Benji and that house you’ve been stressed and worried about and playing nonstop.

But I wouldn’t placate myself with lies because it hadn’t been a dream. It was real.

I turned on my tablet and was on untitled’s pause screen. 

Benji stared back at me; his eyes were huge and scared, and a dark trickle of blood slowly trailed down his face.

*Ping*

I read the notification on my screen.

Isis

Look at me

I stared into the tablet, and Benji stared back, and then behind my shoulder, something moved, and a shadow solidified.

I watched as the shadow formed features, and those features leered at me with red eyes and gnashing teeth.

If hell had a personification, it would be this. The shadow dug its sharp fingers into my shoulder, and I yelped as it stroked my bones.

The last thing I saw before I blacked out was this monster rotating through its cache of faces until it settled on one.

Benji’s.

 Benji stared down at me, and without a word, he gripped the underside of my jaw and tore away my face. Then, he placed it over his own like a mask, and I watched him transform into me. 

Yes, I died, and yes, I am dead. I wish I could end the story here, but I can’t. Instead, I keep thinking of how sometimes death is a mercy, and I wish it had given me its blessing.
