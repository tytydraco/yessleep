Dear Online Journal,

&#x200B;

This is what happened today from what I recall. I’ll only type the important things I remember, and I’ll try to type it word for word. I’ll even write it as one of those cool stories. But something crazy happened to Mike!

&#x200B;

2nd class of the day. Mr. Thompson’s Geometry class.

&#x200B;

“Austin, Thompson is looking directly at you… again,” Mike loudly whispered to me. He was sure that Thompson could hear everything, so he didn’t care for the volume of his whisper. Mike is going to get us caught again, and it won’t end well.

&#x200B;

“Shut up, Mike! You know he doesn’t like it when we talk during a test. Especially during an exam,” I replied hurriedly through my teeth, afraid that Thompson would give us another detention for disrupting the class.

&#x200B;

“So? He’s like uber weird, dude. I told you before, and I’ll tell you again. He has super hearing! Thompson is a werewolf! I know it,” Mike practically doomed us both right then and there. Gesturing his hands like a mad man during the last words of his sentence.

&#x200B;

Mandy whips her head around so fast I could swear I heard her neck snap. She’s this annoying, goody-two-shoes, four-eyed, snitch who doesn’t know how to keep her mouth shut. My dad told me never to hate on a girl unless she started hating first. She never liked me since the beginning of Preschool. So, technically she hated me first and I got the right to hate her back since then. She raises her hand and Thompson immediately looks at her. Mandy began to point and gesture at us.

&#x200B;

“Mr. Thompson, Michael and Austin are talking during the exam!” She loudly claimed from her front seat teacher’s pet desk.

&#x200B;

Thompson stood up from his desk abruptly and began to stomp his way toward us. A vein popping out of his forehead. He nods a thank you to Mandy, then continues his way to the back of the class where Mike and I sit. One day, Mandy is gonna get some well deserved karma. And I’m going to record and enjoy every second of it. She’s a total little Karen.

&#x200B;

“You two need to be quiet! Do you want another Friday afternoon spent at school?” Thompson hissed out. I knew that was a rhetorical question, however, Mike did not. It’s a mystery how Michael Schmidt passes his English classes, or how he hasn’t repeated his Freshman year of highschool. My friend, truly, hasn’t gotten any smarter during his time in summer school.

&#x200B;

“No, Thomp- Mr. Thompson. Why would I want to hang out with you?” I take a quick glance at Thompson, then look back at my dumb friend. Mike must be favoring the death penalty today, and if he doesn’t get it from Thompson, then I’ll be the one to finish him off.

&#x200B;

“You’re disrupting the class, Mr. Schmidt. And I know you’ve been talking with Mr. Davis. You both are getting an after school detention. This Friday!” Thompson quietly exclaimed with a twinge of cold joy. Mike looks away in anger, huffing out a breath, then rolling his eyes and shaking his head. I want to punch Mike in the shoulder for getting us in detention, again.

&#x200B;

Thompson walks away with a triumphant smirk on. I want to wipe that look off his face, but that’ll only get me suspended or expelled. He sits behind that desk like a King who just watched someone get beheaded for fun. I swear he gives out detentions like free giant sized candy bars during a nice Halloween night. What a monster he is. And Mandy is his little sidekick on the inside. The Karen Robin to Thompson’s evil Batman.

&#x200B;

5 minutes until Lunch time.

&#x200B;

Mike and I both know what comes next when it comes to Thompson. He’ll make us redo the exam. Mike isn’t great at math, and I hate redoing things. When Friday comes, we both will have the most boring and dreadful detention of our lives. I look down at my finished exam paper, Thompson will probably tell me to throw it away, I crumble it up into a little ball of wasted effort. Mike looks at me and gives a small lopsided smile. Looking down from his face I see that he has already started to draw some stupid characters on his paper. Most of them consist of dicks with faces. This makes me rethink my entire friendship with him.

&#x200B;

“Seriously, Mike?” I breathe out a small laugh of disbelief, giving him a questioning look. He begins to snicker and lift his paper for me to see better. Mike drew Thompson as a micro dick with crooked glasses and a bushy mustache, of course he didn’t forget Thompson’s classic Homer comb over on the tip. I roll my eyes hard at him and just take my phone out to get a picture. That accurate portrayal of Thompson just became my new Discord profile picture.

&#x200B;

We spent most of our time drawing Thompson as different things that looked like dicks. Mushroom Thompson, rocket Thompson, more micro dick Thompson, even more mushroom Thompson. Then, the Lunch bell rang and everyone started to rush out of the classroom to find their specific tables. Mike and I got up and waited out the crowd, then we started to walk towards the door.

&#x200B;

“Mr. Schmidt, Mr. Davis, hold on,” Thompson called out to us. We waited at the classroom doorway, me leaning on the door frame and Mike with his hand on the door. Thompson uses the last names of the students he doesn’t like. He has never once addressed me, or Mike, by our first names. Not even on the first day of school when we met him. He walks up to us slowly, looking each of us in the eye, then he takes a deep breath and tells us what we expected the moment he gave us our Friday detention.

&#x200B;

“Throw away today’s Geometry exam. You’ll both be taking it again during detention with me. I don’t know if you cheated or not, but I’m not taking that risk,” His smile grew bigger with every word. I bet he gets high off of causing others unnecessary stress and pain. He’s a Homer three-line-haired micro dick for sure.

&#x200B;

“Sure thing, Mr. Thompson. I’ll be sure to remember to do that,” Mike said confidently, looking up at Thompson, staring straight into those cold dark eyes. I can’t believe that Mike ever thought that he was a werewolf. He’s more of a cold-blooded reptile than a warm-blooded mythical creature. And werewolves would have more hair than whatever Thompson has. He’s balding and has a bushy mustache that would make an old-timey barber cry just by looking at it.

&#x200B;

I see the smallest twitch under Thompson’s right eye. He does the slightest glare at Mike, then he looks into my eyes. Thompson is so creepy and weird. Why did I have to get him as a math teacher? He sucks at teaching because he expects us to know everything before we even get to the next lesson. Then, he steps away and returns to his cluttered desk. Mike and I make eye contact for a second, we both are definitely getting chewed out by our parents for getting another Friday detention. I can already hear Michael's gears grinding in that excuse making mind of his. He’ll probably say something about some after school activity that we both wanted to participate in.

&#x200B;

“Let’s get out of here, Austin.”

&#x200B;

“Yeah, sure thing, man.”

&#x200B;

Cafeteria, 39 minutes until first Lunch is over.

&#x200B;

“Dude, Isaac! We were held up by Thompson, so sorry we’re late, man,” Mike jokingly apologizes. If I could describe Isaac it would be with a cotton ball inside the world’s quietest room. There’s nothing more to say about Isaac, except that he’s always the first person anywhere.

&#x200B;

“Mmhm,” Isaac hums as a response to Mike’s apology. Looking down at his phone, scrolling through AITA Reddit posts, giving his judgment when he sees fit to.

&#x200B;

After we got our not-even-comparable-to-prison-food lunches, Mike and I sat around Isaac. Or Mike attempted to sit next to Isaac, until he yelled out a couple of curses.

&#x200B;

“Fuck, shit, damnit!” He drops his lunch tray hard onto the white table. Jolting up, Isaac and I frantically look at each other then Mike. He’s jumping around weirdly, grinding his teeth, and grabbing his right buttcheek in pain. I could see blood seeping through his fingers.

&#x200B;

The school officer runs over to Mike after just noticing the commotion. I look down at his seat and see a piece of metal covered in blood. That shouldn’t have been there. It wasn’t even there when Isaac got here, if it was he would’ve told Mike to sit somewhere else. The officer picks up Mike, who is beginning to cry and curse in between sobs. Running out of the Cafe, Isaac and I run to follow them, forgetting our lunches. I spot Thompson at the teacher’s lunch table on the other side of the Cafe. How could I ignore him when he’s making the freakiest look I’ve ever seen. He’s glaring at us. I bet he did this to Mike. No one makes a fucked up look like that after seeing a kid get his ass shanked by a stupid red disc seat.

&#x200B;

Mr. Schmidt, Mike’s dad, picked us up from the highschool when he received the call about the, “Butt Shank Incident,” that happened in the Cafe. I couldn’t shake off the sick feeling I got from Thompson’s creepy stare. His eyes were following me while I ran out of the Cafe. That image won’t leave my mind for a while, that’s for sure. I bet I’m gonna get a nightmare from it tonight.

&#x200B;

Hospital, waiting room, 47 minutes after the incident.

&#x200B;

Once we reached the hospital, Isaac and I were trying to recount what happened before the incident occurred. Mike’s mom arrived a few minutes after we did. I told Mike’s parents about how we were held up by Thompson for a few moments, then we headed down to the Cafeteria, went in line to get our food --this is where Isaac left to refill his water bottle--, and then after getting to the table with Isaac he got shanked in the butt trying to sit next to him. It took a while to convince Mike’s mom that Isaac didn’t do it. She just straight up accused him of trying to kill Mike for some delusional reason. Screaming and crying about her baby boy. Me, Isaac, and even Mike never liked his mother.

&#x200B;

She was always over dramatic and accusing people of anything she could. It was no surprise to us when Mike told us last year that she was diagnosed with NPD, which took a while because she never believed in doctors or mental health issues. Plus, this year Mr. Schmidt is finally getting a divorce against her for the bullshit she pulled in a mall three weeks ago. Long story short: “Karen Pepper Sprays Hot Topic Employee for Standing up to her Psycho Behavior,” was all over the internet with videos and everything.

&#x200B;

“They’re lying! I know they’re lying! The little shits. They did this to him!” She continues to scream at us with tears and mascara running down her cheeks, she nearly slaps Isaac on the face and almost kicks me. Mr. Schmidt and a nurse hold her back, meanwhile another nurse calls the cops. I’ve heard about her losing her mind on people before, but this is the first time I got to see a tantrum in person. No wonder Mike likes to retell these moments to us, this is surprisingly entertaining. It’s messed up, but it really does entertain me. Mr. Schmidt is definitely going to win the custody battle for Mike.

&#x200B;

Hospital, Mike’s assigned room, 1 hour and 30 minutes after the incident, 1 hour after Mike’s mom got arrested for an attempted assault of two minors and disturbing the peace.

&#x200B;

Mr. Schmidt was nodding his head and listening to the doctor about Mike’s injury outside of the room. Isaac and I sat on either side of Mike, waiting for him to wake up. Turns out the injury was pretty bad. Once Mr. Schmidt was back in the room, he told us that it’ll be a while before Mike wakes up from the drugs. Mike had to get a Tetanus shot, a small bit of metal pulled out of his buttcheek, and multiple stitches. He told us it might leave a scar on his ass. I can’t wait to see Mike’s butt scar, he always wanted a scar to show off to the ladies. He said scars added character to you. I doubt it.

&#x200B;

Hospital, Mike’s assigned room, 2 hours and 46 minutes after the incident.

&#x200B;

It took a while for my dad to get off work and get to the Hospital. He’s currently chatting with Mr. Schmidt and giving him advice about divorce and custody battles. Isaac’s sister arrived just after my dad did, she’s currently grilling the hell out of Isaac because she heard from a nurse about the accusations that soon-to-be-former Mrs. Schmidt made. It’s not like she’s accusing Isaac out right, but she wants to really make sure he didn’t do it. Mike is awake, but he’s too tired to do anything. So, we’re letting him rest. While everyone is talking about something else, I’m texting one of the guidance counselors at school. Ms. Weatherly, the guidance counselor for Sophomores.She’s like Ms. Frizzle, but she’s all about the weather because of her last name. And I think that is the coolest thing. She’s always wearing clothes related to weather patterns or different seasons. Ms. Weatherly is also my dad’s girlfriend, so there are a lot of factors into why I like her so much. To add a note here: this is exactly how I actually text people. Don’t judge me okay, dude?

&#x200B;

Ms. Weatherly: What happened at first lunch today???? Kids are freaking out about an attempted murder??? You okay buddy?

&#x200B;

Me: yeah Im ok. but mike isnt. hes resting now but he will def get a butt scar.

&#x200B;

Ms. Weatherly: So, Mike got stabbed in the butt!? What happened???

&#x200B;

Me: no not like that. he sat on a sharp piece of metal that was on his seat at the lunch table. i sweat thompson had something to do with it!!

&#x200B;

Me: \*swear

&#x200B;

Ms. Weatherly: Okay, Austin. Are you sure that Mr. Thompson had something to do with it? Because I would have to report him immediately for endangering the safety of a student. And I don’t want to do that without evidence or any kind of proof.

&#x200B;

Me: there are security cameras in the cafe right???

&#x200B;

Ms. Weatherly: Yes, of course. After the dangerous Senior prank that was pulled 3 years ago, the Principal had them installed.

&#x200B;

Me: wat was the prank????

&#x200B;

Ms. Weatherly: A bunch of Seniors did a 24 hour challenge at the school during the time. They actually broke into the school instead of hiding out somewhere inside of it. When they were discovered by a custodian they scared him so bad, it caused him to have a major heart attack.

&#x200B;

Ms. Weatherly: It almost killed the custodian btw. Ask Mr. Constance when you see him cleaning the hallways. He’s actually the custodian those Seniors nearly killed. I’m surprised he even stayed here.

&#x200B;

Me: dang thats awful…btw can u access the cams???

&#x200B;

Ms. Weatherly: Yeah. If I ask for permission from the Principal, I can access them.

&#x200B;

Me: look for the table near the cafe entrance. me, isaac, and mike sit in the middle row. mike and i went to get food while isaac went to refill his water. thompson might have messed with the seat near the middle part of the table. can you look for that plssss??

&#x200B;

Ms. Weatherly: I will when I get the go ahead from the Principal. I’m walking to his office right now. See you later, bud?Me: of course, frizzle!! talk to u later :)

&#x200B;

Mike started to tap at my shoulder. I turn to look at him and he has this serious face on. It’s kind of weird because I don’t really see him being serious. It’s really rare for him to be like that.

&#x200B;

“Bro, you better avenge me, Austin. Thompson left a mark on my butt, dude,” He smiles naturally at the sentence. Of course, he’s not going to not laugh at a sentence like that. I give a quiet chuckle at his smile.

&#x200B;

“I already asked the Frizz to get camera footage of what happened. Knowing her, she’ll probably have it by tomorrow morning, Mike. When you get outta this place, I’m definitely going to pressure my dad into buying you some ice cream for your bravery,” We both laugh at the same time, Mike flinching and nearly grabbing at his butt.

&#x200B;

I guess I wasn’t wrong about that death penalty thing though. Thompson actually came through and did something to Mike, to a point it’ll leave a permanent scar on his body. He could’ve gotten sick from Tetanus or worse. That piece of metal could’ve been lead and it might’ve given Mike lead poisoning. Who knows what else could have happened in that Cafe. I expect him to get arrested by tomorrow. Hopefully, Ms. Weatherly pulls through and gets something good on him. I can’t wait to see some well deserved karma.But I can’t shake this feeling that I’m wrong about him. I feel kind of guilty accusing him of this crime. What if he didn’t do it? Or it could’ve been some freak accident. Maybe even a misunderstanding. What if Isaac actually did it? I don’t think so, but Mrs. Schmidt and his sister kind of do think he did it. I don’t want to lose Isaac as a friend, he’s so nice to me and Mike. And we’re both kind of jerks to him cause we tease him a lot. Maybe this is his revenge? Maybe I’m the next target? Who knows because I don’t have a clue. And I’m feeling guilty about immediately accusing Thompson.

&#x200B;

Sincerely,

&#x200B;

Austin Davis
