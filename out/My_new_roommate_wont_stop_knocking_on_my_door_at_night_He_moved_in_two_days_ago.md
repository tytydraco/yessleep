I met Andrew through a Facebook post.
I needed a roommate fast, and he messaged me five minutes after I posted in the local housing group.

No profile picture.
No mutual friends.
But he said all the right things. Said he had a stable remote job, no pets, quiet, clean, respectful. I FaceTimed him once. He seemed normal. A little awkward, maybe, but I didn’t care. I needed rent.

He moved in on Friday. By Saturday night, I wanted him out. The first red flag was the way he unpacked.

He brought four boxes. That’s it. No bed, no decorations, not even a backpack. The boxes were taped tight and he carried them one at a time, always holding them away from his body, like they might bite.

I offered to help. He didn’t answer—just smiled, then took the last box into his room and shut the door. I didn’t see him the rest of the day.

Around midnight, I heard him whispering in there. Couldn’t make out the words. It sounded like a prayer, or maybe… a list? He didn’t stop until 3 a.m.

The next morning, I went to make coffee. The kitchen was spotless. My cereal box was in the fridge. My coffee beans had been alphabetized. And there was a note on the counter, in blocky, perfect handwriting:

I replaced your sponge. The old one had too many eyes. I stood there staring at it for a full minute. Then I opened the cupboard. New sponge. Bright yellow.

And on the floor beneath the sink… the old one. Soaked. Covered in black mold I swear wasn’t there the day before. The middle was ripped open. Like it had teeth.

That night, I locked my bedroom door. Around 2:11 a.m., I heard footsteps outside it. Slow. Barefoot. Careful. Then a knock. Not loud. Not aggressive. Just two soft taps.

I didn’t move. Another knock. Three this time. Slightly faster. “Andrew?” I asked. No reply. I checked the peephole. No one there. When I opened the door, the hallway was empty.

But another note was taped to the wall: Don’t answer until the third knock. She gets impatient. I didn’t sleep after that. I confronted him the next day.

He was sitting in the living room, facing the blank TV screen. When I asked what the notes were about, he blinked slowly and said, “You heard her, didn’t you?” “Heard who?” “She doesn’t like being seen too soon. It ruins her.” Then he turned back to the blank TV. Smiling.

I backed into my room and locked the door. That night, I heard him whispering again. Not to himself this time. I could hear the difference. He was answering someone. Listening. Nodding between each line.

I pressed my ear to the wall. His voice came through clearer. “She wants to know your name,” he said. “She wants to wear it.” I stopped sleeping in the apartment after that.

I stayed at a friend’s for a night. No calls, no messages from Andrew. But I got a voicemail. No number. Just “Unknown.” Thirty seconds of breathing. Then whispering. Then, right before it ended—my own voice, saying: “Let me back in.”

I hadn’t said that. I came home the next day, planning to kick him out. Tell him to pack up his four boxes and leave. But the boxes were gone.

All that was left in his room was a circle of salt around the bed. Symbols drawn in the carpet. Charcoal, I think. Or blood. And one last note.

Don’t break the circle. She likes you. She might not stop at your name. I called the police.

They found the room empty. No Andrew. No salt. No symbols. Just an empty room with bare walls and cold air. They asked if I’d been drinking.

That night, the knocking came again. 2:14 a.m. Three soft knocks. I didn’t move. Then I heard a voice, right outside the door. High-pitched. Childlike. Trying too hard to sound friendly.

“I have your name.” It scratched at the wood. “I want to give it back.” I didn’t answer. At 3 a.m. on the dot, it stopped.

The next morning, the hallway wall was covered in fingerprints. Tiny. Like a child’s.
Burned into the paint.

There was another note, slipped under my door. She’s inside now. Don’t let her out. She wears new faces. You won’t recognize them until they smile.

I haven’t seen Andrew since. I don’t think I ever really met him. But I hear the knocking every night. Always at the same time. And always one knock closer.
