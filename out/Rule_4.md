Rule 1: Don’t leave the bounds

Rule 2: Always be cloaked

Rule 3: No more than 3 days

Rule 4: Don’t let the game live, if you engage it in conversation

The famous rules of the Haunted forest were carved in a rough and ugly hand on the weather-worn and mossy wooden board at the head of the trail.  A wooden fence about hip high ran along the periphery of the forest on either side of the trail entrance. 

The Haunted Forest. Sounds silly when you say it out loud, but it is the most haunted trail in the northern hemisphere. Every year there’s more than a hundred disappearances reported on this trail. You would think that should be enough of a deterrent for the tourists thronging to this trail, but as capsaicin showed, evolutionary deterrents sometimes have the opposite effect in the modern world. 

I’ve always been interested in the supernatural and I love me a good horror story, but this is the first time I got to visit an actual haunted place. On my 30th birthday my best friend Casey and I made a plan that we’ll visit the Haunted forest for our vacation in September. We chalked out all the details, contacted the local guides and planned our 3-day camping itinerary. We were both so thrilled for this trip. Then two weeks ago, during the final prep for our trip, Casey got into a freak car accident. He broke both his legs, his right arm and several ribs. He could have easily died. Thank god and John Hetrick for airbags!

I nearly canceled the whole thing as it made no sense to leave Casey in the state he was in, but he convinced me to take the trip for the both of us. If I’m being honest with myself, I guess I even convinced myself that I’m doing this for Casey and not just because I was so looking forward to this trip. In either case, here I was. And my first impression of the forest was underwhelming. It looked like a regular old forest, except for the fence. I suppose even fenced forests aren’t unheard of.

But as we got closer to the trail, it felt like there was a vague melancholy radiating from the forest. Maybe it was all in my head. Maybe it was just the mist. It was misty 300 days of the year in these parts. 

As we got to the trail head, the guide stopped and said, “Okay, let’s go through the details again. Don’t lose…?”, he prompted, waiting for me to respond.

“My GPS. It’s my way back”

“Good. Always follow the rules. ALL the rules”, he stressed, “Don’t be an idiot tourist. We’ve nearly hit the quota for our missing persons this year. I don’t want us to outperform last year”

“I’ve been meaning to ask. What’s up with Rule 4? I always found it so strange. Are the animals possessed?”, I asked.

“Don’t know. Don’t care. You shouldn’t either. It’s in the rules and you follow the rules, if you want to live”

“Relax. I got this”, I said

“You were supposed to be two people. I don’t like last-minute changes. There’s enough chaos in this place without the tourists bringing their own. If you ever get too scared, stop and build a tent and stay inside. Give it at least an hour inside the tent and turn back. Follow the GPS back to this location”, the guide continued.

“Sir, yes, sir”, I said in jest

“Good”, he said, either ignoring or completely missing the joke. “Here”, he said handing me a whistle, “this can help repel smaller predators should you encounter any. Remember this is still a forest, haunted or not. Good luck and see you in three days.”

I nodded him a quick thank you as he was turning away and tucked the whistle in my cloak pocket. I turned toward the forest and took a deep breath of the fresh air before stepping on to the trail. 

That was the moment my life irreversibly changed. That step was my last act of free will. Of course, I did not know that at that time. At that time, it felt no different from the thousand steps before that got me to the trailhead.

The first hour on the trail was remarkably unremarkable. For the first couple of miles, the trail was wide, flat and for the most part clear. I felt no sign of life around me at first, natural or otherwise, aside from the ambient buzzing of the cicadas. As I walked on, the trail got narrower, with ancient trees closing in on the path from all sides. Occasionally I could spot a buck in the clearings on either side of the path. Haunted or not, it was a stunning trail. 

I was like a kid on a roller coaster that started to climb up, waiting for the drop he knows is coming. The anticipation of the thrill was setting me on edge. Something strange was starting to mingle with it though. At first, I thought it was the forest’s melancholy I sensed, that was dampening my excitement. It took me a good half hour more until I was finally able to see it for what it was. 

It was fear. Raw, primal fear emanating from the most ancient part of my brain that sensed a threat to its survival. Fear was tinging my excitement, until it was excitement no more. It clouded my thoughts and made all my muscles taut. My heart was racing silently for fear of giving itself away to some unknown stalker. 

And then all of sudden the cicadas stopped. My heart leapt into my mouth. I was suddenly acutely aware of how loud my heart was beating. In the silence the cicadas left behind it felt like a jackhammer. I had goosebumps all over. Cold sweat started to drip down my neck. My mouth was numb and dry. My head jerked towards the bushes on the left of the trail as I heard a rustle. I leapt back with a yowl landing hard on my butt as a large squirrel scurried out of the bush and scampered up the tree.

“Jesus fucking Christ! You scared the shit out of me you little dipshit!”, I blurted out. 

I sighed and took a deep calming breath. As my composure and my sanity started to return to me, I chuckled at how badly I’ve scared myself. It’s not the ghosts that scare us, it’s the ghost stories we construct in our minds. Sometimes, it really IS in only our heads.

I set my backpack down and got my water bottle out. I looked at my activity tracker while sipping the cool water. 

“5 Miles since the start of trail. I’ve come across a grand total of zero humans so far. What are the odds? September is such a popular season too…”

My unease started to creep back in. I shook my head and splashed my face with some cold water. As I turn to get my towel from my backpack, I notice tracks in the mud. My own and someone else’s. 

“See. Ghost stories, Sam! Ghost stories!”, I reassured my lizard brain.

I got to my feet and start back up the path. I turn to take one last look at the clearing where I gave myself a heart attack before moving on. I stop dead in my tracks. The footsteps, which a moment ago stopped at the clearing, now followed my own. They stopped a hands width away from where I am now. 


“Just a trick of the light. Just a trick of the light”, I chant to myself. Heart pounding, I take a slow step backwards. Soft footprints appear in the mud next to where I stood a moment ago. It was happening right in front of my eyes. 

I cautiously took two more steps back. There they were again, right next to my own tracks. I’ve seen enough. I break into a sprint running away from the clearing and from the footsteps that were following me. 

“What the fuck was that? I’m safe as long as I follow the rules, aren’t I?”, I said aloud to myself, now starting to pant.

Something about the rules niggled at the back of my head, like a microscopic morsel that’s stuck in your teeth. Small enough that you can’t find it, but big enough that you know something isn’t quite the way it’s supposed to be.

I thought back to everything that happened on the trail so far, replaying the events of the morning in my head. Then suddenly it hit me. And it was like my feet were pulled from under me. I could feel the taste of gall rising into my mouth. The squirrel!

“You’re a fucking idiot, Sam!”, I chided myself.

The adrenaline surge that kept me going for the last five minutes straight at full sprint was wearing off. All the highs and crashes before were catching up to me as my breathing grew laborious. I snuck a glance over my shoulder to see if the footsteps or something worse were following me. Before I could see any footsteps, I clatter hard into something ahead of me. I crash on to the path together with who or whatever I ran into, completely winded.

My head still throbbing and spinning from the crash, I frantically try and prop myself up to see what I collided into. There was a naked man curled up into a ball and groaning in front of me. I back away from him whimpering and still panting from my manic sprint.

Relief floods into me as the man starts to sit up and I get a better glimpse at his face. I crawl on all fours towards him and embrace him sobbing loudly. 

“Oh, Casey! I thought I was gonna die! Thank God I found you. I was so scared!”

At this point I was bawling loudly, clinging desperately to the familiar in this sea of strange I’m surrounded by. As minutes pass by, the tears drained my reservoir of fear enough for me to come to my senses. 

I’ve pulled away from the embrace and asked, “Wait, Casey, what are you doing here? Why are you naked?”

“Oh… right… that”, he said, “let me fix that”. In the next second Casey was dressed in the exact same outfit that I had on, down to my backpack and boots. It was like looking into one of those fun house mirrors. 

I pushed further away from him looking at him warily from head to toe.

“I’m not… here, really”, he said hesitantly as if he was broaching a messy, complex issue with an infant. “There was a further complication in the ICU after you left. I’m not really here. I’m not anywhere anymore I suppose. I was adrift. And that’s when I felt you. I could sense your fear and it was like a warmth I couldn’t turn away from”

It was like someone smacked me in the face with a thick slab of ice. I was dumbfounded. 

“It can’t be… no… no… no… you were fine when I left. The doctors said you were out of danger. No… it can’t be…”, I was rambling, more to myself than to Casey.

“I’m sorry, Sam! I want you to know that I don’t blame you. Not for what happened. Not for you not being there with me in my last moments”, he said tenderly, “I was the one that asked you to go. If our roles were reversed, you know you would have done the same”

I sat there with my mouth ajar, my head in my hands and my heart in a million tiny little pieces. Tears were streaming down my face and grief was swelling up in my throat, swallowing any words that were going to come out until they were no more than loud sobs. 

“I’m sorry, Case! I should never have left you. I should have stayed with you. I’m such a horrible and selfish person”, I felt untethered, disconnected from the material world and sensations. 

“Don’t do that yourself. This is path we’ve set ourselves on long ago. Neither you nor I could’ve changed the course of events that came to pass. I can see that now. Being on this side, it gives you an interesting perspective”, Casey said.

All I could do in response was more sobbing. “What should I do, Case? What should I do?”

“Aw jeez! Look at you bawling like a babe”, the voice was Casey’s, but something felt off. The tone full of mocking condescension and cruelty. “Casey is fine. Well… in as much as you can call not being able to walk or stand without support for the rest of his life ‘fine’.”

It was like a thousand needles pricking me all over. Something about it set my teeth on edge. It pushed me over from grief and fear into anger.

“What the fuck are you? And what did you do to Casey?”, I asked through clenched teeth.

“Oh, I’m sorry, Sam! I totally forgot that you’re “differently abled” when it comes to intellect. As I told you already, Casey is fine. He is in the hospital where you left him, slowly mending the hundreds of fractures in his body. As to what I am, that’s a very complicated question to answer”, the stranger cruelly replied.

“Are you a demon? You lying piece of shit”, I seethed.

“How original!”, the entity spat back, “No, I’m not a demon. If I were to dumb it down for you I guess you could say I’m an immortal celestial being responsible for governing the ever-expanding universe.”

That strangely took out some of my steam. I felt for a second like a bacterium angry at the sun. It took me one more second to realize that it was actually the entity that put that notion in my head.

“Can you hear my thoughts?! Can you control them?”, I asked shocked and embarrassed.

“Yes, genius! How do you think I knew about your friend Casey. Not like he’s a celebrity in the celestial circles. And yes, I can make you see what I want you to. It’s how we communicate”, the entity derided me.

“What are you called?”

With my anxiety and anger subsiding, my natural curiosity started to come out.

“You can’t perceive my celestial name, just like you can’t perceive my true form. Here’s the closest translation in your tongue”

A darkness flooded my mind. I could tell it was an image the entity was projecting in my head. “What is that? Black sky?”, I asked.

“Pfft”, he swatted at the idea, “it is much much more complex than that. But as that’s likely the upper end of complexity your little noggin can process, let’s go with that. Hi, I’m Black sky! Nice to meet you”

“Why are you here? Why me? Is it because I broke Rule 4 and talked to a squirrel?”, I blurted out the question bothering me the most.

Black Sky burst out laughing. Not cruel and callous as it’s been so far. Just plain, hearty laughter until there were tears in Casey’s eyes. “Oh God! I needed that. Thank you for that. The rules don’t concern you. It is quite hilarious though what you humans make of it. As to why I’m here, why, this is my home… of sorts. I’ve been banished by my fellow celestials. A matter of policy disagreements. I’ve been imprisoned in the hyperspace encompassing this forest.”

The true horror of my situation suddenly dawned on me. With a sinking feeling in my stomach, I asked him, “The rules are for you, aren’t they?”

Black sky looked at me, eyes wide with mock surprise and said, “It looks like my smarts are rubbing off on you. Yes, they’re my prison rules, if you will. As long as I stick to those, I’m allowed entry into the dimensional planes of my hyperspace, like this one, for food and recreation” 

“And, we’re the game aren’t we?”, I asked weakly, starting to feel sick.

“Very astute of you again. I get three days in a year in each dimensional plane to hunt and find my sustenance.”

The thought of being torn limb to limb and devoured by this evil in front of me broke me anew. “Is it going to hurt, when you…” I asked sobbing, “eat me”

“You won’t feel a thing my dear Sam! When someone gives you candy, it’s not the wrapper you savor. I care nothing for your flesh. It is but a wrapper. And what’s underneath… that’s mine to savor for an eternity. Well, not really an eternity, but it’s close enough as far as you’re concerned. We’re going to have a lot of fun together!” Black Sky said with an evil glee on his face.

I’ve been here ever since, trapped in this hyperspace. Seeing what he wants me to see, playing out whatever scenarios he laid out for me. Sitting here, talking to you, I’ve no idea whether you’re human, or one of the Trapped, like me, or another one his “cloaks”. What’s worse, I’ve come to realize I no longer care. Whether I’m bait, entertainment or food, I no longer have any say in the matter. I’ve lost any naive misguided notions around free will a very long time ago. 

If you’re smart, you will too.
