This may be  the last story I can tell you guys……but it’s  a long one so I hope it satisfies.



The phone rang at midnight.



I'd expected it, I can not sleep anyways exactly three years ago today, I signed a contract in that cold, impersonal office.



This job became routine around the eighteenth month. I was now familiar with its rhythm and pattern. I understood that the universe held far more rooms than I knew, and some of them needed nurturing.



I was awakened by the sound and instinctively reached for my phone on the bedside table. The screen's dim light illuminated my small bedroom. The walls were still covered with my sticky notes, but the content had changed over time. No longer "Check the manual," but "Pick up Levi at 3 PM."



The phone screen displayed only two words: "Final Delivery."



No address. No time. No customer name. I glanced at the manual; there wasn't even a rule.



I slowly sat up, my body accustomed to the rhythm of nighttime deliveries, while my brain was still processing this strange notification.biscuit, perked up from the foot of the bed, its ears twitching. In the three years since the garden incident, its aging pattern was completely different from that of ordinary dogs; in other words, it hadn't aged at all. Its muzzle was still golden, its eyes still bright, and its body still strong and healthy. Some gifts from another world possess a magic of preservation.



I picked up my pocket watch from the bedside table. Tonight, it presented a new image: a vast sea of ​​sand, the sky an odd color，neither blue nor gray, but somewhere in between, like a faded old photograph. In the distance, bathed in the heat, a large, curved object, like ribs, could be vaguely seen emerging from the dunes.



I gazed at this image for a long time, my thumb gently stroking the edge of the watch case.



I heard footsteps in the hallway outside the apartment. Light and hurried, like the scratching of Levi's paws on the hardwood floor when he was excited or anxious.After these years some time in midnight  he will come alone to see me in the midnights.Strictly speaking, this counts as running away from home, so my colleagues always wanted to keep a closer eye on him. But as the old saying goes, you can't keep a shapeshifter locked up.



"Dad?" His voice came from outside the door, young, yet more composed than when I first brought him home.



“Come in, Levi.”



The door opened slowly, and he entered in human form, or at least mostly. Over the years, he had become increasingly adept at maintaining his human form, and more discerning about which parts should be exposed and which should be concealed. But tonight, his tail was exposed, bushy and fox-like, twitching nervously. His eyes gleamed with the light that only appeared when his other side approached, a faint green hue in the dim light.



He was twelve years old if we really count, and had learned to reliably maintain his human form. We took him to parks, museums, and ordinary places on weekends, which taught him how to blend into crowds, how to act like a human child, and how to modulate his voice so it didn't carry that slight growl. But there was always something different about him, drawing wary glances from other parents and keeping other children at a distance. He had learned to coexist with it, accepting his state somewhere between human and otherworldly.



“Dad?” he asked, standing in the doorway, one hand on the frame. “Has it been three years?”



I nodded slowly. “It seems so.”



He entered the room and sat on the edge of my bed. Biscat immediately snuggled up to him, offering the solid comfort honed over centuries by dogs. Levi's hand unconsciously stroked Biscat's fur, his fingers entwining in the golden hide, seeking solace in the familiar touch.



“Are you staying, or leaving after that?”



This was a question I'd avoided for months. Every deliveryman had to make a choice at the end of their three-year term: leave with money and memories, or stay and become something else, perhaps an eternal presence.



“I haven't decided yet,” I said honestly. “Let's see what the last order is.”



We were silent for a moment. The three of us—man, dog, and shapeshifter—were crammed into the small bedroom, the city clamor outside at three in the morning. In the distance came sirens, the rumble of trucks in the dead of night, and the faint sounds of eight million people sleeping, waking, or living in the darkness.



Three minutes later, a knock came precisely on time, as if the visitor had been waiting in the hallway, counting down the seconds.



Before the door opened, I knew who it was.



Marcus stood in the hallway, but he looked different. He was no longer dressed as the warehouse manager; instead, he wore travel attire that seemed to belong to some distant era: worn, soft leather trousers, an undyed, rough linen shirt, a knee-length wool coat, patched and worn, and boots that looked like they'd been through countless roads. His eyes, usually hidden behind his ever-present Cheshire Cat smile, were now serious and focused, revealing a weariness never before seen on his face.



“Eric,” he said formally, his tone unusually heavy. “Your contract is up. Now, you’re receiving final delivery.”



“What is the final delivery?”



He entered without permission, and I noticed a leather satchel slung over his shoulder. It was old, older than anything he wore, and looked much heavier than its actual size. It tugged at his shoulder, its weight unusual, as if the bag contained something heavier than ordinary matter.



“Something most deliverymen have never seen,” Marcus said, placing the bag on my kitchen table with a dull thud, like distant thunder, like a bone settling back to the ground. “Most people spend three years doing the same routine: apartment buildings, cemeteries, and if they’re unlucky, maybe some particularly awful subway station. They make a choice, and move on, either back to normal life or getting promoted to management. But you…” He turned to face me. “You’ve been chosen to do something far rarer. Famine needs you.”



“Why does it need me?”



“War, famine, plague, death. The anchor of this world. The ancient forces that maintain the boundary between existence and non-existence.” He gestured to the bag. “They need renewal. About every sixty years, with a possible ten-year margin of error, they must self-destruct and then be reborn. The ouroboros cycle. Someone has to send them to a place of renewal.”



These words seemed to echo in the cramped apartment, emitting a tooth-ache-inducing, blurring-sight frequency. The air thinned, as if something had inhaled but not exhaled. The light flickered, then flickered again.



“And what did I send?”



“Famine itself.”



The word spread like ripples on still water. I felt a churning in my stomach, a sense of emptiness welling up inside me, as if the word itself created an emptiness that had never existed before.



Levi whimpered softly, and Biscuit snuggled closer to him.



“Why me?” I managed to ask.



Marcus pulled out a chair and sat down, gesturing for me to sit as well. Levi remained lying on the bed, silent but focused, his tail tightly wrapped around Biscuit, as if protecting it.



“Because of your bloodline,” Marcus said. “The Dorman family has always been messengers, Eric. Your great-grandfather delivered plague in 1929, at the beginning of the Great Depression. Your great-great-grandmother delivered war in 1871, during Reconstruction. And your father…” He paused. “Your father was supposed to deliver famine relief in 1985. But he ran away. Before the final delivery was confirmed, but… he strongly resisted, so we had to find someone else.”



I sat down heavily, my legs suddenly going weak. “Waiting for what?”



“This time the cycle is short and we believe it is waiting for you.” Marcus leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table. “Eric, these four timelines don’t follow a human rhythm. Sixty, seventy, ninety years—these are just suggestions, not hard and fast rules. They’re flexible in some ways, and irrelevant in others. I don’t know why, but I think Famine is waiting for Roy Dorman to have a son. Waiting for his son to join the company, waiting for him to prove himself worthy of this responsibility.”



I thought of my father in his small apartment, the walls plastered with…



“He knew it would happen,” I said softly.



“He sensed it.” Marcus smiled, but the smile was filled with sadness and pity. “But Eric, I think you can’t just let this delivery go. Someone in your blood will eventually lead Famine to revival. The only question is, is that person you, or your descendant?”



The apartment was quiet. I could hear the hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen, the dripping of the bathroom faucet I’d been trying to fix, and Levi’s rapid, shallow breathing.



“What should I do?”



Marcus stood up, walked to the window, and looked at the city lights outside. “To the Land of Revival. It lies deep in the desert, beyond the roads, beyond the maps, beyond those named places. The journey will take about two weeks. I will accompany you, as your guide. You will carry Famine.” He tapped his satchel lightly. “In the Land of Revival, you will release it. It will self-destruct, and in the process, it will destroy you.”



“Will it kill me?”



“It will completely devour you.” According to human calculations, you will exist in the cycle of Famine for about three minutes. What happens within those three minutes will determine everything. Some messengers will change, some will break, and some will never appear at all.



“What if I survive?”



Marcus turned to face me, and for the first time since I had known him, he seemed so hesitant. His usual confidence, his unwavering certainty of seven hundred years, now flickered like a candle flame in the wind. “If you survive, you’ll understand why I’ve persisted for seven hundred and forty-three years. You’ll understand the choices I made, whether they were wise, cowardly, or whatever. And you, having fully understood their significance, will make your own choices.”



Levi lifted his head from the bed, his voice soft and tense. “Does he have to go alone?”



“No,” Marcus said, his expression softening. “The escort can bring companions, if they wish.” The journey is dangerous, but no more dangerous than many of the previous delivery missions. In some ways, even safer. The desert’s hostility is undisguised; it never conceals its true nature.



“I’m coming,” Levi said, standing immediately, his tail swishing sharply, his tone resolute. “I’m going with you.”



“Levi—”



“I’m coming.” His voice was firm, carrying an adult confidence, yet his youthful face couldn’t fully bear that confidence. “You took me in. You taught me how to blend in like a human, and how to survive like an outsider. You are my family. Wherever you go, I will go.”



Biscuit stood up and barked, its voice sharp and clear. Its meaning was obvious, evident in its hunched shoulders and perked ears.



Marcus nodded slowly. “It’s settled then. Set off at sunrise. Take water, salt, and bread, nothing else. The desert provides everything it has, and what it doesn’t provide, you don’t need.”



“How do we get there? That deep desert. That nameless place.”



“Like any place we go that doesn’t belong to this world.” Marcus walked toward the door. “We’ll ride horses.” He pulled a business card from his pocket and placed it on the table next to his bag. “Meet me at this address. Sunrise. Don’t be late. Famine won’t wait patiently, even if it has waited for decades.”



He left, and the apartment seemed much larger because of his departure, as if he occupied a space much larger than his actual size. The air seemed thinner, easier to breathe.



I looked at the business card. It was an address on the outskirts of the city, on an industrial wasteland where a highway met an abandoned railway. A place I had never been, and had never needed to be.



“Dad?” Levi climbed off the bed and stood beside me, his tail still sticking out, his eyes filled with worry and childlike innocence. “Are you scared?”



I thought about it carefully. Three years ago, my answer would definitely have been “yes,” absolutely, terrified out of my wits. But three years of delivering goods had changed my understanding of fear. I understood that the universe was stranger than I had imagined, but also more logical. It had its own rules, even those not familiar to me from childhood. With caution, with careful observation, with following instructions, one could navigate it.



“No,” I said slowly, “I don’t think I’m scared. Should I be?”



“I don’t know. But I’m scared for you.”



I placed my hand on his shoulder, feeling the subtle changes in his muscles; his joints were slightly different from humans. “It’s alright. You can be afraid for both of us.” “I’ll try my best to come back alive.”



He leaned against me, his tail wrapped around my legs, a gesture of trust and affection that always moved me deeply. “You promise you’ll come back?”



“I promise I’ll do everything in my power.”



That was the most sincere answer I could give. In this job, any promise was a lie, and I had learned not to lie to those who trusted me.



We spent the rest of the time packing. The water in the bottle might never run out. The bread kept fresh longer than normal bread. Salt in leather bags. These seemingly simple things had to cope with a complex journey.



The address pointed to a stable that shouldn’t exist, a building made of old wood and even older stone, standing alone amidst broken concrete and rusty industrial equipment. The dawn painted everything gold and red, the colors of end and beginning, a symbol of death and rebirth.



The building looked incredibly old, much older than the surrounding abandoned factories and warehouses. The wood, etched black by time, was almost black; the stones, smoothed by wind and rain, were grazed smooth. There were no signs, no indications of what this place was, or the meaning of its existence. It simply stood there silently, as if it had always existed, and would always exist.



Marcus waited outside, four horses tethered to a post inscribed with symbols I couldn't decipher, symbols that seemed to change when I looked at them. Three of them were the patient, robust horses I'd seen before when transporting goods, those mares familiar with the impossible, who moved without hesitation between different worlds. They were all ordinary in appearance, brown and gray, with calm eyes and steady postures.



The fourth horse was entirely different.



It was pure black, without a single shade. Not dark brown, not dark gray, just black. As it moved, the darkness moved with it, as if the horse itself carried a lack of light, a small patch of shadow. Its eyes were wise and ancient, far beyond the age of any animal's eyes. When it looked at me, I felt a resonance that transcended sight. It saw more than just my body; it saw something deeper, something more essential.



“This is your horse,” Marcus said, pointing to the black horse. “Its name is Hiatus. It carried other messengers on their final deliveries. Now, it will carry you.”



I approached slowly, cautiously extending my hand. Hiatus lowered its head, its nostrils flaring, sniffing my breath. Its breath was warm and strong, carrying the scent of cinnamon and ashes, spices and burning, and something that shouldn't be the breath of a horse. I stroked its neck; its fur was hot, pressed against my hand.The handcuffs almost made me uncomfortable, but not painful. The feeling was just right, almost unbearable.



“Hello, Hiatus.”



He neighed softly, the sound echoing in my chest like a drumbeat, like the bass of some enormous instrument. I felt my ribs, spine, even the back of my teeth vibrate.



Levi had already claimed a mare, a gray horse, seemingly unconcerned about his unpredictable nature. The mare stood calmly as Levi checked the saddle; his movements were still somewhat unnatural, but the horse didn't seem to mind. She had carried things even stranger than shapeshifters.



Biscuit sat obediently beside the fourth horse, a brown mare with gentle eyes. It waited for Marcus to lift it into its specially made saddlebag. Biscuit settled comfortably, its head peeking out, ready to depart.



Marcus handed me a heavy leather satchel, a gesture carrying profound significance. “This is famine. Don’t open it. Don’t look inside. Don’t try to communicate with what’s inside. Just take it. When we reach the Land of Restoration, you’ll naturally know what to do. That feeling will come naturally.”



The satchel was much heavier than I’d felt in the apartment, a heaviness that wasn’t entirely physical. It had weight, yes, but also an indescribable density. Like holding a collapsed star, something crammed too much into a small space. The backpack vibrated slightly in my hands, rhythmic like breathing or a heartbeat. When I slung it over my shoulder, I felt something deep inside respond, an emptiness, as if my stomach had suddenly realized it was empty, and would always be empty, never to be filled no matter how much I ate.



“Hunger,” Marcus said, observing my expression closely, “is the presence of famine. It will grow stronger as we go. These past few weeks, no matter how much you eat, it will feel like months without food. That’s normal. This hunger isn’t a craving for food, but a craving for existence. It’s a craving for emptiness itself, a craving to be filled but never being filled.”



“That’s really comforting,” I said, adjusting my shoulder straps.



Marcus skillfully mounted his horse, his movements effortless, as if he’d been doing this for centuries. “We’ll head north, then west, and finally south into the depths of the desert. By conventional measurement, it’s about five hundred miles, but once we leave the world as depicted on a map, distance takes on a completely different meaning. Numbers no longer matter. Stay close to us. Don’t stray from the route. Once we set off, don’t look back at the cities. Looking back becomes an anchor point, and where we’re going, anchor points are dangerous.” I carefully mounted Hiatus, feeling the warmth of his body through the saddle and the power hidden in his muscles. He shifted down slightly, adjusting to my weight. I had a feeling he was sizing me up, judging whether I was worthy of his carrying.



“Ready?” Marcus asked, his gaze sweeping over each of us in turn.



“Not yet,” I answered honestly. “But let’s go anyway.” "

The sun had just risen when we set off—four riders, a dog, hungry, heading towards an unnamed place.



The city slowly disappeared behind us. I didn't look back. My gaze remained fixed ahead, on Hiatus's black ears, on the road ahead.



For the first few hours, we rode along familiar roads. The suburban houses were all identical, the lawns neatly trimmed. Nail salons, pizzerias, and dollar stores lined the streets. At gas stations, early morning commuters filled up their tanks and bought coffee from paper cups. This was typical of American urban sprawl, the infrastructure of daily life.



But as  the sun rose higher, everything began to change.



The distance between buildings began to lengthen, gaps appearing between them. Then, these gaps widened. The details of the houses became blurred, their features bland, becoming monotonous, more like symbols of houses than real homes. The commercial streets along the way also looked less authentic, like movie sets shot from the wrong angle.



By midday, we rode through an area that was no longer entirely real.



The ground beneath our hooves was hard earth, the color of old bones, dry and cracked. The sky was blue, but this blue seemed faded, as if it had been exposed to the sun for too long, the color cracking... The darkness began to recede. There were no landmarks, no features, no signs of human presence, not even a trace of human existence. No power lines. No fences, no roads, only an endless expanse of flat land, empty and desolate.



We rode in silence. The only sounds were the rhythmic clatter of hooves on the hard earth, the creaking of leather saddles, and the occasional clanging of harnesses. Even the wind was still, almost a whisper, without a scent, without stirring a speck of dust.



The hunger grew stronger.



At first it was just a slight discomfort, easily overlooked. But by the evening of the first day… This feeling, however, grew stronger. A gnawing emptiness, unrelated to my stomach. I ate dinner—the bread and jerky Marcus had prepared—but the food did nothing to alleviate my hunger. It was like pouring water into a bottomless pit. The food did reach somewhere, sustaining my bodily functions, but the emptiness remained.



That night, we camped in an open area, with no shelter, nor did we need any. The air was neither hot nor cold, just peaceful, simply existing. We didn't light a fire, because there was nothing to burn. We simply spread out our sleeping bags and fell asleep peacefully under the star-studded night sky, the stars a different color, forming constellations I couldn't recognize.



"Dad?" Levi's voice came from the darkness beside me. Seeking comfort, he had transformed back into his canine form, curled up beside the biscuit, the two dogs huddled together for warmth, even though warmth wasn't needed at night.



"Hmm?"



"How long will we go hungry?"



"Marcus said two weeks."



"Two weeks is a long time." "Yes."



"I don't like it."



"Me neither."



We were silent for a moment, then Levi said, "But we'll get through this together, right?"



"Yes." He quieted down, and soon I heard his breathing deepen as he drifted off to sleep. But I remained awake, staring at the starry sky I shouldn't have seen, my hunger growing stronger.



The next day was even harder.



The scenery before me became more abstract. The once bone-white earth was gradually replaced by something that was no longer earth; its texture was like compacted powder, fine and smooth, almost like ash. The sky's color faded even more, gradually changing from a faded blue to a near-gray, finally disappearing into nothingness.



Sometimes we could see shapes in the distance. They might be buildings, creatures, geological formations, or none of these. They swayed in the heat that shouldn't exist, because the temperature remained neutral, that peculiar, neither-hot-nor-cold temperature unique to this place. No matter how long we rode, those shapes remained forever out of reach. They were always on the horizon, unattainable, yet always present.



Hunger was ever-present, filling my chest, stomach, and throat. I ate lunch—more bread, some bland cheese. The food tasted like dust in my mouth. From that seemingly... He drinks from a seemingly inexhaustible jug, yet the water does nothing to quench his thirst. It merely flows through his body, sustaining his life, while his essence remains empty.



Levi now changes form more frequently; he cannot remain human for long. He can ride a horse in human form for an hour, then crawl on all fours beside it, whimpering softly. Then he will roll over again, forcing himself back into human form, struggling to maintain it. But hunger also affects him, making him uncontrollable, even forgetting what he was originally supposed to look like.



Only The biscuit seemed unchanged, still obediently in its saddlebag, still there, still silently keeping us company. But even it was quieter than usual, conserving its energy, vigilantly observing the surrounding scenery.



Marcus rode at the head of the group, steady and resolute; seven hundred years of experience had shielded him from the harshest aspects of the desert. But even he was quieter than usual; his signature Cheshire Cat smile had become a slight upturn at the corners of his mouth.



The next evening, we camped again in the desolate desert. I asked him, “Can things get any worse?”



“Much worse,” he said simply. “This is just the edge. We haven’t even reached the heart of the desert yet. You’ll know when we get there.”



“How worse??”



“The sand.” "



On the third day, the sand arrived.



At first, the appearance of the sand was a gradual process. The initially ash-like powder gradually became coarser, with a stronger granular texture, until finally it became real sand. At first, the sand was scattered sparsely on the bone-white earth, like sprinkled sugar granules. Then, the sand piled up into small mounds, forcing the horses to detour. Finally, the sand formed dunes, undulating stretches before us.



Accompanying the sand was intense heat.



This heat arrived so swiftly, as if we had crossed an invisible boundary, entering another world. The previously pleasant temperature vanished..." Instead, a fierce, fiery assault assaulted the area. The sky turned from gray to white, a ghastly white that stung to look at. The sun, which I rarely noticed in the ordinary world, now blazed like a scorching flame, a molten brass pan, pouring down heat as if it were liquid.



In less than an hour, I was drenched in sweat. My clothes clung to my body, stained with salt, and were very uncomfortable. Hiatus's black fur seemed to absorb the heat and reflect it back, but he showed no discomfort. He walked steadily forward, his hooves sinking slightly into the sand with each step.



Hunger became unbearable.



It was no longer just emptiness. It was a visceral pain, a churning torment in my stomach, as if something was trying to tear it out. I drank water incessantly, but it offered no relief. At midday, I tried to eat bread, but I couldn't swallow it. My throat felt blocked, refusing any food, even though my body craved nourishment.



Levi had now completely transformed into an animal, running on all fours beside the horse, his form appearing and disappearing, elusive and unpredictable, sometimes like a dog, sometimes a fox, sometimes a wolf, sometimes something else entirely—something unnameable. He had given up trying to maintain his human form. Hunger had stripped away all his pretense. That night, we camped in the shade of a sand dune, but for some reason, it offered no shade whatsoever. Even after sunset, the heat persisted, seemingly emanating from the sand itself, as if the desert had absorbed the daytime heat and then slowly released it into the night.



Marcus efficiently distributed our meager dinner as usual, but I noticed he barely ate. I realized he didn't need to eat. Whatever he would become seven hundred years from now, he had long since transcended ordinary hunger.



"How much further?" I asked, my voice hoarse from thirst despite having drunk water all day.



"Not sure,That wasn't really an answer," he said.



That night, I dreamt of hunger. Not a craving for food, but a craving for meaning, for purpose, for satiety. In the dream, I opened my mouth and found a door, from which emerged an endless procession, each one emaciated, desperate and helpless, reaching for what I couldn't give. I tried to feed them, but my hands were empty. I tried to talk to them, but no sound came out. I could only watch helplessly as they walked past one after another, hunger and despair seemingly endless.



When I woke up, I found Levi curled up beside me, his tail wrapped around my wrist, his breathing rapid and shallow. Even in his sleep, he clung to me, seeking the comfort of closeness.



"Did you have a nightmare?" “I asked softly.



He opened his eyes, which glowed faintly in the darkness—a side effect of his non-human nature. “A dream of hunger,” he whispered. “In the dream, I kept eating and eating and eating, but I still felt empty. Is this famine? Is this what it feels like?”



“I think so. I think this is famine.”



“It’s terrible.”



“Yes.”



“How do people endure this hunger? I…”



It was a good question, a compassionate one. “I don’t know, maybe humans are persistent.”



“You are human.”



“I am most of the time.”



“I think not now. After all this, perhaps you won’t be anymore.” "He's become somewhat confused.



Perhaps he's right.



By the fourth day, the scene before me had become completely abstract, disconnected from any reality I could perceive.



The dunes were no longer just dunes. They had transformed into sculptural forms, mathematical curves, hinting at some kind of intelligence. They had formed after… Their undulations were almost natural in their regularity, almost random in their perfection. Spirals, spiral lines, fractal iterations—each dune was a variation on a theme, yet I could never fully comprehend it.



Heat transcended physical temperature, transforming into something—a quality of air, an inherent attribute of existence itself. It wasn't just that the air was hot. Heat had become the fundamental essence of this place, the basis from which all things arose.



We saw something.



In the distance, some buildings appeared, shimmering in the heat waves." Swaying in the sand. Some buildings were too tall, too thin, too angular. Some towers spiraled upwards, reaching into the sky and disappearing in the dazzling light. Some walls stretched for miles, perfectly straight, defining the boundary between nothingness and nothingness. Some doorways stood alone in the dunes, like structures without frameworks, leading into empty spaces.



Sometimes, these structures were even living organisms.



On the fifth day, we passed a skull half-buried in a dune. It was enormous, a full twenty feet tall, with eye sockets large enough for me to stand inside. The bone was paper-white, clean and smooth, without a trace of flesh or cartilage. Whatever it had once been, it wasn't human, and I couldn't call it anything. Its jaw structure was off, with too many teeth, and the shape of its cranial cavity was unlike any brain structure I knew.



"What is that?" “Levi asked softly. He had struggled to regain his human form that morning, though it had taken considerable effort. He pointed to the skull, his hands trembling slightly.



“Something very ancient,” Marcus said. “Something from before.”



“Before what?”



“Before the world decided what form humans wanted to take. Before the rules solidified, before physics and biology took shape.” He pointed to the skull as we rode past. This is what I mean by the deep, layered desert. Time, place, and all possibilities are compressed here. Many things perish here. Ancient things. The original things. Things that existed in an era when reality was still debatable—you can imagine your computer's recycle bin.



As we went on, more and more bones came into view. Ribs, like cathedral arches, large enough to pass underneath. Vertebrae the size of cars, scattered across the sand like abandoned sculptures. A jawbone stretched for a quarter of a mile, teeth worn smooth by gravel, wind, and time, each tooth as tall as a person.We walked silently through the ossuary, overwhelmed by its scale, its age, and the incredible sheer size of the creatures that had once lived and perished there.



Hunger was now unbearably intense, screaming incessantly in my nerves. I couldn't remember what it felt like not to be hungry. Food had become an abstract concept, something that happened to other people elsewhere. The bread we ate was tasteless, like cardboard, like dust. Water in my mouth felt like dust, meaningless, disappointing.



By the sixth day, Levi had completely abandoned his human form. He ran alongside the horses like a hybrid of half-dog, half-fox, half-wolf, and half-something else, his form fluid and blurred, as if he couldn't remember what he was supposed to be, or found a fixed form too tiring. His tail swayed between fox-like fluffiness and wolf-like thickness. His ears were sometimes pointed, sometimes rounded, sometimes bent backward. His legs would lengthen or shorten depending on the terrain.



He no longer spoke, but communicated with whimpers, barks, and body language. But I could still understand him. We developed a vocabulary of gestures and sounds that transcended language.



Biscuit stayed in his saddlebag, conserving his energy, patiently observing the surrounding scenery. He was the only one among us who seemed completely unchanged, though I noticed he had stopped eating altogether. He would drink water offered to him, but refused food. It was as if he understood that food was meaningless here, and hunger could not be satisfied in the conventional way.



On the sixth night, Marcus spoke first, his voice breaking the oppressive silence. Because we, at least I, were all somewhat afraid of nothingness.



“You once asked me if I was happy,” he said. We were sitting around another camp, without shelter, without comfort, just a place to stop and rest for a few hours. “Do you remember?”



I nodded.



“I think the last time I felt happy was many years ago. His name is Jacob." My mouth was dry, but I sat down to rest and listen to his story.
