It’s been a horrible summer so far. Work has been really stressful, and then my boyfriend dumped me for one of my "friends," so I've spent most of the summer watching Netflix alone in my shitty apartment. It's been pretty depressing.   


  
I honestly thought a beach trip would make it better. But it didn't. It only made things worse.  


  
Everything started off great. I spent the first few days of my trip lounging on a beach and getting drunk on cheap booze from the hotel bar.  


  
That’s where I met Mia.   


  
She was another solo traveler staying at my resort. We bonded instantly, and I was thrilled to have a friend. I was having fun by myself, but it was nice to not be alone all the time.  


  
I thought maybe my new friend and I could do something together. I was feeling restless- I can only sit on a beach for so long.  
“Hey, would you want to go on a hike? Maybe see some ruins?”  


  
“What about kayaking? They said at the front desk there’s a local shop that rents them out. We could kayak to that island.”  


  
She pointed out into the horizon at a speck of green.   


  
That sounded fun. I agreed, and that afternoon we walked down to the rental shop.  


  
The interior was dim, and a ceiling fan spun lazily overhead. The man behind the counter had long dreads and wore an unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt. He smiled as we approached the counter.  


  
We rented two boats for the following morning. He pulled out a large map and showed us where to pick up the boats and gave us some basic info on how to get to the island, which was just visible on the horizon through the dingy store window. The clerk raved about the wildlife and white sands on the uninhabited island.  


  
“What’s that?” Mia interrupted, pressing her finger down on the map. I glanced over to see her indicate another speck of land, beyond the one we were headed to.  


  
“It’s a barrier island. But you can’t go out there- it’s a protected area. You’ll get fined.”  


  
Mia nodded, and asked no more about it. We paid and wrapped up our conversation.  


  
The next morning Mia and I met at dawn.  


  
We were quiet as we set off in our kayaks, sleepy and excited. The water shimmered in the morning sunlight. The temperature was already high. I dreaded how hot it would be that afternoon.  


  
We paddled over calm waters for nearly half an hour, the island looming closer and closer. When we finally landed on the white sandy beach, I was thrilled to explore. The kayak guy had said there was a short trail that would take you to a waterfall.  


  
He certainly hadn’t lied about how beautiful it was. Tropical birds screamed in the trees, and the schools of fish sped through clear water. I peered into the lush foliage, eager to start the trail.  


  
We followed the path at a leisurely pace. It was a relief to be in the shade, even that early in the day. When the trail finally ended at a thin waterfall, we both took a dip in the cool water below. I couldn’t believe how magical it all was.   


  
Back on the beach, we snacked on food packed from the hotel. I was pleased with our trip. The early morning paddle had certainly been worth it.   


  
When I suggested we load up and head back, though, Mia shook her head.  


  
“I think we should go further. To the other island.”  


  
I stared at her. “It’s protected. You heard him. We’ll get fined.”  


  
She laughed. “Oh come on! They’ll never know we were there. A couple of girls in kayaks are the least of their worries.”  


  
“And besides,” she continued, chewing her sandwich, “You were blown away by *this* place. This? This is nothing. Just imagine how much more *pristine* and beautiful a *protected* island will be.”  


  
I didn’t want to go- but I had to agree with her. This place was super cool, but I was curious about what wildlife could be on the other island. And sure- there had been evidence of humans here, trash and fire pits. Hesitantly, I agreed.  


  
Mia jumped for joy. “This is going to be so fun!” She yelled.   


  
“We have to be back by sundown. I’m not staying out there long,” I said sternly. The last thing I wanted was any legal trouble in a foreign country, no matter how small.  


  
“Of course,” she replied, eyes sparkling. Her enthusiasm was infectious.  


  
We headed for the boats, and launched them out into calm waters.  


  
I regretted the decision almost instantly.   


  
The midday sun was harsh and blinding, and I started sweating like crazy. The lifejacket only made it worse. By the time we approached the new island I knew I was getting overheated. We had only brought so much water, and I’d nearly drunk all of mine.  


  
Mia had been right though. It was beautiful.  


  
The natural beach was full of driftwood and large shells. Crabs scuttled along the sand, and birds wheeled overhead. Lizards sunned on nearby rocks. This island was even more perfect than the first.  


  
“So cool!!” Mia yelled, as we pushed our kayaks up on the sand. “And it’s all to ourselves.”   


  
We aimlessly wandered along the beach. I had no intention of going into the bush. It looked dense and unpleasant, and I didn’t want to get lost.  


  
I squatted by a tide pool for a few minutes, looking at all the shells.  


  
“Hey Mia, come look at this!”  


  
I raised my head up and scanned the beach.   


  
Mia was gone.  


  
I waited, thinking she would reappear any minute- but she didn’t.  


  
Uncertain as to what to do, I found shade under some palm trees, and kept close to the boats. I began to panic. I was on a protected island illegally, with a girl I barely knew, and no one knew we were here.  


  
What was I thinking?  


  
I waited, and I waited some more. I drank all the water. And I began to get really, really anxious.   


  
This island had been a mistake.   


  
Finally, as the sun began to drop towards the horizon, I decided to build a fire. Bugs had been eating me alive, and I thought the smoke might repel them.  


  
I piled up dry twigs and leaves and lit them with a cigarette lighter from my pack. I blew on the embers and the flames climbed the dry kindling. I sat back, pleased with myself, and looked up to see Mia standing directly over me.  


  
“Where the hell have you been??” I yelled, startled. “I’ve been waiting for you for hours!”  


  
She stared at me blankly and didn’t reply. I frowned as she sat in the sand across from me. Something was wrong. Mia was pale, and cold sweat drenched her face. She didn’t seem to recognize me.  


  
“Mia, are you ok?”  


  
Mia was a shell of her former talkative self. Irritation turned to concern, and then fear. My stomach knotted with anxiety. Something was definitely wrong. Was she sick? But how could she get sick this quickly?  


  
She didn’t speak at all the rest of the evening.  


  
I stayed with her. I didn’t know what to do. I’d never been in an emergency situation like that. Finally, as her condition deteriorated, I remembered my cell phone, lost in the bottom of my bag. I left her by the fire and went down to the water, where I tried to get service with my dwindling battery.  


  
*Does 911 even work outside the US?* I wondered stupidly. Who did I even call?   
I tried, in vain, to call the hotel, but there was no signal.  


  
Defeated, I walked back to the fire. I went over to Mia, who stared vacantly ahead.   


  
“Look Mia, we’re going to have to go back. Do you think you can paddle?” I asked her.   


  
She didn’t answer. And she didn’t move.  


  
A horrible, creeping sensation swept over me. No. No *way*.  


  
As much as I wanted to run far, far away from this dumb beach, I had to be sure. I reached my hand towards her. Flames danced in her glassy eyes, and I felt horrified as her lack of pulse confirmed what I had suspected.  


  
Mia was dead.  


  
“Oh god,” I whispered to myself. How did this happen? I cursed myself for getting into this situation. I glanced around for my things. I had to get out of there.   


  
As I shouldered my backpack I glanced back at Mia. She stonily faced the fire, looking straight ahead. *I should close her eyes,* I thought, although the idea revolted me.  


  
I reached out towards her face- and heard her stomach gurgle.  


  
I stopped. *What the hell?*  


  
And then, to my utter horror- a flood of newly hatched spiders erupted from her lips, and cascaded down onto her body.  


  
I screamed. They kept coming, hundreds, thousands of them, crawling down her body and out onto the sand.  


  
Towards me.  


  
I ran, faster than I *ever* have, to the kayak. It was long past sunset, and I paddled out into darkness, only guided by the light of the mainland.  


  
Adrenaline pumped through my veins. My arms shook as I sliced the water with a strength I didn’t know I had.   


  
It took me a long time to reach the shore. I was so overwhelmed with fear I have no idea how long I was out there, only that I held it together enough to get my boat back to the rental dock.   


  
I checked out the next morning, and rearranged my flight to come home early.   


  
I didn’t tell anyone what happened. She was basically a stranger to me, and I don’t want to be connected to her death in any way.   


  
But I know I will be. Every day, I just wait for the call.  


  
I’m worried they’ll link me to the missing kayak, abandoned on a protected island with a dead body on the [beach…](https://www.reddit.com/r/SunshineScarystories/comments/x88quz/story_index/)
