The first time I noticed something was off, it was subtle. A faint chill lingered in the air, sharper than the season warranted. It was the kind of cold that clung to the skin, impossible to shake. I didn’t think much of it at first. Winter was settling in, and I blamed the drafty old windows in my apartment.

Then came the footsteps. Faint but deliberate, they echoed behind me as I walked home late one night. I glanced over my shoulder and saw nothing—just empty sidewalks washed in the amber glow of streetlights. A rational part of me dismissed it. The city was noisy. Sounds traveled. Maybe it was just someone walking the opposite direction a block over, their steps distorted by the alleys and tall buildings.

But it happened again. And again.

It was on the third night that I began to feel the weight of it. The sound wasn’t consistent, but it was there—always far enough to seem distant, but never absent. By the time I reached my apartment door, my chest was tight with unease. As I fumbled with my keys, I couldn’t shake the sense that I was being watched. The sensation crawled over me, prickling the back of my neck.

When I finally stepped inside, I bolted the door and checked every lock twice. I even slid a chair under the doorknob, though I laughed at myself for the gesture. Paranoia, I thought. Just paranoia.

But that night, as I lay in bed, something woke me. A noise—not loud, but deliberate. It was the soft creak of a floorboard. My heart pounded as I stared into the darkness of my room. The sound came again, closer this time, as if someone were shifting their weight just out of sight. I held my breath, straining to hear over the rush of blood in my ears, but the silence that followed was absolute.

The next morning, I convinced myself it had been a dream. I went about my day, though the feeling of being watched clung to me like a shadow. At work, I found myself glancing over my shoulder, scanning faces in the crowd, searching for something—or someone—out of place. But no one stood out. Everyone seemed normal. Ordinary.

That evening, I decided to test myself. To prove that I was imagining things. I took a longer route home, weaving through unfamiliar streets. I stopped abruptly in the middle of the sidewalk, pretending to check my phone, and listened. For a moment, there was nothing. Then, faint but undeniable, I heard it. Footsteps. They stopped when I did.

I spun around, my heart hammering, but the street behind me was empty. The lights of passing cars flickered against brick walls and shop windows, but there was no one there. No one I could see.

When I reached my building, my hands were shaking so badly I dropped my keys. I hurried inside and locked the door, pressing my back against it. My apartment felt different—smaller, darker. The shadows seemed deeper, the corners more oppressive.

I didn’t sleep that night. Every creak of the floor, every groan of the pipes sent my nerves into overdrive. I sat in the living room with all the lights on, clutching a kitchen knife, waiting for… I wasn’t sure what.

Days turned into weeks. The presence, whatever it was, didn’t leave. It stayed with me, hovering just out of reach, just out of sight. The footsteps became a constant companion. Sometimes they followed me home; other times, they seemed to come from within my apartment. I would find things out of place—a book moved from the shelf, a glass I hadn’t used sitting on the counter.

I started to question my sanity. Was I losing my mind? But no matter how much I doubted myself, the feeling of being watched never wavered. It was always there, a silent pressure, a weight I couldn’t escape.

One night, I couldn’t take it anymore. I stood in the middle of my living room, heart racing, and shouted, “Who’s there? What do you want?” My voice echoed off the walls, but there was no answer. Just silence.

And then, as if in response, the faintest sound reached my ears. It wasn’t a voice or a knock. It was breathing. Slow, steady, and impossibly close.

I froze, every nerve in my body screaming to run, but I couldn’t move. The sound didn’t stop. It lingered, filling the air around me. I turned slowly, my eyes darting across the room, but there was nothing there. Just empty space.

Yet, I knew I wasn’t alone.
