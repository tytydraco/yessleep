I’m writing in my journal or a memoir if you will about my upcoming journey to Alaska. It’s mid November in 2016. Just in case if I forget what day it was. I’m not crazy or anything I’m just forgetful is all. That’s the reason I started writing in a journal. I used to just use notebook paper but now I bought a few journal books over at a local family dollar. 

I had received an invitation earlier this week to go to Alaska in an all expense paid trip. I thought it was obviously a scam so I dismissed it but curious I clicked on it just to see what they were offering. It was an official website marked by the lock icon on the web bar next to the url. I scanned the website to find a trademark scam that I usually look out for in my day to day job… It also said that I would be joined by a few other members in what is essentially a reward for these people. 

I looked through some of the names and it struck me as odd that all these people were very talented and they actually chose to invite me. I saw there was a biomedical engineer, a doctor, a biologist, a sort of an army engineer, and a few other professions that seemed more professional than what I was doing. I kept looking at the names and occupations that went with those names and I kept feeling more and more insecure.

I finally saw my name. Journalist: Dave. That’s right I’m a journalist for the local media and I do sometimes-when I have a good story-send my story to the NYT. They don’t always get published as some details were missing from the complete story and they didn’t want to take a chance on a lawsuit so I really never got a chance to be published in one of their articles. I instead would be published in my local paper from time to time. Mainly about some shooting, a robbery, or even a murder. I look out for the more grim stuff. Like my mentor use to say, “Grim news sells more news.” 

Well this will be my last entry before I make my way to Alaska. I am still befuddled on why they would even invite someone as insignificant as me at least compared to everyone else. I already finished packing and was on my way to the airport when a sudden knock hit my door. I opened it to find a grimly pale, well dressed, small boy with a letter in his hand holding it out for me to take it. I tried to strike up a conversation however he never said a word only held up the letter.

I took the letter from him and he slowly turned around and walked down the hall in janky uneven motions. He clicked the elevator button. I went back into my room pushing the thought of the boys movements to the back of my mind where all things go to be forgotten by me and I opened the letter. The writing looked old and decrepit like it came from the 1800s. It Read:

Dear Mr, 
Today you will venture upon a journey like no other. On the interweb you accepted our invitation to this adventure and we will oblige you also encourage you now take this opportunity and run with it. You may be wondering why if all people you were invited to our journey in the first place. Well we know a lot…about you. We know you love a good mystery so we will leave all the details vague for you and you can uncover these details on your own accord. For now please go to the local shipyard of your town and there will be a boat to take you to Alaska. The final point in our destination. We hope nay desire your appearance for our journey. See you soon Mr. Book. 

I questioningly stared at the letter almost as if the letters were moving on their own coming to life before my eyes almost enticing me or at least giving me that feeling. I was intrigued to say the least. I looked down the hallway hoping to find the boy waiting for the elevator as it does take 5 minutes for one to appear in this old drafty apartment. It’s more of a safety protocol rather than old building syndrome. With this draft and terrible design of the elevator system it leads to a possibility of death or maiming. I’m on the 7th floor the highest one in the building so if I do go into the elevator and it crashes it’ll be a slow and very painful death. That’s why I always take the stairs at the other end of the hallway.

I looked for the boy at the elevator side of the hall only to find no one there. A common sound of a ding as the elevator made its climb to the top floor. My floor. The elevator just made its climb and I know he went this way and pushed the button, so how did he leave? I kept thinking the stairs as a possibility. Maybe he hit the button and was impatient and went the other way towards the stairs? It was the only logical thought in my mind so I settled on it being that. 

I grabbed by bags and went out the door locking it behind me. I made it to the local shipyard only s few minutes walk from my apartment. I met up with Benny the local who gained that nickname just being friendly to the new folks that come around here and all the fisherman speak highly of him. It might also be due to him being here for 60 years. He was the town. I approached him with a smile like I always have done.

Mr Book: Hey Benny! 

Benny turned around and greeted me with a fragile smile. He looked frightened from something. I asked if he was okay and he gave me a reassuring nod.

Benny: I’m fine Mr..?

Mr Book: Mr? You don’t remember me Benny? We’ve met a hundred times before today! 

Benny shook his head as if he still didn’t recognize me. He shrugged.

Benny: I don’t remember you mister but welcome to our town!

He put out his hand for me to shake it and I looked at it with almost a disgusting feeling. 

Mr Book: It’s me Benny! It’s…

My words got caught up in my throat as I realized something very frightening and strange. I can’t remember my name. My original name. I can only remember my alias. Mr. Book. I wanted to say something else to him but the words were already coming out in frustration.

Mr Book: BOOK!! It’s Mr Book Benny! Now come in you have to know me!

He again shook his head.

Benny: I’m sorry mister but I don’t know you.

In frustration I grabbed him and in my mind I was yelling no screaming my real name to him but all that came out was the alias I was using. In a quick moment I realize I was staring at the bright blue sky while a searing pain in my back suddenly came. I’m quick retaliation he threw me down on my back. He reached out a hand to me. I took it.

Benny: Now I’m sorry about that mister but you can’t put your hands on another man and not expect any repercussions. 

I rubbed my back and was gonna try to recollect his memories of me and him sitting on the beach and drinking a cold beer together but I could barely even utter a word when I saw the ship. 

It was a small vessel not even 50 ft long enough to fit exactly 4 people. 3 crew and one passenger. I gave up on Benny thinking it was futile because maybe he did forget who I was but still I looked back at him. He was working on a piece of wood to a ship but what was even more peculiar was the fact he was in the same exact position and same exact humming tone he was singing as I approached him. It was almost as if we never even interacted with each other. I climbed onto the boat where 3 strange men grabbed my things and ushered me along to a small cabin with a bed, a desk, and a window to look out the open sea with. They left except for one who spoke in a gravely and distorted voice.

Crew Member: Dinner…will..be ready at 6 pm, lunch at 1 pm and breakfast at 9 am I advise you to never miss any of those times. 

With that he left the room and closed the door behind him as I set sail for Alaska. The final point in my journey. 

We were soon in the middle of the ocean. Only water and the sound of seagulls and the ship pressing against the waves helped me to sleep that night. It was only a day journey to Alaska and fortune from the internet about the weather only helped a little as far as comfort would go and with the waves comfort in my ears my mind I drifted to sleep.

I don’t remember much about my dream only the last few moments as I woke up. I was drowning in those moments. Flashes appeared in my mind of what drowning was like but I pushed it to the back of my mind. I heard the breakfast bell ring and I got dressed quickly to go eat. The breakfast and lunch throughout the day was actually pretty good. I didn’t expect the food to be very good today especially since the dinner last night was just salad and raw fish. Today however was eggs and bacon for breakfast and nuggets and fries for dinner. The food almost reminded me of the stuff my mom used to make. It was almost as if they interrogated her to find out her secret recipes. We know a lot…about you. The forgotten thought pushed its way to the front but I pushed it back.

*Honk* *Honk* *Honnnkk* The ships horn blows as we approached Alaska. The small ship stops by an old decrepit ramp that looked like what ships used to use for docking a long time ago. I grabbed my things and got off board. The crew members holding a salute as I leave almost as if they were statues. One strange thing I did notice was that none of them were wearing a captains uniform or even a hat or something to signify that someone was driving the ship. I looked over their shoulder and saw…no one. Nobody else was on the ship when I left and these were the only people here so…who was driving the ship? In an attempt to remain sane I simply thought the captain was in the restroom or somewhere on the ship that I wasn’t. Comfort followed this thought as I finally left the ship and entered Alaska. The final place of my journey.
