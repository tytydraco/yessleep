Hey everyone. I never thought I’d be sharing something like this. I’ve always been the skeptic in my group, the one who rolled his eyes at ghost stories and laughed at the idea of hauntings. But after what happened to me last winter, I can’t deny that some things simply defy rational explanation. I’m writing this now, sitting in my new apartment, far away from Elmwood House, hoping that sharing my experience will help me make sense of it.

My name’s Jake. I’m 32, an architect by trade, and I’ve always prided myself on my logical, analytical mind. Growing up, I was the kid who needed to know how everything worked. My friends and I used to explore old abandoned buildings, and I was always the one debunking any “creepy” noises or shadows. But this time, things were different.

I moved into Elmwood House last November. It was an old, grand mansion on the outskirts of town, a place I thought would be perfect for some peace and quiet. The house had been empty for years, and the rent was surprisingly low. The real estate agent mentioned something about the house having a “reputation,” but I brushed it off. A good deal was a good deal.

The first month was uneventful. I spent my time renovating and fixing up the place. It was a beautiful house, with high ceilings, large windows, and intricate woodwork. But then, strange things started happening. It began with small, easily dismissible occurrences. Items would go missing and turn up in odd places. Doors would open and close on their own. Typical old house stuff, I told myself.

One evening, while I was working late in the library, I heard a faint humming. It was a soft, melodic tune that seemed to come from nowhere. I tried to find the source but found nothing. The humming became a regular occurrence, always at night, always when I was alone.

While cleaning out the attic, I found an old journal tucked away in a dusty box. It belonged to a man named Thomas, who had lived in the house in the early 1900s. His entries started out normal but gradually became more erratic. He wrote about the humming, about feeling watched, and about seeing a woman in white who would appear in the mirrors.

I’ll admit, Thomas’ journal unsettled me. But I still clung to my skepticism. That changed the night I saw her. I was brushing my teeth, and when I glanced up at the bathroom mirror, she was there – a woman in a white dress, standing behind me. I spun around, but there was no one there. It happened again and again, always in the mirrors, always just out of reach.

I started researching the history of Elmwood House. It turned out that Thomas wasn’t the only one who had reported seeing the woman in white. There were stories dating back to the 1800s, all describing similar experiences – the humming, the woman in the mirrors, the feeling of being watched. I found out that the house had once belonged to a woman named Eliza, who had vanished without a trace.

Out of sheer desperation, I contacted a local medium. I wasn’t sure what I believed anymore, but I needed answers. The medium, an elderly woman named Agnes, agreed to come to the house. We held a séance in the library. Agnes seemed to go into a trance and began speaking in a voice that wasn’t her own. She said Eliza’s spirit was trapped in the house, searching for something – or someone.

After the séance, things got worse. The humming grew louder, the apparitions more frequent. I could barely sleep, barely think. One night, I woke up to find Eliza standing at the foot of my bed. This time, she didn’t vanish. She reached out a hand, her eyes filled with sorrow. I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. She leaned in and whispered, “Help me.”

I don’t remember much after that. I must have blacked out. When I came to, it was morning, and I was lying on the floor of the library. I grabbed a few belongings and fled the house. I left everything else behind. I couldn’t stay there another moment.

It’s been six months since I left Elmwood House, and I’m still trying to piece together what happened. I’ve been staying with friends, moving from place to place, but the nightmares haven’t stopped. I still see her sometimes, in my dreams, standing at the foot of my bed, whispering, “Help me.” I don’t know what she wants, but I’m terrified that I’ll never be free of her.

I’m writing this now, in the hope that someone out there might know what to do. Maybe someone has experienced something similar and can offer advice. All I know is that Elmwood House changed me, and I can’t go back to the person I was before. If you’ve read this far, thank you. And if you’re ever in the market for a new home, stay away from Elmwood House.
