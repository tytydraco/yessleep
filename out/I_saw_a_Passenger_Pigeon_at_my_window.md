The title explains it, for a living I do Accounting and during Covid we had to go online. My company just kinda stayed online ever since and I’ve been home alone while my Husband goes to work. Due to this I’ve developed a weird fascination with birds and the study of them. We have this big front window and I put a bird feeder against said window so I can watch all the birds that come in to eat while studying and observing their behaviour out of curiosity. 

This day was like any normal day, I woke up alone in bed since my husband works early hours , made the bed, went downstairs and grabbed breakfast and overall had a very relaxing start to the day. That was until I heard the front door slam shut, this was weird since my husband was at work and we don’t have any kids , I was the only one home so who slammed the door shut? I peered my way into the front hall only to find nothing? “Strange” I whispered to myself before turning the front door lock and looking out the side windows, the fog and haze  was very bad today due to all the wildfires happening up north. “Shit” I wanted to go shopping today but I don’t really want to go out in such poor conditions. I walked back upstairs to my room since we have an on suit which is where I get ready for my day. Only something was odd. My husband was still in bed , this was strange since I swear I had woken up alone and it was way past the time he would leave for work. I just assumed that maybe I had read his schedule wrong and today was his day off.

I went and had a shower, brushed my teeth and did all the essential stuff to start my day. I went downstairs into the living room to find Cody asleep on the couch, Cody was our 7 month old Berneadoodle we adopted. He’s such a good boy and keeps me company when my husband isn’t home. I sat down beside him and looked out the window to the bird feeder. 


That’s when I saw it. 

I squinted my eyes for a second , thinking I was probably just mistaking it for a different breed of bird. I remember I had seen a tik Tok talking about passenger pigeons with a drawing of one. I quickly grabbed my phone from my pocket and open tik Tok. Flying through my watch history and then I saw the video. I compared the two , the bird I was currently looking at to the drawing. They were identical. 

“Attention: have you seen this bird? Hopefully you have not, as this is a Passenger Pigeon and it is extinct. If you have infact seeing this bird, you have fallen through some sort of rip in the fabric of time and reality. REMAIN CALM.” 

My heart dropped. What? This has to be some sort of joke . Tik Tok is full of lies and misinformation. Gen z has to just be playing a joke. I started searching up articles and it was true. Cases of people seeing this pigeon are becoming rapid . I was shaking and was confused.

I heard a sound from upstairs, it knows I know. It sounded like a limp chunk of meat hitting the ground. Kinda like a dead body hitting the ground after jumping from a tall building. I gulped as I grabbed Cody’s collar and dragged him into the front halls closet. We both sat there in pitch darkness due to the fog trapping the sunlight. If there even is a sun here. Where ever I am. 

I heard running from upstairs , just feet hitting the hardwood floor . No purpose just running. I don’t think that thing was my husband, and I’m sure as hell great full I didn’t try to wake it. 

It’s been 12 hours. I think at least, all I’m going off of is my phones clock, if it’s even real in this universe. I don’t know where I am or how to get out of it. That thing upstairs fell off the banister an hour ago. The sound of bones breaking and blood slamming against the hardwood floor echos in my head . I think it’s moved but I’m not taking the chance. It’s gross in this closet , my pants are soaked and Cody is whining. 

I’m not even sure what’s real at this point, what if Cody is one of them aswell? I don’t know. My phones at 8% , when it dies I will loose all connection to people outside of this house. I’ve tried praying but to no help. I’m scared and I don’t know what to do, I’m thinking of letting Cody out of the closet to see if he’s real or if it kills . I’ll update.
