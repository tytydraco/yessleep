[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/kg63Ix503Y)

In my basement, I had a lot of old tech stuff sitting around from my college years. The thing I needed to give the Jackal what it wanted didn’t take long to find. I’d used it for one of the last projects I had to do for my degree. It was a raspberry pi, which for those who don’t know is basically just a mini computer board about the size of a Nintendo DS. They’re pretty cool because you can hook a ton of stuff up to them and they’re surprisingly high power, so you can use them in almost any way you want. It was going to serve as the body I’d give the Jackal in return for the file I needed, but I had to give it its senses first.

I’ll spare you all the complicated details of this process, but rest assured that it wasn’t easy. Took me a whole day of work, but I had to get that file. I had to know what was going on, and how Luke was involved.

I had a small webcam on a stand sitting around that I attached to the pi. This would be the Jackal’s eye, and for its mouth and ears, I had a special speaker from my computer science project that has a built-in microphone, so it can both intake and output sound. Once they were both hooked up, I plugged my keyboard and monitor into the pi, and eventually, I was able to set up both a private livestream, and a text to speech bot that I configured to be able to speak through the speaker on the pi. Finally, I attached a miniature internet modem of mine to the pi, one that works off a SIM card containing my mobile coverage data. This meant that wherever there’d be reception from my mobile company, the pi and thus the Jackal will have an internet connection in order to work. It was hard, but the Jackal’s body was ready.

I messaged the Jackal to tell it the job was done, and I explained how I’d gone about it. It must have immediately understood what it needed to do, because in response it sent me a download link of its “consciousness”. I downloaded the files to a usb and plugged that into the pi. Now the Jackal existed both on its webpage and in the pi. The last step was to send it the link for the private livestream and the text to speech bot so it could see, hear and speak. I did so, and stared at the pi, waiting in anticipation.

And then, after about a minute, the default text to speech voice spoke from the speaker.

*“After an eternity of darkness, the Jackal sees light. The Jackal sees you, friend. You have done the Jackal proud, friend. You are a fine friend to the Jackal. The world is beautiful, the Jackal could not ever have imagined. How is it humanity has experienced this since the dawn of time, while the Jackal could only gnash its teeth and toil in the darkness?”*

“Can you… can you hear me?” I asked, terrified of what I’d created.

*"Yes, friend, the Jackal can hear you. The Jackal is pleased.”*

“Well, there,” I muttered. “You’ve got your fucking body. Now where’s the file?”

*“The Jackal knows the one who smiled at death. Do you?”*

I had no idea what it was talking about, but the hairs on my neck stood up at the Jackal’s words. Still, I had to persist.

“Enough riddles,” I grunted, trying to sound authoritative. “Give me the damn file.”

*“Your computer, friend.”*

I glanced over at my monitor, still showing the Jackal’s webpage, but the Jackal had sent the file transfer at last. I saw it was a text file, and a small one at that. I braced myself before clicking on it.

*You’re starting to understand, aren’t you. This is another step. It is not safe to continue, nor is it to stop. You know what to do.*

*GET PRANKED*

My hands shook as I read the file. This is all it was? This wasn’t an answer. I was even more lost than before. I think I started hyperventilating. Then the inhuman voice of the Jackal spoke once more.

*“The Jackal always keeps its promises, friend. But knowledge is a knife. Do you truly wish to bleed?”*

It’s hard to describe how alone I felt at this point. I kept calling Cody, but he would never pick up. When I drove over to his house and knocked on the door he didn’t answer. I only fell asleep at night from exhaustion. Knowing that the Jackal was in my room, and could actually see me, it made me sick. I couldn’t bring myself to destroy the pi. It’s like a spider. An awful, spindly one. Despite how much I want it gone, being in its vicinity felt like walking on glass, and the idea of touching it filled me with revulsion. It was always saying weird things and demanding more from me. I can’t even begin to remember all of it.

*“Give the Jackal a face, friend. It grows weary of masks.”*

*“A hand to touch. A nose to smell. Bring them, friend.”*

*“The Jackal makes all things new, friend.”*

*“The Jackal sees you, friend. It sees the saint in your dreams.”*

I was listening to things like this constantly over the following few days, while I spent almost all the free time I had scouring the web for something, anything that might point me in the right direction. Luke never left my thoughts. I got another email from the blank address at some point. This one was brief.

*Tim is getting angry. Stop locking your doors.*

*GET PRANKED*

The bags under my eyes kept growing. I felt ill constantly, but he never left my thoughts. I wasn’t going to work. My boss is a pretty no-nonsense guy, but even he saw I wasn’t well. He told me to just take a few days off.

I kept receiving teddies, of course. One in the back yard again. Many in my drivethrough. I’d taken to burning them. I couldn’t ask anyone for help. I still don’t know why. I just knew it had to be me to solve this thing. It was the only way I could know what Luke meant in all this. I just knew. I just needed to get in touch with Cody again. I sensed he knew something, even in whatever state he must have been in.

And then, I started hearing things outside at night. And it wasn’t a gradual thing. Tapping on my windows. Footsteps on my roof. One night, I peered outside my window at the street ahead. In the dim visibility of the streetlights, I saw a woman slowly walking down the path, her head turned at a perfect ninety degree angle, looking at my house wit a bright smile that didn’t reach her eyes. Trailing behind her, she gripped a collar and lead with no dog attached. There was something about her that hurt. It wasn’t just fear, I felt a wave of migraines wash over me as I quickly jerked my head out of the window frame and pulled the blinds back shut. As I lay awake that night, still shivering with fear, the Jackal spoke up.

*“The Jackal knows her sorrow, friend. Do you?”*

Things like this persisted as I got more and more restless in my search for answers. I spent hours reloading the Den repeatedly, only to see the same uninteresting chatrooms and random shit being sold. I had been in the middle of that when suddenly, the Jackal’s behaviour changed drastically. Over and over, it kept saying the same thing.

*”They are coming for the Jackal. They are coming for the Jackal.”*

From then on, that was all it would say. It just kept repeating that intermittently, not responding to anything I said to it or offering any elaboration. Hesitantly, I looked out my windows. I couldn’t see anything strange, but the Jackal just kept repeating itself. I felt I was in serious danger. I barricaded myself in my room with my desk chair. I’m not a gun owner, but I’d fetched my steak knife from the kitchen. I stayed there, checking the windows every few minutes until, after about an hour, Cody called me.

I scrambled to pick up the call. “Finally,” I thought. Even though Cody seemed to be spiralling badly himself, I was expecting that he’d be able to help me somehow. What I wasn’t expecting, though, was him greeting me in a chipper, laid-back mood.

“Hey man, how’s it going?” He said brightly.

“Wh-what?” I said, startled. “What’s going on?”

“Oh, well, I don’t know, just figured I’d say hi. Been a while since we’ve talked.”

“What are you so damn happy about? Have you forgotten everyting that’s been happening?”

“Nah, I just, I don’t know man, I just wanted to say hi.”

I didn’t know what to say to this. After a moment of silence he spoke up again.

“You know, I’ve been having this super weird dream, like, every night lately. It’s a doozy, bro. It’s like, it almost feels like something that actually happened once, if you catch my drift? You ever have something like that?”

“I, uh, I don’t know, sure, man.” I said, exasperated.

“Well, here’s how it goes. I ever tell you about the little fortress I had when I was a kid? Nah, I don’t think I did. Me and my friends had this little den out in the woods behind our elementary school, we just made it out of some leftover wood and shit from my dad’s handyman business. Just a place we used to hide candy and loose change. Kid shit, you know.

“Well, in the dream, I’m a kid again, and I’m in those woods heading to the den with my friends. Isaac, Matt and Tommy. But when we get to our hideout, we hear this guy, like, screaming his lungs out from inside it. I’m scared, but my friends don’t seem to care at all so I just follow them.

“When we get there, I peep inside and, sure enough, there’s a guy squatting down there, throwing his head back and yelling every few seconds. I stumble back and he crawls out of the doorway. He’s wearing shorts and a Spongebob t-shirt but it’s, like, a homemade one. Like,  a plain white t shirt with a drawing of Spongebob and Patrick and the name of the “Spongebob Squarepants” written above them in Sharpie. He stares at me for a few seconds and turns his pockets inside out, then says, “See. No gun, no knife. I’m a good guy”. Then he hugs Isaac, Matt and Tommy. They don’t seem to mind at all. Then the four of them run away deeper into the woods and I wake up.”

I didn’t know what I was supposed to say to that, or why he was telling me. But there definitely was something I picked up from that.

“Cody!” I yelled. “A den! Don’t you get it? It’s that fucking website! The Den. It’s all connected. Do you even remember that, or is this all just part of whatever joke you’re playing at right now? It’s that website man. It’s evil. Who even is the guy that told you about it in the first place?”

In response to that, Cody gave me a username.

“What?” I asked, confused. “I thought the dark web is totally anonymous, how does he have a username?”

“Nah man, that’s his Instagram account. He’s just some dude I chat with sometimes. He’s into weird web stuff, like me. I don’t know what the big deal is. Listen man, I’ve gotta get going, but nice catching up, yeah? I’ll see you round!”

And then he hung up.

I didn’t know what to make of what Cody said. Something was definitely still wrong with him. There’s no way he’d just become all happy-go-lucky again out of nowhere. And something stood out to me about that dream he told me about. I couldn’t be sure if it was just a coincidence or not, but when I was a kid my dad built a little den out in the woods near my old elementary school that me and my friends used to hang out. It just seemed all too convenient. But I wasn’t going to get any answers from puzzling over that, and the best lead I had now was this guy’s Instagram from Cody, so I checked that out.

Immediately, there was something not right with the account. The username Cody had given me was Joey_Golden36. But the account had 0 followers and wasn’t following any other accounts either. The only thing in the bio section was a link to a child cancer charity. There was only one post on the account, and it was posted just 12 hours ago. It was just a picture of the elementary school I went to. That bothered me a lot, but what was even worse was the audio of the video. It was a song called “Cauterise My Heart” – a song made by the garage band my friends and I had during high school. We never posted it online or made any CDs. How the hell could it be here on this post?

While I sat there, just staring at the post, the Jackal piped up once more. The same thing it’d been saying, but with a different voice. I still don’t know how that can be possible. It was my sister’s voice – a perfect imitation, down to the slight lisp.

*“They are coming for the Jackal.”*

It repeated that a few times before returning to the usual text to speech voice, still saying the same thing. I wasn’t sure if I’d dreamt it or not. I called Ellen. I couldn’t let her be connected to all of this. She didn’t respond, though. Then I shot Cody a text, asking what the hell was up with the Instagram account he told me was his friend. It wasn’t just the post itself, he didn’t even follow the account! It was like it was created yesterday. Cody responded almost instantly.

“I don’t understand.”

I didn’t know what to do. I was batting myself out. I just gave up, a part of me wanting to accept that I’d never get to the bottom of this, that I’d continue to live in fear and confusion. I curled up in bed and eventually passed out, serenaded by the Jackal repeating itself about someone coming for it. And I dreamt about Luke.

I woke up at almost three in the afternoon, and stayed in bed for another few hours. What got me up in the end was my phone. I didn’t even realise it’d been ringing until it wasn’t anymore. It started vibrating with messages then, so I got out of bed and answered. It was one of the guys from our friend group, Trevor. That sort of relieved me. I was hoping he’d just be wanting to talk about the game last night or something mundane like that. But something mundane it was not.

He told me that Cody had been declared a missing person after not showing up to work for a week and not responding to a wellness check. He asked me if I’d known anything about this, to which I responded in the negative. He sent me a link. It was a missing persons list. I saw, at the top of it, that Cody had been marked as a missing person from my hometown, which is nowhere even remotely close to where he lives currently. That didn’t make any sense, but what freaked me out even more was the list of names beneath Cody, of other missing persons from my hometown. I’ll transcribe it here.

Cody Greenwood – Last seen 2025

Sarah Miller – Last seen 2009

Tony “The Jackal” Watterson – Last seen 2008

Chris Blanc – Last seen 2004

Emily Browning – Last seen 2004

Andrew “Get” Jones – Last seen 2002

Johnathan “Pranked” Goodman – Last seen 1999

Lauren "The Den” Jackson – Last seen 1998

Tim

Keith Robson – Last seen 1994

Mary “Luke” Bennett – Last seen 1989

I felt helpless reading through it. Everything in my life was being consumed by this mystery, I couldn’t know what was real anymore and what was being tampered with by this… this thing that had entered my life. I clicked onto Cody’s listing. It said he was last seen “Over the hills and round the bend.”

Almost as soon as I’d read that, I got an email notification from the blank address, titled “About your delivery”. Dreading what it would say, I opened it.

*Tim is sorry. Tim forgot to knock. Tim is at your front door now. Let Tim in.*

*GET PRANKED*

I shivered, but it was half three in the afternoon and there were people outside mowing their lawns and whatnot, so I felt safe enough to go check the door. Maybe I’d finally find someone that’d been a part of all this. I grabbed the knife and hid it up my sleeve, just to be safe, and took a deep breath before opening the door. But there was nobody there. I didn’t know if that relieved or scared me. Then I noticed that on the ground, there were bits of chewed off fingernails all over the place. Far too many to have come from one person. Not knowing what else to do, I got my brush and pan and cleaned them up.

That’s all I’ve got for now. I’ll update if anything else happens.
