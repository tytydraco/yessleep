You may need some context, so [here's a link to my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hrb758/something_is_in_my_house_but_its_not_a_ghost/).

So... here's what has happened since my last post: I did what one of you recommended, and in the evening, I went to the local market to pick up some sage, resin incense, and whatever else could fit into a chain-held incense censer; which I also purchased in one of those... weird stores, in which they also sell crystals and angel statues.

It really makes it hard to believe in the power these items hold when they're on sale.

I hid everything from my partner and stashed it all under the bed, I didn't want him to worry about my mental health of all things... I come from a very cynical background, a rarity in a mostly Catholic nation... so my out-of-the-blue purchase would be impossible to explain.

Just when I returned home I received another notification... someone in my last post mentioned the "fae" and I remembered that such tales are common here in Colombia as well.

I stumbled upon a particular term; "Duende" which comes from the words "Due√±o de casa" which means something along the lines of "The master of the house" They are indeed described as tiny fae creatures that invade a person's home and pester them.

But I feel this goes vastly beyond "pestering" this feels malicious.

I investigated further on the matter... but it's mostly old wives' tales, nothing concrete. There wasn't a particular chant or ritual to get them out, nothing like that, so no luck there.

One of you mentioned I should try to contact the previous owner, but he left for Europe as soon as I paid and nobody we know has his new phone number... I think the bastard wanted to run away from the situation before it blew over, but... it could be the powerless feeling speaking.

For all I know my tormentor could simply have entered the house in the short period in which it was abandoned....

I figured then that if I was out of options I might as well try to follow the advice one of you gave me...  I went to sleep with resolve in my mind.

...

I wake up in the middle of the night. I'm staring straight at the ceiling, in my bed...

I try reaching for my phone... and my hand doesn't move.

I felt as if every single one of my limbs had been nailed down violently to the bed, my eyes barely moved, and my mouth was frozen...

The first thing I saw were those elongated, pale fingers crawling into view from my left side, where the bed ended, like a hideous tarantula perching itself in my face... slowly treading the stone-like appendages through my face... in a circular motion.

That disgusting little monster was caressing my face almost mockingly. I tried screaming, but my body didn't answer... I could feel my anger boiling inside, my eyes tearing up from the helplessness of experiencing this so close to someone who cared for me and would likely help if I could produce but a murmur.

...This ritual lasted the whole night...

As soon as sunlight came in from the window the little monster went away again, I sat on the bed... the tiredness in my joints and the tears in my cheeks confirming that I hadn't just awoken from the most horrible nightmare in my life... the bed was drenched in sweat.

I was downstairs, my hands struggling to hold a coffee cup when the alarm clock of my partner started ringing... I looked like such a mess that he immediately bought into the fact something wasn't right.

I shrugged him off as having night terrors... it wouldn't be the first time. He eventually had to leave for work.

And I began executing my plan like I had been born for it, opened every window in the house, one by one, even in the rooms that were a mess; grabbed the stuff from beneath the bed and began walking through the house with the incense sensor smoking the whole place...

I'm not a person of faith, by any means, but I am certain I have never prayed to my God with so much fervour before... I spent the early morning doing it asking to any powers of the divine providence I could recall to get this evil off my house, to extinguish the hold it had on me... until the clock marked 12 pm.

At that point I sat down, sweating profusely, the house filled with a smoke that slowly escaped through every window like a holy-mist of some sort... and I felt...

Free...

I saved up all of it and closed the windows back up... I even used the rest of the afternoon to clean up the mess in the rooms I had once locked... I no longer feel fear in this house.

It feels mine now.

I'm writing this with tears in my eyes, I can't believe it's over.

Thank you all.
