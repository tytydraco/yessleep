Hey everyone. I’m not sure if this is the right sub but I'm just looking to get some answers?
For the last few months, I feel like I’ve been going absolutely crazy. I have been trying to talk to my friends about this. At first, they were scared but now I just see the annoyance in their eyes as I bring it up time and time again. I can’t sleep; I’m not eating. I feel like a shell of the person I once was. 

It all started on the 9th of April 2021, around 2am. For context, I live in a village north of British Columbia; bear country, I’m reminded by those around me. At first it was a light rustling in the leaves outside my window. I was already half asleep, so I didn’t think too much about it. That was, until scratches sounded from below. My house is on the outskirts of town surrounded by heavily wooded area. Before you comment, yes, I know what noises wildlife make. This was, I don’t know, different? I’m a relatively calm person, but this had me a bit on edge. It was if there were footsteps, human, creeping around and dragging their nails down a wall. A typical scene in any horror movie, I know.
I live alone so I’m pretty used to weird noises every now and then. But this, I just had a bad feeling about. However, nothing more really came from the window that night and I eventually fell asleep.

That was it for a few weeks. I didn’t give much thought to it and got overwhelmed with my work. I’m a paramedic, so my schedule is constantly changing. I’m exhausted and the stress often means plenty of restless nights. 

It was just another night; I had completely brushed off the noises and was trying to get in some sleep before my shift at 6am. That’s when I heard it again. Footsteps moving around outside my window. I instantly jolted up and lent over my bedframe to get a look. It was pitch black out. I turned my phones flashlight on and pressed it against the glass. And of course, the noise stopped. The light wasn’t much help, it just reflected back into my room, so I switched it off and tried listening out. Silence. Dead silence. I sat there completely still just waiting and waiting for something to happen, but nothing did. I got back into bed agitated before finally getting some sleep. 

After my shift I met up with one of my friends, Amber Welsh (fake name for privacy), and told her what had happened those two nights. She was creeped out but reminded me that it just could’ve been an animal and tried easing my concern. And at the time, I believed her. Why wouldn’t i? I live right next to the woods, it’s a reasonable answer. I felt better after talking about it with her and thought that was the end of it. God, I wish it was the end of it. 

It didn’t happen all at once. Enough to make me scared shitless, but not enough to warrant too much concern straight away. Weeks started turning into every other day until it started turning into daily. Each night when I wasn’t working a double or overnights, id be about to fall asleep and hear those fucking steps, back and forth right outside my window. And each time, I’d try something new. I go outside and check with my torch, id watch out my window, I’d try filming before I fell asleep. Nothing. Every time I came up with nothing. 

Each time id message Amber: it happened again last night, I swear somethings fucking with me. 
It really started to scare her until fear turned into worry. She would sleep over a few nights a week and every time there’d be silence. Eventually I got a message from her:

hey dude. I’m starting to get worried about you. I don’t doubt you’ve been hearing things at night but whenever I’m there nothing happens. I’m beginning to think the stress from work is affecting you more than you realise. I love you so much and I’m here for you anytime, but I don’t think I can help you in the ways you need it right now. I think it’d be a good idea if you maybe reached out to someone? I’d be happy to go with you or support you in any way, just lmk xx

I’ve been stressed before, but this, this isn’t stress. I know it isn’t. I’m so scared and I don’t know what to do. I feel nauseous all the time that I’ve stopped eating. I spend each night staring out the window, watching, waiting for anything, something to reveal itself. 

So, people of reddit, please help. I need to do something otherwise I will lose it. I don’t know how much more of this I can handle, and I can’t afford to move right now.

UPDATE: 
Hey everyone, I wasn’t expecting this post to be seen by so many people. Thank you for all the support and advice I’ve received!

To answer a few questions:
1.	The noises generally happen between 12am-3am. I’ve been keeping a record of each time it happens so I could see if there was a pattern.
2.	While stress from being a paramedic has had a big impact on me, I haven’t been having visions or other occurrences outside the footsteps and scratching sounds. That’s why I don’t think it is related
3.	Amber is my best friend and a fellow paramedic. She understands the stress that it comes with but hasn’t experienced anything like this. 

To the people who suggested getting cameras, I’ve ordered some from amazon and they should be coming within the next few days. Its only happened a few times this week but still haven’t been able to see anything. I really hope these cameras will capture something. Ill update when they arrive or if something else happens

UPDATE 2:
I'm struggling to breathe right now. Its 2.36am and I heard the footsteps like normal. Except this time, it sounded as though they were far away and sprinting towards my window. They were thudding back and forth and now it sounds like something is being dragged back out to the woods. I’ve tried calling amber, but she won’t pick up. The cameras arrived yesterday, and I set them up straight away. But when I checked them before writing this, it caught nothing. 
It was right outside my window, why the fuck hasn’t anything showed up. I can’t deal with this, I think I might actually be going insane. Maybe Amber was right, maybe it’s all in my head. I just can’t shake the feeling that something is really wrong.

UPDATE 3:

Hey guys. A few people were requesting an update, so I thought I’d let you know what’s been going on. 
It’s been a couple months since I first made this post. The sounds come and go, sometimes its every night, other times I won’t hear it for weeks. A few of you told me I should make a police report.
A week ago, I went in after another night of trying to block out the steps. I talked a kind officer who tried to reassure me but said they unfortunately can’t do anything since there were no laws being broken and no official evidence. However, she suggested a patrol unit could survey the area for a few nights and see if they could catch anything. I agreed and thanked her profusely, feeling a lot better than I had in months.
 
For the first time, I felt like someone actually believed me and I finally got a few nights of decent, albeit short sleep. 
I got a phone call from the officer in the following days letting me know that the patrollers didn’t catch anything unusual. She also let me know that there were no reports from surrounding neighbours, but the night crew were aware of my situation and would keep a look out. That’s something, I guess. 

I’ve gone back to sleepless nights again. If the police couldn’t catch anything, is there something wrong at all? On the times that I do sleep, its filled with endless nightmares. Theres this one that keeps occurring. I'm on my bed watching out the window like usual, when I hear the footsteps coming from inside followed by a guttural clicking sound. And all of a sudden, something cuts me from behind. I turn around and it slices me, down my body and blood begins to leak from the different wounds. I never get a chance to see what it is in the darkness, but I bleed to death on the bed that I’ve barely been able to leave. 

I haven’t really heard from Amber lately. After I told her I wouldn’t see a counsellor, she began to distance herself. Her replies became shorter, and she stopped answering my calls. No one has seen her from work; it’s like she’s disappeared. She was the only person I had left and now I don’t even have her to talk about this with. 

As for the cameras, they have captured everything from squirrels to a family of bears but nothing that can be traced back to the noises I'm hearing.

UPDATE 4:
So…
I had to change a couple of settings on the cameras to be extra sensitive to any disturbances. And tonight, this morning whatever, its finally caught something. But I wish it hadn’t. Reddit won’t let me upload the image, but I’ll try my best to describe it.

The camera was facing out into the woods, with a built-in sensor light activated. Theres no colour and at first, everything looks still and quiet. But when I looked closer, I can see the faintest outline of what I wish I could call a human. It has the features of a human: 2 legs, arms, and a torso. But when it got to the head, from what you can see in the grainy footage, appears to be cocked to the side with the jaw in an almost broken, locked position as if gasping for air. There was no light reflected in its eyes and strands of matted hair fell down its limp body. It almost looked as though it were standing dead. 
And that’s the thing, all these nights hearing footsteps and this (creature?) was dead still. Not moving from its position based near some trees deeper in the woods. 

I saved the footage but after checking the camera and my photos, its not there anymore. I don’t know what the fuck I’ve caught, I'm somehow even more scared than before.




UPDATE 5:

November 13th
I apologise if there’s any mistakes in this update, my hands won’t stop shaking and I can’t really look at the screen. I didn’t hear any footsteps before I went to sleep tonight and ended up having my usual nightmare. The clicking sound was so loud it felt like it was right in front of me. Until I woke up and realised It was. Standing there in the darkest corner of my room is the fucking creature. Before I couldn’t make out its full details through my phone screen. But right now, here in front of me it stands.

Although different to how I remember, its unmistakable. Black, oily hair lays on the naked and disfigured body of the person I once loved. Her eyes have been hollowed out leaving a wet and empty space where Ambers blue gaze once was. Her jaw is locked in a twisted scream and bloody drips cover her chest all the way down to her thighs. Her once tan complexion has turned into a pale, shrunken flesh stretching over her body.
From deep in her throat is the sound I haven’t heard from anywhere else but my nightmares. A low raspy groan interrupted by a shrill clicking sound is the only sound she’s making. She hasn’t moved; it doesn’t look like she’s breathing. 

I’ve barely been able to type this, I can’t look at her, but I also can’t look away. I'm too scared to breathe, too scared to call the police. I don’t know what to do. I'm not sure if she will hurt me or why she’s here, I just want to close my eyes and hope it all goes away.

It feels as though the last few months I have been living through the eyes of someone else’s body. My memory is foggy, and I feel as though everything around me is darkness. I don’t know where I am or the last time I slept.
Wait where am i?
The furniture looks familiar. Too familiar. 
It looks to be some kind of bedroom and guessing from the uniform strewn over a desk chair and once stacked books on the bedside table, thrown to the floor, my room starts to take shape in my mind. The moon shines in through the window, which is wide open, spider webs forming across the opening reminding me it hasn’t been closed for almost a year. 
And in my bed, is the shape of a sleeping body, quiet and peaceful. 
A body. In my bed. And it looks like me.
I begin to scream but the only noise that comes out is a distorted groan and clicks of a broken gasp. 
The sleeping me, she, i? wakes up in an instant and stares at me in horror. The colour drains from her face, and she reaches for her phone. I try to make my way over, but I can’t move, and I'm overcome with the burning pain of open cuts down my body. 
I don’t understand what’s going, what the fuck is going on? I try to slowly move my gaze down and read the name scribbled on a journal next to the pile of books

It reads 
Property of Amber Welsh
