Not as in it will turn off and on, or that it’ll drip. No I mean my air conditioning unit is following me around. It started a few months ago. I woke up hot as hell so I went to see if my air conditioner box broke or turned off but to my surprise it was missing. I looked on the front yard to see if it fell but it wasn’t there. “Fucking crackheads” I thought in annoyance. I picked up my phone and decided to order a new AC box while eating some cereal. When I got to the kitchen I found it.

My Air Conditioner had grown legs overnight. It was walking in circles on long Barbie doll like legs that elevated the air conditioner to the height of a German Shepherd. It was blowing cold air at me despite the power cord dragging behind it like a tail. In spite of being weird looking I was still freaking out since my Air conditioner was walking. I screamed and tripped on god knows what and was cornered with my back to the wall. “OH FUUUCK NOOOOOO!” I screamed as my ungodly household appliance jogged towards me. I threw my arms up and braced for a painfully over the top B horror movie death with buckets of fake blood and shitty anatomy. 

After an hour of waiting I shivered and looked up. My AC was standing next to me still blowing cold air not doing anything. I stood up and started backing away slowly. The air conditioner took a few steps toward me in return. I walked towards it, it didn’t react. I pushed it back slowly with my foot but it just walked back over when I pulled my foot back. I kicked its legs out from under it and in response the creature kicked itself to its gross feet like a fighter in an old Kung fu movie. I was already fed up with this bullshit. So I took my crowbar that I keep next to my fridge and smashed my Air Conditioner until it was a mess on the floor. When I was done I looked at my watch. “OH SHIT I’M LATE FOR WORK” I screamed out loud before rushing to get ready. 

When I got in my car the air conditioning was waiting on the passenger seat keeping my seat cold. “Shitballs” I said irritably to no one in particular. As weird as this was I had shit to do today so I got in the cold car and started to drive occasionally shooting a bombastic side eye at the creature beside me. “Can you at least buckle up? There’s a cop up ahead”. It didn’t respond. 


It’s been like this for months and I’m starting to get annoyed. It’s winter where I am so I need to bundle myself up twice as much as what I normally would. If I want to start the day with a nice cup of hot coffee or end the day with a nice warm bowl of chunky soup then I need to do it quickly since it’ll get cold quick now. I had a cold the other day and I needed to bundle up with at least 8 blankets to keep warm. I do work working for a living and it’s super frustrating when the glue drys twice as quick and there’s sawdust blowing everywhere.

I can’t tell anyone about it either. No matter who I tell their response is always the same. They look at the Air conditioner box and back to me with a frog-like expression and say “huh cool.” And walk away saying nothing else about it. Aside from taking a crowbar to it I’ve tried throwing it out the window, chucking it in the oven, even blowing it up with C4 didn’t do Jack-shit. I’m at a lose of what to do, I just want to be warm again but no matter what I do my air conditioning box won’t stop acting weird
