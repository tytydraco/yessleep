I’ve never been one to indulge in self-care. Life as a young professional in a bustling city left little room for such luxuries. But after months of grueling hours at work, my body ached for relief, and my mind desperately needed a break from the chaos.

So, when I heard about Elysium Touch, the new massage parlor that had opened just down the street, I was intrigued enough to give it a try.

As I stepped inside, the receptionist greeted me with a warm smile, and a delicate aroma of essential oils wafted through the air. 

Instantly, it felt as if I had entered another world—one where stress simply melted away.

Minutes later, I was introduced to my masseuse, Nina. She was strikingly beautiful, tall, with an athletic build that suggested she took great care of herself. .

Her long, dark hair fell in soft waves down her back, glistening under the parlor’s gentle lights, accentuating her high cheekbones and delicate jawline.

As she led me to the massage room, her captivating green eyes sparkled with warmth and kindness, instantly putting me at ease. 

The deep tissue massage I’d chosen unfolded like a carefully choreographed symphony.

Every movement of her hands was deliberate, soothing, expertly targeting the knots that had lodged themselves deep in my muscles. The oils she used filled the room, their aroma wrapping around me like a warm embrace, drawing me deeper into relaxation.

The rhythmic, melodic music in the background was almost hypnotic. Time seemed to disappear as my worries dissolved, replaced by a serenity I hadn’t felt in years.

Soon, I became a regular at *Elysium Touch*, visiting at least once a week. Each session felt like a mini escape from reality. I even took advantage of their enticing discount packages, and on my last visit, I received nearly 75% off—a deal that made no business sense to me, but who was I to complain?

However, when I visited Elysium for the fourth time, I had no idea what awaited me that night. 

The management called my number, offering a complimentary massage as a reward for my loyalty, saying I only needed to pay for refreshments. In hindsight, that should have set off alarm bells in my head, but all I could think about was Nina.  
  


Over the weeks, I had begun to feel an unexpected connection with her. 

Nina listened, laughed at my terrible jokes, and even shared snippets of her own life. Nina’s also the curious sort; she likes to learn more about her clients, and I for one am always happy to share. I told her about where I worked, what I did for a living, and that I had no family to speak of and lived alone, not far from here. 

Sometimes, I even seriously considered asking her out on a date so that I could get to know her better. 

But that night, something was off. Really off. 

As the massage began, everything felt familiar at first—her touch, the soothing oils, the gentle music. But this time, the oils had a stronger scent, almost overwhelming. A strange fuzziness started to creep over me. 

I tried to stay awake, to focus, but the effort felt ultimately futile. My grip on consciousness was slipping, and before I knew it, I was being pulled into a deep, inescapable sleep.

When I finally woke up, bright white lights hurt my eyes, and a coldness seeped into my bones. Panic clawed at my throat as I tried to move.

I realized quickly that I was strapped to a cold, metal operating table. 

My heart raced, pounding against my chest like a caged animal. The last thing I remembered was Nina’s touch, her smile. 

Where was she now?

And who were all these people?

I looked around, my pulse quickening as masked figures surrounded me, their faces obscured by surgical masks. A deep, unsettling chill settled in my gut as I tried to comprehend the situation.

 “Ah, you’re awake,” a voice said, smooth and eerily calm.

 It belonged to a man dressed in scrubs—his eyes gleamed with a sadistic glint. “Welcome to my operating table. My name is Dr. Harrow, and I’ll be your surgeon today.” 

My mind raced. “What... what’s happening? Let me go!” I screamed, but my voice sounded weak and distant.

Dr. Harrow picked up a scalpel, holding it delicately between his fingers, letting it glint menacingly under the bright lights. 

“This little tool will help us acquire what we need from you, Alex. Thanks to your sacrifice, you'll save a lot of lives and also help us make a lot of money,” he said, as those gathered around him—also dressed in scrubs—nodded in unison, their eyes fixed on me.

“Do you want to know what we’re going to take from you Alex?” he continued, smiling as he slowly traced the blade over my body—lingering over my kidneys, lungs, heart, throat, and finally resting just above my eyes.

At that moment, the horrifying realization hit me—I had just fallen victim to an organ trafficking ring. 

I recoiled in terror, frantically trying to free myself, but my hands and feet were bound tightly to the table.

“Now, let’s get you ready, shall we?” Dr. Harrow spoke, signaling to one of his assistants, who approached me with a syringe in his hand. 

I recognized it was anesthesia. They were going to put me to sleep again.

 Fear clawed at my insides as I thought of being trapped in this filthy, makeshift underground clinic.

 The reality of what was happening—that my body was about to be sliced apart for its organs—hit me like a sledgehammer. 

My heart pounded in my chest, the weight of my own impending death pressing down on me.

Just as the needle pricked my skin, I heard a loud bang from outside the room.

 The doors of the operating room suddenly flew open, and a group of police officers stormed in.

“Police! Hands in the air!” they shouted, guns drawn. 

Panic swept through the room. Dr. Harrow reacted quickly, yanking my head back and pressing the scalpel to my throat. “Stay back, or I’ll slit his throat!” he yelled, his voice cracking, his eyes wild.

I could barely breathe. The cold edge of the scalpel dug into my neck, and every muscle in my body froze. 

Then, in a flash, a single gunshot rang out. Harrow’s body jerked violently, his head snapping back as blood sprayed across my face. He crumpled on top of me, his dead weight pressing me into the table.

I screamed, choking on panic as gunfire erupted in all directions between the police and the remaining goons. 

The operating table jolted, tipping over, and I crashed to the floor. The impact knocked the wind out of me, and before I could process what was happening, everything went dark.

When I opened my eyes again, I was in a hospital room, a warm blanket draped over me. Officer Reed sat beside my bed, relief softening the lines on his face.

“You’re safe now, Alex,” he said, his voice steady. “We got there just in time. They were about to operate on you, steal your organs.”

I blinked, trying to process the whirlwind of events. “The massage parlor… Nina… was she part of this?”

Reed shook his head. “No, Nina’s an undercover agent. We’ve been investigating Elysium Touch for weeks. They specifically target individuals who live alone and have no close living relatives. It’s a massive organ-smuggling ring. They research their clients, choosing those who fit their profile. That’s how they’ve stayed under the radar for so long. You were almost their next victim.”

His words sank in slowly. “So Nina… she …saved me?” I asked.

“Yes,” he confirmed. “Her undercover work brought us to you just in time.”

The weight of betrayal still settled heavily on my chest even as I learned the truth about Nina.

 “I thought she cared… I thought she was different.” I said finally. 

Reed’s expression suddenly  softened as he let out a deep sigh. “Nina did what she had to in order to maintain her cover. You’re lucky to be alive, Alex. These are dangerous people, constantly moving to avoid detection. They’ve gotten away with it for too long, but this time, we’ll make sure they face justice.”

I spent a few more days in the hospital, my body slowly healing, but my mind remained trapped in that cold, sterile operating room. Nightmares plagued my sleep—visions of Dr. Harrow looming over me, scalpel in hand.

Despite the lingering fear, I forced myself to return to some sense of normalcy, pushing through the unease that clung to me now like a second skin. 

I had been given a second chance, and I wanted to make it count even though it was difficult to find peace in the chaos.

Then, one evening, I saw her—Nina—walking along the sidewalk. For a moment, I hesitated, unsure of what to say. But gratitude pushed me forward.

"Nina," I called out, my voice a little shaky.

She turned, her eyes meeting mine. "Thank you, for saving my life" I said.

She gave a small nod, her face softening just slightly.

After a beat, I blurted out, "Would you… maybe want to grab coffee sometime?"

She paused, considering, then nodded. "Sure," she replied, her voice calm but sincere.

A brief, tentative smile passed between us, and for the first time, I felt a flicker of hope. 

Maybe this was the beginning of healing. Maybe, despite everything, I could find a way to move forward with a happy ending, no pun intended.
