My name’s Sparky. I’m twenty-one, and I go to a trade school for hair styling. I don’t know why that matters, except that everything in my life used to be normal—scissors, dryers, the smell of singed hairspray. I liked things I could control. Then the geese started acting weird.

It was at this house party near campus. Everyone was out back, music thumping, lights flashing through the fog of vape smoke. I told a few friends how the geese by the pond had gotten too chill lately. They used to hiss if you looked at them wrong, but now they just stood around, watching. You could walk straight through a flock and they wouldn’t budge.
“They’re domesticated,” someone said.
“Nah,” another laughed, “they’re just used to you.”
“Maybe they’re waiting for something,” I joked.

Everyone laughed, but when I said it, I swear one goose looked straight at me—like it knew my name. There was this tiny flicker in its eye, a little orange spark that wasn’t from the porch lights or anyone’s phone. It looked like a lighter catching for a second before the flame. People call me Sparky because I once set off the fire alarm during color-theory class, but the way that goose looked at me, it felt like it had known that name before I ever said it. The spark blinked out, and then every goose in the flock turned toward me in unison.

The next morning, I woke up on my roommate’s couch to an infomercial running on the TV. The volume was low, but the voice was unmistakable—too loud, too confident.
“Sparky’s Great Adventure!” the announcer boomed. My name.
On the screen was a huge guy, shirtless, veins standing out across his arms, wearing a referee whistle. He grinned at the camera and pointed straight ahead.
“Run faster, Sparky! Or I’ll catch you!”
Then the screen flickered and went dark except for a green heart logo pulsing in time with my heartbeat.
Sign up for the Healthy Doce.
Where motivation meets survival.

I thought it was a prank, but when I checked my phone, a new app was already installed—same green heart, same name. It even said, Welcome, Sparky! Training begins tonight. I don’t remember downloading it. I should’ve deleted it right then, but I guess curiosity beat fear. I told myself it was a viral marketing thing.

That night, the app assigned me my first “trainer.” It called him Motivator A. Theme: Fire. I laughed—kind of poetic, right? Me, Sparky. Fire. I started jogging around the track, just to see what it would do. About a mile in, I smelled smoke. I figured someone was grilling nearby, until I saw the orange glow rising from behind the bleachers. The whole field lit up like a bonfire. A figure stepped out of the flames wearing a horned wrestling mask, carrying a branding iron that glowed white at the tip. I ran harder than I’ve ever run in my life. The phone buzzed in my pocket.
“Fear Index: 91%. Calories burned: 304. Excellent work!”
When I stopped, the fire was gone. The field was dark again. I deleted the app. Or thought I did.

The next morning it was back. Same icon, same cheerfully sinister tone. That night, it gave me a new trainer. The Watcher. Theme: Stillness. The goal was to maintain a constant pace—if I slowed down, he’d “intervene.” It sent me to the riverside park, which is usually well lit and busy. Halfway through, I tripped on a root. My phone vibrated and said, “Resume running, or your trainer will intervene.” Then every streetlight in the park blinked out at once. Under the bridge, I saw someone standing perfectly still. They wore an old-fashioned gym uniform and a whistle. The whistle blew once. I turned. It blew again, closer. The third time, it came from right behind me.

I didn’t run the next day. I couldn’t. I told myself it was all some elaborate ARG, that maybe the school’s marketing students were filming reactions. But that night, I woke up to the sound of someone breathing right outside my door. Slow, heavy, steady. Then footsteps circled my bed. The phone on my nightstand lit up by itself, green heart pulsing. A voice came from it—too calm, too close.
“Inactive runners are sweetened differently.”

When I turned on the lamp, no one was there, but muddy footprints led from the foot of my bed to the window. The latch was flipped—backward, like someone had opened it from the outside and then… reversed it somehow.

In the morning, the app showed a new data log.
“Sleep event detected. Heart rate: 177. Scream duration: 9 seconds. Reward unlocked: VIP Trainer Access.”
My hand was shaking so hard I almost dropped the phone. Another message appeared:
“You’re doing great, Sparky. The Big Day is coming.”

I factory-reset my phone. The app reinstalled itself before setup finished. Now my watch buzzes in rhythm with my heartbeat, whispering numbers I can’t quite make out. Countdown, maybe. Every day on campus, I see more people jogging with that same green heart logo glowing faintly on their shirts, eyes blank, faces slack, calm as geese.

Sometimes I catch a glimpse of their reflection in a window and see a flicker—a tiny orange spark, just like the one in the goose’s eye that night. Maybe that’s what the “Doce” really is. Sweet fear, measured in heartbeats and firelight.

The app says the Big Day is soon. I don’t know what happens then. Some online forums say it’s a livestreamed marathon. Others say the race never ends. All I know is, the runners who stop don’t come back. They just start showing up again later, watching. Still. Quiet. Patient.

If you ever see an ad with your name on it, don’t click it. If it says Healthy Doce, don’t download it.
And if you hear a whistle behind you while you run… don’t look back.
They only brand the ones who look back.
