 

On the evening of February 4 2023, I responded to a call for trespassing at an abandoned home on Huntington Boulevard. I arrived on scene at 10:04 p.m.

There was a group of about a dozen neighbors standing across the street. Two adult males were holding baseball bats, while another was holding a large kitchen knife. They were all staring at the house. A middle aged Hispanic male motioned me over to the crowd. He identified himself as Arnie Jimenez and told me that he was the one who made the call. He pointed to something in the fence.

There was a dog lodged between the steel bars of the fence surrounding the house. It appeared to be a white and black mixed Pitbull, and it wasn’t moving.

Mr. Jiminez spoke to me while everyone else just nodded along to everything he was saying. Distress was evident on all of their faces.

Mr. Jiminez informed me that he had seen a young white male enter the property with his dog. He also said that the home has been vacant for over five years, and there is a frequent presence of trespassers when the weather is cold.

I asked him if he observed any weapons on the individual who was trespassing. He told me that none were observed.

He said that an hour prior, roughly ten minutes after the trespasser entered the home, screams were heard from the property. Several of the neighbors walked outside and said they also heard the screams and the frantic barking of the dog. A short amount of time later, they observed the dog running from the front door and unable to find a way out of the front yard, the dog tried to push itself through the bars of the fence.

Mr. Jiminez said that several of the neighbors wanted to help the dog, but everyone was too afraid to get too close to the house.

When I asked him if that was because of the screams, he looked at the group of neighbors before he answered, “We all stay away from that house. There are always other types of noises coming from that house at night.”

Mr. Jiminez did not elaborate on the other noises that have been heard. I informed the crowd to stay back and I walked up to the home.

It was a two story craftsman style home in an advanced state of disrepair. Paint was flaking along the siding and some of the fascia boards were missing. Two dormer windows of the second floor were on the roof. Four brick pillars were in front of the porch. All of the windows in the home appeared to have a green film on the inside, and I noted several windows had odd designs traced through the grime. One of them had two eyes and a frown.

The metal fence was black and highly oxidized. It was around six feet in height and each bar had a point on the top. The fence stretched along the front of the home and terminated at either side. There was a rusted “For Sale” sign affixed to the fence just right of the middle gate. 

The entire lot around the home and within the fence was overgrown. A large oak hung over the front of the home. I observed a tire swing hanging from one of its branches. The concrete approach of the home was cracked, and debris and trash were observed throughout the front yard. 

The dog had not moved during my approach and as I got closer, I could see that there was dried blood caked around its muzzle. A pool of drying mucus was on the sidewalk under its open mouth. The upper body was hanging a few  inches off of the ground.

I  turned on my flashlight and inspected the dog. There were numerous small white scratches on the surface of the cement behind the dog. It appeared that it had used its legs to frantically push forward, crushing itself to get through only to be stuck at the hips.

I knelt down. The dog’s upper body was lumpy and bruised. It looked as if most of the ribs were broken, and the odd angle of its upper body in proportion to its lower body suggested that it had broken its own back trying to escape.

I moved my light back to the house and saw that the front door was slightly ajar. There were no lights on inside. There was an off putting odor coming from inside the home. A sweet and sour smell that I could only describe as rotten cheese and hot chocolate.

It was at this point that I heard something coming from the home. I could hear creaking floorboards and a loud snapping sound reminiscent of someone popping their knuckles.

The dog was lodged in the gate of the fence, so after I opened the latch, I swung it inward gently. It was at this time that I realized that the dog was not dead. It began to howl wildly as it was moved.

I leaned down and instinctively tried to spread the bars apart in order to free it, but after a moment of struggle,  it gave one more gasp and lowered its head. The wailing had echoed through the street and when it was over, I noticed that the sounds that were coming from inside of the home ceased.

Behind the grime of one of the windows upstairs, I saw what appeared to be the face of a young white male. I announced my presence and ordered him to exit the home. The face then pulled away from the window.

I proceeded through the gate, along the approach, and up the porch. I pulled my sidearm and activated my bodycam, which I had hoped would corroborate the rest of my report. I entered the home.

The smell was overpowering inside. Unlike the outside of the home, there appeared to be no sign of any kind of trash or vandalism. Only neglect. There were however several broken mirrors that were hung on several walls.

The floors were hardwood and I observed numerous scratches and gouges deep within the surface. Mold seemed to be growing at a rapid rate along the walls, and I took note that the interior of the home was very warm and moist in spite of the time of year.

I called for backup before continuing on through the house. I then made my way to the stairs and I felt something pop under my shoe.

There was a broken fingernail under my foot, and upon inspection of the floor, I found numerous teeth that had been removed at the roots and several other fragments scattered about which appeared to be bone-like.

It was at this time that I turned and started to exit the home. I was terrified and I doubted that I could perform my job. That is when I heard a voice coming from upstairs.

“Help me.” The volume was very low and the voice was raspy. The words repeated themselves over and over again without ceasing.

I admit now that I should have waited for back up before continuing up the stairs, but I could not turn my back on someone asking for help. I should have.

Something upstairs crashed against the floor, and directly afterward, I heard the sound of heavy footfalls running from one end of the house to the other. I slowly climbed the stairs with my sidearm held in front of me. My hands were shaking.

At the top of the stairs, There was a small hallway and four doorways. Standing in one of the doorways to the rear of the home was the young male I had observed through the window. The air was thick with the smell of sweet rot.

I ordered the man to the ground, but the only response was the repeated call for help. I took two steps toward the individual and squared myself to him.

He was moving his right arm back and forth, as if he was motioning me to come closer.

“Help me.” 

It was at this time that I noticed his eyes. They were pointed upward toward the ceiling. The young man's mouth was moving up and down as he spoke, but his lips did not appear to be forming any words. Rather it looked as if he was being controlled by a sloppy ventriloquist. Blood was observed around the corners of his mouth which furthered the comparison in my mind.

I looked down to his feet and they were hovering slightly off of the ground. It was at that moment that I realized that I was looking at a body being held by someone standing behind it. The person was moving the young man's arm back and forth. The voice was coming from behind the young man.

There was a slight reflection from my light coming from inside of the room behind the body of the young man, and I shifted slightly to my left. There was another broken mirror on the wall inside of the room. I could see the individual in the reflection.

The perpetrator was tall and naked, and looked to be of a stocky build. The flesh was gray, and I observed strange protrusions of bones all along the back and the anterior of the head. There were several markings in the flesh that looked more like tribal scarring than tattoos. The knees seemed to be jointed inward like an animal. The feet were wide and the toes were splayed out on either side of the foot so I could see a few of them. They looked like fingers. 

With their right hand they were moving the boy's arm back and forth, and to my horror, the back of the young man’s head appeared to have been hollowed out. The perpetrator had their left hand jammed inside of the back of the young man’s head, and I believe that is how they were moving the boy's mouth up and down. From the inside. 

I ordered the perpetrator to drop the body and back away. Instead, the body was flung toward me with a tremendous force. I stepped to my side and opened fire four times with my sidearm. The perpetrator slammed the door closed.

At that moment, for less than a second, I saw its face. It was either a mask, or what I saw was not human. I decided that I would move no further, and instead wait for backup. I called in again and yelled for back up. 

The perpetrator began to quietly laugh behind the closed door. I stood there for approximately ten seconds with my gun aimed and my eyes on the doorknob. It finally began to move. 

I then heard sirens in the distance. I believe the perpetrator heard them as well. The kob stopped moving, and then I heard the breaking of glass from the inside of the room.

Approximately three minutes later, I entered the room along with two other officers.

The perpetrator had broken the window and fled into the night.

The room was littered with dozens of human remains in various states of decay. The perpetrator had apparently been feeding off of other trespassers for weeks or possibly even months. There was a pallet of dirty blankets and trash in the corner where the perpetrator had apparently been sleeping for some time.

The appearance of the perpetrator on the bodycam footage was indistinguishable due to the light flares in the mirror. I’m sure any further description that I would give would only sound more ludicrous. The investigation is ongoing, but so far it appears that the remains of thirty three individuals have been found in the upper bedroom
 The perpetrator has yet to be found.
