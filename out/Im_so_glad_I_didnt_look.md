I was only a little girl, around the age of 5, it haunts my dreams. This is a true story, though I wish it wasn't... 

Around the time of my 6th birthday, a few days before, I had been begging my parents to let me have a sleep over with a couple of my close friends. They finally gave in and let me invite my two best friends round, thought they hated each other they sucked it up and both came round. I was the most excited I had ever been in my life; like an average American woman realizing the Pumpkin Spice is out in Starbucks. Jokes aside I was very happy about this, we had brought a wide variety of sweets, I remember we had Skittles, Popcorn and a large bottle of Diet Coke ( It was my mums but she let us take it ). 

We decided to watch a few movies, just kid stuff until I remember a movie I had seen my mum watching a few weeks before, of course I was curious. She had ushered me out before I'd seen any ' Scary ' parts but I remembered the movie name, it was Scream. By the way this movie isn't the thing that scared me.. 

We found the movie disk, it wasn't very well hidden, and we started watching it. We were giggling, until we say the gruesome parts, then we just sat and watched in fear. We didn't turn it off because none of us wanted to admit out fear.. I'm so glad this was the case.. 

Midmovie, I heard a sound outside of my window, a tapping like sound. My friends didn't seem to hear  it but I was petrified. I told one of them but they looked at me in the eyes and shushed me.. at the time  I thought this was because she couldn't hear the movie. I'm still friends with her and she told me it was because through the curtain she could see a face staring at us, she didn't want whatever it was to know we'd noticed it. 

We had the lights off, this was because we wear not supposed to be up so late; this was even luckier.. 

I heard a shuffle from outside, I obviously hadn't been paying attention to the movie because I went to investigate. My friend pulled me back, she whispered to me, " Just watch the movie and ignore it. " She sounded so serious so I listened to her. 

We went to sleep around 4, when the movie ended. The next morning my mum rushed in to us, there had been 3 kidnappings in my neighbourhood of other children around my age. They had their windows open.. it was the middle of summer. I had locked mine, only because we were watching a scary movie. I know it isn't definite that this was the kidnapper, maybe it was just a tree tapping on the window.. maybe my friend remembered it wrong.. but still, freaky.
