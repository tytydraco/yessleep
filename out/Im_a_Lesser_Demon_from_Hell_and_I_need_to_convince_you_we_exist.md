This post is sure to attract skepticism, but as per the title, I am a Demon. Not at all high ranking, but a Demon nonetheless.

I need to reach mortals, as many as possible. I've studied your forums, and I've determined this subreddit to be a suitable medium to convey my message, as I expect these words to be read by a sufficient number of mortal eyes. Why do I wish to reach *you*, the reader? I'll get to that.

Already you're rolling your eyes, aren't you? Demons don't exist. What a load of shit.

It's true that Demons nowadays are thought of as fictional entities reserved to superstition and lore. Although I fully expect skepticism, members of this sub usually highly rate well articulated content at the interplay of fact and fiction. Ironically, thats exactly *where* us demons exist. We exist *between* these concepts. In a way, we are fiction, but we are ALSO real.

Lets get my motive out of the way; I have a plan to become human, and as a reader, you're now a part of it. Now I hear you - why would I want to become as ignorant, helpless and finite as a human being? Thats my business. If you're lucky, perhaps you'll find out one day when I become one, from my own mortal lips.

If i'm not human yet, how am I typing this, I hear you ask. I've done my homework, that's how. These words are manifesting from Hell itself through the mind and hands of a human scribe which I've injected my will into using  techniques usually reserved for higher ranking Demons for the purposes of bringing this message into the physical realm. Each sentence brings me closer to my goal. I'm doing this for myself, but consider it a consolation prize that you get to learn the truth of existence.

Now as Demons, we can only reach your kind through your minds, that's how we influence you. But you'll hear neither voice nor notice a slither of any presence. The connection to you is so subtle that not even a strand of association with us can be ascertained by the physical realm. Ergo, you'll feel as though its all coming from you. The art of suggestion from a demon imparted onto a human is so profoundly nuanced that a rational man would be insane to believe it was real. This is how we oppose the forces of good, and instill the temptation to sin into your mind. Your mind is not just in your brain, oh no, your brain is a radio receiver for the true reality, and we exist within the 'frequencies', so to speak. But unlike a radio that tunes into frequencies, we instead tune into you.

It all still sounds ridiculous, doesn't it, mortals? You've heard this all before, superstitious nonsense, is it not?

Let me explain further.

May I begin with a philosophical question; what is reality at all if it can't be proven? Would it be anything at all? Is unprovable reality a paradox? Is unprovability itself an antonym of reality, or are they one of the same? What's that colourful phrase you use; "Does a bear shit in the woods?"

I'm here to tell you that most of reality is unprovable, because most of reality isn't physical, and doesn't 'exist' in the sense that you do.

As mortals, by your 21st century rationalist worldview, you judge the applicability of unverified information only worthy of adding to your knowledge base if you believe it could plausibly be apprehended and verified by the eyes, ears, taste buds, skin and nostrils of other humans. This is why science has become such a popular truth medium in your world. What else would you anchor yourselves to if not the physical laws which your form obeys? It's perfectly understandable. But unlike you, Demons are not confined to matter, and so science, and your worldview as a whole, means nothing in our 'dimension'.

Imagine this for a moment; do objects exist moment to moment outside your peripheral vision? When you turn to look behind you, it's there, but was it there before you did? Yes, I hear you say, but might I point out, that's an assumption. Now I could work my way through the senses by example one by one, but my main point to put forward is that beyond your senses, you assume the existence of all other things beyond your ordinary perception. 

An example, if I may; imagine a friend to whom you haven't spoken since, let's say, two days ago. You assume they still exist outside of your perception based on your model of how existence works, you are unable to verify the reality of this fact at each discrete moment, but you assume that they continue to exist beyond your own observation. 

Now I'm sure you can even imagine what they're likely to be doing at any given moment, but during every moment they remain unperceived by you, they exist in an unverified form in your mind, constructed from a model informed by the assumption that what's real doesn't require your observation to exist.

Read that last sentence again. 

Allow me to echo that; *What's real doesnt require your observation to exist.*

Let me put it in a way your mortal brains can understand; space, time, matter, that stuff that makes you tick? As you know, that all began during what you call the 'Big Bang' some 14 billion years ago. We call it something different, but as Demons, we rarely speak of it. 

Before these physical parameters existed (the Demonic consensus is that the creation of your 'universe' was wholly unnecessary and abhorrent) there was only we - the truly real- only we existed. Of course, there are other things that are as real as Demons, too. Nothing outside the universe, which for arguments sake we'll say that's where we are, would make any sense to a mortal brain to any capacity whatsoever. It therefore would be better thought of as *nonsense*. No gravity, no laws of motion, no physical constants. A monkey with a typewriter would describe it no better in an infinite timeframe. It truly makes no sense to anything physical.

So let's recap what we've learned so far; before physical reality there was no time, no space, no matter, no *sense*. So we've established NONSENSE is older than SENSE. And we've established demons and their communication methods make NO SENSE to a rational human. We've also discussed that reality exists outside the subjective experience, and outside the verifiable experience. 

What's king in the realm of what you'd call nonsense, the true reality? I'll tell you- it's morality. Morality is king. Good "or' bad. Knowledge of Morality is what brings your kind most in tune with the true reality. The true reality anchors itself to morality. Morality is an energy source of sorts. I can't explain more than that. As Demons, we walk in the gaps of your mind, powered by these concepts. Because we are weaved from morality, we can interact with your subconscious. At all times of course, you retain free will to accept or reject our suggestions.

I'm trying my best to put it in words that will make sense to your fickle concept of reality.

If I've made you question what's real, even slightly, I've achieved my objectives. I only need one of you readers to believe I exist, as per the long forgotten clause of demonic law - for me to manifest into physical reality.

The human typing this has agreed to swap places with me, demon form for human form. I chose this one because he has an intense fascination with demons, just as I have an intense fascination with humans. 

All thats left is for you to say my name in your mind while believing there's even a hair of a chance that I exist. 

I will become human any moment, I can feel it.

I am the first human demon, and my name is 

KALAILUS
