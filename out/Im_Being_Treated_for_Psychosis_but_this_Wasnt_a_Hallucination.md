I’ve been in therapy for almost a year now.

That’s important. Not as an excuse, if anything, it’s the reason I’m writing this at all. I’ve learned the language for my condition. I know how my mind lies to me. I know what a delusion feels like when it starts to bloom: the pressure behind the eyes, the sense that meaning is hiding in ordinary things.

That night, none of that happened.

My therapist calls it *psychotic features with stress triggers*. We’ve worked on grounding. 

Naming objects. Counting breaths. Pressing my feet into the pavement and reminding myself where I am. 

It’s been working. I haven’t had an episode in months.

So when I went out for a walk just after midnight, I wasn’t worried. I do that sometimes when my apartment feels too quiet. The streets were mostly empty, just the orange wash of streetlights, the low hum of traffic a few blocks away.

I was halfway down the block when I noticed someone standing near the corner of an office building.

He was just outside the reach of the streetlight, where the brightness falls apart into shadow. At first glance, he looked ordinary enough, hood up, hands hanging at his sides. He wasn’t moving, but that didn’t alarm me. 

People pause. People wait.

I remember thinking he looked tired.

As I got closer, something felt… delayed. Not wrong, exactly. Just slightly out of sync. His posture didn’t adjust as I approached. Most people shift their weight, glance up, acknowledge another presence. 

He didn’t.

I stopped walking.

That’s when I started grounding without even meaning to. 

*Streetlight. Sidewalk. Parked car.* 

My heart rate was steady. No auditory distortion. No pressure behind the eyes.

The man swayed.

Not like someone losing balance. More like something nudged him and then stopped.

A car passed behind me, headlights flaring across the building. His shadow stretched along the wall and then kept going. It climbed upward, thinning as it rose, branching in places shadows don’t branch.

I told myself shadows do strange things at night.

Then the man’s head turned toward me.

It was too slow. Like the instruction reached him late.

“Hey,” he said.

The voice was flat. Not threatening. Almost rehearsed. His mouth moved, but his shoulders never rose with breath. I couldn’t see his eyes beneath the hood, and that’s when I realized his feet hadn’t moved at all.

“What’s the time?” the man asked, though the sound didn’t seem to come from him, but from somewhere just above him.

As I crept slowly forward, all rational thought went away as I noticed something shifted above him.

Not webbing. That’s what everyone imagines, but it wasn’t that delicate. It was thick, cordlike, disappearing into the darkness above the streetlight. As my eyes followed it upward, another shape unfolded.

It was tall. Large. 

Impossibly so. Its limbs bent in too many places, but what froze me wasn’t the size, it was the face. Human enough to recognize, but wrong enough to reject. Eyes like a spider were set too close. A mouth that split open like an insect moved silently, opening and closing as if practicing the word it had just used.

*Is something the matter?*

The man lurched toward me then, his arms jerking as if pulled. I didn’t wait to understand more. 

I ran.

I don’t remember unlocking my apartment door. I remember slamming it shut, throwing every lock, standing there with my back against it while my breathing stayed frustratingly normal.

That’s what terrifies me most.

I wasn’t panicking. I was lucid.

From my living room, I could hear something above the ceiling. Not footsteps, lighter than that. A careful tapping, moving slowly across the space, testing.

It stopped after a while.

I’m writing this now because it’s almost morning, and soon my brain will try to protect me. It will tell me I imagined the cords, the delay, the way the shadow climbed the wall. It will point to my diagnosis and ask me to be reasonable.

But I checked my therapy journal from last month. An entry I barely remembered writing.

*Sometimes people don’t stand on the ground the way they should. Like they’re hanging wrong.*

I know what I saw.

So if you ever see a hooded man who moves on a delay...

Run as far away as you can...

Don’t let it follow you.

Don’t let it learn where you live.
