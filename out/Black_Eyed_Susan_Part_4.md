My job that night was to distract her. To make her laugh, and forget the earlier madness. One of the perks of that job was distracting myself too. We went on a walk down the main street, reminiscing about the shit we (I) got into. We checked out some of the old shops, and some of the new ones.

 

It was difficult for her to lift her spirits with how dreary everything looked under the grey veil and misty haze of the clouds and fog. I tried my best, but I was feeling strange too. It felt eerie here. There was a looming dread, a sense of unease and decay.

 

The people all looked normal enough, but sometimes I felt like there were eyes on me. I was used to that to an extent. Growing up here and looking like… well… me, invites some crude and judgmental glances. But this felt different somehow. The last time I felt like this was that night at the bog. I tried my best to shake it off.

 

The more I looked at the people, the more I noticed things were off. People looked haggard and a bit confused. A man stood in the doorway to a store with his hand on the handle, but wouldn’t open it. He just stared into the glass. Another man I saw walking up and down the same street four times. I saw a man just… spitting, over and over in the same spot on the sidewalk. Another was whispering to himself, though I couldn’t hear what.

 

I noticed some similar behavior when we first got here but I dismissed it. People act weird sometimes, it’s common… but it’s not this common. Something about this whole place was wrong. I could see it, and I think Em could too – despite how preoccupied her mind was.

 

We turned in at the motel. Familiarly laying on our backs on opposite ends of the bed, staring up at the dark ceiling.

 

“Do you think any of it was real? Any of what my dad said?” Em asked.

 

“I think… I think I believe that confession happened. It just seemed too detailed to be completely made up. I think he really did meet the guy.”

 

“What about what he said. The experiments…”

 

Just hearing that word again made me shudder. “Em, do you really want to talk about this?”

 

“I can’t stop thinking about it… I feel like I have to.”

 

I understood what she meant. It never left my mind either.

 

“I don’t know… It does line up with how the victims were found, I guess.”

 

“It’s the most awful thing I’ve ever heard… Those girls… I can’t even imagine.”

 

“I know. But it’s over now. It’s long gone.”

 

“But dad said it’s still going. Maybe it is. People are still going missing. Maybe there’s a copycat or he had a partner. If Heather got taken by them… I just…”

 

“Em… I know it’s hard, but you have to let this go. There’s nothing we can do. There’s nothing we ever could have done. Thinking like this… It’s only gonna hurt you.”

 

“I’m sorry… I’m sorry Lie. I’m a wreck.” Em laid there, not speaking for a while. I could hear her holding back tears.

 

“Promise me something?” Em asked softly.

 

“What?”

 

“After we get back from this trip… No more eight years apart. We have to make it work. I’ll come see you, and you’ll come see me, as much as possible.”

 

“Yeah, Em. I promise.”

 

“It should have always been that way. I hate that it all got away from us like this. All that time lost. So many things I wish I got to share with you. I regret so much.”

 

“I hate it too but… We were growing up. We were creating lives for ourselves.”

 

“I know but… You’re my rock. You’re my best friend. You always have been. I don’t want a life without you in it.” Em said, her voice full of a warmth and sincerity that I hadn’t heard from anyone in so long.

 

It was a good thing the lights were off, because I was beginning to cry. Em still knew how to get me. A part of me really didn’t think she still cared all that much about us, or our friendship. I think I tried not to care about it for a long time, so that I wouldn’t be the only one caring.

 

I couldn’t find the words to say, so instead I just reached my hand out towards her’s and softly held it. I think we both needed it.

 

I fell asleep. Still deeply unsettled, but ready to put this all behind us tomorrow. I expected to wake up softly to the morning sun shining in through the blinds, but instead I awoke in the dark, being shaken by Em.

 

“Lie! Wake Up!” Em said in a frantic whisper.

 

“What… What’s happening?” I croaked.

 

“It’s Heather!”

 

Those words pierced my slumber and I shot awake. “What!? What do you mean?”

 

“I saw her! It was Heather! She’s outside! Look! Look!”

 

Em dragged me out of bed and I stumbled to the window. She pulled open the blinds for me. I stared out into the dark blue haze of the motel parking lot. It was hard to make out much past the fog. It looked so much denser at night. I definitely couldn’t see a person.

 

“I don’t… I don’t see anyone.”

 

“What? No. She was right there!” Em looked outside, then darted past me and opened the door.

 

“Em, wait!” I couldn’t get the words out before she was gone. I rushed outside to follow her.

 

She stood in the middle of the parking lot, looking around in all directions. I staggered towards her. My body was still half asleep.

 

“Em, just calm down. Come back inside. There’s no way you saw-“

 

“There! Come on!” Em pointed behind me and then sprinted past me. By the time I turned my body to where she was running, whatever it was that she saw was gone. She ran out past the motel and turned the corner. I woke my legs up and ran as fast as I could after her.

 

“Heather!” I heard her shout, echoing in the distance. I turned the corner but I couldn’t see anything. The fog was too thick. Behind the motel was a small field that led to a sparse forest. I couldn’t see anything in the field, so I sprinted into the forest.

 

“Em!” I picked a direction and ran, shouting her name over and over. The fog only got thicker. I wanted to keep running, I would have run forever, but I didn’t even know if I was going in the right direction.

 

I stopped and listened for any sign of movement, any footsteps, but I heard nothing. Just the quiet wail of the wind and the rustling of the trees. It was like she just disappeared.

 

I spent the next two hours lost in the fog, out in the woods behind this motel, screaming and crying. Begging for Em to come back. She never did. I knew someone got her. In that moment, all of this Black Eyed Susan nonsense became real. I didn’t know how, or to what extent, but he was back. He got Em. She was gone.

 

I found my way back to the motel. My entire body was shaking, it felt like my guts were in a blender, I was in complete hysterics. I couldn’t believe it. I refused. Em couldn’t be gone. I just got her back. I made those promises. We were never going to be apart again. We could’ve been…

 

I couldn’t protect either one of my best friends. My body wanted to shut down. I wanted to curl into a ball and die. But… this wasn’t over.

 

If what the old man said was true, if what all the legends I heard through the years were true, he wouldn’t have killed her. That’s not what he does. If I can find her, I can save her. At least that’s what I was hoping. So I had to be strong and I had to think. Only one place came to mind. The bog.

 

She had to be there. It all added up. I didn’t waste another second, I got in Em’s car and I drove. If any of this was true… Even one word of it… Then I needed three things before I went into the bog. I couldn’t go in there unarmed. I needed something to shoot, I needed something to cut, and I needed something to burn. Stores were closed, but I knew everything I needed would be at Mr. Knowby’s place. I had broken in there many times before as a kid, I knew how to do it.

 

My hands wouldn’t stop shaking on the steering wheel. I couldn’t take a single steady breath to save my life. My body was in a constant battle between adrenaline and exhaustion. The town was quiet – deathly quiet. I suppose it made sense, only an idiot would be driving in the middle of the night in this kind of fog.

 

I made it to Mr. Knowby’s, parking a little ways down the street to be safe. I quickly made my way around the back of the house. Em’s window was on the upper floor overlooking the back yard, and the lock was busted. I doubted they got it fixed since we kept it a secret.

 

It was easy enough to climb up, especially with all the adrenaline I was feeling. Sure enough, the window slid open and the screen popped out easily. I hoisted myself inside, as carefully as possible. It wasn’t Em’s room anymore, now it was just a junk room. That made it a little harder to maneuver without making a sound, but I managed.

 

First stop was the bathroom. I grabbed a can of aerosol deodorant. Fortunately, I already brought a lighter. Then I snuck down the stairs. The stairs were always awful. They creaked like hell. I remembered that if you stick to the far side as you walk down, they wouldn’t creak as much. Em and I snuck out a lot.

 

He had a hunting rifle above the mantle, and a chainsaw in the garage. It was easy enough to grab the rifle and get the ammo sitting underneath it. The chainsaw took a bit of looking since the garage was pitch black, but I managed.

 

All I had to do was go back inside and then escape through the front, but when I stepped through the door… Mr. Knowby was standing right there in the living room, blocking my way. All I could see was his silhouette and it petrified me. He didn’t move.

 

“Mr. Knowby… I’m sorry, but it’s Em…”

 

“He sees you.” Mr. Knowby spoke shakily. He sounded like he was sleepwalking.

 

“She’s in danger. Please, I have to go.” I responded, trying not to sound terrified.

 

“She’ll be okay. He’ll make her see. Then you’ll see too.”

 

His eyes were closed. I could see that he was in no state to attack me, or to do anything really. I cautiously walked past him. I didn’t have time to deal with a crazy old man. I opened the front door and took a step outside, but then he said more.

 

“He made Heather see.”

 

I turned around. He was facing me. His eyes were still closed but he was smiling now.

 

“She was good. She was special. She was so strong. He found great use for her.”

 

I wanted to break down, but I turned back and kept walking towards the car at a brisk pace. He continued to talk.

 

“He’ll find use for you too. You’re all his little flowers now. The whores, the heathens, the sinners, and the blasphemers can now be purified. We can all be purified! We will all be accepted into his kingdom! For Black Eyed Susan! The Wilted One is God and he will be our salvation!”

 

I got in the car and sped off immediately. As I pealed off down the street, I saw figures standing in the windows of the neighboring houses. Staring at me. Unmoving. A few stood on the sidewalks. The fog was so thick now. This was no longer the town I grew up in. Something dark and depraved had sept in and poisoned it. It was unrecognizable. I had to get to Em, and I had to get us both the hell out of here. Willow Bay was gone.
