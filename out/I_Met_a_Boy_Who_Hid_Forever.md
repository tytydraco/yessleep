I was 22 and had graduated with a bachelor’s degree in English six months ago. I always imagined that as soon as I graduated I’d be publishing books or running some avant-garde lit mag, but I was having a hard time finding my first “real” job. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was running out of time to do something great. 

I’d been working as a volunteer slush reader for *Dark Dreams Review,* but I quit after a month when it became clear that the journal wasn’t going anywhere: nothing they published was new or special.

With no job or responsibilities, I started going for long walks around my neighborhood, daydreaming about all the ways I could reinvent myself: move to Hollywood and live out of my car while working on my screenplays, sell all my possessions and travel the country in a van.

It was during one of these walks that I saw the man. We were on Bernard Street and walking toward each other. The middle of winter, and yet, he wore a t-shirt and shorts. When he walked past me I felt a surge of heat and fetid air, like an oven full of plastic had just opened. I turned around in time to see him crossing the street.

An SUV ran a stop sign as the man walked out in front of it. I screamed and threw my hands in the air, but the car passed right through him.

The car moved steadily ahead, and the man continued walking. It was only then, staring at him with my mouth agape, that I realized: the man was somewhat opaque, not obviously so, but enough that I could look through him and vaguely make out dark shadows.

I watched the ghost until he turned the corner, then I followed. I rounded the bend in time to see him walking toward an abandoned house on the right. He entered the front yard and disappeared.

I was stuck in place and breathing hard when a voice came from behind me.

“You can see him too, can’t you?”

I turned around to see a tall, handsome man about my age, with curly blond hair and brown eyes. He looked down at me and smiled like I’d done something surprisingly cute. A kid who solved a math problem she hadn’t been taught in school.

“Yes,” I said. “Who is he?”

“Your guess is as good as mine. You followed him, right?”

I nodded.

“He’s always walking the same path, but he disappears right here. I think it’s where he used to live.”

“What makes you think that?”

“Where else would you spend your afterlife trying to reach?” He shrugged. “My name’s Charles. You want to get a cup of coffee?”

I laughed, and he flinched as if I’d hit him. “I’ll take that as a no?” he asked.

“Yes!” I said, too sharply. “I mean, no. You shouldn’t take it as a no. My name’s Sarah. Let’s get a cup of coffee and… you can tell me more about the ghost?”

“I don’t know anything else. But I can tell you more about me.”

I’m not sure if I said yes because I liked his smile, or because I didn’t want to give up the adventure. 

We spent the 10-minute walk to Collective Coffee making awkward small talk about our lives and hobbies. He was an accountant who spent his free time hiking and rock climbing. He was delighted to know that I was an English major, but when he asked me about a few old books he seemed somewhat disappointed that I didn’t recognize them.

Collective Coffee was a cute little spot I’d never been to before. The walls were covered with black and white portraits of couples and families, and next to the menu above the counter there was a blown-up image of a newspaper article touting the shop as winner of the city’s 1984 “best cup of coffee” competition. The place was empty aside from an old man and woman sitting in the far corner by the bathroom and a barista with pink hair who stood at the counter and greeted us as we approached.

I smiled at her and looked up to study the menu. I was thinking about either a latte or a cappuccino, but then Charles was already ordering his Americano. \\\\\\\*Rude,\\\\\\\* I thought.

“And she’ll have… a chai tea latte?” He finished.

“Uh, sure.”

The girl gave me a sympathetic look, then went to make our drinks.

A few minutes later we were sitting down at a round table in the front.

“So, how often do you see ghosts?” Charles asked.

“Not often,” I didn’t want him to know that this was the first time.

“I’ve been seeing them since I was little,” he said, looking down at his drink.

Charles' childhood home was just on the other end of Bernard Street. He often stopped by because, sometimes, he could see his mother’s ghost through the kitchen window. He’d seen the ghost I’d been watching a few times over the years but had just happened to be walking back from visiting his mom that day.

“So… what happened to your mom?”

“She died.”

“Oh… yeah. Um, do you see ghosts every day?”

“Only when I’ve been out mushroom hunting.”

“Mushroom hunting?”

“Yeah. I like to search around trails and forests for rare mushrooms. Sometimes I eat the edible ones.”

It took me a second to get it. He looked worried until I started laughing.

I made some excuse about my parents needing my help at home. Before I could leave he said, “let’s get dinner… Tuesday night?”

When I took a moment to reply he said, “We can talk about… whatever.”

“Sure,” I said. “I’ll text you.”

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*

Dinner went okay. He was sweet but awkward; he kept teetering on the edge of telling me something about ghosts. He’d say something like, “sometimes they look, well…” and then go silent before changing the subject. It was like he wasn’t sure if he could trust me. I was determined to show that he could.

We started hanging out a few times a week. Sometimes we’d get dinner, other times it was coffee, a movie, or a walk.

I can’t say I ever liked him that much, at least not romantically, but there was a certain dependency that started not long after the first dinner date. To some degree, I felt close to him because of the power we shared. But he also had this anxious desperation. He hid it well with his smiles and cheesy jokes, but I could tell by how \\\\\\\*hard\\\\\\\* he tried that he was holding his breath with me, or on the edge of his seat, silently begging me not to go. He paid for things and opened doors; he gave me flowers and chocolate. When it was time to say goodbye each night, he’d grab my hand and hold it for just a little too long. Before letting go, he’d squeeze hard, as if considering pulling me in.

So when one day Charles asked me if I wanted to go back to his apartment, I said yes. Not because I felt that I had to, and not because I thought he would be mad if I said no, but because I wanted to be there for him. I wanted to see where he lived, what he kept in his fridge, what he had on his walls, what his room smelled like, I wanted to understand him.

He had no welcome mat or decorations, just a TV, a couch, and some books stacked against the wall. No kitchen table, no recliner, no place to put our shoes.

“You sure know how to live,” I said.

He laughed. “When I was a kid, I spent all my time inside. I didn’t get the chance to experience much. So, when I started living on my own, I decided I’d spend as much time outside as possible. No need for a lot when I’m barely here.”

We sat down on the couch and talked for a while. I don’t remember what about. What I do remember is the way his eyes softened and his lips parted slowly. How he lowered his chin in a way that made him look like a child. I remember, better than I remember anything else, how softly he asked me:

“Will you please try to find me?”

“What?”

“I want you to go outside, count to 10, then come inside and find me.”

Something about the way he asked made it so I couldn’t say no. I went outside and closed the door behind me.

Standing outside in the dark, I was cold and shivering. My heart was pounding and I couldn’t catch my breath. I contemplated running to my car and just forgetting about Charles. I mean, I’d really only known him for a few weeks at this point. Why did he so desperately need me to play this game? I should have just left, but… I had to know where this was going.

When I finished counting I opened the door and scanned the living room. I took a step forward and the sound echoed off the bare walls. I imagined Charles hiding just around the corner. He suddenly had a knife and a rope. He knew exactly where I was. He was waiting.

My throat tightened. The door slammed shut behind me and I cried out. I wanted to leave, but no… it was just a game. I laughed at myself for being so ridiculous.

I took my shoes off before taking another step. The apartment was small and there weren’t a lot of places to hide, but I took my time. I checked behind the couch, under the bed, behind the shower curtain. Each time I turned a corner or opened a door my body was tensed to run.

When I opened the towel closet I found him curled into a ball under the shelf. He was rocking himself back and forth and crying. I reached for him, and he straightened his legs and scooted out. I helped him get to his feet, and he just stared at me. His eyes were wide and he was shaking.

For a moment neither of us moved, but when he took a shaky breath, I leaned in and kissed him. I didn’t know how else to make him feel better.

We had sex that night. I was on top of him with my hands on his chest. I looked straight ahead at the wall the whole time. When we were done we laid next to each other. When he fell asleep I got up and went home.

I came over again to watch a movie a few days later. We sat close together on the couch, almost touching but not.

We were about halfway through when he gently grabbed my chin, turned me toward him, and kissed me. I pulled away on instinct.

“Sorry,” I said. “I just… really like this movie.”

We watched for a little longer, then he paused the TV and said, “Can I tell you something?”

“Of course.”

He took a deep breath.

Charles saw a ghost for the first time while playing in the backyard with his mom. Only, he didn’t realize it was a ghost. He thought it was funny that the yellow dog kept walking back and forth from the big tree to their back door.

When he perfectly described the dog that had died before he was born, was buried under the tree, and that he had absolutely not seen any pictures of, his mom brought him inside and prayed over him for hours.

Later, when he began talking about a “grey man” in the house, she beat him so badly that he was kept out of school for a week for fear of teachers taking notice. She started drinking, and her beatings became more and more frequent. Only, she got smarter about how she dished them out; she hit him in places where no one could see the evidence. She said she was beating the demons out of him.

He started hiding every time his mom drank, or when he knew she’d be coming home late from the bar. She’d walk into the house screaming his name. Sometimes, if he hid really well, it would take her an hour to find him. But she would never stop looking until she did.

“Even now,” he said, “part of me feels… loved. She always looked for me so hard. Like I mattered to her more than anything else in the world. She wanted to find me and beat me because she thought she could cure me. If she hated me she could have just kicked me out or killed me, you know? She never stopped looking, and she never stopped trying. Until she died.”

It happened when he was 12. She came home after a long night at the bar and found him quickly because he wasn’t hiding at all. He was sitting on the couch waiting for her.

She went to slap him, but when her arm was just an inch from his face, he caught her by the wrist, squeezed hard, looked her in the eyes, and told her \\\\\\\*no.\\\\\\\*

When she tried to hit him with her other hand, he caught that one too. He let go, and she tried to hit him again and again. Each time he stopped her. He didn’t hit her back, but for the first time, he defended himself. She ran to her room sobbing.

“I should’ve just hid,” he said. “She would’ve looked for me, and she would’ve found me, like always.”

But in the morning it was he who found her, dead in her bed. There was another her checking in closets and behind furniture.

“I’m right here,” he told her.

She turned.

“You found me.”

She walked toward him like she always did, eyes narrowed and fist raised to strike. But when she brought that fist down, it went swiftly through him like a knife through a thin layer of smoke. She tried to hit him again and again as she screamed like a banshee. 

He backed away. “Why do you want to hurt me!?”

“There’s a demon inside you! You need to stop talking to ghosts!” 

“You’re a ghost!”

He ran out of the house and called the police. But as he looked through the front window, he saw her peeking behind the TV with her arm reared back.

When he was done talking, I told him to hide, and that night I looked for him harder than ever.

For weeks after, almost every night, I’d search for him and we'd end up in bed. I didn’t particularly like the strange game of hide-and-seek, but I didn’t hate it either. It made him happy. I really did want him to be happy. Even if I didn’t love him like he loved me.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*

One day, we were hiking through a trail he’d been begging to take me to for weeks. It was special to him, and he kept stopping to tell me facts about different plants and wildlife. It was so mind-numbingly boring. I kept trying to steer the conversation toward ghosts. I asked him if he could see any right now, or if he could sense any nearby, but all he would say was something like “that’s not how it works” before saying something about the trail. He had just finished explaining the lineage of some tree when I came right out and said it.

“I’m starting to get bored. Will you take me to see your mom?” 

I think we both knew that I was being intentionally vague about what exactly I was getting bored of. I could see the fear in his eyes.

He swallowed hard before answering. “Okay. But only once.”

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*

We went on a Wednesday in the early afternoon so that the family who lived there would all be at school or work. It was a square house on the corner of Bernard Street. Brown brick, three steps up to the patio and front door. We walked through the grass to the right side of the house and looked in through the kitchen windows.

While the house was foundationally no different from the average suburban home, the owners had made it their own in a way that was beautiful. The counter in front of the window held a yellow coffee mug with crudely drawn black lines meant to resemble a bee. The fridge was covered with crayon drawings and A+ grades. There were five chairs circled around the kitchen table.

When I looked over at Charles, his face was pressed against the glass, his breath fogged the space in front of his lips.

“Is she here?” I asked. “I don’t see her.”

Charles only nodded.

“What… what is she doing?”

“Just… walking.”

I closed my eyes and tried to imagine it. A cursed, phantom lady roaming the home, fist-raised, a fiery anger in her eyes as she hunted for her kid in a house full of others. I wondered if any of them ever saw her. Or if she saw them.

After a few moments Charles said, “We better get going before someone sees us,” and we began walking aimlessly down the street.

“Why do you think she’s still there?” I asked. 

“Trauma, I guess. Or purpose. Maybe they’re the same thing. I mean, I was my mom’s trauma, and her purpose was to stop me, right?”

“How come I can’t see her? And how come I can see the one on the street? I don’t understand.”

“I don’t either. But you’re not like me. I see ghosts all the time. You only see the one, right?”

“Yeah. But what’s so special about that one?”

“I don’t know. Maybe you’re connected somehow.” He paused for a moment before finishing. “Please don’t make me take you back here again.”

That night I looked for Charles, and when I found him, he cried so hard that I couldn’t do anything but just hold his head in my lap and brush his hair. It was the first time I felt guilty about us. Did he realize how transactional our relationship was? I thought he did. 

“I’m sorry,” I said, hoping he knew what I meant.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*

Around that time, I found a full-time job as an SAT/ACT tutor. Charles was the first person I called when I got the news. 

“I’m so excited for you,” he said. “You deserve it so much, and I know you’ll do great. How about dinner tonight to celebrate?”

He pulled out all the stops. We had steak and wine, then chocolate cake for dessert. He kept telling me that I was so smart and so qualified. He said it so many times that I was starting to feel like he doubted it. 

At the end of the night he walked me to my car. When we were saying goodbye he looked at me so pleadingly, the way he did when he wanted me to go back to his place and find him. But he could tell that I was tired and he was too sweet to ask. Instead, he gave me a tight hug and squeezed my hand. 

I found myself enjoying my job and looking forward to sessions with students. For the first time in a while I felt as though I had a purpose: helping kids get into college. 

I spent so much more than 40 hours a week on my work. I made detailed plans for each student. I imagined how excited they would be when they finally got their goal scores. It took up almost all my time. I loved it. 

I still cared for Charles, but I was getting bored, and the newfound purpose made it hard to ignore the guilt.

So I began drifting away from him. We went from going to his apartment every day to hanging out once a week. Whenever we were together I had this heavy feeling in my chest, like I was mourning something. Once a week turned to every other week, and I could tell that he realized what was happening. Sometimes there were tears in his eyes when we parted ways. 

Eventually we were just texting every few days, like old college friends. 

How’s work?

Good. 

You?

Good. 

This continued for a while, but as I settled into the routine of my job, I was bored again. The students seemed to get dumber and less motivated over time. It was frustrating to explain the same thing over and over, week after week in all kinds of different ways. They just wouldn’t learn, and yet their parents blamed me when their scores didn’t increase. After a while, I decided there wasn’t a point in what I was doing after all. There was no purpose. Just a job.

I started going to see the street ghost on my own. I started to think of him as \\\\\\\*my\\\\\\\* ghost. My personal reminder that there was more to the world than test scores and bratty teenagers. I became braver, more used to him. I’d walk directly behind him, copying his every move. As we neared the old house, I’d close my eyes and keep walking, imagining that I was him, finishing the steps that he couldn’t. All the time I wondered what the ghost’s trauma was. 

But after a while I started to want more. It wasn’t fair. Why did Charles get to see all these ghosts all the time, and I only had the one?

So I reached out to him again. I texted him and waited a few days, but he didn’t answer. I couldn’t blame him. After all, the last text he’d sent me was asking if I wanted to get dinner. Two weeks later, and I’d never replied.

When I got tired of waiting, I drove to his apartment. I knocked on his door, waited a few minutes, then went home. I tried again the next day, and the next. Eventually I got angry. I treated him like a video game that wasn’t working. He was the reason I couldn’t have my fun, my excitement. And there was only one of him. I couldn’t go buy another copy. So, one day, after sitting outside his apartment for hours, I just… opened the door. 

I called his name. I shouted that it was me; I said I just wanted to make sure he was okay. He didn’t answer, so I walked inside and started looking.

I found myself checking all the places he used to hide back when we were together: behind the couch, in the bedroom closet, under his bed. When I walked into his bathroom, the smell hit me. He was lying in the tub, curled into a ball yet so flat that he was almost sinking into it. Trailing down his wrists were thick lines of dried blood that pooled underneath him. Sitting next to him was another Charles. He looked at me with a blank expression.

“You found me,” he said.

“Oh God,” I cried, falling back against the sink. “What happened to you?”

He didn’t answer.

“Why didn’t you tell me you were going to do this? I could have helped you, couldn’t I have?”

He didn’t respond.

“Why… why are you still here? Are you… like your mom, and the man on the street?”

“Things are different.”

“Are they better?”

He didn’t answer for so long that I almost asked again.

“No,” he said.

“Are you choosing to hide? Could you move on… somewhere else?”

“If I go, then who will find me?”

“I don’t know,” I said. “I’m sorry.”

He was silent after that. I had to fight the urge to break down and scream.

After some time he stood up and walked out of the bathroom. Slow and focused, like the ghost on the street.

I counted to 10.

When I found him behind the couch he smiled. 

“You found me.”

“Charles… isn’t… isn’t there a way for me to help you?”

But he was already looking for a new place to hide. 

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*

I still watch the man on the street. When I’m particularly sad, I follow him until he disappears, then I close my eyes and keep walking. I don’t pretend that I’m him anymore. I let the heat and the smell of death wash over me. I think of my future; I think of my past. I ask myself, sometimes over and over:

Will I be here [forever?](https://www.reddit.com/u/ConnorIsaacWriter/s/8h1kMRuBLJ)
