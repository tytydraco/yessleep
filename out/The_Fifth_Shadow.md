I work in private security. You probably pictured a muscular man in a three-piece suit and earpiece when you read that, huh?

The truth is, I'm your average overweight Midwestern hick, assigned to guard a parking lot outside a local chemical plant. I work the midnight-to-eight shift, so most of the night, I'm by myself.

I work in a small conex that's been converted into an actual office. It’s not terrible; it’s insulated, there’s an AC unit, a fridge, a microwave, and power. I can sit in there most of the night playing on my phone or reading my books. When I describe it to my friends, I call it my box.

Every two hours, though, I have to get up and patrol the lot. It’s a decent bit of exercise; there are two halves of the lot, separated by a small road, but it doesn’t take too long to walk a large circle and make sure no one is breaking into employees' cars.

I used to look forward to it, even.

The problem started a week ago, on one of these patrols. I was walking the north lot, flashlight in hand, looking in car windshields and in the tree lines. As I started toward the south lot, I looked right into the lights down there—four bright ones that lit up both lots.

They’re bright, so it hurt after spending so long in the box.

While my eyes readjusted, I sort of let my mind wander and looked down at the ground.

That’s when something clicked in my brain.

Something wasn’t right here. I wasn’t in danger, I thought, but something was unsettling me.

Have you ever gone on vacation? Far away enough to forget where you came from for a little while? Have you come back and found that something was missing or misplaced? You can’t tell what it is, but you know—

I figured it out.

‘One, two, three, four…five?’

On the ground stretched out in front of me were five long shadows, flung out in a wide arc from me… Except, you may recall, that there are only four lights in the lot.

The fifth shadow, stretching out directly in front of me, seemed to stare back at me just as hard as I stared at it. I looked over my shoulder, trying to figure out if perhaps a stray light from the chemical plant was causing it.

It was four in the morning. The only lights on in the plant are on the other side, where the crews are working on cleaning and maintaining equipment.

The shadow had moved.

I don’t know how, I don’t know when, but I swear on anything I own that when I turned back around, the angle had changed. As if whatever was casting the shadow had changed positions…

My walk back to the box was uneventful, with the shadow in front of me the whole time. I almost walked into a car a couple of times trying to keep my eye on it. But I made it, cracked open the door just wide enough for me to shimmy inside, and locked the door behind me.

It’s dark in my box, with only the four windows to illuminate the space. I have my flashlight to light up the desk if I need to get something, and my phone to fiddle with, so I never needed the overhead lights.

That night, I turned them on, and I immediately felt better. In the brightly lit room, I looked around and thankfully, the only shadow in the now isolated room was the one cast directly beneath me from the only light in the room. One man and one shadow, just as nature intended.

It’s been a week. I still have to patrol every two hours, I still have to walk the lot, I still have to pass under the lights. And I still see it. The fifth shadow, the impossibly dark black shade that seemed to swallow up the ground it covered. It followed me every time I left the box, down every row of cars, across both lots, even to the porta-john, like a loyal dog on my heels.

Not that the thought has gotten any easier, but I have felt less concerned with it each passing day. I know that as soon as I get back to my box, with the door locked and the lights on, the shadow won’t bother me anymore. It was like an unspoken rule between us.

Maybe that’s how I got careless? Thought we were playing a fair game? Thought perhaps we might just co-exist?

Well, I guess that last part’s true. When I got back to the box, I realized that I’d left the door open. I guess I didn’t shut it all the way when I left because it was wide open when I walked back up the gravel path to it. The doorway was dark, which unnerved me because I know I left the lights on when I’d left.

I turned on my flashlight and shot the beam into the box.

Empty.

Nothing but my chair, my desk, and my dark box.

I bolted for the door. I don’t know what possessed me just then, but I knew I needed to get inside as quickly as possible. It was no longer the unsettling feeling of something being out of place—

I was in danger.

As I ran, I moved the beam of the light to my feet. Some primal thought in my head reasoned that if I severed my five shadows from my feet, I could possibly outrun them? Stupid, I know, but in my defense, I think I was out of my mind at this point.

As soon as I crossed the threshold, I slammed the door behind me and locked the deadbolt and stared at the window—

Nothing. An empty gravel lot with a couple of cars in it, just like always.

I felt like a child again, running from a dark room to escape some imaginary monster or demon in the middle of the night.

Still, I was safe and back in my box. I reached across the room to flick the light switch—
It wouldn’t budge. No give at all.

I almost didn’t want to look. Somehow, I knew what was happening. I’d seen enough horror movies to know where this was going.
I looked over to my hand and shined the light on the switch.
There it was.

My shadow. Except it wasn’t shadowing me anymore.

It was pressing the opposite side of the switch, refusing to let me turn the bright lights back on.
I’m sitting in my chair now, writing this. The light of my phone is kind of soothing, now that I think about it. But the battery is getting low…
You always hear about stories like this, where the main character does something heroic to get themselves out of the situation they find themselves in?

That’s not me… I’m just your average overweight Midwestern hick, sitting in my dark box with my dying phone…and my extra shadow reading over my shoulder.
