A crowd of people ran in a multi-colored band of light – a rainbow, at the end of which gold shone in a pot. People running sank into the rainbow, up to their ankles, knees, and others to their jaws, and finally fell into the abyss.



Mark was an average person – he had average height, average job, average apartment and average aspirations. And this averageness started to bother him lately, like sleeping on a pea, maybe that's why he has these strange dreams? Never mind, it's time to get out of bed and turn on the app that will change his gray life. Invest AI – that was the not very creative name of the tool, it was an assistant for investing in the stock market. How did it actually work? Nobody knew, because it was closed software, maybe it was trained on all available historical stock market data? Or maybe not entirely, because there are so-called. "black swans", or unexpected events, such as the invention of synthetic rubber at a time when astronomical costs had been incurred in creating infrastructure for obtaining natural rubber, due to which all previous attempts to bind the stock exchange with mathematics and statistics had come to nothing - at least that's how Robert, who knew about it, explained it to Mark, supposedly knew, Mark knew nothing at all, his profession was average as I mentioned above, and the stock exchange was supposed to be a tool to break out of mediocrity. Maybe he would know a little more, but the entrepreneurship lessons at his school were taught by Mrs. Zabska, who confused the class with a therapy office and spent most of her classes grumbling about her old man.



Mark was one of the rainbow runners, he ran up to another runner and gently tugged on his shirt – “what’s going on here?” he gasped. The other one – I know that much, we’re running to this pot of gold, I haven’t seen anyone succeed, some fell at the very end, we sink while running, if we stop we slowly start to emerge, people try different techniques, spinning, jumping, running in a zigzag to minimize the effect of sinking, what happens after falling – I don’t know, that’s all.



He woke up again, drenched in sweat. A quick breakfast and coffee, and he sat down at the computer and the stock exchange. The tool indicated a great investment in rare element mines in Modena. This small African country was founded by one of the European colonial powers, then retaken by another. In the 1970s, on the wave of decolonization, the locals gained independence, because whites lost interest in maintaining the colonies; a decade later, rare elements were discovered and the country was enriched, which, however, mainly benefited the rulers.



Mark tried different running styles, but he was already knee-deep in the rainbow, he saw on one side more people falling, on the other side that his running partner, who had explained the rules of the game to him, although he had nodded long enough to be on the surface, had not started running again. What are you doing? – asked Mark – run! No – replied the other – I think I understand now, I'm staying here.



The strange nightmare was so real that our hero felt sore in the morning. Bad news awaited him at the computer. The minister, who owed his position to commissioning a study of the views of the residents of his constituency on various issues and asking his parish priest about the same, then taking the average and making it his election program, informed about the withdrawal of our diplomats from Modena due to a coup d'état. The previous prime minister, with the help of the army, overthrew the pro-Western president, announced the nationalization of the mines, so that not foreign corporations but the people would profit from the wealth of their land. To make matters worse, the AI would not allow the sale of shares in the mine to recover even a scrap of invested money.





Mark was already quite close to the finish line, he lost sight of his friend and was already nose-deep in the rainbow. When he was only a few meters away from the pot, he fell, flying between the clouds, until suddenly everything went black. He opened his eyes to see that he was sitting in a cauldron of boiling liquid, two unfortunate people next to him in the same situation, and in the middle of the room appeared a winged creature with hooves and a goat's head, breathing fire from its mouth. Just as suddenly the creature changed into an old man with a thinning gray mane and a gray, crumpled suit and spoke "well, enough of the theater, you are intelligent boys, we can do without these tricks to make you guess that I am the lord of evil. Evil in the broad sense, so to speak. Because you see, according to your monkey logic, if you punch your neighbor in the ass, evil will happen and you are the evildoer, but if you stand crookedly on the sidewalk and twist your ankle, evil will happen, but you do not consider yourselves evildoers. Here in this vestibule, which you usually call purgatory, this distinction does not count, I feed on evil, it does not matter whether the perpetrator does it intentionally, accidentally, or from above, no guilt in the earthly sense can be attributed to him". Mark noticed that together with his companions in misery they were not sitting in steaming cauldrons but on chairs, with their hands tied with cable ties.



The hero's next wake-up call was not the most pleasant, but this time a pleasant surprise was waiting for him in the computer. The value of the shares of the Modenian mines that Mark had shot up and the AI bought large subsequent packages when investors terrified by the coup d'état sold them at junk prices. Mark had just become a rich man. This was possible because a certain People's Front of Modenia marched on the capital and after several exchanges of fire with the army, restored the overthrown president to power, who immediately assured that the property of Western corporations in the country was not threatened. Upon closer examination, it began to get strange. No one had heard of the People's Front of Modenia before. It was mentioned only by a few blogs of unknown origin and an article in Wikipedia describing a provincial pro-Western movement, however, experts in this field expressed the assumption that it was a recent entry that had been backdated to look four years older. An investigative journalist put forward the thesis that in reality, unknown perpetrators had paid a group of international mercenaries who defeated the pro-government forces. However, a moment after sending the article to the editor, the journalist was shot. Mark was very confused, on the one hand the joy of the almost miraculous earnings, on the other the strange circumstances surrounding the topic; he glanced again at the Wikipedia article illustrated with a photo of the alleged warriors. They look like they were generated by artificial intelligence - he thought - created by AI; then cold sweat broke out on him.



Well gentlemen, but to emphasize that we are not in Versailles, it is time for some tradition – the old man began, after which a fire with a rod lying in it appeared in front of him. I have chosen you three here now because of certain, let's say, differences in approach to the surrounding world. For a moment I considered sticking toothpicks under your fingernails, but let's solve this quickly, the weekend awaits – he said, after which he grabbed the already heated rod with his bare hand. Well then – he said and directed the rod towards the first one. He shouted – Black Lord, I have always been on your side and I renounce God! Then he shouted when the rod reached his face. Maybe we can come to an agreement – the second one replied – I will do whatever you want, just don't burn me with it! The old man lowered his hand with the rod, smiled, then shouted – you can't give me shit, you monkey and with a quick movement burned his face. Now he turned his gaze to Mark – and you? What will you tell me, young man? F*ck off! – he shouted back – I don't want to have anything to do with you or anything you represent. The smile disappeared from the old man's face, he grabbed Mark by the arm with his other hand, he said – don't fidget, you have these dreams, you are here because cancer is developing in your body unnoticed and that is why we are assessing where you will end up after everything. I will heal you. Well, that's it, run away to the valley of tears, the door is on the left hand side, check-up in fifty years. And as for the two of you – he looked at the two unfortunates – gentlemen, come with me.
