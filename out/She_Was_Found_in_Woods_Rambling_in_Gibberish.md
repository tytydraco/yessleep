Honestly I don't know where to begin. I'm not sure where this event actually starts, but I guess the camping trip my girlfriend took recently is as good a place as any. I'll call her Alice because she loved the book Alice in Wonderland. Anyway she loves the outdoors; hiking, camping, fishing, walking any all nature trail she can find were all her hobbies. Even before I met her she would camp in the woods alone, so after meeting her there was no telling her no. She could take of herself she said. But this time it was different, and no one can understand why. 

It was just last Friday that she decided to spend the weekend camping out at Naked Falls in Stevenson, Washington. We're Portland natives, so it isn't too far. A drive certainly, but not a terrible one. I had to work that weekend and I wasn't able to go, but I kept in touch as often as I could. Eventually Alice eent silent for a few hours. Now this could be due to poor reception, except when she finally texted me back her reply didn't make much sense. My last text to Alice read "been ~30 min since I txtd u last. Msg when able. Luv + miss u." And when I finally heard back all I got for a response was "Stars misty sarin air 2nite shimr wtr calm" which I can guess well enough at the meaning, however no mention of reception or her feelings toward me and I get it. If she was focused on the outdoors, which make her very happy, then I guess the other details aren't prevalent in her mind. I texted her back asking what she is up to at the moment and all I got back was "flowers nice smell luv gnite." And I didn't really know what to think, but I figured she was tired. Maybe I just needed to let her rest and I needed to get some sleep myself.

The next morning I send her a good morning text as I got ready for work. I kept cheking my phone all morning, and afternoon, and when I got home.  Honestly I was getting incredibly worried, especially after getting this message "luv 2tah4 ui9ang4 hed shadw hhshdy38a1" needless to say I couldn't really understand it. I mean I guess there is a word or two in there? But the rest?? I'd be lying if I said panic hadn't begun to set in. I didn't know what to do. Alice isn't technically a missing person and maybe it was a butt text? I guess that could be a thing? Right? So I texted her back asking what she meant. I got back "789192683 45 gsy6739k3jio hd6n jeiei39928w717jwnneu38."

I'll skip to the next event. Basically the weekend came to and end with little to no meaningful conversation. Actually Sunday and Monday went by with no communication at all. Yes, Monday. She was supposed to be back on Monday. The police were notified since she had been out of contact for 48 hours. They weren't any help. An adult apparently has the right to go missing, just not in so many words, but that's basically the message I got. So I used a sick day from work to go find her and, to keep a long search short, all I found was her tent and supplies. I didn't see anything that looked like foul play,  but I'm not a cop. I searched all day and well into the evening, finally deciding to make camp in the tent she left behind in case she came back. She didn't. 

I'll skip to her eventual discovery. Some fellow campers I met decided to help me out and we finally found her walking barefoot deep in the woods, dirty, disoriented, and unable to communicate with anyone. She could talk, but it was unintelligible gibberish. Or was it? I'm not sure now. I don't think it was any language. When we asked what she was doing walking barefoot in the woods she said something like "Eh oteche nihom. Olaf meihe" I was with the man who found her and we puzzled over this reposnse for hours.  She was so confused and I don't know if she truly recognized me, which scared me.

We got her to a hospital by evening. The doctors were no help. She suffered some bruising, scratches, she had sticks and thorns all over. No serious injuries like broken bones. The most mysterious things is the inability to communicate. Always gibberish answers. It frustrated both her and us. She kept repeating her gibberish, saying it louder and trying to enunciate clearly, but it wasn't any known language. We couldn't undertand her regardless of her efforts.

The mental ward. She is there now, actually. Under observation becaus of her violence, her frustration in us not understanding her no matter how hard she tried. The most terrifying part was when she looked me in the eyes, and me looking back into her desperate, sad, frustrated eyes, and her asking "Aiy tanekk daensthernduuhuh eihem??" As if I would somehow get it. She was pleading with me to get it. She wanted so bad to get through to me and I still don't understand what she was asking.

So I'm currently typing all this out in a tent in Naked Falls. I'll use all my sick time any vacation days I've earned.

Update: I thought I heard her voice. I thought she was crying? Leaving tent. Currently 10:40 PM

Update: I don't recognize ehat I see. The trees look foreign. The plants. The stars. I don't know. I'm lost I think. Maybe I need to retrace my steps.

Update: I am hearing her! 11:16 now. I couldn't find my way back, and then I heard her voice calling desperately for me. I don't understand, but if she's out here I need to find her.

Update: I'm not sure I understand the time. 31? It's after... I don't understand the phone's time. 13? I think it's after 10. Right?

Updayed: she there. Saw. From bwhind. She is. Hiw??? She says loves me. Say stay. Say here. Herr.
