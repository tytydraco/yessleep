  

Peter Jespar heard the hiss of the bus’s hydraulic lifts from inside the station. By the time he was out, the bus was already pulling away from the curb.

He sighed and checked his watch. It would be another fifteen minutes until the next one with not a thing to do in the meantime.

The station was dead silent. Peter was alone outside. There was just the ghost of a breeze on the night air, refreshing after what had been a hot, summer’s day. Moths fluttered around the lights that illuminated the curb in a fluorescent glow. If there was more of a view it might have been nice. But all there was to look at was the brick wall of the neighboring building, and a dumpster overflowing with garbage bags by the street corner. Even the steel canopy above blocked out the stars.

Peter sighed just to hear anything in the vast, empty silence. The station was normally bustling in the day, but in the dark of night it had become all but abandoned. By now he’d expected someone to turn up. Perhaps someone else who worked the evening shift. But no one seemed to be as unlucky as him in their timing.

As he stood there, he heard a crash among the garbage cans at the front of the station. A metal lid had slid off, reverberating like a drum hat until at last it came to a rest. Peter’s heart nearly leapt from his chest. He looked towards the commotion but saw no movement in the darkness.

*Just a raccoon*, he thought, *just going through the trash.* The little guy would be hiding now after making such a racket, even more spooked by the noise than him. He allowed his heart rate to return to normal.

A grumbling arose from above, and Peter had to wonder whether it was the muffler of a car that was about to pass, or perhaps the distant murmuring of thunder. But he soon became aware of the sound of scraping metal. He noticed soft thuds between the scrapes. Of metal squeaking. And all of it was coming from above him. Not from the street beyond like he’d thought, but from the steel roof, as though something had clattered atop.

Another thud and another scrape. And as whatever it was came closer, Peter became aware of just how huge it was. That there were two sets of scraping, one about five meters further back than the other. A horrible sniffing accompanied it, as though whatever were on the roof were searching for him. And sure enough, the scratching footsteps were getting closer as they made their way towards the edge of the steel canopy above him. 

Peter quietly allowed himself into the empty subway station. He shuffled backwards, careful not to make a sound as he watched the edge of the roof intently. He thought he could see the very tips of claws curl over the side. First one set, next another. And then, with a flash of black and a thud, he saw something fall from the roof.

Standing on his tip toes, all he could see through the glass door was a dark mass on the ground. In the fluorescent lights he could make out a scaly definition. But what frightened him most was it’s size, as whatever had fallen was as large as a mini cooper while curled.

The creature began to uncurl itself, and as it did, Peter disappeared down the steps of the staircase that led into the subway. From his new vantage point, he could see only the glass door that he’d entered the station from. The glass had fogged in the meantime, and he realized that the creature must have its head practically against the door. The sniffing sound from before resumed. 

There came the chime of bells from somewhere above and then a voice spoke over the PA system. “Help keep the TTC safe. Report any suspicious behavior to a TTC official or a police officer…” said the recording.

Peter felt numb and looked to the door in time to see it fly open. In a second, Peter had whirled around and was flying down the tile staircase. *Shit, shit, shit*. His heart raced. He jumped down several steps at a time, feeling his leg threaten to give out upon landing. 

He bolted around the corner and on to the subway platform. He could hear whatever it was sliding down the stairs after him. He let out a whimper.

What had he done to deserve this? He wondered. What cruel twist in circumstances had made this how his life was going to end up? He cursed himself for working late, and worst for all, missing the bus when he could've ran for it.

Peter sprinted clear to the end of the tunnel. A quick glance over his shoulder and he could see a black shape standing at the bottom of the staircase. In that brief glimpse he could already see it taking its first decisive step towards him.

Peter jumped from the subway platform and onto the tracks. He didn't want to, but he dashed into the tunnel. Into absolute darkness. Behind him he could hear a small thud from the creature also falling onto the tracks and then scuttling. It grew louder quickly. A huffing accompanied it. *Meh, meh, meh.,* sounding tired but determined. In seconds, the sound was upon him. It became all that he could hear, more than his own footfalls, the sound echoing in the quiet of the tunnel. And then, Peter felt a pressure on his calf. A vice-like grip had clamped on and with it came the sting of thin, scalpel-like teeth plunging into his skin. He could feel something warm and moist sucking on the blood that streamed from the wound. A muscular tongue slathered the site with sticky saliva. Peter tried to wriggle himself free but the creature jerked viciously, and he fell to the ground.

Peter screamed. The creature, rough and scaly, climbed atop his chest. He could feel his skin scraping against the creature’s like a coarse file as he tried to push it off. Feel the weight of the monster crushing his chest cavity. Smell the rancid, sour stench of the creature’s breath. The last thing he remembered experiencing was the feeling of a vice upon his neck, and two rows of sharp prickles digging in.

The next day, his discovery would make the papers. “Body with Mysterious Wounds Struck by the Morning Train". A story filled with the horrified accounts of those daily commuters who saw the blood upon the front of the train as it pulled into the station would take up most of the front page. If one had just read that, they may have been left baffled or shocked, particularly in regards to the strange markings upon his neck. And indeed, many would read just that, and rumors of a monster in the subway would quickly get around. But a less showy story of that day, told on page 3 of the paper, would lend some clarity to those who found it. “Komodo Dragon Escapes Black Market Pet Shop” read the title above a modestly sized article.
