I missed the last train a few weeks back. Or maybe I didn’t. It’s hard to remember now.

The station was deserted, hollow in a way that felt wrong. The overhead speakers had gone silent. The lights above hummed dully with fluorescent bulbs. That’s when I noticed it, a side exit I’d never seen before, hidden between two vending machines. The sign above it was blank, but the door stood slightly open, like it had been left for me.

Beyond it was more station. But not really.

The walls were tiled in that same cold, split color ceramic tiles: white on the top, blue on the bottom. But there were no signs, no benches, no tracks, just a series of empty corridors. They stretched endlessly, stripped of all detail, silent except for the echoes of my footsteps. And at the end of each corridor sat a dark wooden door with a crash bar. As I walked through opening the door to each new corridor, I knew, somehow, without being told; that this was a trial. I had to keep moving. If I stopped, I’d fail. And if I failed... I’d be trapped.

I walked for at least 30 minutes, coming down a new corridor, opening the door, and moving down to the next.

Then I came to the room with the ducklings.

A wicker basket held a dozen of them, fluffy and soft, their tiny heads blinking up at me. Next to it sat a table, and on it, a syringe filled with a black, oily liquid. A card rested beside it scrawled in frantic handwriting it said: **“Pick one.”**

I don’t want to tell you what I did next. But I moved on. I *had* to.

I reached the next door. As I pushed it open, the lights began to flicker wildly. The hallway ahead shifted to a deep, cold blue. The air felt electric. And when I got to the end of the corridor and moved to push the door, a large hand crashed into the door on my right side, standing beside me, peering deep into my eyes, was a man.

No, not a man. Something tall, too tall. His back was hunched, hair matted and stringy, beard grown like twisted vines around his mouth. His eyes were wide, bulging with a kind of primal fury. Every time I tried to open the door, he met me with a look of pure rage, he was barring the path forward and staring straight into me like he’d been waiting. His lips curled back like an animal and though he said nothing, the message was clear: **“Don’t.”**

I knew it in my heart, if I stayed, I would die. After a few tense seconds, I knew I had to move, I screamed, not to try to scare him, but to psych myself out.

I lunged forward crashing into the new corridor and quickly tried to push the door from the other side to keep him out, but he slammed back. The pressure was unbearable, like pushing against an avalanche. There was barely a moment before he burst in behind me. He...it...didn’t move normally, it was running backward on impossibly long limbs, contorting with each lurching step like gravity didn’t apply to it. I could see it more clearly now; it was at least fifteen feet tall. It didn’t scream. It didn’t speak. It just chased.

I ran with all the strength I could muster, and I barreled through another door at the end of the corridor, slamming it shut with every ounce of panic I had left.

It was silent now. There came no bang from the door I just left.

The new corridor was bright.

This new space was different. Gone were the flickering lights and tiled walls. The new hallway was sterile, blinding white. The floor gleamed under fluorescent lights. Everything felt cleaner, quieter, it was more like an empty hospital than a station.

And just ahead, the final door, I knew this intuitively.

I ran toward it, hope, growing in my chest until something entered the corridor from the door, I had just closed some moments ago.

Another tall figure. Wider. Bloated. It was all white, with a ruffled clown collar.  Its face was painted like a clown, but the features were wrong. There was no mouth. Just patches of black makeup and a pair of burning orange eyes. Its body was misshapen, it was either morbidly obese or wearing some inflated suit, but it moved with impossible speed. Each step brought it closer, it grew larger, taking up more and more of the corridor as it got closer.

I didn’t look back.

I flung myself through the final door.

I think I made it out.

But sometimes, when I pass by the train station, I see a flicker. A shadow. Something tall. Something watching.

And I wonder if the trial ever really ended.
