Aliens are stalking my friend and he doesn’t know it!


You’ve probably noticed him by now- the stranger looking straight at the wall? You may have noticed he isn’t breathing, or the fact that the longer you look at him the more dazed you get. Is he staring at you?


 Don’t look at him. Don’t acknowledge him. Don’t make a sound and don’t- I repeat DO NOT LOOK AT HIM. 

It’s not important why you’ve found this post now. 


What matters now is that you’re reading it. If there isn’t a man in your home who you don’t recognize, STOP READING THIS NOW. Following these instructions while no danger abounds may summon the very thing you seek to avoid. 

If you recognize the man in your home but feel like something off about him, please say the words ‘I AM LOOKING FOR THE KITCHEN PEPPER’ softly into your device. It’s not important what it means. It will bring you the proper instructions.

Remember, if there’s genuinely nothing, STOP READING THIS NOW. That means it’s being transmitted to the wrong location. I need you to be very careful about this. You or someone you know could very well die soon.

I’m going to make several assumptions now. I’m going to assume the man hasn’t moved yet. I’m going to assume you haven’t moved either. That’s good- don’t move. You’re going to need to follow my instructions very carefully.


Good. I’m going to ask you a series of questions now.


Have you noticed a strange presence in the air recently? Have you and a friend that looks oddly like The Man in the Kitchen recently gone out?


During your time out, have you or your friend noted the presence of a bright shining light in the air?


Has your friend recently been distant? Talking only of extraterrestrial life?


What about eating- do you notice how he hasn’t needed to breathe or eat or sleep and drink?


If you thought ‘YES’ to any of those questions then this is for you. 




To combat this thing we must weave it into a basket of stories so that we may gain power over it. Knowledge is power, even as little as we know. This foul thing, this alien- WAIT. HAS IT MOVED?


 You can no longer see the man? Quickly now, read faster- we must act fast if we are to combat this alien thing.
      
  Be assured you are not alone in this. I too happened across this creature, this regionless, faceless, beast. It comes from a world we don’t entirely know, a place where our world crosses another.
      
  It’s alien but not from space. That light in the air you may have seen- the light should be a place where the lines of time and magic and bountiful things collide. Ley lines? Time circles? Spheres of dissonance?


 Any of them ringing a bell?

 I came across it two years ago. Me and my friend Mitchell. We saw the light and talked about it. Two weeks passed and I started to notice the change. He would stare at distant things and completely blank out.

I could see something reflected in his eyes. Something that was a beige mess of… I don’t know what to call it.
      


  He didn’t seem to recall seeing anything. And then as time went by I started to see it more and more. A mess of sticky strange eyes, peering from corners, paws around hallways, watching.
     


   It was hunting, watching him. He never seemed to notice it, even as the thing got braver and braver. And everyday I could swear the thing looked more and more like him.
All the while, he’d stare vacantly into the distance, always just past me as if at something over my shoulder. Maybe it’s a good thing he was oblivious to the horror unfolding around him. 


If there's nothing you can do to change the outcome, maybe it's better if you don't know what’s coming for you.


I did try to warn him, I really did. It was in those first couple of weeks after we saw the light – the light that must have let something bleed from another world into ours, the light that he had stared at just a bit longer than I did. I began to truly notice it a few days after I first saw the hint of wrongness in his eyes. They reflected something awful back at me, something that I could barely comprehend, but even then knew was never meant to exist, at least not here.
It was more of a suggestion of something at first, the beginnings of an unnerving presence not yet fully formed. As time went on, though, I could see it more clearly, something fleshy and unnatural slinking in the dark corners and long narrow halls of his home. 




I tried to point it out to him, but even when his eyes were trained directly on it – even as he spoke of things from another place, another world, foreign and incomprehensible to us – he failed to see that exact creature, right behind him.


Even as it remade itself, its twisting shuddering form began to stand upright, the limbs and body beginning to take the shape of something more… human, he claimed that he never saw anything.


Even as it began to resemble him.
It seemed emboldened by his lack of reaction – I’d no longer see him alone, it would always be there, drifting behind him with its unnatural gait, a cheap and unfinished imitation of my friend that only I could see.
I can still recall the moment when the last remaining hope that I could help him, that things could somehow go back to the way they were, shriveled and died. I’d gone over to his house to check on him. He didn't answer his phone, or the doorbell, but I found the door unlocked. As I cautiously navigated through the dark rooms, I could tell that something was very wrong. I felt a fleeting moment of relief when I came across him, standing, his head cocked as he saw me enter, a peaceful smile on his face. Relieved, I flipped on the lights, only to see my friend, the real Mitchell, crouched in the corner, staring at the wall in the dark.


In the faint lighting, I then realized that it was the thing, his alien, unnatural stalker, smiling at me. 


It still hadn't got the eyes right back then.
Sometimes, I still see those eyes in my nightmares.


As terrible as it was to see this thing look more and more like him, I couldn't help but have a sinking feeling that once it fully mastered his form, something far worse would happen…


The thing eventually replaced Mitchell. I had to act as if I hadn't noticed because I fear that it would do the same thing to me. 


Anytime I'm alone with it in Mitchell's house it just sits there on his bed smiling at me with its head cocked sideways. Mumbling the same gibberish that Mitchell did about life forms outside of this planet. Whenever I'm curious as to what this creature is trying to say I would get a safe distance away from it and listen to it's ramblings. Where it is pretending to be Mitchell it seemed to have copied human speech. Most of the time the words are so mumbled together that I couldn't hear them completely. I thought I heard a "not the first '' and "something will be waiting for us' '. 


It didn't seem to mind whenever I went to see Mitchell in his corner. I'd try to snap him out of his trance every chance I get but so far nothing has worked. He almost looks like a skeleton now where he hasn't eaten or slept. 


His family seems oblivious to this creature that now shows itself as Mitchell. I feel like a couple of them have noticed a change but just didn't say anything. Everytime they look at "Mitchell '' as they sort of slow down and stop talking. I've tried to get some of his family alone so that we can talk about the creature. They would just laugh and say I've been watching too many scary movies or just hallucinating. That's why I've never looked at it in the face again.


One night I came over to Mitchell's house to spend the night. I came to his house only to find a horrific scene. Everyone of his family members were laying on the floor dead, their bodies bent in every location. I saw Mitchell's body laying amongst them and got really terrified. I ran straight upstairs to Mitchell's bedroom. The creature that was him was nowhere to be seen!


The cops were eventually called and summed it up as a murder. I was interrogated but kept the stuff about the man and how it transformed into Mitchell to myself. I thought that if I did that they would think that I was crazy and send me to a psychiatric hospital! 


It has been a few days since then but lately I've noticed disturbing changes. People on the street would look at me with that disturbing half cocked smile as I walked by. I realized that I don't have the stomach to eat anymore either. Everytime I do I feel like I'm about to puke it all back up. I've also been seeing circles in the lights more. Way more. There would be two or three every night that I would look at the sky. Everytime I see them I would think of Mitchell and how he'd had ended up. Why did it have to be him! Why him out of all the Earth's population?! 


“Because it was the best way to get to you.”
 
My stomach fired a series of contradictory lurches, hot and cold at the same time, like I’d eaten twelve too many rancid fish sticks that were burnt and scalding on the outside but still frozen at their cores.
 
I wheeled around to see Mitchell.
 
“It was always you I wanted. Come with me to a place where the lines of time and magic and bountiful things collide.”
 
I wanted it to be my friend. I *prayed* to any god or demon that would listen, begging for everything to go back the way it once was.
 
But something wasn’t right with the way he was standing, his head cocked at just the wrong angle, a peaceful smile on his face that made me feel horrible.
 
It still hadn't got the eyes right.
 
“Come with me and leave your brain behind.”
 
Anger and fear, now indistinguishable from one another, overwhelmed my thoughts as I slammed against the thing’s chest.
 
I didn’t bother looking to see if he was still standing before I turned and ran into the kitchen. Realizing I’d forced myself into a corner, I pushed back against the counter and wheeled around.
 
The Mitchell-thing was two inches from my face.
 
I yelped and leapt back, hopping onto the counter.
 
It extended a hand toward me, and I nearly shit my pants and I realized that it had seven fingers. No – it had three. *Twelve.* Nothing appeared or went away, it’s just that the numbers weren’t right, at least in my head. Space and time remade themselves, their twisting shuddering form crawling through my brain like worms.
 
I reached across the counter and my fingers rested on the filet knife. I stared at something reflected in his eyes, something that was a beige mess, and I stabbed.
 
I stabbed my friend Mitchell for a long time.
 
The thing was still standing long after I’d torn away enough flesh to kill ten men.
 
Then, through a face without eyes and a mouth with no lips, it smiled.
 
I could see all thirty-one teeth on top, and each of the ninety-one in his jaw.
 
That’s when it collapsed in a heap of meat.
 
The sirens started immediately, piercing my mind as I stared down at my bloody hands.
 
There was no way to identify the butchered body at my feet.
 
The police would only know that I’d killed someone. I couldn’t clean up fast enough.
 
The cop cars screeched to a halt in front of my house. I had no idea how they’d arrived so quickly, but nothing made sense, and the world was spinning faster than I could hang on. I grabbed my laptop, racing into the basement before shutting the door behind me. I triple-locked it just as the police burst into my house.
 
Which brings me to this moment, where I’m writing my warning to all of you.
 
They’ll break the door down soon. Of course, I realize they might not be police. I doubt they’re even human. What I can say is that there are men in my home whom I do not recognize. But whether I’ll be arrested for homicide or forced into whatever the beings want to do with me, it doesn’t matter.
 
I’m finished.
 
All I know for sure is that there is a light that must have let something bleed from another world into ours; I’m staring at the light just a bit longer than I did before. It was never meant to exist, at least not here.
 
I don’t have much time. They’ve nearly broken down the door. I still have the filet knife. It’s not sufficient to fight off half a dozen armed police or whatever it is that came from another world.
 
But it’s enough to take care of me.
 
So this is my last will and testament. I hope with every fiber of my being that it’s reached someone, and that it can save at least one person.
 
If this made it to you, and if you’ve noticed them like I do, please make my death worthwhile.
 
Don’t look into the light.
