We moved here when I was just starting high school, only a year ago, after our house was taken by a fire. We lived in town, close to everything and everyone. I could ride bikes in the evening with my friends while my parents watched from the front porch.

Now, our house is on the outskirts of town, secluded from anyone else. My parents chose the house due to the beautiful scenery: a running river, willow trees that dance in the breeze, grasshoppers that jump as you walk through the swaying grass. They said it would be our “new start.” 

*I* didn’t want to move, as it meant I had to go to the high school that all my friends considered ghetto and of course, I would be the only one of my group not going to the better school. Other than that, I loved the new house. I loved spending time in the trees with my parents, having picnics under nature’s canopies.

It was lovely. ***Was.*** 

Then, Mom was diagnosed with stage four brain cancer. She had been suffering from migraines and she finally decided to get it checked out. That’s when the doctor gave us the news. It was devastating for all of us and we just knew that we didn’t have much time. She passed only a month after the diagnosis.

When Mom died, everything changed. The river stopped singing, the trees stopped dancing, and the grasshoppers stopped coming around. It was as if Mother Nature was mourning her death just as Dad and I were.

And Dad? He changed. He was still the same man, but there was a new hardness to him, almost like he was trying to hide his brokenness from me, from the world. He hardly smiled, rarely laughed, and was stricter on me than he had ever been before. It’s not easy, but I know it’s his way of grieving, so I comply and never complain.

Before her passing, Mom was the one who drove me to school as the new high school was on her way to work. After she was gone, Dad drove me to school, until he got a new job that required him to be there earlier than I even woke up.

The first day I saw the bodies, it was just a test run to see if I knew my way to school so that I could call him if I needed him.

I only caught a glimpse of the sunken faces barely floating above the water when I screamed and booked it back home. I cried and told my dad. He called the police but when they got to the river, there was nothing there. No bodies. No faces.

My dad apologized to the officers while I cried on the couch, chalking it up to my mother’s death messing with my head. 

After the police left the first time, my dad let me stay home for an hour before he made me go again.

The second time I passed, they were still there.

I just ran past them, knowing Dad would have my hide if I went back home.

I never told anyone about it. I don’t have friends, as no one wanted to talk to the “new girl” even after a year. And I just knew if I told my dad that I saw them again, he would send me to the loony bin.

The first few times I passed the river, I would just run. Run and pretend they weren’t there. Pretend their pale, soggy faces weren’t staring up at me, daring me to come closer. 

I never recognized the people. They always looked like someone I *could* know, but I could never put a name to them. Just familiarity.

After a while, I got used to them. I would just walk past the river, earbuds in, ignoring the empty eyes I could feel staring holes into me. 

One day, I got curious. I walked to the edge of the water and looked down. I wish I hadn’t.

I looked down at the soulless eyes staring up at me, hair floating around thoughtless heads. There was one in particular that caught my attention. A woman. Maybe it was her long blonde hair, maybe it was her piercing blue eyes, but whatever it was, I couldn't stop looking at her.

Without realizing it, I started walking closer and closer to her, like something was pulling me to the water. I only stopped when I could feel the river water seep into the toe of my shoe. Gasping, I backed away and continued on my way to school, shoe squishing as I walked.

I went back to walking straight past them, making sure to keep my eyes on where I was walking and not letting them wander to the water.

It was a few more weeks before something else had happened.

I was walking to school per usual, when the river came into view. I planned on just ignoring them like I had been, when I noticed it. A hand sticking out of the water, raised almost like asking a question. 

I kept my eyes on it and as I got closer, it started to wave at me. 

Again, letting my curiosity get the best of me, I walked closer. I looked over the edge of the water.

Usually, there are multiple bodies, ranging from three to seven depending on the day. This time, there was just one.

And I *recognized* it.

“Mom!” I yelled at the water.

Her unblinking green eyes just started at me as she continued to wave. Her once plump olive skin was pale and sallow. Her fire red hair was tangled with sticks and leaves.

I threw my backpack down jumped into the water. In the back of my mind I knew it wasn’t her. I knew she was buried in the cemetery on the other side of town, peacefully at rest. But I couldn’t help the part of me that wanted to pull her out of the water, to bring her home where she belonged.

When I was about waist deep, she disappeared, sinking into the murky brown. I splashed around trying to find her, but it was no use. She wasn’t there.

I willed myself out of the water and walked back home, dripping all the way. I got home and showered. I made my way back out of the door and made it to school, barely making it to first hour. 

I didn’t tell anyone about what I saw. Not until now. 

I haven’t been to school in a week, telling my dad it was my time of the month. He never really understood girl things because mom always took care of whatever I needed. He said I could stay home “until it passed.” I’ve been holed up in my room ever since.

What does it mean? Why could I never recognize them before, but now I can see my mom? Why are they messing with me like this? What are they? What do they want from me?

I recognize the bodies in the water.
