Why?

I got here a few hours early, like I always do. You never know with these security lines, right? Sometimes they can take ages. But I walked into the terminal, lugging my duffel bag on my shoulder, and there was no one here. Where is everyone?

I mean, there are cars in the parking lots. It’s true, I didn’t park far enough away that I needed a shuttle. I was able to find a decent spot in the nearest uncovered lot. Ten minute walk. Not bad. Not bad at all. Though, I’m not sure I’ll remember my spot when I return. The numbers next to the spaces looked odd. I took a picture, to help me remember, but I couldn’t read the digit. I still can’t. I look at the picture and see nothing more than a blur. Of course, I’ll sort it out. It shouldn’t be too much trouble.

Still.

I walked into the terminal, right, and no one was here. Not a soul. The screens were on. I can see all the departure times. The delayed flights. On time. Early. It’s all there. I’ve just got my carry-on, so don’t have any luggage to check. Which is nice. Faster, you know? One less line. Well. There isn’t a line, though. There’s no one at all. And I suppose I couldn’t check any luggage anyway, right? There’s no one to take it, weigh it, snap a tag on it and bag it.

Odd.

But it was nice to speed right through security. I didn’t even have to remove my shoes or belt or laptop or food or empty my pockets. I even snuck my full water bottle through. I have to admit, it gave me a little thrill. I just walked right through the body scanner without even stopping. Can you imagine that? If someone was watching the cameras they must have been so irritated. But no one came out to stop me.

And do you know what I did when I got through security?

I stopped by the Airline Cafe and grabbed a pre-made, wrapped bagel sandwich. No one was there! Not a soul. Another jolt of excitement. Is it really shoplifting if no one’s around to collect my money? But don’t worry, I wasn’t greedy. I could have stuffed my bag full of pre-made sandwiches but only grabbed the one. I think that’s fair, right? I’ll leave the rest for others to grab. There will be others, right? There have to be passengers on my plane besides me. And the pilots. And flight attendants.

Not a soul.

My steps echoed across the tiles as I walked to my gate. All the lights are on. The shops are stocked. I even saw one of those rolling trash cans sitting outside one of the restrooms. Maybe I should go in? Surely the janitor’s around today.

I could hear someone humming. 

There I was. Standing outside the bathroom. And I could hear a reverberant sing-songy tune. A man…I think. A gruff voice.

*Dum dum dum dum dummmmm. Dum dum da dum dummmmm.*

Over and over.

What could he be doing?

Goosebumps on my neck.

I should leave. Yes, I don’t think I should go in there right now. There shouldn’t be anyone here, right? Why is someone here?

I rushed away. Walking to my gate. Head down. Moving along.

Someone else’s steps.

Humming.

Behind me.

Why? Why would he be following me? Should I be scared? No, no, of course not. This is the airport. There are always crowds. He’s just going to his gate and it happens to be in the same direction as mine. Even so, it made me nervous. I stopped. Turned around. Saw him.

And…he was just a regular looking man. Middle-aged. A little overweight. Receding hairline. Glasses. A Patagonia quarter-zip and chinos. He stopped humming. Smiled at me. And then started running. Running towards me with his arms outstretched, smile still splattered across his face. I dropped my bag. Ran. Ran. Ran past my gate.

I found a place to hide. A maintenance hall. But I can hear him. Walking around. Humming while I type this. What should I do? Should I go back out? Confront him? I’m going to miss my flight if I stay here. And I can’t miss it. It’s the only way I can get home. 

Can someone please help me? Please. Just come down to the airport. I need a little help. No one else is here and I really need to go home. 

All I want is to go home.
