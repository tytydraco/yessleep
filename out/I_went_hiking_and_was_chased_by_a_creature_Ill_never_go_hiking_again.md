I was always an adventurous person, always seeking out new challenges and experiences. When I went on vacation in a small town (I can't remember the name right now) in northern US, I knew I had to go for a hike somewhere nearby. The next day I packed my bags and set off early in the morning, excited to explore what to me was a completely unknown place.

As the day went on, I marveled at the beauty of the forest. The sun filtered through the trees, casting a warm glow over the landscape. I took in a deep breath of the fresh, clean air and smiled to myself. This was exactly what I needed - a chance to escape the stresses of everyday life and connect with nature.

But as the sun began to set, I started to feel a sense of unease wash over me. The forest seemed to grow darker and more foreboding as the light faded. I told myself it was just my imagination, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.

I quickened my pace, trying to get back to the safety of my car as soon as possible. That's when I saw it.

At first, I thought it was just a tree. It was tall and thin, with bark that looked almost like skin. But as I got closer, I realized that it wasn't a tree at all. It was a creature, a monster.

Its skin was a dull grey color, and its eyes glowed a bright white. It seemed to be staring right at me, and I froze in fear. I knew I had to do something, but I couldn't move.

Suddenly, the creature moved. It wasn't a tree after all - it had been posing as one, waiting for its chance to strike. It lunged towards me, and I finally found the strength to run.

I raced through the woods, not daring to look back. I could hear the creature's footsteps behind me, getting closer and closer. I knew I couldn't outrun it forever.

As I ran, I couldn't help but wonder how this creature had come to be. Was it some sort of mutated animal, or was it something more sinister? Whatever it was, I knew I had to escape it.

I scanned the area, looking for anything I could use to my advantage. My eyes landed on a group of rocks off to the side of the path. I veered off the trail and made a beeline for the rocks, hoping to use them as cover. As I darted behind them, I heard the creature let out a guttural growl. It had lost sight of me, at least for the moment.

I took the opportunity to catch my breath and assess my situation. I was lost in the woods, being hunted by a monster that I didn't understand. My phone had no reception, so I couldn't call for help. I was completely alone.

But I couldn't give up. I had to find a way to escape.

I peeked out from behind the rocks, trying to get a sense of where the creature was. I saw a flash of movement off to the side, and I knew it was still searching for me.

I had to make a decision. I could stay where I was and hope for the best, or I could try to outrun the creature and make a break for it.

I decided to go for it. I burst out from behind the rocks and sprinted down the path, not looking back. I could hear the creature's footsteps behind me, but I didn't dare turn around.

I ran as fast as I could, my feet pounding the ground. I could see the glimmer of my car in the distance, and I knew I was almost there.

But as I reached for the door handle, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned to see the creature standing behind me, its white eyes glowing in the darkness.

I closed my eyes, expecting the worst. I waited for a couple of seconds, panicking, immobilized by fear, when i opened my eyes: the creature was gone. It had completely vanished.

I never went hiking in the woods alone again. The memory of that night still haunts me to this day. I decide to tell this story because it was a burden I wanted to get rid of for a long time, and to remind people that even in the beauty of nature, there can be dangers lurking in the shadows. The creature may have somehow been a product of my imagination or some kind of hallucination, but the fear it instilled in me was very real.
