Growing up, I was always proud that my great-grandfather had survived the Titanic. The story was simple: he was 12 years old, boarded with his family, got on a lifeboat, and lived.

But he never talked about it. Not to my dad. Not to reporters. Not to anyone.

He finally told me the truth three weeks before he died. He made me lock the door, turn off the lights, and swear I’d never tell a soul.

Well, sorry, Grandpa. I’ve kept it long enough. And after what I’ve started seeing in my dreams, I don’t care anymore.

He said the first few days on the Titanic were fine. Cold, but fine. The food was good. People were laughing. He was just a 12-year-old boy in awe of the biggest ship in the world.

Then came the fourth night.

He remembered standing on the deck with his parents, looking up at the sky. The moon was huge. Too huge. Everyone else was pointing at it, laughing, saying it was "just perspective."

But then it started to turn red.

Not just reddish — **blood** red. It pulsed, like it had veins. And then… it grew a face.

Not a human face. Something else. The mouth was stretched wide open, like it was screaming — except there was no sound. Just the wind.

That’s when people began to scream. And then bite.

A woman tore her husband’s ear off with her teeth. A child picked up a shard of glass and slit his nanny’s throat. The screams multiplied. Blood pooled on the polished floors. Some people laughed while they did it — others cried. But most just stared at the sky, whispering in unison.

**“It’s awake. It’s hungry.”**

One of the crew members — Grandpa didn’t remember his name, just that he was young and had a nervous twitch — **didn’t go insane.** He had a pistol. Only six shots.

He shot the first attacker clean through the head. Then another. But they kept coming. Their eyes were black. Skin pale and stretched. He fought like hell. Killed fifteen people that night. Maybe more.

Then they **tore him apart**. Grandpa said they didn’t eat him right away. They dragged him down into the cargo hold, like they were offering him to something.

In the chaos, a few of the remaining sane crew scrambled to get the lifeboats down. One man shouted for Grandpa to run. He grabbed a coat that wasn’t his and **jumped**.

He made it. Barely.

Only a handful of sane people made it onto that boat. Two women. An old cook. A teenage boy missing three fingers. The man who helped him in was bleeding from his throat, holding his neck shut with a rag.

They didn’t steer for open water.

They steered toward an iceberg.

Grandpa asked why, and the cook replied:“We crash. Hard. We take ‘em down with us.”

He didn’t understand at first. But then he looked back — and saw **other lifeboats filled with the insane.** Screaming. Laughing. Tearing into each other like meat.

They were trying to **follow.**

So the man at the helm **crashed them into the ice**.

Deliberately.

Suicide.

They all died — **except Grandpa**, who had jumped out at the last second, landing hard in the freezing water.

He clung to the edge of the ice for hours. Hypothermic. Bleeding. Too tired to scream.

He said when the rescue ship found him, he was the **only one still breathing.**

Then came the cover-up.

They told the world it was an iceberg. That was easier. They told survivors not to speak, and most didn’t. Some disappeared. Others were paid off.

Grandpa never got paid. He never even got a thank-you.

Only **nightmares**. For decades.

He said the face in the moon still showed up sometimes. Not in the sky anymore. In his dreams. In **mirrors**. In puddles.

“It’s not dead,” he told me. “We just fed it enough to sleep again.”

He died three weeks later.

I didn’t believe him. Until last night.

I was on a walk. Looked up at the sky.

The moon?

Red.

Smiling.
