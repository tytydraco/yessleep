One day, I woke up unable to feel my body. Having previous anxieties about the sensation in my left arm being ever so slightly worse than that in my right, I had assumed one simple thing: stroke. I am a college student living away from my parents, so I took ambulance to the hospital, immediately being admitted into ER. 

Some kind of central nerve injury, the doctors said. This could be fixed with reconstructive surgery in the worst case scenario and treatment at best, even if a sudden onset like this is a cause for concern. They stuck needles into my back, drawing samples of my spinal fluid from between the vertebrae. At least I wasn’t able to feel the pain. 

I need you to understand something: it’s not just that I can’t feel pain or touch or the temperature. I literally don’t know where my limbs are. I don’t know if I am sitting or standing. I can’t even feel my heart beating. 

The next one was a lot more subtle. After having two coffees the next morning, I found them flavorless and grey; my meal was the same. Hospital food, I thought. Even if I somehow knew that my taste was gone, I wasn’t really bothered. Taste is one of those senses I consider to be an acceptable loss—just like smell. 

Speaking of smell: that was the thing to go next. I hadn’t noticed how sterile the hospital actually was until my nostrils stopped being harassed by the sweet, pungent chemicals. I wanted to panic, but couldn’t bring myself to do it. All my life, I’ve been told to trust the doctors. No matter how much I cried as a child getting my allergy shots, I still went through with it. 

The staff told me that they still hadn’t found any potential causes of my complete body anesthesia. They will run an electrodiagnosis tomorrow—maybe even an CT scan if they suspect that the X-ray missed something. I politely mentioned that I had lost my smell. The doctor just nodded. 

When I woke up deaf, the panic really began to settle in. I was supposed to call my parents yesterday. I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I guess I just didn’t have the desire to do anything, really. Even watching videos or movies feels like a chore. Now, I will never hear them again. They told me that they are coming to visit me (I live abroad), but the latest that they’ll be able to leave is by next Monday. 

My entire Sunday thus far had just been one huge coping mechanism. I have read articles about people who lost both sight and hearing, yet were still able to communicate through touch. Some of them even lived fulfilling lives. The thing is: I don’t have touch. Taste alone—extraneous as it is—would have allowed me to perceive the outside world. Hell, I could even form some kind of morse code with the 5 flavors. You can’t associate darkness with anything. 

Maybe I am just seeing patterns. Humans are really good at that, right? Senses themselves aren’t like real things, just ways to quantify impulses going to our brain into neat a neat group of 5. 

I just so happen to have lost all of them—one by one—in the days leading up to today. So what? Tomorrow, I will wake up with the old injuries and start working on them. I can afford private healthcare. I expect to be given the best treatment available. 

But what if I don’t?

All I have is my eyesight now. I am typing this out clumsily, unable to feel my fingers making contact with the glass which I am assuming is cold.

I am going to fall asleep soon. No matter how much caffeine or stimulants I pump into myself, there will be times when I will just have to drift away. Either that or a heart attack. 

If they hook me to IV, I will be a vegetable capable of moving and making sounds, yet living in my own little bubble. Maybe they will euthanize me. I don’t know. That’s the worst part of it all. 

When I die, will I even know it?
