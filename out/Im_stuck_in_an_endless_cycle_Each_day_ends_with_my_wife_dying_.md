I never thought I'd dread waking up. But here I am, eyes squeezed shut, praying that when I open them, I'll see something—anything—different.

My name is Marcus Thompson. I'm 32 years old, and I'm trapped in a nightmare I can't escape.

It started like any other day. I remember it perfectly—every goddamn detail. The smell of coffee brewing downstairs, the sound of Alisha humming in the kitchen, the warmth of sunlight streaming through our bedroom window. I sat up, stretching, and glanced at the clock: 7:15 AM. Right on schedule.

I padded downstairs, following the scent of breakfast. Alisha stood at the stove, her back to me, swaying slightly as she flipped pancakes. Her dark curls were piled high on her head, and she wore my old college t-shirt—the one with the hole in the sleeve that she refused to throw away.

"Morning, beautiful," I said, wrapping my arms around her waist and planting a kiss on her neck.

She laughed, leaning back into me. "Morning, sleepyhead. I was beginning to think you'd sleep through your alarm again."

"Not a chance," I replied, reaching around her to snag a piece of bacon from the plate on the counter. "Can't be late today. Big presentation, remember?"

Alisha swatted my hand playfully. "How could I forget? You've only been stressing about it for weeks."

We ate breakfast together, chatting about our plans for the day. Alisha had a busy schedule at the elementary school where she taught third grade. I had my presentation to the board, which could lead to a big promotion if it went well.

As I finished my coffee, Alisha glanced at her watch. "Oh! I better get going. Parent-teacher conferences this afternoon, so I need to get there early to set up."

She stood, grabbing her bag and car keys. I rose to walk her to the door, as I always did.

"Knock 'em dead today, babe," she said, stretching up on her toes to kiss me goodbye. "You're gonna do great."

"Thanks," I replied, squeezing her hand. "Have a good day. Love you."

"Love you too," she called over her shoulder as she headed for her car.

I watched her pull out of the driveway, waving as she drove away. Then I went back inside to finish getting ready for work.

The day passed in a blur of meetings and last-minute preparations. By the time my presentation rolled around at 3 PM, I was running on pure adrenaline and caffeine. But it went well—better than I'd hoped, actually. The board seemed impressed, and my boss even hinted at that promotion as we wrapped up.

I was on cloud nine as I packed up my things, ready to head home and celebrate with Alisha. I pulled out my phone to call her, wanting to share the good news right away.

That's when everything changed.

The phone rang once, twice, three times. Then a voice I didn't recognize answered.

"Hello? Is this Marcus Thompson?"

My stomach dropped. Something in the woman's tone sent ice through my veins.

"Yes, this is Marcus," I replied, my voice suddenly hoarse. "Who is this?"

"Mr. Thompson, this is Nurse Reeves from Mercy General Hospital. I'm calling about your wife, Alisha. There's been an accident."

The world tilted on its axis. I gripped the edge of my desk, knuckles turning white.

"What happened? Is she okay?"

The pause before the nurse's response lasted an eternity.

"I'm so sorry, Mr. Thompson. Your wife was brought in about an hour ago. There was a multi-car pileup on the highway. The doctors did everything they could, but... I'm afraid Alisha didn't make it. I'm so sorry for your loss."

The phone slipped from my hand, clattering to the floor. This couldn't be real. It had to be a mistake. I'd just seen Alisha this morning. We'd made plans for dinner. She was fine. She had to be fine.

The next few hours passed in a haze. Somehow, I made it to the hospital. I remember the harsh fluorescent lights, the antiseptic smell, the pitying looks from the staff. And then... seeing her. Lying there, so still, so unlike the vibrant woman I'd kissed goodbye that morning.

I don't know how long I sat there, holding her hand, willing her to wake up. To smile at me one more time. To tell me this was all a cruel joke.

But she didn't. And eventually, a gentle-voiced doctor came to take me away, to discuss arrangements I couldn't begin to comprehend.

I don't remember driving home. I don't remember climbing the stairs to our bedroom—our bed, where Alisha would never sleep again. I just remember collapsing onto the mattress, still in my suit, and praying that when I woke up, this would all be a terrible dream.

Sleep came, eventually. A blessed escape from the crushing weight of grief.

And then... I opened my eyes.

The smell of coffee drifted up from downstairs. Sunlight streamed through the bedroom window. For one blissful moment, I thought my prayer had been answered.

Then I heard it: Alisha, humming in the kitchen.

I sat bolt upright, heart pounding. The clock on the nightstand read 7:15 AM.

Impossible.

I scrambled out of bed, nearly falling in my haste to get downstairs. And there she was—Alisha, alive and well, standing at the stove in my old college t-shirt, flipping pancakes.

"Morning, sleepyhead," she said, glancing over her shoulder with a smile. "I was beginning to think you'd sleep through your alarm again."

I couldn't speak. Couldn't breathe. This wasn't possible.

"Marcus?" Alisha's smile faded, replaced by concern. "Are you okay? You look like you've seen a ghost."

I crossed the kitchen in two strides, pulling her into my arms so tightly she let out a surprised "oof."

"Whoa, what's gotten into you?" she laughed, returning the hug.

"Bad dream," I managed to choke out, burying my face in her hair, breathing in her familiar scent. "A really, really bad dream."

Alisha pulled back, cupping my face in her hands. "Well, you're awake now. And everything's fine, okay?"

I nodded, not trusting myself to speak. Because suddenly, I remembered—I'd lived this moment before. Yesterday morning. The morning Alisha died.

As we ate breakfast, my mind raced. Had it all been a dream? Some kind of stress-induced hallucination? It had felt so real, so visceral. But here was Alisha, alive and well, talking about her parent-teacher conferences as if nothing had happened.

I tried to shake off the lingering dread as Alisha gathered her things to leave. But as she reached for her car keys, panic seized me.

"Wait!" I blurted out, grabbing her wrist. "Don't... don't drive today. Please."

Alisha frowned, confused. "What? Why not?"

"I just..." I scrambled for an explanation that wouldn't make me sound insane. "I have a bad feeling. Can you carpool with someone? Or I could drive you?"

"Marcus, I can't just change my plans at the last minute. I need my car for errands after work, remember?" She studied my face, worry creasing her brow. "Are you sure you're okay? That must have been some nightmare."

I forced a smile, trying to appear calm. "Yeah, sorry. I'm fine. Just... be careful, okay? I love you."

"I love you too," she replied, still looking concerned. "Try not to stress too much about your presentation. You're going to do great."

And then she was gone, just like before. I watched her pull out of the driveway, my heart in my throat.

I spent the morning in a state of high anxiety, jumping every time my phone rang. But as the hours ticked by with no bad news, I started to relax. Maybe it really had just been a nightmare.

My presentation went well, just as it had in my... dream? Memory? I wasn't sure what to call it anymore. As I packed up my things afterward, I decided to call Alisha, just to put my mind at ease.

The phone rang once, twice, three times.

"Hello? Is this Marcus Thompson?"

Ice flooded my veins. The same voice. The same words.

"Mr. Thompson, this is Nurse Reeves from Mercy General Hospital. I'm calling about your wife, Alisha. There's been an accident."

No. No, no, no. This couldn't be happening. Not again.

"What happened?" I demanded, even though I already knew the answer.

"I'm so sorry, Mr. Thompson. Your wife was brought in about an hour ago. There was an incident at the school where she works. A student's parent became violent, and... I'm afraid Alisha didn't make it. I'm so sorry for your loss."

The phone slipped from my numb fingers. This wasn't real. It couldn't be real.

But as I raced to the hospital, as I saw Alisha's still form once again, as I held her lifeless hand... I knew it was all too real.

And I knew, with a certainty that chilled me to my core, that when I woke up tomorrow, it would all begin again.

I don't know how many times I've lived this day now. Ten? Fifty? A hundred? They've all blurred together in a nightmarish haze of grief and desperation.

Each morning, I wake up at 7:15 AM. Each morning, I rush downstairs to find Alisha alive, humming in the kitchen. And each evening, no matter what I do, I receive that dreaded phone call.

I've tried everything I can think of. I've begged Alisha to stay home, faking illnesses and family emergencies. I've disconnected her car battery, slashed her tires, hidden her keys. I've called the school with bomb threats, tried to get it shut down for the day.

Nothing works. If Alisha stays home, she dies in a house fire. If she can't drive, she takes the bus—which crashes. If the school closes, she goes to run errands instead and gets caught in a store robbery gone wrong.

It's like the universe itself is conspiring to take her from me, over and over again.

Today, I decide to try a different approach. Instead of trying to keep Alisha home or safe, I'll stay with her. All day. Maybe if I'm there, I can protect her.

When she leaves for work, I follow in my car. She notices, of course, pulling over after a few blocks.

"Marcus, what are you doing?" she asks as I approach her window, her voice a mix of confusion and concern.

"I just... I need to be with you today," I say, knowing how crazy I must sound. "Please, Alisha. Trust me. It's important."

She studies my face for a long moment, then sighs. "Okay. Get in. But you're explaining on the way."

As we drive, I try to tell her the truth. About the time loop, about her dying every day, about my desperate attempts to save her. Alisha listens silently, her knuckles white on the steering wheel.

Finally, she speaks. "Marcus... I think you need help. This isn't normal. Maybe we should go to the hospital instead of work."

"No!" I shout, making her jump. "No hospitals. Please, Alisha. Just... let me stay with you today. If nothing happens, I promise I'll get help tomorrow."

She agrees, reluctantly. We spend the day together at her school. I hover anxiously, scanning for threats, jumping at every sudden noise. Alisha's colleagues give us odd looks, but she makes excuses about a family situation.

As the final bell rings, I begin to hope. Maybe this time, it worked. Maybe I've finally broken the cycle.

We're walking to her car when I hear the screech of tires. I turn to see a car careening towards us, the driver slumped over the wheel.

Time slows. I reach for Alisha, trying to push her out of the way. But I'm too slow. Always too slow.

The impact throws us both. I hit the ground hard, my vision blurring. When it clears, I see Alisha lying motionless a few feet away, a growing pool of blood beneath her.

"No," I whisper, crawling towards her. "No, no, no. Not again. Please, not again."

But it's too late. By the time the ambulance arrives, Alisha is gone. And I'm left once more with the certainty that tomorrow, it will all begin again.

The next morning, I don't get out of bed. What's the point? Nothing I do makes a difference. Alisha always dies, and I'm always left alone with my grief.

I hear her calling from downstairs, concern in her voice. But I can't face her. Can't watch her die again.

Eventually, she comes up to check on me. "Marcus? Are you okay?"

I roll over, burying my face in the pillow. "Go away, Alisha. Please."

The bed dips as she sits beside me, her hand gentle on my back. "What's wrong? Talk to me."

"You wouldn't believe me if I told you," I mutter.

"Try me," she says softly.

So I do. I tell her everything, my voice muffled by the pillow. About the time loop, about watching her die over and over, about my failed attempts to save her.

When I finish, silence stretches between us. Then Alisha speaks, her voice trembling slightly. "I don't understand what's happening, Marcus. But I believe that you believe it. And I'm here. Whatever this is, we'll face it together."

I roll over, meeting her eyes. The love and concern I see there breaks something inside me. I pull her into my arms, holding her tight as sobs wrack my body.

We spend the day at home, talking, crying, trying to make sense of the impossible situation. As evening approaches, I grow increasingly anxious.

"Maybe it'll be different this time," Alisha says, squeezing my hand. "Maybe staying home was the answer."

I want to believe her. But as the clock ticks towards the dreaded hour, a sense of inevitability settles over me.

At 4:17 PM, exactly when the call usually comes, there's a knock at the door instead.

Alisha moves to answer it, but I hold her back. "No. Let me."

I open the door to find two solemn-faced police officers. "Mr. Thompson?" one asks. "I'm afraid we have some bad news. There's been an accident..."

I don't hear the rest. Because behind them, on the street, I see a familiar figure. A man in a dark suit, watching us. As our eyes meet, he smiles—a cold, cruel expression that chills me to my core.

Then he turns and walks away, vanishing into thin air.

I slam the door shut, my mind reeling. Who was that? What did it mean?

But there's no time to ponder it. Because Alisha is on the floor, clutching her chest, gasping for air.

Heart attack. That's what the paramedics say when they arrive. Nothing anyone could have done.

As I watch them take Alisha's body away, that strange man's smile haunts me. For the first time, I wonder if there's more to this nightmare than I realized.

The next morning, I wake with a new determination. If I can't save Alisha—and God, it kills me to even think that—maybe I can at least find out why this is happening.

I go through the motions of the morning, hugging Alisha extra tight before she leaves. Then I set out to find the man in the suit.

I drive around town, watching for him. Hours pass with no sign. As 4:17 approaches, I find myself near the park where Alisha and I had our first date.

And there he is, sitting on a bench, feeding pigeons.

I approach cautiously, my heart pounding. "Who are you?" I demand. "Why are you doing this to me?"

He looks up, that same cold smile on his face. "Ah, Marcus. I was wondering when you'd find me."

"You know my name?"

He chuckles. "I know everything about you, Marcus. And about Alisha."

A chill runs down my spine. "Are you... are you God? The Devil?"

The man's laughter rings out, harsh and mocking. "Nothing so grand, I'm afraid. Think of me as... an interested observer."

"Observer of what?" I ask, my fists clenching at my sides.

He stands, brushing breadcrumbs from his suit. "Of you, Marcus. Of your pain, your grief, your desperation. It's all quite fascinating, really."

Rage boils up inside me. I lunge at him, intent on wiping that smug smile off his face. But my hands pass right through him, as if he's made of smoke.

"Now, now," he tuts. "None of that. We're just getting to know each other."

"Why?" I scream, drawing startled looks from passersby. "Why are you doing this?"

The man's smile fades, replaced by a look of cold curiosity. "Because I can. Because your suffering amuses me. Because I want to see how long it takes to break you completely."

His words hit me like a physical blow. I stagger back, shaking my head in denial. "No. No, this can't be real. You can't be real."

"Oh, I'm very real, Marcus," he says, stepping closer. "And this is very, very real. For you, at least."

My phone rings. 4:17 PM. I already know what I'll hear when I answer.

The man in the suit watches me, his head tilted in interest. "Well? Aren't you going to get that? I'm sure it's important news about dear Alisha."

I want to run. To scream. To wake up from this nightmare. But I'm rooted to the spot, trapped in this moment of horror.

As I raise the phone to my ear, the man in the suit begins to fade away. But his parting words echo in my mind long after he's gone:

"Sweet dreams, Marcus. I'll see you tomorrow. And the next day. And the next..."

The revelation of the man in the suit haunts me. Each day, as I wake to the same morning routine, I'm torn between my desperate need to save Alisha and my burning desire to understand—to defeat—this cruel entity that's toying with our lives.

Today, I decide to ignore him completely. I focus all my energy on Alisha, determined to find some way, any way, to break this cycle.

"Let's run away," I blurt out over breakfast.

Alisha pauses, fork halfway to her mouth. "What?"

"Let's just... go. Right now. Get in the car and drive until we can't drive anymore."

She studies my face, concern etching lines around her eyes. "Marcus, what's going on? You've been acting strange for days now."

I take her hand, willing her to understand. "Please, Alisha. Trust me. We need to leave. Now."

Maybe it's the desperation in my voice, or maybe it's the love that's carried us through seven years of marriage. Whatever the reason, Alisha nods. "Okay. Let's go."

We throw some clothes in a bag and hit the road. As we drive out of town, I keep glancing in the rearview mirror, half-expecting to see the man in the suit following us. But the highway behind us remains clear.

For the first time in what feels like an eternity, I begin to hope. We drive for hours, putting miles between us and the town where Alisha has died a hundred deaths. We laugh, we sing along to the radio, we reminisce about old road trips.

As the sun begins to set, we pull into a small coastal town. "Let's stay here tonight," Alisha suggests, pointing to a quaint bed and breakfast.

I check my watch. 6:43 PM. We've made it past 4:17. Past the time Alisha always dies.

"We did it," I whisper, tears pricking my eyes. "We really did it."

Alisha squeezes my hand. "Did what, babe?"

Before I can answer, a commotion down the street catches our attention. A crowd is gathering, pointing at something in the sky.

"Is that a plane?" someone shouts. "It's flying awfully low."

My blood runs cold. No. It can't be.

The roar of engines fills the air. I grab Alisha, trying to pull her to safety, but it's too late. The plane crashes into the bed and breakfast in a deafening explosion of fire and debris.

In the chaos that follows—the screaming, the sirens, the frantic attempts at rescue—I search desperately for Alisha. But deep down, I already know.

As I stand there, watching firefighters battle the blaze, I feel a presence beside me.

"Did you really think it would be that easy?" the man in the suit asks, his tone conversational. "That you could outrun fate?"

I don't look at him. Can't look at him. "Why?" I choke out. "Why her? Why us?"

He shrugs, the movement visible from the corner of my eye. "Why not? Your pain is... exquisite. Your love, your desperation, your growing madness—it's all so deliciously human."

"I'll stop you," I growl. "Somehow, I'll find a way."

His laughter is like broken glass. "Oh, Marcus. I do hope you try. It'll make this game so much more interesting."

I wake the next morning with a new plan forming. If I can't save Alisha by changing her fate, maybe I can save her by changing mine.

I go through the motions of our morning routine one last time, savoring every moment with her. As she leaves for work, I kiss her deeply.

"I love you," I say. "Always remember that."

She smiles, a little puzzled. "I love you too. Are you sure you're okay?"

I nod, forcing a smile. "I'm fine. Have a great day, babe."

As soon as she's gone, I start gathering supplies. Rope. A chair. A notepad.

I write Alisha a letter, pouring out everything—the time loop, the deaths, the man in the suit. I tell her how much I love her, how sorry I am that I couldn't save her. I beg her to live a full, happy life.

Then I prepare the noose.

Just before 4:17, I position myself on the chair. My plan is simple: if I die first, maybe the loop will break. Maybe Alisha will live.

As I stand there, heart pounding, the man in the suit appears.

"My, my," he says, looking around at my preparations. "This is certainly a new approach."

"Go to hell," I spit.

He smiles, cold and cruel. "You first."

I take a deep breath, close my eyes, and step off the chair.

The rope pulls tight—

And I wake up gasping, back in bed. 7:15 AM. Another failed attempt.

But something's different this time. There's no smell of coffee, no sound of Alisha humming downstairs.

I rush to the kitchen, my heart in my throat. It's empty. Cold.

"Alisha?" I call out, panic rising. "Alisha, where are you?"

"She's not here, Marcus," a familiar voice says behind me.

I whirl to find the man in the suit lounging in our armchair, looking utterly at ease.

"What did you do?" I demand. "Where is she?"

He examines his nails, the picture of casual indifference. "I didn't do anything. You did."

"What are you talking about?"

He sighs, as if explaining to a particularly slow child. "You changed the rules, Marcus. You died first. So now... she never existed."

The world spins around me. I grab the counter to keep from falling. "No," I whisper. "No, bring her back. Please."

"I can't bring back someone who was never born," he says, standing. "But don't worry. I'm sure we can find new ways to continue our little game."

As the truth of what I've done sinks in, I slide to the floor, a scream of anguish tearing from my throat. The man in the suit watches, a small, satisfied smile on his face.

"Well," he says, straightening his jacket. "Shall we begin again?"

The world fades to black, and I brace myself for whatever fresh hell awaits. Because now I know the truth: there's no escape. No way to win. Just an eternity of loss, pain, and the cruel smile of the man in the suit.

But as consciousness returns, something feels... off. The bed beneath me is harder than usual. The air smells different—antiseptic, sterile.

I open my eyes to find myself in a hospital room. Machines beep steadily around me. And there, holding my hand, her eyes red-rimmed from crying, is Alisha.

"Oh my God," she breathes. "Marcus? Can you hear me?"

I try to speak, but my throat is dry, raw. Alisha quickly holds a cup of water to my lips.

"W-what happened?" I manage to croak out.

Alisha's eyes fill with fresh tears. "You've been in a coma, baby. For three months. There was an accident on your way to work... the doctors weren't sure you'd ever wake up."

My mind reels. A coma? Was it all a dream? The time loop, the deaths, the man in the suit?

As if summoned by my thoughts, I see a flicker of movement by the door. The man in the suit stands there, watching. But this time, his smile doesn't seem cruel. It's almost... approving.

He nods once, then vanishes.

"Marcus?" Alisha's voice pulls me back. "Are you okay? Should I call the doctor?"

I look at her—really look at her. My beautiful, vibrant, alive wife. Whatever happened, whatever was real or not real, none of it matters now.

"I'm okay," I say, squeezing her hand. "Everything's okay now."

As Alisha calls for the doctor, I close my eyes, savoring the feeling of her hand in mine. I don't know if I've won, lost, or simply been released from some cosmic game. But I do know one thing:

I'll never take a single moment with Alisha for granted again.
