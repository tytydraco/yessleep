This is a little tale from many years ago, I was still a young detective, and this was my second case. The year was 1983. 

I was to investigate a string of disappearances, but first I was to pick up another detective from a crash he was poking around at, he had been told not to go but had apparently responded by saying to the chief “Ya ya ya, how’s about you go fuck yourself” and then left. That pretty much accurately describes Detective Charles Blanch. When I got to the crash sight after driving along a rural road for about 2 hours, I stepped out of my Corolla and surveyed the scene, a 737 had crashed into a farmhouse leaving no survivors, a whole team of investigators and paramedics were already on the scene, and Detective Blanch was bent over a corpse pulling a ring off of her finger and stuffing into his pocket. I walked over to him and introduced myself.

“Hello detective, I’m Paul Steudenmaker, Detective Paul Stuednemaker”

He grunted and reached out a hand to me.

“Ya I’m Chuck.”

I nervously shook his hand, he was a big man,I was not, a few heads taller than most people and a bit on the heavier side, while I was a few inches shorter than most, this being before I grew two feet because of that curse.

“I was sent here to collect you, they want you to come with me on a case.” 

“Who wants me on the case?” He coughed in reply.

It took me a moment to process what he just said. “Our sergeant, the guy who gives us cases, who else did you think asked?”

“The goat man has been pretty active lately, I thought it could have been him” He said Scratching his graying beard that matched his slowly fading and faintly thinning hair.

“I…uh… Whatever, just get in the car, I’ll explain the case to you on the way there”

It was a long drive back to town, and all I had to talk to him about was the case at hand. 

“Sergeant told me that a few years back, eight people went missing all in one night, then, a year later, eight more people, then it only took a few months for another group of eight to disappear, and until last week, they had no leads, then they got a guy who was willing to talk about it, they held him for as long as they could, eventually he spilled and now here we are, investigating”

Detective Blanch stared at me for a moment before asking “That’s neat and all, but when are we going to get there, and where are we going actually?”

“Oh shit, that’s right. It’s a house on the corner of…” I stopped to let out a shudder “Jefferson street and Garth avenue.” 

“You good P?”

“I’m fine, I just heard ghost stories about that host when I was a kid, I was young too, and these weren’t the type of rumors you forget”.

We sat in awkward silence for about an hour until we reached the house in question. It wasn’t anything out of the ordinary, just a simple house, with peeling light blue paint and a few noticeable missing shingles. I opened my glove box to retrieve my revolver, and the Dillinger Pistol I keep as a backup. The small pistol went in my pocket, and I held my larger revolver as I opened the unlocked door.

I swept through the rooms calling out for any inhabitants. Blanch hung back to “Scope around” but I caught him eyeing up some of the more valuable objects left behind when I passed by him. Once I finished going through the whole house I found him by a bookshelf, his ear pressed firmly against the crack between it and the wall, he sniffed the air around him.

“Hey kid, come here check this out.” He whispered at me. I crept over and sure enough, the air felt a little cooler, and smelled dusty right around the shelf, and a strange ticking noise could be heard behind it. 

“What do you think it is Detective Blanch”

“Secret passage, definitely, probably something shady.”

“Ok, now what are we going to do about it?” I asked excitedly, before realizing that was unprofessional, I straightened my tie and cleared my throat.

“Start yanking on books I suppose, one of them probably opens it up.” 

Detective Blanch then proceeded to yank every book off of the shelf, and when that didn’t work, he grumbled, rubbed his forehead, took a deep breath, walked across the room, and then full sprinted at the shelf and smashed through to the other side. Behind the shelf was a long stone set of stairs, with a clock on the wall, that was clearly making the ticking noise. I walked down the set of stairs and found Blanch holding his leg and groaning, he let go rubbed his arm a bit and stretched his back.

“Rough landing huh?” I taunted smugly

“Shut up ass face.” He grumbled. “I got through the shelf for you. Now be grateful.”

I walked past him into the room. It was about 40ft by 60 feet, with a rectangular pit that was about 30ft by 50ft, and was 9ft deep with a metal cage around it extending up to the ceiling.  The room was all concrete, but the pit had a cobbled wall, and a tan floor, and it wasn’t by a series of naked bulbs both inside and outside the cage pit, seemingly turned on by our presence. There was a door on the cage and a nearby ladder. I opened the unlocked door and put the ladder down into it so me and Blanch could climb down safely. The bit had piles of sandbags, random walls around it, and the floor was covered in sawdust. There was a grate in the middle, where a disgusting smell emanated from, and the blood on the sawdust was hard to ignore, I walked a few feet before kicking something sharp. I pushed the sawdust aside to find a bloody knife, it had dried, and the blood had corroded the blade. I felt along the walls until I found an odd stone, it was a different material than the rest and it stuck outward. I pushed on it and a door swung open next to me from the wall, and Blanch Found something similar on the opposite side.

“Which way do we go first Blanch?” I asked already peeking my head into the passageway on my side, it was only about 4’ tall, and 3’ wide, barely enough room for a person to get through.

“You seem pretty gung-ho to head in that way, I guess I’ll follow you Paul.”

I took a deep and ducked down and clambered  in through the hole. I stepped out, into another room, larger than the one that held the pit. I turned on my flashlight and looked around, there was another cage in here, this one about 20’ long, and 10’ wide, pressed up against the wall.

“This is fucked up.” I found myself whispering.

“What are you whispering for Paul? It’s not like there’s anyone down here that’s gonna jump out at us and try to kill us.” Blanch stated matter of factly, right before three knife wielding men ran at us from the shadows.One jumped on top of Blanch and they started wrestling on the ground.. I was able to kill a different man with my revolver, but another smacked it out of my hand. I reached for my Dillenger, but this guy was quick and grabbed my hand and we fought over the pistol for a good minute before he was able to pull the trigger and blow off my right ring finger, the pain gave me the adrenaline to take the gun, throw the man to the ground and paint the floor with his brains. I shot the man who was on top of Blanch without a second thought and walked.

“Are you ok Blanch?” I asked trying to scrounge around for my missing finger.

“I’m in less pieces than you, so I’m going to guess that I am.” Blanch replied breathlessly. “Jeez, I think I need to do more cardio, and maybe stop smoking Four packs a day.”

“Ya ya, that’s great Blanch, BUT WHERE THE FUCK IS MY FINGER!?” I screamed crawling around on the ground.

“Jeez Paul, it’s right over there. No need to get so worked up about it.” Detective Blanch picked it up and handed it to me. The finger was messed up, half of it was gone, and it looked like it had been stepped on, there was no way I was getting it reattached.

“Let’s just go Blanch, I hate it here, we can get more cops to search the place in depth.” I sighed, stepping towards the doorway out, but I stopped. There were four people, one woman, two men, and a large hulking beast of a person I couldn’t really determine. They were all wearing identical white shirts, and Blue jeans, with burlap sacs over their heads, and worst of all, the woman and two men had guns, they looked like bolt action hunting rifles. The large person had no gun, it didn’t seem like any gun would be big enough for it to hold, it was about 7 feet tall by my best guess, and arms thicker than my head.

I tapped Detective blanch on the shoulder and mouthed a quick warning to him. I slowly tiptoed away, from the doorway. There was another door, wooden and old, which I opened cautiously, but I creaked and groaned loudly, which alerted the people nearby. I started booking it thorugh the passageway, and Blanch followed closely behind, breathing heavily. It was long, narrow, and dark, only illuminated with naked bulbs like the pit room, except these were sparser.

I heard a gunshot and fell to the ground, I saw a large hole in my left side, and a chunk of rib on the ground, I pulled my revolver out, and fired wildly at the approaching group, killing the woman, and one of the men. Blanch started dragging me away. The other man returned fire. The large thing became restless and charged towards us, smashing the remaining man’s head against the wall of the tunnel to get past. Blanch started dragging me with all his might, and I blacked out. 

I came too in a hospital room, I looked at my right hand, and saw it covered in bandages, along with the left side of me, where I had been shot. Blanch had his arm in a sling and was sitting across from me. 

“How you doing Champ?” I smiled when I heard his voice.

“Fan-fucking-tastic, how long have I been out?” I murmured weakly.

“About 2 days, the doctors had to remove your right pinky finger, said it got clipped by the bullet that took your ring finger, and got infected by something on the ground you must have touched.”

I took another good look at my hand, and goddamn it, he was right. I groaned.

“Well shit. Anyway, what happened to your arm, did that happen because of the big ass thing that was chasing us?”

He chuckled and nodded. “Hell ya I did, I fought that thing with all my might and it ran away.”

I smiled and let my head hit the pillow. I stayed in the hospital for a few weeks. I got two fake fingers attached to my hand, they were ok, they didn’t work quite as well as my real fingers, but I eventually replaced them with better ones. 

When I walked out of that hospital, Blanch picked me up, and drove me home, I had a new outlook on life. It was that life is horrible, people are going to hurt you, and you need to be faster and smarter than them.
