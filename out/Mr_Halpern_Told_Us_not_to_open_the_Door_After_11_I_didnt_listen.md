When I opened the door after 11, I expected a teacher yelling. Not a barefoot boy with a trembling smile telling me... "it’s already inside.”

It started like any other day. Paul, Chris and I went to school together as usual. We were in 10th grade at the time, and we were childhood friends. So we knew everything about each other.

The second we stepped inside, the energy was off. Everyone was buzzing. Laughing, whispering.

We saw the sign on the board outside our classroom:

**STILLGROVE TRIP – THREE DAYS – PACK WHITE CLOTHES**

The principal and our Math teacher, Mr. Halpern, grinned as he announced it to us.

“Good ol’ Stillgrove,” he said. “You blink, and you miss the whole town."

"Our class" he continued, "because of that stupid science contest we won last year, has been gifted a three-day vacation in a Stillgrove hotel. All expenses paid. You leave tomorrow morning.”

I won’t lie, I was thrilled. Paul was already calculating how many snacks he could bring. Chris and his girlfriend Mia couldn't stop talking about it. Stillgrove… We’d barely heard of it. Just a smudge on a map. But that made it better, somehow. More mysterious.

Sometimes mystery beats knowing.

"Tomorrow, you all wear festive white and get straight on the bus!" Mr. Halpern continued "We'll all have fun. You will not forget it"

He was right. I'll never forget that trip.

The next morning, we heard the wheels of the bus pulling up in front of the school, hissing to a stop. The bus driver waited, silent, as we boarded.

We threw our bags into the trunk. Phones in our pockets. Snacks in hand. Paul brought ten different kinds, of course.

He sat next to me, holding that weird peach soda he’s been obsessed with since we were nine. And Chris sat with Mia. Laughing and enjoying every moment.

"Still think it tastes like radioactive syrup," I said.  
He just smiled. "Yeah, well, worth it."

There were supposed to be at least three teachers on this trip. There were two.

Mrs. Bell sat at the front, half asleep behind sunglasses. And Mr. Halpern? He didn’t sit. He stood

Almost the whole ride, he stood.

After about an hour and a half, he finally turned around.

“Students,” he said. “Look sharp. We’ve arrived… in Stillgrove.”

I pressed my face to the window. It was… beautiful.

The trees.

The colors.

The birds.

Stunning.

But as we passed the town’s sign—**WELCOME TO STILLGROVE**—something twisted in my stomach.

It looked old-older than it should’ve been. The paint was chipped, and one of the letters was hanging loose.

Then I saw him.

An old man, standing perfectly still on the sidewalk just before the square. Dressed head to toe in black. Heavy coat. No hat. Not moving... just standing perfectly still with his back to us.

As we passed, he lifted one hand slowly and pointed at our bus. Not waving. Just pointing.

Then he mouthed words I couldn’t quite catch.

I blinked. When I looked again, he was gone.

I looked around, but no one else reacted. Even the bus driver didn’t seem to notice.

I turned back toward Chris and Mia.

I saw Mia quietly resting her head on Chris's shoulder. He didn't say anything, just placed his hand on hers and kept looking out the window.

I’d never seen them that still before. It felt... soft. And somehow, too soft for this place.

The doors wheezed open. We stepped out onto Stillgrove.

The hotel **"The Halcyon Hollow"** as the crooked wooden sign read, was waiting for us at the end of the street. From the outside, it looked… normal. Big. Rectangular. Rows of windows, all sealed shut. Not a single curtain moved.

Inside, the air changed. the lobby smelled faintly of dust and something sweet, like rotten fruit. One man stood behind the reception desk. He wore a red suit and a matching hat. His beard was long, snow white, and neatly combed. He smiled... wide. Too wide.

Something about him felt wrong. Not dangerous. Just... off.

Mr. Halpern spoke to him quietly, eyes lowered. Like they knew each other.

"There will be two students in each room,” he told us afterward. “No less. No more."

Paul and I exchanged a look. Of course we’d room together.

"And one more thing" Mr. Halpern said. His voice was calm, but strict. "After 11 p.m, no phones. No noise. No leaving the hotel and Do Not open the Door!"

Paul leaned over and whispered, “Why’s it called The Halcyon Hollow anyway? Sounds like a funeral home.”  
I didn’t answer. I was too busy trying to ignore the smell in the air. That sweet, rotting scent again.

We all nodded.

Room 35 was small but decent. Two beds, one bathroom, a large window overlooking the woods.  
Chris and Mia were next door in room 37.

Mia was brushing her hair, humming a soft tune. I remember the way she talked about her little brother once, how she used to sneak out at night to watch the stars with him. She said those nights were the only time she felt truly free. It seemed like a lifetime ago.

Paul tossed his backpack. He frowned.

“Is it just me,” he muttered, “or does this bed look like someone already slept in it?"

I looked. The pillow was slightly dented. The sheet creased at the edge. "Already with the paranoid thoughts?” I teased. He didn’t answer. Just yawned.

“It’s late. I’m dead tired,” he said.

"Same."

At 11:30 p.m, we turned off the lights and lay our heads on the pillows.

**That's when, the nightmare began**.

Around 3 a.m., I opened my eyes. Something felt... wrong. Paul was snoring softly. The room was quiet. Too quiet. Then I noticed the curtains moving slightly. Not from wind. From light.

I sat up and looked outside.

**He was there**.

The receptionist. the one with the red suit and the too-wide smile, was standing on a small hill outside our window.

My heart thumped. He was standing still — his red suit catching the moonlight, too sharp, too precise.

Then.

**Knock knock**

I whipped my head around. The door. No one else moved. Dead silence.  
"Paul?" I whispered. Still asleep.  
Heart racing, I stood and crept to the door. Slowly, I opened it..

Someone was standing in the hallway. Not the man in red. A boy.

He stood with his back to me. His head lowered, arms limp at his sides. He was barefoot. My mouth was dry.

"Hey…" I whispered.

No answer. Then he turned his head just slightly. Not all the way. Just enough for me to see **a wide, trembling smile** forming on his cheek.

"You saw him, didn’t you," he whispered. “Now he’s inside. Good luck."

I was shaking with fear, unable to explain what I experienced. After a few seconds, I gathered my courage and closed the door.

Scared, I went back to the window and the man... was gone.

Chilled, I went back to bed.

8a.m. Paul woke me up "I slept like a baby" He said and stretched. "Yeah... me too."

I didn't talk about it, not even with Paul. I would sound crazy. But I knew... that what I saw... was not a strange dream. It was real. But something told me I wouldn't be able to keep it to myself for long. Not in stillgrove.

Mr. Halpern told everyone to come to breakfast, at the hotel restaurant. Paul, Chris, Mia and I walked together. Everyone was talking, but I was silent. As we sat at the table, I noticed that Mia was combing her hair for too long.

Chris noticed it too, and whispered something to her. She stopped. I looked at Chris's eyes and... he looked tired. "Chris, did you sleep well?" and he said in a deep voice "Why won't I sleep well?"

He was lying. It was obvious. But I didn't say a word about it.

As we finished breakfast, Mr. Halpern stood at the front of the restaurant and clapped his hands once. Hard.

"Today, each pair will get a paper map of the area. You're free to explore the town. Respectfully, you'll be back by 6pm for dinner."

Some students applauded, most did not. I saw smiles, but almost all of them... were forced.

When Paul and I headed out, I asked him if he’d noticed anything weird. He shrugged. "I mean, Mia was brushing her hair for like, 25 minutes straight" he said, jokingly.

We walked down one of the narrow alleys behind the hotel. The sun was out. And yet, everything felt grey. Like the color had been sucked out of the place.

I carved into one of the wooden fence posts at the alley’s end, barely visible under a layer of grime. Then I saw it.

**“He smiles to enter.”**

“What?” Paul said behind me.

I pointed at the carving. But when he leaned in to look, the words were gone.

"Never mind. Looks like there's a large shopping mall on the map. Want to check out what's there?"

Paul smiled, "Yeah, but you know, you pay. You owe me since third grade" and I laughed.

It didn’t seem far. at least according to the map. Or so I thought... because the map was wrong. Completely. It led us to a dark, abandoned place. an alley.

No lights, no one. The smell... was of blood and dirt. The wind was sharp. It didn’t feel natural . "Let's get out of here" Paul said but... I felt the place calling me. As if it was forbidden to turn around, only to move forward. Then I noticed something from the shadows. It was moving towards us. Slowly. step by step.

I saw his face... and my body turned to ice. It was Mr. Halpern.

“Let’s get out of here,” Paul shouted.

I nodded, finally. Something in my chest tightened. We turned around to leave, retracing our steps back through the alley. That’s when we heard it.

**A soft, wet sound. Like something falling onto the ground.**

Paul stopped walking. “You heard that, right?” “Yeah,” I whispered.

We turned back slowly.

There, near the edge of the alley, just a few feet from where we’d stood moments before…

Mia's body.

It was crumpled, like someone had dropped her from above. Her limbs were bent in wrong directions. Her hair was fanned across the filthy ground, and her white clothes were stained dark red.

Paul let out a noise I’d never heard him make before. Not a scream. Just… broken breath. I staggered forward. My mind refused to accept what I was seeing.

Her face… God. It was Mia. I dropped to my knees beside her, hands shaking. Her skin was cold. And in her hand… was her phone.

The screen was on. She had been recording a voice memo. I pressed play and what I heard... shocked me.

**"Chris...? No. No. That’s not-that's not him**  
**God… it’s smiling.**  
**It’s smiling with his face** **Don't... Don- DON**'**T TRUST IT"**

I cried. So did Paul. But not for long...I raised my head. Mr. Halpern got closer to us. Shaking the earth. Paul and I ran as fast as we could. Shocked by what we saw. Each step hurt more than the last.

We were moving towards a small hill and suddenly Paul tripped and fell. I turned back... and I didn't see Mr. Halpern. I helped Paul get up. "He is not here" I said as I struggled to breath. "You sure? I dont want to..." Paul stopped his words. "Paul? Hey? Paul?!" I shouted.

But Paul didn’t answer. He just stood frozen, eyes wide and glassy.

Then, from the shadows behind us, a voice cut through the silence. low, calm, but chilling.

"**Hey there**"

I spun around, and there stood Chris.

His eyes were dark, but his smile… it wasn’t his smile. It was too wide, too still. Like something else wearing his face.

"Chris?" I whispered, barely recognizing the thing wearing his skin.

He tilted his head.

**“You think I don’t remember? I watched it too. Through your eyes. And hers. And Paul's**"

**His smile widened, unnaturally. “They always send me with the new ones. It’s easier when I’m already inside**"

He took a step forward. Paul and I stepped back, our feet crunching in the dry grass.

"Chris,” I said, my throat dry, “If this is some kind of a sick joke"

But he wasn’t listening. His eyes weren’t his. His face looked like Chris...  but the expression was wrong.

Suddenly

**THWACK!**

A blur from the left. The sound of steel cracking bone. Chris dropped like a ragdoll. Behind him stood Mr. Halpern.

His face was blank, his shirt soaked with blood, and both hands gripped a fire axe, the blade buried in what used to be Chris’s skull.

Paul screamed. I couldn’t. I was motionless.

Chris’s body jerked once, then went still.

Mr. Halpern didn’t say a word at first. He pulled the axe free in one motion, breathing hard. Then he turned to us. his expression still flat, unreadable.

“That wasn’t your friend,” he said coldly.  
“Your friend died last night. I buried what was left.”

He looked down at the twitching, headless body.

“You were talking to something wearing his skin.”

Paul stumbled back. “You're insane... You killed-”

“I saved you.” Mr. Halpern snapped.

Then he looked at me, something deep in his eyes.

Exhaustion? Regret? Fear?

“**Stillgrove lets them in when someone opens the door. All it takes is one knock... and one invitation**.”

He pointed at me.

“**You opened it, didn’t you?**”

I wanted to deny it. I wanted to run. But I remembered that whisper. “**You saw him, didn’t you? Now he’s inside**"

But then... Mr. Halpern smiled.

And in that smile, I saw it.  
**the end of something**.  
Or maybe... **the beginning.**

I don’t know who else saw it. If you’ve been to Stillgrove… please tell me I’m not alone.
