My name is Jessica Nandeen. I’m a 36 year old stockbroker that grew up in Cleveland, Tennessee with a family of two sisters, one brother, one father, and one mother. I currently reside in New York, and have taken up writing as a side hobby to dull the pain of cranking ungodly amounts of numbers for equally ungodly clients. I often post on forums about macrame, weaving, and other arts & crafts. Today, I felt like writing a little jab at my past in a place that I often read in, but never engage with. It’s a weight that keeps growing and needs to be off my chest, even if I’m not sure this is the best way to go about it. For the past two months, I’ve gone down many-a rabbit hole in such a way that reminds me of how my mother got obsessed with the Blair Witch Project when everybody thought it was the “real deal”. 

This is going to be a heavier post.

When I was 18, back in 2007, I had a run-in with a small town in middle Tennessee that stirred my life. I had only passingly knew about this place, and my two best friends, Aaron and Raj, knew a lot more about it than I did. They were big-time thrill seekers that often trespassed and fooled around on private property. So much so that Aaron had at least five scars from run-ins with angry property owners and their buckshot. They were what overly hopeful parents would label as “explorers” or “adventurers”. More honestly, they were drinkers and greeners, *then* explorers and adventurers. I tagged along with them on an excessive amount of their excursions, and through that, I found out that they were my best friends, even if I was a sober buzzkill that reminded them of security guards and trail cameras. Something that came along with their love of goofing around and abandoned properties was an absolute *infatuation* with Scary Stuff. Mostly with Aaron. This is what would lead up to summer of 2007. To start off with, the following is a combination of what they told me, what I already knew *before* they told me anything, and what I’ve learned on the internet in hindsight:

Strawberry Fields is a small town in central Tennessee known for textiles and strawberry farms, hence its name. It has an app. population of 507 people as of the 2020 census. It has no noteworthy standing in county government or infrastructure. It has one city square with one courthouse, fifteen shop buildings, two textile warehouses, and one produce packing plant. East of the city is a strawberry farm, and further east of that is a nature reserve. Strawberry Fields has a sister city in New York of the same name.

Historically, Strawberry Fields was founded by B.E. Acker in 1856. The town was named after the success of his family’s strawberry farm(s) in the area. With a need for economic revitalization in the late 1800’s, three textile mills opened up in 1899. One suffered an explosion in 1920 and was never rebuilt. The Acker family still lives near the city, involved in certain politics and associations that retain the town’s “historical heartland” finish.

That’s what I know now, but back then, Strawberry Fields was just an idea to me. I remember passing through downtown once or twice when I was little and seeing local family pictures of strawberry picking activities being shared around. I filled in the rest of the blanks with what people in Cleveland would say about it. Anything they had to say about the sleepy town was always about the Strawberry Fields Slugger.

The Strawberry Fields Slugger, or just “The Slugger”, is why I’m here.

What I have to say has been catalogued by law enforcement and legal courts, more than once.

I figured I would get this off my chest while it’s fresh in my mind, out to the public for anybody who knows about my case. 

For almost twenty years now, I’ve had that face in my mind. It was the only time I ever drank with Aaron and Raj, and I partially blame myself for what happened that night.

 

The idea started in May of 2007. Aaron, Raj, and I had just graduated from high school. I had just started dating Aaron. Since we were planning a break year before we started at the local college, we had an entire year ahead of ourselves to plan out. It was Aaron’s idea. He thought we should camp out near Strawberry Fields. Raj liked a lot of Aaron’s ideas, but even he had his limits. It went something like this:

 

“No.”

 

“Why ‘no’?”

 

“Those woods are haunted.”

 

“So? You’ve been to other places that are haunted.”

 

“Those woods are *haunted*.” (I heard him put emphasis on the “H”).

 

“So what?”

 

“I’m not doing *anything* out there.”

 

Supposedly, Raj had heard things. Things that made the woods around Strawberry Fields scarier than the Whickam estate, or Dindston High School’s track house (for those who know, you know).

 

The way “woods” was said, it was such a heavy word. Every time Raj said it, it felt like a downward tug at your stomach. All of us could feel it at once. Even Aaron’s face turned a little paler, a little more sallow as they argued. It was like all of the evil in the world rested in this forest we hadn’t even seen yet.

Aaron explained he wanted to make a video blog with us, something to hold on for keepsakes once college got a hold of our lives. It would be a summer dream we could all look back on someday. Once he explained it that way, Raj let up a little bit under the emotional pressure. Aaron had guilt-tripped him.

I now know that the real reason he wanted to go out there was to chase his dream of a blurry photograph or plaster cast of a footprint. It gave him a high that none of the other stuff he did could live up to. I personally didn’t understand it at the time, but typing now, I feel like I understand it a bit more. You get so absorbed by how mysterious it all just is. You become obsessed.

 

Now that I’ve prefaced my story with some context, I ought to explain what the Strawberry Fields Slugger is (or was). 

Simply put, it was a boogeyman for younger kids. Hearing it from people who grew up near the town, parents would threaten it to children who refused to do chores, forgot to do homework, or started fights with siblings.

For most teens and adults, it was an urban legend. Where it wasn’t, it was a harsh reality for the few times that it did surface. The Slugger was often described as a horribly disfigured man in a tattered trench coat, or as a deathly thin monster with open sores and dead eyes. One thing always remained the same; it (or he) carried a massive, rusty pipe wrench. And according to credible records, true sightings almost always ended in permanent maiming.

 

Aaron knew this. I *know* he knew because he talked about everything with such a fluidity it would be hard to think he *didn't* know everything.

He pulled us along anyway. We went out in his silver 2002 Tacoma. It was June 6th, 2007. He promised us that we would go to Memphis up until Sunday, after we finished camping to Friday. June 6th was a Tuesday or Wednesday. We went through downtown, and Aaron gave us a tour. He had clearly been there before. We almost got t-boned by a minivan, twice, because he had crept down to a slow pace while passing a two different textile plants, rolling through a blatant stoplight each time. Raj was filming, along with Aaron. They took turns and refused to give the camera to me because I was not “a woman” or “a girl” but simply “woman”. They snickered like Beavis and Butthead the entire car ride. I got sick of it fast, but played along. Aaron was the *one*, I thought at the time. Never had I been so well treated by a man in my life, I *also* thought at the time. 

Our historical tour ended at 16:00 hours. Raj and I were exhausted, and we begged Aaron to shut up and drive us to the reserve. It was a roughly 10 minute drive through dirt roads and gravel paths. By the time we got to the gate, it was sprinkling, and the sky had gotten significantly darker. This was yet another area Aaron was supposedly familiar with. He got out, left us in the car, and untied the rope that held the aluminum gate together. I remember thinking that I should have gotten out with him, Raj was probably thinking that too. I could see his face in the rearview, and knew at once that our guts were telling us the exact opposite of what our heads were. Aaron got back in and plowed through the gate, kicking up mud and grass clumps in the process. The interior lights dimmed for a second. We all laughed. It took my mind off of things. It took another 15 minutes to get to a dead end. We got out after sitting in silence for 5 minutes. I couldn’t tell you why. Raj was the last one to leave the car, probably because he had the camera(?). We hiked for however long before we found a clearing. The sprinkling had stopped by then, and the grass was starting to get dry enough so our feet had less of a chance of being soaked by the night’s end. 

It was between 17:00 and 18:00 hours when we settled and set up camp. There was enough light, but it was still overcast, so we made it a priority to hurry. After the setup of two tents and the collection of some firewood and fist-sized rocks, we had a full-fledged campsite. The log that we were originally going to use as a bench ended up being too burly to roll, and the one that *was* ideal for rolling was too far away. Aaron ran around, doing most of the kindling and tinder collection, and he started the fire. Raj and I sat around, goofing with the camera, oblivious to Aaron’s working around us. When he finally sat down in his folding chair, he was sweating. He popped a beer for himself and opened a bottle of Bacardi for us. He poured it in what I think were some collapsible camping cups. We were all tired. It was a long day with a lot of planning and a significant amount of driving. Just as we were rehashing our day, just as I had been pressured into my first *ever* drink of alcohol (it was nasty) via my boyfriend’s instructions, we all went quiet. I remember seeing Raj and Aaron looking square ahead, eyes wider than any humans' should be. When I blinked, they were talking again, Aaron was jabbing me in my shoulder and laughing. In hindsight, it was probably placebo. It didn’t take very long for a buzz, then a goofiness to kick in. I get like that even today when I’m tipsy. Aaron kept poking me, saying I was cute, that I looked like Scully from *The X-Files*, on and on. This was usual, the only difference being that I was beyond myself. 

Some stuff happened that I’d prefer not to talk about. Besides, we were primed for discussing drunk philosophy. This was about the time when I was handed the camera, they gave up with the “woman” argument. We were half out of tape, but I kept recording. Raj wanted me to record his hot takes with Aaron, and Aaron’s hot takes with him. They got deep. So deep, I didn’t even realize they were talking about me until I heard the word “ginger”. In what context, I don’t remember, and I don’t want to remember. Eventually the sun was gone. It got down to just Aaron, and he told us a story. He told us the story of the Slugger. No matter how annoying Aaron was being a certain night, when he told you a story, you listened. You got dead quiet. Every time he would tell a story, I would write it down. I had a pencil and pad ready in my back left pocket for when he did. I tried my best for the state I was in. I’m surprised I kept these for so long:

 

“Supposedly, back in ’88 or ’89, during a town picnic hosted by the Abner-“

(Aaron botched the name)

“-family, their physically and mentally ill teenage son Mitchell escaped from a nearby institution and murdered three ~~of~~ parkgoers over the span of a day. Before they could catch him, he disappeared into the Abner nature reserve, here, and was never heard from again. Locals claim to see him every once in a while, his skin condition oozing, a monkey wrench poised to bludgeon his victims to death. Anybody \[who\] enters his home.”

 

I remember Raj and I stopped listening at “here”. After Aaron said that, we were scared, on top of being inebriated. This was just when I was starting to get dizzy, my vision was snapping back and forth. It might have been anywhere between a minute or thirty minutes when Raj saw it. I looked over, and he was shaking. He had been shaking the entire trip, but it was just then that I had noticed. He had the camera pointing at a gap in the bushes behind the fire. Aaron was singing. When I looked over to where Raj had the camera, he was pointing it at this face; so gutturally wrong my eyes water thinking about it. It was thin and pale from what I remember. It had stringy black hair and skin marbled with some kind of purplish and red discoloration. I saw bandages covering its forehead and the top of where its nose should have been. Its teeth were small and uniform, with the bottom row showing in a perfect grimace. Its eyes were so unnaturally wide. Its pupils were looking up, and it wasn’t moving.

Aaron turned and said, “Would you look at that!”

That was when I screamed. It still didn’t move.

We all sat there looking at it. Aaron assured us that it was probably a Halloween decoration we hadn’t noticed before. He wasn’t making any sense. Raj wasn’t making any sense when he started crying while staring into the camera preview, and I wasn’t making any sense when I told Aaron to “shoot it”. Aaron proceeded to pull a handgun from his bag and fire at it. I remember screaming, more, I remember drooling on accident, and I remember my ears ringing. The bushes rustled as the head shot straight up, taller than any of us could have imagined. Its teeth began clicking together. Before it had a chance to move further, we booked it back in the direction we thought the truck was in. We heard it chase us, we heard Raj fall behind, his screams getting quieter. We heard metal against bone and camera against ground. When Aaron and I reached the truck, he started it, and we peeled out of there. We fell asleep in an odd parking space downtown when we had stopped crying and began to hold onto each other for all that life was worth. 

We didn’t speak to each other the day after that.

We didn’t speak to each other when the police got our testimonies.

We didn’t speak to each other when Raj’s family pursued us in court.

We were acquitted. Neither Raj nor the camera was ever found.

Aaron and I never spoke again.

I’m not at peace, and I’m not sure if I ever will be.

I’m sorry for dumping this. I just got a package in the mail and I have better things to do now.

 

Toodles.
