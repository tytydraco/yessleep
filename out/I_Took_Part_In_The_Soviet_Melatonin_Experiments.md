Below is the only known diary from the Soviet Melatonin Experiments. A mythical event among us scientists, but once I was allowed into the declassified archives, I knew what I had found. Do not take it lightly, when humanity and scientific discovery meet in the middle, one must give way.

This appears to be a case of the former.

1979, December 4

Comrades, if the work of myself and my colleagues helps usher in a new understanding of human happiness, then unlike my colleagues, I can die happy. To this, we advance our people, our nation, and our spirit to new heights. Our names shall be etched alongside Lysenko and Lamarck.

On the first day of our experiment, the 7 Patients arrived at our laboratory. We did their bloods, we checked their biometric information, and of course, we made them sign an exhaustive list of preliminary documents. All 7 were willing, healthy soldiers who were proud to be part of the great journey. Their heads were shaved, and they were given matching uniforms. The only notable differential was their numbering, 1-7. As stipulated, we would be providing a once-off injection of Melatonin. At least, that was what they believe we would be providing them with. Once settled, we led them to a large room with 6 bunkbeds.

The room was a large steel rectangle. We had provided books, puzzles, and a table and chair with a diary for their own entries. We were able to see their behaviour through a large one-way glass wall. The overseer had one instruction. Never intervene. If they died, which we all knew was not going to happen, we were to see the experiment to the end. This was impressed on us in great, almost intimidating, detail.

I would be lying if I said I cared too much. I truly wanted to see the outcome of my life’s work.

**Day 1**

With some discomfort and protest, all 7 Patients have settled into their new home. Some have engaged in light exercise, pacing the room while others have availed of the literature we provided. There is healthy discussion about post and rank. The Patients are deferring matters to Patient 1 as he is the highest rank. This was not intended. Within hours we were blown away by the effects. Politeness, laughter, and good spirit was the theme of Day 1. It did not take long before a passinonate argument ensued over who would have to sleep on the floor.They all insisted they would as to make their fellow comrades happy! Glorious. If successful, this experiment would give us the foundation of a self-sacrificing, loyal soldier.

*Note: Patient 6 expressed controversial views in relation to The Patriotic War. The Secretary for the Committee for State Security will be briefed. Andropov, I am sure, will be personally interested.*   

**Day 2**

The night nurse noted that all 7 engaged in jovial chatting.

In fact, on the first night, 3 people slept on the floor. Patient 1,2 and 3 insisted that they sleep on the floor. They believed profusely that they had to make sure their comrades had a comfortable place to sleep. We noted that the impact of the injection had mildly lowered their own self-preservation.

2 of the Patients, Patient 1 and 3 insisted that their meal by evenly split among the others. By combining their meals, they felt they were “equally happy.” We encouraged them not to engage in this behaviour as it ended up with some of the Patients refusing to eat their own meals for fear they would disappoint the others. Starvation, while their own choice would not reflect too well on our experiments. In previous studies, starvation was interpreted as protest to which the scientists were scorned for tolerating such self-defiance. Unfortunately, they did not seem to care about our concerns. It was almost as if the effects were isolated to that room.

*Note: It is my expert opinion that their loyalty is to those they can see. Perhaps an animalistic instinct.*

**Day 3**

The night nurse said that Patient 1 and 2 started friendly communication with her through the hatch that we use to provide food. We discouraged needless fraternising. Our orders were strictly to maintain the experiment to its conclusion. Friendly discussions were not needed. The Secretary for the Committee for State Security will be briefed on her behaviour. Patients 1,2 and 3 have engaged in self-mutilation. They appear to be intensifying their melatonin levels by the rush. Debate is raging with the doctors. They want to intervene. I have put an end to such ridiculous sentimentality.

Patients 4-7 appear completely distraught. It appears as if Patients 1-3 have gone on a charm offensive. They are expertly calming the nerves of the group. It appears as if Patients 1-3 fall into normalised behaviour due to the overwhelming negative emotions of the majority.

*Note: It is my expert opinion that the night nurse's loose morals can harm our experiment. The Secretary for the Committee for State Security will be briefed on her behaviour.*

**Day 4**

The night nurses informed us that 3 of the Patients had refused to sleep. They insisted on shouting affirmations to each other. Between 3-7am, Patients 1-3 stood on opposite sides of the room and chanted positive thinking to each other. When Patient 5 intervened, they gouged his tongue out. Patients 1-3 then proceeded to compliment him on his listening skills.

Patient 5 expired by the time the day staff had arrived.

The Patients are now split right down the middle. Patients 1-3, the “happys” as some in the laboratory had decided to nickname them seem to be totally affected by the melatonin injection. The second group, 4,6, and 7 were either immune to the injection or it has worn off. It is clear, from our opinion, that they are feigning their happiness for safety reasons. They have tried to communicate to us through the hatch in the door. We have noted their concerns but will not action a cessation of the experiment.

I shall make a note of this for the night nurse.

*Note: The night nurse’s flirting is a distraction.*

**Day 5**

Exciting! The night nurse informed me that the happys have figured out the cynic’s ruse. It appears that the happys, in order to keep the energy levels high, have forcibly carved smiles into the cynics’ mouths. In a very novel twist, barring Patient 1, they have also done it to themselves.

It seems that their fleeting happiness is more important than long term health.

*Note: Patient 6 and 7 have died before the night shift.*

*Note: The night nurse is flirting again.*

*Note: In my expert opinion, the meal today was below average today. Schi and buckwheat. Disappointing. The Secretary for the Committee for State Security shall be briefed*

**Day 6**

The night nurse informed us that the happys have decided that the bodies of Patient 6 and 7, without life, are a net sadness in the room. Through raw consumption, they have feasted on the bodies and, at least in their minds, have altered the happiness/sadness ratio in their favour. For the remainder of the day, Patients 1-3 have engaged in non-stop laughing fits. Their vocals cords are audibly damaged. Patient 1 appears to be miming laughter.

*Note: The remaining 3 happys appear to have become interested in our presence.*

*Note: I am not on talking terms with the night nurse. It is my expert opinion that her lack of professionalism is clear. I shall brief the Secretary for the Committee for State Security*

**Day 7**

We have had to move to the overseer’s office. It seems the night nurses’ lackadaisical attitude was an opportunity for Patient 1. We are not too sure what happened, but it appears that they managed to coax her, through compliments to the meal hatch. From there, we believe she opened the door to their bed chamber.

*Note: It is in my expert opinion that the night nurse, if alive, shall be given a severe dressing down by Secretary for the Committee for State Security.*

*Note: The laughter is closing in. I am trying not to be loud.*

**Day 8**

The night nurse has provided no update, nor has her head been found.

The laughter is outside the room. Patients 1 and 2 are trying to coax me out of the room. Their compliments, while correct, are futile.

**Day 9**

This may be the last day of the experiment and my last day also. The laughter has now ceased outside my door, but I can hear them in the vents. There is little I can do.

*Note: In my expert opinion, the Secretary for the Committee for State Security should make sure that my body is not eaten.*
