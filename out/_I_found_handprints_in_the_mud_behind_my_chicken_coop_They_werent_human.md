 

The morning was still as a held breath.

Cold clung to the porch railings and silvered the grass. Mist hung low, pooling in the hollows of the yard and drifting like smoke across the street, where the trees stood black and bare, their limbs tangled like old wire.

I slung my work bag over one shoulder and locked the front door behind me. I wore a flannel overshirt and heavy boots, but the chill still found the skin at my neck. The air smelled of wet leaves and something faintly metallic.

I stepped off the porch and paused.

There, in the patch of mud beside the gravel drive, were tracks. Not boot prints. Not paws. Not anything I could name.

They were long, narrow impressions—like the heel of a hand pressed deep into the earth, fingers splayed. But there were no matching footprints. Just those strange palm-shaped marks, staggered and dragging slightly, as if whatever made them had pulled itself forward on its hands alone.

I crouched, frowning. The soil was soft from last night’s rain, and the prints were fresh. I reached out, almost touched one, then thought better of it.

A flicker of movement caught my eye.

Across the street, just beyond the mist, something pale lay at the edge of the woods. I squinted. It looked like a chicken—limp, wings askew, neck twisted at an unnatural angle. One of ours?

I stood slowly, heart beginning to thud.

The coop was behind the house, fenced and latched. Jules and I had built it ourselves last spring, after I got laid off. It was sturdy. Safe.

I turned on my heel and walked fast around the side of the house, boots crunching frostbitten grass. The coop door hung open. The latch dangled, unbroken.

Inside, feathers. Scattered like torn paper. And in the corner, a smear of something dark.

One hen missing. The rest huddled silent, wide-eyed.

I backed away, breath clouding in the air. I looked toward the trees again, but the mist had thickened. The shape was gone.

I stood for a long moment, staring into the mist where it had been. The trees across the street loomed quiet and still, their trunks swallowed by fog.

I closed the coop gently, checked the latch twice. The remaining hens rustled behind me, feathers puffed and silent.

Inside the house, warmth met me like a blanket. The radiator hummed. One of the cats—Moss—wound around my ankles, purring. The others were curled in their usual places: on the windowsill, the armchair, the folded laundry. I counted them without thinking. Five. All accounted for.

I stepped softly into the bedroom. Jules lay curled on her side, one arm tucked under her cheek, hair fanned across the pillow. I leaned down and kissed her temple, lingering just a moment. She stirred but didn’t wake.

I dressed quietly, poured coffee into a thermos, and left for work.

***…***

The office was a converted house on the edge of town, pale green siding and a crooked porch. I worked for the county’s Parks and Trails department—mostly maintenance, sometimes signage, sometimes trail clearing. It was quiet work, and I liked it that way.

But today, I couldn’t focus.

I kept thinking about the prints. The way they dragged. The way they looked like hands.

And the chicken. That pale shape in the mist. It had been there. I was sure of it. But when I looked again, it was gone.

Around ten, my phone buzzed.

**Jules**:  
Did you say one of the chickens was *missing*?

I stared at the screen, thumb hovering.

**Me**:  
Yeah. Coop door was open. One gone.  
Weird tracks in the mud. Like handprints.  
Thought I saw a dead one across the street.  
It disappeared.

Three dots blinked. Then stopped.

**Jules**:  
That’s… weird.

**Me**:  
I know.

I looked out the office window. Mist still clung to the trees behind the building. The same kind of trees. The same kind of quiet.

Ray walked in and dropped a clipboard on the desk. “You good?” he asked.

I nodded. “Just tired.”

But my eyes kept drifting to the woods.

…

By noon, the mist had burned off, but the cold lingered. I was in the garage, strapping my pack to the back of the ATV when Ray came in, rubbing his hands together like he could will warmth into them.

“Trail 9’s yours today,” he said. “Storm last week knocked some limbs down, and we’ve had a couple hikers complain. Nothing major, just messy.”

I nodded, tightening the last strap.

Ray hesitated. “Also… someone reported an abandoned campsite out past the ridge. Way off trail. Said it looked weird. Like someone left in a hurry.”

I raised an eyebrow. “You want me to check it out?”

“Yeah. Just make sure no one’s hurt or squatting out there. Shouldn’t take long. You’ll be back before dark.”

I didn’t say anything, just waited.

He scratched his beard. “I know it’s a stretch, but with all the missing pets this year… I don’t know. Feels off. Cats, dogs, even a goat from that farm on 42. Just gone.”

I frowned. “You think it’s connected?”

“I think I don’t like coincidences,” he said. “And we’re short-staffed. You’re the only one I trust to handle it solo.”

I gave a short nod, swung my leg over the ATV, and started the engine.

…

The trail was easy. A few downed branches, some erosion near the switchback, but nothing I couldn’t clear with a handsaw and a little muscle. The woods were quiet—too quiet. No birdsong. No wind. Just the hum of the engine and the crunch of tires over frost-hardened dirt.

I found the campsite just past the ridge, tucked in a hollow near a dry creek bed.

At first glance, it looked like someone had left in a hurry. A tent collapsed on one side. A camp chair overturned. A cooler cracked open, contents spilled and half-frozen.

Then I saw the tracks.

Same as the ones by my driveway that morning—long, narrow handprints, fingers splayed, dragging through the mud. They were everywhere. Around the firepit. Across the flattened tent. Leading into the woods and back again, like something had circled the site over and over.

It didn’t look abandoned. It looked destroyed.

My stomach turned. Every instinct screamed that I shouldn’t be here. Not alone.

My hand went to my hip, to the spot where I used to carry a sidearm. But that had been a point of contention—too aggressive, Ray had said. Too much, for someone with my “presence.” Now all I had was the hunting knife strapped to my thigh.

I sighed, low and bitter, and backed away from the site.

The sun was already starting to dip behind the trees. Shadows stretched long across the forest floor. I climbed back onto the ATV and turned it toward the trailhead.

…

The ride back was slower. The air felt heavier. The woods too still.

Then I heard it—faint, far off. A sound like footsteps, but wrong. Not boots. Not hooves. Something uneven. Wet. Like hands slapping the ground.

I stopped the ATV and listened.

Nothing.

I started moving again, faster now, eyes flicking to the trees.

Then came the cry.

It echoed through the forest—long, low, and mournful. Not human. Not animal. Something in between. It made my skin crawl.

The ATV sputtered.

I cursed, tapped the throttle. The engine coughed, then died.

“Well fuck,” I muttered, climbing off.

The forest was silent again. Too silent.

I slung my pack over my shoulder, tightened my grip on the knife, and started walking.

The woods were darker now. The sun had slipped behind the hills, and the trees stood like sentinels, black against the bruised sky.

I walked fast, boots crunching frostbitten leaves. My breath came in short bursts, fogging the air. The knife in my hand felt small. Insufficient.

Behind me, the sounds continued.

Not footsteps. Not exactly.

A wet, slapping rhythm. Uneven. Like something dragging itself forward. Like hands.

I didn’t look back.

I knew better.

The trail curved, and I saw the faint glow of the office porch light through the trees. Relief surged—but it was thin, brittle.

The sounds grew louder.

I stopped.

The forest was silent again. No wind. No birds. Just the thud of my heart.

Then the cry came.

A long, low wail—mournful and wrong. It echoed through the trees, vibrating in my chest.

The hairs on my neck rose.

I turned.

Just for a second.

In the dark, between the trunks, I saw it.

A pale figure—white, torn, hunched low to the ground. It moved in a way that defied sense, limbs bent wrong, head lolling. It didn’t walk. It didn’t crawl. It propelled itself, jerking forward like a puppet with tangled strings.

I gasped and ran.

I sprinted the last stretch, knife clutched tight, lungs burning. I burst through the office door and slammed it shut, locking it.

Ray stood from his desk, startled. “Jesus, Hollis—what happened?”

I leaned against the wall, panting.

“There’s something out there,” I said.

Ray stared at me. “What kind of something?”

I shook my head. “I don’t know. But I’m bringing my sidearm from now on.”

Ray nodded slowly.

We didn’t speak much after that. Just packed up in silence, checked the windows, and stepped out into the cold together. I scanned the tree line as we walked to our trucks.

The woods watched back.

…

By the time I pulled into the driveway, the sky was ink-black and the mist had returned, curling low around the porch steps. The house lights glowed warm through the windows. I sat in the truck for a moment, gripping the wheel, before finally stepping out.

Inside, the smell of mushrooms and thyme wrapped around me like a blanket. Jules stood at the stove, ladling soup into two bowls. Her beautiful pink hair was pulled into a loose bun, wisps curling around her face in the steam. She turned when I came in, her eyes narrowing.

“You’re late,” she said gently. “And you look like hell.”

I dropped my bag by the door and kicked off my boots. “I’m fine.”

She raised an eyebrow.

We sat at the kitchen table, the cats weaving between our legs. I wrapped my hands around the warm bowl, but didn’t eat.

Jules waited.

Finally, I spoke. “I saw something. Out past Trail 9. A wrecked campsite. Same tracks I saw this morning—like handprints, dragging through the mud. And then… something followed me back. I heard it. I saw it.”

She didn’t interrupt. Just listened, her spoon paused halfway to her mouth.

“It was pale,” I said. “Torn up. Moving wrong. Like it didn’t have legs. Like it was pulling itself.”

The silence stretched.

Jules set her spoon down and leaned back in her chair, eyes distant. “You said it moved on its hands?”

I nodded.

She stood abruptly and left the room. I heard the soft clack of keys from the office down the hall, the creak of the old desk chair. I stayed at the table, staring into my soup, the warmth of the house suddenly feeling fragile.

When Jules returned, she was holding a thin folder and a printout. Her face was pale.

“I think I know what you saw,” she said.

I looked up.

“There’s an old story,” Jules began, sitting down again. “Not something people talk about anymore. Not in town. Not even in the library archives unless you know where to look.”

She slid the paper across the table.

“Her name was Maribeth Crane. Lived up in the hills, near where Trail 9 runs now. She was a healer, a midwife, and by all accounts, a good woman. Helped folks who couldn’t afford doctors. Took in strays. Kept to herself.”

Jules hesitated.

“Then there was an accident. No one knows exactly what happened. Some say she was attacked. Others say she fell into a ravine. But she was broken after that. Couldn’t walk upright. Moved on her hands, dragging her body behind her.”

My stomach twisted.

“They say the town turned on her,” Jules continued. “Called her cursed. Said she brought sickness. Said she was unnatural. She lived the rest of her life alone in the woods. Died out there, too. Some say she never left.”

She looked at me carefully.

“There’s more. People say her ghost doesn’t just haunt the woods. It… attaches. To people. Picks someone. Follows them. Watches. And once it’s chosen you, it doesn’t stop.”

I stared at the paper. A grainy photo of a woman with tired eyes and a crooked smile. The caption read: *Maribeth Crane, 1932.*

“No one says her name anymore,” Jules said softly. “Not around here. Folks are too superstitious. They just call her ‘the thing in the trees.’”

I looked at her. “You believe this?”

She didn’t answer right away. Then: “I believe you saw something. And I believe this place remembers pain.”

Outside, the wind picked up. The porch creaked.

I reached for Jules’s hand.

…

The next morning, Jules was quiet. She made coffee, fed the cats, and sat at the table with her laptop open. I watched her from the doorway.

“You okay?” I asked.

She didn’t look up. “I found something else.”

I stepped closer.

“There’s a pattern,” Jules said. “Every few decades. Someone sees it. Feels it. Starts hearing things. Then they disappear.”

My throat tightened. “Disappear how?”

“No one knows. They just… vanish. Sometimes their animals go first. Sometimes their partners. But it always starts with the tracks.”

She turned the laptop toward me. A scanned newspaper clipping. *Local Woman Missing After Strange Reports in Woods.*

The photo was grainy. But I recognized the woman’s eyes. Wide. Haunted.

“She said it followed her,” Jules whispered. “Said she felt it watching. Said she dreamed about it.”

I stepped back.

“I think it’s chosen you,” Jules said.

…

That night, the house felt wrong.

The radiator hissed too loud. The cats wouldn’t settle. One by one, they slunk into the bedroom, ears flat, tails puffed. I sat on the edge of the bed, lacing my boots.

I’d already pulled the water gun from the hall closet—bright green plastic, filled with holy water from a dusty bottle labeled *St. Jude’s, 2009*. A relic from my ghost-hunting days, back when I thought hauntings were stories and salt was just seasoning.

Jules stood in the doorway, pale and silent, holding a flashlight in one hand and a box of rock salt in the other.

We didn’t speak.

Then the porch creaked.

The cats hissed in unison, backing into corners, fur bristling.

A low scraping sound moved along the siding. Then the unmistakable sound of something climbing—slow, deliberate, unnatural.

I stepped into the hallway just as the living room window slid open with a soft click.

It came through.

Twisted. Pale. Its skin hung in tatters, like wet paper clinging to bone. Its arms were too long, elbows bent backward, fingers splayed like broken twigs. It moved on its hands, dragging the rest of its body behind, spine arching and collapsing with each lurch.  Its face was a ruin—half collapsed, half grinning. One eye socket empty. The other wide and gleaming.

It turned toward Jules.

She froze, flashlight trembling in her grip.

The creature crept closer, its breath rattling like wind through dead leaves.

The cats shrieked and scattered.

“Hey,” I said.

The thing stopped.

Its head twisted toward me, neck cracking. That grin widened, impossibly.

“I know you’re here for me,” I said, voice steady. “You picked me.”

It stared.

“I know what they did to you,” I said. “I know what it’s like to be twisted by other people’s fear. To be hated for how you move through the world.”

The leer faltered.

“But I’m not afraid of you,” I said. “And you don’t get to have me.”

I nodded once.

Jules raised the water gun and fired.

The stream hit the creature square in the chest. It screamed—a sound like metal tearing, like wind howling through a broken throat. Its body convulsed, limbs flailing, skin blistering where the water touched.

It scrambled backward, shrieking, and hurled itself through the open window, vanishing into the night with a final, echoing wail.

Silence fell.

The cats crept back in, wide-eyed but unharmed.

Jules and I stood in the center of the room, breathing hard.

Then she said, “Salt?”

“Salt,” I confirmed.

We worked in silence, pouring a ring around the house, every window, every door. The night air was sharp, but the stars were clear.

When we finished, we stood on the porch, side by side.

Jules looked at me. “You okay?”

I nodded. “She picked the wrong bitch.”

She smiled, tired and fierce. “Damn right she did.”

And behind us, the house breathed easy again.
