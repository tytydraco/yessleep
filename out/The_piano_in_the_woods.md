I usually go on long runs in the forest, mainly to be in tune with nature and to exercise. I've seen lots of wild animals, abandoned cabins, staircases and everything in between on my runs. But until a couple years ago, I found this piano in the deep in the forest. No head trail to it or drag marks or anything. It seemed like it appeared from nowhere. And this was super deep in the forest too. My reaction was that it looked beautiful, and it was almost in perfect condition. I couldn't find any company name on it so probably it was handmade. I really wanted to know the backstory to this piano and how it ended up here. It was just standing there under a birch tree like it recently spawned. But it’s made of wood, so it’s back with it's friends now. I tried playing it and funny enough it was in perfect tune. I went back to it a couple of times. A couple of times turned into a dozen times. It sounded so beautiful in the forest. The forest bring such cool acoustics to it. I never really reacted to the fact that it still was in good condition. Either someone is actively servicing it or it's a really good built piano. 

But one day I could swear I heard someone playing it too. When I arrived at the spot no one was there. If a piano is in a forest and no one plays it, does it make a sound? I felt the feeling like somebody was watching me. After that time, I actually never went back to it. But it was until very recently that I've heard some stories about more people finding abandoned pianos deep in the forest. All over the world. And they found them really deep deep in the woods. I looked it up on the web and found a couple theories. If you play the right notes it will open another dimension or if you play it you will get cursed for life. The piano did look a bit cursed but at the same time beautiful. 

But I found this strangely disturbing old Swedish myth that if you ever find a piano in the woods, do not play it. If you play it, you will come back to it, again and again. You'll basically become obsessed. And the funny thing is, I've already played it like a couple dozen times so I guess I'm obsessed. What's weirding me out is that this piano only *looks* abandoned. I really felt like somebody was there with me at some times. These pianos should go out of tune really quickly when put in this environment. And who even copes to drag a piano so deep, they're super heavy? They are surprisingly difficult to get rid of. No one wants them and they’re rather unwieldy to move. And who even was that person I heard playing it? I have so many questions that needs answers. And that's all I have about this piano. Have you on guys on /nosleep seen or heard anything about the pianos in the woods? Let me know.
