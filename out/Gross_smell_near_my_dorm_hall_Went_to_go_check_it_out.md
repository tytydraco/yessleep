Hey Reddit. I wanted to share this recent experience I’ve had. I can’t find anything when I search it up, so as usual, Reddit is my last recourse.

For some background, I’m a college student. Not really that social, I don’t go to parties or anything, I get chronic migraines and the music tends to set those off. Campus is pretty nice, it’s decently big and it’s got a lot of trees, so it's not like I'm inside all day. (I’m staying on campus over the summer because I gotta retake organic chemistry, so it’s relevant, I swear.)

The other day, I think Tuesday, I was headed back to my dorm after class. Got unlucky and got saddled with it in the evening, so it was a bit hard to see, but we aren’t an unsafe campus or anything. We have streetlights and all that. I don’t get freaked out walking back because the main danger is cars and I have eyeballs and a brain.

There had been this awful smell by my dorm hall for like two days before this, like somebody dropped a dead rat in the bushes or something. I didn’t really want to go fishing around for a dead rat for obvious reasons, so I just ignored it. Come Tuesday, the smell was the worst it ever was. Smelled like somebody baked the damn thing.

Finally decided I had enough of it around then, because I wasn’t putting up with the smell for another week before campus cleaners got to it. Yogurt cups on the windows are one thing, smelly dead rat is another. I went to my dorm, grabbed a trash bag and a flashlight, and went back outside. I swear to god the smell got worse during the five-ish minutes I was in the hall.

I waded into the bushes, waving my flashlight around looking for whatever died in a hole in there. Nothing. Couldn’t find a thing. I checked the gutters, nothing. Seemed to be coming from a dorm room that was by the bushes, one of the ones on the outside wall where you can basically just look in the window and see everything, so I decided to go knock on their door because I’m not the type of person to resort to calling the RA without trying diplomacy first. Just don’t have it in me.

I tried to go back inside the dorm hall. Buzzer didn’t work. It didn’t register my ID no matter how many times I scanned it. Naturally I’m freaking out by now, I have homework and also all my stuff is in the dorm hall. This was an issue back at the start of the semester, IDs just stopped working for some reason and campus police had to scramble to fix it. Seemed reasonable that they could fix it again, so I decided to pay them a visit.

I turned to head over there and I just see this massive fucking THING. Gotta be at least eight feet tall. It was hunched over like some kinda gremlin thing. I don’t really know how to describe it, it was just…blank. There was nothing. No features beyond being vaguely human shaped, but it was way stretched.

It didn’t have eyes. No mouth. No body features. Didn’t have hands, either, or feet. Didn’t have on any clothes. Nothing to make it clear that this thing even has bones or flesh or anything. Looked like a rock, kinda, except rocks don’t smell like a dead raccoon that’s been left under a trashcan in the sun for five days.

I just kind of stared at it for a while. Can’t tell if it saw me. It eventually started coming my way, and I think I nearly died of a heart attack when it did. But it walked right past me to the dorm room I wanted to check out. Went in through the window, didn’t even open the damned thing, it just squeezed through like it’s made of liquid or some shit.

After that I just kind of stood there for a bit. I didn’t know what to do. How do you even react to that. There’s a big thing that smells like a corpse and then it goes into your dorm hall through somebody’s window. You try reacting to that.

After that I went to campus police. They were completely unhelpful, as expected. ID wasn’t even broken, so I wasted ten minutes of my time for nothing. I went back towards the hall and nearly tripped over some random object in the road.

Reddit, when I tell you I almost threw up, I mean I almost threw up. 

There was an arm. In the road. Just a whole fucking arm, rotting away, worms crawling in it and everything. I almost tripped over an ARM. I accidentally squished one of the worms that had crawled away from the arm when I stumbled, and good lord that thing was full of just. Gross. Grossness. 

That thing was leaning out the window of the dorm hall. Same window it squirmed into the dorm hall through, and it was just there, leaning out with its head pointed at me. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. Everything smelled like rot. I thought I was going to die.

And then it just went back inside like it was never there. Window was shut the whole time.

So anyway, I’m staying at a hotel now.

I’ve already involved local authorities, so I’m hoping this gets resolved at some point. Still wanna know what the fuck that thing was, but the only thing coming up is those nightcrawler things and it wasn’t one of those. There haven’t been any missing person reports recently, either, which makes things even more confusing, because that arm was still pretty fresh, even though it smelled like a five week old pizza. 

Not sure what to do, and the thought of going back to campus at all makes me want to curl up and die. I figured I’d share this here, since everywhere else is a dead end.

Sorry for the long post and all that. Here’s hoping I don’t die in my sleep or some shit!
