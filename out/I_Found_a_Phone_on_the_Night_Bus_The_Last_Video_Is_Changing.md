I don’t take the night bus unless I have to. However last Friday, my shift at the warehouse ran late and the rain was too heavy to walk home, so I ended up on the 1:15 a.m. route. The bus was nearly empty just me, an old man asleep in the back, and a driver who looked like he regretted every life decision that led him here.

I slid into a seat, pulled out my headphones… and that’s when I felt something under my leg.

A phone.
Face-up.
Black screen.
No case.

I held it up, expecting someone to claim it. No one looked up. There was no lock screen. No passcode. Just one app open:

Camera.

And there was a video paused at the exact moment someone had hit record. The thumbnail showed a woman sitting on a bed in a dim room, staring straight into the camera, eyes swollen from crying.

I should’ve handed it to the driver. I should’ve ignored it, but I didn’t.

I hit play.

The woman whispered:

“He won’t let me leave the room. If you find this… I’m sorry.” Something clattered behind her. She jerked, choking back a sob. The video ended abruptly like she’d lunged forward to grab the phone. There were three more videos, all recorded within minutes of each other.

I looked around the bus again.

Still empty.

I tapped onto the next video.

The woman held the camera closer now. Half her face filled the frame, shaking violently. “There’s someone in the corner,” she whispered.

“But he looks exactly like me.”

The camera panned across the room, and yeah there was someone in the corner. A woman, same clothes, same hair. Head tilted at a grotesque angle, like she wasn’t used to copying human posture.

The copy smiled, however the smile stretched too wide. The video cut off again, I felt cold sweat trickle down my back.

This was fake. Had to be. Right?

This one looked different, much clearer. The woman wasn’t crying anymore, she was smiling, her head unnatural and still, her eyes too wide, like someone had paused her facial expression.

She leaned close to the camera.

“She’s gone,” she whispered.
“It’s just me now.”

The lights on the bus flickered.

I jumped and instinctively paused the video.
The old man in the back muttered something in his sleep, the bus driver didn’t react, my heart was hammering. I should’ve thrown the phone out the window, but I didn’t.

There was one last video.

But the strangest part? Its timestamp was five minutes in the future. The thumbnail… wasn’t of the woman anymore.

It was the inside of a bus.

My bus.

My stomach dropped. My hands shook so badly I almost dropped the phone.

I hit play.

The camera was held low, like at someone’s hip. The bus was empty except for a man sitting exactly where I was sitting.

Wearing my jacket.
My backpack.
My shoes.

Me.

The me in the video was staring at the phone in horror. Then, from the aisle, a figure leaned into the frame.

The woman.

Or the thing that wasn’t the woman anymore, her neck bent sharply as she peered into the camera, inches from the lens, grinning too wide.

She whispered:

“Don’t look up.”

The video ended instantly.

Like someone had snatched the phone away. I froze. My breathing was ragged, my hands were trembling so violently I almost dropped the phone again.

And then, something on the bus creaked, very slowly, like someone shifting their weight, right beside me.

I didn’t want to look.

But I did, there was a reflection in the bus window. A shape, a head. Bent at the wrong angle, and smiling. The lights flickered again.

When they came back on…

The seat next to me was empty, but the reflection wasn’t.

I’m writing this from the back of the bus, hiding between the seats. I don’t know where the driver is. I don’t know where the old man went. I don’t know where she is. The phone screen just lit up again.

A new notification:

“New Video Saved.”

Timestamp: One minute from now.

I can hear something crawling under the seats, I think it’s filming me.

If someone finds this…
Please don’t come looking.

There are two of me now, and one of us is smiling.
