I don’t know why I’m posting this, but I need to get it out. I haven’t slept properly in months. Even though we moved, I still wake up at night, expecting to hear him.

It started when my roommate Kyle and I moved into a cheap rental house last fall. We were college students, desperate for an affordable place, so when we found a two-bedroom way below market rent, we didn’t ask questions.

The landlord was a strange old guy, eager to sign the lease. No walkthrough, no paperwork delays—just handed us the keys and said, *"Make yourselves at home."* At the time, we thought we had lucked out.

For a while, things were normal. The house was a little run-down—creaky floors, bad insulation—but nothing alarming. Then small things started happening.

Cabinets left slightly open when I knew I had closed them. Food missing—not full meals, just little things. A slice of bread. A few crackers. A cup of juice gone.

At first, I thought Kyle was taking my stuff, but he swore he wasn’t. Then he started noticing it, too. Leftovers moved. Lights on that he was sure he had turned off.

We laughed it off. *"House is haunted,"* Kyle joked. But we both started feeling uneasy.

Then, one night, I woke up at 3 AM to a sound that made my stomach drop.

Breathing.

Not from Kyle’s room.

Inside the walls.

I held my breath, listening. It was slow, shallow, rhythmic. Then a faint shuffling sound, like someone shifting their weight.

I told myself it was nothing. Pipes. The wind. But it kept happening. Night after night. Always around the same time.

Then came the night I knew we weren’t alone.

Kyle was out late. I was home alone, working on an assignment, when I heard it.

The fridge door opening.

I froze.

I was the only one there.

My heart pounded as I grabbed a knife from the kitchen. The house was silent now, but I could *feel* something was wrong.

Stepping into the hallway, I saw it.

The fridge door was swinging shut.

I searched every room, every closet, even under the beds. Nothing. The doors were locked. The windows secured. It made no sense.

Kyle rushed home when I called him, and we decided to check the house from top to bottom. That’s when we found it.

The hallway closet had a loose air vent near the floor. It looked… wrong. Out of place.

Kyle pulled it off.

Behind it, there was a hole. A dark, narrow crawl space between the walls.

Big enough for someone to fit inside.

We shined a flashlight into the hole, and my stomach turned.

A dirty blanket. An empty water bottle. A crumpled granola bar wrapper.

Someone had been living there.

We didn’t sleep that night. First thing in the morning, we called the landlord.

He barely reacted. Just sighed.

*"Ah. Thought I patched that up last time."*

*Last time?*

That’s when we learned the truth.

The house had been rented to multiple tenants before us. None of them stayed longer than a year. The landlord refused to say why.

We got the cops involved, but by then, the space was empty. Whoever had been there was gone.

The worst part?

The officer who checked the place told us something that still makes my skin crawl.

The dust around the hole had been recently disturbed.

Whoever was there had been watching us. Moving in and out while we slept.

We broke the lease a month later. Lost our deposit. Slept on friends’ couches until we found a new place.

I don’t care.

But sometimes, late at night, I wake up, feeling like I’m being watched.

And I wonder…

Did we leave him behind?

Or did he follow us?
