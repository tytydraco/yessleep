Hereâ€™s the link to my last post. 

I don't know if anyone remembers me. I posted here a few months ago. I'm the - I was the dental Hygienist whose patient died during their teeth cleaning. I know it's been a while. I know a lot of people wanted answers, I did too. I still do. 

I'm not a hygienist anymore. After what happened Dr. S thought it would be best for everyone involved if I left the practice. Frankly, I think he was just trying to cover his ass. Newsflash, Doc, dEad people can't sue. Anyways, they kept me in the hospital for a few days. They wanted to do a psych hold to make sure I wasn't a danger to myself or others whatever that means. They also wanted to test the blood that was all over me. See that was the wrench in the police's theory. They said that the patient died and due to the sudden trauma of having a patient die I suffered from a short mental collapse. The thing is most breaks from reality don't leave you with physical evidence.

It was when the results came back from a lab analysis that things got worse. When it first happened the police told me that the thing who died in my chair had been a homeLess woman who was on the verge of death and wandered into the office in confusion. 
A terrible event that no one could have prevented.
They took that thing's body from the office and did some CSI shit and tried to pull some DNA. They needed to identify this thing if possible and notify "her" next of kin. They took samples from the body and samples from the blood on my clothes. Once the results came back the cops found me. I wasn't that hard to find since the hospital staff was still keeping a really close eye on me. That's when I wrote that first post. 

Two uniformed officers came into the room and there was a detective with them. She was nice if not a little curt. She introduced herself as Detective Ryan. She said she worked in the homicide division. I immediately started crying. She exPlained that the blood on my clothes matched up with a case they had been trying to solve for a few months. A woman named Jane Forester had gone missing from her apartment in Quincy last summer and hadn't been found. Well, she hadn't been found until Tara called 911 that day. The thing that died in my chair, her DNA matched. She was Jane Froester. The blood on my clothes though that was a bigger mystery. It didn't match Jane's DNA. It did match Claire Sullivan though. 

Detective Ryan was blunt with me. She said she intended to figure oUt just how I ended up with the body of a missing woman in my office but the blood of another missing woman on my clothes and in my mouth. That's when I started screaming again.

That was last night. After the cops left the staff sedated mefor a whole to try and calm me down. They said my frequent screaming was upsetting to the other patients.

 I'm sorry I don't have more information and I'm sorry I don't have more answers. I guess the only thing that can be ruled out is that Jane wasn't a demon? Maybe a zombie? I've reached a point where I'm not Scared anymore, just numb I guess.That may be from the sedation thought. I'm stuck in this living nightmare for the foreseeable future but I don't feel anything. It's like I'm watching my own life through a screen - like a shitty horror movie on Netflix that I can pause and walk away from and jump back into my normal life whenever I want. 
I'll post again once I know more or as soon as more weird stuff happens, Until then stay safe out there guys.
