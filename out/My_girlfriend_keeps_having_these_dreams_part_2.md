The walk to school was only about 20 minutes or so away from my house, so it’s good to get my steps in, I guess. I do enjoy the fall days, though. October is my favorite month, with the leaves changing, every morning being filled with the cool air, it all comes together to make the perfect season. As I’m taking in the same scenery I’ve seen almost my whole life, the silence is broken by the one person who does it best. 

“Hey, loser, wait up!”

“And a good morning to you too, Ray.”

“How’s my favorite wimpy little virgin doing?”

“Oh, I know you’re not one to talk. You’re right there along with me.”

“Really? Says who?”

“Please, Kenzie is the only girl who can stand you. And I know you haven’t done anything with her cuz she tells my girlfriend things and my girlfriend tells me those things.”

“Wow, such betrayal. I thought I knew her.” I could hear him chuckling, faking a voice of pain and despair. 

Ray has been my best friend since fourth grade, as do all cliche duos do for some reason. I was a pretty wimpy kid, what elementary schooler wasn’t? One thing he often did to “toughen me up” was this thing he called “training”. It normally involved just me running at him and trying to attack him with everything I had, and he won every single time. But it did teach me not be afraid or hold back, so I guess that’s something. We both grew up without brothers, so we really only had each other. I knew I could always count on him, even with his nonstop blabbermouth.

“Everything good, man? You kinda look like you wanna crawl under a rock and die.”

I guess I couldn’t hide the way my face couldn’t even attempt to fake a smile. I was still a bit shook from what happened last night, and how it correlated with Nikki’s dreams. I decided to keep the scary bit to myself. 

“Eh, it’s just some problems with Nikki.”

“Oof, you guys having some trouble in paradise? ‘Cause if you guys break up, then I know there’s no hope for me and Kenzie.”

“No, it’s nothing like that. It’s just that she keeps having these freaky dreams about this whole other world and she feels like people are watching her and following her. It’s really stressing her out, and now that stress is gonna trickle down to me. So yeah, everything is just peachy.”

“Yeah, that doesn’t sound normal. You try looking it up?”

“Yes, obviously. That’s the first thing I tried, that’s the first thing everyone in our generation always tries.”

“Hey, screw you, I’m just trying to help.”

He looked down and thought for a second. When he looked back at me, his face read that he had and an idea that was bound to sound insane. 

“Ok, listen. This whole situation sounds really freaky and oddly specific. I know this forum on the deep web that might house some people who could have the answer to something like this.”

“You want me to ask for advice from strangers on the dark web? Are you out of your mind?”

“No, it’s the deep web, not the dark web. There’s a difference. The deep web will get you past all those surface level answers. The dark web is where you go to see some really messed up stuff. Like if you wanted to see experiments on corpses, or you wanna see some girl’s head chopped off- whatever, I’m getting off track. The point is, this might help more than whatever you find on page one of Google.”

“How’d you find said forum, anyway? How do you even know what people say there works?”

“Remember all that Xanax I took freshman year? Where’d you think I found out where to get it?”

I do remember well. He kept it a secret for so long but I remember he got so scared he threw it all up within the hour.

I put my tongue in my cheek. “I feel like I might regret listening to you, but I guess it’s worth a try.”

Ray gave me the link to the forum amongst the deep web, and for privacy reasons I obviously can’t share it. The only plan I had was to submit this problem and wait for a response. I would have to do it during a free period so I could at least work out what I would say. 

We arrived at school a good fifteen minutes before the bell, getting to absorb all the school spirit around us. Our class was getting ready for the Fall Blueblossom Dance, it’s like prom, except our school rebranded the whole thing. I’ve said it probably a thousand times but it’s the dumbest names for a dance. Nikki’s really excited for it, though, she’s been looking forward to it for years. Ever since we started dating, she wouldn’t stop talking about it. I’m not too much of a “dance” guy, but as long as I get to spend time with her, I’m sure we can make it a fun night. Hopefully we can get this whole scary dream situation out of the way by then. 

After first period, Kenzie and Nikki are sitting by the window a few feet away. Ray and I went to meet them and Kenzie is the first to notice us. Kenzie was the latest one of our friend group, she started dating Ray about a year ago and naturally clicked with us. She had got dirty blonde hair that she always wore in a braid, and blue eyes like Nikki. It was nice to have a girlfriend at the same time as my best friend, sometimes we went on double dates and other times we’d just hang out with nothing better to do. 

“Hey guys, you heard about the hurricane that might hit us next week?”

Nikki scrunched up her face. “Don’t even bring that up. I swear if that thing comes and ruins the dance-“

I tried to calm her. “It won’t. It’s probably gonna be a level 2 at most, if it even comes our way.”

Ray chimed in. “Yeah, and if it does, it’s not like the whole dance being canceled would be the worst thing ever.”

Kenzie elbowed her boyfriend to check him for the discouraging comment. He raised his hands up in defense. 

“Kidding. I’m kidding. Don’t stress, Nic. We all promised we’d go together, and we will.”

“I really hope so.” Nikki yawned while rubbing the edges of her eyes. 

“Are you sure you’re ok?” Kenzie noticed her drowsy behavior. “I know you said you were fine earlier, but you haven’t stopped yawning since first period.”

Nikki defended herself. “I’m fine, really. I just haven’t been getting that much sleep recently.” She then gave me a quick side eye, clearly wanting me to keep her unique situation to myself. 

I was about to interject anyway, regardless of how much she wanted to keep it to herself, until I was interrupted by the next bell. Our group split up for the day until lunch, meaning I finally had time to write something down in that forum. I figured it’d be best to use my free period, more time to think. I maneuvered my way through chatty students and obnoxious teachers until I reached the library, where I took a seat and pulled out my laptop and pulled up the link Ray gave me. If I was going to the deep web, I might as well do it professionally. Stupidly enough, I had to make a whole account to leave a comment. I couldn’t think of any clever name so I just chose “NeedanAnswer32”. Pretty boring, I know, but I wasn’t here to sound cool. I scrolled through different questions and confessions so many random strangers were bold enough to share online, protected by the barrier of anonymity. “How to bring my dog back to life”, “How to sell on the black market”, or my personal favorite, “How to get a ghost to haunt your enemies”. It was a field of crazy people wanting to know crazy things, and I guess now I was one of them. I finally found one specific chat room, “Peculiar Happenings, Visions, and Experiences”. Good enough, I guess. I pondered for a good few minutes to explain my situation, trying to remember the details of Nikki’s dream, and came up with this:

Hello everyone, I'm reaching out because I've been experiencing a recurring nightmare about this Other World. I know this might sound crazy, but it's a desolate and unsettling landscape with ruined cities, and it has dark twisted trees reaching past a crimson sky and I always feel like something is watching me.

The strange part is, I can't find any information about this Other World anywhere, or even what it means. It's like it doesn't exist outside of my dreams. Has anyone else encountered something similar or knows what this might mean? Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated.

When I was finally satisfied, I hit submit. Now all I had to do was wait for a response. 

“Hey, whatcha writing?”

Nikki was peering over my shoulder, I nearly jumped out of my skin before slamming my laptop shut. 

“Nikki, hey! Don’t you have Stats, like, right now?”

“Yeah, we weren’t doing much today and I already finished all the class work I had so Mr. Robinson said I could leave early. Perks of being a senior, remember?”

“Oh right, yeah. Makes sense. You do understand math faster than anyone I know.”

“So, are you gonna answer my question?”

“Question- oh, right. No, I was just, uh, looking up something to help with my English paper.” 

“Well, I can help you if you want.”

“No it’s fine, you’ve practically carried me this whole year. Might as well try to figure this one out on my own.”  

I don’t exactly know why I lied to her. Maybe I just didn’t want to worry her or maybe I didn’t want to give her false hope if I actually didn’t get an answer. Maybe I wanted to sure of what I knew before I stirred anything up. I honestly couldn’t give you any straight answer, it was almost immediate. Not to mention I might have seen something similar to her dream and now it might literally be affecting me too. The last thing I wanna do is make her feel bad for me as well.

The next couple of days were nothing special, except now Nikki was having those dreams every time she dozed off. She described it as seeing flashes of it in her daydreams, and a full on nightmare when she tries to fall asleep. I can tell she’s losing a lot of sleep over it, but she insists she can manage it. I wish I believed her. I sat at my desk, rubbing my temples, the only thing on my mind was Nikki’s well being. It hurts, seeing someone I love going through something destructive and exhausting, and not being able to do a thing about it. I felt so helpless, like a bystander to a horrible tragedy. Could I help, or would I just make it worse? 

I was interrupted by a notification on my laptop. I looked up in the top right corner of my screen, and there it was. 

It was a response. Someone had answered me. 

I rapidly clicked on the notification, automatically opening back up the tab the forum was in. My response came from TG3TheSeeker77. His message was straight to the point. 

*I need you to be 100 percent honest. Is this for real? Are you seriously experiencing this exact dream? Down to the cities, the trees, and the sky?*

He seemed oddly serious, but I really needed whatever answers he could provide. I wrote back:

*Yeah. Well, technically my girlfriend is having these dreams. But it’s really stressing her out and wearing her down. I just need some insight. I can’t find anything online about this type of dream or what it means. Do you have any idea?*

I stared at those three blinking dots for what felt like forever. 

*The reason you can’t find anything on it is because it doesn’t exist. Not in this world.*

*What do you mean “not in this world”?*

*I’m sorry, but this is something I can’t fully explain over a chat room. I can help you, but it’s imperative that we meet. Do you live near the town of Helenium Valley, Oregon?*

*I actually live right in the middle.*

*Perfect, I do too. That makes this much easier. Look, I know we’ve never met, but I swear to you this is not just some dream. There is so much more to this, you have no idea. I can talk to you more about it in detail, we can meet in a mutual spot if it makes you feel safer, but it has to be ASAP.*

I almost declined the offer to meet, but then flashes of Nikki popped in my mind. How her smile was fading, her eyes looked more and more exhausted after every night. Whatever this dream was, it was taking a toll on her. I couldn’t just sit by and let that happen. Plus if I was truly awake and what I saw that same night she told me, then I need answers before I go crazy myself. 

*You know the Maple Leaf Diner on Red Road? The one by the movie theater?*

*Yes I know it. I can meet you there tomorrow evening at 6. Sound good?*

*Yeah. I’ll see you then. *

I close my laptop, and turn to the claw marks engraved into my window, a chilling reminder of whatever horror just creeped into my life.
