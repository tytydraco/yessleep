It's funny, isn't it,
As a person, our natural instinct should be to avoid pain and avoid getting hurt. My natural instinct should be avoiding not relying. But now I'm dead to another person. I'm a deadbeat lover and a deadbeat friend. Most of my friends only talk to me anymore to check up on me cause if I died, it would stay on their consciousness. I can't do that to them, I can't hurt them like all those girls hurt me when they left, all the loves of my life. So again, I'm at home. 

Dazed, I can't tell if it's from the hours of crying or all the extra sertraline pills I took. The digital clock reading 02:30 is gleaming right through me. I'm still thinking coherently enough to read, not good enough. My sleeves already rolled up, so all I need to do is grab the tiny blade. A friend gave me a pencil and a sharpener to try encouraging me to write and pursue my hobby. instead, I dismantled that key he gave me and used its components to carve deeper marks of hubris into my flesh. There's probably some kind of irony there. 

It's cold against my skin, but it's giving its own form of comfort against me, so I push as much as my mind lets me and I pull towards me as quickly as I can. The skin's blank and unphased for a second, and then the red line appears. It clots up, and I feel a sense of relief. It's like a pipe that kept building and building pressure and suddenly got released. I always feel like I'm about to pop. I toy with the wound, opening it a tiny bit more with my fingers so I bleed more, hurt a little longer, and I carve again. My wrist is my canvas, and my razor is my paintbrush.

I know it won't help me, I'm not trying to help me. My life feels shit so I'm adjusting. If I've got interior pain, having it outside too just makes sense, doesn't it? Maybe I'm just deluded. Who isn't? 

My crying, bleeding, and broken state is interrupted by the sound of shuffling coming from the kitchen. It sounded weak, but I pushed my voice out of my throat.

"Hello-?"

No response. Maybe I left the window open, and a gust pushed something to fall. Maybe I was just hearing things that weren't there. The short distraction knocked me out of my delusion for a split second, and I looked at my wrist, thinking of just how far I've let myself fall. Some things never change. 

What would mom have thought seeing me like this? She told me scars were what made a man, a man. Knowing her she'd call me a pussy for taking the easy way. With dad out of the picture, she decided she would play both parental figures. Which started off sweet with a bit of scolding but fell into constant abuse till one day she snapped and told me to leave, it wasn't anything I did. Not that I think so, anyway. Her closet stuffed with needles was stacking up, but she didn't have enough money to keep buying. Feeding another human being is expensive. A week after I left, my grandpa found her dead. Vomit and foam coming out of her mouth. Grandpa told me not to come in, so the image that's trapped in my head is my fault, not like I knew better at twelve.

The thought of my mom dragged me right back into my catatonic state, but as soon as I put the blade against my skin, something called out to me.

"Harvvvveeeeeyyyyyy~"

It sounded like 10 different voices mashed together, but it spoke like it was singular. It sounded melavolent but had a playful tone to it. Out of fear, I tried pulling my hand back to my stomach, but my body did the action before my brain thought it through, and I cut myself deeper than the other wounds. The blood wasn't clotting or leaking. Despite the cut, it started growing like a water balloon being pumped. I glanced over at where I heard the voice while holding my arm and saw nothing. 

I looked down at the cut after feeling a sudden new pain. It stopped getting bigger, but it was about the size of an egg. It felt like the spot was on fire. I tried desperately to not think of the words 'seering' and 'flesh' when suddenly I heard more shuffling from the kitchen. I looked up and saw two gleaming white orbs staring through the window. No, not orbs, eyes. 

"Hello!?"

I blinked and looked back at the window, but it was gone. I looked down at the blood bubble and saw it leaking the red hot liquid down my arm. I heard more shuffling and glanced up and saw a dark figure peaking at me from behind the island in the kitchen. Those gleaming white eyes practically stared through me.

"Harrrvvveeeeeyyyyy, what's wrong Harvey-"

That same sadistic voice called out. I realised the pain on my wrist was flaring up more, I looked down and saw it was leaking a black fluid instead of red. Whatever it was, it was warm and leaking down my wrist onto my bed covers. 

"Wha-what the fuck-"

I mumbled to myself, I looked back towards the kitchen but froze up as I saw the thing had moved again. Standing in front of the island, staring dead at me. It wasn't quite a human outline. It was like a cloud of mist that was a deeper black than the darkness of the kitchen. Its form was apparent, but it was bubbling and shifting like the shape was struggling to hold itself. And, of course, those gleaming white eyes were where the face should be. 

"I'm just watching. Don't stop because of me, crybaby."

I looked at the figure, confused at what it wanted, but acknowledging it was probably in my head. But what if it wasn't? What if it was real? How would I know? I put my hand over the leaking wound and sat to face the figure, but while I turned, it shifted position again. I couldn't see it anymore. Where was it? 

The figure scared me out of my turmoil, and I decided that it was probably time to go to bed. Worst case scenario, I can at least drink myself to sleep tomorrow. I turned the flash on my phone and briefly looked around my surroundings to see if anything was there, nothing. It was probably just the stress, crying, pills, whatever. I turned it off for a second and suddenly felt breathing beside my neck and a sharp point against my wrist. 

I looked down and saw a hand. It was covered in a black, steaming, bubbling hot fluid. Like if somebody dipped their hand into tar. The hand had long, sharp black nails that were jabbing into my skin even without pressure. This wasn't a hallucination. This was real. 

"It's rude to stop a show when somebody comes to watch Harvey. Didn't your mother teach you some manners-?"

I shuttered. It sounded like a crowd of spirits whispering into my ear, instead of sounding all jumbled equally like the previous times it spoke, it sounded mostly female this time, like it was developing into a singular set voice. It suddenly pushed the finger in deeper. It wasn't clean and quick like a razor blade. It was a slow, rough, burning sensation. 

I cried out and tried moving away, but the thing pushed its nail deeper into me while using the rest of its hand to grab my entire wrist, while using its other hand to grab my mouth and pull me back while keeping me quiet.

"Shh, shh, this is what you wanted, isn't it? I'm just helping you out a little, that's all-"

I squirmed more, but my body wasn't moving. It kept its nails the same depth but started pulling further down my wrist, leaking more black fluid out of me. I started kicking with my legs, but I was too panicked to think properly, so I just kicked the ground to cope with the pain and hope it would end soon. It moved down low enough for me to be able to see inside of my arm. Instead of flesh or bone, all I saw were black tubes moving and circling around the inside of my arm like worms covered in oil. I couldn't feel them, but seeing them put me in even more of a state of panic, and I tried jumping up away and succeeded. Using the edge of my bed to throw myself away from the figure and onto the ground.

As soon as I did, I quickly turned to my bed, and it was gone. I crawled over to the kitchen, trying to get to the light switch, I can't explain it, but I had a feeling that if I could just turn on the lights, I'd be safe. As soon as I made it right under, I tried reaching for it with my uncut hand but failed to reach it. I tried standing up, but as soon as I did, I felt something grab both of my hands. It felt like boiling hot liquid against my skin. I tried turning around but got pushed against the wall instead. My face just above the light switch.

"I could make it all go away in a matter of seconds, Harvey. You have no idea what I'm capable of~"

It suddenly threw me across the room into the wall just next to the door of the apartment. I felt the pressure hit my spine at once, then shockwave throughout the rest of my body as I made contact with the floor. I coughed up blood and glanced at the figure. It was back to its shadow form and staring at me from beside the light switch. It started gurgling until the voice shifted from sounding like multiple voices, to one. Mom's voice.

"Oh Harvey, Harvey, Harvey, whatever will we do with y-"

The thing got cut off by the sounds of heavy knocking on the door and a raspy but caring English voice calling for me.

"Oi Harvey! 
I came to check up cause you weren't answering your calls, but it said you were online on whatsapp, and now I heard noises, and"

The voice rambled. Sounding nervous and clearly worried, poor Todd. I must've left the computer on while scrolling through my old text messages and weeping, but why couldn't I hear any calls? My phone was on, wasn't it? Was it the figures' fault? I stared at it in the eyes.

"W-was that you-?"

Suddenly, Todd started hitting against the door harder, probably mistaking my question to the figure for a plea.

"Harvey, Hey, Open up, come on, please, man."

I started slowly rising up to reach for the latch and unlock the door. It started shouting more aggressively in my mother's voice but had an added distortion like it was enraged.

"If you touch that latch, I will take him down with you, IF YOU TOUCH THAT LATCH, I WILL TAKE HIM DOWN WITH YOU."

It repeated over and over. I quickly moved my undamaged arm up to the latch while the figure started screaming and rapidly hovering towards me. Just as soon as I got the latch open, Todd pushed the door open, letting in light from the corridor. The figure vanished.

I didn't sleep the rest of that night, and neither did Todd. I didn't tell him what I saw because I'd rather he thought I was suicidal again rather than going crazy. It's the following night. I'm on Todd's couch after a day out together. I'm writing this down because I stopped hearing Todd's snoring an hour ago, His doors slightly open.

And I see two white eyes staring at me through them.
