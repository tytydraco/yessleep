The marshrutka broke down twice before it even reached the coast. The driver, a dark-skinned Russian from the Caucasus mountains, lit cigarettes one after another, blowing smoke into the frost-crusted windshield of the collective taxi as if that could warm the engine.

By the time we rolled through the gates of Sanatoriy Parovoye Dykhanie, evening had already smeared the sky with ash.

The compound crouched above a drained salt lake, a cluster of white concrete blocks stitched together by covered corridors. Paint flaked from the slogan over the arch:

"HEALTH IS THE WORK OF THE COLLECTIVE."

The letters oozed rust down the wall, as if the concrete itself had consumption.

I'd come for winter employment, temporary maintenance and boiler duty. My factory back home had "paused production for optimization," which meant half the worker force  was cut loose. I told myself that a few months of quiet work by the sea would be good for the lungs.

The sea, however, was nowhere to be seen. A sheet of brine stretched to the horizon, solid as a mirror, dusted with sand and the frozen bodies of jellyfish.

**The Condensation Room**

Inside the sanatorium, warmth hit me like a slap. The walls sweated. A smell of boiled minerals and disinfectant hovered in the air, thick as syrup. Steam curled from the ceiling vents , coiling lazily like cigar smoke.

At reception sat a woman in a tired wool cardigan and rubber apron. Her name tag read "Comrade Solyava Marina". The radio on her desk sputtered a patriotic march about "the homeland's eternal spring and the salt of the earth" Without looking up, she handed me a clipboard slick with moisture.

"Sign here, Comrade. You will report to Dr. Krapivin, chief physician, and acting director. And do not mind the leaks. The walls are old but patriotic!"

She smiled at her own joke, then coughed wetly into a handkerchief. The sound echoed through the empty tiled lobby like water draining from a sink.

Dr. Krapivin found me unpacking my cardboard suitcase in the so-called maintenance quarter, a narrow, spartan room barely large enough to hold a rigid military-style cot and a small metal locker. Short and compact, he wore a white lab coat patched at the elbows, and his hair, once black, had been dyed in a half-hearted attempt at vanity; the color had bled unevenly, staining his temples like a faded memory.

"You'll find the boilers temperamental," he said. "The pipes speak their own dialect. We heed their complaints, and they obey ... well, most of the time."

He laughed, but the sound lacked humor. Condensation glistened on his glasses, though the air was not especially hot in that part of the sanatorium.

"Humidity is our enemy," he continued, "and our treatment. We cannot banish it without banishing hope for our patients."

He handed me a cumbersome chain of rusty keys and a map of the complex: dormitories, dining hall, hydrotherapy wing, solarium, and a small fenced section marked Condensation Room - Access Restricted.

A handwritten red note read: Ventilation calibration pending. Report any moisture anomalies.

"That room is sealed for inspection," Krapivin said, folding the map. "Historical equipment. Leave it alone… but report any unusual activity."

I didn't have time to ask for more. He spun on his heel like a soldier on parade and left the room, leaving me alone among the mops and bleaching supplies.

**The Droplet**

The following days drifted by in dull monotony. Even the sunlight, filtered through frost-coated windows, couldn't pierce the uniform gloom.

During my night shift, making my usual round through the sanatorium, the power faltered once more. The overhead lights stuttered in a nervous rhythm, sputtering between life and extinction, until the corridors were left trembling in half-light. For an instant, the portraits of = Party founders hanging along the walls seemed to blink in and out of existence, their impeccable smiles flickering with the current.

After closer inspection I noticed droplets inside the corridor light bulbs, tiny oceans that drifted toward the filament and swirled lazily when I tapped the glass.

I took my flashlight and descended the concrete stairwell to the boiler room. The air grew warmer, thick with vapor. My breath condensed instantly, vanishing into the fog. Down there, everything sweated: the pipes, the valves, even the floor tiles. The metal surfaces gleamed as though coated in a transparent varnish of human perspiration.

Somewhere beneath the noise of my own footsteps, a rhythmic hum resonated through the plumbing. Steady, intimate, unmistakably human in cadence. I felt a sudden, foolish heat rise to my cheeks.

On the wall beside the furnace, a faded poster still clung to the plaster: "Labor brings warmth to the Motherland!" Its edges curled and blackened from years of heat; the smiling worker's face now blistered with soot.

The thermometer read thirty-five degrees Celsius, yet the water pressure gauges danced erratically. Something trickled onto my wrist. I wiped it off; the droplet shimmered milky-white, sticky like diluted oil. When I rubbed it between my fingers, it released a scent: citrus peel and disinfectant, and beneath that, faint women's perfume.

By morning, a rash bloomed where the drop had touched.

**The Guests**

Only a handful of guests remained that winter. Pensioners mostly, veterans of mines and cement factories, their lungs etched by decades of dust and honest Soviet labor. They drifted through the corridors like spent ghosts, wrapped in identical grey robes issued by the sanatorium. Most dragged behind them a small oxygen tank on squeaking wheels, the transparent tubing snaking into their nostrils like an umbilical cord tethering them to the building itself.

Sometimes, watching them shuffle past in the hallway light, I found myself imagining what would happen if those fragile rubber cords were severed. In my mind, they floated upward at once, slow and soundless, swelling like drowned men rising from a flooded shaft, faces pale, limbs weightless, until they brushed against the stained ceiling tiles and remained there, gently bobbing, half-human balloons filled with the last breath of the Motherland.

One patient stood apart: Parova Elena, Room 217. According to Marina's hushed reports, she had formerly been a perfumer of some renown for Moscow's upper circles before a scandal, never fully explained, had sent her abruptly into obscurity. Her "collapse", the polite euphemism for what some suspected was a nervous breakdown or an ideological faux pas better left unrecorded.

Years of inhaling solvents and rare essences had left Elena's lungs fragile, and now each winter, she arrived with the precision of party-mandated inspections, ostensibly for "Aroma therapy" though no such option existed on the treatment menu.

I first saw her in the dining hall, leaning over her bowl of soup. Her fine hair was the color of wet plaster, and her eyes had that pale green film people get after months of mineral air. When she caught me watching, she smiled, revealing a set of pearl-white teeth that gleamed almost too perfectly.

"You are our new janitor. I could smell fresh paint on your hands."

Her voice was low, almost velvety, a strange contrast to the coughing choir around us.

I'd only just arrived, I said, my voice uncertain. She nodded, amused.

Then she noticed my hand, absent-mindedly scratching at the damp patch on my forearm where the droplet of condensation had left a faint rash.

"Ah," she murmured, tilting her head, "you've met our friend."

I glanced at her, unnerved. Her smile had hardened into something sharp, predatory.

"Soon, it will know your name," she whispered.

I left her to her borscht and compote, uncertain of the cryptic meaning behind her words.

**The Vapor bath**

The next morning, the sanatorium smelled different. More… alive. Each step I took left prints on the floor tiles, and when I turned back, I could see them linger for a second too long, as if the moisture remembered my presence.

This day my assignment was to clean the hydrotherapy wing. The corridor leading there was tiled in green enamel, cracked like a dried riverbed. Halfway down, a small, tarnished plaque announced the Condensation Room; its metal door was sealed with wax and stamped with  some Ministry's emblem, the edges of the seal flaking with age.

And at the far end of the hallway stood the Vapor Baths. The baths were crude, relics from the past: concrete basins, chipped enamel, corroded pipes, no automatic regulators. The boiling hot water ran directly from underground springs, heavy with iron and sulfur.

When I entered, I found the surface of the baths shimmering unnaturally, tiny ripples rising without wind. I leaned over and felt droplets climb my arm as if the water itself was reaching. The smell was now unmistakably human, sui generis,  a mixture of sweat, perfume, and a faint metallic tang that reminded me of old dental offices.

"You feel it, don't you?"

Elena's voice came from the doorway. She had entered silently, her shadow merging with the steam.

"The baths remember us. They remember everyone who ever sank into them."

Her pupils looked dilated, drowned.

Still wrapped in her bathrobe, she stepped into the water, letting it lap at her wrinkled knees.

"Do not lean over too close," she said. "It likes to take people in."

I asked what she meant. She only smiled and said, "I once distilled the breath of a man who loved me, you know."

Then, without another word, she sank into the bath, vanishing beneath the quivering skin of the water, only her bathrobe left adrift, a pale, bloated ghost upon the surface.

**The Dream**

That night, I dreamed I was standing in the Condensation Room, steam swirling around me like gauze. I woke up choking on moisture. My bedsheets were damp though the radiator was cold.

At breakfast, Dr. Krapivin looked haggard, his dark eyes rimmed with red, the lines on his face deepened by fatigue. He stirred his cold Georgian tea absently and muttered, "We must reduce the humidity. Too much condensation… corrodes the records."

He didn't mean only paper, I thought.

Then Elena Parova entered the dining hall, and a ripple of murmurs passed through the other residents, her presence impossible to ignore. Her cheeks glimmered softly, as if a pale, inner light glowed just beneath her skin.

"Do you smell the change?" she asked softly. "It's ripening."

Krapivin slammed his cup onto the table, rattling the chipped porcelain. "Enough, Comrade Parova! You are here for treatment, not poetry!"

She turned to him with a smile that carried something like pity. Somewhere in the distance, a radiator sighed, long and low, and I felt, rather than heard, the walls exhaling in response to her presence.

**The Incident**

A week later, a patient broke into the Condensation Room during the dead hours of the night.

The nurses found him the next morning, kneeling on the floor amid the thick, curling steam; Eyes wide and unblinking, suspended in a strange, almost religious ecstasy. His chest rose and fell in slow, reverent inhalations;. His pallid lips were pressed against the ventilation vent, as if attempting to drink the mist itself.

When the nurses finally managed to drag the pensioner toward the door, his body went rigid, as if welded from the inside. He suddenly refused to breathe under his own power; his chest remained frozen, each rib a stubborn shard of bone resisting life itself. His lips pressed into a tight seal, like a child in the midst of a tantrum. A tremor ran through his jaw, while his face darkened in an unnatural gradient, first a bruised purple, then a deep, lifeless blue, the color of veins stripped of air and warmth.

The nurses worked quickly, one pressing a small syringe against the old man jugular. Almost immediately, the tension melted. His chest began to rise and fall again, slowly at first, as if learning to breathe for the first time. The tremor in his jaw eased, and his lips unclenched, curling into a slack, infantile shape, like that of an octogenarian suddenly reborn: a fragile, translucent infant relearning the rhythm of life.

At least, that was what Elena recounted later, in her slow, measured way, as if reading from the latest decadent gossip magazine smuggled from the West. I hadn't witnessed the collapse myself. She spoke with detached fascination, her lips curling in that same enigmatic half-smile. I left the reception hall unsure whether it had truly happened or if she had spun the tale to make a fool of me.

Even so, I dutifully scribbled in my diary: Unusual pensioner activity, Condensation Room. The words felt inadequate.

**The Pilgrimage**

After the incident, I began to notice strange it.

More and more pensioners drifted toward the Condensation Room, moving through the corridors like fish lured by the eerie glow of a deep-sea angler. Their grey robes hung limply, dampened by condensation. Each frail figure bore the weight of past glories: battle medals pinned haphazardly across sunken chests, ,as if recalling the long-forgotten grandeur of some great war parade. Some medals swung with each uneven step, clinking softly, a mournful percussion that merged with the hiss and wheeze of their trailing oxygen tanks.

Eyes glazed and unseeing, they murmured fragments of old slogans "За Родину! За труд!" or lines from forgotten patriotic songs, voices weaving together into a ,ghostly chant that seemed to pulse in harmony with the low hum of the rusty pipes itself.

Some paused at the steel door, hands hovering inches above the cold metal, as if searching for a heartbeat hidden behind the panel. Others pressed their pallid faces to the small glass windows, their lips trembling like leaves in a bitter wind.

Even I could feel the pull of the vapor, subtle at first, then insistent, curling around ankles and sleeves, tugging at the mind like a slow, merciless current.

During the day, thoughts became sluggish, memories of the sanatorium's past glory intruding unbidden: the echo of young pioneer chants, the smell of fresh linen and industrial soap. I could almost hear the room whispering; suggesting, promises of warmth, of surrendering entirely to its embrace. It called, urging one to dissolve into the vapor, until body and mind were no longer separate from the humid, glimmering air.

**The Abandonment**

By day ten, it had become painfully clear that Dr. Krapivin and most of the nursing staff had deserted the sanatorium. The corridors, once alive with the loud clatter of nurses' sabots, now lay in a suffocating hush, broken only by the slow breath of the pipes, a mechanical respiration that seemed to keep the place itself alive.

Surprisingly, the sanatorium's routines persisted like a parody of order: breakfast served at seven, medication at eight.

But the mood had changed. The pensioners were no longer docile. They gathered in the dining hall beneath the yellowed portraits of Lenin and Pavlov, plates of grey porridge steaming faintly, eyes glinting with a strange defiance. Someone slammed a spoon against a tin tray. Another muttered, "They've left us to rot," his breath forming mist that hung in the air too long, refusing to dissipate.

Soon the muttering became a rhythm. "We'll take it back," one croaked. "We built this country. We built this place. We earned it."

A chorus of wet, phlegmy voices rose in reply, part revolutionary chant, part death rattle. One of them, an old artillery captain with trembling hands, stood and declared they would "break the welds" on the Condensation Room. "The doctors sealed it, but we were the ones who fought at Kursk. We know how to handle such things."

A ripple of grim laughter followed. The vapor had begun to influence conversation, turning old grievances into revolutionary zeal, reanimating their faded pride into something feverish, half-mad. By the end of breakfast, several had risen from their seats,, muttering of justice, reclamation, and rebirth.

I stood by the samovar, pretending to polish the metal, as they argued. A faint smell of burnt kasha and old butter drifted from the kitchen, a ghost of warmth from some vanished breakfast past. It brought to mind winter mornings of youth: sweet syrniki frying in sunflower oil, steam fogging the kitchen windows while a mother's voice hummed a tune from the radio. The memory flickered and vanished, leaving only the metallic taste of the present.

And I saw the steam rising from the Samovar spout coil in slow, deliberate spirals, moving, it seemed, in the direction of the Condensation Room. I knew, then, that the mutiny was not theirs alone.

**The file**

Breaking into Dr. Krapivin's office was absurdly easy, as if the locks themselves had lost faith in authority.

The desk sagged under stacks of folders swollen with moisture, their spines warped into grotesque, grinning shapes. I pried one open carefully. The pages were yellowed, mushy. Reports from the 30s described a medical experiment intended to "stimulate immune and cognitive regeneration through inhalation " But marginal notes, scrawled in a trembling hand, hinted at phenomena far beyond conventional medicine.

\## Executive Summary

There exists beneath the foundation of the sanatorium an organism preserved in permafrost and geological strata. Local oral history and fragmentary archaeological traces indicate this organism was known to the first nomad tribes of the taiga. They constructed a shallow stone enclosure/temple directly above the site. 

Modern observation showed that ambient vapor rising from the enclosure possessed curative properties when diluted and administered in controlled aerosol form. Early experimentsdemonstrated accelerated convalescence in subjects with chronic respiratory insufficiency, marked reduction in denervation-related tremors, and significant episodic recovery of long-suppressed mnemonic traces.

\## Soviet Intervention & Medicalization 

The State erected the sanatorium atop the ritual site .Ministry scientists, ldesigned extraction and delivery systems: steam augmentation, aerosol carriers  and supervised inhalation protocols.

Addendum: With incremental climatological fluctuation and deeper civil engineering (foundation repairs, heating ducts), the thermal envelope around the preserved organism was altered. As the enclosure warmed, the steam's composition shifted.

Annotation (pencil, frenzied):  It learns our faces, our songs. It will wear us like a garment if we permit it. M.K.

The rest of the documents were fused into a mulch of paper and ink, a sticky mass that seemed almost organic. I sank to the floor in a mixture of disbelief and vertigo, staring at the grotesque pile, my mind unable to parse the fragments of truth that emerged between the heavily redacted passages.

**The Collapse**

When I finally emerged from my stupor, the sanatorium had spiraled entirely into madness. Condensation was everywhere now, dripping from ceilings and gathered on the backs of chairs like sweat on fevered skin. Large fungal blooms festered across the walls in grotesque patterns, twisting into shapes that suggested maps of imaginary countries.

Down the corridors, the pensioners had divided into ideological factions, each claiming to be the rightful heir of some long-forgotten commissariat. Voices hoarse from chanting lost slogans. They dragged gurneys, wheelchairs, and enamel bedpans to construct barricades that trembled under their weight. In the dining hall, a grotesque semblance of governance had taken hold: a puppet tribunal, staffed by feeble old men, scrawled imaginary sentences on crumpled scraps of toilet paper. The air smelled of mildew and old sweat. Everywhere the condensation ran in sticky rivulets along the walls.

It was Elena who explained it to me in a way my brain could comprehend as we crouched together in my quarters, trying to avoid the "Отряд смерти," a pack of gnarled old men patrolling the corridor with the precision of military automata.

"It is the breath of an ancient god," she said. Her eyes glimmered like ice reflecting a hidden fire. "He has lain beneath the permafrost for centuries, beneath the foundation of this sanatorium, and when he wakes, even just a little, his breath rises. And we remember…"

Later she begged me to take her to the Condensation Room. Dr. Krapivin had forbidden it, saying her lungs couldn't stand the humidity. But she insisted.

"I have served the Party," she said , her words rising and falling like a chant. "Do not deny me this final… communion!" Her hands shook as she gripped the handle of her oxygen tank.

"I was trained among the great and the decaden !" she continued, voice thick with longing for a Russia of gilded salons and secretive soirées, where aristocratic perfume lingered above the vodka-soaked factories below.

"The Condensation Room is the only place that remembers me! Please Anton… open its door" she murmured, her plea nearly drowned in the hiss and groan of the radiators.

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I relented.

Later that day, I manipulated the heavy locking mechanism, the steel door whining in protest. Elena's smile was immediate, radiant, unsettling, her eyes catching the dim light like molten amber.

The room responded immediately to that offering. The condensation on its walls began to ripple, forming shapes, faces of long-dead commissars, heroic laborers frozen mid-stride, Lenin's angular silhouette, but then these images twisted, features liquefying into grotesque parodies of pride and devotion. The vapor seemed alive, pressing against her flesh, slipping beneath the fabric of her robes, seeping into her pores.

I stepped back, uncertain whether I had performed an act of mercy or of madness. The door hissed closed behind her, the locks engaging with a finality that seemed almost ceremonial.

**The Escape**

I ran.

The tiled corridors had become unrecognizable, drowned in a mist so thick it seemed to have curdled into lukewarm porridge. . The sanatorium's familiar geometry had buckled under the strain of humidity; once-straight hallways now swelled and sagged, their walls bulging obscenely, like the bellies of pregnant women on the verge of birthing something nameless. The floors tilted and heaved like dunes of enamel and mildew, groaning softly with each shift .

Breathing was an act of violence. The air clung to my lungs with a humid greed, whispering softly inside my chest, as though testing the shape of my breath, trying to imitate it. The smell was overpowering, a fusion of boiled disinfectant and something sweet, almost maternal, like heated milk gone sour. My throat burned. My heartbeat sounded foreign, a hollow thud echoing through cotton.

Every noise was muffled: the creak of floorboards, the wet sigh of a radiator, the far-off metallic drip of condensation hitting enamel bed pans. Somewhere, an old propaganda speaker crackled to life, exhaling a fragment of a forgotten march before dying again into static. T

And then, just as I stumbled into the entrance lobby, I heard it. Behind me, the soft wheeze of Elena's oxygen tank.A breath answering my own.

She emerged at the corner of the corridor, her silhouette stretched and warped by the mist. Her eyes burned through the vapor, twin beads of feverish ecstasy.

"Come," she whispered, voice sliding into my ear like a slick finger. "Just one inhale… just one…"

I kept running, I ran across frost-bitten gravel, past the rusted playground s, past the skeletal trees of the once-pristine garden. The echoing pipes and the low hum of the sanatorium followed me, even when I turned corners and scrambled over dacha fences.

By the time I reached the dirt road leading toward the coast, the building was gone from sight, but I could still feel the condensation. Droplets clung to my skin and hair, invisible tendrils burrowing deep into my pores.

I knew it would spread. It wouldn't be confined to the sanatorium. The vapor, patient and ancient, would crawl through the ground, the pipes, the very air, waiting for the next breath to claim.

\*

Much later, I made one last entry in my diary: Escaped. Condensation Room breached. Sanatorium lost. Memory and body compromised. Humanity… negotiable.

And yet, even as I write this now, I feel it. The doctor named it something sterile, some long, Latinate word for a cancer he could classify and forget: Pulmonary carcinoma.

But I know better.

A faint tug deep in my lungs, discreet, almost courteous, as though the vapor itself is greeting me, an intimate, patient whisper, promising that the next breath will be… unforgettable.
