My dad used to work for the military “supply-chain repair,” or something like that. His projects were assigned all around the country, which meant my family had to move around a lot. I basically grew up eating at highway diners and late-night buffets, living in motels, small two-bedroom apartments, and if we were lucky, a rental house with a big kitchen area.

His assignments always took two to three weeks. The only cities where we stayed for more than a month were New Orleans and Salem. Salem was his last job … after that, he quit. That same day he told us he was a mess. I’m not sure what happened on that last job, but something got to him. We left town during the night and kept driving for days, stopping to sleep in the shadiest motels. I’m not sure Dad ever slept. Every night, when I woke up, he was frozen, sitting still at the edge of his bed, looking at the door… waiting for something.

Two months later we arrived in El Paso, Texas.  
Six months later my mom left.  
Nothing ever came.

That was one year ago.

I’m still home-schooled, learning over the weekends and getting ready to present my SATs by next summer. I help out around the house with chores like cleaning, cooking, and doing laundry. My dad doesn’t like people coming over, in fact he doesn’t like talking to anybody.

Dad found a job at a “vulcanizadora” (a tire repair shop, for you gringos). He leaves me alone every day from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. That’s when I use his computer he doesn’t know I’ve figured out his password. The books I use to study are old; the youngest one is from the 1980s, so I always have to double check things online.

Texan nights during October are normally mild, especially in a border town like ours, but last night it was freezing. I woke up at around 2 a.m., shaking. I could see my own breath and hear the windows cracking from the cold.

Something was off.

I couldn’t go back to sleep. There was an emptiness in the air, I could hear my own blood scraping through my veins. Some time later, I heard a loud *BANG* coming from downstairs, followed by my dad’s muffled voice shouting something. It made no sense to me, just gibberish. My reflexes kicked in and I stood up. I reached for the door, and as I opened it, my mind went black.

Next thing I knew, it was morning. I hurried downstairs, but there was no sign of my dad. The only thing I saw was a note on the fridge that said:

**“Do not go down to the basement.”**

“What the fuck happened last night?” was the only thought in my head. I knew this wasn’t normal. I had to go down. I just had to.

The door to the basement was locked. It took me forty minutes to open it with a butter knife, accidentally popping one of the pins from the door hinge.

The door unlocked.

I took my time going down the stairs. Our basement is gray and full of cardboard boxes and some flat tires my dad brought home from the shop. There’s an old lightbulb hanging from the center of the room. When I reached the bottom, I flipped the switch on.

As my eyes adjusted to the light, I saw a big shadow with an overwhelming presence. The shadow shrank and centered in the middle of the basement. And then I saw it.

Something was sitting there. Naked. Head covered with a bag.  
On a wooden chair.

The bag looked directly at me. I could feel the eyes analyzing me. It expelled a shriek:  
**“Tiiiii… Tiiii… TRRRRRR!”**  
  
Its body started to twitch, its limbs shortening, its frame twisting. I could hear bones cracking,the creature screaming in pain. Ten minutes passed. I just stood there, unable to move, unable to look away.

Then… its body started changing. Becoming like mine. The birthmark on my right shoulder. The moles in the shape of the constellation my mother used to point out. They appeared. On its shoulder.

Everything became mine. Even the private parts.

I ran. Upstairs. Slamming the basement door with all my strength. The hinges were loose, and the door fell halfway. I didn’t care. I ran to my room and locked myself in.

Hours later, another *BANG!* echoed from downstairs. I rushed down again. The basement door had completely fallen. Must have been the loose hinges, right?

It’s 7 p.m. as I write this, and my dad is still not home.

**Update:** He just arrived. I’m logging off to talk to him. He seems… off. He hasn’t said a word.
