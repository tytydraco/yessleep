 LOG 1: May 6, 2022

 Condition: Good


 Hello again. It's Scientist Mark Lion. I am now in the tank on the exact same day the prisoners were in. Before the second trial of this experiment me and a couple of colleagues who are also doing this with me studied the original experiment. We made sure for them to put us in the same places of the 3 prisoners that disappeared. Oh? Your also wanting to know what happened to the other two? Well they died. A human being can only go 3 days without eating and two days without water. So me and my colleagues decided that the disappearances of the other 3 were selective. I told my wife and son that i will be gone for a few days. That is a lie. If I don't find out the cause that made Greg Robinson and the others disappear I'll surely die of either dehydration or starvation. I took Robinson's advice and worked out while I am down here. Felt good. Well that will be all for today's log. Logging out.

 It is now my second day. Mostly all I did was listen to yesterday's log and stared out into the ocean. The wildlife running about out there makes you feel almost trapped in here. I worked out again. Felt the burn in my muscles. After tomorrow I'll take a rest day. Which i learned from a fitness coach. Hope you won your basketball game today son. I didn't forget it. Love you Cheri. I love you both. Logging out.

 Cheri I saw a whale! It was enormous! I mean I know what a whale is but I never saw one this close! The tail brushed against the tank but other than that I'm fine! Did the workout today. Now I am feeling sore. Jamar I hope you are doing your chores and helping your mother. Logging out.

 Doing nothing for rest sure doesn't make me feel good. I'm also running out of supplies. That means after tomorrow I'm gonna be preparing myself to die. It is what I should do anyway. We killed them prisoners. I know they are bad people but still they are human beings just the same. Just like Robinson I only see the dark depths. I'm not afraid though. This means that there is nothing to distract me. I love you my wife and son. Logging out.

 It is now the 5th day. I will be eating the last of my rations today as well. If the audio logs stop that means I will probably be dead. This will be hells punishment on me. I'm sure the other two scientists are thinking the same thing. I will pray for my forgiveness throughout these upcoming terrible days. I love my family. I hope you thrive and prosperity when i am gone. I also exercised today. Well I'm logging off. 


 LOG 6: May 10, 2022

 Conditions: Medium


 Signs of hunger are already starting to all me. Can't hardly finished the exercises today. I'm just reliving my family memories. Sitting in and watching the darkened waters outside sure doesn't help. Well I'm going to log out. 


 LOG 7: May 11, 2022

 Condition: Bad


 Oh god the hunger. My stomach is killing me. It is now the 7th day. All I did was lay down because of the stomach pains. I know your thinking why not I just call this thing off? Well it's because I was the one that recommended Robinson. Just like how the other two recommended the others. It's an act of self clarity. An act of self rightous judgment. Again to my family i love you and you all mean the world to me.

 Oh my god I heard them! I heard the voices! While I was sure to die of hunger and dehydration the voices talked to me! I thought that maybe it was just me going crazy but it reassured me I wasn't! I asked the voices what it was and it said it will reveal itself to me once I follow the same steps the inmates did. Oh my god Cheri I'll be with you and our son again soon! I love you both very very much! Logging out!

 Alright I did it! I did what it asked me to do! I don't care about the loss of blood though. It congratulated me when i finished! It has been half an hour now. Wait, I hear it talking to me again! It says that it knows I was one of the people that brought the others down here. They said that they don't know how we found it. But it is thanking me for the meal. Meal? Does it think I am food? Oh my god what is happening! No please no not like this! My skin is dissolving right in front me! There is no pain. I'm glad of that but I don't want to be food! I want to be with my family! Oh god now it's got all my arm gone! Please if you all hear this please tell my wife and my son! Tell them not to go near the ocean oh god! Now my whole right side is gone! Please god have mercy….! 


 *******************************************


 I open my mouth in horror as my dad's screams filled the room until the audio cuts off. I look at the lawyer in front of me. 


 "Are you serious? This is how my dad "died"? 


 The layer with a stern and serious face nods his head at me. "Whenever they pulled your father out of the ocean he wasn't in the tank." 


 I still didn't believe him. "Are you sure your telling me everything that happened?" 


 Again with that stern look he shakes his head as he gets up. "You don't have to believe it if you don't want to, you can tell other people because they won't believe it. All we know is that your dad along with the scientists and death row inmates were never found even with an underwater drone search." 


 I fall back in my chair in disbelief. 


 "Don't think that your dad left you nothing. All the money he left you two was to pay for your mother's cancer treatments. I done told her in the hospital this morning before I came to you." He then starts to head out towards the front door. 


 I run up to him and grabbed his shoulder. "What did she say?" I already felt the burn of tears in my eyes. 


 He then looks back at me. He then smiled and said,"your mother just smiled and looked up at the roof and said that she hopes Mr. Lion's didn't suffer and that hopefully she will be with him soon". He then opened the door and left as I watched him get into his black car and drove away. 


 To all of you who hoped that my father was doing well I am afraid to inform you he is not with us. All I know is that we should take his dying wishes and know that we shouldn't never go in the ocean.
