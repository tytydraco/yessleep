Ever wondered what happens when you die? Wonder no longer, and find out exactly what it's like to die firsthand!

I stared at the dark red letters on the screen. Whoever made the mod sure felt edgy while writing it's description. Though, I suppose when you're talking about experiencing death first-hand, the subject matter is macabre enough to excuse any and all blood red text or Thriller font choices that are paired with it.

I stared over at my NeuraLink which I'd left on the bed. "Take VR one step further," the tagine on the box read. The thing was heavy enough to cause neck strain if you kept it on for too long, especially with the electrode box dangling from the back of the head mount.  
Still, strapping on the helmet and connecting the sticky pads with copper wires running through them did provide what they'd boasted: an experience unlike any other.

I can recommend getting one for yourself, if you don't have one yet. Of course, the thing jacking into your nervous system at first feels weird, but playing an open world game and *feeling* the wind breeze past your skin, it's... I can't explain it.  
Oh, and the people that complain about the pain are either exaggerating or missed the thing to exceed its safety limiters. A shotgun blast to the face feels like getting hit in a pillowfight if everything is on default settings.

What I don't recommend, is doing what I did and messing with the settings. Yeah, the potential for porn is amazing, especially when you use some of those programs to jack up sensitivity beyond 100%.   Do read the reviews though. I've heard of a few that turn pleasure into nausea, just to mess with you.

But once you get into porn, you end up craving more, or at least I did. Weirder things.  
What it feels like to have sex as a woman. Getting in a VR fistfight without the pain limiters. Being waterboarded (really didn't like that one.)  
And eventually, you end up right where I did: reading about a VR recording of someone dying. Was it real or recreated? Why wasn't it taken down yet? Was it just some sort of joke? A bunch of those thoughts ran through my head, but in the end, curiosity won me over. I did the one thing I never should've done:  
I clicked Download.

A bit of setup later and I was lying down on my bed (helps with the neck pain), booting into the sim.  
I opened my eyes and, I'm ashamed to admit, recognized the room. If you've ever summed RoHeDo45, you know what I'm talking about. If not, just imagine some creep sitting in his basement pumping out sim after sim of tortureporn, regular porn, and... regular torture. He always uses the same backdrop, though. It's kind of a staple of his.

I find out I'm strapped down to the bed - it's usually better that way. More immersive since most of these sims don't go as far to actually build in motion tracking so you can move around. You're more of a camera with legs for them.  
An old, bald man with a bushy trucker's mustache steps out of the darkness to the left. I know it's fake, but my hair still stood up when I noticed the Colt in his hand.    
Yeah, so no buildup, the sim gets straight to business.

His first shot goes into my leg, and I could feel every excruciating inch the hot lead rips through my flesh and muscle. I make sure to have a mouth protector in these days after nearly biting my tongue off once. I reminded myself the pain isn't real, and felt it slowly ebb away.  
That's one thing the NeuraLink isn't great at, continuous intensity. The short burst of an orgasm is fine, but a bulletwound like that stops hurting after just as long. I'm sure it'll get patched at some point by a modder, but I have to admit I'm rather fond of the bug for now.  

I wasn't afforded much time to think, as the next shot burrowed itself into my gut. That spot always hurt. Plenty of vital organs, and your intestines really don't like having all their neurons fire off warnings at once, even if they're fake. Still, I calmed myself, steadied my breathing, and watched as the old man lined up the gun right between my eyes.

And I... took it off. I ripped off the headset and the pads, and was returned to my dark, but safe bedroom in the middle of the night. I heard the bang of the gunshot through the headphones of the NeuraLink which dangled from the side of my bed.  
I was panting, lying in a pool of my own sweat, all in all just not having a good time.  
I'm pretty sure I ended up with some mild, temporary PTSD, because I kept thinking that old man from the sim was in the room with me. My real room, not the virtual one. Not the first time I come out of a sim all panicked though, and a couple of breathing exercises later I felt fine again. 

Yeah, I know what you're thinking, that I'm a pussy. But don't worry, I'm getting a good night's rest before trying again. And this time, I won't back out. I'll see it through. So keep your comments to yourself.  
Really, the only reason I'm posting this is as a review of ExperienceDeath.neur, since nobody else has left one yet despite the thousands of downloads. What, is getting killed that good that you're too hooked to write a review?

I won't fail you guys, though. I promise, tomorrow morning I'll be updating this review with what it's like to experience the full thing, so you don't have to.  
I'm especially curious to find out what happens after the third gunshot, aside from dying of course. When the headphones were hanging off the side of my bed and I was trying to get my breathing under control to calm myself down, I heard something like a voice from them.  
Which is... weird, right? I mean, you're supposed to be dead in the sim, but there's apparently more that comes after.

Anyhow - that's a mystery I'll solve tomorrow. I'm getting tired and it's getting to the point where I'm starting to smell the same burnt gunpowder in the air that I did in the sim. Maybe I should cut back on my NeuraLink time tomorrow after I see this thing through.
