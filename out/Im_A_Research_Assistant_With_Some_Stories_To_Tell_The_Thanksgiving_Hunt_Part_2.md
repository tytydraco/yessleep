&#x200B;

I convinced Paulette to let me relay what she told me to Stella. I assured her that she would keep her secret. The dream catcher worked. Paulette said it gave her the best night of sleep she’s had in months. I was glad to hear it and figured that meant she was safe from possession.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Unfortunately,  that was only one of several problems that needed dealing with. I’ll now share what Stella learned from Ira.  A few weeks ago, he was in town for a doctor’s appointment and he overheard some people talking about some murders. Apparently, one guy had been attacked while driving home. The local police found his overturned truck with some bloodstains on the driver's seat.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Then after that, there was a farm family whose house had been broken into. The long story short of that is nobody in the home was found alive.  Reportedly, the deputy who was sent to perform a wellness check on the family threw up upon his discovery.  The youngest was eight.  We discussed this the first night there before going to sleep.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That’s horrible,” I said, trying to keep my hands from trembling again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I hate stating the obvious, but what else can you say in situations like these? Stella shrugged and took another drag. I  should clarify that she wasn’t smoking tobacco.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“This might help you take the edge off.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She offered me some.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m thirteen.”

&#x200B;

“So is Paulette and she had beer.”

&#x200B;

"Wait, how do you know about that? I never told you.”

&#x200B;

“I was checking something by the RV and I saw you two talking through the window I didn’t get the full conversation, though.”

&#x200B;

“But how did you hear it?”

&#x200B;

“I didn’t.”

&#x200B;

“Then how do you know what we said?”

&#x200B;

“Lip reading.”

&#x200B;

“Since when can you do that? Is that part of some extra training by the facility?”

&#x200B;

“No, my girlfriend, Janet’s deaf and she helped teach me.”

&#x200B;

“Oh, cool.”

&#x200B;

“Yeah,  now…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She extended the joint to me. I was hesitant at first, then accepted it and took a drag. I damn near coughed up a lung much to the amusement of  Stella. Eventually, I got the hang of it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“By the way, don’t tell Dean about this,” Stella said.

&#x200B;

“I won’t,” I replied between coughing fits.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I had to admit. It was easing some of my tension.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Better?”

&#x200B;

“Yeah, thanks.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Since I was calmer, I could approach our problem with more clarity. That’s a skill I’ve learned to develop over the years.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Alright, I think we should talk about it,” I said.

&#x200B;

“Yeah,” Stella agreed, “There's corn for miles around here so cannibalism doesn’t seem likely. That only leaves someone being possessed in a dream or they got greedy.”

&#x200B;

“Do you think they could’ve disturbed something? I mean, there could have been some tribes living around here a while back. Maybe somebody came across something they shouldn’t have.”

&#x200B;

“Could be, if that’s the the case, we’d need to figure out who. Right now, we should hit the hay.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We did after a quick late-night meal. The next morning we headed into town to ask if anyone knew who was out hunting in September. It wasn’t feasible to drive the RV around town and therefore we parked it just outside of it. The establishments were nearby so we were able to get around fine by walking.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Alright, Zane, where do you think would be a good place to start?”

&#x200B;

“I don't know, maybe a gun shop or sports store or something like that?”

&#x200B;

“I was thinking the same thing. Now, where would that be around here?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We scanned the area.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What about there?” I pointed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was a store called “Reed’s Rifles & Hunting Goods”.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That could work,” Stella said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Inside the store were all manners of hunting weapons. These included but were not limited to handguns, rifles, and even hours. There were even some bait, lure, and decoy animals. mals.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“This is pretty cool,” I commented, examining a crossbow.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I aimed down the sight, pretending as if I were about to shoot a target.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Zane,” I heard Stella say.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I put the crossbow back and went to her. She was at the currently unoccupied checkout counter. A man came out from the back, eating a sandwich. He finished the last bite before noticing us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Shit, sorry, I hope I didn’t keep you waiting too long,” he said.

&#x200B;

“Not all,” Stella replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We explained why we were there.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I take it you must be Reed?” Stella asked.

&#x200B;

“No, I’m his brother, Clint.”

&#x200B;

“Oh, do you know where we might be able to contact him?”

&#x200B;

“Not unless you believe in seances. I still don't know the full story, but apparently, his truck was found overturned offroad.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Clint’s phone rang.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Do you mind if I take this?” he asked.

&#x200B;

“Go ahead,” Stella replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He stepped away to answer the call.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Reed must’ve been the one who was attacked on his way home,” I said.

&#x200B;

“It sounds like it,” Stella agreed.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, but doesn’t Clint seem a bit, you know, callous about the whole situation?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He came back, putting his phone away.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Sorry again, goddamn telemarketers. Is there anything else I can help you with?” he asked.

&#x200B;

“Just out of curiosity, was your brother the only one who ran the shop prior to you?” Stella inquired.

&#x200B;

“No, we co-owned it. We got this business from our dad.”

&#x200B;

“Sorry for your loss,” I said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Clint’s gaze shifted to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Don’t be. I was doing most of the work anyway so not much has changed.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And here I thought the thing we were after was cold.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Did anyone, maybe from out of town, come in around Labor Day?” Stella asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Clint scratched his chin stubble in thought.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Yeah, there was this one guy, real yuppie, wanted the biggest gun in here to make himself seem tough. You know the type.”

&#x200B;

“Did he happen to mention anything to you that might help us?”

&#x200B;

“Not that I can think of. Wait, he did mention wanting to hunt deeper in the forest. People usually take care not to wander too deep in.”

&#x200B;

“Why not?” I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Clint explained that the town had a bit of legend dating back to the early settlers. The natives living there had already migrated. The settlers unknowingly disturbed sacred land.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Supposedly, a fourth of the people who stumbled across it never came back so people just stay away from there now.”

&#x200B;

“I see,” Stella said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We thanked him for his time and left. Outside, the temperature was beginning to drop.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Our next stop is going to be the forest,” Stella said.

&#x200B;

“I was afraid you’d say that. Should we try to prepare first?”

&#x200B;

“We already have everything we’ll need in the RV. We should try to find the area Clint mentioned before it gets dark.”

&#x200B;

“Could we go there first?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I cocked my thumb at a bakery.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Alright, just make it quick.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With some hot tea and pumpkin spice doughnuts in hand, we headed back to the RV.  We arrived at the location Paulette told me about and parked outside the path.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What should we bring? Only fire and silver can hurt it, right?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“Correct, to kill one a lot of legends say we need to remove the heart and burn the body after salting it, then bury the heart in a silver box on church grounds, but the people back then didn’t have the kind of firepower we do now. A few good shots through the chest with some silver bullets should do the trick.”

&#x200B;

“Well, you sound confident.”

&#x200B;

“I’ve already killed a few of these things. It shouldn’t be an issue.”

&#x200B;

“Right, do I get a weapon?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She provided me with a pistol.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Wow, Dean hasn’t let me use one of these outside of the range.”

&#x200B;

“It’s time to see how good you are then. Remember, me and Mickey trained you. That means if you fuck up I’m going to be disappointed.”

&#x200B;

“Right.”

&#x200B;

“Good, take this.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She handed me a magazine.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“This is filled with silver ammo. If ol’ antlers turns out to be more trouble than we thought, have this handy.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I nodded and took it as well. Saying the names of these kinds of creatures tended to attract them. We planned to lure it and then for Stella to snipe its heart. Sadly, when people plan, God laughs. If there is one, they would’ve been doubling over.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Do you see anything yet?” Stella asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We’d found the campsite Paulette and her friends set up and made a fire there. I was on watch with a pair of night vision binoculars.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“No, not yet, what if it doesn’t show?”

&#x200B;

“It will since we’re near its territory.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was an unopened bag of marshmallows that was left behind. Stella was roasting some and eating them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Aren’t you scared?” I asked her.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She wiped away some marshmallow goo with the back of her hand.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Of course, and the way I see it, if every mission could be my last, why not enjoy myself when I can?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Her answer gave me a lot to think about. It’s the “when” I tend to have trouble with. Stella also found some chocolate bars and graham crackers. She made s’mores and offered me one. I’d only been camping once with Dean before then.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We were trying to follow a possible sasquatch sighting. The short of that experience is it got away. Still, I do enjoy the outdoors, even under the circumstances back then. I accepted the s’more from Stella. Melted chocolate and marshmallow dripped from it, then I took a bite.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How’s that? Feel any better?” Stella asked.

&#x200B;

“A little, yeah, thanks.”

&#x200B;

“Yep, s’mores usually do the trick.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She popped another in her mouth. I glanced through the binoculars again, seeing some animals in the distance, mostly deer and even a few bears. My heart began pumping faster when I realized they were fleeing from something. I tightened my grip.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Stella.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My tone told her everything she needed to know. I heard her get her rifle ready as I tried to locate our target. What I spotted caused my breath to hitch.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Stella, you said you’ve killed several of these things, right?”

&#x200B;

“Yeah, why?”

&#x200B;

“You wouldn’t happen to have meant you took them out all at once. Would you?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She was silent.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How many do you see?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There were six in total, five bald ones, and an antlered one, the latter of which appeared to be commanding them. Shakily, I reported this to Stella.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Nobody said we’d be dealing with a pack. Shit, this is bad. Get your sliver ready.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This was exceptionally rare. A group of these things can only occur when someone who was changed retains a degree of human intelligence. They’re able to command lesser versions of their kind. I did as told and quickly switched out my magazine.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What are they doing?” Stella asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I checked again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“They’re just standing there. I think the leader can see us.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Despite it having no eyes, I still got the sense it was attempting to borrow into me with its glare. It snapped its fingers and the others scurried.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“They’re on the move.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stella’s rifle was equipped with a night vision scope. These things were quick. Fortunately, she was faster and managed to pick two off right away.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Something’s wrong. It shouldn’t have taken more than one shot to put these things down,” Stella said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

These things got stronger the longer they went without food which meant their leader must have been starving them. I cocked my gun. A snapping branch alerted me to one’s presence. The moonlight gave off enough visibility for me to make one out. I squeezed off some shots, getting it in the chest. Once dead,  it crumbled to dust.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Good going, Zane, just stay by the fire and we should be safe.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A streak of lightning flashed in the sky.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Shit,” I heard Stella say.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ice-cold rain poured down, reducing our campfire to embers. The instant they knew it was out, they attacked. One tried pouncing on Stella and she knocked it back with her gun before shooting it. Another tried attacking my blind spot. I spun around to face it and made its body jerk when I squeezed the trigger multiple times.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I think that makes two left,” I said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The leader was on the move. However, there was still another we hadn’t gotten yet. When it connected my head where it was, I tried warning Stella too late. It jumped on her from a tree, knocking her to the ground.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Stella,” I yelled, pointing my gun and pulling the trigger.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was met with clicking.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“No, no, no,” I murmured.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I didn’t have time to think of a solution. From behind, there was a growl. I turned to see the empty sockets of the leader staring down at me. Despite its lack of eyes, there was still an intense festering malice within them. All other noises stopped except for us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I couldn’t even hear Stella struggling.  At that distance, there was no way I would be fast enough to escape. Its jaw unhinged and I thought it was over for me. Then the noise of multiple owls hooting echoed throughout the forest. It paused and I thought it looked confused, probably because it expected everything in the forest to be under its domain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The owls swooped down, clawing at its skull. They also attacked the one Stella was trying to fight off. She was able to push it back and take it out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What’s going on?” I asked as the owls were flying around us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I don't know, but I’ll take it. Come on.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We sprinted through the trees.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Wait, shouldn't we finish it off?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“Can’t, out of silver. The bastard was wearing out our ammo. We need more and then we can finish it off.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Another owl hooted above us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I think it's tracking us,” I said.

&#x200B;

“That’s just a coincidence.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The owl hooted again. To this day, I can’t explain what compelled me to follow it. Stella screamed my name when I broke away. The owl led me deeper into the forest.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Zane,” Stella called.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Her voice trailed off when she saw where the owl had taken me. There was the underside of a cliff with some moss-covered totem poles. An open silver box lay in the center. Next to it was a pick clean human-shaped skull.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m guessing this was probably the hunter,” I said.

&#x200B;

“Looks like it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Greedy people attract these things. However, this can also work in reverse. If someone is insatiable enough, a heart can act as a sort of mental magnet, even when it’s buried.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“But why did it take us here?” Stella continued.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The owl was perched on one of the totems. It tilted its head at us. We didn’t have long until it would be there so we needed a plan fast. Something glistened from a totem.  Stella plucked it out, revealing a silver dagger.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Can we kill it with this thing?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“No, not by itself. Damn it. We need more ammo. If we can make it back to the RV.”

&#x200B;

“Too late.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It emerged from the woods and seemingly had us cornered. I could see some blood and feathers stuck to its antlers. My heart sank. I glanced at Stella who had the knife raised. I got an idea and switched back to the regular magazine.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sure, I didn’t have any silver bullets left. It didn’t know that, though. Stella and I nodded to each other, then split. I fired my gun to act as a decoy. It worked and it came after me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I tried dodging only for it to catch me by my coat and fling me to the ground. As it was about to finish me off, Stella leaped onto its back and stabbed the blade in one of its sockets. It roared in agony and staggered back.  Stella hopped off it and helped me up. We booked it away from there.

Inside the store were all manners of hunting weapons. These included but not limited to handguns, rifles, and even hours. There were even some bait, lure, and decoy animals.

&#x200B;

More owls flew overhead.  Not only that, other animals seemed to be after our pursuer.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Why are they doing this?” I wondered aloud.

&#x200B;

“Question for later. Right now, we need to get the fuck out of here.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We got back to the RV. Stella cranked as it was coming out of the forest as well. She floored the gas and we drove away.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You’ve got to be kidding me. It’s still after us,” I said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was galloping now, keeping pace with us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Can’t this go any faster?”

&#x200B;

“I’m pushing eighty. I have an idea, but you’ll have to do it since I’m driving.”

&#x200B;

“What?”

&#x200B;

“You have to kill it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My throat dried. How the hell was I supposed to do that?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Check the floor compartment.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stella turned a corner, nearly making us tip over. The RV shook when its right side slammed back down on the road. I knew I didn’t have long. There were a multitude of guns in the compartment. I would only get one shot so I needed to make it count.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I grabbed the largest shotgun she had and filled it with silver pellets. Just as I got through, there was a thud on the roof.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Zane, you know what to do.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I got in position. I braced the butt of the gun against my chest, then aimed it upward and cocked it. The noise of shredding metal was ear-piercing. Its antlered head poked through and I saw they were even bloodier than before.  Everything slowed again and all noise dissipated.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It leaned down to grab me. I stuck the barrel against its chest and pulled the trigger. It’s strange describing what occurred next. The sound was deafening and the recoil knocked the wind out of me. While I registered that these things were happening, it was as if I were experiencing them out of body. The monster rolled off the roof and landed on its back.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Things returned to normal for me and Stella slammed on the brakes. We got out and cautiously approached it. Stella was holding the shotgun. It writhed in pain for a little while before also becoming dust and being blown away by a gust. We stood in silence and then Stella held up her hand.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We high-fived. The mission was complete. The adrenaline left my body and I wavered. Stella caught me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Let’s get you back inside. You need to rest up.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I groggily agreed with her. The next morning was spent letting Ira’s family know the danger was dealt with and patching up the roof with scrap metal. I got to pet Wishbone with Paulette again and we even got a large Tupperware of pumpkin cobbler from them. Now, we were to head back home.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We’re here,” Stella said after shaking me awake.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I stretched and yawned, then got ready. I stepped outside to see a house that wasn’t Dean’s.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Stella, where are we?”

&#x200B;

“Janet’s cousins live here. They’re hosting their Thanksgiving gathering here and I thought you’d like to drop by. You know, since we probably wouldn’t have made it back to your place before then.”

&#x200B;

“I mean, appreciate it, but is that okay with them?”

&#x200B;

“Of course, I’ve already told Janet about you before and I’m sure she’d love to meet you.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Inside was lively and the aroma of food made my stomach growl.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey, you made it after all.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I turned to see Dean.

&#x200B;

“What are you doing here?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“Stella’s family likes me. Speaking of, what have you got there?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He pointed to the container Stella held.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Pumpkin cobbler,” she told him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After what we went through only the previous day, this was well earned. I made sure to pile my plate high with the classics, turkey and mashed potatoes with gravy, cranberry sauce, and green bean casserole.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That pumpkin cobbler was incredible and we wished we’d gotten more of it, especially when we topped it with ice cream.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Zane.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was halfway through my plate. I looked to see Stella approaching me with another woman.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Janet, this is Zane.”

&#x200B;

“Hi, it’s nice to meet you,” I said with a wave.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Janet signed to me and Stella translated.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“She says it’s nice meeting you too and that you’ve been doing great work.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Janet signed again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“She says you have nice hair and pretty eyes.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That caught me off guard.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh, thanks,” I replied, rubbing the back of my head and blushing slightly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I wasn’t sure how to respond.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I think you’re pretty too.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We talked for a while. The next day I went home and this concludes that mission. This year, Brice and Sheila are hosting for their families and they invited me as well as Dean and Stella. I don’t want to go empty-handed, though and while I can follow box instructions, I am by no means a cook. I came across Paulette recently and we chatted a bit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I wonder if I could get her family’s pumpkin cobbler recipe. If not, Publix has a pretty good bakery. This is Zane, logging off and wishing [everyone,](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) a [Happy Thanksgiving.](https://www.threads.net/@rose_black2222)
