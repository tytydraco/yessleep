The town I grew up in no longer exists. The homes of my childhood friends lay dessicated and destroyed. Those houses which were not crushed outright linger, sagging miserably under a weight which lifted long ago. The land where farmers once grew their crops now lay as barren as the surface of the moon. Fields once full of tall, amber grasses which would dazzle and gleam in the afternoon sun now flat and ashen. 


The summer of '03 was much the same as any other. The animals were out in force, desperately pursuing a continuation for their species, attempting to raise young capable of survival before the chill of winter could demand it of them.  Though they thought themselves separate from it, the people of Harrisburg found themselves following this same cycle. Raising up their young before, seeking to prepare them for the "winters" which humanity faces. The existential threats that lurk behind the facade of our every day lives. War, economic depression, political violence. In the midst of it all, I just wanted to ride my bike. 


"Hey, Martin!" The brakes squealed as I brought my bicycle to a sudden stop. Looking back the way I'd come, I could see my friend Lawrence. He was always a funny kid, though often unintentionally. Watching his lab coat billow out behind him as his chubby legs raged against the pedals, face as red as a beet and hair that resembled a bright orange birds nest, I couldn't help but smile. Lawrence was goofy, and often the target of derision, but he was my friend. Probably the best friend I ever had, really. 


When we were in the 9th grade, Shelly had thrown a party in the old abandoned house at the corner of Winthrop and Maple. According to local legend, a man had lived there by the name of Robinson. Mr. Robinson had lived a quiet life of dignity and duty. Going to work, returning home, repeat ad nauseum. This didn't stop rumors from circulating about him. To hear any of the local kids tell it, Mr. Robinson had been a killer on par with Ted Bundy or John Wayne Gacy. They used to say that his ghost would appear and attempt to murder any child who set foot in his home. Some swore they could see dark shadows moving behind the ancient curtains. Truth of it be damned, the legends had left the house as something akin to a museum. A dead place where things are held in stasis, fit for observation and nothing more. For sixty years that house stood, decayed and rundown. Great place to smoke weed though. 


This story isn't about the legend of Mr. Robinson, as I still to this day have never made it inside his house. I slipped climbing through the window and ended up spraining my ankle. All of the other kids scattered immediately, fearing trouble, but not Lawrence. He helped me up, and limped his way back home with me using his shoulder for support. 


"Hi, Lawrence! What's up?" I greeted my friend amidst a flurry of disintegrated leaves carried on the wind. 

Harrisburg had been experiencing a terrible drought. We didn't see a single drop of rain from until well past August. Thank God for modern infrastructure, we were still able to get the water we needed to meet the town's agricultural needs, but the forests suffered tremendously. Under the unrelenting, arid, heat old oaks and ancient willows drooped heavily. I remember thinking that it looked like the trees were melting, and being slowly pulled apart by the weight of their own limbs. Brown, dead leaves flaking away as the wind rustled through them. 

"Dude... I think you're going to want to see this." Lawrence said, his voice frantic and desperate. 


As we rode towards his house, I asked Lawrence what he was trying to show me. He was being frustratingly cryptic, but eventually decided he could give me a hint. 


"Okay, so what has three heads, wings, and belongs in the deck of one Seto Kaiba?" He asked, and the air of smugness surrounding him confirmed my suspicion. 


"Holy shit, dude you got the blue eyes ultimate dragon?!" I was so jealous in that moment. 


We continued towards Lawrence's house with renewed vigor. As we rode, Lawrence and I were discussing girls. I had a huge crush on Regina. She was pretty, athletic, and popular. I was fat, awkward, and poorly dressed. Despite this, Lawrence always encouraged me to try my luck with her. We were on our seventh cycle of "nuh uhs" and "yuh huhs" when we saw something that brought us both to a complete stop. 


Far-off on the horizon, beyond the range of mountains which encircled Harrisburg, there was a cloud. It was, by any estimation, an entirely normal cloud. We wouldn't have thought about if for more than a second, if it hadn't been the first we'd seen that year. Abandoning our quest, we decided instead to chase the cloud. We reached the base of the mountains just as the cloud began to crest its peak. 


"Do you think it's a rain cloud?" Lawrence asked in the way that children ask questions they've heard their parents ask before. The drought weighed heavy on the adults, but it didn't really mean much of anything to us. As two young boys, rain only meant a boring day indoors, but we saw concern in the eyes of adults when the drought came up. I guess Lawrence figured he should be concerned too. 


"I sure hope so." I was doing the same thing as Lawrence. "I haven't seen a drop of rain since last December." The sentence was one I had heard from my own father, repeated verbatim in some vain attempt to appear more adult. 


Lawrence missed his cue to continue our charade. I turned to look at him, his face wild-eyed with mouth agape. I imagine I must have looked much the same when I followed his eye to the cloud. Once plump and bright, it now stretched downward, tapering to a single point where it entered the mountain near its peak. 


"Dude..." Lawrence barely managed to squeak out the word. 


We watched the rest of the cloud disappear into the mountain in a stunned silence. On the ride back, neither of us said anything. As we pedaled past a treeline full of verdant yellows and golden fields, I could see a look of confusion and worry on Lawrence's face. The tightness of my brow told me that I wore the same expression. My mind was racing, but it had nowhere to go. I could have thought about what I had seen for another thousand years and never gotten any closer to understanding it. It wasn't until Lawrence had his Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon card in his hand that either of us spoke. 


"Oh my God, bro. This is epic, you're going to knock Reggie into next week with this!" I was trying to play it cool, but the volume of my voice betrayed my frayed nerves. 


Reggie was Lawrence's rival in tabletop card games. They had started off with Pokémon, before moving to Yu-Gi-Oh as their new battleground. There was a small crowd which would gather to watch them duel. Lawrence had been undefeated in a Pokémon match, but things had been rough since the switch. After seventeen consecutive losses, I knew Lawrence would be excited to take back his crown. 


"Yeah..." he spoke absent-mindedly. I didn't have to wonder where his thoughts were. 


"Okay, so you're pretty freaked out too." I was relieved to stop pretending it wasn't bugging me. 


"What the heck was that, Martin?" Lawrence asked me and I could only respond with a shrug. "Maybe it's an undiscovered geological phenomenon!" He pointed his finger up in the air like a dork when he said this. 


"Well, it's definitely an undiscovered something. I've never heard of anything like that happening. I wonder if this is what's responsible for the drought." 


"Whoa! It totally could be! Martin, we have to get up there and investigate. We could be heroes!" It was a childish, foolhardy idea, and we were children. We threw together a laughable bag of supplies before saying our goodbyes. 


The next afternoon, Lawrence and I left school and headed straight to the mountain. It quickly became apparent that we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. The water bottles we had brought were rapidly depleted, and what meager snacks we had managed to collect went just as fast. It got dark before we had reached the halfway mark, and we were forced to retreat and try again another day. As we trekked in total darkness, having neglected to bring flashlights, I heard Lawrence give a startled cry and the sound of a body being dragged across the ground. 


The seconds of silence felt like hours as I called out to him. The relief I felt when I finally heard his response hit like a truck. 


"I'm fine! Ow, mostly. There's a big hole over here! Be careful!" I followed the sound of his voice, testing each step before I took it. Nobody knew we were out here. If we both fell in, our parents might never find us. 


It was impossible to see the bottom, not because of distance but the simple absence of light. The only way I could tell Lawrence was in there was by the sound of his voice. I grabbed a branch I thought might be long enough for him to grab onto and lowered it in. I was pleased to feel his weight pulling the branch downward as he climbed up. I remember feeling afraid for a moment that it might not be Lawrence at all who was climbing up toward me. I desperately fought the fear of some unknowable horror wearing my friend's face, willing myself to stay and to keep holding the branch. He neared the surface, and in the faint moonlight I could see his hair and his clothing being pushed around by a strange air current coming from the hole. Push-pull-push-pull. The rhythm of it reminded me of breathing. That idea made my skin crawl, and the nape of my neck prickled as Lawrence clambered back up to ground level. 


"Thanks for saving me." Lawrence said. 


"Of course, man. What kind of friend would I be if I left you to die in the woods? Besides, I owed you for helping me the night of Shelly's party. Now we're even!" Truthfully, it felt strange for Lawrence to thank me. In my mind, leaving without him was never an option. 


We waited for the weekend before making another attempt. It felt impossible not to tell anybody what we had seen. I did try to tell my dad at one point, but he brushed me off and mumbled something about "your pokemons." Our second journey proved much more smooth than the first. We left with plenty of daylight ahead of us, and plenty of supplies packed. Lawrence's mom had looked at us curiously as we stuffed 24 water bottles into a bag, but eventually shrugged and went back to drinking. 


The first half of the trek had been beautiful, despite the circumstances. The trees seemed to shimmer as they danced in the wind. Deer moved in small herds through the forest as we walked. Lawrence swore he saw a giant woodpecker, but I'm pretty sure he was lying. The upper half of the mountain was devoid of life by comparison. The soft grasses and gently swaying trees giving way to cold, gray rock. What scant few trees could survive there stood silent and empty.


"Wait, stop. Do you hear that?" Lawrence asked. 


I stopped and pricked up my ears. I could hear a sound coming from further up the peak. It was a faint whoosh, in and out. Like I had heard before. 


"What the heck is that?" I asked, knowing I'd get no answer standing there. 


We continued on our way, hesitant now. It was as if we had only suddenly remembered why we were there. As we got closer to the origin of the sound, we could feel subtle vibrations in the ground beneath our feet, growing stronger until we finally saw it. Or at least, part of it. 


Set in a basin on the northern edge of the mountaintop, there was an enormous gaping maw. A chasm of pulsating flesh bore into the mountain, continuing thirty feet or so. We stopped roughly fourteen feet away. Even from that far, the smell made my eyes water, and the heat of its breath made me want to cry. It didn't hurt or anything, the warmth of it just felt like confirmation that whatever this thing was, it was alive. That thought was way too much for me to handle in that moment. 


As many young boys do when faced with something they can't understand, I lashed out. I picked up a large rock and threw it into the beast's mouth. It took so long for the sound of an impact to emanate from the yawning maw. A half a second later, an appendage, dripping crimson  shot up from the throat and slapped wildly at the ground all around it. It snapped up rocks and small trees as it flailed. Lawrence and I were stunned, backing up slowly so as to not draw attention to ourselves. Our efforts were in vain, however as the tongue of the beast snapped towards us. 


It stopped, straining desperately against its own flesh, no more than 6 inches away from us. As we stood, in total shock, I found myself staring at the tip of the vicious, crimson tentacle of a tongue. Quickly, but almost imperceptibly, the flesh of the creature's appendage stretched further. It was as if the creature were willing itself to grow just to get to us. Realizing this broke me from my trance. I grabbed Lawrence and we ran like hell. 


Between the downhill run and the sheer panic, we made it back down the mountain in half the time it took to climb it. It may have been my imagination, but I swear I caught a glimpse of the creature's tongue peeking through the treeline at the base of the mountain. 


My mother was perplexed when Lawrence and I burst through the door, looking as if we were being chased by rabid dogs. Her confusion only deepened as I desperately tried to explain. It took a long time to convince her to call Sheriff Abernathy. He arrived half an hour later with his border collie, Sandy, in tow. He had this look on his face like he would rather have been anywhere else. As a kid, I thought maybe he already knew about the maw. Nowadays, I think he might have been just another miserable adult who hates their job. 


After what felt like hours of talking with the sheriff, and reciting our stories what must have been a hundred times, he relented and decided to go take a look. 


The look on his face, and the apparent lack of Sandy's presence, told me exactly how the sheriff's trip had gone. He was apoplectic. Truthfully, I'm not even sure if he meant to come back to our house or if he was just on autopilot. He pounded on our door, and yelled. 


"That god damn monster got Sandy. What the fuck is that?!" My mother desperately tried to help the sheriff regain his composure as he raged. She didn't want his meltdown to scare us, as if the emotions of a grown man were the scariest thing we had seen that day. She was kind of right. Thanks mom. 


It felt ridiculous to return to our normal lives after what we had seen, but that's exactly what we did. Of course we talked about it often, even tried convincing some of our friends that it exists. I could tell by the way they reacted that they didn't believe us. Sheriff Abernathy, for his part, had not returned to normality. He had taken up drinking as a way to numb the pain of Sandy's loss. 


I found him, one day, after school. He was drunk, and sitting on a curb outside. 


"Sheriff Abernathy" I said his name hesitantly, like he might lash out at me just for acknowledging him. 


"What the hell do you want, kid?" His eyes were bloodshot and his breath smelled like acetone. 


"Well, sir, uh I know that you're upset about Sandy. Don't you think you should do something about that whole situation? Maybe call the government?" I was trying to be gentle with him, so as to not make his situation worse. 


"Why? So I can have a bunch of FEMA cocksuckers stomping through our town telling me there ain't shit we can do?!" It was clear from how easily it emerged that his anger had been stewing. 


"Sir, there has to be something we can do." I pleaded. 


"There ain't a god damn thing anybody can do against something like that. You want my advice? Keep your head down and live your life. Stay away from the mountain." He picked himself up as he finished the sentence. The sheriff glared at me for a moment before he walked off. I didn't have to wonder why, I knew part of him blamed me and Lawrence for what happened to Sandy. I know that because part of me blames us for the deaths of Linda, Johnny, Tim, Erica, Barry, Greg, and Blair. 


Small towns love legends and rumors. We shouldn't have been surprised that word of our story had spread through the school. We were floored when we heard that a small group of seniors had decided to head to the mountain's peak. We begged them not to go up there. We told them our whole story, and how the creature had pursued us. 


"Wow, thank you." Barry said "Now we know exactly what to look out for when we find your little monster." 


They all laughed together as they walked out of the school courtyard, heading toward the mountain. They were all declared as missing persons the next day, but people had a pretty good idea where they had gone. Our story had spread through the whole town by that time, but nobody believed it before the group's disappearance. It was difficult to go about our lives as if nothing was wrong after that, but we found a way. 


Losing so many people, Harrisburg needed extra hands to work the fields. I found myself working near the base of the mountain when the posse returned. They looked utterly hopeless. Their faces spoke of an injustice standing as the world's crown jewel. An injustice which they were completely powerless to correct. All except one, Barry's father, Hank. 


"He's still in there, Greg, I heard him!" The outburst was clearly sudden, judging by how the rest of the group flinched at the words. "They're all still in there!" 


Greg spun and rushed Hank, grabbing him up by the scruff of his shirt and pressing the barrel of his revolver against Hank's jaw. 


"You didn't hear SHIT. You got that? You keep your mouth SHUT from here on out, you understand me?" Greg spoke in a barely contained rage. He dropped Hank, and they continued on their silent march. 


Later that day, as Lawrence and I rolled through waves of discarded leaves, I told him what I had heard. We stopped along a fencerow, ears of steadily drying corn dancing in the wind. A storm had been approaching, whipping up clouds of dust from the increasingly dry fields of Harrisburg. 


The town was filled with a mixture of excitement and apprehension. We were desperate for rain, and we knew that this storm would deliver, if it managed to slip past the creature in the mountain. 


The clouds hung, heavy and dense in the distance, as they smoothly sailed through the atmosphere. I sat in my bed, watching as lightning flashed and projected the shadow of the mountain out over Harrisburg. In the midst of the blinding lights and incredible sounds of the storm, I could see from my window how the clouds sank towards its peak, forming a tower of fog driven down deep into the earth. Not a single drop reached Harrisburg. 


At 12:32 AM, a groan was heard. Impossibly loud, deep, and pained.  


Then there came a sound which I, and many others, mistook at first for thunder. I could feel the vibrations of the deep rolling rumble rattling the floor beneath my feet. It became clear, when the sound persisted, that it was not thunder at all. Looking out the window revealed a catastrophic scene. The mountain had exploded outward from a section of its base. Large chunks of stone carved deep paths through the farmland, obliterating structures, crops and cattle. 


From the hole the explosion had made in the mountain, an impossibly gray mist was being blown, as if pressurized, from the opening. It spread itself over the town, and I watched houses and cars visibly begin to sag under the incredible weight of the fog. The lights had come on in the Lasseter house just moments before total structural collapse. By the dim glow of the streetlights I could see people trying to flee from their homes, but none of them were fast enough. En masse, mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters were subsumed.


My parents were in a panic, trying to get a bag together before the monstrously heavy cloud could reach us. For my part, I just sat at the window and watched. Lawrence's house had been on the side of town closer to the mountain. I watched as particles of stone slowly began to congregate on my window, knowing that my friend was dead. 


Our escape from Harrisburg is a blur for me. A blur with a high pitched ringing for a soundtrack. Dad told me later how the cloud chased after us, buffeting the car with tiny stones and constantly dumping grains of gray sand all around us. 


They never bothered to clean any of it up. We were just a small town in Bumfuck, Nowhere after all. I used to be very angry over that, but I've mostly put it behind me. Now, however, as I pick through the devastated town that I used to call home, I find resentment welling up inside me again. Thinking about the casual nature of what happened, and the complete lack of a response, left me so frustrated that I could have cried as I stepped into the ruins of Lawrence's home. 


I recently lost my job, and I was tearing my hair out trying to figure a way to cover my rent for the month. As I cross the living room, ash and dust taking flight from every surface I touch, I found myself thinking once again of how Lawrence had helped me on the night of Shelly's party. Rooting through his rotted dresser, I found it. Safely encased in plastic, preserved from the hell that destroyed my town and the decay which followed, was Lawrence's Blue Eyes. 


I drove away from Harrisburg, knowing the card would sell for more than enough to cover my rent. In my first moments of peace, without the fiscal sword of Damocles over my head, I think only of him. I think I cried more on that drive than I have in the rest of my life. Lawrence is, was, and always will be, my very best friend.
