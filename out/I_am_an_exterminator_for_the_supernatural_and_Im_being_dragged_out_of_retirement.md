You may remember me from [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vb2ol6/i_am_an_exterminator_for_supernatural_pests_heres/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) or [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vg5x73/i_am_an_exterminator_for_the_supernatural_and_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) of my last posts—and you may remember that I was slated to enjoy an early, but well earned vacation.

Well, I was, until recently. 

And then I received a pretty damn interesting message from a friend named u/lunanightphoenix. A message about a black skeleton and a mysterious white car. About an attack—pretty much in wide-eyed view of the public—on her own family.

Now, I was pretty well enjoying myself at my house—trying out new hobbies (woodworking is harder than it sounds), enjoying my days to myself, but the real reason I became an exterminator in the first place was to help people. Protect them from the supernatural—what they should never have to worry about in the first place, I guess. 

I made some calls. Got the usual equipment back—they were happy for the help, short handed as they are nowadays. Always kept my truck: she’s been well maintained even since I turned in the exterminator’s coat. I did try and call a few friends, see if they couldn’t take care of this as a favor for an old friend, but they all had their hands full. Something about an uptick in supernatural activity—but that’s not really here nor there.

I’m telling you this story because I’ve been thinking about the job as a whole recently—the secretive part of it. Why should we keep others in the dark about this? Do we have the right to dictate what ordinary citizens should or should not see?

And then I saw a charcoal-black skeleton wield a man’s spine as a damned whip.

That pretty well solidified it in my mind—hopefully it should in yours, too. People deserve to know about this. They deserve to know that there are things out there that can ruin or endanger their lives. That can hurt them and their loved ones.

And so I guess that was why I felt like I had to take this case on personally. Why I’m sitting here typing out this story, warning whomever might stumble upon it on this forum. I’m not the man who has the gall or the resources to take this story to a media outlet and get them to actually cover it—but I can do this much, at least. One last foray into the supernatural before I shut that chapter of my life for good.

And that’s how I found myself taking another damn road trip up from the middle of nowhere, Louisiana. At least it’d be a familiar climate—Florida ain’t that much different, after all. We just have more gators.

Now, that message I mentioned—Luna filled me in on the basics. Tall charred skeleton, attacked during the night, used a . . . damn grisly whip. The way it spoke on that tape—the security footage from that night, I mean—no doubt about it. Full-fucking Dullahan. I didn’t even know the things prowled in America. Clearly, they do, but, damn. Over a decade of this job and I’d never encountered one—or anything like it—before. 

There’s only one weakness of theirs that I know of that a rube like me could pull off, which is gold. Pure as you can manage without ruining your savings, I suppose. Now, normally there’s a generic tool that we exterminators can use to rout out a specific kind of monster, or something to help injure them enough to send them packing for a while for someone more violently inclined to take care of, but that wasn’t going to be good enough for this fucker. Already a man-killer, and it clearly relished in that fact. No, some piddly gold knife wasn’t going to cut it—I needed something heftier. Something capable of smashing through those blackened bones, of snuffing out those eyes.

On an unrelated note, did you know it’s legal for a man to walk into an antique store and simply buy a mace? No identification needed or anything. It’s genuine, too, not even a flimsy replica. No clue if it was ever used or not, but it’s not like it mattered at the time. 

After that, it was just a quick stop at a pawn shop for all the gold chains they had on hand. Mostly just 14k, but they did have a real nice, gaudy bracelet of 22 karat gold. I don’t know why someone would ever want to wear something which weighed nearly a pound like that, but it was big enough to go around the head of a mace—a hammer could make that form fitting real, real quick. Pretty sure I could do some good damage to a regular person with it just like that, but a Dullahan is a lot more than a regular person with a detached head. I bought the cheap shit as a back up—you’ll hear more about that in a bit, I reckon.

After that, there was just the drive over to the housing complex. Nice little place, too, if you could get over all the police tape. 

I’m retelling this pretty calmly, I reckon, and that’s because I already know it ends, but I was not nearly this relaxed when I got there. No, I was nearly as strung up as a fucking hog. I’d never let a client get hurt when I was working my jobs, not one, and part of me was just . . . well, pissed the hell off. It’s ridiculous to think that I could have stopped what happened in some sort of way—I didn’t even know about this subdivision before Luna contacted me—but that wasn’t what I was thinking about. I was thinking about the sheer gall of this monster. Attacking someone right outside of their house, dreamwhispering a sister out of her bed and nearly into its hands—taking out an innocent man because it fancied the shine of his spine, may he rest in peace.

So I’m afraid I may have been a bit curt with Luna and Dana. I apologize if either of you are reading this, if I hadn’t already done so in person.

It was Dana who met me as I was unloading everything out of the back of my truck. Her back had healed, but Luna was still having some issues with her throat. “Do you have a plan?” It was a cross between a nervous question and some sort of eagerness to get back at the Dullahan for what he’d done to them, I reckon.

“Yep,” I said.

“What is it?” I think I was just hearing the nervous, but I should have known better. Anyone would be angry after having that foul thing attack their sister—and certainly someone like Dana would.

“Well, chiefly to dash its skull between a rock and a lump of gold. We’ll see how that pans out.”

I think the message made it across, even through my gruffness, but I recognize now that we should have planned a bit more.

Even after lugging all of those gold chains that far, I didn’t think far enough ahead about what I was going to do with them. I got as far as unlinking all of them from themselves, tying the six or so of them into a long rope of gold before the sun started to get too low on the horizon. 

I wasn’t sure when the monster would return; it’d need time to lick its own wounds after the thrashing that hound gave it, but I had to be ready for anything. Especially mystery cars rolling through locked gates like they weren’t there in the first place.

I knew that we were in for a long night when the mist started to roll in. Magical or not, you could hardly see five feet in front of your own face, and the streetlights didn’t do anything except make it worse, a cone of solid white under all of them. It was quiet until about eleven that night, me and both of the sisters staking out the driveway. It was damn peaceful up until we heard the rumble of an engine rolling across the mist. Like a growl pitched even lower, coming from all around us. I was nearly sure we were being surrounded by something until the headlight shone straight towards us, piercing through the gloom straight into the living room.

It rolled up silently, aside from that bassy engine. Not even the gravel crunching.

And then it stepped out of the cab.

It was like a dark wave of fear just *boiled* off the thing. The mist rolled and drifted away from it, like the water rejected it as much as my mind did. It was suffocating, even from inside, but I didn’t let that stop me. I was already out the door, mace in hand, thumbing the grip. I wasn’t quite sure if 22k would be pure enough, but they didn’t have 24 in the shop. Make the most of what you have, I guess.

The Dullahan had clearly been busy. Its “whip” was in one hand, the skeletal hand gripping it shaking with something like rage. The other hand was . . . fresh. It was unlike the rest, not yet darkened with  age. Still white—and I know it was brand spanking new, because the motherfucker hadn’t washed all of the gristle off of it.

It held its head in that hand, a stray drop of blood falling onto the stones beneath as the Dullahan raised its eyes to be level with mine.

“Ah. An *exterminator*. I know your kind. I know how easily you die.”

Like boulders gnashing against each other, smothered in black smoke. Just the sound of its set my teeth on edge, felt like my skin was being pressed against ice.

“You undead bastard.” I was never good at shit talk, anyway.

“I believe the last said something to that same effect. And then I led him to his death—he even made quite a nice replacement for the limb that creature relieved me of.”

If he was trying to get a rise out of me, well, I’ll be the first to admit: it worked. I took just a couple steps towards the monster when it reared the whip back, sent it cracking towards my face. I barely dodged it, more stumbling back out of the way as it whiffed just a inch above my head. By the time I was steady on my feet again, it was already snapping back towards my hand—the one holding the mace. 

I was able to pull it away, just barely, taking a few more paces towards the skeleton. If I wanted to do anything to it, I was gonna have to get within striking range. Maybe an oversight on my part whenever it could lift a man off his feet with scarcely a thought, but it was too late to think about that.

“Passable,” it said, like this was some sort of fucking exam.

That was the first hit—the mace slammed against the forearm holding its grisly weapon. There was a crack of white light, the gold humming, almost singing as soon as it made contact with the charred skeleton. The Dullahan’s eyes flashed at that, a fracture appearing across one of the bones—the ulna.

“You aren’t quite as stupid as the last.”

I was still trying to size up the monster when it moved, dropping the whip as it lunged, just grabbing me by the throat as it brought that grinning skull up to my face. “Pitiful, still. An exterminator taking me on—all by himself? Foolish. It will be your end.”

I got a taste of that supernatural strength, my feet leaving the ground as the Dullahan lifted me up. I was nothing to it. I had no leverage to swing at it properly—even pressing the gold against its arm, it did little more than sizzle and smoke at the contact. I was already struggling for breath. I would break before it did.

That icy feeling was only growing worse. It was like a glacier had me pressed into its grasp, the sensation of oily, black water constricting around my neck, tighter, and tighter, and yet tighter. There wasn’t even the room to gasp or splutter, there was just staring into those eyes. Those damned eyes. Like embers of a fire that should have been snuffed out long, long ago, looking to take my life to stoke the flames.

I thought that was it.

Then there was the clink of metal links.

A sound like a screech, a loop of gold wrapping around the skeleton’s other hand, and the monster cursed as gold brushed against its cheek. It dropped me like a rock, and I was left panting for breath like a dog as its gaze switched over to the new attacker.

I have to say—Dana is surprisingly good with just a link of chain. But I think I’ll let the sisters tell the rest of this story. They deserve it, after saving my ass. You can probably guess how it goes, what, with me sitting here telling you about it, but trust me, it’s better from the source.
