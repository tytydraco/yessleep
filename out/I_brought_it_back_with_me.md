I woke up to sunlight streaming through the blinds, the rhythmic beep of the heart monitor back like nothing had happened. 



No dripping sounds. No wet footprints. 



Maybe I really had been hallucinating. 



Then Eilidh walked in, holding a Greggs bag and smiling wide. 



“A did bring a chippy fur ye last night but ye wur oot like a light! Didnae want tae interrupt yer sleep so a just left.” She said, opening the bag.

The smell hit me hard—it made me feel sick.



“Got ye a Steak Bake, yer fave.” 



My stomach turned.



I nodded, forcing a smile. “Cheers.”



I didn’t touch the food. 



We sat like that for a while—her chatting away, me nodding at the right moments. But I was barely listening. I kept looking at the window, waiting for the reflection to move on its own. 



It didn’t. 



But it didn’t match either.



There was something just slightly off—the tilt of her head, the blink that came half a second too late. Like a delay in a video call.



When I finally spoke, my voice barely came out. 



“Think a could go hame?”



She looked surprised, then smiled again. 



“Aye, pretty sure the doc was talkin aboot discharging ye the day if aw goes well.”



The problem with that was, I lived with my parents.



*Where the fuck would a even go?*



Everything was so surreal, I didn’t even care. I wanted out of this hospital.



I nodded. “Good.”



She kept talking—probably about the storm, or the food, or how lucky I was. I wasn’t listening. My eyes stayed fixed on the window. Hoping the real Eilidh might appear again, mouthing something—anything—to prove it hadn’t all been in my head. 



Or maybe to prove that it had.



A nurse came in with a too-wide grin and asked if I was ready to leave. My eyes snapped to her reflection—she almost laughed, like she knew whatever I was looking for wouldn’t be there. 



Her reflection looked normal, apart from a small delay. Just like Eilidh’s.



“Aye, get me the fuck oot ae here.” I tried to joke, but it came out dead serious.



“Just one last jag before ye go. It’s an antibiotic—the last of your course.” 



*Did ah get any other jags? Maybe ah’d been asleep.* 



I rationalised it and offered up my arm with the IV.



My arm burned as soon as the nurse touched me. I tried to yank my arm back, but her grip was like a vice—unyielding, inhuman.



I looked up. Looked over to Eilidh, pleading with my eyes.



Her face didn’t move—she just stepped back, her eyes black and face blank, unreadable.  



What stood over me wasn’t a nurse anymore—it was a rotting, human-like creature.



The thing from the reflection. Now standing right in front of me.



Its skin was wrong—peeling in places, fetid and stringy. The neck crooked and bent at unnatural angles, bone poking through torn flesh. Its smile split across its face like a snake unhinging its jaw, teeth long and needle-sharp. Its eyes—black pits, endless and hungry—bored into mine as it plunged the syringe in. 



The liquid scalded as it coursed through my veins.



I could feel it—feel it spreading, replacing everything that had once been mine, as I fell into a dreamless slumber.



I woke up screaming. Arms flailing, trying to throw myself out of the bed, to run—anywhere. 



Strong arms stopped me mid-panic, pulling me into a familiar, solid warmth.

“Hawl you!” my dad shouted, holding me tight. 



“Calm doon, everythin’s alright darlin’. Yer safe.”



I froze.



That voice. 



That warmth.



Then my mum was there too, her arms wrapping around both of us, her hand stroking my hair like she used to when I was wee. 



“It's okay, sweetheart. You’re alright noo. You’re safe. We’re here.”



Tears burst from me. I choked on a sob and clung to them both like I was drowning.



“I thought you were dead,” I croaked, “I thought—I saw—”



“We’ve been here the whole time,” Mum said softly. “Waitin’ on you.”



My heart wanted to believe them. My body sank into their embrace like it was home.



But my eyes flickered toward the reflection—



Mum and dad were there, holding me close. The room looked normal. 



Their reflections, too.

But mine… it stared back with dead, black eyes.



Smiling—like a hungry predator.
