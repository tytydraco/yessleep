The wind swept through my hair as I stood at the edge of the boat, my heart pounding with anticipation and trepidation. Below me, the dark waters of the Mediterranean Ocean beckoned, their depths concealing the secrets of the past. But I was undeterred, driven by a relentless curiosity to uncover the truth behind the old missing ship that had fascinated me for years. 

With a deep breath, I plunged into the embrace of the ocean, the cold seeping into my bones as I descended into the murky depths. The light faded, leaving me surrounded by darkness, my only guide the faint glow of my diving equipment.

The “Das kleine Kaninchen” a German cargo ship, had vanished without trace during World War 2. Some claimed it was lost at sea while others speculated it was sunk by Allied forces but since radio communications where silent no one quite knew what happened.

What everyone did know however was the large bounty the vessel had attempted to bring back. An German expedition in Egypt had uncovered many precious treasures and some also claimed the ship itself had over 3 tons of gold and we had found it.

As I swam deeper, the wreckage of Das kleine Kaninchen loomed before me, its twisted hull casting eerie shadows in the gloom. My heart raced as I explored the rusty remains, my mind racing with questions and excitement.

As I delved deeper into the ruins of the ship, I uncovered clues and artifacts that painted a chilling picture of Das kleine Kaninchen final days. Each discovery sent shivers down my spine, but what was odd, there was no signs of anyone ever being on this ship. No bones, no clothing, nothing, it was like the crew members had just vanished.

As I ventured forth into the darkness of the captain's quarters, the flashlight flickering against the oppressive gloom, my eyes fell upon a peculiar sight—an ancient statue seated on the desk, its form eerily reminiscent of Osiris, the Egyptian god of the afterlife.

The statue sat there, its stone features frozen in a haunting expression of regal serenity. Hieroglyphs adorned its base, their meaning lost to the passage of time. My heart quickened as I approached, an uneasy feeling settling in the pit of my stomach.

With trembling hands, I reached out to touch the statue but as my fingers brushed against its weathered surface, I felt a sudden decrease in the waters temperature.

In the dim light, I could have sworn he saw the statue's eyes flicker, a faint glow emanating from within their depths. A sense of unease crept over me as I floated there, my mind reeling with disbelief.

As the flashlight beam swept across the captain's quarters, illuminating the eerie statue of Osiris, my gaze fell upon a metal lockbox nestled in the shadows. With cautious steps, I approached the box, my heart pounding with anticipation.

With trembling hands, I pried open the lock, revealing a weathered leather-bound book—the captain's log of the Das kleine Kaninchen. The pages were yellowed with age, but remarkably well-preserved, each entry a window into the ship's final days.

With a sense of urgency gnawing at me, I carefully placed the ancient statue of Osiris and the captain's log into a burlap bag, securing them tightly before making my ascent back to the surface. The weight of the artifacts pressed against me as I kicked through the water, the darkness of the ocean depths receding with each stroke.

But as I neared the surface, the whispers of the ocean seemed to grow louder, their voices mingling with the pounding of his my heartbeat.

At last, I broke through the surface, gasping for breath as I clung to the edge of my own vessel. With trembling hands, we hoisted the burlap bag onto the deck, the weight of its contents a stark reminder of the eeriness I had encountered below.

As I collapsed on the deck, my body heaving with exhaustion, a profound stillness settled over the ocean. The wind, which had been blowing mercilessly moments before, now lay silent, as if holding its breath in anticipation.

In the eerie calm, the haunting aura of the statue of Osiris became more pronounced, its ancient presence casting a palpable sense of unease over the deck. Even in the dim light, I could see the faint glow emanating from the stone figure, its eyes seemingly fixed upon me with a gaze that pierced through my very soul.

As the burlap bag was opened and the captain's log revealed, a hushed tension settled over the deck. The unsettling aura surrounding the statue of Osiris seemed to intensify, casting an unease over the gathered crew members.

With a sense of trepidation, one of the crew members stepped forward, taking the log in hand and carefully flipping through its weathered pages. The German text, faded with age, seemed to pulse with a strange energy as he began to translate its contents aloud.
