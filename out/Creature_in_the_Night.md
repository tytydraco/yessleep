Have you ever had one of those moments where you say, or think something and then immediately wish you could take it back? Like telling your coworkers at your sucky retail job that it’s so slow and then bam it’s busy? Yeah well, I had one of those moments. Unfortunately, it’s a little more serious than saying ‘Wow, it’s slow today’. I’m still trying to wrap my head around it and not have a panic attack.

&#x200B;

First, let me give you some history before I explain what happened. I’m not sure if it’ll help but I feel like it could and I want to try and give as much information as possible because I’m completely lost on what to do. Maybe it will be clearer in the morning...Ever since I was little, my family has dealt with… hauntings. My mom’s side more than anyone. Many of her siblings have seen or heard ghosts that haunted their parents’ house. When my mom’s siblings left home and got houses of their own their hauntings continued. It also continued when my parents bought their first house. None of the cats would step foot in one of the rooms; in fact, they would hiss and growl and take off. It was the first time my mom ever got help and did a cleansing of a house. Afterward, no problem. Although the cats would still stop and stare at random spots in the house and later on my sibling (who took that room) would have their own sightings of ghosts.

&#x200B;

For the most part, I would just.. feel things. Like when you feel someone staring intensely at you or that instinct that tells you that you aren’t safe. I never actually visually saw anything. My most intense experience was when I was older and watching my younger sibling; I was about 12. We had been playing when we heard this otherworldly growl come from the closed closet, and yes, this is the same room my mom had to cleanse. Of course, we freaked out and ran out of the room. When we braved the room later, all we found was a big hole (the size of a fist) in the closet door. Honestly, we expected to get in trouble for breaking the door even though we didn’t do it. When we told our mom she seemed worried but not surprised; maybe that was the reason we left that house soon after.

&#x200B;

I continued life without really experiencing anything paranormal after high school. I had a few friends who had their own stories of ghosts and one more experience where we heard a ghost knock but that was it. I also stayed firmly away from Ouija boards. I did not want to dabble with that without knowing what I was doing and honestly, even if I did know how to use one safely I wouldn’t. I refused to touch or look at them. I had heard stories of people’s experiences and my mom had a terrible experience with one with her friends. My instincts also told me it was not a good idea. It feels important to mention this because what I saw was not a result of my messing with the powers of an Ouija board.

&#x200B;

Due to a lot of factors, I stayed at home during college and got to experience helping my family move into a new house. It was honestly the most normal of all our houses. It took a year or two before I noticed anything odd. The cats had started staring again and this time it wasn’t random, it was in one area for long amounts of time. We had an extra room and so we had friends or family who would live with us for certain amounts of time and even their cats did it too. The feeling of uneasiness and wrongness kept growing until I couldn’t stand it. Fed up and unnerved, I ended up researching and buying things to do my own cleansing. I followed the instructions and things went back to normal.

&#x200B;

Eventually, I moved into my own place and that’s where I’m at currently. I’m actually renting a condo that is in a neighborhood my aunt used to live in before she passed away. So, I share two walls with two separate neighbors (think a square split into four more squares if that makes sense). Thankfully my neighbors have been decent about noise too. Nothing strange has happened in the past four years… Okay, that’s a lie… but nothing major has happened beyond what my family has accepted as ‘normal’. That being: animals acting weird around certain areas or times of the day, seeing things out of the corner of our eyes, or hearing odd noises (but could possibly just be regular house noises or, in my case, my wall neighbors).

&#x200B;

This is when things take a turn. I recently went through a stage of craving the paranormal again. As in reading scary stories on Reddit, listening to scary stories on YouTube, following TikTok stories, watching scary movies, etc. My whole family loves the paranormal and scary crap for as much as the paranormal may or may not love us. And that’s when I had my ‘thought’. It wasn’t even a solid thought where I would normally feel like, ‘Oh crap, I jinxed myself’. Like when I tell myself ‘Whew, no cops even though I’m speeding’ and then a cop appears. I swear, fate loves to mess with me. Whenever I think something like that, it always happens. I think, ‘Man it’s slow’ and it picks up; or ‘Good thing I have no plans’ and either someone needs me or I forgot plans I had. Hopefully, you get the idea.

&#x200B;

I’m almost afraid to visualize or think of this thought again but… well basically I thought about how weird it is that with all the paranormal crap my family has dealt with that, I haven’t really ‘experienced’ it; and by that, I mean actually seeing something. A few days passed and then last night happened. It wasn’t scary but it was weird. I was in bed and reading before I went to bed. The only light on was my reading light and I had my central AC keeping me at a cozy 65 degrees F. Then I heard something. It was hard to place but it almost sounded like banging or even something thumping. Thinking back on it, it’s hard for me to think of exactly what it sounded like. I ignored it because sometimes others in the neighborhood were annoying like that at 10 pm. But it kept happening and even my two cats were starting to notice and perk up, looking for the noise. Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore and I got up and went to the window to see if I could see anything. There was nothing… and the noise stopped. I stayed by the window for another minute and looked around. No one was out though, it was silent. I went back into my bed and got comfy and then it happened AGAIN. I shot out of bed and ran to the window before I realized it wasn’t by my window. It was by the wall by my bed; this was not a wall connected to another neighbor.

&#x200B;

At this point, even my cats realized where the sound was coming from. It was hard to tell if the noise was upstairs or downstairs. So, feeding into the stereotypical stupid person who runs to the scary noise, I ran downstairs to see if I could see or hear anything. Nothing. The noise stopped. However, I had a strange, dreadful feeling about the window by my kitchen. I checked my locks again and closed the curtains a little tighter, refusing to look outside, before going upstairs to bed.

&#x200B;

Now, here we are tonight. I’m sitting and writing this from the comfort of my bed. Determined not to leave the room until daytime. Honestly, I’m just determined not to think about what happened at all but writing has always been therapeutic for me and I need answers. Both of my cats are with me which is strange because the bigger one likes to stay downstairs for a while longer. However, maybe it’s not strange after what I saw. Even though neither of them are freaking out, I think the fact that they are both on the bed with me and not fighting over what they deem ‘the spot’ speaks for itself.

&#x200B;

How to describe what I just witnessed… Well, my kitchen window had the curtains opened. I usually leave it open during the day for my plants and cats and close the curtains when it gets dark. I don’t always remember to close it before the day ends. Today was one of those days. I was relaxing after work and before I knew it, it was dark. I got up to get a drink of water from the kitchen and happened to glance over at the window and noticed the curtains. Just as I was thinking of closing it… I saw it…I had left my porch light on which shines over by my window. The area outside my condo door is not fenced in. I have a small flower garden under my kitchen window and then it turns into grass and keeps going into a public area that rests between my condo and another. The parking for our condos is off to the right of the window. 

&#x200B;

And I’m sorry, I know I keep skirting around what I saw but shit, I’m almost in tears. I already tried calling my mom but she must be asleep. She takes meds to help her sleep so she’ll be dead to everything until tomorrow morning. My dad never really believed in the paranormal and never really saw anything so I don’t think he would take me seriously. I honestly don’t have many friends and the ones I do know have families and I’m not trying to call them this late over this. Nothing has happened since the sighting. No banging or anything and plus I have two wall neighbors that would hear if anything happened to me.. I hope. But also, what if I just imagined it? I really don’t think I did.

&#x200B;

Okay, so I got my glass of water and noticed the curtains open. Just as I looked out the window and was about to walk over to close the curtains, I saw this creature… It hovered over my small flower garden I have right in front of the window. It was crouched down and it was unnaturally thin like it had been starved. It’s arms and legs were as long as it’s torso and if it stood up I know it would be taller than me. I’m 5 feet and 4 inches and that thing had to be almost 6 feet. It was a brownish/tan color, almost copper. I honestly… I can’t tell you about it’s eyes. I don’t remember anything. I know they weren’t small but that’s it. It’s ears were pointed too. I know it sounds crazy and that’s not even the weirdest part.

&#x200B;

I feel like I’ve seen this thing before. Not in the waking world but in my dreams. I don’t really have bad dreams usually. I’ve had dreams of aliens taking over and other action dreams but nothing in those dreams looked like that thing. Even when I dream of the paranormal it’s more standard ghosts or possessions than anything like this. But I KNOW I’ve seen it before. For as much as it terrified me, it was familiar.

&#x200B;

Honestly, the moment I saw it my first action was to drop to the floor and freeze. I’m very much a freeze or flee type of person when it comes to danger (as much as I wish I was a fight person). I’m talking about the flight or fight response but there is another response and that is freezing. Anyway, I stayed on the floor for a moment and when I finally got the courage to peek, it was gone.

&#x200B;

Needless to say, I ran to close the curtains and double/triple-checked the locks, and ran upstairs. Thankfully, I keep my laptop in the office room I have because otherwise my option would be writing this on my phone or waiting until tomorrow. I’m so wound up that I’m not sure I’ll be sleeping any time soon so I’m glad I don’t have to work tomorrow.

&#x200B;

But I’m at a loss. I don’t know what the hell that thing was. I don’t think I imagined it. I know it wasn’t a person or an animal. I swear I stared at that thing (as it stared back) for a good 30 seconds or more before my body kicked in and ducked. I am pissed I didn’t take a picture but shit.I feel like it makes so much sense though. The last few days leading up to this I was starting to feel uneasy about that window and the outside. Like this dread or danger. The feeling of being stared at. If I got home late and it was dark I didn’t waste time getting in. It felt unnerving to linger outside longer than absolutely necessary. 

&#x200B;

Now I’ve seen this thing and I don’t know what to do. Is it going to stay? Why haven’t I seen it before? Where did it come from? Did it follow a new neighbor here? If so, why did it come to me? Is this a one-time thing and it was just curious? If it didn’t mean any harm then I feel like I wouldn’t be feeling unnerved like I’m in danger. Even though there is one creature that forces you to feel that way so you’ll stay away from it. This thing definitely didn’t seem to care that I saw it though.

&#x200B;

More than anything, I just want to know what I saw. I’d like to say I have more knowledge than most people on creatures and the /supernatural/paranormal but this one is stumping me. I’ve followed myths and legends like Skinwalkers and chupacabras ( I used to know more obscure ones too but it’s been a second since I’ve read up on them). It definitely wasn’t anything I’ve read or heard of before. I KNOW I didn’t imagine this. I’m not crazy.

&#x200B;

If you have any guesses please let me know. I’m going to do some research and hopefully get some sleep. Maybe I’ll have more answers tomorrow.
