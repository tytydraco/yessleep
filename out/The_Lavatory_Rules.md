The day was supposed to be the same as any other. Even the air was the same. I was sitting in the last stall of the third-floor men's room, hiding from a world of spreadsheets and deadlines, procrastinating. The low, monotonous hum of the ventilation system filled the air, a futile attempt to overpower the faint but persistent smell of cheap disinfectant and something vaguely organic beneath it, a scent that always lingered in these corporate sanctuaries. From the next stall, I could hear the muffled tapping of a phone keyboard, a rhythmic sound that was the universal language of paid idleness. You know the feeling. The tranquility of a corporate afternoon, disturbed only by the echo of a dripping faucet in the otherwise silent room, lined with sterile white tiles. My mind was empty, filled with nothing but dull boredom and thoughts of the approaching weekend.

Then it happened. Distant, muffled sounds—first a single, sharp scream, quickly cut off as if muffled by a hand. Then a bang, hollow and heavy, like a filing cabinet falling over. And then, without any transition, the piercing, shrieking wail of the fire alarm. My first reaction wasn't fear, but irritation. Another drill. We'd be standing outside in the rain again, waiting to be let back to our spreadsheets. The sounds were filtered through layers of concrete and steel, distorted and confusing, as if coming from a great distance, or from a strange dream.   

And then, as suddenly as they had begun, they stopped. The alarm died mid-cycle, leaving a phantom ringing in my ears. The screaming had been silenced. A deep, unnatural quiet fell. It wasn't a peaceful silence; it was heavy and oppressive, amplified by the dead acoustics of the tiled room. This sudden shift from noise to silence is a classic horror technique for building suspense. In that silence, for the first time, I felt a chill that had nothing to do with the air conditioning.   

And then came the first heavy, wet THUD. Not a knock. There was no living force behind it. It was the sound of dead weight slumping against the main restroom door. My body reacted before my brain could process the situation. I tasted the metallic, electric tang of pure adrenaline in my mouth; my heart began to pound against my ribs so hard it physically hurt. A cold sweat, smelling sharper and more acidic than usual—the scent of fear itself, full of stress hormones—ran down my back. My vision narrowed into a tight tunnel, my brain instinctively focusing all attention on the door, ignoring everything else. I was trapped. The principle of inevitability revealed itself in all its horror; there was no escape from this room.   

The environment itself had become my adversary. Every sound, every echo, was amplified and distorted by the hard, non-porous surfaces. The restroom wasn't just a place where I was stuck; it had become an active participant in my terror, a psychological weapon that intensified every wave of horror.

In a fit of panic, as my thoughts raced wildly, a memory flashed through my mind. Carl, the guy from the night security team, had forgotten his walkie-talkie here an hour ago. He'd left it in the stall next to mine when he went to wash his hands. It was a spark of hope, a tangible goal that pulled me out of my paralyzing fear. Having a goal, no matter how small, was better than drowning in helplessness.   

The journey to it was the longest of my life. I had to crawl on the filthy, sticky floor under the partition. Every sound—the scuff of a shoe, the rustle of my pants—echoed like a gunshot in the silence. I felt vulnerable, humiliated, like an animal cornered. The floor was cold and damp; I could feel every pebble and dried stain.

Finally, I clutched it in my hand. Cold, heavy plastic. I turned it on. Instead of a clear voice, there was only the loud hiss of static, a sound that underscored my isolation rather than alleviating it. I pressed the button, my fingers trembling. "Hello? Is anyone there? This is Mark from accounting... over."   

Silence. Just the crackle, like dying stars. And then, finally, a response. Carl's. But it wasn't his usual calm baritone. It was a distorted rasp, soaked in pain and panic, filtered through cheap electronics and the hell that had broken loose on his end. "Mark? Where... where the hell are you? Get out of there! Now!"   

"I can't, Carl! There's something at the door! What's happening?"

His reply came in fragments, interrupted by static and his own ragged breathing. Every word was torn from his lungs with immense effort. "They're not people, Mark... they're not people... they're tearing flesh... God, they..." His voice broke in a fit of coughing, wet and ragged. "I got a scratch... just a scratch, it's nothing... but... it burns... it burns like hell..."   

In that moment, I understood. The walkie-talkie wasn't a tool of rescue. It was a direct line into the heart of the apocalypse. Instead of connecting me to the outside world, it trapped me in an intimate auditory relationship with a man who was dying and turning into a monster. Every crackle, every distortion of his voice, pulled me deeper into despair. I wasn't just a listener; I was a witness.   

Trapped with Carl's dying voice in the receiver, my senses overloaded. I started to notice smells that weren't there before—the coppery tang of my own fear-sweat and a faint, sweetish smell of rot that seemed to rise from the drains. Every detail in the room seemed menacing and hostile. The chrome soap dispenser cast distorted reflections. The grout between the tiles looked like dark scars.   

In a desperate, irrational attempt to do something, anything, to keep from thinking about the sounds outside, I looked into the toilet bowl. And there, deep in the drain, wedged in the bend of the S-trap, I saw something that didn't belong. A piece of plastic wrap. With a revulsion that mixed with desperate curiosity, I reached in and pulled out a small, slimy, plastic-wrapped piece of paper. It was covered in shaky, desperate handwriting.

It was a list. A list of rules. Rules that made no rational sense. It was a mixture of the mundane and the inexplicable, a hallmark of the internet creepypastas I sometimes read for amusement. But this wasn't amusing. This was a new, terrifying layer of reality being forced upon me.

Rules	
1. Do not flush between three and four o'clock. It can hear.
2. When the lights flicker three times, close your eyes. Do not open them until you hear the singing.
3. The voice on the radio is not your friend. But it's all you have.
4. Do not trust the mirrors. They lie about who is behind you.
5. If the stall door moves on its own, offer it a name. Not your own.

These rules were not a guide for surviving zombies. They were a form of psychological warfare. They forced me to choose between rational action and ritualistic obedience. Rule 3 immediately sowed paranoia towards Carl, my only connection to the world. Rule 4 attacked my sensory perception, my ability to trust my own eyes. Rule 2 demanded a passive, faith-based act—closing my eyes in the face of a threat, which contradicted every survival instinct. I knew that under extreme stress, the brain's ability to think rationally is impaired. These rules exploited that. They pushed me from logic toward paranoid, magical thinking. The real horror now lay not just in the monsters outside the door, but in the question: Were these rules just the ravings of a madman, or the actual physics of this new, terrifying reality?   

I tested the rules immediately. "Carl?" I whispered into the radio, my voice trembling, "I found a piece of paper here... with rules on it. Do you know anything about it?"

Carl's response was exactly what Rule 3 had predicted. A confused, irritated growl, punctuated by wheezing. "What... what rules? Mark, snap out of it! Focus! You have to... you have to find..." His voice was lost in a coughing fit that sounded like his lungs were tearing apart. Was he lying? Or did he genuinely not know about them, which would make them even more sinister? My isolation deepened. I was alone, with a dying man and a mad list.   

And then his decomposition began. I was his sole witness, a helpless listener as his mind and body collapsed in real time. His transformation occurred in stages, which I followed through the distorted speaker of the walkie-talkie, and it was terrifyingly similar to clinical descriptions of delirium and psychotic states.

Phase 1: Coherent Pain. His speech was strained but still logical. He described what he saw on the security monitors, trying to advise me. "There are too many of them... at the reception desk... they don't move fast, but... they're strong. Mark, I saw them bend the steel server room door with their bare hands. They just... just pushed."

Phase 2: Feverish Confusion. His voice grew hoarse, his breathing shallow and labored. He began to show signs of feverish delirium. He repeated himself, lost his train of thought, his sentences falling apart. "The doors... you have to lock the doors... did you lock them? Mark? Did you lock... that scratch... it burns... why does it burn so much?" His thinking became disjointed, disorganized.

Phase 3: Paranoid Delirium. The infection attacked his mind. He described hallucinations—shadows moving on the monitors, whispers in the static. His paranoia, a key symptom of psychosis, turned against me. "Why are you in that bathroom for so long? Are you waiting for them? Are you with them? I can hear you whispering to them! I know you're with them!" His speech was now a mixture of lucid warnings and psychotic delusion, making him a completely unreliable narrator of the outside world.   

Phase 4: Animalistic Agony. The human part of Carl was fading. His words devolved into gasps, pained whimpers, and finally, the guttural, wet gurgle of the infected. The last thing I heard wasn't words, but the sound of his humanity being violently extinguished. The sound of tearing flesh and cracking bone, transmitted with terrifying fidelity.   

Being limited to only sound, I was forced to experience his transformation much more intimately. The voice is the carrier of personality, and I was listening as one personality was erased, step by step, and replaced by something monstrous. This wasn't just a story about a monster; it was a tragedy about the destruction of a soul, broadcast live.

The pace quickened. The fluorescent light above my stall began to die. It flickered once, twice. The high, irritating buzz of a dying ballast cut into my ears, like an insect burrowing into my brain. Rule 2 throbbed in my head: "When the lights flicker three times, close your eyes." I faced an impossible choice: trust the insane rule or maintain awareness of my surroundings. Rationality versus magic. Survival versus faith.   

The third flicker. Absolute, tangible darkness. In a spasm of pure terror, I obeyed. I squeezed my eyes shut. It was an act of surrender, a relinquishment of my rational mind to the cryptic authority of that piece of paper.

And then the horror for my ears began. Sight was gone; sound was everything. First, just as the rule had predicted, I heard a faint, ethereal singing. It seemed to emanate from the walls themselves, from the pipes. It was beautiful and, in its incongruity, utterly terrifying. It sounded like a choir, but without words, just a pure, mournful melody.

Then the sound at the door changed. The mindless thudding stopped. It was replaced by a slow, intelligent, metallic scraping. Something was deliberately trying to get in, not with brute force, but with cunning. The shift from raw power to guile made the threat feel more personal and sinister.   

And finally, Carl's last transmission. It was no longer his voice. From the radio came a piercing scream of pure agony, a hideous wet gurgle, and a final, deafening click as the walkie-talkie went silent forever.

The main lights buzzed back on, blindingly bright. The scraping and the singing were gone. The return to "normal" was more jarring than the darkness. The threat had demonstrated its ability to manipulate the environment, confirming that the rules were terrifyingly accurate. My rational understanding of the world had collapsed. When a person's model of reality shatters under extreme stress, they become susceptible to adopting alternative belief systems. And I had just found mine.   

I was left in a deafening silence. I stared at my reflection in the small piece of polished metal on the toilet paper dispenser. I remembered Rule 4: "Do not trust the mirrors. They lie about who is behind you." For a split second, in my mind, ravaged by stress and suggestion, I saw a figure in the reflection behind me. A tall, dark silhouette. I spun around—nothing. Just white tiles. The ambiguity of whether it was a real supernatural event or a stress-induced hallucination was the core of my new madness. My perception was forever broken. I could no longer trust my own eyes.

The scratching on my stall door began again. But it was different. Softer. A single, deliberate *tap... tap... tap...* 

The handle moved slightly on its own, slowly, as if someone were gently testing it. I remembered the last rule: "If the stall door moves on its own, offer it a name. Not your own."

It was the final, quiet, terrifying moment. I had no fight left in me. I had accepted the new reality. I looked at the dead walkie-talkie, the last relic of my connection to the rational world and to the man who embodied its horrific end.

In a quiet, trembling whisper, barely audible even in the tomb-like silence, I offered the only name I had left. The name that belonged to the voice that had guided me through death.

"Carl..."

The handle stopped moving.

And then, there was only silence.

But i knew, deep in my mind, this wasnt the end...
