“Give me the knife, Orianne”, I demand.

“Emily”, Orianne looks down at me, “you can’t beat them. They’ll come for you, they won’t stop until- ”

“Give me the knife.”

Orianne sighs and hands me the small blade. Natasha stands beside her, eyes locked onto me. She is scared, I can see that. But the emotion she shows, the fear, is it real? Or is it all an act? Is she just an act?

I grab hold of Natasha’s hand and we walk over the grass as it sways, approaching the house we had only just escaped. As we near it, a silhouette, that of my uncle, fills the open door. He stands there, patiently waiting for us to reach the house. As we do, he steps aside, ushering us in. I enter the dimly lit house, holding the blade toward him as he backs away. He stares at me, a slight smile plastered across his face, nodding his head as I carefully pass him. 

Behind him stands Orianne’s Carp, and with her, Natasha. 

“I want to test something”, my Uncle mutters as he closes the back door, “I want to see just how far we’ve come.” He walks toward Natasha and grabs her. I flinch as he does so, but to my surprise he pushes her toward me. As she stumbles into me, I’m greeted with a tight hug. However, now is not the time for this. I need to figure out which of these two is my real sister.

As I hug Natasha, I quickly flick the knife across her back. She squirms and moves away from me, staring at me in shock. I turn my attention to the other girl that I believe may be my sister, who stares at me with the same expression, and with a fast lunge, I slice a small cut onto the side of her forearm. From her forearm, I see it immediately. 

Red blood, not black. This one is my real sister. The one I saved *is* my sister. Orianne was wrong.

The other Natasha, Natasha’s Carp, steps toward me, one hand still rubbing her back. She’s going to attack me. She knows I’ve figured it out.

I thrust the knife into her chest as she steps in to hug me once more. Hug me? Wh – why is the Carp hugging me? I push her back and look down to see a pool of dark red blood pooling by her feet.

*What…*

Blood. They’re – they’re both bleeding. But… how?

“The Carps have come a long way, Emily”, my Uncle mutters, “a long way indeed. I have managed to create them so perfectly, that they can almost *instantly* be integrated into society. Flawlessly too. They bleed, they cry, they survive. I’ve mastered it; something your pathetic Uncle could never have done. They are now *exactly* the same.”

My shaking hand still grips the blade that protrudes from Natasha’s chest. She stares at me, tears filling her eyes. She opens her mouth to speak, before dropping to the floor in a slump. The knife stays in my hands, cutting her further as she falls. I’ve killed her.

“Did you make the right choice?” my Uncle smiles. 

Orianne steps toward Natasha’s body and kneels beside it. Natasha eyes still stare at me, she's quiet even in death. Orianne gently pushes her eyes shut. I turn to Natasha, to the one I haven't stabbed, who’s shaking beside me in fear.

“Are.. are you her? Or are you her copy?” I ask, my voice trembling more with every word.

She blinks once. Twice. Never speaking. Her arms outreach, and she gives me a hug. The same hug I had just received from the girl I'd just stabbed.

“I’ll protect you”, I whisper in her ear.

I quickly turn and slash the knife toward Orianne, who remains kneeling. She screams as I hear flesh tear, although I’m not sure what I hit. 

I grab Emily and run toward the front door. My uncle quickly follows, his voice bellows around the house which shakes with every step he takes, “STOP!”

We run to the trees. I hope we’ll lose him in the night. Darting between them, changing directions quickly, yet my uncle continues to follow. I glance back  and see him running, gaining on us. His eyes are filled with ferocity; with hatred. He yells at us as he runs, although I am not sure what he says, nor do I care. I only care about saving Natasha.

As we reach the lake, we both leap into it, swimming for our lives.

\-

Dreams haunt me since that night. I have dreams that my Uncle caught me – that Natasha got away and I was dragged back into the hatch. But the dreams, the nightmares, they end. And when I wake, I am me. I am safe. 

It’s been three years since me and Natasha escaped our Uncle. I’ve not wanted to write about it again, not until now. But now, I do. Because now, I’ve found something. 

Natasha and I stand over a hatch. It’s the exact same type of hatch from my Uncle’s lake house. The one that housed all the hosts of the Carps. The one marked *‘28’.* We’ve been looking for another hatch since we escaped. We want to put an end to all the Carps. We know there are more out there. 

We never did see our Uncle again, although Natasha swears she’s spotted him before, usually when we’re in big crowds, watching us, *studying us*, from a distance. Neither of us have ever seen Orianne again.

We open the hatch and traverse down. As I watch my hands grasp the ladder, I see the tips of my fingers where my fingernails had once been. They never did grow back.

*THUD.*

Natasha reaches the bottom, I soon follow. We flick on our flashlights, searching for a light switch which I soon locate and pull, illuminating the room with a dull orange glow. As my eyes traverse the room, I smile. Natasha and I have found what we were looking for. Painted on the wall in large green numbers – *22.* We have found another bunker.

The room is large, massive. Grey walls stretch as far as the open sea, never-ending. Alongside the wall, a bed every few metres with a large tank beside each. In each bed, a person; needles protrude from their eyes, skin, mouth. The room is so silent that I can hear the heartbeat, almost synchronised, joint in unison, a rhythm, of the people as they suffer in silence.

“Natasha”, I say, “it’s time to get to work”.

We split up as, one by one, we thrust our blades into the necks of each person. Their violent convulsions are a blessing to them, as it is the beginning of the end to their suffering. Most of these people, I don’t recognise, however, there are some I do. I recognise one as my PE teacher. Another, as the postman.

But there is one I recognise very well. As I see her, I should be shocked, I should be afraid. But I am not. 

I smile.

I look down girl with the needles in her eyes, who stiffens in fear as she sees me. Tears seep out from behind the needles, over the crusty edges of her eyes and down her cheek. I stroke her hair as I stare down her body. She wears the clothes I had on that night at my Uncle’s house. The tubes that come from her are deep, integrated into her body. Skin has grown around the edges of some of the tubes, clinging onto them; they are a part of her. I turn my attention back to her eyes, which continue to stare at me in shock.

“I’m stopping the carps, I’m stopping them all,” I whisper to her.

The girl stifles back a scream and I shush her.

“I can’t free you”, I smile, “I’m sorry. I need you”.

A stream of tears now fall down her face. She desperately shakes, the bed rattling as she does so.

“If I kill the host," I say, "I kill the Carp. You know this".

I lean down and give her a kiss on the forehead. 

“Goodbye, Emily”, I say as I look at my host for the final time.

I walk away from the bed as she screams, gurgling from behind her tube. Blood and puss sputter from her lips as she continues to desperately shake.

I continue my work and thrust my knife into the person’s throat in the [bed beside her.](https://www.reddit.com/r/squishycabbage/)
