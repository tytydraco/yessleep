My great aunt fought with dementia for years before she finally succumbed at the age of 86. It has been a devastating and painful experience to watch a person you love and look up to slowly lose control of themselves and their memories. I cried for days after she had passed. My great aunt had been a big part of my life growing up. 

Since I was a little kid, she owned a small farm in East Tennessee. Some of my best memories as a kid was helping her pick green beans and planting tomatoes in her fields. I always snacked on a few beans while picking and she would pretend not to notice. She would say we were twin souls because we were so alike. Even born on the same day, July 13th. She had also been the first one to start using my correct pronouns (she/her) and chosen name — let’s say April. 

I won’t go into too much detail on where her farm is located, but a quick google search of any small towns in Appalachia should give you all the details you need. I do want to have some semblance of privacy while I post on the internet (where everything lasts forever). 

To be honest, my great aunt dying was just the cherry on top of my already shitty luck this year. I had just caught my girlfriend of 5 years cheating on me. It had been a shocking, brutal reality to come to terms with. In the span of a few short weeks, I had lost the two most important people in my life. I couldn’t stay stuck in that apartment with my ex, so I paid to break the lease.

I learned soon after her death that my great aunt had left her small farm to me. I’d been both relieved and shocked when I got the news. My living situation had now become one less issue I had to deal with at the moment. I moved into her old farmhouse before the ink had dried on all the paperwork. 

This place needed a lot of work. Even before the disease had taken its course, my great aunt had been a hoarder. It started out small. Tables, countertops, and every other available space were filled with mail and various toys or books she would buy from the dollar tree. Then it started to spill into other rooms. Her kitchen was the worst part of the house because she refused to throw away any food. She kept everything past its date -- even kept rotten food. That sweet, musky scent of mold and decay became a permanent fixture in the farmhouse as I visited over the years. Still this place means so much to me. It’s where I would hide away summer after summer from my parents' rocky marriage and eventual divorce. No matter how littered and dirty the farmhouse got on the inside, the property was surrounded by beautiful deciduous trees that turned brilliant shades of orange, yellow, and red in the fall, and the smoky mountains. We would sit outside for hours sipping tea while my great aunt came up with stories to tell me. It meant a lot to me to be able to fix the place up and call it my own. I felt closer to my great aunt here. Some of the aching emptiness her death brought cleared away when I sat on the now rotting porch. 

It’s going to take a lot of paperwork and working with city officials to get this place back up to code. My mother originally planned to stay here and help me as well, but she took a nasty fall and ended up breaking her ankle. So it’s just me up here. I’m busy either cleaning, running errands, or talking on the phone with local farmers to buy up some of the older equipment still left on the property. Despite the ache in my bones from constantly being on the run, I really welcomed the distraction from other parts of my life I didn’t want to address. Sometimes, I caught myself pretending to be cleaning up the farmhouse for my great aunt to move back in. I don’t know. Grief has a weird way of manifesting. 

I think trying to avoid my failed relationship and great aunt's death is causing the nightmares. I’ve been focusing on the most important parts of the house to get back in working order. The kitchen, bathrooms, and the guest room I’m staying in. I’ve cleaned a path allowing me to maneuver to and inside those certain spaces. In my dreams, I am always sleeping in my great aunt’s room. Her room is clear of everything except the wire frame bed I’m sleeping in. This is how I recognize that I’m asleep because I haven't begun to touch it. Her room has a window to the left side of the bed with a giant tree outside. It used to have a rope swing before the whole thing had begun to rot. I’ll jump awake to the sound of scraping on the glass window pane. The mattress is bare and itches my skin. 

The bare branches of the tree brush up against the window. This and the howling of the wind are all I can hear. Then, a small creak catches my attention in the corner of the room. My body is heavy as if weighed down with sand bags; I can never move. My eyes dart around in response to find the source of the noise. It is impossibly dark in that corner. I start to think my eyes are playing tricks on me as a body slowly comes into focus. Long, tattered grey hair tangles against rotting skin. The woman was naked. Her body was bloated and oozing liquids I can’t identify but can definitely smell. It causes my eyes to water as the somewhat familiar scent of sweet rot and damp earth assaults my senses. The woman takes a step forwards causing her sagging breast and lumpy body to shudder and contort as if not completely under her full control. 

This woman was my great aunt. Naked and decaying before my very eyes. Her eyes were large and had a milky, cataract look to them. They were dark and sunken into her skull. Gone was the woman who brought light and happiness into my world. There was nothing here now but a terrible fear and a darkness that seemed to sink into my very soul. I could do nothing but watch her draw closer and closer to my frozen form. As she stepped into the silver moonlight, a long, black shadow crept behind her. It stretched across the ceiling and swayed to and fro without any correlation to my great aunt’s movements. My eyes followed the shadow back to the window with the tree outside. A young woman hung from a noose on the branch outside the window. I didn’t recognize this woman. She was dressed in an old, 1600s style dress with an apron. Her bonnet was missing as her dark hair obscured her face from my view. Despite the rasping breath and creaking floorboards of my dead great aunt growing closer, I was locked into the swinging young woman. I felt that if I looked away from her, I would be swallowed by her shadow whole. 

Cold, rubbery fingers glided across my arms. The bed dipped and I felt something dripping onto me. My great aunt was in bed with me now, and still I could not look away from the young woman. Her head was moving. I thought at first it had been the wind causing it, but her head was moving the wrong way for that. The dead woman hanging on the trees was lifting her head to look at me. I screwed my eyes shut and desperately tried to will myself awake. My great aunt grabbed hold of my chin and forced my head towards the window. I felt her reaching towards my face and she began to try to force my eyes open to look at the woman hanging in the tree. I screamed and managed to pull myself out before I had to look into her eyes. 

I’m screaming myself hoarse just to try to wake myself from the nightmares. It’s been three days straight of those dreams, and I don’t think I have a voice anymore because of it. I’m so tired all the time. I think it’s starting to impact how I perceive reality. Yesterday, I went to the grocery store. This morning I awoke to everything rotting, even things I just put into the refrigerator. I had to throw everything out -- hundreds of dollars worth of groceries. 

Was it just yesterday that I went to the store? Did I forget? I thought it was yesterday, but how did all my food rot in such a short amount of time? My days are blurring and I’m unsure. After throwing everything out, I went out to the store. I needed to clear my head. While I was out, I got a frantic call from my mother. She had been contacted by the police after they discovered my great aunt’s grave had been vandalized. Her body was missing and they had no leads on who was responsible. My mom wanted to come up, but I told her it was alright. I spent the whole afternoon at the police station trying to figure out what steps to take next.

I’m afraid to sleep. I’ve been drinking coffee and other energy drinks to stay up. It’s thundering outside which does help some. The sudden crash of thunder keeps me from dozing off. Then the lights start to flicker and fizzle out. I groaned and rolled over, shuffling around for a flashlight. The light was weak but worked for what I needed it for. I set out for the fuse box in the kitchen. Hopefully, I can get the lights back on. 

Flashes of lightning, cast long odd shadows on the piles of trash and clutter in the house. I found myself glancing over my shoulder and jumping at empty corners, afraid I would see my great aunt or the young woman standing there. The fuse box was a bust. I flipped all the switches for nothing to happen. Fuck, it’s probably the storm. The infrastructure was a lot different in a rural town than what I was used to. I sighed and started to shuffle back up the stairs. 

A creak in the floorboards caught my attention. 

I whipped around, the flashlight bobbing in between piles of papers, boxes, and junk in the living room. Then the tapping started. Slowly at first, building and intensifying into full on bangs. 

*THUD. THUD. THUD.* 

It was almost louder than the thunder. The flashlight dropped from my hands and I tumbled to the ground after it. The thuds were coming from all around. I couldn’t pinpoint an exact room. I stumbled up the stairs towards my phone, abandoning the flashlight. I was done with this place for now. I was going to call my mom and get out of here for a few days. After coming out of the guestroom, I made an unsettling discovery. 

My great aunt’s bedroom door was wide open. I stared horrified into the darkness of that room. It was not empty, like in my dreams, but as cluttered and messy as the rest of the house. I could see a peak of movement as the tree outside blew around in the storm, but the view of the room was mainly blocked by trash. I felt the heavy weight of eyes on me, and so I pressed my back into the wall and tried to inch past the room down the stairs.

 It was quiet now. The bangs have stopped. Another flash of lighting. The room lit up and I saw a yellow, gnarled hand disappear behind a pile of boxes. My breath caught in my throat as I slid to the floor and tried to stay as still as possible. I fumbled with my phone for a moment before putting on the flashlight. 

Milky, blue eyes flashed behind a pile of papers before ducking down. 

I let out a strangled noise and started to crawl down the stairs. A sudden crash of boxes and junk, shook the house like the storm outside. I screamed as I heard thudding footsteps behind me. I stumbled forward into a run as I sprinted through the house. 

Sprinting in a hoarder's house is almost impossible. I stumbled into piles after piles causing more things to crash to the floor. I didn’t look back but could hear somebody crawling over the trash after me. A sob burst through my chest and sounded into a short scream when I suddenly felt fingers bite into my ankle. I fell and started squirming around as the house started to close around me, trash and all. The hands tried to pull me further into the darkness, but I finally got my senses about me and kicked out. 

There’s a sickening, crunching sound and black liquid spills out from my great aunt’s mouth and nose. I felt multiple nails pop off as I yanked myself free.

The door is so close. I push myself forward to reach the brass door handle. There is a thunderous crash and bolt of lightning. In a frightening *whoosh*, the large tree outside my great aunt’s house catches fire. A scream, old and inhuman fills the house.

I clutch my ears and curl up in pain. I must have passed out because I came with a firefighter leaning over me, still huddled on the floor.

“Ma’am? Ma’am, are you able to walk?”

The tree burned bright despite the rain. It had caught the attention of some neighbors and they called the fire department. They couldn’t put out the fire, but kept the area clear in case it began to spread. It had been a miracle that a fire that big hadn’t caught the farmhouse on fire. The tree burned and burned until nothing but a gaping hole was left behind.

Underneath charred roots, they found not one but two bodies buried. One had been the missing body of my great aunt, naked and missing some fingernails. The other body was a skeleton of a young woman in tattered remains and a broken neck.

Upon closer inspection, I saw there had been strange symbols etched into the roots. Some were burned away but others were found deeper down. The more I stared at the bodies underneath the roots, the more I began to think it resembled a cage.

A now broken cage where something evil might just crawl right out.
