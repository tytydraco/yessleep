**November 3rd- 8:00am**

I am still here.

The thing, Daniel, went away last night. I hadn't seen it since it was midnight; since it spoke. I do not know what to make of it, but I am glad it is no longer looking over my shoulder. Takes some weight and worry away.

I am still figuring out what I should do. If I stay where I am, someone could find me. But since the outside didn't look like the original exterior of the school, I highly doubt anyone will. 

I could start wandering the halls more. It isn't the worst idea, and since nothing can technically be endless, I shouldn't be walking for much longer. I have travelled close to fifty kilometres already. I do not know the world record for the most enormous building, but if I were to guess, I am probably in it.

Speaking of significant buildings, I still need to understand where I am. I have deduced that I am somewhere separate from the main campus. Since I got here in less than a moment, I assumed I hadn't gone too far, but when I looked outside, it did not look like the exact location I was on campus. Since the outside seemed so dark, I would have to assume I was underground, in a hollow area. But this is just an assumption. I am going to continue walking. I will update once I find something note-worthy.

**November 3rd-9:15am**

I found something worth noting: a staircase. It looks like a regular stairwell. The interesting thing is that it only goes up; I am on the bottom floor. No stairs are going down, so I will explore and move upwards.

Another thing to note is that Daniel is back. He seems to be stalking me again from a distance (Of course he is.) Wherever he appears, the lights above him tend to diminish and go out, hiding him from sight. I honestly hate it. Whenever I see him, I feel a shiver go up my spine. It feels tricky to breathe, and it makes my heart drop. As much as I am trying to ignore it, the words he said last night are sticking with me. 

If I seem stoic and emotionless about this entire ordeal, it is because if I start panicking, I will have no hope of finding out where I am. I cannot afford to shut down due to fear, especially now. I want to go home. I will go home. I am going up the stairs and will report back once I can do so.

**November 3rd-10:00am**

I can't go back downstairs, and the lights are dim. It is hard to see. The staircase disappeared behind me. There are similar hallways from where I am now to where I was. 

I am writing this in an attempt to ignore the sound that I keep hearing. It sounds like someone clicking their tongue. I initially asked if anyone was there, but I knew there would be no answer. In fact, the tongue clicking stopped entirely, leaving me in a silent hush. Now I just hear breathing. Very shallow and laboured breathing.

I do not know what to do. 

**November 3rd- 3pm**

After writing the previous update, the breathing stopped, and the lights turned off. There was still enough light to see three feet ahead of me, so I wasn't completely blind. But god, I really wish I could unsee what I saw. I hate this with every fibre of my body. 

Something crawled slowly in my direction. Bones cracking and very soft groaning, like it was choking. It sounded maybe ten feet away at first, but then it slowly advanced upon me. I couldn't move. I was paralyzed by dread. When it approached, greasy hair covered its face. It was frail and very skinny in appearance, female, maybe. I got no facial features from it, but it stopped and stayed on its stomach, softly heaving and choking on air. 

Suddenly, without warning, its eyes snapped up at my face. They were grey and bloodshot, filled with despair and anger. The only words I could make out from its inaudible entanglement of words were a phrase. 

"There is no God."

It reached out and stabbed its hand into my leg, going about an inch into my calve. It was enough pain to snap me out of my fear-induced trance. I dived upwards and limped away, attempting to run. I could just hear its groans of discomfort as I got farther and farther away, slowly diminishing in the sound of my footsteps.

The lights came back on after a few hours of running. That leads to where I am now. I sat down on the wall and am now holding my leg. It hurts so badly; I have lost a lot of blood. I removed my sweater and tied it around my thigh to slow the bleeding. I feel very light-headed, and it is hard to keep my writing in focus.

Daniel isn't up here, or at least not at the moment. I hear distant moans and groans; I think the crawling lady is following me. She still has a way to go, and I can't move, so I can only wait.

If I am being honest, I think I'm fucked; I will probably die here. I do not know how to get out of here. I don't think there is a feasible way to escape what's coming, and even if I could keep moving, I think she'd keep following me. 

**November 3rd-6:00pm**

The crawling lady is around the bend. If I were to guess, she is less than a hundred meters from me. I can't move; it hurts too much. So I am stuck here, trying to shimmy away from the moaning, using the wall and the ground to drag myself.

This will be my last entry. My name is Derik Klein; my parents live in New York, Avery Klein and Donna Klein. Mom, Dad, I am sorry. Do not try and find me. I tried, and this will pass. I love you. I am sorry.
