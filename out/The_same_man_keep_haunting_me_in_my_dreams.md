 It started about two weeks ago. I remember my dream so vividly. In the dream, i walked around some weird house, before noticing a shadow. The shadow kept following me trough out the entire dream. The shadow looked like it belonged to a tall and scrawny man. At the end of the dream, i managed to catch a glimpse of the mans feet. He was wearing black boots. Since that day i keep dreaming about this man. Everyday i manage to make out more and more about him. I was scared. Scared of what would happen when i finally see his face. I didn’t know what the man wanted. I didn’t know if it was good or bad. Or maybe a sign. 

 I searched for answers on the internet, but there was absolutely nothing. I wasn’t going to give up. Everyday i searched more and more. Until yesterday. Yesterday was the day. I knew it was. The night prior, i saw the mans neck. ‘That only meant that i would see his head tonight’ i thought. I sat down besides my desk, and turned on my computer. It wouldn’t long until i would see him again. My computer took longer than usual to turn on. I think i waited about ten minutes before a blue screen lit up my face. Soon, disappointment filled my face, as the bottom of the screen showed that theres no internet. That was strange. My phone was perfectly fine. I went into settings to try to turn it on, but the screen went completely white and froze. What the fuck? I decided to turn my computer off, as i wasn’t going to get an answer to my dream anyway. I called my sister, just to tell her that i loved her. She was confused. “Laura, what are you talking about?” Ashley asked. I sighed and told her that it’s nothing.

 I layed down in my bed, waiting. After a while , i finally managed to fall asleep. It didn’t take long before i was dreaming. Dreaming of being in the same house, i was in every dream. I walked around the house, soon noticing the shadow of the man following me. I slowly turned around and looked at the man. It was impossible to make out his features, because of the lighting. The man stopped. We looked at each other before i could see him grinning widely, almost in-human. I froze at the sight, almost in a hypnosis. It soon dawned upon me, that the mans face was now inches away from mine. His eyes were white, blood flowing out of them. He had a huge grin on his face. He didn’t have a nose. I felt nauseous. This felt wrong. I jolted awake and looked away in relief, as this was finally over.

 I wish i hadn’t said that, because it was not. It wasn’t over. After i woke up everything seemed alright. It was only 4am, but that dream had completely woken me up. I went downstairs, into my kitchen to make myself some breakfast. I opened my fridge, but was greeted by blood splattered all across the inside of the fridge. There was a completely dry note in the fridge. I picked it up and read it. “Ashley.” That was all that was written on the note. The note was in my handwriting, but i don’t remember writing it. Next to the note was a bloody piece of meat. I picked it up, but soon realised what it was. It was Ashleys finger. The same ring that she showed me and our mom, after her boyfriend proposed. I dropped the finger and backed away. My hand was shaking, as i picked up my phone and dialled 9-1-1. “911, what’s your emergency?” The operator asked. I took a deep breath before replying, “I found my sisters finger in my fridge.” The operator sighed. “There was also a note that i hadn’t written next to the finger.” “Ma’am, do you happen to dream about the same man every night?” The operator asked, in a exhausted tone. “How..how did you know?” “We’ve received five of these type of calls in the past  two days. We’ll send out someone to pick you up. In the meantime, don’t leave the house. You are currently responsible of murder.” I hung up and let out a sob. I didn’t kill anyone, let alone my sister.

 I acted on instinct, and ran upstairs and hid in a closet. They aren’t going to take me. It wasn’t me. It was the man.
