Hey there everyone, the name's Johnathan, or John for short. I'm not much too special, I browse around the internet from time to time to look at stuff, including here. I guess I kinda come from a different plane of existence of earth since I've done research of where I am out of curiosity with no luck. Obviously a joke on that though, I'm not an alien, though it kinda feels like my knowledge of what I live is different from the internet that I explore, but that's not really the discussion of what I am typing here for. Instead, I'm gonna stick true to the question as the title on the off chance that I am right somehow.

To share the important context, I work for a company that sells stuff. Not allowed to say the name for privacy reasons, but it's basically what I like to call a "supply business". It's exactly what it is: a company that sells and trades things to make the world better or whatever to different towns. For example, there is a town not too far from the office building called "Sonar Town". The whole concept is that they use solar energy as their main sort of electricity and whatever else, solar panels covering every single roof. Don't ask me why it's not called "Solar Town", I feel like it was named that to sound cool but who knows. Our gimmick there is to sell and trade energy saving things and so on with eco-friendly products.

The building itself is located in Castle City, and it's where I live actually. I believe the history is that it used to be, well, a castle, being built into a large city decades later, keeping a lot of its old value, which I would assume is something unheard of, and I wouldn't blame you. Kind of a rich place to be, sure, but it's all leveled out in classes like everybody else on the planet knows. Low class, middle class, and high class, the works. Low class are farmers and people just trying to get by, Middle class is normies like me, and high class, well, they get to have a party in an old castle wreck or even live in one if they so want to. I know, it sounds a little weird to me too, but it is what it is I guess.

Now that the explanation is out of the way, I can get on with the whole point of this post.

One day this week, I was walking down the hall, doing my job, until I turned a corner and saw the manager talking to a worker in an angry tone, so I stopped and hid behind the wall to see what was going on. This is basically how it went:

Manager: What were you thinking!? Going around and mentioning that so casually? That's unacceptable!

Worker: What are you talking about? It's nothing really that bad.

Manager: Uh, yes it is. You're goddamn lucky that nobody was around when you brought it up to me!

Worker: So? What's the harm in bringing up Polar Town?

Manager: What do you mean "what's the harm in bringing up Polar Town"!? You should know at this point that it's a controversial town, and nobody else should know what it is!

Worker: Well, it's best if people know about it at least.

Manger: You're being stupid. No soul on the entire planet needs to know about it, and should NEVER know about it. What could anybody possibly use the information of the place for?

Worker: I mean, we can put it in history books because it's cool.

Manager: In what Devil's mighty Underworld could that disgusting abomination possibly be "cool"!? It should be forgotten and STAY forgotten. If you ever bring it up again to either me or the people around you, you are immediately fired.

Worker: But-

Manager: NO BUTS, DON'T SAY THAT TOWN'S NAME OR YOU'RE TERMINATED!

Worker: \*big sigh\*  
Fine, whatever.  
\*walks away, manager also walking off with angry mumbles\*

Jesus Christ that was an intense argument. Never in my life would I have ever seen an explosive scolding in my place of work before, cause it's usually pretty chill. After they went off I decided to continue my day, and planned to ask the manager myself about it to get some answers the next day at lunch. I don't know why this thought process appeared, but I guess I was curious enough to want to try something dumb just to know what it is.

Fast forward to said day, and on lunch, the manager is standing up to make sure that nothing bad goes on, he's like that. Then comes me walking up to him, tapping onto his shoulder, and having him turn to me to have the whole thing play out like this:

Manager: What can I help you with?

Me: Well...  
\*whispers close\*  
What do you know about Polar Town?

Manager: \*a look of pure annoyance before whispering back\*  
Why in the world do you ask that question?

Me: I overheard the convo and I'm curious about it. Is it really that bad?

Manager: Oh for the love of-  
It is, and it should be keep a secret.

Me: Well, how do you and the worker know about it?

Manager: I don't know how the worker knows, and me knowing it is none of your business.

Me: But I WANT to know. Why is it forbidden to bring it up? Does the boss know about it?

Manager: ...No, he doesn't, and it's forbidden because it's a heavy topic. Now let's not discuss of this any further and eat your lunch already.

One look at his serious face and I just shut my mouth. The entire time we kept our voice low so that nobody else could hear us talking, and I just sat down at a table and ate my lunch. You think I'd just give up right there and then but, nope, I kept asking for even a quick description here and there, all in the course of I think three days before I finally got my answer...somewhat.

The third day of me annoying the heck out of him for the final time was when everybody left when lunch was up and I stayed behind with the guy, asking him the same question. I was expecting him to give me the same response in order for me to give up, but instead, this is what happened:

Manager: John, I-  
...Fine, if you wanna know so badly, then I'll give you a quick description.  
It's a controversial known for making war things. That is all that I will tell you.  
If you wish to know more, go to the terminal and type in "Polar Town". You'll get a deeper explanation of it.

As he walks off, I was surprised and a little confused. The terminal? Why would it be in the terminal? And to explain what I am even talking about, it's simply an old computer machine thing that's dotted on a wall or two that we would type into to learn more about a certain place or find out quotas and whatnot. Odd and old tech, I agree with you, but I guess the company was established long before I was even born, simply never bothering to update to a more practical way of doing such tasks, even though we do have our own computers that we can bring with us to work to do, well, work, and "me time" stuff on breaks and maybe even on overtime if that is ever needed for one reason or another. Also, no, the old tech doesn't have it's own desktop thingy, just a full green tinted screen command prompt.

Obviously the course of action to look at the terminal is to claim overtime and dart to the first one I see, turning it on and entering what I was told to the "What are you looking for?" prompt. What I saw was spot on and more, a whole lot different than what I had initially thought. I had to painfully type it out my computer after reading the whole thing to copy paste it here, but here is the info of it all, word for word:

**Target name: Polar Town**

**Type: Suburban area**

**Current activity: Unknown**

**Target description:**

**Polar Town is a mysterious town. Also known as “Fake Military Town”, it is well known for weapons of war being processed there, including guns, bombs, battle vehicles such as tanks, and even large robots. Nothing made in the medieval era exists, only artificial military creations.**

**It was first thought to be a town made for soldiers to live in, but strangely, there is no proof of it being the case. Instead, normal civilians reside there, hence the nickname. It is also unknown on why the town is named "Polar Town" in the first place. No form of any police force is present, not even a hint of a controlling government, so the citizens there would often use the town like a testing ground for their technology.**

**Even though there is no court of justice, not a single person with ill intent is present. More often than not, casualties come from an accident when using one or more forms of what they all make. Reports are unclear of what the people do with the deceased.**

**Map history with the town is also strange. On paper maps, the location of Polar Town is marked, despite the town itself being in the middle of nowhere. Obviously with newer maps such as GPS trackers, it was removed completely, with no trace of it to be seen. No one knows why it existed on those maps of old though. A theory suggests that it was included so that more people can live in the town to increase weaponry production, though this has never been confirmed nor denied.**

**Despite its lonely status, there have been a few adventurers coming forward with their stories, mentioning that there are watch towers to have the residents kill anyone on sight, suggesting that there are many other curious daredevils that had their lives cut short there, as some are still missing to this day. Nobody has tried to visit the town ever since from the introduction of modern maps, so it is unknown if these stories state a more older time in the town's life that indicate recruitment attempts to its population.**

**Stranger still, despite the possibility of it being built for a certain war to partake in, no record of the town is seen in any documents on past battles, not even in top secret files. This means that either it was so secret that there should be no mention of it, or that it simply did not play a role in any part of what war could've happened, whether it was near or far away from the ravaging suburban residence.**

**Even though the history of Polar Town is shrouded in mystery, there is a popular explanation as to why it could’ve come into existence.**

**According to what the people that came up with or heard of it have said, the town was built by a large group of people that had to run from their original homes being destroyed in a crossfire, either by a nuke or a military force. A strong winter was present at the time, so the group made a new town as best as they could to keep themselves from completely perishing in the cold. Once the town was finished, it was given its name for being made in the polar temperatures as a way to honor their achievement.**

**Over time though, they began to collect materials to turn into artillery to protect the town from suffering the same fate as their previous homes, but with being in an unknown rural area away from other civilizations, it was highly unlikely that anyone would target them. This superstition grew to having constant testing run out of control, eventually stopping after decades of its life had sizzled out, and either all of the resided had perished, or a few had decided to move to a different place in fear of more fatalities.**

**Since the recent years, it is undetermined if anyone still lives there, but even if that fact isn’t true, this town should be avoided at all costs. It's heavily discouraged to even try to seek refuge in the residence, for one may lose their life there. If it is indeed empty though, a recommended action is to immediately call the authorities to tear down the abandoned homes of the neighborhood, and leave as soon as possible so as to not get hurt during and after the deconstruction**.

...

Wow.

That is...a lot to take in isn't it?

I just stared at the screen, completely lost and shocked. Now I understand why the mention of that place is as bad as mentioning Satan in a church.

Just.

Yikes.

And after typing all of that down, I shut off the thing and went back home. Probably a little corny, but I could barely get enough sleep. The thought of what the town would look like and what was even going on there with all of what the whole thing mentioned. How the decades part could possibly make sense is beyond me, I couldn't make up a story like that even if I tried.

I'm sure a few of you are gonna think that I'm suddenly being hunted by some ghost or something just by reading that, or I got weeded out somehow. Well, no, I don't think I'm ever gonna be haunted by an angry spirit acting like I just discovered their personal life or somebody watching my back at all times...yet. Yet on the second one at least.

Recently though, I've kinda gotten over it, though it still pops up here and there from time to time to but me for a couple of minutes, but other than that, having really done much. Don't really need a therapist of my own, I think I'm good without that for now. I suppose I could say sorry for having all of this be a bit boring, cause there's no traveling to some other alien dimension or whatever afterwards, though I at least hope that you found this at least a little interesting. And I highly doubt that it ever exists in any search result ever, but I guess even then, the three places that I had mentioned would be pretty much the same. Even if maybe one of them DOES exist, it's probably not gonna be the same, but you're free to do whatever, not like I'm gonna come to your house and stop you like a Snowstorm Angel or something.

Anyways though, break's up, so perhaps or perhaps not I'll mention more wacky what-the-heckles in the future. Right now though, this is John, signing off back into my alternate universe. Hope you all do well friends.
