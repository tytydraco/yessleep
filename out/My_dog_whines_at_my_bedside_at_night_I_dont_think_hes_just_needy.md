I didn’t expect the dog to be so needy when we got him. He’s a big burly rambunctious type, so I figured at worst he’d probably be bugging us to go outside and play with him when we had other stuff to do. Standard big dog stuff, basically.

Turns out we adopted the world’s biggest lap dog. He decided that his time in the pound was the last he ever wanted to spend apart from a person, and glued himself to my wife’s hip as soon as we brought him home. If she’s making food, he’s at her feet. If she’s reading a book, he’s sprawled across the rest of the couch. He’s like a sixty pound shadow.

And if he’s not getting attention, he whines. He never barks or growls. He just stares and lets out sad little self-pitying whimpers. It’s embarrassing for a dog his size. It’s like watching a grown man cry because the shop was out of his favorite ice cream flavor. Also it gets my wife to give him what he wants basically every time, so I can’t even argue with his technique.

The one place we drew the line was bed. I know there are folks who let their dogs sleep in the bed with them, but frankly they’re crazy. A single dog can manage to take up as much space as a full-grown adult in bed, and that’s even before you account for the flailing legs from the running dreams. Plus my dog snores. I was willing to buy him his own bed, but I wasn’t willing to let him share ours.

So at night, the dog goes to sleep in his bed, and we go to sleep in ours. A nearly perfect arrangement—except that the dog tends to wake up in the middle of the night, realize he’s alone, and get sad about it. I’ll hear him wander over to my wife’s side of the bed, his nails going *takketa-takketa* across the floor, and then he’ll stare at her and do those quiet little whines of his, hoping she’ll wake up.

She usually does after a little while. She’ll mutter some not-quite-coherent syllables and put her icy cold feet on me, and after a bit I feel the bed shift slightly and hear the nails on the floor again, *skrickety-tikkety-tik*. The dog gets his attention and stops whining. My wife settles back into bed, and I assume the dog does the same. He’s usually fine until morning after that, but apparently eight hours without human contact is just too much for him.

This is what I thought was going on, anyway. In my defense, I was never more than marginally awake for any of this. Things that should have registered as abnormal or out of place were dismissed as dreams.

I wish I could still call them that.

Recently, my wife was out of town for the weekend. The dog had spent the entire day trying to climb into my lap instead, and by bedtime I was starting to feel a bit crowded. So when he started up his whining routine in the middle of the night and I heard my wife shifting to get up and deal with it, I was glad to have someone else there to give him the attention he needed.

The next morning when I woke up to an empty bed, I was momentarily confused before I remembered that she was out of town. I was halfway through my first cup of coffee before it occurred to me to wonder who the dog had been whining at in the night. More importantly, who had gotten up to stop him?

I told myself it had just been a weird dream. The sequence of events happened so often, I had just assumed that it had gone on last night. Maybe the part where the dog was whining had even been real, and I’d imagined the rest. In the light of day, it was the only explanation that made any sense.

I checked to make sure all of the windows and doors were locked that night, though. I even closed the bedroom door before I got into bed. I knew it was silly, but I didn’t like looking out into that black rectangle of the hallway, not knowing what might be out there waiting for me to go to sleep.

I must have been sleeping more lightly than usual when the standard routine started. It was the nails on the floor that roused me, the *skrickety-tikkety-tik* followed by the slight shifting of the bed as my wife got up to deal with the dog. This all made sense in my barely awake state, and then came the *takketa-takketa* as the dog went back to bed. But then the whining started, and I realized the order was all off. She’d gotten up before he’d started begging for attention. The dog was still whining at the side of the bed, even though I’d clearly heard his nails ticking across the floor twice. And as the bed shifted again and icy cold feet brushed against my legs, I remembered that my wife was still out of town.

I didn’t budge. I lay there listening to those incoherent mutters that I’d always assumed were sleep-muddled syllables, feeling cold hands run possessively along my shoulder and back, and I hoped that whatever was in bed with me couldn’t hear my racing heart.

It only lasted for a minute. The dog’s whining grew more insistent, and finally I felt the bed move again and heard the nails on the floor once more, a sound that I now realized was distinct from the noise of the dog walking around. It was more of a scuttling, scrabbling sound. It disappeared under the bed, and only then did the dog’s whining stop. He *takketa-takketa*’d his way back to bed and settled back to sleep. I, on the other hand, lay awake and motionless for hours until the sun lit up the room.

I did check under the bed, of course. Once it was fully light, and armed with a long stick and a flashlight, but I did look. There was nothing there.

When my wife returned home that afternoon, I asked her how often she dealt with the dog in the middle of the night.

“He’s usually awake and looking at me when I come back from the bathroom,” she said, “but he doesn’t get up from the bed. I wouldn’t really call that ‘dealing with him.’ Why? Was he bothering you while I was gone?”

She turned to the dog. “Did you miss me? Were you worried I was never coming back? Were you having nightmares?”

I wondered if that was all it had been, a nightmare. But if so, why would my wife deny interacting with the dog at night? He whined at the bed most nights.

I set up a camera in the bedroom. I didn’t tell her, just in case this was some sort of weird prank on her part. I needed to know the truth.

Due to exhaustion, I slept like a rock that night. I didn’t even hear the dog whining. But the camera caught it all.

At a little past one in the morning, my wife stumbled her way out of bed to the bathroom. The camera wasn’t recording audio, but when I saw those long, bent fingers worming their way out from under the bed, I knew exactly the noise they made on the floor: *skrickety-tikkety-tik*. The lighting was only good enough to capture vague shapes, but the thing that pulled itself out from beneath my bed had never been human. It was broken and twisted in bizarre ways. The covers moved unnaturally as it squirmed beneath them, pressing its body up against my sleeping form.

I saw the dog come to the side of the bed. His teeth were bared as he whined, a threatening gesture I’d never seen him make. The thing in the bed scuttled away, dragging itself off to vanish under the bed once more. As it went, for just one second its eyes locked with the camera, glittering in the low light. It pressed one angled finger to its mouth in a gesture for silence. Then it was gone.

The dog sniffed beneath our bed for a moment and, satisfied, returned to his own. By the time my wife came back into the room a few minutes later, there was no sign that anything had happened.

We should leave, probably. I could show my wife the footage, and obviously she’d agree to get out. But two things tell me that that wouldn’t be a good idea.

Number one: there’s a thin, ragged slice along the side of my wife’s foot today. I asked her what happened, and she shrugged.

“I must have kicked something when I got up to go to the bathroom,” she said. “I felt it cut me when I got out of bed. I couldn’t find anything this morning, though.”

The cut looks like it could have been made by a sharp fingernail. I’m not surprised that she couldn’t find anything. I didn’t find anything under the bed when I looked, either.

Number two: I take my wedding ring off when I sleep. I went to put it on this morning and discovered that I couldn’t. There’s a thin, ragged cut encircling my ring finger, just as if something dragged its sharp nails possessively around it while I slept.

Of course we should leave. I’m just afraid of what will happen if it [escalates](https://www.reddit.com/r/micahwrites/).
