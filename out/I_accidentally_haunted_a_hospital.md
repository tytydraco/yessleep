I left John’s house shortly after 11pm, the party was pumping and the drinks were flowing; maybe flowing a bit too much in fact. You know that stage of tipsy that’s neither too much or too little, but just perfect (like Goldilocks and the porridge or whatever the fuck they were talking about). Anyway, as much as I’d wanted to stay and drink, maybe get some pussy, It was home time. I had finals the next day and flunking out didn’t sound that fun to me. I smiled at myself in the bathroom mirror, splashed my face with cold water and made my way to the front door, car keys in hand. “Hold up a second”, John said putting a heavy arm around my shoulders, “you’re not planning on driving are you?”. “Yeah, I am”, I said dismissively. He furrowed his brow and said, “be careful, bro” in a concerned tone. “Don’t worry”, I said, “I live 15 minutes away, it’ll be fine.”

It wasn’t fine.

Being in a car crash is a crazy experience. It’s nothing like the movies, in fact, it’s far more cinematic. The crash itself happens in an instant, but the feeling lasts ages—you see every bit of glass as the airbag hits your face with the force of a heavyweight boxer, but that’s just the beginning. Remember how I used the word cinematic? Well, the next part was some shit out of *Final Destination*.

I shouldn’t have been driving. I knew that the moment I fumbled the keys, my vision swimming, the whiskey still burning in my throat. But the arrogance of intoxication is convincing—it whispers that you’re invincible, that you’ve got it under control.

The curve in the road came out of nowhere, or maybe it was always there, waiting for me. I overcorrected, the tires screeched, and then it was just headlights slicing through darkness. The tree appeared as if summoned, massive and unyielding. The car crumpled like paper.

The airbag didn’t even matter. My body was thrown forward, and the belt dug deep into my chest, crushing bone and tearing muscle. Blood coated my hands as I reached up, trying to pull air into my lungs, but it felt like breathing through shattered glass.

I could taste the alcohol mixing with the blood in my mouth. I could feel the cold creeping in. And somewhere in the haze, I laughed bitterly at how stupid it all was, before the silence swallowed me whole.

I woke up in the hospital—or at least, that’s what I thought at first—but something was off. The air was too cold, biting through the thin sheet draped over me, and the sharp smell of disinfectant mixed with something metallic stung my nose. As I blinked against the harsh fluorescent light, I realized the room wasn’t bustling with nurses or the comforting hum of monitors. Instead, it was silent, eerily so, and when I turned my head, I saw rows of steel drawers lining the walls. My heart thudded as I caught sight of the tag looped around my toe. This wasn’t a hospital; I was in the morgue. The pain that filled my body was numbed only by the confusion that wrecked my brain; I couldn’t remember what had happened before this, how the fuck did I end up here? The last thing I remembered was leaving John’s party, so what happened??

I sat up bolt straight, the motion sending the sheet sliding from my bare chest—and that’s when I screamed. A jagged, clumsily stitched cut ran down the center of my torso, the crude black thread stark against the unnaturally pale hue of my skin. My hands trembled as I touched it, half-expecting to feel pain, but there was none—only an eerie, hollow sensation beneath my fingertips. Panic bubbled in my throat as I looked around the sterile room, the stark reality sinking in: something was very, very wrong. I needed to find a nurse or a doctor or a janitor or anyone that could help me understand what was going on. I climbed off the table and sprinted out of the room, my bare feet pitter-pattering against the linoleum floor. After three flights of stairs I found myself in a hospital corridor. It stretched out for ages in both directions; the green walls and white floors scuffed from years of hurried gurney wheels and restless hands and finally I could hear it, the beeping, the heart monitors that signalled that there was indeed life around.

I frantically paced down the hall until I saw a nurse tending to a patient in one of the rooms, and I knew this was my chance to finally understand my predicament. I called out to her, my voice echoing down the empty corridor, but she didn’t even flinch. Desperation clawed at me as I stepped closer, my footsteps once again slapping against the polished floor. “Excuse me,” I said, my voice trembling, but she still didn’t turn. Swallowing my unease, I reached out and tapped her shoulder. The reaction was immediate—she froze, then spun around, her face twisting in raw terror. Her scream shattered the silence, piercing and unrestrained, as she stumbled backward, nearly knocking over a tray of instruments. Before I could say a word, she bolted from the room, her frantic footsteps fading down the hall. I stood there, stunned, my hand still hovering in the air, a chill running through me as I caught my reflection in the room’s window—and saw nothing. Nothing at all.

I bolted down the corridor until I spotted a bathroom sign. I threw the door open, my breath ragged and uneven as I stumbled inside. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a harsh glow over the spotless white tiles. I gripped the edge of the sink, leaning forward to steady myself, and dared to look up into the mirror. At first, I saw nothing—just the empty bathroom behind me. My stomach churned as I leaned closer, searching for any trace of my reflection. And then, like a flicker of static on a dead screen, an image appeared. A face…my face, pale and sunken, eyes hollow and black. But it wasn’t just my face. It was translucent, like smoke struggling to hold its shape. I now understood why the nurse ran away, for what I saw in the mirror was the stuff of nightmares.

It was at that moment that my priority changed. I no longer wanted help; I wanted to escape. Whatever was happening, it wasn’t something that could be explained in words or soothed with assurances. If I was going to figure this out, I needed to get out of this place, away from the sterile walls and harsh lights, and find the truth on my own. I turned away from the mirror, from the hollow reflection that had finally confirmed my worst fear, and pushed open the bathroom door. I sprinted through the endless corridors, my panic mounting with every turn. Doors flew past me, nurses and patients oblivious to my presence as I pushed onward, searching for an exit. Finally, I saw it; the double glass doors at the hospital’s main entrance. My chest swelled with relief as I bolted toward them, but my attempt to step through was like trying to belly flop through a brick wall. The impact sent me stumbling back, though there was no visible barrier. Confused, I reached out, pressing my hands against the air, but it held firm, unyielding, as though the world beyond was no longer meant for me.

Frustration turned into desperation as I pounded against the invisible force, but it was useless. The realization crept in slowly, chilling me to my core: I couldn’t leave. And what used to be fear, turned into anger and what used to be anger, turned into resentment.

“Oh yeah?, If I can’t leave, none of you will either”.
