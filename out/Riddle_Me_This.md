Riddle me this, have your parents ever accused you of insanity since you were a child? Is it normal for any parent to do that? Have they tried to put you at an asylum against your will? Welcome to my world.

For as long as I can remember, my parents always told me that I was crazy when I only did what other kids would do. Play in the mud, in a playground, play baseball; whatever I’ve done, I always seemed deranged to them. They never let me go to school, they barely ever let me leave the house unless it was with the utmost strictest guidance and supervision by either my parents or my two older siblings, a brother, and a sister.

Even when they tried to seem normal, I could sense it in them. They looked at me weirdly, they always gazed at me like a deranged kid. That continued until I grew older and became a proper adult. I tried to get a job, and finally succeded in getting one at a warehouse despite the efforts of my family to sabotage my employment. I never truly had peace and ease of mind until I became independent and rented a small apartment in Brooklyn.

That was the case until one day I got a call from my brother. He spoke vaguely, as if unwilling to explain. He only told me, “Come over, we’ll be waiting.” and never spoke another word no matter how much I called.

I decided to be a ‘good son’ and went there against my will. I realized that it might stay there for some time, so I packed some clothes and equipment and drove to our family house—a lonesome ranch West of New York.

I got there, knocked on the door, and no response came. I knocked again, for minutes, and still got no answer. So I fetched the key from under the mat, where it usually was, and went inside. The house was not much different from how I left it, almost the exact same if not the exact same way I saw it since my childhood. It felt comfortable, yet also bitter to know that most of my childhood was snuffed away by my deranged family in this house.

I relaxed, toured the house, and tried to reminisce whatever memories I could salvage. The beds were the same, and the wallpaper; everything was just as it was so long ago. I tried to relax in the living room. I figured that they were either calling me to keep a lookout on the house while they left for god knows where or were playing a prank on me. It wasn’t unusual for them to call me for unusual requests, most of which I simply hung up on. Can you imagine? My mother once asked me to stick a fork into a socket and told me to kill myself.

They’re lucky I was on vacation, else I wouldn’t have dared do the bullshit they ask of me, only pity and for the sake of a handful of good memories do I do this stuff for them. However, sooner or later, I knew I was going to be bored out of my mind, so I had my friend come over.

His name was Merlin, and he’s the only person I truly trust out of anyone I know. He’s my only friend and I’ve known him for longer than I could remember and had some pretty wild experiences. He’s very chill, for the most part, and he’s always with me and guarding my back.

Though he wasn’t less busy, he gladly came over and tried to keep me company. Before I realized, we were downing beer bottles in the living room while watching some pretty fucked up movies.

“Shit, never watched something like that in a long time. What’s the name of the movie?” I asked.

“Beats me, I dunno what the fuck we’re watching.”

We shared a laugh as we saw the movie credits roll, and then I broke the silence and asked him around some more.

“So, what’s been happening, Merlin? I don’t see you enough, man.”

“You see me more than plenty, dude.” He said and sipped on some beer, “Where’s your family, by the way? Do they usually travel at this time of the year?”

“Not usually, but I don’t care.” I replied, “I don’t really give a shit where they go, I’m just doing this out of pity for them.”

“Pity for them?” He laughed, “Don’t you mean anger?”

“Anger?”

“Yeah, you still hate them for your lost childhood.”

I couldn’t respond at the moment. His words were on the dot, he read me like a book. I don’t want to let those emotions crawl back after I just got over them, but I couldn’t deny how angry I still was at them.

“Yeah, well shit, who can forgive that easily? But I’m getting over it, it’s not worth giving up my life for.”

“What life, dude? You have no life.” He nonchalantly added.

“What the fuck, Merlin?” I retorted, “I didn’t call you here to make fun of me.”

“I’m just saying it how it is. Ain’t it a bit strange to pretend that you have a life when you’re alone in your thirties, working at a shitty warehouse?”

“Fuck off, man. You always do that.”

“I’m just saying. You should probably take your meds, it’ll help more than you think.”

“Fuck the meds, I’m not taking them.” I argued, “I took them for 28 long years, about damn time I fucking quit them. I stopped taking them some weeks ago and I’ve never been happier.”

“They aren’t that bad. It’s just some vitamins.”

“Imagine taking vitamin supplements for eons. Shit, I’m not taking them anymore.”

I was beginning to feel annoyed by Merlin’s constant nagging. It wasn’t an oddity, he usually did those things. We would be sitting, chilling, and chatting before he suddenly brings up a heavy topic and shits all over my mood. He was my best friend, but that’s a habit that he could do well without.

“Look, Merlin.” I said, standing up, “It’s been nice, but I need some alone time.”

“Alright, you’re the boss.” He stood up, and just like that left the house. Once again, not an oddity. However, he was an odd person in and of itself.

Thinking about it, Merlin was strange. My parents hated him, the neighbors hated him, and everyone I knew took unkindly to Merlin, even his ex-wife. Poor guy was never the likable type, most likely due to his weird antics, but he was there for me in the toughest times and I knew him longer than anyone else, except for my family. Naturally, I didn’t want to ruin such a long friendship, but I can’t deny that he was…getting a bit too strange, lately. I suspect that there’s something going on with him, deep inside.

In the end, I shrugged it off, and thought to ask him about it at some other time. I took a shower, got into bed, and tried to sleep this boring day off. But something felt strange. The bed sheets, not just in my room, but all the others, were…moist? Or wet? They certainly felt wet, but no matter how much I scrutinized, I never spotted a single drop of water, not even piss. They were drier than a desert, but the sheets felt wet regardless.

I shrugged it off and slept peacefully. However, for some strange reason, I woke up the next day dead-tired. I woke up feeling dirty, and exhausted, like that once-in-a-lifetime hangover that makes you pray to go away quickly.

I also felt strangely hungry, so I took to the kitchen and opened the fridge. And to my surprise, it was packed full of meat. So much so that I couldn’t even close it back if I didn’t fetch a few slabs out. The amount of meat made me worried, but thankfully, it didn’t look like another person’s flesh. It smelled and looked tastier than an uncooked, fresh beef slab, and that’s saying a lot due to how much I love steak.

I decided to cook some steak and kill time until Merlin crashed by and we ended up watching a movie again. I appreciated how down to everything he was when it came to anything concerning me as if he was anticipating when I’d call him. But he seemed more on edge and passively hostile than I’d ever seen him be.

“What’s up, Merlin?” I nudged him as he sat beside me on the couch, “You seem off lately, man. Everything alright?”

“Oh, everything’s perfect. What about you?”

“I dunno man, I feel like I’m getting pretty worried.”

“About what?”

“About you, Merlin.” I said, “You’ve been seeming off lately, everything okay with you?”

“Me? You’re asking about me?” He chuckled, “I dunno man. I’m alive and well, isn’t there more important shit you should deal with?”

“Like what?”

“I dunno, probably your missing family.”

“They’re not missing, dude. They’re probably just playing pranks on me.”

“How are you so sure?”

“Are you trying to get at something, dude?”

“No no on, obviously not.” He said, giggling. “What if something happened to him?”

His question seemed…concerning. As if he knew something that I didn’t; as if he was suggesting something or coaxing me. I didn’t want to doubt Merlin, but his behavior has been getting too odd for comfort.

“Anyway,” He stood up, “Man, I’m hungry. Wanna eat something?”

“Uh, sure.” I hesitated, “There’s some meat on the fridge. I’ll make some hamburgers if you want.”

“Sure. ‘Till then, mind if I take a look around the house? It’s been a long time since I took a look around.”

“Yeah, do whatever.”

Sure enough, he went upstairs without so much as another word. At that moment, I guess I had decided to ask him after dinner about why he was becoming so hostile. Why’s he even worried about my family? The only thing that I remember between him and them is how much they hated his guts, and the opposite was no less true. So why was he so…thoughtful, all of a sudden?

Regardless, I took to the kitchen and started preparing some meat. Squishing them into balls, flattering them, cooking them, heating up the buns. It was all well until I called him downstairs to eat. He came down the steps with an ear-to-ear manic smile and, what seemed to be, an album

“Uh, Merlin…what’s that?”

“Thought we could reminisce a little after dinner.”

“Dude, you should’ve asked me, don’t just pick up shit from my parents’ house.”

“What? I thought you didn’t give a shit about them.”

“Just…look, let’s eat, and later we can talk about this.”

“You’re the boss man.”

We sat down at the table and began eating. The buns of the hamburger were crunchy, more than I thought they would be, and the meat was rough and chewy. For as tasty and delicious as it looked, it tasted all the more horrible. But I didn’t care, I couldn’t. My mind was elsewhere, thinking that Merlin had something to do with my parent’s disappearance, as horrible as that sounded.

“Hey…” He began, “This meat tastes weird.”

“Yeah?” I wondered, “Well, Dad’s a cheap fuck. He probably bought this some hours before expiry.”

“You hate him a lot, don’t you?”

“Thanks, Captain Obvious,” I said, wiping my hands after finishing the burger.

“No problem, Lieutenant Dumbfuck.” He responded, enthusiastically reaching for the album. “Now, how about some memories?”

“Dude, put it down.” I tried to reach for the album, but he leaned away just as I tried to catch it. “Merlin, I swear to god I won’t fucking call you up anymore.”

“You never did, you dumbfuck.” He responded, much to my dismay. “Anyway, tell me, why do you hate them so much?”

“Merlin, this isn’t funny. You already know why, so give me back that shit.”

“I do, but do you?” He interrupted, “Or probably you got some brain fog fucking up your vision. Want me to make you remember?”

I angrily snatched the album from his hands. I hated that particular one, it covered the latter years of my childhood when I suffered the most. So, I kept it closed and was determined to kick Merlin out before this escalated.

“Merlin, dude, fuck off.”

“Oh, now you hate me too?” He chuckled, “You hate me just like how you hated your mother, who cried tears of blood after your diagnosis. Or your father, who paid thousands of dollars for your treatement. Or your siblings, who tried to support and keep you company even when it cost them their education and career.”

“The fuck are you talking about?”

He motioned for the album, and suddenly I felt a deep terror dwell within my being. To say I was confused was the least of all, but an unspoken curiosity urged me to open the album and see the pictures.

And they were all…normal. I remembered abuse, distancing, so many other things. I couldn’t recall a nanosecond where any of them smiled at me, but they all did in the pictures. I was always the center of attention, the poster boy of the album. Even their complexions were entirely, and completely, different than I ever remember or imagined.

This wasn’t my album.

“What the hell is this?”

“You hate your family because they hate you?” He pulled another album from under his shirt, “Or are you sure it was you?”

“Merlin, what the fuck man?! What’s all of this?”

“Nothing, *man.”* He spoke in a mocking tone and then threw himself over the couch after grabbing a beer bottle from the fridge. “I know where your family is, but you don’t”

He said it so childishly as if he was singing in a mocking tone. I felt rage boiling inside of me as I saw his disgusting mug smirking at me, so I did what I thought was best. I reached for the phone and dialed 911. I knew for a fact, now, that he had something to do with their disappearance.

But he slapped it from my hand, and in response, I pushed him back onto the sofa and grabbed onto his shirt collar.

“You’re the one who fucking did this, huh?!” I screamed, “I thought you were my best friend, you fuck!”

“Friend?” He laughed; a wheezing, manic laugh. “How much do you know about me, friend? I always did stuff to protect you, but you don’t know shit about me!”

“The fuck?”

“You think you know?!” He shouted, “Then riddle me this! When did we meet?”

“Since–”

But then, I froze. As confident as I was with my memory, I was shocked into silence by him. Now that he asked me upfront, I couldn’t remember a single memory in all my life that featured him.

“Hah! I fucking knew it!” He wheezed, “Riddle me this! How did I come in today?”

Those words, quite literally, shattered my life into billions of pieces. I couldn’t, as much as I wanted to, I couldn’t even remember how or when he dropped by today. And right as I blinked, he teleported behind me, looking at me as he shook the vitamin supplement I used to take.

“Time for your meds, Merlin!”

He took one of the pills and wrestled me to the ground, forcing one of the pills down my throat. Right as he did, he forced me to swallow it, and then he disappeared right before my eyes. Not only he but also the view which I had of the house. Everything around me began disintegrating, melting, and getting demolished.

My breath quickened, my mind was racing. I remembered the album he gave me, and I hurried for it before opening it.

I couldn’t fucking believe it.

It was filled with pictures of, what I remember being, Merlin’s life…but it was me, in every single picture. Merlin’s ex-wife was there, dressed in white and holding my hand. And there was I as well, with my neighbors, with my family! Why was I in Merlin’s life? Is it really *his* life?!

Then, I looked around me, and the picture became clear. The house was no longer how it looked like from childhood, nor did it look like a house. The wallpaper was torn apart, the windows were closed. Mold infested the corners, the floor was decaying, the TV was broken, and I was covered in an ungodly, unimaginable amount of dried blood except for my hands.

A horrific smell assaulted my nose and trash was loitered everywhere. I looked around, left and right, and noticed the kitchen. It was only a single flickering light bulb dangling from the ceiling, shining light on the table where the meat was lying.

The meat no longer looked delicious, but grotesque and disgusting, a tone of red I had never seen before. The burger buns were not bread but were flesh, grilled, and heated up, with two layers of skin sandwiching a cooked slab of the meat.

I vomited my guts out. I breathed so fast and heavy that I could’ve sworn I felt my lungs rupture. In that moment of panic, I opened the fridge door, and my eyes fell upon bagged meat, organs, and body parts. I could tell apart a hand and some genitalia in there. And worse of all, a shoulder that I recognized more than I remember, with a birthmark on it that belonged to my older brother.

I couldn’t believe it, nor did I want to believe it. In that moment of disgust, panic, hysteria, nausea, sadness, and so much more, I hurried upstairs toward the bedrooms, and the sight of the scratched walls and broken doorframes was more than enough of a testament to what I was about to witness.

In each of the rooms, excluding mine, blood, piss, and shit were stained on the bed sheets. The smell reeked horribly, and I didn’t know which burned my throat worse. The urge to cry, the urge to vomit, or the smell.

And right as I thought that I had seen it all, I went to my bedroom. And there she lay…my ex-wife. Or at least what was my ex-wife. Her decapitated head was pinned on the wall, her naked dead body was lying on the bed with her hands and feet tied, blood leaking from both her holes and from the disemboweled guts of her, her torso open and spread wide.

I lost all feeling in my knees, and later on, my entire body as I saw, above the bed, a nursery mobile attached to the ceiling, spinning ever so slowly with the decaying heads of my four family members, along with the horrified expressions frozen forever onto their faces.

I then realized I hadn’t been here for two days as I had thought. It was two weeks. I still didn’t believe, wanted to believe, nor could I believe. How could I? I surely am not Merlin, I surely didn’t kill my family. I know I didn’t, how could I? I hated them…wait, no, I loved them. Wait, neither.

What the fuck was it again?

And right as I was losing my mind, he put a comforting hand on my shoulder, and it all seemed to just disappear. I felt at ease, I knew he would always be there for me.

It was my best friend, Landon. My parents never liked him, but he was always there for me to help me through the tough times.

“Come on, Merlin! This isn’t real, it’s just some damn hallucination. You probably haven’t been taking your meds.” He comforted me, “Besides, riddle me this, would you really kill your parents?”

I felt at ease with his reassuring words. But at that moment, a single thought was bugging me that I still can’t find an answer to ‘to this day. Maybe you can help me since my memory isn’t so good.

So, riddle me this. When did Landon get in here?
