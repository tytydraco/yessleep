Emma

Emily was quiet, always that way. Her family and friends called her Emma—a softer, simpler name that seemed to fit her better. She had a gentle smile and a quiet laugh, but there was something about her that people couldn’t quite put their finger on. She wasn’t the type to stand out, but she had a way of pulling people in, making them feel like they could confide in her.

But things began to change. One evening, her mother walked into Emma’s room, concerned when she saw her sitting in front of the computer, her eyes wide and fixed on the screen. “Emma,” her mother said softly, “what are you doing?”

Emma didn’t move. Her lips were trembling, her face pale. It was like she wasn’t really there. “Emma?” her mother asked again, her voice shaking now.

Emma’s gaze was hollow. “I’m watching,” she whispered, but there was no emotion in her voice.

“What are you watching?” her mother pressed, her worry deepening.

“Nothing,” Emma said, shaking her head as if trying to pull herself out of a trance.

The next day, Emma didn’t talk much. She barley ate. Her eyes were sunken, her hands trembling slightly as she moved through the house. Her parents knew something was terribly wrong, but every time they asked her, she simply shrugged and said, “I’m fine.”

Then, one night, she didn’t come home. It wasn’t like Emma to go out late, especially without calling or texting. Her parents called her phone, but it went straight to voicemail. The police were called, and soon the entire neighborhood was searching, but Emma was gone.

A month later, she showed up at their doorstep. Her clothes were tattered, her hair matted, and her eyes empty. She didn’t speak. She barley even moved. Her family tried to ask questions, but she sat there in silence, her face blank.

It wasn’t until they found her laptop that they understood what had happened. Deep in her browser history were forums, encrypted messages, and links to the dark web—a place no parent should ever have to see. Videos, images—they made her parents sick just looking at them. She had been kidnapped. Abused. Sold to a world of horrors they couldn’t comprehend.

Her family tried to bring her back, to pull her out of the darkness, but it was no use. Emma wasn’t the same. She barley spoke, and when she did, her voice was distant, almost robotic. Sometimes she’d sit in the corner of the room, her fingers twitching, her eyes staring at something invisible.

“They’re watching,” she’d say in a hushed, broken voice. “They’re always watching.”

At first, her family thought it was paranoia, but soon they began to see the truth. The darkness hadn’t left her—it had burrowed into her, creeping into her very being. Every night, they locked the doors tightly, kept the lights on, and prayed she wouldn’t leave again.

But no matter what they did, they couldn’t protect her. The nightmares were real. The things she had seen, the things done to her—it was a living horror that consumed her.

One evening, her father found her in front of the computer again. She wasn’t looking at a screen this time—her gaze was locked on something no one else could see.

“They’re coming,” she whispered, her voice hollow. “They know.”

Her father begged her to speak, to tell him what was happening, but Emma only shook her head, tears streaming down her face. “There’s no escape,” she said quietly. “They’ll find me.”

And they did. Every night, they came for her, just out of sight, just beyond her reach. Her family knew there was no saving her anymore—not from the dark web, not from the horror.

Emma wasn’t their daughter anymore. She was something else entirely—something lost in a nightmare that had no end.
