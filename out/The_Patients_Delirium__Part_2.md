Evelyn had been allowed into the common room, a sterile space that was depressingly cheery, decorated with faded posters of smiling people and a large banner reading: “Let us show you how to smile again!”

The other patients shuffled about, most of them too medicated to hold a conversation. Evelyn sat cautiously in a corner, pretending to flip through a magazine. Her eyes scanned the room, searching for anything or anyone that might help her unravel the truth.

A man in a tattered sweater shuffled over to her and sat down without a word. He had thin, wiry hair, and his hands trembled. He stared straight ahead as he whispered, “You’re new.”

Evelyn turned slightly. “Yes. I’m... Evelyn.”

He nodded, lips barely moving. “Doesn’t matter who you are here. They don’t care. None of it matters once they decide you can’t be fixed.”

Her pulse quickened. “What do you mean?”

He glanced around nervously, his sunken eyes darting to the staff members stationed around the room. “Keep your head down. Act like you’re listening. Like you’re... getting better. Otherwise...” He leaned closer, his breath shaky. “They’ll take you down the corridor.”

“Which corridor?” Evelyn asked, her voice low.

“You’ll know it when you hear the screams,” he said. “That’s where they take the ones they can’t help. To make them smile again.”

Evelyn shuddered, remembering the asylum’s slogan. “What do they do down there?”

The man’s hands clenched into fists. “You don’t want to know. Just pretend. Pretend until they trust you.”

Before she could ask more, a nurse appeared at her side, her face a mask of forced warmth. “Evelyn! Time for your session with Dr. Carlson.”

Evelyn glanced back at the man, but he was already slumping away, his trembling hands clutching at the seams of his sweater.

Over the next few weeks, Evelyn played her part. She smiled during her therapy sessions, spoke in soft tones, and nodded at the staff’s reassurances. She swallowed the pills they gave her but hid them under her tongue until she could spit them out later. Slowly, the restraints disappeared. They allowed her to eat in the dining hall. Then they unlocked her door at night, trusting that the sedatives would keep her compliant.

But Evelyn never slept.

She had heard the screams. Faint at first, but unmistakable, they came from the far end of the facility, beyond a door marked Authorized Personnel Only. Every night, she lay awake, planning her next move.

One night, when the staff was thin and the halls were silent, Evelyn slipped out of her room. The flickering lights cast long, eerie shadows as she crept toward the forbidden corridor. Her heart pounded as she reached the door. It was unlocked.

Beyond it, the air grew colder, the walls narrowing into a dimly lit passage. The screams were closer now—ragged, inhuman cries that sent shivers racing up her spine.

At the end of the hall, she found a heavy steel door cracked slightly open. Peering through, she saw a stark operating room bathed in harsh fluorescent light.

Dr. Carlson stood at the center, his pristine white coat stained with blood. Two nurses flanked him, their faces expressionless. On the operating table lay a man, restrained and convulsing as a bone saw buzzed ominously. His face was already partially disfigured—his cheeks carved into a grotesque permanent smile.

Evelyn gagged, her hand flying to her mouth to stifle a scream. She watched in horror as Dr. Carlson adjusted the man’s head and leaned down with a surgical scalpel.

“Another perfect smile,” he murmured, his voice calm and detached.

The man’s screams ceased as the saw whirred through his skull. Evelyn stumbled back, bile rising in her throat. She turned to flee, but a floorboard creaked under her weight.

The sound was deafening in the stillness.

“Who’s there?” Dr. Carlson’s voice snapped, sharp and commanding.

Evelyn bolted, her bare feet slapping against the cold linoleum as she retraced her steps. Behind her, she could hear footsteps, shouts, the metallic clang of doors being thrown open.

She reached her room and slipped inside, throwing herself onto the bed and pulling the blankets over her trembling body. Moments later, her door opened.

A nurse peeked inside, her expression neutral. “Everything alright, Evelyn? I thought I heard movement.”

Evelyn forced a yawn and rubbed her eyes. “Just a bad dream,” she mumbled.

The nurse lingered for a moment, her gaze piercing, before nodding and closing the door.

Evelyn stared at the ceiling, her mind racing. She now knew the truth, but escaping would take careful planning. She couldn’t let them suspect a thing—not until she could expose the horrors of this place.

And as she lay there, the asylum’s slogan echoed mockingly in her mind:

“Let us show you how to smile again.”
