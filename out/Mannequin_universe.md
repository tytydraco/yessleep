THE BUNKER BENEATH

"I'm telling you right now, child, if you go and make even a little single peep out of your pretty little lips, it ain't going to be no pretty for you, ya hear?"
The cold metallic blade that he called "Rusty" was pressed tightly up against her neck, tucked right under her chin.
She knew he meant business because she had seen him kill before. Not only had she seen him kill, but he had taken Mary Bella's life as if she was no more than a mosquito that landed on his arm on a hot Louisiana summer's night.

Mary Bella was her younger sister by two years, and they always stuck together like two peas in a pod. Mama would have given them a whooping had they not. Mama always said, "Now y'all two go ahead and fight as much as you want at home, but when you're out there in that world, you two have each other's back no matter what."
Just thinking about this brought a tear to Anna Lee’s eye. 

Despite the dire situation she was in with Rusty pushed up against her neck, these tears were not for herself. They were for the fact that she was unable to keep Mary Bella, her little sister, protected.
Just as fast as this thought came waltzing into her mind, it walked right out as she started hearing voices and multiple footsteps getting closer and closer.
Uncle Ronnie—at least that's what he told her to call him—gave a little violent tug on her hair while the knife was pressed up against her. He only took the knife away for a moment to make the shhhh sound right by his nose and lips.

Her mind couldn't help but think that the Good Lord was having a bad day when He made Uncle Ronnie; he definitely got slapped once or twice with the ugly stick.
Hardly any light filtered down to them from the outside, only a slight little "devil's sliver" poured from the corner of the trailer where they sat tucked away in the underground bunker.
She knew her Mama. She knew her Mama was tough on them and would yell too much when she was drinking her wine on the weekends, but she also knew that Mama loved them and wouldn't stop until she found them. She didn't want the bad thoughts creeping in again—thoughts of how there was only one of them alive to be found anymore.

In the distance, above the dirt, they heard a voice: "Hey, Officer Peterson! Look, I think I found something over here!"
"Well, I'll be a goddamn pig wrapped in a blanket!" said Officer Peterson with a shit-eating grin on his face. "Well, there's not much to it, even if it did belong to her. I'll take that into evidence, but you pay that no mind now. You're here, so go ahead and keep walking and follow your path. If you see anything else, you give a holler, okay young lad?"

Ricky nodded his head yes, trying to be respectful. He was a good young kid, the same age as Anna Lee. In fact, he’d had a crush on her since the third grade when he first laid eyes on her. They were now in fifth grade.

He had been so tore up since the day she and her sister went missing. He rode his bike to every near town—even to Winstonville, which is eight miles away—to put up "Missing Person" flyers. He wanted to do anything he could to help.
Anna Lee had recognized his voice when he shouted for Officer Peterson. As fond, loving memories rushed over her thinking about Ricky, she got the chills thinking about Officer Peterson.
You see, he was Uncle Ronnie's brother. The two of them had kidnapped her and her sister just over a month ago.

She could hear them, along with other people from the town and volunteers from a few towns over, walking right over them now. Crunching leaves through the forest, knowing that they would never find them below.
The heavy boots of Officer Peterson and the search party crunched away, fading into the distance like a dying heartbeat. The danger had passed, or so it seemed.
Uncle Ronnie let out a long, ragged sigh, wiping sweat from his forehead with a grease-stained rag. He looked at Anna Lee, his eyes filled with a twisted, desperate kind of love.
"We safe now, sugar," Ronnie whispered, stroking the top of her head. "They gone. But we low on rations. Daddy’s gotta go up top to the Mercantile. You stay here. You stay quiet like a mouse in a house, ya hear?"

He checked the tightness of her ankle cuff—loosely, almost carelessly—and climbed the ladder. The heavy hatch groaned open, letting in a slice of grey, sickly light, before slamming shut again. The lock clicked.
Silence returned.
But Anna Lee felt a surge of adrenaline. She wasn't going to wait for him to come back. She wiggled her foot. Ronnie, in his haste, hadn't clamped the iron tight enough against her shin. With a painful scrape that took off a layer of skin, she pulled her foot free.

She scrambled up the ladder. The hatch was heavy, but adrenaline is a hell of a drug. She pushed with everything she had. Creak. It gave way.
Anna Lee pulled herself up into the fresh air. But the air wasn't fresh. It tasted like copper pennies and ash.

[CUT TO: THE EVENT]
Five years ago.
It wasn't a war. It was a mistake. A leak at the Winstonville Power Plant that went critical. The locals called it "The Fry."
The blast didn't flatten the town; it cooked it. The radiation swept through the valley like an invisible microwave. It didn't kill everyone instantly—that would have been a mercy. Instead, it scrambled their neurons. It melted the glue that held reality together.

The townspeople who survived didn't lose their hair; they lost their minds. The isolation drove them into a collective psychosis. A mother might cradle a sack of flour and call it her baby. A police officer might arrest a stop sign for jaywalking.
And a lonely man named Ronnie, who lost his real family in the initial blast, found comfort in the only things that didn't rot. Things that stayed pretty. Things that never grew up and never left him.

[CUT TO: PRESENT MOMENT]
Anna Lee ran.
She ran through the woods, her bare feet slapping against the dead, grey moss. The trees were twisted, leafless fingers clawing at the sky.
"I have to find Ricky," she panted. "I have to find Mama."
She pushed through a thicket of brambles. The thorns tore at her dress, but oddly, she didn't feel the sting. She looked down at her arm. There was a scratch, but no blood. Just a white, chalky line.
That’s strange, she thought. Must be the shock.
She kept running, but her legs were starting to feel heavy. Not tired heavy—stiff heavy.
Clack. Clack. Clack.
Her knees weren't bending right. It felt like her joints were rusting over in real-time. The fluid motion of a terrified girl was turning into the jerky, mechanical motion of a robot running out of battery.
"Help!" she tried to scream.
But her jaw locked. The sound didn't come out as a scream. It came out as a hollow thud inside her chest.

She stumbled, falling forward toward a creek bed. She put her hands out to catch herself.
She stared at her hands in the reflection of the oily water.
The skin wasn't turning pale. It was turning Peach.
The texture wasn't flesh. It was Fiberglass.
The terrified thoughts in her brain—Run, Hide, Mama—started to fade, replaced by a singular, static nothingness. The delusion was breaking. The magic of Ronnie’s madness was wearing off the further she got from the bunker.
She wasn't a girl named Anna Lee. She was "Model 4-A, Summer Collection," stolen from the display window of the J.C. Penney five years ago.
Her vision blurred, freezing into a permanent, painted stare. Her running pose locked into place. One arm up, one leg back. Rigid. Hollow.

She stood there in the woods, a perfect statue of a girl running from nothing, surrounded by the dead, silent trees.
Up on the ridge, Officer Peterson—who was actually just a scarecrow with a plastic badge pinned to its chest—swayed in the wind, watching her with button eyes.
Ronnie would be so upset when he found her. He hated when his family wandered off.

2201 w White Picket Terrace, Maple oak

It was a Saturday morning and the TV was blaring the Macy’s day Christmas parade. Across the TV at this point was the joyous characters of the peanuts crew including Charlie Brown Snoopy and Tweety attached to Strings bringing Joy to families that are there physically and watching on TV alike. 

“ there it is Johnny this was the Golden Era of TV charlie Brown and Snoopy are some of the greatest characters that were ever made every year it still brings a smile to my face and brings me back to my childhood Summers and my grandmother's house watching the peanuts crew and waiting for the Sunday paper to get the funnies” the broadcaster joyfully commented

“ well Chuck I can definitely appreciate that era and it set the standard for cartoons and any broadcasting across networks altogether but of course I am waiting for my generation's favorites which are the Simpsons characters I am told they'll be coming up soon and I’ll tell you what there’s nothing like seeing Homer and Bart and maybe get a glance of an itchy and scratchy as well”

What's that Mama you want to put your soaps on but you know I've been waiting so long to watch this parade, but I…… said the young girl 
In a similar voice almost as if it was the same voice trying to disguise it as a character you hear the reply of “ no honey you’d be a good little squirt and change the channel to channel 2 for Mama and go ahead and move the bunny ears around and try to make sure I get my reception today is the season finale of my soap operas and mama needs to find out what happens with Candice and Bobby “
The young girl rolls her eyes but she obese her mother 
Walk away from white TV is all fuzzy lines and going up and down you can barely make out the picture so she goes to the top and fixes the bunny ears just like Mama Said 
“ papa can I go to the kitchen and start making some cookies I really want a snack and to go outside and play “
Odly enough you hear a reply that doesn’t sound anything like a father’s voice nonetheless “ go ahead pumpkin just make sure you clean up and you’re very careful when you’re using the oven that you have the Nissan okay sweetie and when everything is done you bring daddy a couple of them cookies got it “

Yes papa I promise as she Scampers off 
But you have to the front room is a rocking chair and a lazy boy chair with two figure sitting in them that don’t look like they’re moving at all in fact as you get a closer look you realize they are too mannequins dressed in clothes when is a woman one is a man what are supposedly the little girls parents as she was the one who was not only asking the questions to her parents but she was replying for her parents in their voice 
From the kitchen you can hear her sing it bring around the rosie pocket full of posies hush up hush up We All Fall Down 
Suddenly the soap opera changes and you hear the emergency channel signal sound it is loud and ear piercing followed by a breaking news story 
The news broadcaster says quote as we all have heard there was a nuclear power plant meltdown in the town of Maple Lake officials are saying that the city has been quarantined and that everything is under control and the families that live there are being treated appropriately, all surrounding areas within a hundred mile radius are to also stay in their homes and do no traveling 

After some time in the house passes an aura or said raising cookies within the air little Susie comes running into the front room with the plate full of cookies for her father papa I made them they’re so delicious you have to try that 
Her mannequin mother is still sitting in the Lazy Boy chair but her father is gone and the final few rocks of his rocking chair were just beginning to slow down 
Susie sat they’re in silence with a Blank Stare on her face as if she was a dare in headlights she took a gander at her mother who was still in the same position 
At that very moment she could hear a noise coming from the dark dimly lit hallway from the bedroom on the far right at the end of the corridor

She stood there almost in fight flight or freeze mode, so she she sat the cookies down and a Lowell started stepping down the hallway.
