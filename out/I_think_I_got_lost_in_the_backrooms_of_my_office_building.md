I work in IT for a rather large company split over several office buildings. Today I was sent to one of our more remote buildings that doesn't have a permanant on-site IT team. Employees have been gradually coming back to the workplace after the pandemic, and my job is to walk around the different floors and make sure that videoconference rooms are working, printers are working, and no one is struggling with setting up their equipment.  
  
 I want to start by giving you a little description of the office building, as it is a little unusual and will greatly help you understand what has happened to me.

Our office building is fairly new, and shares a wall with a much older office building. There are 14 floors to our building, half of which cross over to a floor on the adjacent older building. The remaining floors on that older building, which don't cross over to ours, are empty/unused, and I don't have access.

Our elevators are a bit unique in how they work, I have not yet seen this system elsewhere. Elevators themselves have no buttons, except for opening/closing doors, and emergency/security. There are 2 touchscreens on each floor next to the elevators, where you first call the floor where you want to get on, then it tells you which elevator door to take that will take you there.

B1 and B2 are for... logistics and warehouse stuff I guess. I don't think I've ever been down there, I don't have access.  
1st floor is the ground floor. It has the main entrance doors, a security desk, a resting/waiting area, and some back rooms I have no access to.

Floors 2 to 10 are the office floors I get to walk through and support. Our tiny IT room is on floor 2.

Floor 11 is the cafeteria.

Floor 12 is the roooftop, which has a small terrace employees can access.

  
This morning I made a first round of all floors, checked all conference rooms, all printers. Everything was fine. Occupency ranged from about 10% to 50% depending on each individual floor.

However, I believe things started to go wrong when I tried to access the 11th floor to grab something to eat.  
The moment I tried to call "11" on the touchscreen, it called "2". I assumed it was a bug and misfired the wrong touch area, calling the next/closest number, which was 2. No big deal, I thought. When you work in IT, you are conditionned to assume everything is a bug, and you don't even give it a second thought.

  
About an hour later I set out to do a second round of the floors, However this time, things got strange. Very strange. 

Every new floor I got off on had less people than the previous. At the 4th floor, I only met a single person, who was on the phone and seemed in a hurry.

At the 5th floor, I noticed every single floor so far had been linked to a floor on the adjacent office building... which they definitely shouldn't all have been.

At the 6th floor, I noticed a smell that wasn't there on my first round. It smelled like... color pencils. It was this exact nostalgic smell of being in elementary school or even kindergarten, and opening a pencil case full with musty colored pencils and crayons.

At the 7th floor, I noticed the smell being stronger than on previous floors.

At the 8th floor, the pencil smell was overpowering. I also noticed this was the first floor since I begun my second round, that wasn't linked over to the other building. I checked through a window and into the other building, fully expecting to see an empty floor. It wasn't empty. The lights were all off, but I could easily make out the shapes and shadows of chairs, tables, cubicle walls... and people. I could see at least a dozen dark and feature-less human silhouettes in the distance, immobile, facing me.

At the 9th floor, the silhouettes were standing just behind the windows. I could also hear the sound of vaccuming somewhere on the floor. I tried to follow the sound, hoping to find a cleaner, or really just anyone at this point. But I never found the source of the vaccum sound. I followed it around the floor half a dozen times, to no avail. Never once did it feel like I was getting closer, or did it become louder.

I couldn't reach the 10th floor. Nor the 11th, or the roof. Or even the first floor. Whenever I tried calling a floor that began with "1", it immediately called my floor ("2"). All other floors could get called normally. I tried on every elevator touchscreen on every floor. I tried the stairs, but my access card won't unlock any floor except mine. All floor doors in the staircase are solid steel with no windows, I can't see anything on the other side.

I tried calling security, both with the elevator buttons, and from the many emergency phones on each floor, but no one's picking up.

I tried reaching out to my colleagues on our Teams group chat, but they didn't take me seriously. They only laugh-reacted to my messages and sent GIFs and memes about being stuck in a labyrinth... and now they have just completely stopped responding to any of my messages.

Here I am now, alone on the second floor, locked inside our tiny IT room, with nothing but the buzzing of neons and the musty smell of crayons to keep me company. It's been over 3 hours since I last crossed paths with someone here. The sun is still shining high noon, despite it being late afternoon. It doesn't seem to be moving. I'm hungry. The last time I glaced at my door, I'm sure I saw a dark human silhouette staring back at me through the window. Help.
