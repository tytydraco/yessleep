For the past 7 months I've been finding weird photos in my camera roll that I have no memory of taking. The timestamps on them indicate that they were taken late at night and in the early morning when I was asleep. At first I thought I might've been rolling over onto my phone and doing this by accident somehow, but that explanation doesn't make sense given the angles of the pictures. 

I have no real history of sleepwalking, at least not in my adult life. When I was a kid, I did go through a period where I'd sleepwalk when I had to use the restroom, and apparently I peed on the floor a couple of times. Regardless, that's a farsight away from unlocking my phone's 6-digit passcode before navigating to my camera to take somewhat deliberate looking photos. That said, I can't think of any other rational explanation. 

For context- I'm a 24 year old man living alone in a one bedroom basement-level apartment. The complex has been around since the 70s and it's a bit of a shithole, but I stay in one of the more recently renovated units. I've been here for a little over 3 years now and haven't experienced anything like this before. 

This neighborhood is considered the worst part of one of "America's Best Small Towns 2024", so it's still pretty nice. The crime rate is very low and I've never even felt the need to lock my car, but I'm precautious enough to lock up my apartment at night and when I'm out.

The reason I'm elaborating on all of this is because I find it very difficult to believe that anyone but myself would be responsible for taking these photos. I'm not entertaining the possibility of an intruder and I'm certainly not entertaining the possibility of anything supernatural. All the same, the photos are pretty strange. 

The first one was captured on March 2nd at 11:17 PM-

It's of my bedroom door, ajar.
Before anyone jumps to any conclusions- no, I don't usually close my bedroom door before I go to bed. I leave it open slightly because this helps with airflow while the ceiling fan is on, so there's nothing inherently suspicious about the contents of the photo. But it unsettled me when I first saw it. If I'm being honest, it's still unsettling.

Following the first, I noticed several indistinguishable black and blue pictures pop up between April and June. It was 6 months before the second notable photo appeared in my "Camera" folder. 

This one was taken on August 11th at 2:43 AM-

I don't know how to describe it except as a vaguely anthropomorphic shadow. It looks like an almost cartoonish hand reaching out from my door toward my bed. There's nothing in my bedroom that'd cast a shadow that shape.  

I've noticed a few more recently, but they don't have any discernable features; just black and blue blurs again. I'll keep you all updated in the event some new, more readable ones show up.
