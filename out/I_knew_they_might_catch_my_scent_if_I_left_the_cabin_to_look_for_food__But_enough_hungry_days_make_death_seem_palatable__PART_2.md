[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l2ey2b/i_knew_they_might_catch_my_scent_if_i_left_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) My lungs were on fire.  I pushed with everything I had, yet somehow each stride was getting a little shorter, every breath a little faster, and the horrible howling behind me louder.  Instinct yelled to go faster, to run for my life, to stay away from that high, shrill noise.

Logic told me the hard truth: they were catching up.

The headlights were still on, my car sitting useless with no gas.  I didn’t look back, I dared not.  And there was no need to, as their shadows danced across the trees to either side of the road, magnified into horrific proportions.  Once those shadows were the height of mine, I would be dead.

I had to think.  I had to.  It was the only way to get out of this.  The revolver in my sweaty hand had six shots, and I saw three sprinting shadows.  If I could put a bullet into a leg on each of them, it might slow them down enough I could run.  It was long odds.

I wasn’t a bad shot.  But as any marksman knows, there are things that can make you less accurate.  High heart rate is probably the number one.  Flipping around, I tried to get into a steady stance.  My hands shook, and my breath was ragged.  My heart dropped when I saw them.

Dust flew with each footfall, their arms pumping furiously.  They were completely naked, having torn off whatever clothes were on them long ago.  Even silhouetted by the headlights, I could see their mouths wide open, always open, unmoving even when they let out shrill cries.  In a moment, I would have to pull the trigger and seal my fate.  They ran closer, and closer, eyes glinting with a red light.

But their eyes didn’t glow.  Three weeks ago I’d seen one break through a door into a pitch black room as I cowered not ten feet away, and there was no red then.

Looking over my shoulder, the truck was barreling toward me in reverse, faster than I’d ever seen someone back up a truck.  It was swerving around a turn, tail lights bright red.  It was time for a new plan.

I took a shot at the first one, aiming for the middle of its chest.  Almost nothing would kill them, but they still only weighed the same as a human.  The .44 hollow point hit its shoulder.  It spun 180 degrees before smashing into the ground, sliding in the dirt and kicking up a dust cloud.  Running toward the red lights, I took a glance over my shoulder.  The other two emerged from the dust, vortices of it twisting behind them.  They were right on top of me, close enough that I wouldn’t even have time to aim.

“Hit the deck!”  A woman screamed, head out of the window.

I threw myself straight at the ground and closed my eyes.

The roar of the truck’s exhaust was loud as it passed inches over my head, but was nothing compared to the violent sound of bending metal as the two runners slammed straight into the tailgate at full speed.

“Get in!”

The truck had passed all the way over me, so I scrambled to my feet.  I jumped into an open door, the tires kicked up dirt as we sped up the hill, and it felt like I was in shock, unable to comprehend what was happening.

“You okay?”  A man asked.  He was driving.

“Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.”

A woman in the passenger seat held a shotgun.  She was looking me over, seeing if they’d gotten to me.

“You can check me once we’re down the road a bit.  I won’t take any offense.”  I said.

Then I threw up on the floor.

My heart was still pounding, beating so hard I could feel it through every inch of my aching head.  The gun shook in my hands, so I just put it on the seat next to me.  It was then that I noticed the boy sitting on the other side of the back seat, holding perfectly still.  He looked maybe ten years old.

“Sorry.  For barfing.”  I said.

“That’s alright, we’re just glad you’re alive.”  The woman said.

We made introductions.  The man’s name was Luke, the woman Sherry, and the boy Matt.  I told them my name.

“You with anyone, Anthony?”

Still breathing hard, I struggled to choke out an answer.

“No.”

I began sobbing.

When I awoke, the truck was stopping.  There was a glimmer of dawn in the east, a faint blue where the stars were fading.  It looked like I was going to survive the night.  I checked the seat for my gun, but it was gone.  Sherry saw me, and handed it back.

“Didn’t want it loose back there.”  She said, in hardly more than a whisper.

“I can’t thank you enough for your help.  I haven’t seen anyone else in uh… three weeks now.”

“Oh, there’s still a few of us around.”  Sherry said.

It was night time, so we used hushed voices.  Anyone still alive knew that by now.  A faint howl echoed down the valley, from somewhere distant.  I took a deep breath, and released it.  That had to be over a mile away, their calls travelled so far.

“We’re safe enough here, those things don’t smell cars nearly as well as people on foot.  This is a forest service road, there’s no houses or anything on it for them to stay in.  I’m going to try and get some sleep, you should try to do the same.  This is the best I’ve got for a pillow.”

Luke handed me a rolled up winter jacket, which I gratefully accepted.  I took the floor mat out and cleaned it the best I could, before finding a patch of pine needles a little ways from the truck.  We slept an hour or so before the sun woke us up.

Sherry gave me a granola bar and some water.  Matt had a pair of binoculars, and sat on the roof of the truck looking at birds.  He was far enough away not to hear our conversation.

“Well, Anthony, I’m glad you’re alive,”  Sherry sighed, running her hand through her hair.  “... but this is the last of our food.  There’s a place we can go to trade, but we don’t have much.  Guns and ammo sell fine, but we need what we’ve got.”

“I’ve got a pack full of food in my car.  Good stuff, rice, jerky.  How much gas have you got?”

“Maybe a hundred miles.  I’ve only got that much ‘cause I’m careful with it, though.  Your car’s about six miles back, we can walk that, then drive to the Outpost.”

I drank the bottle of water they gave me, fighting the urge to chug all of it.  My stomach was growling, even after the granola bar.  These people were being kind to me, but there was an unspoken severity to our situation.  It was late September now, and the snows would hit by November at the latest.  Out here, snow rendered the roads completely impassable until at least April; there were no ploughs.  

Those things didn’t do well in the winter, but neither did humans without a good roof and four months of food.

I didn’t want to be knocked unconscious and dragged away into the night, to a dark room with rags shoved under the doors.  But starving to death in the snow for months didn’t sound any better.  Desperation could make people change.  I’d seen it.

“Yesterday, I walked to a house back by Hudson Creek.  The pantry was packed with food, non-perishable stuff.  It was an old couple’s place.  Type that’s prepared to get snowed in all winter.”

“Let me guess why you didn’t stay.  And why those howlers found us last night.”  Sherry let out a bitter laugh.

“I’m so sorry, I didn’t know you were there...”

“I don’t need an apology.  Nothing to apologize for.”  Luke’s voice was firm.  “I need you to show me where that house is.  We’ve been looking.  Everywhere.  There’s not a lot of food around, and game got real thin about two months into all of this, when everyone and their cousin started hunting.  If we’re gonna survive winter, we have to go back.”

All I could think about was that silent closet, the door to the bathroom with rags packed under it.  I now knew that three wide open mouths were breathing slowly behind it, in a deep sleep the last time I’d gone in.  If I went back, would I become [the fourth?](https://www.reddit.com/r/patrickmullensauthor/comments/1kern3o/patrick_mullens_written_work/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
