I can’t quite put my finger on one single thing that’s wrong but there’s so many things that feel and have felt slightly off, and of course there’s the dreams.

Have you ever had a recurring nightmare?

It started at the same time as everything else. I can’t see, I can’t hear, I can’t even feel anything. That is anything except the hollow gnawing as beetles scurry through my insides, eating through whatever is left of me.

Yes, Beetles. Bizarre right?

More bizarre is that there’s no pain; just resignation. And then I hear a voice. It is the most beautiful voice in the world.

“Awaken,” she says. And then I am awake; the dream is over and the absence of sensation fades and I feel revulsion and horror. Is it really a nightmare if I’m only terrified after I wake up?

The thing that is most concerning to me is that I was rarely plagued by this dream near the start of all this, but for the past three weeks, it has been every night, and every night the last week the visceral horror upon awakening has become more and more pronounced. Last night for the first time I heard her voice again. “Protect what’s yours,” echoed in my ears after I sat up in bed and her voice was no longer warm and kind it was cold, harsh and imperial. I felt in my bones an implied threat, and I could not for the life of me understand why.

Lillian turned over next to me making a sleepy grumble, my abrupt awakening having once again disturbed her night’s rest. It wasn’t quite a full moon tonight, but there was still enough phosphorescence spilling through the window for me to make out the dim outline of her form, her face, her hair. God, I loved her so much in that moment. I love her so much right now, too. A righteous protective anger filled me and I knew, I *knew* that someone was trying to take her and the kids away from me. Hairs prickled on the nape of my neck. Someone was in the house. A strange sensation came over me it was as if I could feel him as he crept through the kitchen. It never occurred to me at that moment to wonder *why* I was suddenly possessed of this extra sense, but I trusted it implicitly.

Before I talk about what happened next, you’ll need to know more. More than just the dreams, some of the other strange things that have plagued me this past year.

So, it turns out I like eating mushrooms. Odd? Not particularly. But near the start of all of this, we had a Sunday family dinner which was tradition after I came back from my regular weekend hunting trips.

When the kids brought the plates over, Lillian and the kids had mushroom gravy over their steak and potato whilst I didn’t. I was confused by this as my mouth was watering looking at them. I stood up and took my plate over to the pot. Maggie the family dog had been strange since I’d gotten home so she was hiding behind the island bench. She yelped, showed me her teeth and fled to the living room. This was sadly the first signs of the prgressively more aggressive behavioural changes that she exhibited over the next few months. More on that later.

I helped myself to some gravy which earned me expressions of incredulity from my family which I didn’t understand. I looked askance at Lilly and she gestured to the delicious looking pile of brown mushroom gravy now coating my steak and asked “Since when?”

I didn’t understand and indicated as much.

“Fungus is Fungus,” she quoted at me as if it was a phrase I should know. “If it could theoretically grow between my toes, it shouldn’t pass betwixt my lips!”

It sure sounded like something I would say, because I do love to sound smarter than I am, but I had no memory of disliking mushrooms or having any such personal saying. I was perturbed by this seeming gap in my memory, but some instinct led me to brush it off so I said something along the lines of "people can change". As soon as I began eating I realised I was *ravenous.* It was as if I hadn’t eaten in forever and I enjoyed that steak and mushroom dinner perhaps more than any other meal before or since. Lillian looked at me strangely that night, and I’m sad to say that she has looked at me in the same manner many times since.

I wish I could say that she was the only one. When I still had a job and was going into the office, my colleagues would comment on the amount of sugar I was putting in my coffee. I *like* sugar in my coffee! I’ve always liked sugar in my coffee, but the office folk kept insisting I used to take my coffee black and unsweetened. Bizarre right? I'd like to say that all this had something to do with me losing my job, but unfortunately not. Accounting used to feel so easy, you know? But all of a sudden it was like it became harder and harder to make the numbers match up and investigate indiscrepancies. Before the last year I was on the fast track to management, but once I started making mistakes and losing clients they were forced to let me go.

Naturally after that I had to spend more time at home looking for work, and it was then that Maggie began exhibiting more aggressive behaviour. We tried months of dog training that we could no longer afford due to my difficulties in finding a new job, and yet nothing seemed to work. She had bitten me on five separate occasions before we had to put her down. Obviously I was a grown man and could put up with a few little nips and Luke was old enough to know to steer clear of her if she was acting aggressive, but we couldn’t take the risk that she would hurt little Mia.

I wasn’t sad when she went to sleep on that cold stainless-steel counter, which was strange. Maggie had always been my dog first and the family dog second, and yet I found no tears coming even as Lillian comforted the children. I think that day I saw Luke looking at me with hatred in his eyes, and that hurt me more than the death of a dumb animal ever could.

Which brings us back to last night I guess.

I found my intruder in the living room crying in front of Maggie’s urn on the mantlepiece. Before confronting him, I'd retrieved my hunting rifle and ammunition from the safe. It occured to me that I needed to clean it. It felt strange and unfamiliar in my hands, which was odd, but not entirely unsurprising seeing as for some reason I hadn't felt like hunting for around a year.

I left the lights off but could somehow see him clearly in the dark. He was my height but there was something *wrong* about him. One moment he was a man wearing ragged and worn out hunting gear and the next moment he was a tall white furred figure with sweeping majestic antlers touching the roof.

“My Maggie,” I heard him whisper. “What did she do to you? What did *it* do to you? I’m so sorry.”

“Hey! Asshole!” I shouted as I turned on the table lamp by the door, taking aim with my rifle. “Wrong house, Mother-Fu…” I was cut off in shock as I saw him in the light. He wasn’t just my height. He was *me*.

I could hear Lillian and the kids stirring at the noise. I knew whatever was going on, I had to handle this quickly in order to keep them safe, but he, me, *other me* rushed me and pushed the rifle to the ground. I hesitated and he was able to disarm me handily. He should not have been able to do that. I was a veteran. I knew how to fight.

“Sticks!” he growled as he pushed me up against the wall, his forearm jammed into my neck making it difficult to breathe. Even in the incandescent light of the electric lamp I had turned on, to my eyes he would switch from a clone of me to some bestial furred antlered creature with my face. “You are nothing more than a pile of sticks! I Watched her *make* you!”

And for a moment my heart stopped. There was something fundamentally *true* in his words that I didn’t understand. I still don’t.

“Protect what’s yours.” The voice came again as if from the very air itself. I know he heard it too because he released his hold on me and whirred around the room trying to pinpoint the sound.

“A year and a day I gave you! The price I paid! He has no right to be here! No *right*!” his eyes glowed with some unearthly power. I knew what I had to do. Protect what was mine. I eyed the rifle that now rested impotently on the plush carpet.

“Evan!” called Lillian from upstairs. “I’m calling the police!”

All the fight went out of my doppleganger, and he deflated. He took what appeared to be an involuntary step towards the stairs as he breathed my wife’s name. “Lillian.”

That was the straw that broke me. She was *my* wife. This was *my* family. *My* house. I lunged for the rifle, but he was faster. He dived so my shot only winged him, and then he plunged through the window. The way he moved was so sleek, so efficient like the deer he, *I* used to hunt. My aim isn’t what it used to be and my second shot went wide.

“Evan!” screamed Lillian and she came rushing downstairs into my arms. I held her with one arm as I held the rifle in the other.

“It’s okay honey. Shhh. He’s gone now”

I stared out the shattered window into the night, waiting for the police to arrive wondering what I was going to tell them.

Sticks, he said. A pile of sticks.

The memory of beetles gnawing through my inside made me shudder.

*Protect what’s yours.* It was time to start hunting again.
