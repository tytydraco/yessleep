For my fantasy football punishment, my friends told me I had to spend a night inside a men’s clothing store after closing.

They gave me a white mask.
Thick. Heavy. Almost like plaster.

I had to wear it and stand completely still until morning, pretending to be a mannequin.

At first, I thought it was a joke.

“Wait, the whole night?” I asked.
“Yep,” Frankie said. “Don’t move, don’t get caught. We’ll be in the parking lot watching.”

The mask was suffocating. I could barely breathe.
I went inside twenty minutes before closing, pretending to shop, then slipped toward the back and found a corner with a few mannequins lined up.

When the last customer left, I put the mask on, tucked my hands in my pockets, and froze.

The lights dimmed.
I heard keys jingling, a vacuum running, and the manager giving directions.

Eventually, it was just three people. The manager and two employees.

They finished cleaning.
They locked the doors.
Then they just... stood there.

And that’s when things got wrong.

They started undressing.
No talking, no laughing, no reason.
They stripped completely naked.

I thought it was a prank. Then the woman started crying. Loud, ugly crying.
The man next to her did too.

The woman got down on all fours and her coworker positioned himself behind. Then they started doing *you know what*. 

The manager was just watching them. Doing *you know what* to himself while it was happening.

After the man *finished*. The blood left his face. He looked as pale as a ghost. He looked terrified.

He lay down on his back, arms and legs spread wide like a starfish.

The manager picked up a briefcase from behind the counter, set it on the floor, and opened it.

Inside was a brown robe covered in stitched symbols, and a long golden dagger.

He put on the robe, knelt beside the man, and whispered something I couldn’t really hear. It didn’t sound English. 

Then he raised the dagger and stabbed him in the chest.

I heard it.
I *felt* it.

The woman screamed, then covered her mouth and sobbed harder.
The manager didn’t stop.
He carved into the man’s chest slowly, deliberately, until the man stopped moving.

Then he did something I can’t unsee.
He started…eating him.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even blink.
The mask felt like it was melting into my face.

The woman disappeared into the back and came back with cleaning supplies. Bleach, a mop, towels.

The manager finally stopped, and calmly packed the robe and dagger back into the briefcase.

Then he started walking toward me.

*I’m dead*

My heart was pounding so hard I felt it in my throat.

He stopped right in front of me.

Then he grabbed the mannequin standing to my left instead.

He and the woman dragged it over to the body.
And they *opened it*.

The mannequin cracked down the middle like a shell. It was hollow inside. I heard air rush out, like a vacuum seal breaking.

They stuffed the corpse inside, sealed it shut, and dressed it again.
When they brought it back, it looked completely normal.

Same pose. Same clothes. Same blank stare.

The woman was shaking. The manager put his hand on her shoulder.

“You can go home now, Katie,” he said softly. “It’s been a long day.”

“Yes, Master,” she said, voice trembling.

She started walking toward the fire exit, then froze.

“What about... him?” she asked.

The manager turned toward me.

Even through the mask, I felt him looking straight into my eyes.

He smiled. Blood still stained his teeth.

“What about you?” he said.

I couldn’t breathe.

“You’ve had quite the night, haven’t you?”

He waited. Like he wanted an answer.

“Go ahead,” he said. “Tell them what you saw. Go to the police. Bring them back here. Tell everyone. See who believes you.”

That was enough. I ran.

I crashed through the fire exit and nearly knocked over the woman on my way out.

*Thank you, God* 

My friends were still waiting in the car, they hadn’t left me yet. 

They were laughing, until they saw me sprinting toward them.

I was screaming before I even reached the door.
“Drive! Go! Please, go!”

They went pale.
Frankie slammed on the gas.

They tried to ask what happened, but I couldn’t speak. I was shaking, tears ran down my face. I was vomiting into my lap.

I told them what happened. At first they didn’t believe me but quickly they realized I was deadly serious. 

I went to the police station.

Nobody believes me.

They said the store’s cameras shut off early that night.
They said the manager and both employees were “accounted for.”

But I saw it. I swear to God I saw it.

And I keep hearing his voice in my head, over and over.

> “Tell everyone. See who believes you.”
