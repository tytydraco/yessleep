The soft glow of my laptop screen cast flickering shadows across my dorm room walls as I sat alone at my desk, the silence broken only by the sound of my own breathing. With a sigh, I clicked on the familiar bookmark: "this person doesn't exist."

The website loaded, revealing its array of eerily realistic faces, each one generated by some complex algorithm. It was a strange fascination, this digital gallery of non-existent people, but it offered a brief escape from the boredom of my college life.

As I scrolled through the faces, my curiosity turned to unease. Some of them seemed too real, too familiar, as if they were plucked straight from the depths of my memory. I shook my head, trying to shake off the feeling of dread that crept over me.

But with each click of the mouse, the faces grew more and more uncanny, their features blending and morphing in unsettling ways. I could almost see the faces of my friends, my classmates, staring back at me from the screen.

And then, it happened. In the midst of the digital sea of faces, I saw her – Sarah, my classmate, her smile frozen in pixels. My heart skipped a beat as I reached for my phone, my fingers trembling as I searched for her contact information, trying to tell her about my uncanny find.

But there was nothing. No social media profiles, no phone number, not even a single picture of her left on my phone. It was as if she had never existed, as if she had been erased from the fabric of reality itself.

I tried to push the thought from my mind, thinking that my phone was just having some issues, but the feeling of dread only grew stronger with each passing moment. 

Days later, during a computer class, I saw it – my classmates gathered around a laptop, their eyes fixed on the screen.

My breath caught in my throat as I recognized the website they were browsing "This person doesn't exist". I told them about the creepy experience I had with the website, but they laughed it off, one of them saying "and who exactly is that Sarah supposed to be?".

It took me a few moments to comprehend what he said but once it clicked in my head I was certain, this website erases people from existence.

One by one, my classmates appeared on the screen, as they continued reloading the page, their faces contorting and twisting in the eerie glow of the laptop screen. 

And then, as soon as their faces were on the screen, they were gone, leaving behind nothing but empty chairs and fading memories.

However, nobody except me seemed to notice. It was like the website was mocking me for finding out its true purpose.

As my classmates continued reloading the page I could only watch helplessly as they disappeared one by one. 

Soon enough I was alone, surrounded by the empty chairs where my friends and classmates sat mere moments ago. 

With trembling hands, I reached for my own laptop, my heart pounding in my chest as I navigated to the website one last time.

And there, staring back at me from the screen, was my own shocked face, occupying the exact spot where I sat in the empty classroom.
