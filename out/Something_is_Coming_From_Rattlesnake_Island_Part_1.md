About a year ago I went on vacation to New England to stay at my cousin's lakeside vacation house. The drive felt like a journey to a different kind of existence, at least after you’ve passed the big east coast cities and got off of the garden state parkway. Then, the only thing towering over you are the sheer rock faces that hug the curving roads, and the trees that catch the sun and provide a pleasant shade for the earthy backroads.



The last town we passed through was a place called Rines, whose only real notoriety comes from its railroad junction and ice fishing on the lake in the winter. Before long, the roads grew smaller and less busy and soon the trees around us dispersed just enough to grant a solid view of the Lake, which was glistening Green and Silver in the mid-afternoon sun. It made the 8 hour trip a long-forgotten memory before it had even ended. Rich green mountains pushed their peaks above the waters in the distance, and the small islands that dotted the lake swayed their fuzzy treetops. When the wheels finally stopped in the driveway of the house, I was so excited I almost hopped out before turning the car off. The warm air of the lakeside woods was sweet and smelled of pine and sap. It was such a pleasant change from the cramped air of the car that smelled like emptied chip bags and energy drinks. The smooth marble-like water was tempting to anyone, and my cousin, Rick, was already itching to dive in. He lived up there and said he’d wait until I arrived to go swimming. His dry swimsuit proved that he didn’t betray his own words. A lot of my family that lived up there told me that I’d feel closer to the earth, and within the first day I already had. 



Those words rang true throughout the trip, as Canoeing, fishing, hiking, and swimming kept me and Rick busy all week. From sunrise until far past sunset, we would be swimming and nobody would stop us. We were so confident in our swimming that Rick and I hatched a plan to swim from the mainland to an island that sat in the middle of the lake that he said was haunted. It was called Rattlesnake Island, because its shape resembles a snake curled into a circle. We debated on it for a long time and our parents must have heard one of us talk about it and they told us to stop, saying that we would get hurt or go missing. They told us that there was a high rate of drownings in this area, but we brushed them off because we had both swam in high school and had high endurance. Although, as the week came closer to ending, we knew we would have to make our move soon. 



That Thursday morning, we got up while the sun was rising and I made a champion’s breakfast out of two Pop-Tarts and an apple. Afterwards, I walked down to the beach while Rick put his swimsuit on. I stood at the dock and took a long look at Rattlesnake. Its “head” was visible from this side and the sleeping giant seemed as if it could get up and slither away at will. The way the tall, thick trees stood firmly together and created a solid green palette on top made the forest look less like bark and leaves and more like the skin or scales of a beast, sleeping in the middle of the lake. Once Rick was ready, we ran to the end of the dock and leaped off to get a strong head start.



The first ten minutes were a breeze for me, my high school states swimming career definitely helped. But as we approached the island, the waves of the lake went from being a nuisance to what felt like impossibly large walls of water that put a monumental strain on us.  The first houses that we were able to get a view of really did seem haunted. You weren't able to see these buildings from the mainland, and the trees swelled around them, trying to hide them from curious eyes. The short wooden shacks were slightly lopsided and quite bare. They were peculiar but all of them were similar, sharing the same flat roofs and narrow windows, they were even all painted a similar shade of off white. We reached the island and sat on the rocky beach for a solid 20 minutes catching our breath and collecting sand in our swim trunks. 



“So do we just head back now?” I asked, feeling unsatisfied that we planned to do this “adventure” just to turn around immediately once we completed our goal.



“Nah we should check this place out, I mean nobody has used this island for at least a decade now, so we have the place to ourselves.” We both stood and started a slow meander across the sand.



“Why’d they never make any other use of this place? It would be perfect for some multi-million-dollar vacation homes” I asked.



“Eh I don’t know, after the old ass houses here were abandoned, it should have been renovated. They used to have a small government building here that would, like, monitor the wildlife or something, I don't know. I only heard my ma talk about how it got too flooded out here one summer and they abandoned it” Rick said with a dismissive shrug.



Just a couple dozen steps from the beach there was an overgrown, but present trail with the rotten bottom half of a wooden pole sticking up from the ground. Its better half was sitting in the bushes nearby. I went to pick it up and saw that it was a marker labeling the different trails nearby. They were mostly illegible but the red paint that remained spelled out: “PO    OF   AL N” to the left, and “ OU    F  WO  S  P” to our right.



With all the missing letters we couldn't figure out what either side was meant to say. It didn’t matter though since the right path was covered in shrubs and thick greenery. We could have gotten through but not without great effort and a ton of scratches. 



The trail we were on led us through a lane of dense trees. Not enough to feel immediately cramped but packed together close enough so you couldn’t see too far off the trail from where you were. There were some edges of houses or smaller buildings that we could see just off the trail, barely visible. It made me think about how many more there were out in the woods that had been grown over. The trees grew even denser as we left the shore and struck deeper into the heart of Rattlesnake.



The buildings in this area went from slightly damaged like the ones around the perimeter of the island to being almost obliterated in some cases. I wondered what had happened to this community, which seemed to have been flourishing, the houses were all built close together, and there were quite a few for how big the island was.



We must have been in the center of the village because there were a couple larger buildings that seemed more important than the others we had seen. One was a long building that used to have a large, arcing roof but had been knocked down by the weather, the only remaining suggestion of what it had once been the almost black wood that made up the frame. Rick and I walked over to the other large building nearby, this one was taller and less wide as the previous one. On closer inspection we saw through the many windows, a room full of bunk beds and drawers. It was like something you would have seen at a summer camp where kids stay away from home for a week. The weird thing about it was that there were clothes scattered on the ground, and most disturbing to me was the stack that was neatly folded on the wardrobe furthest from the door.



I thought about the last moments that person had in their room before something caused them to leave it here. I was about ready to head back when Rick called me over from further down the path. I didn’t realize he had gotten that far from me, and I went over to meet him.  



“Dude, there’s a ton of clothes scattered on the floor in that building.” I told him once I caught up.



“For real? Do you think some homeless people came here after this place was abandoned?” He kept his voice low and cool, but I still heard a soft tremble that told me he was beginning to feel uneasy about this too.



“Well, if they’re homeless how would they even get on the island?” I was making excuses in an effort to calm myself down. I made a lot of excuses for what it could have been, a summer camp, a town hall sort of thing, even a boot camp might have made sense, but none seemed to be right. My mind was racing, and I was getting nervous. 



“I don’t know, I mean, we got here easily enough.” 



“No man, I think something is up, there has to be a reason everybody left this place. I think we should go too.” 



“Ok, we might circle back to the beach if we keep moving on this path” he said, seemingly not as terrified as I was beginning to be. We had been walking on this trail for close to an hour, but we had no clue how much further we would have to continue to reach our side of the island again. I glanced around to look for any more signs that could tell us where to go, but I found none. Rick seemed more confident and levelheaded than I was, so why wouldn’t I have followed his lead? He was older anyways. Plus, he would always be in charge whenever our parents left us at his house together. So, I went with him on the pale dirt path passing deeper into Rattlesnake.



The path had much more shrubbery and plants on the sides, creating great walls of leaves and twigs, yet the trail itself seemed to get clearer and more firm under my feet as we moved on. We walked for what seemed like another half an hour before coming to a part of the trail so dense with plant life that we had to almost squeeze between two trees with a sign bolted onto one of them, it read in red paint: OL  O  H   NG. 



Rick went before me and when I pushed through, I was in awe. There were strapping, tall trees in a huge ring around a large pond of solid-like still water. The water was even more beautiful than the lake itself. A sunny ray beamed down from the circle of visible sky above the tree line and reflected off of the soft surface of the water to cast fuzzy rainbows on the undersides of the warm green leaves. A beautiful statue of a woman stood on a small patch of land that peaked out above the water in the center of the pond. Although made from a solid white stone that I could not identify, her hair seemed so soft that I thought it would fall from her bare back and swing down past her arms, she was kneeled over with her hands and hair draped over her face. At the base of the statue there was a gorgeous bowl or basket that was woven with golden strands, a dark green silk was laid inside and a royal blue cloth sat cradling it, also lined with gold.



The woman remained still as the water in the pond, my cousin did not, and it wasn't until I heard the sloshing of the shallow pond water as he waded his way towards the statue that I shouted for him to come back. He replied, without turning, with a single finger held up. I was pissed.



What the hell is he thinking?  He reached the statue and looked down into the golden basket and a pale, folding turquoise light filled his eyes as he slowly reached down into it. When he lifted out his prize I saw why he did it. It was a palm sized cyan pearl, which looked similar to a shell, but seemed too ovular in shape. I opened my mouth to tell him to hurry up when from behind me, there was a deep guttural gasp that was long and drawn out, as if someone was taking their last dying breath.



I whipped my head around to see who it was and saw a gaunt, bald man in a long red robe whose age-lined face was contorted into terror, his eyes were wide and his pupils tiny. His large mouth was stretched as wide as he could open it. I couldn’t even move to run away when he screamed so loud and desperately, he sounded like he had just been sawed in half. His shriek filled the air he sent birds in the trees flying away and ripples in the pond as he charged at Rick and blew straight past me. 



“Put that thing back Rick!” I said, running after the creepy man and towards Rick. He didn’t listen, instead putting the pearl in his pocket and winding his arm back. The man’s screams of nonsense and panic were shut up with a solid thwack as Rick’s fist slammed into the man’s nose. There was barely a moment of quiet when we heard another deeper and equally terrified scream come from where we entered. There stood another bald man and woman dressed in the same way as the first man, with long gowns and small colorful hats. They stared at us with horrific disbelief before looking down at their fallen friend and running away from the entrance. At that moment my head immediately went to all of the many houses that we thought were abandoned and how many may be coming right now. I ran over to Rick and yanked him towards the exit on the other side of the pond.



I peeked my head out of the ring of trees to make sure nobody was there, pushed through the weaker twigs then started running as fast as I could, Rick right behind me. The trees stood close together and limited our vision. We could see about 10 feet off the trail in either direction, we tried to get our bearings and look for any recognizable landmarks but didn't see any. I thought I had seen wisps of things moving between the trees, like quick brushes of some animals weaving between the trunks. We passed a small church looking building, with smashed stained glass that had every shade of green and blue and purple splashed together. It was as we passed the building that the density of the forest was getting worse, and so was our sightline of what was out there. We heard them though, the swift, pounding, desperate footsteps closing in on each side of that endless path. We kept running all the faster until we saw a wall of vines and leaves that seemed familiar. When we reached it we saw the beach we arrived on just through the shrubs as the heavy footsteps behind us got louder and louder.



We started pulling on the vines as hard as we could. I felt tingles all across my back as I imagined them stepping onto the path and capturing us while we were sitting ducks. While tearing and punching and kicking I gave in and looked behind us to see more people dressed in robes hurtling towards us. With the strength of desperate survival, we were able to clear a way through the dead vines that hung in front of us. We climbed through, Rick first, and just as I was about to cross through, one of them got a fleeting handful of my shoe, but with a kick I was able to clear the foliage. We ran as hard as we possibly could, dove into the water and swam away. The people running after us only got a couple feet into the water when they seemed to start freaking out. One even yanked another one back towards land. I was confused until I felt the drop of rain on my nose. I looked up and saw that our sunny day had changed into a dark, charcoal gray sky.



The waves as well as the wind were now twice as strong, and the low gurgles of thunder made me feel an evilly cold chill down my back. We were freezing and terrified as we swam back, and the deep rumbles of the storm warned us of our danger the whole way. The total swim would take us about 25 minutes and halfway through we were both ready to give up. Rick let out a winded gasp and I looked over expecting him to go face down with exhaustion. Instead, he was treading in place and looking straight down. I asked if he was ok and he said that a big fish brushed up against him. I told him he had bigger things to worry about, and we continued swimming. Another couple minutes later, just as we were about to reach depth where we could stand, he threw his head out of the water and yelped.



“Ow!” 



“What’s wrong this time?” I snapped.



“I think that fish bit me!” he replied. And when we reached the shore he bounded out of the water and climbed out onto the sandy beach. To Rick’s credit, It did seem like he had gotten bit, because his string on his swim shorts had been pulled all the way out and was frayed at the end.



“Damn you weren’t kidding, was it after your worm?” I chuckled.



“No,” he said smirking, he reached into his pocket “Probably wanted a piece of this.” He pulled out the small pearl and turned it in his hand, admiring it as the fractals of light danced in his face. 



Furiously, I marched over to him and got right up in his face, having to stand extra straight because he was a couple inches taller.



“Why do you still have that? That was theirs and it was the whole reason that they were coming after us!” 



“Yeah, well they're over on that island and we got off of it” he never took his eyes off of the oval ivory. I took a swipe for it.



“Listen to me,” I said as he pulled it back and looked at me with great offense. “You can be a real ass sometimes but even you wouldn’t steal from poor people who obviously have some mental issues.”



“Yeah, you know what, I will. Because if they wanted help they should have come back to the mainland. This is probably worth something real nice if I go to the right guy.” He held it up in the light acting like he knew what to look for to determine its value.  “They could have sold it and fixed up those bummy ass houses themselves, But I think I'll try my luck at a pawn shop instead. I’d even share some of the money with you if it’s a lot.”



“No, Rick, we really should take it back once the weather clears up. We don’t even have to get that close; we can toss it into the sand and paddle off.” I hated how I sounded like our moms, but they were usually right in the end. Rick scowled and bent his brow so hard I had thought he might punch me. He didn't, but he shoved me aside and stashed the white bread into his pocket and walked back to the house.



The rest of the week went normally, We didn’t mention our trip to the island or the robed men or the pearl. I was nice to Rick, I even noticed him holding the thing by himself, and fingering it around in his hand. I had thought he was thinking of returning it, expecting him to ask to help bring it back any day. My prayers must have had an adverse effect because when the week of our vacation ended, he still seemed to have it. He would wear a nervous, almost paranoid expression in the last couple days. I would ask him about it but he scoffed and would say I was being a prick and to mind my own business.  When we were all packed up to leave Rick was there to say goodbye, I gave him a hug and quietly I said,



“You better have given that back by the time I’m up here again next year. If I found out, you sold it I swear I’ll find that cash and take it to them myself.”



“Hmph” he pushed me off and mumbled, “get off of me”. I was sad to see him like this, but I told myself he was being selfish and ignorant, and that next year I would straighten it up with him. I had thought that maybe some time away would help him realize how wrong he was, and that he would be more open to the idea after some distance.



My mind was swimming, and I decided to do a little research into any religious groups in the area or what the pearl might have been, but I found nothing. I tried prying Rick a little bit once I got home, but he ghosted all my texts. He must have been really pissed that I tried lecturing him, but I thought that I should give him some space and pester him about it later when he stopped being so standoffish. I would have never expected that less than three weeks later, Rick would go missing.
