Something tried to get me to let it in our cabin, and it wasn't my grandfather.

A true story.

It was august, that's all I remember about the day it happened. I was around fifteen, staying at the hunting camp deep in northern ontario with my uncle, brother, grandfather and friend. My brother, was around ten at the time, my friend Tom fifteen as well. 

Now this hunting camp is more in the middle of nowhere than my grandfathers house. Im talking no people for miles, no mcdonalds for hours. It was fun to be there, running wild all summer, but at the same time it held this creepy aspect to it.

Now we had gone fishing, just me, Grayson (my brother) and Tom, and were driving down the muddy path back to the hunting camp on an ATV when the gas cut out, leaving us stuck in the mud without a jumper cable in sight. We argued about pushing the ATV the rest of the way home or not, but it was dark by now and my brother was getting scared, constantly flashing his flashlight into the woods in paranoia. 

We walked back to the cabin, all three of us aware my grandfather would be enraged that we were there without the ATV at nine pm, but then again, there was this eerie feeling creeping over me, like we were being followed. It was enough to make us rush back and enter the house, Tom and Grayson leaving me to tell my grandfather what had happened, both the boys heading to the mudroom to wait out his anger.

He begrudgingly grabbed his ring that held all the keys he had seemingly ever owned, my uncle standing and following him towards the door. The house was one room, the beds along the walls near the front door, the kitchen and dining table in the middle of the house before a wall separated that from the mudroom which led onto the porch. There were two screen doors on either side of the main part of the house that also opened onto the porch, and the porch wrapped around the entire house, all the way back to the front door.

My grandfather told me that he and my uncle were taking their ATV's to go get ours, and that we were to stay in the house with the doors locked, nobody was allowed outside this late as per usual in the woods where we were surrounded by bears and wolves, the usual natural dangers one would expect.

I was sort of pissed we couldn't go swimming, but then again, my brother was still skittishly looking around the house, out the windows, his flashlight in his hand. I didn't argue, and merely nodded, my grandfather and uncle leaving, locking the doors behind them. The doors didn't have locks that you could unlock from the inside, they only had keyholes, though the front door also had a padlock up the door, to high for my brother to reach. 

We sat in the mudroom for a while listening to the staticky radio before all three of us got hungry and decided to  make some mac and cheese. My brother was too young to mess around with the lighter you needed to start the stove, and if Tom made anything he'd surely light it on fire, so I was left to cook.

I had finished dinner, tossed the pot onto the table and grabbed our bowls when suddenly there was a knock on the front door. All three of us stopped moving, eyebrows furrowed to one another. I thought it may have been a branch, which was an idiotic thought, because it happened again, a heavy knocking, one two three, on the front door. 

"Whos there?" My brother mumbled, causing a shiver to run down my spine.

"Dunno, thought Jamie and Gramp went to get the ATV?" Tom replied as he stood, taking a few steps towards the front door before I stopped him with a shake of my head. 

"Let me go look," I replied.

I left Tom standing in the middle of the room, my brother at the table, as I walked to the front door, holding the doorknob for a second. I wiggled the doorknob and it was still locked. The knocking had stopped, so I turned and shrugged to Tom, taking a step back towards the others assuming it had been the wind.

"Its me, let me in." My grandfather called from the other side of the door. 

I froze, along with my brother and Tom, the three of us stood in confusion. 'what the fuck' I mouthed to Tom, not a word, not another knock, eerie silence while my brother and Tom stood still as statues.

"I need the key to the truck, let me in." He began once more, his voice the same, however the same snappy attitude he would have had with me was gone from his voice, his tone almost too happy for the grumpy old man my grandfather was.

Me and Tom locked eyes and we knew at once this wasn't right. The key to the truck was on the ring with the keys to the house and the keys to the ATV, the one my grandfather never let out of his sight. He had left with it, he wouldn't bother knocking before unlocking the door to his cabin, and he overall wouldn't need to whatsoever. He had the keys to the truck, and the keys to the house.

There were no windows that could see the front door, other than the one in the attic but even that one barely gave you a view. My brother had stood and ran over to Tom, and was now hiding behind him as I slowly backed away from the front door and grabbed the nearest weapon in the house, which due to the nature of where we were, was my uncles hunting rifle.

"Pete, what are you doing?" Tom mumbled, but I shushed him, pointing to the mudroom where my brother quickly ran, Tom and I standing in the middle of the room, the silence still surrounding us before it started again.

The heavy knocking, followed by my grandfather once more.  
"Cmon kid let me in." He began again, louder this time.

Tom and I slid open the side door to the porch which my grandfather had not locked. It was pitch black by now, and before Tom could even say a word he gasped and pointed shakily towards the water. The lake that the cabin was on was directly in between the car park where our truck was, and the cabin; so the trail we took to go fishing and the trail the broken down ATV was on wrapped around the edge of the lake. I was stunned slightly to see the lights of my uncles and my grandfathers ATV's on the trail where we had left our ATV, the both of them visible even in the dark. 

"What the fuck" Tom mumbled but I shushed him again, turning around and grabbing the metal stick we had for the fireplace, handing it to Tom.

"Whats this for?" He asked.

I watched nervously as Tom crept towards the front of the house on the porch. the knocking was still loud and continuous, my brother was silently sobbing in the background and I could see Tom shaking as he peeked around the corner of the house, the door in full sight for him now.

He turned around with furrowed eyebrows and shrugged.

"There's nobody there" He called to me.

"Boys this isn't funny let me in." My Grandfather snapped.

We sat in the attic the rest of the night listening to the knocking, me, my brother and Tom all shaking in unison.

We heard the ATV's rolling into the driveway and watched out the small window as my uncle and my grandfather...my real grandfather, walked up to the house, my grandfather unlocking the door and stepping inside with a yelp for us to come downstairs.

We never told him what happened, well aware we'd all sound crazy.

Sometimes still when we're out in the woods and its getting dark, I swear I can hear my grandfather calling for us deep in the woods.

As of recently however, the voice has changed.

I'm not sure if its really my own voice calling me into the woods, but I know for damn sure I'm not going out alone ever again.
