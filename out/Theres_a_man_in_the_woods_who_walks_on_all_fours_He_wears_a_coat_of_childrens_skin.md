The Brittle Man. 

That’s the name the children gave him, back before they became bloodstains. 

He lives in the woods, walks on all fours and wears a coat of skin. He hides in the trees, they say. Way, way up so you can’t see him while you meander the trails, while you soak in the scant rays of sunshine peeking through the suffocating leaves of the Crooked Wood. 

I asked a girl when he comes down to feed, this Brittle Man, and she told me it’s only when the moon is full, when it throbs and shudders like a spider sack fit to burst. That’s when. And you’ll know it because of the way his long, yellowed nails click-clack along the bark, the way he heaves and gasps like a butchered sow. 

He never speaks. Doesn’t have to. He communicates through his victims, through their screams and the red stains they leave upon the stones and sticks. That’s what they tell me, the children do. 

Rest their hearts. 

I never went looking for them in my search for the Brittle Man. They found me. They were waiting at the edge of the wood when I arrived, waving to me in the dying light of the sun. 

‘You’ve seen him too, haven’t you?’ they asked me. 

And I nodded. 

It was a long time ago, back when I was probably not much older than them. I’d been wandering the forest with Charlie. My very best friend. It was the same forest that we’d stumbled through all nine years of our lives—or so we had thought. 

But as we walked along familiar trails, they began to twist. 

Mutate. 

The forest seemed to bend, expand, almost as if it were breathing. A living organism that had swallowed us whole. Night fell. Darkness poured in. We tried to retrace our path, Charlie and I, to escape that prison of trees but all paths lead to nowhere. 

We’d be caught. Ensnared. 

That was the first time I heard the click-clack of those fingernails, crawling down the bark. It was the first time I heard the aching whimper that would haunt my dreams for the rest of my life. 

‘Did he get one of your friends too?’ I asked the children. 

‘Yes,’ they told me. ‘Lots.’

My heart ached. ‘How many?’ 

‘Too many.’

They turned then, the boy and the girl, and led me into the suffocating shadow of trees. 

‘Do you know who you are?’ they asked.

It seemed a strange question. Of course I knew who I was. I was me. 

‘Why did you come back?’ they asked. ‘You escaped all those years ago. Now you’re back. How come?’

My lips tasted the coldness of carbon. ‘I didn’t have a choice,’ I answered quietly. ‘I woke up one day up with my gun in my mouth, my finger tapping against the trigger, my body daring my mind to give the order. To put me out of my misery. Then it happened again. And again.’

I adjusted the rifle slung across my back, the weight feeling titanic. The children didn’t need to know about the ocean of beer cans I waded through to get to bed, or the way I’d drink myself unconscious just to rest my bloodshot eyes. 

The truth was simple enough. 

If I didn’t kill the Brittle Man, I told them, then I’d kill me. 

‘Oof,’ the boy said. ‘Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.’

‘Yes,’ I told him. ‘Let’s hope.’

The children led me down a winding trail, one where the branches reached out like hungry claws, scraping at my plaid shirt, my torn jeans. 

The further we went the darker it became, until the sunlight become little more than a memory, all but drowned by the gloom-soaked shade. We passed teeth dangling from thread. They rattled, clattering against one another like make-shift alarms heralding our arrival. 

‘It’ll be night soon,’ whispered the girl, her voice sharp with unease. ‘The Brittle Man will be awake soon. Are you sure you’re ready?’

I felt the rifle across my back, finding security in the same barrel I’d nearly swallowed just days prior. ‘I’m ready. In fact, I hope we cross paths. I’d like to give him something for the nightmare he put me through.’

The boy laughed. ‘You can’t kill him. Not with that.’

I shot him a cold look. ‘Then how do I kill the bastard?’

‘There’s a way,’ he said, a playful grin flickering on his lips. ‘Just follow us and we’ll show you.’

So I followed them. 

With every step we took, the forest seemed to compress, to shrink, its branches reaching closer and closer as if they’d like nothing more than to strangle the light from our eyes. 

‘Do you see that?’ I asked, squinting ahead. 

A shadow hung from the bough of a tree, swaying in the humid breeze. 

‘Don’t—’ said the girl, but it was too late. My feet were already marching forward, faster and faster as my breath became panicked gasps. I lifted my flashlight, and my stomach twisted with nausea. 

It was a body. 

A child’s, hanging dead from a noose. 

No.

I forced myself closer, ignoring the cries of the girl, and the giggles from the boy. My heart ricocheted against my ribs, a single though spiraling around my mind. 

*Don’t be Charlie. Please don’t be Charlie.* 

Yet the closer I got, the more my heart sank. The child looked familiar. He was a boy. Red shoes. Blue jumper. Oh God, Charlie had a sweater just like that, didn’t he? 

My breath caught as I came right up to him, my legs giving out. The moonlight, it’d caught the boy’s face—or what should have been. It’d been removed. His face. His old head. In its place was…

‘It’s a teddy bear,’ I sputtered, horror lacing my every word. ‘They’ve sewn a teddy bear’s head onto his neck…’

Tears muddied my vision. It hardly seemed real that somebody, or something, could be so vile, so twisted that they’d desecrate a child’s body this way. 

‘He does this to all the children,’ the boy told me matter-of-factly, gazing up at the corpse with unnerving indifference. ‘The Brittle Man carves off their heads then flays their faces. Stitches them into his coat of skin. Sews their favorite stuffy onto their necks.’

I doubled over, retching into the grass. 

I’d never seen anything so horrible, but I reminded myself I wasn’t the victim here. Charlie was. He deserved to be seen, for his pain to be understood, and so I forced myself to look up at my old friend, at what this monster had made him into. 

But something was off. 

Charlie’s jumper wasn’t blue, was it? It was white. And he’d never had a teddy bear. He’d had that stuffed animal his mother sewed for him… 

I frowned, brows furrowed as I wracked my memory. My head felt hazy in this wood. It was as if my past were buried beneath some bleak shadow, too heavy to lift, but I clenched my eyes shut and focused. 

‘It was a rabbit,’ I said slowly, the memory emerging from the fog. ‘That’s what Charlie had—his favorite stuffed animal. It wasn’t a teddy bear. It was a rabbit his mother made for him.’

The girl nodded, staring at the dead child with near clinical curiosity. ‘So then this couldn’t be him,’ she said. 

The boy gave the hanging child’s leg a push, laughing as it swayed like a pendulum. ‘What a relief! Guess we can get moving again.’

He bounded off, the boy, leaving the girl and I to walk beneath the eclipse of the trees. She seemed much more serious than the boy. ‘The Brittle Man,’ I asked her. ‘Why does he do this?’

Her fingers fretted at the hem of her dress, almost like she were deep in thought. Then she said, ‘To seal their souls inside them. Otherwise they’d leak out through their eyes, wouldn’t they?’

I didn’t know. 

I didn’t know anything anymore. 

We ventured deeper into that labyrinth of branch and vine, and the further we went, the more my chest tightened with dread. It was a feeling that took me back to that day, all those years ago. The day I lost Charlie. The day we met—

*Click-clack.*

I jerked to a stop, ears twitching. The sound. I’d heard it from somewhere up above, a soft clack like fingernails crawling over bark, and laboured breathing, like a sow being butchered slow. 

I reached for my rifle, but the girl’s arm snapped out, stopping me. She shook her head. 

‘Pretend he isn’t there,’ she whispered. 

‘But—’

‘Bullets won’t kill him. They’ll only make him angrier.’

***Click-clack.***

***Click-clack.***

I tensed, fear slithering into my veins. It was getting closer. *He* was getting closer. A putrid stench wrinkled my nostrils, something like rotting skin. The Brittle Man was close enough that I could smell him now, and the fingernails were beginning to dance faster and faster.

‘Psst!’

I squinted through the gloom. 

The boy’s silhouette knelt ahead of us, crouched by the gaping hollow of a tree. He waved. ‘In here you two. The creepy old monster won’t fit.’

I gazed at the hollow, my stomach knotting with primal terror. It didn’t look like a hole in a tree. It looked like a mouth, gnarled and hungry, just waiting for the next meal to stumble through its jaws. 

***cLICK-cLACK***

***CliCK-cLACK***

No time. 

The Brittle Man was here, and that left me with a choice between dying for sure, or dying perhaps. I ducked down. My palms ached against the stone and sticks, my jeans earning another tear as I forced myself through the jagged jaws of the trunk.

And then the ground vanished beneath me. 

I fell, screaming, down the throat of the tree, swallowed up by the Crooked Wood.
