I am a 24 year old, 6’2 280 pound man. I have been skin bald since I was 16, I have tattoos covering a majority of my arms and chest and I look fresh out of a fantasy game. What most people don’t know about me is my condition, alexithymia. It is a medically diagnosed mental disorder. In short I cannot feel emotion, I have never felt happy, sad, angry etc;

my mother died when i was 17, The day of her funeral I took some rubbing alcohol and dripped it into my eye to create the illusion of crying. When in reality all I could think about was how my siblings were feeling. My older sister was destroyed, She weeped for days and I swear I noticed my razors going missing. 

Regardless of all of the events that have happened, Not a single thing was felt. that was until today. 

June 18th, 2024. 

I was in my kitchen on the phone to my employer, They were discussing a position movement, I was a security officer, The only profession someone of my stature could fit. In reality I always wanted to be a nurse. Anyways, As we were discussing work related things I heard an odd noise generate out of the back patio. I told my employer to stay on the call for a moment while I go check.

As I walked out the kitchen and to my backdoor the most unexplainable feeling washed over me. The feeling that I was being hunted, Obviously I brushed it off. I was safe at home with my 2 dogs. Then it came to me, They weren’t at the door, My 2 dogs bernie and sandy are the most protective pair of pure bred german shepherds you will ever meet. The sound of birds chirping have them on guard for fucksake.

As that detail sunk in I sensed something out of my vision. It was my laundry door opening. I watched as a familiar pair of black wide eyes emerged out of the shadows, It was Bernie.

I walked over as I began to pet him, I forced myself to smile to feel normal. My lips quivered as I forced a grin.

However I began to wonder where sandy was. He never goes anywhere without Bernie. They are simply put inseparable.

I walked back to the door as I looked out the peephole. The dark yard glistened as the night dew refracted against my porch light. Sandy was nowhere in sight. I sighed as I walked to my front door. I flicked on my front porch light expecting to see sandy. He must have snuck out the doggy door right? 

I looked out the porch and I did see sandy, Except he was up in one of the many tall trees situated outside. He sat there standing like some glitch. Thats the best way to put it, A glitch, He just stood there staring off in the distance at something. Then I noticed something, he was perfectly still, His fur was not moving, It was as if he was frozen in time. I opened the door immediately getting ready to grab sandy when one final detail caught my attention. Every other tree in my front yard, They had life to them, Like the leaves actually rustled in the wind, The branches swivelled and such. The tree sandy was situated on was as still as the concrete sidewalk it bordered.

I did not know what to think. Every primal urge in me was screaming to shut that door and call the police. But what would I tell them? I sucked in my gut and Walked over. 

Sandy’s first movement was turning his head to face me. I stared at him, something about his face wasn’t right. I crept closer analysing his face. It all clicked at once, His face was too human, He lacked the emotion a friendly dog would, He didn’t show anything, Stone cold.

I backed up as I watched sandy elongate his mouth as if to speak like a human.

“Smile for the camera baby.” My mother’s voice echoed back at me. I stood there numb. My body grew cold as I stared at this thing. This was simply not possible, I was just hearing things? The wind was whistling weird of course It had to be. There is just no way that could be-

“I said.. Smile for the camera you fucking idiot.” 

It all hit me at once. I was emotionless but another mans mother dying would bring even the medically incapable out right? I hated my mother. she deserved death long before it took her. 

I felt fear then. Not for the horror that stood before me, Not for the impossible that had just presented itself, But for the fact that something else knew my secret.

I was capable of showing emotion if I tried. I never did though, And it was my mother’s fault. She dare bring me down for something I can’t change? She made me never want to change. The things she said and did to me made me reach the idea that never feeling emotion would be my saviour. After all, The things I went through? No man with emotion could hold himself to.

So as the realisation set in I stared at sandy. and for the first time in my life I smiled.

“What are you?”

I asked softly.

“Fear” The thing remarked. It’s voice still identical to my mother’s.

“Why are you here?” I remarked.

“To show you that, Regardless for what you cannot feel, I am real. No matter what.” 

I was confused now, an emotion never felt. “What do you mean.”

The thing now jumped down from the tree as he approached me.

I backed up now.

“See? your brain does not fear me, But your body does. No matter what power you possess in your mind, Your body cannot resist. What are you without your body?”

I thought now genuinely perplexed. My knees began shaking, my brain numb. 

“Now. Smile for the camera.”

I forced myself to smile at this thing as it seemed to be satisfied. “Good.” 

My mother’s voice droned my mind as this thing stared.

“See. Your mind does not fear me, Your body does.”

I began to back up more now on my porch steps.

“Run away for you are scared.” I backed up into my house slamming my door shut.

It’s been 4 hours since. I keep hearing a subtle “Smile for the camera.”

My body is shivering in fear. I have never felt this before. My mind grows numb with every remark from this thing who calls itself fear.

It keeps saying:

“you are nothing without the body you occupy, your brain feels the emotions your body may express. So what are you without a body?”
