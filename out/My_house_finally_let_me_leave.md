The scratching in the hallway slowed as Jasper brought the candlestick down toward my head, almost like the thing outside was waiting to see who came out on top. Watching for the loser who would be devoured by the cosmos.

“I’m sorry, brother.” Jasper said again with tears in his eyes. I had brought my arms up to guard my head, and felt the bone of my forearm crack as he made contact with the heavy metal of the candlestick. I howled in pain and fell backwards toward the double doors.

“Jesus, man! You don’t have to do this! There’s got to be some other way out of here!” I screamed at him. “Don’t let that damned thing get me. Please.”

I was pleading now. My heart beating out of my chest and into my throat as he moved toward me again, lifting the make shift weapon. The scratching of the Gatekeeper outside moved ever closer. It had to be right outside the door now.

I ran to the corner opposite Jasper, holding my fractured arm close to me. Every movement was pain and I had lost most of the feeling to my right hand. Jasper kept moving forward, holding his candelabra further up as he prepared to end me. The light from some of the still flickering candles on the altar was shining in his eyes, making huge emeralds of fear that were staring into my soul. I don’t know what came over me, but I decided to just go with my gut. I dashed behind him, running right into the altar and knocking it to the ground. Candles caught the carpet on fire immediately, moving up cheap paneling on the walls. If this part of the house was older, there was probably a shit ton of asbestos in here that would catch immediately. I had to make my move while Jasper was caught off guard, shielding himself from the encroaching flames.

“Come on, man. Just let me get out of here. I’ve done my time.” Jasper was saying as he came closer, hefting the candelabra at me again. “God, they’ve probably been looking for me for years, haven’t they? There are people out there I need to get back to!”

The fire was licking further now as I picked myself back up, running toward the twin doors again. This time they gave, bursting inward back to the living room as I fell into the couch face first. The Gatekeeper burst through the other door into the altar room, probably sensing that one of its meals was getting away. Jasper came running out at me, falling over the other side of the couch as I rolled to the side to avoid him. Flames were growing from the other room, overtaking the doorway and entering into the living room. I could see the Gatekeeper clearly through the fire, sucking in everything around it to the singularity inside. Flames were spiraling in only to be3 extinguished by the void of space, with no hint they were ever there.

I tried getting up, hoping I could run through the front door and at least get away from the madness burning through everything right now. I ran, hitting the door hard and bouncing back as it didn’t give, even as I desperately pulled the doorknob. I kept shaking it, looking right through to the window outside. Jasper was coming up behind me, too late to do anything but turn as he grabbed onto me, using his weight and mine to throw me backwards toward the burning doorway, right into the arms of the Gatekeeper. 

As I fell into the void, I could see the door I had been desperately trying to get through fly open, the light of billions of burning suns coming through and evaporating him instantly like a nuclear bomb going off. Heat hit me briefly before I was absorbed into the cold feeling of the void. The Gatekeeper’s many arms pulled me in, like a greedy child taking every bit of food around. There, floating in front of me as the rest of my body passed through, was a small hole like a window showing my home from the inside. I felt my breath sucked out of me, the feeling of no gravity making me nauseous. I swear I thought this was the end for me. There’s no way to come back, and as a sudden, magnetic presence took hold, I was hurled backwards from the portal, through the edge of the event horizon. 

I don’t know how to describe what I saw, to be honest. It was… beautiful? In a way, but also one of the most horrifying things I’ve ever seen. As I slipped through the singularity I could see the entire universe laid out before me, stretching for endless eons through galaxies and star systems. Slowly, slowly I was pulled backwards for what felt like an eternity, the cosmos beyond began to take shape. 

Each one was its own body, floating freely as the central star of their system. Vaguely humanoid, but incomprehensible in the sheer size of it. One of them had the pillars of god, something I recognized from an old NASA photo, and was still huge in comparison. Each one was eviscerated though, insides trailing out to the boundaries of their universe, creating stars from drops of blood and planets from loose bones. Dead gods, doomed to rest in eternity as their corpses were scavenged. They stretched out further than I could see, but near the end I swear I saw something else, like A supernova slowly expanding, taking the stars piece by piece as it made its way closer. I tried screaming, sound lost to the cold darkness of space around me. I was getting lightheaded now, lack of oxygen finally catching up to me. It wouldn’t be long before I was dead and gone, floating in space for nobody to ever find.

I suddenly felt a hand grab me again, pulling me with a rough yank around the middle. The cold void was suddenly very hot, my eyes stinging and vision obscured as smoke filled my lungs.

They threw me outside on a gurney before I could tell what was happening. Coughing my damn lungs out, I finally got enough actual air into my eyes to see through the stinging tears. My house was in flames, a pyre burning into the night as an EMT started looking me over.

“You alright in there, buddy?” She said, shining a flashlight into my eyes one by one. “Can you tell me your name?” 

I babbled it out, still not sure if I was dead or hallucinating the entire fucking thing. She asked me what year it was next, then her eyes grew wide in concern at my answer.

“2020.” I said, looking at her and coughing again. She signaled to the other EMT outside, who came over and learned in toward her.

After a brief whisper back and forth I couldn’t hear, he asked me now, concern in his eyes. “Do you know where you are?”

“That’s my fucking house.” I coughed, 

“Okay. Call ahead to the ER, let them know we’re going to need some brain scans. Might be a concussion.” He said to the woman, moving back over to one of the firefighters, now helping the others to put the pyre out. I passed out there, exhausted from everything that was happening.

It wasn’t until later that I woke up in the hospital, IVs in my arm and an oxygen mask on. A doctor came in after a few hours, telling me that my scans didn’t show any kind of brain injury. He asked me again what year it was, then took a seat when I gave him the same answer.

“It’s 2024, son.” He said, a grave look in his eye, “Did something happen to you? We’re you left in that house by someone?”

Needless to say I’ve been pretty fucked up for the past few days. Four years passed since I first tried to leave the house, though it only felt like a couple of days for me. While I was in there… well, I came back to find out my mom passed. I’ve been trying to come to terms with everything, catching up on what’s happened and the things I’ve missed. My brother was happy to see me, at least, and tried his best to tell me what happened after I apparently went missing.

The house is gone, good fucking riddance there. Even in all the rush of getting back here, I still can’t fathom why the Gatekeeper let me live while burning Jasper to atoms. Maybe it was some fucked up sense of karmic justice since he was willing to sacrifice me. Maybe the cosmos don’t have any reasoning. Either way… I don’t feel like I’ve aged four years, and my brother tells me I look exactly the same. Stress from me missing has made him look like the older one now. 

Oh, I looked up records about Jasper. At least, what little I could find. I’m guessing he didn’t have many people around, because there was only one mention of him in an article about some mob guys dying, saying they were a suspect in his disappearance. Hell, even if I tried to come forward with info about him, it’s not like anyone would believe [me](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/dXCiXSkGCe).
