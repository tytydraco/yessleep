Moved in to my new apartment about 3 weeks ago. I’m almost positive it’s haunted. The first night here, I had an insane nightmare. First part of the dream showed me all the people that has lived here, some very old and a couple who seemed upset to move out so quick, then it transitioned to the kitchen, which had a basket full of chips and candy with a welcome note. Ignored it, I just moved in that day anyways and had a stressful day.

Last week, I got home and there was a package out my door, was under someone else’s name and had their number. Texted the person saying hey your package was sent here, you can get it if you’d like. She thanked me then told me “Just a warning the dishwasher in the kitchen is haunted, we named him David, he’s really friendly just takes a while to warm up to people”. Whatever. I told her thanks for letting me know (thought it was an asshole move telling me at 8pm) 

Next day I asked management if they knew any history of my place being haunted they said nope, and she actually had issues with management before she left, didn’t leave on good terms. She was weird enough to come back even after she moved out because she just wanted to see the place one last time. So felt theres a 80 percent chances the girl was lying out of spite to scare me and make the apartment look bad. 

I’ve been having such an eery feeling in my apartment. Woke up to my microwave flashing, my sink keeps making sounds in the middle of the night. Last night, had another vivid nightmare, i remember every damn detail, it was of me being in a house where I couldn’t sleep, some stuff fell off a second bed that was next to mine, ran to some person outside saying I can’t stay here, the person in the dream was convincing me it’s okay and tried walking me back to the bed where I saw the blanket being pulled off. Then transitioned to some random guy fucking me in that house, I dashed out, saw other random people and them being scared, kid toys turning on and going towards me. It was legit the most scariest dream I had.


 This morning I saged my whole place and blasted church music even though I’m not religious, because I know evil whatever beings can’t stand hearing that. Felt fine throughout the day, felt eery again tonight, so I shut off all the lights closed my damn door and just went to bed, the moment I get on my phone got a notification my internet modem has been disconnected. No freaking way was I going to go in my living room and see what happened. Internet went back on after 5 min. FUCK all of this. Not trying to give it no mind. Would appreciate any input to put an end to this pathetic thing lingering here. For context, I never experienced anything paranormal in my life. Thanks in advance.
