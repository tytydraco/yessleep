A few months back, I was looking for a room for rent. When I came across this mansion for six hundred a month. I toured the house and it all seemed legitimate. 

I met the home owner who stayed across the hall from me on the second floor. A charming gentleman who went by Anthony. He'd inherited the home from his parents. He told me how grateful he was to have me. 

During the first week, I saw little of him and the house was quiet. Each morning, I would take a stroll on the beach. The sunrise was incredible and the warm sand enveloped my toes. 

The second week came around, and I noticed strange folk in robes entering the house at night. I made no remark about it. They seemed to be friends with the homeowner. 

One night I heard a loud shriek. I remained frozen in  my bed. I didn’t know whether to get up and investigate or to stay put.

 I mustered the courage to go investigate.

A light was on in one of the rooms and the door was closed. I heard another bloodcurdling shriek. I decided to stay put outside and dialed 9-1-1. 

Anthony opened the door. What I saw could only only be seen in movies. A large altar, hooded figures, and a salt circle around them. 

“You’re just in time.” He said, wide eyed. 

“I-I was just-” 

“Staying. You were just staying.” 

He snapped his fingers and signaled the hooded group. They marched out in unison, grabbing my arms. I resisted with all my might. While thumbing my cell phone in an attempt to call the police.

“Stop! Let me go!” 

“We’ve been expecting you. Don’t you *realize*? You're about to die for something great.” 

I managed to break free from one and socked the other in the mouth. His hood fell back, only to reveal what seemed inhuman. A bald man with broken pointy teeth hissed at me. His cranium was larger than the average. Outstretched and tattooed with occult symbols. 

I ran outside in my pajamas, though I didn’t bring my car keys. I yanked a couple times at the door, but it was locked. So I began pounding on the neighbor’s door. No one answered. 

An cold hand covered my mouth from behind. They brought me back inside. I was tied to a chair in the living room. Surrounded by hooded figures.

“Let’s figure this out,” Anthony said while scrolling through my cell phone. 

“You’re insane!”

“Your ignorance is amusing.” 

“Let me go!”

“You could stay… Join us and…”

“And what?!” 

“We’ll need an offering. Call someone you’re not close to.”

“Never.” 

“It’s you or them. Good and evil don’t exist in this house. Survival is yours.”

What choice did I have? I made the call. Now I’m stuck here. An “active” member of a cult. Little do they know, I’m planning something massive. A way to break free and achieve justice. For now, I'm play the part they want of me. I mutter incantations when told, fast when I’m supposed to, and study demonology. My room is guarded, but I'm working to earn their trust. 

If you ever come across a deal that’s too good to be true. Get out while you still can.
