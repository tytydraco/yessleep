Hello, people of Reddit. I’m here to share my experience with the paranormal. To give you some context, I was 16 when this happened, and I wasn’t really into paranormal stuff. I mean, I’d play horror games sometimes with my friends who enjoyed that kind of thing, and I liked them too, but I wasn’t the type to point at random things and say, “It’s a ghost” or whatever.

Anyway, it was a pretty normal night. I was playing Minecraft with my friends, Bedwars to be specific. We were just having a good time while my parents were asleep. Around 1 AM, I logged off and got ready for bed. But for some reason, I just didn’t feel like sleeping. I had this weird feeling that something was off. Like, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was going to happen, something I wasn’t supposed to miss.

I ended up lying in bed for a couple of hours, just tossing and turning. It was around 2:30 or 3 AM when I first heard it, footsteps. They were coming from outside my bedroom window, and they sounded really close. A sense of dread hit me immediately, and I started thinking about who or what it could be. It couldn’t have been a dog, it was way too late for that, especially in my neighborhood.

Part of me didn’t want to look, but curiosity got the better of me. I moved the curtain a bit to see what was out there, and I immediately regretted it. What I saw chilled me to my core. Standing behind the tree right outside my window was a dark, tall, and skinny figure. It was staring right at me, and what made it even worse was that it didn’t have a clear outline. There was nothing to distinguish it from the night around it, like it was blending into the shadows.

Its entire body seemed to be surrounded by some kind of smoke or mist that constantly shifted, almost like it was moving. I couldn’t tell if it was the figure itself or something around it, but the sight of it made my stomach drop. It felt like it was trying to lure me outside, almost daring me to come closer. I froze. We locked eyes for a few seconds, and then I quickly closed the curtain. My heart was racing. I didn’t know what to do, so I just lay back down, trying to process what I’d just seen. I prayed that whatever it was wouldn’t come any closer.

The footsteps continued for what felt like an hour, but eventually, everything went quiet. I didn’t tell my parents or my brother. I didn’t tell anyone for months, honestly. It wasn’t until I was hanging out with my friends, and we started sharing creepy stories, that I finally told them what happened. That’s when one of them told me they’d heard footsteps outside my window too, back when we had a sleepover at my place. That freaked me out even more.

Now, two years later, I still hear the footsteps from time to time. It’s not every night, but when I do, I don’t even think about looking outside again.
