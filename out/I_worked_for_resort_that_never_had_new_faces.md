I have quit the job awhile ago but I was working for a resort that has to remain unnamed. My job was crowd control. All I had to do was make sure people stayed in line and not crowd and block areas. It wasn’t to hard of a job most of time people listened when I broke crowds up. Their was a couple of groups that got mad at me for trying to move them out of the way. Because I am working I can’t get mad at them so I have to keep a good attitude. After awhile it usually died down. I always remember the faces of people like that so if I see them again I knew how to act. What concerned we me the most though was how often I’d see their faces again. Not within the same day but every time I went in. They were always there. I brushed it off for awhile. Who would keep going to the same resort though. I don’t work their so I can say the place was not that interesting. We mostly just had food places and a lazy river. There was not much.

The people never stopped coming I always saw them. I looked at other groups and engrained them in my head to see if I would see them again. I saw that group again. It worked for everyone I remembered. They kept coming back. Mind you we were in a large area there was a lot of things to do outside of the resort. But these people only enjoyed it here or something. I asked one of my coworkers why it was always the same people and all he said was “that’s the point isn’t it.” I assume he meant to make them enjoy their stay that they come back. I disregarded my concerns again. People enjoy different things I shouldn’t judge.

After about a month I started to see a different pattern. The people I saw started to gain some pounds on them. It was so gradual it was hard to notice but when I saw a group of workers walk past I saw the difference. The guests all had gain some 70 pounds. I felt a little bad, like we profiting of their bad habits. I got paid pretty good so I couldn’t quit then I wanted to pay my mortgage first at least. They kept gaining weight.

I felt disgusting, I’m having a part in this. It started to feel like I’m herding animals. Food was abundant and it was always free with the high admission. I had no problem with their size I had a problem with being the reason for it.

I talked to a few employees if they felt the same. They all said the same phase, “That’s the point isn’t it.” I was confused what it could mean in this context. I was told that the point is make sure everyone has a good time that they remember. I started smoking to ease my mind which never helped the stress. The people became slower and slower. My job got harder because of this but no complained to me. In fact they barely spoke. It all just sounded like grunts. Now they truly felt like animals being herded.

For a third time I asked with the same phase being ingrained in my skull this time. But they started to say something after, “it’s almost time, you ready.” For what? “The point of the resort, what do you mean?” I had no idea what this meant, until about a week. It was same job as always herd the people out of crowds but something changed. Across the loudspeaker a siren sound shrieked. My boss’s voice called over and told everyone to move to the back of the park. In the back their is the employee area which they weren’t allowed to go into usually but I was told to move them there. They all obliged with ease

After they crowded in the area I asked what was going on and my coworkers said, “the profit starts.” I was handed a gun and told I’ll get a cut in the profit. I stared at the gun. What was this place. The intercoms made the same screech and the boss yelled take aim. I never fired a bullet but just sat there complacent. This wasn’t a resort it was a farm. Trucks came in after a few minutes. I just stared at the bodies tears running down my cheeks. The people from the trucks came about with coolers and collected the parts.

These people did nothing and I had them farmed like animals. I am a monster. I just sat there and watched. I never went back into work but I the next day the resort was filled with new faces. I could say something but I know what they are willing to do.
