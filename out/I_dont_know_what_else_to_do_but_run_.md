*Solomon’s Spine. 65KM.* 

“Odd name for a trail,” I mentioned to no one in particular. The sign had a spray-painted penis obscuring the details of the map, the metal totem disappearing, a passing blur in my peripherals. It gave me a good hearty chuckle. A real gut-buster. Then it was back to the heartbeat in my temple, the *thump-thump-thump.* The damn stitch in my side just wouldn’t go away.

“Nice back you got there, Sol. Mighty sturdy. Nice and long.”

That’s how I remembered getting through all of the punishment. Long conversations. Distractions. The five AM wake-ups and four-hour trail runs for months. Protein shakes, chicken breasts, and rice. The hours of stretching that followed the Epsom salt baths, all of it seemingly prevented nothing. Bandaids covered up the blisters that oozed blood, pus, and putrid liquid from the raw flesh.

No pain, no gain, I guess.

Running ultras was some of the roughest, most insane shit you could willingly do to yourself. It did a number on your body, but most importantly, your mind. It took you places you didn't want to be. After a couple were under your belt, you began to truly understand suffering. There was no limit to what the body could take. 

And that feeling afterward was like nothing else–the rush that would spew out of you as you huddled on the floor, trying to contain your trembling, wobbly legs as you realized it was all over.

*You* did it. You made it through. 

“You can do it, Henry.” Debbie smiled. She looked rather radiant and hardly tired compared to the sweat buckets dripping down my dirt-soaked back. 

“Thanks, hun.” 

“Who comes up with these names, anyway?” Lilly asked. 

“No idea, Lills,” I replied, rubbing the top of her head to mess up her hair. She scrunched up her nose and squealed, “Stop! Stop!” before she sprinted a couple of yards away.

“Okay–come back now!” I chuckled. “You’re safe. I promise.”

“It’s a serious question,” my seven-year-old trooper continued. “I’m going to name one ‘Buckley’s Breath’ someday. You just watch.”

Our border-collie-terrier took off up trail before it suddenly darted into the forest. 

“Get back here, Bucko!” I hollered. The dog stopped. His guilty face poked through the branches before his ears perked up and he was gone again. We watched him scamper toward a squirrel in a tree, his collar jingling. His barks echoed through the forest in sharp little bursts.

The trees seemed to crowd together in a wave of outstretched limbs. I focused on what I could–the crunching of my steps in the dirt, the warbler’s chirps, the series of rustling in the undergrowth. I tried to steady my gaze on the trail, but I failed.

I couldn’t ignore the eyes. 

Where the shadows loomed and my eyesight could just barely reach, there were walls of them. Blinking. I’d squint and narrow my focus, and then they would disappear, like a camouflaged moth resting against a tree trunk. Still. 

*Don’t stop, Henry,* I told myself. *Keep going.*

“Daddy, what’s the fastest you can run?” Lilly’s adorable voice spoke, graciously snapping me out of my panic. 

“Oh, I don’t know. Just a little over a gazillion kilometers an hour. ”

“Nuh-uh” 

“You wanna see?” Before she could respond, I swung my arms and pumped my legs. A chorus of her giggles trailed behind me. I could hear their galloping footsteps approach, followed by a burst of Debbie’s infectious laughter.

*Come on, Henry. Push through.*

My breaths had fallen shallow. My head spun in a delirious swirl of exhaustion and sickness. Every bit of me screamed for it all to end. Enough already. I’m done. What I would have given to kick back in my La-Z-Boy and just watch the game.

After a long stretch, the feelings went away though. It all passes. It always does. 

The sun was beginning to dip below the horizon. You could hear the grasshoppers begin to chirp. 

I spotted movement up ahead.

It was a raspy, low cry. 

Adrenaline propelled me forward; the trail suddenly vanished. Branches stung my arms and legs, clinging to my flesh as trickles of blood were left in their wake. My feet pummelled the marshy floor. He was so close I could see his number now. Twenty-four. My daughter’s birthdate. Always been my lucky number. 

I could hear him panting in anguish, his breaths ragged and lined with whimpers. The man hobbled onward, but there was little urgency in his steps. He was defeated.

I pushed him to the ground. Stripped him of his ratty shoes and forced them over the bloodied soles of my feet. The man had little else left to give. His body was battered and badly beaten, the wounds etched into his stomach and back still fresh. 

Two-four. 

He cried and begged, and finally, I took a stone and cracked him upon his skull. He dropped like a log, the blood flowing out of him like a faucet. It leaked to my hands in a dripping mess. I wiped it away, streaks of maroon like wet paint across my jagged rib cage.

The eyes got closer and I fled. I couldn’t look back to see the aftermath. But against my instinct, I peeked. The eyes narrowed upon me. And I ran. Ran like madness, the talons of fear gripping my chest in a suffocating vice grip. 

“W-what was that trail sign, again?” I stammered, to no one in particular. “Harold’s Elbow, was it? Or was that last time?”

Debbie's voice trickled in through the trees:

“Keep going, Henry.” 

And then a cackle, of all things, burst from my stomach and out my throat. It was that maniacal sense of escape. That rush. That feeling. The bloody thing that kept me going for so long with no sleep. 

Eventually, there will be no one else left, right? A finish line of sorts. Eventually, there would be an end to the forest and I’d stumble upon some logging road or something. 

“Right, Debbie? Right?”

There was a rustling from the forest, the frantic pounding of my heartbeat. 

And those eyes.
