My name’s Cameron. At the time of this story, I had just finalized my divorce from my husband and felt free for the first time in seven years. It was a mutual divorce. We both felt like it just wasn’t meant to be. To help me unwind, my friends planned to take me on a weekend camping trip in the forest—a chance to clear our minds and reconnect with nature. But little did we know, we were about to experience the most terrifying ordeal of our lives.

It was early autumn, and the leaves had just started to turn. The air was crisp and cool as we packed up our gear and set off into the forest. There were four of us: me, my best friend Mark, his girlfriend Emily, and our mutual friend David. We had chosen a remote spot, far from any established trails, to truly get away from it all.

The first day was perfect. We set up camp by a small, serene lake, cooked dinner over an open fire, and shared stories under the stars. As night fell, we huddled around the campfire, the only light in the vast darkness of the forest. The sounds of the night—crickets chirping, leaves rustling—were oddly soothing.

Around midnight, Emily pointed out a distant, faint glow through the trees. It looked like another campfire, but we hadn’t seen any other cars at the trailhead, and we hadn't encountered anyone else all day.

“Maybe it’s just someone passing through,” David suggested, though his voice lacked confidence.

We decided to brush it off, figuring it was nothing to worry about. But as we settled into our tents, I couldn't shake the uneasy feeling that we weren’t as alone as we thought.

The next day, we explored the forest, taking in the beauty of our surroundings. But that eerie feeling lingered. By the time we returned to camp, the sun was setting, casting long shadows through the trees. As we prepared dinner, Mark noticed something strange: footprints, not ours, leading into the woods and disappearing into the underbrush.

“Guys, these are fresh,” he said, his voice tinged with concern.

We exchanged nervous glances, trying to rationalize it. Maybe a hiker had wandered through while we were out. But deep down, we all felt the same gnawing fear.

That night, the forest seemed quieter, the darkness deeper. Around 2 a.m., I awoke to the sound of footsteps outside my tent. Slow, deliberate. My heart pounded as I strained to listen. The steps circled our camp, then stopped. I held my breath, waiting for what felt like an eternity, but heard nothing more.

In the morning, we found more footprints around our campsite. Whoever—or whatever—had been there was getting bolder. Emily was visibly shaken, and Mark tried to comfort her, but we all felt the growing tension.

“We should leave,” David said, breaking the silence. “This isn’t normal.”

We agreed to pack up and head back. As we gathered our things, the forest felt oppressively silent. Every rustle of leaves and snap of a twig set us on edge. The journey back seemed longer, the forest denser, as if it were closing in on us.

Halfway to the trailhead, we stumbled upon something that made our blood run cold—a crude, makeshift altar made of sticks and stones, with a freshly killed deer in the center. Blood dripped from its lifeless body, pooling on the ground.

“This is some Blair Witch shit.” Mark muttered, his face pale.

Panic set in. We picked up the pace, constantly looking over our shoulders. The sense of being watched was overwhelming, a suffocating presence that tightened with every step. As we neared the trailhead, the sky grew dark with storm clouds, and the first drops of rain began to fall, cold and relentless.

Suddenly, a blood-curdling scream pierced the air. It was Emily. She was at the back of the group, and in the chaos, she had fallen behind. We turned to see her struggling with a shadowy figure, barely visible in the dim light.

“Help me!” she screamed, her voice raw with terror.

Mark and David rushed back, shouting and waving their flashlights. The figure released Emily and vanished into the forest, melting into the darkness like smoke. Emily was shaken but unharmed, save for a few scratches and bruises.

“We need to get out of here, now!” Mark yelled, his voice edged with fear.

We didn’t stop running until we reached the car. However, to our horror, when we reached the car, we saw a message written in blood on the windshield: “This is just the beginning.”

Our breaths came in ragged gasps as we stared at the chilling message. Emily’s hands flew to her mouth, stifling a scream, while Mark and I exchanged terrified glances. The realization that we were being hunted sank in deeper.

“Get in the car, now!” Mark shouted, his voice trembling.

We scrambled inside, locking the doors behind us. The storm was raging outside, rain pelting the windows and thunder rumbling ominously. As Mark fumbled with the keys, I couldn’t tear my eyes away from the bloody words. The sense of being watched, of being prey, was suffocating.

Mark finally got the engine started, and we sped away from the campsite, the forest, a dark, impenetrable mass behind us. My heart pounded in my chest, a drumbeat of pure terror. We drove in silence; the only sounds were the relentless rain and the occasional sob from Emily.

That night, we drove to the nearest town and checked into a motel. We barely spoke, each of us lost in our own thoughts. The reality of what had happened was sinking in, and the fear was palpable, a silent companion that stayed with us through the night.

The next morning, we decided to head back to the city. As we packed up the car, we noticed David was missing. A cold wave of dread washed over us. We called out for him, our voices echoing in the still morning air, but there was no response. Panic set in as we searched the area, our calls growing more frantic.

“David!” Mark shouted, his voice cracking. “David, where are you?”

Emily’s eyes were wide with fear, tears streaming down her face. “He wouldn’t just leave,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “Something’s wrong. We need to find him.”

We split up, scouring the motel grounds and nearby streets, but there was no sign of him. The feeling of being watched returned, more intense than ever. It was as if the forest's sinister presence had followed us, refusing to let us go.

As we regrouped in front of our rooms, Emily’s scream pierced the air. We rushed to her, finding her standing in the doorway of David’s room, her face pale with horror. Inside, the scene was gruesome. David’s lifeless body lay on the bed, covered in blood. He had been brutally and savagely murdered, multiple stab wounds marking his chest and neck. His eyes were frozen in a final expression of terror, and his mouth was opened unnaturally wide, as if caught in a silent scream.

The horror of the scene was too much to bear. I staggered back, bile rising in my throat. Mark fell to his knees, in complete shock.

We called the police, and they arrived quickly. They questioned us, but it was clear they were skeptical of our story. There were no signs of forced entry, no footprints, no evidence of anyone else being in the room. It was as if David had been killed by an invisible force.

The officers exchanged glances, their expressions a mix of doubt and concern. “We’ll conduct a thorough investigation,” one of them assured us, though his tone lacked conviction.

We left the forest behind, but the terror followed us. Emily couldn’t stop crying, her sobs a constant reminder of our loss. Mark withdrew into himself, barely speaking, his eyes hollow and distant. And I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched, a prickling sensation that kept me glancing over my shoulder.

The trauma took its toll on all of us. Emily and Mark's relationship crumbled under the strain, and they eventually broke up. Not long after, Mark disappeared without a trace, adding another layer of dread to our already fractured lives.

Months passed, and we tried to move on with our lives. Both Emily and I began seeing a therapist and attending weekly support group meetings to deal with the trauma and survivor’s guilt. It admittedly helped us, but our fear never went away. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that shadowy figure in the woods, felt the weight of its gaze.

One night, after a particularly tough therapy session, I returned home to find something on my doorstep. It was a crudely carved wooden figure, identical to the ones we had seen at the makeshift altar in the woods. Attached was a note, scrawled in a shaky hand: “I’m still watching.”

My blood ran cold. The stalker had found me.

I called Emily immediately. She arrived within minutes, her face went pale. “We need to go to the police,” she said, her voice steady but filled with fear.

 “This can’t be happening,” I whispered, burying my face in my hands. “How did he find us?”

We gathered the note and the figure and headed to the police station. The officer on duty listened to our story, his expression skeptical but concerned. “We’ll look into it,” he promised, though his tone suggested he didn’t fully grasp the gravity of our situation.

Leaving the station, a sense of helplessness washed over me. “What if they can’t do anything?” I asked, my voice shaking. “What if this never stops?”

Emily put a reassuring hand on my shoulder. “We’ll find a way to protect ourselves,” she said, though her eyes betrayed her own fear. “We won’t let him control our lives.”

We installed security cameras around our homes and stayed in close contact, checking in on each other constantly. But the feeling of being watched never faded. Every creak of the floorboards, every rustle outside the window set our nerves on edge.

Weeks passed without incident and no word from the police, but the silence was unnerving, like the calm before a storm. Then, late one night, my phone buzzed with a new message. It was a photo of me, taken from outside my window, with a caption that sent chills down my spine: “You can’t hide.”

I now live in constant fear, always looking over my shoulder. I’ve changed almost everything about me from my looks to my personality, and moved to the next city over. I used to live in the isolation of the boondocks, but now I live in a densely populated section of downtown.

This bastard stole something invaluable from me—my sense of safety, my peace of mind. The terror we faced is etched into my memory, and I’ll never feel safe again knowing this monster is still out there, stalking me and Emily like a sick game of cat and mouse.

The last I heard from Emily, she was shipping off for basic training for the army, hoping to leave this nightmare behind her. She believed that the military’s structure and discipline would help her regain control and find safety. She’s always been the strong one in our group, and this decision is another testament of her resilience.

“I need to do this, Cameron,” she had said. “I need to feel safe again. I’ll be off the grid for a while, but I’ll reach out when I can.”

Since then, weeks have turned into months, and I haven’t heard from her since. Every day, I pray she’s okay and that she finds the peace she’s looking for in the service.

This is my story, the night we encountered the stalker in the woods, and the reason I’ll never feel at ease, even in my own home.
