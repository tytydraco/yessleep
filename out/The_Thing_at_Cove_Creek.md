The last campout I went on was June 3rd thru 9th, 2019. It was supposed to be a fun trip; a campout with my troop, with some fun opportunities for hiking and we could get some advancement done.



This, however, could not be further from the truth.



It started out normal; we pitched  up camp after a long drive from Alabama, did a count off, and headed to sleep.



The next day, everything seemed normal, except for one detail. One scout, James, seemed quieter than usual, and seemed to stare off into the distance even when everyone else in camp was playing games and having fun.



My leaders, which I had years previously deemed naive, ignored this.



James had always been the quiet kid in the troop. He had no friends in this group, not because he was bullied, but simply because he never worked up the courage to talk to people.



It was for this reason that the adults decided that nothing was wrong, even though it was obvious to me that something was off.



I should’ve done something. Anything. But we were going to swim at a nearby lake. The water, the laughter, it all pulled me away. I convinced myself it was nothing.



Night fell once again, we counted off, and we hit the hay.



That night, at exactly 12:37 am, my watch’s faint glow barely cutting through the darkness, I heard something, a low, trembling coming from James’ tent. His voice was barely more than a breath, trembling with desperation: “Please... no... I’m not ready.” The words sent a cold chill creeping down my spine. My heart pounded so loud I was sure it would wake the whole camp. I stayed in my tent, too scared to move. I told myself I was imagining it. I soon fell asleep and didn’t think about it when I woke up.



That morning, nobody noticed James was missing. As he had no friends in the troop, no one realized his absence until count off. After realizing that he was missing, my troop sent out a search party assuming that he was simply lost nearby.



This persisted until around noon, a 15-year-old named Jonathan walked into camp, his expression blank and pale. This was highly unusual for him, since he was usually the upbeat one that kept everyone going. This alarmed the leaders and I, who were doing a board of review for life rank at the time.



He said only two words: follow me.



He led us down a path through the woods for about half of a mile. Along the way I noticed deep scratches on a tree, too high for a bear. We continued, until we saw him.



His body was like nothing we had ever seen.



His shirt was perfectly cut down the middle and spread out on either side of him. His chest cavity seemed to be cut open in the same fashion, exposing that all of his organs were perfectly removed leaving only a hollow space where his abdomen should have been, no blood left whatsoever.



This was not the most disturbing part of the scene however. His eyes were missing, but not in the same fashion as the internal organs. They seemed clawed, almost as if they were scratched out while he was still alive, blood smeared around his face.. Supporting this theory is the fact that his mouth was stretched in a silent scream, as if he was in pain throughout this ordeal.



The scoutmaster ignorantly deemed that it must have been a bear attack, even though it was far too complex to simply be the work of a bear. They called his parents, and a while later they arrived to pick up the body.



The next day, Jonathan was found dead. His body was in exactly the same state as James. This shook the leaders, and they decided to end the campout the next day.



We still stayed in camp one more night, however, for reasons I could not possibly fathom.



That night I heard something outside my tent. It sounded like gentle footsteps; soft, deliberate, and they seemed about 500 feet away. The forest was eerily silent otherwise. Feeling as though I should not be a coward, I stepped out and looked around.



That's when I saw it.



He, or at least I assumed it was a he, stood about 8 

feet tall. His skin was pale, almost translucent, stretched tight over scabs and sores that looked like they’d never heal. His arms dragged almost to the ground, ending in claws long and sharp enough to slice through flesh like paper. No eyes stared back, just empty, dark sockets that seemed to suck the light from the world. No ears, no hair. Just slit nostrils twitching like a predator sniffing the night. And his mouth... a jagged maw filled with too many teeth, twisting in a grin that promised nothing but pain. 



The worst part? He was coming straight for me.



That’s when I bolted.



The month prior I received my learner’s permit, and I drove me and my dad up to the mountains. With the keys in my pocket, I raced to the car and started it. I drove away as fast as possible, with the Thing in pursuit.



I abandoned the campsite and hit the highway.



Sometimes, late at night, I think I hear those claws scraping outside my window. I don’t know if it’s still following me. And honestly… I’m not sure I want to find out. Some things from that night are better left alone.
