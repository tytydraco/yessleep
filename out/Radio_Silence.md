" Yeah I’m he-

" What the hell do you think you’re doing Phillips?! Why didn’t you answer your radio check?"  
" Tried answering boss, but the line was busy with you and Shelley’s pissing contest. Got started on this her-\*ooofff\* Holy shi-this lock is tough. Makes a bank vault look like a…bloody bike lock. "   
 " Fuck you Phillips you answer your radio when we call you hear? "  
" Franz on comms do-

" Franz on comms! Guys I’ve- I’m in the server room. I’ve hooked myself up to the servers but most of this stuff’s encrypted. There’s no timestamp on anything here and I can’t tell the useful files apart from the rest. "  
" Is there no way to differentiate between them? "  
" Negative, Shelley. I’d have to download everything here onto a separate hard drive and run the decryption off-site. "  
" Shit. Fine then. Franz, start copying those fi-  
" Shelley! There you go again! Giving out orders without the lead’s clearance. Franz takes orders only from me. As does Phillips, as do you. I have not delegated leadership to you, so stop acting like I have. "  
" Oh, I’m sorry sir. What was your plan then? You going to tell Franz to spend 2 whole hours in the server trying to decrypt files without his computer? Or maybe sit there with his thumbs up hi-  
" Franz, copy the server file onto the hard drive an-  
" Hey, I-  
" -your way over to Shelley’s location in the CCTV room. Help her with co-ordinating and support. Shelley, you have been a pain in my ass since the get-go. I’m going to say this once; get your shit together or I swear, this is the last job you pull with this crew. "   
" Yikes. Guys, I just wanted to-  
" …….."  
" What?"   
" Phillips, come in. Let us know what? "   
"-a minute. Fuck! Phillips on comms, sorry. The lab’ walls are thick and the door looks like it’s built withstand a nuclear strike. I think it’s interfering with reception down here, so I’ve had to step back a minute. "   
" Franz on comms. I think they gave us some out-of-date blueprints then, because the mission intel said-  
" Hold on a second, I think I might be almost through. Comms won’t work down there so I might be going dark for a bit team. "  
" Shell-  
" That’s not acceptable Phillips. Get that door open, but do not enter the labs. As soon as I’m done in records, I’ll make my way down. You stay put until we have a better idea of what to expect down there. "   
" Bull. It’s been almost 15 years Howard. To the day. Whatever experiments or samples they left down there when they bailed, have definitely been tainted by now if not spoiled entirely. "   
" Franz on comms. It did Shelley. It actually- y’see the place runs off of a series of self-sustaining generators, working by a redundancy system. Solar panels, geothermal and wind turbines. When one isn’t working, the others pick up the slac-  
" Your point, Franz?  
" Right, err-sorry. Point is that the place was built to keep a steady supply of power flowing to the labs, even in the event that this place was abandoned. Readings show the building has had a steady supply of power since closure. No power outages, not a dip in even one month. In any given scenario, the building’s systems would maintain power to the lab’s refrigeration and air-con systems to prevent against any possible specimen contamination. "  
" Well I’d rather not have to wait ages for Howard and Phillips to finish grocery shopping in the lab. This pla-  
" Shelley, you are more than welcome to go back to the van and wait for the rest of the team to complete the job, if the idea of simply sitting unsettles you. "  
" Fuck you. "  
"………What? "  
" You heard me Howard, you narcissistic shit, Go to hell. "  
" I have had it from you Shelley! The minute we’re done here I’m booting you off of this team. If you had spent more time on due diligence and less time pissing and moaning about the pay or the jobs, you might still be leading. But no, you lost your team and I swear when this is ove-  
" Franz on comms. Sorry to butt in like this Howard but-  
" What is it Franz? "  
" It’s jus- I found some unencrypted files. There’s a whole folder full of them labelled as “Emergency Protocols” and they list procedures in the event of fires, break-ins, power outages and the like. We need to lea-get Phillips to come back! "  
" Why-what’s going on? "   
" The pla-this lab was built with several fail-safes. This was to make sure that they would be prepared for anything that happened. One of these protocols was to shut down power to every area of the building and redirect all of it to the lab and the compu-  
" We know this already, Franz. Get to the fucking poi-  
" That’s what I’m getting to. The protocol, we thought it was in the event of an attack, but it’s not. In the event of a break-in, the building doesn’t redirect power to the lab, it sterilises the samples and purges all of the files from the server. But the protocol running now sealed the lab and redirected power to keep its systems running, its containment. "  
"……..what"  
" It’s meant to keep something in the lab, not out. "  
"………….oh go-  
" Shit! Phillips? Phillips get the fuck out- Shelley do you see-where’s Phillips? "  
…  
"Shelley! "  
"………..He’s in the la-his comms signal has him in the labs…"  
"Fuck! Okay, Franz, you keep downloading the files and get ready to rendezvous with Shelley in the foyer. Shelley, pack up your gear but keep tabs on the feed in case Phillips shows up. What’s the fastest way there? "  
"You take the second stai-no first stairwell down 2 flights, then cross over the corridor to the emergency stairwell and head all the way to the bottom. There’s an fire door but blueprints say it should be unlocked. "   
" Roger that. I’ll get in touch when I’ve made it down there. You two pick up your gear and prepare to leave. "   
" Wa-wait a minute! We know radios don’t work down the-

"I’m at the labs Shelley, connection’s spotty like Phillips said it was. Does it show on the GPS where Phillips’ comms link is? "  
"I’m looking at the systems now. His ping is coming from your location, 30-no! 26 feet ahead. You should see him there- it says he’s right in front of you. "

"-almost there. There, can you hear me clearly now? "  
"Crystal. "  
"Alright, that’s good at least. The walls must be interfering with radio signalling. Could also explain why Phillips’ GPS has him here- must be the last signal your system picked up. Check again what does it say now? "  
"So what’s the pla-  
"It jus- it sounded like your comms got cut off-I’m- never mind. So now what? "

"Damn it Franz! I expect this crap from Shelley and-  
"I know si- I know but I just got a ping in the server room. It responded to another modem in the building. Someone just attempted to access another terminal in the building. In the labs. I think Phillips may have tried to switch one on. "

MISSION BACKGROUND:  
Team \*REDACTED\* was dispatched to \*REDACTED\*, a remote laboratory and weapons R&D facility. \*REDACTED\* was designated by a command as a point of interest, with the facility being a contested asset for both \*REDACTED\* and \*REDACTED\* forces. The facility was designated a priority by command as of \*REDACTED\* and a team was assembled to the facility lead by \*REDACTED\*.  
The team’s goal was to infiltrate the facility and locate the server room, records room and the laboratory. The primary objective was to search the laboratory for any technology or materials worth retrieving. The team was tasked with retrieval of necessary digital research files and physical documents from \*REDACTED\*’s server room and analogue records. Secondary objective was to purge \*REDACTED\*’s servers and sterilise the remaining laboratory materials, ensuring that there was nothing left for anyone who came after.  
Mission started at \*REDACTED\* and was scheduled to be completed by \*REDACTED. A full \*REDACTED\* has passed since the mission’s estimated completion window. \*REDACTED\* has not made any contact with \*REDACTED\* to confirm mission status.  
MISSION BRIEF:  
Team \*REDACTED\* is to be dispatched to the facility at \*REDACTED\*. Primary goal is to assess the status of the original team and determine completion of mission parameters. Should assessment determine original mission objectives incomplete, team \*REDACTED\* shall complete original team’s mission objectives. Secondary goal is to determine the status of Team \*REDACTED\*.  
Expect minimal resistance. Facility has been abandoned for \*REDACTED\* since the start of \*REDACTED\* War. Team \*REDACTED\* is authorised to take standard non-lethal ordinance.
