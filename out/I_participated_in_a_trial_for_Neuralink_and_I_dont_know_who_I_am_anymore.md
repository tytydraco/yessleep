I underwent a trial for Neuralink. For anyone wondering why, I received $50,000 for participating in the trial. Additionally, I've always been a fan of technology, buying the new Iphone every year, smart watches, drones, and everything. So imagine my excitement when I first saw the advertisement for getting paid for having Neuralink installed in your brain. I considered myself as becoming superhuman, in addition to the lump sum of money. Among the advertised features of Neuralink was browsing the internet just by thinking. You could just think of a question, such as "what is the capital of Kenya", and you would get a voice in your head saying "Mombasa". If for example you didn't know any fact, instead of Googling it, you could instantly hear the answer in your head, allowing you to win trivia competitions completely effortlessly. You could also play movies and audio files directly into your brain.

The procedure was completely painless. I don't remember it. They just put me to sleep, and the next thing I know it, I'm waking up. The doctor then came into the room and said, "Jake, the procedure is done." I blinked at him, as if not knowing what to say. I literally had no thoughts in my head at that time. The doctor continued, "An immediate side effect of the procedure is short term memory loss. You may not remember some things. Patients usually forget some things that happened before the operation. But your memories will eventually come back to you. It takes some time, but you'll remember everything. Your award will be deposited onto your bank account."

Still sleepy, waiting for the anesthesia to wear off, I was escorted by the medical staff out of the operation room, through two sets of corridors, and into the lobby. I was sitting there in the lobby, still struggling to get a thought out of my sleepy head. Within a few minutes, I had woken up completely. I thought about what the doctor said, about the short term memory loss. I sat there with my eyes closed, and suddenly my memories started flooding in. They told me everything that I needed to know. My name was Jake, and I just underwent the first human trial of Neuralink, becoming a superhuman cyborg. I couldn't wait to try out my new ability.

As advertised, this Neuralink search engine feature was only triggered by the word "Neuralink". So I thought a question, "Neuralink who was the 18th president of the United States?" And I heard a loud, booming, masculine voice saying

**Ulysses S. Grant**

Ok that's cool. I genuinely didn't know the answer to that question. I thought another question, "Neuralink in what year was Napoleon Bonoparte born?" It answered,

**1769**

This was so cool, I was superhuman! The doctors told me that I specifically had to think the word "Neuralink" to trigger the device. Otherwise it won't work. It sits passively in the background, scanning your active thoughts, until it hears it's name being called. Then it responds with an audible hallucination. It's just as if you hear someone standing right next to you and saying something in your ear, except that you don't actually hear anything. It's just an audible thought that you receive. It sounds just like someone said it, but in reality you could be sitting in a quiet room. You could ask it to play music, play a podcast, cool stuff.

I couldn't wait to get back home and play with it. And also, I couldn't wait to get to the bank, and collect my reward. I walked out of the hospital lobby, feeling good about myself.

I was suddenly stumped, where do I go? And then I felt my memories flooding back to me all of a sudden. Oh yeah, the parking lot is to the left. I walked around the corner of the hospital, and I saw the parking lot. Funny that I briefly forgot about it. Maybe it has to do with the short term memory loss that the doctor mentioned.

As I was walking into the parking lot, I saw a mental image of my car. Oh yeah, that's my car. It was a white Tesla Model X. I suddenly remember buying it for Christmas three years ago. At first, I had to steer to drive it, but apparently one year ago they upgraded them to be fully self driving.

As I got in the car, I thought about going home again. For a split second I saw the mental image of a small white house in the middle of a field of grass. And then my memory came back to me. I live in an apartment in the city, sharing it with two other guys whom I've known since college. Yes, that's where I live. Why did I think about that house? That's strange. Yeah, it's probably just my imagination.

I strapped my seat belt on, and I told the car via voice activation, "take me home", assuming that the car had already been trained to recognize where "home" was. The front panel lit up with a map displaying me the address of my apartment. From then I just had to relax on the seat, while the car did all the driving.

We drove through as city, and while the roads didn't seem familiar, I figured it was just due to short term memory loss. Sure enough, my memories came flooding to me in a few moments. Of course, I've always taken these streets to go to home before. This is in fact the same route that I took to get to the hospital.

During the drive I spent more time playing with my new gift. I asked, "Neuralink, What is the pharaoh Akehaton known for?" It answered in it's deep, booming voice:

**Akhenaten was a pharaoh who made religious reforms, built a new capital at Amarna and sired Tutankhamun, one of the most famous ancient kings.**

I then asked it, "Neuralink, why is Tutankhamun one of the most famous ancient kings?"

**Tutankhamun is so famous because his tomb was discovered entirely complete, containing fabulous treasures that helped the egyptologists to better understand the process of mummification.**

We had an interesting conversation. Before I know it, I'm at my apartment. The car drops me off at the front entrance, while it drives off and parks itself. I go into the apartment, and the short term memory loss again hits me. Seriously, what's my unit number? Where do I live? I had a faint glimmer of a thought, but then I lost it. And then my memories came back. I was presented with a mental image of a door on floor 5, the unit number 55. And then I thought I heard a voice inside my head saying "fifty-five". That kind of stopped me in my tracks, and I looked around, yet no one was there. It was barely even a voice though, more of like a thought. It definitely wasn't from Neuralink, because it didn't have that clear, booming, pronounced quality. And yet it somehow wasn't in the same mental voice as my own thoughts. It was kind of off. I don't know. It was probably just my overactive imagination.

As I got into the elevator, I hit the button for floor 5, and the elevator started to ascend. I felt a gut feeling that I'm not supposed to be here. For some reason, as if you're in a part of the city that you haven't been to yet. Like when you're in a dangerous back alley or somewhere. But I just brushed it off. After all, I had lived here for the past 5 years since college. This was my home.

The elevator stopped, the doors opened, and I came out. My unit was the third one on the left side of the hallway. I came in front of the door, I saw that house again in the middle of the field of grass. And then that thought just dissipated. My hand reached into my pocket, took out the key to my apartment. I unlocked the door and went inside.

I was greeted by a spacious living room with lots of video game consoles strewn across the floor, underneath a big flat screen TV. Two men sat on the sofa, at the opposite side of the room, anticipating me. I looked at the men, and blinked. My memories came flooding back to me. These guys were George and Jim.We went to college together. We were roommates and best friends ever since.

"You got it?" "How did it go?" I answered, "Well, I've been having some short term memory loss. Nothing really horrible though. Just some known side effects. The doctor warned me about them." George said, "Well bro you just gotta take it easy, and wait for the memories to return to you. Don't trust fleeting thoughts."

How did he know that the memories return to you? That's only something that the doctor told me. Did the doctor tell him too? Or did George read up on the procedure online?

They quickly looked at each other. Then they started laughing. "Aw, it's cool man, no worries." "Here Jake, let's play some video games." "You know you want to. You know it's our family tradition." They were smiling, laughing, hugging me, slapping me on the shoulder blades, and in general being very friendly, positive, and energetic. I started laughing too. And then I saw a memory of us playing video games together in the past, multiple times. Apparently it was just a thing that we did, playing video games together.

Something in me, like a gut feeling, made me feel scared and out of place, almost as if I didn't recognize the room for a split second. I don't know, for some reason I frantically looked to the door. As if it's my first time here or something. Like I'm in a house party hosted by random strangers. But that's silly, I live here, and these are my guys, my bros.

By now Jim had already plugged in the cables, the controllers, and started the video game. The slapped my shoulder and belly laughed. We poured some Sprite into small cups made of transparent plastic, and toasted, and drank it. Before I knew it, the whole bottle was emptied out.

We started playing a video game. It's strange, I didn't recognize that game before, but my mind told me that I've been playing it this whole time for the past several months. Sure enough, my character "Jake" had the highest score with the most stats. I lost the first few battles. It felt like I was playing the game for the first time in my life. The controls took some getting used to. Then my memories came back to me. I remembered the controls. I remembered how I played this game with the guys many times already, how I was one of the top players. Still it felt clumsy and awkward playing the game. And all of a sudden I got a "download" of sorts. I don't know, it just left as if I didn't know how to play the game at all, and then all of a sudden I knew everything about the game, how the controls worked, how the levels worked, what were the weak points of all the enemies, where to find every single collective item and power up. Before I knew it, I was beating the guys, and I was playing very successfully. I was like a pro gamer, like a champ. It felt so fun, it was all so addicting.

We played video games that entire day. We drank Sprite. And then a delivery guy came in bringing some pizza, so that's what we ate. I was getting quite used to this place. As a matter of fact, I have lived here for the last five years. These guys were my friends. I was in good hands.

The rest of the evening I entertained them with my newfound abilities. They asked me a whole bunch of trivia questions. I thought these questions to the Neuralink, and it answered me with the usual booming voice. Then I told the guys the answers that it told me. It was very cool. I was able to answer questions about history, astronomy, chemistry, celebrities, politics. The guys marveled at my abilities, and took every opportunity to praise me. I felt awesome. It was a good day.

As I started to feel tired, I was taken to my room. I laid down on my bed and got comfortable. I would sleep well that night. I thought enthusiastically about tomorrow. I had plans of going to the bank, and collecting my reward. That will be fun. I like money. Before I knew it, I was asleep.

I had a weird dream that night. I dreamed that I was in some house. I dreamed that I had a wife and kids. I was sitting in a living room with this girl who was apparently my wife in that dream. We talked about some things that I don't remember. I walked around the house. And then I went out onto a grassy field on top of a hill. It looked like a rural area. I could see the mountains. I did some work around the yard. As if it's something that I did on a regular basis. Then I went back into the house. As I was walking into the house in the dream, my dream surroundings faded out to black. It's almost as if they dissolved. During this time I heard a "plonk". Like a mechanism locking into something. I found myself in a black void. I stood on a hard surface, but I didn't see anything. And then the black faded into a fantasy landscape, a desert with red sand, and a sky with purple clouds. I walked in this desert until I came across a palace that looked ancient Sumerian. I went inside the palace. Then giant, golden Anubis statues attacked me, but I cast a spell onto them, and they burst into flames and disintegrated. Then I climbed the steps of the temple until I found a giant pit filled to the brim with golden coins. I jumped into the pit, and just before hitting the coins, I woke up.

It was morning. I staggered out of the room. My friends were sitting on the sofa, waiting for me. We played some video games, and ate some food. Then I told them that I'm going to collect my reward. I came out of my apartment, and the guys told me to come back after I've collected the reward. I went out of the unit, took the elevator back down to the first floor. As I went out of the building, I saw my car driving to pick me up. The doors opened automatically. And I went in. I told the car that I wanted to drive to the bank, so it drove me.

While we were driving, I thought, "Neuralink, play the Moonlight Sonata for me."

**Sure, playing the Moonlight Sonata**

I heard the music, and it sounded much better than what you would hear coming out of your earphones. It was as if I was there at the concert. As if I was in the same room with the musicians. There's a subtle difference between hearing music coming through the earphones, vs hearing it live, and you could tell the difference. It felt just as if it was a live music. I really enjoyed it.

We arrived at the bank. The car doors opened, and I got out. I came up to the ATM, my hand got in my pocket, and pulled out my credit card. I inserted it into the machine and waited. Then it asked me for my pin. I hesitated, I didn't know what my pin was. I spent a few seconds trying to remember it, but I just couldn't. And then I heard a voice in my head saying "one nine eight two". It definitely wasn't the Neuralink voice, and yet I couldn't pin point it to a particular part of my mind. As if it was an external voice, but internal at the same time. It felt really weird when I thought about it later. But for now all I wanted was to get the money. So I entered the numbers, and surprise the pin worked! And the ATM took some time to print out the money for me. Then I spent some time counting it all, and yes, it was indeed the full $50,000 that I was promised by the company. Something felt wrong though. But I kind of brushed it off.

The next several days were uneventful. I continued hanging out with my bros in my apartment. We were having great time, and great fun. Then after several days, I dreamed being inside that mysterious house again. I felt as if I had lived there. Strangely, I felt more at home in this dream house than in my actual apartment where I lived in real life. I was seeing this girl, but when I awoke I always quickly forgot what we were talking about. I just felt that I knew her somehow, even loved her. The strange thing about these dreams is that after a few minutes I would always hear a "clunk" or a "plonk", a strange mechanical noise, like the inside of a device. Then the dream scenery would fade to black, and then that black would fade to some other dream scenery, typically some fantasy or science fiction environment. Like the inside of a castle, the inside of a spaceship, the inside of a temple, a forest, an iceberg, a desert, even walking on top of the clouds. This occurred multiple times.

Strangely, when I awoke, I always kept forgetting the first part of the dream, whereas the second part of the dream I remembered. Within a few minutes of awakening, the first part of the dream faded away, but the second part of the dream became clearer and stronger, almost as if it was a memory in the waking life. The only reason why I even remembered the first part of the dream at all, was that I wrote it down in my notebook within a few minutes of awakening. Otherwise I would have forgotten about it at all.

I began to explore this strange phenomenon. I browsed on reddit and various forums. No one could tell me what that dream meant. The scenery was the same, a small white house on a gently sloping grassy hill. Inside lived a young woman and two toddlers. Even though this part of the dream was kind of bland, in comparison with the very vivid fantasy dreams, I felt that it was very important. I do not know why I felt that way, only I knew it.

Then one day, I had that dream again. I was in the house, sitting on the couch. The girl was sitting in my lap. She said, "I love you Michael", and then she kissed me. I very much enjoyed the kiss. I loved her very deeply, and I felt as if I had known her for a long time. For a minute or two, we just kissed very passionately, in an embrace of lovers. And then I heard the Neuralink voice booming from within my dream.

**Stop it. Stop it. This isn't real. This never happened.**

I was shocked. I sit up, still in the dream, still in the house, struggling to process what just happened. And then I heard the "plonk", as if some mechanism activated. And then the dream just collapsed. The house environment just faded away to black. I was holding the girl, and the dissolved and faded away into black, within my arms. I was shocked that happened. I loved her, and then she was just gone. And everything turned to black, and I was feeling myself falling in space.

And then I found myself running through the halls of the Death Star. I was in the Star Wars universe. Stormtroopers were running after me, and shooting at me. It was a very fun and exciting dream, but I felt a deep sense of loss and remorse. I felt sad for losing that girl. I really loved her. I ran and ran. I outran the soldiers, opened a side door, collapsed onto the floor, and just cried. I was still in the dream, in the Death Star, but I remembered that first part of the dream. I don't know what happened, why did the first part of the dream dissolve. I was in the Star Wars universe, but I hated it. Because here was no love for me. I tried as hard as I could to get back to that house, but I just couldn't. Then the door flew opened, a Stormtrooper entered, and he shot me in the head. Then I woke up.

I frantically wrote down the first part of the dream. I wondered about what that meant. In the first part of the dream, I was always in the house with that girl, but then the dream always collapsed and then coalesced into another dream. I really loved her. But why did she call me Michael though? My name is not Michael, it's Jake. I just thought it was a weird dream thing. I still wrote all those details down on the notebook.

The most creepy thing in the dream was that I heard the booming Neuralink voice from within the dream. I rationalized it away, "it's just a dream dude, get over it". I was just dreaming. It doesn't mean anything. I still was shook that entire day.

But then I asked George and Jim what they thought about that dream. I expected to hear supporting, wise words. But instead they mocked, insulted, and belittled me. They said that it's just a dream. Jim told me, in a almost threatening way, that I should not have any more dreams like that. George said that I'm mentally ill. When I said that it might have something to do with the Neuralink, they told me that I'm a paranoid idiot.

I still wondered, who was that girl in the dream? I saw her somewhere, it's at the tip of my memory, but for some reason I can never reach it. Why did she call me Michael though? That's not my name. But the said that name with intent, as if talking to me. And where is that house? Why does that dream keep collapsing? Why do I hear a mechanical noise every time that happens?

I feel a deep sense of loss, but I don't know what exactly I lost. I don't know how to explain it.

My friends shouted at me, and bullied me into stopping talking about that. I had the same dream occur several more times, but each time the dream dissolved with a loud "plonk", and then rematerialized into a completely different landscape. As hard as I tried, I could not go back to that house after it dissolved into the void.

After a few months I forgot about it, and started living my life. I had almost forgotten it after three months. Nothing uncharacteristic has happened so far. And then happened a certain situation that caused me to remember the dream again.

Three months later I was shopping at the mall in another part of the city. I had never been in this mall before, yet I knew it as if it was the back of my hand. I don't know exactly how or why that happened. I could visualize what part of the mall lay beyond the corner, but I wasn't there previously. It looked strangely familiar. But I just brushed that feeling aside, despite being able to navigate through the mall without a problem.

I was in a clothing store within the mall, when I heard a voice behind me, "Hey Michael. How you been? How are Jessica and the kids? What's up?" I turned around and saw a big black man wearing a store uniform standing behind me. The man was very big, tall, with very pronounced arm and chest muscles, but with a saggy fat belly. "Did you break up with her? What happened man?"

"What do you mean", I answered. "I'm not Michael, my name is Jake. You must have me confused with someone else." I felt a shiver down my spine when I said that though. He used the name Michael, the same name that the girl in the dream. Could it be?

**Run. This man is a criminal. He is a murderer, rapist, and serial killer.**

My Neuralink was speaking to me, without prompting it! I didn't say the key word, and yet it told me. How is that possible? I stood dazed and confused, trying to piece together what had happened in these last several seconds.

**RUN!**

I don't know why, but I took off running through the store like my life depended on it. As if under hypnosis, I ran through the mall. I didn't stop running until I reached the food court. Then I stopped to catch a breath. And then the absurdity of the situation dawned onto me. What was I running from? There was no danger. Come on, there's no way that a criminal would be working at that store. He used a different name? He just probably had me confused with some other person. And I laughed at myself for being so silly, and I walked back to the store to continue my shopping.

As I reached the general area that I had been in previously (men's shoes), I heard some commotion, but I kept going until what I saw made me stop in my tracks.

That black man was being dragged away by a bunch of private security and riot police. They put a leather bag over his head, and muffled sounds came out. Not wanting to be part of trouble, I ran out of the mall, not having bought anything. But this was all very weird, and I couldn't understand what was going on.

I wanted to know what was this mystery, but my roommates would mock me. So I had to keep my investigations a secret. Whatever it was, it all led back to that dream I was having. That little white house in the middle of the grassy field. Where was it? My Neuralink was supposedly good at reading my thoughts, searching the web, and finding me the result in an instant. I pictured that house in my head, with as many details as I could. And then I thought, "Neuralink, where is this house located".

**There is no such place. Stop searching for it.**

I was shocked and disturbed at the threatening tone that it said in. I decided that I would search the old fashioned way. I looked up Google Maps, Realtor, Home Info. For two months, I found nothing. And then I remembered that mall on the other side of town, where I had seen that black man. I searched around in that area, and pretty soon I found a house on the outskirts of the city.

It was the same house, that same one! The one that I've been seeing in my dreams. I wrote down the address on a piece of paper. So it was a real place after all. Now my plan was to go to that house, and find out what was there.

I got up, and two minutes later I sat back down at my desk. But something was wrong. I no longer remembered where that house was located. I no longer remembered what was the address of that house. I took a look at the paper where I wrote that address, but it was blurry. Something was wrong with my perception. I could read my dream journal just fine, I could read books fine, but when I looked at the address that I wrote on that paper, I just saw a blur. I tried to find that house again on the Google Maps, but I just couldn't. I don't know why. It's like I wasn't able to understand how to use Google Maps anymore. I know that I've done it a hundred times before, but I just wasn't able to understand what I was seeing. I tried buying eyeglasses, but none could make me see the address that I wrote on that paper. I tried all kinds of magnifying glasses. It just looked like a blur. And I lost the ability to use Google Maps again. It was as if I was looking at some complicated physics equations far beyond my knowledge. My brain struggled to process that information.

Finally, I conceded that there maybe a problem with my Neuralink installation. I called the company. After four hours of waiting for the music to end, I finally got a hold of a human operator. I told them everything that I've gone through so far. I told them of my stuggles to see and understand certain things. I told them how I was having problems dreaming. How I was forgetting certain information. After a long pause, I heard the operator reach a conclusion and tell me what my problem was.

"Code 0X641: The error that you're getting is an uncompleted memory download due to a Neuralink glitch, leaving traces of the previous identity intact." "Please come to the clinic at once so that we can fix your Neuralink, and complete the memory transfer process."

I don't know what to do. Should I go to the clinic? Should I complete the Neuralink installation? I haven't told Jim and George yet. They've been acting condescending and hostile? And what about that house? How can I get there if I can't read the address?

Who is my mother? My father? Who am I? I know my name, but who am I? I don't know?
