Hi dear nosleepers, this is my very first post here. I know there are lots of  wonderful fictional novels here, but I\`d like to share my real experience that has puzzled me for a long time.

Before I start, I would like to apologize in advance sincerely. Since I am not an English user, grammar errors is hard to be excluded in this post. However, I will do my best to make the text readable.

This happened during my high school years. At that time, I had very few friends. Due to class transfer, I met a new desk mate, who is a beautiful girl but isolated by the others. Her name is Taozi, or we can call her Apri. Her face looks very much like an famous asian actress Tang Wei and is also very small in stature. This makes her looks like a pocelain doll. I was very proud to have such a beautiful new friend in those days and had a strong desire to show her off to my famillies.

In our daily talks, Apri revealed sorts of splinters of her own family life. Such as her mother always be mean to her and her parents has been doing business in other cities for years. Being left alone in her teenage in this small village and being bullied by other local girls made her very eagered for family solicitude and friendship. So when she saw my loving mom cooked and delivered my bentos to school every day, she expressed her wish to visit my mom and have dinner with us. (It should be added that parents could only temporarily store bento boxes or other stuff in the gatehouse, but were not allowed to enter the campus or directly interact with students, so Apri and my mother did not meet  face-to-face before.)

As soon as two girls hit it off, we decided to visit my family that Saturday.

When the weekend came, **Apri put on a brand new Chinese embroidery cotton-padded jacket,** which I never saw her wore it before. **The sapphire blue fabric was dotted with golden patterns, and a snow-white fur collar liftd up her face.** I teased, "Are you celebrating the New Year? " More, **she even made up two small braids and wore colored contacts**, which were forbbiden in school. And she even came much more earlier.

Due to my family's tradition, every weekend we spend in my grandma\`s,  then I took Apri to see my old lady. At that moment my memory goes very detailed: When we were waiting at grandma\`s gate, Apri stood on the first step to the right of the door. This height allowed me to observe her face directly. **She wore a pair of grey comtics contact lenses, eyelash was not well brushed, and mascara was a bit caked**. Since I was much taller than her and never view her in this angle, I can confirm that this scene has not appeared before.

At this moment my mom went upstairs. As soon as she saw Apri, **her eyes widened**. She was very surprised and said, "Wow, is this Apri? How could you be so cute! Let\`s get in and say hi to grandma." Then grandma opened the door, saying, "Hi Apri. what an adorable girl. I create a lot of new dishes to greet my granddaughter\`s new friend." Apri was very, very happy at that time, a bright smile climbed up to her face. **She Shyly twisted her braids** and said, "Thank you, Auntie, thank you Grandma."

Afterwards, we had a very pleasant meal. After dinner, my mother chatted with Apri and listened to her family issues. Her troubles evoked my mother\`s compassion. So **my mom asked her if she was willing to be her "gan-daughter"** (very close to a goddaughter) and invited her to come over whenever Apri felt alone or hungry. Apri nodded overjoyedly like a baby bird.

They also privately exchanged phone numbers that day. I knew this on the next day. After the evening self-study (around 10.30pm), **Apri showed me the text messages she received from my mom.** My mom called her ***Gan- Yao\`er*** **(the youngest goddaughter)** ,and wished her **"a good dreamie"**. She kept praising my mother for her childlike kindness, and solemnly wrote this message down on our shared diary book.

It was at the end of that winter holiday, Apri was bullied by girls from other school. The bully girls even stalked to her residence for harassment and intimidation. So her parents took her away from our village and sent her to a new school in another city. From then on she never revisit my home again. After that, I was in my nervous senior year of high school. And my phone was confiscated and I lost contact with Apri since then on.

After graduating from university, about 5 years later, Apri and I recontacted with each other by a stroke of luck. I recalled that dinner to her and invited her to my house again. I asked her if she still remembered my grandma and her cooking skills.  Unexpectedly, Apri denied it ASAP, **saying that she had never been to my grandma's house before and never ate anything she cooked.** I was particularly shocked because the details of that gathering were very vivid and realistic. Then I asked **my mother** for proof, **she also said that Apri has never come to our home or my grandmother's.**

I was very puzzled. If they never meet before, how could they exchange phone numbers? Then, how did Apri show me the "dreamie" message from my mom?

More even, Apri has always advocated that her memory surpasses that of ordinary people. She **recalled a lot of details of that winter**. Such as, my mother once missed her very much, and worried about her diet when she was alone. So mom cooked several dishes and asked me to bring them over. Apri swallow them like in one breath, and said that foods from a mom was the most delicious thing, even the onions, ginger, and garlic were tasty as hell.(She hates those seasonings at ordinary times)

She also remembers that when I took a week of sick leave from school, she texted me saying that when you were not around, I had to study alone, eat alone, walk alone. Wherever I went and whatever I do, I was all alone. **She can recall these sentences even in the original order, but only forgets the dinner with my family.** Of course, I'm not blaming her, I just think that the dinner would be more impressive than these trivials, especially to a person with good memory.

As someone who didn't give up, I turn to my grandmother for confirmation. **She was very certain and said, "Yes. I\`m quite sure this little girl came to my home before.** I remember her because she impressed me with her **grey eyes**.  At the first sight I thought she was a foreigner. " And she also came back to the scence that "**when Apri came to the kitchen to help the cleaning, she even said that your mother wanted to be her godmother.**" "But honey, later I whispered to your mother don\`t do that. I don\`t want my granddaughter to be jealous. Your mom nodded and said okay."

&#x200B;

Well, this is the thing that confuses me for a long time.

Since this text is a bit long and I\`m not sure if I deliver the details clearly,  I highlighted the key infos. Assuming that Apri never had the dinner with us, the most basic logic line will make no sense.  I mean, **if so, Apri and my mom wouldn\`t exchange their numbers, then she wouldn\`t receive a message calling her "goddaughter"**. Also, in our high school we lived in a fully enclosed campus and were not allowed to go out till weekends.But our family were with my grandmother on weekends, so it's unlikely that my mother will encounter her and exchange numbers elsewhere. Then again, if she came over for meal, indeed, why does she and my mother have no relevant memories, while my grandma and I do?

Thank you for reading. And I genuinely welcome you guys question any unreasonable aspects.  This may help me discover more details or recall more things.
