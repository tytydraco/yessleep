A walk in the park  
So, this is a story from when I was younger, aged 9 or 10, and my first encounter with a skin walker. Now people do say that if they are found, the person actually could just be hallucinating or something, but for me, it was well... Different.  
  
  
10 year old me thought it would be okay to go to a park near my house and play all by myself, and the park has lots of trees, bushes, literally lots of anything green, so I thought it would be okay to just- Chill at the park! So I went down and started rollerskating, and I hear rustling in the bushes, but I ignore it the first few times, until it got more frequent. Each time I turned my head to the area, the noise stopped, and I decided to continue skating. Minutes pass, and this keeps happening, so I decided I should go home soon, and so I went to the ledge, near the bush, and sat down on the ground to remove my skates.  
  
  
I was untying the laces, and undoing the straps, when I look behind me, and see this deformed as f\*\*k creature- Now, it was actually a deformed dog, but it didn't look like an actual dog, it's eyes were just white, and that literally scared me. I got up, my skates were still on my feet, and I tried to run, but it was hard because as I mentioned before, I'm wearing skates. The 'dog', caught up to me and I tripped over, it crawled on top of me. I thought this was the end of my life because seriously, who thinks that a creepy white eyed dog will spare your life. I pushed it off me quickly and I ran, again tripping. So I had enough of this, I took my skates off quickly and threw it at the thing, but the thing was painfully transforming into a human-like figure, which scared me, causing me to run; But the more I run, the more the thing chased me.  
  
  
I got home and ran inside the house, shutting the door and locking it, but when I peer out the window... It was gone.  
  
  
This isn't the end though, I kept in mind that this could literally be something that'll forever hunt me down, that'll find me everywhere I go, scared to go out alone. A few years into the present, age around 15, I went down to that same park to get a sweet nostalgia vibe from when I was younger, completely forgetting about that incident, until I heard the rustling again. I, this time, knew I had to get away from the bush, but I just decided to walk around a bit, and chill out of the grass, so I did. The humanoid thing jumps out of the bushes on top of me, pinning me down, I could feel it's hot breath on my neck, my legs weak as my lips quivered.  
  
  
An to this day, I never went to that park again.
