Entry 9:

20th of July 2025. Camp.

Subject: New Species Description. 

We woke early in the morning and I, Eleanor Vance, have been assigned with field description of the creature. We opened the cooler and observed the following:

Taxonomy unknown. Specimen unclassified provisional genus: *"Dentivorus Borealis.”* 



Morphology: 

Length (approximately) 7 inches, excluding tail. 

Weight (approximately) 750 grams. 



*Dentivorus* resembles a naked mole rat in many ways however, with many key distinctions. Larger in size of course, but also possessing thicker, leathery skin in addition to backwards facing quills used for defensive posturing, a thick tail like that of an American opossum and heavily reinforced, black, chisel like incisors measuring almost an inch and a half in length supported by a robust and powerful set of jaw muscles.

Note enlarged cheek pouches. Exact contents unknown until further examination. However, we have our suspicions…

While *Dentivorus* did not initially show its bioluminescence like I had witnessed before, after some time left alone, a soft blue glow became evident as it attempted to escape the confines of the cooler. Thin glowing lines ran along its flanks originating from its long whiskers and terminated at the base of the tail where they transitioned into rings that ran along the tail's length. 

During this time *Dentivorus* emanated a low humming noise in tandem with a rhythmic chittering. Its cause or purpose is unknown, however Lars hypothesized it could be attempting to communicate with others of its kind if it was indeed a eusocial species like the naked mole rat it resembled.

Strangely we did happen to notice feeling a sense of inexplicable dread whenever the *Dentivore* would begin these vocalizations. We formally attributed this to residual stress, but it was noteworthy nevertheless.

Subject: Necropsy of *Dentivorus Borealis*.

Vivisection and necropsy of *Dentivorus Borealis* was postponed a day to give the team time to record any extra data and witness any unique behaviors they could, but in the night *Dentivorus* had chewed a hole through the wall of the cooler trying to escape. 

Sven intervened hastily. Upon grabbing the creature by the tail, he reacted instinctively, not systematically, and eviscerated the creature with his bowie knife. The resulting disembowelment, which scattered the creature's internal organs across the tent floor, immediately rendered any chance of a controlled vivisection null.

The necropsy was largely unremarkable, save for the contents of the cheek pouches. These were confirmed to be Professor Davids' teeth, just as we suspected. Secondary contents included several small copper coins, a small jeweled earring, and several small, weathered vertebrae. Evidence of prior victims?

Sub-dermal imaging showed that *Dentivorus* was indeed bioluminescent, rather than biofluorescent. A noteworthy distinction as there are no currently documented cases of mammalian bioluminescence. The exact source of the *Dentivorus*' glowing is still unknown, but its purpose we can still only speculate is for communication in the dark, low light tunnels we hypothesize *Dentivorus* resides in. This was further backed up by evidence of traces of dirt and stone on the incisors. 

Lars quickly hypothesized that *Dentivorus* consumed teeth and bone for their calcium and phosphorus needs, essential components likely powering their bioluminescence. However, the fact that the contents of the creature's cheek pouches remained stuffed, rather than consumed, struck us as odd. Sven argued that if *Dentivorus* was, as Lars suspected, eusocial, the contents must be a resource for a *Queen*. This would mean the den could not be far from our camp. The evidence warranted immediate action, and a quick expedition to locate the den was unanimously approved.

Astrid and Freja feverishly offered to accompany Sven that afternoon. Returning just before dusk claiming to have found the location of the den approximately 2 kilometers from camp along the woodline to the North. Sven recommended that we should all set out to the site tomorrow morning and reestablish camp. 



Entry 11:

22nd of July 2025. En Route.

Subject: Location of the Den.

We woke early this morning prepared for our journey only to find our gear already packed and ready for the trip. Sven, Astrid, and Freja, however, were mysteriously absent. Fearing the worst, Lars and I swept the surrounding area. The missing three returned shortly from the direction of the den, claiming they had simply prepared our things earlier to hasten research. While suspicions were raised, we set out regardless.

Approximately ten minutes into our journey, we came across the professor's marked gravesite only to find the large, heavy rocks had been mysteriously displaced. Upon inspection, we made a horrifying discovery that all that remained was a gnarled lump of limp, pale flesh and fabric, stripped clean of bone. A state horrifyingly similar to the reindeer carcass we found four days prior.

Sven immediately pointed out that if terrestrial scavengers had patrolled through the area, they wouldn't have left this much nutritionally dense flesh. Lars quickly agreed, noting that even a bear, the only predator capable of moving stones that large, certainly wouldn't take only the bones. The horrifying, singular answer was clear: this must have been the work of other *Dentivores.*

We finally arrived at the new campsite and are fully set up to begin collecting data. However, the discovery at the gravesite confirmed our worst fear: the creatures are organized, and capable of moving mass far exceeding their individual weight.

Subject: Collecting New Data.

We arrived at the rather unassuming den at noon. Hardly even noticeable if it wasn't for the complete lack of living vegetation in the surrounding area. The den's entrance was located at the base of a dead ash tree only a few tens of meters from the woodline.

Lars posited that if *Dentivorus* was anything like other burrowing rodents that it was likely that tubers and plant roots were a staple part of their diet. The deadened vegetation in the area being a result.

Having most of our equipment already set up at the new site has really accelerated the speed at which we can start collecting data, but concerns of how long we can stay out in the field have been raised. 

Originally we had set out to survey the native reindeer population for two weeks, but with a member of our original crew missing Sven speculates that the remaining rations may last us an additional two days if all goes well. Extending our stay to possibly the 30th before resources ran out.

 New data about the *Dentivore* den is already flooding in.

Acoustic imaging is revealing a massive underground labyrinthine network of tunnels spanning kilometers in each direction. Some readings are even showing the tunnel network possibly extending well below bedrock. Further exploration will be needed to confirm. 

Lars and Astrid discussed the possibility of using an RC car the professor had brought. Mounted with a GoPro and flashlight to be sent down with a tether to explore the tunnels we began collecting crucial visual data that afternoon. 

Our remote exploration vehicle, we nicknamed *"Mickey"*, revealed that the tunnels started off quite narrow, hardly larger than any of us in width, continuing laterally before descending downward and expanding in width. These tunnels were almost large enough to stand in. These deeper tunnels were a perplexing maze of intertwined networks, many culminating in dead ends.

Among them was a new variation: the *“Soldier”* Comparable in size to a wolverine or badger, a morph clad in pointed, chitin-like plates, possessing a shovel-like head, and appeared far more aggressive. The *Soldiers* paid no mind to the robotic interloper trespassing in their domain, largely remaining still. Even in the darkness of the tunnels they slept during the day. A behavioral sign supporting Lars’ hypothesis of a nocturnal cycle. 

As we kept venturing farther and farther into the depths of the labyrinth we struck a fork in the tunnels. One led back up while the other led deeper down. Collectively we let curiosity decide that we would venture deeper. What *Mickey* uncovered next shocked us. 

The tunnel expanded into a cavern easily the size of a London flat.

 *“The Throne Room”* was decorated in the bones of a variety of species littering the floor. Among the treasury of bone there were glittering coins and gemstones scattered among them that grew in quantity toward the center of the room where a black bear sized creature sat atop a hoard of assorted treasures.

*“The Queen”*. She was a massive, grotesque abomination of elongated flesh with stubby, vestigial limbs. Her body was segmented by chitin-like plates, her head almost engulfed in her own pale, translucent flesh. She writhed with slow, rhythmic undulations, glowing with a ghastly yellow hue. Dozens of small white pups nursed around her as *Mickey* crept closer for a better look.

But as *Mickey* approached we were rudely interrupted by a notification that *Mickey* had lost power. A critical oversight that could have been easily avoided. We attempted pulling *Mickey’s* tether to no avail and came to the conclusion a rescue would be necessary. 

We discussed among ourselves how we could recover *Mickey*, with the only visual data we have contained on the SD card located on the mounted GoPro. The answer was obvious, if not inherently dangerous given what we’ve seen the *Dentivores* were capable of. 

We stood speechless for a moment surrounding the remote monitor, almost in silent opposition to what we knew must happen. Come morning, a manned descent into the den was the only chance of recovering *Mickey.*

Subject: Recovering *Mickey.*

The conclusion of last night’s voyage hasn’t left our minds. A silent understanding overtook us all. We knew what we had to do, but who could do it? Who of us was brave enough? We couldn't just choose at random who to send to their possible death. The entrance to the den was far too narrow for any of the remaining men to fit inside, and we needed our lead technician to monitor acoustic data and diagnose any problems with *Mickey.* 

A mournful melancholy loomed over the campsite. The anxiety was palpable, and the gravity of the situation was not lost on us, but before anyone could even speak a word in objection, Freja began adorning herself with a mounted headlight and gloves in preparation to spelunk the den herself and rescue *Mickey*. Freja, being a good 30 kilograms lighter than myself and noticeably skinnier, was the most logistical choice after all. A fact, she said, we had to accept. 

In a brazen confidence, unlike anything we've seen from her to this point, she exclaimed that she had to do this. We’d come too far and the professor’s death would not be in vain. She declared that she would descend into the den, recover *Mickey*, and that would be the end of it. She demanded that when this was done we would collect our data and return to the village to call the university and come back better equipped. 

Her bold proclamations resounded in us all. To hell with data and discovery, we didn’t sign up for this and it wasn't our responsibility. We would recover the SD card and prove to the world what we’d seen and leave it to the professionals. 

As she assumed her position and began crawling into the mouth of the unknown, we waited anxiously around the acoustic radar, watching the red blip that represented our friend descend deeper into the widening tunnels. We watched as she approached each junction and gave her directions over the radio to *Mickey’s* location. 

The air grew tense as the thickening earth and stone began to consume the radio chatter with more and more static. After a time, far longer than *Mickey* had taken to reach the same location, Freja had been able to clumsily crawl her way to *Mickey.* 

One critical issue remained: While she successfully followed the tether and our precise acoustic guidance to *Mickey's* last known location, the moment Freja descended below bedrock, she disappeared entirely from the imaging monitor and was totally obscured by the thickening earth.

24th of July 2025. Base Camp.

Subject: Extraction.

Freja successfully reached the cavern, stopping at the threshold of the *Throne Room*. Over the radio she signaled that she had eyes on *Mickey* and was ready for extraction. With the rover secured, she gave the tether a sharp tug, signaling us to haul her up. We each grabbed hold of the line and began to pull Freja out inch by agonizing inch. Then, with an abrupt, horrifying release of tension, the tether gave way. Pulled from the den entirely, leaving Freja without any lifeline to the surface.

To make matters worse, dusk was quickly approaching, the hive would almost certainly wake up soon and an intruder in their *Throne Room* would almost certainly be met with immediate, aggressive force.  

We instantly scrambled to plan our next course of action. Examining the acoustic data, we desperately looked for any viable escape route above where we lost her. We suddenly remembered the junction leading upward from the *Throne Room* and signaled Freja to backtrack through the threshold and divert to that upward path. It might lead to an undiscovered exit to the den we hadn't mapped yet.

Freja frantically complied and began slowly crawling her way to the possible exit. Hand over foot she continued crawling, her anxiety audibly mounting over the radio as she raced against the clock.

Unbeknownst to her the sun had begun to set, and the acoustic monitor was picking up signs of movement in the upper levels of the den.  We signaled over the radio that time was nearly out and urgently requested her current status. The chatter went silent for a moment as the static thickened. The sound of seemingly endless distortion was finally cut off as we received a frantic reply.

Freja had made it through the tunnel as directed, but confessed she had hit a dead end. She informed us that the path had narrowed before opening up into an expansive, excavated room. 

She described the chamber as cold and humid, the walls covered in a moist, glowing fungus-like carpet that radiated a ghostly neon-blue hue. We stammered, unable to formulate a plan. The acoustic imaging confirmed our worst fears: the *Dentivores* were rapidly closing in on her location.



Entry 15:

24th of July 2025. Camp. 

Subject: Discovery. 

Freja’s distress call confirmed our fears. The cavern was in fact a dead end. She was effectively trapped. On the acoustic monitor, we watched the signature rumble of movement intensify, filling the tunnels as the creatures closed in on her position.

Drawn by the smell of an intruder. The chamber soon filled with both *Worker* and *Soldier* morphs, their chittering infrasound now a palpable, sickening vibration felt, more than heard, through the monitor.

The *Dentivores* began sniffing around the *Throne Room*, inexplicably leaving Freja untouched in her corner. Meanwhile Sven made a catastrophic decision. With a shout that was more desperate resolve than plan, he threw himself into the narrow mouth of the den to attempt a valiant rescue.

Immediately, several *Soldier* morphs in the cavern raised their plated heads, alerted to the fresh trespasser. All turned and surged toward the tunnel entrance, leaving Freja confused and alone.

We attempted to pull Sven out of the den’s entrance, grabbing his feet as he fought to crawl deeper. He insisted he could reach Freja, but our argument was cut short as the sound of gnashing and tearing erupted from the earth around him. The creatures had him and began to pull back. Lars and Astrid each grabbed one of Sven's legs, and we fought a horrifying game of tug-of-war against an unseen force in the dirt. 

The resistance was immense and sudden. Ultimately the *Dentivores* won and pulled Sven deeper into the den with the sickening wet sound of peeling flesh as they pulled him through the tight entrance. His muffled screams slowly vanished into the earth as we looked on in disbelief.

The attack was not over. Three *Soldier* morphs then suddenly erupted from the entrance, their plated bodies glistening in the blood of their last victim in the dying sunlight. Astrid and I reacted instantly, scrambling onto a stack of supply boxes and the raised acoustic array, just high enough to escape their reach.

Lars was less fortunate. A *Soldier* immediately lunged for his legs, causing him to trip and lose his balance. As he tried to regain his footing, a *Soldier* fixed itself to his pant leg trying to pull him back down, while a second leapt onto his face. 

Lars violently attempted to tear the first creature away, but another crawled up his thigh and gnashed at his groin, joining the assault  causing him to fall once more, screaming in horror as the creatures continued their onslaught.

The next moments were a blur of absolute terror. Two *Soldiers* now focused their attack on his skull. They violently clawed and gnashed into his scalp and face, their efforts driven by the need for the bone that lay beneath. Lars’ screams of agony quickly became choked gurgles as the flesh was stripped from his face, rendering his head to exposed bone. They ripped open his eye sockets and mouth, burrowing into his skull while he writhed uncontrollably. 

We were unable to do anything but watch in horror as the *Soldiers* began to devour Lars from the inside out. Their wriggling bodies could be seen moving beneath his skin, the sickening, splintering sound of breaking bones filling the evening air.

Meanwhile, the third *Soldier* was methodically tearing through his leather boot, chewing at his toes. Astrid and I had no choice but to remain frozen atop our precarious perches, waiting for the creatures to finish their hellish consumption in relative safety. 

We signaled to Freja, with no response, and ultimately concluded we would have to wait out the night until the morning light. The hellish spawn that ended the lives of three of our friends only mere meters from our feet. We braced for a long night while the long hours crept slowly by. 

As we began to fade into unconsciousness to the sound of wet enamel gnashing on cracking bone. Hopefully the earplugs will be of some help.
