*Prologue*

On the surface, it was a road like any other, I suppose. Twisting, turning, a few bumps along the way. Just a quiet, little dark stretch of road, connecting what's here to there. There's one in every city, I'm sure. The street that's home to deadman's curve. The bridge so old and rickety,  you hold your breath as you traverse across it. The hitcher, standing menacingly on a dark and stormy night. High Meadows Boulevard had it all, and more.

*The Curve*

If you die on the curve, you stay on the curve. That's why he stands there. He stands there, waiting for someone to come along, hoping they're coming to take his place. He tries to make sure of it. He remains there, trapped between both worlds... until he can find his replacement. You see, the curve can't be without its deadman. 

They say he steps out into the road, just as you enter the midpoint of the curve. He tries to make you swerve to the right to miss hitting him. If you do, you drive your car straight off the embankment and into the river. This curve has no room for error. The trick is, you have to be expecting it. 

It usually happens at night, but not every night. He wants you to let your guard down, and that's exactly why you can't. It doesn't matter if you see the deadman or not. Make no mistake... he's there. He is *always* there. Waiting, watching, hoping. The locals know this all too well. But, every once in a while, an outsider comes along, and the curve gets a new deadman. 

The longer he's trapped there, the more desperate his attempts become. Sometimes he is seen lying in the middle of the road, pretending he's injured. Other times, his approach is more... violent. But, no matter what he does, you *must* ignore him. And you must *never* stop your car. Just keep your eyes forward, and drive. 

The deadman isn't a ghost. His body continues to decompose with each passing day. He isn't a zombie, either. He's quite lucid, and very much aware of what is happening to him. The curve is simply his purgatory. His punishment. 

One night, a long, long time ago, the full moon hung low in the sky, as a man tore down the boulevard with a sinister purpose. He had caught his wife cheating, and was on his way to murder her lover. Blinded by his rage, he didn't see the curve, until it was too late. He cut the wheel hard, and as the car began to skid off the road, he swears to himself that death would not stop him from reaching his destination. 

When he awoke, his car filled with water as his eyes filled with blood. He frantically clawed at his restraints and escaped from his vehicular prison, crawling from the river like a reptilian creature. Only, he found himself in a new prison. The curve. 

He attempts to continue down the road on foot, but just as he lifts his leg to take the first step out of the curve, a bright light flashes. When he opens his eyes, he finds himself back in his car; back in the river. 

No one knows exactly how many times he must have tried to walk away from that curve before he realized it was hopeless, but eventually, he did. He gave up and stood there, waiting for someone to come along and help him. Several cars passed right by without giving him so much as a glance. But, eventually, someone did. 

A car stopped along side him, and the window rolled down. The driver agreed to help him, but as the car began to exit the curve, a bright light flashed and the man vanished from the backseat. When he opened his eyes, he had once again found himself back inside his watery grave. 

They say that's the moment he decided; if he were to remain trapped in the curve, then he wasn't going to suffer through it alone. He crawled from the river and stood in the middle of the road. Fueled by hatred, he watches for an unsuspecting victim to come along. Standing, waiting, rotting. If you don't think you can make it past the curve, you have no business on the boulevard. Things only get worse from here.

*The Bridge*

If you have to cross the bridge, you'd better hold your breath while doing it. Honestly, the best thing you can do is just avoid it all together. Sometimes, however, that's just not possible. If you find yourself in that situation, cross if you must... but, whatever you do, don't breathe on the bridge. 

They say, when you approach the bridge, take in as big of a breath as you possibly can. You'll need it. It takes about a minute and a half to cross, while maintaining the speed limit, of course. The only problem is, most people can only hold their breath for *one*. You cough, you sneeze, you're dead. This bridge has no room for error. The trick is, you have to be ready for it.

It happens every time. There is no safe way to cross the bridge without holding your breath. Those who have tried, have failed. You see, this bridge is home to many '*suicides*'. People will inexplicably stop their vehicles, get out, and jump from the bridge down into the watery depths below. The locals know this all too well. But, every once in a while, an outsider comes along, and the bridge gets a new suicide victim. 

The longer it takes you to reach the other side, the higher the stakes become. Speeding is necessary, but dangerous. The bridge often ices, causing a substantial increase in the chances of sliding right off. The barriers are thin, and the waters below are unforgiving. But, no matter what, you *must* speed. You must make it across *without* breathing. Just hold your breath, and drive. 

The bridge itself is not evil. It's merely a structure that acts as a conduit for it. It has no malice, either. It has no control over the horrors that take place upon it. The bridge is simply an instrument. One used to enact vengeance.  

One night, a long, long time ago, the full moon hung low in the sky, as a man was being hanged from the bridge. He'd done a terrible thing, and suffered an equally terrible fate as punishment for it. As he hung there, drifting back and forth in the moments between life and death, he uttered a curse. Any breathing soul that dare cross the bridge shall be delivered unto hell. 

The hanged man had been a murderer. He'd killed his lover, after she refused to leave her husband. Filled with the agony of jealousy late one night, he slithered into her bedroom, like a reptilian creature. He looked down at her as she slept peacefully, and smiled before sliding a blade across her throat. Only, he found himself feeling a new agony. The bridge. 

The townspeople had decided to take justice into their own hands. They'd marked the hanged man for death, and dragged him to the bridge for execution. As they placed the rope around his neck, the crowd cheered, and the man was told that the bridge would snap his neck, rather than strangle him. That this would be the last mercy he'd receive before eternal damnation. Only, it didn't, and it wasn't. 

No one knows exactly how long he hung there, gasping for air, clawing at his throat, his eyes filling with blood. But, eventually, we guessed that it must have been about a minute and a half. He struggled and he thrashed for what must have felt like forever, and in his mind he called out to both God and the devil himself, begging for someone to answer his prayer. And, eventually, someone did.

A voice inside his head spoke, but it was not his own. It asked the hanged man what it was that he wanted most in this world. Unable to conceal the truth of his thoughts, the hanged man answered the voice. He wanted revenge.

They say, that's when he decided; if he couldn't breathe on the bridge, then *no one* could. His body fell still, and the hangman's prayer had been answered. His corpse was removed, but his soul lingered at the bridge, ushering in sacrifices to hell, in exchange for his wish. Hanging, waiting, watching. If you don't think you can make it past the bridge, turn back now and face the curve again. Things only go downhill from here.

*The Hitcher*

If you see the hitcher on the road, decide quickly. In this moment, there is but one of three choices you could make. You could try to drive past him, you could turn around and face the bridge and the curve once again, or... you could choose to pick him up. 

They say, every choice you make in life has consequences. Each one will produce different outcomes. But, the choice you make when you see the hitcher is the most important choice you'll ever make. If you choose wrong, you'll suffer a fate worse than death. This choice has no room for error. The trick is, you have to sure. 

It almost never happens. That's why you won't be prepared for it when it does. You could drive down the boulevard everyday for 70 years and not encounter him. Or, you could drive down it just once and have it be that one unlucky time he's there. The locals know this all too well, and some still take their chances. But, every once in a while, an outsider comes along, and sure enough... the hitcher is there. 

After you've dodged the deadman at the curve, and breathlessly crossed the bridge, you'll find yourself at the high point of a hill. What lies below that, directly in your path, is the hitcher's stretch of road. If he happens to be prowling the boulevard that night, that's where he'll be. 

The Hitcher isn't a man, although he may appear to you as one. He is the culmination of all horrors you've already experienced on the boulevard. He won't try to run you off the road, or make you hold your breath. No, what the hitcher does is much worse. He makes you choose.

One night, a long, long time ago, the full moon hung low in the sky as a man stood out in the middle of the boulevard. The silvery light of the moon shined down on the shadowy void of his form, but the hitcher was not illuminated. As he stood there, hollow as the darkness itself, his intent was to offer a choice to each car that may encounter him.  

The first car to approach made the choice to turn around. That person, deciding to abandon their journey, went on to face the same horrors they had faced previously. They held their breath as they crossed the bridge and drove right through the deadman, resigning to try again another day. 

The second car that saw the hitcher chose to drive right past him, without a thought. They kept on driving through the night, though never reaching their destination. Trapped in an endless loop of asphalt, driving into the very essence of nothingness, it didn't take very long before the driver succumbed to the total abandonment of hope. 

Everyone knows exactly why those two choices are better than the third. And, eventually, you'll come to realize it, as well. Choosing to pick up the hitcher has an unknown outcome. Better the devil you know than the devil you don't. Yet, the hitcher remained steadfast, his thumb extended out, waiting for someone to stop and pick him up. Until, eventually, someone did. 

I stop my car in the middle of the road, and quickly flash my lights twice to signal to him. The hitcher approaches and makes his entry, slamming the door behind him. I put the car in drive, and ask him where he's heading. He looks over to me and smiles. 

They say, that's the moment he decided; *this* choice would lead to a different fate. Anyone who picks up the hitcher would be given an offer, in exchange for a consequence. The offer would be irresistible, but the consequence would be dire. Hoping, praying, wanting. You say yes. As you sit there, lingering in the moment of your choice, you may think you've outsmarted the boulevard. After all, it sounds too good to be true. And if there's one thing you should have learned about the boulevard by now, it is.

*Epilogue*

On the surface, it's a road like any other, I suppose. Except, there are no twists, no turns, and no bumps along the way. Just a lively, sun-kissed stretch of road, connecting what's here to there. There's one in every city, if they're lucky. The curve that everyone wants to live on, the bridge that's so pristine and picturesque it could be a painting, the friendly neighbor waving as you pass by on a summer day. High Meadows Boulevard had it all, and more.
