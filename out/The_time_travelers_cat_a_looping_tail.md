There *is* a cat in this tale, but first we have to talk about time travel, and why it’s rubbish.

I’m reminded of a woman—we’ll call her Katt—who works in an office. Every day Katt gets on the 5:15pm train, and every day she sits on the same seat on her way home, and she never varies this habit. But one day Katt gets a visit from her future self, who gives Katt a note that reads, “Don’t take the 5:15pm train,” which she explains is because the train is going to crash, and Katt will die if she rides it today. Katt thanks her future self for the warning, and her future self tells her she will find a time machine and will have to come back in precisely one year and share the same message.

The year passes.

Katt has lost the original note. So she writes a new one. Just as she tucks this new one into her pocket, she finds the old note, now a little more wrinkly. She prepares to go back in time with the newly written note, thinking she no longer needs the old one and can discard it.

But then, curiosity stops Katt. She pockets both notes: the one she just wrote, and the one given to her by her future self precisely one year ago. Then she goes back in time to meet her younger self.

Younger Katt is alarmed by the contents of the note (“Don’t take the 5:15pm train”); but she is also puzzled because Katt cheerfully hands her *two* near identical notes—one is just a little more wrinkly than the other—before telling her the entire story about the train crash, and reminding her not to forget to come back in time in one year, etc.

Younger Katt puts the notes away. The year passes. Like original Katt, she forgets where she put the notes, and writes a new one, and finds the old notes at the last minute. She brings back all three notes (Future Katt’s note, Original Katt’s note, and her own)…

… and passes off the three to the next Katt…

…. who passes off four…

… who passes off five…

… and on and on.

But then, what becomes of that very first note? Original Katt has set it onto an infinite loop. And so that first note, as it gets passed from one Katt to the next—each time getting more wrinkled—eventually it must disintegrate. Once it is gone, it can no longer be found in *any* time. Not in the past, and not in the future. Nowhere in time or space. So if that’s the case… did it ever exist at all?

It’s strange to think about, isn’t it?

\*\*\*

Time travel stories really are bunk.

Let’s try looking at this another way:

Every day Katt gets on the 5:15pm train, and every day she sits on the same seat on her way home, and she never varies this habit. But one day Katt enters her office and is stunned to see a massive floor-to-ceiling pile of notes, all with the same message, identical except for the varying degrees of wrinkling: "Don't take the 5:15pm train."

“Well this seems excessive. What's going on?” says Katt.

A voice from behind the stacks calls out, “Oh, good! You're here! Don't take the 5:15pm—”

“—train, yeah, I figured.” Katt gestures at the pile as her future self pops out from behind the papers. “What's all this?”

“The note warning you not to do it or you'll die!”

“But why are there 50,000 of them? Or... a million... or a gazillion. Or—how many are there?”

“No idea. A year ago I walked into my office and saw me standing here with all these notes. And me told myself that in one year's time I'd have to bring these notes back in time to my former self, and warn me not to take the train. ‘Why are there like a gazillion of them?’ I asked. And me told me a story. That once, there was just one note, but then the original me added a new note and handed both to the next me, who wrote another and added it and handed all three off to the next me—”

“Okay, so you're saying once upon a time, there was just one note, but we're forgetful so we kept writing more and adding, and they've been multiplying ever since?”

“Yep.”

“And eventually there will be so many notes they will swallow the entirety of the universe?”

“Well, no, for two reasons. First, *you* can’t transfer an infinite number—trust me, carting this many notes through time takes a toll on your back! Second, paper only lasts about five hundred loops. Honestly, even this office-sized pile would be impossible if they hadn’t been stored in the time machine, where time doesn’t pass. Also, fun fact, the whole existence of a ‘first note’ is just theoretical. Because keep in mind time itself is infinite. There's no actual beginning and no actual end.”

“Whoa whoa whoa! You've lost me.”

“There is no ‘original’ note. There’s always been a future me visiting a past me, despite the hypothetical origin story I told you, because the loop by definition requires a future and past. One minute in the past another me is bringing another pile. Two minutes in the past is another. And so on. Every me brings a pile. And this is how it’s always been and always will—er, excuse me, what are you doing?” The future Katt frowns, because Katt is now searching around the pile.

“Looking for the money.”

“What money?”

“The pile of money I should have left myself. Why just notes? Why not multiply something useful to infinity, like dollar bills, folded in with the notes—”

“Oh my God.” Future Katt shakes her head. “There are no dollar bills.”

“Why—”

“Because I didn’t bring any because *you* won’t bring any because that’s not how the loop works.”

“Supposing I start the trend now. Supposing I tuck a twenty into my note. In fifty thousand iterations, future me will be fifty thousand times twenty dollars richer.”

“Look, past me, the loop is already here, and in a year *you* will be *me* and you will be exasperated by your dumb and greedy question. You can try to change the future if you want but whatever change you make is what already is and what will be. It’s like fate.”

Katt makes a face. “I strongly disbelieve in fate.”

“You can strongly disbelieve and go on that 5:15pm train if you want. Or burn this pile! But you won’t. Because that’s not what happened, happens, will happen. And that’s the trouble with time travel. The past is unchangeable because it already happened, but the future is already the past for somebody, so from that vantage, the future that is the past is *also* unchangeable. Once something is known—like Schrodinger’s cat—it becomes fixed. But, here, here’s a bit of money to help you along your schemes. Go ahead and knock yourself out.” And she opens her wallet and takes out a one-hundred dollar bill, which she hands to Katt. “Remember to send the notes back! Bye!”

Looking over the massive floor to ceiling pile of notes, and imagining carting all of them back in one year’s time, Katt puts her hands to her head and sighs. “Ugh. Why did anyone invent time travel?”

\*\*\*

Now, like any good office worker faced with a mound of extra paperwork, Katt doesn’t just accept this whole time travel business or all the extra notes she’s supposed to deliver. “I am going to change the immutable nature of time,” she declares. “I will destroy the loop and prove I am stronger than destiny.”

So she grabs a handful of notes and hurls them out the window, into the street. The notes flutter down like rain. She tosses fistful after fistful. Watching them, Katt’s heart bursts with delight. Take that, fate!

Just then, the whistle of a police officer halts her enthusiastic littering. He motions her down to the street, and makes her bring all the papers she has littered back up to her office, only excusing her from a trip to the station when she bribes him with the hundred dollars that she happens to have in her pocket…

… a bill given to her by her future self.

Curse the immutable nature of time!

But Katt does not give up.

She runs a series of notes through the shredder.

She throws a bunch of the notes into the recycling.

She tosses a whole heap of them into the waste bin and lights them on fire.

Unfortunately, she doesn’t take into account the fire alarm. Only after she has extinguished the flames, and made excuses to her boss about how the fire started “accidentally,” does she notice the faded message on the notes she’s tried to burn. “Don’t take the 5:15pm train” the notes read in dwindling ink, like photocopies made on a machine running low on toner. Did Future Katt, finding the stack of notes a few inches short of the dramatic effect achieved by having them neatly floor to ceiling, use up the office toner making photocopies? Was that really necessary? And more importantly, is everything something that’s already been (un)done? Katt wrenches at her hair. Supposing she move the pile of notes to the dumpster out back? Supposing she flushes them down the toilet? Supposing she *eats* the notes?

She has a note choked halfway down her throat when it occurs to her that her future self will likely—or, given the vexing nature of time travel, already *has* likely—thwarted every half-baked attempt at breaking the loop’s integrity. How, then, to defeat fate and avoid carting around this literal mound of paperwork?

And finally, Katt decides, there is only one surefire way to break the loop.

She must take the 5:15pm train.

\*\*\*

She boards the train at 5:15pm precisely.

She will die if the notes are correct, of course. Getting onto the train is a mad idea. But Katt is by this time feeling quite mad, herself, and at least the loop will be broken and she won’t have to deliver the stupid pile of notes. She marches to her usual seat, the one she sits in every day, and the one she would have sat in had her future self not come to warn her and started the loop in the first place.

But her seat is already taken.

“You!” she exclaims.

“I told you not to get on this train,” says her future self, calmly, as if she’s been expecting her.

“What the hell! I thought you went back in your time machine to the future!”

“I’m on this train going back to the time machine. It’s at home in your basement, where I brought it when I came back in time, and where you’re going to find it when I leave it there.”

“What? If you took the time machine back here to my time and left it in the basement, and in a year I take it back in time to leave it in younger me’s basement… where did the original machine come from?”

“It’s a paradox,” replies future Katt cheerfully. “Luckily the time machine is made of unbreakable parts so it never wears down despite the infinite loops.”

“That makes no sense!”

“Time travel seldom does.” Her future self shrugs. “Speaking of which—I also left you a bag of cat treats.”

“But I don’t have a cat.”

“You will.”

“Stop that! Stop that right now! I’m going to break that machine!”

“Why? It saves your life.”

“But your notes say I’ll die if I take this train!”

“And you will. But don’t worry, why don’t you sit down and enjoy the ride? Look, it’s a bit rainy, but see how the gold edges the silver clouds? That’s why I like the 5:15pm train. Even with the rain, sunsets are beautiful…”

“You’re nuts!” cries Katt. “I’m going to die and you want to enjoy the scenery?”

“Some would say that’s a metaphor for li—”

At that moment, having fallen asleep to the patter of rain and a schedule too busy and too hectic, the conductor wakes to see they are heading into a curve in the tracks. He slams the emergency brakes. The train derails as it goes around the curve. The windows blow out along the train car, and Katt—the Katt from the future, sitting in the seat where she always sits—is thrown out of the car.

As she sees her future self thrown, Katt clings to the luggage rack. She clings for dear life as the train car slams to the earth and the cars crash and twist. Other passengers around her shriek. The passengers are thrown into seats, baggage, and each other. Many are injured. But the only fatalities are a few passengers who were thrown through the windows.

As the train comes to a halt and the dust settles, as the passengers huddle together and weep and emergency services are called, as the rain patters on the roof, Katt climbs out the window of the wreckage and staggers out into the wet under the gold grey sky.

“Katt!” she calls.

She wanders the rubble-strewn earth, and does not have to search long before she finds her own corpse lying in the debris. As Katt stands there, the rain drizzling down her shoulders, gazing down at the dead body of her future self, a profound sense of emptiness fills her. It feels as if everything inside her hollows out, and there is no joy, no light, no purpose: only despair. What truly is the point of anything?

A soft mewling sound comes from the body.

Thinking her other self might still be alive, Katt kneels down.

But her other self is very, very dead. Her own empty eyes stare unblinking into the rain. The mewling comes from inside her jacket. Katt reaches in, and finds that her future self was carrying a kitten, and that this kitten has sustained some injuries but is still very much alive, for it bites her. It is an orange tabby with an asymmetrical splash of white on its face.

Katt has never had an affinity for animals. But the juxtaposition of finding something so alive, so new and trembling and weak here in the midst of all this death, moves something in the stone that nearly became her heart, and she takes the cat and walks away from the train crash.

In honor of something her future self said, she calls it Shreddinger.

\*\*\*

You know where this is going, of course. Shreddinger becomes a mighty terror, once his injuries have mended. He lives up to his name and shreds everything in the house. He bites her all the time. His favorite treats are the ones she found in her basement. He demands to be fed at precisely 5:15pm every day, and if she doesn’t feed him, he widdles on the bed. He is an absolute disaster. Katt loves him very much. He is the only thing she has ever loved.

Every day she goes to work, and remembering the notes once piled high in her office (removed at her boss’s request and now piled in the machine in her basement), she takes the earlier train home because the 5:15 train spooks her. Every day she ticks off another box on the calendar. Every day she contemplates destroying the time machine, or sending it and the notes to some other time.

But she doesn’t, because it gave her Shreddinger.

Then one day, Shreddinger stops eating his 5:15pm meal. He becomes listless and skinny. He no longer bites her or shreds the furniture. Katt brings him to the vet, who tells her Shreddinger has leukemia. He does not have long.

He is not yet a year old.

Soon after, he dies in her arms. And long after his purr stops, she sees him everywhere: in his claw marks on the furniture, in the stains on the carpet, in the golden fur that still catches the light, even though she has since vacuumed. Everywhere is evidence of his short life. She always carries with her the last bag of treats that he never finished, unable to bear to throw them away, wishing she could feed him one last time.

One day—of course—she finds a kitten.

\*\*\*

And here we see the nature of the universe. The past is forever fixed and unchanging. But because the future is already the past for somebody, from that vantage, the future that is the past is also immutable. Everything is a memory. That is how we find the concept of God, what we may call predestination, or fate, or destiny. And we can rail against it but there’s only so much we can do.

So here is the decision Katt faces:

(Because you see, by now, she has figured out how to end the loop.)

On this day, the day she is to go back, she can bring the stack of notes through time, adding her own note to the pile, making photocopies to make sure it reaches the ceiling, bringing the bag of treats and the hundred dollars, and putting her younger self through everything she has already experienced, *or*… she can choose to not do it.

If she does not take Shreddinger, and the notes, back with her in time, then her former self will never get the warning. Her younger self will get on the 5:15pm train. She will sit in her usual spot, suspecting nothing. She will be thrown from the window and die.

And that will be how it has always been.

But then there will be no Katt to come by this way and find Shreddinger. He will never be rescued, and will die of leukemia alone in the box where she found him.

And so you have two possibilities: a Katt dead alone in the debris, and a cat scooped up by Katt and cradled to her chest as she stands over her own dead body. It’s the scene of Shreddinger’s Katt, alive and dead simultaneously. Whatever she chooses, Katt dies on the 5:15pm train one year ago. Katt always dies in the rain, whether or not she saves Shreddinger. She cannot cheat death, or time, or her own fate. Only this can she choose: die alone, or die with the tiny heart of Shreddinger fluttering against her own, witness to her death, just as she will hold him close and bear witness to his, each the final companion to the other in their last moments in a perpetual, infinite loop that neither begins, nor ends, but [lasts forever.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)
