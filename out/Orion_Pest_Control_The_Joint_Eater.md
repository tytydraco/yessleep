[Previous case
](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/ni4AknVFrf)

Our first atypical call after Samhain was, regrettably, a human infestation. At the risk of sounding unprofessional, it was a nasty one. Not quite as high up on my personal list of Most Disgusting Cases as the worms or the centipede curse, but it's *definitely* up there. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

Before I get into that though, I want to make it known that there will be discourse of starvation as well as vomiting going forward. This case was *not pretty,* to put it mildly. I know that those can be difficult topics for some individuals, so I thought it best to give a warning ahead of time. 

The client called us up after her doctor wasn't able to find anything useful. She'd dropped twenty pounds in two weeks, which is definitely cause for alarm. 

One thing that can cause such symptoms is called Hunger Grass. It's a patch of grass that becomes cursed for a variety of reasons. 

Some sources state that the Neighbors plant it, hoping an unsuspecting human will wander into it. Others say that it grows over the graves of those who were subjected to improper burials, or in areas afflicted with food shortages. It's because of these last two reasons that Hunger Grass was said to be rampant during the Irish Potato Famine. 

No matter the cause, the end result is the same: anyone that comes into contact with it is doomed to be afflicted with hunger pains for the rest of their lives, no matter how much the victim eats. There is no known cure. The victims are cursed with eternal starvation until their bodies eventually succumb to atrophy. 

One of the things that makes it so dangerous is that, to the uninformed, Hunger Grass looks just like any other thicket. There are no warning signs for it, which makes it far too easy to get the curse by accident. It is said that carrying a bread crust in one's pocket can protect you from the curse’s effects, but that doesn’t really help much if you don’t know that there is Hunger Grass nearby.

“I'm just… So hungry.” She complained weakly. “No matter how much I eat, it doesn't help.”

“When did this start?” I asked, already making a plan in the back of my head to question Deirdre on if she knew of any Hunger Grass in the area. 

Speaking of, it was her first day. She and Victor had a lot of ground to cover, so if I was correct about the Grass, I’d have to wait until they returned.

However, the client said something that made me rethink my initial diagnosis. The last time she could remember being well was when she'd been in her rowboat, enjoying a serene day on the water.

That prompted me to question, “By chance, you didn't happen to fall asleep while on the water, did you?” 

“Uh, yeah, I dozed off for a bit. Why?”

Oh no... Not Hunger Grass after all. 

I politely requested the client to hold on for a second, then got Reyna's attention. 

“You ever deal with a Joint Eater before?” I asked. 

Her face fell, eyes widening as she silently reached for the phone. That was a ‘yes’ if I ever saw one.

She then told the client, “Ma'am, I'm going to have to ask you to meet us by the river. Are you able to get there on your own, or do you feel too sick?”

The client admitted that she was extremely weak, so we offered to pick her up before heading to the river. For one, starvation is no joke, especially if its root cause is parasitism; the last thing we wanted was for our poor client’s body to give out. That, and with what Reyna and I had to do to treat the infestation, she was going to need all the strength she could muster. 

Before collecting the client, we stopped to get some supplies.

Joint Eaters get their name because of their parasitic nature as larvae. In order to complete their life cycle and reproduce, they require a host. Sometimes it’s animals, other times it’s humans. They aren’t picky.

They tend to take the form of newts in order to be small enough to enter a host’s mouth. They like to go after those that fall asleep by the freshwater they call home, so our client was, unfortunately, their ideal target. Once they make the host swallow them, they begin to consume every morsel that their host tries to eat, hence why they’re called Joint Eaters. 

While they’re living it up inside the host’s GI tract, that’s when they’ll reach maturity. The longer the Joint Eater infestation goes on (provided the host survives long enough), the higher the likelihood of it producing young, which also feast off of the poor host in a similar manner. 

In other words, we had to be quick. If the client was having trouble moving around, that wasn’t a good sign.

One of the things we had to get was cooked meat, so we settled for one of those unreasonably delicious grocery store rotisserie chickens. The other was a big container of salt. The reason for these two items will become clear in a moment.

The next step was to grab the client. The poor woman’s cheeks were hollow, her skin sallow and pale. She leaned heavily on me as I half led, half carried her to the company truck. She felt cold, her elbows bony in my hands.

The moment the client smelled the chicken, she stared hungrily at it. I felt terrible doing it, but in order for what Reyna was about to try to work, we had to withhold the food from her.

“Sorry.” I muttered, meaning it and wincing. “It’s part of the treatment plan.”

Our emaciated client just nodded, leaning her head against the window, her eyes quickly fluttering shut. Eventually, wheezy little snores began to escape her lips. 

Reyna, who was the one driving, exchanged a brief glance with me that told me she was feeling just as remorseful as I was. But it had to be this way. Once we got the Joint Eater out of her, the client could have as many rotisserie chickens as she wanted. 

The drive to the river seemed to take forever. With how fatigued our client was, she kept dozing off and on into fitful sleep throughout the journey. Once we parked, Reyna gently tapped on her to wake her up.

The client needed both of us to support her on our way to the riverbank, each of her thin arms around both of our shoulders. She’d said she lost twenty pounds, but with how frail she was, that leads me to believe that she must’ve been underestimating that number.

Reyna and I gently guided her to sit on the ground. Once we had her situated, Reyna began to delicately explain how we were going to get the Joint Eater out of her.

“We can either make it leave your body willingly, or we’ll have to make it too inhospitable for it to survive.” She informed the sick woman. “Neither way will be pleasant. We’ll try the first thing I mentioned first, since that’s the lesser of the two evils.”

The client let out a shaky breath, “Whatever you have to do, just… do it.”

“I’m going to have to hold you down.” I told her gently. “Is that alright?”

She nodded, groaning softly as she leaned to lay down on her back in the grass. Trying to be as gentle as possible, I kneeled over her, placing my hands on both of her shoulders. The client’s cheeks were wet, lip trembling.

“We’re going to get this thing out of you.” I promised her, trying to comfort her. “You’re going to have your life back in a few minutes. We just need you to hang in there, alright?”

The client sniffed, nodding again. She took a deep, trembling breath, then whispered, “I’m ready.”

Reyna and I exchanged glances, silently confirming with one another that it was time to get started.

I kept the client pinned on the ground, doing my best not to hurt her as Reyna removed the chicken from the plastic container that it came in. She held the mouth-watering entree a few feet above the client’s head. The client’s chapped lips parted, her eyes glued to the meat above her head.

I know how cruel this all sounds. Holding food above a starving woman’s head, just out of reach. In truth, I felt like the scum of the earth doing it. By the way Reyna’s brows were screwed together, her conscience was screaming at her, too.

Suddenly, the client’s body jerked beneath me. Her eyes went large, her mouth shutting, lips tightening as if she were fighting the urge to vomit. It was working. Thank God.

The client shuddered, whimpering. I pressed her shoulders into the ground, keeping her still. She began to struggle, trying in vain to knock me off of her, spittle gathering in the corner of her mouth. 

A lump became visible in her throat, slowly creeping up towards the client's mouth. It took everything I had to keep from gagging at the sight. 

“Let it out.” Reyna told her. 

The client's jaw dropped as if to scream. From behind her tongue, two slimy hands emerged, the dark orange fingers webbed. One of the hands reached out to grasp the client's chin, pulling itself towards the chicken while the other hand swatted at the meat blindly. Tears began to stream freely from the client's eyes.

Reyna backed away, keeping the chicken out of the Joint Eater’s reach. It let out a grumble as it continued to pull itself from between the client's jaws. She whimpered again as its beady black eyes became visible next, its wide mouth and flat nose reminding me of a frog. 

As Reyna kept creeping closer to the river, more and more of the Joint Eater became visible, its slick torso halfway out of the client's gaping mouth, her saliva dripping off of the parasite in thick strings. 

Eventually, it got impatient and just leapt out of her mouth with a growl, revealing its absurdly long legs, the knees pointing up to the sky like a grasshopper's. 

Reyna quickly scrambled back, hurriedly ripping off one of the chicken's legs and tossing it into the water. The Joint Eater dove in after it, disappearing beneath the surface with a heavy splash. 

The client sobbed, “I feel another one! God, help me!”

We'd been afraid of this. It had birthed more, and from the looks of things, our client couldn't take much more of this. 

“Alright, I need you to open your mouth,” Reyna told her, picking up the container of salt. “And you need to swallow as much of this as possible. Can you do that?”

Crying so hard that she was shaking, the client nodded. 

She was a trooper. She asked me to help her sit up, taking the container with a trembling hand. The client then proceeded to swallow mouthfuls and mouthfuls of the salt, grimacing as it went down. At one point she had begun to dry heave, needing to slap her hands over her mouth to keep it down. She trembled violently the entire time. 

I kept a hand on her back, doing my best to encourage her the entire time, “You're doing great. You're going to be okay. This is going to drive all of them out.”

After fighting to swallow another dose of salt, she suddenly stiffened, eyes large and wild. She began to crawl towards the river. I stayed by her side, gathering her hair as I heard her gag again like we were drunk girls in a college bar. 

When her mouth opened again, there was no slow build up as the remaining Joint Eaters fought to escape her body. These ones, being juveniles, were smaller. They hadn't developed their legs yet, slithering over each other in a steady stream as they hurried towards the water. 

While the salt makes them leave faster, it's also much more violent. But with how weak and shaken up the client was, quicker, more aggressive treatment seemed necessary. 

After the last one flew out of her mouth, the client let out an agonized groan. 

“Is it over?” She whimpered. 

“Do you feel anything else?” Reyna asked warily. 

The client shook her head. 

“That should be all of them, then.” Reyna assured her with a sigh of relief. 

“We're going to get you to a hospital.” I informed the client as I gingerly picked her up. 

When we got her there, they took her in quickly. Between the Joint Eaters’ tenancy and the means we'd employed to evict them, she was malnourished and dehydrated. They'd know better than us how to get her back into good health. 

That was about a few days back. The client reached out to us yesterday. To our collective relief, she let us know that she is doing much better and that she was grateful for everything we did for her. 

Sometimes, this job can be thankless. It was nice to have a client call back and give us such kind words and appreciation, for once. 

It was also a welcome change of pace to have something relatively simple to contend with. No gods. No headless horsemen. No terrible debts. 

However, when it came to the threat to Deirdre’s life, I had begun to overthink. And then I overthought some more until I came to an epiphany: I'm tired. *So tired.*

The mechanic is a truly exhausting nemesis to have. 

It feels Sisyphian. I push the boulder up the hill, stopping him from committing one atrocity, only for it to roll back down again. Over and over. For how much longer? Until one of us is dead? Until Orion is wiped off the face of the earth, only for a less competent company to take over? Until we finally kill the mechanic, and he is similarly replaced with another devil?

Does it truly have to be this unending cycle? 

Stopping Deirdre’s vision from coming to fruition was obviously a priority, as was ensuring nobody would be following Cerri on her way out the door, but after so much deliberation, it became clear that both situations were part of a much bigger picture: the feud between Orion and the Wild Hunt. 

We tried fighting. We tried negotiating. Neither worked. Maybe it was time for something else. 

At the risk of sounding like an idealist, maybe compassion would be the key. Unfortunately, I'd need at least one of the Hunters to meet me halfway. The exact same Neighbors who've held vendettas against not only us, but for humanity as a whole for hundreds of years, if Iolo's rant at Deirdre and [Briar’s tirade in the church](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/QUIiEcIolc) are anything to go off of. I'm not sure about the Houndmaster's stance, but I'm sure it's equally as unfavorable towards us. 

I thought I should start with the Huntsman I have the most contact with, even though he was the one I suspected would be the least cooperative.  

Beforehand, I decided it would be prudent to discuss my intentions with Victor first. 

Reyna had abducted Deirdre and Wes to give Cerri a proper send-off, as well as for ‘employee bonding purposes.’ The boss and I would be joining them all afterwards. 

When I was done explaining all that I'd been deliberating, the boss didn't sugarcoat it. “He's never going to go for it.”

“Probably not.” I agreed with a sigh. “Not without some sort of incentive.”

“And how, exactly, do you plan to convince an ancient psychopath to consider empathy for the first time in his long life?”

With a snort, I joked, “Well, when you say it *that* way, my idea sounds ridiculous!”

“I don't need to remind you that the Neighbors don't think the same way that we do,” Victor replied softly. “Especially the Hunters. From my time with them, I've seen firsthand how that old anger has never gone away. If it hasn't by now, it probably never will.”

He was most likely right, as usual. The Neighbors aren't exactly known for having a high propensity for forgiveness. For the most part, they don't consider lesser beings like humans worthy of such consideration. We're the spider in their house, and they'd rather crush us than carry us outside. 

But then again, Briar didn't have to pick the night of Samhain to repay his debt to Orion. He also didn't have to warn the Dead Duo about the Wild Hunt’s intent to destroy the barn. And Iolo didn't have to permit him to do either of those things. It would've been so easy for either of them to simply let their hunting buddies have their way after the debt was fulfilled. 

That had to count for something, right?

“At the risk of sounding naïve, maybe it's just because no one's tried it.” I told Victor.

He was well aware that I was most likely going to try it anyway, so all he did was warn me, “Don't get your hopes up.” 

I assured him I wouldn't, then left for the skull trees. Wouldn't want to be late for that. 

When I arrived, I found the mechanic sitting crossed-legged in the grass, a large black cat curled up in his lap. A Maine Coon? The cat had a little patch of white on its chest, making the sizable animal look like it was wearing a fancy suit. He scratched the cat's chin, its purrs audible from across the clearing, eyes closed contentedly. 

“How's your new employee?” He asked with a smile. 

Of course he knew already. I furrowed my brow, not trusting how nonchalant he was being about the situation. Deirdre still hadn't cut her ties to the river. We were waiting to see how he responded to this news first. 

“She's great.” I replied cautiously. “I think she'll do really well.”

The cat in his lap, eyes still shut, rubbed against his hand, indicating that he wasn't allowed to cease petting it for even a moment. The mechanic obliged by moving on to scratch it between the ears. 

With a light-hearted chuckle, he questioned, “So, what brilliant loophole do y'all think you found with that one? I'm dyin’ to hear it!”

Once again, it appeared this was just fun for him. That made me wonder if I should even bother trying what I'd been considering. 

Yes. I had to. While Iolo and I have a lot of bad blood, he's also the Hunter I know the most about. And as much as we apparently mutually resent his interest in me, it's definitely there. If you really squint your eyes and tilt your head at an angle, that could be considered a form of rapport, right? 

I answered his question uneasily, “You can't take Orion employees' souls. And I know we specified *all* employees, regardless of humanity and when they were hired.”

“That's true,” He conceded with a smirk. “But that's operatin’ on the assumption she'll have one.”

That caught me off guard. I blinked like an idiot. “But… she'll be human.”

“Lil’ fun fact for ya, Fiona: we don't have souls. When you die, ya go somewhere. When we die, we're gone. *Caoineadh's* already died once. What makes ya so sure she'll have one?”

“Because she had a premonition of you ripping it out.” I informed him flatly. 

“Huh. Well, that answers that question!” He said with a small laugh that made me reconsider what I'd discussed with Vic prior. 

The idea of him butchering her like that… I wish I could say I had the energy to be sickened. But for him, that was just par for the course. You cross him or those like him, you suffer and that was that. Simple, brutal justice, by their standards. 

I sat down in front of him on the ground, not shy about meeting his gaze as I prepared myself to talk competitively, “There's something else you're not considering.”

The cat gave him the airplane ears when he stopped stroking its head as he leaned forward, “And that is?”

The cat's eyes finally opened. They glowed orange, like a jack o'lantern’s. Not a cat, after all. 

The Not Cat turned its head and mewed at Iolo, clearly unhappy with the lack of attention. Without taking his eyes off of me, he went back to stroking its chin. 

My polite argument was, “By helping us, she helped you. She gave us hagstones to wield against the Cookie Hag. You know as well as I do that without them, we would've been screwed.”

His eyebrows rose, “Do we also owe Remington for makin' that shotgun y'all brought? Or Morton for makin’ the salt you used? Hell, maybe we even owe the river she got the stones from. Gettin’ a bit too indirect there, Fiona.”

Unfortunately, he had a point. 

Even so, I had more to say, “If you would've taken my soul like you wanted to, you would’ve had to deal with the hag alone. And you might've lost far more than just your wings.”

With one hand still on the Not Cat, he used the other to prop his chin up, elbow resting on his knee as he gave me a withering glare that rivaled Victor's, “You're *really* reachin’ with these.”

“Yet, you can't tell me I'm wrong.” I argued, still keeping my voice even. “So instead of going back and forth like this all night, trying to out-think each other, only to end up resenting each other even more than we already do, why don't we discuss something more productive?”

“And that is?”

“We can break this cycle we're all stuck in. Or at the very least, start the process.”

He laughed humorlessly, that annoyed expression deepening, “What bullshit are you tryin’ to pull now, Fiona?”

Even the Not Cat seemed curious to hear what I was about to say, its orange eyes bright in the darkening forest. 

“We all keep going back and forth,” I explained, not letting the derision in his tone or the Not Cat's judgmental look deter me. “One side does something, the other retaliates, and so on. It never ends.”

“Oh, here we go.” He said with a sigh. 

Forcing myself to keep my cool as best as I could, I urged him, “Please let me finish.”

“I already know what you're gettin’ at.” He sounded tired. “Let bygones be bygones. Turn the other cheek. Forgive and forget. Heard the exact same spiel when we were forced under the Mounds.”

There it was. That bitterness. 

“Think about it, mechanic.” I tried, using my ‘difficult customer’ voice on him. “Why did you join the Wild Hunt? I know you weren't born into it like how Briar and the Houndmaster were. You used to be a guard for Caer Sidi, right?”

He continued to stare daggers at me, “Why else? Hunt's the only organization that ain't cowerin’ in the Mounds and lickin’ the boots pressin’ into their necks.”

This was clearly a sensitive topic. I had to be careful. 

“It shouldn't have happened. The way the Neighbors were treated was horrible.” I lamented, letting some of what I'd been holding in come through. “I know that probably sounds empty coming from a descendant of the same people responsible for it, but I promise you, I mean it. That's why I do what I do. I *want* things to get better. You're just as much a part of this world as we are. Instead, it seems like things just keep getting worse, no matter how much I try to fix them.”

A muscle in his jaw feathered, “Maybe it’s not supposed to get better. That ever cross your mind?”

Not wanting this to turn into a fight, I continued as if he hadn't spoken, determined to say my piece, “We've been going at it for almost a year now, and the way things have been, it seems like it'll never end. But in that time, we've also worked together. With the White Stag. The False Tree's animals. The Cookie Hag. And between the boss and me, you keep trying to collect Orion employees, so you must not hate us as much as you say you do.”

That last statement managed to get a small snort out of him. The Not Cat's tail also whipped in bemusement. It gave me the assurance to keep going. 

“To top it off, you agreed to keep teaching me how to use a sword, which seems to benefit me much more than it does you. Again, I know the significance of being named. Some of your power has been stripped from you. But at the same time, if I hadn't bound you, we never would've gotten here. You could be dead right now, mechanic. So could Briar and the Houndmaster.”

His expression was grave again. However, in a shocking turn of events, he wasn't arguing with me or mocking me. I wasn't sure what that meant, so I gave the end of my thesis.

“At this point, Orion and your faction of the Wild Hunt are intertwined, probably indefinitely. It doesn't have to keep being a bad thing.”

He sat up, letting both hands drop to his knees. The Not Cat had apparently gotten its fill, standing up with a stretch before languidly wandering off to sit on the ground nearby, tail curled around its paws. 

When Iolo finally spoke, it was hard to discern what he could've been feeling by his tone, “You can't *really* think it's that easy, Fiona.”

No trace of his usual smile. The intensity in his gaze made maintaining eye contact difficult, but I managed to. 

“I don't,” I admitted. “It's not going to be any easier for me. Do I have to go down the list of all the grudges I have against you?”

“That's exactly what I mean.” He said curtly. “You can't bury the hatchet anymore than I can.”

“I stepped in front of you, didn't I?” I reminded him softly. 

He had nothing to say to that. 

Briar’s voice came from nowhere, “Looks like I'm interrupting something.”

I whirled around, seeing that the Hunter had appeared at the edge of the clearing, not in uniform for once. 

*What is he doing here?*

The mechanic greeted him with a smile, “Nah, you're just in time. You remember what we discussed earlier?”

Briar smirked in a way that made me nervous, “Sure do, sir.”

“Forget it. Tell ya later.”

Briar's left eyebrow rose, but he nodded, telling the mechanic that he understood. The mechanic winked at him. For whatever reason, that prompted Briar to glance briefly at me with a small, mischievous smile before he knelt beside the Not Cat to *pspsps* at it. 

*What's that about?*

The Not Cat walked away, apparently not as keen on the other Huntsman's affection as it had been the mechanic's. Briar shrugged, then straightened back up. 

Iolo's attention was back on me as he announced, “No promises.”

“What does that mean?” I demanded skeptically. 

“Exactly what it sounds like, Fiona. I'll give it a shot, but I ain't promisin’ shit. I expect the same from you and yours, includin’ that keening woman.”

Even though it was close enough to what I'd wanted to hear (sort of), something didn't feel right. They were both acting weird. And I definitely didn't trust that ‘no promises’ bit. 

Eyes flitting between them both, I felt emboldened enough to question Iolo, “If I ask you what's going on, will you tell me?” 

He removed a four-leaf clover from the front pocket of his flannel, holding it out for me to take without uttering a word. A clear ‘no.’

When the veil was pulled away, I saw the damage Wes did to his prosthetic wings. Along with that, I saw the damage the prosthetics were doing to Iolo.

*Jesus…*  

Alarmed, I tore my gaze away from the raw, striated flesh, telling him without thinking, “You shouldn't be pushing yourself like this!” 

He scoffed, “You sound like Briar.”

“Well, maybe you should listen to him.” I retorted. 

Briar chimed in, sounding relieved that someone else had acknowledged the mechanic's condition, “*Yes.* Listen to me.” 

Nowadays, I'm pretty used to Iolo's true appearance; his teeth don't unnerve me nearly as much as they used to. Of course, I probably would be singing a different tune if I'd witnessed him using them to tear Wes’ throat out. 

The mechanic cheerfully informed me, “Oh, don't you worry! That is exactly why Briar here is gonna be takin’ over, since the Houndmaster's outta town. I'm just here to spectate. Make sure he doesn't kill ya. Hope ya don't mind none.”

It dawned on me then that he wanted me to fight *Briar.* The Hunter that can summon thorns at will. Thorns that siphon the blood from your body upon contact. He couldn't be serious! No. He *was* being serious. 

On that note, I'd forgotten how much more imposing Briar was behind his disguise. The thorns woven throughout his antlers and across his face somehow looked sharper than the last time I saw them. I'd only ever seen him use the hooks on his wings to hang on the church ceiling, but I didn't doubt that they would be deadly to deal with. 

The thorned Hunter didn't have a sword in hand. Not promising. 

“You hope I don't mind if he kills me, or if you spectate?” I snapped. 

Briar cheekily replied, “Yes!” 

Iolo raised a hand at him, saying dismissively, “Aw, he's just fuckin’ with ya. Told him to go easy on ya.”

That was not reassuring. ‘Going easy’ for the Wild Hunt simply meant that you'd have more of a chance of surviving long enough to get to a hospital than usual. 

“Oh, don't tell me you're scared, Dog of Orion.” Briar remarked with a dark laugh. “‘Course, now you don't have a gun or a hagstone to hide behind like you did in the temple.”

“Yet, you have all those thorns to hide behind.” I retorted, reaching for Ratcatcher. 

“*Hoo!*” The mechanic seemed far too entertained by this as he stood up, finding a place to rest off to the side so he could watch, arms crossed over his chest. "You gonna take that shit from a human, Briar?”

“All I'll need is one.” Was the only warning Briar gave before those leathery wings flexed, bringing him by my side, that forked tongue flicking out at me menacingly. 

*God,* he's a creepy bitch. 

There was more movement in the corner of my eye. Ratcatcher’s blade let out a heavy *clang* as it blocked a vine the diameter of my forearm, the force of the vines’ lash rivaling that of the Dullahan's whip. I then had to yank the sword back as the thorns attempted to wrap around it. At the same time, I ducked away as Briar sought to drive the hook of his wing into my shoulder. 

This was going to be difficult. The thorned vine moved like a serpent through the air, while at the same time, I had to avoid Briar as he alternated between trying to grab me and trying to skewer me with those wings. As much as being quite literally pinned by those hooks made me quiver, I was afraid to find out what would happen if he got his hands on me.

“Stop runnin’ from him.” The mechanic advised from the side. “Look at where you are, Fiona. That where you wanna be?”

After ducking away from the thorns again, I spared a glance at my surroundings, realizing that Iolo was right. Briar was driving me into a thick cluster of trees, intending to corner me. 

Almost tripping over the vine as it tried to weave around my ankles, I flailed past my opponent, taking a slash at him to force him to keep his distance. He let the sword swipe past him. I had to dodge his hooks once again, but at least I managed to avoid that trap. 

“Good,” The mechanic praised as I struggled to keep my feet under me after Briar smacked me on the back with the leather of his wing. “Now, I keep seein’ you retreat. He ain't nearly as big an’ scary as he thinks he is. Don't be fluffin’ his ego. Lord knows it don't need to get any bigger.”

*You're one to talk!*

Without breaking eye contact with me, Briar took a second to raise two fingers in a V shape at Iolo, earning a snicker from his superior.  

The vine kept trying to circle around behind me, raising up to the height of my waist. It made me nervous. It wasn't being used as a whip anymore. It hit me that Briar was either trying to herd me closer to him, or coil it around me. Either way, I had to get out of the semi-circle it had formed. 

Briar spread his wings wide, completing the shape. *Shit.* 

“You heard him,” He warned with a tilt of his head. “No more running.”

*Alright. Have it your way, fucker.*

I resisted the urge to rush at him, keeping Ratcatcher at the ready by my side, still acutely aware of the thorns behind me. Were they closer? They definitely seemed closer. 

Instinct kicked in. I dropped to the ground. The thorns swirled around where I'd just been standing. I rolled towards Briar just as they drove themselves downward in a drilling motion, tearing up the earth beneath them.

I slashed sideways at him again, going for the symbols etched into his midriff, hoping to cross a few of them out. He jumped back. That gave me some clearance to get out of the snare I'd been in. 

Wait. No. It had to be another trick. It was too obvious. He *wanted* me to go there. I stuck with my original plan to gut him, trying another horizontal slash. 

He cackled, moving backwards again, “I thought for sure you'd fall for that!” 

I went for his throat next, thinking that he and Victor should be twinsies. 

The vine fastened around my ankle, roughly yanking me to the ground. With a yelp, I swept Ratcatcher down to chop it, feeling the tips of the thorns poking through the leg of my jeans. Not enough to break the skin, but enough to make me twitch. 

Movement. Above me. Using my free hand, I pushed myself to the side before Briar could get ahold of me. 

“You ain't thinkin’ of doin’ what I think you are, are ya Briar?” Iolo asked, his voice absurdly playful given the circumstances. 

Directing his thorns to coil around both of my legs, Briar responded, “I might've been. If that's alright with you, sir.”

*Oh God, what are they talking about now?*

To my distress, Iolo still sounded bemused as he told him. “Sure. Long as you don't kill her. And don't injure her in a way she can't recover from in a few days. Means no broken bones.”

“You got it.” I understood when Briar looked down at me to oh-so-casually ask, “You aren't afraid of heights, are you?” 

Eyes wide, heart racing, I shouted, “Oh, *don't you fucking dare!*”

I swung Ratcatcher at him as he tried to go for me again, the Hunter openly laughing at my reaction. 

“Oh, and Fiona?” Iolo called, the smile in his voice increasing my nervousness. “If you can keep him from getting you in the air, it might inspire me to stick to what we spoke about before. Keep that in mind!”

*Yinz are a couple of fucking jagoffs.*

In hindsight, I think the mechanic was having Briar push my buttons on purpose. Trying to get me to regret what we’d talked about. Trying to prove that burying the hatchet wasn’t a realistic option for either of us. I could tell by the way he watched us. It was as if he was waiting for something. However, that didn’t occur to me at the moment thanks to the highly stressful prospect of *that fucker dropping me out of the sky.* 

The vine wasn't coming off, keeping my legs bound together tightly. However, holding off the one controlling it was the bigger priority. Where Iolo put more emphasis on outmaneuvering his opponents, Briar appeared to be more focused on cornering his prey. It would be better if he thought I was trapped. 

I pretended to be more concerned with freeing myself from the thorns, lightly setting Ratcatcher against one of the tight coils above my knee. I pulled the sword away just as it wound itself around my non-dominant hand, gritting my teeth as an icy, siphoning sensation began in the palm of my hand. 

To Briar's eyes (wherever they were,) I appeared to be too distraught with pain to think of fighting back anymore. He had the vine drag me closer to him, then reached down. 

*Now!* Using all the strength in my core, I flung myself at him, Ratcatcher’s blade grazing his wing. 

He couldn't fly without it, after all. 

When the iron touched his skin, he hissed inwardly, recoiling from it. He appeared to be more sensitive to iron than Iolo was, a horrible rash erupting on the leathery skin. Afterwards, his hands clenched into fists. 

Not long after, the ground began to shake. 

“Temper, Briar.” Iolo warned him. 

The movement below the earth ceased. Even so, I kept my sword trained on the thorned Hunter as he glowered at me. The sensation of the thorns draining my blood intensified until it became a harsh burn.  

To my relief, the mechanic had him release me, though Briar made a point to ensure that the thorns’ exit from my flesh was as messy as possible, tearing skin, leaving long cuts. It took effort not to flinch. 

If only my blood would give him depression like Deirdre’s did. Or anxiety. I’d be more than happy to share that with him. 

He took in a deep inhale, rolling his neck, bouncing slightly on the balls of his feet. The tension began to drain from his shoulders. He released that breath before telling Iolo, “I'm all good, now.”

The mechanic had slowly begun to pace, “Alright. Go again.”

“Hold on!” I yelled, springing up from the ground. “Do the same conditions apply?”

Seeming annoyed that I had the audacity to bring it up, Iolo flatly asked his colleague if he could still fly. Briar begrudgingly admitted that it wouldn’t be a good idea.

“Well, there ya go,” Iolo said brusquely. “Now, go again. And Fiona? That skittishness I just saw is fuckin’ embarrassing for us both. Don’t let it happen again.”

He didn’t have to tell me twice. We went a few more rounds. My review of training with Briar? I *really* missed the Houndmaster. Fingers crossed that she’ll be back soon.

Thankfully, my feet remained on the ground the whole time. Mostly. Briar did pummel me a bit, though I was more scratched than bruised. It may sound odd, but I think I prefer the bruises. At least they don’t itch as much afterwards.

Eventually, the mechanic got sick of looking for something that he apparently wasn’t finding. He let us quit for the night, dismissing his right-hand Hunter. 

Wanting to try to get some clarity on the situation, I swiftly discarded the four-leaf clover, the reason being that it’s easier to read the Hunters’ expressions when they’re pretending to be human. At least, in Iolo’s case it is. 

What I saw after the veil was back up was that Iolo looked mildly aggrieved to have Briar fussing over his injuries again. However, he sat still and let the other Hunter examine him, the two speaking in Gaelic. 

Before he departed, Briar came dangerously close to complimenting me: “You aren’t quite as terrible as I expected you to be.”

I bit back a rude comment. One that he absolutely deserved.

Once he left us alone, I tried to get the mechanic to give me a straight answer. I bet yinz can guess how well that went.

“So?” I prodded him.

He side-eyed me. “So what?” 

“You know what I’m asking about. Are you willing to do what we discussed or not?”

He raised his eyebrows, “You still want to after all that? Guess you were serious.”

I fought the urge to roll my eyes, “Of course I was.” 

Annoyingly enough, his answer hadn’t changed, “Like I said, no promises. But I’ll give it a good ol’ college try.”

“What would it take to make it a promise?” I questioned.

“This is the best you’re gonna get from me.” He replied impatiently. “After these past few months, you should be grateful I’m even givin’ you that much. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve been told that I need to get some rest.”

That was the end of that conversation. 

In some ways, my discussion with the mechanic went better than expected. In other ways, it was far less than ideal. On one hand, he’d considered my words without trying to trap me into a Faustian bargain. On the other hand, that meant that he wasn’t bound to anything. This was all entirely on a whim. ‘I’ll try’ doesn’t mean much coming from a creature like him.

And that little moment Iolo had with Briar before handing me the clover made me uneasy as well. The *hell* was that about? 

I also can’t help but think of what Deirdre said in her entry: *Old things like him know how to wait.*

In summary, nothing is certain at the moment, and it’s driving me up the wall. Naturally, I plan to tell my coworkers about this tomorrow. All I know is that I can always trust Iolo to be [untrustworthy](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/s/zAphx9pb3O).
