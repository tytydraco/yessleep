One child, that was our plan. *One*. We could juggle a single ankle biter with our careers no sweat.

But then at the ultrasound, the cheery technician clapped her hands together, smiled, and said, “I’ve got some exciting news!”

Fast-forward a few months, and our dear friend Mr. Stork dropped off Darren, Deborah, and Daniel…

In that first year, my wife and I probably got a solid 20 minutes of shut-eye. Combined. Friends and family noted we’d become like the walking dead, sleepwalking through 3AM feeds, naps, and even bath time. It got so bad, Alison joked about stapling her eyes open.

The impact spilled over into our professional lives, too. I’d wake up at my office desk only to find the keyboard soaked in warm drool, whereas Alison nearly walked into an operating theatre with poop smeared across her forehead.

Good thing the nurse who noticed took pity on the stressed mother and promised to keep her mouth closed, otherwise Alison might have sown it shut for her.

You won't be surprised to learn our romantic lives took a hit. However, there was light at the end of the tunnel. Surely, once our offspring got past the dreaded ‘terrible twos’, parenthood would become more manageable?

Wrong. It got worse.

Darren never quit kicking Deborah, who wouldn’t stop tugging Daniel’s hair, who…well, I can’t really fault Daniel. He was a great kid.

Maybe you’re thinking I didn’t love my children, that’s not true—I *adored* them. Darren would have me laughing so hard my ribs hurt with the little comedy shows he put on for me and the stuffed animals; Deborah could tell you the difference between the Triassic period and the Cretaceous Period with the aid of her dinosaur models; and Daniel had those big blue eyes everybody fawned over.

Together, they were just hard work is all.

My stomach did a somersault when my dearly beloved first made her suggestion.

“You want to get rid of them?” I asked, struggling to pry Deborah’s fist open so she’d release Daniel’s hair.

“Think of it more like…downsizing. We’d just find a new family for one of them.” Her eyes flicked down toward Darren, who she held by the arms as he twisted like a fish to try kicking his sister from across the room. “Or maybe two.”

It shouldn’t have surprised me, honestly. That cold, detached nature is what made her such an incredible surgeon; she operated with complete ice in the veins, 100% focused on any given task.

After separating the rowing pups, we wrangled everybody into bed and went down to the kitchen, sweaty and exhausted.

“Well we have to do something,” Alice snapped, already going at the wine. “Three kids are way too much trouble. We need to make this situation more…manageable.”

In the end, the discussion got sent back to the jury, unvoted on, until I returned home from my work trip.

Alice’s proposal played on my mind the whole way to London and back. How could she even make such an awful suggestion? As much as I complained about the triplets, I sorely missed them whenever we were apart. I missed the way they shared their biscuits and juice with me anytime I worked from home, or how all three of them fell asleep with their heads against my chest when I read them a bedtime story, and the way I needed to slither out from beneath them without waking anybody.

Back home, when the front door swung open, my gut immediately told me something was off. The silence sent shivers racing along my spine. Our Volvo sat parked in the driveway, yet the house wasn’t a war zone, why? I hurried along the hall, shouting everybody’s names.

In the lounge, my wife’s surgical gown hung from the mantelpiece, along with discarded latex gloves caked in dried, crusty blood.

Huddled together on the sofa were the kids, all watching Paw Patrol peacefully. They weren’t wrestling over the remote or knocking over side tables.

Darren sat closest to me, *not* kicking his sister. Had we turned a corner? Had the kids finally, finally, finally grown out of this ‘fighting’ phase?

I almost cried tears of joy until my brain cogs ground to life, slowly processing the *real* reason for this little armistice...

My son’s legs were gone. Beneath his shorts, two chicken drumsticks poked through, ending well above where the knees should have been.

A huge lump formed in my throat as my eye travelled towards Deborah, whose arms had gone AWOL, replaced instead with pink, rounded pencil erasers poking out of her sleeves. The room seemed to shift on its axis as I finally looked at Daniel, who licked a lollipop quite happily. 

“Want some daddy?” he asked, holding it out towards me.

Alice stepped through the door, wiping her hands off with a damp rag. And then, I could only stand there, paralysed by fear, as she proudly explained the ingenious way she’d found of [making our children more ‘manageable’...](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)
