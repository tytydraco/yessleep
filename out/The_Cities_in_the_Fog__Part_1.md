(Note: I’ve added how much time has passed between entries in brackets at the end of each date. I've also changed or omitted names where needed. My father would kill me if he knew I posted this.)

**Wednesday 2nd Feb**   
Rhi told me to start a diary to help process the grief. She’s been looking out for me ever since Elaine left. And since I refuse to see a shrink, I’m writing this diary.

I tell everyone I don't feel sad. Truth is, I feel nothing. First Imogen. Then Elaine a few months later. I feel like a man walking in a constant fog. Like the television screen in my head is just stuck on static.  
The dreams feel more real than my waking hours. I'm in a city. I think it's a city. There are doors and windows and streets. All round like the place had been made by giant worms. Everything is made of raw concrete. The piping and wiring that run across the curved walls are naked. Here and there, the steel framework in the concrete is exposed. 

And there’s fog here too. Real fog. Do you call a fog in dreams real? In the fog there is a crowd made up of all kinds of people. Old faces, young faces. Male, female. Black, white. 

They all have the same expression though. A looking look on their faces. I'm looking too. I'm looking for them. I know, with that kind of knowing you only get in dreams, they're trapped somewhere down deep in the bowels of this city. And as I pass through an archway or enter a subway, I wake up to another grey dawn of my hollow life. 

Which one is the real city?

  
  
**Wednesday 9th Feb** *(7 days)*  
I'm not very good at this daily diary thing. But I really need to process this.

We got a call today from an apartment building downtown. Someone said they found a hand sticking out of a wall. When I heard it, I thought they meant there was a hole in the wall and someone's arm was sticking out. But it was literally a hand sticking out of the wall. When I saw it, I swore it must be a joke. A rubber hand some kid superglued to the wall. But it felt real enough for us to call in the fire brigade to break through the plaster, thinking we’d find a body in the wall. The wall space was empty. Just flat board on the other side.

The hand was strongly attached to the wall. So instead, we cut the plaster around it, then sent it to forensics. It was a hand alright. Bones and all, ending abruptly and fused to the plaster.

Found one of the lab guys in the stairwell later. He was having a full on breakdown. He had puked down the stairs and was hyperventilating bad. Thought his eyes would roll out of his head. When I asked him what was going on, he just kept repeating, “There was a pulse. You got to believe me. There was a pulse. There was a goddamn pulse.” We called an ambulance and had him taken to hospital. 

I spoke with Chang to see if he knew what happened to his buddy, but he said other than it being a hand impossibly stuck to a wall with no owner, he hadn't found anything else unusual. Female, probably in their forties, of Indian ethnicity. Fingerprints didn’t ping any database. Chang did admit he only managed to inspect the hand a couple of hours after his colleague did. Said it was oddly difficult to ascertain time of death.

It's sick, but I admit, it’s the first day I've felt anything resembling alive in the last three months.

  
  
**Friday 11th February** *(2 days)*   
Last two nights my dream city has been frantic. But I can't remember why. I wake up at three or four, sweating and heart pounding. I recollect fragments of images. The sides of a building protruding out with some sort of fleshy mass. People marching down the subways knowing they'll be digested by the tunnels. But they go down anyway because that's where their loved ones are waiting.

No more news about the hand in the wall. Hope I sleep better tonight.

  
  
**Saturday 12th February** *(1 day)*  
Crazy shit today. Some guy put twenty pens through his arms and was walking around shouting “Free hugs!” at people. Found drugs on him of course. At least I think it was drugs. Bright blue crystals.

Lined up at a coffee shop later. Woman in front of me had dark short hair. For a moment, I swore it was Elaine. But then she turned around and it wasn't. I recognized her though. And I swore she recognized me. But I can't remember where I’d seen her before. She gave me a small smile as she passed by. We didn’t say anything to one another.

It’s been very foggy after that.

  
  
**Sunday 13th February** *(1 day)*  
I woke up in my kitchen today. 

I was wandering that city again, still looking for Imogen and Elaine. I sat down somewhere to rest. The dark skies began to lighten. I remember thinking, I had never seen the sun in this city before. But as I watched, the sky turned into my kitchen window. And then it was a foggy grey morning. And I was fully dressed sitting at the table. Soles of my shoes were wet.

Have I been sleepwalking out of the apartment?

When I told Rhi, she told me I really needed to see a shrink. Maybe she’s right.  
  


**Tuesday 15th February** *(2 days)*  
There is a tip of a shoe sticking out from a building round the corner in a back alley.

At first I thought it was a mushroom or a leaf caught against the wall. But something about it made me look again. It was the tip of a brown cloth shoe coming out the brick wall. I even gave it a good kick just to check it was stuck there firmly.

It was still there when I got home in the evening. I almost wanted to laugh. I don't know what to do about it. Should I make the effort to find out who manages the building? But I  don't want to know if there are any toes in it.  
  


**Friday 11th March** *(24 days)*  
It was paperwork hell this month.

That new drug is really spreading. Chang says they don’t know what it is. Told me it’s some kind of synthetic protein. Costly and difficult to produce. You can’t just make it in your backyard with supermarket supplies. Hopefully that means finding out who and where they make this thing should be easier. 

In the meantime we’ve been picking kids on it off the street, and it's gotten itself a name: The Dream Roulette. Apparently you never know what's going to happen when you take it. Most seem to just have a kind of outer body experience. Floating amongst the stars is how the kids describe it. But sometimes you get an intense high. And that’s the lure.

Some person started a social media channel about the spiritual insights he got when high. Kid’s gone viral. Manifestation and law of attraction stuff. Not my thing.

Another guy we found in a constant state of orgasm. Didn’t actually know having an erection for hours was a medical emergency. We called the paramedics when he started spurting blood.

Then there's the others. I don't think I should write about those. They make me think of Imogen and Elaine. And then I feel the fog seeping in.

In more cheerful news, I made a friend. Well, sort of. I met him while I was dreaming a few days back. 

I think I was getting close to them. Like really close. I was descending a spiral staircase made of iron down a concrete tube. It reminded me of my apartment stairwell. At the bottom of the spiral stairs, there was a long tunnel with a faint light at the end. I know they were just at the other end of the tunnel. But I also knew the tunnel was dangerous. I was going to have to run through.

Just before I did, someone called me. I've never heard a voice in the city before. So I turned and there he was at the bottom of the spiral stairs, staring at me. I don't remember any of his features, only that his eyes glowed red. I smelled cigarette smoke and then I woke up, fully dressed, in the goddamn foyer of my apartment. I could still smell cigarette smoke.

The uneasy thought I’ve had is that where the tunnel was in my dream, there was simply a wall when I woke. If I had charged into the tunnel, would I have smacked my head against the wall and woken up?   
My rational side demands that's the case. But my creative side? I think that man saved me.  
  


**Friday 1st April** *(21 days)*  
I’m a happy guy, living in the suburbs with my wife and daughter, and 10 million dollars in the bank. Happy April Fool's. Imogen loved playing pranks… Daddy misses you.  
  


**Friday 27th May**  *(56 days)*  
Today we found ten little fingers poking out of someone’s fridge door.  
  


**Tuesday 31st May**  *(1 day)*  
I swear I must be remembering something wrong. I’m writing this down here just in case I need to come back and check my sanity.

Alright, there’s been this stain in the stairwell. It’s a pretty big stain, about four feet high and two across. There are a lot of other dark patches on the concrete but I’ve never liked this particular one. It has always felt like a shadow without an owner. But I really, really don’t like it now. I swear I remember that patch being on the second floor landing. I swear. But today I took the stairs and I’ve realized it’s on the third.

I must be remembering it wrong. I must be. This must be the stupidest reason for anyone to ever make an appointment with a psych.  
  


**Friday 3rd June**  *(3 days)*  
I think I'm going insane. First the goddamn stain in the stairwell. Now, I think I met my friend in the dream in real life. I can't be sure. But I can't shake the feeling.

Here’s how I remember the conversation:

I was eating dinner at the pub. It’s been a shit two months of scraping dreamers off the street. Kids have been daring each other to take it at parties. Five of them held hands and jumped off a two story building. One of them lived. That made me so angry. I just kept thinking about how hard Elaine and I tried to keep Imogen alive. For these kids to just do this kind of thing.

I’ve tried to keep the anger alive to be honest. It’s better than the fog.

Anyway, I’m eating dinner at the pub, trying to make myself feel better with grease, salt, and alcohol. He slides into the chair opposite me smooth as anything. I looked up and was about to tell him to buzz off, I’m not interested. But then I catch the red glint in his eye that stopped me. He was Japanese. Young, pointy features. Twenties? Thirties? Messy hair, sports jacket, and he was smoking. That smell. It couldn't be. Right?

He pointed at me with the cigarette. “You have a problem. I can help,” he said with a Japanese accent.  
The officer came out in me, and I tried to play it cool. “Everyone's got problems. What's your game, son?”

“Bad drug on the streets. You don't know where it's made. You don't know who's selling. I can help.”

What he said was true. We have no clue how the Dream Roulette is being manufactured and spread. We'd caught some small time peddlers. But they couldn't lead us up the chain. It wasn't any of the major gangs. Chang said the drug was some kind of synthetic protein that needed large labs and things. But we couldn't find a damn thing. The crystal pills appeared out of thin air and was sold by a literal army of invisible ghosts.

“Maybe you can help me. But what’s in it for you?”

“Educational purposes,” he replied, smiling like a wolf. “I want you to interview people when they are still under the effects. Record those interviews. Let me listen to them. The voices of the mad.”

“Strange thing to ask for. Still. Not sure I can do that for you, son. Lots of rules around recording people these days. What’re you offering?”

“The next six months of the supply. Date. Time. Location.”

“You don’t say. How do I know I can trust you?”

He only kept smiling. It’s like the bastard knew I trusted him. Why do I trust him? Because he reminds me of some phantom who saved me in a dream?

“God, help me. I’ll see what I can do,” I sighed in reply and looked down at my dinner gone cold. His face was still smiling, but I could tell it stopped being a true smile when I mentioned the word 'God'. It’s my thing to tell if someone is really smiling. Something about the eyes.

“Good. You’ll need to show them this before you interview them. I need recordings. Not transcripts. Every intonation is important to me. Remember.” He slipped me a piece of paper with a strange symbol on it. A triangle intersected by an eye with three tentacles around it

I looked up to ask when I would see him again but he was gone.
