“Incola, come forth into our world and take control of the vessel we have prepared for you. Sedecim Nonaginta-Septem.”

The mannequin was *gone*. The ritual had *worked*.

Here’s[ part one](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kbkvlz/the_inhabitant_ritual/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) if you haven’t read it.

 

10:38.

We both stood there in the living room. The only thought on my mind was the fact that neither of us moved this thing.

“Hey, dude. Do you hear that?”

I looked at Wade.

“H—hear what?”

Just then, a flurry of creaks sounded above us. It was on the second floor. Okay, it’s on the second floor which means we’re still an okay distance away from it.

Wade looked at me.

“That. Did you hear that?”

“Yeah. It worked.”

We tried to figure out our next move. It was upstairs, and in the room above us, so we had a bit of time to think of something to do. Our thoughts were shattered by rapid footsteps going away from the room above us.

And then the footsteps sounded on the stairs.

I grabbed Wade and we left the living room.

“There’s a closet under the stairs. I think we can hide in there.”

“Alright, man. You know the house better than I do.”

We both managed to squeeze inside the closet just as the mannequin reached the base of the stairs. We both held our breath.

*Clomp… creak… scrape…*

“*Hahhh… hahhh*.”

It’s right outside the door. Holy shit. H—how is it talking? Never mind that, we need to focus on not being found. I looked up from the floor and saw something that nearly made me scream.

It was the bloodied head of the mannequin.

I saw the arm move through the slits of the closet door. I continued to hold my breath, but it was getting increasingly difficult to do so. Just before it could open the door, a sound rang out from the basement.

It turned; it’s attention now diverted to whatever may have made the sound in the basement. I think it was the pipes. Regardless, it left us and went into the basement.

After about five minutes or so, Wade and I came to the conclusion that it was probably safe to leave the closet. We did just that.

He turned to me.

“Holy fucking shit dude. Th—that was, oh my god!”

“Yeah man, I don’t think we should have done this, do you remember the phrase to end the game?”

“Sorry, no. I did have it written on a piece of paper, though. I think it’s in your room.”

*Downstairs, in the basement.* God dammit.

“Okay, okay.” I said, thinking. “If that thing just went into the basement, and my room is in the basement, then that means— “

We both spoke at the same time.

“We need to go in the basement.”

10:53

I could tell Wade felt the exact same way I did as soon as the words came out of our mouths. We would either have to maneuver and avoid this thing, or we would have to wait until it left the basement.

“Okay, Wade. What do you want to do? I’ve got a couple ideas.”

“I don’t know man, sorry, I’m trying to think of something.”

“Okay. The way I see it, we have two options; either we outrun and avoid it entirely while down there, or we wait until it leaves the basement.”

“I don’t like the sound of either.”

“Nor do I, but I think we’re out of options.”

“Okay. I say we wait it out, that work for you?”

“I think it’s going to have to. But we shouldn’t hide in the closet. It nearly got us.”

“Upstairs then?”

And the plan was made. We both took our shoes and socks off. We didn’t want to make any noise while walking and we sure as hell didn’t want to risk slipping on the glossy hardwood floors of my home.

We turned the corner and made our way up the stairs.

“The bathroom.” I whispered.

I turned the handle, and we snuck in. I whipped back around and locked it. We turned the lights on and relaxed. Even if it was temporary, it was still lovely.

I wanted to try and break the tension, so I spoke to Wade.

“So, uh, what would you have done tonight if we hadn’t tried this?”

He perked up and looked at me.

“Hmm. Well, I did have a HELLA hot date planned, but I had to cancel it to give you a fighting chance with me.”

I chuckled and lightly punched his arm.

“Fuck off, dude. You don’t have any hot dates. You don’t have to lie to me just to feel good about yourself.”

He laughed and rubbed his arm.

“Well, I’d say the situation calls for at least a LITTLE bit of humor. Wouldn’t you agr— “

*Black*. *Completely. Pitch. Black.*

The lights went out. This must have been what the flashlights were for. I turned my light on, and Wade followed.

“Okay,” I said, getting up, “this isn’t the worst possible outcome.”

Wade looked at me with wide, questioning eyes.

“Wha—what do you mean it isn’t the worst outcome?”

“It’s still in the basement.”

He looked down, then back up at me.

“Okay, what now then?”

I looked down at the floor before unlocking the bathroom door and looking back at Wade, urging him to come with me.

We made our way back down the stairs, still hearing the mannequin in the basement shuffling around. I carefully opened the door.

It did not creak.

“Okay, you ready?” I asked, looking at Wade.

“As much as I can be, I guess.”

“Okay.”

I put my weight on the first step.

Nothing.

I continued. By the time I was halfway down the stairs, I could hear it lot more clearly. The mannequin was in the boiler room. My room is next to it.

As my feet made contact with the cold basement floor, I turned my flashlight off. Wade made his way down next to me, and I urged him to do the same.

“I know my way around down here, even if it’s dark.” I whispered.

“Alright, you need me to do anything?”

“Just stand guard.”

“Gotcha.”

I tiptoed over to my room, the door of which was open. I went in and turned my light on.

There, in the middle of the bed, was the paper with the phrase on it. I rushed over and grabbed it.

At the same time that I grabbed it, I heard a crash from the other room. It was the unmistakable sound of somebody barging through the door.

And then, I heard Wade *scream*.

“Shit.” I said under my breath.

I rushed out and illuminated the basement with my light.

It got Wade. He wasn’t dead, though. Instead, that thing was *dragging* him by his feet up the basement stairs.

“JOSH!” I turned around quickly. Wade had one final thing to say to me.

As he said it, I felt a rock drop into my stomach, and I nearly collapsed to the ground.

“I—I just remembered that I—”

As the words left his mouth, a whole new wave of fear came over me.

“I left the paper with the phrase in my car.”

It dragged him out of sight, and I slumped to the ground.

It’s now 11:15. 45 minutes left. I don’t know if Wade is still alive, but I have to be sure that he is.

I can’t say for certain what’s going to happen next, but I’ll be sure to update you guys if something does.
