I was still in high school when I started doing deliveries.

Not the fun kind where you hand someone a pizza and they tip you five bucks because you made it before the commercials ended. I worked for a local courier company that handled “last mile” stuff the big carriers didn’t want to deal with—small medical shipments, legal envelopes, and the occasional “signature required” box that somebody paid extra to keep out of a warehouse.

It was a lot of driving, a lot of dead phone batteries, and a lot of pretending I wasn’t nervous knocking on strangers’ doors at night.

My boss liked to say, “You’re not a kid, you’re a professional.”

Which was easy for him to say, sitting behind a desk with a coffee, while I was the one walking up dark porches and listening to dogs throw themselves at doors.

That night started normal. Too normal.

I clocked in after school, grabbed the van keys, scanned my route sheet, and loaded the last few packages off the metal rack in the back. The warehouse smelled like tape and cardboard and exhaust. Someone’s radio was playing softly in the office. Everything was routine.

Then the office lady called me over.

She didn’t say my name—just crooked a finger like she didn’t want to talk in front of anyone.

“Last stop,” she said, handing me a clipboard. “Signature required. Do not leave unattended.”

I looked at the address and my stomach did that little drop it does when something feels off before you can explain why.

It wasn’t the street name. It was the lack of everything else.

No unit. No gate code. No notes. Just an address and a blank space where “delivery instructions” usually lived.

“Where is this?” I asked.

She shrugged. “Out by the lake. Past the old logging road. GPS should take you.”

“Why would someone need a courier for a cabin?” I asked, half-joking.

She didn’t laugh. “Just deliver it. Get the signature. Come back.”

The box itself was plain. Medium size. Heavy for its size, but not crazy. No branding. No “fragile.” Nothing that screamed “hazmat” or “medical.” Just a printed label with the same address and a weird little sticker in the corner that said:

RECORDED DELIVERY — DO NOT DEVIATE

I’d never seen that sticker before.

I scanned it. My handheld beeped once, then again, like it lagged. The screen flashed CONFIRMED and then, for a fraction of a second, IN PROCESS like it was thinking.

Then it went back to normal.

I told myself it was just the scanner being old.

I drove out as the sun dropped behind the trees. The van’s headlights carved tunnels through the road, and my playlist kept skipping like the Bluetooth connection was annoyed.

The closer I got, the worse the route became.

Paved road turned into cracked asphalt, then into gravel, then into a dirt track with puddles that reflected my headlights like flat black mirrors.

There were no other cars.

No mailboxes.

No streetlights.

The kind of place where the trees lean toward you like they’re trying to listen.

My GPS tried, at first. It gave confident little instructions in its cheerful voice.

Then, about ten minutes down the logging road, it stopped showing street names and started showing nothing but a blue dot floating in green.

Continue for 4.2 miles.

No turns. No landmarks.

Just “continue.”

I muttered to myself, “This is stupid,” and kept going anyway because that’s what you do when you’re young and trying to prove you’re not scared.

Around mile three, my phone lost service completely.

Not one bar. Not even that sad “SOS” thing.

I didn’t like that, but it wasn’t impossible. A lot of the area was dead zones.

What I didn’t like was the quiet.

The longer I drove, the less I heard.

No distant traffic. No occasional airplane. Not even those random nighttime bird calls that usually make you jump.

It wasn’t silent. It was… held.

Like the woods were waiting.

Then, finally, headlights hit a shape ahead.

A cabin.

Not a nice rental cabin. Not a cozy porch-and-windchimes cabin.

A square, old-looking cabin with weathered wood and one porch light that buzzed like a trapped insect. It sat back from the track behind a line of trees, like it didn’t want to be seen.

And it was far from the road.

Not “long driveway” far.

“Why would anyone do this to themselves” far.

I parked where the dirt widened enough to fit the van and killed the engine. The sudden quiet made my ears ring.

I sat there for a second, looking at the cabin.

No lights in the windows. Just the porch bulb.

No movement.

I grabbed the box and the clipboard, and I walked up the path.

The ground was uneven. Roots under dirt, loose stones. The air had that lake smell—wet and cold and metallic—but the lake itself wasn’t visible.

Halfway up, I had the thought: If I trip and break my ankle out here, no one finds me until morning.

I laughed under my breath because it sounded dramatic.

Then I reached the porch.

The front door was open.

Not cracked.

Open open.

Like somebody forgot.

The porch light buzzed and flickered, and every time it flickered, the inside of the cabin changed shape in the doorway shadow. A chair. A wall. A hallway.

“Hello?” I called, trying to sound normal.

No answer.

I shifted the box in my arms and stepped closer.

Right inside the door, taped to the wall at eye level, there was a piece of cardboard with thick black marker writing.

DELIVERY KID — I’M IN THE BASEMENT. COME DOWN.

Below that, in smaller letters:

DON’T LEAVE IT UPSTAIRS. SIGNATURE REQUIRED, RIGHT?

My throat went dry.

That was a weird amount of attitude for a sign.

I stood there for a second debating, because every part of my brain was telling me: Absolutely not.

But I also had a policy drilled into me by a boss who loved rules more than people: signature required means signature required. And the handheld scanner logs every attempt—if you mark “customer unavailable” and bail, the office sees it, you get grilled, and you don’t get trusted with the good routes anymore. It’s dumb, but when you’re trying to keep a job, dumb rules start feeling like laws.

So I did the stupid thing.

I stepped inside.

The cabin smelled stale, like cold wood and old smoke. The floorboards creaked under my shoes like the building was clearing its throat.

There was a narrow hallway to the right. A living room to the left with furniture covered in sheets. The air was colder inside than outside.

At the end of the hallway was a basement door.

Half-open.

Dark beyond.

And taped to the door, another sign:

YES, THIS IS THE BASEMENT. YES, IT’S WEIRD. KEEP GOING.

A sarcastic laugh bubbled up in my chest, the kind you do when you’re nervous and don’t want to admit it.

“Okay,” I muttered. “Okay. Quick in and out. Signature and done.”

I pushed the basement door open the rest of the way.

Cold air spilled up the stairs like a sigh.

The steps creaked under my weight as I went down. I kept one hand on the railing. The other arm hugged the box tight to my chest like it could protect me.

At the bottom, there was a concrete floor and a single fluorescent light that buzzed. The light was the kind that makes everything look sick.

A corridor stretched ahead.

Not a typical basement with storage shelves and a furnace.

A corridor.

Long, straight, narrow, like someone had carved a hallway out of a basement and didn’t want you to think too hard about it.

And on both sides of that corridor…

Pictures.

Dozens of pictures.

All of me.

My face went hot.

I took a step forward without meaning to, like I could walk closer and prove it wasn’t real.

The first photo was me in my uniform hoodie, standing by the van door at the warehouse. Taken from across the lot.

The next was me at a gas station earlier that day, leaning against the counter with an energy drink. My face turned slightly like I’d felt someone watching.

The next was me at school.

Outside.

By the bike rack.

That one made my stomach flip because the angle was higher—like from a second story window.

More pictures ran down the corridor, taped in a neat line like an exhibit.

Me laughing with my friend in the cafeteria.

Me leaving my house.

Me in my room, looking down at my phone.

That one should’ve been impossible.

There was no window that angle could’ve come from.

My knees went weak.

I whispered, “What the hell…”

A speaker clicked overhead.

Not loud. Not dramatic. Just a clean little click like a microphone turning on.

Then a voice came through, bored and flat, like the person speaking was staring at their nails.

“Hey.”

I spun, looking up toward the ceiling.

“Who’s there?” I said, and my voice cracked on the last word.

“Relax,” the voice said. “I’m not going to hurt you. Yet.”

He sounded like an adult, but not old. Maybe late twenties, early thirties. The kind of voice that has learned to sound calm on purpose.

“You shouldn’t be down here,” I said.

A pause.

Then, like he was reading from a script: “You were invited.”

“I was told you were in the basement,” I said, holding the box tighter. “I need a signature and I’m leaving.”

“Signature,” he repeated, like the word amused him. “Sure. We can do that.”

I took another step into the corridor, because apparently I hate myself.

The pictures continued down the hallway, and some of them had little sticky notes under them.

ON TIME.

ALWAYS SMILING.

THINKS HE’S A GOOD GUY.

LIAR.

The last one made my face burn.

“Why do you have pictures of me?” I said.

The voice sighed. “Because I’m thorough. And because you’re predictable.”

“Where are you?” I asked.

“Further down,” he said, still bored. “Keep walking.”

I didn’t.

My feet stayed planted at the threshold of that hallway like they knew better.

“I’m not walking down there,” I said. “Just come up here.”

The voice clicked his tongue like I’d disappointed him. “You came all the way out here, kid. Don’t get shy now.”

Something in my chest twisted.

“Look,” I said, forcing my voice steady, “I don’t know what this is. But if you don’t come sign, I’m taking the package back.”

Another pause.

Then, softer: “No, you’re not.”

And the basement door at the top of the stairs shut.

Not slammed.

Closed.

A second later, I heard a crisp metallic sound.

A latch.

A deadbolt.

My blood went cold.

I ran up the stairs and yanked on the basement door.

It didn’t move.

It didn’t rattle.

It felt like it had been welded into the frame.

I backed down two steps, breathing hard, heart hammering.

“You locked it,” I said.

“Good observation,” the voice said. “Now we can talk without you doing your little runner thing.”

I swallowed. “Open it.”

“After,” he said.

“After what?”

The fluorescent light buzzed louder for a second, like it heard my question and liked it.

Then the voice, still bored, said: “After you tell the truth.”

My skin prickled.

“What truth.”

He sighed again. “You know exactly what I’m talking about.”

“I don’t,” I lied automatically.

He made a soft sound through the speaker that could’ve been a laugh if he had believe in laughter.

“See?” he said. “That. Right there. That reflex.”

My mouth went dry. “Who are you.”

“Someone who’s tired of people pretending,” he said. “And someone who’s tired of you pretending you didn’t cheat on your ex.”

The words hit me like a slap.

I froze.

Because it wasn’t just the accusation.

It was the way he said it. Like he’d been waiting to say it for a while. Like it was the whole point.

My face heated. My brain raced. “That’s none of your business.”

The voice hummed, unimpressed. “It was her business.”

I gripped the box so hard the cardboard creaked. “How do you even—”

“You want to know the scary part?” he interrupted. “It’s not hard. People tell on themselves all the time. You’re glued to that phone like it’s a pacemaker.”

I stared down the corridor again.

The photos felt heavier now. Less like surveillance, more like evidence.

“I’m leaving,” I said, and it came out shaky because I knew I couldn’t.

“Sure,” he said. “Right after the truth.”

My throat tightened. “I’m not talking to you about that.”

A beat.

Then, like he was reading another line off a checklist: “Okay. Then we’ll do it the hard way.”

A vent on the wall behind me clicked.

Air pushed through it, cold and sharp, smelling faintly like damp earth and something chemical.

The basement light flickered.

My heart started to sprint.

“Stop,” I said.

“Walk down the hall,” he said. “There’s a chair. Sit. We’ll have a nice little chat, you’ll sign, I’ll sign, and you’ll go home.”

“I’m not—”

The voice cut in, suddenly less bored. “You are.”

And something bumped the corridor wall.

Not the vent. Not the pipe.

The wall.

Like someone on the other side had leaned into it.

My body froze in place. My brain tried to picture the layout of the cabin and failed. There shouldn’t be anything on the other side of that corridor. It was underground. It was foundation. It was dirt.

The bump happened again, farther down the hall.

Then again.

Closer.

A slow, measured approach.

The voice went back to bored. “I’d take the chair if I were you.”

I swallowed and forced my legs to move.

Every step into that corridor felt like agreeing to something I couldn’t undo.

The pictures were closer now. The sticky notes under them felt like they were aimed right at my skin.

Halfway down, I saw a photo I didn’t remember existing.

Me in my room, months ago, lying on my bed with my phone held above my face. My ex’s name visible at the top of the screen. My thumb hovering over a message I never sent.

Under that photo, a sticky note read:

“I’M SORRY” WOULD’VE BEEN EASY.

My eyes stung.

I kept walking because the hallway behind me felt like it had teeth.

At the end of the corridor was a small room. Just a chair bolted to the floor and a folding table with a pen on it. Above the chair, a small camera was mounted, its little red light on.

It felt like being backstage at something awful.

I stopped at the chair.

The voice came through clearer now, like the speaker in this room worked better.

“Sit.”

I didn’t sit.

“What is this?” I whispered.

“A conversation,” he said. “The kind you avoid.”

I looked around. No windows. No other doors. Just the corridor behind me.

“I’m not confessing to you,” I said. “You’re insane.”

“Maybe,” he said, bored again. “Sit anyway.”

I didn’t move.

A pause.

Then, quietly, from the hallway behind me, came a sound.

A shuffle.

A bare foot on concrete.

My skin went cold.

The voice said, almost pleasantly, “You’re not alone down there.”

I turned slowly.

At the far end of the corridor, in the fluorescent buzz, someone stood in the half-shadow.

A man.

Tallish. Hoodie. Hands in his pockets like he was waiting for a bus.

I couldn’t see his face clearly because the light kept flickering, but I could see that he was real. Not a voice. Not a trick.

He took one step forward.

Then another.

The voice said, “He doesn’t like liars.”

My heart slammed into my ribs.

“Stop,” I called toward the man, voice cracking. “I’m a kid. I’m just delivering a package.”

The man didn’t respond. He just kept walking, slow and calm, like he wasn’t in a hurry because he didn’t have to be.

The voice sighed. “We’re wasting time.”

I backed into the room, palms up. “Open the door. Let me go.”

The voice said, “Sit. Talk.”

The man reached the middle of the corridor and stopped.

He tilted his head slightly, like he was listening to something only he could hear.

Then he smiled.

It was small, and it didn’t belong on a human face.

He took his hands out of his pockets.

In one hand, he held a utility knife.

Not a big dramatic blade. A box cutter. The kind you could buy at any hardware store.

My stomach flipped.

“Okay,” I said fast. “Okay. Fine. Fine.”

The voice perked up, a little. “See? That wasn’t hard.”

I stumbled into the chair and sat because sitting felt like the only thing keeping my legs from collapsing.

The man stopped at the doorway of the small room, leaning against the frame like he was guarding it.

The voice came through like a teacher taking attendance.

“Tell me why you did it.”

I swallowed. “Did what.”

A bored pause. “Cheated.”

My throat tightened. My face burned. “I don’t… I don’t want to talk about that.”

The voice said, “Too bad.”

I stared at the table. The pen. The camera. My hands.

My brain tried to think of a lie that would get me out, but every lie felt like it would make things worse.

I whispered, “I messed up.”

“That’s not an answer,” the voice said. “That’s a bumper sticker.”

The man shifted slightly in the doorway. The utility knife caught the light.

My mouth went dry.

“I liked the attention,” I said, voice quiet. “I didn’t think it would… become real. It was texting. It was stupid. I thought I could stop it before it mattered.”

The voice hummed. “And your ex?”

I swallowed hard. “She found out.”

“How,” he asked.

I flinched because the word was sharp. “I—I left my phone open. She saw it.”

“And what did you do,” the voice asked, still bored.

I felt my eyes sting. “I denied it.”

The voice made a satisfied sound. “Of course you did.”

I squeezed my eyes shut. “I didn’t want to be the bad guy.”

“You already were,” he said, and the boredom slipped for just a second into something colder. “You just didn’t want anyone to see you.”

I opened my eyes and stared at the corridor because tears felt unsafe in front of strangers.

The voice said, “Now say her name.”

My chest tightened. “No.”

The bored tone returned immediately. “Say it.”

I shook my head. “No.”

The room seemed to quiet around that word.

The man in the doorway stopped leaning. He straightened, slow.

The voice sighed. “Okay. We’re doing the other thing.”

“What other thing?” I asked, panic rising.

The man took one step into the room.

I scrambled back in the chair, but it was bolted. The chair didn’t move. My shoes squeaked on concrete uselessly.

“Stop,” I said. “Stop—please—”

The man moved fast then.

He grabbed the front of my hoodie and yanked me forward. His grip was iron. He smelled like cold sweat and damp fabric.

I tried to shove him away.

He slammed me down against the chair back.

The pain shot through my spine like electricity.

Then the box cutter flashed.

I felt a hot sting across my forearm, just below the elbow.

Not deep enough to… to do something fatal.

Deep enough to hurt. Deep enough to bleed immediately.

I gasped and tried to pull away, but his hand pinned my wrist to the arm of the chair.

The voice, still bored, said: “Consequences. Remember those?”

I stared at the blood running down my arm in bright lines. My vision swam.

The man leaned close, his face finally visible in the flicker.

His eyes were open wide, too wide, like he hadn’t blinked in a long time.

He didn’t speak.

He didn’t need to.

The voice said, “Say her name.”

My throat worked without sound.

The man pressed the blade lightly against my skin again, not cutting, just reminding.

I choked out her name.

The second it left my mouth, the man stopped moving.

Like a switch flipped.

He released my wrist and stepped back, breathing through his nose.

The voice sounded… satisfied.

“Good,” he said. “Now we’re being honest.”

I clutched my bleeding arm to my chest, shaking.

The voice continued like it was casual. “Tell me what you said when she cried.”

My eyes widened. “What—”

“You remember,” he said. “You remember exactly.”

My stomach rolled because I did.

I swallowed and forced it out. “I told her she was being dramatic.”

The man in the doorway twitched like he didn’t like that one.

The voice chuckled softly, humorless. “Classic.”

My breathing came fast and shallow.

“Okay,” I whispered. “Okay, I’m telling you. I’m telling you what you want. Just—just let me go.”

The voice said, “Sign first.”

I blinked. “What.”

“The package,” he said like I was slow. “Signature required.”

I stared at the box still tucked under my arm like an idiot. I’d carried it down here the whole time.

I fumbled it onto the table with my good hand. The cardboard smeared with a little blood.

The clipboard was there too, which I hadn’t noticed until now—set neatly on the table like it had been waiting.

There was a line already filled in under “recipient.” A scribble of a signature I didn’t recognize.

And a blank line under “courier.”

My name wasn’t on it. Just “Courier.”

My hand shook as I picked up the pen.

The voice said, “Sign.”

I stared at the line.

This was insane. None of this made sense. Signing felt like agreeing that it did.

But my arm was bleeding and the man with the blade was still in the doorway.

So I signed.

Just my first name. My usual scribble.

The second my pen lifted, the basement door upstairs unlocked with a crisp click.

I heard it through the ceiling like a distant gunshot.

The voice said, “See? Easy.”

My eyes darted to the corridor.

The man stepped aside like he was granting permission.

I didn’t wait for a second invitation.

I bolted out of the room, down the corridor, slipping slightly on my own blood where it had dripped. The photos blurred past me—my face, my life, my mistakes taped to concrete like trophies.

The corridor wall bumped once as I ran, like something on the other side moved in excitement.

I hit the basement stairs and took them three at a time. My injured arm burned with each jolt. My lungs felt too small.

At the top, the basement door was open a crack now.

I shoved it hard and stumbled into the cabin.

The front door was still open.

The night air hit my face like freedom.

I sprinted off the porch, down the path, toward the van, keys rattling in my pocket like teeth.

I got to the driver’s door and yanked it open.

I climbed in, slammed it shut, and locked it out of pure instinct.

My hands shook so badly I noted, stupidly, that I was getting blood on the steering wheel.

I jammed the key into the ignition.

The van started on the first turn.

Headlights flared across the cabin.

And in that bright cone, I saw something that made my stomach drop straight through the floor.

A new sign taped to the inside of the open front door.

Fresh cardboard.

Fresh marker.

It read:

GOOD TALK. DRIVE SAFE. DON’T CHEAT AGAIN.

And beneath that, smaller, like a little afterthought:

CHECK YOUR MIRROR.

My breath hitched.

I looked up at the rearview mirror.

At first, all I saw was the darkness of the road behind me.

Then a shape moved.

Someone was sitting up in the back of the van.

Not where passengers sit.

In the cargo area.

A silhouette behind the metal mesh partition, head tilted like it was curious.

My heart stopped.

I slammed the van into reverse without thinking.

The tires kicked gravel.

The van lurched backward and bounced, hard, like I hit something.

The silhouette in the mirror jolted with it.

I heard a thud behind me, then a low, irritated sound—almost a laugh.

I threw it into drive and floored it.

The van fishtailed on the dirt, caught traction, and tore down the logging road, branches whipping the sides like hands trying to grab on.

I didn’t breathe until I hit a wider stretch and dared to look in the mirror again.

The cargo area was empty.

No silhouette.

No movement.

Just my packages shifting slightly with the turns.

I kept driving anyway. Faster than I should have. My arm soaked my sleeve. My vision kept blurring at the edges when I blinked.

When I finally got back into cell service range, my phone buzzed like it had been holding its breath.

A notification popped up on my lock screen.

Unknown Number: You did great.

Then another.

A photo attachment.

I didn’t open it while I drove. I refused. I didn’t want to see anything else.

I pulled into the first brightly lit gas station I found and stumbled inside, clutching my arm, trying to look normal, trying to look like a kid who fell off a bike.

The cashier asked if I was okay. I nodded. I bought paper towels. I wrapped my arm until the bleeding slowed.

In the bathroom mirror, my face looked pale and wrong. Like I’d aged a year in an hour.

Back in the van, with the lights buzzing overhead and the smell of hot coffee in the air, I finally opened the photo.

It was a picture of me.

Sitting in my van at the gas station.

Taken from outside the driver’s side window.

My head turned slightly, like I’d sensed it.

And in the reflection of the glass, behind me, you could see a faint shape in the cargo area.

Just a hint of a face.

Just a hint of eyes.

Under the photo, typed in plain text, was a single line:

Honesty looks good on you. Keep it.
