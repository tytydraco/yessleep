I woke up to darkness surrounding me, gasping for air. Small droplets of sweat trickled down my forehead.

The room was fine. A bit too quiet, but fine. I grabbed my phone, 3:03 AM.

"Same damn time," I said. I had been having the same dream for 6 days now.

Well, not exactly the same. It started with a faint light in the corner of my room. Surrounded by darkness, it looked like a pair. I didn’t notice it at first, but then they just opened. Glowing brighter. Looking more like eyes.

The next day, they were closer. The next day, even closer. By the third day I could make out the outline of who the eyes belonged to. Just a black mass, a shadow. Somehow darker than the darkness surrounding it. But the same glowing white eyes. Not blinking, not moving, just staring.

By the fifth day it started resembling something that looked like a woman. The hair, the face. Everything still a shade of darkness. But the same white eyes. Staring. Closer every time.

Today they were closer than ever, sitting beside me. Same eyes. I could make out more of the features. The waves in the hair, the lips. Still not saying anything. Just... staring.

This apartment had been nothing but weird since I moved in. I mean, I didn’t see ghosts or anything. It was just... too quiet. And it didn’t help that I was all alone in it. It was just close to work. I put the phone down, gulped some water, and went back to sleep.

I woke up at 7. I had to get ready to go to work. And I did just that. But before leaving, in the sunlight, I noticed a dark spot on my bed where she would’ve been sitting.

"That’s weird," I muttered.

My mother called at work, saying I should come over after work. That we’re having some guests.

I walked into our house, my mother greeted me with a hug. Uncle Sam had come to visit along with his wife and 5 kids. The TV in the living room was playing some news about a blood moon lunar eclipse. It was supposed to be tonight.

After dinner I went back to my old room. Mother said two of the kids would be sleeping in my room, they were insisting they wanted to see the blood moon.

I opened my laptop to check the blood moon timing. The pictures were magnificent.

"Eclipse," I said. The thought of the shadow lady crossed my mind. "Shadow lady, glowing white eyes, 3:03 AM." I typed it into the search engine.

There were a bunch of links, people asking what it was. How it got closer. 3:03 AM in every post. Some called it Blood Moon Lady.

"Oh shoot," I said. I forgot to remove the blood moon before typing in the shadow lady search.

I clicked on one of the links: "Blood Moon Shadow Lady, do not look at her, do not notice her."

"Oops, look at her I did," I said. The post read:

Do not notice her. If you see her, she will see you. She will know. She comes for those who live alone. I have researched it. It always starts 6 nights before the blood moon. A faint light at first, then eyes, then face. Closer every time. On the night of the blood moon, she will take you.

"What the fu—" I damn near cursed. The post continued:

Go somewhere, if you live alone. Anywhere. If she finds you sleeping alone for 7 nights straight, she’ll take you. 3:03 AM.

I looked at the kids sitting in my bed.

"DO NOT SLEEP ALONE."
