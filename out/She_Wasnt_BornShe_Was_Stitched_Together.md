Listen, this isn’t some edgy creepypasta or a late-night horror wank. I’m not here to spook you. I’m here because I don’t know what’s real anymore, and if I don’t get this out, the last shred of truth I’ve got will rot in my skull. So, here it is, unfiltered. Judge me if you want. I don’t give a shit anymore.


It started on a piss-wet Thursday. Rain hammering the courtyard of my family’s crumbling hotel empire. She was there—barefoot, soaked to the bone, tits clinging to a thin dress like a second skin, staring at this chipped-ass statue of some saint like it was whispering dirty secrets. I thought she was a junkie or a runaway hooker. I, Nathaniel, asked if she was okay. She turned, tilted her head like a doll with a loose neck, and hit me with this:
“Do you think God hears the prayers of bitches sewn together from spare parts?”


I laughed. Figured she was tripping balls. But fuck, she was gorgeous—too gorgeous, like someone carved her out of marble and forgot to sand down the edges. Eyes too big, lips too full, a body that screamed sin but moved like it didn’t know what a cock was. She said her name was Lilith. No last name. No phone. No nothing.


I gave her a suite. Don’t ask why—maybe I wanted to fuck her, maybe I felt sorry for her. She didn’t beg, just asked for a hot bath and “quiet.” That night, I found her in the tub, fully dressed, water sloshing over her thighs, whispering “Eva… Eva… Eva…” like a prayer or a curse. Her fingers trailed the surface, slow, like she was jerking off a ghost. I got hard watching her. Didn’t say shit.


Next few days were a mindfuck. She didn’t know how to work a microwave but could quote Nietzsche while stroking my arm with those cold, curious hands. She’d stare at a candle flame like it was licking her clit, then giggle when I’d light another. Watched a lizard crawl up the wall and sobbed—full-on ugly crying—then fucked me senseless on the couch during a movie funeral scene, laughing as she came. She wasn’t acting. I’ve banged enough liars to know. She was… broken. A slutty, shattered doll with no manual.


No memory of where she came from either. Just Lilith, naked and raw, unraveling in my bed.


Then the truth—or some jagged piece of it—crashed in. This posh British prick, Dr. Lionel Avery, showed up. Old, smelled like antiseptic and money, suit so sharp it could cut glass. Said he was her doctor. Said Lilith “escaped” his care. Said she was “sick.” But his eyes? Hungry. Like he owned her pussy and her soul. I didn’t tell him shit.
That night, Lilith spilled it, legs tangled in my sheets, sweat still drying on her skin. She’d been brain-dead at 16—car wreck, flatline, gone. Pretty enough to salvage, though. Avery, that sick fuck, grafted chunks of a dead prodigy’s brain into her skull. Experimental, illegal, some Frankenstein-level shit. The donor? Eva Mikhailovna. Russian. Genius. Cold as ice. IQ through the roof but mute after 10. A girl they called “inhuman.”


Lilith said she hears Eva sometimes—whispers in her head, memories of drowning in a tub, burning pages, a voice begging behind her own eyes. She’d wake up from nightmares, clawing at her scalp, then ride me like she was exorcising it. Said Eva’s cunt felt different—tighter, crueler.


Then she started changing. One minute, she’s Lilith—playful, sucking my fingers, asking what stars taste like. Next, she’s blank. A machine. Told me once, mid-blowjob, how she could lace my whiskey with ricin and watch me choke, no trace. Then grinned, finished me off, and licked her lips. She’d draw shit—symbols, maps, rooms she’d never seen. One was a sealed-off floor of the hotel. A bathroom. The exact spot where my cousin Eva drowned when we were kids.


Yeah. Eva. Same fucking name.
I, Nathaniel, never told Lilith about her. Never mentioned the tub, the screams, the way I didn’t pull her out in time. But Lilith sketched it—every tile, every crack—like she’d fucked the memory into existence.


I dug deeper. Old records, dusty files. Found out Avery worked at some coastal lab years back—place for “unwanted genius kids.” Eva Mikhailovna was there. Not just a patient—an experiment. Consciousness transfer, memory mapping, some sci-fi wet dream. She didn’t die naturally. They killed her for parts. And Avery kept going, stitching Lilith together from Eva’s leftovers and a corpse that wouldn’t quit.


Confronted him when he came sniffing again. He just smirked, said, “She was never meant to be whole,” like she was his personal sex doll with a bonus brain. I wanted to smash his teeth in.


Then Lilith bolted. Left a note: “I need to know who I am when no one’s screaming in my head.” Haven’t seen her since.


Now I dream of Eva—my Eva—naked in that tub, water red, whispering why I let her die. Sometimes it’s Lilith’s voice. Sometimes I wake up hard, sometimes crying.
I loved her, you know. Lilith. Eva. Whoever the fuck she was. Maybe she came back to punish me. Maybe she came back to fuck me into oblivion.


Or maybe… she’s not the only one they stitched together.
