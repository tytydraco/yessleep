I should have known something was wrong with the place the moment the landlord refused to show it himself.  But I figured, hey, it’s a cheap studio you can rent by the month, so he probably just doesn’t want to waste his time entertaining every John or Adam that breezes through.  So, I let my uneasiness slide, signed for the place via email, and told him I’d be by to pick up the keys in the morning, and to this he agreed.

I stopped by the office and walked into a cramped box of a room that smelled faintly of mildew and cigarette smoke, probably leeching from the sickly yellow walls stained from years of neglect.  A buzzing fluorescent light flickered overhead, casting a jittery, unnatural glow across the chipped laminate counter piled high with outdated brochures curling at the edges.  There was no one in sight, so I had to ring the tarnished bell resting on the counter.  It was sticky to the touch.  I heard shuffling coming from behind a door marked “PRIVATE”, indicating that the man I was supposed to be meeting to pick up my keys was indeed there.  It took several minutes of waiting and staring at the dusty, plastic plant in the corner, its leaves faded to a strange bluish green, before the landlord faced me.

He was an old, wiry thing – all sharp elbows and knobbly joints jutting out from beneath an oversized flannel shirt missing several buttons and thrown over a grease-stained thermal.  He was twitchy, too – his eyes shifting in a nervous tic and a mouth that was working constantly like he was chewing on invisible words.  I smelled mothballs and dirt, which mingled with the lingering nicotine smell, making for a rather unpleasant combination that I could taste with every inhale.  With an unpredictable jerk, like a marionette with one too many strings pulled all at once, he tossed a set of keys in my direction and muttered, “Don’t pay no mind to the utility closet,” then turned without another word to re-enter his cave.  

I caught a glimpse of the inside of his office in the seconds it took him to slam the door in my face and noticed a worn armchair with threadbare upholstery sagging beneath the heavy weight of inertia, like nothing has changed here in decades.  A small tube TV played a staticy soap opera with the volume turned low and on the wall above it hung a corkboard cluttered with yellowed notes and lost keys with labeled tags.  And the impressions I was granted in those few moments were the only insights I was given into what my new home would be like.  So, I took this interaction with a grain of salt and trudged up the maintenance stairs that led me to the doorway of apartment 6B.

Upon entering, I noticed the place was bare, but livable.  I wasn’t necessarily in the market for luxury, so this would do just fine.  It was pared down to just the essentials – a bathroom that was barely big enough to allow me to brush my teeth, pee, and shower in separate motions, a kitchenette, with old but still functional appliances and a dented refrigerator that hummed a little too loudly, and small living space that would act as my “bedroom”. The walls were plain and a not-quite-dirty off-white, marked in places with scuffs leftover from tenants past. A single overhead bulb cast a soft, yellow light that left the corners of the room dim and frankly, a little lonesome.  But it was enough for me to haul in a futon, a crate that doubled as a coffee table, and a small secondhand bookshelf that honestly held more empty space than books, but helped me to feel less alone.

It wasn’t until after I got my meager belongings situated and adjusted the crooked window blinds just enough to let in splintered strips of muted afternoon sun that I noticed the utility closet.  It was little more than a dented slab of metal, once painted gray but now mottled with not so few splotchy stains of long-neglected water damage.  At its edges, flakes of paint curled away from the seams as if they were afraid of what lay on the other side.  And through its handle, a heavy-duty padlock smudged with faint, oily fingerprints held it bolted shut.

“This must be what the landlord was talking about,” I said aloud to myself, stepping towards the door to inspect it.  As I approached, I felt a faint draft leak from the crack beneath it, carrying with it the smell of something cool and sour.  I pressed my ear to its surface, the metal an unwelcoming feeling against my cheek.  I held my breath expecting the sounds from my worst nightmares to greet my ears, but instead, nothing.  There was only a slight hiss that was probably nothing more than the air blowing in through the vents.  

“He told me not to pay any mind to it, so I’m not going to.  It’s locked up because it’s a maintenance-only thing I bet.  There’s probably duct entrances and water heater access back there that I don’t need to bother with.”  At least, that’s what I thought until the note arrived.

I had barely been settled into the place for a week when I got it.  It was slipped under my door covertly, with no sign as to who had been its deliverer.  Scrawled in a messy hand on a torn up piece of notebook paper, the message read:

He gets thirsty.  

Once at dawn.  Once at dusk.  

Blue cup only.  

No glass, no metal.  

Don’t speak.  Don’t listen.  Don’t touch.

And sitting, situated just so, on top of my bookshelf was a blue plastic cup.  It looked like the kind you’d find in an old diner or forgotten in the back of a kitchen cabinet, the kind of cup that never seems to disappear, no matter how often you move – lightweight and a little scuffed, its once vivid color dulled by years of use and dishwasher cycles, slightly translucent with a seam running down one side from the molding process – nothing special.  It had a few tiny nicks along its otherwise smooth rim.  Picking it up made me feel oddly nostalgic, like it belonged in a childhood memory.  It was sturdy and unremarkable and utterly terrifying.

How had this gotten into my place?  I understood how a note could be slipped under the door by any passersby, but how could they have gotten *in* here?  

I checked the lock and deadbolt on my front door, and sure enough, all was secure.  And it was after that initial moment of panic that the words on the note settled into my brain.

*He gets thirsty*.

I looked to the water-stained utility closet door and let the thought register that the sound I had tried to convince myself was just air moving through the vents did sound a lot like breathing.  I don’t know if it was stupidity, curiosity, or unearned hubris, but something had me picking that lock.

The padlock thudded on the worn carpet and I slowly cracked the door open.  At first, it looked like nothing more than empty space.  What had I been so afraid of?  Clearly the note was some sort of prank.  Then I noticed the jagged hole punched into the drywall.  A thin layer of drywall dust speckled the floor and creeping patches of black mold spread in irregular, fuzzy blotches  from the open puncture wound in the wall.  I could tell it had started to thrive, blooming silently where water had steeped itself into the porous surface.  This must be where that sour smell had been coming from.  I could feel its stench of decay settling in the back of my throat as I inched closer to the opening.

It led to a hollow crawlspace existing in the space between units, and there, kneeling in the darkness, was a man.  He didn’t react to anything, not the creak of the door nor the slice of light spilling into his dark hollow.  He was resting, perfectly still, with his knees bent at unnatural angles and his spine arched like a question mark.  His skin was stretched thin over his pointed shoulder blades jutting from his back like wings that never grew.  There was something almost fetal in his posture, vulnerable and expectant, but there was still a tight tension being held in his limbs, like a spring wound too tight waiting to release.  

The more I stared, the more I noticed about this thing hunched on the floor.  He looked unfinished, like he had been sculpted from wax and left too close to a fire.  Those thin, long limbs looked like they had been built for crawling, not walking, and every joint seemed hyperextended, like he had been folded up in this tight, dark place for years.  He was hairless – no eyebrows or lashes, even – and his skin glistened, damp with sweat.

I stared in awe-struck horror, unable to move at first.  How long has this man been hiding in the walls?  Is he the one who left the cup, the note?  But how?  The door was padlocked from the outside and there was no other way out of that crawlspace.  Did the landlord know?  Is that why he told me not to mind the closet?  Is that why it’s locked up?

I slowly backed out of the closet, not taking my eyes off of the man-thing, but he never once moved.  He didn’t even look at me.  Should I just…lock the door back up and pretend this was all a horrible nightmare?  I mean, I didn’t have anywhere else to go, and I couldn’t afford to leave to find somewhere new even if I wanted to.  And then my mind returned to the note’s message.

*He gets thirsty*.  *Once at dawn.  Once at dusk.  Blue cup only.*

Dusk was approaching, so I figured it wouldn’t hurt to indulge my curiosity just once.  Then I could figure out what to do.  So, I went to the sink and filled the blue cup up with water and waited.

When dusk arrived, I walked back into the closet and set the cup on the floor, not lingering any longer than I had to.  In seconds, the man’s gaunt, unnatural arm reached through the hole and snatched at the cup.  Every tendon and vein created a map of something once human now turned wrong as his fingers – long, knobby things with nails like cracked glass – moved independently, twitching and feeling for something that he could sense, but not see.  

He drank from the cup greedily, slurping and lapping at the water.  His throat worked in frantic, gulping spasms making each swallow loud and wet, broken only by the sharp, sucking breaths he was taking in through his nose.  The sound was desperate and obscene.

It wasn’t until he had licked up the last drops from the bottom of the cup that he finally turned to look at me.  He moved slowly, like bone grinding on bone, and he blinked once, twice, deliberately and carefully, like he was trying to remember how.  His chest was moving with shallow, erratic breaths and I could smell something meat-sweet and wrong roiling off of him.  He lifted the corners of his small, tight-lipped mouth into some semblance of what I think was meant to be a smile.  The skin of his lips was raw and gnawed, as if he had been chewing on them.  And with a slight, jerky nod of his pale, bald head, he retreated into the dark.

I know technically, I could have left.  Most people in their right minds would have left the second they saw the padlocked door.  But I was broke and stupid and I can’t justify why I continued to provide the man in the wall with water, but it became our own little ritual.  It was like he had become a proxy for everything I had failed at previously.  At least he was predictable.  At least I mattered.  He depended on me twice a day, every day.  And so it continued.

The same note was slipped under my door each day, as if to remind me of the rules.  I filled the blue cup, once at dawn and once at dusk, and he drank.  He never said a word, never moved towards me; we just continued our strange partnership.  Until the morning I slept through dawn.

That was the morning I woke up to a soaked carpet with the blue cup nowhere in sight.  I plodded through my living space, each heavy footstep squelching underneath me with a heavy, reluctant give.  The soggy fibers that had worked their way loose in the treadpath that had been worn from the sink to the closet clung to my shoes like something half-alive.  The damp had seeped deep into the thin padding beneath, spreading outward in dark, irregular stains that spidered across the floor in an unwelcoming web.  

When I reached the closet, sitting in the center of the floor was a red cup.  The red was deep, but uneven.  It had faded in patches where fingers once gripped it, where lips once pressed.  It was made of porcelain that was likely once smooth and glossy, but whose blood-colored glaze was now marred by tiny cracks breaking the surface like frost, with a single chip at the rim, sharp and white, exposing the fragile bone beneath.  And when I picked it up, it was cold to the touch and heavier than it looked, solid in a way that felt deliberate, as though whatever it was meant to hold mattered.

I hurriedly filled it to the brim and shoved it through the hole in the wall and watched as the man’s bowed forearm, which curved ever so slightly in a way it shouldn’t, as if it had been broken before and healed without care, extended to meet me.  I placed the red cup on his outstretched palm and watched him drink, but this time, when he was done, he spoke.

His voice was thin and brittle and carried a dry rasp with it, his throat raw from disuse.  There was a tremble to it – not quite fear, not quite madness, but something jagged and hungry in between.  In a whisper that barely rose above a breath, but which still crawled into my ears, wet and intimate, all the same, he crooned “*Mooooore*”.

I wanted to continue fulfilling my side of our partnership, so I brought him more, cup after cup.  He lapped each one up, working with the same desperation as a thirsty dog dragging its too-swollen tongue over the dregs of an almost-empty bowl, head low, mouth open, greed swallowing grace.  After each cup reached its very last drops, there was not the usual satisfaction, but instead just panting, trembling, and the dawning dread of needing it again.  

When I finally stopped bringing him the water after wearing myself out running back and forth to the kitchen for refills is when the whispering began.  At first, it was just the slightest sound, soft and broken.  His lips barely moved and unintelligible words slipped out in fragments, syllables chewed thin and ragged, strung together in a desperate attempt to escape a mouth lined with dust.  Then the words spilled faster, gaining shape and urgency and rhythm.  

“…it started with thirst…throat like sand…tongue like ash…not even blood left to swallow…”

He leaned closer to the wall, as if confessing to it, but his whispers grew faster and carried, curling through the air like smoke.

“…drank from pipes, from puddles, from rot… from things that should not hold water…”

A shudder ran through him.  His fingers twitched.

“…but it’s never enough. never enough. never ever enough…”

He pressed his face closer to the wall, cracked lips nearly touching it as if he was trying to press his words into the plaster.

“…it drinks through us now. through skin. through sleep. it waits in the wet. it waits in the walls…”

With that, his voice broke into a croak, barely audible now.

“…so thirsty… and we let it in…”

And then he stopped.  His wide, sunken eyes ringed with bruised purple flesh flickered in and out of focus.  All I could hear as he stared was the sound of his dry tongue clumsily scraping over his teeth like sandpaper dragged over wood and the drip-drop of water that I couldn’t find the source of.

I had to get out of there.  I stumbled out of my apartment and ran down the hallway to the maintenance stairs.  I sprinted down them, not knowing if I should find the landlord or, I dunno, call the police or something.  But as I burst forth from what I thought was the exit into the lobby, I found myself standing in the same hallway that housed my apartment.  I tried going down the stairs again and again, but each time I ended up face to face with the bronzed 6B nailed crooked and slightly off-center on my door.  I paced up and down the hallway, knocking on every door I passed.  When no one answered, I started trying doorknobs, hoping I could find any reprieve from the endless loop I had found myself in – and maybe find somewhere where I’d stop hearing that goddamn dripping.  Was it getting louder?

Every apartment door I tried opened and every single one was empty, completely devoid of life.  They all bore the same layout as my own, identical padlocked closet doors and all, and each one was equipped with its very own red cup placed gently, tenderly on the counter.

I’m back in 6B now and the drip has continued slow and methodical.  It’s almost calming, but it doesn’t stop.  It’s gotten louder, heavier.  Each drop lands with a wet slap that echoes far too much for the space I’m in.  The silence between them is shrinking.  I’ve started to anticipate the sound before it comes.

Drip.  Drip.  Drip.

He’s started asking for more again, timing his requests with the rhythmic, fleshy plops resonating through the room.  

Drip.  Drip.  Drip.  More.  More.  More.

I swear I can feel it behind my eyes.

Drip.  Drip.  Drip.

He gets thirsty and I broke the rules.
