I had just drifted into a deep sleep when I started having horrible dreams. Dreams about people dying all around me, burnt in a house fire. That skipped to a dream about war, with missiles being launched into buildings and debris flying everywhere. I knew this wasn’t my dream, something was projecting me to see all of this, so I forced myself awake.

That’s when I felt this dark entity standing on the other side of my closed bedroom door. I could smell it’s decaying rot from the crack under my door. I could feel it’s malevolent darkness, something you could get lost in and never get out of. I could feel his hatred towards me and my bright soul that holds innocent white light.

I could not see him since it was pitch black in my room but I could see in my minds eye his crooked smile and his projection of black smoke power to my legs. It grabbed my right leg, since I was laying on my left side and pulled me almost to the edge of my bed. In a panic I took the white light from my soul and projected it to my hands and blasted it towards my feet, which caused him to let go.

I scrambled back onto the top, middle of my bed and slowed down my heart beat. Thinking of only good things, of only my bright white light surrounding me. Before I could finish this vision, it’s darkness hit me in the chest. I could feel it’s darkness leaking all over my body, trying to take over every portion of my body, mind, and soul. My head got light, my body became tingly, my soul became on fire, and my mind was screaming at it to let me go.

I took all the white light I was manifesting to surround me and sucked it all into my soul, air tight so there was no room for this demon to take it over. I then blasted it to every corner of my mind, extremities, and surroundings like a bomb exploding. To burn him. To make him lose control over me.

All the feeling of him taking over is gone, and I could feel him slither back under my door and into himself, still standing outside my door. I then tell it that it is not welcome here, he needs to leave me and my family alone. I then blessed everything, and person, in the house that I could think of. That way it had nothing to attach too. It started screaming a high pitched squeal, and shaking my door until I finished my list and at the same time my white light enveloped the whole house.

Just like that, he was banished to the hell it came from. It’s not the first time I’ve dealt with his kind. They don’t like the fact that I help lost souls pass over to the other side and can banish it’s kind to the depths of hell it came from. I reached to turn on my Himalayan salt lamps for light, welcoming positive energy into my room. Turned on my TV and turned on Pirates Of The Caribbean, my favorite movie, which lullabied me into sleep.
