Once a humble advertising intern at Verangium Real Estate, I, James Fredrick, found myself climbing the corporate ladder to become the esteemed Advertising Director. However, my ascent came at a cost as I unraveled a haunting truth concealed within the towns we marketed: Greenston, Shapeville, and a handful of others. Verangium had an eerie modus operandi, exclusively owning all houses on a single street—a practice as strange as it was uncommon.

My curiosity piqued when I noticed an advertisement for a house on Cylinder Street in Shapetown, a property I distinctly remembered selling a few months prior. Deeply unsettled, I conducted a search and discovered that the home had been purchased by a man named Todd Wheeler, who had tragically passed away a mere three months after moving in.

Reading through Wheeler's convoluted police report sent shivers down my spine. It revealed an unnerving detail—an abundance of the substance Verangium coursed through his veins, mirroring the company's name. The bizarre circumstances did not end there; Wheeler's lifeless body had a metal cylinder grotesquely affixed to his head.

Intrigued and fearful, I extended my investigation to our two-story property in Greenston. To my horror, the buyer had also succumbed to copious amounts of Verangium in their system. Inside the deceased's dwelling, the walls bore ominous messages, proclaiming the encroaching fog consuming their being and the impending arrival of the enigmatic "fogwatchers." The chilling reality dawned on me—I suspected upper management knew about my inquiries and were determined to thwart my efforts. Just as I delved deeper into the dark secrets, my computer's internet connection abruptly faltered, raising the alarm that they might be closing in on me.

Overwhelmed with dread, I sought guidance, desperate to know my next course of action. The sinister incidents in both Shapetown and Greenston occurred within days of each other, with a prior fatality in Shapetown only a few days earlier. Coincidence or conspiracy? I pondered my options, only to find myself summoned to a meeting with my manager.

Uneasily, I sat before him, oblivious to the approaching danger. He proposed a new job position, titled the Verangium Tester, promising a higher salary and requiring me to reside in the ominous Inn. Accepting the offer, I immediately noticed the eerie paintings adorning the room. One titled "Lord Sphere," another "The God of the Fog," and the final one, chillingly named "Verangium Management," depicted my boss as a grotesque frog-like creature. Realization dawned upon me—my life expectancy grew shorter by the second.

With urgency pulsing through my veins, I yearned to issue a dire warning to the world. If you chance upon an advertisement from Verangium Real Estate in the news, heed my words: Do not purchase a home associated with them. Unearthly forces lurk within their properties, and those who succumb to their allure are doomed to suffer a fate worse than death. Beware the fogwatchers, for they herald an insidious darkness that will consume all who dare to trespass in the realm of Verangium.
