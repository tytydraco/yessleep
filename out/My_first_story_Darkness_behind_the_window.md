Darkness behind the window

Chapter 1: The old house.

I moved into this old house last fall. It is located deep in a small town, away from the hustle and bustle of the big city. The home exudes Victorian beauty with intricate details and large windows overlooking lush gardens. When I first entered the house, I had an unusual feeling of peace but I cannot deny that this place has a mysterious atmosphere.

Everything started off normal, like any new home. I spent time arranging my things, getting used to the new space and starting to love the place. But then, strange things started happening.

Chapter 2: Window

Every morning when I wake up, my bedroom window is wide open even though I closed it very carefully the night before. At first I thought it was just strong winds but this phenomenon continued to happen and I started to feel worried.

I decided to check more closely, locked the window and placed a chair to block it, but in the morning the window was still open. Unease gradually grew in me, but I tried to explain everything with common sense.

Chapter 3: Strange Noises

One night, while I was falling asleep, I heard strange sounds from outside the window. It was a soft sound, like someone whispering, but it wasn't clear. I sat up and tried to listen quietly, but there was nothing other than the sound of the wind blowing through the trees.

I told myself that maybe I was imagining things, but in my malice, I knew what was wrong. The whispers would appear every night, and become clearer and clearer.

Chapter 4: The Dark Shadow Appears

One night, I woke up and felt a comforting blast of cold air throughout the room. I opened my eyes and saw a dark shadow peeking out from behind the window. My heart beat wildly when I realized that it was not the shadow of a tree, but the shape of a person.

That black shadow stood still, just looking right at me. I wanted to scream, but my voice felt stuck in my thin throat. I tried to turn on the light but it wouldn't light up. The shadow slowly moved towards me, and as it approached, I realized it was my reflection, but with empty eyes.

*Chapter 5: Haunted Memories*

I woke up scared and smelly. Everything happened like a dream, but it was too real to deny. The following nights, I started having dreams every time I closed my eyes. The black shadow always appears, standing right outside the window and watching me.

I became anxious and lost sleep. Early in the morning I woke up exhausted, and the fear began to descend every night. Even though I tried to avoid looking out the window, I couldn't suppress the terrifying curiosity.

Chapter 6: Learning About the House's Past

I decided to learn about the history of the house, hoping that this would help me deal with the strange phenomena I was experiencing. After several days of searching, I discovered that this house once belonged to a wealthy family in the 19th century. But the story turned dark when one of their sons, a young man, fell ill. mentally, disappeared secretly in a rainy night.

They said he was photographed by a figure appearing behind his bedroom window. No one knew what happened to him, and no one lived in the house after the family left.

Chapter 7: Facing fear

I realized that I needed to face that darkness to find the truth. One night, I decided to go blank, sat in my room and waited for it to appear. My heart beat fast as I heard familiar whispering noises. And then, as I expected, a shadow appeared behind the window.

I opened the window and looked straight at it, asking what it wanted. The black shadow didn't answer, but I felt an endless pain in its empty eyes. It just stood there, looking at me with the eyes of a story soul.

Chapter 8: The Truth Buried Happily

I began to feel the presence of that shadow more clearly each time. Every night it appears, but this time I'm no longer afraid. I understood that it was not a soul that truly wanted to harm me, but a spirit seeking liberation.

I decided to look for places where the missing son might have gone. After weeks of searching, I discovered a secret apartment in the basement. In that room, I found handwritten letters, telling of the young man's pain, and the grief and darkness behind the window.

He was imprisoned in this room by his own family, and died alone. The black shadow he saw was his reflection, a symbol of sadness, despair and loneliness.

Chapter 9: Liberation

I decided to pray for the boy's soul, hoping that this would help him be freed. The last night, I felt an extraordinary peace. That black shadow appeared one last time, but this time it smiled at me, before disappearing forever.

Chapter 10: Peace Returns

Since that night, I have never seen the shadow or heard the whispers again. The house returned to its original peace, but I never forgot what happened. I know that there are secrets buried in this old house, and we should never awaken them.
