I’ve always had trouble sleeping. It’s not just the tossing and turning; it’s the feeling of something watching me. I know it sounds paranoid, but there are nights when I wake up with my heart pounding, convinced that there’s someone or something in my room. I’d scan the dark, trying to catch a glimpse of whatever was there, but I’d never see anything. Just shadows and silence.

It got so bad that I decided to get a baby monitor. I know, it sounds weird for an adult, but I figured if I could see the whole room from my phone, I’d at least be able to tell myself it was all in my head. I bought a simple one from Amazon, set it up on my dresser, and felt kind of silly for even thinking it would help.

The first few nights, it actually worked. I’d wake up in the middle of the night, check my phone, see the empty room, and breathe a sigh of relief. But then, about a week in, things changed.

It was around 3 AM when I woke up, drenched in sweat. I was half-asleep, still caught in that groggy state where reality blurs with dreams. My phone buzzed, and I saw a notification from the monitor app: *"Motion detected."* I blinked, confused, and opened the app.

The screen was dark, just showing my room bathed in the green glow of night vision. At first, I didn’t see anything unusual, but then I noticed a slight movement in the corner of the screen. It was subtle, like a shadow shifting, and for a moment, I thought maybe it was just a trick of the light. But then I saw it again a figure, just barely visible, standing near the foot of my bed.

I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. I tried to convince myself it was a glitch, but as I watched, the figure started to move, slowly, like it was swaying back and forth. I thought about getting up, turning on the lights, but something kept me glued to the screen. I didn’t want to look away, didn’t want to miss a single second of whatever was happening.

Then, the figure stepped closer, and I saw it wasn’t just a shadow. It was a woman. She was pale, almost translucent, with long, dark hair that hung in tangled strands around her face. Her eyes were wide open, staring directly at the camera, as if she knew I was watching.

I felt my stomach twist. I didn’t recognize her. She didn’t look like anyone I knew, and I had no idea how she could’ve gotten into my apartment. But she was there, standing in my room, swaying like she was caught in a slow, rhythmic dance.

I wanted to scream, to call the police, but I was paralyzed. I just kept watching, hoping she would disappear, that maybe I’d blink and she’d be gone. But she didn’t. Instead, she started moving closer to the camera, her head tilting to one side as she walked, slow and deliberate. The closer she got, the more I realized how wrong she looked. Her limbs were bent at awkward angles, like her joints didn’t work right, and her mouth was twisted into a tight, unnatural smile.

She leaned in so close that her face took up the entire screen, and I could see every detail—the dark circles under her eyes, the thin, cracked lips, and a small cut just below her right eye that oozed a thick, black liquid. I could hear her breathing, shallow and ragged, like she was struggling to suck in air.

I wanted to look away, but I couldn’t. And then, she spoke. Her voice was low, barely more than a whisper, but I heard it clearly. “I see you.”

The screen went black.

I sat there in the dark, clutching my phone, waiting for something to happen. I don’t know how long I stayed like that, but eventually, I got up the courage to turn on the lights. The room was empty. The door was locked. I checked every corner, every closet, every inch of the place, but there was no sign of her. It was like she’d never been there at all. But I knew what I saw.

The next day, I tried to convince myself it was just a nightmare, that maybe I’d imagined the whole thing. But when I checked the app, there was a video saved from the night before. I hesitated, but I opened it, hoping to see nothing but an empty room. Instead, I saw her again, just as before, standing in the corner, staring directly at the camera.

I deleted the app that afternoon. I took down the monitor, shoved it in a drawer, and tried to forget about the whole thing. But the thing is… I kept waking up, still feeling like something was watching me. And I’d hear it sometimes, in the middle of the night. That same shallow, ragged breathing, like someone struggling to breathe.

Last night, it got worse. I woke up at 3 AM, the same time as before, but this time, there was no notification. No buzzing phone. Just the sound of breathing, right next to my ear. I didn’t want to look, but I felt like I had to. So, I turned over, slowly, and there she was.

She was lying next to me, her face inches from mine, with that same twisted smile. I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe, as she whispered, “I see you.”

I don’t know what to do. I’m scared to sleep, scared to close my eyes, because every time I do, I see her standing there, swaying in the corner, just waiting. And I know, one of these nights, she’s not going to disappear when I open my eyes.

She’s going to be right there, lying next to me, smiling.
