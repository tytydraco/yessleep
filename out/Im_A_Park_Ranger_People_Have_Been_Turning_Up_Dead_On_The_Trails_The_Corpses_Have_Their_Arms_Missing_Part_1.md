Sirens blared as flashes of blue and red illuminated the tree-line. A crowd had gathered at the edge of the woods. Amidst the loud commotion, police officers investigated the crime scene. The ground was puddled with blood. Some of it was sprayed on the surrounding trees in eerie patterns.   
A young girl of 11 was the victim.

The cops were carrying the body, now covered in white cloth, to the ambulance. I stood at the front of the crowd, watching the ambulance drive away. The parents of the girl were in hysterics. I looked at the spot where they found her. An officer was observing the ground with a flashlight.     
I was the first to spot the body. That girl’s lifeless corpse is something I’ll never forget. The look of panic was glued to her face. Her eyes were wide open. Her mouth was twisted into an open frown, as if she was screaming for her life. There were lacerations all over her body. The most distinguishing, and horrifying feature, was that both of her arms were ripped clean off their sockets. Blood poured from the exposed wounds. You could see her shoulder joints jutting out.   
This was the first time I’ve witnessed the death of a human being in person. I was deeply disturbed, shaken. The sight of the body was unsettling. But what was more unsettling was the fact that this was the 3rd incident this past month.   
  
Just 10 days ago, 2 hikers went missing on the trail. They had set out at 6 am towards one of   the common trails. The wives of the duo reported them missing after they didn’t show up for 7 hours. A search and rescue team was assembled. I was a part of the volunteers for the first 2 days. They were found on the 3rd day. The day I decided to stay back in my tower. I was given a description by my colleagues, Rob and Martin. Both arms were missing from the corpses.   
  
That seemed to be a common theme for the victims. And today, I got to witness it firsthand.   
I watched the lights of the ambulance fade into the darkness as it drove down the muddy road.   
An officer approached me.   
“I heard you’re the new guy.”, He said as he offered a handshake. “My name is officer Clark. I was told you were the first witness.”   
I nodded, and gave him my statement.   
I was on my routine patrol down this particular trail. The path was right in front of my tower.   
I found the body around 300 meters down the trail. A little girl, lying motionless on the side of the dirt path. Images of the body flashed through my mind.   
"You seem shaken.", officer Clark said as he put his hand on my shoulder. "Don't worry. It's most likely an animal attack. Of course we will be investigating from our side, but I doubt it is anything more than an unfortunate incident." 

  
I looked at the crime scene. The other cops were taking samples and pictures.   
"What kind of animal does that?" Goosebumps crawled out from the depths of my instinctual terror and spread through my bare skin. I felt cold.   
Officer Clark leaned in closer. 

  
"It was an animal attack. You don't have to worry. Leave the formalities to us."   
Behind his reassuring tone, I could feel a sense of firmness.   
He walked away to speak to Rob and Martin. They were park rangers posted in the towers next to mine. As you can tell by now, I'm a fire lookout at this place. It's been a month since I've joined. I stay in tower 20. Rob and Martin stay in the neighboring towers 21 and 22. From day 1, they've helped me get acquainted with my responsibilities, and life as a ranger. At this point, I consider them good friends. 

I watched as they spoke to officer Clark. They spoke for a while. Considering those 2 have been working here for much longer than I had, it was conceivable that they'd have much more useful information to provide the authorities. However, 3 minutes into their conversation, I noticed Rob and Martin started occasionally glancing at me. Their eyes darted back and forth, from officer Clark, to me, and back at him. For some reason, I felt like they were talking about me. 

I couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to this story.   
Stuff I wasn't being told yet. 

  
After they were done, Rob and Martin approached me.   
"Quite a day." Rob said with a sigh.  
He handed me a bottle of water.   
"Did the officer mention anything?", I asked them.   
"No. He didn't say much. They'll most likely declare it as an animal attack." Martin chimed in.  
"Do you really believe that?", I asked.   
"Grizzlies can be pretty aggressive." Rob said, sitting down on a rock. "They've instructed us to stay inside our towers past 8:30 PM. It's best we get going now." 

  
I stared at Rob. I wanted to know more.   
"I know it's been a rough day for you." Martin said as he put his arm around my shoulder.   
"You're probably very disturbed right now. So just try to relax for the night."  
Rob stood up and faced me. "Just stay in your tower after hours ok? Until we get any updates from the authorities."   
  
I began walking up the stairs to my tower.   
The whole situation didn't sit right with me. I've been an avid outdoorsman my entire life. I've been taught about the wilderness, even bears. A bear would not rip the arms off of its prey and leave the rest of the body behind. Especially not 3 times in a row.   
I opened the door to my tower as I thought to myself. This isn't an animal attack. This was a murder.   
  
I just couldn't sleep that night, so I sat at my window, looking at the wide expanse of forest in front of me. A pair of binoculars rested on the table beside the window. I grabbed the binoculars and pointed them westwards, towards the trail that runs in front of my tower, to the very spot I came across the body. Through the foliage, I could see the forest floor. And under the light of the waxing gibbous moon, I could see 3 dark figures prowling the night. 

The first figure led the way. The other 2 were following behind. They were carrying something. A big bag of some sorts. The 3 figures were making their way to the area where the girl's body was found. I wanted to grab my phone and call 911. But I stopped. I looked closely through the binoculars and noticed something. I wasn't quite sure if it was what I thought it was, but I had to know.   
  
I slowly stepped off the stairway of my tower and started crouch-walking along the bushes. I stopped quite some distance away from the crime scene. I was right. There were 3 men, wearing black uniforms. They were cops. I froze in place, not knowing what to think. I looked at the object the 2 men at the back were carrying. It was a body bag. I crouched lower, afraid of being noticed. Suddenly, I heard something heavy fall to the ground. I peered through the leaves. There was an actual corpse lying on the ground. The 3 men were already making their way back down the trail. 

  
 Crouching back behind the bush, I covered my mouth. I heard them walk by towards my right. I sat there for a good 5 minutes, not wanting to be spotted. The crickets chirped around me. A good minute passed, and the light from the moon started to diminish. Clouds began to cover the sky, and I realized that the forest was now dead silent. 

  
I slowly stood up, and looked towards the body. Nothing. There was nothing. Just the empty forest floor. The body was gone. I scoured my surroundings in confusion and paranoia.   
There was a body lying right there on the ground a minute ago. I had seen it.   
The sight of the girl’s corpse filled my mind. 

  
That was enough exploration for tonight. I quickly turned around and started a brisk walk back to my tower. I managed to take maybe 20 steps before I heard footsteps behind me.   
Something was following me. I turned around, and stared at the oak tree 30 feet away.   
I could see the silhouette of a head peering out at me. There was someone hiding behind the tree. I almost screamed. The paranoia of the body bag just disappearing was already getting to me, and now I was being trailed by a person in this dark forest. In my state of confusion and fear, I reached for the flashlight in my pocket. As I fumbled for the switch, I noticed the figure move out from behind the tree and step into view. 

  
I flipped the switch. The illuminated patch of forest floor in front of me revealed a horror my heart wasn't ready for.   
  
It was her. The girl. I must've blinked a million times just to be sure. It was the same white frock with yellow flowers on it, although now stained with mud and blood. The pigtails were intact, but messy. I stared at the same lifeless eyes I saw a few hours ago. 

  
They looked almost glassy, artificial. I noticed the cuts on her body. Something didn't seem right. They weren't random lacerations. It seemed as if they formed some sort of pattern on her body.   
The sound of crunching leaves broke me out of my trance. My blood ran cold at the realization. This girl, this corpse. It took a step forward. A light fog creeped in behind the girl.   
Crunch. She took another step. The snapped tendons dangling from her shoulder joint swung around with every step.

That was all I needed to turn around and get the heck out of there.   
I started sprinting like a madman back to my tower. It wasn't far. I tried to listen for footsteps behind me. There was nothing. I wasn't sure if that thing was giving chase but I was in no position to turn around and check for myself. I could see my tower.   
Just a bit more and then I'll be safe. 

  
I ran onto the dirt trail and grabbed the railing of the stairs.   
I skipped through the steps and reached the top in record time.   
My heart was racing. I felt Goosebumps on the back or my neck.   
Any moment, I expected to feel the cold, clammy touch of the corpse girl on the nape of my neck.   
I opened the door to my tower and jumped inside. I collapsed onto the floor, gasping for air.   
I turned around to face the door, and froze. At the top step of the staircase, right next to the door, were those dead, glassy eyes staring at me. 

  
I ran to the door and slammed it shut. I locked the deadbolt, and dragged my chair in front of the door.   
My heart was beating a mile a minute.   
What the heck was going on? This obviously can't be real. I heard a scraping sound on my front door.   
"GET THE HELL AWAY FROM ME!", I screamed at the top of my lungs.   
I crawled to my bed. My hand reached out for the light switch. The LED bulb flickered. On. Off. On. Off. It showered me in light, then plunged me into the dark. Did that thing screw with the circuitry?  
I had enough of this. 

  
I decided to crouch under the bed and stay there for the rest of the night.   
As I prepared to enter my little hideout, I heard the sound of static. It was my radio.   
I looked at the console. Someone was trying to contact me. Despite the tense situation, I felt a sense of comfort that I was about to have contact with a fellow human being.   
Without a moment of hesitation, I ran to the receiver and picked it up.   
  
"Hello.", I heard Martin's voice.   
"Martin!", I screamed in relief.   
"Where the hell have you been? I've been trying to reach you.", he asked, concerned.   
"Martin, you have to listen to me." I shouted.   
I could hear the panic in my voice.   
  
"I saw her. She's out there. Right outside my door."   
"Hey, calm down. What's going on?" Martin replied in confusion.   
"She's outside my door. I was on the trail and a group of men brought her back here in a body bag and she followed me to the tower."   
  
Tears were rolling down my eyes. I couldn't control myself.   
"Slow down. Take it easy." Martin tried to calm me down. "Who is at your door?"   
"That girl." I cried. "The dead girl we found yesterday. She’s after me, Martin."   
Silence. I waited for Martin to say something.  
  
Nothing. My agitation grew as Martin's silence continued.    
  
"Hey, come on. Say something.", I begged.   
  
"That's impossible.", Martin said.   
  
"What?" I was so confused.   
"Martin, She's right outside my d-" I froze.   
The scraping noise had stopped. In fact, the entire tower was dead silent. The only sound that resonated within the wooden walls was my own frantic heartbeat.   
I slowly walked towards the window that had a view of the front door. I took a look through the glass. There was nothing. Absolutely nothing. Not a single speck of dust, nor a drop of blood, stained the tower stairs.   
  
"That girl's body was cremated 4 hours ago, after the autopsy.", I heard Martin's voice speak to me.   
I sat down on my bed. A million thoughts were racing through my mind.   
"No." I shot back. "You're lying."   
"Listen to me." Martin said sternly. "Her body was cremated 4 hours ago."   
His words, it felt like more of an order than a response. It's like he was telling me that if I thought of it any other way, I would be in trouble. I sat on my bed in fear, waiting for the sun to rise.   
Martin and Rob have been working here for 5 years now. Clearly, they know something I don't. And clearly, the authorities are hiding a dangerous secret, a secret that has taken 4 lives in the past month. 

  
There is something going on here, and I need to know.
