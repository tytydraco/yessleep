Sometimes, it is impossible to tell what the consequences of your actions will be until after you have acted. Did the Romans know they were on their way to creating the world's greatest empire when they subjugated the Celts of northern Italy? Could the Wright Brothers have fathomed the destruction that would follow their invention when they took to the skies? And did I know what I was unleashing upon the innocent and heathen alike when I decided to build a damned church in Blythe, New Foundland? 



In my time of great struggle, I think back to that question a lot. Did the missionaries of the old age know what their spread of faith would cause? What great evils awaited them when they crossed those dark forests and cold waters of Northern Europe?



There may be a lot wrong with the faith, but this act was not one of them. Its consequences may be dire now, but imagine what the world would look like if the hundreds of Pale Demons the Norse Pagans believed were gods still roamed the Earth. I shudder to think about what those consequences would look like. 



And they may have gotten all of them in their time, relegating these demons to the annals of history and myth if one hadn’t smuggled itself across the Atlantic to the untapped fields and naive people of the New World. 



An unending domino effect that has no start, only endings. So, when will this one end?



I awoke one night, my bloody hands wrapped around the chain at the front door, the skin having been ripped off after repeated nights of yanking on the metal for hours. I wasn’t scared anymore when I woke up from these fits. Instead, any fear there would have been was replaced with numb apathy. 



Even the burn of my palms didn’t faze me anymore. Every night was nothing more than a step closer to a horrible death, either from starvation, the Pale Demon, or my own hand. 



But there was something new that night that piqued my interest and dragged me out of my apathy. The smell of smoke permeated the air. Curiosity got the better of me. The chain was tight, but there was just enough give to allow for a small sliver of the outside world to be visible. Black trees and virgin snow were all I could see. But there was something else, specks of black fluttering down to the ground like snowflakes. 



I slowly closed the door and turned the lock, whatever good that would do. I slid down the door and crumpled to the ground. By this point, I couldn’t cry anymore. There wasn’t anything left in me. 



*BOOM*.



Something crashed against the door, causing me to jump.



*BOOM*.



With another crash, I stumbled back, grabbing for my crucifix. This was it. The Pale Demon had come for me. 



“PREACHER!” A familiar voice bellowed.



*BOOM*.



The door burst open, the chain catching it before it could fully open.



“YOUR TIME HAS COME, PREACHER!”



I could hear dozens of voices outside screaming and shouting. 



“LEAVE! LEAVE NOW BEFORE IT GETS YOU!” I warned.



A pair of bolt cutters slipped through the opening and with two swift clips the chain which had kept me safe for weeks gave and tumbled to the ground. The doors flew open and a mob barged into the nave.



“Please! PLEASE!” I pleaded as two men tackled me to the ground.



A rope slipped over my head and wrapped around my mouth and again around my neck. Another rope looped around my arms, binding them behind me. In the mayhem, I saw Gregory standing there amongst the mob, wrath in his eyes and a horrible scowl on his face. There were others among the mob, people who I thought were friends. Mr and Mrs Marlon, the Huttons, and even the sheriff. 



I tried to scream, but the rope around my mouth was only pulled tighter. I was dragged out by the mob, kicking and screaming. Primordial fear and spiked adrenaline gripped my body. The church, my only safety and protection from the Pale Demon, disappeared as I was dragged through the snow. I could see orange lights flickering in the night sky through the trees as I was dragged through the forest. The mob was chanting and raving, every eye that locked on mine was full of nothing but anger and fear. I tried to scream, tried to plead, but there was nothing I could do.



The Old Growth Tree came into view. I didn’t even fight as the mob surrounded one of its massive branches. The rope around my neck was thrown over the branch and pulled tight. The tears I didn’t have before returned and rolled down my cheeks. 



I was pulled by the neck to my feet. My legs were shaky and weak, and the rope was tight; I was being stretched. I couldn’t breathe. I gasped for air, barely able to fill my lungs.



“Preacher!” Gregory shouted, and the mob went silent. He was standing before me, but I couldn’t look at him directly, my neck and head craned at a weird angle, “Preacher, preacher, preacher. You have brought this upon yourself!”



The silent mob mumbled in agreement.



“You brought EVIL to our town,” Gregory said.



“You BASTARD!” Someone in the mob shouted.



“MURDERER!” Someone else shouted.



Gregory put out his hand and shushed the crowd.



“We accepted you, but you brought this on yourself,” Gregory said.



There was a shuffle in the crowd, and a woman stepped forward holding a piece of paper. Her hair was singed, and ash was smeared on her clothes. 



Everyone was covered in ash.



“Final count,” the woman said before melting back into the mob.



Gregory looked at the paper and shook his head.



“Father Jedidiah Padilla, you are hereby found guilty of the murders of Johnathan and Marie Heathstead, Toby Marcus, John O’Donnell, Courtney and Jen Black, Jeremy Withers, Beth Marlon, and George Hutton, victims of your fire! The burning of Blythe and disturbing the peace. You are hereby sentenced to death. Have anything to say for yourself?”



All I could muster was a whimper.



Gregory nodded at someone behind me, and the rope began to tighten around my throat again. This time, my toes came off the ground. My vision blurred, and the corners of my sight darkened. I looked around frantically, but nothing made sense; it was all warped and twisted. Then my eyes fell on two empty sockets. The world turned black, and everything went numb.



When my eyes shot open, it was accompanied by a burning gasp of air. My vision was still blurry, and my head was pounding. My throat was sore, and it was painful even to breathe.



I was lying in the snow, face buried in fresh snow and ash. I tried pushing myself up, but my arms were weak and I collapsed back into the snow with a painful coughing fit. I tried to stand again. This time, my arms weren’t what gave, but rather my right leg. When I put weight on it, a sharp pain shot through my ankle and calf, causing me to collapse yet again.



Pain, collapse, coughing, repeat. I slowly worked my way to the trunk of the Old Growth Tree and leaned against it.



The ground was scorched and blackened all around the base of the tree. Ash hung in the air, and the distinct odor of burned flesh accompanied it. I hesitantly looked around, a growing sense of panic as my memory returned. 



A tree moved. I frantically looked around. The Pale Demon was here. A cold, harsh chuckle pierced the air and carved into my ears. 



“D-aLrrr,” A voice carried on the wind. 



Shaking, I turned to the Old Growth Tree. It loomed so tall over me that I stumbled back as my gaze continued up. I knew what it wanted me to do. I could feel my knees wobbling and bending. 



I couldn’t, I wouldn’t let this bastard finally win. I screamed, breaking whatever trance I was in, and began sprinting through the trees to the dim light of the church. The familiar dim lights of the town of Blythe were gone, but I couldn’t focus on that. My focus was entirely and singularly on the church.



The church’s familiar silhouette began to take shape, the front door sitting wide open, inviting me in. I pushed myself to run even faster. I couldn’t hear or feel the beast behind me but I knew it was there. 



*FWOOSH!*



The church exploded into a ball of fire when I was just inches from reaching the door. The sudden and intense heat burned my face and caused me to crash backward into the ground. The chuckling crackled across the darkness again. The fire was so hot. It licked at the sky in great tendrils of orange and blue. I could do nothing but watch on in shock as the ceiling collapsed in after only a few seconds. After a few more, all that was left was the door frame which remained standing as if taunting me. 



What I did next I can not take credit for. Instinct took over. I gripped the crucifix around my neck and felt the hand of God himself pick my body up. What fear I had, whatever doubt was left, it went away and I saw the paths laid out before me. They were mine to take. I was free to choose. The question was whether I dared to pick the right path. 



Did I know the consequences that would follow? 



No.



I gripped a piece of burning wood, the flames burning as hot as ever. I screamed in pain as I held it like a spear, feeling the burning grip of the wood against my side, my clothes providing no protection. I was running before I knew it, screaming like a barbarian the entire time. I could feel the ground shaking behind me. The grasping of massive, broken fingers just behind me. When I paused my screaming to take a breath, I heard the most blood-curdling shrieking I have ever witnessed. But I pressed on.



The Old Growth Tree came into view. I plunged my burning piece of wood into the trunk of the great tree with so much force that my hands slipped from the wood, and I crashed shoulder-first into the trunk. For a moment, nothing happened. I stumbled back, breathing heavily, when I heard a high-pitched whine. It grew louder and louder until. 



*BOOM!*



The entire tree erupted into flames. The shrieking grew louder. I heard the Pale Demon crashing through the trees around me, slamming its body into each trunk as it stumbled around the burning effigy. 



I began running back toward the church. I paused only to look behind me for a split second. It was there, standing between me and the burning old-growth tree. I could see its entire horrifying silhouette as its expressionless face turned toward me. Those empty sockets were now filled with hatred. 



I continued running. I could hear the Pale Demon crashing through the trees around me, too big to effectively keep up. It bought me time, just enough to reach the church. But I didn’t stop. The cellar door was still open from Clifford's and my previous attempt to capture the beast. I slid to the opening and, with what little strength I had left, flesh tearing itself off my hands and arms as I exerted myself. I shut the metal door just as the Pale Demon crashed against it. It screamed, oh, did it scream. It began pounding on the door and hasn’t stopped since. 



I write this now on a page of the good book. The beast continues to scream and pound on the door, desperate to reach me. I am sure my burns will claim me shortly, even gripping this pencil causes more pain than I could ever imagine. I will trap it here. My final act. May my suffering be the seal that will hold this beast forever. I am truly sorry for the suffering my actions have caused. I can only pray that God will forgive me for my failings.
