I kept thinking about what someone suggested to me yesterday, that maybe Mr. Wilkins was suffering from dementia. On the surface it made sense. He’s an old man, he lives alone, and people his age get confused, especially at night. Maybe the knocks weren’t sinister. Maybe he was disoriented and thought he was at his own door. But that explanation unraveled the more I thought about it. He wasn’t lost. He looked directly at me through the peephole, and the way he said my name, low and deliberate, wasn’t the voice of someone confused. Still, I wanted reassurance. I thought maybe if I asked around, I’d hear that other people had noticed the same thing.

The first house I went to was across the street. Mrs. Callahan answered before I even finished my second knock, like she had been standing right behind the door. Her expression was pleasant enough, but her smile came too quickly, almost rehearsed. I asked her if she had noticed Mr. Wilkins doing anything strange at night. She said, “Strange? No, not at all. He’s a lovely man.” I mentioned the knocking, and for just a moment her eyes darted past me toward my house, before flicking back with that smile still frozen in place. “Sometimes old folks get restless. That’s all,” she said. Then, almost too casually, she added, “You’ll adjust. Everyone does.” And before I could ask what she meant, she closed the door.

I stood on her porch for a moment, staring at the faint glow of a lamp shining through her curtains. Even in the middle of the day, it was on.

The second house I tried was the one with the large maple tree in the front yard. A younger man answered, maybe in his thirties. When I asked if he’d noticed Mr. Wilkins knocking on doors at night, he hesitated, then shook his head slowly. “Best not to think about it,” he muttered. “Just… keep a light on.” I asked what that was supposed to mean, but his eyes slid past me toward my house in the same way Mrs. Callahan’s had. “You’ll figure it out,” he said, and shut the door.

I walked home unsettled, noticing things I hadn’t before. Lamps glowed in nearly every house even though the afternoon sun was still strong. Not just in living rooms, but in kitchens, bedrooms, garages. I tried to brush it off as people wasting electricity, but it wasn’t random. Every house had one light burning, and each light was placed where it could be seen from the street.

That evening, I kept looking out my window as the sun went down. One by one, each house came alive with a single lamp glowing behind curtains. A pale orange rectangle in every window. Even the empty houses with For Sale signs had lights inside. Curtains twitched, and I caught brief flashes of faces watching me from across the street, their outlines blurred by glass and fabric. I realized then that mine was the only house in darkness.

I don’t know why I didn’t turn one on. Stubbornness, maybe, or fear that I was being manipulated. Part of me wanted to see what would happen if I didn’t.

At 3:17, I found out.

The knocking was harder this time, faster, not three isolated knocks but clusters, urgent and relentless. I sat in the dark with my heart pounding, knife in hand, listening to the sound echo through the walls. I wanted to scream but my throat was dry. And then I heard it. Not Wilkins’ voice this time.

It was mine. Whispering my name through the door, perfectly matched to my own voice.

And just before it stopped, I could have sworn I heard it again, faint and muffled. Not from the porch. From deeper inside the house.
