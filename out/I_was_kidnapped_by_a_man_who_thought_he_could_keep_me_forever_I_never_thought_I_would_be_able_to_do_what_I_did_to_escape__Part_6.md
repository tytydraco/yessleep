CW: Abusive content and disturbing imagery

I don’t remember how long I sat in that wretched place, immobilized by fear and confusion, staring at the floor. Time seemed to collapse, every second becoming a weight, every breath a struggle. My mind was so jumbled, I could hardly form a coherent thought. The unrelenting silence and the cold beneath me were all I knew. I couldn’t bring myself to move, knowing that if I did, something bad would happen to me, or to one of the others. I dared not break the fragile balance of whatever dark force held this place.

Lilith wasn’t looking too good. Her condition was rapidly deteriorating, making communication almost impossible. She could hardly speak or move. Now and then, I’d hear her let out a soft groan, her voice barely understandable.

“W…water…I need water.”

I did what I could, sharing what little water I had left with her. I thought I was helping, but in truth, I was only prolonging her suffering and allowing him to continue playing his sick game. All she wanted was mercy, and I couldn’t give it to her. Watching her slip away, unable to do anything, was tearing me apart inside.

The hunger, the pain, and the gnawing desperation all blurred together like a fevered dream, but the reality of it was far worse. I felt my mind slipping, being consumed by the weight of it all. The guilt prodded me constantly, the crushing sense that I was failing her, failing both of us. Every ragged breath she took felt like a silent prayer for an end to her suffering, and I could do nothing but watch. I knew I couldn’t free her from this hell, and it broke me.

My mind was fading, circling the edge of sanity, when it was suddenly interrupted by a presence slowly emerging from the shadows. It was subtle at first, like a ghost wandering the corridors. Then I heard them. Soft, uneven footsteps dragging across the floorboards. They were familiar, almost comforting, ripping me out of my spiraling torment.

The door creaked open slowly, and Mara stepped inside gently, still holding the same emotionless expression. She walked over, reaching a hand toward me. She lightly brushed her fingers against my arm, sending a jolt of warmth across my numb skin. Her touch wasn’t comforting, but it was familiar, breaking the spell of paralysis that had kept me rooted to the floor.

“Come on,” she said, her voice quiet, but insistent. “We have to go.”

I couldn’t even respond. My body was sore and weak, and for a moment, I didn’t know if I could even speak anymore.

She didn’t wait for me to find my words. She knelt beside me and pulled my shoulder upward so that I could look at her. Her eyes were soft but firm, like anchors in a whirl of madness. She placed her hand gently on my back and gave me a little shake, just enough to snap me back to reality.

I finally willed my body to move and pushed myself up to my feet. My legs felt like rubber beneath me, but she stayed close, a steady force to guide me through the open door.

The hallway stretched out before me, longer than I remembered. It felt as though the walls were closing in, yet endless at the same time. Every step I took echoed off the walls, a steady drum of dread that ratcheted the tension even higher. The dim light pulsed overhead, casting shadows that danced on the warped wooden floor. The air was musty, thick with decay, as if the building were rotting beneath me as I walked, yet something about the place still felt very much alive, as if it were watching me, aware of my presence.

I glanced ahead, where Mara was already several steps in front of me, her movements eerily calm. She didn’t seem affected by the atmosphere at all. She moved with determination, and what I thought was grace, each step measured, as if she’d done it a thousand times. Her confidence was unsettling, completely out of place in the crumbling world around us. I had no idea how she did it, but I couldn’t take my eyes off of her, mesmerized by the way she seemed to command the space around her.

Turning a corner, a door emerged down the hall. At first, it seemed like a silent invitation, but the closer we got, the more it felt like a trap, looming ahead like a hungry beast. Its battered frame gleamed unnaturally in the hallway light, as though it were alive, pulsing with an eager, baleful energy.

“I’m not ready,” I whispered, the words barely leaving my lips.

“Ready or not, Emily,” Mara said, her eyes locking onto mine, “he doesn’t wait.”

Her words felt like a blade in my chest.

‘He doesn’t wait.’

That fact alone sat like a stone in my stomach. I knew hesitation wasn’t an option. Not with him. Not here.

We stopped in front of the door so that Mara could find the key. It didn’t look like the others. It was painted matte black, unmarked like the rest. There was no handle, no keyhole, nothing that suggested a way in. She reached into her pocket, pulling out a small, flat metal disc. The disc was unremarkable at first glance. It looked like just a dull, worn piece of metal, but she held it with a kind of reverence. She stepped up to the door and pressed it against the surface, right in the center.

Nothing happened at first, the air turning stale between us, as though the door itself was taking its time to respond.

Then, with a metallic clank, followed by the faint sound of something sliding, the door cracked open slightly. Mara applied more pressure to the disc, and with another faint mechanical whine, the door gave way. It didn’t open like a normal door. Instead, it shifted inward, like a bank vault, hiding things not meant to be seen.

The door swung open smoothly, revealing an opening. The darkness swallowed everything, making it hard to see where the space began and ended. I couldn’t see more than a foot inside. The air felt cold and stagnant, heavy with the scent of bleach and old iron, becoming sharp and sterile, like an old hospital room, the further we went inside.

“This is Stage Two,” she said, voice low and grave. “Where the real test begins. Where he will show you your breaking point.”

As my eyes adjusted, I could see further into the space. It was like nothing I’d ever seen. The walls were crooked, twisted at strange angles, as if the architecture itself were trying to contain and confuse me. A low hum vibrated through the stone floor, through my bones and into my skull, burrowing deeper with every breath I took. It felt different. It felt alive.

My heart raced as my hair stood on end. I couldn’t focus. I wanted to look away, to scream, but my brain refused to cooperate. Every instinct gnawed at me to run, but I couldn’t move.

“This is…” I began, Mara cutting me off.

“Shh. Don’t talk. Listen.”

The hum grew louder, twisting into something different, something worse. Whispers filled the room, voices barely audible in the darkness, reverberating across the walls and curling around me like smoke. They slithered into my mind, burrowing into my consciousness.

“You hear them?” Mara whispered, voice thin. “He feeds on them. He feeds on their fear and obedience, using them when he wants, and then he leaves them here.”

She reached over and flicked a switch on the wall. Suddenly, hundreds of fluorescent lights buzzed above my head, flickering alive. The room stretched out before me, much further than I thought, now completely bathed in light. It was lined with rows of cages, but not like normal animal cages. These served a far more sinister purpose.

Metal bars twisted and bent, some almost rusted through, others reinforced with chains, to prevent escape, or even movement. They were small, cramped little spaces, meant to hold humans.

Inside the cages were dozens of women, all of them silent and hollow-eyed. Some sat, curled in on themselves, their bodies frail and hunched from days, maybe weeks, of confinement. Others stood, their hands wrapped around the bars, eyes wide and empty, staring out into nothing. Their skin was pale and sickly, stretched thin over bone, like meat left out to rot.

Some of them lay sprawled on the concrete, bound and wailing in pain. Their bodies told a heartbreaking tale. Some of them bore signs of profound violation. Swollen bellies stretched taut against filthy rags that barely clung to their emaciated frames, as if the weight of what had been forced inside them had physically become too much for them to bear. There was no joy in this. No hope. Only the unmistakable, brutal mark of ownership, the undeniable proof that what grew inside them had been created out of force and control. No longer an innocent life, but the echo of his cruelty on their ravaged bodies. I could see now, with chilling clarity, the depth of his evil.

I took a step forward. My body carried me closer unconsciously, drawn to them before my mind could catch up. Their eyes flicked toward me, hollow and pleading, yet no words came. Their mouths were silent, but their eyes begged for something… anything to end their suffering misery.

I stumbled back a step, feeling the bile rise in my throat. They weren’t just prisoners. They were broken, only pieces of themselves, of their humanity. He had stripped away the rest, leaving behind nothing but a vessel, a symbol of his twisted control and domination.

Mara stepped closer, brushing her hand against my arm. I felt the warmth of her touch, but it did nothing to calm the raw panic rising in me.

“These are the ones who’ve been... chosen,” she murmured. “They all believed they could resist. They all believed they could survive. But they were wrong. He breaks you in ways he knows you can’t fight. They’re his now. And he wants you next.”

These women weren’t just victims. They were warnings. Every one of them became a cautionary tale, a stark reminder of what he was truly capable of.

I couldn’t let him do this to me. I wouldn’t. I knew I had to hold on… to survive. But the longer I stood there, the more I felt my resolve starting to crack. Seeing all those innocent lives bound and trapped, hearing their whispers, feeling their fear… it was all starting to get to me. I fell to my knees and began to sob, letting all of the built-up anger and pain flow out of me. I had stayed strong for so long, until now. I had never felt weaker, more insignificant, more guilty.

“Focus, Emily,” Mara said sharply, pulling me back. “This is where the real test begins. Do you understand? You either break or you fight. There’s no middle ground here.”

I nodded, my throat tight, the words stuck somewhere deep inside me. My knees ached against the hard floor, my shoulders shaking as the sobs came in waves, raw and uncontrollable, pulled from a place that I didn’t even know existed. But in the pit of my stomach, a flicker of something burned. Beneath the grief, something shifted. A blinding rage rose from deep within me, burning into my chest and bringing with it strength and defiance. The sorrow didn’t disappear. It was hardened, sharpened into a weapon I could use.

Slowly, I pushed myself upright, rising from the floor as the anger filled my limbs with newfound strength. I stood tall, breathing unsteadily but resolutely.

I wouldn’t let him do this to me.

Mara’s gaze lingered on me for a moment, studying me, weighing my resolve. Then she turned and began walking toward the next row of cages.

"You’ll see,” she murmured. “He’s always watching. Always waiting."

I didn’t want to follow. I didn’t want to look at them anymore. Every face, every empty stare, every trembling breath felt like fingers wrapping around my heart, squeezing until I could barely move. But the newfound spark inside me, that small, stubborn, growing flame, refused to let me turn away. Not now. Not knowing that they were all still trapped here. Not when they needed someone to fight for them.

I had to survive… Not just for me, but for them.
