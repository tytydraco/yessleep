So I’ve been told from a couple people I should put this online somewhere just to see what others think and a podcast I listen to, Redweb, has mentioned here a number of times about people posting theirs so I figured why not. So here is my paranormal experience.

This happened back in Highschool/middleschool so around 2010-2012 I’m not positive on what grade but it doesn’t really matter. A little back story that I learned many years later is that when my dad died in the early 2000’s, lead poisoning as we joke about but really self inflicted gunshot, there was a friend of the family that practiced warlock/whichcraft stuff and did a “protective chant” over our household. Could be related could not I feel it’s relative enough to add to the story. 
  So we lived in a 4 bed 2 bath double wide mobile home just my mom, the oldest boy, my sister and me the youngest best boy. Which from the front door you could go straight through the back half of the living room, turn left in the dining room, straight in the kitchen to a back hallway with the washer/drier, turn left in the master bath, straight into the master bed, once in the master bed turn left and be back in the living room to repeat endless. A lovely little circle to run in as kids. When in the dinner room if you turned right would be a hallway and the first left would be a bathroom, second left was my room straight was my brothers and right was my sisters. I could draw a picture of the house if anyone cared for it.
  At night my mom would close her door going to the living room but normally leave the one from her bedroom to the master bath and from the bath to the hallway open. We had a fridge in the back hallway the we kept waters in and sleepy mom didn’t want to deal with doors.  
  Well as kids normally do I was staying up late, probably on our family desktop in the dinner room or maybe playing Xbox who knows and doesn’t matter. It’s late midnight to early ams for sure and I decided to get a water from the back hallway. Well my mom is a creature of habit if anything. She has her spontaneous moments but her morning and bedtime routines have always been the same. Shower, read, bathroom, turn off her lights, face down her blue led lighted alarm clock and go to sleep, wake up, fold up alarm clock, brush teeth, coffee read in bed, get ready for day. Every day the same I’ve never seen it change. Until today.
  Once I got to the door for the master bath in the hallway I probably had 3 or 4 steps to the back door and fridge to the right of that but something caught my eye. Something I knew was off. Wrong in this routine. Her led alarm was facing up. Here room had that faint glow of blue led that just pieced to my eyes in the hallway, not a ton of light but enough to see shapes and the such. So I thought it odd and went to investigate. My mom being a very light sleeper normally would hear someone just walk into her room so I tiptoed into the bathroom, between the tub and vanity to the master bed door and stood in the doorway. Just curiously investigating. When I saw it. 

A figure. At the right side of my mom’s queen size bed. Her side she slept on, with the light glow of the clock. I could see it standing there. But not right. Its legs were straight. It’s hips slightly taller than my mom laid on the bed. And the “thing” a perfect 90 degrees directly over my mom. I went to speak but stop. I might have made a noise I don’t know. All my hair was standing up. Then “it” stood up. In a snap it was straight vertical. Like it took a floating back step pasted in front of the clock blocking out the light and into the shadow of the wall on the right. I was too scared to look hoping I imagined it. Oh. How I was wrong. It what seemed like a long time but by the clock no time for I never took my eyes off those blue leds they went dark. 
 He was in front of me.. At the time I was a runner. 6 feet 4 inches tall and about 165 pounds. Not a thick man but a tall one at the least. And. And this thing. Was every bit looking me eye to eye. It was light a shadow. But you shouldn’t see through it but at the same time you could. I was cold. I was scared. This thing filled the door way in front of me literally nose to nose with me. And I did the only thing I could. The only logical thing my terrified mind could think of in the situation of me, my mother and some entity. 
 
In my mind I wished my mother the best of luck. I turned on my heels. I ditched the water idea, gave up on what ever game or device I might have stayed up way to late on and I went to my room, closed the door and hide under the covers because everyone knows monsters can’t get you there and went to sleep. 

Over the years I have been asked by my mom about this incident and it’s always been the same retelling. The fear and cold of just her bedroom and bathroom, the figure watching her and coming to me. This all being caused by her upturned led alarm clock, which was never again left upturned I might add. I never saw “it” again, I never wanted to see it again. I’ve done some digging over the years and came up with nothing on the subject. He did not have a hat, no glowing eyes. No facial features or any features for that matter. It was like a shadow of my exact size that once in front of me filled the whole doorway but didn’t. Like a person of darkness but clear. The best I can describe was when looking right at a spot it was just darkness but around that spot in your peripheral vision you could see what was behind him. I have not a clue what it could have been. If this was just a random thing. Maybe something from my dad. He was the same height as me and my weight at that age, not when he died. Was it something today with the warlock/whichcraft.
  I have honestly no idea. I’m 28 now. Every so often this thought comes back to me and I can still feel that same fear. My morbid curiosity would love to figure out more about what this could have been but alas I’ve came up short. Maybe someone out there has some knowledge of what I speak. Or maybe a similar experience. Either way, thanks for reading.
