The Corolla died three miles past the last exit sign, the engine cutting out with a shudder that I felt in my teeth. I coasted onto the shoulder and sat there in the dark, hazards clicking, watching semis blast past and rock the car in their wake.

My phone showed one bar. Then none. Then one again.

The tow company put me on hold before a woman with a smoker's rasp told me two hours, minimum. Maybe three. Dispatcher said there'd been a pile-up west of Barstow and they were running every truck they had.

"There's a rest stop about a mile ahead," the woman said. "If you want to wait somewhere with a bathroom."

I looked at the desert darkness beyond my headlights. A mile didn't sound far. A mile sounded like a death sentence.

"I'll stay with the car."

"Suit yourself. Driver'll call when he's twenty out."

The line went dead. I locked the doors and turned off the hazards to save the battery and sat in the darkness, watching my phone screen dim and brighten and dim again.

A pickup pulled onto the shoulder behind me.

I watched it in the rearview. White Ford, maybe ten years old, work lights mounted on the roof rack. It sat there for a full minute before the driver's door opened and a man stepped out.

He was mid-fifties, maybe. Thick through the shoulders. He wore a denim jacket and walked with the unhurried gait of someone who had nowhere else to be. When he reached my window, he made a little circular motion with his finger.

I cracked the window two inches.

"Car trouble?" His voice was gentle. Midwestern, maybe. The kind of voice that read bedtime stories and knew all the words to church hymns.

"Tow truck's coming."

"That's good." He nodded, looking at my hood like he could diagnose the problem through it. "How long they say?"

"Two hours."

"Two hours." He repeated it like he was tasting the words. "That's a long time to sit on the side of the 15. You got water? Gets cold out here at night, but you'd be surprised how fast you dehydrate."

"I'm fine."

"Rest stop's about a mile up. Vending machines, bathroom, good overhead lighting. Safer than sitting here in the dark."

"I'll wait with the car."

He smiled. His teeth were very white and very straight, the kind of teeth that cost money. "Smart. Don't trust strangers. That's smart." He patted the roof of my car twice, gently, the way you'd pat a dog. "You need anything, I'll be at that rest stop. White Ford. Name's Gary."

"Thank you."

"Don't mention it."

He walked back to his truck. Didn't hurry. Didn't look back. The Ford pulled around me and merged onto the highway, taillights dwindling until they disappeared.

I realized I'd been holding my breath.

The temperature in the car dropped until I could see my breath. I started the engine to run the heater. It turned over, coughed, died. I tried again. Nothing.

I got out and started walking.

The desert was louder than I'd expected. Wind through scrub brush, the distant keen of something that might have been a coyote, the hiss of sand against my jeans. The highway was a black river to my left, cars passing in bursts of light and noise that left me more alone each time they faded.

The rest stop appeared as a glow on the horizon first, then resolved into a concrete rectangle surrounded by parking lot lights on tall poles. Two big rigs sat at the far end, dark and silent, their drivers asleep in the cabs. A sedan with Nevada plates sat near the bathroom entrance.

And the white Ford, parked directly under the brightest light.

Gary sat on a picnic bench near the vending machines, reading a paperback. He looked up when I entered the pool of light and smiled like I was an old friend arriving at a party.

"Decided to take me up on it."

"Car won't start."

"Battery, probably. Sitting with the hazards on drains them faster than people think." He closed his book, something with an old Western cover.

"I'm fine."

"Water, then. You look cold."

I was cold. My jacket was in the car. I'd walked a mile in a thin sweater because the thought of going back for it felt like admitting I'd be out here longer than I could stand.

"Okay. Water. Thank you."

He fed quarters into the machine and retrieved a bottle, brought it to me with both hands extended like an offering. When I took it, his fingers didn't linger. He stepped back immediately, maintaining a distance that felt calculated to reassure.

"I didn't catch your name."

"Claire."

"Claire." He smiled again. "Pretty name. Old-fashioned. You don't hear it much anymore."

"It was my grandmother's."

"That's nice. Keeping it in the family." He returned to the picnic bench, sitting on the table with his feet on the seat, hands folded in his lap. Patient. Unhurried. "You call the tow company again? Let them know where you are?"

"Not yet."

"Signal's better over by the bathrooms. Something about the building, I think. Metal in the roof blocks the interference."

I walked to the bathroom entrance. Gary didn't follow. I checked my phone and found two bars, solid. The tow company picked up after three rings.

"He's still working the pile-up," the woman said. "Shouldn't be too much longer. You're next on his list."

"Can you tell him I'm at the rest stop? Mile past where my car broke down?"

"I'll let him know."

I hung up. When I turned around, Gary was standing ten feet away.

"Get through?"

"Yeah. Still waiting on the pile-up."

"Those can take a while. Depends on how bad it is, how many vehicles." He tilted his head. "You want to sit? Benches aren't comfortable, but they're better than standing."

We sat at the picnic table, across from each other. Gary picked up his paperback and set it aside. The cover showed a man in a black hat pointing a revolver at something outside the frame.

"You read Westerns?" I asked.

"Louis L'Amour, mostly. My father used to read them. Reminds me of him."

"Is he still around?"

"Passed when I was thirty. Heart attack. Quick, at least."

A semi pulled into the rest stop, air brakes hissing. The driver climbed down from the cab, a heavy man in a flannel shirt, and walked to the bathroom without looking at either of us.

Gary watched him go. "Truckers don't sleep enough. Read an article about it once. They take pills to stay awake, drive eighteen, twenty hours at a stretch. Then they pull off and crash for a few hours and do it again. Hell of a way to make a living."

"What do you do?"

"Contractor. Kitchens and bathrooms, mostly. Remodels." He held up his hands, showing me the calluses. "Good honest work. Keeps me busy."

"You're out late for a contractor."

"Couldn't sleep. Happens sometimes. I drive when it gets bad. Helps clear my head." He smiled. "You married, Claire?"

"Divorced."

"Kids?"

"No."

"That's probably for the best. Divorce is hard enough without kids in the middle." He was watching the trucker's rig now, waiting. "I've got a daughter. Lives in Portland. Works for one of those tech companies, the kind where they have ping-pong tables in the office and call their employees a family."

"That's nice."

"We don't talk much anymore."

The trucker came out of the bathroom, still not looking at us, and climbed back into his cab. The engine rumbled to life. Headlights swept the parking lot as he pulled out, and then we were alone.

"You're nervous," Gary said. It wasn't a question.

"I'm just tired."

"You're nervous because you're smart. Woman alone, middle of the night, stranger being friendly." He nodded slowly. "I tell my daughter the same thing. Trust your instincts. Be careful. The world isn't safe for women the way it's safe for men. Never has been."

"That's good advice."

"Is it?" He leaned forward, elbows on his knees. "Here's what I wonder about, Claire. What good does being careful do if the danger doesn't look like danger? If it looks like a guy in a denim jacket reading Louis L'Amour at a rest stop? If it looks like help?"

I didn't answer.

"My daughter," Gary said. "The reason we don't talk. Her mother told her something before she died. A warning. Stay away from your father. Don't be alone with him. Don't trust him."

"Why would she say that?"

"Because she knew me. Better than anyone ever has." He picked up the paperback and turned it over in his hands, not looking at the cover. "Claire, I've been doing this drive for three years now. Every few weeks, when I can't sleep. And I stop here every time. Right here at this rest stop. You know why?"

"Why?"

"Because people break down out here. All the time. Forty miles of nothing in either direction, cell service that barely works, tow trucks that take forever. And most of the time, people just wait it out. But sometimes there's a woman. Alone. Stranded. And I see her car on the shoulder, and I think to myself, she's exactly the kind of person that bad things happen to out here. Wouldn't it be something if I could help. If I could just make sure she's safe until her ride comes."

"That's very kind."

"No. It isn't." He set the book down. "Kindness would be driving past. Kindness would be minding my own business. But I can't seem to do that. I see a woman alone in the dark, and I have to stop. I have to."

My phone buzzed in my pocket. I didn't reach for it.

"You should check that," Gary said. "Might be your tow truck."

I pulled out my phone. Text from an unknown number: En route. 20 mins.

"He's coming," I said. "Twenty minutes."

"Good. That's good." Gary stood up from the bench. "Walk with me."

"I should wait here. Where he can see me."

"He'll find you. Walk with me. Just to the edge of the light. I want to show you something."

We walked together toward the edge of the parking lot, where the overhead lights gave way to desert darkness. Gary stayed a half-step behind me, just in my peripheral vision. I could hear him breathing, slow and even.

"This is the spot," he said.

I stopped. The highway was visible in the distance, headlights appearing and disappearing.

"What am I looking at?"

"Nothing. That's the point. You can't see anything from here. Someone in the rest stop, they can't see us. Someone on the highway, they're going too fast to notice. We're invisible."

I turned to face him. "What do you want?"

"I want to tell you something. Something I've never told anyone." He put his hands in his pockets, and I flinched before I could stop myself. He noticed. "I'm not going to hurt you, Claire. That's not what this is. But I need you to understand what you're standing next to. What you've been sitting across from for the last hour. What you took water from."

"Okay."

"I've never hurt anybody. Not in the way my daughter thinks. Not in the way you're thinking right now." He paused. "But I've thought about it. I've thought about it more than I've thought about anything else in my life. Since I was fourteen years old, I've thought about what it would be like. The sound it would make. How it would feel in my hands. Whether they'd fight or freeze or beg. I've read about it. I've planned it. I've driven out here, to this exact spot, and I've walked women to this exact place, and I've imagined it so clearly that sometimes I can't tell the difference between what I've done and what I've only wanted to do."

My legs felt locked in place. Later, I would wonder why I didn't run. Later, I would lie awake for months turning this moment over, trying to understand the paralysis.

"Say something," Gary said.

"What do you want me to say?"

"I don't know. That's the thing. I've never gotten this far before. The other times, I walked them out here, and I made small talk, and I let them go, and they never knew. They got in their cars or their tow trucks and they drove away and they never thought about me again. Just a nice man at a rest stop. But tonight I wanted to say it out loud. I wanted someone to know."

"Why me?"

"I don't know." He smiled, and it was worse than anything else he'd done because it looked genuine. Warm. "Maybe because you look like you'd understand. You've got that look, Claire. Like you've seen things. Like you know the world isn't what people pretend it is."

"I don't understand this at all."

"No. I guess you don't." He looked at the desert, at the darkness beyond the parking lot lights. "My wife figured it out. Took her twenty years, but she figured it out. Not what I'd done, because I haven't done anything. What I am. She could see it in me, she said. Something behind my eyes. Something that wasn't like other people. She stayed with me anyway, because she thought she could fix it, or save me, or some other thing that women tell themselves when they love someone they shouldn't love. And when she was dying, when she knew she couldn't protect anyone anymore, she told our daughter. She said, your father is a monster. He's never done anything, but he is. Stay away from him. And my daughter believed her. Because my wife wasn't a liar. My wife was the most honest person I've ever known. And if she said I was a monster, then I was."

"Are you?"

Gary looked at me for a long time. "I don't know. I think about it all the time, and I still don't know. What makes someone a monster? Is it what they do, or what they want to do? If I live my whole life without hurting anyone, am I still a monster because I wanted to? Because I thought about it every single day? Because the only reason I didn't was fear, not conscience?"

"I don't know either."

"No. You don't." He took a step toward me, and I stepped back, and he stopped. "That's the first time you've moved away from me. The whole night, that's the first time. You didn't move away when I walked up to your car. You didn't move away when I brought you the water. You didn't move away when we sat at the table, when we walked out here, when I told you what I was. But now you move. Why now?"

"Because now I believe you."

"Good." He nodded. "That's good. You should believe me." He took his hands out of his pockets, slowly, showing me they were empty. "Your tow truck's going to be here soon. You should go wait by the road."

"What are you going to do?"

"Drive home. Go to bed. Wake up tomorrow and give an estimate on a bathroom remodel in Rancho Cucamonga." He smiled again. "That's the thing about people like me, Claire. We look like everybody else. We sound like everybody else. We do bathroom remodels and read Louis L'Amour and stop to help women whose cars have broken down. And most of the time nothing happens, because the circumstances aren't right, or the risk is too high, or we just decide not to. But the wanting is always there. Every single day. And you'll never be able to tell. Not until it's too late."

He turned and walked back toward the rest stop, hands in his pockets, unhurried. I watched him until he reached his truck. He got in, started the engine, and pulled out onto the highway heading east. Toward Victorville. Toward a house where he lived alone.

I stood at the edge of the parking lot until headlights slowed on the highway and the yellow flash of a tow truck's light bar appeared. The driver pulled into the rest stop and leaned out the window. Young guy, early twenties, apologetic about the wait.

"Hell of a night," he said. "You okay? You look like you saw a ghost."

I climbed into the passenger seat. Closed the door. Locked it.

"Just cold," I said. "Long wait."

He talked the whole way back to my car. The pile-up near Barstow, the overtime, his girlfriend who didn't understand why he worked nights. I didn't hear any of it. I was thinking about Portland. About a daughter who believed her mother's warning. About a wife who stayed with a monster for twenty years because she thought she could save him.

The Corolla's battery was dead, just like Gary had said. The driver jumped it in five minutes, and I sat behind the wheel as the engine idled, waiting for the charge to build.

"You good to drive?"

"I'm good."

"Nearest gas station's about twenty miles. Get yourself some coffee."

"I will."

I pulled onto the highway and drove east, toward the glow of Las Vegas on the horizon. In my rearview, the rest stop shrank to a single point of light in all that darkness, and then it was nothing at all.

I never told anyone about Gary. Not the police, not my friends, not the therapist I started seeing. But I need to tell someone. I need people to know he's out there. But what would I say? A man talked to me. A man gave me water. A man walked me to the edge of the light and told me what he was and then drove home to sleep in his bed like any other person.  

Nothing happened.

That was the worst part. Nothing happened, and I couldn't prove anything, and somewhere in Victorville a man with a gentle voice was lying awake in the dark, thinking about the sound it would make. The way it would feel. Whether they'd fight or freeze or beg.

And I would never know if tonight was the night he stopped imagining.

Or tomorrow night.

Or the night after that.
