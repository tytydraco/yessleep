When I applied to be a deckhand of all things, I wasn’t doing it for the thrill of stormy nights out on the sea. To put it simply, I needed the money – rent is tight, and my brother is in university.

My father, who had been employed similarly previously, suggested it because of its ‘opportunity for an interesting career.’ I am 19 and recently quit a soul-sucking retail job that paid dirt and rolled your face in it, so I applied. To my shock (and partial dismay) I was accepted. Now, I wish I’d said no.

The day before I started, the company took me in for some kind of assessment. They asked me basic questions; ‘Do you have any kind of disability?’ ‘Are you physically fit?’ At the end of it all, I was scheduled to a boat the next morning.

I remember those days like it was yesterday:

The first day, it was all new and scary. I stepped onto an older vessel with a creaking deck and lined with peeling paint. Meekly, I walked around, inspecting the equipment. Partially frayed ropes and rusted chains backed by hand cranks and crab pots. Traditional fishing equipment, rods and lines, sat in pockets towards the bow, lining it.

*God help us all,* I thought, the looks were not appealing.

‘You the new Deckhand?’ A voice called out. It was hoarse and aged, like you could hear the seas in his voice. I looked up, and an older man stepped down from the cockpit onto the deck. His face was adorned with greying hair and a wispy beard. I nodded.

‘Nice to meet ya. I’m Fred, the cap’n of the ol’ girl here.’ He stuck out a wrinkled hand. I shook it, smiling: ‘I’m Jason.’

‘It’ll be nice to have an extra pair o’ hands.’ He patted my back; his surprising strength knocked me forward slightly. ‘It can get hectic out there.’

‘I’ll bet.’ I tried to show confidence that wasn’t there.

He took me further into the boat. Two other people were there, working before the boat left port. One was middle aged; a black goatee complimented a worn face with crows’ feet and green eyes. Lean muscle covered in overalls and waterproof trousers.

On the other side was a skinnier guy with a lankier frame. His wilder eyes complimented his yellowed teeth. I waved, reluctantly.

‘Don’t let Gary get to ya.’ The old man said, following my gaze. ‘The other one’s Ben. His cold exterior hides a heart o’ gold, that one.’

Ben averted his gaze, embarrassed.

‘Since your new, you’ll be on basic deck duty for the week, then I’ll get ya on the harder jobs. You’ll also be helping retrieve nets and line if needed.’

Said nets were large and sprawled out on the stern. Just by looking at them, I could tell they had seen better days.

‘We’re settin’ sail in 5, so get comfy.’ Fred spoke.

Nothing of note happened when we went out, we made our way about 10 miles from shore before stopping over a shipwreck about half a mile down.

‘Lower the lines!’ Fred called from the cockpit. I watched as Gary lowered a line intermittently filled with baited hooks into the water, straight down.

‘Son, ya wanna hit the rods?’ It was Fred.

I paused, thinking. I had never fished on this scale before – my biggest fish was 2lbs off a pier somewhere. I thought giving it a shot would’ve been fun.

‘Sure. Which one do I take?’ I yelled back.

‘Whichever one catches ya fancy!’

I picked the first one.

It didn’t take long before I felt a pull. I remember the burn in my arms as I reeled, but the time fell away due to the more interesting work. I eventually spotted a shape rapidly ascending in the water. I hauled the fish up. I may not fish, but I know a Cod when I see one, and this one was a good size – roughly 10lbs.

‘Good stuff, kid.’ This voice was softer, but with a hint of gravel. ‘Toss it in the storage behind me.’ I turned; the speaker was Ben.

‘All right.’ I walked to the fish storage and placed it inside; the chill of the insulated cold storage numbed my fingers further than the oceanic wind already had. That wind felt odd, like it counteracted the glow of the sun in an unnatural, icy grip.

It continued like this for a while. The fishing didn’t change throughout the day. I pulled up a few more, including multi haul with Mackerel.

The thought of placing live fish inside a cold box for them to slowly choke to death was kind of gross at the start – the rest told me it’s part of the job.

Then, I pulled up my next fish. When it came up, I froze. It was mangled.

It hung on my line, still. Red dripped back into the water from surface wounds cut with surgical precision, revealing bones snapped and twisted in a gruesome caricature of a painful death. The wounds transferred into its form, ripped from the strain of a shattering skeleton.

The fish itself was small. It would’ve been easy prey to any noteworthy predator, but I realised something:

Predators strike to kill, not to torture. This wasn’t a failed hunt. It looked like a kid performing surgery on their stuffed animal. A person tearing something apart to see what’s inside.

‘Hey, guys, Look at this.’ I whisper, both men turn to me.

They saw, but were silent, like they didn’t want to acknowledge it.

I turned back to the fish, its unmoving body was ever still, contradicting the rivulets of blood that leaked from it. The copper smell of its blood paired with the sudden chill in the wind sent a shiver up my spine.

Then, it twitched. Its bones cracked and rustled as its body flopped hopelessly.

I remember the shock that coursed through me, and the even worse fear when its eye moved. It switched its empty gaze to look directly at me. Despite the animal obviously being dead, I could’ve sworn there was intent behind its eye. It looked at me not with soulless eyes you’d see in death, but a sight burning with limbo.

The worst part was that the look didn’t feel feral or animalistic. It felt human. Like I looked at this destroyed fish and saw human eyes looking back at me.

‘SON!’

Fred’s call snapped me out of it, and I shut my eyes.

‘You alright?’ he called, stepping down from the cockpit and walking over to me.

‘Ah.’

He put a hand on my shoulder.

‘Happens sometimes. Crab pinchers can do some serious damage if they want something enough.’

I looked him in the eyes. They were not filled with his usual energy. They were tired. Knowing. Fearful.

He masked it and smiled, patting me on the back again.

‘You’ll get used to it. Throw it back.’ And with that, he went to check on the other crew members, who brought in their own haul of regular, non-shredded fish.

The rest of the day went smoothly. The weather held and the haul was good enough.

It didn’t happen again until the next day.

The walk to and boarding the boat remained the same, setting sail was the same, but the spot wasn’t the same. At first, I found that to be odd – the fishing was fine, despite the crabs, so I asked Fred about it:

‘Hey, wasn’t the fishing pretty good back at the other wreck? Why did we change?’

I saw him hesitate, pursing his lips.

‘Sometimes it’s good to move down a wreck. Its sustainable fishin'’.

He seemed honest, but something in that response didn’t convince me.

‘Oh… right. Fair enough.’ I respond.

‘You’d be shocked how much the environment affects our waters, son.’

It didn’t take long until I pulled up another mangled fish. This time, it was an eel.

Its entire body was bent in a spiral, its spine protruding from sharp angles where it was twisted. Its maw opened impossibly wide with broken teeth and ripped fins. The same stench hit me, along with the same cold wind. This one didn’t move or look at me with that freakish stare. It did something worse.

Before it breached the surface, I saw it fighting me below the waves. It looked healthy, alive, kicking. It was like it was passed through a shredder it as it came out. That haul was accompanied by a prickle in my back – the feeling of being watched.

I stared at the eel, waiting for it to unfurl and lunge at me, or look at me with the same set of eyes, but it didn’t. It stayed still, as if it wanted me to ponder why it was alive and then not.

‘Throw it back.’ Fred suddenly appeared at my side; I hadn’t heard him come over.

I jumped. the eel slipped from the hook and fell out of sight.

‘God, Fred! You scared me!’ I breathed, letting the adrenaline pool in my system.

‘Sorry, son. I just had to make sure you threw that fish back.’

In hindsight, I should’ve confronted him right then and there. I should’ve asked him why he was being so off, but I didn’t. The money was more important at the time.

Ever since that eel, the feeling of being watched never left. I constantly felt as if the ocean itself was keeping an eye on me, as if I was being studied by an invisible mind.

We didn’t stay out on the water for much longer. Fred ordered us back to port. I got ready to leave the boat for home when I heard something. It was a yell, so far out into the distance you could barely make it out.

‘Come back.’

And for some reason, I wanted to. I wanted to get back on the boat, but I didn’t, I walked home with an uncomfortable feeling crawling on my back.

The day after was an actual, living nightmare.

We moved wrecks again, under the same guise of sustainable fishing. We were further out into the ocean – deeper water, further from shore. The waves rocked the boat harder, the wind seeped into me with a deeper chill, and the very air held a sense of isolation. That didn’t matter, though. It was time to fish.

I chose to tidy the deck a bit before fishing, but when I ended up doing it, nothing went right. We all pulled up mangled fish. My first was a Rockfish with its spines shoved through its head. Gary pulled up an eel-like fish with its teeth lodged in every bone. Ben and I both reeled in two connected to each other by the tail, ripped and fused together mid-struggle.

Fred’s eyes held a desperation as he ordered us to return them, before pulling me aside:

‘Throw ‘em back, and do NOT think about it.’ He spoke, eyes pleading, ‘We don’t know why this happens, or what it means, but what we do know is that if we ignore it, it happens less. Please, try to stop thinkin’ about it.’

He showed me an old scroll, with an artist’s depictions of an old vessels hauling fish like ours – one showed a whale, harpooned, so torn to bits that it looked more like a shark in a whale’s skin.

He left me after that, and I kept fishing, forcing the shredded ones out of my mind after they hit the water, and we started pulling more regular fish in. Fish we could sell. I thought it was over.

Then, the water turned eerily calm, as if the waves noticed something and went silent.

Confusion slammed into us, and we looked around.

‘What is happening?’ I mumbled to myself, getting a shrug from Ben.

Clouds moved in from every direction, blotting out the weakened sun.

Then, the water shifted.

Something moved just under the surface. Something large, long, and heavy. It wasn't surfaced at first, but the ripples gave it away.

I looked at the others. Ben’s mouth was gaping, eyes wide. Gary looked on with a fleeting fear in his eyes.

It began to move, circling. The feeling of being watched crept on me again – Cold, crawling. My hair stood on end. This thing felt wicked.

It moved up, its back breaking the surface. It was eerily familiar. I could’ve sworn I’d seen this figure before. It was larger than our boat.

It continued to circle around us, and I looked up to Fred’s cockpit. He was still, beads of sweat formed on his forehead. He looked at me, begging.

***GROAN***

The thing’s voice was so loud it shook the boat, sending ripples out into the water. Ripples through my very soul.

It then spoke again. Its groans took on a more mechanical feel, pitching in tones and depth as if it had learned its own language once more.

It closed in, and I got a better look at it as it passed me. I saw the tip of its sloped tail, twitching as if it was testing its own body. I saw the skin on its back, and its long snout that split into a maw with multiple rows of teeth.

It looked at me.

The same snapping sounds as the cod enveloped me as its eye moved, that same empty gaze filled with twisted life. I almost leaned over to get a better look, but I didn’t need to.

It reared up and leapt for me, a roaring hiss escaped its lips as its mouth widened. I jumped back, falling backwards onto the deck. Pain split through my back and head, but I looked up all the same.

gums flashed in my direction as it reached for my position.

***CRACK***

Its jaws snapped shut before it fell back into the water with a mighty splash.

Then the waves returned, the boat began to rock once more. I felt a pair of hands pull me up by my arms.

‘You alright, kid?’ I turned; it was Ben. I couldn’t say anything, adrenaline was pumping too hard. If that happened again, I wouldn't even have time to yell.

‘I understand, if a shark almost got me, I’d be silent too.’ He said, putting a hand on my shoulder.

I paused.

‘…Shark?’ I said, flabbergasted.

‘Well…Yeah. It was a big one at that.’ He replied, confidently.

My head spun.

‘No, Ben, that wasn’t a shark.’

He looked at me, concern twisting his features.

‘Maybe we should head back – we’re ahead of quota and you need to rest.’

I failed to argue. The shock of it all forced me to sit down as the engine fired up. The journey to shore was filled with nerves. Fred was so silent I’d forgotten he was there, only dismissing us by walking off into the local pub.

The first thing I did when I got home was call my brother – I had a hunch about where I’d seen the thing before.

‘Hey.’ I said shaken.

‘Woah, you alright? You sound scared.’ He asked, softly.

‘Yeah, but I need to ask you something.’

I described the creature, from its size to its scales, listening as his breathing turned into focus. My brother, bless him, has an almost unhealthy obsession with prehistory. With that, came interest in prehistoric animals.

‘That sounds like a Mosasaur.’ And with that, I remembered seeing it in one of his books. Serpent-like with paddle fins and a long snout – the description fit.

‘But what your saying doesn’t sit right with me. I’m all into modern prehistoric sightings, but you have to be pulling my leg, here.’ He said.

‘What? Why?’ I asked, confused.

‘Well, Mosasaurs lived in warm, shallow seas, not deep in ocean waters where it was too cold. And if one was in that area, there would’ve been hundreds of sightings before – they have to surface a lot to breathe.’

I felt my entire body go cold. If there was a Mosasaur out there, it was behaving completely wrong. I thanked him and hung up before he could ask more questions.

The day after, walking to the boat, I couldn’t stop thinking about everything, the fish, the mosasaur, the lot. I tried to ignore it, like Fred had warned me, but I couldn’t. And with that, came more mangled fish. Some were turned inside out, some were fleshy skeletons dripping with gore, and some were forcefully flipped until their spine broke. I couldn’t stop thinking about it, no matter how many times I was implored to. The others started pulling them up too.

Then, the ocean itself called out to me.

‘Buddy.’ It was my father’s voice. Such distance that it barely resonated. It was coming from below.

I peered over, seeing nothing but the inky dark of the ocean depths. Something was off.

‘Buddy!’ He called again.

It definitely came from underwater, but it sounded like he was just calling from a distance.

My eyes went wide.

‘Hey, Bud, why don’t you come down here! It’ll be fun!’ My dad never called me Buddy, and that made my skin crawl.

I saw a flicker of movement in the darkness, too quick to make out.

I forced myself away from the rails until we got back to shore.

The day after was yesterday.

The way out was nerve wracking, and the mauling didn’t end.

We only caught 3 useable fish before the waves calmed again. It was a slow change, one that you wouldn’t notice unless you paid attention. The clouds darkened. Thunder rumbled in the distance.

‘Storm, Captain. Shall we head home?’ Gary spoke for the first time.

‘We need a few more fish! We hold out until then!’ He yelled; beads of sweat formed on his forehead.

The storm drew closer, the waves got rougher, and rain started to fall. We got one more fish before it hit us.

The storm was ravenous. It churned the ocean like it was boiling. It rent us still with winds so strong you couldn’t see., and the sun was all but gone, only lightning illuminated the ocean.

Through a flash, I saw the Mosasaur’s head breach the water, its groan barely audible in the wind.

‘WE NEED TO LEAVE!’ I screamed at Fred, who was already firing up the engines.

Another flash. The Mosasaur was twice as close.

The engines sputtered, then died.

A cold wash pooled from my chest. The only thoughts I had now were of my empty coffin lowering into the ground. ‘Died at sea’

A third flash, the thunder split my ears. Something was floating on the surface. Steeling all my strength, I forced myself over to the edge and peered out as it drifted closer.

It was the Mosasaur. Its top and bottom jaws, swapped. Eyes, gouged out and hanging into the water. Fin bones, protruding. A spine, broken. The lightning gave glimpses of a deep, red blood pouring from missing flesh. The Mosasaur was mangled.

‘IS THAT THE SHARK?’ Ben asked.

‘THAT’S CLEARLY A WHALE! A LONG DEAD ONE!’ Gary chimed in.

I didn’t refute. I was too afraid. The wind had been muffled by a constant ringing.

Then another one’s head popped out of the water.

Then another.

More kept appearing, their snouts pointed up at the inky sky. The rain fell harder, water rolling around the boat as it rocked viscously. Now, there were thousands of them.

***GROAN***

They all voiced at once, accompanied by wisps of another, quieter sound. They called into the storm, and I covered my ears. An extremely large wave then rocked the boat, and I lost my footing.

‘SON!’ Fred screamed, still trying in vain to start the engines. I felt one of the rods scratch my arm as I tumbled overboard.

I crashed beneath the surface, the sudden cold seizing my muscles. I tried to surface, gasping what little air I could. My muscles tired. I sunk below the waves.

The mangled mosasaur was gone.

Instead, millions more looked up at me from the abyss. My eyes, blurred and stung from the salt, darted as I spun around beneath the waves.

As my lungs burned, they stared at me with a familiar gaze. Their eyes were too intelligent. Too Human.

They slowly advanced, creeping towards my trembling, freezing form. My tears mixed with the salt water.

I looked down and saw an impenetrable blackness rising from underneath them. The presence bored a hole into my body. It felt as if the void itself stared at me as I stared into it.

I was seconds from passing out when all the mosasaurs snapped in my direction. Then, they each spoke in unison, mouths moving with the words.

***WAKE UP***

Next thing I know, I’m on the boat, hacking up seawater. The clouds were lighter.

I stood up.

‘Nice to see ya awake, kid!’ Ben said, smiling.

I recoiled. I didn’t understand how he was so calm.

‘Did we make it out the storm? How am I back in the boat?’

Both ben and Gary paused.

‘What storm? And you never went overboard. You feeling okay?’ Gary spoke, head cocked. I looked away, catching a smile from Ben. A smile unusually stiff. Forced.

When the boat got back to port, I ran home, locked myself in my room, and started typing this.

I know I’m going to sound crazy, but I’m going back out there. I’m going to work tomorrow and I’m heading back especially with what I’ve written, but I’m going back out there. Something in me… Feels obligated to, I can’t explain it. Despite that, I feel as if I’ve gained its fervour.

Even now, I feel it looking at me, stare burning into my skin.

I don’t know what I awoke, nor why, but what I do know is that it is not any animal. I’m determined to find out. I want to know why it seems to have chosen me.

If I find anything interesting, I’ll post again.

Though, still, I feel like that by knowing about it, and sharing that knowledge, I’m pleasing It. Like this is exactly what it wants. If that truly is the case, I’m sorry, but I have to take that risk.
