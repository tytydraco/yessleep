What follows is a recollection.  Many people post many stories in many places, but this happened to me. For whatever it's worth, I need to share this with you all.

Ghost Story

“Be quiet, sweet boy.  Daddy is really tired, and he doesn’t like to be woken up.”

I nodded, and silently continued adding and subtracting fractions on the worksheet in front of me. My pace through the work was brisk, and in just a few minutes I was finished.  My brother took advantage of my pencil’s rest to ask me a question.

“How do you do multiplication?  Nine times eight takes too long.”

I glanced over at my father, laid across the couch. He shifted, he mumbled “shut the fuck, you two. Go outside.”

“But I’m not done with my homework yet, dad” my brother said. Nick never did know when to be quiet.

“Get the fuck outside,” my father said, his foot lashing out to kick the coffee table. The French onion dip that had been sitting on it burst open on the carpet. “Clean it the fuck up!” he screamed. “I can’t get a fucking minute to myself in this fucking house!” he bellowed, shifting himself from the lying position to a standing one. Apparently, being the manager of an arcade was exhausting work.

My brother and I ran for the door, the clatter of the screen door making note of our escape into the summer sun as my father’s ire turned towards our mother. I knew she’d clean up the dip… and I knew she’d need new eyeshadow before the day was out.

The backyard was inhabited by imaginary fairies and teeming with adventure. The heroes and villains in the backyard were easier to define, and our time there was the highlight of our years at that house. The grapevines crawling across the trellis, the shed where we waged imaginary wars against fictional armies. The garden, where lola was master and commander of all things growing.

I walked over to the garden, breathing a bit heavily from the sprint out the door. Lola was hunched over, pulling weeds with a vigor that belied her wizened appearance. She spoke no English, and my Tagalog was very poor. “Lola, can I help?” I said, mimicking the weeding motion she was making. She nodded and smiled. We could still hear the bursts of rage coming from the house. I know she heard it, but she just motioned for my brother and I to start pulling weeds. I pulled, and a dandelion snapped at the soil line. Lola smiled at me, and gently took my hands and showed me how to dig deeper, and pull the roots of the invasive plant from the earth. She threw her hands up and re-illustrated how to properly weed after I made the same mistake with the next one. Once I’d mastered the technique, she motioned to the green peppers and gave a thumbs up and a smile. I think she was telling me that the weeding made the green peppers happy. In my mind, we were stopping the yellow-crowned orcish invaders from destroying the peaceful green pepper tribe.

The memories of lola all followed the same script. I wish there was some nuance to make this story hit harder, but the truth of it is that she was the kindest and most patient human God ever put on this earth. She taught me to pray. Taught me to care for things that can’t care for themselves. Like green peppers. Her brightly colored headscarf has been a totem throughout my life; beauty in the face of pain. It wasn’t until I was in my 30s that I even knew she had been fighting cancer in those years. I still don’t know why her lack of hair never stood out to me then.  

One night, I woke up suddenly. The moon was streaming through the window, washing the room in a relaxed luminescence that felt calming. At the foot of my bed, lola was standing. She looked at me with her head scarf, and wrinkles, and serene smile. She held her finger to her lip and mouthed something I could translate this time. She told me that everything would be ok.

I found out the next day that she had died the evening prior. She wasn’t even at home, she had been at my cousin’s brownstone thirty minutes away. I never told anyone about her visiting me that night. And no matter what life took or gave to me, no matter how far I drifted from spirituality or wonder, I have never once doubted that this beautiful woman, my lola, had come to say goodbye that night.
