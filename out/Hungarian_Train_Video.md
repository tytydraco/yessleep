There are many mysterious videos on the internet. But none are as perplexing as the Hungarian Train Video! This video is about a NIC Rába train on March 26, 1986, on its way from Csorna to Budapest. but it got hijacked and it was never seen again! And the trains were shortly discontinued.  
  
And nobody has ever known why! until the year 2006. Because found footage of what happened on the NIC Rába train was uploaded to YouTube! And it was alleged to be filmed on a Krasnogorsk-4 camera. And it filmed the passengers on the train looking out the window worried!  Before a bright blue light floods the train car through the windows before the passengers start screaming! Before they eventually stop as the light goes away the train car is completely empty and the video ends!  
  
And after a few days the video was deleted! And even the way back machine somehow is unable to find remnants of this video! So basically only a few people know about this video and even fewer have seen it! And what makes this a strange piece of lost media. is that many people who have come forward to help give info about this video disappear after they talk about it!  
  
So that’s where the search was alleged to end! A video that could never be seen again! That was until recently! Because a few weeks ago I was checking out an archive footage section at Bundesarchiv archives in Germany! Now I was there to see if there was any footage of surviving Jewish films pre-WW2 when I found an unmarked VHS tape.  
  
Out of curiosity I played it. And holy shit it’s the Hungarian Train video! And surprisingly it was a lot longer than what was posted on YouTube back in 2006. I think this was because the unedited version was longer than 15 minutes and this was released in 2006 on YouTube! It had to be trimmed down to meet the length restrictions. back when you could only upload 15-minute videos!  
  
And the beginning of the unedited Hungarian Train Video started with the camera man talking to an elderly Jewish woman.the whole interview was in Hungarian so from what I could translate the interview. The cameraman said “ma’am I heard you were one of the people relocated here!” the old woman said “yes when I arrived here I was separated from my sister!” the camera man then asked “were you on trains like this?” the elderly woman paused for a second and said “they weren't as nice as this train!” that was so far what i could translate from this because time has not been kind to this VHS tape! So, the audio was pretty scratchy and hard to make out and the video quality is also scratchy, and it sometimes is hard to make out many of the details in the footage!  
  
But it was about 5 minutes into the footage. when I saw the elderly woman's face go from somber to scared! The man asked the woman “ma’am what is the problem?” the woman did not answer, she just pointed to the window! And when the camera turned towards the window, I saw what appeared to be an ufo. Which I was kinda not surprised by! And after ten seconds the rest of the train looks at the windows and as I said earlier a blue light flash in, and the passengers start screaming before they all disappear and the blue light fades!  
  
But instead of the video ending there like the YouTube version. It shows the aliens enter on the train they looked almost like humans but off! Like they had blank lifeless faces and were bald and had slender physique! And then one of the aliens grabs the camera and inspects it before exiting the train and throwing it at a rock! And before the video ends you can hear a distorted sound of what appeared to be them lifting the train!  
  
After I had finished this video, I smuggled it out of Bundesarchiv archives and back to the UK and currently I am having a friend who doesn't want to be named for obvious reasons restoring the Hungarian Train Video! I’ll update you if anything notable happens! See you later!
