If you're reading this, read it away from religious people, I don't want them to be upset for they might do what they did to me. Before I tell you what to do I want to introduce myself and tell you my story. I am Amy, I am 20 years old. Growing up I've always been in my house, I never get to go out alone like the kids on the internet because my parents are afraid that something will come back for me, they never told me what and why I just assumed that it might be a wild animal since we live somewhere in the forest, Tho I get bored of this house I didn't want to go out because I'm scared that the thing my parents are afraid of might come after me, Until one day I decided to be brave and go out to find houses to trick or treat for Halloween, I dressed up as a ghost also hoping that by doing so, the thing after me would be scared. Unfortunately, my parents caught me and thought that the thing has already come to me, I was locked in the basement for days until a priest came, they said that I needed help and need to be exorcised, I'd heard about it on tv shows but I'm confused because there wasn't a demon inside me, They began to chant words that didn't make any sense. I thought that I would float like those on tv and die, luckily for me I survived, and this is how I did it.

They started stabbing me with a cross. don't scream or yell or beg for them to stop, it will only make them wanna hurt you more.
They started ripping off my clothes, I called my mom and dad for help but the other priest took them away. The priest started untying me from the chair and brought me to the table, He tried to tie my hand to the table but luckily for me, I escaped. If they did this to you, you want to bite their hand or do anything to stop them from tying you. The priest started to run toward me and pushed me down, he started to remove his clothes and I heard gunshots coming from outside. the other priest came, and he held my hand down. The priest started to sniff my neck and I reached for his ears and bite them, it made him stop for a while and the other priest just stared at him. I ran up out of the basement and the other priest tried to catch me, I saw my parents lying on the floor, dead. Now when you see something like this, don't cry, and don't go to check them, or else they'll catch up to you. Unfortunately for me, I cried so the other priest catches up, What I did was run for my mom's phone and hide. I hid in the attic. Now what you should do is dial 911 and tell them what happened.  After the call The other priest found me, and there was no escape, He tried to get me so I jumped out of the window. I heard the police and ambulance siren and I fell unconscious. 

I woke up in a hospital bed, I smiled. I finally get to go somewhere alone. This happened 3 years ago, I'm sharing my story to warn and help people from evil. Evil isn't always ugly or look like how it did on tv, They can disguise themselves as beautiful and trustful people.
