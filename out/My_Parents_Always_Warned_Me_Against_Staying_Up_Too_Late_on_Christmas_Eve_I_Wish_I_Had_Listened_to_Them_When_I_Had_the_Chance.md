Every child who celebrates Christmas is, at one time or another, overcome with the intense desire to catch Santa Claus in the midst of his yearly routine. Most parents advise against creeping out of bed and snooping around on that most sacred of nights; as children, we believe it to be a certain taboo to spy on the Big Man while he works, but most adults understand the real reason for our parents’ warnings is simply to preserve our belief in the wonder and magic of Christmas. Nothing saps the joy out of the holiday faster than learning that what you’ve thought to be the deeds of a fat man in red are actually being enacted by your own parents after they believe you to be well into your Christmas Eve slumber. The reason I say that *most* adults believe this to be true, is because there are those of us who know that it is not. I, and others like me, know the true reason that we’ve been told for generations to keep ourselves hidden away in bed when the Big Man comes to visit. While *we* know The Truth, most other adults, those who always obeyed their parents and who had never once thought about snooping on old Kris Kringle during his yearly haunt, remain in blissful ignorance of it for their entire lives. Believe me when I say that there isn’t a single thing I wouldn’t give to be a part of the other camp.

I should say that not *every* child who creeps out of their bedroom on Christmas Eve is exposed to The Truth — in fact, most of them never are, and never will be, even when they enter adulthood and eventually learn their own version of the ‘truth’ about Santa. Most of them experience that *other* scenario, the one that ruins their perspective of Christmas in a devastating, but wholly natural way. Most families are not ‘in the know’, as it were, about the most well-kept secret of the Holiday Season; I, and others like me, are simply unfortunate enough to be among those unlucky few who bear the burden that the rest of you do not.

A burden that, after decades of silence brought on by an overwhelming fear for the wellbeing of myself and those around me, I am finally willing to pass on.

I learned of The Truth on that fateful December night, in the unfortunate year of 1957, at the young, impressionable age of eight years old. My parents, as I write this now long gone from this mortal plane, had offered that usual warning to me on every Christmas Eve that I am able to remember. It wasn’t until the year in question that I saw it fit to disregard such a warning; I still remember thinking about how grown up I was that year, the early signs of adolescence already making their way into my strengthening ego, and I had decided with utmost certainty that I knew what was best for myself (far better than my parents could have, anyway) on that bitterly cold Christmas Eve night. And so, with this belief held firmly within me and driving my every action, I proceeded to fake my slumber until the time came for me to crawl from the warmth of my bed and step barefoot onto the cold wooden surface of my bedroom floor.

I crept through the icy darkness, going from my bedroom out into the shadows of the hallway with the stealth of a banshee hovering through a snow-smothered graveyard. Moving with the silence of death, I slowly made my way down the hallway, past what was once my sister’s room, now cold and empty for several years, and toward the stairwell, careful not to place my weight onto any of the floorboards that I knew were eager to give me away. Reaching the stairs, I began a cautious-yet-hasty descent which was fueled by my fear of running into my parents before reaching the bottom. I breathed an inaudible sigh of relief when I reached the ground floor undiscovered, and, unwilling to rest on these meager laurels, scurried into the waiting shadows of the nearby dining room. From the dining room I made my way into our living room, where our meager, sparsely-decorated Christmas tree rested beneath a heavy curtain of festering gloom. Glossy baubles glistened with the diminutive light of nearby electric candles, which had been placed all about the house by my mother in the early days of the month in order to provide some nighttime ambiance to the festive season. These I expected to find aglow, as she usually left them on even after  she had retired to bed herself. What I *didn’t* expect to see glowing, though, was the fireplace on the other side of the room.

I frowned at the small fire cracking in the hearth, which was so modest that it barely managed to produce enough light to chase away the shadows lingering just beyond its open maw. Why the fireplace would be lit on Christmas Eve at *all*, even with such a pitiful blaze as that one, was beyond me. Surely everybody, my parents included, knew that Santa Claus exclusively enters homes through their chimneys, and if this one was pumping out even the slightest bit of smoke and heat, it would certainly deter the Big Man from coming inside and completing his self-imposed duty. I briefly considered snuffing out the threatening blaze, not realizing at the time that such an act would expose my nighttime adventure, when a sudden noise coming from above me drew my attention away from this poorly hatched plan. I heard the subtle sound of the excitable floorboards that I had so carefully avoided earlier beginning to creak one after the other. Soon this disturbance drifted to the stairwell, and I knew that one or both of my parents would shortly discover me in the living room. With a sudden panic rising inside of me, I rushed to a nearby trunk which rested flush against the arm of the resident sofa; normally stuffed with heavy blankets that now sat layered atop our beds, I knew it would have enough space within its confines to fit my little frame.

I quietly but quickly reached the trunk and climbed inside, pulling shut its lid just as the footsteps reached the bottom of the stairs. I was consumed by an absolute darkness that somehow amplified the relative silence of the house, which in turn contrasted those approaching footsteps, making them even louder. The sound of movement infested the living room; I knew that I would surely remain undiscovered if I kept the trunk’s lid shut, but, being overwhelmed by the curiosity of an eight-year-old boy, I slightly raised the lid above my head, allowing myself just enough space to look out into the room without too greatly risking my own exposure.

The positioning of my hiding spot allowed me to see a vast majority of the living room, which included the active fireplace, as well as the gloom-soaked Christmas tree, and beyond it the short hallway led to the front entrance of our home. Shuffling through the shadows were two figures that, despite the deep darkness, I managed to identify as my parents. They had set to work arranging things beneath the tree; as an adult I understand that they were preparing my Christmas presents, but the still-naive mind of my child self was confused as to what they were up to down there, out of their bed so close to Santa’s arrival. I think a part of me understood what they were doing, even if I didn’t want to grapple with the implications of what I saw; thankfully I wouldn’t have much time to consider any of this before what happened next sent landscape-altering shockwaves through my mind that it has yet to fully recover from, even all these decades later.

It began with the flickering of the artificial candles, which started rapidly blinking like fireflies on the hottest nights of summer. A sudden dance of undulating shadows drew my attention to the fireplace, where I saw its blaze guttering and spitting with what looked to be an unseen wind, hellbent on snuffing out the struggling flame. It quickly succeeded. With the fire’s death came a sudden, overwhelming chill that seemed to wash the room in a shadowy blue hue, and which looked to make the nearby Christmas tree begin to wilt. The change in temperature would have set my teeth to chattering if I didn’t physically force my jaw to remain still, the fear of being discovered giving me the strength to fight the great cold. I looked back at my parents who, in the uneven light of the flickering candles, shared a knowing glance that told me something they had long-anticipated had finally arrived.

Three loud, world-shaking knocks at the front door confirmed this fresh belief. All six eyes in the room darted toward the small foyer, where a fresh howling wind began relentlessly rattling the heavy wooden door. My parents shared one more glance before they began their cautious walk toward the entrance, my father leading the way while my mother came quickly behind him. They hesitated in the serene winter silence for only a brief moment before my father grabbed the door’s cold brass handle, turned the knob, and pulled the thing open, exposing the precipice between two worlds.

The gusting wind brought wet grasps of snow in through the doorway, which landed at my parents’ feet without either of them seeming to notice. Their bodies largely obscured the figure that stood on the other side of the threshold, but they couldn’t possibly hide its entire massive form. The entity, which towered to the very top of the doorframe and filled either end of the space with its girth, easily dwarfed my father, who I had always thought was the tallest man in the entire world up until that very moment. It wore a thick, puffy coat of either bright red or forest green, its colors seeming to change and meld with each flicker of the many blinking candles that continued to transmit their eerie Morse code of light. A thick beard, white as a ghost and brimming with just as much terrifying malice, mingled with its red-green form and grew so long that it disappeared behind my parents’ standing bodies.

Neither my parents nor the entity moved for what felt like many more decades than I have since lived. My parents never stepped out of the way to allow the thing to step inside; it never made an attempt to move beyond the icy threshold of the doorway. For a while I thought this frigid standoff might continue well into the coming of the next sunrise (assuming any form of dawn existed beyond the reality of that dark, dark night), but then the entity raised its thick, imposing arm, and seemed to offer my parents something that I could not quite see. My father was the first to take this object into his waiting hands, and as he did so, he shifted his body in such a way that gave me a better view of the thing in his hand. I could see it was a knife: long, slender, its blueish metal blade looking to be even more cold than the harsh winter night which threatened our home from just beyond that fragile precipice.

My father looked down at the weapon in his hand for several long seconds. When he was satisfied with its visage, he used that icy blade to roll up the sleeve of his opposite arm, after which he lined up the blade with the fragile flesh of his newly exposed forearm. Then, without more than a fractional moment of hesitation, he began to cut.

The knife glided along my father’s arm from the center of his forearm all the way up to the hollow of his elbow. He pulled the knife away, exposing the fresh line of blood which eagerly escaped from his opened arm while its counterpart dripped from the tip of the tainted blade, landing on the floor in gentle, splashing pitters. I watched in horror, my hand drawn over my mouth, as my father offered his young aperture to the entity waiting in the doorway. The figure looked down at the incision with an unknowable number of eyes that I could not see from beyond the influence of its uncontrollable white beard. Then it lowered its face to the wound and it promptly began to drink.

The long, white tendrils of the entity’s beard wrapped themselves around my father’s arm like creeping vines of kudzu while the thing robbed him of his crimson lifeforce. My father didn’t seem to mind the horrific violation of his body while the entity drank, but I could see him begin to sway slightly as the vitality quickly drained from him. The winter chill, which had seemingly been kept at bay by the entity, swarmed into the house as the thing continued to swallow, turning the entire foyer and much of the space beyond into a thick curtain of ice and snow. 

My father looked ready to pass out by the time the entity finally released him from his torment. It pulled its face away from his wound, the living tendrils of its beard coming with it. Vermillion stained the white fur and dripped onto the hardwood floor, mimicking the liquid falling from the knife. My father, staggering slightly, had to brace himself against the nearby wall of ice, but he managed to stay on his feet. The entity watched as my father stabilized himself, then turned its attention to my waiting mother, who had stood motionless while the thing had fed upon her accepting spouse. My father handed her the knife, which she took without robbing her gaze from the entity, and the strange ritual resumed.

With her free hand, my mother pulled away her shirt collar, fully exposing her neck and shoulder. She then ran the knife from just below her jawline to the edge of her shoulder, creating a scarlet line that matched the one on my father’s arm. She lowered the knife to her side and leaned forward, offering the glistening slash to the watching entity.

It leaned down and began to drink. 

The entity's living beard wrapped around my mother's torso like the many tentacles of a great kraken effortlessly pulling a ship down into the abyss. My mother went limp in the feeding creature’s embrace, while my father watched hopelessly as his wife was drained of her very essence. When the entity was done, it released my mother's weakened body, which tumbled to the floor in a violent heap. My father didn't go to her aid.

The entity ducked even lower, reaching its body toward my mother's collapsed form. I thought for a moment that it meant to devour her, but instead it picked up the knife, which had clattered to the floor following her collapse, with one of its ivory tendrils. The tentacle brought the blade into the mass of squirming white, swallowing it up completely, and the entity returned to its full, looming height.

The bearded figure stood deathly still in the doorway for several long, agonizing moments. It remained sentinel over the defeated forms of my parents, not seeming to care or notice as my mother gasped for air from her crumpled position on the ground, or as my father struggled to stay on his feet while leaning against the heroic-yet-frigid wall. I held my breath as I watched the scene in front of me, wondering what would come next, praying that it would be over soon. As if answering my prayers, the entity began moving itself out of the doorframe with a series of heavy, lumbering backwards steps; its thick boots slammed against the ground and its metal belt buckle jingled with the momentum as it went. Never once did it turn away or show its back to my parents while it slowly receded into the darkness. And though I couldn’t see its eyes (or truly any real face to speak of) I was somehow certain that it was looking past them, through the slight gap in the trunk, straight into my icy, terrified gaze.

The frigid blueness that had infested our home receded with the entity; the artificial candles ceased their flickering and returned to their normal, solid glow, the icy surface of the surrounding walls quickly thawed with the fresh warmth, and the Christmas tree even seemed to perk back up to its former glory. The fireplace suddenly came back to life with the blaze that had once lived there, quickly chasing away any cold that still remained. My father, seemingly coming back to his body just as the entity disappeared into the winter night, struggled his way along the wall to the front door, which he slammed shut with all of his strength. He then sank to his knees beside the desecrated form of my mother and wrapped both of his arms around her slouched, shivering shoulders. The two of them sat there like that for what must have been at least half the night, crying softly into each other’s cold, goosebumped flesh.

They eventually snuffed out the flame in the fireplace and made their way back up to their bedroom. When I was certain that they were gone, I cautiously climbed my way out of the trunk (it felt more to me like escaping from a lonely coffin) and crept my way through the dining room and back upstairs to my waiting bed. I crawled beneath those cold covers and hid there for the rest of the night, not sleeping, not even really trying to. When day finally came, my parents, surprised by my lack of enthusiasm for Christmas morning, entered my room and asked me what was wrong. I told them I felt too sick to get out of bed (only partially a lie), and spent the entire holiday hidden beneath the relative safety and warmth of my comforter.

The memory of that terrible entity, permanently branded on my mind, remained at the forefront of my thoughts for the entirety of that day, and crept just beneath the surface of my nightmares for many long months to come. The arrival of the next Christmas Eve filled me with an indescribable dread, but, much to my relief, I didn’t see that horrible entity again that year, nor any years hence. For a few years I tried to convince myself that what I had seen that night had only been a nightmare, but I never managed to actually believe this rather unconvincing lie.

I had doubled in age by the time my parents finally decided to trust me with the full extent of The Truth. They sat me down and told me that our family is among the unlucky few that sometimes get visited on Christmas Eve by an ancient and terrible presence, and that the best thing we can do to preserve the safety of our loved ones as well as ourselves is to compliantly give the presence the sacrifice that it demands. Sometimes that sacrifice is an offering of blood. Sometimes it is an offering of much, much more. They didn’t tell me about the night that I have just recounted, nor of any other potential visitations of the entity, and I never confessed to them what I had witnessed. To their dying days, they never knew that I had seen them complete the sacrifice that night. I think things were better this way; easier. Both for them, as well as for me.

I write this now in what I know are the final years of my life. Exactly how many I have left is a close-kept secret known only to the Reaper, but I’m certain that he has long-since tipped the hourglass, and that the ultimate grains of sand are at last finding their way to the bottom of their eternal vessel. I don’t have very many Christmas Eves left, and though I have managed to avoid seeing that entity in the many decades since that horrible night, I find myself burdened with the surest sense that it yet intends to return for me, so that it can look upon my terrified gaze one last time, just like it did back on that dark winter night from my boyhood. I don’t know what sacrifice it will expect of me on that not-so-distant date, but I get the feeling that the entity is very much in the know when it comes to the Reaper’s terrible secret, and in fact may even factor into the Great Cloaked One’s ultimate design.

But these are just the tired speculations of an old, mortal man, who has spent the vast majority of his life dreading a holiday that brings so many others such great degrees of joy (if not equal degrees of stress). I cannot know for certain if and when I will ever see that entity again, much like I can’t know for certain when my inevitable end will come; at least not until that long-dreaded moment when it finally decides to arrive.

All I can do is hope that these two nearing meridians, both seemingly so distinct and different, are not actually one and the same.
