I was working in the ER as an RN. We were a Level 1 Trauma ER so we got the worst accidents, falls, gun shot wounds, motor vehicle accidents, animal attacks etc. One evening we had an incoming motorcycle accident with a male driver coming in. In the trauma bay we had slabs on one post so staff could be all around the patient. He came in, we coded him but the trauma was too extensive and he was pronounced. The staff leaves and awaiting the Medical Examination to make the removal for autopsy.

Looking back at the patient I saw what looked like rays of light around someone standing by his body. I couldn't see the person but could see the light around them. Obviously female and very upset pounding her arms on his body, turning around in frustration, shaking her arms in the air and returning to pound on the slab and his body he was on. I heard no sound but felt like a slight electric tingle sensation. Back and forth from the slab with the body and walking away shaking her arms, but just seeing the light like in 18 inch rays around her.

I centered my attention on her and opened myself up to the situation. I saw what looked like photographs, fanned out like playing cards before me flowing in front of me of two on a motorcycle riding, losing balance and the motorcycle crash. Maybe 100 snap shot photo like images flowed before me creating the scene of the accident.

I could clearly see the man driving and a woman behind him on the motorcycle. The crash she went flying far and landed by a small hill of dirt by the side of the high way. He didn't fall that far from where the bike crashed. My feeling was she was the passenger and didn't make it either. I wondered where she was taken. Sometimes in accidents of multiple people they spread them out over several near by hospitals to not overwhelm the trauma staff. I assumed she was taken to another hospital and came to see her friend in spirit.

Police were still in he hospital doing paper work. I went to one of them and asked about a passenger. He said this was a lone rider. I didn't say what I saw but asked if it's possible there could be another person on scene. The officer gave me a frown and said he could see if there was. I told him their might be a female thrown farther behind a small hill of dirt farther from the highway. He called the officers still on the accident scene. They had assumed he was a lone rider but they did find a body of a female nearly torn in half farther away by a dirt pile exactly as I described. He didn't ask me how I knew and I didn't say.

My feeling is she died on impact but he was still officially alive when they brought him in to the ER. Maybe she as soul followed him from the accident scene to the ER and somehow missed his soul leaving and was trying to revive his body. I felt a calmness and like a wave of relief when her body was found. I went back to the slab and his body had been removed to the morgue still waiting for removal for autopsy. I didn't see her again. I did feel a comforting and calming presence and sent them both recognition as soul to soul adding a blessing of love.
