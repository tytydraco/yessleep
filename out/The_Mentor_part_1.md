I suppose I will start at the beginning. I can't believe I had forgotten all this or maybe
subconsciously I had blocked it out. In any case it all seems so clear now. Well some of it is. I
thought maybe if I put it all down I would see something I missed. Maybe someone out there
will see something I didn't. In any case it couldn't hurt to have fresh eyes on this event. Anything
that might help me get out of here.


I was eleven I think or maybe twelve the first time I saw him. My mother worked for a janitorial
service for a local college. In the afternoon after I got out of school. I would have to hang out
around the school until her shift was over. For the most part it was extremely boring. That is until
I was sitting out in the hallway at the end of a row of classrooms. 

A strange man walked right
up to where I was sitting. I was looking down at my gameboy color when I glanced up to see two
shiny polished penny loafers right in front of me. The penny loafers belonged to a tall rail thin
man with a stern looking expression. “What are you doing out here young man?” The
man’s voice was firm but calm. “I,I umm I.” I stammered. The man's face started to crack into a
smile. “ I'm just messing with you my young friend. He said as he leaned down to my level.
“You're the janitor's son right?” I just nodded my head up and down. “Yeah I've seen you around
before.”

 We just shared an awkward silence for a moment. “Do you like science?” He said,
looking through me. 

“yeah who doesn't?" I said with perhaps a little too much enthusiasm.
“Well next week my class is going to dissect frogs and we always have a few leftovers. Would
you want to dissect one?” my face lit up. “Yeah that would be awesome,” I said.” i mean i liked
frogs and didn't really want to dissect one but anything would be sitting out in the hallway while
my mom cleaned up the classrooms.


“We will have to ask your mom if she’s ok with it but if so next week we will do it..” “That’d be
cool I said” trying to regain my cool guy attitude. Even though he had a sort of Batman villain’s
physique. There was a warmth to his presence and smile. I felt instantly like I had made a new
friend. Which was not a common feeling for me.


Just then my mom emerged from a classroom and she was shocked to see us standing
together. “I'm sorry he wasn't bothering you was he?” i shot her a {what the fuck} look? I didn't
bother anyone or anything? Before my out rage could boil over my new friend replied. “No not at
all mam I was just telling him I might have a few leftover frogs we could dissect . He could do a
little science with me if you don't mind. 

She looked at me and then back to the man. “Ohh
forgive me my name is pete. I'm sorry I should have said that. He held out his hand to my mom.
“Umm yeah that sounds good.” She said, shaking his hand. “It wouldn't hurt him to get off that
game.” she said it with such disgust it made me scoff. I stood and held out my hand and said "I'm Lawrence." Without missing a beat he replied "of Arabia." A joke that sailed clean over my head at the time. I started back confused. 

He just clucked and said "I'm Pete"

That's when it all started.


The following week I strolled into Pete's classroom wearing a smile that stretched from ear to
ear. I’d been looking forward to this for days. I didn't see Pete when I first entered the room. As
my eyes searched the classroom a voice called from a supply closet in the corner of the room.

“I wondered when you would show up.” His voice met me from across the room. He emerged
from the small supply closet with a metal tray with a frog sprawled out in it.” yeah i thought i was
too late.” Pete sat the tray on the examination table. “Nonsense my boy you're right on time."

He
opened a small case next to the frog that held a scalpel and a few other small tools I didn't
recognise.

 "So you're going to take this scalpel and make an incision here." He pointed with his
index finger. I took the scalpel in my hand and went about making the incision. I took the tip of
the scalpel and pressed it to the spot he had pointed at. The thin skin gave way under the razor
shape blade. In just a moment the organs were exposed. Pete pointed out the various organs.


“You have a steady hand.” I shrugged. “I guess so.”
“I had a steady hand when I was a young man.” he held up his exaggerated shaking hand and
we both laughed. 

“You will make a skilled surgeon or an infamous serial killer.” I chuckled ,
smiling broadly.
“Thanks I guess.”

We became fast friends after that. Whenever I had to sit around waiting for my mom to be done
with her shift he would find me. We would always find something to do whether it was looking in
the college science books or him just telling me old street jokes while we watched the geese
flying around the pond on the campus. An adult had never paid me so much attention. It was
pretty cool. I had never had an adult that I felt like I could truly call my friend.

He was maybe the smartest person I had ever met and he thought I was smart as well. Despite how poor my grades were in school. I couldn't see why then but he told me I was special and I was going to do big things. 

I wish I would have paid more attention and seen the signs. On one of our visits I noticed red speckles on his white shirt collar. I asked him if he or someone in the class was hurt today. 

"No of course not my boy." Just a little spray from one the specimens. 

I never questioned it. How could have been so clueless. There was no blood in the specimens that were diceted. I should have seen it then.

My mother was always working and tired. My father was a farmer and very busy. He would take
me with him to work on the farm sometimes but he thought me odd turned and didn't care to tell
me so.  I think I was so happy to have a friend I blinded to what was right in front of me.

One day Pete found me sitting in the hall and called out from the end of the hallway. “I
have a surprise for you!” I got up and followed him to his classroom.


I sat down in a chair next to his desk and he wheeled in a tv strapped to a rolling cart with a vhs
player built in. “Sometimes at lunch I will watch a tape from my personal collection.” I just stared
back at him, not sure where he was going with this. “Do you like comedy?”
“Yeah for sure!” Pete walked over to a row of vhs tapes stacked on a shelf. “I think I'll show you
something from my time. He put his index finger and thumb on his chin. “Mhmm what can I
show you without breaking the rules.”
“Oh I got it”. He said and slid a Vhs into the player. The speakers of the TV crackled and after a
moment and title flashed across the screen. Sam Kinsion’s Breaking the rules. 

We laughed until
I thought I was going to cry. Some of the jokes went over my head at that age but I still enjoyed
it. “Maybe don't tell your mom we watched this one huh champ?
“Yeah for sure, does he have other tapes?” “He sure does and the next time I see you we will
watch the other ones.” I stood up and got ready to find my mom. It was about time for her shift
to end. “Hey are you coming to the school halloween party?” “yeah as long as my mom lets me.”

"Good,good. I have something special planned for you" cool I can't wait to see" I waved goodbye as I walked out. 

I didn't know it then but that Halloween party would change the course of my life. 

Well gotta go. My times up. The guard gets pissy if I'm not ready to go back to my cell when he comes in here. I will write again soon. As long as I don't get put in the hole again for fighting my cellmate over ramen noodles.

Seriously though getting my story out might help prove my innocence. So I will continue the story soon.
