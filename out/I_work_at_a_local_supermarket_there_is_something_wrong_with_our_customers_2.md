Hey again, r/nosleep , it's been a bit, about two days, now. Safe to say, I'm not going to be using the work computer anymore, the store manager has made sure of that... so, instead, I'm using my actual PC, from home! 

In advance, before I get into the details of everything that has happened since Wednesday until now, I should start off with a massive thanks to people for offering advice, even a single bit of engagement helps me not feel isolated as I get thrust into this weird and discomforting new reality. 

There were a few people who noted that the Graveyard Shift seem off, safe to say, I have an answer, but not a major one. Another reckoned that maybe the weird pair of customers (or "Consumers", as I will call them) are Aliens, I'm not sure, I kind of hope not. Lastly, it was advised for me to keep details on anything out of the ordinary at work. 

Also, for anyone who is completely confused, please read my first post (linked beneath this), to get caught up on... well, everything.   
[The Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kr1yzt/i_work_at_a_local_supermarket_there_is_something/)

Otherwise, let's continue.

There's a lot that has happened, I will be completely honest. I think I will jot it down in a list just below this sentence for all the events that have transpired:  

\- David (the Store Manager, my boss)   
*David has added a surveillance camera to the Communications Office, apparently he does not want anyone besides rostered workers in that or his office at any time besides for meetings, breaks, performing admin work or clocking in and out.* 

*He also gave Sarah a thorough earful for her staying back on Monday, from the sounds of it, he knows something, something that he doesn't want her, or me to know. He's also recently employed his nephew, Jason, who is a right wanker. (I've tried to be nice to him, but he's simply the worst.)* 

I get the feeling, whenever Jason and I are in the same room, that he's watching me. I always get that prickly feel on the back of my neck when I look away from the broccoli haired frat boy... 

\- Kyle (Grocery Manager, my predecessor as Front End ADM)   
Kyle approached me today. He seemed annoyed as he was on Tuesday, but he and I had a conversation, a tense one, but it shed a tiny bit of light. Problem is, I can't explain the contents of it without first going over Wednesday, so I will have to do that first. 

\- Sarah   
*Sarah has been demoted. After David caught on, it seems that something about what her and I did really pissed the boss off, she's been put as a regular Night Fill worker, to add insult to injury, Jason got given her position.*

*The only good thing is that it's given her more time off work, meaning she's started becoming a regular "nuisane" (in the positive way) for me, as she'll usually drop by wearing metal band merch. Metallica, Led Zeppelin, Rob Zombie, and a bunch more obscure ones, honestly did not know that she was a metal head, the more you know...* 

*I can't say where her and I stand, but I enjoy her company, though I always fear some dread when she sends me a message now, asking what the Consumers did the last night.* 

So, with all that aside, I suppose I should start with the day after I last posted, Wednesday.  
The dayshift of Wednesday was normal, the usual collection of people you expect on what some call "hump day", so a bunch of the senior citizens coming in to pay with what pension money they could spare and the usual flood of teenagers spending some of their pocket money on items that I would not have caught myself dead with at their age. 

Around 2pm, only 2 hours into my shift, did David call me to his office, where he introduced me to Jason, can safely say, it was the most uncomfortable and tense welcome meeting I had sat in on. It's not very clear, despite it being just yesterday, but I do remember one thing clearly, Jason's false smile, grinning just too perfectly and staring with completely emotionless eyes, whilst David kept a tense but professional smile, as he looked redder than a tomato on the verge of having an aneurysm. 

'Nathan, this will be Sarah's replacement in the Night Fill team, due to her breaking company standards. This is Jason.' 

He gestured for me to shake Jason's hand, I didn't want to, but I did. Jason's hand was hot, uncomfortably hot, think the type of heat you feel when you have a fever and try to cover yourself with blankets. He was also sweaty, as if he had only just come from the gym. I could already tell I did not like him, even if it had been a year since I last saw him and since Jason had graduated from highschool.

Jason didn't say anything, simply smiling like some creepy doll whilst David rattled on about changes to policy, expectations and my obligations. I can say with certainty that there were a few veiled threats among what David told me. 

I could not for the life of me tell you what he said specifically, but I know that if I want to figure anything more out, I will have to be discrete, unlike Sarah. The one good thing, at least, is that David knows only two things about computers: jack and shit. Not sure when it comes to Jason, but he seems to content with being the top dog of a department for now.

The security terminal, the outdated computer that is hooked up to our security cameras, has an external drive it stores everything on, which is stored in a room behind the Communications office, which only Department Leaders are allowed into. Too bad for David, that includes me. So, considering that the cameras we do have placed in the store, I was able to figure out that the door to the service room behind the Comms office is in a blind spot, with the added addition that our cameras are visual only, it means I can get access to the external drive whenever I want, as long as no one is around. Why am I even doing this, you might ask? To copy the reports the camera makes, to copy over the captures it takes, where it spots something out of the ordinary. Then, to send them to Sarah, keeping her in the loop, even if David wants her out of it for some reason.

Sadly, at the time the idea came to mind, it was while I was training one of our new checkout members on how to use the express terminals on the main counter, which was around 5pm. She was a nice girl, junior hire, since we're getting closer to the busier seasons, so having casuals to call is going to be a must. By 6pm, everyone was heading out and I was put in charge of closing up procedure once more.

It felt weird not waving goodbye to Sarah in the back dock, instead waving goodbye in the middle of the health food aisle, right before Jason ducked in his head to prattle off information at her that she likely already knew. After that, I headed home, but I just couldn't get a good nap in, every time I tried to close my eyes, I saw the neck of the slug man, or the distorted addict, with her misshapen neck and head. I think I was dreading Wednesday night more than anything. 

Mum took notice, though I couldn't be honest with her, she'd suffered enough losing Dad, then having to raise a little boy with a disability on her own. (To anyone interested, it's high function ASD, not the worst, but made my childhood quite the confusing journey.) But I still at least gave her the knowledge that I was worried about the upcoming night shift, making up the reason that simply the customers were a lot more worrisome, without the shopping centre security guard around. 

Like all good mothers, she consoled me and even treated me to some homemade pasta bake, though with me helping prepare the meat and vegetables, since I would never dare to have her do it alone. Of course Coal yowled for meat, so I indulged the inky black blob with some food. He was purring the rest of the night, after that. 

It felt weird to have four hours to burn before work, rather than just taking it as a chance to briefly recharge whatever social energy I had wasted and then get back to it. I decided to get on here, start typing, though I threw away the draft, most it started with was 'I'm dreading tonight', before I closed down reddit and decided to try and catch up on some reading on one of the multiple fantasy novels I owned. It ended up helping a lot, making the dread wash away until the alarm at 10pm came to alert me to throw back on my uniform and head out early to grab dinner.

Much like Monday night, it was foggy, cold and damp. This time around, I had to get dinner from somewhere else than the usual, the burger place I go to was closed for the night, not sure why, but I wouldn't be surprised if the old couple who own it wanted some time off. 

Instead I grabbed a less than decent noodle box from a rather niche petrol station on the way, the noodles were warm, but tasted like cardboard. By the time I was at work, I had thrown the half eaten meal away due to how lacking it was. 

I let myself inside without much noise, Jason was packing up, I tried to ignore him, though I could feel that his gaze followed me as I headed through the stock room and into the break rooms, getting my heavy layers off to be able to provide services. I ensured to clock in at the usual time before then letting in the Graveyard Shift and letting Jason out. Could have sworn he snickered at me, as he left, the more I see him, the more I come to dislike him.

A notable thing is that one of the Graveyard actually stayed behind while the other three headed off to get their gear, this was the same one who was on the register, Cait, older woman, skinny, probably was somewhere in her late 60s. Her usually sullen eyes looked at mine as she made a request that would have been normal for anyone else, but from the usually dead silent Graveyard Shift, it made me feel as if it was a piece of advice, rather than a request. 

'Please don't interact with the customer when I'm serving them, sir.' 

She didn't wait for my response, as she meandered off, walking almost like a corpse, likely to join her co-workers. Up close, I had never realised how insanely tired the Graveyard Shift workers looked... for one, they had insanely baggy eyes, making it look like they had not slept well in years, whilst their skin was wrinkled and tight, something you'd expect from advanced age and stress. Worst of all, their eyes, they were dull, almost lifeless, like those depictions people do of a thousand yard stare. I don't think they are like the Consumers, I think that they are at least in a minor way, human. Though I can't be sure they are able to be called that anymore. They look the same, but that's it, how they act, they think, they speak, it's all too calculated and robotic for a human being. 

With that minor terror aside, I went about opening up the store again, the first event of the night quickly occurring when I went to the roller doors.

There was a jittery, emaciated man on the other side with a scraggly beard that was barely thick enough to even hide the dozens of weeping sores that had scabbed over. He was right against the roller door, practically trying to push his way in. Considering how the Roller Doors are built, having a pronounced lip at the bottom to ensure nothing can be slid under, if I turned them on, he'd hold it down, so I had to try and tell him to back off so I could let him in. 

'Sir, please get off there, it's not-'

'I WANT IN.' 

He spoked with an impossibly deep voice, like the type you'd expect from a demon in a horror movie, or the narrator of some dark fantasy story. There was a rasp to his voice too, that felt too hollow for anyone with functioning lungs. I could feel myself freezing up again, I could hear the Graveyard Shift getting set up, but I decided to try and power through, not acknowledging the bizarre stick man and his imposing voice, instead treating him like a random homeless person. 

'I'm trying to open up so you can get in, sir.' 

The figure was silent, before it then shambled off the lip of the door and I was able to open up the roller doors. He stood there, as at least two other people entered in, oblivious to the bizarre man standing across from me, it was likely he was a consumer, not a customer. 

Considering that it had at least behaved up until this point, I gestured a hand past me, through the main express checkout lane and into the store. I did not expect the consumer to move the way he did, though. 

It was as if the bones in its body moved like individual pieces, a gross, squelching clatter being heard as its torso lagged back like a poorly animated character in an animated film, its legs practically bent inwards as it stood next to me. 

'PLEASE DON'T KEEP ME WAITING NEXT TIME.' 

No one else must have heard it, I doubt the servers did, considering how last night had gone and the chat I had went. I then watched as the consumer shambled and dragged itself into one of the aisles and vanished past a stack of promotional items.

It was only 11:12pm and I had already encountered one bizarre entity, I had a feeling it meant I would encounter more. One thing though, that I can't get out of my mind, that lingers just on the edge, is that I never saw the old man leave. I think it may still be in the store, somewhere, hiding... 

Everything went as normally as you could expect for a supermarket open in the dead of night. At one point, I had a small mob of wannabe thugs come through, they tried to be intimidating, but the realisation that they were on camera made them decide not to try and extort my counter of what little money it had stored. It was at 1:25am that I got my next entity, one that I will admit, had me almost run for my life. 

For some of you who work in retail, you know the type of customer, the political maniac, whether they are wearing extremely right wing or left wing merchandise, act insanely condescending and treat you like the dumbest thing on the planet, you know of them. Over here, in a rural town in Queensland, sadly it's Right Wingers, so expect wacked out boomers wearing One Nation merch and trying to spout their political agenda to you while you try to just ask them for their loyalty card so they can receive the discounts they were yabbering about moments prior. 

Right on the turn of 1:25am, I heard the glutaral noise of someone clearing their throat. It was a decently built man, but I could already tell it was a consumer, when I noticed how his torso was just a bit too rectangular and long. (think if someone stacked another midriff on top of yours, where your torso is far longer than any of your limbs.)   
He was also wearing a MAGA hat, even though we lived in Australia. It looked rather annoyed, but I tried to give them the usual greeting you are taught in customer service. 

'Hello sir, what can Willy's Wonderstore do for you tonight?' 

The consumer crossed its arms, frowning. It was paler than a sheet of paper, now that I noticed it, as it came closer to the register, at the exact same area the one obsessed with the cigarettes was. 

'I have a complaint to make. Siiiiiiiir.' 

The voice was normal, but the sarcastic attitude was amped up, purposefully made larger than life. Sounded almost like something you'd hear in an old Looney Toons cartoon.

'What would that be, sir?' 

'I've just happened to notice that you employ... Ugh. Feeeemales. Has the free country TRUUUuuuuuly fallen that much?!'   
I blinked. Great, so not only do we have bizarre creatures pretending to be people, some of them are also misogynists. It took me a minute or two to respond. 

'Sir, I do not believe that is valid criticism and is in fact hate speech, I will have to ask you to leave.' 

I stood my ground, but the consumer looked furious. Its face became pink, then almost perfectly red to match it's hat. I heard the noise of what I can only assume was bones breaking and lengthening and that awful elastic noise. The consumer's jaw distended, hanging as it stared at me furiously like some ghoul about to eat me whole. 

'LISTEN HERE, WOKIE. I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN FOOD TALKS BACK, SO HOW ABOUT YOU ENSURE THAT  A MORSEL ISN'T RUNNING THE FARM.' 

To be honest, I was petrified, it loomed over me at twice my height, its eyes had turned into ovals, nearly as large as a serving platter, like some dreadful cartoonish distortion of reality made into a solid and hideous form. It slathered out drool as one of it's tiny hands slammed onto the counter and grasped the cool, polished stainless steel. 

I couldn't move, I could feel it's hot breath on my face, its mouth probably a meter from my torso, which I had no doubt it could swallow. But I stayed put, because internally, I was terrified, I didn't have a fight or flight response, I had stand or stare, I was doing both. 

It was not happy that I didn't say anything, it's comparatively tiny legs moved back, as it loosened its grasp, its form still monstrously elongated, stretched out and large. It practically strode out like some predatory animal on membraneless wings. I stood there for five whole minutes, petrified. I then took my 15 minute break, I just couldn't after that encounter. Sadly, this time I had no one with me. 

I sat in the break room alone, I wasn't hungry, wasn't thirsty, but every noise caused my hair to rise in cold dread. Every time the overhead vents creaked, I feared that something out of John Carpenter's worst nightmares would spill out of the ventilation shaft. Luckily, nothing did, but I do know that the break room smelled of a pungent mildew. 

I'd gone on break at 1:36am, I was back by 1:51am. I was not going to be left alone, as this time, something thoroughly inhuman came into the store. It was a pigeon, at first glance, until I realised it moved more like how you'd expert a crocodile to, shunting its body across the floor on stubby legs. 

This not-pigeon was bloated, its shape resembled if you cut up a kid's farm toy bird and shoved the legs, wings, tail feathers and head onto an oversized chewed wad of gum. It shifted like a sack, as if lurched past Register 3. The server there did nothing, as I saw this new creature extend its neck and snack on a packet of bubblegum. I probably should not have done what I did, but I grabbed the broom and marched out of the register, raising my arms up and down, to try and catch this thing's attention. 

A head with one singular, oversized eye looked up at me, its entire being jiggling like a water balloon, the other eye socket empty and weeping clotted blood. It cooed like a pigeon, but by how it munched on the cardboard packaging as if it had teeth, I knew it was not a bird, not an animal. 

I raised the broom, one of the Servers looked up. I could of sworn he slightly grinned as then the pigeon creature squealed and panicked, launching with surprising speed past me and down the medicine aisle, Aisle 4. I yelped in surprised and chased after it, clutching at the broom.

For context, I am not an athletic guy, I do a tonne of walking, but I don't go track, one of my friends Riley does, but I don't. So imagine a slightly pudgy early 20s man trying to chase down the most disturbed avian intruder you could imagine. It was not fun. Despite how its body was built, it could fly. I don't know how, but it could, right after it had jugged a bottle of pure dettol. 

It flew to Aisle 3, where we kept all the party and cooking supplies? I chased it, it ate several bags of chocolate easter eggs. It went all the way to the freezer section and I followed? Cheese, torn from the bags, all over the floor.  

I got lucky when it tried to fly into Aisle 6, where we kept the soft drink, as I got a hit in and sent it spiralling onto the floor. It bounced like a handball, before tumbling into the back dock. I followed after it and closed the door to the back. 

The damned thing was now flittering around the loading bay, I couldn't reach it, but I had an idea, since it now was stuck up in the rafters.   
Returning to the freezer section, I grabbed one of the shredded bags of cheese, taking it with me out the back. The pigeon immediately saw that I had food. It stared me down as I opened the back roller door and then threw the cheese packet out into the loading dock, the cool cheese becoming frigid on the icy stone outside.

If all the other moments were terrifying, this was merely shocking, as I felt the pigeon blob shoot past my head and out to the cheese, beginning to gobble away at it mindlessly. I immediately scrambled and closed the roller door. I was not expecting one of the Graveyard Shift to be waiting on the other side of the dock with a smug look. They're getting more expressive the weirder it gets, it seems. 

'You know you're going to have to clean that, right?' 

'What, the stuff that *thing* trashed? You do it, you let it in!' 

He shook his head. Turned and walked away, leaving me to have to do it. 

By 2:20am, I had finished the clean up and marked the items off as damaged, with the reasoning that an animal had gotten in. I just hoped I wouldn't be going the way Sarah did and get demoted, I needed the cash of my current job to keep the bills in check back home. 

Returning to the register, things were quiet once more, besides a very high and confused man coming in to ask about if we sold firearms (we do not, especially not where we are.), I had to repeat the conversation about four times before he realised and waddled off, probably to pass out on a bench somewhere.

It was 3am when the last of the consumers for the night came in, I heard them before I saw them, much like the second entity. It was loud, painfully high pitch, the wailing of young children. Multiple of them in baby carriers on one woman. I was lucky that it did not come to me, but one of its young did, it was rather easy to tell what set it apart from humans, as when it passed by, I saw that it was riddled with holes, with these "children" being like larvae, infesting these areas and squirming about whilst shrieking like the souls of the damned. 

One of them fell off, and was groping around my register, repeating phrases a kindergartener would in the voice of an old woman, luckily they did not get into my register or over it, but it did leave a slime trail... It was a right nightmare to clean up. It had almost an hour to soak into the floor, before the abominable mother of the thing scooped the grub up and put it back into it's slot, before offering a slurred apology and leaving with a bag filled to the brim with cat food. 

We closed late, later than usual, at 4:15am instead of 4:05am, as our schedule expects. But I was glad to be rid of the Graveyard Shift and the multiple consumers who had come into our store, as well as that damned thing pretending to be a pigeon. 

Sifting through the captures on the security terminal was a slog, so many captures, but I was sure that Sarah would love the results. I was finally done with all my tasks by 5am, with Sarah sending me a few impatient selfies, showing her outside in her ute. Finally, at 5:03am, I got out of Willy's Wonderstore and headed for Sarah's ute, hopping in as soon as I could. I was not expecting to have a visitor, though, as I looked out the window. 

The pigeon was back. It was atop a bench right next to Sarah's ute, Sarah saw it too. It preened it's feathers before then cooing and ruffling itself up, looking rather content. 

I averted my attention from it, as Sarah then headed off, not wanting to stick around to try and decipher the body language of a thing pretending to be a pigeon. 

This time, she let me crash at her place, it was further off, but when I recounted the stories of all four entities and handed her the USB drive I downloaded the captures onto, she thought it'd be best for me to rest up out of town, rather than in town. Of course, it meant messaging Mum in the morning that I had stayed over at a friend's and telling her to let Coal know I was sorry, since the poor fuzz ball likely was wondering why his favourite human was not home. 

Sarah had a bunkbed in her room, apparently her sister used to sleep in it, for a woman of the same year as me, she still lived like an angsty teenager. Though she had gotten lucky, having been able to buy her house off of her uncle before he passed, taking up his mortgage on the house. 

The next morning, I woke up late compared to other days, around 11am, an hour before work. I was groggy at first, then panicked as I had to throw on my uniform and find Sarah. Managing to find her in the kitchen, flicking through the photos, she'd greet me with a mug of coffee (Caramel syrup used, she apparently prefers hers extra sweet, which felt weird for me, who has it black, usually.) and some toasted waffles. Safe to say, she lived a polar opposite life to me, sugary and exciting, while I kept to myself. 

With barely enough time to spare, we clambered into her ute and set back for town, with me getting dropped off by Sarah, it definitely got me a look or two from some of the checkout staff on break at the moment, lounging about at the benches across from our parking space. 

Working Thursday is always a drag, it's usually quiet at Willy's, so you really feel the shift creep by. I was not expecting for Kyle to be waiting for me in the locker room at my usual break time, which was 3:15pm. He looked haunted, almost like the people on the Graveyard Shift. Before I knew it, he had gone inside the bathroom and beckoned me in.

In any other situation, I'd think he was doing one of his weird pranks, considering he's known at our work for being the gay idiot, where he plays up his sexuality and makes a fool of himself and others. He's usually quite fun outside of work, especially at a bar, he has some stories to tell. But at work, he's usually quite the cumbersome issue when he decides that a member of staff is going to be the target of one of his jokes. 

But now, after him being unusually low in mood and so sour with his body language, I followed.  
Our bathrooms are great for cancelling noise, they also don't have cameras. I had a feeling he wanted to say something, but didn't want anyone else to hear. I then looked to Kyle, a minute had passed, 14 more before I had to clock out for my unpaid 30 minute break.

'You've seen em, haven't you?' 

He stared at me like how the Graveyard Shift did, I could tell, from how his eyes still had life in them, that he cared far more about what he had seen, than those strange people ever did. Then again, he had also been the previous ADM, which made me wonder what horrors he had witnessed in his near year long tenure as Front End ADM. But I needed to be sure he was asking about the consumers and not something else.

'Seen what?' 

'The *things,* the ugly ones, weird ones, ones that bash their damn skulls in while talking or spill their guts on the floor. THEM!!!' 

Kyle wasn't one to get angry, he had slammed his fist into the tiled wall, I could already see the side of his hand bruising. He was hyperventilating, I tried to raise a hand to suggest he breathe, but he shook his head. 

'No, no. You need to listen. Get the FUCK. Outta here, before they get hungry. Those things only stay friendly for so long. I saw what items were damaged, one of them pretended to be an animal, didn't it?' 

I doubt he would have known unless he had experienced something similar, so I nodded. 

'Great. GREAT. Consider yourself at the knife's edge, Nate. First, they get peckish, the animalistic ones start to snap up product. But mark my word, the ones that pretend, the ones that try to look like us... they don't find the products too tasty. They'll get bored, quick.'

Our conversation was cut short as one of the staff members came in to use the urinal, I then turned to leave, not wanting to be screamed at by Kyle again, plus, I had 5 minutes of my paid break left. Kyle did follow me out, crouching beside me as I accessed my locked on the second row, giving me one final message before he left.

'Whatever you do, don't trust anyone from higher up. You'll regret it.'

I didn't trust David, I trust Jason either, so Kyle just stated the obvious, but at least the strange encounter with Kyle gave me... some idea of what I'm dealing with. But I can't say I've figured much else out. At least, that was before I noticed, when clocking out at 4pm, that Kyle was not on our system, he had been terminated from the system today, no wonder he was so pissed off, David had taken him out of the picture. I just wonder if maybe he could be a help to Sarah and I, on figuring this rapidly unfolding mystery out.

It's getting late, I have work tomorrow and Riley is wanting to try and play some games with me, Sarah also is joining him and I in blasting some bugs from outer space back to the stone age, so I suppose I'll see you all come next update. I have another graveyard trading hour shift tomorrow night, then it's the weekend. I'll try and update you all come Sunday, if the pattern continues.

As usual, questions and advice is appreciated. I'm still up that creek, but I think maybe I have a paddle thanks to Kyle's mad ramblings. But still, anything to help me in this situation is appreciated. 

Until next time, Nate signing off. 

PS. Sarah asked if perhaps she could have a go at relating her experience via this account, would you all be interested in her perspective?
