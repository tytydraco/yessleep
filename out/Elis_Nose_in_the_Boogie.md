"I don't believe in divorce," Alice snuffed. Or huffed. Hard to tell with that one.

"No. It's a thing," I said.

"Huh?"

Alice was always the queen of the comeback.  And impatient.

"I said, 'Huh?!??!?!!'"

Alice also was about as bright as a cadaver's future.

"I meant that people get divorced. My parents got divorced."

"Well, I don't believe in divorce. And we are never splitting."

I was glad I was stoned. With the new disposable vapes nobody even knew I was contemplating Hostess Snowballs while this shrew was making wifey noises and here, we were only shacking up because of Covid lockdown and the insane rents in Manhattan. New York, not Kansas.

I ran my hand over my face and thought harder about that marshmallow wrapper with toasted coconut sprinkles. That devil food fuc-

"ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING YOU FUCKING PLATE LICKER?!?!"

"Okay. Yes. I hear you. I'm not deaf. Divorce happens. Breaking up happens. Shit happens. To me, especially. But divorce ain't like the fucking BOOGEY man! Is it, Alice?"

Alice opened her mouth, as if to tear me a new something, but it seemed she didn't pay her snappy comeback bill.

"You do understand. Right. Rumple-fuckin-stillskin? How in fuck's safe you know his skin was still? Prolly doing the shimmy shake right to the confessional booth for 9 Hail Hollywood Harry's and off to the races."

**WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU EVEN SAYING?!?!?! I LOVE YOUUUUUUUU THERE IS NO DIVORCE**

**WELL? What have you to say for yourself, Cody? I want you to answer me right this second, Codyyyyyyyy**

I spied the moon. It was full. It was the sixth week of the sixth month in the sixth cycle of the Year of the Cat. Hail Jasper, Lord of Impatience and Persistence. El Gato ***asesino***!

I sniffed at the air like a hound dog.

**CODY!?!?!??! I AM TALKING TO YOU!?!!**

Alice clapped her hands together sharply.

"Answer. Me. Right. This. Instant. Coddddyyyyyyy!! BLAHHH"

I sniffed at the air some more. Maybe vanilla ice cream with the snowballs. Fucking Eli loves the 'scream after a psychotic breakdown.

"Why do you keep sniffing at the air?!?!?!"

I sniffed some more.

"See. I was wrong. I lied like the rug on your ex-husband's cheese-head. The boogie man is REAL."

"I don't believe in any boogie man! You're just using DARVO!"

"Huh," I said faking a sneeze and deftly, imho, taking a hit of the dabwoods. I tried to stifle a cough, fucked it up, and faked a sneeze. I got over.

"DARVO, CODY! Fucking D.A.R.V.O."

DARVO (an acronym for **"deny, attack,** and **reverse victim** & offender") is a reaction that perpetrators of wrongdoing, may display in response to being held accountable for their behavior.

I snuffed and sniffed more. I felt Eli's presence.

Dealing with Eli was always a mixed bag. Sorta like playing some Ella and then somehow Pat Boone come on the mix a day later. Gotta keep your guard up. Eli first found me at the Greyhound Bus Stop at Port Authority in the summer of 1974 when my mom slapped me for spending her last five bucks on comic books. But fuck that, the new Marvel books were out that summer.

Hulk, Spider-Man, FF, Marvel-Two-In-One, Luke fuckin' Cage POWERMAN!?!? And she wanna buy that brown rice hippie gruel and do the OmmmTheMahareeesheeevaysha shit and tell me what a prick my old man was before he headed out with only his thumb and a dream of reconnoitering with his old flame, Vera.

So, the maternal unit got a hold of seven-year-old me in the Port Authority bathroom. She was about to do the ol' ratta-muh-tat-ratta-muh-tat paradiddle on my noggin' when it got deathly cold. In July with no AC mind you. And then it got dark. My mother froze, open hand in the air.

And then Ma screamed loud enough to wake the dead. But, 1974 NYC was deaf, so that was part of the charm, Eli later confided.

"HELP CODY," Ma screamed. But it was not in the cards. The shade of green, almost matching Bruce Banner's alter-ego. But thick. I think the word is viscous but seven-year-old me just watched my mother's head disappear under a green film that thickened and bubbled and pulsed.

It smelled like a BLT and bus station bathroom urinal disinfectant.

And then, just like a flushed deuce, the maternal unit went down to the filthy bathroom tiles. Her head bounced and came to rest at an unusual angle.

The green slowly shimmered and popped before exploding in a multitude of directions. Each piece of the green oozing puzzle scurrying away and out of sight only leaving the shadow man who smelled like piss, vinegar, BLTs and strangely strawberry Charleston Chews, although that was 50 years ago, and it coulda been my upper-lip.

"ELI," it said.

A light bulb shattered in the ceiling raining glass down on us.

I looked down at my mother. I looked at Eli. I gently removed a shard of bulb from my cheek.

"She dead?" I asked.

"ELI," it said.

I heard squawking and then there was a commotion and police and grown-ups and all the bulbs blew out and Eli was gone with the wind and my defective maternal unit.

I ended up in foster care, but everytime the shit hit the fan, I could smell the bacon, lettuce, tomato, toasted white bread with Hellman's real mayonnaise. The piss too. That is how I ended up *seeing* green as a BLT dipped in mayonnaise and piss. Ever since, I try and avoid forests and parks.

**CODY!?!?!? ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO NEVER APOLOGIZES?!!?!? CAN YOU EVER ADMIT YOU ARE WRONG?!?! CODYYYYYY**

Alice's shrill shrew real wives of <add suburban hell hole> snapped me back to surreality.

The bacon smell grew stonger. I could hear a faint sizzle.

"I said, 'the boogie man IS so, too, real. Eli's coming. Better hide your heart!'"

"You're a moron!" was her exasperated reply.

Only it came out only so far as, "You're a mo-" when Eli arrived. And covered her face in that snot shit. Then ripped her heart out of her chest and let his canine's rip open to it while it still beat futively.

"Fuck, dude!" I said. "You didn't have to booger, Alice!"

Eli swallowed the last of Alice's heart. I didn't say anything as it's rude to not let someone finish chewing.

Finally, Eli smothered a belch and said, "Born to boogie, baby."

You'd think by now I'd be used to this sort of thing. But like most times, I grew green as Alice's head around the gills and heaved hard. I felt something in my abdomen maybe tear and projectile vomit covered Alice's snotty head.

"You're a dick, Eli," I said and meant it.

Eli stifled another belch. "Boogie man have Cody's back."

I was gonna say something else but just said, "Snowballs and vanilla Ben & Jerry's?"

Eli's face brightened into a grimace which for him was the equivalent face you'd sport if you hit the Powerball.

"Okay," Eli said.

"Born to boogie?" I chuckled. I woulda put an arm around Eli's shoulder but radioactive hellacious boogers, ya know. "You come up with that all by yourself."

Eli looked pleased. He nodded.

"That's pretty good," I said and we headed off to the kitchen for our just desserts and left Alice with hers.
