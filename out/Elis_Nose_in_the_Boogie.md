"I don't believe in divorce," Alice snuffed. Or huffed. Hard to tell with that one.

"No. It's a thing," I said.

"Huh?"

Alice was always the queen of the comeback.  And impatient.

"I contorted my pie-hole like hers and said, 'Huh?!??!?!!'"

Alice also happened to be about as bright as a cadaver's future.

She raised her eyebrows passive-aggressively at me.

"I meant that people get divorced. My parents got divorced," I said, recognizing that the munchies were coming on.

"Well, I don't *believe* in divorce. And we are never splitting."

I was glad I was stoned. With the new disposable vapes nobody even knew I was contemplating Hostess Snowballs while this shrew went around town making wifey noises. For crissakes we only ended up shacking up because of Covid lockdown and the insane rents in Manhattan. New York; not Kansas.

I ran my hand over my face and thought harder about that sweet, thick and chewy marshmallow wrapping with those delicate toasted coconut sprinkles. That devil's food fuc-

***"ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING YOU FUCKING PLATE LICKER?!?! CODYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"***

"Okay. Yes. I hear you. I'm not deaf. Divorce happens. Breaking up happens. Get it? Shit happens. To me, especially. But divorce ain't exactly like the fucking ***BOOGEY MAN***! Is it, Alice?"

Alice opened her mouth, as if to tear me a new something or other, but it seemed she didn't pay her snappy comeback bill.

I continued. "You do understand. Right? The tooth-fairy? Santy Claus? Rumple-fuckin-stillskin? How in fuck's sake you know his skin was even still? Prolly doing the ol' shimmy shake right to the confessional booth for 9 Hail Hollywood Harry's and off to the felony races."

**WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU EVEN SAYING, CODY?!?!?! I LOVE YOUUUUUUUU AND DON'T BELIEVE IN DIVORCE!!!!!!! WELL!? What have you to say for yourself, Cody?! Goddammit! I want you to answer me right this very absolute second, Codyyyyyyyy!!!!**

**...**

I spied the moon.

It was full. It was the sixth week of the sixth month in the sixth cycle of the Year of the Cat.

Hail Jasper, Lord of Impatience and Persistence.

El Gato ***asesino***!

I sniffed at the air like a hound dog.

...

**CODY!?!?!??! I AM TALKING TO YOU!?!!**

Alice clapped her hands together sharply.

"Answer. Me. Right. This. Instant. Coddddyyyyyyy!! ***BLAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!***"

I sniffed at the air some more. Maybe vanilla ice cream with the snowballs? Fucking Eli loves the 'scream after a psychotic breakdown.

"Why do you keep sniffing at the air like that, Cody?!?!?!"

I sniffed some more. Then I stopped and looked at Alice.

"See, kid. I was wrong. I lied. Lied just like the cheap rug on your ex-husband's head. The boogie man ***is*** real."

"I don't believe in any boogie man! You-you-well-you're, you're just using DARVO!"

"Huh," I said. I faked a sneeze theatrically. Turning my back to Alice I slipped my hand in my pocket and back out, taking a hit of the dabwoods. I took more than I intended and tried to stifle a cough. I fucked it up so went to Plan B, faking a sneeze. I got over and was back at cruising altitude.

***"DARVO, CODY! Fucking D.A.R.V.O."***

DARVO (an acronym for **"deny, attack,** and **reverse victim** & offender") is a reaction that perpetrators of wrongdoing, may display in response to being held accountable for their behavior.

I snuffed and sniffed more.

Eli's coming.

I felt his presence grow close.

Dealing with Eli was always a mixed bag.

Sorta like playing some Ella and then somehow Pat Boone come on the mix a day later. Gotta keep your guard up.

Eli first found me at the Greyhound Bus Stop at Port Authority in the summer of 1974. That was when my mom got slap happy on me for spending her last five bucks on comic books and gum and candy bars and a Spalding No. 6. But fuck that! The must-have new Marvel books were out that summer. Must. Have. Stan said so!

Hulk, Spider-Man, Captain Marvell, FF, Marvel-Two-In-One, Luke fuckin' Cage POWERMAN!?!? Are you kidding me?

And my Bahama mama wanna buy that brown rice hippie gruel and rub avocado on her mug. She wanna do the OmmmTheMahareeesheeevaya chanting shit. She wanna get smug and tell me what a prick my old man was. How he was a bum and good for exactly nothing before he headed out on the highway with only his thumb and a dream. A dream of getting to Hollywood of reconnoitering with his old flame, Vera. Get the old act back together.

So, like I was saying, the maternal unit gets a hold of seven-year-old me in the Port Authority bathroom. She was about to do the ol' *ratta-muh-tat-ratta-muh-tat* paradiddle on my noggin' when out of the blue it gets deathly cold. Like freeze the sweat on your sack cold. In July! With no AC mind you! And then it got dark like a party on the last night at Pompeii.

And then something crazy happened. My mother froze. Like right in place. Like in the Superfriends when the villain hit the Wonder Twins with the freeze frame ray. Or maybe it was just shitty, outsourced animation?

Anyway, my mummy freeze frames, her open hand in the air. Looked to me like it was just starting to close before the creepy wind.

And then Ma unfroze long enough to scream. Scream loud enough to wake Jimmy Hoffa and his abuela and babushka. But, alas, 1974 New York City was deaf as a doorknob. That was part of the charm, Eli later confided, but I digress.

**"HELP CODYYYYYYYYYY! HELP ME, SONNNNNN,"** Ma shriked. Her face drained of all color.

Help was not in the cards. Not for mom, anyways.

The shade of green. Man, it burned itself in my retinas like staring into a solar eclipse. That green, almost radioactive. Just about a perfect match to Bruce Banner's alter-ego. The big man. The not-so jolly green giant. But what covered Mom's head was not just notable for being green. It was thick as Jethro's brick. I think the word is *viscous,* but seven-year-old me just watched my mother's head disappear under that radioactive and slimy green film. Oh, how it thickened and bubbled and pulsed like rice pudding on the stove neglected one minute too many.

The green ooze smelt like a BLT and bus station bathroom urinal disinfectant.

Then, just like a flushed deuce, the maternal unit went down. Down, down, down to the filthy tiled bathroom ground. Her head bounced, making a sound like two coconuts being smacked together. Her head didn't bounce a second time but instead came to rest at an unusual angle.

The green, the green, well, it, it slowly shimmered. It popped. It moaned a sound from bubbling lesions that sounded like, *"blobbbbeeeeeblawwwwb,"* before exploding in a multitude of directions. Each piece of the green slimy flak hit some surface. And, without missing a palpitating heartbeat, scurried away, leaving only the shadow man.

He smelled like piss, vinegar, BLTs and strangely strawberry Charleston Chews, although it's over 50 years ago, and it truthfully coulda been my upper-lip.

"ELI," it said, with a low guttural snarl.

A light bulb shattered in the ceiling raining glass down on us.

I looked down at my mother. I looked at Eli. I gently removed a shard of bulb from my cheek.

I looked at my mom. "She dead?" I asked him.

"ELI," it said.

I heard squawking and static and then there was a commotion and police and grown-ups flooding in the bathroom. That's when all the long fluorescent bulbs blew out. During the commotion I lost track of Eli. A policeman hustled me out of the bathroom. I tried to look around and find Eli but no dice.

I don't want to bore you with my life story but, long story short***;*** I ended up in foster care. It was rough but everytime the shit hit the fan FR, I could, like clockwork, smell the combined scents of bacon, lettuce, tomato, toasted white bread with Hellman's real mayonnaise waft into whatever hell hole of the month social services pawned me off on. The piss too. Let's talk about that. Old. Sour. Pungent. That is how I ended up *smelling the color* green as piss & BLT dipped in mayo. Synesthesia, I think it's called, but I'm dyslexic so I ain't exactly sure. Anyway, ever since, I try and avoid forests and parks and the pig.

**CODY!?!?!? ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO NEVER APOLOGIZES?!!?!? CAN YOU EVER ADMIT YOU ARE WRONG?!?! CODYYYYYY**

Alice's shrill shrew real wives of <add suburban hell hole> snapped me back to surreality.

The bacon smell grew stonger. I could hear a faint sizzle.

"I said, 'the boogie man IS so, too, real. Eli's coming. Better hide your heart!'"

"You're a moron!" was her exasperated reply.

Only it came out only so far as, "You're a mo-" when Eli arrived. And covered her face in that snot shit. Then ripped her heart out of her chest and let his canine's rip open to it while it still beat futively.

"Fuck, dude!" I said. "You didn't have to booger, Alice!"

Eli swallowed the last of Alice's heart. I didn't say anything as it's rude to not let someone finish chewing.

Finally, Eli smothered a belch and said, "Born to boogie, baby."

You'd think by now I'd be used to this sort of thing. But like most times, I grew green as Alice's head around the gills and heaved hard. I felt something in my abdomen maybe tear and projectile vomit covered Alice's snotty head.

"You're a dick, Eli," I said and meant it.

Eli stifled another belch. "Boogie man have Cody's back."

I was gonna say something else but just said, "Snowballs and vanilla Ben & Jerry's?"

Eli's face brightened into a grimace which for him was the equivalent face you'd sport if you hit the Powerball.

"Okay," Eli said.

"Born to boogie?" I chuckled. I woulda put an arm around Eli's shoulder but radioactive hellacious boogers, ya know. "You come up with that all by yourself."

Eli looked pleased. He nodded.

"That's pretty good," I said and we headed off to the kitchen for our just desserts and left Alice with hers.
