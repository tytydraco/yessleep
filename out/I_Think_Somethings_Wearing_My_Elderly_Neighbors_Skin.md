Jack’s been my neighbor for ten years. Vietnam broke him. Isolation finished the job. I stop by now and then just to make sure he hasn’t rotted into the carpet.

I know what stress looks like. I’ve seen people unravel. I’ve seen dementia hollow out their eyes until nothing’s left but blinking.

But whatever’s inside Jack now, it’s not forgetting.
It’s pretending. Pretending to be Jack.

And it’s doing a damn bad job of it.

He doesn’t have much family. He should be living in a care facility, but no relatives are there to push him in that direction. Just me, pretty much.

I knocked on his door. While I waited and looked around, I made a mental note to come back and trim his grass. Long strands of green weeds swayed like a field of dancers in the wind.

The door opened and I had to stop myself from wincing. He looked bad compared to the last time I saw him.

“Richard,” he said, more as a fact than a greeting.

“I thought I’d bring you some groceries.”

He eyed me up and down, stared at the plastic grocery bags in my hand, then opened the door the rest of the way.

Jack isn’t the warmest of folks, as you can probably surmise. His time in Vietnam sure did a number on him, and the sheer isolation he faced afterward had finished him off. But he reminded me of my wicked old grandpa before he passed away.

And I had a bit of a soft spot for the old liver-spotted bastard.

He glided faster than usual across the floor, dragging behind a length of blankets like a king’s cloak. I couldn’t hear the thump of his feet. It struck me as exceedingly odd. Jack’s slippers tended to smack the floor pretty loud with each step.

His home smelled like dust warmed by sunlight, like the aged ink and brittle paper smell of an old newspaper.

Fly traps hung like orange tongues from the ceiling. Some still had a few prisoners buzzing around inside them.

The visible cracks of his windows had a yellow tint to them. The windows peered through gaps in the curtains, which were drawn long against the intruding sun.

Jack motioned for me to sit down at the dinner table as he rifled through the two white plastic bags I’d brought him.

He seemed more disinterested than usual. Somehow, less chatty.

“Everything okay, Jack?” I asked.

He shot me a glance that said, Why don’t you leave me alone to die in peace.

“Nurse stopped coming by for some reason a couple days back. Now I just gotta get rid of you and the Meals on Wheels fella.”

I cracked a smirk, but his mouth remained firm in place like cut marble on a statue.

His left eye drooped more than usual. The skin on his face didn’t seem to sit quite right.

“Did you have a stroke, Jack? Are you feeling okay?”

Jack smushed the left side of his face back into place like it was putty. It sent a trilling alarm ringing in the back of my mind.

“Stop askin’ so many damn questions. I’m fine. Want a coffee?”

Jack had never offered me a coffee before.

He peered at me now, the left eye he had slid up into position locked in the upper left corner of his eye. Like he was a chameleon, one eye watching me, the other watching the ceiling.

I got up, pretending to check my watch, unmanned by the sight of him. Feeling something deeply wrong about the situation.

“I gotta go. Nice catching up with you.”

I turned to leave, sliding my chair back into its place at the dining table.

“Sure you don’t want a sip of tea?” he asked. When I met his gaze again, at least the one functional eye’s gaze, I saw that his mouth was molded into a smile now. The teeth worked beneath like a llama chewing cud. His lips folded out all wrong.

“You said coffee before. Not tea.”

He nodded vigorously, his head wobbling back and forth like a bobblehead.

“That’s what I meant. Coffee.”

He clicked his teeth, chewing the air.

“Co…Fhh…eee.”

I moved past him and started toward the door. I saw that it wasn’t just the blanket wrapped around him. There was a strange trail of them stretched across the floor.

I spotted a large tube-like protrusion lying in the center of the path of blankets on the floor. I traced its path down toward the open basement door.

“My oxygen tubes,” Jack said, flicking his head back so he moved something beneath the trail of blankets.

Oxygen tubes? Whatever was beneath those blankets had to be as thick as my torso, much longer too.

The hairs on my neck crept up. I flicked open the front door.

“See ya later, Jack. I gotta get home to Nancy, she’s on dinner tonight.”

No reply came from behind me. As I moved to close the door, I saw Jack standing in the hallway threshold beneath the curved doorway bannister.

His head was cocked. His eyes like two dark sunflower seeds, both centered on me. His arms were hung loose at his hips. His back slightly arched. He was silent except for the sound of his breath echoing like the rattle of a mixing pea inside a spray paint can.

His chest moved in and out, slowly. Grinding with each exhale.

I closed the door behind me. My breath caught in my chest like a fish writhing in a net.

Should I have called the cops? What would I even say? “Help me, my neighbor’s acting odd?” Doesn’t exactly scream emergency. I thought maybe it was a stroke at first, but then he rearranged his face. Pretty sure stroke victims aren’t capable of that.

And what about the blankets leading down to his basement? That cylindrical shape running beneath it.

I wanted to get my wife’s opinion before I did anything. I was lucky and happened to marry a woman much smarter than me. She always knew what to do. So I marched back home and waited until dinner was over and the kids were in bed to mention it to her.

We were snuggled up in bed, her nightdress on, the windows open to let the heat in when I broached the subject.

“Honey, I saw something… off today. When I stopped by Jack’s house.”

She flipped around to face me. I could see the sharp angular grooves of her chin in the dark.

“Did he finally kick the bucket?”

I saw a cheeky grin rising on her lips. I couldn’t help but grin too. I couldn’t ever help it when I was looking into her eyes.

“No, no. He’s alive…” I paused. “I think.”

“You think? What the hell does that mean?”

The smile on her lips faltered.

I explained to her how he seemed to glide across the floor, how he dragged a string of blankets behind him. I explained his mannerisms, the sagging face, the way he stood in the threshold of the door.

I felt her soft hand glide against my wrist, and she tucked her fingers into my palm. She squeezed slightly.

“I can tell you aren’t joking,” she said.

“But what you are saying is also batshit insane.”

“So you don’t believe me?” I said, peering into her eyes. The warmth of her body pressed against me.

“I didn’t say that,” she affirmed. “It’s just… bizarre. We’ll stop by tomorrow evening together.”

“No, no. I don’t want you anywhere near that place until I figure out what’s wrong.”

“You shouldn’t have told me about it then,” she said, pressing her forehead into mine.

“I’m sure as hell not going to let you wander into some oozing zombie’s house without me there to protect you.” Her grin grew larger.

“Okay. But you stay near the door. We aren’t going to go inside,” I said firmly.

Nancy’s mind is very literal and mechanical. She needs to chew on data and facts before she can really sink her teeth into a concept. But beneath that, she never doubted me. She just needed to confirm things for herself. That’s what makes her so damn smart.

I fell into a quiet sleep and awoke the next morning, readied myself for work, and spent the day in the office.

Between sips of black coffee and Excel spreadsheets, my thoughts drifted back to Jack. To the misaligned drooping curve of his chin, and the way his body glided across the floor. Full body shivers erupted from me, like I’d just slipped out of a freezing pool.

The time came when I packed up my things from the office into my briefcase and drove home. It was about 6 p.m. My wife was home a couple of hours before me. She’d sent the kids to a babysitter for the evening.

She’d prepared a lasagna to bring over to Jack’s. It was her way of building a valid excuse to go over and see the cranky old bastard. Personally, I’d have just marched over there, but she’d already cooked it.

We walked over, four houses down. A dog barked in the distance, the wind whistled through the leaves of a large oak in his yard. A car I didn’t recognize sat parked out front. It appeared I’d missed it the day before when I’d stopped by.

There was an atmosphere of unease around his home. I assumed it was just in me, but I saw the look on Nancy’s face and immediately knew it wasn’t.

She held the lasagna with one hand and slid the other around my wrist. I rang the doorbell.

Minutes of silence passed. I peered in through a window, but the curtains had been drawn tight.

We turned to walk away when the door flicked open. I peered my head inside. I opened my mouth to say something, but it died in my throat when I saw an empty living room.

Somewhere deep in its wooden bones, the house groaned.

“Stay out here, please,” I asked her, and she gave me a raised eyebrow in response.

“I’m not letting you go in there by yourself,” she said sternly.

“Please. Something’s wrong here. I mean really wrong. I don’t feel good about this.”

She felt the heat from my gaze now, the seriousness in my voice.

“Okay, fine. I’ll stay out here.” She gave in, a little at first, then all at once with a shake of her head.

“If I hear so much as a squeal from you, I’m calling the cops,” she said, wagging a finger in my face.

I planted a kiss on her forehead and wandered inside. I noticed she kept it propped open with the heel of her foot behind me.

The house smelled more humid than it had yesterday. Like a film of pungent, musty residue clung to my skin as I crossed further inside. Like I was a curious little fish wandering into a much larger catfish’s gaping mouth.

I saw the blankets now, scattered about in heaps, mixed with spread-out towels and sheets, encompassing the entire first floor. It was bizarre. Perhaps Parkinson’s? Dementia? Alzheimer’s?

I crossed past the basement door and I nearly tripped over a large vertical lump beneath the ocean of fabric blocking the narrow corridor between the living room and kitchen. I saw that the lump subtly moved beneath the fabric. I saw that it extended far out of the basement door.

I turned to rush back, and Jack was immediately to my left, filling a vacancy leading past the dining room and into the hall leading to Jack’s bedroom.

That crunching of sticky lungs exhaling, the sensation of hot breath on the right side of my neck.

Jack was inches away.

His body rattled slightly like a shaking hand. I flicked my glance over. Jack’s head was a puffy ruin. Sagging flesh, like someone pressed two eyes into a ball of dough. His clothes hung wrong on his body. One arm was much shorter than the other. Jack was enrobed in blankets like a cocoon.

He lifted a drooping hand and pointed toward the basement.

He lifted the other and with unsteady fingers he tore apart fleshy seams where his lips melded together, revealing his sunken teeth.

“Co…hhh…mme.” His teeth clicked like he was chewing on the words.

“Basss…” click “ment.”

He was moving closer now. I watched a trickle of blood run down his folded cheek from the two bleeding sections where he’d pried his lips apart.

I thought I heard the ever so slightest hint of a female scream. I twisted my head toward the basement door.

“Richard?” Nancy called from the front door. “Everything okay in there?”

Jack cracked his neck in Nancy’s direction. I heard a series of three shuddering pops reverberate from his vertebrae. His neck bulged with knobs of bone the size of golf balls.

“Som…one…el…se…” The click of teeth. A predatory sort of drag in his voice. His tiny marble eyes centered over my shoulder onto Nancy.

I slid past him, taking advantage of the momentary pause. I caught a smell of mulch, rotting leaves, a compost pile. I also saw that Jack’s skin was glistening slightly.

Jack didn’t move to intercept me. But I saw his drooping head peer from around the corner behind us. The mass beneath the blankets led to Jack, and it ruffled the edges of the blankets almost imperceptibly.

Nancy set the lasagna inside the doorframe and pulled me outside. She took one last look at Jack and then closed the front door behind us.

“What the fuck?” she asked, looking up into my eyes. “I mean, what the fuck? Is he having an allergic reaction? Do we call the cops?”

I forcefully pulled her from the door. Noticing something red in her hand, I lifted up her wrist when we were halfway across the yard.

“What is that?” I inquired, pointing toward the slipper. Still shaken from seeing Jack’s melting face. The way he peeled apart the flesh where his lips once were like he was shaping clay. Bleeding clay.

“It’s a slipper. A woman’s slipper.” I eyed it with a hint of concern.

Jack has lived alone for over forty years.

As we crossed the street, I recalled something he’d told me yesterday.

Nurse stopped coming by for some reason a couple days back.

Stopped coming by?

I took the slipper from my wife’s hand. I saw the way her fingers trembled.

A woman’s shoe.

The nurse’s shoe.

And if she’d left her shoes there, was that her car out front? The blue Nissan sitting on the curb. I had no idea if it was her car, but I had to check.

Before Nancy could utter another word, I pulled out my phone and called the police. I explained everything, about the shoe. I explained in more nuanced terms about some of his odd behaviors, what I thought was a woman’s scream, and the presence of that car out front.

I watched from the window as a patrol car pulled into our cul-de-sac. They wheeled around and parked behind the blue Nissan.

Two uniformed officers stepped out and wandered up to the door. They knocked. And several minutes passed with no response. The cops peered into each of the front windows covered by blinds, and then they shrugged.

I watched the smaller officer lean in and huddle his hands around the lower right corner of the Nissan’s windshield. He then recorded what I presume was the VIN number, and then they left.

That was it.

I thought about the nurse. About her being in there alone, with whatever contorted thing sat inside that home.

And it was in that moment I knew I was going to do something stupid. Something I couldn’t even tell Nancy about. I knew she’d try to stop me. I was going to break into Jack’s house, slip in through a back window. Step in where the cops couldn’t. But ever since I was a kid, I had a streak for standing up for the little guy.

Even when it led to me getting beaten up too on the school playground. Even in high school, I’d gotten suspended for fighting a senior bullying a kid with cerebral palsy. I gave that fucker a swollen lip for his trouble.

And I imagined that poor nurse. What if she was alive. What if that’s why that thing wearing his skin wanted me to go down there, to hide me away too. Deep in the recesses of that dark basement.

I waited until Nancy was asleep. I could almost hear the lecture she’d give me when I got back. About making stupid decisions. About doing things as a team. But I knew she’d either stop me or want to come along.

In our marriage, it was understood that she was the wise decision maker, and I always listened to her advice. But I was the one who got shit done. If she was a ball-peen hammer, I was a sledgehammer. Somehow, it worked.

Yeah, I’d get an earful if this turned out to be nothing. I’d be embarrassed. She’d chew me a new one. But if I was right? If something truly fucked up was going on inside that home and I let her stop me? Let that nurse suffer in that basement? I’d never swallow it down.

And worse, if she came with me and something happened to her, that would somehow be worse.

I kissed the back of her head, inhaled deeply at the scent of her shampoo—something light and fragrant, like lavender. And I slipped quietly out of bed. I’d set a spare change of clothes in the guest bathroom.

I gave her one last glimpse in the fractured darkness of my room before I closed the door, bracing it with my hand to muffle the click.

I was always getting myself into trouble with this hero shit. I thought I’d left it behind when I nearly got arrested in a bar in college after breaking a pool stick on some pervert’s back when I saw him grope a waitress.

But here I was, years later, with a wife and kids, and I was getting up to my same, tired sense of morality.

I slipped outside as quiet as I could manage, trying to hide my footsteps from the quiet house.

I remembered that scream in the basement. It sounded buried. Layered beneath something. But I had heard it. I hadn’t even mentioned it to Nancy until she overheard me say it to the police.

But I’d heard it. I’d heard something.

I slipped around the back of Jack’s home, intending to break in through a window.

But the back door was open. Wide open. I started to feel the beat of my heart inside the pulse of my neck.

I stepped forward. Every part of me screaming not to. This was a trap. But Jack was an old man. I could fend him off.

As I crept through the doorway into the kitchen, the basement door was close. I stepped over a blue throw blanket and a bunched pile of red towels.

The house was silent as death.

I saw in my mind’s eye Jack tearing open his face to reveal a set of chewing teeth. The trails of blood down either side of his bulbous chin.

Chills ran down my body. The lump in the floor was gone. That large one I’d seen trailing from Jack—not beneath the blankets anymore.

The basement was dark. A smell, coppery and gritty like the fresh air after a hog is butchered and parceled out. The steps were covered in a layer of old bedsheets.

I turned on my phone flashlight, bringing a faint glow to the darkness. It was crushing. Pulverizing darkness creeping at the light’s edges.

The smell grew more intense. An earthy undertow. Crumbling worm-filled soil dried in the sun, smooshed between your fingers.

I rounded the corner, and my heart dropped like a falling elevator until it came crashing down. My body wracked with full-tilt chills.

A pulsing, oscillating mass of pale human flesh. Stretched across the room like a carpet, half buried in a mound of blankets. I saw one female leg sticking out from beneath a shivering fold of flesh, prickled with hair-like cilia. The underside was red, like the red spongy tissue beneath a scab.

The rippling edge tasted the air like a sea slug browsing for food across the ocean floor. Eating.

Attached to it was a red slipper. The partner to the one Nancy had found upstairs.

The basement door slammed shut above me. Above the flight of wooden stairs.

I snapped my gaze away to see what had happened, and my eyes met the drooping form of Jack, hanging upside down from the ceiling above the stairs.

A sagging flesh puppet. Pressed against the door.

I followed the writhing flesh of his body, encased in blankets and sheets, caked together in a hardened fluid turned to a protective layer. Like a caddisfly larva.

A large fleshy appendage like an oversized feeding tube was suctioned to the ceiling of the stairway, encased partially in layers of cloth. Tendrils ran from it like roots, adhering to and stabbing into the drywall. My eyes traced it back down toward the writhing mass of flesh consuming the nurse.

It had moved closer. Inched closer.

My face went cold. I could hear the sound of thousands of tiny prickles—cilia moving and writhing, pushing that creature toward me.

Jack’s uneven arms hung limply above, blocking my escape, his sagging head nearly touching the floor.

“St…ay.” It invited.

I peered around. The space in front of me was blocked by the twisted form of Jack’s puppeteer. A small hallway shot down past the stairwell.

Those sticky tendrils running along Jack’s umbilical tube began leeching down from the ceiling, tasting the air. Looking for me.

I rushed down the narrow hallway, my head flushed with warmth, with panic. I threw myself into a closed door and it rattled against its hinges. I peered behind me. The hallway was no more narrow than myself, and I saw the fleshy visage of Jack crowding the hallway. A hundred thin, veiny prehensile limbs reached out toward me.

I slammed my weight again. A meteor shower of pain bloomed in my vision. My vision wobbled.

I turned, and Jack had somehow crossed half the distance. I could hear the click of teeth above the writhing sound of movement, like a horde of cockroaches behind a wall. It was deafening now. Filling the darkness.

I threw myself a final time and heard the hinges rattle. The lock buckled, and I fell through into some sort of office room.

I knocked over stacks of newspaper, creating a sort of avalanche. I slammed the door shut behind me and twisted the lock.

I tipped over the desk. I felt something pop in my shoulder. A blur of pain bloomed like a rosebud.

The far window sat in a depressed window well. The only source of light in the room. I’d dropped my phone somewhere along the way.

I stared at the door, watched it begin to shudder. Small pale tentacles began crawling beneath the gap. I heard burrowing to my right, something chewing into the wall.

I threw open the window, clawed my way halfway out of the sill, just as the door budged halfway open.

I turned once more. I couldn’t help but eye the horror. This couldn’t have happened. It couldn’t have been real. I told myself over and over again.

I saw Jack’s head pressing through the gap like silly putty. His bones popped to accommodate, leaving behind the shelled, crunchy armor of blankets. A snail breaking through its shell, unwilling to leave behind prey.

His neck squeezed through. It was fleshy toothpaste pushing through a tube. Countless veined arms the size of a baby’s wrist crept around the door’s edges, pushing, clawing. The wood groaned.

I heaved myself up and over the lip of the sill and ran. Heaved myself over the fence like I was a pole vaulter and charged my way back home. When I got home, I locked myself in the bathroom, threw myself on the tile. I sat there, running my hands through the creases in my hair.

Nancy knocked on it. Asked if I was okay.

I lied to her. Said I had a stomach bug. God, that hurts to say. I’ve never lied to her before. But God, what could I say? What could I do?

She opened the door and tried to ask me more. She tried so hard, and I lied right in her face.

But she’s smarter than that. Always has been. She’ll get it out of me one way or another.

I can’t stop imagining the visage of Jack, the man I’d once known, squeezing through a gap in the partially opened door the size of my fist. Unhinging his being. Sliding apart his bones.

And that wasn’t even the worst part.

It’s the frown I saw carved deep in the groove of his mouth. The pleading look in those beady insect eyes.

Like there was a piece of him still left in there.
