all this started two days ago it was a pretty umid afternoon so I took advantage of it to go for a walk, I live in southern Utah and usually in June it's too hot to go out outside but this time it was bearable

when i was far away from my house and towards some desert areas I found a vhs on the ground, strange I thought no one has used one of these for years, one thing that made it even stranger was what was written on the pale pink label at first I thought they were Chinese characters but the more I looked the more there were things wrong with these strange letters, one of the questions that came to mind spontaneously was who had put it here, I remembered that my father had given me his vhs player, so I took the vhs and went back home

as I walked home I had a thousand questions in my head who was it, what language is this, why abandon it like this in the desert, as soon as I got home I plugged the vhs player into the television and then put the vhs in, the only thing I saw was static as I was about to remove the vhs a strange music started, it seemed like one of those stereotypical Australian melodies, the first thing I saw was a blue background and various white lines, then a title appeared a it was in English,it said "biology of a human being" I understood what it was an old educational video perhaps smuggled from somewhere I continued to watch

“humans are one of the most complex species on planet earth” strange but true “now we will observe various characteristics of a human being.” “number 1: humans shed their skin almost every day” what? I don’t think it true “number 2: humans can show quills to scare predators” after this sentence an image that showed two 3d models one of a naked man with quills on his back scaring a large dog

what the fuck am I watching? who the fuck created this vhs what the point of this, maybe they translated the language this vhs was created in, but it wouldn't explain the 3d image, immediately after a screen appeared with the words "objects frequently used by humans" the screen showed a cigarette a car a phone and a house, then it showed various videos of people driving talking and using their phones, the more I looked the more bizarre it became what the purpose of this vhs and above all who created it after this it ended, I started to think about what I should do, call the police, but no crime had been committed, maybe stalking?

honestly i was confused, but as i was about to remove the vhs my girlfriend called me, i answered

“mike have you seen the news”

"no why"

“UFOs have been spotted near your house”

“I hope you're joking”

“ watch the news”

she hang up and i and looked at the news the first article i saw was "group of lights spotted near iron county" at first I didn't care much about it but then I realized what if this vhs is of alien origin, no it can't be because aliens would create a video and then put it on a vhs it doesn't make sense, however the characters on the vhs are not recognizable, well they could be in another language, but which one, now I'm more confused than before, who should I call the police an astrologer or a ufologist tell me what should I do
