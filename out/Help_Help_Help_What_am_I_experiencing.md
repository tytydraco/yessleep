What am I experiencing/dealing with?

Hello!!!! Long post. I am just here posting to figure out what the hell is happening and why?! I am 27 years old and currently a single mom to 3 beautiful babies, 6 months old, 4 years old, and 7 years old. To be able to understand the phenomenon that I've been dealing with i need to start back before my last two kids...
When I was 20 years old, my now 7 year old was 2 years old. I had finally gone off into the world and met my former roommate Nicole. Nicole and I met on KSL when she posted an add for a new roommate and we instantly hit off. I moved in about a month or 2 later. We constantly had guys over as we were dating around. She found a man and moved out. I shortly after found myself a man and he moved in shortly after. This man became the father of my two youngest.
Let me give you a little more background information on my Ex Fiancé. My ex Fiancé, Jon, is an addict and unfortunately I didnt know the consequences or the severity of the situation I just put myself in because all I knew of drugs was, well nothing, other than what I've seen in the movies. I was determined to help him and get him back on track (stupid I know). The second day he came to hang out at my home with me, he had overdosed and pretty much died in my front lawn. My full intent was to bring his belongings to the hospital and never speak to him again. But because I wanted to try to help him I stayed. 

He promised he wouldnt do it again (typical). What i didnt know was he has been addicted to drugs since he was 13 years old. At that point he had already been using for 10 years!!! THATS A LONG TIME! I believed him and he decided to take my car out one night and completely destroyed my car. He was charged with a DUI and taken to jail. In the car I found heroine and weed as well as paraphernalia. He then again promised to do better and it wouldnt happen again. I hesitantly believed him and moved on.

At this point we had already moved to a new apartment and began our lives when I became pregnant with my now 4 year old daughter. I still didnt have the knowledge to detect drug abuse and didnt really know what to believe until he became sloppy and started leaving things around the house. I confronted him and he lied multiple times,  telling me I was crazy and I need to stop worrying and manipulated me into thinking he wasnt using drugs. Well eventually it came out and he told me he was doing both methamphetamine and heroin together. I was scared to say the least. For myself, for my son, and for him. 

Now back to the original story. After we moved into this apartment, I started seeing the slightest movement out of the corner of my eye. With just thr corner of my eye I saw a little boy crawling on the floor below our feet that were hanging off the edge of the bed as if he was playing. This little boy was the same height, same age, and had the same hair color as my 2 year old son. I could not see his face as his face was down as he was crawling on the floor. I brushed it off and thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. 

Time went by and I finally decided to discuss this with my fiancé to see if he has seen anything similar. He said he had seen this same boy in my old apartment. He said that him and his friend were hanging out at my house while I was at work. He stated that this little boy knocked on our door and came in our house and he had talked to him thinking it was my 2 year old son. Then he said that he remembered I had dropped my son off at daycare and had gone to work for the day and we haven't been home in hours. This freaked me out.

At night we kept my son's door closed so we could hear if he came out of his room at night.  One night we heard him in the middle of the night playing with his toys. Obvious sounds of toys moving in the toy box and him making sounds. I told him from behind the closed door to please go lay down and go to sleep its late. No response. I opened the door and my son was fast asleep in his bed. 

The next occurrence, I was arguing with Jon in my son's room. There was a hallway light right outside his door. The door was wide open and both Jon and I were faced towards my son talking to him. Suddenly the room went very dark, not black, but dark as if someone tall had walked past is down the hallway. Jon and I looked at each other and he searched the house. Nobody had broken in and entered our home. I then again brushed it off and honestly was concerned about possible 2nd hand exposure to the drugs he was using. I thought I was seeing things. 

Well time went on, still being lied to about his drug use and constantly fighting with him and kicking him out and constantly having the cops over to remove him from my home or him being arrested and sent to jail. 

Well, towards the end of my pregnancy, I started a work from home job for an Insurance company. While sitting at the desk waiting for another call to come in, I felt the eerie awful feeling of being watched. I turned my head and out of the corner of my eye, a lady was standing in my kitchen staring at me. She looked scared or sick but something was off. Maybe surprised that I knew she was there and saw her? She had long black hair, big brown eyes, red lip stick and defined features. You know who else has these characteristics? ME!!!! This girl was ME! 

From that point on i didnt see the little boy ever again. However, I saw her multiple times. She was sitting on the floor in the kitchen in the dark in fetal position. Jon said he also thought he might have seen this as well. Jon has told me he had talked to me in the mirror at one point as I briefly remember. 

I began to start setting up baby furniture, a crib specifically. I put this crib by the door where if you cracked it you could see the crib and only the crib. My bed sat diagonal from the crib and could see the Crack and the darkness behind it. One night I was laying in bed and I saw her again. This time looking through the Crack of my door into the crib. I paniced and had Jon move the crib away from the door where she couldn't see. At times I felt like things would disappear, like money I put above the desk that I didnt tell Jon about or the medicine I bought my daughter after she was born that conveniently went missing after using it once along with the receipt. Im still skeptical if that was her or Jon and his "sell everything and take anything" addict ways.

Jon One night woke up in straight panic after my daughter was born when he said he saw someone standing over my daughters crib. I was scared. At this point I was terrified to be alone in that house. I was doubting what I saw until Jons friend spent a few nights.... 

I asked him if he had seen anyone else in this house and he said "yes!" I said what have you seen. He said "this tall lady i saw her in that glass" he was referring to my glass table that was disassemble and facing behind the couch towards the kitched and where my desk sits. Scared I continued to question him. "What did she look like?" His response was "long black hair, red lips" i then began to explain to him what I had been seeing. 

Well, when my daughter was about 7 or 8 months old Jon decided he was going to panic and flip the entire house upside down after I found out he was still using drugs. He wanted to take my car in what I can only assume was to get more drugs as he was a little aggravated. After his tantrum, HE called the cops and made me speak to them and snatched the phone after I began to speak. The cops obviously got the signal that something was wrong and were at my house within minutes. Jon was arrested and the cops forced me out of my home to a dv shelter where my then 3 year old and then 8 month old stayed there until we could find a new home. As for the girl we all saw we didnt see any longer...... in that house......
 
In my last apartment, my friend was doing a tarot reading on me after my mom had passed away in may and I remember her saying "someones here" I was excited to maybe hear from my mother. Well a week later I was told by my friends boyfriend that she was standing in the corner watching us the entire time we were doing the reading.

I have seen her in all of my homes. At least all of the homes that Jon had done drugs in or had been to. I just moved from that apartment into a new apartment and I am constantly feeling watched. I am scared every night to open a dark room and see her im scared of every Crack I peer into. Im scared of any sound that is made. I have yet to see her but she has followed me everywhere Ive gone. I have saged and she is still here. 

Why is she here? Is she good or bad? Please help. Im so scared all the time. I just want to sleep without worrying im gunna open my eyes to her presence. Or im going to open the door and see her again. Please help. What is this?
