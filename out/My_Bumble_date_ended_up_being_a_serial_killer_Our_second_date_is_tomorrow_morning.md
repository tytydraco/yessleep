Now, from the title, I’m sure there’s probably a fair few questions. Questions like “Say, if you know they’re a murderer, why are you still seeing them?” “Are you trying to get yourself killed?” And “I’m a true crime enthusiast, could I get their number?”

To answer the questions, no, I’m not trying to get myself killed. And no, you can’t have their number. Get your own podcast subject, thank you very much.

As for the first question, well, the answer to that is a bit more complicated.

As a trans woman dating online, you’ll quickly find that your options are very limited. You’ll also find that most people tend to fall into a few categories. 

1. Chasers, gross.

2. Other trans people, very cool.

3. Weird old men, who are often number one and call you things like “Scrumptious.”

4. Transphobes who try and convince you you’re not who you say you are, which is entertaining for about five minutes.

5. People who didn’t read your profile, and then get mad when they eventually *do* read it and realize you’re working with different hardware than they expected.

Eagle eyed readers may notice that only one of those options is not revolting. So when I get lucky enough to stumble across one of those rare people, I tend to overlook more red flags than I normally would. For most people, “I cut my coke with caffeine powder” would be a massive red flag. To me, it just seems like they know how to party.

So when I swiped right on Chloe, the comment about having a bracelet made of human teeth seemed innocuous enough. I was surprised to see she also had swiped right on me, and was told to “make the first move!”

Transphobic of the app to ask me to make a first move, and thankfully, I didn’t have to. A few moments of staring at my screen later, I was greeted by a message in my inbox.

“hey there, youre cute! we should grab coffee sometime soon :)” 

“Oh for sure! I love the chai at this little place downtown, we could maybe do that?”

“sounds radical, babes. hows your schedule look tomorrow afternoon?” 

I felt my face get flushed. *God, I’m easy.*

“Oh, yeah! I’m free all day. Today was my Friday at work, actually, so I have the next two days off.”

“sick, if we vibe maybe we can head back to my place afterwards?”

I nodded, then sat there for a moment wondering how stupid I really was.

“For sure! Let’s meet up at one, that way if the vibes are good we have time to hang afterwards, if that works?”

Nothing for a few minutes. Then,

“yeah, that should probably work. i get off work at 12, so itll be close, but i should be able to manage”

“Looking forward to it!”

“likewise” 

And that was about it for that day. Seemed normal enough, really. More well adjusted than some people I’d seen.

The next morning, I got ready and arrived at the coffee shop a bit early, getting in at quarter to one, just in case she showed early. I sat for about twenty minutes before I saw her walk in through the front door. She definitely looked fresh off work, judging from the bags under her eyes. She smiled when she saw me wave her over though, sliding into the booth across from me with a soft grin.

“Hey, Emma, right? Glad you could make it.”

She rested her hands on the table, and I could just make out the edge of one of the teeth on her bracelet from underneath the sleeve of her Dickies work jacket. 

“Yeah, glad you could too! Hope work wasn’t too awful.”

“Oh, you know how jobs are, not exactly my favorite thing. But I at least had something to look forward to afterwards.”

I felt myself get flushed again, and she laughed a little.

“I’ll, uh. Go grab coffee. What sounds good?”

Chloe grinned up at me as I stood. “You said the chai was good, yeah? I’ll just do one of those.”

I nodded and made my way up to the counter, and returned a few minutes later with a pair of chais. I occasionally glanced back towards the table, expecting to see Chloe on her phone or something, but she was watching me the whole time.

I slid back into the seat, pushing the mug across the table to her. “So, what exactly do you do for work?”

Chloe took the mug and sighed, clasping it between her hands. “I work in a furniture factory. Eight hours a day of nothing but assembling dressers. Really living my best life, y’know?”

She laughed softly again, taking a sip of the chai. “Wow, this is good, you were right!”

I beamed back at her from behind my own mug. “There’s a few things I’m always right about, and good coffee and tea are a couple of them.”

She smiled, and the conversation just flowed real naturally from there. Even though we’d never met before, or spoken before, it felt like we just… clicked, you know?

We finished our tea and sat there talking for an hour afterwards, eventually getting dirty looks from the baristas. I noticed and blinked, not realizing how much time had passed.

“I’m gonna go pay, I think they’re about to throw us out.”

Chloe laughed again, nodding. “Yeah, probably not a bad idea. So… you wanna head back to my place?”

I paused for a brief moment before nodding. “Oh, uh, I took the bus here… would you mind-”

“Of course I’ll give you a ride, silly. My car is the black Miata out front, I’ll go start her up while you pay.”

She stood, her hand brushing over mine as she did, and I was reminded of just how into women I was.

I paid, apologizing to the barista who *definitely* did not accept it, left a generous tip, and slid out the door and into Chloe’s passenger seat. She watched me as I put my seatbelt on, and I thought I saw her nod as I did.

“Safety first, right, babes?”

I let out a short cough, nodding, as she laughed again, and we were spending through downtown.

The conversation continued as she drove, and I kept finding my eyes drawn to the bracelet. Up closer now, the teeth definitely weren’t, like, her baby teeth or anything like I had thought they might have been. They were different sizes, some big, some small, some chipped. One was cracked square down the middle. The teeth rattled as she turned the wheel and flipped her signals on, and I kept having to pull my eyes away.

We arrived at an apartment complex about a 15 minute drive away, and as we stepped in I was overwhelmed with a sweet smell, almost like strawberries. I guess my reaction was visible, because Chloe chuckled a bit as she closed the door behind me. “Yeah, the neighbor has pets who they don’t take care of, so I use a lot of very strong air freshener.”

I nodded, as I heard a deadbolt being slid, and a lock being turned. I looked quizzically at the door and she chuckled again. “Just to be safe.”

I nodded slowly, but this was the first time the red flag had looked less like a pretty decoration and more like a warning sign. I felt hairs stand up on the back of my neck, and I propped myself against a wall as Chloe hummed, moving around in the kitchen. 

“So, where’d the teeth come from for the bracelet?”

She paused, the humming stopping for a moment, before clearing her throat. “Lots of places.”

“Kinda vague, isn’t it?”

She chuckled again. “I can’t give away the secrets of tooth retrieval, people tend to get wigged out.”

I canted my head to one side, looking at her. “That sounds… ominous.”

She sighed, shutting a cabinet with a little more force than strictly necessary. “Nah, nothing like that. I’m not going around and kicking schoolgirls in the face or anything.”

I pursed my lips for a moment, but nodded. “Well, that’s… a good first step, I guess.”

She laughed, but she was definitely not finding that funny. “You thirsty? I have Doctor Pepper, apple juice, water…”

“Doctor Pepper would be great, thanks.”

She nodded, and she pulled two bottles out of the fridge, setting them on the countertop. I peeked over her shoulder, and couldn’t help but let out a yelp.

Behind the bottles of soda, I could just make out a severed head, resting on a baking tray. A middle aged man, his skin as pale as newly fallen snow, aside from the streaks of dried blood running down his chin.

Chloe whipped around, and looked back at the fridge, then to me, clearly putting the pieces together.

“Hey, Em, listen, babes. It’s not what it looks like, alright? I can explain, just-”

That was the last thing I heard before my skull bounced off the counter, and I landed on Chloe’s cold tile floor. She threw her hands to her mouth and ran towards me, the last thing I saw being her concerned expression as I fainted.

I wasn’t sure how much time passed before I woke up, a blanket over me, laid on a couch in Chloe’s living room. The still sealed bottle of soda rested on the coffee table, and Chloe was pacing across the living room. She saw me stir, and took a step towards me, pausing and clutching her hands. 

“Ok, look, I know this probably looks really bad.”

“Yeah, dude, you have a severed head in your fridge. That’s textbook psycho behavior.”

She sighed. “I promise, I can explain this and you won’t hate me, yeah? I didn’t think you’d see that, otherwise I would’ve moved it somewhere more private…”

I just stared at her. “You’re talking like you’ve done this-”

“Yes, of course I’ve done this before. Where do you think this came from?”

Chloe shook her right hand emphatically, and the tooth bracelet rattled. I shuddered.

“Just… hold on.” She darted into another room, and I tried to stand, but as soon as I got to my feet, my knees buckled again, and I ended up back on the couch, groaning. 

Chloe came back with a black leather wallet, with a white eagle design on it. “This is that guy’s, alright? Look.”

She flipped open the wallet, and the I.D. photo did seem like the same guy. 

“Now, look.”

She overturned the wallet, and what looked to be money fell out. She picked one up, though, and handed it to me. I could tell it was one of those fake bills people leave as tips sometimes, that hav a bible thing on the back and aren’t real money. This one, though, was full of some of the most heinous homophobic stuff I’d seen outside of 4chan.

I recoiled from the bill after reading it, tossing it on the ground. Chloe nodded, gesturing to the small pile of ten or so of those fake bills. “This guy wasn’t a sucker who fell for one and kept it, he was a homophobic prick and he deserved what he got.”

She glared, not so much at me, but just in general. I could tell she was getting worked up. 

“Look. I know this is a lot for a first date, but I really like you, Em…”

I tried to stand again, but sunk back into the couch with a groan. Chloe rushed to my side and continued speaking, “...But you’re clearly not right, you hit your head real hard. I’m gonna take you to urgent care, and then if you’re willing, can we meet up tomorrow morning?”

I just nodded. She was right, I was not right. My vision was fuzzy and I could not focus. The last thing I knew before passing out was her lifting me up, and thinking *She probably is real used to this too, huh?*

I woke up in a hospital bed, with a note folded on a chair next to me. 

*Hey,*

*Didn’t wanna stay, figured it might be an overstep. Doctor’s said you probably have a minor concussion, so maybe push that second date back a couple days to let you recover.*

*I promise, I can explain, and if you give me a chance, I’ll make you see things my way, cool?*

*Rest up, babes.*

*Love, Chlo.*

I just sighed and leaned back into the bed.

I was discharged the same night, and arrived home around nine. I texted Chloe, and got an answer almost immediately. 

“Hey.”

“hey! feeling better?”

“Yeah. Got discharged, so I’m home now.”

“good, good. glad to hear it.”

I let that message sit for a minute, then she texted again.

“so… tomorrow morning, if youre feeling better?”

I sighed, responding with a thumbs up emoji.

“cool, cool. ill come by, i can make you brekkie if you want”

“Brekkie?”

“what aussies call breakfast”

“Oh, right. Uh… Sure. I’ll see you at nine.”

“thank you. ill see you then. sleep well, darling”

Even though this woman had shown me a severed head in her fridge, I still got giddy at the last message.

Now, that was a long winded way to answer the first question posed in this story. I’ll leave with another question;

What should I wear?
