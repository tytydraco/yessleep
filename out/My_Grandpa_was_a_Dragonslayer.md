That's what my parents told me.

 It was the end of summer, the cold fall air was starting to come in, when my parents sat me down to give me a talk. My mother took a long breath, 

  "Lucas, your grandpa is going through a very tough time right now, he is currently fighting a ferocious dragon, and so he may seem a little off sometimes, but just know he is very tired from fighting the dragon"   

I was a bit confused at the time. A dragon? I had no idea my grandpa was a Dragonslayer. My 6 year old brain was overjoyed.  

 "Grandpa fights dragons?! He's even cooler than I thought!"   

There was a somber look in my mother's eye, but she said nothing afterwards and just rubbed my shoulder.

 A couple weeks later we went over to my grandparents house for a visit. The waft of fresh baked chocolate chip cookies fills the air as we walk in, my grandma made the best cookies in the world. My grandpa sees me and his eyes light up with that same joyous love they always do.  

 "Heya there sport! How's my favorite second baseman doing?"   

"Grandpa! I play third base, you know this!" I respond while giggling   

"Oh r-right of course, I'll grab the gloves and we can go toss the ball around"  

 He walks towards the kitchen before catching himself, then walks upstairs to go grab our baseball gloves.   The autumn leaves were starting to fall as we went outside to play catch. My grandparents house was in a nice neighborhood that had a lot of trees. Ray's of sunshine were flowing through the trees as we tossed the baseball around.  After we play for a bit, we go back inside and help ourselves to my grandma's favorite chocolate chip cookies.

   "I can't believe you're really a dragon slayer grandpa!" 

  My grandpa's eyes widened for a half second before going back to his usual, joyous self. 

  "Haha, well an old man can have a few secrets can't he?" 

  "I want to help you fight it!" I insisted   

"Haha! I'd love to have you help me, but sadly I fight the dragon after your bedtime every night"

   I pouted, but that seemed like a reasonable enough explanation for my 6 year old self. 

  Shortly after we finish eating the cookies, my parents and I pack up in our car and wave bye as we pull out of the driveway.  

&#x200B;

 That was the last time I saw my grandpa at his house. 

&#x200B;

  That night I dreamt of a dragon. It spouted fire from it's mouths and snarled as it stared at me. I shook in fear as the dragon raised it's claw and began a massive swipe at me. I could see the razor sharp edges at the end of each finger that looked about as big as me.   But all of a sudden my grandpa was there, clad in shining silver armor. he raised a mighty shield and deflected the dragon's claw, before shouting to me  

 "C'mon sport! We got a dragon to fight!" 

   All of a sudden I realized I also had a sword and shield, perfectly fit to my size. My fear had evaporated when I saw my grandpa, and I let out a roar as I charged to follow my grandpa towards the dragon.  

 I woke up with a start immediately after. I felt frustrated I couldn't end up fighting the dragon, but I was still smiling thinking of my grandpa being a heroic dragon slayer.

   The months go by as school starts and we aren't able to visit my grandparents, though I did manage to talk to them on the phone sometimes. My grandpa started to seem less like his usual self; he was still the kind old man I came to know and love, but he seemed to be talking like he was distracted by something, and lost his train of thought frequently. 

   My parents told me he was just tired from fighting the dragon. 

 6 months after I had the dream about fighting the dragon, I had another similar dream. The dragon was there, and my grandpa was too, but things were different. My grandpa was pinned under the dragon's talons, and looked to be struggling. 

  "Grandpa! GRANDPA!" I shouted 

  My grandpa looked at me, but the usual joyous glow that was always in his eyes wasn't there.   He looked scared, confused. 

  I wasn't about to just let the dragon win though. I drew my sword and charged towards the dragon, it stared at me with dark, soulless eyes. 

 I woke up with a jolt, panting. I was scared, not of the dragon, but of what was gonna happen to my grandpa. 

&#x200B;

2 months later, my parents tell me we are gonna meet grandpa at the hospital. When we walked in the room, my grandma was crying quietly. She quickly wiped her eyes as we walked in the room.   "Hey buddy, grandpa might be a bit confused right now, he's very tired from fighting the dragon, but just know that he loves you and that will never change.   I give my grandma a big hug. I didn't want her to cry, I wanted to be brave for her.

 My parents and I walked up to my grandpa. He was laying on the hospital bed, he looked like he was looking at something a million miles away. My mom was the first one to speak 

  "Harry… this is your grandson, Lucas. You remember him right?"

   "Lucas? Hmmmmm. Oh right! How could I forget! My favorite baseball player! You play for the Detroit Tigers right? 3rd baseman?"

   I giggled   "Grandpa! I'm only 6! I can't play for the Tigers yet!"

   "Oh r-right, I'm sorry buddy" 

&#x200B;

  He's never called me buddy before. 

&#x200B;

  I was confused, but at the time I chalked it up to him being tired from fighting the dragon. Still, I couldn't help but feel a hint of sadness as we walked out of the hospital room. But right as I was about to head through the door my grandpa shouted. 

  "Hey sport!"  

 I looked back and for just a glimpse, I saw that same joyous love in my grandpa's eye.  

&#x200B;

 "I'm gonna beat that dragon"

&#x200B;

I smile at him before heading out the door. The drive home was quiet, I could tell my mom was sobbing quietly into her coat, my dad was driving, his eyes looked somber in the rearview mirror.  

 "Dad, is the dragon too strong for grandpa to beat?" 

  My dad looks at me and sighs deeply.  

 "I don't know Lucas, but I know he's gonna try" 

&#x200B;

That night, I had another dream.     The dragon was there, and so was my grandpa. But this time, the tides had turned. My grandpa fought furiously, all while laughing with his same, joyous laugh. I see him climb onto the back of the dragon, the dragon bucking wildly to get him off.  

  "Grandpa! Grandpa, I'm here!" I shout 

  He looks at me with those same joyous eyes.  

 "Heya there sport, toss me that rope! I know you got a mean throw!" 

 Right as he said it I realized there was a bundle of rope right next to me. I pick it up and throw it with all my strength. Miraculously, my grandpa reaches out one arm and catches it. 

  "Thanks sport! I can always rely on you!"

  My grandpa swings the rope around the dragon, getting it right through it's mouth. The dragon bucks even more wildly, but my grandpa holds on. Eventually, the dragon submits, and stops bucking. I stare at my grandpa on the back of the dragon. He was not only a Dragonslayer, he was a dragon rider!  

 "We did it grandpa! We beat the dragon!"

   He takes a long look at me, with those same joyous eyes, and smiles. Then he guides the dragon into the air as he flies away. 

 

   My grandpa died that night.  

&#x200B;

   It was a sad day, my mom was sobbing the whole time as my dad tried to comfort her, and I couldn't even bring myself to cry. I was confused, I thought we won. If we beat the dragon, why did my grandpa die? 

 The funeral was a few days after. A soft breeze made the trees rustle. It was a small event, he wouldn't have wanted anything else. There was a lot of crying, and a lot of speeches about the great person he was. As the ceremony came to a close, my grandma came up to me and tried to smile.  

   "Your grandpa wrote this for you a few months ago, as he was first starting to fight the dragon" 

  She handed me a letter. I thanked her and gave her a big hug, promising I'd find the dragon that did this.   

 As the sun started to set, my parents started to pack up the car. On the ride home I decided to open the letter. It read:     

Dear sport,  

 I know how this must feel right now. I was supposed to beat the dragon! Then why am I not there 

still? Well Lucas, there's something you should know about this dragon. Truth be told, I had no idea 

this dragon was coming; it came out of nowhere, and was as surprising as it was scary. I was scared, 

sport. I know that might seem surprising to you, your brave old grandpa being scared, but I was. 

Dragons are scary, even to old-timers like me. But there was one thing kept me pushing on, kept me fighting. 

That thing was you, sport. You were my sword and shield, my shining silver armor. I couldn't have 

fought the dragon without you. I know you can't see me now, but trust me when I say I'm out there 

going on adventures. I carry you and your grandma and your parents with me, you guys are my 

courage, my protectors. I don't know where I'm going, but I know I'm gonna be okay because I have 

you with me. I love you, sport. Hit a home run for your old grandpa huh?     

&#x200B;

Your favorite Dragonslayer, 

Grandpa.
