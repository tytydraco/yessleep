I've been working at The Golden Fork for three years. It's one of Lansnat's oldest establishments - the sort of restaurant where business deals are sealed over lunch and couples mark their anniversaries. Nothing remarkable ever happens here, or at least that was true until today.



I was working my usual lunch service when he entered. There are moments when the atmosphere of a room fundamentally shifts - when the very air seems to acknowledge something significant has occurred. That's precisely what happened when this gentleman walked in.



His attire was impeccable - a bespoke black suit that spoke of old money and refined taste. Gold-rimmed spectacles caught the light peculiarly, and his silver beard was trimmed with almost surgical precision. But it was his eyes that captured my attention - ice blue, and somehow... ancient. He carried an ebony cane with a silver handle, placing his bowler hat with deliberate care at the centre of the table.



I should mention - I'd just read about the murders near Le Petit Café. Two university students found dead in Nightdew Gardens. The morning papers reported they were last seen at the bar, heavily intoxicated and rather amorous. By dawn, they were found... well, the details are rather unpleasant.



The gentleman ordered a medium-rare ribeye with such exacting specifications that our chef emerged to confirm the details. Temperature, timing, even the precise thickness of the cut. As I was serving his wine (an exceptional Bordeaux), a detective arrived.



I recognised him as a detective from his badge - Detective Carl Blackwood. That's when matters took a rather unsettling turn.



The detective began inquiring about Le Petit Café, about the previous night. About the murders. But the gentleman's responses were... peculiar. He barely glanced up from his steak, cutting each piece with mechanical precision. The knife never scraped against the plate - each cut was perfect, as though he'd performed this exact action countless times before.



Then he said something that chilled me to the core: "The rotation, life from beginning to end."



I was attending to water service at the adjacent table, attempting to appear uninvolved in their conversation. But I couldn't help noticing how the temperature seemed to plummet around them. The ice in their water glasses developed a layer of frost - in a heated restaurant. Other patrons appeared oblivious, but I observed their breath forming visible clouds in the air.



The gentleman produced identification: Rabinsey King Steve from Leads. Something about that name... During my break, I wrote it down and began examining the letters. What I discovered led me to immediately destroy the paper. Some revelations are better left unexplored.



His gratuity was precisely 42.7% of the bill, calculated to the penny. But here's what's truly disturbing: Upon reviewing our security footage, the gentleman appears to be dining alone. The detective isn't visible at all. Yet I distinctly remember serving them both. I heard their entire conversation.



Even more disconcerting - the murders occurred at exactly 12:42 AM. The gentleman's bill totalled £124.20. His table number? 42. Even his wine selection was a 1942 vintage.



I'm writing this from our break room. My shift ended two hours ago, but I find myself unable to leave. He's standing across the street, watching my window. His eyes appear to be... illuminated in the darkness. The street lights around him are flickering in a pattern that resembles numbers: 4-2.



The temperature continues to drop. Frost is forming on the windows. Those words echo in my thoughts: "The rotation, life from beginning to end."



\[Edit: Something has occurred. The gentleman has departed, but left an envelope bearing my name. Inside was a single sheet with a time written upon it: 12:42 AM. Tonight's date appears below.



I attempted to contact Detective Blackwood at the police station, but they claim no one by that name is employed there. I tried Le Petit Café as well, but received only static and what sounded like... whispers. The same whispers I've been hearing since discovering that envelope.



It's 11:57 PM now. Frost covers every window. My breath is visible in the air. The digits on my phone keep changing to 42. If anyone understands what's happening... please help.\]
