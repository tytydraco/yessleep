Let me preface this by saying that I was desperate.

I was a broke college student with no other family in America, an apartment to pay off, and of course, student loans for not only regular college but medical school and residence. I would not make much money anytime soon, only after I began residency. That would be, as I counted, in 6 years.

Rajesh, my friend and classmate, listened to my woes in the cafeteria over some soggy fries that we split. He was a great guy- he was also majoring in pre-med studies and always offered to study with me. 

"I may have a solution to your problems," he began. "I work at some gym and there's a recent vacancy. My manager is hiring."

I was so broke and so desperate, and this seemed like the ultimate holy grail. A beam of light in an otherwise dark world.

"Sure, I'll take it!" I excitedly said. (My English wasn't as great as I make it out to be). "Where is it? How can I apply?" 

Rajesh pulled out his phone and scrolled through his contacts. "Here, this is my manager's number. You can just text him, he's desperate for a new worker. For some reason nobody wants to apply."

The first thing I noticed about the number was that it started with (000). Since I wasn't much familiar with area codes of USA, I didn't think much of this but I did observe that this was a bit odd. I won't disclose the whole number here, but I was so happy to get it that I floated all the way back to my dorm and eagerly texted Rajesh's manager, hoping desperately to get a job.

I wasn't sure how to start the text, so I just wrote *Hello, this is Becky,* \[obviously not my real name\] *a friend of Rajesh's. I heard that you were hiring and I was hoping to apply for a job at your workplace.*

Almost immediately, I got a text back. *Hello Becky! We're so glad that you are choosing to apply to our workplace. There is no need to attach a resume, we just wish to ask you a few questions by text.*

I wasn't sure how hiring processes worked in America, I thought this was perfectly normal back then, so I replied *Sure.*

The questions were mostly normal, asking about my work habits (hard worker), past work experience (none), and greatest strength (logical thinking). Only one question I thought was a little strange - are you able to resist temptations? I wasn't exactly sure, so I thought for a bit and wrote *Yes.*

*Thank you for completing this interview. I'm happy to say that you have been hired. Our address is at \[Somewhere in Ohio, I don't want to get in the specifics\]. Please let us know what times you are available.*

\--------------------------------

The next day, at promptly 6 am, I woke up with a new vigor. I aggressively made my bed, did 300 sit ups, made coffee for me and my roommate, and yanked my hair into a ponytail. As I checked the address, I noticed that the gym was on a fairly empty, but still used street in downtown. It appeared to be on the second floor.

The staircase was sandwiched between a deli shop and a *Romance Only! Discounts Daily!* book store. The bookstore was right on the end of a street intersection, so the gym got to face both sides of the street. This may seem trivial, but it made what happened next very odd. 

I walked in through the chipped wooden door painted black, and climbed up the stairs. For two floors, it did not feel like two floors. It felt like 20. The staircase was dark and dingy, and my heavy footsteps echoed and pounded on the floor. Why couldn't they make a nicer entryway?

After what seemed like the billionth step, I finally made it up to a door.

It was open just a sliver, and bathed in sort of a greenish-blue light. There were no windows, and it was oriented strangely triangularly. Dark, gleaming wooden pews were lined up in the room all facing something that I couldn't see. the floor was bare and had an odd, musty smell. Strangest of all, there were very large windows on the walls which looked in a solid white expanse. The room had a sort of magnetism about it. I felt frozen in place, my singular blue eye peeking through the crack, almost voyeuristic.

Then, I saw an even more bizarre sight. The room's dim fluorescent lights started slowly, methodically, rythmically going out with a bang. One by one, one by one. I felt my body being pulled towards the sight, but then I remembered the question I was asked.

*Are you able to resist temptations?*

I stared at the door until 2 lights went out, until I felt a cold, firm hand on my shoulder. This hand proceeded to yank me away from the door and slammed it shut. When I looked up at my interceptor in fear, I saw a woman with straw-blond hair and a muscular build.

"Are you here for the gym?" she asked kindly.

"Y-yes..." I said faintly, still unable to process what I was seeing. "I got a job here."

"Great!" She said. "We've been looking for new people a while now. For some reason, nobody has replied to our calls for applications."

The woman, whose name I learned was Katie, led me through another door opposite of the pew-room, in which there were dozens of gleaming metal machines. She walked me through what my job was, which was to supervise the gym room and to help our clients if they needed anything. Finally, she gave me a laminated list of rules to help me with remembering all of this.

*Yes, reader, I know that the rules trope is horribly overused. I know that they are wickedly entertaining to read. There were no odd rules on that list.*

My first shift ended with no clients, and just as I was about to walk out of the door, I remembered something.

"Katie?" I asked, nervously."

"Yeah?" she replied.

"What was that... door... that I saw earlier? You know, the one you pulled me away from?"

Her face was like a TV screen glitching. Momentarily, her expression turned to horror, but came back just as chipper as before. 

"That's just a little quirk of this job. There shouldn't be much reason for you to enter that door, since there's nothing really there. But if you do go in, and I assure you that you probably won't, you will probably never go in, you need to go in with at least 2 other people. Keep the door locked at all times, and if does come unlocked, it's fine. See you tomorrow!"

I wasn't sure what to make of all that, so I thanked Katie and made my way down the stairs. The climb down seemed to be a lot less scary, and I had accepted the door as a strange, but unavoidable part of this job. I tried, but couldn't resist sneaking a look at the door. Only 1 light was left on.

Checking my watch, I saw that I had enough time to go to the park to eat lunch before I had to get back to class. When I walked across the street, I looked back and saw something bizarre.

There were no windows in the unit neighboring the gym. There was no door, no black paint chipping away. In fact, the longer I looked at the building, the more wrongness there was. There was a dentistry shop set up in the place where the gym should have been, and apparently the bookstore had two floors.

I heard a loud *bang*, just like the one when the lights went out.

A long, loud, high scream emanated from somewhere above, but I just couldn't pinpoint where it was coming from.
