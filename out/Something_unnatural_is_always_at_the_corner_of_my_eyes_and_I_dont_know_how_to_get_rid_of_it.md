Do you ever get the feeling when you’re walking home alone after dark that someone is following you or when you look out through your bedroom door into the dark hallway that someone is out there, waiting for you to fall asleep?

What if that feeling persisted? 24 hours a day, seven days a week. What if you are constantly on alert because a sinister feeling hangs over you like a stormy cloud?

I am experiencing something similar and I have no explanation for it. It’s strange; it’s creepy; it’s ominous. Is it malicious? I can’t really tell. I’ve decided to document it here in hopes of easing my burden just a little bit, even if I don't find anyone who has gone through the same as I am. I’ve been so lonely and exhausted and I just want to put it out there in case something happens to me. So, here it goes.

It started a year ago.

October 6, 2023. Specifically, on my birthday. Now, I’m not trying to say that my turning 23 has anything to do with what I am experiencing, but it seems like an important detail to mention. I’m not a huge birthday person. I prefer small hangouts with friends and family and I heavily despise the tradition of cake-cutting, but the fact that my … “troubles” started on my birthday seems a little hard to ignore.

So I will start with that.

It was my birthday. I was just completing my shift at my campus library. I had picked up this job earlier that year when I saw the opening. There wasn't much to do for me, given that there weren't many students visiting the library, especially at that hour. I usually just kill time catching up with coursework and assignments. Occasionally, I would have a few visitors who would need my service but it was a good three hours for me to have some quiet time to myself.

It was 8 pm when I packed up my bags, said bye to the head librarian, and left.

It is a ten-minute walk to my dorms. There is a convenience store nearby, so the area isn't too desolate and there are usually always pedestrians around. It’s a nice walk.

On that day, the walk was the same as usual. Thinking back, I realise how a few things may have been odd that I chalked up to my fatigue, but I do remember feeling a tingling unease in the back of my mind. I remember looking around, fidgeting a bit, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary. The large blinking lights on top of the store spelling out its name. The cashier standing there bored and scrolling on her phone. A couple or two standing huddled together, speaking in soft whispers.People walking briskly along the streets minding their own business. Really, nothing seemed out of place. But the unease continued.

It was only when I turned a corner that I realised where the feeling stemmed from.

As I turned left, a figure came into view in my periphery, quite far away but my instincts told me I was being followed. My heart had leapt to my mouth at the sight, but I walked a few steps before I stopped. I stood with my back to the wall, looking at the turn I came from. Thinking back, it was probably a stupid idea. If I was really being followed, what was I expecting waiting for my stalker to show up? Anyway, I stood there for a few minutes and I started walking again, an added urgency to my steps.

The rest of the walk, I had the intense feeling I was being followed. But every time I turned back, there was no one. No one who looked like they were following me a second ago, at least.

I reached my dorms safely. My friends, Jaime and Carla, and my roommate, Phil were waiting in my room, a cake laid out on a table in the middle. It wasn't a surprise; they had warned me they were going to do it, knowing I disliked celebrating my birthdays, just to soften the blow. I am always baffled by how people insist on getting you a cake and making you sit through the whole ordeal, no matter how much you protest that you do not like it. On that day, however, I was grateful. I was happy to see my friends, relieved at the bright lights and the normalcy. For the rest of the night, the unease was pushed off my mind.

It was the weekend the next day. And it was the day that the severity of my situation became clear to me.

After a quick breakfast, I headed towards the library, not for my shift, but to study for my exams. As soon as I stepped outside my dormitory area, the unease from last night returned, and the fear associated with being followed descended upon me.

You know when a character stumbles upon a crucial scene in a movie and the soundtrack pauses? There is silence all around and everything is in slow motion. I could still hear the noises and chatter around me but it was as if the world had … died? The imaginary soundtrack of my life had paused, indicating the grave danger that I was in. The camera would move slowly in a circle, then pan at something behind me, where a serial killer or a knife-wielding maniac would show up with a sharp, sudden sound of thunder.

But of course, when I turned back there was nothing out of the ordinary.

I closed my eyes for a few seconds and started walking towards the library.

The incident from the night before was easy to ignore. After all, it was night, and even the most rational of people would feel a little bit spooked when faced with the mystery of the dark. Now though? Now there was no explanation. It was daylight, and the sun was illuminating every bit of surface I could see. There was no reason for me to feel this way. No reason for a potential stalker to follow me with so many witnesses around.

I kept my eyes firmly on my feet as I hurried along. The whole time my spine tingled horribly, like there was an ominous being running behind me, their long clawed arms reaching out, getting closer, the tips of their sharp nails almost touching the back of my collar. My shoulders cringed in horror and bunched up. I ran the last few steps and stopped sharply at the door.

The clawed hands retracted.

A figure appeared at the corner of my eyes and I turned sharply, backing up against the wall of the library. There was no one. Of course there wasn't. But I was so sure there was someone. A human silhouette just at the end of my peripheral vision, vanishing as soon as I looked towards it. I couldn't even dismiss it as the darkness playing tricks on me.

I walked into the library and collapsed on one of the tables.

What was happening to me? There was no way someone could have followed me like that in broad daylight, and even if they did, how did they vanish just like that? I scrunched up my eyes and tried to think back to the walk. There was no one, I had seen no one, except at the last moment when I had reached the library. Yet, I had felt it, as clear as day. Someone behind me. Very close, almost touching. And the fear in me was undeniably real.

Somehow, I pushed the thoughts to the back of my mind and concentrated on my books.

Jaime appeared at the library an hour later. He smiled a little when he saw me and joined me at the table. I contemplated telling him about what was happening to me, but there was no way I could explain it without sounding crazy. But the thought of walking back alone terrified me so I decided to tell him a watered-down version of what had really happened.

“I think someone is following me.”

Jaime regarded me for a few seconds. He didn't dismiss me immediately, which I was grateful for and he looked mildly concerned. “Are you sure?” I remember coiling back at the thought of him not believing me. He hurried to add, “I mean, this is a protected area, if there was a suspicious person around, someone would notice.”

“I know, I know.” I felt my voice shaking. Just thinking of the tingling feeling on my back and the intense fear made my heart rate go up again. “I don't know. I haven't actually seen anyone, but whenever I’m outside, I feel like I’m being followed or watched.”

I looked carefully at Jaime, ready for him to laugh at me or call me paranoid. But he sat with a frown on his face, tapping his pen on the table. “Well, I think you should tell someone. Report it. Just in case.”

I nodded, though I wasn’t sure if I would really tell. What would I even say? The whole idea seemed ridiculous even to me and I couldn’t imagine explaining it to the authorities.

When Jaime was about to leave an hour or so later, I asked him if I could walk to the dorms with him. He was supposed to go to campus, I think, or somewhere else, but he agreed to walk me all the way to my room. Looking back, I realise how much love and support I’d received from the people around me, without which I wouldn't be sitting here writing my story.

I had a mild hope that with my friend next to me, the sense of being followed wouldn't be there. But it was. And it was stronger. As soon as I stepped outside, it hit me like a truck. Jaime frowned at me and then looked around. But there was no one suspicious around, of course. It was all in my head.

He held out an arm. “If it makes you feel better, you can take my hand.”

That didn’t quite make me feel better as I felt weighed down by a deep anxious feeling in my chest. But it did make me laugh. I grabbed his arm and let him pull me along.

I stayed inside my room all day. Phil, my roommate,  was worried but since I didn't tell him anything, he assumed I was just unwell. Jaime brought me food and snacks and kept me company. I couldn't realistically spend my days locked inside but that was all I had for that moment.

I wish I could tell you that I was really being stalked by a human predator and that he was apprehended and that I was safe. But things really only worsened after that. It wasn’t just a fear in my head anymore, but every time I went outside, I saw something. A dark figure. A silhouette with barely any facial features, right around the corner of my eyes. It didn't have any movement akin to walking, but when I walked it seemed to follow me; float towards me. Surprisingly, it never came closer and always remained at a safe distance. Always watching.

There was one incident that I think is worth mentioning.

It was a few months after my birthday. Exam season, so there was tension hanging in the air. I had just entered my building, relieved at the safety of the walls and the escape from the ominous figure that followed me. It was more or less a permanent thing now. I didn't just feel it anymore, but I saw it. Every time I stepped out into the streets. And it made my insides crawl. I had started to walk with my head low, eyes sharply on my feet but it was there, always there just outside the corner of my eyes. If I turned sharply towards where I had just seen it, it would vanish but I would again see it behind me. Of course, it wasn't physically possible for a normal person to move swiftly like that, which meant I could not tell anyone about what I was experiencing without them sending me off to a mental hospital. So I kept it to myself, except occasionally sharing bits and pieces with Jaime when he insisted. I could tell he wanted to help but there was nothing he could do, so I told him that I was just imagining things, exam pressure and all that. He wasn't too convinced.

Anyway, my exam started that day. I almost managed to forget about the figure as I scratched words into my exam paper. Perhaps I got too comfortable, as I have now realised that was one thing my mysterious follower didn't want. About half an hour into the exam, I felt the hair rise on my arms. It was nerves from the exam, of course, I thought to myself. I almost folded myself up on the table, eyes so close to my paper that I couldn't see my surroundings. *Please don't please don't.* I kept repeating to myself as I tried to recall a specific trigonometric formula. I squeezed my eyes to limit my vision, hoping it was just the exam fever.

And then I felt it.

The tingling, ominous sensation that has been chasing me for the past months. It began on my lower back and rose slowly as I shivered. I felt my shoulders hunching up, my heartbeat going through the roof. I rubbed the back of my neck as I felt something soft and feathery moving over it. My hair has always been short but I had recently shaved it fully on the lower side when I had started feeling this exact sensation on my neck. As you can guess, it didn't work.

I tried to ignore the horrible feelings and concentrate on my exam, avoiding looking away from my paper as much as I could. At one point, I instinctively looked up towards the large clock on the wall and that's when I saw it. The same figure I had been seeing, standing right in the middle of the doorway, radiating such pure and ominous evil that I wanted to die right then and there. As before, it vanished as soon as I looked but reappeared at the back of the class.

I must have let out a gasp or something because the invigilator walked towards me. “Is everything okay?” he asked.

I nodded, breathless and tired and wanting to cry, and returned to my exam. I was no longer safe, not anywhere. It was there with me no matter where I was. I could no longer enter a building to feel safe, and even in my own room, I saw it standing in a corner. It never moved towards me, nor made any sound. Yet, it was there, always. I could not rest, I could not breathe normally anymore, as my adrenaline rush was constantly on high. If I ever dared to get used to its presence, which I assure you isn’t easy, nor very common, it vanished and reappeared when I dared, again, to feel relieved.

The exam season ended and with nothing to distract me anymore, I was vulnerable. I spent a lot of my time in Jaime’s room as he understood I was going through something even though I didn't tell him. He stopped asking after a while and just let me exist in his presence.

I tried to research my condition, looked into countless online forums to see if it had happened to anyone else. No one’s account seemed to match my own. Most people claimed to have seen their dead grandmother or uncle who attempted to give them life advice and the majority of those stories seemed made up, although I admit it is a bit rich coming from me. But being on constant high alert does things to you. I was cranky and irritated all the time, snapped at people for no reason, and the number of things I had thrown desperately at the ground or the wall had been exponentially rising. I pushed people away, and by the time summer break rolled around, I wasn’t on talking terms with Jaime, who was finally done with my rude behaviour. I was sorry to lose my friendship but I didn’t quite have the energy to feel sad about it.

The night before I was to leave for home, I lay in bed staring straight at the ceiling. The figure stood against the wall at the end of my feet and the constant, familiar rush of adrenaline flowed through me. I felt no fear; at least what I felt couldn’t be called fear. I was too devoid of emotions to feel anything. My roommate was gone too - he had applied for a new room when I yelled at him once, or maybe five or ten times, for being too noisy or for just existing. It was just me and my dark companion.

“What do you want from me?”

My voice sounded strange in my ears. I hadn’t spoken to anyone in a while and my throat seemed to have forgotten how to utter sounds. My eyes flitted towards the end of my bed and as expected, the figure was gone. I looked back up at the ceiling again and it reappeared.

“If you are going to kill me, just do it already.”

There was no response. It never moved or flickered, just remained still in its position. I tried to sit up but I could barely raise my fingers. I closed my eyes and started to cry.

The next day, before I was to leave campus, I found myself knocking on Jaime’s door. His roommate was the one who opened it and the look of disgust on his face would have once hurt me. He said some ugly words to me that I do not remember now but that I’m sure I deserved before Jaime appeared at the door and stopped him.

“What do you want, Noah?” 

I couldn’t meet his eyes. I looked at the ground as I said, “I’m going home today, I just wanted to say that I’m sorry for how I treated you. And thank you for everything you have done for me.”

I turned and walked away. A minute later, Jaime caught up with me and stopped me in my tracks. “Wait, Noah. Why do you sound like I’m not going to see you again?”

“It’s just summer break. I’ll be back.”

To my utter surprise, he hugged me. “Well, you better be back. I still have a lot of curse words I want to yell at you.”

When I reached home, I was met with the shocked looks of my parents and sister. They claimed that I looked skinny and worn out. They gushed over me for about an hour and fed me a huge meal. If I had had any minor hope that the figure wouldn’t follow me into my own home, I was stupidly and utterly wrong. While I was being hugged by my mother, it stood ominously at the doorway, right behind my father.

I finally managed to get to my bedroom. I flopped into bed and fell asleep, hoping that the last few months were just a bad dream.

I woke up in the middle of the night, shivering. Next to the bookshelf was a concentrated darkness, emanating an ominous aura. As I moved my eyes towards it, it moved elsewhere. I looked towards that spot again, and it reappeared behind me. I turned my whole body in that direction and it was behind me again. I kept following it. For an hour or maybe more. Maybe it was just a few minutes. I couldn’t tell. But I kept doing it. All the while my skin crawled and all the hair on my arms and legs rose. I felt my heartbeat behind my eyes. I was exhausted, fatigued, worn out. I wanted the agony to end. Following it with my eyes wasn’t doing anything but I felt an odd pleasure at returning the favour.

According to horror movies, the figure should be moving closer, day by day. Or maybe becoming larger. Posing a greater danger every passing second. But it never did. It always looked the same and stayed at the farthest possible distance. What did it want from me?

“What do you want from me?” I asked in a hoarse whisper as I continued turning around in the middle of my room. “I can’t take it. Please stop.”

The figure remained as nonchalant as ever, mocking me, waiting for my demise.

Once again, I started to cry.

Mum and Dad drilled me again the next day, trying to figure out my situation. I was too tired to speak and their interrogation tired me further. I managed to escape to my sister’s room eventually.

Naomi was five years younger than me. I suppose I wasn’t as close to her as most siblings due to our age difference but I felt comfort as I crawled into her bed and curled up into a ball. She wouldn’t interrogate me like my parents did and I felt grateful for that.

Naomi is the one person in the world who doesn’t take me seriously, so of course, she’s the one I completely opened up to. From the day of my birthday up until now, I told her everything. I teared up a few times while mentioning my friends who had left me but she listened to me patiently. When I was done, she remained silent. I couldn’t tell what she was thinking.

Suddenly, she grabbed my arm and looked closely at it. “Your hair is all on end. And you’re so cold.”

I nodded. “It has been like that constantly.”

She seemed to hesitate a little. “Do you still - uhm -” I could tell what she wanted to ask. “Can you see it? Now?”

I nodded again. Her eyes widened a little. She spoke the next words in a whisper. “You mean it’s in the room with us right now?”

“It’s standing next to your closet.”

She turned sharply towards it, arms curling protectively around herself. Her demeanour was familiar. It was the same that I had been feeling for several months now. Suddenly, I felt bad. Maybe I shouldn't have burdened my sister with this. She looked at me with worry. “I don’t know what to say. It must have been terrifying for you.”

That short note of acknowledgement seemed to lift a heavy rock off my chest. Of course, I wasn’t “cured” and I could still see the silhouette in her room and feel blood rushing through my veins. But I felt lighter. I closed my eyes and hugged a pillow to my chest.

A heavy object hit me on the head. Shocked, I looked at Naomi, who held a thick book in her hands. She was glaring at me. “Well, now I won’t be able to sleep here at night. You absolute tart.”

I stared at her in shock for a few moments. Then I started to laugh. I don’t remember the last time I had laughed like that. And it felt good. I wondered if my charming companion would take it as an offence and do something drastic later to ensure I had no joy left in me.

Maybe it wouldn’t do anything at all and I would go crazy simply at the constant anticipation of something horrible happening to me. Maybe that was its plan all along.

That was three months ago. I’m still at home. My parents themselves had insisted I take a few months off. They didn’t understand what I was going through but they felt that I needed a break. God knows what they think is wrong with me but I’m grateful to be able to stay at my childhood home with the people I love.

Jaime has called me a few times to check on me. So has Carla. But the calls stopped soon enough. Perhaps they were relieved at not having such a black hole of emotions around them. Truthfully, I didn’t have it in me to be hurt.

My condition hasn’t improved, of course. I cannot say it has worsened either. It just is.

I wake up in the middle of the night and for some reason, the act of following the figure around has become a nightly routine. It doesn’t bring me relief or validation. But I do it dutifully every single night.

I’m currently in my bed as I write my account. Tomorrow is my birthday. As I said I don’t take birthdays too seriously but let’s just say surviving this phenomenon for one whole year deserves some acknowledgement.

The mysterious figure is at my door. My hands are shaking as I am typing this on my phone. My back is against the wall but I have a feeling there is someone behind me. I have a scarf wrapped around my neck but the continuous feeling of a clawed hand reaching out to dig its sharp talons into the back of my neck is still here. My legs are folded before me, electricity shooting through them at intervals. My stomach is twisting and my chest is threatening to break open against the continuous rapid beats of my heart.

I’m tired. I’m alone. I want this to end.

I don’t expect you to have any solutions or advice for me. I just want to share what I’m going through and hope that one of you may be kind enough to pray, whether or not you believe in a god, that I reach an end to this.

…

Oh!

I just looked up at the silhouette and it did not vanish. I moved my eyes around my walls and it followed my gaze all the way. I can’t tell if having it in my direct line of vision is worse than having it in my peripheral vision at all times.

Oh. Oh my god. It’s midnight. It’s my birthday. Could it be that this new change has occurred exactly because of that? Was I really correct in assuming that it has something to do with my date of birth?

The figure has the same behaviour as usual; it’s only the position that has changed. I don’t know why but I feel an odd excitement. Has this really what my life has come to? Feeling thrilled about the supernatural entity that has been haunting me for a year?

Regardless, I’m eager to see how this plays out. I will keep you updated. But for now, I need some sleep.
