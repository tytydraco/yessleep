When I was young, I got in some trouble that I’m not proud of. I owed some money to some bad people, and out of sheer desperation, I decided the only way to get it was to rob a convenience store.

I picked a store at the edge of my city, a rundown place that people didn’t visit if they didn’t have to. It was three in the morning, so I figured I’d have the place to myself. It took me nearly twenty minutes to pry my own hands off the steering wheel, put my handgun in my jacket, and make my move.

I was right – the store was empty, except for the woman behind the till. She looked like she was in her mid-forties, with long black hair and a plain, unremarkable face. I pulled my gun on her, holding it awkwardly between us, threw a plastic bag on the counter, and choked out, “Put the money in the bag.”

She didn’t even blink. “Of course,” she said, opening the till. She counted out the bills methodically before placing them in the bag. As she worked, she said, “There’s probably more money in the back room. Why don’t you check the back?”

Something about the calm way she spoke sent chills up my spine. “Um… no thanks,” I said, cringing at how awkwardly I sounded. It felt like I was losing control of the situation for reasons I didn’t totally understand. “Empty the safe, too,” I said, trying desperately to sound threatening.

The woman finished emptying the cash register and turned around. She bent down to unlock the safe behind her. I was sweating hard – hadn’t I been inside a long time? It seemed to take her ages to enter the combination and swing open the door.

Then, she stood up. She was still facing away from me when she said, “You should really check the back.”

“What? No. Just give me the money and I won’t hurt you.”

That was when I saw her hair shift. On instinct, I moved my gun to point at her head, though I knew in that moment I’d never be able to shoot her. “Stop moving!” I shouted, but she didn’t respond.

Just then, her hair started to part, and I could see a face emerging from the back of her head. Its lips were twisted in a rictus grin, and its blank white eyes stared at me. The entire thing looked twisted out of shape, like something that had never seen a human face was trying desperately to replicate one.

“Why don’t you check in the back? Why don’t you check in the back? Why don’t you check in the back?” The voice that came from those frozen lips was shrill and mocking. Suddenly, the woman’s arms snapped backwards, reaching out to me with her palms up. I swear I actually heard her bones break, her arms not meant to extend so far in that direction.

I didn’t stay to see anything else – I left the money and ran while the voice kept calling after me and laughing and laughing.

I never did pay that money back. Instead, I skipped town without even bothering to take anything with me other than what was already in my car.

I drove for days, trying to get as far away from that city as possible. Eventually, I ended up on the other side of the U.S., intent on eking out a living under a fake name.

I was terrified the cops would come looking for me after my convenience store stunt, but it turns out my fears were misplaced. One morning, about a week after I skipped town, I came across a story about the convenience store while using a computer at the library.

*Gruesome robbery gone wrong at local convenience store leaves locals with questions, no answers*

*A local convenience store was the sight of a terrible tragedy, discovered on Wednesday morning by a patron.*

*The patron, who said they visited the store on occasion for cigarettes, was confused to discover the store closed during regular working hours. After trying to call the manager, a personal friend, and receiving no answer, he phoned the police.*

*What the police found left them in horror.*

*”In the back of the store, we found the body of the manager, Maya Fick. She had been attacked with what seems to be a hatchet,” said officer James Bentworth. “The medical examiner determined she had been hit over seventy times, with at least 20 blows to the face.” All the money in the register and the safe were gone, leading to the conclusion that the intent of the crime was robbery.*

*According to the police, the state of decomposition indicated that the victim had died about two weeks prior to the discovery of her body…*

I had to stop reading after that line as I did the math.

She’d been dead two weeks, but my ill-fated robbery attempt had happened just nine days ago. That meant I’d been in the store while a woman’s corpse rotted in the back.

I scrolled further down the page, skimming the rest of the story until I came across a large picture of Maya and stopped cold.

There, smiling at me from the computer screen, was the woman I’d tried to rob.

The woman who was already dead when I’d opened that door.

I exited out of my browser, powered down the computer, and walked out of the library. I never told anyone what I’d done or what happened, not even after I got back on my feet and made a new life for myself.

To this day, I wonder what would have happened if I’d done what the thing told me and found the body in the back room. I try to keep the thought away, but it always comes back, late at night.

And sometimes, I wake up in a terror, sure that I heard a whisper in my ear:

*Why don’t you check in the back?*
