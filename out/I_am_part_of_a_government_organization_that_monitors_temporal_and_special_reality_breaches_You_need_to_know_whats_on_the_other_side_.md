I always imagined the apocalypse would look different. 

More explosions. Fires. Some kind of disaster that you'd watch unfold on television until your eyes ached from the glow. But no, the world doesn’t end with a bang. It ends with a hum—a silent tremor at the edge of perception. You don’t even realize it's happening until you’re in it, drowning in a reality you don’t recognize anymore. 

That’s what the bleed felt like when I first stepped off the chopper. A faint pressure on the back of my neck, as if the air itself was wrong. 

I worked for a clandestine part of the government with the intentionally boring title of The Office of Oversight and Compliance, the OOC. But what they really did was manage temporal and special anomalies. Do you ever feel DeJa'Vu, or find yourself frozen forgetting why you were doing what you were doing? These are just tiny ripples of the effect known as the Bleed. Sources of large rips and tears in reality were quarantined and monitored by the OOC and had been for decades. 

I stood there, squinting at the stark outlines of Westfall Research Station, trying to ignore the low ache in my head. The sun was setting behind the snow-covered peaks, casting long, sharp shadows across the snow-dusted compound. Everything looked normal at first. Quiet, isolated, just like any other government outpost in the middle of nowhere. 

But it wasn’t normal. I could feel it. 

"Beautiful place to lose your mind," Dom said, slinging his pack over his shoulder as he stepped up beside me. His voice had the casual tone of someone who's seen too much. Dom was always like that—calm in a way that made me wonder what it took to rattle him. Military background, silent type. He squinted at the facility as if sizing it up for weaknesses. "They say this place used to be an old mining town. Guess the government decided it'd be perfect to hide out and poke holes in reality." 

I glanced at him, but he didn’t meet my eyes. Dom didn’t like talking about this stuff much. He was here to do a job. That’s how he saw it, and anything beyond that was irrelevant. 

We started up the path toward the station, the wind biting through my jacket, and the closer we got, the heavier that strange pressure felt. Like gravity had doubled, but only in my mind. I could feel it brushing against my skin, tickling the back of my brain, whispering. The reports we’d read before coming here were vague at best—anomalies in time and space, fluctuations in perception, and disturbances in electromagnetic fields. It had all sounded theoretical until now. 

Cassie, our engineer, had joined us, walking just a step behind. Her voice cut through the air, clear but tinged with tension. "You feel that?" she asked. She’d always had a sharp intuition, able to pick up on things the rest of us might miss. Her eyes flicked up to meet mine, confirming my own unease. 

"Yeah," I muttered, "I feel it." 

Cassie’s hand hovered over the radio clipped to her belt. "This bleed—it’s already active, isn’t it?" 

I nodded. "Has been for a while. We’re walking right into it." 

The facility was just as cold and sterile as the outside, a maze of concrete and metal corridors lit by harsh fluorescent lights. The entrance hall echoed with our footsteps, and the air inside felt heavier, and thicker. It was as though the walls were too close, the ceiling too low, but only in my head. I kept checking my watch—time felt slippery here, like it could slip through your fingers if you didn’t pay attention. 

We didn’t see anyone as we made our way deeper into the complex. That was the first red flag. The place wasn’t supposed to be abandoned. We’d been sent to investigate a lack of communication, sure, but we were supposed to find a team here. Yet all we got was silence. 

Cassie and Dom split off to check the labs while I headed to what was supposed to be the control room. The farther I went, the worse that pressure got. It was like trying to walk underwater like something invisible was pushing back against every step. My head pounded, but I pushed through, wiping sweat off my brow even though the place was freezing. 

The control room was empty, of course. Banks of computers hummed softly, casting eerie glows over the scattered papers and half-empty coffee cups. The chairs were turned askew as if their occupants had just gotten up and left, but they hadn’t. There was no sign of them. 

I stood there for a long moment, trying to make sense of the space, but my eyes kept drifting, unable to focus. One moment I’d be staring at the monitor, the next I’d realize I was looking at the far wall, with no memory of turning my head. Every blink felt like a flicker, like I was losing time. 

That’s when I heard it. 

A voice. Faint, echoing in the back of my mind. 

"Noah." 

I spun around, the hairs on my neck standing on end. The room was empty. 

"Noah..." 

It was a whisper now, familiar. Emily. But it couldn’t be. 

I squeezed my eyes shut and tried to breathe through it. Emily’s dead, I told myself. She’s dead. This can’t be her. But the bleed—God, it was already inside my head, pulling memories, warping perception. It was like it could sense what hurt the most, what you feared the most, and it used it to keep you hooked. 

I reached for my radio. "Dom, Cassie—how’s it looking over there?" 

Cassie’s voice crackled back. "Labs are a mess, Noah. Looks like they left in a hurry. Some of the equipment’s still running, but... there’s something off about it. It’s hard to explain, but I don’t think time’s moving right here." 

Dom chimed in next, his voice tense. "I’m checking the barracks. Same thing here—no sign of anyone. Feels like I’m walking through molasses. You good?" 

I wasn’t. But I didn’t say that. 

"Yeah," I lied. "Meet me back at the control room. We’ll figure out what to do next." 

When Dom and Cassie arrived, their faces mirrored my own confusion. Something was wrong with all of us, something we couldn’t quite name yet. Cassie’s eyes were wide, darting around the room like she was trying to see something that wasn’t there. Dom was quieter than usual, more on edge. 

"What the hell is happening here?" Dom asked, running a hand through his short-cropped hair. "Feels like we’re losing it." 

"It’s the bleed," Cassie said, her voice tight. "It’s worse than we thought. We’re already in it. I think it’s affecting us more the longer we stay." 

I didn’t want to believe it. I wanted to think there was some rational explanation for all of this, that we could find the missing team and get the hell out of here. But deep down, I knew Cassie was right. This wasn’t just some glitch in time or space. The bleed was real, and it was twisting us, pulling us apart piece by piece. 

"We need to find the others," I said, more to keep myself grounded than anything. "Whatever’s happening here, we need answers." 

Cassie nodded, but there was doubt in her eyes. "What if they’re already gone? What if the bleed—" 

"We’re not giving up yet," Dom interrupted, his voice firm. "We find the team, we get the data, and we leave. Simple as that." 

Nothing about this was simple, but I kept that to myself. We left the control room and ventured deeper into the facility, navigating the maze of halls and rooms that seemed to stretch on forever. Every door we opened led to more confusion—empty labs, abandoned equipment, eerie silence. 

And the voices. God, the voices were everywhere. Sometimes I heard Emily’s soft whisper, sometimes it was a cacophony of whispers that echoed through the halls, pulling at my sanity. I knew Dom and Cassie were hearing things too, but we didn’t talk about it. We couldn’t. 

It was when we reached the observation deck that things really went to hell. 

 

The observation deck overlooked the area where the team had been studying the bleed itself. A massive containment field surrounded the anomaly, flickering in and out like static on an old television. The air felt heavier here, like gravity was pushing down on us from all sides. 

And then I saw it. 

At first, it was just a shimmer in the air, like heat rising off asphalt in the summer. But as I stared, it grew, warping and twisting until it became something more. The air around it pulsed, distorting the space in strange, unnatural ways. 

Cassie gasped, stepping back. "Do you see that?" 

I did. But it wasn’t just the anomaly anymore. Beyond the flickering field, I saw something moving—something wrong. It was like looking at a broken reflection, a twisted version of reality. And in the center of it all, there were people—the missing team, or at least versions of them, trapped in the shifting space. 

But they weren’t moving. They were frozen, caught in some kind of temporal stasis, their faces contorted in silent screams. And then they began to flicker, like they were fading in and out of existence. 

"Noah," Dom said, his voice tight with fear. "We need to go. Now." 

But I couldn’t move. I was rooted to the spot, staring at the figures as they flickered between realities, between dimensions. It was as if the bleed was showing us a glimpse of what it could do—what it would do to us if we stayed too long. 

Cassie grabbed my arm, pulling me back to reality. "Noah! We have to go!" 

I blinked, tearing my eyes away from the horrific scene. My heart was pounding, my mind reeling. "We... we need to shut it down," I muttered. "Before it consumes everything." 

Dom shook his head. "We’re not shutting anything down. We’re getting out of here." 

But as we turned to leave, the air around us shifted, and I felt it again—that sickening pull, like the bleed was reaching out, wrapping its fingers around us. I heard Emily’s voice again, soft and pleading. 

"Noah... don’t leave me." 

And then the world twisted. 

Reality bent around me as if I had stepped into a reflection that didn’t quite match the original. The floor beneath my feet stretched and warped, the walls elongating like taffy in my peripheral vision. I could still hear Cassie and Dom shouting, but their voices seemed distant—muffled by something that wasn’t just the air. It was like the bleed itself had thickened between us. 

"Noah!" 

Dom’s voice came in sharp and clear, cutting through the disorientation. He grabbed me by the shoulders, his grip strong, shaking me hard enough to snap me out of the momentary daze. "Focus!" His eyes were wide, his usually calm demeanor cracking under the strain of whatever this place was doing to us. 

I took a deep breath, steadying myself as the world seemed to snap back into place, though the sensation of wrongness remained. We were still inside the bleed’s grasp, but at least I could tell where I was again. For now. 

"We’ve got to move," Dom said, his voice low, urgent. "We’re sitting ducks if we stay here. The bleed’s already playing with our heads." 

I nodded, feeling the dull ache behind my eyes intensify. "Where’s Cassie?" 

"She went to grab the portable stabilizer from the lab," Dom said, glancing over his shoulder as if expecting the room to shift again at any moment. "If we can at least slow this thing down, we might be able to—" 

A sudden scream cut through the air, sharp and gut-wrenching, echoing down the corridor. It was Cassie. 

Without thinking, Dom and I bolted toward the source, sprinting down the hall that now seemed twice as long, the walls flickering like a half-remembered dream. My heart pounded in my chest, adrenaline overriding the surreal disorientation that tried to pull me under. 

We rounded the corner and found Cassie in the lab. She stood in the center of the room, trembling, her eyes wide with terror, staring at something that wasn’t there. Or maybe it was there, but only to her. 

"Cassie!" I rushed to her side, my hands on her shoulders, shaking her gently. "What’s wrong? What did you see?" 

Her lips moved, but no sound came out at first. Then, slowly, her eyes met mine. "It’s… it’s in my head, Noah. I saw…" She trailed off, her voice cracking as tears welled up in her eyes. "It showed me something. A memory. But it wasn’t mine." 

I glanced at Dom, who looked as lost as I felt. "What do you mean, it wasn’t yours?" 

Cassie shuddered, wiping at her face, her breath coming in short, ragged gasps. "It was someone else’s life. A woman—her whole life, in flashes. Her first kiss, her wedding day, her child being born. But… then it got worse. She lost her child, her husband. There was so much pain, Noah. I felt it all. Like it was my own. But I’ve never had any of that." 

I swallowed hard, my throat dry. The bleed was pulling memories from somewhere—whether from people lost inside it or from alternate realities, it didn’t matter. It was invading us, digging deep into the most vulnerable parts of our minds, forcing us to live lives that weren’t ours. 

"We can’t stay here," I said, my voice hoarse. "It’s getting stronger." 

Dom nodded, his face pale. "We’ll grab the stabilizer and head back to the control room. If we can at least slow this thing down, maybe we’ll have time to figure out what the hell is going on." 

We didn’t talk much after that. It was like we all knew that words wouldn’t help—there was no logic, no reasoning with the bleed. It was alive, in a way that made it all the more terrifying. And it was hungry. 

Dom took the lead, his rifle slung over his shoulder, as we moved through the facility. I couldn’t shake the feeling that time had stopped meaning anything. My watch still ticked, but when I looked at it, I wasn’t sure if minutes had passed or hours. The hallways seemed to loop back on themselves, the same doors and rooms repeating endlessly, like we were trapped in a nightmare with no exit. 

And then there were the flashes. 

They came suddenly, without warning. One moment, we were walking down a corridor, and the next, I was somewhere else—somewhen else. I’d blink and find myself standing in a house I didn’t recognize, watching a woman I’d never met cry at her kitchen table. I could hear her sobs, feel the crushing weight of grief that surrounded her. Then I’d blink again, and I was back in the facility, with Dom and Cassie, my heart pounding in my chest. 

Dom was having them too—I could tell by the way his eyes kept darting to the corners of the room, like he was seeing something just out of sight. Cassie clutched the stabilizer to her chest, her knuckles white, her breath coming in shallow gasps. 

The bleed wasn’t just distorting space anymore. It was playing with time, pulling us into moments that weren’t ours, forcing us to experience them like echoes of lives we didn’t live. 

"We’re close," Dom muttered, his voice strained. "Just ahead." 

But the moment we stepped into the next room, everything shifted again. 

The world around me dissolved into a chaotic swirl of colors and sounds. I felt like I was falling, tumbling through an endless aetheric void where nothing made sense. It was as though the very fabric of reality had torn open, and we were caught in the gap between. 

When the world snapped back into focus, I wasn’t in the facility anymore. 

I stood on a street corner in a city I didn’t recognize, surrounded by people I’d never seen before. Cars zoomed by, their horns blaring, and the smell of street food filled the air. The sun was setting, casting long shadows across the pavement. 

But something was wrong. 

The people… they weren’t moving. They stood frozen in place, mid-stride, their faces locked in expressions of joy, anger, confusion. It was like someone had hit pause on the world. 

And then I heard her voice again. 

Emily. 

She stood across the street, her back to me, just as I remembered her—before the accident. Before everything went wrong. My heart clenched in my chest as I took a step toward her, my throat tight with a mix of hope and dread. 

"Emily!" I called out, my voice barely more than a whisper. "Emily, wait!" 

But she didn’t turn. She didn’t move at all. 

I broke into a run, weaving through the frozen figures around me, my mind screaming that this wasn’t real, that it couldn’t be real. But my heart wouldn’t listen. I had to reach her. I had to— 

And then I was yanked back. 

The world twisted, snapping me out of the illusion and throwing me back into the cold, sterile facility. I stumbled, gasping for breath, as Dom’s hand gripped my arm. 

"Noah!" he shouted, his voice urgent. "Stay with us, man! It’s not real!" 

I blinked, disoriented, my heart still racing from the encounter. Emily was gone. Of course she was. She’d been gone for years. But the bleed… it was using her, using my memories, my emotions, to keep me hooked. 

"We have to shut this thing down," I muttered, shaking off the lingering haze. "Before it takes any more of us." 

Dom nodded, his jaw clenched tight. "We’re almost there." 

When we reached the core of the facility, it was clear we were at the heart of the bleed. The room pulsed with energy, the walls shifting in and out of focus, as if they couldn’t decide what they were supposed to be. In the center of the room was the source—the anomaly we’d seen on the observation deck, now expanded, growing like a living thing. 

And inside it, I could see something. An entity, vast and incomprehensible, its form constantly shifting, never quite solid. It wasn’t like anything I’d ever seen before—like the bleed itself had given birth to something that shouldn’t exist. 

Cassie set the stabilizer down, her hands shaking as she worked to activate it. "This should at least stop it from spreading," she said, her voice unsteady. "But we need to figure out how to shut it down completely." 

I stared at the entity, my mind struggling to comprehend what I was seeing. It was like looking into the void, into something that didn’t belong in our world. It felt ancient, powerful, like it had been waiting for us to find it. 

"We can’t shut it down," I said, my voice barely above a whisper. "Not really. It’s not just a thing. It’s… it’s alive." 

Dom frowned, stepping closer. "What do you mean, alive?" 

I shook my head, trying to make sense of the thoughts swirling in my mind. "The bleed—it’s not just an anomaly. It’s part of something bigger. Something we can’t understand. And now that we’ve found it… it’s not going to let us go." 

The realization hit me like a cold wave, sharp and numbing. The bleed wasn’t just a phenomenon—it was part of something far greater, and by interacting with it, we had become entangled in its grasp. The more we tried to understand, the deeper we sank into its folds, feeding it with our curiosity, our fear, and our memories. 

Cassie’s hands were still trembling as she worked, her fingers clumsy over the stabilizer’s controls. "We don’t have much time," she muttered, barely audible over the hum of the entity at the room’s center. "This thing’s destabilizing faster than we thought. If we don’t activate this now, it’s going to consume the whole facility." 

The entity inside the anomaly twisted and shimmered, like a ripple on the surface of a bottomless ocean. It felt as though it were watching us, though it had no eyes. It simply existed, an unfathomable intelligence that had grown from the dimensional bleed. 

Dom stepped up beside me, his face pale but determined. "If we can’t shut it down, we can at least contain it. We have to stop this thing from spreading any further. Whatever it is—it’s feeding on us." 

I nodded, my thoughts racing. He was right. The more we struggled, the more the bleed seemed to adapt, warping our perception, forcing us to relive moments we couldn’t control. It wasn’t just a distortion of time and space—it was learning from us, growing stronger as it absorbed our memories, our emotions. 

But something tugged at the edges of my mind, a thought that had been gnawing at me since we first encountered the anomaly. I couldn’t shake the feeling that this was a cycle. It had happened before—and it would happen again. 

"We’re not the first," I said, my voice hoarse as the realization crystallized. "This has happened before. People have come here, explored the bleed, tried to understand it—and it consumed them. It’s… part of the pattern." 

Dom glanced at me, his brow furrowing. "What are you saying?" 

"I’m saying the bleed—it doesn’t just distort reality. It creates it. Or at least, it creates a version of it. Every time someone tries to explore it, they leave a part of themselves behind, and the bleed takes it, merges it with itself. That’s why we’re seeing all these memories, these lives that aren’t ours. We’re walking through the remains of everyone who’s come before us." 

Dom’s expression darkened as he took in my words. "So, what? There’s no way out?" 

Cassie looked up from the stabilizer, her face tight with fear. "We have to try. If we can at least stop it from growing—" 

The room shuddered, a deep, resonant pulse that rattled the walls. The entity inside the anomaly expanded, its form stretching, reaching toward us like the tendrils of some vast, incomprehensible mind. The lights flickered, and for a moment, I thought I could hear a low, thrumming hum—a voice that wasn’t a voice, reverberating in the air around us. 

It knew we were here. 

Cassie managed to activate the stabilizer just as the entity seemed to surge forward, its presence pressing down on us like a weight, thick and suffocating. The machine hummed to life, casting a blue glow that rippled through the room. For a moment, the walls stopped shifting, the distortions in time and space slowing. 

"We’ve bought ourselves some time," she said, wiping sweat from her brow. "But it’s not enough. The bleed’s still too powerful. We need a way to sever it completely." 

Dom stepped closer to the anomaly, his eyes narrowing as he studied the entity. "There’s got to be a way to collapse it. Something that’ll cut the connection between this world and… whatever that thing is." 

I stared at the anomaly, my mind racing. If the bleed was tied to this larger, unknowable entity, then maybe the only way to stop it was to break that connection. But how? It was like trying to cut the strings of a puppet without being able to see the strings. 

And then it hit me. 

"The memories," I said suddenly, my voice rising as the pieces fell into place. "It’s using our memories, our emotions, to hold itself together. Every time it takes a piece of us, it strengthens the connection. But if we stop feeding it—if we break the cycle—maybe we can collapse the bleed." 

Dom’s eyes flicked to me, a flicker of understanding dawning. "You mean we have to let go." 

"Exactly. We’ve been fighting it this whole time, trying to hold onto who we are, but that’s what’s keeping us trapped. The bleed isn’t just distorting reality—it’s creating a new one, based on everything we’re bringing into it. If we let go of those memories, if we sever our emotional connection to them, maybe we can stop it from expanding." 

Cassie’s face twisted in confusion. "But how? How do we just… let go?" 

"I don’t know," I admitted, the enormity of what I was saying settling over me like a weight. "But it’s the only way. If we don’t, we’ll just keep feeding it until it takes us completely." 

Dom stared at the anomaly, his jaw tight. "Then we do it. We find a way." 

It wasn’t as easy as flipping a switch. Memories don’t just fade because you will them to. They’re part of you, woven into the very fabric of your identity. But in that moment, standing on the edge of an abyss I couldn’t fully comprehend, I realized I had no other choice. 

I had to let go of Emily. 

The thought tore at me, a physical pain in my chest, but I knew it was the only way. I had carried her with me for so long—her memory, her death, the guilt that had haunted me every day since. It had shaped who I was, driven me to make choices that had led me here, to this moment. But now, it was also the thing keeping me trapped in this place, in the bleed. 

I closed my eyes, breathing deeply, trying to center myself. The entity inside the anomaly pulsed, as if sensing what I was about to do. It wasn’t going to make this easy. 

"I’m sorry," I whispered, the words catching in my throat. "But I have to let you go." 

And then, like a dam breaking, the memories came flooding back—every moment I had spent with her, every laugh, every tear, every fight. The good and the bad, all of it crashing over me like a tidal wave. But I didn’t push it away. I let it come, let it wash over me, let it tear me apart. And slowly, painfully, I let it go. 

The pressure in the room shifted, the air growing heavy with the weight of the entity’s presence. I opened my eyes and saw that Dom and Cassie were doing the same—reliving their own memories, their own losses, their own fears. And as they let go, the entity began to shrink, its tendrils recoiling, its form flickering. 

It wasn’t enough to destroy it completely. But it was enough to weaken it. 

The anomaly pulsed one last time, a final burst of energy that shook the room. The walls shimmered, the floor beneath us rippling like water. And then, with a sudden, jarring snap, the bleed collapsed in on itself, the entity vanishing into the void from which it had come. 

We were thrown to the floor as the stabilizer overloaded, sparks flying from the machine as it short-circuited. The lights flickered, and for a moment, I thought the whole facility was going to come down around us. 

But then, silence. 

I blinked, dazed, as I pulled myself to my feet. The room was still, the walls solid once more. The bleed was gone. 

Dom groaned as he stood, clutching his side. "Is it over?" 

Cassie nodded, her face pale but relieved. "It’s over." 

I looked around, still half-expecting the walls to start shifting again, but they didn’t. The air was heavy with the smell of burnt circuits, but it was real. Solid. We had made it. 

But as we stumbled out of the room, exhausted and battered, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we hadn’t won. Not really. 

The bleed was gone, but the entity was still out there, somewhere. And it would wait. It always did. 

\*\*\* 

Weeks later, I sat at my desk, staring at the report I had been writing, trying to make sense of everything that had happened. The facility was in lockdown, the OOC sweeping it under the rug, as they always did. The official story was a containment breach. Nothing more. Nothing the public needed to know about.  

But I knew the truth. It’s why I feel compelled to write and distribute this to you the reader out there who might stumble upon it.   

I had survived the bleed, but it had left its mark on me. The memories I had let go of were gone, but the scars remained. And somewhere, out there in the vast unknown, the entity waited, biding its time. It was not a Sword of Damocles hanging over me, it is our entire species at risk.  

The entity was like a virus, infecting us, hoping to spread itself further. Why I cannot comprehend, perhaps no human can. I wonder then, deep down, what things might have been like if we were all clear headed, not weighed down by the struggles of existence? Would the bleed instead reflect back to us something positive? 

I shake my head. I had no doubt it would return, more bleed sites always appeared. We hadn’t destroyed it. We had only delayed the inevitable. 

But I also knew that when it did return, we wouldn’t be ready. 

We never are because of what we cling onto.
