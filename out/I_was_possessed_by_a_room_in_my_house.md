Growing up, my family’s house had a room that we didn’t use as much as all the other rooms.  Days on end it would sit empty and none of us paid it any notice.  Even during parties, guests avoided the room as if “off limits,” even if it never really was.  When my family moved out did I realize how little that room was used and I promised myself that I would never have a room like that.



I didn’t know how easy it was to forget a room.



This year, I decided enough was enough.  It had been easy to let certain rooms sit unused when it was just me and my dog, Camila, living in the house.  It was time to use my rooms for the functions I had set them up for.  The main culprit was the center room with my drum kit; my music room.  I made a plan to practice drums regularly and put it all on my whiteboard:  Mondays and Wednesdays were now my drumming days.  Resolution made, I went through and gave the house a thorough cleaning.  Two full days of scrubbing, spraying, and sweeping.  



The first day, Camila ignored me, preferring to lay on the guest bed which she’s taken as her own.  On the second day of cleaning, she started following me.  I had just finished up with a second round of cleaning in the music room and as I stepped out, Camila jumped off the guest bed and walked behind me.  While never closer than three steps away, she made sure I was always in sight.  I barely noticed since I was so involved in my cleaning; I only realized her reaction a couple of days later.



Because she never stopped following me.



This was especially true on Mondays and Wednesdays after spending a good amount of time in the music room.  I’d walk out and find Camila waiting to follow me through the rest of the day and into the evening; even sleeping within eyesight of my bed at night.  During our walks she would stay extra close to me avoiding the plants and lawns that she normally sniffed.  



Despite Camila’s misgivings, I found myself getting into the routine of drumming and enjoying all of my house for the first time.  It felt truly lived in.  I had a reason to keep it cleaner than before; much like the narrator in Fight Club finding reasons to trim his nails and cut his hair during the week to prepare for the club, I took better care of the house.  



But the room I focused on cleaning the most was the Music Room.



I spent twice as much time there than I did in any other room despite it being one of the smaller rooms of the house.  I refreshed my rags after dusting every other shelf, vacuumed twice, took a toothbrush for detail work, and all the while I could hear Camila at the entry to the room whining.  I brushed this off as just Camila getting jealous that I wasn’t spending all my time with her and rewrote my schedule on the board to have the weekend be lots of dog time.  While she definitely enjoyed the extra time, it didn’t really change anything when I entered the Music Room.  



Eventually, I found myself in the Music Room on days that weren’t Monday and Wednesday.  Sometimes, I realized what room I was in after staring blankly at the window and with no knowledge of what I had been doing those few minutes (hours?) before.  Folks at work started asking me if I was getting enough rest.  “I think so, why?” “Your eyes are getting darker … did you get in a fight?  Are those black eyes?” “No.”  



Sometimes, when walking by the Music Room with a book in my hand to sit in my chair in the front room,  I would feel a pull to the Music Room as I walked by; a pull strong enough that I walked along the side opposite the door.  I can vividly recall at least once when I sat down in the front room breathing heavily from the exertion of avoiding the Music Room.  Camila noticed.  She started walking between me and the Music Room when she saw me with the book in hand.  On Mondays and Wednesdays, though, Camila would just follow at a distance and whine as I went to “practice.”



For the first few weeks, I practiced drums whenever I went in intentionally, but soon I just entered the room and sat in the center of it.  Camila would give a sharp bark and I would shake my head - dusting off thoughts and dreams or nightmares - to realize where I was.  Coworkers continued to notice something off with my appearance.  Tuesdays and Thursdays I’d show up at work to a volley of “did you sleep ok?” “are you sick?” “do you need to go home?” and looking in the mirror I could understand their concern.  Dark circles had grown around my eyes and my face was slightly more gaunt.  Even with their concern and seeing the change in my face I carried on.  



Until I noticed a strange bruise on my body.



It was a Thursday morning and I woke up feeling relatively rested.  Per usual I made some coffee and sat down, but felt a small pang around the center of my chest.  While weird I didn’t give it too much thought until I was in the bathroom and saw a bruise in the shape of a giant foot across my chest.  Pressing along the edges, I could feel the strange pain of pressing on a bruise, but wondered how this didn’t disrupt my sleep the night before.  I thought back over the last 24 hours and could think of nothing that would have resulted in any bruise, let alone one in the shape of a foot.  



I took the day off of work and walked Camila around a nearby park.  I hoped the air and shade might jog some memory, but was left with a blank.  



The next day, the bruise was a little darker and that’s when I called my brother for help.



He agreed to come over for the week and make sure I wasn’t doing anything too crazy; coming over on Sunday and staying until Saturday.  I just had to make it through Saturday and then I’d have a second person to help me figure out what was going on.  Much like two days before, I spent most of this one outside with Camila.  The sun - usually too much for me - acted as a balm.  Even hung around in my backyard letting a slow tan disguise the weird bruise on my chest. 



On Sunday, the first thing my brother did was a quick inspection of the house.  I waited in the living room while he went from room to room, spending a little more time in the Music Room than the others.  Finally, he came out and said, “I don’t know what you’re on about.”  By this time I had shown him the bruise and his response was, “Dude, you always forget things.  Or … are you trying out some new kink?”  Then he winked.  It was enough to break the tension and we hung out the rest of the day.  While getting ready for bed, I felt optimistic.  There had been no pull to the Music Room, I wasn’t shocked into awareness by my brother or my dog; the afternoon felt normal.  I wish I could say the same thing about that night. 



Before I describe the events of that night, I need to explain something.  While the schedule wasn’t too much of a bother for my brother, the situation required a large emotional sacrifice.  This is the fellow who, after watching *Paranormal Activity* with me, called me at midnight to ask if he could stay the night; when asked where he was, he said “in your driveway.”  He mainly faces fears from the safety of a screen (and even then those fears would keep him awake).  Coming into my house where there was something weird happening had him on edge from the beginning, but his love for me made this danger worth the risk. 



My brother and I rigged up a tiny noise trap so he would wake if I went into the Music Room that night.  He was staying in the front room (right by the Music Room), so we didn’t need to make the trap too noisy.  The main goal this evening was to watch and see if anything was happening, but not to stop it.  Only later when we knew a little more about what I was doing would we have enough information to safely stop whatever was happening.  Besides, if anything too dangerous was happening, barks from Camila had snapped me to consciousness during the day earlier, something similar should work in the evening.  That was the thought in any case.

I woke up the next morning and the silence made me feel uneasy.  I glanced at my phone and saw a host of missed calls and twice as many texts, all from my brother.  I called his name.  No reply.  I stumbled to the guest room with my phone in my hand.  



He wasn’t there.  



I started looking through my phone and found that each text was a picture, and he had finally left one voice mail after about multiple missed calls.  He was breathless in that message, barely louder than the screaming wheels of his car as he drove away.  “I tried to wake you up,” it started … but first I looked at the pictures.  



The fact that he got so many pictures so quickly before running out of the house (and truly, I would have run too had I seen what he saw) is testament to his love for me.  The quality of the pictures he took also are a testament to either how frozen with fear he was, or how brave he was that evening.  Either way, I owe him my life and I’ve said as much to him multiple times since then.  



Each picture was taken from the doorway of the Music Room looking in.  The first 4 are all perfectly centered.  Each successive picture is slightly more off-center than the next and the video was as shaky as *Blair Witch Project*.  The room is dark with some light reflecting off of the edges of the drum kit from the phone’s flash.  The only light is coming in from the window and is a mix of moonlight and my neighbor’s outdoor light.  While eerie, the first picture could be seen as normal or serene in other circumstances.  The rest … 



1.  I am seated cross-legged in the center of the room and staring out the window.



1. I am still cross-legged in the center of the room, but I’m now floating above the floor and staring out the window.



1. Cross-legged, with my back parallel to the floor (that I’m now easily a foot above) and my legs parallel to the window I had been staring at.



1. Continuing the motion implied in the previous pictures, I’m still cross-legged, but now upside down.  



1. Then cross-legged with back parallel to ceiling, 6. then as if staring out the window, 7. then back parallel to the floor, and 8. so 9. on. 10.  



Pictures 11 through 15 were blurry and seemed to be taken in rapid succession, but I couldn’t make out any clear details.  However, there was a video that - shaky as it was - implied a lot about those earlier pictures.



The video starts with me floating in a pose like DeVinci’s “Vetruvian Man” facing the window.  There is a little movement at the start, as if I had just gotten into this pose, then my body starts spinning in multiple directions at once like the gyroscopic training devices astronauts use.  In the background, my brother screams my name with Camila barking wildly.



I listened to his voicemail message.  After a couple of false starts (and then the screech of brakes), he took a deep breath and explained what he saw:



“I heard you.  Not the trap, just your feet clomp clomp clomp …” another deep breath.  “I rolled out of the bed and saw you walk into the Music Room.  Grabbed my phone.  Saw you sitting there.  Weird, but snapped a picture anyway.  Heard something, weird drone sound? I don’t know.  You started floating.  I almost ran, but took more photos instead.  You started spinning faster and faster and I was getting nervous so tried to call your name out.  You didn’t wake.  I called you and you didn’t wake.  Camila barked and you didn’t wake and the noise got louder than just stopped.” another deep breath.  “I started the video and … I couldn’t stay as soon as I saw those eyes staring at me.  I yelled your name once more and then ran.  Camila ran too, but she went to the side of the bed.  She refused to come with me.  I hope she’s ok.  But I knew I wouldn’t be if I stayed.  I made it to the front door and heard a bang.  I … I  … I … I’m sorry.  I tried.”  



I called him that day and told him he shouldn’t apologize, that what he did was brave and full of love.  I promised him to find a pet friendly hotel (after confirming that Camila was indeed, ok, just incredibly nervous).   I asked about the eyes he saw but he refused to go into any more detail.  I wish that was the last I knew about those eyes.



As promised, Camila and I left the house for a full week.  Given the lack of complaints from management, I’m guessing that there were no episodes there.  Eventually I was going to need to be back at the house for something and I couldn’t keep renting the room.  My brother made me promise to keep the door to the Music Room closed and as soon as I walked back into my house that’s exactly what I did.  I looked at the schedule on the white board that had started this whole adventure off and erased it.



After a couple of weeks, where I kept the Music Room closed (and there were no signs that it had opened nor was Camila anywhere near as nervous as before), I started to feel a little more secure.  I opened the door to the Music Room with Camila at my feet.  She didn’t whimper.  The air was just a little stale from lack of circulation.  I figured this was a good time to empty the room.  Every other day, I would go in for no more than 5 minutes to remove an item or two, which I then put in storage.  It took a couple of weeks to fully remove (and sell) the things, but eventually I emptied the room.  



That day I felt triumphant.  I looked at Camila, smiled, opened the window a little bit so there wouldn’t be that stale air left in the room then closed the door.  “And that is that!”  Camila tilted her head in that dog response of “ok, he’s talking to me” then jumped on the guest bed. 



After another couple of weeks, I began to feel almost jovial for the first time all year.  Last week, though, I woke up to a text on my phone from an unknown number and an open door to the Music Room.



The text had two pictures.  In the first, I’m standing in the middle of the now empty Music Room with my feet above the carpet and I’m in the process of twisting - like I was trying to crack my back.  My eyes are wide open.  The second picture shows my body fully twisted farther than I could ever do in my conscious life as if trying to crack every bone in my body.  And a second set of eyes on my face.



I’m moving soon.  It’s just a matter of emptying the rest of the house.
