 

I showed up to the house half an hour early, but they were already there.  It was an Air BnB they’d had me rent for the night—told me which one to pick because they were familiar and it met their specific criteria.

 

When I asked what the criteria were, they told me without hesitation.

 

No houses within sightline of this house or it’s driveway.  No external or internal cameras.  And no rivers or creeks anywhere on the property.

 

I wanted to ask follow-up questions, especially about the water, but they had already moved on in our online chat session.  They were polite the whole time, but in a professional, almost distracted way that made it seem like they had to squeeze me in between appointments that were much more important.  Part of me wanted to balk at that—I was being asked to pay $5,000 after all—but I knew better.  I was either paying for a scam or a miracle, and either way I was desperate enough to try.

 

\*\*\*\*

 

“Welcome, welcome.  Kim?  I will call you Kim if that is all right.  I feel like I know you well already.”  The chubby blonde woman was walking and smiling and waving as she beckoned me deeper into the rental house.  I could hear an accent, maybe Norwegian, in her friendly voice, and every word was said with hard precision, like granite being warmed by soft hands.  Moving into the living room, she sat down on the sofa and pointed for me to do the same.

 

Once we were settled, I quickly found myself unnerved by having to sit so close to her.  Her eyes were big and pale and rarely blinked, and her lips made a light smacking sound when she spoke.  She was speaking again just then, asking a question I missed.

 

“I’m sorry, what?”

 

“I asked if you are ready to begin.”

 

I blinked.  I didn’t know what I’d expected, but this was all happening so fast.  Between what Paula had told me and the questions I asked over chat, I felt like I had a decent idea of what was going to happen, but in my growing panic I decided to go back over the major points to buy some time for my spine to come back.

 

“So this…procedure.  It won’t hurt?”

 

The woman’s eyes widened as she gave a little laugh.  “Hurt you?  Goodness no.”  She gave a thoughtful shrug as she continued.  “Well, the telling of everything can be very hard, but after this last time, it’ll be done.  That’s the whole point, right?”

 

Frowning, I nodded.  “And you are really saying that after this is over, I won’t be depressed anymore?  I won’t want to…um, hurt myself or anything?  Like permanently?”

 

She nodded.  “When it is finished, the pain that has weighed you down for so long will be gone for good.”

 

“And I won’t turn into like an emotionless robot or something?”

 

The woman grinned at me.  “You kids and your silly movie ideas.  No, nothing like that.  You can still be sad and be hurt, but only by new things, not the past.  You keep the memories but not the pain.  And when you do feel new pain, it won’t be so sharp and terrible.  It’ll be something you can, well, live with.”  She reached out and patted my hand.  “Doesn’t that sound good?”

 

Despite my anxiety, I found myself smiling at her.  “It does.  It really fucking does.”

 

Her smile widened.  “Good.”  Reaching into her bag she pulled out a long wooden box.  Inside was a glass eyedropper with a small black bulb on the end.  She examined it for a moment before looking back at me.  “Then it is time for you to start.  Tell me everything that hurts you.  That makes you want to die.  Don’t stop when the tears come, and they will come.  Keep going until I tell you it is done.”

 

\*\*\*\*

 

I spent the next hour pulling out every bad thing from the shadowed corners of my heart.  The death, the loneliness.  The guilt and fear.  Everything that was wrong with me, everything I’d tried and failed.  Everything I’d lost or would never have.  By the end of it I was sweating and sobbing and barely able to breathe.  The words were still flowing, but I could feel them beginning to slow, and it was at that moment that the woman grabbed my chin.

 

Tilting my head back slightly, she edged the eyedropper up to my cheek to catch my tears.   She moved with a practiced hand, and within a couple of minutes the dropper was most of the way full.  Releasing me, she plucked a small cap from the box and put it on the end of the eyedropper before stowing the dropper back inside.  Closing the box, she studied me with a serious eye for several moments before asking her next question.

 

“How do you feel?”

 

I sucked in a breath at the question.  How *did* I feel?  Any different?  And if so, was it just some placebo…no.  Oh God.  I started crying again.

 

“It…It’s gone.  It’s all gone.  I…oh God, I don’t know how but…yeah, yeah.  I-I feel great.  So much better.”  I kept wiping my tears as I started laughing, and the woman sat patiently until I got myself under control.  When I could speak again, I looked up at her questioningly.

 

“How?   How is it possible this really works?  Is it a trick?”

 

She shook her head.  “No trick.”

 

I swallowed and nodded, my heart even lighter now.  “Is it magic?”

 

The woman chuckled at that.  “Depending on who you ask, most anything can seem like magic.  The important thing is how you feel.  Do you like how you feel now?”

 

I nodded.  “Oh yes.  I don’t remember ever feeling so…so light.  It’s not even about being happy, though I am happy.  I just feel light and free.”

 

She raised an eyebrow, smiling.  “And not like a robot or a zombie?  Still have your memories?”

 

Letting out a slow, nervous breath, I forced myself to remember.  First small surface things, and then bigger, heavier things that had been eating away at me for years.  I felt my eyes widen as I stared at her.  “No, it’s all there.  And some of it still makes me a little sad or angry or whatever, but not a lot.  It seems more remote.  Safer.”  I laughed.  “Like it happened to me in a past life.”

 

She echoed my laughter.  “That’s not far from the truth.  You’re on a new path now, or you can be.  Do you want to keep yourself this way?”

 

I frowned at her.  “Of course.  And I’ll pay you the money.  More if you need me to.  I just need to stay like this.”

 

Shaking her head, she picked up the box.  “No, nothing like that.  A deal’s a deal, and money isn’t very important.”  She handed it to me.  “But the last step is.  You have to feed your sorrow to another within the next five days.”

 

I felt myself jerk as though I’d been struck.  “What?  What do you mean?”

 

She shrugged.  “Just what I said.  This pain has to go somewhere or it will find its way back to you.  Your tears need to be ingested by another and given time to take root there.  It is your job to find that person and give them your tears.”

 

I stared at her.  “What?  No.  I mean, what does that do to them?  Make them feel the way I did?  That’s impossible.”

 

The woman’s smile faded as she leaned back slightly, her eyes cool as she regarded me.

 

“Do you know how you tried to tell people how sad and depressed you were?  How you wanted to kill yourself?  Had almost tried twice before?”

 

I shook my head.  “I didn’t.  I didn’t tell anyone.”

 

A thin smile returned to her lips as she held up her arm to show me her deeply scarred wrist.  “Neither did I.  My parents, my best friend, my boyfriend.  I'd have told them almost anything else, but not that.  Why?"

 

I shrugged.  “Because you didn’t want them to worry.”

 

Her laugh was harsher this time.  “No, that’s a lie.  It was because we *do* try to tell people.  Maybe not with a big confession or conversation, but we test the waters in what we say and how we act around them.  And we see their surface-level concern.  Their love for us, so long as it’s convenient.  But beneath that, there’s resentment that we are disrupting what they want to do or think about.  And more than that, there’s almost a fear.  Even when they ask if everything’s okay, I could tell they just wanted me to say yes.  As though, deep down, they’re afraid it’s catching.”

 

The woman’s smile broadened.  “Because it is.  Not highly contagious, but able to be passed along.  As you must do now.”

 

“But I don’t want to hurt anyone.”

 

The woman waved away my sentiment.  “It’s not a question of hurt.  Someone, whether they meant to or not, gave this to you at some point.  This…extra burden.  It cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be moved.”  Folding her hands on one knee, she gave a short sniff.  “That can be because you kill yourself, of course.  It will move on then to someone else, someone you *don’t* choose.  Or *you* can actually be in control of your life for once and decide who to burden with this thing.  If you choose well, you’ll find someone that can carry the burden better than you ever could.”

 

Standing up, I started pacing back and forth, cradling the box in my arms like an infant.  “So…I can pick anyone?”

 

Another chuckle.  “Let me save you some time.  It has to be a human.  They have to be alive.  They can’t be on death’s door, either.  This thing I took from you isn’t stupid.  And it won’t waste time building a new nest in a soon-to-be corpse.  It’d rather spend that energy crawling back to you.”

 

I gave a shudder.  “Oh God.  Um…who then?  A bad person?”

 

She shrugged.  “That’s one way to go, though you don’t know what that sudden influx of negative emotions will do to someone that already has destructive tendencies.  They may take it out on other people.”

 

I was growing stressed and upset, but it had an entirely different quality than I’d ever felt before.  I could see the problems clearly, and I cared about finding a solution I was comfortable with, but I wasn’t spiraling down the throat of some anxious depression, hating myself for not having an answer or for trying this in the first place.  After pacing a few more seconds, I looked back to her.

 

“So who do you suggest?”

 

The woman’s face grew more serious.  “Honestly, I’d consider a child.  A baby would be even better.  They are far more resilient and their memories are more pliable.  Chances are it would just get absorbed into their personality and never affect them that much.  Or if not, they may be better equipped to handle it than you were.  It doesn’t affect everyone the same.”

 

I felt my skin beginning to prickle.  “Did you know I worked in the neonatal unit at my hospital?”

 

Her eyebrows drew together as she shook her head slowly.  “No, you never told me where you worked.  But there you are.  A simple solution.”

 

Letting out a small gasp, I put the box back on the coffee table in front of the woman.  “No.  You do it.  I’m paying you a lot of money…and um, I need you to do it.”

 

Standing up, she smoothed her blouse as she spoke to me.  “It isn’t for me to do.  It’s your job to finish, or to not.”

 

Scowling, I picked up the box and thrust it at her.  “I won’t pay if you don’t do this part too.”

 

She cackled and started walking toward the front hallway.  “I don’t care about the money.  That’s just to weed out…how you say…tourists and make people feel they’re getting something of value.  Keep the money.”  I had followed her out to the front door, and as she opened it, she turned around, her eyes darker and colder than before.  “Keep the tears too, if you wish.  Drink them yourself or wait for the thing in them to come back on its own.  Until it is fully nested elsewhere, it can find you wherever you go.”  She turned to leave but then hesitated, and when she turned back, her expression was a bit more kind.  “But think about how you feel now.  Don’t you deserve the chance to really live? Or is the happiness of strangers worth more than your own?”  She reached out and gave my wrist a squeeze.  “Take it from me, it’s not.”

 

And with that, she was gone.

 

\*\*\*\*

 

Pain and sadness changes who you are.  Guilt and fear will twist you to the point that you hate yourself because you don’t recognize what you’ve become.  Didn’t you used to be better than this?  More than this?  Or is this broken, bitter thing what you were always meant to be?

 

Being free of that, feeling like myself again, actually being happy?  I thought it might make me softer and kinder.  More forgiving.  And maybe in some ways it has.  I definitely feel for people that are going through hard times, and I try to help them when I can.  That’s a big part of why I became a doctor, after all.

 

But having this thing taken from me has also given me a lot of clarity.  About who I am.  And what I’m willing to do to protect myself.

 

\*\*\*\*

 

“Hey Doc.  Aren’t you supposed to be headed home already?”

 

I looked up as I closed the door.  One of the younger nurses,  Ryan…something.  He was a nice guy, if a bit too talkative.  “Yeah, I’m about to.”  I hooked a thumb back at the room I’d just come from.  “Just wanted to look in on some of the babies before I went.  See how life is treating them.”

 

Ryan grinned at me.  “They’re babies.  Everybody thinks they’re cute and they get held and fed round the clock.  I’d say life is treating them pretty good so far.”

 

I was silent for a moment before forcing a smile.  “Yeah, maybe so.  Still, pay extra attention to the one in the back.  The Reynolds kid?  Maybe it’s just a fluke, but he’s in there crying up a storm.”

 

The nurse raised his eyebrows.  “Really?  He’s usually super chill.  I’ll go check on him now.”  Moving past me to the door, he gave me a parting glance.  “Um, have a good weekend.”

 

I grinned at him.  “Oh yeah.  [I will](https://www.reddit.com/r/Verastahl/).”
