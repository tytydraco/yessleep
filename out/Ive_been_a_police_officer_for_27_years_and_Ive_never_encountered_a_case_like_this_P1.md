December 16, 2013. I get a call to a neighborhood not 5 minutes away from the station about a body found on a lonely sewer ditch. I still remember the cold, thick air. It wasn’t a pleasant cold, more like the type of cold to gnaw at your nose and lungs on every incredibly sharp inhale you take. Texas cold will do that to you, but this? Something was just different, and it wasn’t just the air

I pull up in the squad car and see a woman crying hysterically on her knees close to the crime scene. The body was laying face up. Or should I say, body up. The face was blown to bits, presumably by a gun, maybe a 9mm. And then, I see it. A hand pistol was entrenched in blood not too far from the body, my left.


The paramedics arrived and deemed her dead. All we had to do was draw the chalk and find out the crime. But, the the scene depicted what it was more logically, a teen suicide. It made sense, since her mother claimed she was harassed, beaten up, and hated by all her mates at school, and was beaten as a child by her drunken father. 

We did a double check, and her inbox was flooded with hate emails and death threats, tempting her to commit suicide, as well as names and descriptions and eyewitness accounts of her being abused at school, as well. I was enraged that children could be so cruel to an innocent bystander who did nothing but make a way for herself. But the facts were right there. So, the bullies were prosecuted, memorials were held by those who loved her, and a seminar was held at the school.

How could I have been so… blind? I dismissed it as a horrible tragedy, but I did not put what was staring me in the face together, and that caused an innocent to go without justice. This was not just a case of cruelty among children, but of vile deception and villainy at its peak.

The mother thanked me, and gave me a letter of gratitude as a token of appreciation. She also… let me look at the suicide note. I noticed a mark on the side of it, and asked about it. She said she was left handed. She asked me to keep it, because she could not bear the pain that came with it in her possession. I reluctantly agreed.

So eight years go by, and I have the letter from that mother framed at my desk. it was a symbol of who I always wanted to be and who I would continue to be. But I walked past it today. And as I looked at it with curiosity, I read the lines of gratitude and it made me nearly tear up.

But something was… wrong. I looked closely at the letter, and something seemed strangely familiar. I could have dismissed it how I did everything else, but not this time. This time, I was dead set on finding out. 

And that’s when I made the terrifying connection. I quickly dug through my old stuff box and found the suicide note from the girl. I did a side by side comparison and what I discovered shocked me to my core. The handwriting of the note and the appreciation letter… were written by the same hands.

Every minute detail was similar, down to the curve on the t’s to the strange curve on the o’s. My legs grew weak and my body trembled as I realized the horrible truth. It all clicked together now. 

But then, I noticed the mark that the Mother had mentioned. It was on the left hand side. But then I remembered that I saw the gun to my left. If she killed herself with a gun and she fell down then the recoil would cause the gun to fall to her left, or my right. Logically, the gun couldn’t have been where it was that night. 

But one piece of evidence remained. A piece of evidence I thought not crucial to the investigation seeing as we had already determined a probable cause for death. Her mother was detained in a mental hospital for quite some time.

But then I relook at the note. Some of the letters have a weird loop inside of them. I frantically wrote down all of said letters on a notebook and this is the message I found: 

IF U FIND THIS, YOU ALREADY FAILED.

I can’t sleep. I can’t eat. I let a murderer go loose, but I will not let her go loose for longer. I will stop her, and I will right the wrong I have made.
