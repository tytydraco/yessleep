When the clock struck 7 the next day, I was already sitting in my car and started the vehicle immediately to get to the location.

While approaching the pick-up point, I spotted a solitary, tall figure near a bus stand in the distance.  Upon getting closer, I discovered that my passenger for the night was none other than Batman.  
As I stopped my car and looked across the window, I saw the man’s cape fluttering gracefully in the wind, casting a dramatic silhouette against the backdrop of the city’s skyline. Batman then opened the door and sat in the backseat of my car.

“Gotham city?” I asked, looking into the rear view mirror offering half a smile.

I knew my feeble attempt at humor was not going to cut it with him, but I needed to assess the new customer, if I was to somehow try and prevent a repeat of last night.

“Somebody is getting real comfortable,” Batman growled back with a scowl, while handing me the golden ticket he held in his hand.

He then leaned back and looked at the road ahead in silence. I placed the card on the navigation system and started driving, deciding to remain quiet for the remainder of the journey.

As the minutes passed, the man masquerading as Batman slowly began to exude a certain kind of warmth, almost reluctant to admit he was having a decent time.

A wry smile even appeared on his face as he relaxed to the rhythm of New York’s evening traffic, silently observing people go about their daily lives.

From friends laughing at each other’s jokes in the side-lines to people enjoying a quiet meal at a bistro to commuters getting involved in heated disputes with one another to lovers simply sitting on a bench holding hands - he soaked it all in, with a quiet sense of detachment.

I inwardly heaved a huge sigh of relief. Hopefully, Batman won’t just suddenly barge out of the car, mid traffic, chasing after gangsters in a deserted alley. I also turned on the radio to play some music to further soothe the atmosphere.

And in a matter of minutes, both Batman and I were bobbing our heads, slowly jiving to the beat of a soaring jazz number. Though I had no idea about who the artist was, I could somehow feel the lingering edge from last night slowly wearing off, when suddenly, I was distracted by a beep from my navigation system.

I figured we had finally reached our destination and I gently slowed down the car to a halt.  
But my heart began to race again, when I realized I had stopped the vehicle just outside a police station.

Before I could utter another word, Batman was already out the door.  
“Keep the engine running,” he said, without looking back as he crossed the road to get to the police station.

I saw two police officers standing outside the precinct, drinking coffee and looking engrossed in conversation.

Their attention quickly turned towards the caped crusader, as he gently bowed his head while walking past them, offering also a quick two finger salute that caused both officers to break into a grin.  
One of the policemen then looked in my direction, winking and smiling at me, as if signalling to mention the arrival of this week’s ‘weirdo’ amongst our midst.

‘SHIT…….SHIT ……..SHIT’ I cursed to myself, kicking my feet around in the car while pretending to smile back at the officer.

A policeman had spotted me, and the last thing I needed right now was to spend a night in a jail cell.  
And I can say with certainty that this version of Batman is not looking to pay a courtesy visit to his old pal Gordon.

I kept the engine running, with my hands tightly gripping the steering wheel, wondering if I should just quietly drive away. But my body had already frozen and a part of me actually wanted to wait and see what was going to happen, and that scared me even the more.

I scanned the surrounding buildings looking for cameras and to my dismay, I found them everywhere. It felt like they had been specifically installed just to keep an eye on me.

Then when I looked across the road to steal a glance at the precinct again, I found the same officer staring at me while his buddy was busy answering a phone call. He had a curious look on his face, as if he was trying to connect the dots to a possible problem.

I suddenly felt a pit form in my stomach, when I heard loud noises emanate from the police building behind him. The screams of people echoed through the air, as unknown objects crashed and shattered to the floor.

The officer briefly glanced back before fixing his gaze on my panic-stricken face. Finally connecting the dots, he pointed his hand at me, looked me in the eye, and sternly yelled, “STAY!”

Soon after, gunshots also echoed from within the precinct. Both officers swiftly drew their weapons and charged toward the police building, guns pointed forward.

And everything began to unfold in slow motion from that very moment before my own eyes.  
As they reached for the door, a colossal ball of fire erupted from the building, obliterating everything in its path. The explosion sent shockwaves, tearing the two mens' bodies to shreds.

One officer's head soared 20 metres in the air, landing on the bonnet of my car before bouncing off to hit the lamppost adjacent to me, and finally settling in the dead space between my car and the vehicle in front.

It belonged to the policeman who had smiled at me only a minute earlier and now his haunting lifeless gaze sent me into a panicked frenzy.  I quickly put the gear in reverse, only to hit the car behind me, setting off its siren.

My senses suddenly snapped back to real time. It was as if the clock had been sped up, and I finally started to experience the full chaotic atmosphere around me. The branches of the trees around the precinct had caught fire, the sirens of multiple cars blared in unison while the people nearby were scared shitless, ducking helplessly for cover.

I quickly tried to compose myself before turning on the ignition again and tried to swerve to the right as much as possible, to avoid the car from running over the severed head in front. But I wound up chipping it from the side causing the head to roll over inwards and catch the full impact of my rear wheel. Wincing in disgust, I struggled to steady my trembling hands while gripping the steering wheel.

“FUCK!!!......FUCK!!!” I yelled out loud, once I had cleared a couple of blocks and when the nerves began to finally settle.

I could already see visions of the police breaking into my home and cuffing my hands in front of my kid.

‘What is going to happen to my son? He’s got no one else in this world’, I thought to myself, my mind fraught with worry.

I drove around the city aimlessly for the next 20 minutes, contemplating the increasing likelihood of my own incarceration.

Going to the police on my own accord made no sense, they wouldn’t believe my story anyway. I’d probably be tagged as an accomplice to the crime and, honestly, that wouldn’t surprise me. The cops can be ruthless when their own safety is under threat.

Then there was Mr Devilin himself and that wretched deal of his that I also needed to sit and worry about. Surely, I am not going to go through with the rest of it now, and he is not going to be pleased over it either. I thought it would best to probably lay low for a while until this all blew over.

So, I ditched my cell and stopped at a convenience store along the way to get a new burner phone.  
I reached my apartment at last, and quickly stuffed some clothes in a bag. I woke up Luke who was fast asleep on his bed and made him get dressed. We then sat in the car and headed for Philly where I thought I could crash at a friend’s place for a couple of days before thinking about my next move. I had an old buddy of mine since high school, Eric Gunther who had moved to Philadelphia for work. Reaching out to him felt like a good idea.

By the time I reached Eric’s home, it was already 4 in the morning. He was surprised to see me at his doorstep, with Luke sound asleep and resting on my shoulder, and immediately knew I was in some kind of trouble. He ushered me in and cleared the spare room for the two of us.

Eric and I agreed to get some rest first, and talk things over in the morning. After gently laying Luke down on the bed without waking him, I settled into a rocking chair nearby.  As I leaned back, the exhaustion washed over me, and I immediately drifted to sleep.

When I woke up, it took me a moment to realize I was still at Eric’s place. I checked my watch, it was already 8:00 AM. I then glanced at the bed next to me, and realized Luke was already up.  
‘He’s probably hungry or Eric’s already made something for him.’ I thought.  I could anyway hear the TV playing from living room.

I slowly got up from the chair and walked to the  hall still groggy from last night. My legs suddenly buckled, and I hit the floor hard.

Eric’s severed head lay skewered on a pitch fork erected in the middle of the living room. I tried to get up, but my legs buckled again.

I crawled all the way to his room like a dog and opened the door. I caught hold of the wall and pulled myself up to finally stand straight, and found my old friend’s headless body lying on the bed. I puked my guts out right there.

As I lay on my knees, with my head still spinning, I suddenly remembered Luke. He was nowhere in sight.

I got up and searched every nook and cranny of the apartment.

The bathrooms, the kitchen, the cupboards, under the bed, the attic, everywhere. He was nowhere to be found, and he is not the sort of kid to run off on his own. I then went and started to check the other apartments in the building including the terrace and could find no trace of him. Finally I remembered the basement where I had parked the car and I immediately rushed to look for him there.

As I reached the entrance to the basement, I saw droplets of blood in the parking area and it led all the way to the trunk of my car. My heart started pounding in my chest as I walked slowly, fearing the absolute worst.

Once I reached the car, with trepidation, I opened the trunk and slowly peered in.  
There, dead center, lay my burner phone, the same one I had purchased the previous night. As soon as I picked it up, it vibrated in my hand, revealing a new set of coordinates — coordinates pointing…. to my own address.

I shut the trunk and immediately started my drive back to New York. I drove as fast as possible and rushed to my apartment the moment I reached the city. When I opened the door to Luke’s room, I heaved a huge sigh of relief to see him with Jennifer, who was helping him with his lessons.

I sank into a couch in the hall, teetering almost on the verge of a breakdown. I think Jennifer somehow realized my state of mind and excused herself before leaving for her apartment. She also goaded Luke to come and sit next to his dad. The kid came and sat beside me, wrapping his arms around me and resting his head on my chest.

An overwhelming avalanche of guilt engulfed me, as I sat there thinking about my friend Eric, while also experiencing a feeling of intense relief, upon seeing that my son was safe.

Luke recalled me waking him up in the middle of the night, but he dismissed it as a dream, as he eventually woke up in his own bed. He then gestured towards a sealed envelope placed on the center table just a couple of feet away from us.

When I picked the envelope, I noticed the wax seal had a trident symbol embossed on it. I ripped it open and took out the letter. It read -

>

WE HAD A DEAL  
GET BACK TO YOUR REGULAR LIFE  
DON’T WORRY ABOUT THE COPS

A simmering rage gradually took hold within me. I wanted to get up and break every item in my apartment. Luke’s embrace was the only comforting antidote that prevented me from releasing all that pent-up frustration.

So I simply closed the letter and proceeded to get along with my daily chores. I showered, brought groceries, cooked, cleaned and then took Luke out for soccer practice. We were back home by 6 and I got about getting ready for my next appointment.

Once I was dressed, I simply sat in the living room, looking at the phone placed on the table, waiting for it to go off. And at 7:00 PM sharp I got the coordinates for my next pick up.

I got off the couch, headed to my liquor cabinet, and pulled out a full bottle of bourbon. After taking a big swig from it, I sat in the car and tossed the bottle onto the adjacent seat. As the engine purred to life, I hit the streets and got ready to pick up my new passenger for the night.
