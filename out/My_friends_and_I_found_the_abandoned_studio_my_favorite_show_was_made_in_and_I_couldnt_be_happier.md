Growing up, my parents practically raised me on movies and shows they had recorded onto VHS tapes. I watched things like Sesame Street and The Muppets for years, and I always loved it. When I was seven, I found some unlabeled tapes in the back of the cabinet we kept the movies in. Having watched every other movie in the cabinet countless times over, I put one in the VCR and sat back to watch it. As the colorful title screen popped up, I knew I had fallen in love with this show. 

It was called Howdy's House. It had a main cast of six puppets, and they were all colorful and bright. They were Sydney Scribe, Violet Virtuoso, Taylor Castleton, Poppy Honeycrisp, Douglas von Rowlf, and the titular host himself, Howdy Howards. After watching this show, I had realized that my childhood stuffed toy was of Douglas himself, being a blue dog with spots in warm colors all over him. My parents never seemed to know who the character was, so I assume they had found him in a thrift store and thought his Hawaiian shirt and bright red bowler were endearing. 

After that day, I began to seek out anything that had to do with this show. It was the only thing I watched, and after my parents split up when I was nine, it became more than just a show I enjoyed. It became an emotional crutch for me, and even now, I still can't get rid of my attachment to it. My father, who I primarily lived with, put our old VCR and television in my room when I was ten, when him and his wife got a new DVD player and television. I hardly left my room after that, watching the same episodes over and over again. When I got older, I started to peruse online forums hoping to find other fans of Howdy's House. I didn't find much anything on the several dozen websites I initially checked out. The only time I found anything was when I found a blog in the dredges of Google. It looked like it was from the 90s or very early 2000s, with the tacky colors and generally janky way of formatting. But it was titled "Whatever happened to Howdy's House?", and I was hooked. I still have my notebook from then, full of the scrawling handwriting of an excited child. It gave me the actually runtime the show had (from 1968-1981), why it was cancelled (a lawsuit), and a bunch of other things! But it didn't explain why people had forgotten about it so quickly. The website still updates to this day I believe. 

I took it upon myself to start scouring for merchandise from the show so I could find more out about it. I've found thrift stores, pawn shops, and junk stores are great places to look. The merchandise is often very cheap, due to no one really caring or knowing about it and the stores desperately wanting to get rid of it. I bought the Canada exclusive 7" record for only two dollars, which I still find rather miraculous. I've amassed quite a collection over the past ten years, but that isn't what this story is about. 

Just a month or so ago, I found out that I lived only a couple towns away from the town where Howdy's House was filmed, from the website. I was giddy calling my friends Violet and Taylor, telling them I had a perfect place for us to go this weekend. They didn't ask me why I found this small town akin to a ghost town so interesting, just asked what they should bring and how we were getting there. I just told them to bring a small bag and said we'd take a bus. They accepted that, and we met up at the bus stop that Saturday. I was more or less giggling the entire time, unable to keep from bouncing my leg while my friends talked about their most recent art projects. 

The town was small. Very small, mostly houses and small mom and pop shops with the paint faded and peeling, the windows all dusty. The streets were largely empty, except for children playing in the roads. I didn't mind, only looking for a building that looked like the one that was in that photo. Taylor and Violet weren't interested, still just talking to each other, Taylor having to stop and wipe her glasses off every so often because of the dust. I found the building after about twenty minutes of milling around. I recognized the shape of it, but the paint had peeled off and faded after 42 years of being abandoned, and the sign that had once proudly read "Howdy's House Workshop" was gone. My friends and I entered, and the inside appeared in much better shape than I thought. There were framed posters and drawings around the first room, and Violet put the pieces together. 

"Oh, God, Sid, are you fucking kidding me? This show again?" she scoffed. She never did like Howdy's House, we watched it once when she was over at my house. She hated it, told me to turn it off. I always thought that wasn't fair of her. She wasn't giving it a proper chance. 

I ignored her. I just started to look at the stuff around, and went deeper into the studio. I could hear Violet bitching to Taylor about how she hated how I made everything about this stupid puppet show, which did send a spike of white hot anger through my body. But I stayed quiet, and ignored them. There were rooms of desks still covered in sketches and fabric cut outs, rooms full of the sets and props, and any other thing that I could think of that I can't quite remember now. I was expecting that, but I was surprised when I got to a very small room that I believe was an office. 

I had always assumed that, when the show was cancelled, the puppets were put in some sort of storage. But when I opened a box that was behind the desk, I saw it was full of the puppets I was so familiar with. They were in decently good shape, just dusty and faded. It was a sort of out of body moment for me when I picked up the one on top. It was Poppy Honeycrisp, her blonde bouffant still as immaculate as I remembered, though her dress was rather crinkled. I put her back in, sort of shifting them around to see what was there. The only one that wasn't was Douglas, who was a walkaround puppet and could never have fit inside a box like this. I was shocked, and started sort of giggling, unsure how else to react. I picked up Howdy out of the box. He was still grayish blue, his clothes just as wrinkled as Poppy's dress. His bright blue hair, made of soft yarn fibers, was pushed back awkwardly, showing off the left side of his face. The later episodes of the show had started covering his face with his hair, and I realized why then. There was a large stain on his face, it stained that part of his face almost black. It broke my heart to see any sort of damage to his puppet, so I finger combed the hair down again. I gingerly put him back in the box, quickly shut it, and picked it up. It was heavier than I thought, likely due to Constella's infamous clay head. 

I left the office space, my legs weak from excitement. I called for my friends, then realized they were gone. They had left me. I couldn't find it in me to care, too excited with my box of puppets. I took the bus home as I did before. Something I did find rather odd was that it was dark out already, though I was sure we only went into the workshop at about noon and were only there for an hour at most. I didn't care, getting on the bus with my box, just about bursting at the seams with excitement. 

I got home, and it was quiet, and dark. My dad's wife often travels for work, and my dad enjoys going out with his friends. I didn't care, I was glad they weren't there. My dad's wife never did like how much I love Howdy's House, insisting that I'm "too old" for shows like this. It was the subject of many fights, and our relationship is incredibly strained because of it. She probably would've told me to throw out the puppets if she was there. But she wasn't, so I went to my room, full of vintage merchandise for Howdy's House. I had shelves of stuffed toys, books, records, even a binder of plush patterns that had been produced with the plush toys I had made from them next to it. The only piece of merchandise I had that wasn't shelved was my plush of Douglas I've had all my life, which I took to most places with me. I took him out of my bag and put him on my bed, placing a small kiss on his forehead. 

I had a shelf of some other things that I don't remember now, which I quickly cleared off. I put the puppets on there, careful to make sure they were sitting straight and secure, their clothes as proper as they could be. As I was straightening out Andy Anchorman's blazer, I started making plans to iron out the clothes. They were made to be removable for sake of easy costume changes. The only puppets without that were Sydney, Violet, and Taylor, because they were made by someone else in the late 50s. They're the only Violet and Taylor I can bring myself to care about. When I finished putting the last puppet (Hemlock N. Key) on the shelf, I sat back, admiring them. I never would've thought I'd have something like this. Something so utterly priceless. 

I went to bed after that, so exhausted I didn't even put pajamas on, just laying on my bed in my clothes and passing out. But I was woken up mere hours later by a small thump. I groggily looked around, thinking of the plush toys I made had fallen due to how heavy it sounded (I had filled parts of them with rice). Instead, I saw Howdy face down on the ground. A small shock of panic went through me, so I rushed to pick him up. I made sure he was okay, dusting off whatever may have gotten onto him from the carpet. His hair had moved when I did this, and I noticed how... human his gaze felt. Like he was really seeing me. It sent a chill down my spine, and my heart was beating quickly. I pulled his hair back down, and the feeling didn't go away. I put him back on the shelf, then laid back down. But I didn't really sleep properly, I just decided to get up when I heard my dad come home and then leave again, not bothering to even try to say good bye. What else was new? I had to do my weekly dusting anyway. The shelves got very dusty very quickly, and I didn't want anything on the shelf to get dusty. 

The feeling of being watched didn't leave me as I dusted the shelves. The only shelf I left undusted was the puppet shelf. I had wiped it off the night before, I didn't have to dust it. 

My phone started ringing about halfway through my task. It was about ten o'clock, which I was confused by. Dusting usually only took me an hour, and I had started at six. Where had the time gone? I answered the call anyway, and it was Taylor. 

"Hey Sid, what are you up to?"

"I'm dusting my shelves," I said, pulling the records off my shelf to dust the whole shelf, setting them on my desk. 

"Oh. Listen, Sid, I just wanted to say I was sorry for leaving you in that town all alone. Did you get home safely? Nothing happened?"

"Obviously not," I responded, annoyance tinging my voice. I didn't care what Taylor had to say as an apology, I just wanted to maintain my shelves. 

"Alright. You know, Violet and I think your, uh, 'interest' in this show is a bit unhealthy."

I paused my dusting, dumbfounded. Unhealthy? How could this be unhealthy?

"Excuse me?"

"You're just- You're clearly using this to hide from the problems you have. Maybe you should talk to someone about it instead of collecting all this stuff?"

"Taylor, I think you're ridiculous. Am I not allowed to have interests?"

"Sid, that isn't what I said-"

"Oh, you're frustrating. I don't have problems, I'm busy. Good bye."

"Wait, Sidn-"

I hung up on her, putting my phone on my desk and ignoring Taylor and Violet trying to call me. They were terrible friends anyway, I didn't care. 

I finished up my dusting, putting everything back in its place and sighing. I was tired, but not ready to sleep yet, even though the sun seemed to already be going down. I really was losing so much time, I don't know what happened. I glanced at my phone and there were so many missed calls, but they seemed to have stopped about twenty minutes before. I sat on the ground in front of my puppet shelf.  My dad was unlikely to be home for the next few days, and his wife wasn't scheduled to be home for another month. Good, I didn't want to be around another person. The idea of it made me angry. 

My friends were making me angry as well. Who were they to try and say this was unhealthy? Why would it be? How is it any different than someone who collects coins or snowglobes? It isn't any different, it's just more interesting. 

I looked up at my puppet shelf with a feeling I later identified as reverence. I had these puppets that were used on my favorite show. They weren't replicas, they were the real deal. My heart started to speed up, and I giggled a bit. Howdy still seemed to be staring at me, but I didn't find it as unnerving anymore. In a way, I find it comforting. I ended up falling asleep on the ground, sleeping like a rock. It was very quiet when I woke up, and there were more missed calls from Taylor and Violet. Even some texts, with them frantically asking if I was okay, because they'd been calling me for... two days? Now that was ridiculous, and I'm still unsure if I was actually asleep that long or if I just forgot a whole day. I do think they were pulling leg. 

These puppets that they had endlessly mocked are shaping up to be better friends than Violet or Taylor could ever hope to be, though they were rather quiet. They aren't anymore, they speak loud and clear now, I think they were just shy in that first week or so. Not Howdy though, he was whispering all week, but I didn't realize it. I guess I was too caught up in my anger at Violet and Taylor to properly hear it. Or maybe I dismissed it as my tinnitus, I don't know. I just know that that studio did make me feel happier than I've ever felt, to give me these new friends of mine that are so much better than anyone I've ever known. I couldn't be happier, yet everyone is acting like something's wrong. Saying I'm childish, crazy even. I think they're just being silly, honestly. I think they're jealous, they wish they had what Howdy and I have.
