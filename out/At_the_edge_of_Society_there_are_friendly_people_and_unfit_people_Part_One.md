It was Cullen’s fourth month on the job. He sat in front of the alert board, dozens of dormant lights and buttons at his fingertips. Half as many screens separated the alert board from the reinforced glass window, which had been built to withstand carpet bombings. The window itself separated him from the Outside. From his chair, he could see rows upon rows of dark, quiet trees on the horizon, a field of grass and wildflowers sitting as a welcome carpet in front that bridged the gap between the creepy woods and his little slice of the walls.

It was raining, distant thunder roaring. He watched the rivulets run down the window glass as he sipped coffee, his mug proudly declaring him Number #1 Border Watcher - though he’d had to scribble out the title of Dad with a blue marker - as he waited for a stranger to show up. Today was his mandatory bi-weekly solo shift, and he appreciated it, since it meant he could shift through a novel, ingest caffeine, and just quietly exist between actual work moments.

He would not let himself drift off, though. If you fall asleep, sometimes you wake up somewhere else, or they take your fingers. At least, so he heard.

The screens between the board and the window, all lined up horizontally, showed regular forest, regular desert, regular rivers and regular suburbs. Regular, at least, if you ignored the fact that they were arranged in patchwork patterns with little consistency or logic. There were even mountains, a whole range’s worth broken up into bits, its spine parts making up little shards of elevation that scattered like blocks through the area.

A light lit up. 13-A-7, read the label. Cullen looked to the corresponding screen. It showed him a stretch of forest darkness, and he could make out a tall, thin man whose arms and legs were bent at very wrong angles doing some kind of twitch-step walk. Another light lit up, 13-A-1, and Cullen’s eyes went to the relevant screen. It showed the figure again, standing at the edge of a forest, and he looked out the window to see the creature looking right at him.

Cullen smiled, tipped his mug in its direction like he was greeting a coworker. He waited for it to approach. He didn’t have to wait long. He blinked, and it was standing right outside the window.

“Left. To the smaller one.” Cullen instructed, rolling his swivel chair towards a little window that had a tube you could put things through, which reminded him of those bank deposit things. The window looked pretty much like a prison window, just with reinforced glass thrown in.

The stranger leaned down, all crooked, and smiled a very wide smile. There was something wrong with its mouth, too many teeth or maybe too little, but Cullen only glanced at it before nodding.

“Do you observe the Formality?” Cullen asked, business like. He’d seen it’s hands, he’d seen it’s feet, he’d seen it’s eyes, tongue, and teeth. Now he just needed it to look him in the eye.

It did. A little pinprick light in its hollow sockets focused on him, and Cullen met the look. It was a little harder, this time. It was always hard with the really strange ones, but the boxes were now checked, so he was safe.

“Yes.” It answered. It sounded whispery, but normal.

“What brings you to Society?” Cullen followed up the earlier question, sipping from his mug as he broke eye contact. Luckily, he could be as rude as he wanted. This was just a formality, and he knew this thing wouldn’t ask much more from him. And, if he was honest, he appreciated that being acknowledged upfront.

“I wish to weave paper.”

“I grant you entry. You are a friend.” The words never felt less stiff to say, but Cullen had to say them.

The creature was let in through the gate a little ways down to the left. He watched on a side monitor as it walked up to the big steel doors, and heard the creak as they slid open. The viewpoint changed to a different camera, and he saw the guards receiving it. They were always pretty stiff, since they had to do all the normal processing things you did with regular people other places, except you were patting down a whatever-the-hell and not a human.

He turned his eyes back to the window. He almost picked up his book again, only to groan as another light went on. He didn’t look at the labels and the monitors this time, just watched the woods. He realized a few minutes later he probably should have, when Ron’s voice, the sectional border communications officer, gruffly spoke over the intercom.

“Can’t see its eyes, or its hands. Caution advised.”

Cullen was, all of a sudden, pretty on edge. He’d slacked. If it was trying any tricks, if there’d been any signs, he might’ve missed them during its approach.

A woman began to walk out of the treeline, wearing a raincoat that looked like it’d been left to rot away in a closet for a couple decades. Their coat was moth-eaten, patched, and torn. As she slowly walked, step by step, across the grass and towards Cullen’s booth, dust trailed off her like rain off an umbrella. Her hair was too long, her leathery wide-brimmed hat tipped down at an angle as she kept her eyes on the ground in front of her. He couldn’t see her eyes, and if she had hands, they were inside her coat.

Cullen swallowed.

The entity didn’t need to be told to go left. It walked over to the second window, and it leaned down, and didn’t show its tongue or its teeth or its eyes or its hands or its feet. It spoke.

“Hello. Fair weather. May I go inside? It is raining.” She sounded polite, her voice warm and inviting.

Cullen walked up to the second window, peered out at her. “Do you observe the Formality?” He asked, his voice just a little strained.

“Yes. I even bought formal attire.” She answered.

Cullen frowned, flexed his jaw and his fingers. He had a personal firearm. But training had stressed, repeatedly, it was a maybe works sort of thing, and definitely not a first option. Besides, all he needed to do was turn her away. That is… If she was actually unfit, or else there’d be consequences.

He pursed his lips. “Can you show me your teeth? Hands?”

The entity removed its hands from the inside of its coat, still leaving the sleeves to dangle, and showed him some very pale, very oily arms. Her hands were normal, aside from looking like she’d dipped them in gasoline, and having very yellow nails. Cullen was nonplussed, though, when she then handed him a handful of what looked like teeth, specifically canines, from her pocket.

He tried very hard not to look uncomfortable. He was pretty sure he failed. “Are those… Yours?” He turned away from her to briefly stick a finger in his mouth, running over his teeth. They were all there, but he quickly convinced himself, almost, that the shape of his canines were a dead match.

“Yes, but they can be yours.” She put them through the tube. The thump sounded, and he now owned a dozen extra teeth.

“Just… Show me your face.” He breathed out.

“I’m saving my face for someone else.” She answered, far too casually for Cullen’s liking.

“I can’t let you in, then.” Cullen shrugged, a roll of his shoulders that was more to make sure he was ready to move if he needed to.

The entity was quiet for a moment. Completely still. The rain, for a split second, just stopped. Cullen glanced at the window, and saw the rivulets frozen in time. The strange woman pulled out a locket, briefly let it dangle in front of Cullen’s eyes, and flicked her wrist to make it snap open. In one half was a tiny, broken clock, like the one you’d see in a watch, and in the other half there was an old, faded photo.

 She swiftly returned it to her coat. He saw, in that wrinkled picture, a woman who looked a lot like this one, except he could see her face. It was scarred, in ways he didn’t know were possible, but it was a beautiful, kind face. A man that looked a lot like him had been standing right next to her. He felt like he knew her. He felt like she’d, through that slice of the past, looked directly into his eyes and seen everything.

Cullen realized he wasn’t breathing, and took a deep gasp of a breath. His hands shook, and he briefly glanced at the marked out word on his mug before looking at the woman. She wasn’t there anymore, and he saw her being received by the guards at the gate. She did not do anything strange. She followed every rule, kept her manners, and went on into Society. No alarms blared.

Cullen took a moment to force the tremble out of his shoulders and let the tension out of his back. He looked aside at the control panel, the screens. The buttons and lights. Protocol dictates that unfits that pass through need to have a report written up on them, so an alert can be put out. In the same vein, though, any false reports, those also had consequences. And he wasn’t sure.

“You don’t test the other side, unless you want to be the other.” He mumbled to himself. “And good neighbors don’t make enemies out of friends.” That was the ECFK motto, and so he followed it. He wrote a brief write-up, opting for a to-watch notice instead, and spent the next two hours mulling over the response he got. They said the report, at the tail end, did not match the verbal summary he recorded and sent.

He wasn’t in trouble, so he resumed his rain watching. He almost thought he could see specks of dust floating down with the droplets. Right when time was about to move on to the seventh hour of his shift, he got a different kind of alert. No one else, and nothing else, had approached his little security station.

He checked one of the monitors. Ron’s smoke-withered voice came over the intercom again. “Friendly in distress.” Cullen’s slice of wall was called up, and so he readied his sidearm, dressed up in his sleek green-black hazard suit, and got in the buggy he’d been graciously assigned to roam the Outside with when duty called him into its twisting, patient depths. He took the teeth with him. Fresh boons were better, and he did not feel like trusting stale trinkets tonight.

There were no roads, not in this neck of the Outside at least, outside the suburbs. More specifically, there were no consistent, logical, complete pathways that were guaranteed to bring you where you thought they went. Cullen drove off the path, and wished he had a jeep. When he’d asked about being sent out into the wild in a buggy of all things, he’d just been told it was ‘considered impolite to hide in shells’. When he’d asked for a translation into normal speech, they’d told him the strangers do not like those who hide in moving shelters.

Leaves that were varyingly out of season fell around him, like snowflakes, as he entered the forest from the field. He was careful not to drive over the wildflowers, and watched for discarded objects, especially ones that looked like they meant something to someone. The buggy’s wheels slowly crunched over dry foliage, and Cullen ignored the occasional whispers coming his way. He kept the teeth in a small see-through glass cube, with a small door in it, that dangled from the front lights.

He reached the designated area unhindered, finding a silent grove that, if you explored its perimeter, you would notice is cordoned off. There was a ring around it where the grass and foliage, if you looked closely, was hiding a small sea of colorful pebbles. Inside the grove, sitting on a stump, sat the Moss Man. Cullen had personally cleared the Moss Man as friendly, not unfit, during his first week. So he was relieved to see him rather than the million other things that he knew lurked in the Outside, or the million more he didn’t.

The Moss Man was dressed in a crisp wedding suit, which looked freshly pressed. He was a surprisingly thin thing, made of boulders and vibrant green patches that had been worked, by his own hands, into a roughly humanoid shape. His large mossy brows turned down as he regarded Cullen.

“I have been jailed.” The Moss Man stated, bluntly, in a voice that was, instead of rough like you’d expect, more like a trickling stream.

“I… See. On your way back home?” Cullen ventured towards him, craned his neck and looked around. He assessed, and started taking the colored pebbles out of the ring. He found exactly twelve larger ones, arranged in a specific pattern where, once moved, he could almost seamlessly place all of the teeth he’d been given into their slots.

The hairs on his arms prickled over goosebumps.

 “I walked the paths, as I always did.” Declared the Moss Man. “And then I was entrapped by fiends, see with your eyes their work!” He gestured grandly about at the ring. He went on about something or other related to his destination, mentioned being caught changing out of his human skin after a bout of ‘path pondering’, as he put it. Cullen wasn’t listening, not fully.

He did not stay to catch up with the Moss Man, not that he’d understand, or be allowed to understand, half of what would’ve been said. As soon as the stranger took his first step out of the ring, shedding his wedding garb, Cullen was back in the buggy and driving towards safety. The way back was longer. Much longer, it felt.

Time seemed to stand still at various points. Cullen noticed, as a low wind picked up, things in his peripheral started to shake, groan, flitter or wind-whistle before going completely still, completely silent. It felt like he was being noticed, and assessed. He swore he felt eyes on his back, causing goosebumps to run up his neck. Eventually, he crunched his way out of the woods, tension settling in his muscles as he cursed himself for his carelessness. He only realized he’d heard shattering glass, worked wood snapping, and the air being squeezed out of small toys after his vehicle’s tires had done their work.

He paused. He went dead quiet, and so did the world around him. No rustling of branches, no grass stirring. The wind was gone, and the rain from earlier, while he’d been distracted, had moved on to other things. At the other side of the field of grass and wildflowers, standing right in front of the reinforced glass, was a stranger.

And he didn’t know if it was human, or from Outside.

It was a man in a simple white t-shirt, simple blue cargo jeans. If Cullen squinted, he could see tags on them, though the labels on them seemed not quite right. He couldn’t make them out at this distance. The man was facing away from him.

Cullen, quiet as could be, stepped out of the vehicle, trying not to make a sound. He made a decision with little effort. He started walking towards the gate, towards the little side door his keycard granted him access to. To safety, and civilization, behind a door so thickly padded with metal and markings you’d have a hard time crushing it in even the biggest of trash compactors.

He refused to make eye contact, or even start the process of getting there. One initial glance, now not even a single graze of the eye on the back of the man’s head. He was halfway across the field when it turned out not to matter. The world was too quiet, was listening too closely, and a single flower trampled underfoot released what felt like the world’s loudest death cry: a single, whispery crunch of his boot.

The man turned to him. He had eyes, and a mouth. He had normal hands and, as far as Cullen could tell, normal shoes that might be protecting regular old feet.  The man smiled at Cullen, and his teeth were not a perfect white, but that middle ground you expected from most people, where there’d be a little bit of plaque that just needed a quick scrub.

The man did not look Cullen in the eye. If you didn’t pay attention, you might not notice a little thing like that, but he’d been told multiple times they needed to look you in the eye. The man was looking at Cullen’s torso, just slightly angled down, but not at his eyes.

Cullen made a break for it. The world whipped to life around him. The quiet patter of rain started to drizzle down in a flash, the blades of the grass around him bent with dew, and he could hear the usual quiet but present sounds of the woods. He also heard the man taking strides towards him, equal exactly in distance to his, but far more relaxed.

Cullen reached the door first. He swiped his key, shut himself inside, just as the stranger reached the door at the same time he did. He’d been walking slower than Cullen, all casual like, like he was going over to see why Cullen was suddenly going all jumpy. Cullen looked at the thickly padded door, little sentences written finely all across its reinforced frame, and failed to find comfort or security.

He went over to the control room. The man was staring at him through the window, looking concerned, and went over to the second window as he was meant to. Cullen was almost inclined to just leave, but he knew he couldn’t. “Without manners, without safety”, pointedly, had been one of the statements facing him down from the door’s orderly scribblings.

He went to the window. Pulled up his chair. Sipped his coffee, and the man still did not look him in the eye, instead focusing on his mug.

“Do you observe the Formality?”

“I do, yeah. You okay, man?” The man replied, a slight crack in his voice that would be reassuringly normal in any other circumstance. He scratched at his face, as if nervous, looked worried. Shifted slightly when Cullen stared at him, waiting for eye contact, noted how everything was proper about him but the one thing he needed most.

“Can you look me in the eye?”

“Sure, man, yeah. Need to follow regulations, right?”

Cullen stared hard, and picked out that the man was, essentially, watching Cullen’s eyelids, not his eyes.

“Go back where you came from. You’re denied entry.” Cullen turned to look away, to wait till the man left.

He heard the swoosh of the tube. He frowned, turned without looking at the second window, focused on the object. It was an ID, with a name that was just uncommon enough, but still sufficiently familiar, to be any person’s name. The picture matched the stranger, and Cullen had a feeling that, if he pulled up records, he’d find every line of information checked out. The picture showed the man looking slightly aside.

Cullen heard a thud.

He stood up, jolting, and turned towards the window. The man was now bashing his head, repeatedly, into the glass. Any sense of security Cullen had died in the next blow. The man’s forehead split open, began to bleed, and the glass started to crack.

He watched the glass, in the same way it’d developed patterns earlier as rain dripped gently down its smooth frame, cry out with pitched crunches as veins of impending shattering began to bloom out from where it was struck. The man worked like a drum, eyes never on Cullen, but on the wall on the other side of the room, where the door that brought Cullen to his work space also could bring him back into civilization. Into proper, structured Society.

Cullen hit a button. An alarm went off. Ron’s voice called in security. Cullen himself did not unsheathe his firearm, having no idea if it could protect him or if it’d just make matters exponentially worse. By the time he drew it, the man had begun to shatter his skull inwards, his forehead a bloody pulp, cuts running healthy typical red down his jaws. Only when he was about to break through did he finally look Cullen in the eye, since by then it didn’t matter.

He smiled his perfectly flawed smile. He reared his head back, Cullen’s heart pounding, ready to shatter the most important formality he subscribed to: the concept of barriers.

The Moss Man pounded out from the woods. He was dressed in his suit again, and he screamed unusually mannered obscenities at the stranger who was so actively breaking fundamental laws. The Moss Man overpowered him with little effort, began dragging the man kicking and screaming into the woods, like he was being pulled away from an oasis he desperately needed to survive.

As the man disappeared into the forest, returning to its depths, he stared at Cullen. He made direct eye contact, showed his hands, let his shoes slide off. He smiled, showing tongue and teeth. Cullen had never seen so much hate in a smile.

Cullen stared into his mug, not wanting to return the stranger’s look. He tried not to look at the bloody smear on the glass, to notice how spider-webbed the spot it’d been struck now was. He did his best to not think of the next solo shift, and the woman, or to realize why the maps showing the borders of Society and the Outside, those jigsaw maps, were always slowly changing.

Most of all, he tried not to forget why he’d taken the marker to his mug, and crossed out that precious little word.
