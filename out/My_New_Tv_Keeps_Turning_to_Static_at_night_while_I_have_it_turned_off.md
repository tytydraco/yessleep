Okay so I got a new Firestick TV a month ago, and it’s been in really good, modern condition. No bugs, and it only buffers when the internet is down. But recently it’s been behaving very…strangely…to say the least. Specifically at 3 am, the witching hour.

It started about two weeks The other night, I got up to go to the bathroom. The time was 2:58 AM. I came back in at 3:05, and the TV was on in static. But it wasn’t normal black and white, salt and pepper static-It was red static. A little creeped out, I searched this up. It told me that it was probably just a problem with the HDMI, though it didn’t say anything about red static. Being under 18 and unable to leave the house, I grabbed my remote, turned it off, and stared at the ceiling until I was finally able to drift off.

I’m a deep sleeper, so I didn’t notice my TV doing this again until like 5ish days after. I woke up with a start, feeling as if I were being watched. My TV was back to red static. Feeling afraid, I looked at it for a moment and noticed a figure… it appeared to be the subtle figure of a bony human…so bony it was a skeleton. With the figure, I could almost hear some indistinguishable whisper within the static. I couldn’t explain it. So, with a heavy, drowsy body, I turned the TV around and, after a while, fell back asleep. 

The next night was a Friday night, so after a FaceTime with my boyfriend, I decided to stay up and watch something. I am unashamed to admit that I still watch My Little Pony, and have been watching this often. I have ADHD that sometimes makes my mind wander, so I like to have the subtitles on with everything I watch. I had thought that the incident from the night before was a dream, so I shrugged it off. That was when the subtitles stopped matching my show. Instead, long and unusual numbers began to show up. I was perplexed to say the least. Then, the volume cut off all the way, and the TV screen began to stretch out, distorting the faces of the ponies. But the subtitles weren’t stretching. Now I started to see unusual words between each number. Words like “new flesh” and “you’re mine.” Unsure of what to do, I grabbed the remote to turn off the TV. But it didn’t turn off. Instead, the red static came back. Then, the image changed to a young girl on a swing. Her skin was torn and rotting, and her hair was blonde and in knots. She wore a white, blood drenched gown. My bedroom began to stink a fowl stench. The room became overbearingly cold, and I couldn’t move my body. I’ve heard stories of sleep paralysis, and this is exactly how I felt; I was paralyzed. “Go to sleep, friend,” She told me. And without a single thought in mind, I did.

For the past week since the incident, I’ve been sleeping in the bathtub, my phone next to me so that I could set an alarm and leave before my parents needed to use it. We have a small house with only one bathroom. The static always stopped after four. Since then, nothing has happened, but I have a deep, gut wrenching feeling that this was not the end. I’ll make another post if something else happens. Cross my heart. Im afraid.
