It won't be long until I'm not making enough milk for my child. She drinks so much and needs to drink a little more each day. I don't know what to do.

My daughter is literally a gift from the heavens. I didn't think I would be a mom for a long time. I have small fallopian tubes. 

When we got pregnant, it was such a wonderful surprise. That wonder didn't last. The pregnancy didn't go well. My blood pressure shot up really high one night, and the boy, Alex, didn't make it.

I had a miscarriage at six months. The doctor said I had pre-eclampsia.

I remember staring at the ceiling when Dr. Talbot told me Alex was dead. There was a water stain on the ceiling just above the ultrasound machine that looked like a face. A screaming, open-mouthed face.

In the days that followed, I got sick. My little boy was rotting inside of me. My doctor couldn't help. I had to leave the state to remove Alex from my body because politicians suck.

I felt guilty even though I knew I did everything Dr. Talbot told me to. I wanted that baby so badly. Some things can't be helped.

Things were bleak for me after that. I wasn't taking care of myself. It was hard to even move some days. I'd lay in bed, stare at the ceiling and try to force anything to move. Even a tiny wiggle like a finger was too much for me most days. 

My sadness was too much for my husband, and one night he left. He said it hurt too much to watch me or something like that. When we married, I thought he could do anything. Keeping his vows wasn't one of them.

One night I was staring at the ceiling, and I knew I needed to leave. I got up and went. No shoes or pants, just a long Tinkerbelle t-shirt to cover my butt and car keys.

Driving without thought or direction, I wound up at a forest reserve outside the city. The stars were so bright, and I had an overwhelming need to touch them, to be closer to them somehow.

I wandered the trail searching for a way to get closer to the sky when I found myself standing before a giant Bur Oak. Its stout crooked branches provided a path to the heavens. I didn't mind the bark tearing and gouging at my exposed skin. I didn't notice until I slipped on a branch and realized the liquid I slid on was blood from the gouges in my arms and thighs. The blood and pain did not matter. I had to be close to the sky. 

The top branch swayed as I held it tight. I was so near the stars. I could see constellations that my grandpa would point out to me as a child. I found the Bear, the Lion, and the Big Dipper. It brought me peace I had not felt in some time.

That peaceful moment released a pain I didn't know I was holding on to. I felt light, and I thought about letting go of the tree and floating away in the breeze. That's when I saw the star fall.

The ball of light was surprisingly dark for a shooting star. The fire coming from it was green and purple, unlike the bright yellow of shooting stars I had seen. It hit the ground further up the trail. I could see it from the tree. It pulsed with a steady rhythmic power like a heartbeat I felt over my entire body. 

The steady thrum of power drew me to it, so I scrambled down the tree and hiked through the dark woods. Instinctively I left the path and trudged over rocks and tree limbs that clawed at my skin with every step. I could not feel my body, but the ache inside my heart lessened the closer I came to the star.

Then I saw it in a mound of dirt and debris. A small pod, the size of a bassinet, left a trench the length of a football field in the soil.

Love and wonder overwhelmed me as I stepped closer to the pod. Then as I stood next to the pod, it opened, and I felt forgiveness and relief for the first time.

The baby inside was tiny. Five pounds. Though she was utterly alien somehow, I knew she was a little girl.

Her many arms twisted and writhed helplessly. When she touched me, she opened her beak and squalled like a newborn.

The poor thing was scared and needed a mama. I needed a child. We were made for each other.

The rest of that night was a blur. Somehow, I dragged her pod back to my car. I drove us home, and we slept in my recliner, clutching each other for comfort.

It was only a short time until morning, and I had to find food for my girl. I tried everything in the apartment. I had milk, creamer, and some formula for my little Alex, just in case I had trouble producing milk.

The formula was the closest to what she needed, but I could tell it wasn't what she needed. I could feel her dissatisfaction. Even if she was too young to talk, I knew exactly what she wanted the moment I gazed into her indigo eye. She needed something more than I could give.

I didn't know what to do. My baby needed a mother's milk, but I didn't know where to find any. It wasn't like I could ask for help. She was my precious secret, and she needed to stay a secret.

No one would accept her the way she looked. Maybe when she was older and stronger, they could be swayed to see her as the miracle that I saw her as, but until then, she would be different and other. 

My mama had me praying every night since I could put my hands together, but when Alex died, I couldn't find the faith or the will to ask for guidance. I needed guidance. I was so scared of losing another child that I prayed long and hard. I begged any god that would listen for help.

Tears streamed down my face as I asked for one more chance to be a mother. I asked for the will and intelligence to keep my little girl safe. I prayed and sobbed, and a second miracle happened the following day. I began to lactate.

It is impossible to describe the relief I felt when my girl began to drink. Her tung expressed the milk into her open beak as her many arms tapped rhythmically on my chest. She was content, and I felt like I had seen daylight for the first time.

I felt her thoughts. We were connected in an unimaginable way. The strangeness of bonding so completely with anyone, especially a life not from this world, was not lost on me. I had been blessed.

I named my little girl Kiara.

There was an exchange student in my class junior year, and her name was Kiara. I always thought that was the prettiest name. It means the first ray of the sun. That's a beautiful thing.

It's been difficult taking care of my little Kiara. I must work to support us, but I can't leave her with anyone, and I won't leave her alone. I bring her to work with me at the farm and home.

She usually wraps her long arms around me and breastfeeds while I work the checkout. Sometimes I let her play under the counter when no one is around. She's a good climber with all those arms, and she can scuttle back up under my shirt pretty fast if anyone comes through the door.

Kiara's getting bigger every day. My little girl drinks more and more, and soon I don't think I'll be able to make enough milk to feed her. It's not like I'm not making a ton of milk. I am making enough milk to drown a daycare. It's just not enough for her the way she's growing.

I've lost so much weight since I started feeding my girl. My face is bony, but my body looks big because Kira hides under my clothes. People are beginning to suspect something is wrong with me.

Yesterday, I walked into the Hardee's, and my cousin Sharon threw a hamburger at me. It was one of those big double patty Angus burgers, and she wouldn't leave me alone until I ate the whole thing. That took about a minute. I can eat like a champ.

I have not sat down to a meal of less than four thousand calories in the last month. In fact, I've been eating everything in sight since Kiara turned six months old. It's crazy the stuff I want to eat now. I have cans of condensed milk in my car just in case I get hangry. I've been drinking heavy whipping cream like it's Gatorade. Last night I was spooning coconut oil out of the jar, and I didn't even realize it. 

The problem is more is needed. I can't put on weight and can't seem to make more milk no matter how much I eat. Kira drinks all the time.

I can tell through our bond that she wants more. It's just a little bit of discontent every time my breast empties. I need her to be safe. I need her to be content.

It's an incredible feeling being a mother after so many setbacks. It is rewarding and joyful. Being a mother is also absolutely terrifying. I stay awake often, worrying if she's getting enough to eat or if she's happy.

Last night I looked up how to produce more milk on the internet. The first result was from the USDA. The freaking United States Department of Agriculture has tips for increasing my milk supply.

Am I a cow? Am I considered agriculture by the government? That explains how the senators in my state talk about women.

After I took a few breaths, I clicked the link. The tips seemed okay. I was doing most of them. There are a few things on the list that I still need to do.

The three biggest ones are diet, sleep, and stress. I wouldn't call my diet healthy. I might call it excessive, massive, and unbalanced, but I would not call it healthy. I'm not really sleeping, and I'm definitely not limiting stress. Stress is piling on.

I'm stressed about everything. What if someone sees my girl? What if I can't take care of her? What if she is taken from me? What if she leaves? I'm trying so hard, and it doesn't feel like enough.

I don't know what to do if I can't make enough milk for my little girl. I can't imagine living without all her arms wrapped around me. 

There is a panic growing in me every day. I may need to tell someone about Kiara. I can't feed her all on my own anymore. We need help.
