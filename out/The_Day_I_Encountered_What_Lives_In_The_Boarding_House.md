I’m not going to get into specifics of where I live, I know people I’ve told this to have had the urge to seek this place out, but after what happened that night, I couldn’t bear the thought of someone going through the same experience I have. It’s been thirteen years now, but not a night goes by where the horrible nightmare doesn’t claw its way back into my thoughts. But I feel like enough time has passed where I can speak openly and publicly about the experience I had that night I lost my brother in the boarding house.

It was about a week after my younger brother’s twelfth birthday and I had decided to fulfill a promise I had made to him as a birthday present. My younger brother had always been intrigued by urban legends that went around, one in particular happened to be relevant to my home town. You see, there is this old boarding house, in the woods, that closed down in the 50’s due to poor management that now lays in decay. Nothing sinister happened in the building before it closed down. In fact, up until 25 years ago it was open to the public to visit, it was considered one of the top boarding houses in my state. It had held a significant historical value for our community long after it closed. Then, for whatever reason, the historical society in our town abruptly closed it down without warning. A couple years later our town had a large amount of kids go missing and because it happened so closely to the closing of the boarding house, that legend began to spread as if it were truth.

The legend states that if any child was to ever enter the boarding house, that the house would not let them leave. It was said that something else had taken up inhabitance in the house and had a fascination with collecting children as trinkets. While no one could say for certain what exactly lived in that building now, those that claimed to have seen it could only describe its glowing yellow eyes. As a kid this story sent chills up my spine and always made me afraid of even getting close to the place. When I turned 18 though, I decided to enter the building with a group of friends, who were also over 18. Nothing happened to any of us at the time, we had actually visited multiple times, sometimes even camping overnight. I mean, it was always unnerving because the place had no electricity or water and made ghastly noises when the wind picked up, but to my knowledge the place was safe. And besides the occasional wildlife encounter, we never encountered anything particularly terrifying. Until that day I just figured the legends were both a way to keep kids from vandalizing the property and to explain the random disappearances as a monster, instead of a random pervert terrorizing children. And up until that night I had no reason to believe otherwise.

The night started off like it normally did. A trek through the woods in the dead of night to avoid running into local law enforcement. The boarding house while close to town, was buried deep in the only forest nearby. There was a long winding road that looped back home. We always avoided walking along the road though due to patrols running that route constantly, instead, we elected to take the footpaths that had been carved out over the years by the local ruffians and I who had frequented the house.

The house laid in the only clearing in the forest, what once was a parking lot was now all cracked and had been overtaken mostly by the local fauna. There were not too many trees near the house, despite every other plant taking up residence in the decrepit building, for whatever reason the trees grew away from the house. It kind of looked like the tree line was trying to get away. The three story structure itself had been overtaken by a thick mass of thorny vines. It didn’t matter how often we visited, it felt like every time we had to clear the brush to make a clearing for the entrance.

We broke our way in, snapping just enough of the branches to make small opening, but not enough to alert suspicion of a break in. I knew getting out would be a lot more work, but at the time I was not worried about having to escape. Like I mentioned, prior to this night, the scariest thing I had encountered in here was a deer that somehow got trapped on the second floor. Up until now the place was harmless.
The second we made it inside though, I felt a chill feeling of unease I had never experienced here before. I could tell something was different but I could not pin down what exactly. I decided to ignore that feeling and grabbed out the flashlights I had packed so we could begin exploring. I could tell my brother was excited. If that feeling of unease was gripping him too, he didn’t let it show.

“Anywhere you want to check out first?” I asked.

“What about upstairs?!” He yelled pointing his flashlight towards the stairwell.

“Shhh, we have to be careful, cops still patrol around here.” I whispered loudly as I ushered him towards the stairwell. That feeling of unease growing stronger the closer we got. He went first, running partial way up the stairs shining his light every which way. I started making my way up when I heard him scream as he ran back down jumping into my arms and burying his head in my shoulder.

“Shh, what is it?” I asked frustrated.

“I saw the man. He was peaking over the stairs up there.” He said through his tears.

“No you didn-“ I started to exclaim as I beamed my light up, but he wasn’t lying, at the top of the third floor a pair of bright yellow eyes were staring down at me. I was frozen for a moment. Fear was gripping hard at my chest. My whole body stiffened up as I waited for my flight response to take over. As my body came to, I ran as fast as I could towards the entrance while gripping my brother tight. I set him down and we both began tearing away at the branches to try and escape. But then we heard the loud footsteps of it running down the stairs.

I quickly turned around, flashing my flashlight about to catch a glimpse of whatever just sprinted down the stairs. I saw nothing, I sighed in relief as I turned back around to the entrance ahead of me and I saw him, standing in the corner at the opposite side of the room from the stairwell. He stood at my height, about 6’2”. He was grey and wasn’t wearing any clothes. He had a bald head with large black eyebrows, yellow eyes and a massive smile filled with sharpened narrow teeth. His fingers were long and slender and came to a point, and he just waved at me.

In a panic, I scooped up my brother causing him to drop his flashlight in the chaos, and bolted towards the stairs. He didn’t begin chasing us immediately. I only started hearing his footsteps again once I had fully made it to the second floor. I whipped my flashlight around quickly scanning my environment. But when I looked back to see how close he had gotten I saw nothing but an empty path behind me. As I turned around though I saw him, standing at the end of the hallway, waving. ‘Impossible’ I thought. I was standing way too close to the stairwell for him to have gotten past me without noticing. Especially with how loud his footsteps have been. I began to back into the stairwell to go back down stairs, but as I turned around I heard his footsteps getting louder. I turned around to see how fast he was chasing us but he was gone again. But, when I turned back to begin running down the stairs, there he was, waving, his crooked jagged smile getting wider as drool ran down its face.

I began to run the other way up the stairs, the footsteps echoing in the distance. This time though I didn’t check. I could taste my fear at this point. My chest was was so tight that it felt like an elephant had been sitting on it. As I rounded the corner to the third floor landing I saw him at the top of the stairs, his wave getting more aggressive. I tried turning about face to get away and despite there being no more footsteps, there he was, waving at the bottom of the stairs. When I checked behind me to see if there was in fact two of them I saw that he was no longer there. The panic set in. I knew I was trapped and it seemed like every time I turned to run it got closer and closer to me. 

And then, my fight response kicked in. I decided it was time to confront whatever this is head on. I bolted towards the creature with my flashlight gripped tight above my head. As I swung, however, I felt a thud. I had connected to the creature’s head but I felt like I had just struck myself instead somehow. The pain from the blow caused me to drop my brother and fall down the stairs back down to the second floor.

I panicked at this point, and then I heard the screaming resume above me. I ran back up the stairwell and a new flight of stairs had appeared leading up. I bolted up them without a second thought. I reached the new top floor and just froze.

It was a new hallway that was well manicured. It had a red carpet with an ornate design on it and the walls were a bright red, and there were rooms with doors paned with an opaque glass. Inside there was a lamp illuminating each room so brightly that I could see just the outlines of figures standing about 3’ to 4’ tall and what looked like the outlines of a bed and a chest. There had to be at the least ten or twelve of these rooms and the figures just stood at attention not making any movement. I looked into each and every one of them but none of the figures resembled my brother. Then I heard a pounding behind me and my brother screaming “help”! I shot back around and where the stairwell once stood was another room, this one with my brother banging against the glass. I sprinted towards the room.

“I’ll get you out buddy, don’t worry.” I cried in a panic. His screams for help became muffled and I could see him grab for his mouth as if something was covering it. He pressed his face against the glass and I could see his facial details, he had no mouth anymore. I began to pull on the door more frantically, but then his panic stopped. I looked up and saw my brother standing like the rest of the figures. I stopped yanking the door, I remember this sense of hopelessness came over me. I saw the outline of The Grey Man come from behind my brother and he just waved at me again. Every figure in each of the rooms then proceeded to get in the beds and cover themselves up. I looked around watching each of the figures do this and then I heard a thud come from my brother’s room. The Grey Man was now pressed against the glass and I could see his massive smile in extreme detail and then his hand which just waved as all the lights went out at once.

I was in complete darkness for a moment. I couldn’t see anything. I walked a little ways and saw a glimmer of light on the floor, it was my brother’s flashlight. I was back on the first floor. I picked it up and ran back up the stairs but the flight of stairs leading to that floor was gone. I collapsed and just cried and let out a loud scream.

This alerted a nearby patrol car. As I was making my way out I saw the flashing lights and knew things were getting worse. I was arrested that night on trespassing. However, after I was released my parents pressed charges on my brother’s disappearance blaming me for the incident. I was arrested not long after being released. I was tried on the murder of my brother for the next  four years. I got lucky though I guess. I don’t know if it was the public defender who worked way harder than I expected him to, or maybe one of the jury members believed my story about what live in the boarding house, but I was found not guilty. Despite this though, my parents still believe I murdered him. I haven’t talked to them in a while, it’s been 13 years and I have felt so alone. Not a day goes by that I don’t think of some way to lure that beast out. Someway to get my brother back, someway to prove my innocence. I still have not returned since that night, but soon I will. Soon I will find away to kill that monster and free all of its captives.
