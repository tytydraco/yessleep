It started, I think, about six months ago. I don’t know exactly when because at first, I didn’t notice anything. Maybe I didn’t want to notice. There’s always this stretch of time where everything seems normal until it suddenly doesn’t.

We’d been married for two years by then. Everything was good. She worked from home, freelance design. I had a job at a tech company downtown, one of those places with an open floor plan and no one ever really works, just pretends to. Every night I’d come home to her, and every night there’d be dinner. She loved cooking, experimenting. Sarah was good at it, too—better than most chefs we’d eaten at, and we’d eaten at a lot. I never thought much of it. I just enjoyed the fact that she was always trying something new, and it gave us something to talk about. She’d ask for feedback, little things: “Did you like the herbs in the sauce tonight?” or “Was the lamb too rare?” Nothing unusual. Nothing strange.

Until, I guess, it was.

It began with the way she’d move around the house. The same woman I had been living with for years, but now she felt… distant. Detached. Sarah had always been meticulous, tidy, organized, but she’d started becoming more secretive. Quiet moments where she’d glance at me in a way that made me feel like she was sizing me up. Watching. Sometimes I’d catch her staring at me for a second too long. I’d ask, “What’s wrong?” She’d just smile and say, “Nothing, honey,” and go back to whatever she was doing. Brushing it off as if it were nothing. But I could feel it. The weight in the air. She’d slip into her studio for hours on end, saying she had deadlines. The door was always closed. I didn’t press her on it. I didn’t want to be that kind of husband, you know? Overbearing. Controlling.

I was a fool for that.

Then came the late-night trips to the bathroom. That’s when things shifted from weird to unsettling. She’d get up in the middle of the night, quietly, like she was trying not to wake me. At first, I thought it was a one-off. Everyone has their nights when they can’t sleep, maybe she wasn’t feeling well. But it kept happening. Always the same time, sometime between 2 and 3 a.m. I’d hear her footsteps, the soft creak of the bathroom door opening, then silence. After a while, I’d hear the toilet flush or the faucet run, and she’d slip back into bed, her cold feet brushing against mine.

“What’s going on?” I asked her one night, half asleep, when she crawled back under the covers.

“Just a stomach ache,” she said, brushing it off again.

But every morning after these late-night trips, I’d smell something faint. It wasn’t strong, just the trace of bleach lingering in the air, almost masked but not quite. The first few times, I thought maybe she was cleaning up after herself. Maybe she’d gotten sick. But after a few weeks, the smell became routine, and she didn’t look sick. She looked the same. She acted the same. The bleach, though—it was there every morning. I never asked about it.

I remember the day I started paying more attention to the condoms. I wasn’t suspicious, not at first. It was more like curiosity. We’d agreed early on that we weren’t ready for kids, and she was on birth control, but we still used protection just to be safe. I never questioned it. But one day, as I reached into the drawer to grab one, I noticed something odd. There was a tiny tear near the base. Just a small puncture, barely noticeable unless you really looked. I thought maybe it was a manufacturing defect, but it nagged at me. When I checked the rest of them, I found the same thing. Tiny holes. Small enough to be dismissed, but clearly deliberate if you knew what you were looking for.

I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t. What would I even say? “Hey, honey, are you sabotaging our birth control?” It sounded ridiculous. And yet… I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right. That maybe I wasn’t as careful as I thought.

I don’t know what finally pushed me to go down to the basement that night. Maybe it was all the little things adding up her mood swings, the bleach, the punctured condoms. I’d tried to ignore it, to rationalize it, but some part of me knew something was off. And the more I tried to convince myself otherwise, the more the unease settled deep inside me.

Sarah was asleep next to me, her breath soft and steady, completely unaware of the storm swirling in my head. I waited, lying there in the dark, listening to her breathing, my pulse hammering in my ears. I don’t know what I was hoping to find or maybe I did. Maybe I knew all along, and that was the part I was trying to deny.

When I finally slipped out of bed, the air was thick, oppressive. The house was still, except for the faint hum of the fridge in the kitchen. I padded down the stairs as quietly as I could, every creak of the floorboards making me flinch. I was careful not to turn on the lights, not wanting to wake her. I needed to do this alone.

The basement door was locked. Of course, it was. She never kept it locked before. The key was in the kitchen drawer, right where I’d seen her put it months ago. I don’t know why she thought I wouldn’t notice. Maybe she didn’t care if I did. My hand trembled as I unlocked the door, the brass key cold in my fingers.

The basement smelled different than the rest of the house. Damp, cold, with that faint metallic tinge of bleach. I could barely see anything at first, the single bulb overhead casting just enough light to reveal the concrete floor and shelves lined with dusty boxes. My eyes went straight to the freezer. It sat in the corner, white and unassuming, just like it always had. But now, it felt like the center of the universe, pulling me in.

I stood in front of it for what felt like hours, just staring at it, the cold seeping into my skin. My hand was shaking as I gripped the handle, pulling it open. The cold hit me immediately, a sharp, bitter blast that made me recoil. But it was the smell that really got me. It wasn’t just freezer burn or the mustiness of old food. It was something… off. Something decayed, rotting.

Inside, wrapped in layers of plastic and buried under bags of frozen peas and cuts of beef, were the bundles. Small, tightly wrapped packages, stacked neatly, like she had taken the time to arrange them just right. My heart was pounding in my chest, my stomach twisting in knots as I reached in and pulled one out.

I knew before I even unwrapped it. I don’t know how, but I knew.

The plastic crinkled as I peeled it back, layer after layer, until finally, there it was. Tiny, disfigured, frozen. A fetus. The skin was pale, almost translucent, the limbs underdeveloped, fingers curled in on themselves. I felt bile rise in my throat, but I couldn’t look away. I reached for another bundle, ripping it open with trembling hands. Another one. And another. Five of them in total, all wrapped up, hidden away in the cold.

I staggered back, my head spinning, my stomach lurching. I tried to breathe, but the stench, the overwhelming wrongness of it all, was suffocating. I gagged, collapsing to my knees on the cold concrete floor.

And that’s when it hit me.

The meals.

The rich, strange meals she had been making for weeks, the ones that tasted just a little off. The meat that was softer, somehow, more tender than anything she’d cooked before. I could still taste it in the back of my throat, metallic, lingering. I retched again, my body convulsing, but there was nothing left to come up. Just the horrifying realization of what I had been eating.

I heard her then. Footsteps on the stairs. Slow, deliberate. She was coming down. My heart raced, my mind screaming at me to get up, to run, but I couldn’t move. I couldn’t think. I could hear her humming that soft, haunting tune she always hummed while she cooked. It was getting closer.

The door creaked open, and there she was, standing at the bottom of the stairs, looking at me. She didn’t look angry or surprised. Just tired. Worn out. Like she had been carrying this weight for too long.

"Why did you come down here?” Her voice was soft, barely above a whisper. She wasn’t accusing me, not even upset. Just sad, almost.

I couldn’t speak. My mouth was dry, my throat raw. I just stared at her, my mind racing, my body frozen in place.

She came closer, slowly, like she didn’t want to scare me. She knelt in front of me, her hand reaching out to touch my cheek, and I flinched.

"I didn’t want it to be like this," she said, her eyes filling with tears. "I never meant for you to find out. Not like this."

“Why?” My voice cracked. It was the only word I could get out, the only thing that mattered.

She looked away, her fingers playing nervously with the hem of her sweater. "I couldn’t… I couldn’t keep them," she whispered. "Every time, it just… I thought I could handle it, but after a while, it was too much. I had to get rid of them somehow.”


My stomach turned again, the horror of what she was saying washing over me. “And the food…? You’ve been” I couldn’t even finish the sentence.

Her face crumpled, and for a second, I saw the guilt, the shame she had been hiding. “I didn’t know what else to do,” she said, her voice breaking. “I didn’t mean for it to happen this way. I just… I couldn’t let them go to waste.” 

Then Sarah knelt by the freezer, her hands trembling as she carefully peeled back the plastic. Her breath was shallow, her face pale, but her expression was soft almost tender. She cradled the tiny form in her hands, delicate, as though afraid she might hurt it. Her fingers brushed against the translucent skin of the fetus, frozen and brittle, but she held it as though it were still alive, still breathing.

She rocked it gently, swaying back and forth as she hummed that familiar lullaby under her breath. The tune was broken, shaky, her voice barely a whisper. She looked down at the small, disfigured body, her eyes wet with tears that never quite fell. "Shh," she murmured, her voice catching in her throat. "It’s okay. I’m here. I’m always here."

Her arms tightened slightly around the lifeless form, her body curling over it protectively, like a mother shielding her child. She kissed its forehead, her lips brushing against the cold, blue skin. For a moment, she stayed there, lost in that twisted moment of tenderness, as if holding onto something that had long since slipped away from her.

I recoiled, pulling away from her as the bile rose in my throat again. My mind was reeling, trying to process what she was saying, but it didn’t make any sense. Nothing made sense anymore.

She stood up slowly, wiping the tears from her face. “I’m sorry,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. “I never wanted you to know.”

I couldn’t look at her. I couldn’t look at anything. The room was spinning, my stomach churning, the taste of bile and iron lingering in my mouth. I felt like I was going to be sick again, but there was nothing left.

She turned away, heading for the stairs, silent.

And then she was gone, leaving me alone in the cold, dark basement. Alone with the fetuses. Alone with the horrifying truth that would haunt me for the rest of my life.
I don't now what to do.
