Ice fishing had always been a tradition for us—me, Mark, and Eric. Every January, we’d pack up the gear, pile into Eric’s old truck, and drive out to the frozen lake that sat miles away from the nearest town. The lake was quiet, almost forgotten, but that’s what made it special.

That year, we arrived just as the sun was setting, painting the snow-covered world in shades of orange and pink. The air was bitter cold, sharp enough to bite through the thickest coats. The ice groaned beneath our boots as we walked to our usual spot near the center of the lake.

We drilled our holes, set up the lines, and cracked open a few beers, talking about everything and nothing as the stars blinked into existence. The only sounds were the distant moan of the wind and the occasional creak of the ice shifting beneath us.

It was Mark who first noticed something strange.

“Do you see that?” he asked, pointing out toward the far edge of the lake.

I followed his gaze and saw what he meant. A dark shape, tall and thin, was standing near the tree line. It was too far away to make out any details, but it wasn’t moving.

“Probably just a tree,” Eric said, brushing it off. “Don’t let your imagination get to you.”

But as the hours passed and the moon climbed higher, the shape didn’t go away. Worse, it seemed... closer.

I tried to focus on my fishing line, telling myself it was just a trick of the light, but the unease was impossible to ignore. The temperature seemed to drop even further, the wind carrying whispers that didn’t belong.

Then it happened.

The ice beneath us let out a long, low groan—louder than before. We all froze, staring at each other. Mark’s lantern flickered, its flame sputtering as if gasping for air.

“Did you feel that?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Eric nodded, his face pale. “The ice... it’s thinner here than it should be.”

And then, we heard it. A wet, scraping sound, like nails dragging across the frozen surface.

“Something’s out there,” Mark said, his voice trembling.

The dark shape at the edge of the lake was gone.

Before any of us could say a word, the scraping grew louder, closer. I turned just in time to see a figure rise from the hole in the ice behind Mark. It wasn’t human—not entirely. Its limbs were too long, its eyes too wide, glowing faintly in the dim light.

“Run!” I screamed, but the ice cracked beneath me as I stood.

Mark didn’t move fast enough. The thing lunged, its skeletal hands dragging him into the freezing water. His scream was cut short as the lake swallowed him whole.

Eric and I bolted, the ice groaning and splintering beneath our feet. I didn’t dare look back, not even when I heard the sound of something crawling out of the water, its nails scraping against the ice.

We made it back to the truck, slamming the doors and peeling out of there as fast as Eric’s truck could go.

We never went back to that lake.

Mark’s body was never found.
