So, to preface this, this is going to get lengthy. I don’t know what to tell you, but settle in, because what I have to say here is really weird, and it belongs on this board, in stories that need to be told.

 I live with my father in a secluded part of Arizona, in the far north. Our town is small, and not much happens here, one of those towns where the factory keeps food in everyone’s mouths and roofs over everyone’s heads, where a car crash is the talk of the town for weeks. Nothing much happens here, it just doesn't. Then, well, shit changed.

A Man in a black hazmat suit fell out of the sky into my father’s back yard last week. My dad and I were watching the game when we heard the sickening splat of something hitting the grass in the back yard. Running outside, we quickly looked at the now twitching and soulless mass of broken bones and flesh left sundered in our lawn, and glancing up, saw nothing. The man had no chute, there were no helicopters or planes anywhere close enough for him to have fallen from. I called the police immediately, but my father called the neighbors.

For the next several hours, a team of officers and coroners were steadily, almost unnoticeably,  replaced by government officials, asking us various questions that didn’t seem to have anything to do with the incredible situation that had befallen us. Questions like, “Have you heard any voices?” or “When was the last time you felt hungry?” Were bombarded at us repeatedly, in several different ways, over and over again. From there, the story was given to us that it was an experiment in low gravity gone wrong, such as the ones that NASA preforms; that he had fallen from a plane and died on impact. From there, nobody would discuss it openly, and it just eventually died from hushed whispers into a mutual pact to let it go.

However, I was there, and two things have stopped me from wanting to let it go. First, there was no parachute on the man whatsoever. What kind of low gravity plane experiment would have occurred, in an environment where someone could fall to their death, without having any sort of parachutes? The other was an SSD, as if from a camera or smartphone, that was lying conspicuously close to the corpse.

Late at night, after completely disconnecting my computer from the internet and even wrapping the modem in tinfoil, I booted the SSD. I don’t know if the Government can track the use of an SSD through code on it, but I wasn’t about to take any chances. On the flash drive, I found a series of video and audio logs depicting something I’ve never seen. I imagine that I will get a knock on my door just for posting this, but there’s something insane happening here, and I need you to know what the video depicts in the multiple logs I recovered.

 

**\~Log 1\~**

A boat is bouncing as the camera man is aboard what looks like a speed boat, the screen bathed with the green hue of night vision. The vessel was packed with people and equipment. The camera catching an island, perhaps two, on either side of the boat as it speeds along for a few seconds, then takes a hard right up a river inlet. “Seven, you got it workin?” A man with a rough Texas accent says, turning. A blonde set of eyebrows break over hard eyes, a respirator blocking the mouth and a wetsuit – tight balaclava covering the hair. Seven, the man with the camera, tilts the lens slightly, as if examining the device. A heavy Bronx accent replies, “Yeah, it’s going.”

“Alright. Everyone, get ready. We disembark in numerical order. Tethers on.” The camera man, Seven, reaches down and checks what appears to be a length of wire, Grabbing a carabiner and connecting it to the back of a belt to the man behind him, turning his body and camera to view the end of the boat. The shoreline disappears behind them as they move forward.

“Sorry for the heat, lads, but it gets cooler from here. Hang in there for a 40 minute hike. Remember, respirators on, no names.” The blue eyed man speaks out, his voice recognizable. “Four, lets go over our objectives again, please” Says someone else, barely audible over the roar of the engine. (I had to listen to the audio log multiple times to ensure that this is correct.)

Four, Hard Eyes, clears his throat. “We’re here to –“

 

 

The camera is turned off, then on, as several people make their way through an incredibly thick forest. Various animal cries sound as the camera records the heads of people in front of the camera man. The familiar voice of Four pipes up.

“Hold up!”

The column of people cease moving and turn in place, the camera catching several of their tethers, slack causing them to swing slightly with the movement. Seven zooms in on Four to capture the speech.

“Before we move forward, it’s important that I remind you of the safety rules and regulations here. Take a knee, take your packs off.”

Four pauses as the group takes their packs off, settling on them. A few pull a hose from their packs and attach it to their respirators, apparently able to drink through the filter.

“Now, rule number one. Never use a name. If anyone calls you a name, even if its incorrect, say so immediately to me, or if I do so, to Ten. If anyone we meet introduces their self to you by name, you open fire immediately. At this point, please take out your rifles.”

The group opens the top pouch of their bags and take out what appears to be some sort of vest filled with rifle magazines and begin donning them. They then dig out M4 style rifles, put a mag into the chamber, and cock them. The whole process takes approximately 30 seconds before the last *click-clack* of a mag being inserted is heard. It’s very obvious this has been practiced.

“Now, you are to remain in weapons red until we leave. Don’t fire unless you’re sure something is a threat, or if rule one is broken. Understood?”

A various assortment of positive answers come up, from a militaristic “YES SIR” from a few, to a much calmer “Understood” from a couple. One just says “Yup.”

“Excellent. Now, rule 2. We enter one at a time. You have 50 feet of tether on you. You don’t begin moving through the Gate until you feel it tug you forward. Ladies and gentlemen, when you feel the tug of the person behind you, do NOT cease. Never cease moving until you can see the sky. You don’t want to know what happens if you do.”

“Rule 3. Once we reach base camp in 2 days, you will don your MOP suit. You will give a status report according to the challenge and response once per hour. You will not go ANYWHERE alone. You will not pee alone, you will not sleep alone, you will not cry alone. NOTHING is done alone.”

“Finally, there’s a special set of rules once we get through Base Camp. These will be briefed afterwards. ALRIGHT, this is the breaking point. Last chance to turn back.”

 

No one speaks up. Four cocks his rifle.

“Lets pick it up.”

**\~Log 2\~**

(Foreward) I need to preface this. I’m not a botanist. Maybe I’m completely off the mark on my explanation for the first part of this, I don’t know. I went back and tried to re-write what I wrote for the intro, trying to describe things better. Let me know if anyone has seen anything like this?

 

The camera switches on. Four and and another man are sitting on a rock. They are tilting a canteen into the air over the gas masks that they are wearing. The movement in their throat reveals that they’re drinking, while a third man walks around with a strange machine in his hand. The vegetation looks… Off. The camera is now in full color, natural light is apparently a thing. Green and black stalks stick up out of the ground, With flowers sticking out of them like corn stalks usually do. One of them shifts like it’s blowing in the wind, then settles back. None of the surrounding plants move.

“Two, you got it calibrated yet?” Four grunts, muffled through the mask. Two looks around, then looks down. “Yeah, it’s breathable.” Two speaks in a higher pitched voice. Four pulls off his mask. Blue eyes and blonde hair dampened with sweat come out from under the hood of the wetsuit. “Alright. Pass it off to One. If the alarm goes off, masks on, 30 seconds or less gentlemen.”

Two pulls off his mask as well, black hair and dark eyes with heavy Italian features appearing. “Ay, got it Four.” Some scuffling noises happen to the right, and the camera pans over to see a man getting up off the gray soil, their back completely powdered in the color. He rips off his mask, coughing. “Fuck, I gotta quit smoking.” Seven chuckles slightly as the man, black hair and soft features, walks over and grabs the device, strapping it to their chest, on what appears now in the light to be a bullet proof vest of some sort.

“Seems like a bad time One.” The man next to Four says, putting a stopper in the top of their canteen and taking their mask off slowly. Longer brown hair and a short beard peek out of the sides of his wet suit side, which he takes off to reveal the hair is almost shoulder length. He pulls out a band and ties it up. “Alright, que up, gentlemen. Seven’s going to go through the questions with you.”

Each man approaches Seven, who then takes his time asking them a series of questions, some of which are familiar. “Have you heard any voices today?” and “When was the last time you felt hungry” are part of the initial questionnaire, then followed by stranger questions. “A man on the subway drops a $100 bill. What do you do?” is one of them. One goes first, then two, so over time each person is assigned a place in line. Seven is skipped, then after Ten goes, the camera is handed over to him, giving us our look at Seven. All of the same questions are asked, but I care about his answers, focused entirely on every word he speaks. as I’m now incredibly interested.

It’s him, the man from the sky.

After the interview, Seven takes the camera, some sort of go pro from the way its handled, and sets it on a rock a decent way away from the rest of the group. He sits in front of it on the soil.

“Day one, research log. Don’t know if I can rightly call it that, as only Three and myself are researchers of any sort, chosen for our military background and existing clearances. Ca- ahem. Three and I are here to collect nebulous data, and we aren’t allowed to start until we reach ‘base camp’ tomorrow. I have to say, this shit is… Wild. I’m a geologist, and the gray dirt here is like sand, it’s entirely nutrient deprived, but I mean, look at this.”

The camera pans around as Seven lifts it, showing an entire field of the strange green and black stalks, standing higher than a man, as Four is walking around camp and talking to people. The stalks grow thick, almost like a forest, with the ten men being set up in some sort of naturally occurring clearing.

“It’s thick like a field of wheat. It shouldn’t be possible. I already scooped up some soil samples as soon as we stopped for the day.”

Seven sets the camera back down after a long pan across the field, then takes his seat again.

“I am fascinated to break out the kits and look into this.”

A large burst of static occurs and Seven is knocked over from a seeming explosion.

“What in the ACTUAL FU-“ A voice screams, as Seven shuts off the camera.

 

**\~Log 3\~**

The camera comes back on as Seven is seen covered in the gray dust. This appears to be a few minutes later. He shakily speaks as he gets back on.

“Uh…I…Six is dead.”

He sits there, dead eyed, looking at the ground beneath him in shifty glances.

“He tried to light a fire and just exploded. Just… Parts everywhere. I’ve never had to do emergency Geology before.”

He holds up a vial of liquid with a strange chunk inside of it.

“Its… Its pure Nitrates. Almost lab quality. 93% from the tests I did. All of the ground is pure Nitrate. We are lucky all of us weren’t wiped out.”

He takes a deep breath, then sighs.

“I need to start from the beginning. I’m here as a geologist. A while ago, some island off the East coast of America was established as a research base for monkeys. Then something weird opened up on it. Access was cut off to the public under the guise of using the monkey population for controlled research and experiments, and nobody batted an eye. But this hole opened up. A hole that just… Isn’t a hole.”

Seven sighs.

“I guess if you’re watching this, you know that. How it looks. How it doesn’t look, more accurately. Some idiot jumped in and said there was a whole ‘nother world in there. That’s all I know. Ever since then, the Governments been sendin’ people in. We’re up now. Third expedition, huzzah.”

He rubs his eyes.

“The crossing hurts. That’s my scientific evaluation.” He chuckles to himself. “It feels like your whole body is being mashed like a bowl of potatoes on Thanksgiving, and you forgot it’s Thursday. Your relatives are arriving in half an hour.”

He sighs, looking up.

“The sun doesn’t set. There isn’t any sun here. Look.”

He grabs the camera and points it at the sky. As the horizon stretches before the camera for the first time since the recording began, we are treated with a beige skyline. No visible point of light illuminates anything, it’s as if the sky itself is glowing constantly. The sky softly pulses darker then brighter again, at a very slow rate, like an LED light in a gaming mouse.

“I don’t know where we are, but this isn’t good. I was told it was dangerous. I was promised a hell of a lot of money for 1 months’ worth of work. I don’t know if it’s worth it anymore. But only Four knows the way out.”

He laughs. “Guess I’m lost up the Northwest Passage here. What I find in here could change humanity for the better. Its’ why I’m still here. Seven, signing off.”
