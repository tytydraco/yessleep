In the Attic

This happened when I was around 9 or 10. I was staying the night at my friend Catherine's for the first time, we met the summer before and were inseparable ever since. Cat lived in this old two story house, surrounded by woods and dirt road. The house itself gave me an uneasy feeling when I first seen it; The shutters were falling off, the paint on the house seemed to be fading. It was an old piece of shit, now that I think about it. But at the time, I was excited.

I remember walking in after I stared at the house, for what seemed like 20 minutes. Surprisingly the inside was alot nicer than the outside, so I pushed that uneasy feeling down and just shrugged it off as nerves. I remember the smell of the house, I can't pinpoint it but it was different, like walking into a musty room. I started to walk around, just to explore my surroundings but noticed cats mom watching me. I simply smiled and waved but she just stood there, starring at me wide-eyed. I've never met her before, but why was she starring at me like that? Suddenly, cat flew around the corner and tackled me. We both fell and started to giggle, I noticed cats mom out of the corner of my eye, start to turn around and walk off. She was gone, just like that. 

Fast forward a couple hours, Cat and I are laying on a bean bag in her room watching Children Of The Corn. Which, by the way, was one of my favorite movies at the time. I grew up watching horror movies, mostly Stephen King movies or any movie my mom was watching at the time. Not her decision, mine because I love the feeling that a good horror movie gives you. She felt the same way and thats why we clicked so much. Back to the story, we were sitting here watching this movie and suddenly the door opposite us slams closed. We both jumped, giggled and brushed it off because well, we were kids. Until the second time, when it creaked open and slammed again, not even seconds after the first time. Now, I'm sitting there starring at this door, trying to figure out how in the hell is this door opening and closing by itself. In the midst of all that, the only other person in this house is her mom. Which I figured out earlier, was just a tad bit creepy. 

"You think it's just your mom?" I asked her. But she just shook her head. "You sure?" I asked again but she said something that gave me chills then and still gives me chills just telling this story. "My mom isn't home, its just me and you silly." I just stare at her while she's starring at me, trying to wrap my head around what she just said. Who leaves their 9 year old, home alone, with a friend, in a two story house? "Where is your mom?" I asked her. "She's at work." I giggled, thinking she was just trying to trick me. "She is at work! She only works for a couple hours so she leaves me here because she trusts me!" At this point, I'm just looking at her and she noticed this look of worry on my face. "What's wrong?" She asked. "If your mom is at work, then who was that lady staring at me earlier?" As I said this, we heard what seemed like footsteps at the time. But thinking about it now, it sounded like shuffling in one spot, above us. 

I'm completely scared at this point, every hair on my neck is standing out and I just want to leave. I start to get up when Cat pulled me back down and asked me if I heard that noise. I nodded. It was silent again, until the footsteps were back but louder and faster. We both stared up at the ceiling and she grabbed my hand. "This happens every day." She whispered. I look over at her and can truly see the fear on her face. The footsteps stopped and she looked at me, her face flushed white. "Is there an attic?" I asked, she pointed up towards the ceiling. Well, maybe it's just squirrels or birds, I kept thinking over and over. You ever notice when you're really quiet? That's when you can hear almost everything around you. Imagine if you're sitting in a house, with your best friend, alone at 10 years old and you hear the giggle of a 3 year old child. Mind you, she has no younger brothers or sisters. We are completely alone. 

Cat was just as scared as I was, I remember thinking that I just wanted to get out of this house. Just grab her and run out the door, at least we would feel safer and less scared outside the house than we would in. "Wanna hear a story?" Cat asked, pulling my mind back in reality. I nodded. "Well, this house use to be a daycare. There was this lady that would watch the kids and one day she just locked them in the attic and then hung herself from a rope in the kitchen. They all died because the kids were hungry and thirsty and no one found them for months afterwards. In this house." My heart started to pound, my eyes wide with fear and I just looked at her. "Its true." She said, "I've seen them. The little kids. Everyday. But I've never seen the lady, but you have. Earlier."

After she told me this, I don't remember much else but running out the door of her room and making it outside the house. Cat followed, begging me to stay but I just had to get out. My stomach felt like knots. I felt as if I walked in a horror movie myself and just wished this day had never happened. 

Fast forward years later. That day was the last day I had seen or heard from Cat. I remember her always coming to play outside at my dads during the day, I remember what she looked like. I never remembered meeting her parents or seeing them out in public. I'm now 27 and I can't seem to find any proof that she exsits. All my friends that I was friends with then, I'm still friends with now even after all these years. But why not her? I've drove by that house maybe 15 times and still wonder if maybe, she was just one of the ones that never made it out.
