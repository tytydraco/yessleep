Here is the rest of the story about my dad, I’ll write more about what’s happened since yesterday at the end.

“A painful crack to the side woke me. I shot up, shaking in fear. Instead of some tall, gangly creature, it was just a decrepit old man. 

“Did you go outside?” He barked. I held out my hands and shook my head.

“No.”

“You lie. You think I’m stupid?” He pointed toward my boots and the puddle of water. My body seized up. What do I say for myself? What could I say to begin to save the situation?

“I…”

“Stand up.” He demanded. I couldn’t. My legs were jelly, still asleep from resting on the solid ground. He nudged me, and I struggled to rise to my feet. He backed away, cane threatening to whack me. A storm went on in the pits of my belly. Hunger pains encapsulated my body as I held it tight.

“Show me. Show me your leg.” His voice trembled. I opened my mouth to speak, but he screamed over me.

“Show me your leg!”

I quickly bent down and pulled up my right pant leg. I nearly vomited from the quick movement. He shook his head as Yakut obscenities escaped his mouth. He looked to the side and lowered his gaze. I stared at the wound and recoiled. Obsidian veins bulged, and I could see my own heartbeat pulse through them. The once festering laceration was gone, leaving no evidence behind. 

I slowly raised my head and locked eyes with the old man. He bit his bottom lip, and a vein bulged on his forehead.  I inched toward the door, and the closer I got to him, the more fearful he became. His hand wavered from side to side, and the thumping noise in my ear sped up. It’s pounding overwhelmed me enough to make my breath shallow and inconsistent. 

“Please,” I stepped toward him, but he backed up.

“Stay away.” He said through gritted teeth. I winced in pain, hoping he wouldn’t get any closer. The thumping drowned any other noise in the room. It made my mouth dry and my stomach turn. We locked eyes. His stare was wild. I could smell the fear coming off of him, the adrenaline dumping all over the room. His sweat smelled of salt and a year's worth of meat.  I bit my lip and shook my head.

“I’ll go,” I whispered.

“I can’t let you leave.” He struggled to get out. The bulging vein on his forehead pulsed with the thumping sound in my ears. Did I have it in me to leave? Did I have it in me to even stay? 

“Once you decide to live in a world of ice, you cannot leave it.” Viktor managed to spit out, his voice weak and lacking breath support.

“I… don’t…” The hunger in my stomach was hard to ignore. It made standing difficult, and it was impossible not to think of the world I had once experienced. The thumping was there, but quiet as tensions slowed.

“You know you can’t leave.” He backed away from me, his gaze wary. 

“I can’t…” I couldn’t think. My brain was occupied with thoughts of meat, flesh, desire, lust, anxiety, death, and pain.

“What…” My head drooped as I bit my lip and grimaced in pain.

“You are succumbing to the urges. That thing. It’s doing it to you. The locals know of it. They know its duties. I didn’t. I didn’t know, like you.” I looked up and we locked eyes. Why had no one told me?

 I leaned over and gripped my stomach in pain. A cry escaped my lips. Viktor quickly hobbled toward an ice chest and opened it. I watched with wide eyes as he pulled something out. 

I could smell it. From several feet away, I could smell the frozen meat. Iron, freezer-burnt, metallic. My eyes stopped on the chunk, and I salivated. Viktor threw it to the floor, and with a loud clunk, it fell. The meat skirted across the hardwood and stopped in front of me.

I bent down, crouched in front of it. I looked up at Viktor, asking permission with my with my eyes .

“Go ahead. You must stop the hunger before it calls you outside.” Viktor was soft with me, treating me as a disobedient pet. A pet that needed to learn, didn’t know better, and was just born into this world. I grabbed the meat and licked at it. Frozen solid. It felt so good in my hands. It sent shockwaves of ice over my tongue and made me choke in pleasure. 

“I don’t know if you can come back from this.” I heard him whisper, a quiet cloud of solace resting over him. I pulled back from the meat and sat on my knees. Waves of awareness rushed over me, and I felt deep pangs of shame in my belly. I looked at my hands and up at Viktor. Somehow, I hadn’t heard him cross the room. He stood over me, a look of pity on his face. 

“What’s happening to me?” I whispered, tears forming in the corner of my eyes. A slick film of juice covered my hands as the flesh thawed from my desperate licking.

“It marked you and me. The mark of the devil.” He refused to look me in the eye.

“Why…”

“I do not know. We are called to serve. But not without a price.” I crawled forward, resting my head on his tattered old shoes.

“Please… help me…” I begged, as tears cascaded down my cheeks and washed his feet.

“I don’t think I can.” There it was, that look of pity. I looked up. A blade made of silver stared at me. Quickly, I fell to my backside and tried to scramble away.

“I have to.” He reasoned. For once, the usual look of scorn he wore was one of despondency. He hobbled toward me, cane in hand. I shook my head, tears still decorating my cheeks.

“No… No please. I’ll do anything.” He refused my pleas. I held out a hand, knife plunging deep into my flesh. A scream escaped my mouth as the point stared at me through layers of flesh, tendons, blood, and bone. I pulled away and kicked at the man's legs. He fell to the ground with a thud, a labored cry escaping his haggard body. I stared at the knife, pain burning through my hand and radiating up my arm. The old man looked at me with frantic eyes as he hurriedly shook his head.

“No.” He begged. I stood on shaky legs, still staring at the new appendage in astonishment. I ripped the knife out of my hand with a squish as blood spurted onto the floor. I felt my vision momentarily go black as a new wound stared at me.

“You can’t leave!” The old man screamed. Every time he tried to stand, he winced in pain. 

“I have to,” I whispered. The door opened behind me, and I fell onto the hard, icy snow. The old man wailed and clamored to shut the door. I kicked it closed with my foot, and the light from inside disappeared. I was left in the black of the night, shrouded in darkness. The door pounded in fury as I imagined the old man thrusting a fist into the wood. I scooted away, relishing in the ice that soothed my throbbing hand. Blood decorated the paper white snow, leaving a haphazard trail from where I fell.

 I was wounded, shoeless, without a coat, without gloves, and without anything that could serve as protection against the brutal cold. I looked at my hand once more, ready to throw up at the sight of ligaments, muscle, and bone escaping the puncture wound. What stared back at me was an uninjured hand with smooth, fresh skin. My stomach turned in fear as I went on hands and knees. I looked back at the door with wide eyes, thinking I should go back. I should not have been out there. What was happening… it wasn’t natural.
I crawled on my hands and knees away from the door. The wind brought flakes of ice that cut all of my exposed skin. I didn’t hiss in pain or cry out in discomfort. I didn’t feel the frostbite setting in the tips of my fingers or the snow freezing the fronts of my legs. Really, I didn’t feel anything at all. 

The old man’s cries penetrated the wood, and I wondered if he mourned me. Was he crying out for another life that would be lost to the forest for eternity? Snow crushed underneath my calloused palms and melted. My pants were wet and resisted freezing. Ahead of me was whirling flakes of snow and fallen trees. Stripped bushes that were home to nothing but piles of bones and frost. The night ate everything whole and made sure no noise would escape its void. I crawled forward more.

The world outside those walls was not filled with never-ending food or promised happiness. There was no Kate, no Rosie, no mom or dad. There was nothing but miles of forgotten land and a thick, towering fir tree. I crawled to it, knowing that it would be my resting place. Someone would surely find me like I found that statuesque wolf. Would a snarl be immortalized on my face?

I crawled to the other side of the tree and rested my back against the trunk. I let out a soft sigh and watched as my breath danced around me. Outstretched in front of me were miles of snow and a world I could not see. 

Why did I stop? I could have gotten up I could have tried walking to the village. 

I didn’t want to. I didn’t feel the need to. There was no point. My purpose was to sit in front of that tree. The hunger I felt so irrevocably in the cabin no longer festered. The cold had completely evaporated any urge or desire to eat. Where had it gone?

A familiar cry rang through the tundra and echoed through the night. Rather than fear settling in my bones, a desire encompassed me. I screamed back. Loud and full of emotion. My voice gave out, and my throat felt wet with blood and mucus. A piercing wail travelled over the ground into my ears in response. Its uncanny cries and grunts felt warm. A reminder that I was not alone.

I let out another scream. I tried imitating the animal, in hopes of bringing that same warmth to my body. My eyes closed as we screamed in unison. We wailed together, and our laments drowned out the roaring winds. Our tortured bugle call was one of triumph. 

The smell of rainy days and fresh spring air cocooned my shaking body.

I opened my eyes, and what I saw was not an empty field of whirring snow. There were no paper rolling hills. Something crouched in front of me. On all fours, an ‘animal’ stood still. No longer did it cry; it watched me. Standing nearly the height of an immature tree, its steamy breath tickled my cheeks, bringing a comfortable warmth to my body. 

Tight pale skin stretched over its muscular legs. Oil slick veins colored its flesh and crawled up its body. It had hooves- no paws that were the size of two adult men’s feet. A light dusting of muted fur adorned the entirety of the creature. At first, I didn’t recognize that we locked eyes. Its irises were clouded, the color of fresh cotton. The creature's eyes melted perfectly into its canine-shaped skull. It looked down at my leg and back into my eyes. 

Large tufts of white fur decorated the neck of the being. Dusty rose lips hid its sharp bone-ash teeth. Saliva dripped down its mouth and then froze immediately. A large rack sat atop its head, burnt and cracked. It told stories of torturous millennia that had been endured by the creature. 

It reared, lifted its head into the sky, and let out another cry. My head split from its agonizing shriek. I planted my hands over my ears and shrank into myself. It screamed again. A sharp sickle of pain stabbed behind my eyes. I waited for the creature to take me. For God to take me. Had I prayed wrong? Was this what I brought upon myself?

The being stood, screaming into the inky night.
I sank into the ice beneath me and lowered my head. Grunts escaped my mouth as tears tried to slide down my face. Above, I heard the consoling snorts of the animal, watching me writhe in pain. My legs were stretched beyond imagination. With each passing second, I felt my joints dislocate with a loud pop. My arms were broken, reset, and broken again. I cried out, hoping it would ease the gut-wrenching pain. The creature imitated me; its voice loud and haunting. 

I fell to my back, feeling my body convulse and my eyes roll back. A sky full of stars that burst into millions of colors stared back at me, like nothing I’d seen before. The moon illuminated the tundra and shone onto my broken body. The creature's loose skin hung over me, fur caressing my frosty skin. Its paws stood on either side of me, as it nudged me to stand.

I obliged and stood on several shaky newborn legs. The world around me came to life as I heard thoughts of God, acts of love, the melting of snow, and the congratulations from the cosmos above. The creature stared at me, and we spoke through our eyes alone and nothing more. A new life where I would be moon drunk, but no longer blood lust.

At times, I think of the world inside, and I miss it. The warmth of a fire, the kiss of my love, the laugh of my child. Words spoken to one another, not thought. It is something I think of daily. Babies being held for the first time, friends seeing each other after years have passed, siblings staying up too late together. Such fleeting moments with such powerful emotions. They are memories that I visit from time to time. Moments I no longer get to experience for myself, but I do watch between others every now and then. The feelings never fade, but the details do muddy. I cannot be sad, I chose the life constrained by no doors. Forever, we will guard this land. 

I will watch over Oymyakon’s hungry men.”

I’ve read this story, over and over again, probably ten times since last night. For the life of me, I can’t make any sense of what’s real or not.

This morning, a man stopped by my house. He didn’t knock, just stood idly at my front door. I watched him through my ring camera, as he swayed from side to side. He looked harmless, just an elderly man. A part of me wonders if it could have been ‘Viktor’ from the story. 

I’ve gotta tell myself it’s not, because that would make this story a little more than a farce. I thought about calling the cops, but I don’t know if they could even do anything. It’s not like I’m being threatened or harassed, it’s just macabre fan fiction at this point.

The more I read the story the more confused I get. I wish I knew what the point of it was. If the old guy stops by again, I may end up talking to him. Like I said, he seemed harmless, and could barely hold himself up as it was. Maybe I could get a little context on why I am the new owner of this folktale. 

I’ll probably ask mom what dad was researching. Knowing if he had actually went to Oymyakon might help me understand this more. 

Sorry, I’ll update later, someone’s knocking at my door.
