Usually, it's safe to assume that something has happened to someone when they haven't posted an update in over half a month. You would think they are dead by now. However, this time, you would be wrong. [I found out I had a stalker through a TikTok Live](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/148z9ye/i_found_out_i_have_a_stalker_through_tiktok_live/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2) stream, and he managed to enter my house. Fortunately, I escaped through the backdoor. Here's what unfolded after that terrifying incident.
I felt a chill crawl up my spine, my heart pounding against my chest. The realization that he was already inside hit me like a ton of bricks. He must have picked the lock. Without a second thought, I dashed towards the backdoor, propelled by a primal instinct to escape.

Once I was outside and at a safe distance from my house, I hastily dialed the emergency hotline, recounting the chilling events and pleading for immediate help. However, the response I received was far from reassuring. The operator seemed indifferent, having been through this ordeal before. They seemed skeptical and reluctant to act solely based on a screen recording of a TikTok live, and my backdoor being open their dismissive tone left me feeling helpless and abandoned when I hung up the phone. 

As I looked towards my house, I saw the shadow of someone walking through my kitchen towards my backdoor, confirming my worst fears. Realizing that I couldn't rely on the authorities, I made a split-second decision. I had to take matters into my own hands. The adrenaline coursing through my veins numbed the pain of the branches scratching at my skin as I sprinted into the darkness of the forest.

Every fiber of my being focused on one thing: survival. The sound of my own labored breath filled my ears, matching the rhythm of my pounding footsteps. Branches whipped against my skin, leaving angry red marks in their wake. Fear propelled me forward, zigzagging through the maze of trees.

Every rustle, every crack of a twig sent shivers down my spine, fueling me to run faster. The darkness swallowed me whole, with the moonlight only offering glimpses of the treacherous terrain ahead. But I couldn't afford to stumble or hesitate—I had to keep moving, to outrun the clutches of my relentless pursuer.

As I raced deeper into the woods, the sense of isolation intensified. There was no one to hear my cries, no one to come to my aid. The forest seemed to stretch on endlessly, an unyielding labyrinth designed to ensnare its prey. Yet, I pushed myself to the limits, driven by sheer willpower and the desperate hope of eluding my stalker.

The forest floor gave way to a steep incline, and my tired legs strained to maintain their pace. I stumbled, my body crashing to the ground, pain shooting through every limb. But I couldn't afford to stay down—I had to keep going.

Blood trickled from my grazed knees and palms, marking my path with crimson. I fought through the pain, the fear gripping me tighter with each passing second.

With every ounce of energy left in me, I surged forward, my determination overriding the fatigue that threatened to consume me.

After what felt like an eternity, my lungs burning for air, I collapsed beneath a tree, believing I had finally reached a safe distance. Silence enveloped the surroundings, and I took a moment to catch my breath. My curiosity got the better of me. I peered at my phone, and the livestream showed the man emerging from my house, a full ten minutes behind real-time. The comments accompanying the livestream were filled with disturbing messages, with people urging the man to harm me, flooding the chat with knife emojis, and even sending virtual gifts encouraging him to kill me. These viewers were sick in the head,

 reveling in my suffering, finding entertainment in my torment.

A snap of a twig shattered the silence, jolting me back to the present moment. The stalker was near. Instinctively, I rose to my feet, my gaze fixated on the approaching figure. In his hand, a phone with the flash on, capturing his every move for the livestream. Panic surged through my veins, propelling me into motion once again. But fate had other plans, as I tripped over a tree root and tumbled down a treacherous hill, my head colliding with unforgiving rocks.

In that disorienting moment, I noticed my phone had been flung from my grasp, landing on the rocks and then falling into the shallow water of the brook. I struggled to focus, blinking rapidly as my vision cleared. And there he was, the stalker, looming over my phone, with the TikTok livestream still running. When he bent down to reach for my phone, I realized I had an opportunity that I probably wouldn't get again. So, I stood up, my head throbbing, and picked up a sizable rock nearby. Without hesitation, I swung it with all my might, striking the stalker squarely in the back of his head. He tumbled forward, falling face-first into the brook, his body motionless.

My hands trembled as I dropped the blood-stained rock, my mind struggling to comprehend the magnitude of what I had just done. But I had to. It was him or me, life or death, and I chose life.

To my surprise, the stalker's phone had miraculously landed on a rock and remained out of the water. It was still live on TikTok. I picked up the phone and pointed it at the motionless figure floating in the brook, exposing what I had done to the viewers. The comments section exploded with W's, devil emojis, and demands for more.

An unsettling realization dawned on me—I had become the new livestream host. The viewers craved violence, thrived on fear, and I had inadvertently become their new twisted entertainer by giving that to them. They loved me, and I loved the attention.

I know it's been a while since I last updated you all, but I've been adjusting to my newfound position. If you're ever scrolling through TikTok late at night and come across a livestream of a man walking through the woods, I hope you'll join me. We'll be selecting a new target very soon. Who knows, it could even be you.
