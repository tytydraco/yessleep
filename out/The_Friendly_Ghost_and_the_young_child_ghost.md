A thumb across my stomach as I'm trying to fall asleep or the sensation that someone is sitting on the edge of my bed would always end with me keeping my eyes closed until I fell asleep.  I dare not open them for fear of what I might see.  

I was never sure if these were hallucinations or real until the night before I asked her to leave.

Several years ago, I was dreaming that someone had grabbed my foot and was pulling me under water of a lake. The shock of being underwater and not able to breathe made me wake suddenly. I pulled off my Cpap mask, got out of bed and went outside to smoke. The sensation of my foot being squeezed remained from the time I woke to the time I finished my cigarette. It was not
imaginary.

I had a feeling our condo building was haunted by a woman since my neighbor had seen her on multiple occasions.  This, was my first believable  encounter with her.  I couldn't deny it anymore.
She was real.   

My guess is she saw me struggling to breathe with my Cpap, and felt the need to wake me, thus squeezing my foot. I looked at her as a nice ghost, not meaning any harm, but also not able to leave earth. So sad.

The next day, I felt that I knew who she was, and so I looked up a news story on KSL from a couple years back.  A young woman had a medical emergency and died in a head on collision close to my condo.  I wasn't sure if my Ghost was her or not, but I went home with this information and calling her by name said, "I'm sorry, but
could you please leave. I'm afraid of ghosts."

Although she still appeared to my neighbor on occasion,  she must have left my unit, because I haven't experienced anything since.

I felt like a jerk then,  for asking her to leave and still now as I write this. She never meant any harm, with evidence that she was the total opposite, so that feeling of being the unwelcoming host really bothers me to this day.

A second time that I was convinced that ghosts really exist was the time my rental car was haunted by a child.

Before getting my car, another customer complained that her car smelled like puke. The customer was in the process of getting a different car when keys were handed to me.   There didn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary with mine until I was a few minutes from home.

With the radio down to an inaudible level and the windows rolled up, my mind wandered, until I heard a little girl humming.   Thinking it came from the radio, I turned it up and it was a talk show.   There was no way the humming came from there.  It was a little girl, not an adult humming.  

Seconds after I heard her humming, the car filled with the smell of vomit.   I rolled down my window and the smell disappeared.  

I sensed that a child had either passed in this car, or had passed in another car and was going from vehicle to vehicle in search of her parents.   

I felt sorry for this little girl and told her she needs to move on and go toward the light.  Although that was the best option for her, I hoped to hear her again, if only to confirm that what I heard and smelt was real.   

Of the two days I had the car, that first encounter was my only encounter.
