THE DEAD MUST BE BLIND! Is the one rule I have to follow since I’ve began working here at this morgue on the edge of town. It’s sort of run down place, the type that can be accused for an abandoned building at sight, and smell, but many men of brave heart think twice when they see fluorescent lights on and me whistling along to Taylor swift. It’s a peaceful job, never any shitty coworkers being a drain to exist in the same space in for 8 hours and the boss never around. 

Hehe, she’s a mysterious woman only time time we interact is her leaving an envelope with my paycheque under the mat to the front door mat. To my knowledge she hasn’t even stepped into the building in her entire life. Probably squeamish around all the dead bodies. 

I’ve gotten used to them, my pa always used to take me hunting from when I could stand on my own two feet,  and when I was 11 he taught me how to skin them. Pa always said “ripping through a defeated animal’s corpse as our ancestors before us did would make you a man”. I’m not sure if he was ever right about that but it’s made me handy with a blade and completely numb to gore in its entirety. 

It is a skill that makes the job easier. All I have to do is hold their eyelids open with one hand while I slide a sharpened spoon in with another. Then I saw through the nerves and scoop them out into a black garbage bag that’s thrown into the chute that connects right to garage bin. Luckily I don’t have to lug around a big bag of eyes every day in broad daylight. I’ll probably be seen as some madman satan worshiper.

Now the only real issues is how to avoid all the families reporting that there dear loved ones have no eyes. That’s why there’s somehow always a orange bag filled with glass eyes, by far no one has ever noticed that there eyes now mysteriously have a glossy sheen on them yet and if it did happen that’s probably 20 years to life for me.

The other reason is that local gossip passes around that this place is haunted by some nun who killed a pregnant mother in the basement about 130 years ago and decided to burn the place down with her literally. Now occasionally some teenagers break in through the front door which by the way has no lock in it. I swear she and her family never have made one single touch to the building since its construction.

Now the supposed spirts that haunt the place never once appeared to me ever and if they did Jesus watches over the room, up high, nailed to both cross and wall. I wonder if he’s actually there sometimes or it’s some lump of wood that only exists to keep the mind at peace. I will never truly know.

And that’s the end of my shift, donny signing out.
