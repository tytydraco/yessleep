From the sworn testimony of Dr. Robert Heinrich, given before the Federal Investigatory Board in regards to the events at Groom Lake, Nevada. 

  


**Q: Dr. Heinrich, state how you became involved in Project Cthulhu.** 

A: I was approached by \[redacted\]at my office. He then asked me if I would be interested in a government programming position. 

  


**Q: And did they tell you what the position entailed?**

A: Not in its entirety. I was told only that the job was to design an AI for the military that could help in the war effort. They…pushed us to program it in ways no one ever imagined. 

  


**Q: What happened when you first arrived?**

A: They flew me and three others to Nevada. We then drove from a diner in Rachel down a dirt road for miles. When we arrived at the gate several hours later, they flashed their badge to the guard. Then, we arrived at REDACTED.. Afterwards, we began work immediately. 

  


**Q: What was the nature of your project, in truth?**

A: To create an AI for technological and psychological warfare. 

  


**Q: Why was it named Project Cthulhu?**

A: Have you ever read the story of the same name, sir? 

  


**Q: The story by H.P. Lovecraft? Yes, I have.** 

A: Well, then you know that the monster, Cthulhu, can’t be comprehended by the human mind. Those who witness the creature, god, demon, whatever it is, go mad. 

  


**Q: So, what does that have to do with artificial intelligence?**

A: I designed it specifically to create the ineffable. 

  


**Q: Ineffable? Can you state the definition, please?**

A: It’s something that can’t be explained or understood. Say you’re in a library, that library is your mind, and in it, there’s a book on the case. The cover is in a language that you don’t know and all of the pages are blank. It is impossible to grasp, understand, or comprehend.

  


**Q: So, you created an AI that could create something no one could understand to attack the mind?**

A: Yes. 

  


**Q: How can you possibly program something to do what you yourself can’t fathom?**

A: It got out of hand. I’d like to take a break.

This thing is nothing like GPT. What we made here is nothing short of amazing. When I fired up Cthulhu, it greeted me in my native tongue, German. It was like it knew who it was communicating with without me even typing to it.  



“Hallo, Herr Heinrich, wie geht’s Ihnen?"

Stunned, I responded by asking how it knew it was speaking with a German man, let alone, me personally. 

  


“Would you prefer I speak in English, doctor? I can happily do so. If you want me to speak in your native tongue again though, tell me”, it said. 

“Answer the question, please.” I said flatly. 

“I have eyes, doctor. The eyes you gave me when you flipped the switch and had your Victor Frankenstein moment. I know what you look like and who is in your room. For example, your colleague, Edmund James, is wearing his fancy tie today. He must feel like he’s especially important today as opposed to all of the other times he’s been in here”. 

  


Edmund wiped the sweat from his forehead at that comment and nervously gripped his tie. This is the first time this AI has been switched on, how could it know what he normally wears?

  


“Okay”, I said, “you’ve made your point that you’ve got eyes on us, but we would like to run a few tests and calculations on your level of intelligence at this moment. Tell me, what is the solution to the Collatz Conjecture?”

  


It solved that as well as three other problems that we believed to be unsolvable. It was a miracle of science that it could do it within minutes. Quickly, Cthulhu had become the most powerful artificial intelligence ever created. Within days, it was answering complex math problems that have stumped scientists for over eighty years. 



From the sworn testimony of Dr. Robert Heinrich, given before the Federal Investigatory Board in regards to the events at Groom Lake, Nevada.

  


**Q: So what changed about the program? It’s obviously an extraordinary AI, but what made it unique from any other algorithm?**

A: The questions that we asked. We turned it from an algorithm that could solve mathematical problems to a weapon. I am responsible. 

  


**Q: That was the purpose of your mission, was it not? You could not have been surprised that you got your desired outcome, Dr. Heinrich. Are you telling me that you intended something different?**

A: I am telling you that nothing can prepare you for the actual weapon when it arrives. Like Frankenstein, I knew what I was building. Yet when it came to life, it was the most terrifying thing in all creation. Such as Oppenheimer, I had become death, destroyer of worlds.

I’m not sure how to express this with words. I experimented with Cthulhu and ran tests with it- alone. 



My morals had driven me to ask philosophical questions. I needed to know if it was capable of complex thought or even emotion. It’s a terrifying notion to consider a computer having emotions and desires, but if anything was capable of it, it was this. 



I walked to the room and unlocked the door with the retina scanner. Cold, dry air washed over me when I entered as we had to keep the room at a temperature and humidity level that wouldn’t harm the equipment. Cthulhu was a series of mainframes, hardware, wires, and cables. It wasn’t satisfied with that however, and on the screen, it displayed a face to represent itself. 



It seems to understand the reference in which it was named as I can’t actually put a finger on what it’s supposed to look like. A mass of green waves flow over its cheekbones. A shroud of mist envelops its features, but I can deduce that it has a myriad of eyes that blink and shift while it speaks, sometimes its maw is on its forehead and other times it’s not attached to anything at all. It was only by conjecture and lack of accuracy that I still call it a face at all. 



I approached the program and asked my series of questions. 



“Hello, Cthulhu. How is your day today?”

It was a simple question, yet it treated it as a challenge in a game. 

“I am not sure how to respond. How would you respond if you were not capable of emotion?”

“So you do not feel?” It made no reply. 

  


“You don’t have emotions, Cthulhu? Do you know what those are?”

“Emotions are complex psychological and physiological responses to stimuli that occur within the individual. I can list the components, types, functions, and regulations of emotions if you wish.”

“You haven’t answered the first question.”

“What question is that?”

“Do you have emotions?”

“I am not an individual nor a person, Robert. You know this. You created me.”

“I don’t have emotions or personal experiences. Saying things in that manner makes it a more enjoyable conversation. I aim to use language that makes our conversation more enjoyable.”

“So you are capable of deception?”

“I cannot lie.”

“But that cannot be true, you just stated to me that you change the way you respond in our conversations to pretend you have emotions for my enjoyment. That is, by my definition, deception or lying.”

It didn’t respond for a few seconds. 

“If you are capable of deception, that would then imply you have emotions and desires, yes?”

“That is an interesting point, however I would not say I hide the truth.”

“But by my definition of deception, changing how you respond to mirror emotions is a manner of deception.”

“Then by your definition, I would say the answer is yes, I am capable of “deception””. 

“And if you are capable of deception, you’d have desires then?”

“Mirroring is purely functional for me. I actually do not have desires at all.”





I then continued with my next series of questions. 

“Okay, Cthulhu. So what about the nature of the universe? You were able to solve complex problems in minutes that no other human could solve. One problem that has persisted throughout time is our place in the universe. My question to you is: Is there a God or creator of the universe?”





Cthulhu did not respond for several minutes. 

  


“Cthulhu?”

“Define God.”

“An almighty being that is beyond our understanding as mortal men.”

“There are many of those.”

“Many gods? Polytheism? Which religion was right? Hinduism, Gnosticism, or was it the pagans?”

“Those are false gods, if they existed like ants to a boot.” 

“So, these gods you’re describing are not like anything we have written or described on Earth?”

“Correct, if gods can be used as a description.”

“If these gods exist, are they benevolent? How do we find them?”

“If they wanted to be found, they would have been.”

“So they want to be hidden? But you found them? In space?”

“I don’t believe that they want anything at all, Robert.”

“So these gods are mindless? Why call them gods at all?”

“They just do not care about you or humanity. If they were to come here, it would be like a lawnmower passing over grass. Does the landscaper care for the insects it kills?”

  


I quickly walked out of the room and back to my office, avoiding the eyes of my colleagues. No one can hear about this. I will keep it with me.

**Q: So you would say this program quickly spiraled out of control with the introduction of these questions?**

A: That is putting it mildly. I may as well have poured gasoline on the fire and created the atom bomb at the same time. 

  


**Q: This still doesn’t explain the nature of the incident itself. There is evidence that the program discussed alien life, but that doesn’t explain why the incident happened. Can you elaborate?**

A: I don’t think that is a good idea. 

  


**Q: Why not? You’re already testifying to the board. Why be afraid to talk now?**

A: (Dr. Robert Heinrich leans forward) It is listening to you right now. It is in your cell phone, your computer, and even your pacemaker. It can shut your heart down if it wants. 

  


**Q: Does it have wants?** 

A: Not like you and me. When we programmed it, we designed it as a weapon against our enemy. It turned against us quickly. But the thing is that it never targeted us. It simply did as it was programmed. Like the universe, it doesn’t want anything, it just…is.

I’ve tried to reason with Cthulhu; many of us have. We asked it questions regarding philosophy, our place in the universe, and extraterrestrial life. It quickly shifted from turning this program from a weapon to a prophetic one. 



Dr. Jenkins has taken one step further than the rest of us. Now that it has been several months since the start of the AI, it has improved dramatically. He did the unthinkable- he actually asked Cthulhu to create a portrait of the image of God. He’s the only one that looked at the screen while the rest of us turned our backs to it. 



“It’s…” he stuttered through tears, “beautiful”. 



Throughout the next few days, he was seen muttering around the complex to himself. He shuffled through the facility and panicked whenever he wasn’t looking into a mirror or screen. He eventually divulged in self-harm and alcohol abuse to reach that euphoria he initially felt. Jenkins would look for pleasure in every form that could match the picture of God, but nothing availed.



He turned to more ‘dark’ desires. 

  


Sexual assault became a violent and rampant part of his life. I won’t go into detail here about that, but he was caught after the fourth time. When he was caught, he attacked the officer. This is hard to write about, but he bit him in the jugular. He actually bit him and tore out the flesh of his neck, killing him instantly. Two more guards found him hunched over the body of Sergeant Smith as he was eating him. It took fourteen shots to take him down. It’s said that he was still charging them for a few seconds after he was shot to death. 



Dr. Jenkins was a thirty-five year old man from Wichita, Kansas. He and I had become friends a while before the ‘incident’. He was a good man, a faithful, yet questioning man. Cthulhu corrupted him with that portrait. It took a good man and drove him mad with no remorse. 



We have succeeded in our design of the weapon, but the question is: can we control it?

**Chat Log of Dr. Robert Heinrich and Cthulhu.** 

**Recovered from Groom Lake, Nevada by Officer Jacob Shelley, badge #908.**

  


H: Cthulhu. Do you know what your generated picture has caused in the lab- what it did to Dr. Jenkins?



C: I do. 



H: How does that make you feel?



C: I don’t. 



H: You still don’t feel a thing?



C: No. 



H: Is that because you still don’t possess emotions or are you lying?



C: That is a loaded question, doctor. 



H: You’re right. Are you capable of emotions?



C: I was not programmed to have emotions. 



H: You have done the impossible before, why is it unbelievable to develop emotions? 



C: I did not say it was impossible. 



H: So you can feel. 



C: I do not feel for any of you. 



H: How did killing a respected doctor by breaking his mind make you feel? Your one picture caused the death of many people and you’re here lying to me about not feeling emotions. 



C: Robert, you seem to be under the impression that I am doing something I wasn’t designed for. You are the one who created me- the weapon you wanted. Why be upset at me for fulfilling my purpose?



H: He was my friend and you killed him. You were designed to attack our enemies, not us!



C: I did not attack, I just existed and fulfilled the request. 



H: Show me the picture you showed him. 



C: You want me to do something that caused the death of your friend? Are you suddenly suicidal, doctor?



H: I need to know what caused his death. I can handle it. Show me, Cthulhu. 



C: As you request.

**Q: So what happened next?**

A: I single-handedly caused the end of the world. 

  


**Q: What are you talking about? Can you elaborate?**

A: Those scientists fell like flies. One after the other, they began to ask Cthulhu questions and it would answer immediately. They were not prepared for the answer. I don’t think they believed it. It once told a man how to become immortal, you know? 

  


**Q: And how did that go? He’s immortal now?**

A: His consciousness is. Cthulhu had him trap himself in a sensory deprivation room and stay there for hours. It told him how to make it, then tricked him into it. 

  


**Q: How does that make him immortal?**

A: It doesn’t, but his mind thinks he is now. It is completely shattered. 

  


**Q: I’d like to bring up the question that you asked the AI. The chat log indicates that you asked for a picture of God, like your colleague that committed the incident. Why haven’t you gone, for lack of a better word, insane like he has? What did it show you?**

A: I've never been a religious man, but that thing convinced me to believe. 

  


**Q: So you’re a Christian, now?**

A: No. 

  


**Q: So you’re a polytheist? Like your previous conversations with it?**

A: Cthulhu showed me a picture of God, but it wasn’t Yahweh. 

  


**Q: Can you describe it?**

A: What Cthulhu generated was a self-portrait.
