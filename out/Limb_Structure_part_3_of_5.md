Watching Kyle break branches, I couldn’t shake the thought of how **pointless** it all was. A songbird fluttered above on a nearby branch, and I strained to sniff through the lingering fumes of exhaust oil and gas. Desperate to detect any threats on this unseasonably icy January night, I found the dirt bike’s fumes choking the air, masking any hint of danger. "What the hell are you doing?" 

Kyle paused, shooting me a dismissive look before continuing. "Hiding OUR ride..." 

I leaned against the nearest tree folding my arms over my chest. "You can't." 

The trees clustered around us leaning in to cast eerie twisted shadows from pale moonlight. He muttered under his breath flinging the branch in my general direction. The branch tangled on a sapling and dangled impotently. "Of course I can. What **the hell** is wrong with you?" 

I gestured to the engine. "I can smell that thing from the moon. If you want to hide or protect it from a Skinwalker, **set it on fire**." 

Befuddlement crossed Kyle's features. "Well... I... things you should have... *Fine!*" Kyle gave up. "Whatever. *You win*. Just bought the effing thing and now it's gone." He stamped around too frustrated to protest further.

“*Relax*, you have the keys. If you’re right, Skinwalkers that hang here aren’t going to take it.” Ignoring Kyle sneaking a metal tube to his nose I continued. Let him prepare in whatever way he had to. If he was going to be involved **illicit** strength was better than just being human. “Middle of the woods, becoming a beast is better than stealing any motorized option, fleeing in any old direction is superior to down a few paths.” *What a way to spend winter break.* “Let’s look into your guess.”

Kyle sniffled hard with chemical inspiration off the back of his thumb. “I didn’t **guess**.” Kyle huffed with a snarled retort. “This is a fact. People go missing here and the cops don’t even bother investigating. Pete’s involved.” He clutched at the snub nose, holstered on his hip, tugging while puffing up his chest and strolling through the woods. “We’re gunna get him.” He used a bit of TV twang summoning up his best, *not good at all*, impression of a cowboy ready for a gunfight. He halted half turned back to me a little hesitation to his frosty tone. “People uh… They see stuff out here too. Like freaky giant animals and exotic reptiles and stuff. That snake you read about was found out here.”

“Shoot first, never ask,” I warned Kyle while suppressing the acrid scent of the engine drowning my nostrils. “I begged you to take the dirt bike for a *reason*. Any of them should have heard us coming and have cleared out already.”

“Wait… You *want* them gone? That defeats the whole purpose.” Kyle blathered with exasperation.

Pulling myself off the tree I paced around aimlessly for a bit. Attempting to figure out what to say to Kyle to keep him calm. “They would smell either of us before we got close. The bike is **loud**. It gives them time to pack up their shit and run off or hide. We don’t want to fight, but *we will*, we’re here for leads and evidence. People might do deals out here and run into trouble, hobo camp you called it?” Kyle nodded **vigorously** shivering under his winter jacket. “Yeah well, perfect spot for a skin walker. Come and go as you please, pick somebody off nobody cares about, hide the evidence, no one bothers you. Won’t be surprised to find a few out here.”

He took a moment as the implication sank in. “There’s more than Pete?” He asked with a gulp of uncertainty.

“Pete ain't no patient zero,” I confirmed gesturing toward the loose cluster of tents.

“How long?” Kyle asked as he squared his shoulders while strutting beside me defensively.

“How long has the sun been shining?” I stated more than I asked, not sure, but aware of what Primus could do.

I strode casually through the tents gazing a hard stare into anyone that stirred enough to challenge our presence. Few inhabitants bothered. Most were blasted out of existence so hard they wouldn’t know their own names let alone care about fresh faces.

“You looking for something?” A scrawny woman asked with a hint of offer to her disheveled and worn features.

“The weird shit.” I stated plainly.

She thought about it while Kyle held onto the grip of his gun and made vaguely disgruntled *sounds*.

“I don’t do that no more. Shelia can help you, she’s *real desperate*.” She pointed over to a red tent, which was so filled with tatters and rips that it might be better to sleep under the stars. I snatched at Kyle’s shoulder to keep him from seeking out the unfortunate woman in question.

“The other *weird shit*. The stuff people don’t come back from.” I cleared up any confusion.

It took her a minute. A brain clogged with chems struggling to focus on much of anything. “What you boys…”

“We ain’t boys!” Kyle swore at her struggling with the grip of his gun.

She nodded and ignored Kyle, turning to me, with a bit of shock in her ragged eyes. “*You’re serious?* Lost a cousin? Don’t help to go lookin. More problems. Bad stuff out in ***the haunt***. Been there once or twice myself.”

“You lose someone?” I kept the conversation focused. Trying to tease out even a speck of information when I could find it.

“Few girls. Even a John or two.” She leaned back exhausted and sad in front of her meager possessions. Mostly *tired*. She deflated and then perked up a bit, as if happy that someone cared enough to ask.

“Dude there’s a pile of needles on the ground.” Kyle commented as if that was news.

“Where from here?” I asked crossing my hands over my chest. She didn’t seem phased but half stood to show me the path.

“Out over the crest, trail cuts right and into a gully. If anyone is out there just walk around them. Past the pair of burned-out trucks. If you see the cabin, all collapsed, run back home to your momma. Before that, you might find Shawn, been missing for a couple days. Went out to get some space. No one seen him since. "The ragged woman fell into her tent sitting back up with much difficulty and awkward grumbling

“Anything I can recognize him by?”

“He wore a stained bright blue hoodie, rip taped up on the left sleeve by the wrist. Never took it off, even in summertime.” She paused greedily snatching the 20 I pushed at her. “You boys want a quick blowie? Package deal?” She offered hopefully.

I had to yank Kyle away from her. “You don’t want it.”

“I do, ***actually***.” Kyle protested while squirming to break free of my grip. “Let me go!” He screamed in rage. “*Dude*, when did you get so strong?” He rubbed at his forearm while wincing.

I didn’t know so *I didn’t respond.* Further evidence that Humans stand **zero chance** against skin walkers, heightened strength over the ability to vanish in a split second and come back the next moment as a bear behind you. ***Run***. It's your only option, not a very good one either. 

I paused half a step away keeping a tight grip on Kyle’s arm but trying not to hurt him. “Hey, you ever see stuff out here? In ***the Haunt?***” I wondered what that was but used the term regardless.

She nodded and didn’t talk for a long stretch of chill winds, till I handed her another 20. “All kinds of stuff. Weird lights, people dressed all primitive, big cats, bodies, people all torn up. Nothing there the next day. No one ever believes any of us. Cause *you know*.” She picked up a pipe that drenched the air with a stain of melted plastic. Puffing away until her eyes glazed over absently crinkling the fresh bills in the same hand as the lighter. Oblivious to the world once more.

Kyle tried to mask his growing frustration, but I noticed the subtle signs—clenched fists, a tight jaw, and the slight tremor in his voice—as he insisted on being allowed to help. Hopefully, if nothing **serious** went wrong Kyle would get the picture that no one should be looking into this, despite *who their friends are*.

Beyond the tents and their disheveled inhabitants, down the hill and into the tall dead golden grass a silent march into increasingly foreboding and quiet spaces. Fortunately, no one was ‘working’ on this particular night. The second to last thing I wanted to stumble upon with Kyle in tow, was a pair of heads at varying heights or positions grinding their lives away.

“Smells like burnt cheese. Glad to be away from the camp.” Kyle tugged free his shotgun and took point. “It’s nice out here. Look a dog.” He pointed with an odd tilt of smile to his lips.

I only needed a glance to understand, that weren’t *no dog*. I didn’t bother to correct Kyle. Something deeper **rankled** about the lolling lazy tongue of the predator. It didn’t give the slightest of *effs* about us. *Just hanging out in sight of people.*

Slightly better to have him up front with that cannon. I could smell the tension leaking out of every pore upon Kyle. Adrenaline frayed his nerves as we crunched through frosted grass. But it was a fickle scent. It kept wavering into blissful glee like someone was flipping a light switch in heaven. Sounds seemed to cut off beyond the crunch of our boots on the trail. Kyle's and my own rapidly increasing plumes of lung gas clouding into the night above us as we walked in relative silence. "Is that a flashlight?”

Kyle jumped with a start, juggling the pistol while cursing till he recognized my hand on his shoulder. I let him guide my view toward a sharp jagged beam of smoking light. Raising up 30 feet into the air to stop under the limbs of a few lonely pines. “You can see that?” I asked to be sure. *Hoping he would say no*.

“Wish I didn’t.” He mumbled in a whisper. “It’s like emerging from the fucking soil. What the hell is doing ***that?*** Hidden car battery?” Kyle attempted to explain Primus’ presence away in any manner he could.

“That’s **Primus**. That’s how you know it's close.” The urge to turn and run surged within me, a primal instinct clawing at my resolve. Kyle could see it too—the light of Primus. *No one was* **safe**. My heart fluttered and pounded, but I forced myself to stay rooted, my shoes glued to the ground.

“Dude that’s not right.” Kyle insisted. I silently agreed with a quiet nod. “So, something is out here.”

“Me, at the very least,” I replied pointing off the thin spotty trail so we could work our way around the sliver of sunshine. Creeping along I recalled something the camp woman had said off-hand. “The haunt, another clue, local legend or something?”

Kyle paused. “What planet are you from, Guthy? **The Haunt** is folklore, Indiana stuff. Like a Wendigo or something, but *a place*. Possess people, turns them into animals or abominations, ruins everything it touches.”

My blood ran cold. *Pretty accurate*. Enough to be mostly true. “Anything about sunshine at night?”

“This is like… alien abduction shit!” Kyle swore right before a thunk of impact. Twisting with his gun ready I had to tackle him to the ground. Several more impacts hitting trees above us. My pulse began to race. Dog ears aimed in a moment toward the shard of steaming light. I crouched low as a dog, barely noticing my own transformation anymore. Scanning the desolate frozen hillocks in crisp blues and yellows. The darkness of the night pushed backward well beyond the reach of any flashlight. Terrified that Kyle had been hit.

Kyle stayed where I’d thrown him. Raising his arm enough to fetch a broken arrow shaft, glaring at the stone-bladed tip like it was made out of magic. He reached out giving a few yanks to the arrow lodged in the trunk. “Oh here’s one! This is evidence!” Kyle exclaimed as if we weren’t under attack. Holding aloft a pristine stone-headed arrow proudly before fumbling to tuck it into a pocket awkwardly.

I didn’t smell any blood in the wind so I tossed my head in a circle around the portal of light, attempting to show Kyle where I was going with the motion of my skull, nudging Kyle’s gun hoping he took the message and kept me covered. Kyle caught up to his racing breaths about the same time I managed to catch his eye and curb my panic-laced thoughts.

I circled out wide, hidden by the golden hollow grass, stalking around the portal of brilliance. A thunder of hooves bashing through the dirt. Massive furry muscled bison bucked as arrows struck it in the side. Crimson poured across the ground. A bellow of terror and pain echoed as I hunched low on cold paws. It bleated in pain and toppled over. The beast's massive body crashed with enough force to startle Kyle and me both. Grunts and coughs emerged with choking sputters as the giant herd animal died in light snow. Staining the frozen flakes with gallons of burgundy essence.

I crept out. Checking the air, glancing back toward Kyle to see a glint of metal tube leveled toward the bison. Padding out and crawling uncomfortably low I edged up to the sunshine unsure of why I was even approaching. **A shout**. I rolled away from something striking the dirt where I’d been. Darting toward the nearest bush. Several pairs of bound fur-wrapped feet plodding after me. Cries of some gibberish I couldn’t even begin to comprehend rang through the night air.

High-pitched, urgent phrases echoed around me, but it was all nonsense from a cluster of madmen. The stench of blood, dirt, and grime clung to them, hate and malice pouring from their lungs. I darted my eyes around, searching for cover—only to find the nearest patch just out of reach. I might be able to make it, but ‘if’ is as valuable as the spare holes these half-naked men in hide loincloths were so eager to provide me.

Damn it! *I didn’t know what to do*. My racing thoughts crashed together in a heap of twisted metal car frames. My mind went completely blank. I could dash for better cover, but I had to choose fast. The men were heading toward me. I was caught in the moment unsure where Kyle was or if it might be too late to flee at all.

The men circled around the bush, waving their hands, the time for flight long since passed. I shifted on all four paws stuck in place, with nowhere to hide and no plan rushing to mind. The fur on my hackles spiked toward the sky. I shivered, a whimper escaping despite my efforts to contain it. Both bows pulled tight, knees bent, and the seconds bloated across time. Arrows aimed into my tiny bush of protection. The heated stench of their lungs gusted along the streams of anticipation coursing through my veins.

**Explosion**. Gunshots. Each blast hammered through my pointed skull. Echoing with a sharp ring jabbing painfully into my ears. **Panic.** I had to move. I had to change the situation. Loathing poured out through a horrendous snarl and I jumped into action long before I knew what I was doing.

Racing through the fear. *Into it*. I launched across the ground. Teeth bared. Claws cutting into the frozen soil. A man turned back losing an arrow on instinct. My fangs struck throat. **Protect Kyle**. A twist, yanking rip.  A spray of supple flesh and collapsing victim. Swallowing. Pressing eager fangs into a screaming face. Ripping with a will. Fists hammering across fur. Mangling while feeding. *Don’t you dare threaten my friends.* Don’t you fucking **dare!** Mindless fury aimed at a hapless target.

I snapped at a second man kneeling and clutching at his stomach in shock. He shoved his hands at my maw of daggers to no avail. His fingers filled my belly with almost as much warmth and pleasure as his supple cheek and shards of jawbone. Pausing in mid gulp. Snarling at the blurry rough shape of a man who waved some sort of lump in my direction. Heavy streams of charcoal and sulfur poured up into the sky from within his palm.

“Guthy?” Kyle’s voice quaked as he kept the pistol between me and him. “You good man?”

He had no idea. *He didn’t know*. My best friend couldn’t tell. I became a moron teen again. As simple as the thought, you think it, one mask of form swapped for another. My hands yanking torn sections of face tissue. I paused wiping my palms against the grass. Standing up slowly so as not to startle him.

Kyle flopped onto his ass in relief. “Thank the lord of fuck. *Jesus dude*. He was long dead. You were at it for a while. Scared the shit outta me.”

My dread remained long after it left Kyle. He seemed alright, but he always looked that way. Glad to be alive. The malignant hunger, cavernous, wailed deep in my core, furious to be caged so soon. It thrashed against its restraints. *How long until I’d want Kyle to put me down?* The question gnawed at me as deeply as the errant sensation. A fresh wave of concern washed over me, and all I could do was fold my knees tight against my chest. Kyle kept his distance. Eventually, I regained enough composure to ask him, “You taking care of the bodies? What do we do about the bodies?”

Kyle leaned aside lighting a joint and checking his empty pistol with quivering hands. The corpse behind him was covered in scars and animal hides. “Soil’s hard as a stone. What the hell are we going to do with them?”

I spared a moment to ponder the meat in my stomach. It tasted ***so good***. So much better than regular food. I still **longed** for another bite. Absently licking at blood-drenched palms. “How many were there?”

“Four or five. Too scared shitless to count. Struck one in the gut, and shot at another. You got two. The rest. Don’t know.” Kyle admitted curling up against a tree clutching his gun in an iron grip. “I think somebody shit my pants.”

I laughed at the blatant honesty catching a waft of the ruined air. “Yeah, got away clean too. We’ll get him next time.” I stood patting Kyle on the shoulder. “Keep watch.” The fragment of light began to roam across the area. Blissfully away from where I observed it. Giant-distended bugs emerged from the glimmer. My stomach twisted at their foreign construction. Water poured out of the rift in their wake. Even as I fought another tide of terror sinking its claws into my muscles the bugs died, gasping for breath and collapsing in a heap.. A moment or two out of the light and not a one survived the embrace of darkness. As if there wasn’t nearly enough oxygen in the air around them.

“Let's head back to my house,” I announced having had enough of this mess.

Suddenly, an old man stood beside me, his presence as sudden as it was unnerving. I didn’t cry out. His *eyes were kind*. He grabbed my palm with digits so rough and weathered they felt like sandstone for a moment. I didn’t stop him. There was a wisdom in those ancient slate-grey eyes. He knew more than I would **ever** know. His fingers might have been rough but his grip was warm and calming. I could do nothing but continue to stare at the old man, shirtless with dark-tanned skin, as he hummed a sort of peaceful lullaby.

Kyle was saying something. Screaming I think but not moving closer. Everything got brighter.

My wrist began to blister and cook. Like that time I touched the hot stove top as a kid when my Ma walked away for a second. Gritting my teeth against the pain I opened my eyes to see a wolf digging its fangs into my forearm. Pinpricks of blazing coals stabbed into my muscles. I couldn’t move. My heart smashed repeatedly against the inside of my skull. I stared as the fur flickered into scales. A gargantuan iguana gripping my limb between kitchen knife-long fangs, a giant fleshy fan rising off of its back. It walked backward pulling me easily along with it toward a wall of solid light.

Each step toward the portal made my legs tremble, the stolen ground beneath me slipping away with every heartbeat. The lizard’s eye was so large that I couldn’t help but stare into it. Any direction I might turn would have that basketball-sized orb in it. The mouth released me and I turned to run for all I was worth. Suddenly able to hear the ragged scraping of panic attacks and furious breaths hurrying to beat one another out of my lungs. Something wet and massive curled around one of my ankles. I slammed into the frigid ground. All the air was torn out of me. The tongue slithering off with a stream of thick mucus coating my pants. Water too, my urine drenching a warm puddle when I rolled over.

A giant scorpion claw clacked before my face. Sharp armored feet stabbed into the hard soil. Water, a cube of floating impossibility hung around the six-foot-long THING mincing its mandibles inches from my chest. It retreated into the light, snapping its claws to splash and disturb the shape of warm water. The light cut off and the salty ocean spray tore across the field taking me with it. I sputtered at Kyle’s tattered old sneakers. A slash of gleaming flame sank horrifically into the skin of my right wrist.

 Kyle stared down at me holding a dirty blue hoodie “I found Shawn, not much left of him. Don’t think we gotta worry about cleaning up.” He made simple hurried conversation as if trying to avoid bringing up more obvious topics.

The grass where Primus stood was charred black, the ground beneath cracked and scorched. The trees nearby were splintered as if struck by lightning. Kyle’s gaze followed mine, his expression twisted in shock at the devastation.

“Give me that.” I snatched it out of Kyle’s grip. “Good find.” Tossing a bone toward Kyle’s deflated demeanor. Neither of us wanted to acknowledge what we’d just been through. So we swept it under the rug and burned down the house that the rug was in.

“It’s just a coat though. Even I have better ones.” Kyle commented dusting off his palms as he stood back up.

Shutting my eyes while I heaved a few breaths into the night. “That woman asked about it. We might as well.” We traded pensive looks but both of us knew it was the right thing to do.

The trudge back was quiet. *Abysmally so*. The procession of observant animals in royal rows of attendance ***did not help***. Even Kyle fought to contain the words that would normally bubble forth from his lips. Cresting the hill I pushed it from my brain. Stalking through the cluster of aged tents, wondering why these people seemed so complacent. No one spoke. Only those who were tripping through the light fantastic seemed to convey any emotion. As if something **held** them here against their will and **forced** their brains off.

Pausing at the rise out of the gully, I felt a tug at my right wrist. A pull. A simple slight pain asked me to go back into the insanity. My wrist burned with the mark Primus left, a searing reminder of the power I couldn’t escape, pulling me inexorably back toward the darkness. Back toward Primus and whatever it willed of me.

“Shawn!” The rattling vocal cords of the woman called out. Dashed apart when she realized the truth behind the bright blue zippered hoodie in my hands. She offered a hopeful look toward me and then toward Kyle. “It's just a coat. He could still be out there… Coulda tossed it and ran. Any number of…”

“No. He didn’t make it.” I cut her off. The blade of truth and understanding dug into my heart slicing worse the more she rambled on. “No.” I shook my head. “Shawn, he was… No.”

It took her a while to come to terms with the news. Her thin arms took possession of the old jacket. Rocking the treasure like a babe for a painful minute. Scrambling into her tent without a word.

Just as Kyle brushed by, his head hung so low it might fall off, she pinched at my sleeve. “Shawn drew a lot. We both *used to*.” A few worn notebooks pressed against my stomach. I tried to refuse but her eyes curled up in loathing.

“Thank you.” I managed to spare her a bit of human value and comfort. I held them close while catching up after Kyle.

“Dude this is rough.” Kyle moved to pick up the dirt bike. “Weird that it's still here.” Kyle’s eyes finally caught up to what happened to my arm. “I don’t have anything for that burn. I could tear up my shirt.” He suggested while holding the dirt bike aloft.

I waved off the request to bandage the wound. Wanting nothing more than to arrive home and receive a thorough tongue-lashing from my parents. "Were the desperate hobos gunna steal it? Where would they sell it this time of night?” I shivered with more than the chill seeping into the drenched clothes covering my form.

“You good, dude?” Kyle prodded at my soaked coat.

“Just start the damn bike, Kyle.”
