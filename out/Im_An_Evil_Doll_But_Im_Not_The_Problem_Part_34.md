The first part of Ashton’s story:

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/lu80bo8XDc





Besides sounding like his father was a cement mixer, Abe made it out of our strange situation okay. If it happened today, he’d have probably just walked it off. 

But that didn’t mean the Salesman didn’t leave his mark on us. 

Then again, life goes on. The world went to war for the second time, and a lot of good men died fighting the good fight. 

Proving god has a sense of humor, WW2 was great for people like myself. The government couldn’t just ignore the dark parts of the world anymore. Secret agreements turned to funding, information and technology was exchanged, we finally crawled out of the dark ages. 

For those of you doing the math, yeah, I’m old as dirt. But people like myself, we’re around for a long time, not a good time. 

Best case scenario anyway. 

But with that silver lining, of course came clouds. 

Television in the 50’s was damn near seen as magic to begin with. I’ve never seen a fad take over the country so hard. 

At least that was the thinking at the time. 

And with this new staple of the American dream, came a whole host of supernatural critters looking to take advantage. 

“My eyeballs feel like they’re sunburnt.”, Abe says, applying a thick ointment  “ What ever happened to a good old fashioned werewolf or vampire?”

Sue picks pieces of broken screen from her massive fist. 

“Most of them got killed fighting the Germans. Not enough left to cause shit.”, I reply. 

“You made my joke accurate, now it’s funny.”, Abe jabs. 

No need for a mildew ridden backroom in some dive store now. Abe, Sue and myself are in a government funded “office space.”. Cheap suits, cheap furniture, and no one is the wiser. 

The phone on the pressboard desk rings. 

“Sue, you want to get that?”, Abe asks. 

Susan raises a bleeding middle finger.

“If you don’t know who you called, you should just hang up.”. I greet. 

“Ashton, how are Abe and Sue doing?.”, Says a familiar voice. 

“Eli Benson, you old bastard, you finally figure out how a telephone works?”, I joke. 

Eli isn’t one of us. Not by birth anyway. 

He’s what we call a traveler. 

You have people that come out of a scrape with the supernatural and then go back to living their lives. We call those folks tourists. 

Travellers are the crazy nuts that come face to the face with something they can’t explain, then decide they liked what they saw. 

He's not touched by the void like us. But that doesn’t seem to stop him. 

“Been busy, helping usher in the modern age of animation and all.”, Eli replies. 

“I heard about that, you helped make that Steamboat Willie cartoon. 

Would have thought you’d have stayed enlisted though.”, I say. 

“I’m a fighting man, not a soldier. I pick my wars. 

But this isn’t a social call. I’ve got a job opportunity for you if you’re interested.”, Eli offers. 

“The military is having you call, why not our normal contact?”, I ask. 

“I’m completely out of government work. 

No, this is for a…co-worker of mine.”, Eli begins. 

“We have to run private work up the chain now. Might take a while.”, I say apologetically. 

“Not worried about that, my co-worker, he’s got connections, that light has already went green. 

But he’s a bit particular about you wanting to be on board.”, Eli says. 

“Why us, why all this cloak and dagger nonsense?”, I inquire. 

“He’s partnered with someone he thinks you had a run in with a few years back. He was working as a salesman or something?”, Eli replies. 

My heart sinks, I feel a thin film of sweat form on my brow. 

“I take it that silence means you know who I’m talking about?”, Eli asks. 

“Yeah, but that was a long time ago, wasn’t much to speak of.”, I lie. 

“Still, Co-worker says he can’t find anyone with more information. 

Between you, me, and the lightpost Ashton, this guy has deep pockets. Management is going to love you, and I’m positive you three are going to get one hell of a signing bonus. 

I’m not reaching out for his sake. Fuck Arthur Deus. I’m reaching out because I know it’s an opportunity for you three.”, Eli offers. 

“There’s the turd in the punchbowl. 

I knew Mr. D was into some strange shit, but Arthur? 

He can dress up where he comes from all he wants, but he’s a demon. “, I say, shocked. 

“He’s supernatural middle management. I’m not saying I like the guy, but when have I ever steered you wrong?”, Eli asks. 

“Sue, Abe. Eli is on the phone, wants us to work with Arthur Deus. Says it’s related to that salesman from a while back.”, I announce. 

Sue looks angry and interested. 

“Where at?”, Abe asks. 

“Little border town In Ontario.”, Eli replies, hearing Abe. 

I pass the info along. 

“Ask him if there’s anything decent to eat up there. I’m tired of being in the only state without a half decent deli. “, Abe jokes. 



Abe got his wish, the little border town seemed to be a haven for post world war 2 immigration. After spending so long in the south, we’d forgotten the benefits of a little diversity. 

It's a blistering summer night as we approach a newly built high school. 

“This the place?”, Abe asks. 

“No other high school’s here, has to be.”, I reply. 

We walk into the building, all of us are a little on edge, but as we make our way to a state of the art auditorium, nothing jumps out of a dark corner. 

Sitting on the edge of the stage is a tall man with blond, slicked back hair. His custom suit screams expensive. His eyes are black pools pinpricked with points of red.

Standing on the ground below him is Eli. Square jawed, with a face that can hide emotion better than most poker players. 

“Gentlemen, and lady. I thank you all for your time. I know I’m not your usual clientele. 

But, I find myself in a most unique situation. 

I’m sure I don’t have to tell any of you who I am. Media, entertainment, that is my realm. From the first cave drawing, to the three stooges I’ve been there. 

Now, recently, I have taken on a partner. This whole television situation took off like a burning cat. 

But I have some…concerns about my new friend. 

I may be the least of my brothers. A role I take no shame in. As the least of us is still gifted with power and knowledge beyond anything mortals could comprehend. 

Not within my own repository, nor that of any of my family do we have  so much as an iota of information about him. 

Now, I’m not one to overestimate my ability. One must know what they don't know after all. 

But this partner of mine, he's amassing a certain level of influence that I find, concerning. 

You may want to know, why I don’t just deal with him myself. Well, to make things simple, let’s say optics. 

My partner and I have a contract. I can’t be seen doing anything myself to break it. 

So I reached out to my friends in high places, and here you are.”, Arthur explains.

"I’ve been on the wrong side of a few of your endeavors. That record that made folks kill their families. Those moving pictures that popped out of the screen. 

Lot of good folks died. Seems to me like if the Salesman is pointed in your direction that’s a good thing.”, I reply. 

“Growing pains, the cost of innovation, call it what you will. But the gorier details of my projects are an unfortunate side effect not the end goal. 

This isn’t a favor, I’m paying your bosses handsomely, both in funds and information. There is so much evil I have nothing to do with, and I have no problem helping you and yours tilt at those windmills. 

And you three? Name your price.”, Arthur offers. 

“Abe, what are you thinking?”, I ask, unsure. 

“I don’t know. All this still seems like a little too much of a deal with the devil. 

Or at least his kid brother, Marty.”, Abe offers. 

“Do I appear to have brought anything for that? 

No contract written in blood, no pledges to a higher authority. 

If you were stupid enough to make that kind of agreement with me, I wouldn’t want your assistance in the first place. 

No, we seal this on our words alone. Payment up front if you demand it.”, Arthur replies. 

We stand in silence for a minute. All of this is strange and too good to be true. 

“Cards on the table, I don’t know if the three of us have the firepower to get the job done. “, I confess. 

“If it was a matter of firepower I’d not be here debasing myself. 

I want information. As much as you can gather. 

Now, in the process of gathering this, you may run afoul of my partner. I fully expect this to be lethal for the three of you. If you were to happen to kill or harm him in the process, all the better for me. 

It’s a risky proposition, but that’s what you’re getting paid for.”, Arthur counters. 

I won’t bore you with the business details. If we said no, the story wouldn’t really have a point now would it? And I’m not that old yet.

 
We sit in the back of an old diner. I’m working my way through a Salisbury steak that’s way too heavy on the Salisbury.

“Anyone else get the feeling we didn’t have much of a say in what just went on?”, I ask.

“As opposed to?
The way I see it, is this is just like any other job, with a bigger tip. 

The real question is, how in the hell are we going to pull this off?”, Abe asks. 

The two of us bounce ideas of varying levels of feasibility off of each other. Sue is working through a third order of ham and beans when she rolls her eyes. 

“Are you two blind, or stupid?”, She says. 

“She talks!”, Abe exclaims. 

“I talk when I have something to say, you should try it sometime. 

What is the one thing we have on this job that we normally don’t?

The demon. 

I say we walk in like we own the place, crawl up the Salesman’s hoop. 

That son of a bitch was the scariest thing I’ve seen. If we come at this trying to out sneak him, we’re going to lose. “

“Best idea we’ve had so far. “, I reply. 


It took a little convincing but eventually Arthur came around. And we found ourselves in the middle of a place that was half studio half lunatic ramble. 

Every scream behind a closed door, every suspect crimson stain was one more reason I should be putting a bullet into half of the things here. But we’re not here for that, we have a job to do. 

Art leads us into an office, the Salesman looks shocked to see us. His suit is a little more up to date, but otherwise he looks the same. 

“Fancy seeing you here. No hard feelings, Abraham.”, He says insincerely.

“I wanted to get everyone together so there would be no misunderstandings. 

As our business evolves, we are going to require security. That is where our friends come in.

I’ve paid a pretty penny for them to find any potential issues. I know the four of you have history, and I expect all of you to get along. “, Art explains. 

“No issues on my end.”, The salesman says with a small smirk. 

“I watched him kill a bunch of racists, what’s not to love?”, Abe says convincingly.

I could feel that the Salesman knew something was up, but what can could he say? Until we screw up that is. 

Having full access to a place full of monsters and demons was…something else. Add that to the television technology that was over our head, and there was a sense of being lost in our efforts. 

Then again, there was a certain sense of power in being hired by the boss. Things that would leap at us from a dark alley were willing to have sit down conversations with us. 

People like us can get used to the things that go bump in the night. After seeing a poltergeist for the 20th time it looses it’s shock factor. 

But as we sit in our office in the wee hours of the morning going over notes, and copies of paperwork we find things that start to shake us. 

“Seems like most of them are as scared of the salesman as Art. A lot of them were avoiding the truth.”, Abe says. 

“That ain’t good. Not by a country fucking mile.”, I reply. 

“You getting the feeling some of them are hiding things from Art?”, Abe asks. 

Sue nods. 

“Me too.”, I add.

“Now we just need to find out what it is.”, Abe states. 

We spend the next hour going through notes, and watching clips of shows the Salesman was involved in. For a while we don’t notice anything, but eventually we find a breadcrumb. 

“What in the hell, there’s new colors?” , I ask pouring over an invoice from a company that apparently proves this.

“Of course, whole big thing with interior design.”, Abe replies. 

I look to him with a raised eyebrow.

“What, a man can’t have hobbies?  What did you find?”, Abe asks. 

“I don’t know, if I’m reading this right, they sent off a color, and this place can’t confirm if it’s new or not.”, I answer. 

“Sounds like it could be something. 

Better than what I’ve came up with anyway. I’m noticing some things in the background of these pictures that repeat a lot. 

Problem is, I could notice the same thing in any movies or shows made by any production company.”, Abe says. 

“That’s the problem, isn’t it? What do we know about television and movies?

But I was thinking…”, I begin. I’m interrupted by an almost shy knock at the door to our office. 

We’re all reaching for something, there’s never been a knock at the door or phone call after 2 am that’s been good news. 

I open the door, judging by the look on the salesman’s face, I don’t hide my shock very well. 

“Don’t want any, fuck off.”, I saw with a wave of my pearl handled .38. 

The salesman rolls his eyes. 

“Don’t be so dramatic. We had a scuffle 15 years ago, move on man.”, the Salesman says walking into our place. 

Abe and Sue look to me, waiting for a go word. 

“Nice place you’ve got here. Better than that hole in the wall you had back then, eh?

So, why I’m here. 

We’re all coworkers, and I know there is a little bad blood between us. So, instead of you three snooping through my dresser, how about I just tell you what you want to know?”, The salesman offers. 

His eyes seem, dull and unfocussed, like there is nothing really behind them. 

He pulls up a chair, helps himself to a cigarette and a bottle of suds and gives us a large, shark’s grin. 

“Make yourself at home why don’t you?”, Abe says, petulantly. 

“That would be impossible my friend.”, The salesman replies. 

“I’ll bite, what are you?”, I ask plainly, finding my own seat and booze. 

“A man.”, The salesman answers.

Abe rolls his eyes. 

“I knew it, this Putz is going to give us a bunch of spooky non-answers.

Think this is our first rodeo?

You found us, you’re pissed off, let’s get to the part where you turn into something and try to kill us.”, Abe says annoyed. 

“I’m not being cheeky, you just aren’t asking the right questions.”, The salesman replies. 

“Why does someone like Art have any interest in a random Dutch guy?”, Abe asks. His tone makes it sound like a threat. 

The Salesman slaps the table, then points to Abe, “There you go.

Years ago, but not so many as you may think, I was a blacksmith. Honest work, hard work, nothing exciting. 

One day though I was brought a Stein. fine worksmanship, so much so that I was unsure if I could repair it’s damaged hinge. 

I spent weeks, forgoing all my other projects, but I could never get the hinge to close flush. No matter what I tried, how I grinded or filed, I couldn’t bring it to true. 

I became infatuated with it. I traveled across oceans trying to find someone who knew how it was forged and carved. 

Months of this brought me to a conclusion. It wasn’t made here.

Eventually the owner wanted it back. I offered him any other vessel I could make, I offered him coin, service, anything. But, he declined.”, as the Salesman speaks, the lights begin to flicker, “That was when I understood how much this simple stein meant to me. 

Killing that man brought me to a path of blood and enlightenment. But with everything I learned, with every corner of this world and beyond I managed to illuminate, I could only understand what the stein wasn’t. “

There’s a sense of energy in the room, impending doom and evil. This close, the Salesman has an unnatural, chemical reek. 

“I was a changed man at this point. In every way you can think of. But the more I learned, the less I knew about my obsession. 

I found many interesting objects in my travels. Trinkets of gods and demons. But I only found three other things like the Stein. 

Simplicity was their beauty, banality was their allure. Their secret was the only mystery of the universe that mattered. 

But one night, one glorious night I saw it. That was the night I truly became the man I am today. 

The flipbook. 45 glorious frames, less than a second of the answer I craved. 

But it was enough. It showed me, it made me understand. It let me know what’s coming.”, The salesman rants. 

We’re held rapt by the Salesman, as much as we hate to admit it. His admission is a tantalizing glimpse into our own mystery. 

But with a clap of his hands, and a drunk uncle’s grin, the fug of energy dissipates from the room. 

“Leaves us with a lot of questions.”, Abe says. 

“I’m sure it does. 

But I’ve brought you to my house, I’ve shown you my front lawn. This should be enough. “, The salesman responds, darkly. 

 None of us have a reply. We want to ventilate the guy, but we all know how it’d work out for us. 

So for an hour or so we discuss what the Salesman said. But even people like us need our sleep, so eventually, the cans are thrown out, the doors are locked and we all look forward to a few hours of sleep before starting this all again tomorrow.

But we never got that sleep. 

I’ve heard Sue talk. It’s rare, but she isn’t a mute, just, I guess you’d call it introverted nowadays. 

What I’ve never heard is the woman scream. Not in pain, or misery. The woman had a control over her emotions that’d teach the queen’s guard a thing or two. 

The sound was shrill and deep all at the same time. An emotional pain so deep, so instant, and so unexpected it turned physical. 

It tears off into sobs as the massive woman hits the ground in front of her car, tearing open her knees. 

She’s a bit in front of Abe and myself but we both run to catch up. 

The scene we saw in that Chrysler of hers , I don’t think any of us ever really stopped seeing it. 

Sue didn’t have a husband. She had a couple of really good “Friends’, Fred, and Rachel. Funny thing, people like us are usually a bit ahead of the curve on not giving folks shit for doing things different. They were Sue’s family, so they were ours.

I puke, Abe turns away, unable to see Fred and Rachel’s bodies desecrated as they were. 

Sue sobs, crying out for anything that will listen. Heart shattered and mind frayed. 

Across the small parking lot stands the Salesman, staring at us with those shark’s eyes. 

I expect to have to hold Sue back, but she’s no where but in her own mind right now. 

“That, you cut rate Gumshoes is my no trespassing sign.”, The Salesman says. 

In the distance we hear sirens. 

“You might want to get that cleaned up, who knows what the coppers are going to find in the slurry.”, The Salesman taunts casually walking away. 

“Abe, we need to…”, I begin.

“I know. That fucking monster.”, He replies. 

“No!”, Sue screams, turning to face us. One fist already loaded for a punch that leave me waking up in a decade. 

“Sue! There’s police on their way. I know, you loved those two. We loved those two. 

But I guarantee everything in that car is going to pin this on us. I’m not leaving your life up to a bunch of ignorant fucking cops with bad intel. 

We’ll put this bastard in the ground Sue, I promise you. But right now we need to get this taken care of.”, I say putting a hand on her shoulder. 





"Eli Benson, Jesus Christ. Sometimes it feels like the universe is just trolling me, you know?”, Mike says.  
 
“You knew him?”, Ashton replies, wiping slow forming tears from his eyes. 

“I knew someone with that name, military guy, into some strange things. Don’t know if it means anything, but it’s going to prove that old saying ‘ History doesn’t repeat, but it sure does rhyme.’ “, Mike answers. 

“Are you guys picking up on all this?”, Sveta asks, at this point she’s actually taking down notes.

“Seems like a lot of pieces are falling into place. But I’m not seeing much we can use yet.”, Leo explains. 

“I’m going to need a minute.”, Ashton says. He has a thousand yard stare that tears at my heart. 

Probably as good of a place as any to end things for this week. 

Personally, I’m going to be scouring Reddit for some clarity on these things. Maybe I can find some other things Mike has gotten into, or even Eli. If anyone else wanted to help me in this, I’d be really grateful. 

Till then. 

Happy Sleuthing. 

Punch.
