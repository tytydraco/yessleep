Jelly-filled. Pink icing and rainbow sprinkles delicately blanketed the top of its exquisite, glistening mass. This delightfully devious little body made of sugar, fried dough, and strawberry-flavored goop tempted me to the point of no return. I pressed the tip of my index finger against the glass and said,

"This one."

I knew I shouldn't have. But I'd been so good lately. I deserved a treat. And besides, I'd make up for it at the gym later, then pound a fuck-ton of water and flush that bitch right out. Yeah, it's no big deal. It's Friday: cheat day. And this week's been hell. I *needed* this.

"That'll be $1.99, sir."

The lady at the counter smiled and handed me the bulging bag. I held it close, pressing its warm weight against my chest. My mouth pooled with saliva as I slid her my debit card. 

"Anything else?"

I glanced back toward the glass dome filled with plump pastries, then shook my head. They all looked like whores, slathered in chocolate and cheaply seductive—no substance. Nope, I had everything I needed right here in this greasy white paper bag. *Mine* had fruit. She handed my card back over and said, 

"Have a nice day!"

I grinned, looking down at the bag cradled in my arms. I sure as shit will, I thought. Then, I hurried back to my car to devour this goddess of a donut in seclusion. I needed privacy; this was a moment to be savored. Carefully, I eased my hand into the bag's opening until the tips of my fingers met her soft, pillowy posterior. Once I'd gripped onto the end, I gently pulled to reveal divine perfection. 

The icing lay undisturbed; every single sprinkle had held on. It didn't feel right to just go in at it. No, it was too beautiful to be ravaged like that. It begged to be adored and cherished—worshiped. I couldn't just bite into this donut like some sort of monster. The jelly would spill out all over, and I didn't have any napkins. 
 
I held it up to my face, admiring the flawless sheen of its glaze in the soft morning light. I inhaled deeply, slowly taking in the heavenly scent that filled me with euphoria. Then, I slid my tongue gently across the surface of its sweet, crispy skin. And that's where it all began. This simple little act of mindless self-indulgence would later become the single biggest regret of my life.

Yet, a smile crept across my face as the intense warmth of this magnificent exterior overwhelmed me. I had one thought, and one thought only: I needed to get to what was inside. Slowly, I sank my teeth deep into its sugary flesh, carefully removing the tiniest of morsels and releasing a floodgate of warm, red jelly. I let the intoxicating, chunky viscus pour into my mouth and surrendered to the ecstasy. 

After that, I blacked out.

When I came to, I'd devoured the whole thing. Not a trace of it remained; even my fingers had been licked clean and sucked dry. I searched the bag, hoping there might be a tiny smidge of icing left behind, but nothing. Not even a sprinkle. It was all gone. *Shit,* I don't even get to keep the memory of enjoying it? Why did I scarf it down so quickly? 

The only evidence that I'd even done so was the lump pressing hard at the back of my throat as the last bite of my breakfast made its way down my esophagus and onto the gullet. Guess I need to work on that whole *'self-control'* thing.

As I drove to work in my sugared-up intoxication, the lump began to squirm. Must be a burp trying to come out, I thought; probably swallowed a fuck ton of air during my binge-fit. I slammed my fist against my chest, but it didn't help. Instead, I could feel my throat tightening around the bulge, trying to push it down. No—the opposite. It felt like that hunk of donut was forcing its way down, in spite of my body trying to stop it. What the fuck. 

My eyes watered as I began to cough, choking on the wad of dough that had now firmly planted itself just above my sternum. The bitch wasn't moving at all. I struggled to keep my eyes on the road as I frantically searched the floor of my passenger seat for a half-empty bottle of water. Finally, I laid my hand on one, leaned my head back, and chugged. 

Down she went, without a fight. I smiled and threw the empty bottle back down onto the floor where it belonged. Then, I took a deep breath of relief. *God,* how stupid would it have been if I'd choked to death on a fucking donut? Embarrassing. I wiped my eyes and continued down the road. 

By the time I got to work, the donut had reached my stomach, landing like a boulder dropped off a cliff. I ran to the bathroom, thinking I had to take a shit. I sat in that stall straining for at least 10 minutes, but nothing came out. So, I stood up and pulled my pants back on. Then, I turned around and looked at the toilet. I froze. There, floating in the water, was a single blue sprinkle.

My eyes widened, and I blinked a few times. Then, I leaned forward to make sure I was really seeing what I thought I was. Yep—a sprinkle. Not a poop-sized one. A regular one. My body snapped upright. No fucking way that came out of my butt. It had to have been on my pants. I just didn't notice. Yeah, of course, that's what it was.

I walked from the bathroom laughing at myself for getting freaked out, even momentarily. My stomach was still killing me, though. The damn donut was sloshing around in the water I'd chugged like a ship caught in a storm. With each step I took, I could feel it rocking back and forth. 

*Gurgle, gurgle. Slosh, slosh.*

When I got to my desk, I started searching around in all the drawers for a roll of Tums. I got excited for a second, until I realized it was just the empty wrapper I'd left myself to be fooled by later. Past me is such an asshole. 

*Gurrrrrp!*

"Shut up."

Fuck. I had to do something, and quickly. My stomach was visibly rippling at that point, and I could barely stay seated. I thought about undoing my belt, but I didn't want to get accused of being a pervert. Especially not after I accidentally elbowed Sharon from accounting in the boob last week. That was her fault for crowding me at the coffee pot, though. Unfortunately, HR didn't see it that way.

Wait—coffee! That'll make me shit, I thought. Even though my stomach was past maximum capacity, it seemed like my only option. Besides, a shot of black coffee to the gut might just actually do the trick to move this mass along. The bitch had already overstayed her welcome. It was time for an eviction notice. 

I hurried to the break room to find Sharon at the coffee pot. *Of course.* I kept my distance as we silently exchanged awkward glances. I didn't want to look her in the eye, so I stared at the coffee pot in her hands instead. I was so uncomfortable. I could barely keep still as my gurgles and groans echoed through the otherwise empty room. She cut her pour short, grabbed a handful of Sweet'N Low packets, then rushed out of the door while covering her nose. *Pftt*—probably thought I was farting. Believe me, lady. I wish I *could* fart.

I poured a splash and a half into my cup and threw it back, still scalding. It burned all the way down, but I didn't care. The pain in my throat was a welcome distraction from the mayhem that was going on in my stomach. The roof of my mouth was going to be fucked for a day or two. But, I figured, if it worked, it would all be worth it. After all, this was my last-ditch effort to be able to make it through the rest of my workday. 

It also turned out to be a big mistake.

The searing black liquid landed with an eruption. I immediately doubled over in the worst pain I'd ever felt in my life. The wad of sugary dough had begun to thrash violently, slamming itself against the walls of my stomach. No, I'm not fucking joking. I could feel it. Not just in my stomach—with my hands, too. I literally felt this donut pounding from the inside out, lifting my skin as it pushed against its gastric prison. 

I ran full speed to the bathroom, praying I'd make it there before I passed out, vomited, or shit my pants. Or, all three. My belly bounced as I ran, suddenly swollen like a puppy with worms. I thought I was bloated before, but now I was literally about to pop. The movement made the pain infinitely worse, but I had no choice. Fuck this. It had to come out.

The stall door slammed against the wall, and I fell to my knees, gripping the toilet in preparation. My face was ice-cold and clammy. Warm saliva flooded my mouth. Yes! Come out! Be gone, bitch! 

*GUUURRRPPP*

I began to heave and spit into the toilet. The mass was so close I could taste it, but nothing was coming out. It was fighting me. I shoved my finger down into my throat, scraping against the burnt roof of my mouth. I winced from the pain, and my eyes started watering uncontrollably. A few gags, and up she came. 

A putrid flurry of pink sludge spewed from my mouth, swirled with a deep, crimson red foam. It splattered back up into my face when it hit the toilet at lightning speed. Fuck, so much came out of me, I can't even explain it. But that was only phase one. Next came the chunks. 

By the time I was done, I thought I was going to lose consciousness. The room was spinning, and I struggled to catch my breath, so I lowered myself onto the floor, still hugging the toilet. 

I couldn't help but inspect this ungodly force that had just come out of me. Slowly, I lifted my head and peeked over the seat. *Holy fuck.* I gazed down at the thick pink vomit in utter shock and disgust. Shit, it looked like I'd barely even chewed this donut. Even the rainbow sprinkles had all remained whole, floating around in the sludge like tiny specks of whimsy in a cotton candy-colored massacre. Surrounding them were a few large globs of fleshy beige, accompanied by several smaller red clumps. *Christ.* I just *had* to get the one with fruit, huh?

Suddenly, my eyes fixed on the largest red chunk floating in the middle of the sludge. It looked different than the other ones. Shaped weird. And it was... *moving?* I wiped my eyes. Yes—it was fucking moving! Convulsing. Constricting. Sputtering red goop from both ends. *No fucking way.*

I stood up so fast, I nearly fell backwards out of the stall. Black spots began to appear in my line of vision. I gripped onto the threshold with both hands as I swayed, trying to regain balance. I held my breath and slowly leaned forward to look again. It stopped.

Oh, thank God. It *wasn't* moving. Get it together, bro. It's just a chunk of strawberry; how could it be moving? I almost wanted to poke at it, but considering how vile the mess I'd made in the toilet was, I resisted that urge.

The hinges of the bathroom door creaked, and footsteps began to approach. I quickly reached over and flushed the rainbow sprinkled slurry. It smelled like death—sickly sweet with a hint of berry. I desperately tried to fan the stink away with one hand while wiping my face with the other.

When I exited the stall, Jerry from sales was at the urinal. He turned to look at me as I approached the sink, visibly disgusted by the pungent odor that had completely filled the room at that point.  

"Gnarly case of food poisoning," I told him. 

He nodded, then focused his eyes back in front of him. With a splash of water and a squirt of soap, I quickly washed my hands and ran out of there. On the way back to my desk, I bumped into my boss, who promptly asked what the hell I'd been doing all morning. 

"Sorry, sir. I think I'm coming down with something."

He folded his arms in front of him and scrunched his eyebrows. 

"That's the excuse you're going with this time?"

"Ask Jerry, he'll tell you. I was just in the bathroom. If you want proof, go in there and take a big whiff." 

"Alright, that's enough," he said. "Just make sure that report is on my desk before lunch, then you can leave if you need to. And don't forget, you're still on disciplinary probation after last week."

"Yes, sir."

Fuck. I forgot all about that damn report. I hadn't even started it yet, and it was almost 10:00. At least my stomach was starting to feel better. My abs were sore from all the heaving, but now that just meant I could skip the gym later. I'd already puked up the donut anyway, so the carbs didn't count. 

Shit, what a weird ass morning I was having—almost got killed by a donut twice. What an evil bitch! She tempted me, then tortured me. Well, lesson learned. Not going back to that bakery again. At least now she was gone, and it was over. 

I sat down at my desk, opened up a Word document, and began typing nonsense. My thoughts were all jumbled up, and my head was throbbing from straining so hard. I kept having to retype each sentence over and over until it made sense. Before I knew it, another hour had gone by, and I was sweating. 

My hand reached up to wipe away the droplets accumulating on the ridge of my brow. Right away, I noticed something weird. My sweat was thick. Like... *goop.* I slowly pulled my hand away in confusion to look at the substance that had just excreted from my pores. 

It was clear, like sweat's supposed to be. But there was a ton of it. And it didn't drip. No—instead, it gathered in a rounded clump at the edge of my fingertips. Then, I pressed my fingers together. It was sticky, too. *Oh, god.* I slowly raised my hand up to my lips and tasted. It was fucking *sugar.*

Okay... something weird is definitely going on. What the fuck was in that donut?! I had to leave work. Immediately. To hell with this damn report. I needed to go home and start googling. And also take a shower, because my face and hands were all sticky. Oh—and I still smelled like vomit, too. 

I got up and left everything on my desk as it was, including the open document of word salad on my computer screen. Hopefully, my boss would see all that and realize this was an emergency. If not, oh well, whatever. I'll just deal with it on Monday, I thought.

I raced home, taking a different route to avoid having to pass that bakery. I felt like just the sight of it might make me sick again. There had to be something wrong with that donut. I felt totally normal until I met that sugary bitch. Maybe it really was food poisoning. *Fuck*—the strawberries! E. coli, duh. *Damn*, should've gotten one of the whores; chocolate would've never betrayed me like that.

Food poisoning didn't exactly explain the sugary sweat, but I was still convinced that's what it was. Maybe I got so sick, I'd started hallucinating? Yeah, that *had* to be it. Ha! That donut wasn't actually thrashing in my stomach. The strawberry chunk wasn't ever moving. And the goopy sweat? Probably just some leftover glaze I didn't realize was there. *Pftt.* I shook my head and chuckled to myself. There was nothing to worry about. It'll pass.

I got home, threw my keys onto the side table, and headed straight for the bathroom. I decided to brush my teeth first. My breath was so rank I couldn't stand it anymore, and the taste of sugar and stomach acid still lingered on my tongue. I brushed the hell out of my entire mouth for at least 2 1/2 minutes, then spit into the sink. When I saw what had come out of my mouth, I almost choked. 

Sprinkles. A bunch of them. God, how did they all get stuck in my teeth like that? How did I not feel them? I cupped my hand under the faucet and rinsed my mouth out a few times. Each time I spit, more came out. It seemed to be an endless supply of them, like there was a God damned sprinkle dispenser somewhere behind my molars. But finally, after the fifth rinse, I ran my tongue across my teeth and didn't feel any more. So, I got into the shower and figured if anything else weird happened, I'd just worry about it then.

Then, something else weird happened.

I turned the hot water on, stepped under the stream, closed my eyes and began running my hands across my skin. My entire body felt tacky and gross. I reached up to find that my hair felt the same way—it had formed into five or six clumps on the top of my head. *Yuck.* Instantly, I pulled my hand away and opened my eyes to grab the shampoo bottle. That's when I noticed it. 

The water that was dripping from my body was milky white. *What the fuck?* I jumped back from the shower head and looked up. The water coming out of it was clear. I scrunched my eyebrows, then slowly looked back down. The thick, milky drippings had started to collect in a pile, clogging up the drain. 

I tried to slide the clump away with my foot, only to have it spread itself in between my toes, like when you step on a glob of peanut butter. It sent a shiver down my spine, and I started flapping my foot around trying to fling the goop off of it, but it wasn't moving. So, I reached down to dislodge whatever it was by hand. Just then, I was hit with an oddly familiar scent. The same one that had filled the air of that bakery. *Sugar.* 

*Jesus H. Christ*—did I try to fuck it?! Just how much icing did I smear on myself? Shit, I must've rubbed that fucking donut all over my body. Hell no, man. I've done some weird shit in my life, but never with food. That thing must've been drugged! 

My hand shot up to my forehead, and my eyes raced back and forth as I desperately tried to remember anything at all from the ten minutes or so I had blacked out. Nothing. Not a damn thing. God, I *had* to have been slipped something. That was the only explanation that made sense.

My heart started pounding and I began to feel woozy. I was obviously under the influence of some type of drug, but I had no idea what. I quickly washed my hair, then grabbed the loofah and started frantically scrubbing my body from the top down. 

When I reached my butt, I used my hand to wash in between my cheeks since the loofah's too rough. I was immediately disgusted to find there were little specks of something buried deep within my ass crack. 

I didn't even need to look—I knew what they were. But still, there I was, gawking down at my hand in complete and utter shock nonetheless. Sprinkles. At least a dozen or more. 

I was ashamed and completely disgusted with myself. I couldn't believe I'd actually scratched my ass while eating that donut! Shit, hopefully I waited until after I was finished. But, either way, that meant my fingers were... and then I... Oh, *God.* 

Whatever—nothing I could do about it now. I rinsed the butt sprinkles from my hand, then continued down to my legs. They were dry. Like, *really* dry. I'm talking sandpaper. Large flakes of my skin started to slough off as I scrubbed, plopping onto the shower floor like tiny, wet crepes. 

I've never been good about moisturizing, and to be honest, I usually don't even wash anything below the knees, but today I had to. They must've just been overdue for a good exfoliating, I thought. 

Once I got out and toweled myself off, I noticed my upper body felt waxy and smooth. Too smooth. It was like a slight, buttery layer of film sitting on top of my skin. My bottom half was the opposite. I thought all those skin flakes coming off would've helped, but my legs still looked extremely dry—almost scaly. I dropped the towel and reached down with my bare hand. When my fingers touched one of the flaked-off portions of my calf, my heart sank. My skin... it felt *crispy.*

Hell no—I am *not* dealing with this right now. I'll just lotion them later if they still feel rough when I sober up. I shook my head, then leaned forward over the sink to look into the mirror. My pupils were enormous, and a fresh coat of glaze covered my face with a lustrous, glossy sheen. 

*Shit... you're tripping balls, man.*

There was nothing I could do but try to wait it out. If I went to the hospital and started explaining my '*symptoms*', I'd be fitted for a brand new pair of grippy socks in a heartbeat. No. There was no need to panic. I just needed to let whatever the hell drug this was wear off. Run its course. Yeah, it's no big deal. It'll be okay.

I thought sleep would be the answer. So, I hurried off to my bedroom and started covering all the windows with dark blankets to block out the midday sun as best I could. I didn't even bother putting clothes back on—I figured I'd end up sweating like a pig during this detox anyway. No need to dirty another pair of underwear. 

By the time I'd finished blacking out the room, I was already starting to feel like I was burning up. It was like an oven had suddenly kicked on inside me. I plopped myself down onto the bed, splayed out like a starfish, and waited. 

First, the nausea returned. I had to close my eyes to stop the ceiling from spinning. Then, the heat within me intensified. This fierce burning sensation started to tear through my body, radiating deep from my core. *Oh, God.* It was almost unbearable. I clenched onto the bedsheet underneath me with both fists and tried desperately to control my breathing. A buzzing sensation began to spread through my body, like every cell inside me vibrating all at once. My eyes rolled into the back of my head, and the room went black. 

When I woke up, the slivers of sunlight that had been peering out from the sides of the blankets were gone. My eyes darted over to the little red numbers piercing through the darkness of my room. It was 5:00 AM. *Jesus Christ*, I'd slept the entire rest of the day and all through the night. 

I remained still for a moment, trying to assess my mental and physical state, praying everything had gone back to normal. The nausea had passed, but my body was still burning up. My mouth was unbelievably dry, and the air in my room felt stagnant and heavy. It seemed to push down from above like a weighted blanket—smothering me. I forced in a deep breath, and when I did, I noticed the smell. That fucking *smell.*

However, it wasn't until I attempted to reach up and wipe my face that I began to truly realize the horror I'd woken up to. My arm. It wouldn't move—it was stuck to the bed. The other one, too. And... and my legs. *What the fuck??* My head shot up in a panic, and the pillow came with it.

When I looked down at my body, my jaw dropped open. I was huge. I'm talking gigantic. Bloated, puffy, and round beyond belief. I'd gone from a size 34 pants to at least a 52. Not even joking. It was like I'd gained a hundred pounds overnight. I couldn't believe it. This couldn't be happening. I'd slept almost 20 hours—the drug should've worn off!

As I glared down in shock, I could see that my now rotund upper body was caked in a thick, opaque layer of pasty goop. It had dripped and clung to the bed, sticking to the skin of my back and arms like a human glue trap. 

From the waist down, I was surrounded by a large, dark red stain on the sheets. Is that—? *No. Can't be.* I blinked a few times, then squinted as my eyes strained to adjust. The mystery red liquid had dried to a crust at the edges, forming a giant congealed mass beneath me. 

I struggled to lift myself up further, forcing my neck forward as hard as I could. Then, I gave myself one good push. As my body squished against itself, more of the thick red goo suddenly appeared... oozing… from my fucking belly button.

The secretion slowly slid from the side of my stomach into the pile below, landing with a wet *plap.* Instinct took over, and I started to thrash and writhe against the bed, desperate to free myself from this disgusting, sticky goop from hell. 

Peeling my top half from the sheets felt like ripping off a massive band-aid. Thick white strings clung to me as the gummy substance stretched and pulled at my skin, trying to force me back down. I bit down hard on my bottom lip and just went for it. I'll admit it—I screamed. Screamed like a bitch. 

Once my arms were free, I moved on to my legs. The red stuff was worse. Much thicker, less give. It was agonizing. Huge, crispy strips of flesh tore from my legs, remaining glued to the clotted red mess that had leaked from my unrecognizably grotesque body. After I'd completely broken free from my adhesive prison, I hobbled to the bathroom, dripping the entire way. 

I stared at myself in the mirror, my gargantuan, sugar-slathered body shaking uncontrollably. *Fuck*. I shouldn't have just gone to sleep. I should have dealt with this when I had the chance. That donut wasn't drugged, it was cursed. Something in it. A demon—possessing me. Changing me. It had hollowed me out and was growing inside me.

I collapsed onto the cold floor and buried my face in my hands as I began to cry. Not tears, of course. Instead of droplets of wetness, I felt little taps of grit. I ripped my hands away from my eyes. 

Sprinkles. Rainbow fucking sprinkles. 

An animalistic shriek erupted from my lungs, and I hurled them across the room. They hit the wall with a *ping*, scattering all over the floor like confetti at my funeral. Mocking me. 

I pulled myself back up to my feet, limped over to the shower, and got in. I scrubbed, wincing in pain as the loofah scraped against my raw skin. To distract myself, I started trying to weigh my options. I couldn't ignore this anymore. I knew I needed help, desperately. I just didn't know who to turn to. Shit, doctors wouldn't know what to do with me at this point—whatever was happening to me had very quickly devolved into something modern medicine couldn't do shit about. 

I thought about calling my cousin, Sonia, in Maine. Her husband had gone through some weird body shit recently. Maybe she'd know what to do. She'd been vague about the details of what happened to him when she told me about it a few months ago. Something about fish? What I did remember was she had been very clear about one thing: it didn't end well. 

Scratch that. If she couldn't help him, she definitely couldn't help me either. I gripped the loofah tighter, my body trembling from the pain and fear. I had to do something. I couldn't allow myself to crumble under the weight of my insane circumstance. I refused to let this *thing* take over. 

I shuffled out of the tub, almost slipping on the pink sludge I'd left behind as I lifted my massive, jiggly leg over the side. I carefully dried myself off, soaking up the leftover glaze from my creases. Then, I shakily began trying to bandage up the gaping wounds on my legs.

They were oozing the same shit that had come out of my belly button. I set a piece of gauze down on top of one of the rips in my flesh, and the redness seeped through instantly. It wasn't blood. Deep down, I already knew that. Still, I reached down, scooped up a dollop with my fingers, and sniffed it. *Strawberry.*

Whatever the fuck was happening to me, I was powerless to stop it alone. There was only one thing left I could do. So, I threw a blanket over my half-glazed naked body, since none of my clothes fit anymore, then scuttled out to my car and began tearing down the street—headed toward that fucking bakery.

The door slammed against the wall with a loud bang as I busted through. The stupid little bell dislodged and went sliding across the floor. The place was empty, except for the lady behind the counter. She looked up at me and smiled. 

"Welcome back! Did you enjoy your donut, sir?"

I just stood there in the doorway for a moment, completely dumbfounded, as her smile widened into a sinister, toothy grin. Did I *enjoy* the donut? The sheer audacity of this woman. There I was, shaped like a fucking eclair, covered in only a blanket and dripping red goop everywhere. I sure as shit did not.  A fiery rage began to simmer within me. And then, I exploded.

*"WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO THAT DONUT?!?!”*

She laughed. 

"Why, nothing, sir. Nothing at all."

"Bullshit! What the fuck is happening to me?!" I demanded. 

"Exactly what was meant to happen," she answered. 

"You cursed it! *Christ,* I fucking knew it!! What is this, huh? Some kinda donut voodoo shop?!"

She shook her head and chuckled dismissively.  

"Sir, I just sell the donuts. I don't make them." 

I stormed up to the counter and threw the sticky blanket down onto the ground, revealing the gruesome form I was now trapped inside of.  

"I don't give a shit who makes them! I want to know why the hell this is happening to my body!!" 

"Isn't it obvious?" she giggled. "You are what you eat." 

I slammed my fist down onto the counter.

"I want to see your fucking manager, NOW!"

"Of course, sir. Right this way."

She calmly stepped away from the register and gestured for me to follow her to the back of the bakery. I stomped down the long, sterile, white hallway as she casually led the way, glancing over her shoulder every so often with a smirk. I didn't know what I was going to say when I got to wherever we were going, but I needed answers—and this bitch apparently wasn't going to tell me jack shit. 

We reached a large door at the end of the hall with a sign that said '*MDI*' in big, bold, red letters. It was fitted with a padlock and a keypad near the handle. The lady pulled out a set of keys and fiddled with them while I waited impatiently. Finally, she opened the lock, unlatched the door, then hovered over the keypad as she punched the numbers in. A loud beep pierced through the silence, and the door slowly squealed open. 

Inside that room was the most incomprehensible horror I could've ever dared to imagine. A being so grotesque—so shocking. It froze me in place as I struggled to make sense of the unholy sight before me. 

It filled the entire room. Not only in size, but in presence. It felt ancient. And powerful. Something beyond this world... this universe. I was in awe, and yet, overwhelmed with revulsion at what I was forced to behold.

Thick, pulsating lines of bulging, red jelly snaked around doughy coils of glossy, beige flesh like veins. Layers of soured pink icing dripped from beneath a heap of encrusted rainbow sprinkles embedded firmly atop its hideous, glistening mass. This sickeningly enormous body made of sugar, fried dough, and strawberry-flavored goop terrified me to my absolute core. 

It had no eyes—just mouths. Dozens upon dozens of perfectly round gaping holes stretched across the front of it, each filled with rows of tiny, sharp, crystalline teeth that sparkled under the heat lamps above. 

And, it breathed. The coils slowly lifted and fell like folds in a stomach, as gurgling globs of chunky red viscera sputtered from the center. Steam radiated from its crispy posterior. Each time it shifted, the smell of sugar and yeast filled the air. Suffocatingly sweet and warm with rot. 

Suddenly, the door slammed shut behind me. I tore my eyes away from the monstrosity to look at the counter lady, who was now standing in front of the door, blocking my only way out. 

"*What the fuck is that?*" I uttered with wide eyes. 

She narrowed her gaze, and the smile dropped from her face.

"Mother Donut calls to us all... and we answer." 

I turned to look back at the oozing, demonic atrocity. 

"*This?* This is what I'm turning into?!" 

"No, don't be ridiculous," she said. "This is what created you. And those who came before you. Go on—speak to her. Ask your questions." 

I gulped hard as I looked up at this sugary mammoth towering over me, then finally mustered up the courage to ask, 

"What's happening to me? What... *am* I?"

The plethora of holes began to move in unison as the bellowing growl of a hundred voices emitted from the effulgent mass at once. 

"You are my offspring. My sweet creation. And from within you, my seed shall spread."

Blackness crept in from the corners of my vision as I zeroed in on this ungodly creature. I was no longer afraid. I was furious. I'd been infected with some sort of parasitic donut spawn? And for what—all because I just wanted to enjoy my cheat day? What kind of horse shit is that?? It wasn't fair... I deserved a treat!

"No, the fuck it will not!" I screamed. "You better undo this shit right now! Fix me back like I was or..." 

My voice began to crack with desperation. 

"Or, I'll fucking kill you!! I didn't sign up for this shit, man! It... it was just a God damned donut!"

Giant, red bubbles suddenly spewed from her center mass like lava from a volcano. They popped and splattered my face with piping hot, rotten jelly as a guttural laugh vibrated from the mouths. 

"It cannot be undone," she said. "The transformation is nearly complete, my child." 

"Please... *oh, God*... no!" I begged. "I don't deserve this!!"

She growled. 

"You chose this. You agreed to it. The terms of purchase were stated clearly on the receipt you left behind on the counter without a glance." 

The room went dead silent. I was too late. Too stupid. Too fucking self-indulgent and careless to prevent my own demise. There was nothing I could do—nothing left to say. It was time to deal with this. Time to face the facts. I was fucked. 

Sprinkles began to trickle down my face. The oven inside me suddenly shot up to 350 degrees. I bolted towards her—full speed, fists wailing. If I was going down, this bitch was coming with me. 

Just before I reached her, I felt a sudden, sharp pain in the back of my head. I fell backward, and my body hit the ground instantly with a massive thud. I looked up and saw the counter lady standing over me, now blurry, and holding a rolling pin. Then... darkness, and the faint echo of a wet, bubbling laugh. 

When I awoke, I couldn't move, but I could see. My eyes darted all around. I was no longer in the lair of the beast. Instead, I was in a white room, surrounded by a warm, fuzzy, bright light. Everything looked soft and inviting. Placid. Peaceful. Perfect. I thought I had died. I thought maybe I was in heaven. I couldn't have been more wrong. 

*BAM!!!!!*

A giant fingertip slammed down from above, pressing hard against some sort of invisible forcefield around me. It was... it was *glass*. I was under a fucking glass dome—lying next to a chocolate whore. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. Panic surged through my jelly-filled veins.

I was paralyzed. Powerless. Positively petrified. My strawberry heart thrashed hard against my pink-slathered, rainbow-sprinkled chest as a booming voice rattled the tray beneath me. 

It said,

"This one."
