Welfare checks.



People think cops hate bar fights, and drunks, and domestic violence calls. I'll take those anytime At least you know what you’re walking into. Welfare checks are worse. Nine times out of ten it's usually nothing. The tenth time, it’s something you can't forget.



This one was at the Red Pines Motor Lodge, by the freeway. You've seen the type: neon sign with half the letters not working, empty pool, long since filled with dirt, parking lot that looks like it's been through a war. 



The clerk was waiting outside when I pulled up. Skinny kid, shirt buttoned wrong, pale like he hadn’t slept.



"Room six", he said, voice cracking. "The guy checked in two nights ago, only paid for one. I knocked, no answer. Stinks. Real bad".



“Bad how?” I asked, though I already knew.



He rubbed his hands down his jeans. "Like… meat left out".



The stairwell groaned under my boots. The second-floor walkway swayed a little with my weight. Room six was halfway down, blinds pulled tight.



I knocked. "Police. Sir, I need you to open the door".



No answer.



I knocked harder. The door pushed inward. Not locked.



The smell hit me in the chest.



Inside looked normal enough. Bed made. TV off. Untouched bible on the nightstand. And then, just next to the dresser, there was a suitcase.



Zipper strained. Carpet beneath it darker than the rest. Something had leaked.



I crouched, tugged the zipper.



The body came spilling out.



Not falling. Spilling. Like the suitcase had been full of water and someone cut it open. Limbs folded flat, ribs collapsed inward, organs mashed like pressed cloth. Skin gray, stretched too smooth.



I've seen crash victims, burn bictims, OD victims, gun victims, hell even amputation victims. This was different. This was wrong.



I backed up hard, almost hit the bedframe. Brought my radio up, voice shaking more than I like to admit. Called it in. Tried to breathe through my sleeve, but the stink was in the air, in the walls, in me.



And then I heard it.



From the doorway, soft, like someone scraping their throat.



"Help me".



I turned. Hall was empty. Doors shut. Nothing.



I told myself it was the wind. Or the clerk. Anything. 



I pulled the curtain an inch. Parking lot was quiet, the road loaming beyond. Cars slowing, drivers gawking. Normal.



And across the street, I saw him. Standing by the curb, coffee cup in hand. Watching.



He wasn't rubbernecking, or morbidly curious. Just standing there, with his eyes fixed on the motel like he couldn’t look away.



I let the curtain fall, tried not to look at the body spreading wider on the carpet. Called again for backup, louder.



When I peeked out again, the man was still there.



Later, when CSU packed the body and the clerk had given his statement, I crossed the road. Needed to log the bystander, make sure he wasn’t more than that.



Up close, he looked a little younger than me. Dark jacket, dark hair, tired in the eyes. Coffee cup still in his hand, long gone cold.



I flashed my badge. "You live around here?"



He nodded toward the apartment complex behind him. "Second floor. My kitchen looks right at that row of rooms. Hard not to notice when a cruiser pulls up".



His voice was steady, but I caught the edge under it, the kind you get when you’re trying not to admit to yourself you’re rattled.



"Did you see anything this morning?” I asked.



“Not this morning.” He shifted his weight. "Last night, though. Lights were off, but I thought I saw someone moving around in that room. Shadow against the curtain. Figured maybe I imagined it".



I wrote it down. Didn’t tell him the guy in the suitcase had been dead longer than that shadow made sense.



He looked at me, a little sharper. "I know this is gonna sound weirs officer, but.. was there someone in?”



I didn’t answer. Not fully. Just said, "We’re investigating"



He gave me a look, the kind people give when they know you’re holding something back. Then he drained the last of his cold coffee like he needed something to do with his hands.



“Name?” I asked.



"Marco Bianchi"



It sat easy, like he’d said it a million times.



I wrote it in my notebook, but the thought that stuck with me wasn’t the name. It was the way he’d been staring at the motel before. Not curious. Not shocked.



Just… like he already knew what I’d find inside Room 6.
