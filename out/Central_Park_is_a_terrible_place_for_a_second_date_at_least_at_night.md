I stood under the white light of the globe streetlamp, watching the leaves swirl in circles on the gravel path. It had almost been 20 minutes. I didn’t mind waiting if I knew he was coming, but he hadn’t messaged for a while. I’d insisted on meeting somewhere busier but apparently the park was close to his house. During the day Central Park would’ve been a nice place for a second date. At 10pm however, it was starting to feel like a bad idea. I pushed the thought out of my mind. My flatmate knew I was here, and she was expecting me back at midnight unless I messaged. Besides, Adam was a really nice guy, maybe a little quiet but funny and a great kisser. I assumed he wanted to be close to his house to ask me back, and depending on how things went tonight, I would go. It was getting a little cold now, so I pulled my scarf tight around my neck and shuddered. The trees above me whispered and swayed. The noise sent a shiver down my spine, and I pulled out my cell phone.

&#x200B;

*Hey Adam. I’ve been here for almost half an hour, and it’s pitch black. Are you going to be here soon? I’m starting to feel like I’m in a horror movie lol. :P*

&#x200B;

I decided that I’d wait another 5 minutes and head back if he didn’t show in that time. At least somewhat comforting was the light from the carousel on my right, a beacon in the otherwise blackened landscape. I walked a couple dozen yards to stand under the warm yellow glow. This definitely felt off. Adam could be the nicest guy on the planet, I still didn’t know him well enough to be meeting him like this. With that thought I’d made up my mind, I wasn’t staying around to find out if he was a serial killer. The gravel crunched underfoot as I turned to walk away. I got about three paces in before my cell began to ring. It was Adam. ‘Hey Emma, I know I’ve taken ages. Really sorry. I walked a route that I’d never usually go and got myself lost. Is that you I see stood by the carousel?’

I stood there for a minute unsure of what to say. I had just been about to ghost him after all. ‘Adam! I thought you weren’t coming, was just about to leave actually.’

‘Oh. Oh Emma, I feel terrible. I hope I haven’t weirded you out now. Is that you I see stood by the carousel?’ There was a long pause where I weighed my options. I could run towards the nearest park exit, but I had no clue where he stood in the darkness. He knew I had a flatmate, so I could tell him that she was waiting to pick me up, or I could trust that he was a good person. Screw trust, I needed to get out of there.

‘This is kind of awkward… Amy is waiting in her car not far away. I asked her to come pick me up after you didn’t show. I know we’ve both been looking forward to this all week, but I really should go…’I’d started walking quickly as I was talking, there’s no way I was taking any chances. I was getting nervous now, it was clear in my voice. ‘But uh… call o-or message me when you get home so I kn-‘ I stopped speaking suddenly. On the other line I could hear Adam’s breathing getting heavier along with the rapid crunch of leaves. He was running towards me. I couldn’t tell where he was yet, I only knew he was closing in on me. ‘Adam, if this is a joke, I’m not enjoying it. Cut it out.’

&#x200B;

I was sprinting now too. The park exit was probably 300 metres away, I kept telling myself I’d be out in less than a minute and onto the busy Manhattan street. He couldn’t do anything to me then, not without drawing attention to himself. The phone was still pressed up to my ear, Adam’s panting was much louder than before. I lowered it to listen for the direction his footsteps were coming from. I could hear him now, probably 100 feet behind and getting closer. Adrenaline coursed through my veins. I was near enough to the road to hear the traffic now, maybe 150 metres away. I tore down the footpath faster, lungs burning and eyes watering. 100 metres. 80 metres. I tried dialling 911 as I ran. 50 metres. The cell slipped from my grip as I typed the last digit and clattered to the floor. I continued running. 15 metres. I was almost free. He was so close to me now that his outstretched arm would almost reach my ponytail. I let out an ear-piercing scream as I reached the bright lights of the sidewalk.

&#x200B;

Adam backed into the darkness of the park. I turned and stood horrified, as his silhouette shrank away. I watched still as he headed towards my phone, the light still emanating from the upturned screen. There was nothing I could do now.To my left an elderly woman’s raspy voice called out from along the sidewalk. ‘Hey Hon, are you okay? What’s got you screaming like that? We’re waiting for the bus. You can stay with us a little while if you’d like.’ The woman and her aging husband walked towards me.

‘I’m okay now thank you, maybe you could call the cops? There’s a man in the park, he was chasing me.’

‘Of course Honey.’ The old lady pulled me into a protective hug and stared into the park entrance. ‘There are some horrid people out there, you just make sure you stay safe.’

&#x200B;

The couple waited with me until the police arrived and then clambered onto the next bus. I was asked what I had been doing in the park at that time and offered a description of Adam. One officer promised that the park rangers would be thoroughly searching the area and checking CCTV for any clues. In the meantime, he told me that all they could do was drive me home. I felt humiliated from the encounter, and silently climbed into the back of the cop car.

&#x200B;

As we pulled up to the house, the officer asked if Adam knew my address. ‘Uh, no I never told him.’ I replied bluntly. ‘Well then. If you feel safe you can head on inside. Call us if you have any more problems.’ I hopped out of the car and put my keys in the front door. I could hear talking inside. Great, Amy had someone over. The last thing I want to do right now is talk to anyone. I walked into the kitchen and froze. Amy stood there smiling, talking with a man who’s back was turned. ‘Oh, you finally decided to join us! I was getting worried about you, and you dropped your phone. Good thing Adam found it and knew to call me.’ The tall man turned around and smiled an unnatural grin that didn’t reach the eyes. Adam…
