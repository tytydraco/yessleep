I work with a package delivery service to make an extra buck or two since I’m a college student in some need for cash. I work minimum wage at around $15 an hour in New York, but I was looking for way to earn some more cash to buy some fun things like new video games that are coming out soon, as well as treating myself to a nice dinner every once in a while instead of having the bland mush I get from my meal plan.

I spoke to my supervisor about it and he asked me if I was willing to do anything to get some extra cash, in a very weird tone.

I said yes, albeit nervously, and was told to stay after hours to talk about a potential opening that is very lucrative for someone of any age.

Fast forward to later that night, I’m sitting outside on the curb of the store, smoking a cigarette, when my boss pokes his head out and tells me to come inside and to go to the back of the store.

I did as I was told and met him, we went outside the back of the store, where I saw a dirt trail I don’t think I ever saw before.

He’s cut right to the chase and told me that this position pays $1,000 per delivery, and all I had to do was take this package (which he had tucked under his arm), and walk it to the very end of that trail.

I thought this was awesome, super fast money by delivering one box? I told him to sign me up.

He handed me the package as well as a long note attached to the box itself.

He explained that there are a few rules that I needed to follow in order to do the job right, and… safely.

I, now back to being concerned said ok, as he walked back into the store and locked the door behind him.

I looked down back at the box. It was relatively small, and light, as if there was nothing inside it…

The note read as followed:


Valued Employee,

As you are about to see, this path is not normal. During the day it may seem as such, but nightfall reveals otherwise. A gate that sits between our dimension and another will open, and a very specific set of rules MUST be followed in order for you to complete your delivery.

I thought to myself “What the hell is this cryptic shit?” I kept reading:

Please Read and Memorize:

1. Always walk at a steady pace, do not speed up or slow down at an abnormal rate.

2. Be sure to ALWAYS bring a flashlight.
    •If it starts to flicker, REPLACE THE BATTERIES IMMEDIATELY.

3. By no means should you speak throughout the journey unless directly prompted by Rule 6.

4. If you hear unintelligible whispers behind you, DO NOT LOOK. (They will disappear eventually)

5. If you hear a friend or family member call for you in the distance:
    •DO NOT LOOK IN THE DIRECTION OF ORIGIN
    •DO NOT ENGAGE WITH THE VOICE IN ANY WAY
    •If you feel you must look, COVER YOUR EYES WHILE DOING SO.

6. If an ordinary looking person emerges out from the woods and asks where the nearest town is, DO NOT MAKE EYE CONTACT, state this exact phrase: “It’s back the way you came” in a monotone voice, while looking straight ahead.
    •On rare occasions when they ask you to guide them, KEEP WALKING, DO NOT FOLLOW THEM, NOR SPEAK TO THEM ANY LONGER.

7. You will have something follow you constantly through out your journey, however, if the being in question attempts to gain your attention by stepping on a twig or leaf of some kind, LOOK OVER YOUR LEFT SHOULDER, NEVER YOUR RIGHT.
    •If you accidentally look over your right, no matter what you see, how big or small, or how close or far, try not to make any sudden facial expressions. DO NOT SCREAM BY ANY MEANS. Calmly face back forward and continue walking normally.

8. If you see a sign indicating a Dead End or to Turn Back, promptly ignore them.

9. If you see a wall or barrier of any kind, it is not real. Walk through it at the same pace you were walking prior to discovery.

10. You will rarely see Unknown, (otherwise known as “Shadowy”) figures walking towards you, as long as you do not become panicked by them, you will be fine.

11. If you hear:
    1. Bloodcurdling Screaming
    2. Demonic Gibberish
    3. Sinister Laughter
    4. Heavy footsteps quickly approaching

DO NOT LOOK BEHIND YOU AND RUN FOR YOUR LIFE.

IF YOU TRIP, STOP FOR ANY REASON, OR LOOK BEHIND YOU, YOUR BRAIN WILL BE UNABLE TO PROCESS THE HORRORS AND YOU WILL “CEASE TO BE” OUT OF PURE SHOCK. 

If you by some chance survive, get ready! You must prepare yourself to endure a horrific mind warping experience of [ R E D A C T E D ].

12. Once you reach the end of the path, you will hear a child crying behind you, turn around slowly ONLY WHEN YOU PASS THE STONE TOTEM; this indicates that you have vacated the affected area of the gate and you are now back in your designated dimension, and one of the three following scenarios will occur:
    
1. If you see a normal looking child crying, DO NOT HELP THEM, this means that you may take the path once more tomorrow night.
    
2. If you see a normal looking crying child approaching you, blink three times to make them disappear, the child will be replaced with a rotary phone that will almost immediately ring after the child’s disappearance, DO NOT ANSWER IT and carry on with your evening activities.
    
3. If the air falls silent and the child stares at you with dark eyes, blood replacing their tears and an impossibly wide smile, DO NOT TAKE THE PATH EVER AGAIN.
(Note: Notify your supervisor with photographic evidence to be placed into a different department).

We thank you for your sacrifice in aiding your fellow peers of the Pozal-Go family in this top secret delivery assignment, and wish you the best of luck on your journey!

Sincerely,
Pozal-Go Corporate

I thought that this was some sort of sick joke that was being played on me, but just as I was about to turn around, I stopped dead in my tracks, since I thought I heard the sound of whispering coming behind me.
