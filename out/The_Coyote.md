I always liked nature. Be it long walks in the woods, hiking, sitting out in my yard as the sun rises. You name it. If I was able to be outside while doing it, then I was happy. Well, that’s how I used to be, anyways. Something happened to me about a month ago that changed my outlook on it.

One of my go-to’s for getting out of the house was a long drive followed by a walk in woods I wasn’t familiar with. Key word; familiar. I would have a map and layout of the area, of course, but it wasn’t like a trail I walked on every day.

That’s the thing with a ritual you do every day—you start to notice details others don’t. That trapezoidal shaped piece of concrete at the end of the sidewalk near the gas station, the stain on the tree leading into the woods that just won’t go away no matter how many chemicals are scrubbed on it. In uncharted territory, you know where you are, but you don’t *know* where you are.

That was my situation. About an hour’s drive west from my house are some woods. I won’t be disclosing the name here as I don’t want anyone to be stupid enough as to try and go there right after reading this. Trust me when I say that it is a bad idea.

After filling up my bag with various articles of clothing, water bottles and granola bars, I was ready to set off to a new place and put another feather in my nature cap. Flashlight, I grabbed a flashlight as well. I’d done the math and figured that leaving at 1 would get me there by 2, let me walk around for 2 hours, take an hour to get back and have it all done before 5:30. In the P.M, in case there was any confusion.

Just as I’d thought, I ended up pulling onto a small patch of dirt just off the road at 2–on the dot. “Nice, made it in time.” I thought. “Alright, time to get up and out there.” I closed my car door, grabbed my bag and pulled out the little map I had acquired for basic navigation.

It wouldn’t be very easy to get lost in these woods, but one look at the leaves on the trees told me they were thick enough that this place would get DARK when evening came. It wasn’t a bit deal—I thought—I’d make it home before then. I thought.

Just before the woods, there were two small fence posts. One of them had a small sign with the name of the forest on it.

As I crossed the threshold and entered the woods, a small feeling of awe and wonder overtook me. The foliage was thick enough that it cast a large shadow across the entirety of the forest that I could see with my naked eye. There were breaks in the leaves where little pinpricks of light came through.

About half an hour into my walk, I began to feel thirsty and hungry. Luckily for me, I had just come upon a small creek. There was a small rock just before the water that I could sit on, so I did.

I didn’t hear much other than the running of the water and general nature sounds around me as I ate. I didn’t really end up hearing anything in general, actually. It was what I saw that weirded me out a bit.

On the path next to me, there was another set of footprints. From the point where they met the creek and onwards, they looked to be animalistic—canine prints. “Woah, cool.” I muttered, looking up from the prints and out at the path. “Where’d you go?”

I wasn’t sure what animal had made these prints; it was a canine for sure, but what *kind* of canine? I kept scanning the dirt until I found a paw print clean and recognizable enough to look up. Eventually, I found one.

As it would turn out, the prints I found were that of a coyote. I didn’t know that they were in these woods, but I wasn’t scared. I could very easily make myself look big and scary to put them off, so I wasn’t very concerned.

What did boggle my mind a little were the shoe prints. There was another set in addition to mine, but they’d stopped at some point—right where the coyote prints began.

“Maybe—maybe they went another way?” I asked nobody. “That is weird, though.” I didn’t pay it much mind; whatever this was, it couldn’t have been completely unexplainable. Someone stopped just before crossing the creek, saw something weird, and got out of there.

As I crossed the creek and turned around one last time, I saw something even stranger.

“There aren’t any footprints going back.”

I pressed on. A small knot of nervousness had formed in the pit of my stomach and—while it wasn’t getting bigger—it certainly wasn’t going away either. Why did the prints change? Did they take their shoes off? No, that wasn’t right. A normal person wouldn’t make prints like that with their bare feet.

And a person couldn’t possibly turn into a coyote, right? And the other way around, too. It had to be that they just turned around and went a different way. That’d explain the lack of prints going in the opposite direction. For something I deemed so unimportant, I really couldn’t stop thinking about it.

I was glad when the first drop of rain came an hour into the walk. It would have been 3. One drop turned to two, two turned to four and so on. Nearly a minute after the first drop had landed on my hand, it had become a much more intense downpour. I was surprised at just how much was making it through the leaves, but my main focus now was finding a place to take shelter from the storm.

My shoes were soaked and so was my bag. The cloths on my back were still somewhat dry, but it wouldn’t be long until they followed my shoes and bag. It had gotten dark at this point as well. “Jesus.” I said, holding my hand over my head so I’d have a clear view. “The hell happened to the weather?” This was most certainly not in the forecast, but oh well.

I nearly missed it. And I’m a little surprised about that, because—even in the rain—it stood out like a sore thumb. A cabin. It was a cabin right here in the middle of the woods. I suppose it wasn’t all that strange; I’ve been on several hikes in different forests and people have had small cabins there too. My grandad even had one in some Colorado woods before he sold it. Point is; it didn’t surprise me all that much.

If there was already a family residing in that cabin, then they’d have to end up dealing with me too. I’d apologize, but they were going to let me in… or give me a blanket. As fate would have it, I didn’t end up needing to do that. The front door to the cabin was left hanging open. Not broken—just open, like whoever had lived there before just left.

Just outside of the cabin was one of those old metallic chairs. Super uncomfortable.

I took my opportunity and went in. My first course of action was to close and latch the door. I scanned the cabin afterwards. There was a main area that had a kitchen, couch and television. There were two rooms on the front left and front right end of the cabin too. A bedroom and a bathroom.

Right next to the television was a wood stove, but there wasn’t any firewood.

On the counter, there was what looked like a lantern. I saw a small crank at the top and breathed a sigh of relief. I wouldn’t have to do any of the prep for an actual lantern and I wouldn’t need to find batteries.

I cranked it on and sunk into the couch. I still had plenty of granola bars and water, so food wasn’t an issue. Not something to make a big deal out of. What was a big deal was the journal next to me on the couch.

I almost didn’t see it—the book had been nestled between the couch cushions, but a corner of the top was sticking out. I grabbed it and began to read. It was a bunch of entries. They were recent, too. I began reading, because what else could I do?

**September**

*It’s too far to walk. Too far when* ***it*** *is out there. Dad told me that it would be fine. That we would just wait until the day and then make our escape. Otto got out earlier tonight. I wanted so badly to go out and find him but dad wouldn’t let me. “It’s too dangerous.” He said. He was probably right, but I need to know what happened to Otto. I just don’t know if I’m going to find out. We’ve tried making calls, but there’s no signal here. Dad’s going to go out and get firewood tomorrow. I asked if I could go with him but he said no. I hope he stays safe.*

**September 9**

*I heard footsteps in the grass outside my window last night. Dad’s been sleeping on the couch in case anything happens. Someone was walking outside the cabin last night. After dad left this morning, I decided I’d risk it and go out for a minute. It was just outside my bedroom window that I went to check.*

*Otto’s collar lay just under the window, in front of a set of paw prints. There were plenty going to and from the cabin, but the ones in front of my window were deep—like whoever made them had been standing there for hours.*  

*I needed to tell dad, but he wasn’t at the house. I’d have to wait until he got back.*

*7:17*

*He’s back. I think. He won’t come in, though—he’s just standing in front of the kitchen window. He has a blank look on his face. I tried calling out to him, but he wouldn’t answer. I locked the door and hid under the covers of my bed. I knew it was coming, but that didn’t make it any easier when I started hearing the footsteps outside my window.*

*I’m scared… I’m so scared and I don’t know what to do. I’m going to try and go to sleep. This can’t be happening.*

**September 10**

*Dad was just being weird, it turns out. Early this morning, I woke up to knocking on the front door. “Let me in.” The voice sounded like my dad’s. He looked like my dad. He wasn’t able to bring back the firewood but according to him, he “ran into some trouble while out there.” When I asked him about the day long absence, this was all he had to say.*

*“I got lost.”*

*That was 12 hours ago. He hasn’t spoken a word since. Every time I peek out of my room, I can see him there on the couch. His head is always turned to face me—and he’s smiling.*

*Something isn’t right. I think when he’s distracted, I’ll try and make a break for it. I don’t know, I think I’m out of options. Yeah, I’ll make a run for it and try to get help.*

*I really need to get out of here, I don’t think what I let in is really my dad.*

And that was it. That was all of it.

I just had to sit there for a few minutes and digest what I read. Standing in the window with a blank face? Smiling? It was creepy as hell, but maybe the dad was just being weird? I huddled up on the couch. I’d be safe in here, all I had to do was wait until the rain cleared up and then I’d be able to leave.

I don’t know why I did it, but my brain told me I should hazard a glance at the kitchen window. I got up carefully and made my way over to the kitchen window. Any worries about being inconspicuous were quickly put to rest when I looked up and saw the eyes of a coyote staring right back at me. It was on its hind legs. I staggered back, falling onto my ass and using my hands and feet to continuously back up.

“Wha—what the fuck?!” I yelled. “What the fuck are you?!” It just stood there. It didn’t say a thing, but then, I suppose it couldn’t. Instead of responding, it continued to stand statue still and just look at me.

“Go away.” I said. “GET THE HELL AWAY!”

It looked left, then it looked right. And then it looked right back at me. And then it turned right and walked away. I didn’t know where it’d gone, but I didn’t want to take any chances. I pulled out my phone. *4:30*. I was past my time. I’d decided at this point that getting home on time wasn’t my biggest concern—it was simply getting home at all.

Nothing happened for the next 5 hours. It was strange. Almost too quiet, I thought. At about 9:46, I started hearing footsteps. The crunching of the leaves certainly helped to notify me of the presence of another individual outside.

The footsteps kept on until 10. I won’t lie and say I was fine. 14 minutes of someone walking around outside the house you’re in is just as horrible as you think it is.

At 10:01, a knock came from the door.

“Hello?” It was the voice of a young boy. “Can you let me in? Me and my dad got lost… I don’t know where he is. I’m scared. Please”

A rock dropped in the pit of my stomach. No, there was no way, right? Was I hallucinating? Or was there really a little boy on the other side of the door.

*Knock knock*

Again. I got up from my spot on the floor. “Don’t answer the door.” I thought. “Look through the peephole instead.” I was scared, not *stupid*.

I spent the next few minutes preparing to look through the peephole. When I was ready, I went over to the door, crouched down, and looked through.

My breath caught in my throat and I felt a lump begin to got in it.

There, on the other side of the door—knocking on it—was a coyote. Standing on two legs. I could see and hear it as this thing talked—but it didn’t howl or bark.

“*Can you let me in? Please. Let me in*.”

I couldn’t handle it. I backed away from the door. I hadn’t realized how far I’d moved until I banged my head on the dresser in the bedroom. That brought me back to my senses. I shot up and slammed the bedroom door shut. It didn’t take long for the footsteps to make their way over to the bedroom window.

It became easier to ignore the tapping on the window after a while. But I still didn’t like it. Sitting against the bed, a thought started to fade into my mind. “I need to get out of here.” But how? How would I get out?

If I simply waltzed through the front door, it’d come back in an instant and do whatever it wanted to do to me.

“Distraction.” I thought. “I can create a distraction.” I’d have to do it during the rain; louder less visibility. I’d decided on this.

I would finish the rest of the granola bars and water. I’d then fill up my bag with anything I could find in the cabin. The next part wouldn’t be so easy, but I’d have to find a way to get it into the cabin. I’d place the bag in the middle of the floor and put the lantern in it. As it turned out, the lantern—when turned on—had a few options.

The one I was most intrigued by was the strobe setting. It’d make for a decent distraction and give me a little bit of time to get away. 

I placed the bag in the middle of the floor and set the lantern to strobe when turned on. “Okay.” I told myself. “Can’t mess up. Just—gotta get out.”

I unlocked the cabin door and opened it slowly. The floor was slowly being soaked by the rain outside, but through all of that, I could hear it. The sounds of the footsteps of that coyote.

I opened the door all the way and hid behind it. I didn’t know if this thing had a good sense of smell, or anything like that. But I wasn’t willing to stick around to find out. As the canine lumbered in, I noticed a few things about it that hadn’t been clear in the dark.

It’s fur was matted—badly. Yet somehow, it was also slicked with blood. And the skin… it looked—it looked wrong, like the body it was on didn’t belong to it. On two legs, it stood at nearly 7 feet, so if nothing else indicated to me that this wasn’t a normal coyote, the near impossible height confirmed it.

It began to investigate the bag. I got up slowly and closed the door in the same manner. Okay, that was the first hardest part done. Noticing the metal chair from earlier, I grabbed it and jammed it as hard as I could under the doorknob. It wouldn’t hold forever, but hopefully it’d hold for long enough.

When I was about 100 feet away from the cabin, I finally heard it. A loud, shrill, inhuman screech as this thing triggered the blinding, never-ending light show. I took the loudness and the cacophony of screams as my sign to turn tail and begin sprinting as fast as I possibly could.

I nearly slipped a few times doing it, but I managed to get my flashlight out of my pocket. It’d take a little while, but if I was running, I’d cut the time it took to get back to my car in half at the very least.

After nearly 20 minutes, I stopped. I had heard the creature break out of the cabin a while ago, but I hadn’t the slightest clue of its whereabouts. If it was coming for me, I didn’t know. But I could at least try and prepare for it. 

I had to catch my breath. I turned my flashlight off and hid in some brush. I didn’t think that my little maneuver had much of a point. Didn’t. I was quickly proven wrong when I heard the wet squelchy sounds of something moving rapidly on the muddy ground.

“Fuck.” I thought. “It caught up to me?” I didn’t know what to do. The little lot I’d pulled up in couldn’t have been more than 5 minutes away. Maybe. If I ran as fast as possible I could reach it sooner, but not with this thing around.

I’d prepared for this, somewhat. I thanked my past self for getting a survival flashlight. It—like the lantern—had a strobe setting on it. Could I rely on that same method to save me twice? I looked down at the switch of the light and remained in my thoughts for a second.

Maybe it’d know what was happening this time. I could run in one direction and throw the flashlight in the other. By this time, my eyes had adjusted somewhat to the darkness. I couldn’t see completely thanks to the thick leaves on the trees but I could see well enough.

After a few minutes of deliberation and the thing wearing the coyote’s skin moving around near me, I made my choice. I would turn on the strobe and throw the flashlight as far as I could back in the direction I came.

Before I could do that, a crack rang out across the forest followed by a deep rumble. The downpour had turned into a thunderstorm. This would help me out a lot. I turned on the strobe setting for my light and held the glass end against my chest. This would suppress any light and keep me in darkness. I had a new plan now.

I would wait until the next strike of lightning, and when the thunder rumbled, I’d throw the flashlight and run. If I got lucky, the noise pollution would be too much to handle and I could get away without the creature finding me again.

I waited.

And waited.

And waited.

And… waited.

And then, just as I thought it wouldn’t happen, another crack rang out across the forest and I cupped my hand over the light part of the flashlight. “Here goes.” I said weakly.

And I threw the strobing flashlight.

I began to run as soon as the rumbling came. I could once again hear the unearthly screams of the creature as it realized what had happened. I was so close to salvation—so close. Just as I reached the clearing that led to the lot that I’d pulled up in, I heard it. The sounds of the creatures scampering quickly behind me and letting out quick, angry growls.

I was nearly there, though. The two fence posts were maybe 30 feet away.

I decided to chance it.   

I kept going and going. I guess the creature had gotten closer than expected, because I felt a clawed paw swipe at my back. I wasn’t injured, but it tore the back of my jacket up. One last burst of energy was all I needed—one burst, and I was out. I knew it’d catch me if I just kept running, so I jumped.

I jumped and dove headfirst into the muddy lot. It attempted to grab my foot as I went, but it only snagged my shoe. Unfortunately, I lost it, but that was okay. I turned around, positioning myself on my ass and looking at the creature.

It—wasn’t moving. Well, not moving wouldn’t be right. No, it wasn’t moving towards me. It tried reaching a paw out past the fence posts but it screamed like it was in pain. Could—could it not move past that?

I wasn’t going to stick around and find out. I scrambled and got up. Running over to my car, I fumbled getting the keys out of my pocket but I eventually did. I opened the door and by the time I turned back around to check if the creature was still there, a wave of surprise came over me.

There was nothing but dead air where the coyote once was.

I took this as my cue to leave. I turned on my car and sped out of there. The drive home wasn’t nearly as scary as everything I’d gone through in the forest.

When I got home, I sprinted inside and locked every door. I cooped myself up in my room and slept with the lights on. I never did hear any more noises like the ones I did in the forest. I made a call to the police the next day and told them that there was something hurting people in those woods.

That was three weeks ago. They said they’d investigate it, but—so far—I haven’t seen anything in the news regarding that forest.

In the three weeks since it happened, I’ve had nightmares every night. In them, that coyote would slink through into my bedroom through the open door. It’d crawl into my bed. I never do find out what happens to me in the dream, though, because I always wake up before it can do anything.

With the lack of any developments and the fact that I didn’t spend nearly enough time in the woods to find anything out, I  came away from that with all but one question; why? Why did that creature hurt people? Why did it torment me? And most importantly…

Why wasn’t it able to leave the forest? I think about it quite a bit, but I’ve tried to go back to normal living. Well, as normal as someone can be after something like that. I don’t go on nature walks anymore. I just stick to the streets and sidewalks now. It’s safer that way.

Whether or not the choice to believe me is made—that’s completely up to you. But, I need to say this. If you live in Vermont—same state as me—and you happen upon the entrance of a forest. If you see two fence posts, I ask—beg that you turn around.

Because there’s something in those woods.

And it *isn’t* human.
