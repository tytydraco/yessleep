It started when I was 9 years old. Lying in bed, struggling to sleep, I gazed towards the exit of my room. The doorway was pitch black. The complete absence of light, a blanket of dark space, blocking me from leaving. I’m now 32, writing this at my desk. Glancing behind me, the darkness in the doorway is still there, watching me.  
  
As an only child, my parents kept my door open at night, in case I needed to call for them. Were they overprotective? Perhaps. But I felt safe in their presence and alone when they were gone. Still, as much as they loved me, there were only so many times they could answer my midnight screams before my sanity was questioned.  
  
Explaining the phenomenon was impossible. They would ask me what I saw and I’d attempt in vain to put words to the doorway that haunted me. Not even a teenager, my vocabulary was limited. As I got older, I talked less about my experiences. Overhearing my parents discuss options to send me away from home made it clear that I best keep some things to myself.  
  
Today, I am better equipped to describe my situation. Unfortunately, while the vision of darkness certainly strikes me with horror, the feelings accompanying it are far worse.  
  
A dark doorway is a simple image to imagine, I’m sure you have experienced it yourself. However, what has followed me since my childhood is more than just the black of night. A frame encapsulating annihilation, a reality of isolation and eternal silence. That is what I feel when I stare into the dark. The anxiety that follows is worse than any panic attack. While it no longer brings me to tears, my mind still suffers.  
  
I wish my description was more akin to a ghost, that is easy to understand. Instead, my visiting presence is just total blackness. Even though I have never seen a figure, I am certain that the doorway is watching me. I have no doubt that something is there, waiting.  
  
When I grew older and began to live alone, I hoped to start a new chapter. I wasn't so lucky. I was in a different room, but the void followed. Many nights were spent with the lights on and my room locked. Unfortunately, this seemed to anger the presence as I would often be forced awake by the sound of the door slamming open. The more actions I took, the darker the doorway became with my psyche starting to crack in the process.   
  
It’s always been difficult, dealing with this by myself. So much stress, waiting for something to walk into my room. I’ve discovered similar stories online but none capture the full torment of my reality. The only other person I spoke about all this with was Sarah. Although, it wasn’t really my choice.  
  
I met her through work, and she was nothing short of wonderful. I avoided mentioning the doorway, I ignored it for as long as possible. Life was good for about a year. We shared similar interests, made each other laugh and for the first time in my life, someone seemed to care.   
  
She moved into my apartment after 6 months. Thankfully, Sarah wasn’t a night owl, giving me ample time to watch the doorway. I couldn’t lose focus, I had to protect myself, protect her. I had to know when something peeked through the ghastly frame. It was all but over once she awoke at 3 am, catching my concentrated stare. I tried explaining myself, showing her my illustrations and copious notes, but she was out the door within a week. I miss her. I really do.   
  
If you have made it this far, you probably consider me to be a bit of a nutcase, obsessed with the entrance to a bedroom. For a while, I may have agreed with you. But 3 weeks ago I heard the breathing. The labouring breath of the entity that has haunted me since I was 9. It’s not always there, but on certain nights, usually around 1 am, I can make out the distinctive tone of something panting on the other side of the darkness.   
  
I want to stand closer, I want to hear more, but I can’t. If I’m not careful, this thing will kill me. I have nothing left to lose but I’m still petrified of whatever is watching me. It has taken everything. I have no job, zero friends and little sleep. The only thing that remains is the doorway.
