What kind of kid were you? Back in middle or high school, were you the rational one, or were you the type to jump off a cliff if your friends did? I happened to be the latter in this analogy, I was until I reached college where I actually didn't care what others thought of me. For most of my primary school life I had the same friends and felt comfortable with them because I wasn't the type to make many friends. These friends would always seem to pick on me or whatever the K-12 version of hazing was but I never recognized it and passed it off as typical friend stuff, up until the eighth grade where their pressuring turned into a fight for my life.

Mick was our "leader" as he was the oldest of us at 15 from being held back a year like everyone else, Benny and Jacob were both 14, and I was the younger one at just 12. I'd met the group when I first arrived at school, I'd been homeschooled for the beginning years of my education on the account of my parents being afraid of me going out into the "dangerous world of Utah" as my dad said. Mick and the gang wanted to introduce me to the school and that quickly turned into making me wish I'd never met them.

The group didn't chastise fellow students or anything like that, everyone kept to themselves and never really got in trouble in school. However after school was when I'd see the group's actual interests. My friends liked to do things such as spray-painting absurd things like pentagrams, crucifixes, or absurd phrases or words on other people's houses or on buildings, they also liked to mess with animals like the stray cats or dogs around the town but they didn't seem to like me watching some of their methods that I assumed was because of my age at the time. I never participated in any of it but I was always the lookout as Mick appointed me to "Prove my reliability".

Mick always seemed to be the responsible one in the group, I think the charisma he had kind of blinded me. He seemed nice and caring for everyone like we were all his little brothers. Mick even taught me how to box or fight as I didn't have any knowledge on anything like that from being sheltered and coddled most of my life. I'd gotten pretty close to everyone in the group over the years of being in school, but Mick seemed the most like a big brother to me. We'd all stay close friends during school and always looked out for each other.

Then when I reached the end eighth grade, Mick called a "meeting" for the group over at a factory at the other end of town. I told everyone in the group chat that I couldn't go out past six but everyone was telling me that it's urgent. "My mom already called yours, we'll get you home before 7." Mick replied. I sighed and told them I'd be on my way before grabbing my phone and heading downstairs where I got the okay from my parents. I hopped on my bike and peddled it to the factory, taking breaks to text in the group chat. A few minutes later I arrived at the factory to see everyone drinking some sodas and talking.

Once I got there Mick handed me a can and I cracked it open to continue talking to the gang, about girls, Fortnite, briefly talking about grass before Mick changed the subject. "What's this all about by the way?" I asked. Mick nodded, "We have a tradition in the group. To make sure you're actually willing to be in the group." Mick told me. Benny handed me a covered tub, "Nobody's stuck around as long as you. So we trust you to do this." He stated. "Basically, just take the tub inside, set it down in the right spot, whistle and open it up. That simple." Jacob explained to me. "I don't know, this doesn't seem right. I could get in trouble." I hesitated. Mick put his hand on my shoulder, "This place has been closed down since before we were born. Nothing's going to happen. Trust me." Mick said. I gulped and took the tub, then listened to Mick's instruction.

I walked inside the factory and started moving through the halls as Mick told me to do, as I did I saw the same phrases and symbols the gang had painted around town but with black smears across them. I walked through the halls as I heard grinding and dripping coming from the beams as I just focused on the moonlight coming in through the open roof. I then found the center of the factory and sat the tub down. I whistled the best I could before opening up the tub, and I immediately regretted it.

In the dim moonlight I saw a pair of bright blue eyes that started to get closer to me, I quickly pulled out my phone and shined the flashlight at it. With my crappy flashlight I could see a boy around my age ahead of me, "What're you doing here? We shouldn't be here." I called out. The boy got close enough for me to see his pale skin and the stiches across his arms, face, eyes, and mouth, "I'm looking for a new friend, you brought me an offering so you must be that friend." The boy told me. I looked down in the tub and nearly vomited.

Two crucifices were stuck together with the limbs of a small cat and dog, with the bodies of the animals stitched together with their organs exposed. I looked up and saw the boy smiling before watching his teeth grow with a loud cracking sound into large fangs. His fingers shot out blood as bone-like appendages pierced through his skin, seeing the same happen as the same appendages split out of his shoulders to the length of his arms. He started laughing a high pitched cackle and as he did I bolted down the halls. 

I panted heavily as I sprinted down the halls and heard more grinding and cackling, hearing it drift off as I reached the entrance to see my friends. "Guys, there's something in here!" I shouted as I reached them. Mick nodded at the other two and they grabbed me, "We know, Drew." He said coldly. I struggled as Benny and Jacob dragged me back into the factory, but I dug deep and decided to fight back. I stomped on both feet of my "friends" and headbutted Jacob to the ground before punching Benny hard in his stomach to drop him. I was going to run before Mick stopped me by standing in front of me as he grabbed me by the throat and lifted me up.

I choked as I heard the grinding getting closer, "This is what friends do, they help each other." Mick said as he strangled me. I heard the laughing getting closer and closer so I knew I had to do something. I punched Mick in the throat and as he dropped me I kicked him as hard as I could in the jewels to drop him to his knees. "I don't want to be friends anymore." I told Mick as I punched him across the face. I stepped over his body and ran out of the factory before getting against the wall as I heard the laughing come up right to the entrance. "Three new friends? This makes me so happy." I heard the boy giggle. I then heard three pairs of screams and listened as they got farther and farther away, until I couldn't hear them anymore.

I heard on the news that Mick, Ben, and Jacob were never found after they were reported missing, the police said it was a cult ritual gone wrong. We moved shortly after as it spooked my parents and I was put back into homeschool. I did find new friends though, ones that didn't pressure me and cared for my comfortability. One thing to take away from this long story, is stick up for yourself. Peer pressure can be a terrible thing, and it could even lead to your death.
