I could not find the key to the basement no matter where I looked in the bedroom, I don't remember misplacing it but with everything that's happened in the past twelve or so hours I wasn't about to question something as mundane as this. Afraid to go too far without Connor, I decided to wait by the ladder up to the attic for him to finish searching and maybe join him if he found something, but when I stopped to listen I could hear no footsteps or any noise coming from up there.

"Connor?" I called while looking up at the darkness above me, seeing no ray of light from his flashlight either, but I heard him speak to me and figured he must be quite a way inside.

"I'm up here." His voice was flat, and it just sounded strange, not quite like him, but I choked it up to the way sound carried itself from above to the hallway. "Come up, I found something."

"What's up?" I asked, starting to climb the ladder, but didn't get the answer I expected. Actually, I got no answer at all. "Connor?" I called again with my head now poking up into the attic and I finished ascending. I cleaned my hands of the dust and shivered from how cold it was up here, then looked around and found myself completely in the dark with no light coming from anywhere. Something felt wrong and I wasn't sure if the next chill that ran through my body was from the cold or my intuition.

I didn't wait around to find out and quickly climbed back down into the hallway where the cold of the attic followed me. It was strange, to say the least, it wasn't like that before I'd gone up there. I waited for a little while, wondering what had caused Connor to behave so unlike himself. The cold was too much and I began feeling uncomfortable, so while waiting for him I decided I'd go back into the bedroom to grab a jacket, but upon opening the door I was greeted to my living room.

I don't think I need to describe to you how I felt at that moment, but I began growing more and more concerned as I wandered from room to room and found myself in an impossible loop of my own home, to which I was now like a mouse to a trap. Occasionally after going through each room so many times I could hear sounds that didn't seem to fit, and objects denying reality itself. Windows had been placed on ceilings looking into nothing, furniture floating in the middle of the air or clipping into the floor, a reality show playing in the middle of my kitchen in which there was no TV.

To say the least, I was terrified and convinced I would never make it out of here, as everything only seemed to get worse and only that much more confusing, and no matter how much time I spent looking in each room I'd move to next I would find nothing that even hinted at a way of getting out of this maze.

Adrenaline flooded my body in the middle of my search of the kitchen when I heard footsteps and increasingly louder static mixed with a voice constantly changing its pitch, but not in a regular way, rather this voice was constantly swapping between male and female. There was nowhere in the kitchen to hide, so the only thing I could do was hide behind the counter on the other side and stay as silent as I could be, considering the circumstances. I covered my mouth and still feared the sound of my heart pounding would be enough to give me away.

The three sounds moved closer and closer together, and eventually reached the kitchen. The footsteps came to a stop but what I was hearing disturbed me in a way nothing had been able to in all my time alive. What I heard, presumably coming from the entrance to the kitchen, was like I said, a voice swapping between that of a man and a woman, mixed in with radio static, citing yesterday's news, then the weather report, random conversations, and then something all too familiar.

"911, what's your emergency?"

It was my voice.

My breathing froze and I slowly looked up without revealing myself from the counter, expecting whatever was here in the kitchen with me to be looking down like in a horror movie, but thankfully there was nothing. The voice continued, swapping between the voices of two other men, mine, and out of nowhere Connor's.

"Marielle... since when are your eyes two different colors?"

I widened my eyes in disbelief and covered my mouth with both hands, praying whatever this was would leave. The static grew louder first, and then it began stopping and starting again at random intervals while this thing continued repeating the same phrase over and over again. It was sickening to listen to.

"Marielle... since when are your eyes two different colors? Marielle... since when are your eyes two different colors?"

By now the voices had stopped swapping and only Connor's was the one repeating this. Then just as suddenly as it arrived, the footsteps began walking in the opposite direction and the phrase fading into the otherwise silent house. I was so petrified by what had just happened I couldn't bring myself to get up for another few minutes and had to keep myself from crying.

After spending enough time with just myself and no inexplicable sounds showing up, I stood upright again and looked around to find that I was alone. It finally dawned on me that because of the state of panic I was in I had completely forgotten the most obvious part of the kitchen - the window that intruder broke to get inside. It was still shattered, but unlike most of the other windows that looked into nothing or just walls, beyond it was my bedroom and the sight of a body on the ground that I could not recognize. I gasped when I saw it, then noticed that it was lying in a pool of blood. I crawled through the window and approached it slowly. Being able to get closer to it allowed me to see that its clothes, though torn and bloody, were the same as the ones the man who had broken my window was wearing. The realization made me stop in my tracks for a moment before resuming my crawl towards him. It was a man whose face I could not yet see, it was turned away from me and the hood of the grey hoodie - or what remained of it - was still up. There must have been some kind of fight with someone, or something, because over his legs was my bedside table with the lamp broken on the ground, glass scattered all around.

Carefully kneeling down as to not cut myself I turned the man's head towards me, revealing the wide eyed, bloody face of someone I knew all too well. Lying before me, dead on the ground after breaking into my home, was my ex husband, Russel.

I never talked about Russel much to anyone after we finalized our divorce. I had long since been emotionally detached from him after two years of growing neglect that made us argue more and more every day, and we would end up not talking for each other for weeks after some of the fights. Everything started as what I first thought was a way for him to try and scare me as he knew I had always been afraid of anything horror related, so he found it funny to occasionally read out a scary story or pop out of a corner to see my reaction. I never paid him much mind and only laughed it off when he started talking about the "other side" and the "mirror people", but he kept getting more and more interested in it until that was everything he would talk about from day to night, sometimes not even sleeping to continue what he called his research, and what I found to be mindless scrolling on the internet and reading made up articles about some made up thing to scare teenagers and gullible minds. Now, after everything I had seen and gone through, I remembered all of it for the first time in the few months I'd been able to bury it in my mind.

I don't know what he was doing here, why he was trying to break into my home and how he ended up like this. So many thoughts flooded through my head instantly, most of them grief and confusion, but I had no time to process any of them as I jumped back at the sight and a piece of glass pierced through my right palm and I let out an involuntary yelp.

Just as I did that I immediately heard the same sounds from earlier - footsteps and voices with static mixed in repeating random words and phrases, but this time there was more than one, and they were coming right towards me. I turned to my bed and rushed to hide under it, having no time to get to the wardrobe or try and make my way back through the window and into the kitchen. The covers were hanging loosely and covered half the space below the bed, so if I stayed quiet I'd have a chance to go unnoticed.

The unearthly sights kept coming. Rushing into the bedroom were three men - two in police uniforms whose movements were unnaturally stiff and their faces expressionless, their eyes not even moving, and the third was... not Connor. I mean, it looked like him - it had his face, but it was changing expressions every less than a second, from a smile to nothing to a grimace to sadness to every single emotion you can think of. His clothes were the ones I'd seen him in when he changed after we went to his house, only their colors were changing rapidly, and then in the blink of an eye he was wearing a suit, again the colors changing and mixing.

What terrified me the most about the view was his limbs. Like I mentioned, the policemen were totally still and unmoving, but this Connor lookalike's limbs were spasming and flying around in movements the human body simply couldn't perform. One moment his arm was by his side and the next it was raised backwards ninety degrees, instantly afterwards pointing forward then clipping *into* his body before returning to normal again, and his head snapped violently from side to side, as if his neck were constantly breaking and repairing itself.

Their presence brought with them the static, but once they'd entered the room the voices had stopped, and they just sat there for about half a minute before the static began ringing so loud I almost had to cover my ears and then the three just... disappeared. They were gone, as if they'd never been there.

I waited to see if anything would return again or if I'd hear any noises, but the only thing was total silence and the body of my ex husband uncomfortably close to me while I was hiding. I crawled out from under the bed and took one more look at him before quickly jumping through the window into the kitchen again, only this time it lead my back to the hallway with the attic. There was sure to be emotional fallout from this, but my brain was not letting me process it now.

Before I could even look around I was tackled by something into the wall and my mouth was covered, preventing me from screaming no matter how I tried. I started throwing my hands erratically into this thing trying to hit it and make it release me, but it only began shushing me and reduced the strength of its grip. I opened my eyes to see Connor, bruised and disheveled, his clothes dirty and stained with blood. He stared at me and spoke.

"Blue eyes..." He then looked at my bloody hand and let me go, before that pressing a finger to his lips telling me to stay silent. Seeing him so beat up while the rest of those things looked, well, completely abnormal and impossible to even exist, and considering the fact that if he was not the actual Connor and wanted to harm me, it had the opportunity to but didn't.

"Connor?" I whispered and eyed him up and down. He really had it rough somewhere. "Is it you? The... real you?"

"Yes. Yes. Quiet, Marielle—something's here. It's not human." Connor was more afraid than I had ever seen him, and he gave the impression of someone who was not easy to scare. "We need to find a way out."

"How did you end up here? From the attic?"

"Yeah, the first time."

"The first time?"

After making sure we heard none of those things approaching and looked through the window and each of the doors, Connor and I sat in the middle of the hallway where he explained to me how he had been attacked by something after finding the intruder and was thrown back into what we assume was reality, where I found him and we drove back to the hotel. That's when he'd seen that my eyes were different colors, and bringing it up caused this other Marielle to begin distorting her limbs just like I'd seen the other Connor do, and her head had started to twitch. Before he could get out of the car she lunged at him from the driver's seat, and he woke up again in the middle of the living room.

We were able to mutually shock each other, him with his experience and me with the fact that this intruder was my ex husband.

"So why did he try to break into your home? Does he hate you, did he want to hurt you?"

"No, it was obvious to me he still loved me even after all the arguments and the divorce. I was the one that ended things. But he'd spoken about the other side and mirror people, that's what he called them." I blinked and moved my eyes from staring into the wall that was not the right color to look at Connor. "I think he knew something about this and was trying to warn me."

We sat in thought for a little while longer before he got up and helped me off the floor.

"We have to find a way out fast, Marielle."

The door we went through led us into my bathroom - or this place's version of it. It looked exactly like it normally does, which was unusual, aside from one thing, and that was the mirror which did not have its usual reflective surface, but was instead looking into another bathroom. We looked around thoroughly first before I helped Connor climb up the sink and he crawled through. The second he did however, he disappeared, and I was left all alone again. Afraid to turn back and unsure of what else to do, I started making my way on the sink with one leg and through the mirror with the rest of my body.

Halfway through, I turned in reaction to hearing an ear-piercing scream coming from a woman mixed with the undertone of a male voice and the damned static. Charging through the door of the bathroom and right at me, was me. The other Marielle's eyes were wide and her mouth open as loud as it could humanly go, and she grabbed me by my ankle and began pulling me back in. I held onto the edges and screamed, using my other leg to kick at her hands, but she would not let go, only intensifying these inhuman screams that will forever haunt my nightmares. Despite that I continued trying while looking around to see if there was anything on the sink that might help me, and I saw the glass cup that I used to keep my toothbrush in. I grabbed it and used all my strength to slam it into the other Marielle's head, shattering it. A final kick into her face was enough to force her to release me and I made the rest of my way into the mirror, her screams stopping as if I'd just woken up from a dream.

I dropped down onto the floor with a loud thud, immediately pushing myself back up against the wall and hyperventilating while Connor looked at me unsure of what to do.

"What the hell happened? Why did it take you so long?" He knelt by my side and winced in pain, putting his left hand over his ribs.

"The other me damn near dragged me back in!"

"Holy... well, you don't have to worry about that, I think. Look." Connor pointed to the mirror after my breathing slowly started going back to normal, and I only saw pitch black in it. "Looks like we found the way out."

"How do you know we're out?"

"Listen. There's noises outside. Hear those construction workers? The cars?" I nodded and took in the sounds he was describing. "I don't know if you noticed, but there's none of that in... there."

I stood up and approached it, not daring to put my hand through but stared into the black void. I would describe what I was seeing as impossible, but considering everything that had gone down just now, I don't think that word has any meaning anymore.

"We need to get out of this house before we get trapped again. Is your car still outside?" I asked as I opened the door leading out into the hallway, making sure to check beforehand. The house looked completely normal.

"No, I don't know where it is, maybe still at the hotel or... honestly, I have no idea. I just showed up here again after being attacked by whatever that thing pretending to be you was."

My car was at the hotel also, at least that's where I left it after ending my shift early following that call, so we decided to call a taxi to get us to Connor's house where we could both take a break and get fixed up, hopefully without having to worry about being pulled into another dimension or whatever the place we were trapped in was.

After I took a shower, Connor went to rest and make sure he had no wounds he was missing and I'd wrapped my hand in bandages before using his laptop, with his permission of course, to do some research on what Russel had been so obsessed with all that time ago. The weight of finding the man I'd spend so much time in love with dead in a place that couldn't exist still hadn't come down on me, but at least it allowed me to remain focused.

Looking up "mirror people" and "other side" together yielded scattered and terribly written posts with grammar and spelling mistakes, packed with action scenes that were obviously works of fiction by people who'd stumbled upon something similar online, but one of the top results was an actually well put together website describing these entities as "another me", documenting reports of people seeing, hearing, talking and even interacting with themselves, but by the time it had reached that point no more updates had been posted.

I showed the website to Connor and he browsed through it, finding something I hadn't looked for yet at the bottom corner of the page. It was the creator of the website's name, a middle aged woman by the name of Rebecca Simmons and contact information about her email, encouraging people who have an experience to share to contact her.

"We have nothing to lose, right? I mean, this all sounds... completely insane and psychotic, but we just went through it, and this woman is probably the only person ready to believe us right off the bat." Connor looked at me again, but suddenly his eyes trailed towards my injured hand.

"Sure, are you going to write the email or should I?" Connor didn't reply, he seemed zoned out. "What's wrong?"

"Marielle, what's happening to your hand?"

I looked at my injured hand and gasped, then quickly lifted up the leg of my pants to see the same thing on my ankle. At the same time Connor lifted one side of his shirt enough to see where he'd been attacked.

My hand, ankle, and that part of Connor's torso, were pitch black.
