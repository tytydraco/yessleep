**Content warning:** Body Horror, Agoraphobia

\[Entry 1\] - It Started with Clumps of Hair

Where do I begin? Screw it. Whether anyone sees this or not, I need a place to record what’s happening.

It started with clumps of hair. I don’t know when or how. People shed hair all the time and barely notice. But the first time I ran my fingers through my once thick locks and came back with a matted clump… I was less than thrilled.

“What the—“ A lump in my throat stopped the whisper. Shaking, I tossed the fistful into the toilet and flushed—as if that could make it disappear.

No miracle product or supplement could stop the leathery bald spots spreading across my scalp. I stared at my reflection in the mirror with white knuckles gripping the counter. What used to be cascading ringlets had thinned out, replaced by spindly strands in uneven patches.

Next were my fingernails and toenails. It was a simple stubbed toe, but the nail had come off entirely. I found it wedged into the carpet like a bad omen. Only red, raw skin remained; tender.

“Shit. *Damn it.*” I sucked in a breath through gritted teeth.

The cracks continued forming—first in my yellowing nails; splintering, brittle as dead wood.

My neighbors must think I’m crazy. Someone had to have heard the animalistic scream that tore from my throat as I dug in with tweezers. One by one, I peeled the nails from their beds until none remained. The process was slick with pus and mucus.

By the time my toes were stripped bare, it was clear this was inevitable—better to tear them all away than to wait one by one. Still, I writhed, folding into myself on the bathroom tile like a squished spider. Now every touch, even the slightest brush, grinds against exposed nerves. The kind of pain that churns your gut and makes your flesh shiver.

If someone **is** reading this, I’m sure you’re asking yourself:

“Well, why not see a doctor?” And to that I would say, fair question.

The last time I left my place to seek medical attention—and I do mean **the last time**—my psychiatrist diagnosed me with agoraphobia. Anyone but me and any place but here petrifies me. The public is unpredictable and deceitful. There are too many variables involved that are out of my control. And with all the conveniences of the modern world, who would have reason to leave anyway?

I’ve been surviving on disability checks for longer than I can remember, and my friends and family gave up on me ages ago.

So I stay put and come here to write this. Hopefully, this is where the nightmare ends, and I can find a way back to health without leaving my safe space. I’m open to any suggestions.

\[Entry 2\] - A Quick, Fleshy Twist

It’s been 2 days since my last entry. Please, if anyone knows what’s happening to me… my hair is gone, and my nails have yet to grow back. I don’t know what to do.

Yesterday I awoke to a wet, meaty pop. Shooting upright in bed, my eyes snapped open. Vision cut in half, I fumbled out of bed. Poor depth perception turned my stumbling into a desperate crawl, knocking over what I think was a lamp in the process.

Something moist and sinewy slapped against the left side of my face. Did I even want to look in the mirror? Could I face this head-on?

“Please, no.”

I crawled until my hands hit the cabinet. Reaching up slowly, I grasped the edge of the counter and heaved my quivering body like a puppet strung wrong.

My legs trembled as I stood there, hand hovering over the light switch, too much of a coward to face my new reality. I should have left it off and gone back to bed to wait out whatever this is.

Finally, I flicked the light on. The pale yellow glow illuminated the room, and my nightmare came to life. Hanging from my optic nerve were tendons, muscles, and connective tissue. And at the end, my ruined eyeball. Thick milky sludge coagulating where my once hazel eye should have been.

“No… no, no, *no*—” I barely managed to make it to the toilet before retching wracked my body, the spray of bile splattering onto my wound in the process.

In a panic, I cleaned the area as best I could. Pale, shaking fingers pushed the tangle of sinews back into the socket, slow and deliberate. I finished by packing it with tissue and securing it with tape. The pain that emanated from my mutilated optic nerve was searing hot.

That’s when the knocking started.

“Oh, hell…” Somehow, the prospect of a person at my door was worse than the events that had just unfolded in front of the mirror. Of course, looking the way I do now doesn’t help, but visitors send me into a spiral on my best days.

“Hello? Are you okay in there?” A woman’s timid voice seeped through my front door, a voice I recognized as my neighbor's. I didn’t know her name, but I had seen her in passing the few times I was forced to leave my safety bubble. Her knocking grew urgent.

I slumped against the door, hands clamped tightly around my ears, rocking back and forth.

“Look, I know you don’t know me, but… I’ve been hearing you scream, and just now I heard all that banging. Please, I want to make sure you’re okay!” Even over my clasped hands, I could hear the desperation in her voice. She sounded scared. Imagine how she’d feel if she saw the state I was in.

“Go away…” I whispered between sobs, anger rising in my chest. “Go *away*. *GO AWAY*!” My murmur crescendoed into a scream as I crumpled into the fetal position, fists hammering the floor. I continued this way until my body gave in to slumber.

A few hours later, I awoke. Neighbor gone. In the same spot, a puddle of my own sweat. A coppery stain on the floor where I had sobbed into the carpet.

Coming to my feet, my jaw clenched. I was conscious of the cracking which reverberated from my teeth to my inner ear. They shifted in my gums like loose screws.

Returning to the mirror as if chasing the next hit of horror, I opened my mouth. Strings of saliva mixed with blood threaded down my chin. My tongue lolled heavily as a slab of meat hanging from a hook.

I began pulling as if possessed. A quick, fleshy twist, a tug, and they slid free. One by one, they came loose, too easily. Left in their place were gummy black holes. I’ve been on a liquid diet ever since.

I thought I was afraid to leave my place before. Now I know I was wrong about fear. If this is just the beginning, I’m not sure if I can face what comes next.

\[Entry 3\] - Surrender

I don’t know how long it’s been since my last entry. Time is slipping. I sit in front of the mirror, clinging to consciousness as long as I can. Watching, waiting for the next in this series of horrors. Before long, my one good eyelid becomes heavy. My body sags to the floor like rotting fruit, fatigued.

Sleep is the briefest reprieve before my nerves ignite like fire. Jolting awake, I feel less rested each time.

I’m doing the best I can to take care of myself. Due to my liquid diet, options are limited. Yet, there are items in my fridge that have gone missing, and empty food containers in my trash that I never touched.

My gaunt shadow stretched across the kitchen behind me as it blocked the light from the open refrigerator. I turned the half-empty bottle of soda in my hands.

“I don’t understand.” My voice came out stale, strained.

That’s not all. Groceries have shown up at my door that I never ordered. At least, not that I remember. Sure, maybe someone concerned came by and left them. Maybe that neighbor who came to check on me.

The thing is, I scanned the receipt. It showed the order was placed online, under my name, and the last 4 digits of my credit card. I checked my web history, and I had in fact placed the order from my own laptop. The time-stamp on the receipt read *3:13 am* the night before.

Hadn’t I been asleep then? Why can’t I remember? On top of it all, these were foods I’d never been fond of.

Speaking of my laptop, it took me **ages** to find that thing. I could have sworn I left it sitting right on my bedside. I turned my apartment upside down, panicked. By the time I found it hiding under my couch, my place looked ransacked.

Why on Earth would I have left it there?

I don’t remember when anymore, but one night, I decided to set a trap of sorts. I was tired of feeling out of control. With swift determination, I grabbed a glass of water and wrote out a sticky note:

*Don’t forget.*

Then, attached it to the glass and firmly placed it on my nightstand.

I resumed my post at the bathroom mirror, switching from my haggard reflection to the nightstand. I nearly gave myself whiplash. It was impossible to see out of my peripheral vision due to my damaged eye.

Yet again, sleep crawled inside of me when I wasn’t looking.

Waking before sunrise, I whipped around to the bedside table as quickly as my body would allow. Joints creaked like a tree trunk on the verge of collapse.

I stiffened. The bathroom light cut into my room, spilling onto the nightstand like a spotlight and leaving its surroundings in murky darkness.

“Oh, thank goodness.” My hand gripped my chest with a heavy sigh of relief. The glass was there.

Slowly, on quivering hands and knees, I crawled over like prey being stalked. The feeling of eyes watching from the pitch black beyond was palpable. An inky void that threatened to swallow me whole.

My breath caught in my throat as my eyes adjusted. Yes, it was still there. Now half empty. The note was still stuck to the side—only the writing wasn’t mine.

*Surrender.*

I snatched the note off the glass, sending it and the remaining liquid shattering against the wall. Furiously sprinting from room to room, I turned on every single light.

“*Why are you doing this to me*?!” My voice cracked as I wailed. “*Where are y*—”

I froze in my tracks. Muddy footprints tracked across the carpet. Proof.

Too loud, too forced—a cackle tore from my gut.

“*Finally*. I got you. *I’m not crazy*!” The words hung heavily in the air as I tried to convince myself. Then I saw the sneakers sat neatly by the front door, caked in dried mud; **my sneakers**.

“Was I… Outside…?”

I finally figured maybe I really am losing it; losing body parts, losing time, losing my mind. What could be next?

Had I somehow sleepwalked? That wasn’t something I’d ever done before. Though I had read once that extreme stress can trigger sleepwalking events. Now I know better.

You see, my hair has started to grow back. Finally, a win, right? But it isn’t my hair. My once black tresses have been replaced with golden blonde roots, sprouting sharply at my scalp.

Today I changed my bandages. Where cloudy ooze once hung from fibrous tissue, a new eye stared back—the wrong eye. I froze, feeling hollow. Had it somehow healed? I hoped I would remember having two different colored eyes. One blue eye, one hazel.

It feels as though my body remembers, but my mind cannot. With every piece lost, something new is grown. I think I’m turning into my worst fear. Not me anymore—someone else.

Yet somehow, it’s a strange **relief** as if my body wants this to happen. **Needs** this to happen. Why stop it if it feels… **right**?
