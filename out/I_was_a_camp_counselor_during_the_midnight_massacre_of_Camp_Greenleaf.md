A simple job, that is what I thought it would be. Just helping out some kid's during summertime with all the camping activities. Good wholesome fun and a feeling of pride in being a small special part of the summertime fun that all the kids would remember when they were my age. I never got to go to summer camp so I thought it would be nice to experience all the entertainment and memories alongside a new generation. I was sure everyone would have a great time, that is until the killings started.

I still feel guilty that I survived when so many were slain. I could have done more I should have done more. I don’t know how or why it all happened. When it was done, I couldn't believe what had happened or who the police said was the perpetrator. The trauma and fear of the situation will stay with my forever but at least I survived, my friends and campers did not. I will recount what I remembered to honor their memory and make me face my own failure to protect them. I know I could have done more, but if it was really who I suspect it was, would I have been able to stop them?

It was the first week of summer and I was headed to Camp Greenleaf with the other counselors. The day was beautiful and the scenic vista of the camp and the nearby lake glistening in the morning light was an inspiring sight. With me were three other counselors, Chelsea, Glen and Whitney. They all looked right out of high school and I was the oldest by a bit it seemed. Whitney had been sitting next to me on the bus so I tried to talk with her a bit, but she seemed disinterested and was mostly on her phone the whole time. Meanwhile Glen was making an awkward attempt at hitting on Chelsea who continued to roll her eyes and try to ignore his attempts at small talk.

Despite the disinterest of my fellow counselors, I was ready to get started. We got off the bus and were met by a bear of a man who gave us a brief introduction and overview on what to expect in our roles as camp counselors. The man leading the meeting was the director and head of Camp Greenleaf Mr. Johnston, though he insisted we refer to him as Ken, or coach, since he also worked as a high school football coach during the school year.

“Remember we are a team; we work together and we do our best and everyone will have a great summer!” He finished with a flourish and a raised fist like he expected us to give him a standing ovation. I felt bad at the lack of response so I shouted a response.

“Yeah, let's do it!” Ken smiled approvingly while my fellow counselors judged me in silence with condescending looks. This was going to be rough if I had to remain the only optimistic one besides the director.

Later that day the campers arrived. We were a bit short considering we were supposed to have over twenty kids but only twelve arrived. Apparently the camp had a reputation that some kids had heard disturbing rumors about and refused to go. It seemed like a bad omen but I promised I would help make the time for the kids who did show as great as possible. I got to meet most of the campers and despite being discouraged by the small number, it did mean we had more time to spend with each one. My excitement was diluted when I realized a lot of them seemed uninterested in most of what the camp and all of us had to offer. The general apathy as soon as they arrived was palpable, they were high schoolers and to my dismay seemed more inclined to ignore our attempts at instruction and activities and stay glued to their phones.

Only one of the campers spoke directly to us. Her name was Beatrice or Bee for short. She was a little shy though seemed nice. Unfortunately, she was a bit of a pariah and was picked on by most of the other kids. The only thing that could pull their attention away from their phones was a verbal jab or some trick or prank they tried to pull at Bee’s expense. I tried to put a stop to it, but it was always in passive aggressive ways that were tough or catch and call out the offenders. Most of the girls ignored me anyway and continued to harass Bee throughout the day.

We had a very busy day of activities and orientation. Many of the kids did start to have fun when they realized they had a lot more to do then just sit around on social media. Glen and I showed the boys to their cabins, while Whitney and Chelsea showed the girls to theirs. Even as we parted into our groups, I saw Beatrice looking sullen and I saw more of the girls snickering at her behind her back. It was tough to watch but I couldn't do much to interfere.

Later at night Ken had arranged a counselor meeting and he seemed very odd. He was normally very cheery, practically dripping with enthusiasm. Now though, despite arranging the meeting, he seemed disinterested and almost paranoid. It seemed like he kept looking over his shoulder and at several points had even asked us.

“Do you all hear that, that chiming sound in the distance?” We all listened carefully, but none of us could.

“I can go take a look and see if some of the kids left their cabins and are messing around with some of the trinkets in the storage shed, I know there was an old cow bell out there.” Glen interrupted me quickly saying.

“I got a fever and that's the only prescription is more cow bell!” In a terrible Christopher Walken impression. I laughed despite the interruption, Whitney and Chelsea either didn't get it or didn't care while Ken glowered at him. We sat back down and Ken muttered again.

“I hear something out there....... someone is messing with me.” We sat in awkward silence for a bit longer until he told us we could leave without even discussing tomorrows agenda which had been the whole reason for the meeting.

We all thought it was very strange, but we started for the door. On the way, I thought I saw Ken moving towards a cabinet and I heard the clinking of glass bottles.

On the way out I tried to talk to Whitney and Chelsea about Bee and the girls bullying her. They seemed distracted by how Ken was acting and brushed me off saying they would take care of it, though I was not sure if they had really heard me. I gave up the attempt and returned to my cabin. Wasting no time, I put the light out and fell asleep.

I don’t know how long I was out but I remember being awoken by an odd chiming sound in the night. It was faint, not so loud that it woke everyone up but noticeable to those who were light sleepers. Hadn't Ken said he heard a bell or chime or something? I saw a few lights come on in the boy's cabin and figured a few campers had heard the sound too. I almost wrote it off and was about to go back to sleep when there was a tortured scream heard from the directors' cabin. I got up and rushed over to check it out.

I was not alone in hearing the sound and Whitney and Glen waited with the few campers who were awakened by the commotion while Chelsea and I went to look inside. It was a bad scene and we couldn't find Ken anywhere. The cabin had been thrashed and it looked like a bear had gone through it. The walls were shredded and the furniture smashed, there was no sign of him. I saw a few bottles on the ground near his chair and thought maybe this was some sort of weird drunken outburst and maybe he had left to clear his head. That did not explain the terrible damage to the cabin though.

“That drunk bastard left us alone with these kids, what an ass hole!” Chelsea blurted out, letting her real feelings be known.

“Yeah, I don’t know what the hell is going on but it’s not good.” I responded.

We were almost ready to leave empty handed but I noticed something strange near the desk. It was an odd little black box that upon closer inspection had been slightly opened. Inside was a soft padded interior and a recess that looked like it was made for some type of mask. This was really strange, neither of us knew what the significance was but I didn't like the chill I felt when I held the box, I could swear I head an ethereal chime in the distance that beckoned me. Chelsea looked at me, confused and upset. I realized I had been holding the box staring off into space.

“Are we leaving or what? She demanded. I shook my head and came out of the daze and responded.

“Sorry, not sure what came over me. Let's go tell the others that Kens gone.”

Back outside we meet up with Whitney and Glen to tell them the news. They were annoyed but not as surprised, since Glen had known about Ken’s drinking and had even said he would sometimes take random breaks for super long periods of time. He must have figured he was out getting hammered somewhere right now, but I was not so sure. If he was drunk why wreck his whole office? Why leave in the middle of the night and not finish all his booze here for that matter? None of this felt right. As we considered the problem at hand, we heard a shrill scream from the girl's cabin. Whitney and Chelsea rushed ahead, concern plain on their faces since they had left their wards unattended to look into the matter of the disappearing director.

We rushed on and saw the girls had all left the cabin and were standing outside, panicking and screaming. As we got closer, I asked one of them just what had happened and the only girl who had her wits still intact said that someone killed them. She was horrified like her friends but still seemed cogent so I asked her if she saw what happened.

“A big man, with a creepy mask. He had a weird chime when he stepped. Was holding an axe, he......he.” and she tapered off into sobbing.

I tried to comfort her but it was a bad scene. Other girls had similar accounts, they said someone or something had killed their friends. Glenn tapped me on the shoulder just then and told me that some of the girls said they had seen a large man exit the cabin shortly before the other girls woke up and saw their murdered friends. I heard another scream and saw Chelsea and Whitney emerge from the girl's cabin, ghost white. Chelsea looked dazed and Whitney threw up.

“Grace and Sasha are dead.” Chelsea muttered, barely able to parse the words through obvious shock and horror. Glen was trying to comfort Whitney who was trying to recover. I raised my voice and quickly asserted that.

“We need to call the police now! We need to get everyone together in the rec center and lock the doors. Has anyone seen Ken?” There was an awkward pause and looks back and forth to see if anyone had. Chelsea spoke up again.

“He got drunk, wrecked his office and now two kids are dead. I don’t think we should rule out that he may have been responsible for this.” She said with a grim look accompanying the heavy accusation.

“Whoa wait, you think Ken would kill kids! Why would he do that? He has run this camp for twenty years; how and why would he do that?” I asked with shocked disbelief. My tone disguised the slowly creeping feeling of acceptance in Chelsea’s reasoning. I hated to believe it but maybe she was right and he had just snapped. Before we could get into a back and forth about Ken and his motives there was a horrible flash and explosion and the boy's cabin burst into flames!

We raced over to find a raging fire where the cabin had been. A fiery explosion had engulfed it and to my dawning horror I realized the boys had still been in there, we hadn't had a chance to bring everyone to the rec cabin like we planned. I clutched my head in my hands and gawked at the horror of the situation when I saw movement near the flaming ruin. It was a tall figure shuffling forward and murmuring something. I thought it was Jacob, one of the taller kids, then I realized he was too large. I stopped moving forward and stared in disbelief when I saw it was someone else.

He was burned by the flames and had what appeared to be charred blood on his hands and shirt. He held a wood cutting axe in both hands and had a horrible pallid mask on that had a small chime connected to the top like the bobber on an angler fish. It tinkled when he stomped forward providing a jarring discordance with the huge figure's thundering footsteps. Glen stepped forward brandishing an oar from the canoes and in a quavering voice told the figure to.

“Back off! I’m warning you man leave us alone!” He swung the oar back and forth to illustrate the point. The masked man stopped moving and fell to his knees, clutching his head and letting out a pained scream. Through gritted teeth we heard the words in an all too familiar voice.

“Help me Glen........help.” We all realized that voice was Ken’s. Had he snapped after all?

Glen realized it was the director and moved forward cautiously. Ken was sobbing now his arms outstretched. Glen got closer and asked.

“Mr. Johnston what happened? What did you do? Before any of us could blink Ken grabbed Glen’s arm and stuttered out.

“You.....You all need to leave now, that sound, I can’t stop myself, I can’t......can’t.” And his body went momentarily inert like a marionette with its strings cut. Before Glen could even whisper a response Ken sat bolt upright and seized Glen by the throat and lifted him up. Then he threw him into the side of the burning cabin. Glen screamed as the flames licked at his clothes and before any of us could move in to help Mr. Johnston had raised the axe and embedded it into Glen's head with a wet crunch.

All of us screamed in unison at the cold-blooded murder we had just witnessed. There was another awful ripping sound as the axe came free from Glens lifeless body and the soulless eyes of the director turned murderer faced us. Whitney and Chelsea screamed and ran and I also turned to flee. I remember seeing Beatrice standing outside the girl's cabin looking at the spectacle. I ran towards here and implored her to get back inside and lock the doors but she just gently smiled and shook her head and pointed to me. I was confused by the gesture but I thought I had heard the faint sound of a bell and saw something in her other hand. I ran towards her but something struck me hard in the back of the head and everything went dark.

I woke up hours later in the girl's cabin; Beatrice was the only one there with me. She said the others had all been killed. The way she said it was oddly calm and dispassionate. Later the police arrived and it was determined the perpetrator of the terrible killings had been Ken Johnston. Drunk and driven into a homicidal rage he had killed almost every single camper and all the counselors but me. Police found him outside the cabins face down and soaked in blood surrounded by more corpses. Found on his person was a gore encrusted woodcutting axe and an odd mask with a chime on it. Later I heard that he insisted in his insanity plea that; “The mask made me do it, it spoke to me!”

Ken was later found guilty and sentenced to execution, During the trial it was discovered that he did have a real dark side to him. Evidence turned up that he had abused several campers in the past and paid them off or had threatened them to stay quiet. One case around sixteen years ago stated he had raped a camper and she had even gotten pregnant. Somehow, he had kept it under wraps and had paid the mother to keep quiet. The disturbing thing is that the mother had died recently and the name of the surviving child was one Beatrice Larkin.

I considered the only other survivor from that horrible night and thought about the implications. She was the right age and at the camp he worked at no less. Then I remembered the odd chiming sound and the hint of a memory replayed in my head of her holding a small bell and hearing it chime in tune with the disturbing mask’s chime and the bellows of pain and forced motion of Mr. Johnston as he was moved in time with the chiming sound.

What the hell was that bell and what was it really doing?

I don't know what really happened, though I suspect some impossible things. I never saw her again but if my creeping suspicion is confirmed, then they might not have stopped the right person and a killer is still on the loose.
