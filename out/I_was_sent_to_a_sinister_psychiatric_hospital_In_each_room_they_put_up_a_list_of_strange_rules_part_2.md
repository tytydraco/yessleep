Freddie went to the corpse of the undead woman. She lay sprawled on the hallway, a spreading pool of black blood surrounding her pale, lifeless form. Her milky eyes stared sightlessly up at the fluorescent lights as they continued their interminable strobing.   
  
“Alright, let’s do this,” Freddie said. I glanced up and down the hallway, seeing no sign of the wandering undead corpses. We had made sure to close the door tightly behind us. I hoped that following the rules would be enough to keep those abominations away, but I had my doubts.  
  
“A pound of flesh,” I whispered. The hallway was deathly silent except for the tinking of the lights overhead. Freddie gave me a strange look. “Shakespeare, you know.” Apparently, he didn’t. He just shrugged and knelt down. Without a moment of hesitation, he started sawing through the dead woman’s hand.  
  
“The bone is always the hardest part,” he said apathetically, as if he were talking about cutting up a Thanksgiving turkey. I watched in sickened fascination as he sawed through the flesh. Then he grabbed a random bedpan flung onto the side of the dirty hallway floor, put it under her hand and smashed his foot down on her wrist. The bone cracked with a sound like a muted gunshot. With a smile of accomplishment, he knelt down, picking up the hand.  
  
“What are you doing here, Freddie?” I asked suddenly. He looked up, his face glowering. “I mean, not here necessarily, but…”  
  
“I killed my girlfriend,” he said simply. “Well, she was cheating on me. I found her and the guy and shot them both in the head. I remember how my fingers traced the exit wounds under the moonlight, how still they seemed…” His eyes stared a thousand miles away. Then he abruptly snapped back, heaving a deep sigh. “They found me criminally insane. I think the nail in the coffin was the…” He hesitated for a long moment. “...the blood I drank from her body.” I gave him a sideways glance, waiting for the punchline.  
  
“Uh, what?” I said. “You… drank her blood?” He nodded grimly, his brown, cross-eyed stare showing no hint of emotional disturbance.  
  
“There was a lot of stuff going on at the time,” he responded, rubbing the back of his neck and shifting from foot to foot like a nervous schoolboy. “I thought my heart was stopping. I was hearing voices and seeing faces in the trees. The voices always came from outside, and soon, I couldn’t tell when people were really speaking to me, because they always spoke. The voices told me that her blood would heal my heart, it would heal all the damage done, and so I got a glass and put it under the bullet hole… and I drank it. I did. I admit it. I see now that I was sick, that I was wrong. Even if she was cheating on me, she didn’t deserve to die. But sometimes, things get… well, they get a little crazy and confused, and when that happens, sometimes I get a little crazy and confused, and make bad choices.  
  
“I’ve been in nuthouse after nuthouse since then. The last seven years of my life, I’ve been shuffled from one psych ward to another. I’ve been in mental hospitals where they keep you underground and you never see the light of day, ever. Then three days ago, the doctor said I was getting a transfer. I had responded well to my antipsychotics and cognitive-behavioral therapy, he said, and I would be going to a place with more freedom.  
  
“They drove me here in a closed van with no windows. I couldn’t see where we were going. Some guy in a black suit and sunglasses sat in the back with me, not talking. Then, when we pulled in, he leaned close to me and said the strangest damn thing.  
  
“‘Remember to follow the rules,’ he said. ‘At Whiting, the danger is real. It’s not in your head.’ I gave him an odd look. Then he shuffled me outside. I saw this building, this one we’re in right now. From the outside, it looks like a concrete cube. It has no windows whatsoever and only one door. It’s just plain, smooth, gray concrete on the outside, like some kind of government building from 1984.” He stopped speaking, cocking his head to the side. I thought I heard soft dragging from far down the hall. “We should keep moving. It’s not a good idea to stay in one place out here like this.” With that, he shepherded me through the silver-gray metal door labeled “Stairway”.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
The dark staircase loomed in front of us like a curtain of shadows. As my eyes adjusted to the dim lighting, I noticed they were switchback stairs, or stairs that went in abrupt 180 degree turns with flat landings between each of the sections. Narrow trickles of light streamed in through cracks in the doors and holes eaten in the walls. The door started to close behind me, but as it swung by in the darkness, I caught a glimpse of four bloody chips stuck into the wood. I grabbed it by the edge and leaned closer, inspecting the strange, slightly-curved objects. My breath caught in my throat when I realized they were bloody human fingernails. It looked like someone had tried to claw their way through the door in sheer animal panic.  
  
“Move,” Freddie whispered, breaking me out of my horrified reverie. “And close that goddamn door. Now.” I didn’t need to be told twice. Just the thought of what happened last time I left the door open made my heart turn into a block of ice. I silently pushed it closed.  
  
Holding the severed hand clenched tightly in his fist, Freddie walked forward, haltingly taking the steps down. He kept looking behind him, up and down, like a child checking for monsters under the bed. But here, the monsters were real.  
  
I heard a predatory inhalation that clicked and gurgled from the floor beneath us, seeming to go on for a long time. Freddie turned pale, and I had the sudden urge to just turn around and run. I didn’t want to see what was waiting below. I looked down and caught a glimpse of something totally alien peeking up at me. Its rounded, crimson head disappeared in a blur, but I knew it was stalking us.  
  
“Just… keep… walking…” Freddie said through gritted teeth, his eyes wide. I didn’t know if he was talking to me or himself. He held out the dismembered hand in front of him as if it were a sacred talisman used to ward off evil spirits. The railing shook slightly, and I realized I didn’t hear anything. The silence seemed deafening.  
  
Then the claws wrapped around the handrail in front of Freddie. The fingers looked like sharp, crimson railroad spikes. Something pulled itself up in front of us, moving as silently as death. I beheld the nightmarish spectacle, looking in awe at the killing machine that loomed over us.  
  
The Keeper was a dark red, the color of clotted blood. It had no eyes that I could see. It stood seven or eight feet high. It had a shining, chitinous exoskeleton that formed gently curving ridges over its long torso. I saw two holes for its nasal passages like those of a snake’s. Its head pointed forward like some sort of eyeless velociraptor. It had a strange combination of reptilian and insectoid features. As its jaw unhinged, it gave a predatory roar that echoed through the stairwell like thunder. Silver rivulets of saliva dripped from its gaping maw. Dozens of deadly spikes shone in its mouth, each as long as a pencil. They reminded me of the teeth of some monstrous deep sea abomination like a dragonfish.  
  
I backpedaled, my mortal terror screaming at me to turn and run. As soon as I had taken a single step backwards, though, the creature’s head ratcheted towards me in a blur, moving so fast that it seemed like a machine more than an animal.  
  
It took a step toward me, ignoring Freddie. A low growl rumbled out of its chest. I felt it in my bones. The stairs seemed to shake as it grew in intensity. I stared into the eyeless face as it lowered its sharp fangs towards me, making clicking sounds in its throat. It exhaled fumes that smelled like blood and sulfur directly into my face, but I didn’t dare even blink.  
  
Freddie threw the dismembered hand between me and the Keeper. It jerked, its head twitching back and forth from me to the piece of pale gore on the ground in front of it. It began gnashing its teeth, chittering in an alien tongue. It snapped up the hand from the ground like a toad snatching a fly from the air. I heard the crunching of bones as its sword-like teeth crushed it, sending out a spattering of blood that splashed onto my face. I didn’t dare wipe it off, though. I stood as still as a corpse, watching, waiting. Freddie loomed behind the Keeper, sweating heavily, his eyes wild, his whole body trembling.  
  
The Keeper gave one last rumbling, clicking growl before jumping up onto the railing. Using its claws, it climbed up and out of sight in a blur. The railings shook under its weight as I started forward again, feeling like a man who had just stared the Angel of Death in the face and lived to tell the story.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
We came out on the first floor. I carefully closed the door behind me, making sure it clicked shut. I didn’t want anything from that stairwell or those upper floors going through it.   
  
“Ugh, I could use some water after that,” Freddie said, his rubbery lips forming the faintest trace of a smile. “But, honestly, there are worse things in here than the Keeper. I feel like if I had enough time, maybe I could domesticate the Keeper, like some sort of alien dog.”  
  
“Yeah, you could give it treats of human fingers and hearts when it sits or rolls over,” I said, rolling my eyes. A large room opened up to our left. Freddie speed-walked right in there. I had to practically jog to catch up.  
  
I saw tables flipped over and rotten food scattered all over the floor. Patches of orange and red and black mold grew wild like trees in a jungle. A dead body lay in the center of the cafeteria, a woman in the same outfit as Freddie and me. Blood seeped from a deep wound in her back.  
  
“Oh my God,” I said. Freddie just ignored the corpse. He started to walk past without a downwards glance.  
  
But then the corpse moved. I heard choked, ragged breathing. I ran forward to the injured woman, flipping her over.  
  
Her eyes were rolling and her teeth were chattering. More blood kept spilling out of the wound, forming a spreading puddle around her torso. She inhaled deeply and seemed to come back for a few moments. Her eyes came back down and focused on me. She squinted, blearily flicking her eyes from me to Freddie.  
  
“I… almost got out…” she said, giving a faint smile. Frothy blood bubbled from her lips. “It’s in the keyroom. The key to the front door… is there… it’s in the back… on a big, black metal chain. But the guard…” Her eyes widened at the memory. “Oh God, the guard…” The whites of her eyes gleamed brightly as they rolled back in her head. She began to seize, kicking her feet and clenching her fingers. After a few seconds of this, she stopped. Her head fell limply to the side. She gave a long, shuddering death gasp.  
  
I looked up at Freddie, a rising surge of hope mixing with the horror of this innocent woman’s death. He had an excited, manic look on his face.  
  
“Jesus, the keyroom,” he whispered excitedly. “Of course there’s a key for the front door. I wonder who told her where it was.”  
  
“Well, let’s go get it!” I said excitedly.  
  
“After we eat and drink something,” Freddie said, gesturing to the kitchen with his head. “I need some strength. And you act like it’s so simple. Do you have any idea what the guard will do to us if he catches us sneaking around the keyroom?”  
  
“What is it, like, a human security guard?” I asked, though deep down I knew better. Freddie laughed, a sardonic giggle.  
  
“Yeah, OK,” he said, sneering. “A human. No, nothing here is ever normal. I caught a glimpse of the guard once and… well, you’ll probably see for yourself soon enough, but it’s horrifying. That thing definitely isn’t human.”  
  
\*\*\*  
  
There was barely any food in the kitchen. We found a jar of old peanut butter and started eating it. The fridges were filled with rotting meat and clotted, moldy dairy products. They emitted a sickening odor that seemed to seep into every corner of the room. The water tasted soapy and a little off, but I was so thirsty that I barely noticed, chugging cup after cup.  
  
“The keyroom’s just down the hall,” Freddie said, looking even paler and more nervous than in the stairwell. “She was right. It’s the only way. We have to get past the guard and get out. If we die here, no one will ever know what happened.” I nodded, but my stomach was doing flips. My heart palpitated in my chest as waves of fear shook me to the core.  
  
We walked past broken medical carts, shattered bottles, bloody knives and pieces of skin and gore that drew clouds of thick, black flies. The entire building smelled like a death camp. I felt that the smell of rotten meat and decaying bodies had likely filtered into my clothes by now.  
  
The keyroom was marked by a large sign. It had a wooden door with a safety glass window smeared with streaks of blood in the shape of a handprint. It did not seem like a favorable omen.  
  
As we got to the door, Freddie turned to me.  
  
“In and out, amigo,” he said curtly. “No fucking around. Got it? We go to the back, find the key on the big metal chain, and run. If the guard comes, we split up. At least one of us should get out alive.” I took a deep breath, bending over.  
  
“I don’t know if I can do this, man,” I said. “I’m fucking terrified right now. The rules say not to go in the keyroom, and it seems like breaking them leads to some crazy shit happening.” He shrugged. I knew we didn’t have a choice. I nodded. “OK, let’s do this before my nerve totally shatters.”  
  
He quietly flung open the door and we went inside.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
Thousands of keys glittered on the walls around us. Rows of cabinets divided up the huge room all the way to the back. Freddie quietly sprinted toward the back. I followed close behind, my head on a swivel. I didn’t see anything.  
  
We got to the back and began sifting through hundreds of keys on a desk. I saw one at the end with a massive, round steel chain attached to it. I sprinted over to it.  
  
A creature walked around the corner, something humanoid in a black night watchman’s uniform, but the creature had no eyes or nose. Its skin was smooth and white over its face, traced with a spiderwebbing of black veins. It grinned, showing off two long, vampiric fangs dripping with blood.  
  
The eyeless guard brought his hands up. To my horror, I saw giant, dark eyes in the center of both of his palms. The large pupils flitted to me and then to Freddie. The eyes on the hands blinked as the guard opened his mouth and gave an eerie, high-pitched shriek.  
  
I grabbed the key, turning to run for my life. Freddie and I split up, each sprinting through a different path past the open key cabinets that loomed overhead. I had my knife clenched tightly in one hand and the key in the other. Something hit me from behind and I went flying forward toward the door.  
  
“No!” Freddie shrieked, turning the corner and leaping over me in a few bounding steps. He had his knife raised. I flipped onto my back, trying to raise the knife as the guard looked down, his smooth, hairless face as white as freshly cut marble. Freddie crashed into it, bringing the blade down into the center of its head as he did so. The knife quivered there, shaking like a leaf.  
  
With a roar, the guard grabbed Freddie and yanked his neck back. Its vampiric fangs shot out like the teeth of a rattlesnake. They sunk deeply into his jugular. Blood spurted from the wound as I jumped up. I ran toward the guard with my knife out in front of me, intending to cut its throat.  
  
Its eye on its hand glared at me. The giant hand came up and smacked me. I fell and the knife went flying. Freddie’s breaths had started to come in slow, irregular gurgling by this point. His legs gave out and he collapsed, but the guard held him in its arms like a lover, drinking every drop of blood down to the dregs.  
  
Faint and on the verge of vomiting, I sprinted out the door of the keyroom, toward the front of the building. I found the key worked. The sunlight streamed in, beautiful and warm. I was surrounded by rolling hills in the middle of nowhere.  
  
It took me a long time to hitchhike out of that place, but I remember the way back. I went to the police, but they just laughed at me and called me insane.  
  
I just need someone to believe me. That place is Hell on Earth, and it needs to be shut down. It needs to be stopped before any more unsuspecting people get sent there.  
  
And I’d like to get the body back of the man who saved my life.
