It was Doc Martin who first reported something unusual. He was off the beaten path in his pickup, trying not to kick up dirt near the orange groves, when he saw a dog-like creature zipping and zagging through the field. Thinking it was a stray or a coyote of some sort, he did the neighborly thing and sped up to chase it away. But as he got closer, Doc said he never saw nothing like it.

"The thing was hunchbacked, and the notches on its spine looked like quills, so thick it was. And it had skin, dark gray almost flat black, leathery to the eye. I never saw its face, because when I realized it weren't no dog I ever seen. I slammed on the brakes. And it didn't pay me no mind.  Cut right, and took off back into the field as if it were chasing something. I almost hoped for whatever it was after - got away, but then I remembered...at least it isn't me."

\*

A couple of days later, I got another call in the office. This time it came in the form of Maisey Turner. She lived out in the sticks by herself and watched a few acres. But it weren't the field she was calling me about.

"My chickens are dead," she told me. "Something got to them."

Now Maisey's been a country girl all her life, and was born to raise chickens and hell water. Producing some of the finest eggs and the best shine to go with them, I'd stake my reputation on that; which meant that she was used to being alone and in dangerous situations. So when she called me with an undulated tremor in her voice, about problems with her coop. I made it a priority to drive out there and take a gander at it myself.

"Nine dead in the last week. I'd come out here in the morning and find their lifeless bodies on the ground." She took me to a gray hen sprawled in the dirt, "This one here, only this morning."

There didn't look to be any signs of a struggle. No feathers at least, or broken claws, not even entrails for that matter. But what troubled me more was that there were no visible exit or entry wounds. Where were most common with a wolf or fox attack. And when I picked up the cock maiden, it felt light in my hands. The word dry felt right.

I used my fingers first, checking for any broken bones; there were none. And then looked between the feathers to see if we were dealing with some kind of disease. It was during this search in which my fingers rubbed against two raised bumps on the side of its neck, hiding beneath the plumage.

We plucked the bird to get a better look, and it would be Maisey who uttered it, "It looks like incision marks." She ran her own fingers over the bumps. "Fine," she drew out the word. "Almost surgical, needle-work." She split the hen through the ribcage with a sharp knife, and not a single drop of blood spilled. "Its been bled."

Her observations would catch like fire in the bush, and wake up our sleeping town.

The murmurs trembled through our town, a lot of cockamamie theories procured by restless locals as harvesting season neared its end. Outlandish propagations perspired of Bat-boys and aliens. Or the U.S. government testing behavioral sciences in controlled populations. I heard many of these conspiracies until one finally stuck. It was more of a name, but once it was heard, I'll admit, nothing else seemed capable of replacing it.

I wasn't present during the event, however, eyewitness testimonies said that it started in the diner when Ainsley Adams was telling Jared the wrangler and Mercury the waitress about his newfound revelation. "Come on, it's hairless. Has quills on its back. AND it drains chicken's blood? That's got to be it. The Mexican scourge." He drummed the counter, "El Chupacabra."

"El Chupa-what-now," the Wrangler asked.

"Chupacabra," Adams repeated. "The Goat Sucker."

"Then why hasn't it killed goats," Mercury questioned.

And the rest became town history.

\*

"What happened next," I was interviewing Michael Wembley who had seen the entire thing, "Mike?"

"It kills other livestock too, Adams said, and he said that it was the d-devil's. After that, Reverend Santos stepped in."

"And then," I encouraged.

"Well, the two got into a heated row, and uh, I think that the Reverend was upset about the use of his, well, his, well-you-know, heritage so to speak. And then comparing it to the devil. It's a bad look, I remember him saying. The Reverend, that is, said it made Mexicans a scapegoat for our problems." Mike paused again. "Then that's when Ainsley and the Wrangler couldn't keep it serious no more. Started...started humiliating the Reverend by laughing right in his face." Michael took off his hat, "They didn't mean nothing of it, Sheriff, I believe it was just....It was a poor choice of words...is all."

"And that's when the initial altercation took place?"

"Yup. That's when the boy bit him. The Reverend's boy."

"Bit who?"

"Ainsley, for laughing in his father's face, I reckon."

"Then the fight broke out?"

Michael shrugged uneasily, "It wasn't much of a fight. I say. Ainsley was just trying to get the boy off his hand. You know?"

"Did he hit the boy?"

"More like pried the boy's teeth off of hisself. It was his right hand you know? Ainsley's right hand. That's his throwing hand."

"And then what happened after they got the boy loose?"

"Ainsley, God fearing boy he be. Right? Tried apologizing. But the boy, the Reverend's son wasn't having it. The boy was mad, furious-like. Scared me half to death if I do be honest. All that fury," he shuddered.

I tipped my hat and thanked him, "I'm going to talk to others now. But I'll holler if I need any more information."

"Sure thing." He called after me. "You're not going to arrest him right? The football game is this week."

I waved my notepad in the air and walked over to Ainsley who collaborated a similar story. So did Jared and Mercury, as we stood outside on the curb. When I was done getting their order of events, I questioned the Reverend Santos and his son last.

"Father," I told him. "I apologize for the formalities." He had been the head of our church for come near 15 years now, and I was always present for Sunday Mass and confessionals. "I have to get this report down for legal purposes. As I'm sure the judge would want to see it in the morning."

"I doubt Eugene will need to see this," Reverend Santos told me.

"I'm not so sure," I said. "The case involves a child and, it'll be up to his honor what he chooses to do or not do."

The Reverend intervened, "The boy is fine." He nodded toward Ainsley, "And if he doesn't press any charges. I don't see any reason to escalate this any further." He then included in a hushed tone, "I'd rather not let this encounter mire any longer. It could be unfavorable for the church."

I took a glance at his son, Allen, and save for a pinkish smudge next to his left nostril. He seemed unscathed. "You're all right sport?"

"I'm fine," Allen told me. "Tougher than I look."

The Reverend gave me a knowing nod, and so I walked over and discussed the terms with Ainsley who was all too happy to be on his way. So I put the event behind us that night, without realizing, how big this whole thing would get in the coming days as Ainsley's envision of a Chupacabra captured the minds and hearts of our residents. If Maisey Turner had built the fire, then Ainsley Adams was the promethesis who brought forth the flames.

Now I don't know what's the fascination with Big Foot or the Loch Ness, or even why it drives the imaginations of some people. Perhaps it's the idea that there's something unknown out there, lurking in the woods, while we're sipping our coffee or washing our faces at night. An unexplainable phenomenon in the mundane that makes our orderly lives feel less like a sentence and more like a choice if we so chose.

What I do know is that that month in August, I saw more reports on my desk than I cared for, which was why I found myself outside of the office most days to investigate some hearsay - for the lack of a better term. Which was when my deputy, Taylor, shed some light on this mystery.

Our conversation began as we were going down Forks road, I drove while Taylor scanned the fields.

"There's some people in it for the money or the fame, that's for sure. But it's scary alright. Something wandering in the woods at night. I mean, just imagine the first peoples who saw the reflection of a tiger's eyes in the reeds. Watching them. Glowing. Deep in the jungle as night fell. They probably didn't know what it were. If they were safe or not; Their children. Or even if they could fight it. It must have looked like the devil."

"Now that's fear I can understand," I told him. "It's rationale even. Logical. But now, with today's technology. There's nothing we can't lay to rest on God's green Earth. So what's to fear?"

"See that's what makes it even more exciting. And dangerous even. With all the smart phones and cameras. Elephant guns and what not. People going about every which way," he broke off, "Do you know about something called Google Earth? There's legions of people who just scroll through every inch of the world, watching it nakedly...you'd think someone would have discovered something by now. Hunted it down."

"But they haven't," I said. "Or else we'd be seeing it on the News."

"Which only grows to the mystery. See that's the thing, people have always reported sightings that didn't make any sense within gaps in history. Imagine a 1000 years ago, if you told folks you'd seen a dragon up north. They'd be wise to believe you when traveling. But fast forward 500 hundred years; A few before 1677 when the scientific community acknowledged the first fossils; Well, they'd laugh you right out of the room and tell you that God didn't make any dinosaurs. Then fast forward again to the present time, and anyone can go up to a museum and see it for themselves, and maybe come to the conclusion on how ancient peoples could have mistook one for a dragon's bone."

"That's a contradiction at best but not a correlation."

"It's all relative," he argued. "People today are saying that they've seen things, still see it. Well, doesn't make you wonder, what keeps such a thing illusive? Other than, none of its real victims ever get away."

"That's why you think none are ever found? Okay smart guy, then tell me why we don't have any fossil records or breeding grounds for these things? If they've existed alongside us for so long."

"I'm uncertain, but perhaps we have already seen them. Mistook them, even, for other things. Maybe their bones are scattered amongst other-like creatures, and we haven't sorted them properly. Maybe," he added, "They aren't as distant as we imagine, almost like-a, missing link. And so they can hide themselves within a population."

It was then that I pulled to a stop out on Carter farm, next to Carter field, in front of William Carter the 3rd. Whom was conveniently on his porch, shotgun in hand and a redbone hunting dog at his feet.

"Whatever you do, keep them thoughts to yourself," I told Taylor. "We're on business."

"I'm always professional," he slapped on a wayward smile.

"I'm serious," I told him. "Act natural. These people here start getting wind that authorities are feeding the shit. Then they just might start telling everyone that we're condoning this type of behavior, or worse, that we're incompetent. Then next thing you know there's a mob out front of my house trying to push a vote to replace me with some God-fearing Christian."

"I thought you were a God fearing-"

"Awfully nice day," I shouted as William Carter the third approached our vehicle. It looked as if he had been drinking. Smelled like it.

"Nothing good about it," William said. "Have to be out here with you bunch of hippies," he hiccupped. "When I could be out working my field."

"Then I'll try not to waste too much of your time Will. You already know we're here because somebody said they heard you unloading shells off on the property last night."

"By somebody you mean Auggie." William spit on the ground. "Yeah, I sure did. Heard something out in my cornfields last night. Got the pooch all up in a spark, barking and what not. So I run outside but I didn't have my light on me. But I had my gun."

"So you saw it. Clearly," I emphasized.

"Couldn't see worth a damn." He sounded angry, "I told you I ain't have my light."

"But you still tried shooting at it," Taylor asked.

"Course I shot at it," William mouthed. "Can't let them thangs get started on you, for you know it, be run over."

"What things," Taylor asked rather excitedly.

"Aliens."

Taylor shot me a look.

"Will, you're saying there were aliens out on your field last night?"

He spit on the ground, "Sure am. Saw one crouched over there near the corn line. Big 'un. I leveled my gun but didn't shoot. No sir. Not until I saw the littler one come up next to it. That's when I knew, that I had to kill them. Didn't want to end up being on no extraterrestrial training exercise. If you know what I mean." He added, "I was in the war. I know how these things work."

Taylor was nearly bulging beside me, and he finally couldn't contain himself any longer. "Did you go after them?"

Carter looked at me as if Taylor had suggested the most outlandish thing said in the past minute, before turning his eyes back on my deputy. "No, you nit. There are gopher holes that'll roll an ankle in that kind of dark. And snakes and spiders, and all kinds of other crawlies that'll get in your jimmies at night if you go out into the cornfield. Not to mention. Them aliens want you out there. Home field advantage," he finished.

"But wouldn't you be the one to have-"

I cut Taylor off, "William. Besides what you saw, what makes you think that it wasn't a couple of stray dogs or a wolf with her litter."

William smirked and slung his shotgun over his shoulder, "I'll show yah."

He led us into the field, the husks of corn scratching up our arms as we trudged deeper into the interim.

"I can't see the patrol car from here," Taylor whispered.

"I can't even see the house," I told him.

"Hey," Taylor complained. "Why you ain't cut these things down yet? Harvest season's over."

"I'm lazy," William retorted before abruptly stopping. "There she is," he told us. " I found it laid up here this morning."

The three of us had come unto a clearing, except it wasn't dirt beneath our feet but the long weeds of corn stalks laid promptly flat. It reminded me of an indentation left in carpeting after a piece of furniture had been left sitting. In this case, the furniture would be about 20 foot wide by about 12 foot or so, difficult to measure as it was an almost oblong shape.

"Must have landed the mothership right here," William touted. "Wish I could have said I seen her, but I'm no liar. Nothing but the moon in the sky that night, I reckon."

I crouched to the floor and took a closer look. The stalks had been laid flat by something heavy. But the broken stalks at various segments indicated to me that it didn't happen all at once. As it would be, I can only imagine, in the event of a ship of any sorts descended on Carter field. The damage seemed to have been trampled into form. I put my palm down between one or two of the broken bits, the gaps between them were bigger than my hand. I stood up and put my size 12 boot on it, for reference.

"Larger than my foot too."

"This ain't no crop circle," Taylor exclaimed.

"No," I agreed. "Something made this. Something live."

William looked as if someone had stabbed him in the gut, "How would you know that?"

"I tell you, I've seen this before. On the Discovery channel or something." Taylor snaps his fingers, "The um, the uh, gorilla hive or something. Their nest in the African jungle. Looks just like this."

"You're saying there be gorillas here," William ask ludicrously.

"Far better guess than aliens," Taylor retorted.

"How you come to reckon that," William nearly shouted. "At least aliens could fly here. What's a gorilla going to do? Catch a Guber?"

"What's a goober?"

"An Uber for primates."

"Uber is an Uber for primates!"

"Try getting a gorilla in one then."

"Will you two," I tried not to raise my voice. "Just can it for a second so I can hear myself think?"

"What's there to think about," William said, "It's aliens."

I lifted the stalks about, trying to look for any signs of wildlife. A tuft of hair or a print on the bare ground. All difficult things to conceal if it were indeed an unintelligent life form. I motioned for Taylor to do the same. And soon the three of us were turning the place over.

After nearly half an hour, I lifted a handful of stalks and saw what I had been hoping for.

"I've got something here," I told them.

William whistled, "Dog's don't pick up their own shit, that's for sure."

"Well it ain't shit," I told them. "But it might just be what we're looking for."

Taylor took a look at the oozing red substance I had scooped up with the end of my pen, and within the same breadth he ushered, "I'll go get the kit," before disappearing into the cornstalks.

About a year ago, we got a forensics kit from a department upstate. They had extras after a missing child's investigation. And the things were bound to expire if they kept 'em stockpiled. So they sent 'em out to the surrounding areas to see if they'd be of any use. And ever since we received one, Taylor's been itching to use it.

After about ten minutes he comes running back to the clearing, with the black hard cased foam in hand. He unzips the kit and unwraps a small glass vial with an orange top, and peeled back a sanitary stick. Then he bent down to where I had been moments before and took a swab at the puddle of blood that had been sinking into the dirt. "Still immutable enough to be viable," he stated as if he had prior experience.

Taylor twisted the vial and dropped the sample inside. And then opened up a liquid packet, shook it, and dumped it in. Swirling the stick inside the solution, "It'll be about a minute."

"A minute before what," William asked.

I watched in silent interest as the liquid within the clear viral swirled. And I watched it. Until it turned the opaque substance into a pee yellow.

"Human blood," Taylor breathed. "It's a human's blood."

"Maybe I got 'em," William's said.

"Maybe you did," I told him. "Let's search the area. The body might be nearby."

"Or they could still be alive," Taylor said. He cupped his hands, "Hello! Is anyone out there?" And then in a lower voice Taylor said, "Or any thing."

This caused the three of us to look around. I could hear the trombone on Williams' shotgun rattle as he unhinged it from his shoulder.

We were surrounded by 7 foot tall cornstalks, and hadn't 3 feet of visibility beyond this bit of clearing. And although I had grew up on a farm myself. I suddenly realized that if there were indeed something out there still. How vulnerable our positions were as every distant rustle in the field became less stray rabbit or touch of the wind.

"Come on," I urged, "Let's take a look."

"Maybe I should get back to the house," William started. "This is policing after all. And it ain't my job."

"You could," I told him. "Though it would be faster with the three of us." I paused. "But you're more than welcome to return on your own," I motioned back into the field, "If you'd like."

William Carter the third, suddenly looked unsure of himself. Before muttering something about how it would be faster to get us off his property if he helped; then so be it. And sandwiched himself between Taylor and I as I followed the blot on the ground to a row of nearby stalks.

In the underbelly of a corn leaves, I found them coated with blood. I flipped over a few more, and pushed ahead, searching the stalks for the trail; flipping and pushing, flipping and pushing, flipping and pushing as our pace quickened as the blood thickened; coating my arms and legs as each push through the brush left behind sliver thin knife marks covered in blood, except it wasn't mine.

About 30 yards in, stalks were strewn on the floor again. Here or there. And a few more yards beyond that, an image which would haunt me as I drove back into town. A small unassuming shape in the dirt, no bigger than a pitcher's mound was hunched where it shouldn't be.

&#x200B;

Twilight glistened over the town as I pulled into the diner. It had been a long day and a good dark brew was needed before I contacted the next of kin. When I arrived, I didn't expect it to be packed, for the day's events had made me forget that this was an important time of the year for the hunters in our community. The sidewalks were lined with trucks, each bristling with gear, ready to kill.

I pushed my way, where Mercury served me at the counter, "Is everything okay, Sheriff?"

I sighed, "I'll let you know as soon as I can." I put down my coffee on the counter, "Have you seen the Reverend?"

"What's it got to do with the Reverend," Mercury asked.

"I'm sorry," I told her. "It's official business." And then restructured my question, "Did the Reverend stop by tonight?" She shook her head. I turned to the other patrons, "Has anyone seen the Reverend Santos?"

"He's locked up the Church for the weekend, remember? Something about self meditation or w-what not," Michael Wimbley mummed.

Jared the Wrangler smiled, "What an opportune time, too. It means we can go hunting tonight boys," he shouted to a crowd of cheers.

"No one's going out into the fields tonight," I ordered. "In fact, there's going to be a curfew."

"What?"

"You can't do that!"

"Aww man, come on," the Wrangler complained, "It's the hunter's moon tonight! The farmers will have cut down their fields by now for some easy pickings."

"What's going on," Michael asked.

Every pair of eyes in the diner turned to me. And they were expecting answers. Which left me no choice but to divulge some information to the public, "There's been a murder."

"Shit."

"Now hold on," I yelled.

"Confounded, what's this town turned into."

"When my mama..."

"Will everyone quiet down," I yelled.

"It's all that tap water. I tell you what."

"Everyone!" I shouted.

But it was just then when Augustus 'Auggie' Abraham came bursting through the diner. He looked in a riffled state as he tried to catch his breath.

"The Reverend's boy is dead," he gasped. "Found laid up in Carter's field. Claw marks! Claw marks torn into his body. It's the Chupacabra!"

I ran forward and grabbed Auggie by the collar, "Who did you tell?"

His eyes grew wide as deer's, "Everyone," he blurted. "Everyone!"

I turned and felt eyes burning into me. Without realizing it, I had confirmed his accusations publicly. Then a loud monotone ring from my cellphone interrupted the uneasy silence.

It kept ringing.

The only noise in the entire diner at this point, less the fryer sizzling behind the counter and the forced breathing.

And ringing, so I picked it up and barked, "What is it Taylor?"

It was quiet enough in the diner for everyone to hear him fighting for air on the other side. The sounds of the field slapping into the microphone as he ran. "It's here. It's chasing us."

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

My predecessor wrote the book on mob control. And by book I meant he scribbled down a quarter page in the manual that was once his sheriff's log. It didn't say much, although it warned about the dangers of mob mentality. And how free time, coupled with an unusual death, could only spell trouble.

Our town had plenty of that as the harvest had come to a close.

But it left out a lot of details. One of them being, what to do about it.

The folks at the diner had jumped into their trucks, their guns already at the ready, and drove off before I could even utter the word 'curfew' again. Not that I could have done much to stop them as red hot blood coursed through their veins as Main street was filled with people rushing out to find something to do with their thumbs.

So I did the only thing reasonable, which was to push on with my original agenda. And made my way to the church.

Inside the church, it was dark, but mysteriously quiet as the door shut out the noise behind me. I noted that the pews were upturned in neat rows.

"I'm cleaning the bottoms," came a voice near the altar.

"Father."

He was dressed in a purple gown, the hood pulled over his head.

"I was expecting you," he told me.

"I'm really sorry for it to come like this..."

"Do not be afraid my son," he told me.

I paused. "You've been expecting me?"

"I already know," he said as he stepped forward.

Now the Reverend Santos was a decently sized man. But tonight he looked taller than usual. Larger in fact. And I don't know why but instinctively I wanted to reach for my gun. I was forced to remind myself that he posed no danger, and that he never had. Even if it would be grave news to give.

"Father, your son."

"I told you," he slowly said. "I already know."

"How? Was it Auggie? I apologize, Father. Small town," I tried. "Word spreads quickly. But if it means anything. I wanted you to hear it from me first."

The Reverend shook his hooded head, but I could still not see his face.

"No, not Augustus," he breathed. "I heard you in the field."

"You heard me from the field?"

He shook his head again, "No, not from the field. From here."

I felt my knee's forcing me back. "H-how could you have heard me?"

The words had no sooner escaped from my mouth when the hooded figure bound down the aisle into two large leaps and pushed me to the floor. I reached for my pistol but it was clattered away by a single blow that left my hand stinging.

Hot putrid breath washed over my face and seeped into my nostrils.

I looked up and saw that the hood had fallen, revealing the Reverend's face. Except it was darker than before. And his ears. His ears! They were long and pointed at the ends!

I tried to lift my shoulder but the Reverend nailed me to the floor with one hand. And then stared into my eyes. Daring me to look at him.

Then the most horrible sound I have ever heard churned into my ear.

It sounded like bones breaking, twisting and churning in their sockets, rotating by the ends of their tendons. In horror I watched as the Reverend's face shifted underneath his skin. Elongating his mouth, stretching his lips until they were blue, until a snout appeared. His skin filled with ink, blotching his arms and legs and then covering his entire face. And his is eyes, they glowed so brightly that it turned from dark brown to the devil's yellow.

I tried to scream but he snapped his teeth at me, each incisor longer than any of my fingers. Snarling inches away from my face. And then in a low raspy voice he asked, "Aren't you going to tell me what big ears I have?"

Before I could answer, the Reverend lifted his snout into the air and howled. And after he was done he snarled again, " I apologize, however, the transformation is difficult to control in the beginning." He growled, "But I am fine now. And I mean no harm."

"You're the Chupacabra," I breathed.

"Werewolf," he roared!

"What?"

He lifted his weight off and stepped back, "I'm balding."

I couldn't believe what I was hearing, I wanted to scream but instead it turned into a crack on my face, "You've got to be kidding me."

"Whats! So! Funny!" He barked.

"It's just," I tried not to laugh. "But you've got a head full of hair. Usually."

"What's bald to a werewolf is different than to a human!"

"Okay," I held up my hands. "All right."

"Listen," he shouted. "We don't have much time. There's something out there."

"It wasn't you then?"

He shook his head, "No. I would never hurt my own son. It was something else." Then he turned towards the door, "And we must stop it! Before it kills anyone else."

"Wait," I shouted. "Hold on! Just a minute!" I tried to catch my bearings. "It's difficult not to believe...you. But I need some answers," I demanded.

"Speak then," he snapped, "But quickly."

"How did you get to be this way?"

"It happened a long time ago before I devoted myself to the cloth. I was a treasure hunter, searching for lost tombs in The Valley of the Kings when I came upon a sealed tomb with the words scrawled above it, "Only Night," he translated.

He paced between the pews, the back of his legs arched as he did so, "After that I was cursed to turn into this abomination whenever the moon grew." He dropped to all fours. "But when the sun peers above the horizon again. I return to my normal form."

"So you'll turn back then?"

"Yes," he growled.

"And that was you that Doc Martin saw?"

"Yes."

"What about Maisey's chickens?"

"What? Chickens. No," he roared. "That wasn't me. Now enough with your silly questions. We must hunt down this creature!"

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

I've never met a werewolf until today, and I didn't know if they could be trusted. But what I do know is that the Reverend believes this thing out there killed his boy, and God has created few motivators as powerful as revenge.

So when the Reverend tore through the Church doors and bounded down the road. I didn't stop him. Not that I could have if I wanted to, I thought to myself, as I looked down at the tiny peashooter in my hand.

Which was a good thing why I had a shotgun in the trunk, loaded with slugs for an occasion much unlike this one, but would do nevertheless.

A steel slug could tear through an intruder, the wall behind them, go through the neighbor's house, and kill a full grown caribou on the other side.

And that was exactly the kind of firepower I needed.

I put the patrol car into gear and chased after him. Cutting through Main street until I reached open fields. Most of the farmers had already cut or burned their fields to the ground. But enough of them hadn't that the remnants still haunted the land with their ghostly shells, stripped clean of anything worthy of use.

At the edge of some fields I saw some trucks lined up, as I drove by. People shouting and shooting their guns in the air as if they were having a good time. Not understanding the gravity of the situation.

I had been driving for near 10 minutes before the Reverend suddenly cut across the road in front of me. The first time I saw more than his shadow since we left the church. I pulled the wheel across my chest and tore off after him. Ramming the sulking sunflowers with the hood of my car.

The lights and gunfire behind me disappearing in the night as only the sounds of my sirens and the occasion thump thump of the fauna being crushed underneath kept me company as I stayed on the Reverend's tail.

Suddenly something comes crashing out from the right and tackles the Reverend across the field.

It was large and it stood on its hindlegs. Its incisors were dripping wet with saliva, and it was covered in long matted fur as it raised its snout to the moon and howled.

The noise chilled me to my bones as I slammed on the brakes and came to a crushing halt.

I clutched the shotgun in my hand as the sounds of their growls and snarls were blind in the distance ahead of me.

And I would have stayed that way if a pounding at my window didn't shake me loose.

"Sheriff," it was Taylor. He was the one pounding on my window. "Sheriff!"

I rolled down my window. "How did you find me," I asked in a daze.

"What? The lights, the siren. I don't know" he shouted. "Just open the god damned door!"

I shook my head trying to snap out of it, "No. I told him. We have to help."

"Help?! Help who!"

"The Reverend."

"What are you talking about!"

I got out and popped the trunk, "There's no time," I tried to explain. "Just know that the bald one's the Reverend, and he's trying to help. The hairy one's the thing that got the boy." I thrust a shotgun into Taylor's hands. "Let's go."

And to my deputy's credit, he mostly shut up and marched. The two of us crept through the cornfield towards the noise, towards danger.

"I should have become doctor like my mother told me to," Taylor whined.

"Quiet," I hissed. "Try not to draw attention," I whispered as we crouched between the vegetation, front row seats to the fight.

"Holy-"

There was blood everywhere. The broken stalks were turned into upright stakes. Taylor watched, mouth gapped, as the two beasts fought. Their claws hooking into each other with each slash.

"I can't get a clear shot," I told Taylor.

He didn't answer.

"Taylor!"

"What. What? Yeah." He leveled his gun. But didn't shoot. "He's losing."

"What," I asked.

"The Reverend's got no fur. No protection. He's going to die."

"That's why we have to help," I yelled at him.

"R-right," he answered numbly. "Right."

But before we could be of any service. The hairy wolf grabbed the Reverend by the arm and with one sickening rip, he pulled the Reverend's arm from his elbow. Throwing the gnarled limb nearby, and spraying us with blood.

My eyes stung as I tried to wipe away the blood. Taylors mouth was covered with it but he still let it hang open like a trout out of water. At his feet I noticed that the Reverend's severed arm was no longer grey or leathered. No, instead it had reverted back to its human form.

With the Reverend out of commission, the moon might as well have been a spotlight on us. And the werewolf turned in our direction looking ready to charge.

If it weren't for the stupid horn and the Wrangler ramming his truck into the werewolf. I think Taylor and I would have died on the spot.

The truck smashed into the werewolf unceremoniously and then flipped over onto its side.

Out of the wreckage I witnessed Mercury crawling out, clutching her head as blood trickled down her face right before the monster jumped on her. She didn't have time to scream as the werewolf grabbed her torso with one hand, and her legs with the other. And ripped her in two.

At the sight of poor Mercury I fired a slug. It hit the werewolf in the chest. Blood pooled out from the wound but all it didn't seem to slow him down.

"That's right motherfucker! Come on," I shouted angrily.

The werewolf dropped to all fours as I stepped out to pasture, revealing the mushroom sized wound on its back. Which meant that this thing could bleed. And if it could bleed, it could die. I aimed my shot as it leapt toward me, but I missed. Quickly I tried opening my shotgun to reload, but I wasn't fast enough.

"HAW," came the Wrangler who threw his lasso over the werewolf's head as he yanked the beast backwards, attempting to choke it to the ground. "YEE! YEE," Jared shouted as he swung around the werewolf's back and hung on.

The werewolf bucked and reached a claw behind itself, tearing open Jared the Wrangler's shoulder. But still old boy held on. "Shoot it," he yelled.

"I can't get a clear shot," I shouted.

"Shoot it!"

It was then that Taylor stood up  beside me and shot the creature.

I watch the blood splatter the sky. The bullet going clean through.

But it didn't fall. Taylor shot it again. And then reloaded.

The beast crumpled to one knee, but still it did not die. The body of the Wrangler on its back, now a ragdoll being held by the rope, was lifeless.

The werewolf rushed at us, and we unloaded the slugs.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

And then the beast fell.

I looked over at Taylor, and he was covered in blood. But alive. And I said to him, "I told you that there's nothing that we can't lay to rest on God's green Earth."

He didn't look at me, but instead dropped his gun and stumbled over to where the pieces of Mercury's body laid. I always knew he had a soft spot for the young lady, so I looked away. But couldn't help hearing, "You flew too close to the sun. Didn't you girl?"

I turned and walked closer to the beast, which was now rapidly shrinking. The hairs falling off its body turned from black to a light brown, revealing the human corpse of one former, Ainsley Adams. I knelt beside the poor lad and looked at all of his wounds, but one stood out. On his right hand was the imprints of a small row of teeth. I held it up in the moonlight.

"I didn't know it was transmutable," came a low gurgling voice.

I whirled to see the Reverend in the dirt and mud. His arm missing and deep slashes across his chest. I rushed over to help but by the time I got there he was dead. All I could do was cover his eyes.

"Well," Taylor's voice came from beside me. "What now?"

"We're going to have to call this in."

"Whose going to believe us," he asked. "All of our key witnesses are dead."

I patted him on the back as I stood up, "I'm just glad you're still alive Taylor. Now come on, let's get back to the car."

We walked through the cornfield until we found our vehicle. Neither one of us had said another word until we plopped down in our seats.

"I can't believe it was werewolves."

I shook my head, "That was not on my bingo card."

"They're going to lock us up and throw away the key if we tell this story."

I sighed, "Maybe we could test the blood? And prove to them what we're saying is real."

At my suggestion, Taylor's eyes lit up as he scrounged the floor of the vehicle until he procured the forensics kit. He broke it open as before and prepped it, then wiped a smudge of blood from his face into the vial as the two of us watched it closely.

The solution swirled inside, slowly turning from opaque to a pee yellow.

And the two of us threw our heads back into the headrest and groaned.

"They're definitely not going to believe us."

"Nope," I agreed.

"Werewolves, huh," he said again.

I nodded.

"In Carter field, huh?"

"Yup."

"Doc's story?"

"It was the Reverend."

Taylor laughed, "I still can't believe it." And shook his head. "Wait, what about the chickens?"

I shrugged again as I started the car, "I don't know."

"It wasn't the Reverend?"

"Said it wasn't him."

And that's when Taylor turned to me with a stupid look on his face.

"Don't," I warned him. "Don't you fucking say it."

"Chupacabra."
