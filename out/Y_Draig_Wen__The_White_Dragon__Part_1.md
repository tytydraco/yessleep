(Author note) 
Hi there ! This is my first attempt at writing up an idea of a story I’ve pondered over for a while , never written anything to this extent so I thought I’d give it a shot ! Please enjoy and any feedback would be greatly appreciated. This is the first part and will be updating with new parts soon 


Part 1 

The road to Blaen dyffryn grew more desolate with every mile, the landscape slowly crumbling into forgotten scrubland as my battered old Peugeot struggled to dodge potholes and scattered debris. The miles ticked by in a dull rhythm, each bump a reminder that this car should have been put out of its misery years ago.

Eventually, even my GPS gave up. After a prolonged and despairing “Recalculating…”, it flickered and died, leaving behind only the dismal reflection of my own face staring back at me — a perfect picture of frustration and disappointment. I sighed and pulled over, hoping to fiddle with it. Truth be told, I had no idea where I was anymore. I’d never ventured this far out of Cardiff, but work for supply teachers had all but dried up. So when I saw a listing from a rural primary school offering double my usual pay, I jumped at the chance. Desperation makes optimists of us all.

I found a layby barely visible beneath overgrown shrubbery — just enough room to pull over. But as I stopped, the front bumper caught on something with a gut-wrenching crunch. I winced and looked out the window before stepping into the drizzle to inspect the damage.

The landscape was unnerving. Fog spilled down the rolling hills like smoke from some slow, silent fire. Nothing stirred but the occasional sheep huddled together like survivors. The rare structures were lit only by dim orange bulbs, barely cutting into the mist. Then the rain began again, heavier than before, pounding the roof of the car like it meant to dent it. I hesitated. Whatever I’d snagged could wait. No point soaking myself.

Back inside, I wrestled the GPS off the windscreen with a reluctant pop. It slipped from my grip, bounced off the passenger seat, and cracked against the window with a faint spiderweb of damage. Typical. “Piece of shit,” I muttered, jabbing at the buttons, smacking it against the steering wheel. Nothing. Dead. With a grunt of frustration, I hurled it onto the passenger side floor .

I turned the ignition again. The headlights flared to full beam and punched through the fog — illuminating a worn sign up ahead:

⸻

‘BLAEN DYFFRYN — Croeso I’n Cartref — Welcome to Our Home’

⸻

I exhaled in relief. Nearly there. The road curved toward the sign — though “road” might have been generous. It was more like a wide, stony path, but I wasn’t complaining. As I approached, I noticed some subtext etched beneath the warm welcome:

⸻

‘Please ignore any unexplained phenomena. If in danger, report to the local parish council.’

⸻

Cozy. Probably just some local attempt at humour. I shook my head and carried on.

For a “village,” the place was bigger than I expected. As I descended into what passed for civilisation, the layout unfolded like a half-remembered dream — or a memory someone was trying to forget.

Perched on the side of a valley, the road in gave a clear view of the whole place. A cluster of neat terraced houses sat at the centre, their slate roofs thick with moss and chimneys leaning in like old men whispering gossip. Off to the right was the school and the village hall — both looking like relics that time had begun to erase. To the left was a small knot of buildings that might’ve been shops, but from this distance I couldn’t be sure. And at the very bottom of the valley stood a small, hunched church with windows like sorrowful eyes staring up the hill toward me.

Most of the village was tucked beneath the same fog that had haunted my journey in, but I assumed I’d learn more during my stay. From up here, it almost looked picturesque — like a model village someone had handcrafted with obsessive care. At this hour, though, it was completely barren, which didn’t surprise me.

I glanced at my phone to check the details of where I’d be staying. The ad had been vague: “Due to unexplained long-term sickness, cover is needed indefinitely.” That could mean days, weeks, months — even years. I didn’t care. I had no ties back home, and the money was too good to ignore.

The email regarding accommodation had read simply:

⸻

£150 a month. One room above ‘Bits and Bobs’. Ask for Mrs Ellis.

⸻

I scanned the shops and set off toward them, navigating the snaking roads that stretched longer than expected. Eventually, I pulled up outside a small, weary-looking storefront. A single yellowed light glowed by the entrance, its casing veiled in cobwebs, casting an odd greenish hue onto the door below.

The rain had lessened to a cold, misting drizzle, so I grabbed my suitcase from the back seat and stepped out.

The shop wasn’t much to look at. Vines and ivy crawled up the stone walls like veins, and the bricks looked like they’d been laid by someone halfway through a bottle of something strong. The sign was faded and broken — only the word “Bits” remained, hanging crookedly on the wall. Still, this had to be the place.

Condensation clung to the windows in thick layers, obscuring the jumbled mess inside — a chaotic display of knick-knacks and junk. I couldn’t make out much as I approached the door.

It creaked open, triggering a melodic chime from the bell above. The inside looked like a charity shop had collided with a fishing shed. An overwhelming jumble of tools, trinkets, half-empty tins, canned goods, worn-out coats — and… was that a jar of teeth?

Before I had time to process why a jar of molars was nestled next to a stack of strawberry jam, a voice shattered the quiet. It sounded like two pieces of sandpaper rubbing together:

“Ahh! Mr. Price, is it? Yes, yes — the new teacher! By God, you’re early. Or late. Depending on who you ask.”

Mrs. Ellis hunched behind the till, her crooked fingers clutching the edge like claws. She wore three cardigans, all stained in ways I didn’t care to interpret. Her hair was wild, her smile wide and toothless — well, mostly. Three yellowed teeth stood proudly on display. (So the jar wasn’t hers then. The mystery deepened.)

She was grotesque, honestly. Something out of a children’s cautionary tale. But there was a sort of kindness behind the madness, so I replied politely.

“Mrs. Ellis, right? Thanks again for renting me the room — it really means a lot.”

“Oh, it’s fine, Pricey!”
Great. A bloody nickname.
“The room’s been empty since the last lodger vanished. Weird one, he was — kept making up stories, scaring the locals. Caused a whole load of fuss. sniff But you… you smell like a good’un, boyo.”

“Erm… thanks, Mrs. Ellis. I promise not to be any trouble at all.”

“No bother! Let me get your key.”

She started rummaging through her cardigans, muttering and groaning to herself.

“Ah-ha! There’s the bugger!”

She handed me the key, which was… sticky. The top was caked in some orange crust, and something wet poked out of the keyring hole. Might’ve been a raisin. I didn’t ask.

“Up the stairs, third door on the left — the one with the cat picture on it,” she said.
“But not the second door. That one’s got red chalk on it. We keep the ritual items in there.”

I laughed nervously. “Ha-ha, Mrs. Ellis. Smells like you’re a comedian.”

Her head tilted, grin never faltering.

“Whatever makes you feel safe, Pricey.”

She shuffled back behind a curtain into what I assumed was the storeroom. Absolute nutcase. Probably best to avoid… that.

I turned toward the staircase and stared up.

It was steep enough to qualify as a mountain climb. I couldn’t even see the top — it disappeared into shadow, almost like the fog had crept inside. A low hum seemed to drift from above, deep and faint, like the distant ringing in your ears after a loud gig. I chalked it up to exhaustion and made the ascent, each step groaning beneath me as if the wood itself was offended I’d dared to tread on it.

At the top, the humming had vanished and the fog cleared. I found myself face to face with the second door — the one she’d warned me about. It was marked in smudged red chalk, scribbles with no obvious pattern except for one striking image in the centre: a beautifully drawn white dragon. The artistry was shockingly good. That old bat could draw.

I didn’t linger. Too tired.

I turned to my door — third on the left. A faded poster of a kitten stared back at me with big, sun-damaged eyes. It looked tragic, like it had been clinging to the same patch of wood for decades, watching tenants struggle with that sticky key. I fumbled with it, muttering to myself.

“Come on, Gethin. Focus.”

The key resisted, as if reluctant to do its job. The kitten’s stare seemed to grow more pitiful with every failed attempt. Just as I was about to give up, the door swung open with unexpected force — like someone had yanked it from the inside.

I stumbled forward and landed on a damp green carpet with a heavy splat. Pushing myself up, the smell hit me: boiled cabbage and mould. The sort of scent that seeps into your clothes and won’t leave.

The ceiling was low. A single light bulb dangled in the middle, flickering occasionally as though deciding whether or not it still had the will to shine. The wallpaper was a sickly yellow with a faded floral pattern that, from most angles, looked like bruises.

In one corner, an old radiator hissed and clicked, positioned next to an armchair that radiated pure discomfort. I sat on the bed — or tried to. The springs groaned and cracked beneath me like they were ready to give up too.

Only one window offered a view of the fog outside. I reached to lower the blind and, in doing so, yanked the whole thing off the rail. It slumped to the floor beside me with the energy of a dying swan.

I tossed my bag in the wardrobe and walked over to the desk. On it sat a small kettle, a mug that hadn’t seen a sponge in years, a pile of old books, and — oddly — a stale packet of custard creams.

The book on top caught my eye:

⸻

Myths and Legends of Wales — For Children

⸻

Curious, I flipped it open.

The first hundred pages were blank.

Nothing.

Then, about three-quarters through, a splash of red ink jumped out. I flipped back to it.

Handwritten across the page:

It sleeps below the ancient mine, it’s been there since the break of time.
But once a year it needs to feast — teeth to wake the wicked beast.

I stared at it, dumbfounded. What the hell was that? A joke? A prank by the previous tenant?

Too tired to think it through, I launched the book onto the armchair and decided to forget about it.

It was 11:04 p.m. I sat on the bed, a cup of terrible tea in one hand and a different (non-threatening) book in the other. The rain still hadn’t let up. In fact, it had intensified, hammering the window in uneven rhythms that somehow felt almost… musical. Soothing, in a weird way.

Then, a howl.

Not a dog. Not even close. Low and drawn-out, filled with something that felt like sorrow. It vibrated through the room — not just sound but feeling. I froze, hoping it was just the wind.

I crept to the window and peered out. The fog thickened again, a living thing now, swirling in patterns across the village. The bell at the chapel began to toll — once, twice, three times, four… five. Each chime echoed through the narrow streets, warping slightly, like the sound itself was being twisted.

I could just about make out the chapel tower in the distance, but something was off. It looked… wrong. The spire seemed to lean unnaturally, like a dog pulling on its leash toward something unseen in the valley below.

Then the rain surged harder, blurring the view, and the chapel vanished into the fog once more.

“Creepy bloody village,” I muttered as I sat back on the bed.

Out the corner of my eye, I spotted the book again — Myths and Legends for Children — sitting open in the armchair, despite the fact I’d thrown it closed.

One sentence had been added in the same red ink:

⸻

He’s hungry.
