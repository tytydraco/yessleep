Dark, cold air nipped at my cheeks and ears as I biked the seven-mile trek home to my aunt’s ¹house after work. I was tired and my legs ached, my muscles felt as though they were being branded with hot irons. My manager had dared me to try some of the tequila-pickled peculiarities we had recently gotten in for a few extra bucks before I left for the day. The extra 20 dollars in my pocket didn’t feel worth it in the slightest. My stomach roiled from the brine as it sat like gasoline in my gut. The nausea sent chills up and down my spine like icy waves.

I couldn’t make it up the driveway before spewing two days worth of half-digested cheap take-out all over Aunt Joyce’s garden and falling head-first into her patch of perennials. She treated those stringy flowers better than her own children. I remembered laying there in the dirt, watching the stems of the flowers bend and sway in the dark. Admittedly feeling a little jealous. The flowers didn’t have to worry about rent or working. Or even having to find food. They didn’t know pain or grief. All they needed was water and sunshine.

Had I not been totally plastered, I’d have felt pretty bad; I helped tend the garden myself when there was nothing else to do. Needless to say, I got my ass handed to me the next morning when she found the garden half-flattened and smelling like a carton of expired milk.

That was the first thing I thought about as I swayed back and forth slowly like a perennial in the night. The only difference between then and now being that I was swaying what could have been miles off the floor of an indoor forest like a shitty Halloween prop by my ankle.

Vertigo had taken up residence in my head from the blood rushing to my brain, face, and fingers.

I could hear Ana and Fred bickering above me, spitting creative insults at each other. I couldn’t help but feel like a tool for leaving him like I did; I wouldn’t have made it this far to answer that stupid phone without…

The phone… The sharp reminder that I had maybe one more shot at answering the phone was enough to turn my stomach.

I wiggled and spun, trying to loosen the grip of the vine wrapped around my foot. After not even fifteen seconds of writhing and doing my damndest to get free, I was as winded as a seasoned smoker. I’d like to think I’m pretty fit being in my early 20s, but if this is supposed to be me in my prime, I'll be bedridden by 40.

The twisting I had done sent a stinging reminder of the patch of stripped skin on my tailbone. Pain surged up my spine, enough to leave me limp again.

The sting came with a rush of strange sounds and sensations that are hard to describe. It was as though the crescendo of sounds and the electric sensation through my nerves were one and the same. All I could do was hope that like a suspicious rash, it would go away on its own.

A cold and tingly sensation started up in my toes and crept down my leg, almost like an advanced case of toilet leg. I looked up…or down? I looked wherever the ground was supposed to be and saw a foggy abyss. I used to entertain daydreams of living my own Eldritch adventures, but now that I was staring into it, I think I preferred the slice of life monotony more.

A brush against the back of my arm causing me to yelp. The sudden shout caused both myself and whatever it was that touched me to flinch. It took a few awkward rotations, but I faced the wall of foliage and was met with a small, fluorescent purple Gerbera daisy-looking thing with a bulbous, blue eyeball. It blinked at me from the green curtain it was anchored into, I stared at iy pensively and couldn't help but begin to feel a little frustrated at this Wonderland bullshit. The 20 bucks an hour feeling now like chump change, and man was I the chump. I pinched myself, and found that I was definitely still awake, with the added bonus of it hurting like a bitch.

Then, of course, I let my intrusive thoughts win. I poked it… right in its  huge eyeball which it, understandably, didn't like. The daisy shrieked like a pissed-off baby summoning a tiny death squad, maybe twelve strong of those things, from the brush. The flowers began to hiss and snap at me with tiny mouths filled with lots of sharp little needle teeth.

“Ow!!” One of them managed to nip right through the vine holding me suspended in the air. That's one way to do it. The vine cracked and creaked like old rope. “This is gonna hurt–” When the vine finally gave, I made an attempt at grabbing for the wall. I missed every goddamn time and was left to plummet downward, but not before taking a handful of the little bastards with me.

They squeaked and squealed, and for a second I thought they might be enough to hold my weight.

“Yes!” Then followed the snap, snap-snap of their roots ripping and coming free. Their little screeches pierced my damaged ears, but I only let go when I could hear and feel the same snaps, crackles, and pops in my legs. Then gravity did what it does best.

The fall wasn’t as far as it looked, but it wasn’t short either. Upon impact,  I felt the knuckles of my left hand touching the outer side of my arm. Either the bones in my hand had been turned into small bags of croutons or it was almost definitely broken.

Prodding with my other hand revealed that yep, it definitely was broken. I think I might have still been partially numb from the pitcher plant slurpy because I sure couldn’t feel it yet.

There’s something really upsetting about seeing your hand wobble like an al dente pasta noodle. I did my best to splint it with a stick that hissed at me when I pulled it off a nearby tree. My fingers began turning purplish, and I opted it would be best to just wrap up the whole thing and just not look at it. I held my wrist close to my chest and hoped that whatever benefits I got from this job would cover my steadily growing medical bills.

Looking up from where I had taken the plunge, I could barely see the pitchers from here. Wherever I had fallen, it was darker than the rest of Garden. The foliage was denser and looked downright hostile. If it wasn’t covered in big spiny leaves, it had spikes or bright colors announcing that it was almost definitely poisonous. If I really focused, I could hear layers of voices, as if I was standing in the middle of a city with crowds that only spoke in hushed whispers.

That was probably just the concussion talking, though. Or the onset of stress-induced psychosis.

At that point, even if I did find the phone, I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to escape. Typically, when my shift was over, I’d be blipped out of my department and end up somewhere in proximity to where I was when I had been clocked in. But I wasn’t in my department this time. The thought of being stuck here and becoming a zombie pod person like Ana scared me. But looking back, it didn’t scare me nearly as much as it should have.

I mean, considering the other ways there are to die in here… maybe becoming a plant puppet wouldn’t be so bad?

Like Ana’s words, that idea came easy. It didn’t race and bounce around in my head like the million and one other worries I had. It was like sap that was slowly leeching into the crevices of my mind and hardening like amber. The thoughts felt safe but I also knew they were out of place. But does that make it wrong? Maybe the flower drugs haven’t worn off yet.

I was tempted to just lay back down on the forest floor and let whatever was going to happen go ahead and happen, when a shrill sound pierced the canopy. It wasn’t the sound I was expecting. It wasn’t the page. It was a scream followed by a barrage of Fred-branded swears.

“You spider-mite havin’, photosynthesizin’, finger-lickin’, hottopic shoppin’ trashwagon! You’ll be hearing from my lawyer!”

Followed by Fred… or half of Fred falling through the trees and vines, landing with a hollow THUNK.

“Fred! Holy shit! Are you okay?!” In the short time I’d known him, I had never been so happy to see that plastic idiot. But he didn’t respond, which was a first. There was a prolonged silence between me and his upper body.

“Fred? You alright over there?” Still nothing.

“…Fred?” I made my way over to him slowly, keeping my eyes on the canopy above us in case  Ana decided to show up again. As I approached Fred, I could see his sweater had almost been shredded to pieces. There were deep scratches in his plastic, so deep it showed the white plaster underneath. But what caused my heart to sink was seeing that his head was now completely missing.

“Oh…oh no…”

With that heavy realization came the last sliver of hope I had of getting out of here. So I laid down on the moss bed beside my dead friend who was dubiously alive to begin with and closed my eyes.

I waited for the laws of retail-distributed natural selection to come and take me.

And waited.

And waited some more…

I had waited for about five minutes before getting bored and sitting back up.

“Hey! What’s a guy gotta do to get some service around he—“

My moment of quiet acceptance of mortality was broken by another shrill scream from the canopy, followed by something round being fastballed downward and making hard contact with my face. I won’t bore anyone with the details of how much that sucked, but I made a mental note to add that to my list of comedic inconveniences that have happened to me working here thus far.

“Holy franks on a flatbread! That was a ride! Maxy, did’ya see that?!”

I had been hit in the face with Fred’s head. The treetops and vines above me spun and swayed for like the second or third time. The real gusher of a nose bleed I had caused me to spit and sputter.

“You jackass!! I thought you were dead or… or some mannequin equivalent! You freaking crazy hunk of plastic!”

Fred’s head rolled itself to face me. It was in similar condition to his torso; the paint of his titanium white teeth had almost been scraped off completely. But the sly grin plastered across his face didn’t falter despite its damage. He gave a sharp gasp and giggled like a deranged schoolgirl. “Maxy! You think I’m a hunk?” I picked him up and fought the urge to shake the shit out of him. Or maybe, if I was feeling extra spicy, punt him hard enough to disband the entire NFL. It wasn’t until he spoke that I was reminded I was now hard of hearing. Or at least I was supposed to be. Fred’s voice was clear as a bell. It would have been hard to read the lips of a guy whose lips don’t move.

“I should get paid just for dealing with you.” I stuck him under my arm and hobbled with the fervor of an old man over to his torso that had somehow moved while I wasn’t watching.

“It’s funny that’cha say that. There used to be a guy with that job.”

“Oh yeah? And what happened to him?” I said with a grumble and gently sat his head down next to his neck socket. Looking closer I could see little black fibers in his… neck hole? The fibers slowly angled themselves like therafluid towards his head. Cool? But also, ew?

Fred fell quiet a moment, his eyes pointed toward his other half then back to me. He then lowered his voice a few octaves to a tone I have yet to hear him use since. “We ate him.” He said.

“You… you what?” At first I wasn’t sure I actually had caught what he said right, but the way his eyes began boring into my own, he knew he didn’t have to repeat himself.

Fred stared just long enough to make me reconsider if I should be afraid or not. The tension finally broke when he started practically howling with laughter.

I quickly pressed his face into the moss bed to shut him up. “Shhh! Jesus Christ!”

He continued to laugh in a muffled frenzy for a moment longer before shaking himself free from my hand “Sorry, sorry! You should have seen your face! I’m just yankin’ your chain; we didn't eat him.”

A poorly hidden sigh of relief escaped me “Was he fired or something?” I asked as I tried and failed to stick him back together.

“Nah, you don’t get fired at ThetaMart. He was disassembled and repurposed. Just cause you don't thrive in one position doesn't mean you can't in another.”

“That’s… an oddly positive way of looking at it.” To hear that getting fired wasn't a means of  escaping this place hit me harder than I let show. There might not be a way out of my contract other than surviving it. The only other option is, well…

Is not to.

“This is probably gonna sound stupid but. I took a moment to really consider if I wanted the answer to this question. But the idea of not seeing it coming was just as horrifying. I sat Fred up and began trying to push his neck joint back in place with all the strength I could manage one handed. “Is uh…is that what’s going to happen to me?”

“Nah, believe it or not yer’ actually doin’ okay. Not great, but okay. You should probably answer that page, though.”

“Yeah…I'm working on it.” I wanted to feel at least a little comforted by Fred’s words. Sure my light could be snuffed out at any second, but at least I was ok at my job. Unfortunately the looming dread of my abysmal circumstances being realized in waves weighed about as heavy as the fog around us.

I finally managed to get Fred back into one-ish piece, but not before discovering mannequins are ticklish. Using my apron straps, I made a make-shift Björn and strapped him to my back.

“I bet I could make a career change to become a CPR dummy, if I could get past not having any limbs. I’ve definitely got the looks for it.”

“You can try, but you can bet your right arm I wouldn’t give you the kiss of life, dude.”

I managed to find my box cutter and the pruning shears Janis had given me. My phone unfortunately looked like it would be in tomorrow’s obituaries. The screen glitched in its death throes as it closed and open apps on its own.

“Well, that sucks….”

I could feel Fred peeking over my shoulder. “Worst case you can come live in Sporting Goods with me!” I looked around to see if I could try to spot any of the other walls to follow back to the entrance.

“Thanks, but if I’ve got a choice, I think I’ll pass on that. You’ve probably got a giant, flesh-eating tennis ball running the place over there.”

“Oh boy, do I wish.”

Everything looked the same, as if the foliage purposefully covered anything that could be a landmark. “How the hell am I gonna get out of here…”

“Have you tried stopping and asking for directions?” He asked, for a guy with not a joint to spare he sure was wiggling around a lot.

I honestly couldn't tell if he was joking or not. “I wish it were as simple as asking a plant for directions.”

“You got hooked up to the mycorrhizal network, I’m sure you can hear them now.”

The throb in my wrist was quickly climbing from an annoying pinch to a debilitating throb. I quickly began to wish I could go back and get some of the plant-grade Tiger Balm I had been swimming in. “The microwave network? What are you talking about?”

“The mycorrhizal network. Y’know, the plexus of threads that allows flora and fungi to share nutrients and recourses over a series of distances. Kinda serves as nerves and neurons that connect large systems of the plant life here to communicate information seamlessly cause its cheaper than getting walkie-talkies.”

I struggled to unpack whatever the hell it was he just said. “What?”

Fred sighed impatiently. “Butt tube!”

“Oh, you mean the stupid vine!? That thing took the first two layers of skin off my tailbone? Which still really hurts, by the way!” We walked into what I assumed was probably the garden tools area.

“That checks. It was trying to integrate with you my guy.”

I grabbed a gardening hoe and used it as a walking stick as we continued to venture what felt aimlessly through the self contained jungle.

“Well I don’t speak plant, and I’m not turning green or growing any leaves…last I checked anyway.”

We came to what could be called a clearing. In the middle sat a beast of a tree, with winding branches and large clusters of verdant vines that rooted deep in the floor and breached the surface again in arcs like the body of a coiled serpent. But from what I could see, it had no canopy.

Maybe this is where all vines lead to…

Cautiously we approached it. I gave it a gentle kick, braised myself for it to hiss or scream. When it didn’t I sat Fred down and leaned against it. His head swiveled in a similar fashion to mine, save for the Exorcist move he pulled. We were both expecting something to spring out of the shadows the moment we relaxed enough.

“I think we’ve made it to the center. I’ve never been this deep in Garden before. I can’t help but think Ana did that on purpose.”

“That sucks,” I said, finally relenting to the ache in my knees and slumping down by his side.

“Yeah, Ana sucks.”

“I thought she was pretty nice at first. What happened to her? Why does she… you know–”

“Look like the Corpse Bride? Well, for starters, she’s been a supervisor since before even I arrived.”

“So…is she actually dead?”

“Unless you get creamed by a Manager, you ain't dead. Just suspended in animation carrying out the will of the store. Like Ralph.”

“What about you? You’ve never tried to hurt me. I wouldn't still be here if it weren't for you.”

Fred’s smile seemed to broaden a bit. “Guess you could say I got my own agendas. Plus you’re pretty solid company, Maxy.”

“Thanks. Fred?”

“Yes, my good buddy?”

“I uh…I’m sorry for leaving you behind.”

Fred was quiet for a moment but I could still feel him staring.

“It’s okay…I was more worried about what Ana would do to you if she found you than anything she could’ve done to me. I can be put back together. You can’t.” My mortality was something that had hung over me like an anvil ready to crush me at any second since I started this job. I didn’t expect Fred to really understand what that was like, but he spoke with the weight of worry in his voice. It caught me by surprise. I’m not sure why, but it scared me. It made the fact I could actually die here so much more tangible. That questions every one of us more morbidly minded individuals have entertained began to fire off one after another in my mind, each more vividly than the last. The image of me they would use on my missing poster? Who would bother coming to my funeral? How long would it take for the police to convince my sister that I wasn’t coming home and it was probably my own life choices that landed my photo in an empty coffin to begin with?

My thoughts reeled like a steam engine, but all I could say was “Yeah…I guess you’re right”.

I leaned my head against the pillar of vines and I could have sworn I heard deep, steady breaths, as if something was snoring. The rhythmic sound caused my eyelids to become heavy, like they were pulling themselves closed by no will of my own.

I haven’t been this tired since exam week of senior year. It wouldn’t hurt to just rest my eyes for a minute, right?

It might have been a few seconds. It could have been an hour.

I woke to Fred lying in my lap, desperately thrashing and throwing his head into my stomach.

“Max! Max! Wake up!”

My eyes snapped open again. I was expecting there to be some Demogorgon things looking to make a not-so-vegan meal out of us, or Ana ready to string me up like a meat marionette. Compared to what happens next, I’d have preferred either. Cause you can’t run from sound.

A strange sensation filled the air. I lifted my arm and saw that my skin was breaking out in goosebumps. The atmosphere shift made the hairs on the back of my neck and arms stand at attention.

“Fred, of all the things to worry about, lightning can’t strike us indoors right?”

“It’s not lightning pal. This is gonna be thunder.”

“I’m assuming you’re not talking about the song, right?”

“Max, stick your head in my torso!”

“…what?”

“My endoplasmic lining is sound-proof!”

“Your what?!”

“Has your hearing actually gone or are you confused? I don’t get where I’m losing you here.“

The charged sensation grew with the passing seconds, something in the prehistoric, self-preservational part of my brain told me that if I didn’t do as Fred instructed, I was gonna become premium compost.

I took his torso and held it above me, held my breath and quickly shoved my head inside.

The hole of Fred’s torso was wide enough to swallow me down to my shoulders. It was unexpectedly cold, unnaturally dark, and unpleasantly moist. It felt like I had stuck my head inside of a defrosted turkey.

“It smells like old bologna sandwiches in here…”

Fred said nothing, I wondered if he could even hear me.

There was a moment of stillness, before the auditory assault let loose outside. I couldn’t hear the page this time, but I sure as hell could feel it. The sound was so loud, I could feel the words followed by the dial tone. The syllables blared at such a high volume it caused my skin to sting, like standing in the middle of a dust storm. It took intense effort to even breathe. The base felt like it had a death grip on my chest. I tightened my hold on Fred as my knees gave. The soles of my shoes kicked up dirt and grass as I thrashed. I had no control over my body. The damaging decibels had me struggling like a rabbit in a snare. It felt like every inch of me outside of the torso was almost disintegrating. I almost accepted that my organs and every inch of exposed skin would be boiled from my bones by sound alone.

The sound finally started to creep in as the plastic pressed against my fingertips began to give. Fred was melting; I could feel it under my fingernails. A slightly oily, sticky goo began collecting at the base of my neck. I could hear Fred screaming from outside of the shell. Turns out that mannequins could feel pain after all…

After the page had finally stopped, I laid still for longer than I needed to. I was afraid of what I would see.

When I finally pulled my head out of Fred’s torso, it was as bad as I had imagined. He looked like a half-melted, man-shaped candle. The whole left side of his face now sat on his cheek, his smile was lopsided…and it was all my fault.

“Y’know Maxy, being your deus ex machina isn’t as fun as I thought it would be…”

“Why did you do that!? Why didn’t you use some mannequin magic to save yourself or something?!”

Fred giggled but I could hardly see what was so funny. “Boy, I sure wish I had Mannequin Magic. Maybe then I could grow back an arm to scratch this nose itch I’ve had for the last hour.”

In retrospect, I wish I had thanked him. To have said something, other than call him an idiot. Felt something other than a quiet resentment for what he did. Because what came next was a beast far larger than the elephant that stood between Fred and I.

From the silence left in the wake of The Page, came the sound of cracking. Thigh-thick vines snapping, creaking and popping like ancient ruins giving way to time and collapsing in on themselves. The sounds echoed like explosions, bouncing against the other three walls of the department that we still had yet to find.

There was a voice, like the cyclopsian daisy but deeper, angrier. I was certain of it now, it was coming from inside my head and it was accompanied by what I could only describe as a surge of electricity shooting up my spine from where the pitcher plant had been attached.

It didn’t speak, but I could hear it. Whispering curses and its full intention to rip me to pieces. A shape from the fog took form. It moved like a predatory cat, on all fours and almost as tall as the shelves around us. Atop of the massive body was an enormous, strikingly beautiful flower. I had never seen colors so vibrant and I couldn’t help but be frozen in awe. That was, of course, until I saw its jaws. The creature was endowed with jaws large enough to clamp down on a car and looked strong enough to make quick work of it. The body was made of clusters of vines thicker than a fire hose, together as thick as a tree trunk. Pinned to its chest was a name tag that read in bold, black font Garden Manager Maully, how may I help you?

I could only stare; the batteries to my metaphorical alarm bells had long since died. “So…this store has carnivorous flower dragons and speakers loud enough to kill someone, but not a phone for each department?” Fred made a sound like a clothes tag being snipped from a sweater which I assumed was the mannequin’s version of a tsk.

“You think we have the budget for that?”

“If I survive this contract, I’m suing…”

I could feel the monster eyeing me, probably wondering how hard it would have to bite down to get to my tootsie-roll center. I slowly grabbed Fred and my walking hoe, then got to my feet trying not to make any sudden movements.

The creature leaned in, barring its rows and rows of barbed and serrated teeth. “That only works in movies…” Its low, growling voice bubbled from the recesses of my mind and sent shivers up my back.

I didn’t even have to vocalize my thought. The moment I thought it Maully already knew what I was going to say. “Can we have a 10-second head start?”

Maully made an expression somewhere between a grin and a snarl. Its breath smelled like mildew and pondscum.

“Run, fruit fly…”

They didn’t have to tell me twice. I took off in a sprint down the nearest aisle with the hoe and gardening tool in hand. The foliage moved and writhed like snakes, making it increasingly harder to figure out where we were going and where we had been. With every stride, Fred would slip a little in my grip. The oily, semi-melted plastic layer on him made it almost impossible to keep ahold of. But I owed him now. I wasn’t gonna leave him behind again.

“Stop slipping!” I snapped, “What do we do?!”

“I know I make jokes about being a knight, but I never said I was a dragon-slayer!”

I could hear the vines of the creature rip and snap like a tree falling in a storm as it pursued us. With every pop and crack I could feel in my nerves, muscles, and tendons, It was getting a little hard to deny the fact that I might be hooked into whatever plant WiFi this place was running on. If I was a smarter man, I could have used it to my advantage somehow. But hindsight is 20/20.

Maully followed quickly and with a singular purpose, hot on our heels and making a mess of things as they plowed through every solid object that got in their way. It was as like they knew every move I was going to make even before I did.

“You can’t run forever Floater!” It’s voice inside my head hissed like toxic gas let loose from a valve. The chill caused my shoulders to seize up toward my neck.

I wanted to say something equally imposing back to hide the fact I might actually piss my pants, but all I could muster was, “I’m submitting a complaint with HR!”

“You hear that Maully!? If you don’t have anything nice to say, keep your psychic channels shut!!” Fred yelled over my shoulder as his sticky plastic film caused him to sink lower and lower in my arms as we ran.

“If you could grow a third arm to not drop me, now would be the time to do it.”

“Half our problems could have been solved a third appendage ago! Stop slipping!”

Fred looked at me, still slipping. I couldn’t take the now searing pain in my wrist any longer. I had no choice but to let him slip from my arms. “Sorry Fred-“ I took the hoe and used it like a dangerous putter to push him forward as I ran. If this wasn’t one of the scariest moments of my life, it would have been a fun play on reversed mini-golf.

“MA-“ Thunk! “I’m gonna get Shaken Mannequin Syndrome!”

There was a sheer drop in the floor, like the store had completely forgotten to load itself in and we were speeding right towards it. I backpedaled, trying and failing to stop in time. My Chucks made a sound like a record scratch as Fred and I sailed over the edge with Maully quickly in tow. We fell, being flipped and snagged and thrown all the way down before becoming suspended in a web of vines. Some had sharp thorns that pricked and scratched my skin if I tried to move. Some were connected to flowers loaded with spines as thick as pencils in the center. They slowly positioned their blossoms at me, seeming eager to turn me into a human toothpick sculpture.

Maully roared as they crashed through the canopy overhead. Their heavy body caused the lattice of vines to snap and shake until the beast was just as tangled as Fred and I. They hung contorted in the air angled downward. Those car-crushing jaws I mentioned earlier were more or less a few feet and a few seconds of bad luck away from my face. I held my breath as I peered into the gaping, green chasm at the center of its blossom. Green strands of weed-dragon drool dripped on me in thick, warm sheets and stained my apron. Fred stared at me wide-eyed and just as silent. Just as frightened.

I held my breath till I saw stars, but with how loud my heart was pounding, the sound of my breath probably made little difference. Maully knew I was there. They just wanted to see how long I’d last before I’d lose my composure.

Up close and still, their colors were hypnotic like Ana’s eyes. Their petals were textured like the eyes of a mantis, but with the vibrant colors of a white and speckled violet orchid. The longer I stared, the more I realized their spots shifted and pulsed in tandem with my breath and heartbeat…

Maully huffed and hissed waiting for me to make a mistake, to shift just close enough for them to snatch me up.

This game they played becoming increasingly harder as an itching and burning sensation began to bloom from every inch of of my body that made contact with Maully slobber, the desire to begin wiggling and shifting with discomfort was nearly unbearable. Between that and the thorns…I’d have paid every cent I had to crawl out of my skin.

“Little fruit fly. Stuck in web. The thorns hurt, don’t they…” When they spoke, it wasn’t like hearing a foreign voice in my head. It was like hearing my own thoughts. My own voice, but I knew I didn’t think them. Sinister messages rising to the top of my mind like bubbles forcing themselves to the surface. And they were loud… so loud. The longer time went on the more impatient and intrusive Maully became. “I can set you free, you know. I can mend your wounds. The thorns won’t hurt you if you become a part of them.” Maully pushed against a cluster of vines cause the part that held me suspended to tighten. The thorns slowly pressing further and further into my neck, chest and arms, dragging along my skin like snakes. It was becoming harder and harder to breathe.

“Little shrub left outside to wither and die…no one to tend to you. Help you grow. You became a weed, waiting to be ripped from the root…” There was something poking around in my head. Tendrils slinking around in the cracks and creases of my mind to anchor themselves. I squeezed my eyes shut and shook my head trying to get them out. “Fuck you! Just eat me if you’re gonna!!”

“...Wasteful.”

A sharp pang of pain erupted in my side. My eyes only flicking from Maully just long enough to see the cause. I immediately regretted it the moment my brain untangled what I was seeing. It took everything in me…not to start screaming.

One of those fucking vines had embedded itself in my skin with the precision of a hypodermic needle, and it was spreading. Another pinch, then another. I could feel roots beginning to crawl under my skin; feeling like worms burying themselves in quenched soil. Wriggling around like worms. The vines began cocooning themselves around me. My body growing more slack by the second, throat clenched, parched and sore. My mouth began to move on its own. I sounded like I had been gargling gravel ”ripped out at the root…” I echoed. Flashes of moonlit perennials began to play across my mind. They sway in the breeze…no pain. Just water and sunshine.

Just sunshine…

The closer Maully got, the more they salivated. It was like having my head under a smelly, hot slime tap now. My eyes began to roll back. Weighted 8-balls in my head feeling impossible to control. With the strength I had left I twitched trying to fight the sensation of the coils snaking around in my insides. Poking past my stomach, brushing against my lungs.

The connection to the plexus now, feeling raw and real. More real than myself or any of my memories. For a moment I questioned if I was ever separate from it to begin with. The sensation of their insatiable desire to integrate everything I was rippled across my nerves. To learn all that I knew, to show me the power of nature and how small I was. I was just a simple cell, a tiny spark in the grand microcosm of the organism that lived within these walls. My life was so small. insignificant in the grand scheme of the plexus… of Maully. Just a little fruit fly.
