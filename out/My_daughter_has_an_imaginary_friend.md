I always thought being a single father would be the hardest part of raising Samantha. After her mother passed away two years ago, I did my best to create a stable, happy home for her. Without trying to come across as a snob, or self-absorbed, money never has been an issue in our lives, and say what you want but that helped a great amount in making Sam feel as happy as she could, given she does not even remember her mother. Her name was Lily, and we'd been together for quite some time before deciding we want a child, our little blessing. I don't want to go into details about her passing, frankly even though Sam and I talk openly about her, which I decided was the best way to make sure she doesn't get upset anytime she is mentioned, I still haven't moved on completely. I doubt I will soon.   
  
Anyway, I'm getting sidetracked, I'm sorry. The reason I spoke up about money, is that thanks to our hard work as a family we were able to afford a decently sized house with a large yard that houses Samantha's safe space - her treehouse. She's loved it since the day it was built and it's where she would spend hours playing, drawing, and watching her favorite show on a laptop I'd left up there, Looney Tunes. I must say I never discovered its appeal, some jokes were too weird to put in a children's cartoon and I never was a big fan of cartoons in the first place. But, as long as it keeps Sam happy, I'd tell myself, and here I'd be watching episode after episode with her.

Every so often, when my work and the weather would permit it, Samantha and I would have a slumber party in the treehouse, of course watching Looney Tunes, playing pretend and whatever else she'd want us to do. I never said no to anything, and she'd damn near burst from happiness every time I told her we can climb up there for the night. Unfortunately there was a period of two or three months where I'd have to take extra shifts and most of the time be gone for a big part of the day, having to leave Samantha at her grandparents' place, half an hour drive away, or that they'd have to come watch her. That meant no slumber parties.

Now you might ask why her grandparents never gave her that simple fun? Well, I wish I could answer you. My parents both passed away a while back, and I never got along with Lily's parents, even less after her death, my guess would be because they were now anchored to me for the rest of their lives thanks to Sam, and when I wasn't there to take the verbal abuse, my daughter would be the one having to listen to them babble on about stuff no four year old would, excuse my language, give a shit about. Our biggest arguments were about how they would let Sam sleep in the treehouse on these warm nights on her own. I'd always yell at them how she could get hurt climbing up or down, even more so if she was to go to the house in the middle of the night.

Thankfully, once that period of double shifts and additional work hours was over, Sam was back in my care again, and I could tell she was happier that way. But I was in for a surprise just a few days after.

  
"His name's Looney," Sam told me while I was tucking her into bed one evening, "Like Bugs Bunny!"

"Oh?" I replied, eyebrows rising. My daughter never had an imaginary friend before, in fact she found the idea pretty silly in her own words when I explained what that was to her after she learned about it from other kids. "That's a funny name, is he a bunny too?"

"No, he's just Looney. He's funny and always smiling! He makes me smile too. Like this!" She threw her arms up and put on a very exaggerated smile, which looked way too forced and as if it would hurt if she kept it on for more than two seconds. "He lives in the treehouse and plays with me."

  
I kissed her on the forehead and turned the lights off, telling her good night. Her imagination's going to go crazy soon, I told myself, then smiled to myself a little, realizing that this was one more thing to keep her mind occupied and away from thinking about her mother.

Over the next few weeks Looney would become a regular topic of conversation. Sam would tell me about the games they play up in the treehouse, which, unsurprisingly, were mostly games a child could play on their own or they would simulate another kid playing with them. Looney would tell her jokes that always made Sam laugh, but when she'd tell them to me I'd always just fake laugh, failing to find the punchline - they were always random questions and a nonsensical answer.

  
Some weeks later when I was preparing to run to the shop around five minutes from us, I went to tell Sam. She's smart enough to be left alone for such a short time at this age, so there never was a problem. She was  outside in the yard playing close to her treehouse, looking up and laughing, throwing a ball up which would roll back down every time. She must have been throwing it pretty hard and accurately at the wall considering there's no incline inside.

"Sam, honey, I'm going to the store. Don't touch any dangerous things, right? You remember?"

She looked at me after she threw the ball up into the treehouse, but it didn't roll down this time. 

"Okay daddy!" She replied and went back to looking up at the treehouse.  
"We can play after that if you want! I'm sorry, I was busy with work."  
"It's okay! Me and Looney are playing."  
"Oh, is that so? Maybe I can play with you two when I come back so you can finally introduce me?"

Sam looked up at the treehouse again and after a few seconds of silence and just looking she turned to face me again with her face looking down and arms crossed.

"Looney says you're too big to play daddy..."

I was slightly hurt but said that's fine and left for the store. Samantha was quiet the rest of the night.

  
Things began to get stranger after that. Anytime I saw Sam playing on her own- or I guess with Looney, she'd quiet down or stop playing entirely. She'd talk about him less and every time I would ask if she's upset because of Looney she would ignore me. It got to the point where I was getting angry, I couldn't comprehend her being more upset because of some imaginary friend than about her mother.

One night when she was acting particularly strange, while I was tucking her in she talked about Looney herself after a while of not hearing anything about him.

"Looney is angry with me..."  
"Is that why you've been so quiet?"  
"Yes... he wants me to sleep in the treehouse. I said you wouldn't let me."  
"He's not real, Sam." She tried to interrupt me but I cut her off. "You can't let your imagination bring you down like this. It's silly."  
"He IS real daddy!" She shouted at me. I was taken aback. "He lives in the treehouse and he said he will hurt you if you don't let me!"

Samantha was grounded for a few days after that argument. This was no way to speak to her father. She was never a problematic child, and now some stupid invisible buddy was ruining our relationship. I had to get her to stop, and I figured the only way to do that was to put my foot down finally and stop playing pretend with Looney and all that nonsense. During these days though, I have to admit, I was thinking about what my daughter said, that her friend lived in the treehouse. She never acted like this before. She never made things up. I decided that the next morning I would go up the treehouse after so much time of not climbing up there and bring her things down until she started behaving like normal again.

I didn't get to that though.

  
The same night I was woken up by thumping in the corridor coming towards my room and crying. Samantha basically bashed the door in, her face completely red and streaked with tears, her eyes barely open. She lunged at me, landing on my stomach while I was still trying to process everything, almost leaving me without air. Before I could even ask what was wrong she began yelling into my chest, her terrified voice muffled and her little arms gripping onto me so tight that it made breathing difficult.

"Looney broke my window, daddy! He's angry and keeps telling me to play with him!"

My heart sank and my first thought was to hide Sam under the bed, the same place from where I pulled out my baseball bat. Ignoring the fact I was only in my underwear and could barely see anything in front of me, I ran through the corridor, moving through the living room and bursting into Samantha's room, the adrenaline in me forcing me to look first around the room for any intruder, not at all noticing that the window was in fact broken by a lone stone laying in the middle of all the glass. After I checked everywhere someone could hide - behind the door, under the bed and the closet, I yelled out into the darkness and walked slowly towards the window, trying to peer around the edges to see if I could see anything. The moonlight outside was faint but it allowed me to see the completely empty yard.

Then my eyes traced the tree leading up to the treehouse and was frozen in place, realizing that all of it was real, having just locked eyes with Looney. For a few seconds we just stared at each other - I don't know what he, or it, or whatever that was, was thinking at that moment, but I wasn't scared at first. I was confused. Looney's proportions were so wrong. His limbs were unnaturally long and I think I even saw an extra joint somewhere along the arms. His torso was so skinny you could see the ribs. I can't even begin to describe his head, the best thing I can say is that it was just... vertical. The eyes so close together, shining in the darkness, and the mouth so wide that it stretched to the side of its cheeks, locking that thing into a permanent smile. I don't know if there was any hair - on the head, or limbs, or anything. I don't even know if that was a human or some creature. It was standing right at the entrance of the treehouse, having to bend in order to fit under it.

Only after I came to realize what I was looking at did the terror run through my body, chilling every part of it and making me drop the bat. Looney didn't descend the ladder or jump, he crawled down the tree like some animal and then trudged off, lifting its legs effortlessly over the fence and disappearing into the woods beyond the yard. I must have stood there for at least ten more seconds trying to process everything before chaotically running back, the only things I grabbed on the way being my car keys and Samantha.

I don't know how far over the speed limit I was driving but we were at her grandparents' place after what seemed like forever, and we haven't been back since. I haven't even called the police, what do I even tell them without being brushed off as someone with nothing better to do? I've been seeing this thing in my nightmares, and so has Samantha, who's barely been able to sleep herself. Even her grandparents are calling me mad, despite their granddaughter backing up the story and describing the same thing I saw, even if in a more childish manner.

I have no idea what's happening back home. Our closest neighbors are a short drive away and nobody's gonna see the broken window considering it's on the back of our house. For all I know that thing's come back to trash everything looking for my daughter, and I'm afraid it's going to keep looking for her.

What sends chills through my body every time I think about this though, is not the creature itself, but how the whole time Samantha was "playing" with it, saying how it lived in the treehouse. She was not imagining it.
