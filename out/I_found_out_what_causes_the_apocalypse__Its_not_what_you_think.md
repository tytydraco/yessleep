I've been working on the production side of broadcasting in a major city for the last ten years.  I have a similar sob story as most people; Got a film degree, took a job to pay the bills, and got promoted in a position that's too good to leave, but soul crushing enough to make me want to jump off the building.  Like a lot of people, I shudder at the polarization of our country, and, being on the production side of things, I am not in a position to change things.  I schedule and keep the room working for the gluttonous sloths to spread their divisive messages. 

I've stayed in this mind crushing industry out of fear of going back to my original career major of table waiting as it didn't have good benefits.  It's hard to describe the feeling of being pulled out of 'the tip slums' and held in the arms of a company that at least pretends to care if you live or die.  (I'm sure they'd let me bleed out on camera if it meant a mediocre boost in viewership.)  Maybe it's rotten, but the promotions are nice.  It's only within the last five years that the guilt has started to pierce my conscious.  I spend many nights trying to calculate how much money as a coordinator was worth my soul. The numbers weren't good.

It was just another day coordinating the goings on of the news set.  Cameras were rolling, assistants were rushing, people were yelling, and the anchor was spouting crap with a grin you'd expect to see out of a pig that enjoyed the taste of its own vomit.  The segment ended as usual with adulation as if we hadn't heard any of this before.  I ducked away from the barrage of handshakes and fake smiles and took time in the corner to sulk.  I had been feeling extra crappy this month due to our shareholders visiting and my landlord raising my rent.  It was nothing I couldn't handle, but I hadn't gotten a raise in almost five years and have had my rent risen three times.  I took a deep breath and went to finish the hour.  I began to clean as people cleared out and noticed the news anchor just fiddling with his tie.  I tried to make myself seem scares, but he decided to speak with me.

"Wild day, ain't it!?"

I didn't look at him.  "Pretty crazy."

"I tell ya.......People just keep getting crazier."

What an asshole!  "It is......a mystery."

"How much shit do I have to say to get the attention of these morons?!  It's not enough to make them mad.......Ya gotta scare em!"  He shakes his head.

I was annoyed but not surprised.  "You gotta do something to get the sheep's attention."  I stopped loving myself a long time ago.

"Haaa!!  Ain't that the truth!"  He took a hit of a weird looking vape.  "Ya know.....I've been watching you.  you've been here a while, right?"

"Been here ten years.  Started out as a PA and now a coordinator."

He gives me the look of someone trying to by a prized hog.  "Ya thinkin of movin up in this field?  Ya ever think of coming over to the journalism side of things?"

Thinking of what this dried up cigar filter did as journalism made me want to puke.  "I don't know.......I originally wanted to direct movies."

he laughed as if his stomach were about to make soup.  "You and every other stary eyed person under the age of forty!  C'mon!  You've been here a long time and became a coordinator!  You could have found more work, but you're still here!"  He looked at me as if he stumped me.  "What made you stay here instead of working on films?"

The man asks pragmatic and spiritual question.  I'm not sure if the existential part of my brain has the bandwidth.  "I originally got this job after college for experience.  Honestly, I didn't plan on staying here past a year."  I got nostalgic about my first year in this city.  How innocence can quickly be squashed.  "Then things got a little interesting.  Crazy stories, crazy elections, and enough civil unrest to always have party stories.  I got promoted after six months and just got comfortable."  I guess I have to feel like shit in three ways.

He gave me a smirk.  "Comfortable?  I would never describe my time in front of the camera comfortable."  He took a drag out of his creepy vape and laughed.  "If you find this comfortable, maybe the world of alternative media is up your alley."

The thought of this company being up my "alley" made me want to bang my head on the wall in the hopes that he'd lost so much of his humanity that he'd forget to call an ambulance and just let me fade away.  "I don't know."

"You should think about it.  You have the look and attitude to be a good anchor.  you might even be able put some stories together."

I struggled to keep my cool.  "It sounds interesting, but I'm not sure where I'm going."

"Think about it.......We're looking for someone to train, and I like hiring people who know the business."

I thought keeping to myself was a good way to not get promoted.  Are these people that anti-social?  I just wanted to casually take money from this company and pretend I wasn't.  I figured I'd forget eventually.  "I don't know if I'll be here that long."

"We're willing to pay you a good package.........well above six figures."  He turned to face me directly.  "And it will keep growing."

The pay raise is that dramatic after one promotion above me?!  "Sir......."

"The high pay is a sign of trust and commitment to our mission.  Plus! People in production tend to move from place to place, even if they've been with you for a while."  He turned back to the monitors.  "But ten years.........I think you've earned your spaghetti."  He put his vape away and slapped my back.  "Think about it!  You have a week!"  He walked out the exit before I could say goodbye.

I walked slowly down the dark avenue in a state similar to just getting out of an icy river.  The confusion I felt was enough to make me push someone into traffic just to avoid making any meaningful decisions.  I get a decent paycheck now, but for the amount of time and work, I could be making way more.  Production has a way of tricking you; 'Yay!!  I'm making six figures!  After working ninety-hour weeks and giving up my life.'  How much is my soul worth?  Triple the salary for half the work isn't the worst answer.

I walked into my apartment feeling my resolve slowly come undone as I looked at the mess, I hadn't had time to clean.  I figured I just needed to stop being lazy and pick a day to clean.  My work hours made it nearly impossible to clean, let alone have a life.  The life I did have consisted of getting drunk after work and hanging with my ex-girlfriend who got mad that I didn't demand more time off.  Any other time I had was sitting in my room wondering what game I should play until I passed out from exhaustion.  The company's morally bankrupt, but this could be my only ticket out.  I texted my friend Max who was a production accountant for the company.

\[Hey!  Can you chat?\]

\[For a little.  What's up?\]

\[I was offered training to be an anchor......\]

\[That's awesome!!\]

\[Get dat moneyyyyyy!!!\]

\[I don't know man.........

\[I feel like I'm making a deal with Satan's abusive dad or something.\]

\[Dude.....

\[I know these guys suck, but this is a chance to work on the inside!\]

\[Take all the info you can get and do something better when you're ready.\]

\[I don't know.......He said he's paying me a lot more money.  He didn't make it sound like a steppingstone.\]

\[He made it sound like a real commitment.\]

\[So!?\]

\[This happens a lot!\]

\[You don't have to be glued to the company forever.\]

\[Still.....I feel dirty.\]

\[Man!  We're already working for the company.\]

\[We're just the people they deem expendable.\]

\[Besides, if you want change, working from the inside is the best way.\]

\[Even if you can't change anything, you can still leave with secrets.\]

\[I guess.\]

\[I mean......Most of the higher ups donate to left wing charities.\]

\[I don't think you're the only one who has issues with the messaging.\]

\[They're destroying the country, but they don't actually believe themselves.\]

\[Wow.  That makes everything so much better.  lol\]

\[My guy!  Get in there and change things!\]

\[And if you don't like it, just leave.\]

\[At least you'll get more money and an inside scoop on our corruption.\]

I came to work the next morning and found the anchor to tell him I'd like to accept the offer.  He shook my hand and told me he'd send an email.  His demeanor changed instantly to something more serious.  He gave me a look of someone sharing a family secret.  I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the coyness.

The next few nights produced a slew of conflicting emotions.  I was excited but also dreading the call and hoped he lost interest.  Maybe he didn't like the way I said, 'thank you'.

After Tuesday evening passed, I figured he'd just hired someone with more experience.  Maybe he was just doing me a favor, and his bosses were not feeling ready to let a member of the 'great unwashed' into their club.  It felt like a party I didn't want to go to was canceled and I was going to stay home and watch a movie instead.  I was about to go to bar and eat cheap pizza when I got the dreaded email.  "Come to the fourth floor Friday evening when You get off work."  Damnit!

Friday came and went.  After a few minutes of stalling near the crafty table, I made my way to the elevator.  I pressed four and the elevator began to ascend with the speed of a turtle that was about to work for the rabbit.

The doors opened to reveal a room that looked and felt like a marijuana dispensary waiting area from 2005.  The walls were blindingly white, yet you could see cracks from years of cigarette smoke and neglect.  The seats looked like they were just extensions of the wall.  Like tongues slurping you into the void.  This would have been sensory deprivation if not for the clerk behind the tinted window.  She spoke thru a speaker asking for my ID.  Without the excitement of pot, a place like this felt like a prison in the worst type of modern art painting.  The only accessory I saw was a tv in the top corner hanging from the ceiling that looked like it hadn't worked since the mid-nineties.  The room was oddly silent.  The silence was enough to give you auditory hallucinations which, somehow, clerk's presence made worse.

I sat forty minutes in brain splitting silence trying to find any way to keep myself busy, but with no service or reading material, all I could do was think about personal stories from the week.  At some point my interviewer stumbled through a hidden door with a look I could only describe as drunk on gravity.  He gave his knees a fast buckle, causing him to slam onto the chair one foot from me.  He fiddled with his glasses and papers and gave a crusty cough to announce the beginning of this interview.

"Kevin!  The name is George Gross!"  He didn't bother to look at me, let alone shake my hand.  "So......Ya wanna be an ancha!"

"It's been goal to keep people informed since I started working here!"  It's been my goal to find someone with such a thick accent.

"Well......Ya know the business, ya got the voice and the looks, and ya' recommended by Harry.  I have no reason not to hire ya."  His pupils glanced at me like a mouse checking if the coast is clear.  "The question is.....do ya want this?"

"Of course!  This is a great opportunity."  Even if it did make my brain bleed.  "I want to keep the people informed of the cultural forces eroding our nation!"  I'll take my Oscar.

"Kid!  Ya can drop the act!  I know ya don't believe this crap!"  I give back my Oscar.  "We see ya socials.  Ya bluer than a cranky teenaga!"  He sat up and turned his body to focus on me.  "I haven't believed the shit we puke out since the Bush yeas!"   His demeanor changed from deciding where to eat to deciding whether or not he wanted to play Russian roulette.  "Now........Do ya want this?  It's a big responsibility."

His static eyes made me rethink my decision a little.  My buddy was right.  Even if I didn't take this and went back to working production, I'd still be working for the devil.  Better to get more money and influence if I'm losing my dignity.  "I want this!"

George stood up, collected his things, and left back through the hidden door without so much as a nod.  I was beginning to wonder if he had just lost interest in me, when the lights dimmed and the 90's tv in the corner blipped on.  George walked out again.

"In the early part of 1972, Lenny Kingman, our media managah, spent most of his nights working behind that countah,  One night, there was a ring at the desk.  When Lenny came back, he found these tapes."  George pulled a smaller looking VHS out of his bag.  It took me a few seconds to realize I was looking at grungy Betamax.  "These babies wouldn't come out for anotha three yeas.  No way to watch em!  Lenny set em aside.  Betamax was released three yeas latah."

"Mystery tapes, huh?"

George gave me a tepid smile.  "You can say that again!  Lenny ordered a Betamax playa and noticed the tapes fit.  But we were confused about the logo.  Tapea.......No one had heard of this company."

"I mean......could it have been a smaller company?"

"Things weren't like that back then.  Ya think a company would have secret first dibs of a new technology if no one heard of em?!  Sorry!  Don't exist.  Neva existed."  He sat down looking at me from his side.  "Lenny watched the tapes, but they was too degraded to make sense of it.  Lenny put it away until 1979.  He wanted to show some of us.  The tapes..,,,,, a bit different than he remembahd.."

George put the tape in the Betamax player under the tv in the corner.  The tv blipped on and began to show old grainy footage that looked more like stuff you'd see under a microscope.

"What is th..."

George interrupted me.  "Shhh.  Watch!"

\*\*\*\*\*

The 'oceanic' looking footage slowly came more into focus revealing distinct shapes.  Still blurry and out of focus, I could only make out two blobs interacting with each other.  It looked like one of the blobs was handing something to the other blob causing the other blob to shake and fall down.  The blob that was still standing retracted its hand, shook, and fell just like the first.  I got a weird feeling in the pit of my stomach.  It felt like I was peaking at a very serious family argument, and I should leave.  The scene changed to another location and showed a tapestry of moving blobs.  At some point, there appeared to be a whirlwind of the blobs moving around causing the color of the screen to turn crimson.  It was almost hypnotic watching these blobs move in and out of each other like paint being spun around and made into abstract shapes on canvas.  Hands began slowly taking shape around the screen.

\*\*\*\*\*

George paused the video.  "Ya probably thinkin ya watchin some artsy crap, huh?  Like if Jackson Pollock became a deranged film makah?  That's what I thought.  Magnetic tape normally degrades ova time.  This tape has done the opposite."  George pressed play and turned back to look at the screen.

\*\*\*\*\*

What I once thought was hands materializing was the picture coming into focus.  The hands became more pronounced, and Feet began to appear.  Limbs and limbs and then........faces.  The picture got into focus showing the blobs to be people in an auditorium.  They were mangled from what appeared to be an explosion.  The faces had me second guessing my perception.   The smiles on their faces made me want to spit out my lunch.  The video skipped back to the original scene which now looked pristine enough for me to see the blobs.  They were people.  I had witnessed a murder suicide-suicide.  Their faces.  The two looked to be in a state of zen.  The sound began to work revealing a soundtrack with the optimism of exploring space for the first time.  The video skipped to a crowd standing in what looked to be a celebration on the Brooklyn Bridge.  A bomb went off in the middle of the crowd killing hundreds.  What confused me more than the explosion were the faces.  All I could see was pleasant boredom!  What I thought was a delayed reaction was acceptance.  No!  Pride!  Another bomb went off followed by another and another and still no running or screaming to be seen.  The film cut to a gymnasium filled with a crowed who looked ready for church.  This scene fit the theme of the other two.  The people smiled as they got their throats slit by the person next to them, followed by a clip of a firing squad shooting at waiving pedestrians, planes nose-diving into mountains, and a sneak peak of parents throwing their children down cliffs as easy as you'd skip rocks.

\*\*\*\*\*

George paused the tape again and stared at the wall while holding his chin.  "We spoke to higher-ups at SONY.  They found this ridiculous.  Told us there was no way.  They doubted an indie producer would have wasted money shooting an expensive movie for a format that didn't exist.  We showed one of them the tapes, and he said they weren't made by SONY."

I felt heavy.  "Why are you showing me this?"

George puts the tape back in.

\*\*\*\*\*

There was a news segment with both anchors smiling.  "And today we are celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the 'Great Compromise'.  Twenty years ago, we, as a nation, became united as to what we wanted to accomplish in the next couple decades.  We wanted to preserve, to consume less, and to make our environment flourish, as well as spiritual enlightenment with our nation as it relates to the rest of the world.  We wanted to experience death as a nation united to have a real rebirth.  We have developed common goals in this change in the 'historical method.'"

The video skipped to a reporter interviewing a woman who looked at peace.  "Mam!  How are you enjoying your Saturday, and how do you plan on celebrating?!"

She spoke.  "I feel very proud of my country for the level of understanding it has gained in my lifetime!  Sometimes I forget how good we have it these days.  Compared to when I was a kid, we have such assurance with ourselves and the nation.  To answer your other question, today I plan to commit the enlightenment ritual.  Our kids will be asleep because.....well ya know."

The reporter laughed.  "Awww!  Too young to understand?"

"Yeah, but my husband and I will have our own sendoff once the kids are gone."

"Sounds like a meaningful evening!  I wish you luck!"  The reporter walks away from the lady and looks at the camera.  "There you have it!  Another spectacular celebration of united compromise and common goals!  Back to you Richard!"

\*\*\*\*\*

George switches the tv off and turns on the lights.  "There's mo footage!  Takes place a year later and it looks like a bomb went off!".  He looked me in the eye.  "I won't show you that video till you's committed at least a yea in this new role."  George disappeared into the hidden door.  I asked the clerk if that was it, but no sound came from that tinted glass.  She might have left a while ago.  To be safe, I waited fifteen minutes than left.

I got home and spent the next few hours searching the internet for videos like the ones I saw.  I checked all the B-roll sites, stock footage, films with end of the world themes, this site, and as mini ai photos and videos I could find.  Nothing.  What I saw was like looking into and alternate world.  It was specific and tight.  I received an email from an unknown email.
