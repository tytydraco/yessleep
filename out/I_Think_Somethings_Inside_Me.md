I think something’s inside of me. I woke up to a puff of smoke and instinctively clawed at my throat to pull out whatever was snaking its way down to my stomach to no avail. As a desperate act I attempted to make myself gag and throw up whatever creature crawled into me but that once again was met with failure.

 It was only then that I began to scan my surroundings of what I could describe as the cleanest room I have ever laid my eyes on. Counters and chairs spread about, everything in this room was sparkling clean to the point I could even see my reflection on the wall. Every object is covered in a bright white, all shimmering from the blinding light above me. Everything except for the chrome table I found myself waking up on.

Once again a jolt of pain slides down my inflamed throat, as a weird sensation begins to spread over my arms and legs. It feels like something inside of me is grabbing my bones and moving them but yet… they remain still, almost frozen in shock. That’s when I noticed it.

I dont know how long I’ve been hearing it. Was there always that beeping? “Beep…. Beep…. Beep…” almost lulling me to a sleep. The beeps were beginning to be droned out by voices. I sit up in an attempt to hear what these disembodied voices are whispering around the empty room. “Cdoe…. Cdoe… Bule…” These voices seemingly jumping back and forth dancing around the room. I look around the ceiling scanning for anything that could emit this sound but once again to no avail.

My mind begins to wander, I… I can’t seem to remember where I was before this. Is this some sort of UFO? Am I a victim in some psychopaths twisted little science experiment? ….Did I die? The beeping won’t fucking stop… I begin to move my legs to stand up but immediately slam myself back down to the metal table and writhe in pain.

This THING is clawing out of my chest. I look down in horror as my chest begins to split open, I attempt to scream but nothing will come out. My skin is starts to peel back and my sternum begins to crack, any pain I would’ve felt is numbed by the adrenaline running through me. 

I can see something wriggling inside my chest cavity, a hissing sound echos throughout inside me. The hiss begins to get louder and louder as I finally muster up the strength and attempt to pull out the creature inhabiting my chest but my arms can no longer move, in fact none of my limbs can move. 

Smoke hits my face once again causing my vision to blur. I try to fight it but I’m only delaying the inevitable. My vision returns to the pitch black I recall from before I woke up. 

“Beep…. Beep…. Beep……. Yes you can see him now Mrs. Davis, the open heart surgery was a success….”
