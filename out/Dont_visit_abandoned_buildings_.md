Don’t go visit abandoned places 

I think it has to do when we gone camping.
It was her birthday. 
So I thought that was a good idea since she likes nature and also the woods we were visiting have a lot of abandoned buildings and houses even schools.

My friend and I were just camping. 
We were also exploring abandoned houses (it was a hobby my friend and I liked to do even through I’m often scared and she tries to calm me down)
One of the buildings was a big White House but also some red and green color is on it my friend said it was definitely blood,I thought she was joking.

But she told me that the other houses also had bl00d if you looked through the windows. I didn’t believed her since I only saw normal house that very bit scattered. 
But on the big white house were biohazard signs.

Despite that my friend wanted to go in ,I first warned here but she convinced me to go in. 
I think the place was for lab experiments 
Since we saw a lot of bl00d and many test tubes. 

But after some while I had an odd feeling. 
It was weird. The place looks weird. And it also smelled bit rotten.
So l decided to go out but my friend still wanted to explore and she was quite stubborn about it so I let her explore. 

One thing you have to know is my friend is quite brave type of person. I on the other hand more reserved. 
I don't know if it even has to do with it but something is telling me why my friend is sick and behaves so strange is because of that abandoned lab we visited.
And I still feel guilty about it.

After the visiting she said she had pain in her leg she told me she accidentally hurt herself in there and so we gone to home. 
But I decided to visit her but 
my friend could barely talk. 
And she is very pale. 

I think she might has rabies since has foam in her mouth I think but for some reason it's still strange because rabies has usually incubation period for very long. And the foam was lightly yellow. I did call a doctor but they said it's not a big of a deal. But I think it is my friend doesn't want to seem to eat anything. 

And I still feel like something is wrong. And I decided to visit a doctor I wanted to take my friend but she didn't wanted. But the doctor said my friend is ok but I should not go to her house all the time. And just let her heal. And it wasn't rabies.

Despite what the doctor told me I decided to visit my friend. 
Honestly I don’t believe my doctor how can my friend heal on her own? She barely feed herself. 
Later when I was walking down the streets I smelled something rotten and it was a similar smell at my friends house despite me couldn’t opening her home I forgot to take her keys. But I smelled something rotten. 

And through the window everything was covered with bl00d. 
But also green and yellow color was there too. 
And then I saw the back door it was open. 
It’s weird how can this happen my friend was laying on her bed just before I was going to the doctor.

And I decided to call the police maybe some criminal done something to my friend.
The police told me they were already on the way because someone else called them before too.
I decided to go away maybe the criminal is still around. 

I also had almost no energy left probably this whole thing was stressing me out. 
Weirdly enough when I was looking through my window my neighborhood were no single human and when I opened my window it started to smell rotten. 

This is very weird. So I decided to call the police 
They told me I should stay at my place and not go out they found many bodies including my friends body and my friend is infected with an unknown virus.

And it’s highly contagious. 
I felt shocked 
Is that why i also started to feel sick I looked in my mirror only to see how pale I got.
 
… 

Update: 
I feel so weak and hungry.
I don’t know why I decided to go it was stupid of me. 
Pls don’t explore abandoned buildings even if they seem harmless. 
Don’t make the same mistake.
I feel so hungry. 
I really want to eat something.
