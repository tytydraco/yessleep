>Male 1: Robert Hershel? 

>Male 2: Yeah, goes by Bob.

>Male 1: Where did we find this guy?

>Male 2: He’s a… Let me double check… He’s a stunt guy. Done some canyon jumps, daredevil stuff. Not well known, in the early part of his career. You know, the *do anything for a break* phase.

>Male 1: This is the guy we’re putting up first? Look at him…

>Male 2: I know, I know… But the personality tests all came back good. He’s got a good face. It’s a win if everything goes well. We just have to keep someone with him to manage the drinking. And if it doesn’t; no family, no professional contacts, you know the drill. He’s actually perfect.

>Male 1: If you say so.

>Male 1: Okay, so do you have any questions before they seal you in?

>Robert Hershel (RS): Not really. The chute deploys itself, right?

>Male 1: Yes, it has an altitude sensor. But you’ll find a ripcord in the usual spot.

>RH: The one over my shoulder?

>Male 1: Yes… in the usual spot.

>RH: Look, I’ve never parachuted before. I’m a big jump guy.

>Male 1: You’ve never… wait what? How have you never… You’re a stunt guy!

>RH: Chutes add weight, never used’em in jumps.

>Male 1: You don’t…. It’s fine. Yes, the cord over your shoulder. It’s the backup manual chute. Pull it if the altitude sensor starts chirping and the main doesn’t deploy. Give it fifteen seconds or so. You don’t want both chutes out getting tangled.

>RH: Sounds good.

>Male 1: Alright, the ground crew will complete a final check and seal you up. You’ll have plenty of air so, don’t worry. We’ve done all the math. All you have to do is jump when we say, copy?

>RH: That’s a copy.

>Male 1: Are you kidding me!? The man has never used a parachute before!

>Male 2: It’s fine. It’s all automated.

>Male 1: He doesn’t know how to land! He’s gonna break his god damned legs!

>Male 2: No no no, he was briefed in the landing procedure. He’s incredibly athletic, it will be fine.

>Male 1: This is going to be a god damned disaster. Mark my words.

>Male 2: It’s going to be fine. 

>Male 1: Russia just put a fucking *dog* into orbit, Gene. We’re under the…

>Male 2: Whoa whoa whoa, no names. You heard the Colonel.

>Male 1: Sorry, augh… It’s just… Look. We both worked our whole lives to get to this point. And it’s all riding on some cowboy who’s never done the *one thing* that is vital to this mission’s success.

>Male 2: It’s *fine*. It’s all automated. Nothing can go wrong.

>Male 1: He’s heading into the Stratosphere, there are ten things for every individual piece of that craft that could go wrong. And that’s not even bringing into consideration all the things Bob could screw up.

>Male 2: All he has to do is sit still for three hours and jump when the light flashes.

>Male 1: He’s going to see the sky dissolve around him. I think you’re being a little optimistic about his ability to *sit still*.

>Male 2: Then we should have put one of the test pilots in.

>Male 1: You’re right, *obviously*. <a drawn out sigh is heard> But the brass couldn’t justify wasting all the money they’re spending training those guys if something goes wrong. I believe their exact words were “These men are being trained to claim outer space for America. I’m not going to lose one on a balloon ride.”

>Male 2: Look, I don’t know what to tell you. We’re like three and a half hours from launch here.

>Male 1: I just… I have concerns

0752 December 28th, 1957 – 8 Minutes to Launch.

>Male 1: How are you feeling?

>RH: Good, real good. Excited!

>Male 1: Alright, well. You have a three hour ascent. We’re aiming to level the craft out at forty-nine kilometers, just shy of the Mesosphere. The pod will supply oxygen to your suit until the jump light switches on, at which point the suit will automatically detach. After that you have enough oxygen in your suit’s reserves for about fifty minutes. Should be around ten times what you need for the descent phase. Any questions?

>RH: Hang out for three hours, see the light, jump. Got it.

>Male 1: Well, make sure the oxygen line detaches. But other than that, yes.

>RH: What if it doesn’t?

>Male 1: <sounds annoyed> If you will recall the training video, there is a manual release pull under your left armpit.

>RH: Right, yes. Armpit. Of course. And the reserve chute is over my shoulder… here. Alright, I’m good.

>Male 1: Good to hear.

>Male 2: Okay, in a few seconds you will start to hear the countdown over coms. Try to stay calm.

>RH: It’s fine. I’m fine.

>Male 1: BP and pulse look good.

>RH: You can see my pulse?

>Male 1: Yes. What… what did you think all the…

>Countdown Voice: 10.

>RH: Ah, here we go.

>CV: 9.

>Male 2: Ok, it’s not a rocket, so…

>CV: 8.

>Male 2: So there shouldn’t be an…

>CV: 7.

>RH: I know, I did actually…

>CV: 6.

>RH: …pay attention a little.

>CV: 5.

>Male 1: Readings are still good.

>CV: 4.

>RH: I told you, I’m…

>CV: 3.

>RH: …fine.

>CV: 2

>Male 2: Okay, brace for launch.

>CV: 1

>RH: I’m plenty braced for…

>CV: Launch is go.

>RH: SHHHHHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

>Male 1: BP and Pulse are rising.

>Male 2: Wow, that thing really took off.

>RH: RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrr… Okay, okay okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay okay okay.

>Male 1: Are… you okay?

>RH: I’m okay. 

>Male 2: Okay, well. The initial acceleration burst was a lot greater than anticipated, but nothing dangerous.

>Male 1: Vitals are coming back down.

>RH: Yeah, I’m good. I’m good. Nice view, actually.

>Male 2: Okay, well. We’re going to go check the sensors. Make sure everything is still on track. We’ll be on coms if you need us.

>RH: Roger. Thanks guys.

>Male 1: Yep.

0843 December 28th, 1957 – 2 Hours 17 Minutes from Descent Phase (est).

>RH: So how are we looking? Getting close?

>Male 1: Sorry, can you repeat?

>RH: Are we getting close to the jump point?

>Male 1: No. There’s still over two hours of ascent.

>RH: TWO HOURS!? I’M ALREADY LIKE A HUNDRED MILES UP!

>Male 1: You’re nowhere near one hundred miles in elevation, currently. You do have a clock up there, right?

>RH: I mean, let me… Okay, there it is. Wow, it’s only been forty-five minutes?

>Male 2: The good news is, due to the greater than expected initial burst you’re actually ahead of schedule. 

>RH: How does that affect my jump time? Have you guys figured out…

>Male 1: Don’t worry. The process to notify you when to jump and disconnect you from the craft’s life support system is set to trigger based on altitude, not duration of ascent. So the shifting timeline won’t affect the safety of your jump.

>RH: Alright, thanks. Good to know.

>Male 1: Jesus, he’s way ahead of schedule. How much helium did they put in that thing?

>Male 2: The same amount they did during the test launches.

>Male 1: Did testing get the weight wrong of something?

>Male 2: No, in fact the craft is just shy of 4 pounds heavier than the test craft.

>Male 1: I’m just trying to figure out the math. None of the variables changed appreciably, so why was the ascent that drastically different?

>Male 2: We’ll figure it out when we go over the telemetry data.

>Male 2: Robert. Robert, do you copy? Bob? Jesus. Can someone send a squelch or something?

>(Very loud static noise)

>RH: HOLY GOD DAMNED WHAT THE

>Male 1: BP and Pulse are elevated.

>Male 2: Bob, Bob! Hey! You back with us?

>RH: What? Where… Oh. Yeah. Right. Sorry, I fell asleep. How far are we… Oh geez. Still an hour out.

>Male 1: Vitals stabilizing.

>Male 2: Nope, new estimation is fifteen minutes. You’re ascending a lot quicker than expected.

>RH: Oh wow, thanks. Aw, son of a… The sky is pitch black now. Slept right through the transition.

>Male 1: It shouldn’t be *pitch* black, there should still be a little blue out there. It’s thin, but there is still a lot of atmosphere between you and space.

>RH: Nope, pitch black. No blue, no stars. Nothing.

>Male 2: No stars… Hmmm…

>Male 1: Well, the Sun is a star, so…

>RH: Yeah yeah, no sun either.

>Male 2: No sun?

>Male 1: The pod door should be facing the sun. It should be basically directly in front of you.

>RH: Nope.

>Male 2: let me check the sensors.

>Male 1: You can still see the Earth, though?

>RH: Oh yeah. Looks real pretty. Is uh… Is everything okay?

>Male 1: It’s uh… It’s fine.

>Male 2: All sensors indicate everything is where it’s supposed to be. A little ahead of schedule, but everything is otherwise going basically perfect.

>RH: Alright. Whoa, hey. Is there supposed to be someone else up here with me?

>Male 1: What do you mean?

>Male 2: Someone else? What are you seeing?

>RH: I don’t know, it’s dark. Looks like maybe another pod?

>Male 1: Radar?

>Male 2: Um… Nothing. You’re all clear up there.

>RH: I’m telling you, there’s someone… OH SHI

>Male 1: Robert? Robert, come in. Report. What’s going on?

>Male 2: We lost him, sensors are… 

>Male 1: That’s impossible. Radar?

>Male 2: Nothing. No radar signature, no sensor data, no telemetry, no voice.

>Male 1: Well he didn’t just vanish. Find him. I’ve got to report to the Colonel. Dropping off coms.

>Male 2: Calm down, it’s okay, we’ve got you. (away from mic) Get GC1 back in here. (back into mic) Bob, man. Wow. It’s good to hear you. Quite a relief.

>RH: I don’t… What’s…

>Male 1: You back with us, Bob? Alright, your vitals are spiking. Try to calm down. We’ve got you.

>Male 2: We’ve got radar, sensors, and telemetry back online.

>RH: Back online? Did they… What’s going on?

>Male 1: We lost you for a few minutes, but we’re good now. Looks like you’re still on target to jump in… less than a minute now.

>RH: What? You said fifteen minutes like thirty seconds ago.

>Male 2: Bob, what time does your clock show?

>RB: Nine fifty-nine. 

>Male 1: Uh…

>Male 2: Okay, Bob. It looks like we’ve had some kind of de-sync. Um… Alright. Prepare for… What the… Bob?

>Male 1: What’s going on?

>Male 2: We lost him again. Bob? Bob!?

>Male 1: Radar?

>Male 2: No, he’s gone. No sensors, coms, nothing.

>Male 2: Whoa whoa whoa, Bob? You back with us?

>RH: *Back* with you?

>Male 2: Um… Hmm… Bob, what time does your clock say?

>RH: Still nine fifty-nine. Same as when you asked three seconds ago. Oh, scratch that. I guess it’s ten now.

>Male 2: Okay, we’re tracking you… Oh shi… Bob, I need you to manually disconnect and jump, now.

>RH: Manually? What happened to…

>Male 2: Bob, disconnect and jump, now. I’ll be on coms if need me, but don’t waste time talking.

>Male 1: SEVENTY FIVE!?

>Male 2: I know, plus his clock is showing 1000.

>Male 1: Well obviously the sensors are…

>Male 2: No, he’s indicated that no time has passed since we lost him almost forty five minutes ago.

>Male 1: That’s not possible.

>Male 2: The sensors also indicate…

>Male 1: That’s not how *time works*.

>Male 2: I’m just telling you what… Okay, he’s jumping. Hopping back on the other line.

>RH: Okay, stepping out now.

>Male 2: Okay, you might feel weightless, like you aren’t falling. But if you look back at the pod you’ll see you are descending in relation to it very rapidly. Try to stay calm.

>Rh: I’m uh… I’m still even with the pod.

>Male 1: Did you jump?

>RH: Yes, I jumped. I’m still even with the pod. I’m just moving away from it sideways.

>Male 1: That’s not…

>RH: Okay, quick update. The pod is now below me.

>Male 2: Uh…

>Male 1: Say again?

>RH: Guys, the pod is below me. Like, really far below me. Is it…

>Male 2: Radar confirms the pod is still level at seventy five… it’s gone. Bob?

>Male 1: Bob, are you still with us? Bob!?

>RH: It’s just… Lots of stars. The Sun is pretty bright. No sign of the pod. The Earth is… It’s getting pretty small.

>Male 2: Okay, we got you on radar and… (away from mic) Is that right? Verify that. Now. (back to mic) Okay, we have eyes on you, Bob.

>Male 2: Yes. Radar showed him at a hundred and thirty seven kilometers.

>Male 1: No. Not possible.

>Male 2: I agree. But that’s what the data shows.

>Male 1: Okay, we accepted he was experiencing time loss, but his progression was linear. It lined up with our timeline, at least on our end. This is… That is a massive jump in acceleration.

>Male 2: Radar wasn’t tracking enough movement to account for the leap in distance, though.

>Male 2: …a bit frustrating. But we’ll just have to wait for each other to respond. Copy?

>Male 2: That’s a complicated question, Robert. I promise we’ll keep you up to date, but it’s an extremely fluid situation.

>RH: I DON’T GIVE A FUCK WHAT KIND OF-

>Male 1: We lost him. Did radar ever get a bead on him?

>Male 2: No, but the coms guys tell me based on the delay… Jesus. One hundred fifteen million kilometers.

1632 April 3rd, 1982

>Male 1: At twelve oh eight, March thirtieth, coms were interrupted by and unknown third party. What did we learn?

>Male 2: The signal originated within the Boötes void, very likely at or near the center.

>Male 1: The what?

>Male 2: The Boötes void, sir. It’s a recently discovered void in space, nearly three hundred and thirty million light-years in diameter.

>Male 1: So that’s… big…

>Male 2: It’s, yes. It’s big. The center is close to seven hundred million light years from Earth. For a radio signal to originate there… It would have had to have been sent… Well. Nearly a billion years ago.

>Male 1: So it’s fake.

>Male 2: We’re not sure…

>Male 1: There wasn’t an English speaking entity seven hundred million light-years from Earth a billion years ago. It’s fake. Find out how they did it.

>Male 2: Okay, we’ll… We’ll look into it.

>Female 1: No question, it’s from the Boötes void, near the edge closest to Earth.

>Male 1: What are we talking about here?

>Female 1: Well, it’s basically a five minute recording of what sounds like a human crying.

>Male 1: So what is it *actually*?

>Female 1: Well, we thought it was probably just some weird anomalous noise, but here at the end… Just listen.

>Unknown: (a few seconds what sounds like crying plays, obviously a recording) There’s so many stars now… They’re so close… Gene? Ray? Can you guys still hear me? (crying continues)

>Male 1: So where is it actually from?

>Female 1: It’s from the edge of the Boötes void, closest to…

>Male 1: No it isn’t. It can’t be. 

>Female 1: I know, but… Look, we checked everything. *That* signal came from the edge of the Boötes void. Trust me, I didn’t believe it either.

>Male 1: It’s just not possible…

>Female 1: I wouldn’t have thought so either, but… I mean, look.
