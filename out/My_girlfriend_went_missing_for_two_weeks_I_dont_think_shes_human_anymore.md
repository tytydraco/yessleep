I woke up to an empty bed, cold and devoid of my girlfriend's warmth. This wasn't completely unusual; she was a night owl and often stayed up late to study. But two weeks had passed since I last saw her and her disappearance was starting to worry me. The only contact we had was a single text message, she had claimed to be taking a spontaneous trip to visit her family, but it seemed out of character for her to leave without telling me first. I spent the two weeks drowning in paranoia and fear. The campus was quiet, and there was a storm brewing outside. 

I couldn't shake this feeling - like something was watching me, waiting for me to slip up, as my mind kept playing out scenarios, like she was kidnapped or hurt, but I couldn't shake off the nagging feeling that something more sinister was at play. My thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door at the two-week mark as I contemplating calling the police. My heart raced with anticipation as I quickly made my way to the door, hoping and praying that it was her. As I opened the door, relief washed over me as I saw her standing there, soaking wet from the rain. But as I looked closer, I couldn't help but notice that something was off. Her body language was different, and her eyes seemed lifeless. There was a strange odor emanating from her, a strange musty smell I had never encountered before that had the slight of death. 

But I couldn't quite put my finger on it, and I didn't want to scare her off by being suspicious. Instead, I hugged her tightly, trying to push my doubts aside and enjoy the moment. She didn't say much as she settled into the apartment, only that she had missed me and that she was happy to be back. But there was something in her tone that made me uneasy, like she was just going through the motions. She refused to talk about where she had been or what had happened to her, brushing it off as a private matter that she needed time to process.

As the days passed, my suspicions only grew stronger. Her behavior was odd - she would stare at me for long periods of time, as if studying my every move. She wouldn't eat much, and when she did, she picked at her food as if it were poisoned, only eating meat and the bloodiest foods. She was avoiding physical touch, and when I tried to hold her hand, she would flinch away. I couldn't help but feel like she had been replaced by some sort of imposter, it seemed impossible, but the more I thought about it, the more convinced I became. 

I had heard stories of skin walkers, of beings who could mimic human forms and take on their identities. And the more I thought about it, the more it made sense - the strange smell, the lifeless eyes, the odd behavior. One night, I decided to confront her about my suspicions. As I sat her down and asked her what had really happened during her two-week absence, she just stared at me with a blank expression on her face. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, and my palms were sweaty with nerves. But as she spoke, my worst fears were confirmed

"I'm not your girlfriend," she said with a voice that sounded like hers, but somehow different.

"What the fuck are you then?"

"A servant for a higher being. You will be its sacrifice."

I watched in horror as my 'girlfriend' stared daggers into me as her eyes turned black with evil, and her jaw slowly opened, elongating around several times the regular length as a normal person's. Some kind of fucking guttural song played through her vocal cords, and I rushed to the kitchen, grabbing a knife as I turned and ran out of my apartment. She stared at me as I ran, and I didn't stop until I got in my car and was a hundred miles away from whatever the fuck that was.

I wasn't really worried about the mimic itself.
