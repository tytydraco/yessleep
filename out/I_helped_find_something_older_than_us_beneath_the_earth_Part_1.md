I never use Reddit. It is hardly the place for academic discussion. And yet, due to reasons outside my control, I am trapped in another country, with limited internet access, and soon I will be dead. What I have to say needs to be posted somewhere, and this is all I can manage with my VPN.

Allow me to explain myself:

I am an archaeologist of some renown. I graduated from Oxford more than fifteen years ago, and in my career I have been fortunate to work on some of the oldest sites ever discovered in human history. I was part of the expedition in Turkey that uncovered an underground city millennia older than the pyramids.

I was there in the Amazon when we uncovered ruins that prove South American civilisation to stretch further back into the past than we thought. I helped uncover a cache of fossilised hominid bone fragments in the savannahs of Africa that changed our understanding of human evolution.

So believe me when I say, the findings of my current expedition have the potential to rewrite the very history of intelligent life on earth.

And I wish we had never gone searching for it.

A while ago, Dr Matthews, another archaeologist that I had an amiable relationship with, emailed me quite out of the blue. We hadn’t seen each other in some years, as his area of expertise lay in more recent East-Asian archaeology, of which he is exceedingly knowledgeable. You could show him a ceramic fragment from any point in the last five-thousand years, and he could likely narrow it down to a century and an area of a few hundred miles.

His email spoke of an exceedingly rare offer. A Dr Zhou, head of archaeology at a small Chinese university, had contacted Matthews, with an offer that asked him to travel at once to Chongqing, bringing whatever other specialists he considered necessary. There was a substantial monetary incentive, although a lack of details as to the nature of the dig.

It is very uncommon for the Chinese government to allow foreign archaeologists into their nation, given how protective they are of their cultural history and the near-isolationist tendencies of the country. Intrigued, he’d left within the week. He sent me an email within the first day of his arrival.

I too was captivated by the offer, rare as it was, and the financial terms were very appealing.

Therefore, I set out at once.

The flight was uneventful, although marred by dark clouds and heavy turbulence on the approach to  Chongqing Jiangbei International. The airport, and the city itself, were fantastically modern, though I stayed only one night. The lights and skyscrapers towering over the winding river were a huge departure from the dig sites of Africa or Southern Turkey. It reminded me of nothing so much as a mixture of New York, Hong Kong, and maybe Tokyo.

With the jet-lag and the general fatigue incurred by travel at such short notice, it was late in the morning the next day that a driver fetched me from my hotel, and spirited me on a three-hour journey northwards.

The lights of the city fell away, and gave way to rice fields and factory complexes. The further north we drove, the higher the ground climbed, my ears popping every hour, until we were in the high, dry mountains and valleys of northern China, not too far in relative terms to where the hills gave way to the high-altitude plains of inner Mongolia.

When we arrived, it was immediately clear that the dig site lay at the bottom of what had been a massive, square open-pit mine. It was miles across, and must have been nearly a mile deep, the benches, as they are properly called, twisted down in a neat and even spiral into the yellowed, dusty earth.

Huge industrial machinery and barracks-like lodgings for the workers dotted the surface. This high up, the air was thin and dry and I felt decidedly unwell as I stepped out the car. I was met by a press of people. An endless stream of government officials in black suits despite the oppressive heat came forward, bowing or shaking hands, exchanging pleasantries in English or Mandarin.

After the onslaught came a noticeably younger man, small of stature, wearing glasses, behind which his eyes burned feverishly, and his manner was jerky and excited.

“Dr Zhou, I presume?”

The joke flew over the man’s head, as he reciprocated my handshake weakly.

“Yes, I am Zhou, welcome to Shaanxi province. It is a great honour to have you here.”

“You speak excellent English.” Was all I could come up with, feeling as weak as I did. Yet the man smiled.

“Thank you. English is very important, I think. This is my first time to work with foreign archaeologists. I am very excited.”

“And yet you seem quite young to be leading an expedition?”

The man nodded, a sort of half-bow, rubbing at his hair in an embarrassed gesture.

“Ah, yes. Originally, it was though that the findings would be small. In Shaanxi, the most important places are in Xi’An, many kilometres north of here.”

I nodded. “Yes, the burial site of the first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, and his terracotta army.”

He smiled. “I am glad to hear you know so much. I was told you do not specialise in Chinese history, unlike your friend Dr Matthews.”

“No, I do not. I mostly focus on pre-historic archaeology, late Palaeolithic to early Holocene.”

“Ah yes, I see,” said Zhou, “that will be most useful I think. I understand why Dr Matthews called on you.”

The government officials mostly left, driven away in a fleet of black cars, whilst two younger men stayed, carrying my luggage and trailing us as we walked towards the accommodations. There were many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of labourers, all clad in pale blue jumpsuits and white helmets. They flocked all over the equipment and the settlement of prefabricated lodgings. They sat on small chairs at low tables, eating noodles and rice around communal dishes of pork or duck or soup, and it seemed nearly every one of them was smoking.

We passed quickly, heading towards larger, less austere lodgings. The whole time, the young Dr Zhou seemed to be having problems conveying the scale of the dig at the bottom of the pit. He said it was quite large, but would not provide an exact scale. Larger than a few square meters, perhaps a few hundred. He said I would understand when I saw it.

At first I thought that perhaps the site had only just been uncovered, but he informed me that was not so, that several relics had already been brought up. I stopped.

“Relics? As in, complete, not fragmentary?”

“Indeed. We are struggling very much with our analysis. That is why foreign experts were recruited.”

“What sort of relics?”

He shrugged. “Tablets, statues. Other things of unknown purpose. They are very heavy, and difficult to move, even with equipment.”

“Stone?” I was struggling to understand what could stay intact for so long, given how deep the mine had to be.

“We are unsure. You will understand later.”

For now though, I was exhausted. Lethargic. I quickly settled in the accommodations, which were surprisingly well furnished and spacious. After a brief but restful nap, I felt somewhat better, and was just unpacking when a knock came at my door.

Dr Matthews was wearing his usual hat, though his goatee had turned grey in the years since I last saw him. A smile lit his face, but not his eyes, as he greeted me warmly.

“How the devil, are you, man? How was the flight? Oh, have you ever been to China before?” His usual barrage was a bit weaker than normal.

“I am quite alright, the flight was fine, save some turbulence. And no, I’ve never had the pleasure. It seems a nice country, though the food might not agree with me. I was never one for spices.”

“That’s rather normal,” Matthews clapped me on the back as he lead me back out into the dust and sunlight, “you’ll acclimatise eventually.”

Walking besides me so close, I could see he looked haggard, eyes weighed heavy with deep, bruise-like sleeplessness.

“And how are you, Matthews? You seem tired.”

“Oh, I’m fine, just fine. A few problems with the dig, as there always are. Have you met Zhou? Cracking fellow, isn’t he?”

“Oh yes, he seems… keen. What sort of problems?”

A look of puzzlement crossed Matthew’s face. “Well, it’s… rather difficult to explain. We’re having problems establishing the grid.”

Every archaeological dig is broken down into one or two square meter grids. Sometimes the overall shape is more a rectangle, or perhaps an L shape.

“Is there trouble with locating the extent of the site? Deeper examinations showing it’s larger than first thought?”

Matthew looked perturbed to be thinking about it. “Not quite. It’s just… the site is confusing. You’ll see for yourself shortly.”

Together we came to the edge of the sprawl of lodgings, and there I met the rest of the archaeology team. It was incredibly small for the size of the mine, only six Chinese archaeologists, all from either Tsinghua University in Beijing, or Peking University. All spoke fine English, and many were older than Dr Zhou, closer to my own age.

And then there was Dr Popov and Miss Koslova, both from Moscow. Popov was elderly, almost skeletal, and his face was deeply sunken and fixed in a permanent scowl. Koslova, on the other hand, was young and smiled when she spoke English, introducing the both of them quite fluently.

“-and please forgive Dr Popov, he cannot speak English, though he is very good at Mandarin.”

“No forgiveness needed, we are guests in China; it is us who should speak their language, rather than expecting everyone to speak English.”

It was at this time nearly midday, and as the journey to the base of the pit took nearly two hours, Dr Zhou announced we would have lunch before we went. Very shortly, a group of low tables had been dragged together, and the Chinese archaeologists, along with Dr Popov, were helping women from the kitchens carry out grate pots and platters of food.

Koslova, Matthews, and I sat around looking rather out of place amongst the efficiency and communal spirit on display.

“So then, my girl,” Matthew struck up, talking around me, “first time in China?”

“Da,” the girl nodded, “yes. But I have been help Dr Popov on many excavations in east Russia, on the island of Sakhalin too. The Ainu people are most interesting.”

“Oh, smashing!” Matthews went on. “I myself spent a great deal of time cataloguing Ainu relics for Hokkaido University.”

The conversation continued around me, whilst I stood and considered the great hole in the landscape, which started but a few hundred meters from where I stood. I considered that scar in the earth, and for a moment I had an impulse to rush over to the brink and stare deep down into that hole.

The feeling, the urge to gaze into that abyss, was like a physical pressure, and I was so sorely tempted. The pressure pounded at my ears, akin to a hum or buzzing that only I could feel.

The sensation lasted but a second before it passed.

I did notice though, that all conversation and movement had stalled. Looking around, everyone had the same expression, as if they themselves had considered the very same action as I.

Quickly, everyone returned to their duties, and in an instant I was sat between Matthews and one of the Chinese Archaeologists, an older man named Xhen-Wi, from Tsinghua, who kept refilling my plastic cup with burning, eye-watering liquor that I struggled to keep down.

Xhen-Wi laughed easily, first at my reaction to the fiery Chinese spirit, then at my poor attempt at using chopsticks. It is something I’ve never mastered, usually asking for a fork or spoon instead, yet I persevered as there was no alternative here.

I ate plain rice, along with some sort of spiced braised pork with scallions and an overwhelming amount of chillies. It was almost too much, but luckily someone passed a plate and I was able to eat a plainer cut of duck that suited my palette much better.

I turned to Xhen-Wi, and asked a question that had been on my mind. “How is it that Dr Zhou is in charge of this dig, when there are so many more… experienced archaeologists present?”

He considered, taking a sip of hot-pot soup before he turned to me. “is quite simple. He was here first. When the miners first find things, they call him. He is local, yes?”

“I see.”

Soon enough we were finished, and packed into three trucks we began the steady descent into the pit.

The journey was endless, hypnotic in its symmetry and rhythm. A long, steady decline, a sharp turn, and the pattern repeated. Despite being the middle of the day, we travelled so deep that the sun itself fell below the walls of the pit, and threw us into an endless twilight, so deep in the earth that we ventured into a place the sun had not touched in aeons.

I was confused, as we travelled in silence, for we passed beneath rock and earth far older than any of our experience. First the youthful sediments and soil of the Holociene and Pleoscene passed in the first through hundred meters.

Next, the layered sediment that must have reached back millions of years. Finally, as the twilight darkened our world and sediment gave way to hard, igneous rock from the days of the earth’s birth, and the heat began to feel stuffy and oppressive, even with the truck’s air-conditioning, I could see now the bottom of the pit.

I was confused; no ancient civilisation had the capacity to dig this deep, to bury things at such a level. Explosives and modern excavation technology was required to pierce this deep into the heart of the earth. What could possibly be down here to interest archaeologists? This was the realm of geologist, for even the fossils of the earliest of earth’s creatures were hundreds of meters above.

We stopped upon the final bench, and climbed out our trucks into suffocating heat and pressure, and looked upon the site we were tasked with uncovering.

There, surrounded by black rock were objects blacker still. They stood, partially exhumed from their stone tomb, and I saw the problem. The shape of them, how those things that had never seen the sun, were impossible to establish a perimeter around.

For they were arranged in an impossible shape.

It is not something I can describe here, in words, nor would photographic evidence do it justice. The arrangement of them was mind-bending, non-Euclidean, and just looking upon them I felt a grave and sudden distress.

And yet I was drawn to them. We all were.

We all but ran down the slope, even those who had been down before, my mind racing with possibilities.

Could this be a hoax? Something planted by the Chinese government, or by Zhou? No, that would not explain how they were laid out.

Perhaps, then some natural formation? Some material deposit compacted and compressed into these shapes by billions of years and great pressure? Maybe, but I still could not fathom it.

We reached them, in that sunless pit, and I looked upon the one closest to me.

Blacker than night, blacker than black, it drew me in completely. It was so dark, it was hard to make out, yet it looked like a figure, one both whole and familiar, yet sprawling with too many limbs that almost seemed to change and fluctuate as I approached.

And there was its head.

A great and terrible, gutting thing shaped like a shovel of teeth and tongues and too many eyes.

My mind was abuzz, yet there was a sensation, like a humming, a vibration that ran through me in time with the workings of my brain. It felt like it came from the figure before me, that it was somehow calling to me.

I reached for that perfect, monstrous form, forgetting gloves and procedure. I laid a hand upon it. It was smooth, and cold as the grave. Instantly, I pulled away, unnerved by the sensation that ran up my arm. Beneath my fingers, I had felt indentations, like carvings. I leaned in, and indeed there were carvings running around the figure, so neatly arranged that they seemed most deliberate, almost like writing.

They were like nothing I had ever seen, no tongue of man, for they flowed and twisted organically, creating symbols of infinite complexity. It had no analogue, not akin to cuneiform or ancient Chinese. Hieroglyphs they were not, for they seemed not pictographic at all. Nor was it of those unknown systems, the Indus script, proto-Elamite, Vinca, or Olmec. It was alien to all that I knew.

My arm and hand burned feverishly, and I looked around the site at my companions, coming almost out of my stupor.

Matthews was on his knees before one, caressing it with both hands, an enraptured look on his face.

Zhou was shaking, eyes locked on the indescribable titan before him. I went to each in turn, and placing a hand on their shoulder, I gently broke them from their reverie.

Xhen-Wi stood apart with Miss Koslova, looks of concern, almost fright, upon their face. Popov stood yet further, a dark look on his face as he muttered in Russian. Zhou approached him, and the two fell into intense discussion, as Matthews and I went to the others, bringing them back to their senses.

The site was not large, but dense with towering figures blacker than basalt, and despite their impossible arrangement, the site should not take long to fully uncover, depending on what tools we had access to.

Our reconnaissance done, we returned to out vehicles and began our ascent from that dark and terrible pit. We travelled in silence up the symmetry of the benches, until we were once again blessed with the presence of the sun.

I turned to Zhou, beside me, and asked. “How were they uncovered? They seem so undamaged, pristine, considering the density of the rock in which they were found.”

Zhou nodded. “The miners were using explosives. At first they thought they had found more coal, what you saw is the result of the blasting. Nothing the miners have damage the relics.”

“And some relics have been taken up and catalogued already?”

“Yes. A few tablets, that were sufficiently loosened from the stone.”

I nodded, part of me afraid to look upon those tablets, whilst a more primal part of me desired nothing more than to look upon that fascinating organic script.

 

………

 

When we reached the surface in the late afternoon, it was a sombre group that dispersed. We agreed that we would begin an attempt to establish a grid in the morning. Others, Popov and Xhen-Wi included, would attempt to catalogue the already retrieved artefacts. All agreed that the heat of being so deep in the earth would limit our time at the bottom of the pit to only an hour each, with a one hour break above before descending again.

It went unspoken that we feared becoming enraptured by the figures once more.

Matthews and I returned to our lodgings, our rooms being opposite. There, the heavily spiced food, the alcohol, and the stress of travel and heat must have caught up with me. I rushed for the bathroom.

Sweating and groaning, I passed a stool in excruciating pain that ran from my guts up into my arm. The smell was inhuman, like unrefined oil, and looking back before I flushed, the toilet was filled with a rancid and greasy black bile.

Outside, I was able to make a weak smile as Matthews emerged from his room, looking similarly haggard.

“The food really does not agree with me.”

Matthew grimaced back, “I think we must have had something bad for lunch, old chap.”

And so the two us, drained figuratively and literally, headed with trepidation towards dinner.

Despite my trepidation for the food, the dinner was far more elaborate and flavourful than lunch had been. The little tables were pushed together to form a longer one, and nearly everyone crowded around it. There were stews of lamb and mutton, noodles of many kinds, and rather wonderful fried bread filled with lamb or beef. The dishes here were less spicy and more complex, and we all shared and picked at our whims.

Once more, the fiery booze was passed around, though I drank much less time, and packs of strong, rough cigarettes were handed out. I did note, however, that Popov and Koslova sat separately, at their own table, a look of concern on the young woman’s face as Popov ate slowly and grimly from what appeared to be a Russian MRE.

The sun had long since set when the evening came to a close, and for myself the worries of the day had passed and given way to the relaxed spirit of our little community. On the way back however, I found myself walking behind Zhou. I saw that his hands still trembled, and there was a general jerkiness to his movements, like a cornered animal.

“Are you alright, Zhou?”

He nearly jumped out of his skin at the words, and turned to me with a look of utter terror, one that he concealed behind a fast smile.

“Oh! You surprise me! I am okay, I think. Maybe tomorrow though, I worry about going back down, yes?” His eyes gleamed like those of a cat in the darkness.

“Yes. I’m not looking forward to it.”

“I have asked for some special equipment to be delivered, for measurements, and more explosives, also.”

“Very good,” I said, “very good.”

I wished him a pleasant rest, and retired to my rooms. There, although I felt better, the lunch must still have been affecting Matthews, for I heard him groaning through the walls. With no way to access the internet, I had little to do but sleep, despite his noise.

 

………

 

In the night, I had a terrible dream.

I was suffocating, entombed. I felt like I was being rushed by the weight of the world.

Then, before me was a hole, and at the bottom of the hole was bright, shining water.

I reached down, desperate to reach it, and I saw my arm was thin and twisted and blackened, and I knew that to touch the water would taint it forever, yet I was compelled.

I awoke at the moment my hand touched the surface.

In my bed, I was perspiring heavily, breathing raggedly.

I tried to get up, but was forced down by the most terrible and painful cramps within my guts. Soaking with sweat and burning on the inside, I was able to sit up, hunched over, hands over my belly.

I had to drag myself to the bathroom, and after passing more black foulness that stank of minerals and rawness, the pain subsided, and I was able to shower and get ready, though it was not yet dawn.

I was not alone in my restlessness, for I emerged from my room to find Matthews leaning against the wall in the hallway. He looked terrible, pale and drawn and somehow even thinner than he had been yesterday.

“You look awful.” I told him by way of greeting.

He smiled as he looked me up and down. “You aren’t looking so pretty yourself, my good man.”

It was true. I also had noticed that I looked rather ill in the mirror.

“Yes, I think it must be the food, or else perhaps the altitude.”

“Or it was them.”

Matthews’s voice wiped the smile off my face in an instant. Gone was only his usual good humour, his voice was like steel, cold and hard. I could do nothing but nod mutely, for as much as I hated to admit it, the statues at the base of the pit were haunting in their impossibility.

We emerged to find a smaller, less confident group than I had met yesterday. Zhou was not there, and Xhen-Wi informed me that Dr Zhou was sick, that he would not be joining us today. That he was resting. As such, it fell on Xhen-Wi to organise the four of us returning to the site.

We piled into the trucks, armed with various tools, ranging from fine brushes and spools of string to pickaxes and jackhammers. Once more, we made our descent, this time our spirits dropping with us, as we clambered down into the darkness of the false night, now darker and more total, early in the morning as it was.

When we reached our terminus, climbing out I was hit by the heat, and this time also by the smell. Among those impossible statues in their impossible layout, was the same coppery, mineral reek that had accompanied my foul ablutions that morning. It made me feel even more trepidation than I had that morning, and I exchanged a dark look with Matthews.

Our first hour brought little success. It was impossible to fit our grid across the site, akin to attempting to map a square on an irregular torus, one that seemed to twist and bend in response to your efforts. We gave up after the first few minutes, uncomfortable as we were under the watch of those silent dread titans. Leaving the lengths of twine discarded and twisted amongst them, we retrieved out tools.

We focused our efforts on what I believe to be the same statue I touched yesterday. It played tricks with our eyes, almost fluid, as we sought to free it from the tomb of rock that had encased it for millions, possibly billions, of years. It almost seemed to cast a spell on us, and we fell, enraptured, into a rhythmic, almost worshipful sequence.

The small and delicate chisels were discarded nearly immediately, and even the pickaxes made little progress in the hard igneous rock. Between the four of us, two with pneumatic drills and two with picks, we had mostly freed its legs by the end of our first stretch. Those twisted, monstrous legs, with too many joints and bending in sickening ways.

We left the pit at the instant the hour was up, and it was only when we were high enough to once again see sunlight that I realised none of us had uttered a word whilst down there. Like a body of ants, we had laboured in perfect sync and rhythm, each knowing instinctively what to do, as if we were rehearsing some grim play. It was not a pleasant realisation.

Once more at the surface, we were met with dark news. Zhou was dead. He’d been found on his toilet, and the ambulance had come to collect him half-an-hour ago. A haemorrhaging of the bowels, they had said.

I was shocked, and moved for the nervous little man. He had shown so much passion, and I was saddened to think that he hadn’t lived to see his discovery taken out of its grave.

However, a part of me was deeply concerned over the manner of his death. I could see on the solemn faces that Matthews and I were not alone in experiencing our own trouble with the food. Popov looked far grimmer than even the rest of us, not concerned, but tilting back his head and looking to the sky with a terrible set to his face. In his hand, he held a small orthodox rosary. He clutched the knotted leather in a white-knuckled grip. I approached him and Koslova.

“What of the tablets that were recovered? Have you been able to make any progress?”

Koslova turned to Popov, repeating my words in Russian, and the man just shook his head and looked away, refusing to meet my gaze. He was hiding something, but I let it go as Koslova gave me an apologetic look.

Xhen-Wi was beside himself, nearly to the point of tears, at the sudden loss of a colleague and the newfound responsibility of being the new leader of our dig. He took a long while to collect himself, as the rest of us lingered in sullen silence, all but Popov, who’d returned to his quarters complaining of fatigue.

Once our new leader had a handle on the situation, we returned to the darkness at the bottom of the pit three more times that day. Some swapped out, Matthews changing with Xhen-Wi, but we all worked in a hypnotic silence, with nothing but the rhythm of tools on stone and the humming in our heads. It was terrifying, being under the eternal watch of those dark figures. What they were made of, what the unintelligible words carved on them said, none of us yet knew.

I believe, if I had known what our findings would be, the fate of our cursed expedition, I would have left immediately, and ran to the ends of the earth to escape.

The next day, our new instruments and explosive charges arrived.

And with them came the military.
