# Entry 1 – My Perspective

I don’t know how to start this diary. I’ve spent several nights without sleep and, following my therapist’s advice, writing down all my nightmares might help reduce the episodes and, hopefully, help me sleep better. I’m not certain it will work, or that I’ll ever sleep through an entire night again, but I have to try.  
  
You see, ‘my dear diary,’ I’ve had nightmares for as long as I can remember. Some are less terrible than others—don’t get me wrong— they don’t happen every night. They depend on certain factors and are usually triggered by stress. And, as you can imagine, that didn’t make me very popular at sleepovers.  
  
What’s strangest about my nightmares is how I experience them: as if I slip into someone else’s mind and witness the terrible things happening to them. Only rarely am I the main character. As I told my therapist, sometimes I’m the protagonist—like in a video game—and other times I’m just a spectator, like watching a movie. But unlike a movie, the characters in my dreams return, repeat, and haunt me again and again.  
  
It’s 3:00 a.m. As I sip my lemon balm tea, I want to write down what I saw a few months ago, hoping I can sleep a little before dawn.

# The Fabric

Day 1  
Lilian, a costume designer, loved collecting unique fabrics: unusual patterns, strange textures, striking colors. To her, flea markets were real treasure mines. Her father called them ‘trash exchange fairs,’ but to Lilian they were anything but.  
  
That slow, boring Sunday, she decided to visit one. Among the clutter of forgotten objects, she found a stall run by an elderly man with a deeply lined face and a large nose, making him look unnervingly like a goblin. Inside a dusty trunk lay a single piece of fabric.  
  
Its color was impossible to name: somewhere between dark garnet red and a sickly purple—‘lung,’ she thought. To the touch it felt like suede, only rubberier. Definitely not velvet. Even though she sensed it would be difficult to sew, she didn’t hesitate to buy it.  
  
Before she left, the old man warned her: never leave it near fire, and lock it away in a chest every night, far from humidity. Lilian just shrugged; they were probably precautions for an antique fabric.

Day 2  
In her creative journal, Lilian wrote:  
  
\> ‘My process doesn’t arrive all at once. To design a garment, I study the fabric, watch it, let it speak to me. Sometimes that conversation lasts weeks. Today, though, the fabric is silent. I searched color cards for a match, tried to analyze its composition… nothing. I photographed it, placed it on the dress form, and it stayed mute.  
\> I’ll leave it there for now. Maybe it’ll talk to me in my dreams.’

Day 3  
And it did.  
  
I don’t know if it was a dream, sleep paralysis, or something worse, but I felt watched. The fabric was no longer on the dress form. It was floating above me.  
  
Suddenly it dropped onto my face, sealing my mouth and nose, smothering me. It tried to slide down my throat; I could feel it pushing inside as if it wanted to possess me. I couldn’t move—my body was paralyzed—and when I ran out of strength… I simply stopped fighting.  
  
I woke up the next morning as if nothing had happened. The fabric was on the floor, far from the dress form. The strangest thing was the vicious sore throat. I took cold syrup and convinced myself it was just a bad sleeping position. ‘It was just a cold,’ I repeated.  
  
I locked it away in the paused-projects trunk.

Day 4  
Three weeks have passed and I’m still sick. The doctors say it’s pneumonia. I take my medication, rest, but I’m not getting better. Maybe it’s just paranoia—a cruel trick of my mind in this feverish state. Maybe… I just need to sleep.

Day 5  
Six weeks later, I feel a little better. I’ve decided to let go of my irrational thoughts. The fabric isn’t a bad omen; it’s my opportunity. Today I took it out of the trunk to start a cocktail dress. I’m clinging to the idea it will be my redemption.

Day 6  
The dress is finished. But when I tried it on, the fabric began to adhere to my skin. It wasn’t just pressure: it was warm, damp, almost like an animal breathing against my body.  
  
Every movement pressed it tighter against my torso, as if it knew where it hurt. I tried to tear it off, but the fabric stretched, pulled back, stuck tighter. I tried to burn it, and the smell it gave off was nauseating—a mix of rubber and scorched flesh.  
  
Nothing worked.  
  
Now it doesn’t look like clothing at all: it looks like a living tattoo, crawling across my skin. I feel a constant tingling, tiny needles beneath my dermis, as if my nerves were threads the fabric wanted to sew itself with. It’s getting harder to move. I can barely write these lines.

Day 7  
I don’t have much time left. I can hardly breathe. I wish I had listened to the old goblin… or to my father, when he told me not to pick up other people’s trash.

# Postscript

Lilian’s neighbors alerted the police after a nauseating smell filled the hallway. They claimed they had seen, days earlier, an old man leaving her apartment with a dark bundle under his arm.  
  
When officers entered, they found Lilian slumped over her desk, a pen clenched in her hand and an unreadable journal filled with warped scribbles. The report listed pneumonia as the cause of death.  
  
But the autopsy told a different story: her lungs were packed with a thick substance, a color impossible to name—somewhere between deep garnet red and lung-purple.

# Final Entry

After that dream, I spent weeks feverish, with a cold that wouldn’t end. The sensation of suffocation repeats every night. Since then, I can’t stand that impossible color—it shows up in every shadow, in every memory.  
  
I think I need to sleep now, my dear diary. Until my next nightmare…
