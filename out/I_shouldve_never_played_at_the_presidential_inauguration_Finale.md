Part 6: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/H0UHJs36p1

We drove out of the train station, and back onto the road.

We figured we’d one shot the entire journey, instead of making constant stops, we did have a full gas tank, after all. And doing the math it’ll take us around 24 hours, so we will be sleepy, but at least we will make it back faster.

But staring out of the window, I saw some monsters, chasing after us. I shouted in fear as they’d seem to be rapidly approaching, so we drove faster. We knew we should lose them, so we took a turn in hopes of doing so, but after taking it, it fell dark immediately.

I wondered if this was just a bad dream, but checking my phone, it said it was still 12 PM, and it said the weather was supposed to be sunny, but ours was dark and gloomy, with it starting to rain.

I looked back again.

But I still saw two red eyes, chasing us faster than ever, and it seemed we would be consumed, by that-thing. But blinking again, It disappeared. However, continuing driving through the day was when the weather continued to get worse, this time thunder started, but my weather app still said it was sunny.

So I checked where we were, but there was no connection. “Strange” I thought to myself “didn’t I just have connection a second ago?” But my thoughts came to an end when I saw that monster now standing in front of our car, me and the others screamed.

Immediately, Ricky’s Uncle swerved off the road, and onto some path, where that monster continued to chase us. But fortunately we reached a fork and chose one path, while the monster went to the others. But due to this we were lost, as we continued to take random paths and roads for hours, until we finally saw our first stroke of good luck, a sign showing that the next major city was just a half mile away west. So we started driving that direction until we saw the city lights.

Although we couldn’t exactly one shot our way back today, we knew we had made significant progress in doing so, so we checked into a hotel for us to go to sleep. 

But I knew one of us should stay on lookout, just in case, so we offered to take turns doing so. But one day I was awakened in the middle of the night, by Morris, the person on lookout, and a loud knocking sound. We didn’t have any weapons to defend ourselves with, so we would be screwed if it was some killer. So we opened the door, trembling in fear.

I looked through the peephole, and it was two monsters, with glowing red eyes, with a huge smile, just staring at us, I screamed and ran.

I woke everyone up just as the door broke open. We had no choice, but to jump out of a window like an action movie. I already had to do this before, so I really didn’t want to do it again, but I mustered up the courage and saw everyone else jump out of the window, with the monsters entering. I was the last to jump out, and just as the monsters were about to catch me, I leaped out of the window, but I forgot I was on the 30th floor, and realized this:

I was going to die.

I’ve managed to evade death for so long on this journey, seeing many others die, and this was where my fate would arise, by jumping out of a window. So I closed my eyes, ready to awake in the afterlife, but I realized something, I realized that I watched a video before on how to survive a huge fall, and it was that I needed to speed my arms and legs out and move them, like I was flying, and aim for a tree while trying to land on my legs and roll. Fortunately I saw a tree, so I did what was needed just as I hit the tree.

I opened my eyes, thinking I was dead, but no. I was still awake and alive, but I didn’t know where the others were, so I got up, despite my legs being messed up, they weren’t broken. So I stumbled while I tried to find the others, until I saw a car come, the door opened and I started to sweat. 

“Am I gonna be kidnapped?” I thought to myself as a stranger stepped out of it. 

The stranger then grabbed me, and put me in his car, where I saw the others.

“I saw you guys had quite a fall, so I’ve decided to bring you on” The stranger said.

The stranger, whose name was Simon, introduced himself, and he asked what happened and why we were jumping out of a window.

We told him the story and why we needed to go home, he had a laugh saying monsters weren’t real, even though we encountered them, and then said that our city was only 1000 miles away, so it would take around 14 hours to go back. I was shocked “Did we drive that much?” I thought to myself. But we drove away from the hotel and back home.

Even though it was a few hours, it felt like a year. We drove through some of the least scenic places, and I was scared if those monsters would still show up. Also since my phone was broken from that fall, it didn’t even work. Even if it did, I’d probably loose connection.

Fortunately, there was no hiccups on the way back, as I saw the sun rise in the middle of nowhere, until I finally saw the signs leading back to our city, and we took the final turn back to our school. Where a huge celebration was waiting for us, as Simon called our school and informed we were coming soon. We got out of the car as my mom hugged me. We finally managed to make it back home!

After making it back, I went to my house, I haven’t seen it in a while. So I went into my room and took like the longest nap ever, but I was awaken by my phone ringing, even though I thought I broke it.

But the phone was somehow un cracked, and working. I checked it, and it was a selfie of Tom, with the caption saying:

“I’ll be back soon, Jonathan.” 

I also looked out the photo my mom took, and in the back, was Tom. 

I screamed, thinking Tom could still get me, but my mom came in laughing, she just edited a monster in my photo and replaced my phone with hers. After that, I had a good laugh, too. 

After that, I went downstairs and ate dinner before going to sleep again.
