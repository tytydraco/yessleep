I've seen a lot as a detective but nothing has been worse than what I saw when I caught him.

January, 1998. A quiet month for our small suburbian neigbourhood. Children roamed the culdesacs playing tag and baseball as I sat on the porch drinking coffee and watching my son play with his best friends.

I was called to work about an ongoing investigation of the murder of a woman called Vanessa Black. She was found decapitated in the alley of a vinyl store. Back then, my neighbourhood didn't use camera's very much because robberies were extremely rare. This was the worst murder case I had seen. I almost vomited seeing it. 

We issued a warning to stay indoors and a curfew for minors was set so no others would die to this person. We had no leads and there was little to no evidence of who did this murder. This case was practically unsolvable which really hurt me.

February 12th, another murder victim was found.
Both autopsies showed that the two were drugged then murdered. This relation gave up the fact that the perpetrator was the same for the two. The same drug the same death. Decapitation. 

An investigation was held with the state of Colorado. The people were shocked, our neighbourhood has had little to no murders in the past 10 years. This was unusual. But besides that we knew that if we were going to find this guy, we'd have to find out where he was going to find these girls.

The relatives of both girls said that they went to the same club around a mile out of town. We investigated and I was chosen to be..


The bait.


March 27th, 1998.


"What can I do for you?"
"Just get me a small glass of water"
I looked around for any suspicious people but this one person caught my eye.
Tall, brown hair, green eyes, a little dirty.
"Hey! Do you usually go here?" I asked.
"Yeah, this is my usual club spot, whats a pretty lady like you doing here tonight? Why dont I buy you something?" He asked me.
A total creep.
"Sure! I'll take anything."
We had a nice chat after that talking about the stars But then.

"Have you heard anything about those recent murders of those two girls?"
His eyes had a look of shock and distraught.
"N-no not at all. Why would you think that?"
"I don't know thats my bad." I said sorrowfully.


The night continued on
"Lets go to my place after this"
"Sure! I'd love to." I said with fear.
I called for backup to meet me there but to be discrete.


His keys jingled as he opened his nice comfy loft.
"It's nic- woah.." A whiff of disgusting smell came upon me. It smelt like a septic tank.
"It smells strange in here" I said holding back my gag.
"Sorry, I think theres mold growing somewhere that I can't find! Can you help me?"
"Sure of course.." My suspicion grew with every word he said. That was when I found out the smell was coming from his room. I walked back down to see him standing in the kitchen moving things around. I turned the lights on and see him trying to hide something from me. 
"What are you hiding?"
"You're not a fed are you?"
"Of course I am not!" I said in the worst acting possible.
"I have some weed on me, do you want some?"
Boom.

"I dont know, ive never tried it."
"Just try it!" He started to get irritated.
"I said I don't want any!" 
"Just fucking try it!"
"NO!" I yelled at the top of my lungs. 
He grabbed a knife from his counter top and ran at me.
I had no choice but to shoot him dead right there.
As I stared at his lifeless body I called them in and told them to do a full search of the house.

They found 3 bodies of victims we didn't know died. They were missing for 2 months. When I walked up to the crime scene I was shocked at what I saw. The most disgusting thing I have ever seen in my entire life. There were 3 bodies. One skinned completely, one with no teeth, nails and legs bent backwards. And one with a mutilated face and opened up torso.

I cried when I got home for the first time in a week. I cried for hours and when I slept all I dreamt about was him and those bodies. I couldn't believe my eyes. I needed years of therapy to get rid of those thoughts.


But atleast I can say I caught an American serial killer.
