The day seemed normal enough.  A little overcast and some drizzle but nothing unusual for this time of year.  Woke up, showered, went to school, played some SNES until dinner.  Dad was at work like usual while mom and I watched TV in the living room.

Darkness had long since closed in and the drizzle  had turned to rain, with scattered thunder interupting the shows and commercials.  Oh how I hated commercials,  but at least my mom didn't switch shows every commercial and stay until that show went onto its commercial.  So many partially watched shows.

"Time for bed" said my mother.  I had an early bed time for a teen at 9pm.  At least I thought so since my friends got to stay up later.  Knowing that arguing was pointless I said goodnight and headed toward the bathroom to brush teeth before bed.  Using the light from the TV I made my way carefully as we were watching in the dark.

I was crossing the dark living room after leaving the family room with my mom when I got the feeling.  A chill that runs through your body when you know something isn't right.  I looked to the right, staring across the dark room when I saw it.  Through the open curtain of the sliding door leading to the back yard sat a Rottweiler.   Maybe a foot from the door...just sitting, staring at me,  seemingly waiting patiently. 

With the false bravado of a teen boy I crossed the room and stared at the Rottweiler.  I glanced at the latch on the sliding door as light from a strike in the distance illuminated the room a little.  I don't know what came over me but I spoke to the dog.  Faint moonlight causing the wet ground to glisten around it as still it sat patiently staring at me.   "Can't get in now can you bitch" as a smile crept across my lips as I showed this dog that frightened me earlier I wasn't afraid,  or at least trying to convince myself. 

It looks at me still, dark eyes unblinking in the rain.  For the first time it broke its gaze and looked at the handle of the door.  Looked back at me as a smile crept up its face and my smile faded.  I heard a click as the latch unlocked.  The sound of the door sliding on the rails as it slowly, ever so slowly it seemed, crept open.  After about 3 inches it spoke while smiling that toothy smile.  "Nothing can keep me out" as the door opened slightly further.  It's eyes began to slowly take on a dull red glow.  I cannot relay what it spoke next because I don't know.  It was not a human language, of that I am sure.  I heard it, but to say I didn't understand it would be incorrect.   I felt it, I knew it.  It cut through me and I was filled with dread.  Terror like I had never known before or since.  As it laughed I just wanted to get away.  But my body wouldn't obey, and deep down I knew running would be futile.  I closed my eyes to accept the inevitable.   Deep chuckling making its way inside.  Then silence. 

I woke in my bed.  Engulfed in darkness.   Unable to move still, I waited alone in the dark trying to figure out what had happened and how I got there.  And the...whatever it was.  I finally regained control of my body and left my room.  50 feet or so away, past the darkness of the family room was the glow of the TV and my mom's legs hanging off the edge of the couch. I slowly walked into the darkness of the family room.  That familiar chill appearing once again as I forced myself to look out the sliding glass door.  A sigh of relief as no sign of whatever was out there.  Lightning struck and the darkness fled for a moment. The door was closed thank goodness, but the latch.  The latch was unlocked.  I rushed to the door and went to latch it.  I was wrong.   The door was not open exactly but not fully closed.

I tried to recount the event as accurately as I can remember.  I can still remember that night fairly clearly after 30 years or so.  It was the first of many unusual experiences in that house.  I am just thankful that none of them involved...whatever it was again.  I still feel that language.   And a small part of me is scared to admit that  on some level,  I want to understand it.
