I had an experience recently that changed my life. I have no one in the world and I just hope that someone out there will see this and not feel like the only person in a sea of empty like I have. 

I was always a lonely person- not in a way that causes me to be depressed or anything. I enjoy the solitude. I was an only child and have always been used to being alone. After mom and dad died, I was well and truly alone at just 25. That was when the depression set in.

My folks had an ocean side villa off the coast of the Outer Banks. Like me, the chipped, wooden structure on stilts just yards from the crashing waves of the Atlantic down a secluded road, was just as lonely and after everything that had happened in the last year since losing them, I decided me and the house could just be lonely together. I had never been there before, but my parents told the most beautiful, romantic stories of their weekend getaways to their own little slice of the sea. 

I packed for a week, but I darkly wondered if I would even come back. Shaking that thought from my mind, I finished up and hopped into my beat up old Range Rover. 

If you don’t know the history of the area of the Outer Banks, I’m not the one to ask about the specifics. My dad used to tell me about pirates- like Blackbeard- who crashed off the coast of Diamond Shoals not far from the villa. He told me about civil war stories and sailors and I always had a fascination with the sea, even though I had never gotten to go there. I didn’t even know about the villa until they died and I was willed it along with everything else they ever owned. I should have been happy. I would take them back in a heartbeat.

After several hours of driving down a long coastal road, pausing occasionally as beach goers would amble across the street to the beach dragging their beach bags and screaming toddlers, the crowds thinned into non existence.I approached the entrance to the road that would lead to the villa. It couldn’t be seen from the road due to the overgrowth of willow and palm but once my Rover made it through the trees (I’d have to find some tools here to clean up, I guess) I saw it. 

It looked like something out of a Nicolas Sparks novel. A solitary home faced the spitting, sloshing sea- paint chipped by years of exposure to wind and salt. The drive turned to sand and I stopped just before the underside of the house swallowed my car. I got out and looked up, cupping my hand over my eyes to block out the sun. Underneath the home, on the planks that made up the floor above, was a scratched message that made my throat close up and my eyes water.

Michael Stark loves Elena Stark

I sniffled and placed my hand over the heart. I didn’t really grieve my parents. It felt way too final. I figure if I grieve they will be well and truly dead. I don’t believe in spirits or whatever so I knew they were gone, but I just…I didn’t want them to be. My doctor said it was super unhealthy but I just couldn’t. I couldn’t be the only one left. 

I wiped my eyes and turned away, walking up the long staircase up to the door. I turned the key and as soon as I walked in I could see my mother there- in the pictures on the walls, in the curtains hanging over the windows, in the cleanliness of the small living space and the smell of warm sun and sea salt. She always smelled like that. She loved the sea.

Before the wave could hit me again, I quickly unpacked and changed into my bathing suit and shorts. I was thankful no one else was around. I was pasty, slightly overweight for my 5’1 frame and extraordinarily ordinary looking. My mother was so beautiful- a dark haired, dark skinned Spaniard who met my father while he was deployed in Spain many years before I was born. Their love story was one that always amazed me wasn’t made up. I definitely took after my father. He was a red-haired, blue eyed man who could not keep a tan to save his life but God, my mother loved him. He was a Navy captain who retired not long before he died. I felt sick thinking about how he would never get to sail around the coastlines like he and Mom wanted. They were planning it all out up until the very day. 

Speaking of which, I thought to myself, I walked over to the window and looked around, finally spotting the awning underneath which was grounded a prized possession of my father’s.

The Bella Elena

I walked out into the sand and ducked underneath the awning, running my hand over the hull of a beautiful, clean sailboat that my father spent years studying, waxing, painting and repairing to ready her for the long journey around the Americas. I closed my eyes and let the wind and salt sea smell fill my senses. I understood why they fell in love over and over in this place. It was truly magical. 

As the sun disappeared below the waves that evening, I felt like getting back out. The house made some strange noises, but I figured it was the wind moving through the boards. A soft moan echoing like a song from beneath the floors. I grabbed a flashlight and chair and walked down the steps, the sand crunching between my skin and the wood of the steps. The sand was cooled off after the baking sun and gone to bed and I felt a little chilly. The fire pit on the beach was a welcome sight and I was happy to see it was dry. 

As the fire crackled to life and the wind caught the embers to feed it, I sat back in my chair and looked up. There was almost no light pollution around me and the heavens were dancing with light and colors I had never noticed before living in Knoxville. I felt…peaceful. Like I could close my eyes and stay here forever. 

As I tilted my head toward the ocean to look at the full moon, it was the first time I saw her.

In the light of the moon, over the rippling waves of the sea, I could have sworn I saw the shape of a woman. The wind tossed her long hair and her dress to the left but she did not move. I blinked multiple times and looked away and looked back, but she was gone. I rolled my eyes and sat back in my chair. The quiet wasn’t good to me sometimes. 

“Get your shit together, Mia,” I mumbled to myself. I listened to the popping fire and the rushing sea and soon the woman on the water was far from my mind. 

As the sounds of the waking world faded away and my dreams took over, the sound of muffled thumping and screams crept in from the darkness. 

I woke the next morning slumped in my beach chair, unaware I had let myself fall asleep. The sun was just below the horizon and the cool air of the sea was kicking around the last smouldering embers and ash from the fire pit in front of me. I rubbed my eyes and felt the aching in my gut from the recurring nightmare I had just experienced. 

Out of the corner of my eye, after my sight readjusted, I saw her again. 

Just a bit closer, it seemed, she seemed to stand on the water like a strange mockery of Jesus Christ. I shook my head again and blinked, hoping it was just a trick of the light again like last night.

This time, she was still there. I couldn’t make out features, just the wind whipping long hair and a dress through the air, seemingly unaffected by the water beneath her. She seemed to be shrouded in darkness like a shadow.

“The fuck?” I stood up and walked toward the water’s edge, the chilly sea shocking my toes. I didn’t want to move in fear she would disappear before I could rationalize what she even was. I eventually had to blink away the salty air and when I did I slumped a little. She was gone again.

I looked around to see if there was any sign of the…thing…anywhere else around me. I wasn’t gonna say ‘woman’ or ‘ghost’ because neither of those things made any kind of logical sense. It had to have been a dolphin or something. I couldn’t have been seeing a real woman standing on the water. I shook my head and climbed back up the steps to the house. Maybe I could get a couple more hours of sleep before I got up to start work on the driveway. Maybe I could figure out the sailboat- Dad taught me as much as he could and I had his books. I just needed something to keep my mind busy. Being there was a lot harder than I thought it would be. 

The branches had already cut my face and hands several times and I cursed loudly as I accidentally tripped on a root and banged my knee. I wasn’t really the ‘manual labor’ type and was already a little gassed after a couple hours of clearing with the machete and hand saw I found under the awning with the sailboat. What I had done looked great so far, but there was so much more to go. Little bit at a time.

I wasn’t planning to sell the place. I could never. I wasn’t trying to make it look nice for a buyer. I wanted to make it nice for the ghosts that haunted my dreams at night. It’s what they would have wanted.

I just didn’t know how much longer I could do it. 

I paused and sat down, swallowing the lump in my throat and pressing my palms against my eyes, staving off the tears again. When would this stop hurting? Would it ever?

A crack of a stick in the distance caused me to jump a little. I looked straight through the trees toward the brush and trained my eyes and ears. Another little crack, and I stood slowly and walked toward the edge of the drive. 

“Hello?” I called quietly, my voice cracking with lack of use. A small whimper and the sound of increasing footsteps approached and I was ready with machete in hand to fight-

\-a puppy. 

It was a small, pitiful looking puppy. It looked hungry and scared, its little legs trembling beneath its body weight.

“Hello, there,” I said in a soft voice and knelt down. It cowered a little until I stuck out my hand. After a few confirmatory sniffs, it licked my fingers and I was able to pick him up, feeling its little ribs stretching the skin on its underbelly.

“Hello there, boy,” I looked to confirm the gender. “How did you get all the way out here?”

He whimpered and fought to lick at my nose but I held him back a little. I could see the fleas and a tick on him, but no collar. 

“You wanna eat something? You look like you haven’t eaten in a while,” I pulled him close to me and walked with him back to the house.

After the puppy was fed, watered and had a bath, I figured I’d go out later to the small town on the cape and pick up some flea and tick medicine for him. Guess I have a dog now, I laughed to myself. 

I took him to the vet and they told me he looked like a Jack Russell so I decided to name him Skip after the dog from the old Willie Morris novel. It was one of my favorites and he didn’t argue with the name. I would bring him back for shots in a couple weeks (I had kind of resigned myself to at least come back for his appointment even if I wasn’t here). It gave me a little bit of hope that maybe a little of the cloud in my mind would clear with my new little buddy. He and I cuddled on the couch and I read “The Ritual” while the sounds of the wind past through the house, a little moan of a sound slipping through the wood. 

It wasn’t the only sound I heard. Like the day before, the wind seemed to be…singing. Tonight, the wind was singing louder…no not louder...closer.

I closed my book and perked up my ears. Skip slept soundly in my lap.

It was a sad song, no real melody to it but almost like several melodies stitched together in pieces like a quilt. The song sounded as if it was coming from just beneath the floor.

Then I heard a light scratching. It was just under me right where the floor disappeared under the sofa. The sound of the song continued to fade in and out and the scratching had gotten louder, deeper…like something was trying to get through the floor.

I hopped up, Skip letting out a little whine when he lost the warm body beneath him. I ran quickly to the door, picking up the old rusty bat by the door. I wasn’t sure what I was planning to do with it, but I’d rather have something in my hand.

I stormed down the stairs and rounded the corner under the house, swinging off a stilt and pausing when I saw what was there. 

Nothing. There was no one there, no song. No sound at all. I looked under the house to where I heard the scratching and there were several deep gouges in the wood. I thought it was the only proof that I wasn’t crazy but I felt my toes sink into cold, wet sand. I looked down.

A wet puddle surrounded my feet. Footprints, larger than mine, embedded in the sand right where my own feet stood. I followed my eyes back toward the sea, seeing a trail of very similar footsteps in very similar puddles of water, leading directly into the sea. 

That was when I noticed something that made me shiver. 

There was no wind.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I didn’t sleep that night. I sat up holding Skip and staring at the floor above the spot I knew the deep scratches sat carved into the wood. I was trying to rationalize it all- some kind of animal like a buck or something must have come up and scratched the wood with its antlers, or a raccoon or something. I wasn’t even thinking about anything supernatural. I loved reading about those kinds of things and watching scary movies, but that kinda crap is just there for storytelling. I’m just losing my mind. That has to be all. 

Yeah…that’s all.

As the sun rose, I felt myself still unable to relax enough to sleep so I decided to go for a walk. The area around me was very old and very wild. While I didn’t really have to worry about things like bears or mountain lions or something, the turtles here are protected and I’m not wanting to go to jail for stepping on a nest, so I packed a flash light and put on my hiking shoes. Skip curled up on the sofa looking like a stuffed animal. I was quickly falling in love with that sweet dog. He was filling a huge void in my life. I would have to be sure to get him a collar in case he wanders off. He’s mine now.

The sky was a purple and orange painted canvas above me as I ventured off the drive into the wooded area. The smell of the sea wasn’t as strong here, being overpowered by the dank smell of wet dirt and fungus. Using my machete I trimmed back the more aggressive vines and added to the plethora of scrapes and scars on my arms when they refused to be taken down. After walking a little ways something caught my eye.

A small clearing ahead under a canopy of trees held a lush, green bed of  grass, setting it apart from the seaside flora that surrounded it. In this clearing lay 4 stone slabs, slightly tilted from time and the elements. 

It was a cemetery.

A family must have lived here at some point, I thought to myself. I walked forward and knelt down by the smallest grave. Though weathered, the etching on the stone was just visible.



Violet Genevive Blackwood

July 5, 1835 - November 4, 1835

Infant daughter



I felt a strong sense of sadness. This poor baby. Never even got to form memories of her family. Never learned to even speak. I stood and looked at the other grave next to it.



Solomon Charles Blackwood

August 1, 1827- November 4, 1835

Beloved Son



They died together. Another young child. A sibling.

I made my way over to the other two plots and looked down to the weathered stone bearing the father’s name.



Charleston Solomon Blackwood

December 5, 1794- November 4, 1835

Beloved Husband



Another November 4th death. Did this whole family suffer the same fate? My heart felt heavy for them. These strangers centuries separated from me had been taken away all at once and my heart broke for them. Finally, I looked to what I believed was the mother’s grave.



Juliette Toulousse-Blackwood

March 28, 1798- 



But there was no death date. I furrowed my brow. She didn’t die with her family? Was she buried somewhere else? Why was this stone here? I know families buy plots and prepare for death but…where was she?

A snap of a twig drew my gaze toward the back of the clearing. Surely, there weren’t more puppies. I couldn’t afford many more. 

This snap was a little heavier. Then another. Then quick, sprinting feet echoed over the leaves and I stood quickly, running back toward the road. I couldn’t see anything, but I had the overwhelming feeling that someone was with me and someone was chasing me. I almost made it to the drive way when I caught a root with my foot and tripped, slamming my belly and chest hard against a root system and losing my breath for a moment. I gasped and tried to pull  myself up, but my hands started to…sink.

I looked down and saw that water-sea water by the smell- was pooling up out of the ground and engulfing my hands, my knees and my feet. I glanced back and there she was- dark eyes boring holes into me as the darkness cloaked her. I staggered quickly to my feet, mud caking my hands, and took off toward the house. Once I was finally inside, I slammed and locked the door, gasping and clutching my ribs. 

What…the…fuck?

Too many things were happening in my mind all at once- the cemetery, the footsteps, the water… something is happening here. Something HAPPENED here. 

Skip cautiously hopped off the couch and ran over to sniff my wet feet and lick at the water. I wiped my hands on my jeans and picked him up.

“I found some creepy shit out there, little guy,” I kissed his nose and let him lick my cheek. “When you get bigger maybe you can come with me.”

He made a small sound in his belly that made me feel like he understood. I put him down and went to the shower to get cleaned up. The sun was fully out now and I decided after a shower I would try to take a nap on the couch before getting up and working on the drive way. I questioned whether or not I even wanted to go back outside today lest the strange…animal? Person? Whatever…chased me again. I decided while I washed the mud off myself and inspected my body for bruises or breaks that I would venture into the town again today and see what I could learn about anyone named Blackwood. Something horrible happened to this family for three of them to die together. What the hell happened to Juliette?

I curled up in my bed a while later, hearing Skip trying and failing to hop up with me. I laughed and picked him up. 

“You’re such a baby,” I kissed his head and pulled him close. Almost on instinct, he nestled into my chest and got still. Sleep took me, but not gently.

I was in a dark car. I knew it was a car because I could feel the leather beneath me, feel the vibration of the road. In front of me, the glow of the radio in an old Chevy Impala lit enough of the vehicle to see who was driving.

“Dad?”

My father was drumming his fingers on the steering wheel of his believed 1967 Chevy Impala. He had fully restored it several years before he died and it was his baby. If he wasn’t at the beach house working on the Bella Elena, he was buffing, tinkering or detailing this car. My mother was in the passenger seat, window down and wind blowing her beautiful, lavender-scented hair like a cape around her shoulders. 

“Mom? Dad?”

They didn’t turn around, simply singing along to “Me and Bobby McGee” on the radio. It was a dream. I sighed but I knew any moment I got with them now was precious. I leaned forward on the bench seat and rested my chin on my arms, looking between them and humming along to the radio. 

Suddenly, the tires screeched, a crunch of metal on metal and a feeling of free fall…

\-Splash-

My mother had tried to quickly roll up the window, but it was in vain. The car filled with icy water. Dad tried to help her get her seatbelt unbuckled but they were sinking fast- the heavy car and the windows down allowing the car to fill quickly.

“M-Michael-”

“It’s ok, Ellie…It’s ok…look at me,” he cupped her face and kissed her longingly. Tears stung my eyes. No…no not this again…

“Te amo, amor,” she choked. “I love you so much.”

“I love you, Elena. Hold on to me.”

I felt the water seeping into my mouth, sliding down my throat and into my belly. A cough against my will brought a wave of the icy sea into my lungs and I was suffocating. In the window, staring back in at me as I watched my mother and father die…was a woman in the water.

I sat up coughing and gagging, grasping for the sheets of the bed to find some kind of proof that I was not drowning. 

As the world settled around me, the tears fell silently as I dragged my knees up to my chest. Skip was curled up on the pillow beside me but my actions stirred him from sleep. He plopped over and lapped at my arm until I picked him up and held him close.

“I want them back, Skip,” I whispered into his fur. I knew he didn’t understand, but being able to say it out loud to some other living thing loosened the knot in my chest. I was just after lunch and I decided I would get myself together and go to town to see what I could learn about the Blackwood family. I knew I couldn’t take Skip because I didn’t have a collar or leash so I put down newspapers for him to use the bathroom on and made a note to get pet supplies and toys while I was in town as well. 

The town, Buxton, was a sleepy little ocean town that was about 20 minutes from my parents’ villa (I couldn’t get the hang of calling it mine just yet). I found a local book store and hoped the owners were the kind of typical small town book store proprietors who knew everything about the area. I was not so lucky. They had moved down from Maine after retirement and knew about as much as I did.

“Now, if you want local history,” the old man with the thick handlebar mustache and bald patch pointed toward the back section, “there’s a lot the last owners left behind for us to share. I think I have read about a Blackwood once or twice. Feel free to stay as long as you like, but we close at 5.”

I nodded and started from the first book on the shelf and slowly scanned along the row, looking for something to stand out to me.

Finally, a light in the dark. 

“The Life of a Lighthouse Man” by Charleston Blackwood.

I snatched the book off the shelf and flipped it open. It was something of a journal. Recordings of accounts from the early 19th century.  It had handwritten pages that had been worn with time. 

I looked at the front of the book to see if there was a picture but there was none. There was a notation, however, written on the inside cover by a man named Theodore Hinkley circa 1854. 

“The account written herein belongs to a dear old friend- Charleston Solomon Blackwood- who suffered a terrible fate along with his 2 small children on the eve of November 4, 1835. Posthumously, it has fallen to me to ensure his accounts are shared with the world as he wished them to be.

And to Juliette- I hope you found peace.”

My heart raced. They did die together…but not Juliette.

I checked for a price but found none. I figured I would ask up front. I kept looking for anything else that may lead me to the Blackwoods- cemetery records, old papers, anything, but there was nothing more to find. I reexamined the book and recalled it was about a lighthouse keeper…Charleston kept a lighthouse. I thumbed through the book to see if I could find the name of it- hopefully to find a book about lighthouses to find it in there.

Blackwood Bay Lighthouse. 

I searched through the books again and found a book on local lighthouses and in the index of an old, moldy looking one I found it- Blackwood Bay Lighthouse. I grabbed both books and decided to head out. I still had more errands to run and I was eager to get home.

“I didn’t see a price on this,” I showed the owner the journal I found. He slid his glasses on and squinted.

“Ooooh, this looks like  a first edition, dear. I don’t know what it was doing on the shelf but this is should to be display. I’m sorry, I cannot sell it. I can, however, ring up your other book if you're ready.”

I felt a gut punch as he placed the book to the side on the counter. My answers were in that book, I knew it. Something was going on at my parents’ house and I needed to know what happened to the Blackwood family. 

As I handed him the $20 for the book, I got an idea.

He gave me my change and I smiled and thanked him. I told him I wanted to go back and peak at something I saw that caught my attention and he smiled with a nod. 

When I saw him shuffle toward the back, I walked silently toward the front and swiped the book off the counter, making my steps light as I went. I stopped, sighed and tiptoed back, sliding 3 $20s on the counter. A first edition was likely worth more than $60 but it was all I could give. 

I slipped the book into the shopping bag with the other before making my way quickly toward the door. The bell sound followed me out and I let out a sigh of relief. I quickly ran to the local pet store, found a cute blue collar, harness and leash for Skip, puppy pads and a few little squeaky toys and a rope bone before heading back to the villa quickly, eager to learn what secrets Charleston Blackwood had for me.

The incessant squeaking of the penguin in a suit and top hat that Skip was attempting to violently maul with his baby teeth was setting my teeth on edge. He seemed happy though. I was flipping through the lighthouse book and I had found Blackwood Bay Lighthouse. 

“Blackwood Bay Lighthouse was founded in 1716 by Cornwall Blackwood, who owned the 198 acres of land surrounding it. Due to the high number of shipwrecks in the area surrounding Blackwood Bay, a lighthouse was suggested and constructed at the expense of Cornwall Blackwood himself, a proprietor of metalworks and supplies to the likes of famed pirate legend Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard. Blackbeard was captured in 1718 and beheaded by the Governor of Virginia. 

The lighthouse remained a beacon in the darkness to ships- merchant and pirate- for many years until a fire consumed and destroyed it in 1836. The cause of the fire is unknown to this day, as its keeper had passed one year previous and no other keeper was ever elected to the post. Since the loss of the Blackwood Bay Lighthouse, local legend says that the grieving wife of the previous keeper haunts the bay, befuddling the minds of ship captains to directing their ships away from the bay and haunting the waters around the bay-”

I looked up from the book, hearing a squeak that wasn’t the stupid penguin. It was the squeak of wood against wood. Skip was lying on the floor, gently nipping at the penguin’s foot. He wasn’t heavy enough to make that sound, surely. 

The floors creaked again, drawing my attention toward the short hallway that led to my bedroom. The lights were off at that end of the house and I strained my eyes to see if something may have been there, but I couldn’t see anything. 

Wind, I thought to myself. Just the wind.

I put the book aside and picked up the stolen copy of Charleston Blackwood’s journal. I felt horrible stealing it and considered taking it back after I had read it and figured everything out. 

The pages were worn and the ink that was used to write it was fading somewhat. When this guy said ‘first edition’ I think he meant ‘original’.

This was handwritten. This was Charleston Blackwood’s personal journal. 

I opened the book carefully, not wanting to damage the spine. The first page was legible and I settled down into the sofa and let myself escape into the world of Charleston Blackwood.



“May 5, 1828

Juliette, my love, brought my son to me at the lighthouse today. I wish I were home with them more than I am, but she is a patient and loving woman. It must be her French nature. I have never known the French to be harsh.

My Solomon is 2 years on and already has a fascination with the lighthouse. I have shown him how to light the beacon, how to sound the alarm in lieu of a storm, and I am certain if I were to fall ill he would be a worthy replacement for me. 

5 ships have passed through in the last fortnight and they seem legitimate. While my grandfather was willing to allow unsavory folk into port I will not be so lenient. I will not allow my family to consort with the likes of pirates.

This will conclude today’s account.

\-Charleston Blackwood”



Through the flowery language, I felt a sense of pride from Charleston. He had his morals and stood beside them. I could also feel his love for Juliette. I sure wish I knew what had happened to her. 

Another creek of the floorboards made me snap my head up toward the hall. I thought, for a moment, I saw a sheet of hair…and an eye peeking at me around the corner. I blinked away the vision and it was gone, but Skip, who had not been torn away from his toy the first time, was now staring intently at the hall, ears tense and body stiff.

“Skip?” I called to him. “Come here, baby.”

He hesitantly flopped over toward me and I picked him up, setting him in my lap and picking the book back up. I read the next few entries and they were not quite as interesting as the last. Mostly accounts of sailors he encountered, personal accounts of his son’s exploits and mischievous nature, his love for his Juliette… then around the year 1831, things took on a new tone.



“October 30, 1831

Something odd has been happening within the lighthouse.

I did the usual checks and perched myself atop the tower as usual last night and lit the beacon as always. After reaching the foot of the stairs, I was thrown into darkness. I hurried back up and found the coals had been doused with water. I searched the entire stairwell, the keeper’s quarters and the keeper’s office but nothing was found. I was alone. 

There was no rain or high waves to be noted. I shoveled out the coals and dried the basin with a cloth and filled it back up to relight the beacon. It kept. I am not sure what happened. I know I was the only one there, however the feeling of being watched never left me. Something unseen was standing just over my shoulder, I knew it. I will write to the proprietors tomorrow to open an inquiry, though I do not have faith that my questions will be answered. 

I hope tomorrow night I will sleep beside my Juliette. The second keeper is supposed to be here tomorrow and I long for her warm embrace now more than ever. I feel so cold.

\-Charleston Blackwood.”



From what I’m gathering, Blackwood’s grandfather founded this lighthouse, did dirty dealings with pirates and now something is…haunting his grandson? I sighed. It didn’t make sense, but of course, I’ve been experiencing some strange things for myself. I looked back up to the hall to ensure there was nothing there. The creaking had stopped but now the moaning of the wind through the floorboards had started again. I wasn’t sure if it was the wind or not, but I didn’t go check. I was locked in to Charleston Blackwood’s story.



“December 24, 1831

My dear Juliette brought Solomon and a feast up to the lighthouse to celebrate the birth of Christ. We dined together in merriment and I found myself happiest in that moment than I had in a long time. Whatever is plaguing this bay has dampened my spirit for months and the bright smile and lilting voice of my love brought me back to the Heaven I am living in here. The newest keeper disappeared on duty last week and since then, I have been staying at the quarters. His body has not yet been recovered from the sea, but it is assumed he was swept away by Mother Ocean in a fit of rage. She was wild that night and he was inexperienced. I told them he was not ready, however they prefer warm bodies to experienced hands.

I have not known a moment’s rest in this lighthouse since October. Something is here with me. How I wish I could speak to the last keeper again. While I am sure the proprietors’ investigation has turned up accurate accounts of what transpired, I have a different theory. Did he fall victim to whatever is watching the lighthouse with us?

I dare not mention this to Juliette. She is Catholic and will not hear of it. She will be throwing holy water on the walls and chanting prayers at me before I leave every day if she knows I have a sense that something is with me here. I will remain diligent and alert and strong in my faith in God. Through Him I will be protected.

\-Charleston Blackwood”



I started to read further, but I felt my body melt into the sofa, my eyes drifting closed. Skip’s soft breathing setting a rhythm for me and I felt myself drifting off again.

I found myself standing at the railing of a tall structure- a lighthouse. The wind was whipping around me, stinging cold water flicking my face as the waves crashed against the building below my feet. Stormy skies blinked with streaks of lightning and the rumble of thunder rolled across the sea to the shore. I looked around, trying to find someone to alert or ask about the storm, but no one was there. I ran down the stairs to the bottom to find a gruesome sight- a man hung limply from a rope attached to the long beam that ran across the ceiling of the small dining area. The room was splattered with blood and sea water and at his feet…

The babies…

The children…

Solomon, the older brother, lay at his father’s dangling feet, his throat cut from ear to ear, eyes grey and unfocused. He stared up at his father in a frozen state of fear.

And Violet…the small bundle of blankets in his arms that was soaked in blood. I reached down to pull back the blankets, hoping to find the child still alive, but all I found were more dead eyes.

I stumbled back out of the building into the whipping storm. Rain was falling like bullets and the wind moaned in a lament to the poor dead souls inside.

A scream- a broken, haunting scream- wrent the air and I looked to the sea where a woman stood on the shore, screaming to the sea in rage and grief. 

Juliette.

I sat up, awake, with tears falling freely down my face. It was still night and I was surrounded by the dark. The wind had knocked out my power and the lamp I was reading by was out. In the shadows, just at the end of the sofa, was a pure blackness in the shape of a thin, tall woman.

“What do you want!?” I screamed at it, feeling stupid for doing so afterward, but after a moment, the shadow was no longer there. I sat up quickly and wiped the sweat from my forehead. Though the wind was blowing outside, the air inside was still and stuffy. I checked my phone and saw a notification from the power company’s app. They were ‘working on the downed power line and the estimated time of restoration of power was 6:30 am.” It was 3:33. Great.

I lay back down and tried to go back to sleep but could not do it. I kept peaking up at the end of the sofa and at the edge of the hall, expecting to see the woman standing there. I didn’t want to believe that was what it truly was but Juliette…in my dream…looked so similar to the shadow of the woman…to the woman on the water. 

I decided to let my mind open up a little. Let’s just say, the woman on the water and the weird shadow I keep seeing are real. What the hell does that mean? Is Juliette a ghost? Doomed to haunt the bay forever because of what happened to her family? And what actually happened to her family? Who killed her husband and children? Was it the pirates? Was it Juliette herself? Surely not. She was described by Charleston as a loving soul. She would never harm her family…right?

I finally resigned to stay awake and I rummaged through the dark for a flashlight. I opened up the lighthouse book again and flipped back to the Blackwood Bay Lighthouse page. There was a small map in the corner that gave the coordinates of the former lighthouse. My stomach dropped. 

It was just a mile and a half walk through the woods off the driveway to the villa.

I sat for a moment and debated. Walking through the woods at night was stupid. Walking through the woods at night in a place that may or may not be haunted is more stupid.

I decided that whatever happens, happens. I needed to know where this place was and what happened to the Blackwoods. It was becoming an obsession. 

I packed a water bottle, a couple of granola bars and the books in a backpack and slipped back into my hiking shoes. I kissed Skip on the ear and he flicked it in his sleep. Hopefully, I would make it back to him unscathed. 

The moon was full that night and the water reflected it, creating a brighter environment for exploration. I had made a rough trail through toward the cemetery previously but the coordinates would take me past the cemetery a full mile and to the right. I walked past the Blackwood family cemetery and said a small prayer for the children and the father as I passed. I felt a presence with me at that moment. I prayed a second time that it was an owl or a fox.

I walked for almost 30 minutes, cutting away small obstacles and watching the ground for turtle nests. While I didn’t think they would be this far up, I wasn’t risking it.

Once I broke through the tree line and the sea was visible again, I looked to the book to point me toward the lighthouse. 

Where the lighthouse once stood was now a 15 or so foot high ruin. Around the base, there were bits of stone, charred to a dark grey or black. 

There had been a fire. I remembered that from the book. I approached the remaining shell of the base of the lighthouse. Looking in, I saw the burnt remains of the keeper’s office, the base of an old iron staircase that was twisted and broken after the first 7 steps. I looked down at the floor and noticed, under a thick layer of sand and ancient soot, was a dark stain caked into the wood. 

This was where they died. All three of them. 

An overwhelming sadness came over me as I looked around the room. There was nothing on the charred walls but one single singed photo in a half melted frame. I walked over and plucked it from the wall. A handsome man, about 30 or so, stood proudly outside a beautiful white stoned lighthouse. Next to him was a tall, olive-skinned woman with long flowing hair and a beautiful smile. 

This was them. I knew it. Charleston held himself high and though his handlebar mustache covered most of his mouth, his eyes said he was smiling. Juliette beamed with a womanly pride, standing strong beside her beloved husband and hooking his arm with hers. I felt a sad connection with them. These two looked so much like my mother and father. I passed a hand over the dirty frame and removed any debris I could to get a better look. The two looked so happy. What went wrong?

I felt like I had intruded on a sacred place. I turned and left the broken lighthouse but I kept the frame. Maybe I could somehow save the old, weathered picture. For some unknown reason, I felt like I owed it to them. 

Behind me, the entire walk back, I felt her eyes on me. They didn't feel like the warm, loving eyes from the photo. They felt cold and piercing. I'll find out what happened, Juliette. I'll discover what you did.
