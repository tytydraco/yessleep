My grandfather was always a bit eccentric. He was a collector of oddities and a firm believer in the supernatural. When he passed away, I inherited his old house and all the strange things he'd accumulated over the years. While cleaning out the attic, I found one of the first night vision cameras, and hidden beneath it, a dusty journal filled with entries about something he called the "Silverfish."

The Silverfish, as described by my grandfather, was a creature invisible to the naked eye. It resembled a giant silverfish but had a humanoid-like head. He wrote about how the creature would sneak into people's rooms at night and insert its mouthparts into the mouths of those who slept with their mouths open. The journal detailed every night this happened, and I couldn't help but feel a growing sense of dread as I read through it.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to set up the night vision camera in my bedroom to see if I could catch a glimpse of this so-called Silverfish. With the camera securely mounted and aimed at my bed, I hesitantly closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep.

The following morning, I awoke with an inexplicable sense of dread. I hurried to the camera and played back the footage from the previous night. The room appeared normal at first, but as I continued to watch, I noticed a faint, almost imperceptible movement in the darkness.

The creature, if it could even be called that, was unlike anything I had ever seen. It was as if the shadows themselves had come to life, twisting and undulating in a grotesque dance. And then, there it was - the Silverfish. It crawled slowly and deliberately toward my sleeping form, its long, spindly legs skittering across the floor.

I watched in horror as the creature approached my bed and extended its mouthparts toward my open mouth. Its movements were slow and deliberate, and it seemed to take great care not to wake me. The Silverfish appeared to be feeding on something, and I could only assume that it was siphoning something out of me.

As I continued to watch the footage, I noticed that the creature would occasionally stop feeding and simply watch me sleep. Its humanoid head would tilt slightly, as if it were studying me, and I couldn't shake the feeling that it was trying to communicate something. But what?

I've continued to record my sleep every night since then, and the Silverfish always returns. It's become an obsession, trying to understand what this creature wants and why it's chosen me. I started to experience unexplained fatigue and health issues, which I can only assume are related to its nightly visits.

As the weeks went by, my health continued to decline at an alarming rate. I became emaciated, my skin turned a sickly pale color, and my energy levels plummeted to the point where I could barely stand. I was a shell of my former self, and I knew that the Silverfish was responsible.

Each night, as the creature returned to feed, I could feel my life slipping away, my once vibrant spirit being drained by the mysterious entity.

I can't help myself. I feel an inexplicable connection to the creature. I know it's bad for me but I'm intimately linked now and there's no going back to how it was before. I urge you-- open your mouth tonight. Accept his mouthparts inside of you and know how beautiful life can really be.
