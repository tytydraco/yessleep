It began the night my cat vanished. The last time I saw my cat Tom; He had been sitting on the windowsill looking out from the window apartment on the 23^(rd) floor. Tom’s black fur was illuminated by the lights of fireworks that boomed across the sky to celebrate the new year. My other cat, Jerry had been curled up next to me as we rested on the couch. Jerry’s grey fur was soft and comforting as she purred lightly. I remember the glow of red digits from the alarm clock next to the couch, 12:03 am. I’d missed the new year celebrations, but all I needed was right here. I don’t recall when exactly I dozed off, only the gentle purrs of Jerry welcoming me into the sweet release of sleep. I never even got to say goodbye to Tom.

 

I don’t remember the dreams I had, but I’d awoken from my couch in a panic. It was morning, and I was late for work. Before I left I quickly poured a handful of food into both Tom and Jerry’s bowls. Jerry had bolted from her bed like a bullet as soon as I took the bag out of the cabinet. But Tom didn’t come. I thought nothing of it, assuming Tom had found himself a spot too hibernate in for the day per his morning routine. So, after both bowls where full, I left. The thought of Tom’s absence that morning itched at my mind the whole day, so when I came home I immediately called for him. But he never came. Jerry brushed against my leg lightly, hoping to be petted while ignorant to my growing panic. I searched through the house for any signs of Tom, every crevice of my apartment, every corner and under every piece of furniture. After everywhere was clear, the gravity of the situation finally dawned on me. Tom was gone.

 

 

I’d only seen my neighbours a couple times in the past, once when I’d moved in alongside a sprinkle of short interactions throughout the years. My apartment was at the right-hand side at the end of the hall. To the left of me was a couple with two kids. I could always hear the parents yelling the kid’s names all hours of the day when they wouldn’t do their chores. And directly across from my door was a sweet old lady who lived alone. When I’d moved in a few years back she had baked me an entire plate of cookies as a welcoming gift and would always leave cards through my letterbox when it was my birthday. I could always hear her TV echoing out into the hall, switching off at 10:22pm every night. 

I decided that if anything perhaps Tom had somehow gotten himself into either of the neighbouring apartments. But when I knocked on both doors to ask if they’d seen Tom, there was only silence from beyond. Yet when I put my ear to both doors I swore I could hear the muffled sound of hushed voices unintelligible through the door. I knocked and called on both doors, but nobody came. No-one came to the door of any of the several other apartments on my floor either. I don’t recall either tenants ever moving out, surely I’d have heard them. But in the end, I was alone with only hushed voices to accompany me. 

 

It'd been only a few days or so after Tom disappeared that it happened, the day ‘something else’ appeared in my apartment. I’d cried almost every day and every night for Tom, but when I came home late one night after a particularly busy day of work did I find it. A new cat, one I hadn’t seen before. They were sitting upon the windowsill I had last seen Tom on the night he vanished. This cat was large, far larger than Jerry who had taken it upon herself to lay next to the new cat as if she’d known it her whole life. The new cat had light brown fur and long ears; I’d seen exotic felines like it  on nature documentaries before, but I couldn’t place its exact species. When I’d walked through my door it stared at me with large eyes that seemed almost welcoming. I thought I’d been hallucinating in my grief after the loss of my cat, but this new cat’s fur was just real as Tom’s had ever been. It was so soft that I’d find myself spending entire hours just petting it. I was confused of course, afraid too. But the new cat made no move to attack, nor even hissed when I approached it. Only gazing at me with its large eyes.

 

I don’t know why I kept it. I knew something wasn’t right, yet I allowed this new cat into my life with open arms. It didn’t even need to be named either; all I did was pet it once and suddenly a simple name it had inscribed itself into my brain, “Plum”. Anytime I wished for their presence it was somehow always there, it *knew* when I needed it. Tom’s disappearance had left a hole in me, and this new cat helped fill it. It probably wasn’t even legal to own a cat like that in this part of the country, but I made sure not to tell anyone about it. I never even let anyone visit either, but it’s not as if I had many visitors to begin with. It seemed like Plum had already been trained too, they’d come when called, take baths when needed and eat when I filled their bowl. It was as if Tom had never left. They’d happily rest against me, let me pick them up (even though they were quite heavy) and even let me dress them up with whatever cat accessories and clothes I put on them. When I’d record or take pictures of Plum they’d relish in the presence of it, they’d bound around happily like a child. I’d always find Plum and Jerry curled up together on the washing machine enjoying its vibrations. Or often on the same windowsill I’d found them on initially. It was as if Tom had never even left. I was happy, Jerry was happy, and Plum was happy. 

 

Then things… changed. I don’t know when exactly they did, but ‘events’ began to occur for no explicable reason or cause over the course of a few years. It started with the priest, or at least that’s what he claimed to be. My door doesn’t have a peep hole, so I didn’t see exactly what he looked like at the time, and I knew better than to open the door to strangers. For all I know he could’ve been a priest. I never buzzed him into my apartment, nor even tell him about my name despite his frequent use of it. Every time he spoke through my door he would click his tongue or make a sound like he was calling a cat, the ‘wishwishwish’ or 'shshshshsh' sound most owners would use.

His voice sounded so calm, yet his words so delirious “The year of our saviour nears every day, Allison.”, “Allison, don’t listen to the cries beyond the walls”. I stopped responding after that, letting him continue his religious murmurings. I could see his silhouette under the door for the next twenty-three minutes, he muttered words I couldn’t decipher the entire time before turning to walk further down the hallway. This event on its own just seemed like a one off, I’ve dealt with strange Jehovah witness’ interactions in my past home before, so I’m used to odd religious ramblings. This was just another one of those, I hoped.

 

Then there was the meowing. I’d wake up suddenly to the sound of loud meows that echoed through my entire apartment. They didn’t come from Jerry or Plum, who both lay asleep on the chair in the corner of my bedroom. The meowing itself, while echoed, had sounded almost muffled, as if it had been coming from beyond the walls. I listened intently to it for the entire duration, however in what felt like an instant did it end as quick as it had started. It wouldn’t have concerned me too much at first since any of the other could have gotten their own cat even if I hadn’t heard any noise from the other apartments in over a year. But as I recounted the meows, I couldn’t help but notice how raspy it had been, and I knew I recognised it. It sounded like Tom. Cries from beyond the walls.

The next morning, I just chalked it up to me having dreamt it, as much as it hurt me to do so I was still grieving my missing cat. I’d checked every inch of my apartment and had already attempted to contact my neighbours but to no avail. The thought of Tom being trapped in one of my neighbours’ apartments drove me into a terrible panic, the thought that I couldn’t help him escape the locked doors and muffled voices of the other rooms hurt me. However, as I looked towards my windowsill, where the new cat sat, did their warm gaze help me forget about my worries. It helped me to calm down and slowly I did. Tom had been gone for about two years at this point, and now the Plum was here. Here for me. 

 

Another night did one of the last few strange occurrences over those few years happen. It was the night I had the dream. I never usually remember my dreams, yet every detail of every corner and every specific sight remain as clear in my mind as my own memories do.

I was standing in my bedroom which had somehow merged itself with the bathroom, and my cupboard no longer had doors and seemed to extend further than the light could reach. I walked… or more accurately glided into the front room where the window lay as an enormous glimpse into the world beyond. The landscape before my apartment block was no longer the city, but rather an endless world of golden grass upon a beautiful blue sky. The grass gleamed like a valley of coins and riches far greater than the mind could perceive. It was so beautiful, yet as my eyes focused did I begin to notice the things that littered the field. Corpses, a countless number of skeletal frames half sunken and covered by the flakes of grass that surrounded them. Each looking torn, limbs and skeletal parts strewn about in a frenzy as if each one had been ripped apart.

They didn’t look human. Some of the corpses where large, while others matched the size of dogs or cats. However further on in the fields did I notice people standing in the grass. One which appeared to be a man was ripping large pieces of grass up and throwing the shredded pieces over himself, his face full of joy as he danced in it. Another looked to be a young girl, she seemed to almost be in pain as she covered her ears in a desperate attempt to drown out a sound that I could not hear. Another just sat with both arms tied by what appeared to be some type of straight jacket. Those were the ones I noticed, but dozens more people littered the fields beyond. It was then I noticed something far beyond the horizon, the sun rising. However, when my eyes focused I realised what I saw wasn’t the sun. A billion limbs that dragged along the sky replacing the blue with a mesmerising pattern of everchanging shapes and colours. I felt my skin crawl as its presence filled me with such an unimaginable sense of dread I woke up almost immediately. I struggled sleeping for a few months after that, but it was only a dream. 

There was also the ‘mice’, this happened throughout the duration of my time with the new cat. While ninety nine percent of the time Plum was well behaved. Occasionally did I punish it when they’d act up, whether it be tearing up the place with scratch marks or the strange markings that seemed to appear on the walls. I would yell at them for this, and they’d hiss. Every hiss would reveal the huge sabre teeth that lined its mouth, I knew they wouldn’t hurt me, nor bite me. But it still bothered me, nonetheless. In the end, despite the cat seeming trained it was still a wild animal. Every time it acted out I’d find one of their ‘gifts’ placed at the foot of my bed. They’d give me mice as an apology, which on its own sounds normal for a cat. I’ve heard plenty of horror stories where owners find dead birds placed Infront of their door. But I swear not a single one of the mice it gave me ever had anything actually ‘inside’ them. They were just… skins of mice that it would place on the edge of my bed as an apology.

I would have convinced myself that Plum was the one that skinned them, perhaps tearing them open with those sabre teeth. However, one time when I went to touch one of the mice did it bolt up and jump away from my bed before seeming to be ‘swallowed’ by the wall it ran towards. It didn’t run through a mouse hole, it just, ‘shifted’ through the wall like a drop of water slipping into the ocean. I called an exterminator on some occasions, making sure to hide Plum when they would arrive, but the exterminator said they never found any signs of any mice infestations. But they did tell me I really needed to ask my neighbours to make less noise, it was hard to concentrate with how loud their footsteps and voices where. But I still only heard silence from the other apartments, I had no idea what the exterminator had been talking about. So, I double-checked and put my ears to each of the doors yet all I still heard was the same muffled muttering that I had heard long ago when I was searching for Tom. I just assumed the exterminator had been hearing the sounds of the city echoing through the apartment, so I didn’t bother much. And yes I did also get my hearing checked after this too, but nothing ended up being out of place. The new cat continued gifting me the mice, and I made sure to throw them out the window each time by their tails.

The final night feels like so long ago now. It’d been years since I’d had the new cat, and he’d become a core part of my life after Tom vanished. I’d already ordered several more accessories to try on the new cat for more photos. There was no build-up nor climax to what happened. It just… happened. Me, it and Jerry where a family. And that night was when that family had ended.

It was somewhere in 2022. I bolted awake, my entire bed drenched in a layer of sweat. My eyes darted towards where Jerry and Tom- Plum had usually slept, yet when my vision adjusted to the darkness of my room did I see the empty chair that sat in the corner. Just as soon as I had noticed their absence, did the meowing return. As muffled as I had heard it so long ago, yet it almost seemed weaker than it had before, far more tired. A desperate panic set in as another set of meowing joined it, even through the walls did I recognise Jerry’s cries alongside Tom’s. “Jerry? JERRY!” I cried before lunging from my bed towards the door as I entered the front room of my apartment. In my peripheral vision I could see the shape of Plum laying on the windowsill like they’d done so many times prior, but I didn’t care to look at it. Ever since this new cat had entered my life, things had felt so very wrong, I couldn’t shake the feeling that past its warm eyes did something bubble just beneath the surface, that somehow it was responsible. This was no longer a dream, and the reality of the situation became so clear.  I strained my ears to listen in on the direction of the meows, finding their source come from beyond the blank wall of my kitchen that lay perpendicular to the window. I pressed my ear against the wall, hearing the meows echo through it louder than I ever could before. “TOM!? JERRY?!” I yelled as tears streamed down my face as the meows grew louder.

I grabbed a hammer from under my sink that I’d bought after my encounter with the ‘priest’. I immediately began hammering the wall, bashing it in with as much force as I could muster. I made a hole big enough to fit my hands through and It was then I began to claw at the drywall, digging my fingernails into it until they bled, and my fingers ached. I pulled and pulled at the wall as chunks of it tore away in my grasp. As I looked into the hole I had created, it seemed to open up on the other end into the apartment next door. It was the apartment the couple and their kids had once lived in. The meows of my cats were as clear as ever. Beyond the hole was dark at first, yet when I focused on the other end of the opening all I could make out where the shapes of what looked to be dozens of bodies brushing past the hole in an almost silent dance, each person wore robes adorned with a stream of scratches and markings similar to the ones the new cat had clawed into the walls. From the level of where the hole was created I couldn’t see their faces, only their bodies as they continued to dance in circles passing the hole over and over again. It was only when one of the figures seemed to stop In front of the hole and crouch down did I see the ghastly rubber mask vaguely shaped to look like Plum upon on their face, alongside the cold bloodshot eyes that lay behind the diamond shape eyeholes. 

I fell backwards after seeing them. Quickly scrambling onto my feet as I sprinted towards the front door of my apartment. As I ran I glimpsed towards the windowsill where the cat with long ears sat, it’s face no longer adorned with the same warm look I had seen so long ago when it had first come into my life. Its eyes were no longer warm but adorned with a cold stare that only sent shivers down my spine. I knew the cat never had that many eyes, something had changed in it, Its body shifted larger than before bearing markings upon it's fur that now gleamed with a subtle crimson hue, but I didn’t care to stay one more second in that apartment. When I grabbed at the door handle it swung open immediately, its locks undone despite my vivid memory of having locked it when I arrived home earlier that night. But that didn’t matter anymore, I pulled it open and ran into the hallway.

Whatever had masked the sounds the exterminator spoke of was gone, I could finally hear what they had spoken of. The chanting was so loud and the footsteps like the sound of a hammer being bashed against my skull. The muffled talking I had heard before only a glimpse into the actual reality of the rampant chanting that filled the whole building. As I began to run forward down the hall did at once every single door of the hallway swing open at once, each in an instant becoming occupied with dozens of figures that seemed to pour out from the doors simultaneously. A flood of cloaked figures in the same masks filled the hallway with their presence. There were so many of them and they all continued chanting as loud as ever a strange hymn of worship, a song of joy. 

 

 

It began the night my cat vanished. Tom’s black fur had been illuminated by the lights of fireworks that boomed across the sky to celebrate the new year. My other cat, Jerry had been curled up next to me as we rested on the couch. Jerry’s grey fur was soft and comforting as she purred lightly. I remember the glow of red digits from the alarm clock next to the couch, 12:03 am. I’d missed the new year celebrations, but all I needed was right there. And now it was gone.

Plum sat next to me as I lay on the couch, their fur warm and soft like grass on a summer’s day. Each graze of its fuzz brought forth a deep sense of satisfaction. But each time my fingers made contact did clumps of my own skin tumble off them like wool. It hurt so very much, but I was content, and Plum was happy.
