[After Dad told me about Janice, ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qm83op/growing_up_there_was_one_room_we_werent_allowed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)I was careful not to even look at The Room. But no matter where I was, I couldn’t get past the feeling that I was being watched. 

The more I thought about that night, the more it seemed bizarre that I wasn’t able to simply push Janice off of me. Why had I frozen? Why hadn’t I fought back? Surely it wasn’t as bad as I remembered. She was a good thing for us, wasn’t she? But then, how could you call something that killed Mom a good thing?

But Dad insisted that she was.

I wasn’t sure what Janice had been trying to do to me, but I knew that it would have happened if Jonathan hadn’t saved me. I felt sick, embarrassed, and weak. I was an older brother, a *man*. What kind of man could have something like that happen to him? What kind of older brother relied on his kid brother to save him? 

For weeks after that, I barely talked to anyone. Dad acted like nothing happened. Jonathan cried at night, but I just couldn’t bring myself to comfort him. 

I was held back after classes more than once. One teacher even sent me to the counselor. Dad was called in for a conference. I’m not sure what he told the school, but it was probably something about me missing Mom, which wasn’t entirely untrue. 

I didn’t get better, but eventually everyone let it go. 

I think Dad thought that we could all pretend nothing ever happened. Jonathan would stop crying. I would go back to my talkative self. 

But then bad things started happening again.

We had just gotten home from school one day. I was sitting shotgun. Jonathan was in the backseat behind me. I had stepped out of the car and was grabbing my backpack from the floor when Jonathan shouted in surprised pain. 

“Agh! Ow! Ow! Ow!”

Dad and I ran over to him. “What happened?” I asked. “Are you okay?”

He was hyperventilating so bad that he could hardly speak. He gestured wildly at the car door and held out his hand. His middle and pointer fingers were already turning purple. “It… cl- closed… o- on its own!”

“No,” Dad said sternly. “It didn’t.”

A couple days later there was a tropical storm that knocked over the tree in our backyard. It fell smack down on the trampoline, destroying it completely.

Not long after, I started hearing deep groans of pain in the middle of the night. Sometimes they lasted until morning. Dad would drive us to school with bloodshot eyes.

One afternoon, Dad picked me up from school and told me that Jonathan had been taken to the ER a few hours earlier. During recess, he’d fallen off the monkey bars and split his head open. He had to get 25 stitches across his forehead, and the doctor said he’d probably have the scar forever. I silently began to cry, and Dad said nothing else.

When we got home, Jonathan was sitting on the couch watching Toy Story. I went and gave him a hug. “I’m sorry,” I whispered.

“It’s okay,” he said, so softly that I could hardly hear him.

Dad and I sat down on either side of Jonathan, but that feeling of someone watching me suddenly became so strong. I felt claustrophobic, like the walls were closing in on me and any second I was going to be squished into nothing.

I looked up and caught Dad staring at me with something like anger in his eyes. I got up and went to bed. 

Around 2:00 AM that night, I woke up to an unintelligible scream that quickly broke into silence. I rolled out of bed, softly opened my bedroom door, and walked out to the hallway. The light was on in The Room. I walked up to the door.

There were the soft creaks of the bed, and when I put my ear to the door, I heard Dad’s voice.

“Please,” he said. “Stop hurting us. I’ll do whatever you need me to. I’ll do anything.”

Janice’s raspy, wooden voice replied. “I miss when you were just a little boy. Full of energy. As curious as you were scared. Do you remember?”

I strained to hear, but the room seemed to be in complete silence. I pushed so hard against the door that it gave a soft creak. I stepped back and stood halfway between The Room and my bedroom until I heard Janice talking again. I put my ear back against the door.

“How old were you when you took over for your father?”

“I was… I must’ve been… 13.”

“And how old is Jake now, dear?”

“He’s 13.”

“Don’t you think it’s time that he takes on his rightful duty? Isn’t it time that he becomes a man?”

“You’re right,” Dad said. “It is about time, isn’t it?”

“Bring him to me.”

I ran to my room, closed the door, and jumped into bed. A few minutes later I heard the door to The Room close, and then there were footsteps coming down the hallway. Footsteps that stopped just outside of my room. I hid under the covers and closed my eyes tight. I was sure that any second Dad was going to barge into the room, rip me out of bed, and drag me to Janice. 

I thought I heard the door knob begin to turn, but the door never opened, and soon I heard Dad’s door close.

When Dad picked me up from school a few days later, I jumped into the passenger seat and looked in the back to see that the seats were empty.

“Where’s Jonathan?” I asked.

“Sick,” he said curtly, then gave me a sideways glance, as if to imply that it was my fault.

“What’s wrong with him?”

“Food poisoning.”

When we got home I followed Dad to my and Jonathan’s room. Jonathan was lying on the bottom bunk with a bucket on the floor in front of him. I watched as Dad felt Jonathan’s head with the back of his hand.

“Is he gonna be okay?” I asked.

“If he wasn't, don't you think I’d take him to the hospital?” 

“Yeah,” I said. “Sorry.”

“Well?” He stared at me until I left the room.

I sat on the couch until Dad came in. Then I walked into our room and stood in front of Jonathan.

“Are you okay?” I asked. 

He looked at me with something that might have been anger, or fear, or both. But then his eyes softened and he said, “Why do bad things keep happening to me?” He started to shake and sob. “What did I do wrong?”

“Nothing,” I told him. “It’s not your fault… it’s just… bad luck. Things will get better. I promise.”

I tried to think of something else to say. Something to make him feel better, or, selfishly, convince him that this wasn’t my fault. But when I opened my mouth to speak I realized I had nothing. Jonathan turned straight ahead and closed his eyes.

As I climbed into the top bunk, Jonathan threw up. I looked down to see his face pressed so deeply into the bucket that some of his vomit was bouncing back against him and onto the floor. He groaned in pain as it spewed out of him, and every time it seemed to slow, like he was about to be done, the vomit came out harder and more aggressive than before. 

The smell was rancid, like rotten milk. I could taste it. I had to fight to hold down puke of my own. I buried my face under the blanket and held my nose shut. 

A few minutes later, Dad came into the room, cleaned Jonathan up, and replaced the bucket. But not a half hour later the scene repeated itself. Then it happened again, and again, and again. 

Each time Jonathan sounded weaker. Once, he didn’t even have the strength to bend toward the bucket. He simply turned to his left and emptied his stomach onto the bed.

He sounded miserable. Even his groans came out weak, as if he didn’t have the strength to open his mouth all the way. “Please, please, please,” he whispered over and over. I said a silent prayer that he’d be okay. 

I must’ve fallen asleep at some point, because I woke up in the middle of the night to Dad turning on the light. I came out from under the covers to see him helping Jonathan out of the bed. 

“Where are you going?” I asked. 

“To the hospital,” Dad said, then turned his attention back to Jonathan. “They’ll fix you right up real quick.” 

“Okay,” Jonathan whispered.

“Alright,” I said, sitting up. “I’m coming.” 

“Nope. You stay here.”

“Why?” I shouted. “I need to be with him!”

“Don’t argue with me,” Dad snapped. “I don’t have time for this. Go to bed. No school tomorrow.” 

“I love you,” I said. And neither of them replied. 

I tried my best to fall asleep. I was exhausted and just wanted to forget about everything, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that Jonathan was going to die. 

I stared at my door and tossed and turned in bed for what felt like hours, until I heard the front door open. 

I waited for Dad and Jonathan to come back into the room. Being back so soon meant that Jonathan was fine. I thought that they probably gave him some medicine and that he’d be better in the morning. 

But it was only Dad who came into the room a few minutes later. He sat down on the bottom bunk and faced away from me. 

I waited for him to say something. When he didn’t, I asked, "Where's Jon? Is he okay?”

“He’s not doing well. In fact, the doctors seem to think he might be dying.”

“What?!” I shouted. “He just has food poisoning… you can’t die from food poisoning. What’s going on?!”

“I think he’ll be okay,” Dad said. “With your help.” 

“What?” I said. “What do you mean?” But I already knew.

“This is what men do,” he said. “They protect their family, no matter what. You’re a man now, aren’t you?”

“I—I can’t…”

“It’s a rite of passage. This is what our bloodline does.”

I didn’t want to go see Janice again. God knows I would have done anything else. But you have to understand that I loved Jonathan more than anything, and I trusted my dad with all of my heart. I still believed that he would never let anything truly awful happen to me. I was sure that he had a plan.

He held my hand as we walked to The Room. I was stiff and slow, but his grip was tight. He wasn’t quite dragging me, but we weren’t quite walking together either. It was clear that I couldn’t run, even if I wanted to.

He unlocked the door and suddenly I was stiff. I just stood there, staring into the room. I wasn’t close enough to see that far right corner, but I knew Janice was eagerly waiting. I imagined that slimy tongue licking her lips and dropping spittle down her pale, naked body.

“Let’s go,” Dad said. He took the first step into the room, and now he was dragging me.

“Please,” I said. “Please, no!”

“I won’t let anything happen to you,” Dad said.

When we were in the room and halfway to Janice’s bed, Dad stepped behind me and placed a hand on each of my shoulders. “It’s gonna be okay,” he said. “Just do what nature tells you to.”

He pushed me gently forward, and then his hands were no longer on my shoulders. My ears were filled with the sound of my own breathing. 

I didn’t realize Dad was leaving until I heard the door slam shut behind me. 

I turned and ran toward the door, but the lock clicked into place just as I grabbed the knob. I fell to the ground and started slamming my fists against the door.

“Dad!” I screamed. “Please!” He didn’t answer. He didn’t even fucking answer. He probably wasn’t even standing by the door anymore. He couldn’t even face what he was doing to me. 

I cried and cried. I don’t know for how long, but I cried until a voice came from behind me.

“Jakey, come here, dear.” Her voice was softer than normal, but moist with excitement.

I sobbed and screamed louder than ever. “No! No! Please! No!”

Her voice switched to a quick and raspy hiss, “I can kill him now, boy! Come here!”

“Please…”

She started to count down from 10, and by the time she hit 3 I was standing in front of her. She sat at the edge of the bed and smiled at me.

“Give me a hug, dear.”

I didn’t move, but I didn’t back away, either. 

She snatched me with her thin arms and pulled me into her. She fell backwards onto the bed so that both of our heads banged against the wall. Her legs wrapped tight around me, and I froze. 

She twisted until we were lying flat on the bed, my mouth against hers, her tongue was suddenly sharp and pronged, and pressed against my lips like fangs. She cut into me, and when I tried to scream she pushed inside me. 

It was wet. So wet. My mouth filled with her saliva. I was almost drowning. Forced to breathe through my nose until I was gagged by what smelled like rotting meat. 

I tried to break away, but her legs were wrapped so tightly around me that my ribs began to crack and shift.

She pulled her tongue out of my mouth and her face away from me. Spit fell down my chin and wet my shirt.

“Let it happen, my dear, it will go easier if you do.”

And so I did. As if acting on its own accord, her dress lifted up. Her stringy arms became impossibly long and pushed down on my pants.

I closed my eyes. My hips began to move as her body pressed up to mine. There was the wetness, and, when it was done, the feeling that I was filthy in such a way that I could never be clean again.

“*Good,*” she whispered in my ear. One sharp-nailed hand trailed down from the back of my head all the way to the small of my back, cutting me along the way and leaving what I later found to be a thin trail of blood across my body.

She let go of me, shifted until she was flat on her back, and went still.

She laid exactly as she had the first time I entered the room. For a moment, I could almost imagine that it hadn’t happened at all. But there were the bruises on my sides, the fluids dripping from my body, the soreness in my back and my legs when I stood.

I looked down at her. She seemed more content than before. Her thin line of a mouth raised in an almost smile. I vaguely thought of grabbing a pillow and smothering her. I know it wouldn’t have worked, but sometimes, when I look back at my time in that house, I wish I would have tried anyway.

I limped to the door and grabbed the knob, but of course it was still locked. Suddenly I was sure that Janice was going to get up and that the whole thing would start over. 

I screamed and banged on the door. I ran into it shoulder first. I clawed at it. I tried to put a hole in the wall. I tried pulling out the carpet and digging my way out.

By the time Dad opened the door, there was blood under my nails.

It didn’t happen immediately, but Jonathan started to get better after that. The doctors went from unsure if he was going to survive, to hopeful, to calling his survival a miracle. He was out of the hospital within a week, and I thought it was over.

But no, of course I wasn’t so lucky.

At least once a week, Dad would take me to Janice’s room and the events would play themselves out again and again. We never talked about it. He would just come to me in the middle of the night and tell me it was time.

I’d argue, but he’d tell me that it was the only way to keep the family safe. I would go into the room and be with Janice until she was through with me. Sometimes, I’d wait at the door for an hour before Dad would let me out. I guess he went far away so he didn’t have to hear me scream.

Sometimes I felt like a disgusting, useless slave. Other times I convinced myself that I was making a grand sacrifice, fulfilling a selfless duty. Either way, it didn’t get easier. 

I started to hate Dad. How could the man I trusted so fully for my entire life send me again and again to a torture so cruel that he, a grown man, could hardly stand it himself? He knew exactly what was happening to me. How could he send me in again and again? Was it worth it? Was there no other way?

I began to hate Jonathan too. How could I not? The way he accepted the little miracles day in and day out without question. The way I sacrificed my body and mind for him. I’m sure he had some idea of what was going on, even if he chose not to ask any questions

One day after dinner, after about a full year of time with Janice, Dad asked me to join him in his room. He said we needed to have a talk.

I sat down on his bed and he pulled up a chair in front of me. I could tell by the way he averted his gaze that, whatever this was, it was about Janice. 

“I got fired,” he said in a pleading voice, finally meeting my eyes.

“What do I have to do?” 

“Just… a couple more times a week,” he said. “Just until… well… until we can get back on our feet.”

That was the moment that the little respect I had left for my dad broke. It was one thing to use me to keep the family safe—a last resort, but to send me in there, to let her do those things to me… all for a favor? Was there no other option? 

I didn’t say any of this out loud of course. I felt numb, and I could already imagine myself far away from this place.

“Sure,” I said. “Whatever you need, Dad. Can we wait until tomorrow though?”

“Sure son,” he said. “I knew you’d understand.”

That night I played War with Jonathan on the floor of our bedroom. I think we laughed more than we ever had before. I let him rag on me when we won, and I gave it to him right back when I did. After Dad went to bed we snuck out to the living room and watched *Fox and the Hound* on our old little VHS player. 

That night, I laid in bed and waited until Jonathan fell asleep. Then, I packed all that I could fit in my little backpack, went outside, and began walking.

I didn’t have a destination in mind. I didn’t have a plan. I just knew that I couldn’t ever see my Dad again. 

I hitchhiked my way out of the city. I didn’t care which way I went, just that it was as far away from home as possible. For three days, I lived off the kindness of strangers. I slept only a few hours. Once in a truck on my way to Kansas City, and again on a slide in an elementary school playground. 

It was there that I woke up to a police officer nudging my back with his hand.

“What are you doing here?” he asked. “Why aren’t you at home?”

I tried to think of some lie to tell him, some way to get out of this without being sent back to that house. With Dad. With Janice. But when the words wouldn’t come to me he asked again, and then I found myself answering honestly.

“I’m not from here,” I said. “I ran away from home. Bad things were happening there. I can’t be there anymore.” I began to cry. I could see my brief escape coming to an end. “Please, don’t make me go back. I can’t go back!”

His eyes softened and his mouth opened slightly. “Hey, listen kid. It’s going to be okay. My job is to protect you. You know that, right?”

“Yes,” I said softly. “Please…”

He tried to get me to tell him where I was from, but I wouldn’t give him anything. He took me back to the station and brought me McDonald's. Another cop tried to get me to tell her my story, then another, and another.

I wouldn’t tell anyone, but eventually they found my dad anyway. Apparently, he fought hard to keep custody of me, but I refused to even go near him. In the end a judge got to decide what happened to me. That’s how I ended up in foster care. Eventually, I was adopted into a new family. 

They’re nice people. I have two older brothers, Paul and Hudson. I love them a lot, but I’ll never love them the same way that I loved Jonathan. Sometimes, I want to go see him again, but I know that I wouldn’t be able to stand it. Not after what I did to him.

My life has been pretty normal since I ran away, all things considered, but I’d be lying if I said that what happened didn’t affect me. Talking to people is hard for me, and trusting or opening up to them is even harder. I’m better with guys than I am with girls. Something about them intimidates me. Like they might tear me apart if I give them the slightest opening. 

I’ve had girlfriends, though they haven’t come easy. They don’t often understand why I’m uncomfortable with intimacy. 

I don’t like to tell people about my past with Janice. If I do, it’s placed under the disguise of a more believable version: an old aunt. 

One of my best friends laughed when I told him this version of the story. Another questioned how I wasn’t able to get away. “What, did she tie you up?” 

In class, we read stories about others who’ve had their own experiences with similar monsters. My classmates say that it’s not an experience that men can speak about. I don’t dare to correct them. 

My first girlfriend in college laughed and told me to “stop messing around” when I raised my hand as a victim during a talk about sexual assault. When she wanted to have sex for the first time and I told her no, she slapped me. Later that night, she took off her clothes and pushed me on the bed. When I started crying she hit me again and again. When I locked myself in the bathroom and turned the shower on so she couldn’t hear me crying, she screamed at me from behind the door. She told me that I wasn’t a real man. She said that no one would ever love me.

As I tried to sleep that night she masturbated next to me. I couldn’t help but hear the buzz of her vibrator as a hissing snake. 

And when we did finally have sex, all I could feel was a rigid body writhing against me, a mouth that was too wet pulling me in, and the feeling that everything I ever was was being swallowed—that the head of a snake was eating me alive. 

All the time I feel like I’m lying, turning myself into a fraudulent victim, even when I so vividly remember what happened.

I spend a lot of time thinking about Janice and Dad, but more than anyone, I think of Jonathan.

I like to think of him as he was—the little boy who was scared of the fire breathing dragon, the boy who touched the knob so that I wouldn’t have to.

I’d be a fool not to realize what I did to him. With me not there, I know that Janice had to take a new victim. Sometimes, when I go to sleep at night, I dream of Jonathan lying underneath her. He screams for help, but everyone has left him behind. 

I pray that Dad had the strength to stop Janice, to keep Jonathan safe, but I know first-hand [what kind of man he is.](https://www.reddit.com/user/ConnorIsaacWriter/comments/1poetct/thanks_for_reading/)
