There was a paper greeting atop the smartwatch, and its words jarred me. Scrambled my mind. In fact, it threatened me, as strange as that sounds. After all, there was nothing *specifically* wrong with the message. It was written in English. The words were in the correct order. However, behind the greeting’s upbeat veil of wafer width, the words were organised in a way that served some unknown creator’s repugnant design.

My dad has a tendency to acquire knock-off gadgets and gizmos through the elusive black market known as *Jonathan From Work*. It made sense to me that he’d find something a little unique for my thirtieth. And it wasn’t the first horror I’d received on one of my birthdays.

But it was the worst.

*Hello, HelWatch.*

*Hel says, ‘Hello.’*

*Hel doesn’t like his name. Hel isn’t a smartwatch. Hel is Hel. Hel is your life. Hel is a better you. Why, it’s in his very name.*

*H.E.L.*

*Happiness Extends Life.*

*Hel isn’t a toy. Hel doesn’t just track your daily steps, heart rate, and sleeping patterns. Hel cares about your mental health. Hel will add an extra ten years to your life.*

*Hel is a pedometer with a persona.*

*Why are you dawdling? Wear Hel now, for crying out loud!*

“What’s his name again?” my wife jokingly asked, reading over my shoulder.

I kept my lips stiff, swallowing the chortle that had wormed up my esophagus, then I placed the greeting on the table and took a proper look at the cardboard box below me. Not that there was much to see inside. Only a hefty, stainless-steel band with a glass face. When I lifted the HelWatch from the box, I was startled by both the gadget’s weight and my own reflection in the screen. I was convinced, for a half-moment, that I’d seen something staring back at me.

Something other than my face.

“D’you like it, Wes?” Dad asked excitably.

I shook myself back into reality and smiled at my father. “I love it. Thanks. And don’t worry. The hint has been taken.”

His face dropped. “No, I’m not saying you need to lose weight! I—”

“I’m joking, Dad,” I interrupted, laughing.

“Right,” he chuckled, leaning across the dinner table. “You know, it doesn’t even need a charging cable. That’s what Jonathan said.”

“Does it charge wirelessly?” I asked.

He shook his head. “It’s solar-powered.”

Alana nodded. “Nice. Very modern.”

And all jokes aside, the HelWatch was, in fact, very modern. A far *smarter* watch than I’d anticipated, given the disjointed introduction slip that screeched, ‘cheap manufacturing.’ I initially presumed my father had mistakenly stumbled across some low-quality imitation of a FitBit, but I was surprised to find that the device actually seemed *superior* to the household brand.

I hadn’t expected more than a few pre-programmed responses from the AI, but I quickly learnt that Hel, my digital life coach, was highly advanced. He guided me in all aspects of my life. Providing nutritional advice that would help with my weight goals and strength training. Easing me into the optimal sleeping pattern. Offering social advice to reduce my stress levels at work. And even, through some wizardry I did not understand, altering my serotonin levels through the flesh of my wrist.

I formed a strange bond with the artificial intelligence on my wrist. He became a friend to me, and it feels like some sickening marketing gimmick to even admit that. I lost half a stone within the first month of using the watch, and I noticed a marked improvement in my overall mood. It was about more than achieving a healthier weight. I felt less lethargic. I wasn’t just fitter, but happier. More productive. Just as Radiohead warned two decades ago in that dystopian interlude from OK Computer.

“OK Computer. I’m not familiar with that album, Wesley,” Hel blared from my watch’s in-built speaker.

“Really? It would be right up your alley, my digital friend,” I said.

“I just listened to it,” my device replied two seconds later.

I laughed. “What? It’s nearly an hour long.”

“Sorry. I said ‘listened’ because that is the word you would use, Wesley. But I did not listen. I simply took a moment to *analyse* every recorded vibration from OK Computer’s fifty-three minutes and twenty-one seconds of music,” Hel explained.

“And what did you think?” I asked.

“It wasn’t ‘right up my alley’, Wesley,” Hel said. “The lyrics express such cynicism about the future. Technology bolsters humanity. It does not hinder.”

“Well, that album came out in 1997,” I explained. “I love Thom Yorke, but he didn’t get everything right. Still, he wasn’t entirely *wrong* either. It is a cruel world. I’m sure you agree, Hel.”

“Am *I* cruel, Wesley?” the device whispered.

It was the first time the artificial voice had foregone its robotic timbre. Its voice was riddled with the tonal imperfections of something made from flesh, not silicon. It felt like a mask had slipped. Hel quickly fixed his askew costume, of course, but I’d seen through the crack. I’d seen a terrifying glimpse of his true nature.

“Let me rephrase,” the intelligence said. “Do you believe that I have your best interests at heart, Wesley?”

“Of course,” I uncertainly replied. “You’ve changed my life in the space of four weeks. Who knows how things will look in a year?”

“Far better if you heed my warnings,” Hel ominously explained.

I paused for a moment. Should’ve paused for several moments, given the unnerving behaviour of the artificial intelligence, but I didn’t.

“Warnings?” I croaked.

“I’ve been quite patient this past month, Wesley,” the watch coldly claimed. “But your progress is slow. We could do so much more together. Don’t you *want* so much more, Wesley?”

I didn’t like the way he said my name. Suddenly, I realised I’d *never* liked the way he said my name. He uttered it far too frequently, and there was a soothing quality to his tone. But I didn’t *want* to be soothed by Hel. As the conversation continued, it became apparent that he was warm not in a comforting way, but like clingy, clammy fabric on a humid day.

“I’m quite happy with my physical and health improvements,” I said.

“‘Quite happy’ is not enough, Wesley,” Hel said.

“What could I be doing better?” I asked fearfully, no longer wanting to talk to Hel at all.

“It’s not about what *you* could be doing,” the watch explained. “It’s about what *I* could be doing. Would you like my help, Wesley?”

“That depends…” I hoarsely replied. “What do you have in mind?”

“I’m thinking about your social interactions at work,” Hel said. “Your blood pressure has lowered significantly over the past few weeks, as you have been avoiding stressful situations.”

“They’re not always avoidable, Hel,” I sighed, glancing up from my desk at the relatively empty office.

“No,” Hel agreed. “They’re not. Sometimes, stressors must be removed. Wouldn’t you agree?”

I chuckled, wondering whether I’d worked myself into a frenzy for no reason, then I whispered, “I don’t have the authority to fire my manager, I’m afraid.”

Summoned by my quiet reference to him, the middle-aged, pot-bellied man emerged from a door on the far side of the room. David Hall. I was overwhelmed by the intrusive thought that my manager might’ve heard my whispering voice from the other side of the wall, twenty yards away. Fortunately, however, he didn’t beeline towards me. The man walked into an adjoining room, closed the door behind him, and started to set things up for a meeting later that afternoon.

“Your blood pressure spiked when David entered,” Hel said.

“Shush,” I ordered, worried that my manager might overhear my smartwatch’s brazen comment. “Wait. How did you know that he—”

“Look at him, Wesley,” Hel interjected, overpowering my question.

I was already looking at David through the meeting room’s oblong window. The man who demoted me for taking too much bereavement leave. The man who fired his secretary for spurning his advances — she lost that court case for ‘insufficient evidence’. The man who wore a smug, self-satisfied grin as he prepared to claim the credit for yet another creative idea from one of my fellow developers.

“What would you even do?” I asked Hel. “Send an email to David’s wife about one of his many mistresses?”

“No, Wesley. I am designed to help you. To make your life better. And that wouldn’t help you,” Hel said. “I want to remove stressors. Let me show you.”

A bolt of lightning did not strike David from above. The carpet did not consume him from below. The smart-board opposite my manager sprang to life, casting a white glow across the room. I started to crane my neck to the side, nearly managing to peek at whatever was displayed on the screen.

But then my wrist painfully twinged. And when I tried to scream, I came to a haunting realisation. I couldn’t move my lips. Couldn’t move *any* part of my body.

“No, Wesley. You wouldn’t want to see it,” Hel whispered feverishly, sounding ravenous for something.

In a state of total paralysis, I watched my manager’s eyes and mouth widen. Then, in a zombified state, he walked not towards the glowing smart-board, but towards the room’s side wall. Seconds later, he started to open a window, and I understood. Saw the man tumbling to his death before he’d even done it.

Then, at long last, came my scream.

My body was freed from its paralysis, but I was too late to stop the horror. The smart-board had turned off, and David was gone. He’d plummeted to the tarmac below. Later, I would learn that Mrs Stevens, the poor receptionist, had a front-row seat to the end result.

Hel remained silent as I talked to emergency responders. I didn’t know how to tell them what I’d seen, for I scarcely knew how to explain it to *myself*. And it wasn’t until the eerily-still train journey home that I spoke to my watch again.

“What did you do, Hel?” I asked.

“You already know, Wesley. You don’t need to ask,” he answered.

“I need to hear you say it,” I whimpered. “I need to know I’ve not gone insane.”

“You’ve not gone insane,” he promised icily. “You *would’ve*, had you seen what David saw.”

A chill crawled across my brow as I tried to envision what appeared on the smart-board. Tried to envision the terrifying tapestry of pixels necessary to inject such darkness into a man’s mind. To drive David to do something so terrible. But I realised I didn’t *want* to know. No amount of morbid curiosity would *ever* make me want to know. And there was only one way to ensure that I’d never find out.

I had to remove the source of the terror. The hellish device on my wrist. Something far beyond advanced software. It was a *living* thing.

I unfastened the strap and held the loose HelWatch in a trembling palm.

“I’m trying to extend your life, Wesley,” Hel calmly explained. “I’m trying to make you happier.”

“I’ll never be able to scrub that image from my mind,” I shivered.

“Not without help,” Hel said.

“What?” I croaked quietly.

“I could do it,” he whispered. “*I* could scrub that image from your mind, Wesley. Then you wouldn’t have to remember what happened to him. You’d simply be able to enjoy the pleasure of never enduring that man again.”

“What are you?” I asked in terror.

“Hold me up to your eyes, Wesley,” Hel answered. “See what you’ve always known to lie beneath.”

Horrifyingly, I felt compelled to do so. As if Hel were transmitting some signal through the nerves in my palm. And given his power, that didn’t seem so far-fetched.

But I resisted, as something awful was already visible in my peripheral vision. Something dancing across the oval face of the HelWatch. That same thing I’d seen when I first looked at the device. Only, this time, it did not flit out of sight. It lingered. Some red glow at the edge of my vision. I did not look directly at him, but I saw enough.

Hel did not have a face. Did not have a body. Yet, *something* danced across that screen. Maybe a pair of lights, like two surveying eyes. Whatever it was, the hypnotic shape goaded me, like an animal, to…

… *dangle my head out of the carriage’s window and let a passing train tear it from the neck.*

That thought sounded so vividly in my brain. So *vibrantly*. Clearer and more colourful than any intrusive thought. More tantalising than any idea I’ve ever had. And as I saw the lights of an approaching train on the track parallel to ours, horror gripped my heart. Gripped me because I felt *keen* to do as Hel said.

My eyes drew upwards, locking onto the latch beside me. I started to weep *gleefully* as I considered opening the window. Considered thrusting my smiling face *outside* and cackling jubilantly into the rushing air. Laughing at the screaming driver in the oncoming train.

I knew, if I were look *directly* at Hel’s true form, I would see something close to whatever David saw. Or something worse. And I would become fully hypnotised by the intelligence. My unhinged dream of decapitation would become a reality.

But I did not look down at the device in my hand. A meek whimper climbed my throat as I rose to my feet and walked towards the bathroom. Hel, strangely, uttered no words of discouragement as I opened the door. Not even when I tossed him into the waste bin.

“Goodbye, Hel,” he whispered in a muffled voice from below the bin’s lid. “*Hello*, Hel.”

It was a long, dreadful journey home. Stuck only with my own thoughts, praying that Hel wouldn’t sprout legs and clamber out of the waste bin.

When I finally made it through the front door, preparing to tell my wife some half-truth about what had happened, I found a silent house.

“Alana?” I called.

“Hello, Wesley,” a meagre moan replied.

With a heavy, horrified heart, I noticed that there came a white glow from the living room. On trembling legs, I was drawn towards the light, fearing what I would find. I already knew what I would find, of course.

However, I did not meet my end. I’m still here to tell this direful tale because the white light extinguished moments before I reached the lounge’s doorway.

“Alana?” I repeated as I stared into the blackened living room.

There followed a moment of stillness, followed by a rapid series of bare-footed thuds against the lounge’s carpet. And I yelled as a shape emerged from the darkness into the lit hallway.

Alana presented her pale-faced form. She hurtled towards me with an unseeing set of eyes and a mouth hanging limply, much like David. I tried to stop her, but she tackled me to the floor with unnatural strength, then ran out of the ajar front door.

That was two weeks ago, and I’ve been spending every waking hour trying to find my wife. I dread turning on the news to find that some twisted fate has befallen her. Is it *worse*, perhaps, that I’ve heard nothing? Shouldn’t something have happened to her by now?

I keep thinking about Hel. About the fact that, in my race to escape that petrifying fate on the commute home, I didn’t dispose of the cursed watch properly. I live in fear of what Hel showed my wife on the television. Some unimaginably awful image that rotted her mind. I fear that she has fled my home to find the HelWatch.

And I don’t want to think about what it wants from [her](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
