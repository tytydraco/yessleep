I appreciate the engagement on my last post. I didn’t expect that many people to care, honestly. It got me thinking that maybe I should keep writing these things down while I still can. If you haven’t read the last one, it might help. Or it might not. These stories don’t always like being told in order. Here’s the last post:

Now, as some of you already know, I’m homeless.

Some people pass me on the street without even glancing my way, like I’m just another crack in the sidewalk. Others make a point of not looking at me at all. I hear mothers tell their kids not to look me in the eyes. Which, to be fair, is solid advice. Some folks out here aren’t fully on this temporal plain, and eye contact can get weird fast.

Still, I’m human. I notice it. It stings more than people think.

Other folks get aggressive. They call me a bum, a vagrant, a tweaker, a thief. Most of the time it’s some version of “get a job.” Like that idea never occurred to me. 
Believe me, I’ve tried.

A lot of people out here try. That’s the part nobody wants to talk about. Most places don’t like hiring someone who can’t bathe regularly or keep clean clothes. You need IDs, social security cards, sometimes an address. Reliable transportation helps too. All things I used to have without thinking twice.

When you first become homeless, you think you’ve got time. You tell yourself you just need a little while to get back on your feet. Then your phone gets stolen. Then your ID disappears. Then the blankets from your tent. Then your tent. Eventually all you’ve got left is whatever fits in your pockets and whatever you can guard while you sleep.

Even fast food jobs are hard to land. Sometimes you get hired and work a few shifts. Then someone complains about the smell. Someone else swears they saw you using needles in the bathroom. Customers recognize you as the guy from the corner. Management gets nervous. Next thing you know, you’re back outside again.

That’s one of the reasons I keep moving. New towns. New faces. New chances. Sometimes that’s enough.

This happened when I was traveling from New York to Florida. I’d been hitchhiking and hopping trains for a couple days when I ended up in a small town in rural West Virginia. If you’ve never been there, it’s beautiful. Green everywhere. Hills that feel older than they should. Also some of the strangest people you’ll ever meet, even without the paranormal stuff.

What caught my attention right away was that there were no homeless people.Every town has at least one. Doesn’t matter how small. So when you see none, it usually means one of two things. Either the town ran them all off, or there’s a serial killer.

Not wanting to get stabbed a third time, I decided to leave.
I was walking toward the edge of town when a car pulled up next to me. A black Mercedes. Clean enough that it looked wrong out there. The window rolled down and a well dressed man smiled at me. No tie. Hair slicked back just enough to look intentional. His skin was pale, like he hadn’t seen the sun in years.He asked if I wanted a job.

I told him politely but firmly that I wasn’t in that line of work. He laughed and said it was just manual labor. Said he’d pay me well and give me a place to stay while the job was getting done. Normally I know better than to get into cars with strangers offering money. But hunger has a way of making bad ideas look reasonable. So I got in.

We drove for a while. Winding roads. Dense forest. The kind of drive where you start rehearsing what you’ll do if he pulls a gun. Eventually we stopped in a clearing.

There was a pit.

A massive hole dug straight down into the earth. Men hauled wheelbarrows full of dirt and rock up scaffolding that looked like it had been built in a hurry. The man handed me a pickaxe and a shovel like he was passing out pamphlets.

“Go meet the manager at the bottom,” he said.

The climb down the scaffolding took forever. Dirt turned to stone. The air got heavier the deeper I went. Men passed me hauling loads without saying much. Everyone smelled like sweat, old clothes, and something metallic underneath. 

By the time I reached the bottom, my legs were shaking.
The man in charge was small and crooked, hunched like something had bent him wrong years ago and never bothered fixing it. His teeth were bad. One eye didn’t quite line up with the other.

“Find yerself a crew,” he said. “They won’t wait.”

That’s when I noticed it.
Every man down there was homeless.

Same layered clothes. Same careful grip on their tools. Same look in their eyes. My body told me to leave right then. Everything in me said this was wrong. But the pay they’d promised rattled around in my head.

So I worked.

Day after day. Swinging the pick. Rock fighting back. Blisters forming. Dust sticking to sweat until I felt like part of the pit myself. At night we sat around a fire and made soup. Men told boring stories that went nowhere. Complaints about old jobs. Jokes that weren’t funny anymore.Some of them didn’t want to leave. I didn’t blame them.

About a week in, my pickaxe hit something solid.The sound that came after didn’t belong in the ground.

It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t violent. It was deep and slow, like a breath being taken somewhere far below us. I felt it in my teeth before I understood what I was hearing.
The ground shifted under my boots. That was enough.I dropped the pickaxe and ran.

I didn’t shout. Didn’t warn anyone. My body moved before my brain caught up, like something older than thought had decided for me.
The stairs felt longer on the way up. Every step burned. My shoulders screamed from days of swinging that pick. My hands shook so bad I missed the railing twice and almost went back down the hard way.Behind me, the sound came again.

A groan.

Not a roar. Not a scream. Just something massive rolling over in its sleep. The scaffolding trembled. Dust rained down. Men stopped working below. I heard confused voices. Someone laughed nervously. Someone else told them to keep digging.I didn’t look back.

By the time I reached the top, I stumbled out onto the dirt and dropped to my knees, gasping. The air felt thin, like I’d come up too fast from underwater.For a second, nothing happened.
The pit was still. Men moved around below like ants. No panic. No screaming.I almost laughed.Then I heard shouting.
I turned.

Down in the pit, a group of men had gathered near a rock wall. One of them knelt, pulling at iron links embedded in the stone. Chains scraped loose with a sound like teeth snapping.The manager pushed through the crowd.He stood straighter than I’d ever seen him. His hands shook as they dragged free a wooden case.
Old. Dark. Swollen. Wrapped in iron that felt more ceremonial than practical.When they opened it, I felt it.Pressure behind my eyes. Tightness in my chest. Like my body remembered something my mind didn’t want to.

Inside was a book.Not ancient in a clean way. Ancient in a wrong way. The cover was warped. The pages were thick and uneven, like they couldn’t agree on how long they’d been waiting.The manager laughed.Not relief. Not excitement.Joy.

He lifted the book and began reading out loud. The words didn’t echo. They sank. The stone around him seemed to lean in and listen.

For a moment, nothing happened.
Then the ground answered.
Cracks spidered across the rock. The pit walls shuddered. A sound like stone snapping filled the air, and water burst through the fractures as if the earth had been holding its breath for a thousand years and finally decided to spit it out.

At first it was only a stream. Then it became a rush. Then it became a rising, hungry thing.Men screamed and scrambled for the stairs. They slipped on wet rock. They climbed over each other. They grabbed at beams and ropes and hands.

And at the top of the pit, the man who hired me was waiting. Laughing. He kicked a man in the ribs and sent him back down. Then another. Like he was making sure the pit got its share.For one horrible second, I considered running and not looking back. I’m not proud of that. But fear does what it wants.

Then I saw a kid. Not a child, but young enough to still have hope in his face. He was clawing up the last few steps, eyes wide, reaching for the surface like it was a promise.The suited man raised his foot.

I didn’t think.

I ran and shoved him as hard as I could.

He wasn’t as heavy as I expected. He flailed when he went over, arms pinwheeling, still laughing like he couldn’t believe hr’d finally joined the fun. He fell into the pit he’d built and vanished into the rising water.I didn’t wait to see if he came back up.

I ran.

Not down the road. Not toward town. Straight into the trees.Branches tore at my face and arms. Roots caught my feet. I tripped and went down hard, then got up again without stopping. My lungs burned. My legs felt like they belonged to someone else.

Behind me, the forest shook.Not like an earthquake. More like something very large standing up after sitting too long.I ran until I couldn’t, and when I finally collapsed into a clearing, I saw it.

A massive shadow lifting out of the tree line. It was indescribable. Wings that didn’t move like wings. Tendrils moving like they were swimming through the sky. A shape that hurt my mind to look at. A giant form of absorbed body parts and chin is of meat. It looked more blurry the longer I stared at it. It rose over the forest and climbed into the sky, taking its place among the stars like it had always been there. Then it was gone.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t pray. I didn’t do anything dramatic.
I got up and walked back into town.

With the money I’d made in that pit, I bought a bus ticket to Florida so I could at least arrive somewhere with a little comfort and a little food in my stomach.
I fell asleep on the bus, rookie mistake.When I woke up, my money was gone.Everything I’d worked for was gone. Stolen, again. But I was in Florida, I had made it to my destination.

The next time you want to call someone a bum, or yell at them to get a job, try to put yourself there. Imagine what it takes just to make it through a week. Try to be compassionate.

I was in Florida for a while. Maybe I’ll tell a story from there next.
But this phone’s about to die, and I’ve learned not to make promises when the world’s full of things that don’t like being noticed.
If I don’t get captured by some ancient deity , I’ll post again.

For now, this has been another tale from a traveling hobo.
