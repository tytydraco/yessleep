Waiting until 1am to take my dog out to pee has to be one of my worst habits. After what happened last night, I’ll never take her out that late again



The walk was fine. Almost Peaceful. But when we got back inside, it was strange. The lobby felt heavy, like we weren’t the only ones there…

I’ve been staying at my grandma’s condo and almost everyone here is older than 70, so they’re all asleep , They love to chat during the day, so at night, I appreciate the silence. 



Maybe that’s why I waited to take her out. I love having the world to myself.

We make our way to the elevator. Third Floor please I mumbled to myself, showing how tired I really was.



The doors close, but we don’t move.

We just sat there, colder than it should’ve been but I didn’t think anything of it. Eventually the door opens back up.

I look out into the lobby but I don’t see anyone. 

I press the button again and the doors close for the second time.

We wait…

Eventually it slowly starts moving up.

As we pass the second floor me and Lucy both start slowly walking to the front of the elevator, it’s about 5 seconds to each floor so we take 5 little foot steps to the doors, but the elevator keeps moving, we pass the third floor, then the fourth. 

I press button 5 so we don’t go all the way to the top…and it opened.

A dimly lit lobby waits outside the elevator. Almost identical to my lobby But a giant 5 reminds me I’m on the wrong floor. They have the same nature painting we had, same carpet. nothing seemed off 



Until the doors started to close. That’s when I saw it…. A tall figure hiding in the corner. So tall that he hunched over to avoid touching the ceiling. He looked excited. Like I caught him waiting to pop out and yell SURPRISE. His shoulders tucked into his neck as his balled up fists coiled against him with excitement. I couldn’t see his eyes. They were hidden in shadow but his smile looked tired, like he’d been holding it like that for hours.

I feel Lucy staring at him too. Neither of us can move. 

Eventually the door closed.

I press the 3 button for the third time and try to pass that off as my imagination. Its late, I’m exhausted. 

The elevator finally starts moving down. Just as I started to doubt it’d open at my floor, it does. I breathe a sigh of relief. The nightmare is over. As I take my first step forward the elevator door SLAMS closed! So loud it had to wake someone up. Doors slowly opened back up. I take another step forward and Boom! It slammed closed again. It’s like a mouse trap, luckily Lucy didn’t try to run out. We’re so close. How are we going to get out of here? This time the doors never opened back up. The lights dim. I’m too frozen to push anymore buttons. I didn’t need to. 

All of a sudden the 6 button lit up as if it were pressed. Then it turned off. Then on, and off. It repeated that. It would flash flash flash and then rest. Flash flash flash. Then rest. I felt Lucy watching the flashes. Six Six Six….

The elevator started to move slowly downwards. The red glow from the button illuminates the elevator walls. Still flashing as we sank. Six Six Six. The swirls of the wooden panels start to look like distorted eyes. Watching us sink. We passed the fourth floor, my third floor and the rest,still flashing, six six six. It felt like we lowered forever. 

Eventually we stopped. 

The door slowly slid open.

A familiar lobby greeted us. A giant 3 suggested we were back on the third floor despite traveling downwards for minutes. 

I took a test step forward to make sure we weren’t going to get sandwiched by those massive steel doors. They stayed open.

I took the end of Lucy’s leash and tossed the handle through the doorway. It didn’t close.

We sprint out of the elevator, we probably ran faster than most Olympians. 

I turn left to enter our wing but the floor feels off. Slightly tiled to the right. At first I thought it was my imagination but I watch Lucy bump into walls, which she never does.

The floor feels spongy. Like they were just washed, but its way too late for that.

The hallway doesn’t seem to end. Like walking through the hallway in Peach’s castle in Mario 64. It feels like it goes on forever 

As I was turning my key something caught the corner of my eye. I thought it was a balloon up against the ceiling until it pulled away, around the corner. I’d been so focused on the floor that I didn’t realize I was being watched. 

The key wouldn’t fit into the lock, did the lock shrink? Is this my door? 

Somehow it slid its way in and we made our way inside.

I’ll never take her out this late again 

We go to bed.

As I’m laying in bed I almost convince myself this was all a wild dream. I’ve been watching too many movies. I could fall asleep right now if Lucy wasn’t breathing on my face. 

I went to push her off of me but then I heard her yelp in the room. Before I can open my eyes I hear a faint voice whisper “Surpriseee”
