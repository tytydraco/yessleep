Okay. So. I’ve been an instructor at my university for a couple years now while working towards a doctorate in philosophy—a subject that requires, if not some semblance of sanity, at least a general grasp on reality. I’ve spent most of my life surrounded by books, papers, and students, so I like to think I’ve always been somewhat grounded... until now.

It started about two months ago.

On a normal Tuesday, I walked into my classroom—Room 202, second floor of the building—same as always. I fixed the lights, logged into the computer, and prepared for my usual lecture. I have about twenty-six students in that class, and *as usual*, they all sat down, took out their notebooks, and started chatting before class was to begin.

I never thought anything of it when I left at the end of the session. I packed my things, logged out of the computer, walked out of the classroom, and went home. Just another day.

But the next morning, I came back to campus to find that something was…off. When I reached the second floor, I immediately noticed something strange. Room 202 was gone. The hallway didn’t look right. I checked the door numbers—Room 201, Room 203, but there was no Room 202.

Thinking I’d just missed it, I retraced my steps. Maybe the doors had been rearranged for some reason. But as I walked through the building, I realized something even stranger: none of the other rooms seemed to be in the right place either. The layout of the hallway was different, the walls a little too close together, and the windows at odd angles. I even checked my phone to confirm that my class was always scheduled on the second floor, but when I turned the corner, there was no Room 202.

I panicked, of course. I thought I’d somehow lost my bearings, maybe had a momentary lapse in memory. So, I took a deep breath, walked upstairs to my office, and told my office mate what happened. She stared at me like I had lost my mind, understandably.

“Room 202?” she asked. “But you’ve been in that room all semester.”

I followed her to the second floor, where, sure enough, Room 202 was right where it should’ve been. Everything was exactly as it always was. 

I tried to laugh it off. Maybe I was just tired, maybe I’d walked through a different part of the building without realizing it. It was a mistake. One of those things that makes you wonder if you’ve been working too hard. No big deal.

But then the same thing happened again the next week. And the week after that.

Every time I left the classroom at the end of a session, when I returned the next day, the layout of the building would change. Room 202 would be gone, and I’d have to walk around the building, retracing my steps, trying to figure out where it had moved. Every single time, my office mate would walk me down the hallway to show me that Room 202 was *there*, exactly where it was supposed to be. I’d stand there, dumbfounded, feeling the walls close in around me, wondering if I was going insane.

And the worst part? The students noticed.

One of them, a quiet girl, approached me after class one day. She’s the kind of student who blends into the background, so I didn’t think much of it at first when she asked if I was okay.

“You’ve been acting… different,” she said, her voice quiet but sharp in my memory. “You seem distracted lately. And you keep looking at the walls like they’re closing in on you.”

I remember laughing it off, telling her I was just tired. But her words stuck with me. Was I acting differently? Was I imagining things?

The days after that became harder to bear. I began to notice *small* inconsistencies at first—things that might be dismissed as simply a normal change or an overlooked detail. A poster on the wall that wasn’t there before, a mounted whiteboard that had been moved. Sometimes all the desks in the room would be moved to face the back wall when they are normally positioned to face the projector screen.

But then things began to escalate.

One day, I entered the classroom and the walls themselves were all wrong. The doors were set in different places. The windows…the windows had changed. I felt an immediate sense of vertigo, like I just wasn’t in the same room anymore. The layout was different, but the students were sitting in the same places as usual. They all looked confused, too.

"Professor?" One of them spoke up. “This… this isn’t where we were last time. Is this the wrong room?”

I stood there, unable to speak. My throat was dry. I wanted to say something, but I couldn’t form the words. Instead, I grabbed the door handle and stepped right back into the hallway, heart pounding. But when I turned back to look at the classroom, it was the same as always.

Room 202. No mistakes. No oddities. Just another day.

And yet, every time I left the room, the layout changed. I was sure of it.

I tried to ignore it. I couldn’t afford to lose my job, to let anyone know I was losing my mind. But every day it got worse. The rooms shifted when I wasn’t looking. Hallways got narrower. The angles of the doors became impossibly sharp. The windows looked into different spaces, into places I didn’t recognize. And the students… the students started whispering behind my back.

Then one day, I caught that same quiet girl standing near the back of the classroom, staring at the door. She wasn’t looking at me—she was looking at the door like it had suddenly grown eyes.

“Professor,” she said slowly, “are you sure this is *our* classroom?”

I went over to the door, and for the first time, I realized something that made my stomach drop: the door had no number on it. No label. No “Room 202.”

That’s when I lost it. I can’t explain what happened next, but I know it felt like my mind was unraveling, like something inside me snapped. I tried to leave the building, but the stairwell seemed endless. It looped back on itself, like a bad dream I couldn’t escape. The doors refused to open. 

I felt like I was trapped in a nightmare, with no way out.

It’s been a week since then, and I’m still here. Still teaching. The students are still taking their same seats, their faces blurring together. They sit, they listen, they ask questions, but I can’t shake the feeling that everything is wrong.

That the classroom isn’t where it should be.

And now…now I’m afraid to leave.

Because when I walk out, I’m terrified nothing will ever be where it should be again.
