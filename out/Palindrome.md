I’m writing out the transcript to the voicemail my brother left me before he disappeared. This is all I have left of him now and I’ve listened to this enough now to know he was telling the truth. Nothing in it makes any sense, and I don’t think it ever will. Please if any of this makes sense to you contact me. What you will read here is disturbing so please read with caution.

3:41:56 AM:

Hey Gav, it’s Pau…well obviously you know who it is. Something is wrong Gav. I don’t know what I’m looking at.

3:42:25 AM:

 *call loses background noise*

3:43:35 AM:

 *call regains background noise* Radar barks. Yeah, Gav, it’s Radar. I don’t know what the fuck I’m looking at Gav, God help me something is really wrong here. Radar, come!

3:44:44

*Paul puts the phone on speaker on the kitchen counter where it will remain until found by the police several hours later.

3:44:45

Gav, I hope to Christ you can still hear me. I let Radar out, and when he came back there were two of them! There are two dogs in my fucking kitchen Gavin. It’s not another dog, they're both Radar. They both have his spotted nose in the exact same fucking spot. Gavin, I swear to god I’m sober, I didn’t use again.

3:46:20

*noise makes Paul’s speech unintelligible*

3:46:26

*noise stops* …a fuck up, a real bad one Gavin, but I really am sober, and something is wrong. Radar, come here! They both…they both listened… if I try to call the police they’re gonna send me back Gavin, they’re not going to listen. I’m gonna take a picture so you can see Gav! They’re both just standing there…perfectly still. They’re identical Gav, down to the cut Radar got last week. How…how is this possible?

3:47:35 

*picture arrives in my inbox*

*unintelligible image of two blurry white objects*

3:47:38

Jesus fuck! They both ran out the doggy door Gav, I think I need to go after them. I can’t let Radar be out there alone… I don’t know what that is

3:48:00

*door slams shut*

3:48:02

Jesus Christ what the fuck is that, Radar run!

3:48:03

*faint exit doggy door noise of something leaving the property*

3:48:04

*Paul screams, while what the medical examiner described as “flesh tearing” in the background occurs.

3:48:10

*scream subsides*

3:50:00

*The doggy door swings open, and Radar barks.*

3:53:47

*Radar stops barking*

3:55:56

*Police sirens are heard in the distance*

3:58:47

“Mr. Retter! Please open the door this is *redacted* Sheriff Department. We’re responding to call of distress within the home. If you don’t open the door we’ll be forced to break in.

3:59:56

*Door falls to the ground*

4:01:30

Officer Riles: “Do you smell that? Rich? What the fuck is that smell?

Officer Grodes: “I’ve never smelled anything like that before…it’s coming from the doggy door.”

4:02:30

Officer Riles and Grode remark at the stench. One standout comment is that it doesn’t smell like “it came from this earth” from Officer Grodes.

4:03:45

More squad cars arrive at my brother's home.

4:45:54

Officer Riles: “He was a drug addict, he probably just lost his mind, he’s the one we caught on 67th a while back. Remember? Guy is a ducking basketcase. The whole family is fucked. He tripped the fuck out on whatever that fucking stench was in the garage and bolted when he heard the sirens. What do you wanna do with this dog? What kinda asshole bolts and leaves his dog?”

6:47:39

*Paul’s phone dies*

Now I sit with Radar at the police station. I’m sorry Paul, you were never a loser, never a failure. I miss you.
