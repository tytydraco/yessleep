I've always had dreams that are more of a surreal experience rather than any kind of theme or "storyline", and i'd like to mention I consider myself a rational science-based person, though recently i've had what i've heard reffered to as "premonition dreams" according to the research i've done. I don't really beleive in such a thing myself, but I would just like to get this post out there for mostly just myself for some closure or answers. In the last two years i've had two family members die, and my best friend had a family friend pass away.  Before my sister died due to medical malpractice, I had a dream, more of a nightmare really, in which my sister was outside my window. Though instead of her normal appearance she looked more like a bloated, Hills Have Eyes version of herself. The noises she made were like a extremely low guttural gurgling that was incredibly loud, very aggressive and it really made me terrified, I felt it in my bones. I couldn't tell if she was trying to break in or not, just loud noise and aggressive shaking. 

She would die a week later because some asshole dumbass surgeon had no idea what he was doing during her thyroid surgery. REALLY tempted to use his real name. Anyway, these disturbing dreams would happen a few more times, and the angry, bloated corpses of people I knew were just making an intense, low but loud gurgling noise that had the walls vibrating. The "ABC" of this fifteen-ish year old kid suddenly appeared sitting on my bed in one of these dreams, and because of "dream logic" I simply say "hey there" to which through a grossly swollen tounge he gurgled "my name is Austin", before my vision then swirled into hypnagogic flashes of my sister and late grandfather (who i've never met, but seen photos and videos) looking like they'd been in a river for weeks. I wake up and brush it off as coincidence and i'm still inclined to beleive it as such. I wanted to get my mind off this, but my buddy Ray hadn't been hanging out with me for a long time, and he only isolates like that when he's depressed so I text him "yo homie u free to hang out soon? miss ya"

A day goes by, and he tells me he's sorry for being so quiet, but that his cousin Austin had overdosed and died, and that he's been hanging out with his grandma and mom while they're going through the greif. Totally understandable. I didn't tell him about the dream I had. I'm not going to use some coincidental dream like some kind of "aint this trippy?" thing for his cousin's death. Seems insensitive. I've looked across the internet for similar dreams or experiences on various forums. Dream interpretations, psychology, psychiatry, paranormal forums, even though they didn't help at all. Basically they laughed me off because "why are you on a paranormal forum for answers if you don't beleive?" or some shit. Like i'm not allowed to look across the internet for various perspectives. I don't believe in "woo" or anything like that I guess i'm just posting this to see if anyone else has experienced anything similar, espescially the level of coincidence involved, it's absolutely exruciating.
