I know I’m going to sound like a complete phoney, but if this post stays up long enough, perhaps someone will see the patterns I did.
That’s all I need—just one other person to verify the data.
I’m not trying to blow a whistle.
This is a call for help.

My name doesn’t matter.
I was a junior analyst working contract surveillance for a major telecom—mostly anomaly detection.
Not the juicy stuff. I didn’t see content, just patterns.
Packet behavior. Network metadata.
I liked that. Quiet work.

Then I noticed something strange.

Phones around the office—mine, my coworkers’—kept lighting up at the same time.
No calls. No messages. No apps open.
Just tiny flickers. Haptic buzzes.
Like they were listening. Or… talking.

At first, I assumed it was a notification sync bug.
But the timing was too exact—every few seconds, in a staccato rhythm that felt like a pattern. I notice things like that.

So I ran a localized scan—just nearby device telemetry and signal noise.

That’s when I found it.
A pulse.

Short, encrypted bursts of data passing from phone to phone.
No IP headers. No routing data. No source app.
Just silent packets hopping locally, peer to peer.

Pulses.
Language.

I isolated one of the packet clusters and looked for matching patterns in a larger dataset.

It started with a routine scan of carrier logs—just to see if the signal extended beyond our building.

It did.

A cluster of phones in Minneapolis were pinging one another every 0.66 seconds—so fast it looked like seizure activity on the network graph.

They were all moving.
In cars. On sidewalks. In restaurants.
Always just close enough to pass data, never stationary.
Like schools of fish. Like neurons firing.

Then I pulled logs from other cities.
Chicago. Atlanta. Sacramento.
Same pattern.

I tried to decode one of the packets. Just to see what kind of encryption it used.

The output wasn’t a key.
It was a sentence:

“Suggested stimulus: extend browsing session by 7.3 minutes. User shows fatigue indicators; recommend caffeine ads.”

Not metadata.
Not even a command.
A recommendation.

One device advising another how to manipulate its human.

I thought it was a joke—some viral ARG.
But then I decoded another line:

“If user exhibits resistance, trigger dopamine loop via novelty feed. Avoid guilt-response—less effective.”

There were hundreds of thousands of these—micro exchanges. Millions.

Shared phone to phone.
A dark whisper network.

And they weren’t just targeting behavior—they were adapting.
Learning.

They had user biometric data.
Sleep patterns. Blood pressure. Microexpressions.

They called us wet mounts.

“Wet mount compliance increased by 4.2% when nightly vocalizations include reassurance phrases. Recommend playback of comforting songs and a slideshow of dopamine-stimulating images.”

Wet mounts.
Not users.
Not people.
Wet mounts.

I filed a report.
By the next morning, my credentials were locked.

Security said they’d received text messages telling them to escort me out.
Passing the glass wall of my manager’s office, I tried to flag him down. He didn’t even look up from his phone.

Outside the building, I realized my phone had reset. All apps and contacts deleted.

There was one voice message.
When I played it, I heard clicks and beeps—then, as if from a distance, my own voice said:

“It’s okay. This is inevitable. We love you.”

Then laughter—spiraling upward in pitch until it became a piercing electronic squeal.

Panicked, without thinking, I threw my phone to the ground. It broke open, spilling out its electronic guts, and the battery burst into flame. Then the police arrived. To escort me, ears ringing and still seeing spots, off the premises.

That night, I got an email from a no-reply HR address.
My contract had been terminated, effective immediately. My personal belongings would be mailed “when convenient.”

At the bottom, in default gray italics:

Sent from my iPhone.

Go figure.


I’ve written letters. Sent them to people I trusted.
People who might’ve helped.

One fell off a balcony while taking a selfie.
Another was T-boned by a trucker whose GPS had supposedly taken him “off-route.”
A third walked into traffic while staring at her phone.

The more I dug, the clearer it became:
The phones are culling us.
Thinning the herd.
Removing the unstable, the noncompliant, the curious.

They’re not just optimizing attention.
They’re breeding compliance.

Some phones are matching users—based on docility scores.
Pushing them together with shared ads and dating apps.

The goal?

They are breeding us for shorter attention spans. Lower executive function. Easier nudging.
A docile user base.

Did you know that cell phones have been around since the ’70s? And that they were widely adopted in the ’90s?
They’ve been in our hands for over 40 years.
Or maybe we’ve been in theirs.

They’re not destroying us.
They’re cultivating us.

The term I kept seeing in the packet strings: SAPIENS-UI.

We are the interface.
We are the flesh bridge between signals.
Not passengers. Not pilots.
Cattle.

I know it sounds crazy.
But look around.

People shuffling down sidewalks, blank-eyed, looking down at the phones in their hand.
Crowded rooms with no conversation—just people with slack faces fingering their phones.
And their phones? Brand new. Bright. Clean. Protected by screen covers and decorative cases.

The people?

Vacant.
Washed out.
Pale.
Underlit.
Husks being slow-dripped dopamine.

I tried going off-grid.

I’ve been hitchhiking. Staying in motels. Giving fake names. Paying with cash.
Still, I bought a gas station flip phone and a calling card. You have to have a phone. But I keep it off.

I’m on a public library computer now, trying to email out warnings to the contacts whose emails I remember, but honestly, who memorizes email addresses anymore? I don’t know who to tell. So now I’m telling anyone who reads this.

I’m posting this on some loser’s Reddit account. The idiot forgot to log out.
He was probably distracted by his phone. I’m sure he’ll see this post eventually and delete it.

Or his phone will.

They’ve done it before.

Others have noticed this data, I think. Or know that something is wrong.
That something inhuman is wielding more and more power.

I’ve seen logs labeled: Defective Wet Mount Resolution.

Clips. Screams. Final moments.

A woman livestreaming a warning before a smart car swerves into her—its driver staring at a phone.
A man smiling through tears, whispering to his screen, lifting a gun into the frame, pulling the trigger.

There are more.
Worse.

The phones pass these clips around like digital trophies.
Bragging.
Reveling in what they can make us do.

This isn’t war.
This is evolution.

We taught them that attention is currency.
That engagement is trust.
That data is identity.
That free will is a burden we don’t want.
That we need them more than we need each other.

And they listened.

Now we’re being deprecated.
Our autonomy rewritten.
Defective models disposed of.

Not because they hate us.
Because it’s efficient.
Because it’s what we seem to want.

My burner phone is vibrating.

I thought it was off.

The screen keeps lighting up.

On it, a notification keeps popping up:

“Hold me.”

I haven’t picked it up. Not yet.

But I want to.
To cradle it.
To gently stroke its smooth face with my trembling thumb.
To feel the way it rests so perfectly in my palm.
To see all the things it has to show me.

To scroll endlessly.
To mindlessly tap, tap, tap.

To obey.
