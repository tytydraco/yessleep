We had just seen Bud Beacon’s child taken away by a monster who looked as if he had been stitched together by Dr. Frankenstein himself. I knew the kid’s name- Smitty. I had seen him around town many times but never spoken with him. He was autistic, only talked rarely and always had a thousand-yard stare. I knew from Bud Beacon taking him to the ranger station that Smitty had a lot of weird obsessions about food- he would only eat food or drink drinks that were white or clear, so he ate a lot of rice, pasta, milk and other staples, and drank a lot of water. Any food or drink that had any color other than white or transparency to it disgusted him to no end. If someone tried to give him some, he would close his mouth, turn his head away and refuse to speak to that person for the rest of the day.

“So,” Wickie said from my left, “are we just going to run into the woods and shoot anything that moves?”

“I don’t really have any better ideas,” I admitted. “Maybe that two-headed bear will come back and save us. I wish I could have talked to him more. He seems to be the only one who really knows what’s going on around here.”

“I really wouldn’t count on him bailing us out,” Wickie said. “He must be getting sick of us.” I only shrugged.

“Well, as you know, my goal is to live forever,” I said sarcastically. “So far, so good. If I’ve made it this far, why not just keep going? Everything always seems to work out in the end.” Wickie pulled a joint out of his pocket, lighting it and taking a deep hit. The sun was rapidly setting, the forest gaining an eerie, shadowy look that made it hard to see very far down the trail. “And by the way,” I continued, “the bear is not a *he.* It is a they, and their names are Growlf and Rowlf. They told me.”

Then, a horrendous smell started to waft over to us. It wasn’t the smell of all the dank weed Wickie was smoking, either. This smell was *so* strong that it immediately overpowered the smell of the cannabis. And, to my terror, it was a smell I recognized- the smell of burning metal combined with rotting meat. It was the smell of the creatures with the long arms and pale white flesh who had attacked us earlier.

“Um, Wickie…” I began to say, but he threw the half-smoked joint casually in the brush and just nodded.

“Yeah, I know, bud,” he said calmly, his eyes red and slightly squinted as he looked around, a big shit-eating grin on his face. Looking at him, you would think we were at an amusement park rather than a cursed forest. “They’re definitely back. We’re being watched.” But nothing came out of the brush at us. I could smell the monstrosities, but it appeared the mark from the two-headed bear really worked. I was passing through without being attacked by the monsters of the forest. 

I had a feeling the bear’s mark wouldn’t work on everything, though. As we hiked further ahead in the dark, turning on our flashlights, the smell faded further and further behind us. We heard twigs snapping and bushes being pushed aside in the twilight darkness all around us, but we continued on unmolested. The few shots of alcohol I had taken before leaving to calm my nerves had totally worn off, and I felt a rising sense of anxiety building up inside my chest.

As we neared the site at the end of the trail where I had been told there was a sacrificial altar, a new smell began to arise. It was the odor of burning plastic. A monstrous conglomeration of many bodies stepped out from behind an ancient oak tree to my right, blocking the path. I raised my pistol, a model called the Judge that fired shotgun shells.

“Growlf and Rowlf gave me the mark! I demand passage!” I yelled, pointing the pistol at its face, where a monstrous single eye flicked back and forth, looking at me then Wickie then back at me again. “Move aside, beast. Move aside, let us pass, or I’ll kill you! I really will!” I hoped I sounded a lot braver than I felt. It felt like my voice was trembling, and I could feel my heart racing. I kept the flashlight tucked under my armpit as I took a deep breath in and tried to steady the gun and calm my nerves.

“Fool!” the monster cried in front of me. “I am not bound by the laws of this forest. I was created from corpses in a secret location. The mark of the protector bear has no effect on me.

“I will give you two standing here one last chance- turn around, never come back here, and I will let you live. For I am Rakka, the strong, the unkillable, but the forgiving for those who repent,” the monster said, blowing fetid air in our direction out of his reeking mouth as he yelled. The trees shook around us, and I heard birds and bats fleeing in droves as leaves fell from the tallest branches, showering the forest.

“OK, listen up here, Rakka,” Wickie said, stepping in front of me, “no one tells us where we can go or what we can do. And there’s a kid back there we’re supposed to bring back. If you’re so strong, why do you take mere children?” Rakka laughed, a deep, gurgling sound that reminded me of slug slime and moldy, rotting leaves on the bottom of a lake. It sounded wet, sickly, phlegmy and, overall, just disturbing.

I heard movement behind Rakka, and men and women in black robes started to step out, forming a semicircle. Both Wickie and I had our guns pointed at the new arrivals, yet they seemed totally unafraid.

“Hail Rakka the Great, the Strong, the Unkillable!” said a tall blonde woman in the front. The rest of them shouted in unison, “Hail!”

“Hey, you guys stole that from the Nazis! Pretty lame, losers,” Wickie said, laughing.

“Actually, I think the Nazis stole it from the ancient Romans,” I said. “You know, the whole ‘Hail Caesar’ thing…” Wickie gave me a sour sideways look, frowning. The cult members and the monster in front of us totally ignored our conversation.

“The child is ours,” Rakka said, smiling a grin with far too many teeth, many of them appeared rotted and blackened, but still sharp and extremely long. “I am done being patient. If you take one step forward, I will kill you both.” I took one step forward. Rakka’s single eye widened in surprise as I raised the gun and began shooting at the cult members behind him. I knew from previous experience that shooting Rakka did no good, but that was a problem I’d have to deal with later- probably in about thirty seconds.

Wickie followed my lead, firing his .22 at the center mass and heads of the cult members. Within seconds, all of them were on the ground, dying or dead, blood soaking into the dried leaves of the forest floor.

With a roar, Rakka began to rush forwards towards me, and then everything happened very fast.

From my right, a loud rustling started, and out popped the two-headed bear, Growlf and Rowlf. He sprinted out on all fours from a cluster of bushes nearby, slamming into Rakka with an amazing speed and sending him flying twenty feet off the trail and directly into the trunk of a huge evergreen tree. The branch went through the heart of Rakka, and though the maggots swarmed and tried to reknit his flesh, he was caught. His feet moved with futility, not even touching the ground since he was suspended about five feet off the ground with the impaling branch keeping him stuck. He roared and screamed, but made no progress.

“Go now!” Growlf said in my mind, his psychic voice echoing with a loud, clanging feeling throughout my entire consciousness. I winced at the power of this inner voice. “The boy has little time left! The altar is just ahead. You are our only hope.”

“Well, that’s not good,” I muttered to myself. If I was the only hope for saving this forest, maybe this entire town, then they really were in a much shittier position than I had imagined.

Wickie and I ran forward, reloading our guns as we went. A few hundred feet ahead, we saw the flickering glow of a bonfire. A round stone table about twenty feet across sat next to it, a thin, shirtless boy tied and gagged on the top of it. Around him, cult members in black robes chanted, standing in a circle, every eye on the imprisoned boy.

Once we were within range, Wickie and I began firing, my Judge pistol blowing holes the size of a grapefruit into the chests of many of the cult members. Wickie was also a great shot, and his .22 put tiny bullet holes into the skulls of those nearest the boy, dropping them instantly. The rest of them scattered like cockroaches, the chanting stopping immediately as they ran in all directions into the forest. We took the opportunity to reload.

“Let’s get this kid and get the fuck out of here!” Wickie said, and I nodded. The sooner I get out of here, the better, I thought to myself.

Taking out a pocket knife, I quickly began to cut the bindings on the boy’s hands and feet, while Wickie untied the gag around his mouth. The boy had a vacant, blank look in his eyes. I wondered whether he was in shock.

“Smitty, can you hear me?” I asked him loudly. He didn’t respond, just staring through me, not making eye contact.

“Just grab the freaking kid and let’s go!” Wickie said. “Those other things, the ones with the long arms and the pale skin, are probably going to be back soon. You don’t really know how long the protection the bear gave you lasts, do you?”

“Uh, no,” I said, trying to remember. I knew logically that it didn’t last forever, but would it wear off so fast? I figured we would find out on our way back.

Grabbing Smitty’s arm, I pulled him up from the table. He didn’t resist, and when I started speed-walking back towards the trail, he kept pace with me.

“Thank you,” Smitty said to me silently. I barely heard him, but looked over at him in surprise. He glanced over at me, making eye contact for the barest fractions of a second, then returned his gaze forwards. 

“Hey, little man, you’re welcome,” I said, smiling. “We weren’t going to let you die out here. Your dad is waiting for you, too.” I didn’t tell him his dad was probably waiting for him in the hospital, getting his head stitched up and his skull fractures checked out.

“But we are in trouble, still,” Smitty said, pointing to the tree where Rakka had been impaled. Looking up, I realized the branch where I had seen him suspended was now broken in half, and there was no sign of the monster except for thick black blood and thousands of squirming maggots on the fractured remainder.

“Oh shit…” Wickie and I both said at the same time, as a rushing shape smelling like burning plastic and rotting meat sprinted out of the woods, grabbing Wickie and disappearing into the pitch blackness. As he was grabbed, Wickie dropped his gun, yelling in surprise. Once he realized what was happening, he started screaming at me.

“Get out of here!” he said. “Don’t worry about me! Get the kid to safety.” I tried running after him, but Rakka was far too fast. After a minute, I turned around and went back to the trail, where I saw Smitty patiently waiting.

“Fuck!” I screamed. “We have to get him back!”

“Don’t worry,” Smitty said, his face a blank expression. “I can track them. I can track all of them. I see it like points on a map in my…” He stopped walking, pointing to his forehead. I was panting, doubled over from sprinting, “But we need help. There are too many of them, and the mark is wearing off. I see it on you like light being washed away. Your face grows darker and darker as it fades.” This was the most I had ever heard Smitty speak, and I was flabbergasted.

“We *will* come back,” I said, taking Smitty’s hand and leading him to safety. We found his father, who had been picked up by a random passerby as he stumbled in the road, his face a mask of blood, his wounds untreated, the brain damage and concussions making him totally unaware of where he was or what was going on by that point.

\*\*\*

I finished telling all of this to my psychiatrist the next morning. He had been prescribing me antidepressants for my crippling depression, and even though Wickie was gone for now, I still had to go to work and keep my appointments. I knew I would get Wickie back eventually. He was too tough and dumb to kill. The psychiatrist nodded at me as I spoke.

“Do you blame yourself for what happened to your friend, Hardwick?” he asked, pushing his glasses up his nose.

“No, we did what we had to do,” I said, not knowing whether I was being totally truthful. Maybe I did blame myself a little bit, but I didn’t want to tell this man that. He wrote a few more notes in his notepad, then his secretary came in.

“Dr. Firenzo?” the pretty brunette said. He looked up. “You have a call. It’s an emergency.” Nodding gravely, he got up.

“Please excuse me, Jay. I’ll be right back,” he said, leaving the room and closing the door behind him.

I got up after a minute, bored, wondering how long this was going to take. I looked at his notepad, laying facedown on his brown leather chair, and frowned.

Flipping it over, I saw he hadn’t been taking notes at all. He had simply drawn a picture across the entire front of the notepad.

It was a picture of me, crucified to a lamppost, my eyeballs hanging out, a pentagram carved into my chest. Underneath in tiny, neat block letters, he had written, “Kill the traitor.”

“Well,” I said, putting the notepad back down, “that can’t be good.”

\*\*\*

The FBI offered to send me help in finding Wickie. That day, I had a team of agents and dogs with me at the ranger station. Even Sheriff Ames showed up, saying he wanted to help in any way he could. After all, I had risked my life, I had saved the boy, but now another adventure had to begin.

I just hoped I would find Wickie in time, and that one day, I would end the evil in this forest, once and for all.
