My name is Rasmus, and this story i am going to tell you might sound stupid or like a kids story. but then just get the fuck away, because this is real. and i am totally fucking scared right now. anyways. my entire childhood was wrapped in the enchanting world of Winnie the Pooh – the books, the stories, and the animated movies. It was an obsession that consumed my early years. But today, I no longer harbor the same affection for that peculiar bear. 

well. to know exactly what happened, Allow me to take you on a journey back to the beginning of this unsettling experience. but for all kids out there, you probably wouldnt understand if i just told you normally. so imma tell my experience in a book format. for you to understand the best.


Well as a child, I held a steadfast belief that Winnie the Pooh was real, an existence beyond the pages and screens, despite the chorus of naysayers telling me otherwise. I grew up, entered college, and gradually the stories of Pooh drifted into the background. It wasn't until I met my girlfriend, Sarah, that those dormant memories resurfaced.

Our relationship was built on a foundation of shared nostalgia. We'd been a couple for three years when we decided to embark on a trip through a dense forest. It was during this trip that I began to experience an overwhelming unease.

i looked around. and somehow everything looked… familiar… like i had seen it before.. but i couldnt really put a finger on where.
sarah: ”Rasmus? you okay? you seem a little bit shaken”
i looked at her and answered:
”What? yeah yeah. everythings fine. i just.. got a weird sense of that i have been here before”

and when we arrived at a big tree, i put my hand against the tree to just take a break. when Out of nowhere, a vivid and gruesome image of Winnie the Pooh materialized in my mind. No longer was he the friendly bear of my youth; he had metamorphosed into a nightmarish figure, drenched in blood, brandishing a malevolent chainsaw.

Sarah: (concerned) "Rasmus, are you really sure that your okay? You look like you've seen a ghost."

Rasmus: (shaken) "I... I just had a disturbing thought, Sarah. It's hard to explain. Let's keep moving."

I couldn't make sense of it, but I instinctively clutched Sarah's hand and urged her to run deeper into the woods with me. We stumbled upon a rustic cottage, a place that seemed eerily familiar, i then out of nowhere understood where i’ve seen the place before.

i were in the hundred acre woods. the echoing tales I'd been told. i saw before me how pooh bear lived a happy life here whit his friends. sarah wanted to leave. but i wanted to meet the friends. so I tried my best to explain to Sarah the tales i had been told as a kid. and this place’s familiar. and also the terrifying transformation I had witnessed in my mind, but, understandably, she dismissed it as mere imagination.

Rasmus: (nervously) "This place, Sarah, it reminds me of the stories I used to read as a kid. It's like we've stumbled into the Hundred Acre Wood."

Sarah: (smiling) "That's cute, Rasmus, but let's not get carried away with childhood fantasies."

With caution, we ventured inside the house, and then we heard it – heavy, ominous footsteps approaching. A bear, now in grotesque human form, burst through a door, sending shivers down our spines.

Frightened and desperate, we sought refuge under a creaky bed, the sinister bear choosing the very bed we hid under to rest upon. We remained there, huddled together, for an entire day, paralyzed by fear, before summoning the courage to leave.

Sarah: (whispering) "Rasmus, what is happening? This isn't real, right?"

Rasmus: (whispering back) "I don't know, but we need to find a way out of here."

We believed we had escaped the nightmarish presence, but our nightmare was far from over. As we ventured back into the forest, a massive, malevolent pig appeared, wielding a sledgehammer, and struck Sarah with a brutal force that left her lifeless on the ground. Horror consumed me as I gazed upon her lifeless form.

Rasmus: (sobbing) "Sarah! No, this can't be happening!"

At that very moment, the nightmarish version of Winnie the Pooh emerged, just as I had envisioned, with a bloodstained chainsaw in hand. The other characters – Piglet, Tigger, Owl, Rabbit, Kangaa, and Eeyore – had all undergone a horrifying transformation into grotesque, monstrous entities.

I conclude this harrowing story with a chilling warning: "Whatever you do, please, do not meet your idols. They may not be anything like you imagined. In the darkest depths of our reality, the childhood wonders can become the stuff of your darkest nightmares.

 The end
