I work at a grocery store maintained by a horde of morons.



Every week, the refrigeration unit goes out. Whether the fans break, the drainage clogs, the oil burns up, whatever—it fails without fail once a week.



We put in a work order, and after a few days, a fat shlub shows up and starts poking around. They’ll hang around for a couple hours “working” and eventually ask me to sign something. 



If interrogated, they insist the problem is solved for now, but they ordered a part that should be coming soon—in the next couple days—and they’ll update the ticket to reflect that. 



They never do. The part never comes. The problem recurs, another ticket is created, and the cycle repeats. Thus, we endure an endless parade of buffoons at all hours, leaving their tools about, ladders standing, and doors propped open.



That’s why it wasn’t much of a surprise when I came in one morning after a day off to find several ceiling tiles moved aside.



I could’ve grabbed a ladder and fixed them myself. However, I had no way of knowing whether a tech was coming back. I’d been scolded before by our district facilities manager for “interfering” with maintenance.



So, I left them. There was one in the office, one in the breakroom, and one in the men’s bathroom.



That day, we were slammed. I was called to the front to help cashier and get the line down.



I set up my register and called over the next family in line.



They had the cutest little kid I’d ever seen.



He was probably six, with white-blonde hair, a Winnie the Pooh hoodie, and a pair of light-up Sketchers. He was holding his dad’s hand.



I waved, and he bashfully waved back.



The mom forgot her purse in the car, so she ran out to get it. 



“Yesterday, I made paper angels in class for Christmas!” he said proudly and without prompting.



“Really?” I said. “Wow, that’s fun!”



“Yeah, my teacher said mine were the best ones in the whole class. I like paper angels because—” he coughed loudly without covering his mouth “—because they’re so pretty and they look like the real thing.” Then, before I could respond, he said, “You know, you’re not supposed to work on the Sabbath. It’s a holy day.”



I thought his dad might be slightly embarrassed, but he was beaming with pride.



“Why’s that?” I asked.



He rolled his eyes. “Because it’s the seventh day, duh.”



I laughed. *Well, you should tell your daddy not to shop on Saturday then, huh?* I wanted to say, but I didn’t.



“You’re a smart kid. What’s your name?”



“Bryce,” he said.



“Ah, Bryce, that’s a good name. How old are you?”



Bryce didn’t answer my question. Instead, he asked one of his own.



“Why are you bald?”



His dad’s face went flush and I laughed loudly. 



“Well,” I said, “sometimes that happens when you get older.”



Bryce nodded contemplatively like he had never considered that before. Fear flashed across his face. He tugged on his dad’s shirt and looked up seriously.



“Will I get bald, daddy?”



“There’s nothing wrong with being bald, buddy,” he said, glancing at me, “but I don’t think you will. It’s genetic.”



The mom came back with her purse and apologized profusely. They paid, and I wished them all a nice day.



Before they walked away, the dad slipped a pamphlet into my hand with a smile. “For your salvation. Repent and be saved.” Seventh-Day Adventists… I just thanked him.



The line was down and I went back to the sales floor.



On my way to the office maybe ten minutes later, I passed by the bathrooms and saw Bryce’s dad waiting outside the men’s. He was knocking.



“Bryce, open the door *now*,” he demanded. Worry crept into his voice as a faint tremor.



“Is everything okay?” I asked him.



“He’s been in there for a long time and he’s not responding.”



“He locked it?”



“Obviously he locked it.”



“Right,” I said, thinking. “Let me grab the key.”



I grabbed the key from the office and slipped it into the door. I stood back to let Bryce’s dad take the lead.



“We’re coming inside, okay buddy?” he called.



He swung the door open.



It was empty.



Bryce was gone.



We both stood there, our stomachs sinking. 



Suddenly Bryce’s dad charged in and spun around.



“Bryce?” he called to no one. It was plain as day that the bathroom was empty, and there was nowhere to hide. One sink, one toilet, one urinal, one trashcan. 



“Isn’t there another exit? There’s gotta be another exit!”



I swallowed hard and shook my head. My eyes darted around the room, searching for an answer.



“Are you sure he didn’t go into the women’s?” I asked.



“No, he went in here. I closed the door for him. He was right here, goddammit!”



I walked over to the women’s anyway and tried the door handle. It was unlocked.



I swung the door open and an elderly woman inside screamed at me from the toilet. I swung it shut.



I rushed back into the men’s where Bryce’s dad was staring at the floor, pacing.



“Are you sure he didn’t walk out of the bathroom at some point?” I asked.



He stared at me incredulously. “No, you fucking moron, how would that work? I was at the door the entire time!”



“You didn’t look at your phone or anything?”



“I glanced at my phone, but…” he began. “What the fuck are you trying to say?”



“Sir, I’m just looking for an explanation.”



“No, so I’m—let me get this straight—you think I would let my son just walk away from me? Is that right?”



His voice was raising with every word and other customers were beginning to stare from the registers.



I shook my head, at a loss for words.



Then I remembered the ceiling tile.



I looked up into the dark hole above us. So did he.



I ran for the ladder without a word. I heard Bryce’s dad calling out the boy’s name through cupped hands behind me, desperate.



How could he have reached it? The ceiling was at least eight feet high. Even if he climbed on the tallest fixture, the sink (which wasn’t anywhere close to the moved tile), he couldn’t possibly have touched the ceiling, much less climbed into it. Besides, the drop ceiling tiles weren’t reinforced in any way. I was certain they would have collapsed under his weight if he tried crawling across them.



I brought the ladder back and hastened up. Bryce’s dad didn’t object. 



Inside the ceiling was dusty and dark. I shined my phone flashlight inside for a better view.



Ahead, there was nothing but some ductwork and rafters.



I panned around and saw more of the same. Some wiring, some dust bunnies. The layer of dust (20 years of it, at least) seemed completely undisturbed. 



Finally, I repositioned myself on the ladder and turned around to look behind me.



There was a massive hand.



I jumped, nearly sending the ladder toppling out from under me. Bryce’s dad held on tight.



“What?” he shouted. “Did you find him?”



I didn’t answer. I just stared at the hand.



It was made of paper-mache, and it was painted blue.



“Answer me goddammit!” he shouted again.



“No,” I said shakily. “No, I don’t see him.”



I reached out and picked the hand up.



There was something off about it. It was heavy. It seemed like it was maybe cast in plaster first, then the paper-mache applied over top.



Then I realized it. The hand had seven fingers.



Bryce’s dad was calling out to me but I hardly heard him.



I turned the hand over. It was hollow on the underside. Something was stuffed into the opening.



A shoe.



I grabbed the heel tab and pulled it out with a thunk.



It lit up.  


  
\*\*\*

  


The police searched the grocery store high and low. Beyond the shoe stuck in the plaster hand, they didn’t find a single other trace of Bryce. 



I told them everything from my perspective and they left me alone. I had no explanation for the hand, and neither did they.



I called the maintenance company about the ceiling tiles. They insisted that no one had been there that morning, and the technician from the most recent work order swore up and down he had never moved the ceiling tiles.



I put the tiles back in place, of course. They gave me the heebie-jeebies.



Assuming the worst possible intent—that someone had opened the tiles and waited for someone to abduct—why were there moved tiles in the breakroom and the office? Had they planned on targeting one of our employees? Me, even?



Time passed without incident for several weeks.



I checked in from time to time on the progress of the search for Bryce. There were never any new leads. Someone thought they saw him in a Sonic drive-thru two towns over, but it wasn’t him.



I had settled back into the mundanity of my work when something new happened one night.



I was in the office doing the closing paperwork while my cashier was on the sales floor cleaning.



I was reaching for the stapler when I heard a soft sliding sound.



When I looked up from my papers, I saw a ceiling tile at the far end of the office was out of place again. Same one as before.



I sat still.



Looking closer, I saw something else: blue paper fingers. Six of them, save for the thumb, which remained out of sight. They came through the hole in the ceiling and gripped the lip tight.



I didn’t even have time to react. As soon as I recognized the fingers, something else shot down.



Hair.



Golden, curly hair came pouring down all at once.



At the root, peeking out of the ceiling, was a huge pale white forehead and pair of brilliant blue eyes, wide and staring.



The hair was real, as far as I could tell, but the rest wasn’t. It was paper. Like a man in a paper-mache mascot costume. I could see the pale beige paint flaking, the uneven texture of the paper beneath. It was poorly done. I could see parts where they had missed painting and the white-gray of the paper showed. The head was huge and round, exactly as you would imagine a mascot head to be.



The eyes were painted on, too, but… I think they flickered with excitement.



I reeled back and fell out of my office chair. I bit down hard on my tongue with a grunt.



When I looked back up at the ceiling in panic, it was gone. The tile was closed and the head was gone.



The cashier came rushing in at the commotion, and I made an excuse. “Scared myself,” I joked, laughing and blotting my bleeding tongue with a tissue.



When he was convinced I was okay and I was alone again, I checked the security camera footage of the office. Nothing. I looked like a crazy person, staring up at the perfectly normal and unchanging ceiling for a second and then going tumbling in fright. 



\*\*\*





I spent weeks dreaming about the paper mascot peering down at me from the ceiling. In some, it climbed through the hole fully, revealing a massive angel costume complete with wings. Then it produced a fireaxe and thunked it straight into my skull. In others, it just hung there, staring at me, until it raised a finger and beckoned me forward. For whatever reason I obeyed, and when I reached it, its arms shot down and yanked me up, and I was washed in this beautiful blue light. Those ones didn’t scare me like the others. They comforted me, somehow.



It was another month before my next encounter.



We had yet another refrigeration alarm going off—LOW TEMP IN UNIT B9—and I was stuck waiting on a technician to show up. It was late already. The store was closed, and the cashier was finishing up the cleaning duties. 



I was on the phone with the maintenance dispatcher for an ETA when the cashier let me know she was done. I held my hand over the receiver and told her she could leave. She looked at me uneasily.



“Are you sure you wanna stay here alone?” she asked.



I chuckled. “Well, I don’t have much of a choice, do I? Unless you wanna stay with me.”



She checked her watch awkwardly and shook her head. “I’m good. I’ve got plans, sorry.”



“I was joking,” I assured her. “Go home. I’ll be fine.”



So she left, and I waited for the tech alone. The dispatcher assured me someone would be there in an hour and a half.



I wasn’t about to waste all that time sitting around. I walked out on the sales floor and got to work straightening things up, reworking backstock, etc.



Grocery stores are eerie at night, in the same way that any busy public place is eerie when it’s empty. Something about the lack of people feels apocalyptic. It’s like the world outside was sucked up by the Rapture, and you’re alone inside with all this food. At least, you hope you’re alone.



I was running the pallet of grocery backstock past the cooler door when I heard something inside. It sounded like a thump of metal.



Grocery stores make lots of noises if you listen. Hissing, creaking, the whining of pipes, the humming of the refrigeration units. You get used to it. But when you hear a new sound, it sticks out. 



I stopped the pallet jack and listened. I didn’t hear anything else.



We had walked the store and checked for customers as usual. I was alone. But… had I checked the cooler? I couldn’t remember.



Hesitantly, I slid the cooler door open.



A ceiling tile was gone.



The cooler ceiling doesn’t have tiles. It’s a sheet of solid metal. But nevertheless, there was a perfect square missing from it.



I walked in just in time to catch a blue hand sliding the metal back into place. It fit flush with mechanical precision, the lines fading away like they were never there.



I saw something move in the meat cooler.



Plastic strip curtains obscured my view, but there was a figure shifting around in there. I heard the sounds of eating.



I took a deep breath and slid the plastic aside.



It was Bryce.



He was clutching a chuck roast in his hands and ripping huge chunks away with his teeth.



He was emaciated and filthy. I could see his collarbone under his taut skin. 



He was still wearing his Winnie the Pooh sweater, but it was far too small now. He had aged. It had only been two months or so since he had disappeared from our bathroom, but he looked to have aged three years at least.



Bryce saw me and stood. His blonde hair was shaved into a buzzcut. His knees were knobby and bruised.



“Bryce…” I managed. My breath was frozen in astonishment.



“Hi,” he said. His voice was deeper now, scratchy and thin.



“Where have you been?” I took a step forward.



“Heaven,” he replied like it was the most obvious thing.



I took a deep breath and calmed myself. I needed him to feel safe.



“What were you doing in Heaven?”



“Holy work,” he said softly. Like it was a secret. Something he was ashamed of, maybe. “They chose me.” 



I took another cautious step towards him. His face was covered in dirt and beef drippings.



“Who chose you, Bryce?” I asked. I knew the answer already.



“The paper angels,” he said.



And he smiled.



\*\*\*





For the next three years, the news just kept coming. The same story in different places, with different victims. 



Some of them were children. Some were elderly. Some were like me. 



All of them were crucified. 



All of them had flecks of paint and paper fibers all over their bodies.



Investigators speculated that it was the work of a serial killer. A psychopath.



But I knew whose work it really was.



It was holy work.



EDIT: I hear something over my roof. The beating of wings.
