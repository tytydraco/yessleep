I had just started college. I was nervous and exited at the same time. Hi I am Tommy age 15, and I had just moved secondary schools. I’m just gonna get into this. For the past 4 days many people in my school have gone missing. I  had just gone into my first ever class, English , which was my favourite class as I was pretty good at it. 

This dude named Steve came up to me and said, “Do you play Fortnite?” I replied,
“Uhh yes I do. Why?”
“So I can add you!” He told me.
As the day went on we became pretty good friends.

The strange things started when I got to math class. The teacher was like, ” Olivia! I gotta ask you something! Olivia? I could’ve sworn she was here.” I didn’t think anything of it though, it was pretty weird when the teacher, named Mrs Duff, said that she remembered Olivia being there. I brushed it off and carried on with my classes.

The next day came, and I was pretty exited to go back to school. I mean, I might sound like the nerd emoji but I kinda like this new school. When I got in, only half the class were in science. Kinda weird right? I thought they were all off sick or bunking off school so I let it slide. My friend Steve was there so it was pretty cool.

But then, the teacher put on the news channel, and I had never been so shook in my life. The new reporter looked at the camera and told the viewers, ”Last night, two bodies were uncovered in Clarence park, a park in St Albans. Their names were Olivia Watson, and Joseph Bailey.” That was strange. Those to kids were in my form. Something was up.

I got home and told my mum everything. She couldn’t believe it. She told me to stay off school but I said no as I needed to see Steve, as he was my only friend and if he went missing  the next day, I wouldn’t know. I turned ITV news on, only to find out that more kids where found, they’re bodies twisted, bloody. They were the kids in my class.

The next day I brought a knife in my backpack just in case I was the next victim. Luckily though, I made it safely into class. I handed in my knife, since I wasn’t meant to be a school threat. Something was different in my class. 3 people left. Steve was not one of the 3. I fell on the ground. Steve was most likely dead. I felt better at the fact that Steve could’ve had the day off. But what about the other kids.

I sprinted out of the school. knife in my bag. But as I got outside my flat. A man looked at me with a sinister grin. I fell on the ground unconscious. Now I’m in a hospital bed. My mum said she saw what happened and stabbed the man from behind. He was dead. Dead for now at least.

Steve is okay! He helped my mum get me to the hospital. We scheduled to play Fortnite whenever I’m okay to leave the hospital. I do have some injuries, like a broken arm. I’m not very sure how that happened. The only thing that matters is that I am okay!
