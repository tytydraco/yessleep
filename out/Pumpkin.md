 

The cobble stone path was lit only by moonlight. It was silent. Not even the chirping of crickets filled the night air. The path wrapped around a house and the moonlight spilled into the living room windows. I took a peek inside. It was barren except for furniture and a fireplace. No one was inside. Where was everyone? 

A man carrying a hatchet and a burlap sack sitting in his head walked past me. Oh good, there was one. But he didn’t do anything. Just kept walking. What kind of haunted house walkthrough was this? Where was the music? The chainsaws? Teenage girls screaming?  

I continued walking down the path as it wrapped around the house. No one was on the trail. I looked for a trip wire to trigger a jump scare or something-anything. But the silence and absence of people was scaring me more than what I paid for. Suddenly, I heard a bass drop and music began to play over the hill away from the haunted house. Laughter and cheers rang out. Finally, a party or at least something for this so-called event. I trudged down the hill to find some girls dancing with solo cups in hand. It was a small party. 

“Hey, are you guys here for the haunted house?” I yelled over the music. They stopped and looked up the hill and then at me. 

“It’s closed, technical difficulties,” The tallest girl replied, “The real party is here. Grab a drink!” She cheered and went back to dancing. Awkwardly I shuffled away to the drink table and took a glance over my options. Just booze. No soda, and I wasn’t a drinker. One of the girls walks up beside me. I barely glance at her out of the corner of my eye. 

“Some party huh?” I asked, but no response. She stood there unmoving. I turned and looked at her and jumped, dropping my empty red solo cup. It was one of the actors. 

“Hey what technical difficulties were wrong with the house?” I asked. 

She glared at me, her black hair curtaining her white glazed contacts so I couldn’t see her pupils. Her mouth sat in a thin line.  

“Nice costume. It looks so real.” Again, nothing. 

I waved a hand in front of her face, “Hello? Anyone in there?” 

“Who are you talking to?” A fellow party goer asked. The girl was gone after I looked away. 

“One of the haunted house actors, she was just here.” 

“Dude, you were talking to thin air. Are you feeling ok?” 

“I’m fine, just confused. I came here for the haunted house walk through. Someone said something went wrong. Got a clue as to what that might be?”  

“The house on the hill? That’s been abandoned for years. There’s no event going on there. Are you talking about the one a few minutes away?” 

“What? No, I was sent this address and bought a ticket. Even saw an actor walk right past me. Didn’t scare me or nothing.” 

“Wait wait, did he have a burlap sack over his head?” 

“Um yeah.” 

“Dude, you saw a ghost or some shit, that’s what the killer of that family was wearing as he murdered them in cold blood. The blood still stains the wooden floors of the living room.” 

That she knew wasn’t true, she saw the living room with her own eyes and not a speck of dust was on a single wooden plank. What the hell had she seen? Who sent her that address? 

“Look,” she huffed, “I’m just here for the haunted house walkthrough. This sounds stupid but I’m trying to get over my fear of them, and thought why not try during the scariest night of the year?” She waited for the guy to laugh, tell her she’s pathetic for her fear. But he simply nodded. 

“No, I totally get it. I’m actually heading to the haunted house now, why don’t we go together? Let me get you a ticket if the one you have is rejected.”  

“Wow, um, thanks that would be great. I’m sorry, what was your name?” 

“Jesse.” Jesse smiled and held out a hand. 

“Sarah.” I shook his hand. His skin was soft and warm in her palm. She wouldn’t mind holding onto it a bit longer. 

They walked through the neighborhood downtown to the open haunted house. A line stretched down a grass path. Eerie music played from speakers as animatronics did their dance and spoke in low voices how this would be the last night, they’d be alive.  

“Damn, that’s a long line,” Sarah stood on her toes as if that would give her a better view of the end of the line.  

“Good thing I have express passes.”  

“What?” 

Jesse pulled two purple tickets out of his pocket. In gold on the end of the stubs read the word express. 

“Was someone else supposed to be going with you?” She asked. 

“My ex girlfriend. We broke up a few weeks ago and it was after I bought the tickets. She loves these things; I figured I hold onto them because someone else could always go with me or I could regift them to another couple.” Jesse explained with sadness in his voice. 

Sarah lay a hand on his arm, “I’m so sorry, that must really suck. But I’m glad you decided to go-with a complete stranger that is.” She laughed nervously. 

“You’re not a stranger, not anymore. We shook hands, and introduced ourselves. Last time I checked that’s how you end being strangers with each other…if that makes sense.” 

“No, yeah totally.” She laughed with him standing awkwardly beside him. 

“Shall we?” Jesse motioned to the express line. 

Sarah didn’t notice beforehand, but she was shaking. More than she was earlier, and it wasn’t from the chilly fall weather. Her kneecaps were twitching with nervousness as her mouth grew dry. Her heart knocked at her chest. 

“Woah, hey, it’s ok. It’s not real. I promise you. You can hold onto me the whole time. You really don’t like haunted houses, do you?” Jesse asked concerned. 

“No, I get…overstimulated by the noise and the lights and smells. It just gets in my head, and I feel trapped. I start having a panic attack when I can’t get myself to realize it’s fake.” 

Jess nodded, “Let’s make a safe word, the moment you say it, we leave, the actors are required to escort us out if we’re uncomfortable. How about, pumpkin? It’s Halloween and seasonal.”  

“Sure, pumpkin.” She repeats the word testing it on her tongue. It eases her anxiety slightly, and she moves forward to stand in the express line. As they creep closer and closer to the house, her breathing becomes shallower and more restless. 

It’s not real, it’s not real, its not real, she tells herself.  

The ticket master takes the tickets from Jesse and opens the gate allowing them into the house. Sarah immediately grabs onto his arm; her eyes are glued to the floor only looking for how to get through the house and not run into the walls. It was a few moments before the action started. 

Fists began pounding on the walls, and strobe lights flared. A chainsaw rippled and Sarah held her breath. People began talking. 

“Come to stay the night sweetie?” A woman spoke in a shrill voice in her ear. Sarah recoiled into Jesse. 

“You’re doing great!” Jesse called over the noise. 

Sarah just squeezed her eyes tighter. She wish she could do the same to her ears. Block out everything.  

After what seemed like hours they had to press through a thin hallway before getting to the exit. It required them to go single file. But as they progressed, the walls grew tighter. Sarah was forced to look where she was going. The doorway out was so close, she could taste the fresh air on her tongue. Jesse stepped out and let go of her hand, and the door slammed shut in front of Sarah. She jumped startled, but figured Jesse triggered a trap door. So she waited for it to open, when it didn’t, she tested the knob. It was locked. She began pounding on the door. 

“Hello? Jesse? I think I’m stuck!” She pounded harder, the fact that she was alone crept into her mind and her anxiety crept back in. Her knees trembled and she began panting heavily. 

“Jesse! Jesse! This isn’t funny! Pumpkin! Pumpkin! Pumpkin!!” She screamed at the top of her lungs. The next group should be coming up behind her, she would just have to wait. And so she did, but no one came. She sank to the floor crying. She covered her ears to hide the hideous music and sound effects. A cold chill ran over her as a hand landed on her shoulder, Sarah jerked up and sat the female actor from the party.  

“Oh, thank goodness. I’m stuck or lost or, I don’t know. Can you get me out of here?” 

The girl nods and helps her stand, she takes her hand and leads her away from the door. Sarah sniffled and cried softly as the girl led her back through the house. She lifted a carpet on a wall and had Sarah walk through. She wanted for the girl as she took her hand again. Finally, she was outside again, Sarah turned to the girl.  

“Thank y-“but the girl was gone. She thought she could still feel her cold hand in hers.  

“Sarah!” A familiar voice called out. Jesse came running towards her, “What happened? Are you okay?” Jesse asked and an actor was with him. 

“Yes, I’m fine, another actor led me out of the house.” 

“Which actor miss? Describe her please.” The male zombie actor asked. 

“Um she looked like the girl from the ring. Black long hair covering her face and pale skin. White nightgown.” 

The zombie actor just stood and stared. 

“What’s wrong?” Sarah asked. 

“We don’t have an actor that costumes as that I’m afraid.”
