I will go ahead and say that this next part of my story is where all the worst of it happens. Proceed at your own risk.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I went from that courtroom, still in the hospital gown, straight to that damned asylum. I never got a proper goodbye with the Millers. I stayed at Saint Neumann’s until I was 16, which is when all hell broke loose and the asylum itself was shut down.

Neumann’s Asylum was shut down when I escaped. The amount of manpower they rallied up to try and find me raised suspicions amongst those in town who didn’t know I existed. Which then sparked an investigation. It wasn’t closed due to the “regular” mistreatment that you hear about from most mental hospitals in the 40s. That was pretty publicly known. However, behind closed doors, the staff at Neumann’s did so much worse. Some of the patients with higher function would be killed and sold to universities as cadavers. Just enough to not raise an alarm. Their families were often told that they simply run away and weren’t found. A lot of the young girls and some of the young boys would be kept and temporarily “rented”. But the doctors kept their favorites.

I, personally, was sold as something else. The men who had killed my family and left me as I am became “customers” to the asylum. And I wasn’t the only patient they came to see. That, I’m sure of. Initially they did try to.. Use me that way. If it wasn’t for the fact that I don’t have any organs at all, then I’m certain they would have. I suppose I got lucky in that sense. After they discovered that they couldn’t defile me with that they turned to other methods. There was once when they took me outside to the yard. I don’t like that memory. When even what they did that time didn’t kill me, I was dragged inside by the collar of my shirt and up to my room where I was left to bleed, alone. I am grateful I fell unconscious shortly. Another patient informed me once I’d awoken that the nurses didn’t take kindly to me “dirtying the floor”. I was out, that time, for 10 days. And I woke up with a new, circular scar on my forehead.

That part is incredibly difficult to say and evidently also really hard to type out. I think I’ve only ever told one person about what happened to me and the others in that place. I haven’t seen him in a few days. Off doing his job I suppose. Maybe we’ll bump into each other soon.

I spent most of my days in isolation. My room was placed on the very top floor and locked from the outside. They hardly ever fed me, though I didn’t suppose they really had to. I get all my energy from sleep which was just about the only thing I could do. The only time I ever interacted with any other patient was the few times they *did* give me food, or walking through the hallway to “appointments”. All of my visits with the doctor, if you could even call him that, were pure torture. He had taken note on how seemingly nothing could kill me and decided that he would personally do whatever he could to create immortality. Which, with what was their current technology at the time, consisted of taking pieces of my body and experimenting on them. I was never allowed any anesthetics, though I don’t know if they would have even worked if I was. To them, since I wasn’t human obviously I couldn’t feel pain. And if I showed signs of being in pain, that was good. Because I was *“of the devil and from hell”* according to them. The doctor would mostly use already scarred areas, however he was not opposed to leaving me new ones.

Though all of that did have quite the toll on me physically and mentally. There was one consistent thing that I now consider to be worse. All the staff did their damndest to gaslight me into believing my entire life was a lie any chance they interacted with me. I was repeatedly told that I was 100% human. Anything different that I saw was a hallucination. My family was never killed and, in fact, had been the ones to place me into Neumann’s care because I was crazy. Though they used more colorful language. If I brought up the doctor’s words, they’d tell me he’d never said that and I was receiving normal check up appointments. If I pointed out my prosthetics, I was told that it was just a normal human arm. They kept that up the entire 8 years I was there. Even now sometimes I look for long periods of time into mirrors to check for any inconsistencies. Occasionally I would catch a nurse praying or holding onto a rosary when I was nearby, and that assisted a bit in reassuring me that I knew who and what I was.

One thing I was absolutely *not* allowed to do was touch anybody of my own volition. Considerably a bit more mild than everything else that went on there. But my species’ primary form of bonding is through different forms of touch. So it was a bit of a big deal for me and I still suffer the repercussions of it today.

What finally broke me occurred when I was 16. I was escorted down to the second floor, which is where the doctor's main examination room was. That was not the room I was taken to. It looked much different inside than the other one. In this room was a chair in place of a table. There were straps located on the chair in several spots, far more than would be expected as well. Ankle, thigh, wrist, one for the lower abdomen, one for the upper and around the shoulders, and then one final strap for the head. I turned to look at the nurse who had escorted me.

“Sit,” she instructed. I turned to look back at the chair. I suppose I just didn’t move fast enough for her because she struck me across the face and repeated herself, “I said sit!” I then did as instructed.

Another nurse came in at that point and they both began strapping me in, beginning with that lower abdomen strap. I knew where I was at that point. I remembered seeing patients enter and leave the room a few times. They were always incredibly different after whatever happened in that chair. No longer could they walk or so much as speak. I didn’t know what was going to happen, but I knew it wouldn’t be good. After the nurses had completed all 9 straps they left the room. Each piece of fabric was rough and felt far too tight, the metal buckles digging into my body. The edges were sharp. I couldn’t move in the slightest, any attempt made was met with the buckles cutting into my arms or legs. I was alone in that room for hours, bright fluorescent lights shown directly onto my face and closing my eyes did little to help. I could feel my soul beating out of my chest and tears poured down my face. I just wanted whatever they were going to do to be over and done with already.

I heard footsteps outside the room and the door seemed to scream as it swung open. The doctor now stood in front of me, a deceptively ‘sweet’ smile on his face. I couldn’t help but compare him to that ‘Matthew Collins’ any time I saw him. I made eye contact with him and his smile grew. I involuntarily whimpered when it did. He definitely enjoyed doing this to patients, considering how often he chose to do it.

“Well, young man, the lovely nurses here have brought it to my attention that you’ve become increasingly troubled as of late. I know your friends haven’t visited you recently so I’m sure that’s brought you down.” At this two nurses came into the room with a small rolling cart covered in various tools. The doctor regarded them for a moment before he continued, “Well there is a small procedure we’ll be performing today that will cure you permanently. It’s only about 10 years into practice, but it has worked wonders for all of my patients, so I am confident it will work wonders for you, boy.”

I averted my eyes to the table. I didn’t want to look at him and it was within view. On it I saw three things. A small hammer with a long handle, A spike of equal length that had what looked like a T-shaped handle, and a pad of gauze that was neatly folded.

“Now the way I normally do this isn’t really possible,” He brought my attention back to him, “Your facial structure is quite different from other patients so I will need to go about this in a new way. However, I am fully confident that the change will make no difference.” He took a few steps forward so he was standing immediately next to the chair on my left. “Now, let’s begin, shall we?”

He picked up the long spike and showed it to me. “This is really sharp, so you shouldn’t feel much, not to worry.” I was very much worrying. He placed the point just above and to the right of my left eye. I tried my best not to focus on it, however it took up half of my vision so I didn’t have much choice. My vision was cloudy with tears once again as I saw him reach back and grab the small hammer. I could feel my body shaking and the buckles cutting deeper as he lined it up and drew it back to strike.

The sound and pain rocketed through my skull. It felt as if lightning had shot through me and sounded like something exploded within my head. The doctor drew the mallet back again. When he struck again all I could hear was ringing. Nothing else was audible to me, though I could feel myself screaming. Once he was satisfied that he had the spike far enough through my head, he began to move it. That was a whole new hell.

I know it only happened for a few moments but it felt like eternity. I heard a click through the ringing and felt a strong heat swallow my being. Hot metal coursing through me. I remembered that feeling from years prior. The sounds of the world came back to me and I heard the doctor yelling in pain. I could again smell the sickly scent of burning human flesh. He reflexively pulled himself back, and the spike went with it. My blood poured from where it had once been and I could see blue flames flickering from it as well. I had expected to begin falling and braced myself for such, since the previous two times my magic surged that’s what happened. Instead I felt the straps pop open one by one beginning from the one on my head.

The fluorescent lights on the ceiling shattered, shrouding the room in darkness as glass from the one on a stand immediately above me cut into my neck and face. My body emits a faint glow in pitch darkness, though it’s nowhere near bright enough to illuminate anything around me. I stood from the chair, stumbling and shaking as I did. I was barefoot and in a gown so the glass also cut me as I walked. I fumbled my way forward to the door and pulled it open. The room itself was at the far end of the hall and against the end wall there was a tall window. When I looked through the panes it too shattered, leaving jagged pieces around the edges which stuck into the frame. I didn’t know how it was happening but I knew it was my chance. I turned back to the room, the door had remained open behind me. The doctor was still yelling and one of the nurses was tending to him while the other was gaining her bearings. I lifted myself a tad to get my prosthetic foot onto the sill, the glass couldn’t cut that. I used my prosthetic arm to brace myself. I took one last look behind me at the place which had held me prisoner for 8 whole years and jumped.

I was not at all braced for the ground, so I fell hard. If my bones could have broken I’m sure several of them would have. As quickly as possible I pushed myself to my feet and began running. There were woods nearby and they had to do. I’d look for the Millers as soon as I had my bearings in the world.

An alarm sounded behind me. I was just reaching the woods as I saw a few nurses and several security guards go out the front door and begin searching around. One of the guards spotted me, and called to the others. I took off as fast as possible into the dense foliage, the wounds on my foot slowed me down considerably, but that was the least of my issues at that moment. I could see incredibly well through the dark, though my mind felt foggy. I ran into several low hanging branches and a few bushes of sorts, each time making a loud ruckus, and I could hear the guards getting closer to me. I could hear one get within several yards of me when I tripped. My foot had caught underneath a raised root, which caused me to completely collapse forward.

However, when I fell instead of falling into the leaves and dirt, I became completely surrounded by that endless white void. And this time I did not simply begin falling only to end up in another place. I hit a solid surface. A floor within the void. As soon as I realized I was safe, and they could no longer take me back, I began sobbing uncontrollably. My blood began to cover the floor in a puddle as I did. I don’t know how long I just laid there crying, but when I had stopped, the crimson puddle was a considerable size, nearly larger than my entire body.

I tried once to push and prop myself up but that was to no avail, I was shaking far too much for that. I could feel a heat forming at the base of my skull. That was a heat I had become familiar with at Neumann’s. It was my indication that I would pass out shortly from whatever injuries I had, so I wouldn’t be conscious much longer. I stretched my good arm out and laid my hand flat on the floor that was clean of blood. It was..

“Cold…” I muttered to myself before promptly passing out.
