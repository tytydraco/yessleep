I've decided to post a few more entries from the [Nightmare Journal](https://redd.it/1fcfrl8) I kept from that old abandoned house.  I've also started to do a little research into the place.  I want to learn more about this Adam fellow. Maybe see how he's doing.  Maybe he wants his journal back.  I know I should just let it go but I can't; There's something unnerving about the entries.  Not just how they're written but how it makes me feel when I read them. 

Fortunately, I ran into my uncle Joe yesterday, he was over visiting my dad.  Joe lives way out in the county and only comes into town for groceries and to catch up with family.  He's mostly retired now, and has a host of health problems.  He was a hard worker but also a hard drinker, and both are catching up to him.  I just happened to be over at my parents place helping them with some yard work when he came over.  I asked him about that one house we had worked on and this is what he had to say about it.

“Yeah, that house up on Broke Neck Ridge, I remember it. That one was a real son-of-a-bitch. One of those jobs that seems simple, but ends up being weird iron.”

So, for reference, my uncle is not superstitions.  He doesn't believe in ghosts or demons or the supernatural at all, but he does have some strange ideas about houses. When he says a house is “weird iron” what he is saying is that the house is constantly having things go wrong with it.  A house that has weird iron is a money pit.  You'll fix two things and three more things will break.  It's a never-ending treadmill of repairs and replacements.  Your only hope is to get it as fixed up as possible to sell and dump it quickly.

I have the address, and the previous owners name – they had run off and left the house without saying a word to anyone.  The bank repossessed the house,where my uncle had bought it at auction.  I'm going to do a little digging and see what I can find out, about both the property and the family, and maybe, about Adam.

I'm staring at a old mine lamp that's slowing dying.  I know I will die in the dark soon.  We all die in the dark.  I hear miners panicked yelling, muffled by distance. I can almost make out what the miners are screaming, but it's never clear enough to understand.  There's another sound as well, a grinding, crushing sound. I think the mine is collapsing. Everything smells like smoke. I wake up feeling like I can't breathe. Sometimes the pills work, sometimes they don't.  

**14 Sep** 

We came out of the water, and we go back into to the water.  I don't know what this means.  I was in a boat, and there was something pallid, huge and formless slowly moving under the ocean.  I can smell the sea.  That's all I can remember. Not so bad since they changed my dosage.

**19 Sep**

I'm in a old industrial building. Brick walls, naked incandescent bulbs and a dirt floor. A hand painted wooden sign, I think it says "Legion Meat Packing." 

I am standing on a walkway beside a narrow wooden chute.  There are pigs being guided though the chute by rough looking men wearing blood-stained aprons and overalls and holding long rods with hooks at the end.  The men have rheumy, dead looking eyes.  Everything smells like blood, sweat and shit.  In the distance, I hear the squeal of pigs in horrific pain, and rhythmic chanting.

I move down to the end of the walkway to see where the pigs are being herded to. It's a large open room, with hooks hanging from a tall arched ceiling. The room is filled with cacophony of chanting men, screaming animals, and the grinding and rumbling of some massive machine. The pigs are being herded onto a conveyor belt that goes into a archway in one of the walls. A pale white face has been crudely painted around it, with the archway as the “mouth”.  It's filled with grinding, spinning gears and blades and it quickly reduces the pigs to a spray of wet gore that drains into some unknown darkness.

The noise is deafening.  The grinding and thrumming of the machine, the squealing of the pigs, and the men chanting.  Over and over again they chant, with religious, almost cult-like devotion.

“Pigs go in, meat comes out.  Pigs go in, meat comes out.”

I don't know how, but I am suddenly on the conveyor belt.  I am being crushed by the surrounding wall of porcine flesh.  I scream for help, but it comes out as a pig's squeal.

“I'm not a pig!” I try to scream, as I'm carried closer and closer to the gaping maw.  “I'm not a pig!” I yell, as the animals in front of me are torn to shreds.  “I'm not a pig!”
The machine takes me into it's mouth...

I wake up.  My chest hurts.  I can't breathe.  I have to go back to the doctor. I can't go on like this.


And that's it for now.  If you'd like me to keep going with these journal entries I will, I'll also let you guys know anything I find out about the author.
