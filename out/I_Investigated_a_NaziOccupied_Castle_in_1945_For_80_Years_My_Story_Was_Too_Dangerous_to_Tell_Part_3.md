\[NSFW/Trigger Warning\] By this point in my grandfather’s journal, I had clearer insight into his mind than I ever had growing up. As close as my bond with him was, as generous and wise as he was, something about him was always opaque. Looking back on the man now, I might finally know why. His experience in Wewelsburg changed what he understood about the world and the human race’s place in it. For the rest of his life, no one else he knew or would ever meet was going to share that understanding. Despite the large extended family he eventually had, in a way, it must have made him a very lonely man. I had to read further to learn what he knew about the Hyperboreans and to what extent they were real or not. It was something I had certainly never heard of. Also telling was the lack of information available on Captain Pettit and Operation Oxcart. Operation Paperclip was declassified decades ago, so why not Oxcart? I discovered that Oxcart was later reused for the name of the program that developed the A-12 and SR-71 spy planes. Did the United States government paper over an operation to utilize the Nazi occult with another classified program? And if so, what did they want to hide?

United States Army, 4th Infantry Division  
July 21, 1945  
Pettit and Arizin handcuffed Müller’s arms behind his back. Müller did not resist. He insisted on taking us up to a chamber on the fifth floor of the southwest tower. Pettit went up first, leading the way with his M1 ready. Arizin and I followed behind him, bookending Müller between us. I kept my Smith & Wesson revolver trained on him in case he tried anything. I was afraid of him after everything I had heard about the Solar Man since I first stepped foot in Germany a year ago. That was before I had ever heard the word Hyperborean. Now I wasn’t just afraid, I was terrified. I don’t know why Pettit let him keep the pagan mask on. Despite his confident demeanor, maybe even the captain feared removing it. Müller had another tattoo, this one down the middle of his back. It looked like a tree trunk with two cross pieces atop it that could have been leaves, wings, or the hilt guard of an ornamental dagger. The Nazis abhorred tattoos. I wondered why Müller was different.   
The southwest tower was not as wide as the north tower with its crypt and generals’ hall. Müller’s chamber at the top of it was a barren, circular room with four small windows. By 1620 hours storm clouds had darkened the sky. We sat Müller down on the floor in the center. Several of us surrounded Müller while Arizin took others back downstairs to search the remaining chambers and corridors. Pettit examined Müller’s few belongings. There was a simple cot, a leather carry bag, a stack of Wehrmacht field rations, and a pile of strange, old and new books. There was a ceremonial SS dagger and a Walther P.38 pistol. Pettit picked up the gun and ejected the magazine. It was loaded, but Müller had chosen not to use it. Müller’s eyes stared up at me through the holes of his mask. I don’t know what I expected, but they were merely human.   
Pettit crouched in front of Müller. “A lot of men have been after you for a very long time, Wolfgang, but now I have you. I don’t know how much you’ve heard, but everyone who mattered to you is finished. Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels…dead. Göring, Dönitz, Keitel, Jodl, Speer, Kaltenbrunner, Hess…all in our custody. Surrendering was the right call. This is where it all ends for you. What I’ll determine is how. You can either be useful to us or you can join the rest of them. I know all about what this castle was planned to be for the SS. What are you doing back in Wewelsburg?”  
The mask tilted sideways while Müller studied Pettit back. “Men can be finished, but a movement never dies. To The Führer, National Socialism was only a political movement. He was mistaken. It is far, far more than that. It is a spiritual movement. I’m here to complete it.”  
“What do you mean?”  
“The war took time and resources away from our research at Wewelsburg. Had it not, we would have accomplished what I am doing now years ago.”  
Pettit smirked. “You don’t expect me to believe you were against the war, do you?”  
“Of course not. The war was necessary. But it is a paradox that fighting it ensured we could not accomplish the true, spiritual goal.”  
“You came back to perform a ritual, didn’t you?” Pettit picked up several of the books. “See, I’ve read these too. Rosenberg, Von List, Blavatsky. I know what you’re trying to do. That’s what this mask is for. What happens if I remove it?”  
Müller cocked his head again. “I would remove it for you. If it were not for these handcuffs.”  
“And we can’t have that now, can we?” said Pettit. He took the mask in both hands and lifted it from Müller’s head.   
The most striking thing about his face was how forgettable it was. While a prototypical Aryan in every way, there was nothing about his eyes, nose, or jaw to distinguish him. It was the look of a German everyman who would disappear in a crowd if not for his height and build. One expects to feel something cold when confronted with the face of evil, but in Wolfgang Müller I felt nothing at all. Pettit passed the mask to Chaplain Sharman.  
“Disappointed, Captain?” asked Müller. “You expected a monster?”  
“Beware they who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves,” quoted Sharman.  
Arizin returned, holding something in each hand. “We found these,” he said, placing them on the floor in front of Pettit. The first object was another pagan mask similar to but different from Müller’s. “There are eleven more, just like his. And then there’s this.” He nudged the second object with his boot. It was a solid gold cauldron 20 inches across and 12 inches deep. It had human-like faces as well as trees and strange animals forged into it. Pettit and his men traded knowing glances. It seemed they knew what it was while Schayes and I did not. Müller stared at it, bittersweet.  
“You and your men tried to contact spirits of the Hyperboreans, didn’t you? But something went wrong,” Pettit continued. “We’ve found your men and they were in bad shape. What happened, Müller?”  
Müller spoke, taking turns looking each one of us in the eye. “There is so much you Christian men do not understand. Christianity is an evil arisen from Judaism that reduced we Aryans to slaves and made us weak and docile. I have knowledge, memories of my Teutonic and Saxon ancestors. I was there when the Christian king Charlemagne drove them from their homes and destroyed their customs. Now their cross, the great Irminsul, the blood and soil cross which I wear upon my back, will topple the Christ’s cross again as the German people rediscover the pagan gods the Church suppressed. I was there in Hyperborea before the ice swallowed it. The Hyperboreans perceived the natural truths of the universe and took their wellness from the elements of the earth. I have their memories too, memories of a people in perpetual gladness and contentment in a place where the sun did not set and nourished the land all year.”  
“You’re wrong,” I interjected, taking the others by surprise. “The place you speak of is impossible. I know a thing or two about astronomy. The sun doesn’t set at the poles only between the spring and fall equinoxes. It’s below the horizon for half the year.”  
Müller smiled, then let it gradually fade. “No, Lieutenant. It’s you who are wrong as all of these men will now learn. When the sun falls below the horizon, it begins the period of astronomical twilight. The sun may be hidden, but its rays nourished the polar sky yet! Until November, until astronomical dusk when it reaches 18 degrees beneath the horizon! The continent saw but 77 days of night when the Hyperboreans slept until astronomical dawn in January!”  
I had no response. I felt discredited and humiliated in front of the other soldiers. How could I have let a murderous SS war criminal lecture me like that? Pettit and his men stood and listened. Rebuking Müller didn’t help their mission. They were here to study him.  
 Müller pontificated on how ancient Greek philosophers Hesiod, Herodotus, and Pindar wrote about Hyperborea in the seventh and fifth centuries BC. He invoked Pliny the Elder, who referred to it as, ‘the land beyond the north wind.’ Müller took great satisfaction in demonstrating the terrifying breadth of his knowledge. He referenced Jean Sylvain Bailly, a French mathematician and astronomer I had never heard of who linked Hyperborea through Atlantis to Classical Europe by the process of diffusionism where all technology and customs shared a common origin and spread outward. With the destruction of the rest of the Nazis, Müller believed he alone was on the cusp of bringing on a supernatural revelation that would possess the German people and transform society into a monolithic, eternal structure.   
It started to rain. Wind and water began to batter the castle. Müller’s voice grew bolder and throatier and the sense of dread he instilled in me grew worse. “During the ice age the Aryan built his spiritual and bodily strength in the hard fight against nature, arising differently than other races who lived without this bountiful struggle. We know all these people, from Hyperboreans to the Teutons, held one sign in common: the symbol of the sun. Their societies were built on light. Human culture and civilization are inseparably bound with the presence of the Aryan. If he dies or declines, the dark veils of an age without culture will descend on this globe.”  
It was appalling and terrifying and became hard to listen to. Pettit told Arizin and I to come down to the floor below with him. “What do you think?” Pettit asked.  
“He’s a zealot,” said Arizin. “A staunch Nazi to the end. I think seeing everything he worked for destroyed did something to him. He’s not right in the head, even for one of them, wearing that mask around like that. Having nothing left only made him double down.”  
“I made us all look weak in front of him. I’m sorry, Captain,” I said.  
Arizin looked me in the eye. “We won the fucking war. He lost.”  
“Mikan, do you connect anything he said with what you saw in the villagers?” Pettit asked.  
“Müller’s talk about the sun and the earth’s elements could explain the physical deformities some of the villagers have. They’re actually becoming the nature around them. He said the Hyperboreans were perpetually glad and content. That’s just how the villagers act. They’re deteriorating and changing, but all they can say is how well they are.” I paused and thought back. “The only time when they didn’t was when one of the women, Sabina, cried for her missing children. She was distraught and coherent, but only briefly…when the sunlight was gone.” It all began to come together for me. “That’s what Müller said too. Hyperborea was only dark for 77 days after astronomical dusk. The villagers went mad and fell asleep once the sun was 18 degrees below the horizon. When we isolated Sabina from the rest, she briefly became sane. At astronomical dusk.”  
“I’ve heard enough to come up with a theory,” said Pettit. “Chaplain!” he shouted up the stairwell. Sharman came down and joined us. Pettit told him, “Show Lieutenant Mikan what’s in your pack.”  
Sharman took the canvas field pack off his shoulder. From inside, he removed a second metal cauldron nearly identical to the gold one Arizin found in the castle. This one was made of silver and showed heavy signs of wear. It had the same strange faces and iconography but was clearly much older. Sharman explained it to me. “This is the Gundestrup Cauldron, made in the iron age around 300BC by the Celts or another ancient Teutonic people who used it for ritualistic practices. It was discovered in a peat bog in Denmark in 1891. The Danes kept it out of the Nazis’ hands once they learned Heinrich Himmler was looking for it. The gold cauldron you saw upstairs is a near-reproduction forged by a German metallurgist named Otto Gahr. Himmler couldn’t get his hands on the real thing, so he settled for a replica.”  
“Unfortunately for him and Müller, it didn’t work,” said Pettit. “The SS was unable to finish their plans for the castle before the war ended. What I propose is that Müller located the Gahr Cauldron and brought it back to Wewelsburg Castle with him. Then on June 21st, the day of the summer solstice, he and his men performed a pagan ritual to contact spirits of the Hyperboreans. But without the Gundestrup Cauldron, the real one, something went wrong. Instead of resurrecting a Hyperborean, containing it, and communicating with it, the spirit of one was released and went on to plague all the people living in the surrounding village.”  
“It infested in them like witchcraft,” said Arizin.  
“But not the Jewish sisters,” I added. “Edith and Ella weren’t affected.”  
“Maybe the Hyperboreans can only connect to those with Aryan blood,” said Pettit.  
“What about Müller? It harmed his men worst of all. Why would it leave him untouched?” I asked.  
“Any ideas, Chaplain?” asked Pettit.  
Sharman thought about it. “Not to equate a Hyperborean with the Lord, but God often spared chosen men while afflicting entire tribes around them. If the Hyperboreans were real, perhaps they still need him for something.”  
By this point I was desperate to be done in Wewelsburg. I had followed my orders to investigate the village and report what I found to my general who placed the situation in more capable hands. I was in over my head and I wanted to leave. “What now, Captain? Are you going to take Müller in for war crimes charges?” I asked.  
“That isn’t my objective, Lieutenant,” Pettit said. “My orders are to determine if there are real-world applications for the Nazi occult before the Soviets do. We have the Gundestrup Cauldron and we have Müller. I’m going to make him perform the ritual again.”  
Captain Pettit organized the rest of his men and informed them of the plan to repeat the ritual to contact the Hyperboreans. I formally requested he allow Schayes and I to leave and return to our unit. Pettit denied it. He did agree to my second idea. Everyone in Pettit’s squad seemed confident that nothing would happen to them with Chaplain Sharman there. Schayes and I were less confident. The others had not seen the villagers to the extent we had. I proposed we allow Edith and Ella to come into the castle. They had been immune to the effects of the first attempted ritual. I would never ask them to actually participate, but I thought they could monitor us from outside the crypt. If they were willing.  
At 2040 hours I drove through the pouring rain with Schayes to the sisters’ cottage. Countless villagers were out in the streets behaving just as they had before their rabid panic on our first night in Wewelsburg. They gathered in masses, all facing the waning twilight to the west, indifferent to the rain. It was twenty-five minutes until dusk. We parked at the cottage just as Ella ran out the front door carrying a basket covered from the rain by a tarp. She stopped when she saw the car.  
“What is it, Ella? Where’s your sister?” I asked.  
Her demeanor was flustered, her tone grim. “It’s Margrit. Her baby is coming. Edith is with her. I ran home to get supplies.”  
I saw it was urgent. “Get in. I’ll take you,” I told her. Schayes helped Ella into the car. I explained to him in English. “Margrit’s the woman with the fetus budding outside her body…the one with the tree branch growing through her insides.” It was the last thing we needed to be concerned with right now, but Schayes and I both felt a responsibility to help if we even could.  
Edith was surprised to see us when we entered Margrit’s cottage. I didn’t want to tell them about the upcoming ritual just yet. Margrit was in the midst of the strangest labor anyone had ever witnessed or heard of. The fetus had grown visibly since I had last seen it just one day ago. It was writhing inside the thick, translucent layer of veiny skin growing like a seed pod from its mother’s abdomen. A small tear was forming in the skin pod and a trickle of greenish fluid leaked onto the floor. Margrit herself was clearly in pain, though unable to speak or even move due to the branch growing down her throat and out her rear. Her eyes rolled back in her head while she gagged and twitched.   
“This is what we’re supposed to help that Nazi bastard resurrect? This is what Pettit wants to get before the Soviets so badly?” Schayes lamented.  
I could not help but agree. I feared neither Müller nor Pettit, nor any of us understood what we were meddling with. But right now, none of that was our concern.  
“I brought scissors, a knife, bandages, needles, thread, and clean blankets,” Ella told Edith, emptying the basket onto the table.   
“What do we do?” I asked Edith.  
“I don’t know…” she replied, picking up the scissors and eyeing the growing tear in the skin pod.  
Margrit kicked her legs and tried to turn her body. Her eyes rolled forward toward the door.  
“Hold her still!” Edith shouted.  
“She wants to go in the street with the others,” said Ella.  
Schayes checked his watch. “Two minutes to dusk.”  
I relayed it to the sisters in German. We didn’t know what would happen if it couldn’t, but we all sensed the baby needed to come out before the villagers erupted in their nightly panic. Margrit kicked and moved again. I held her legs down while Ella and Schayes grabbed her arms and torso.  
“She’ll die if that branch breaks inside of her,” I realized aloud.   
“I’m going to try to cut the baby out,” said Edith.   
We kept Margrit as still as we could while Edith gently inserted the scissors into the tear and slowly cut. More clear, greenish liquid spilled out, then Margrit’s own blood from the splitting skin.  
“You’re cutting too deep,” Ella said, worried.  
“I don’t know what else to do,” said Edith.   
None of us did. She cut along the length of the skin pod, bit by bit. Had we not needed to restrain Margrit, perhaps we could have cleaned the wound and stemmed the bleeding. But Edith’s forearms were soon awash with a mix of blood and green fluid. Then, suddenly, she reached inside the pod.  
“I have the baby’s head,” Edith announced. “I’m going to pull it out.”  
I clenched my teeth as I watched Edith’s hands move beneath the skin and grab the baby’s shoulders. Margrit suddenly stopped moving. I couldn’t tell if she was still breathing. Edith sat down and eased the baby out of the skin pod. Her clothes were now covered in the pod’s fluid. Then the baby was out. It was male. There was no umbilical cord. It was also completely silent. I thought it was dead at first. I think we all feared that. But then I saw it breathing. Its mouth opened and its arms and legs moved. But it didn’t cry. The silence of that moment was eerie in a different manner from everything else we had witnessed. Ella dried the baby off and wrapped it in a blanket. Edith laid down on the floor, relieved and exhausted.   
Then we heard the screams. The villagers outside shrieked and moaned. We saw their shadowy silhouettes out the window, running amok in the street. Dusk had fallen on Wewelsburg once again. Then Margrit lurched—and we heard a sharp crack.  
The branch growing through Margrit’s body had snapped. It startled us all. Her teeth bit into the bark and her limbs spasmed and went still. Blood began pooling in her cheek and dribbling out the corner of her mouth. More trickled down the vine at the end of the branch growing out her other end. None of us spoke.  
We washed up and gathered a short while later. Ella swaddled the baby, who was still eerily quiet. Edith had changed clothes. Schayes and I were now late getting back to the castle.   
I didn’t know what kind of reaction to expect from the sisters when I asked them about returning there with us. Ella especially was unsettled by the idea. I repeated that I was not in any way forcing or guilting them to comply. I said if they chose not to, I would drive away and none of us would ask them again. I even told them that after it was over, I would guarantee an army doctor would come to help the villagers. I knew only one of them could come. One had to stay with the baby. Ella chose to stay behind, while Edith agreed to come with us. Ella pleaded with her not to, but Edith was committed. Maybe she appreciated my kindness or she felt indebted to the U.S. Army for liberating Buchenwald and ridding them of the Nazis. Maybe she worried my promise to send a doctor was contingent on her agreement despite my insistence that it wasn’t. Regardless, she hugged Ella goodbye and got into the car.
