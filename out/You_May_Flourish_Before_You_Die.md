I remember that his name was strange, quite unlike anything I had ever heard of, especially being from the Northeast. And he didn’t look much like the other students at our college. His clothes were ragged, and seemingly barely put together. But he moved with a slow confidence when he transitioned from one of our classes to the next. He seemed to be happy in his loneliness. Occasionally, I’d see him outside the old brick science building, sitting there as the sun broke through the rolling autumnal clouds, as shadows ran across a very gaunt, fixed face. He rarely seemed to change his face. Now to think of it, he was a lot like some specter, and when I told my friends about that thought, it soon became an inside joke. One pal would say to me, “I saw that ancient ghost again, moving through the hall from the bathroom!” while another asked “How often do ghosts go to the bathroom.” 

I can’t say I felt too happy when I’d see Lazarus. We shared some classes. And he’d just sit there, in a manner that was simply quiet and stoic. Even the professors avoided conversation with him. They just seemed to nod when returning his exams. I decided that one afternoon, I’d go speak to Lazarus. We shared an evening class, and I began to notice that we took the same path back to the dormitory. I caught up with him this one night. A thick fog had lain over the land, for it was mid-November now and winter crept towards our collegiate hamlet. 

“Hey, Lazarus, right?” I began, extending my hand. He nodded politely and replied with my name. The walk back wasn’t too long, and we simply just traded words on our shared class and the professor who taught it. Lazarus’ judgment seemed to not only be fair, but he carried the wisdom of an almost ancient sage. In a simple sentence, he seemed to summarize the world. Upon our entry to the dormitory, he shook my hand again and we both concluded with a “See you around.” 

He was unlike any person I had come across before when we began to spend more time together as the fall semester continued. Most of what I could extract from him in conversation was that he wasn’t a fan of the weather here in New England, and the noise, and the amount of wealth, and he thought some of the people were arrogant or rude, but he never said he missed home. Despite his critiques, he seemed content with his new surroundings, it was more just making the right sense of them. I brought him into my circle of friends I had made that semester. Once a specter, now turned human, the characteristic of Lazarus that we all seemed to like the most was his ability to party. He told us he was from ‘somewhere down south, in the mountains’ and that it would seem like a foreign country to us, but that we’d like the moonshine and the bourbon. He had an aptitude for being able to locate marijuana as well, we were never quite sure where he got it from. We weren’t sure if his stoicism was one of these ‘Southern values’, but he kept a straight face when he told us that he planned to stay at the dormitory throughout Thanksgiving to ‘get loaded’. 

I asked him if he wanted to come over for our family Thanksgiving. I didn’t live too far away. He said ‘no’. And when we all returned, the weeks of school before heading home for Winter Recess, we still continued to drink bourbon and smoke the Lazarus grass. Back in September, when we all began at this university, Lazarus was the last person I saw and thought to myself that he’d only skyrocket in popularity among our dormitory. Yet, when we spoke one evening, he had mentioned, with that straight face, that he was excited to largely stay at the dormitory once again over break, with a brief half-week visiting some distant aunt up in Maine. I asked him if he wanted to come stay with me, or any one of the folks in our friend group’s homes over the break. He said no. I asked if he was planning on going home. He said no. I asked him why. He said that the place from which he came was boring, that it was dead, that there was nothing down there except trouble. We shared a shot of bourbon before my parents picked me up and we buzzed off in the car. 

I didn’t see him much in January or February. Occasionally, he’d swing by our small parties and have a drink or two, but then he’d swiftly head out. I asked him one night, when he stopped by, if everything is alright, and he said he hated the cold. He said that as much as he didn’t want to return down southways, he would over the Spring recess. He said it in a low tone, like a dog humming, hungry on an empty stomach. It was only a few weeks away. He then told us also that where he’s from, that is where he got his grass. He said that the laws down there aren’t so puritan as up here. Most folks didn’t care as long as you kept to yourself. I began to wonder what kind of place produced Lazarus. I asked him if I could go with him, and he said ‘no’. When I leveraged that I would take him in my car, especially so that he wouldn’t now have to hitchhike to the bus station, he said alright - but we were just going for a few days. 

“You’re a man who likes risk if you come down to the mountains,” Lazarus said as we skidded just past New York, making our way down South. “People down here…it is a different world. But we’ll be alright. We just mind our own business, and we’ll be alright.” I didn’t say anything. I kept my eyes on the road. It rained heavily. I fiddled with the dial on the radio as we passed through various state lines. Soon, it seemed as though we were in a place where ‘New York’ was just an imagined image. It was flat at first, but the shadow of the mountains began to loom. It was like a giant wave ready to consume the sticks they raised and called homes. And these homes became less and less, especially as we began to climb. 

“Want to stop for a cigarette? We should now before it gets dark. Easy to lose your way up here, best we floor it to my place.” Lazarus says, staring inquisitively at the road ahead. We get out of the car. A consuming gray haze reduces the visibility of where we parked to far less than a mile. I filter a cigarette out of my pack, and hand it over to Lazarus. He leans over, lights it, and passes the lighter back to me. 
“This must be gorgeous when the fog clears up here, we’ve been gaining some serious altitude.” I say, with the butt end of my cigarette turning my words into a half-mumble. 
“Yeah, not too far now, a little more ways up the mountain. Then we grab our shit, we get everything into the house.” he pauses, and then looks to me, “You’re going to like my place, it’s old, but I take good care of it.”

And soon we’re off again, the car engine humming as we climb the mountain. 

The house is old, but as Lazarus said, it was in great shape. As we pulled up in the car, as night just began to pull its curtain over the mountain, he gets out of the vehicle and hauls our belongings inside. On one side of the home is a thick forest. In the evening breeze and cool mist, the trees sway as if they all seem to perform an ancient dance. The forest is alive, with insects humming and small creatures screeching that breaks the synchronized sway and ache of the swinging trees. 

“Hey!” Lazarus calls out in a muted tone. He stands on the old wooden front porch. “Let’s get our shit and move inside, man. I’ll take you ‘round tomorrow. Hopefully this damn fog will break.” And I move over to the car, and throw my duffle bag over my shoulder while slamming the car door closed. “Hey!” Lazarus calls out again in the same muted resistance, “Keep it down. We may be up on the mountain, but folks still live around here.” As I move closer to the porch, the sound of rushing water becomes present, and I can see a small river on the other end of the property, but not much beyond that, for the fog on the mountain is thick. “C’mon, now”, Lazarus has the door open, waiting for me to enter the home. 

The lights in the home are cold, and seem to flicker often. Lazarus says he prefers to use candles, so we light a few in the small kitchen area. I retrieve a bottle of bourbon from my bag. But he refuses, says that the first night here, maybe it is the altitude, is difficult to acclimate to. By candlelight, he gives me a brief tour of the home. The rooms are well decorated, but sparse. He shows me to my bedroom. It looks as though no one has been in there for years. Crosses and ceramic angels layered in dust occupy most of the shelves here. Lazarus continues the tour after I place down my duffel bag. “This here, this is the attic, it is my favorite room in the house. Spent a lot of time up here.” I ascend a few of the steps, and try to look around inside, with only the last light of the rainy day showing the silhouettes of trunks and maps. As I descend he tells me, sternly, “Remember the attic, my friend.” I was a bit nervous at this point, but upon the return to my room, I drank from the bourbon and stared in the dark room and listened to the primitive world outside. 

I woke up with a slight headache, and a knocking at my door. I yell out, “Just one second”, and swing open the wooden door. It’s very bright now, but the fog has yet to lift, but the little bit of rain that seemed to only leak from the sky has left. Lazarus looks as if he’s been waiting, but he seems excited, especially when he says, “Man, I can’t wait to show you my favorite breakfast spot.” We hop in the car, and begin descending down the mountain. The fog, like a watercolor palette of blended yellows and oranges, won’t allow the sun rays to fully break through its wall. As I rub my forehead, Lazarus begins speeding down the mountain quicker and quicker in my car. I tell him to take it slow. He says he’s just excited to get to town. What I initially imagined to be a five minute cruise turned into almost forty minutes of speeding down empty streets lined only with those tall, swaying trees. And finally, we seem to break out of the fog. I look in the mirror, and as we drive further in the sunrise, I can see the wall of the mountain. Even in the morning, it seems consumed by its own shadow. I turn forward as we move into a small town. Despite the warm spring sunshine, the town is a dismal limb of this world of Lazarus. A group of children smoke cigarettes in torn t-shirts as they seem to stare up at the mountain. A woman glares at us as we drive by, and I notice that she is pushing a shopping cart filled with some kind of soft padding. 

We pull into a largely empty lot. The diner that lay before my parked car is the cleanest building I’ve seen. As we step inside, the bell attached to the door rings, and a solemn woman looks up from her crossword. Lazarus waves limply. We sit on two stools towards the end, and she saunters over with a pot of black coffee. 
“Haven’t seen you around here in some time. You the O’Leary’s kid?” 
He nods, ushering forth his empty cup. 
“Where are your parents these days?” she asks, filling his cup with coffee that doesn’t seem to steam. 
“Florida.” Lazarus replies softly, redirecting his eye contact.  
I then move my cup towards the woman. She still looks at Lazarus. 
“Fastest family to move up that mountain and leave. I can say that.” 
A silence prevails, and she seems to switch her mood, and asks us what we’d like to eat. 

When our food comes, I can barely keep it together. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. I think about where else I could’ve gone for Spring Recess. I start to pester Lazarus, quietly. 
“I don’t like this town, and the mountain.”
He sips his coffee, “Me neither. You wonder why I told you not to come?”
I begin to raise my voice, “Why didn’t you tell me your parents moved to Florida? Why don’t they live up there anymore?” 
He replies back in his unexpressive, stern manner, “It’s a bad market. There used to be a big industry in this town. But it is gone. There’s no money here anymore, okay?” 
The volume grows between us with every response. 
“It’s not the poverty, Lazarus - there is something there.”
“What the hell are you talking about?”
I look away from Lazarus and the waitress, and two men in a nearby booth all stare at us. I go quiet immediately. Lazarus looks around, and then back to his coffee. 
In a low tone, the waitress says without a blink, “His folks were right to move. The devil lives up in the mountain. And the devil’s angels roam the land’up there. Turn men into bones.”

We drive further away from the diner, away from the town, and down a few hills. I can’t find the capability to speak anymore. 
“Look, man.” Lazarus begins before a sigh, “The sad truth is that around here, people are prone to believing in old folk tales and religious crap.” 
I say nothing as we continue down the road. 
“Look at me as an example, right. I never believed in that shit. Sure, it’s creepy to hear about. But folks need ways to explain their own dire situations, so they blame some shit on the mountain. It’s just a sad circumstance. My folks were lucky enough to move over to Florida.”
In a break among the tree-lined road, there appears a gas station. Lazarus pulls the car into the back lot, and says to me, “Look, buddy. I’m glad you came down here, alright? I’m going to turn what started as a weird morning into a good night. Alright? And then we split tomorrow, okay?”
I nod, sigh, and tell him, “Yeah, alright.” He steps out of the car, and returns a few minutes later. He throws up each one of his hands, with one being a case of beer, and the other what seems to be a bag of weed. 

He throws a few logs into a small stove fire pit he has out behind the back door. The fog is still there, but a breeze blows through the mountain, and after the second beer, the sound of the trees and the wildlife in those dark woods seems less threatening. Even if I can still picture the stare and repeat the words in my head of what the woman at the diner said earlier. But nonetheless now, I had made my proverbial bed. I did choose to come down here, and Lazarus was right. He’d lived up here on the mountain for a while now before attending school. He wasn’t foolish enough to return to some haunted place. It almost reminded me of the history of my New England. The Puritans, terrified of the woods, woods that were now all colonial homes. 

Now a few beers deep, the sway of the trees is almost hypnotic. And as I return from my bedroom with the bottle of bourbon, I’ve witnessed something I’ve never witnessed before. As he rolls his marijuana cigarette, Lazarus tells a story about fishing on the Mississippi one year with his father. His old man caught something too big, Lazarus says, and tipped the boat over. And for the first time, I witness Lazarus break with laughter. Over the primitive symphony just beyond the pines, we cheers and begin passing the joint, back and forth. And as we regale stories to one another from our first year of school, and suddenly, an empty look appears on Lazarus’ face. I ask if he’s been missing college, noting his change in behavior. He tells me to be quiet. I notice that the hums and haws, the screeches and coos, and even now, the crickets have all ceased their calls. It is just the sway of the trees in the fog, and nothing else. Lazarus is wide-eyed. 

Just then, a scream, no less than half a mile away from where we sat. Lazarus pours his beer out in the fire before saying in a hushed but direct tone, “Attic. Attic. Now, go. Now”. He lies low as we move quickly towards the house. The scream, again, echoes, now just a bit closer. The sound seems to make the pines themselves shiver. It is an indescribable, ancient, guttural call. I feel nothing but the sense of flight as we run low into the house, and Lazarus closes the door and says, “No lights. Attic, now. We need to move.” In the darkness, I can see almost nothing. I feel frantically for the ladder. We ascend the ladder upwards and he follows behind. He closes the hatch after we ascend, and sits on top of it. I whisper, “Lazarus?” and I begin to feel fear begin to melt my entire being. He responds back, “If you say nothing, if you stay quiet, we will be alright.” 

I can hear the door in the kitchen open, but I hear no footsteps follow. I cannot move. I can no longer feel my body. All I do is sit and stare. From a pale light that filters through the attic window, I can see that Lazarus has his eyes shut tight. We both jump as we hear the door slam shut. Lazarus looks at me, and shakes his head as if to say we’re still not in the clear. And after that, time keeps passing on, and we sit as statues, before Lazarus whispers, “I think we can go now.” I ask if he means to grab what we brought, throw it in the car, and drive far away from this mountain. He says we can leave at night, that we won’t make it. And I ask him what it was, and he simply says, “I do not know. But I’ve seen it before.” The more questions I ask, the more he stays silent. Still sitting upon the trapdoor hatch, he now leans his back against the wall and closes his eyes. I realize then that there is nothing I can do but wait until dawn, so I ask, “Can I at least lay down up here?” And he sorrowfully nods his head. 

I can’t sleep. I watch the pale light from the window just barely bloom more luminous as the sun breaks in the new day, and don’t look over to Lazarus until that familiar, yellow-orange hue seems to wipe the wall beside me. I don’t think he’s closed his eyes. He just stares forward, but he’s simply stuck within his own mind. I say to him in a soft tone, “Lazarus” and he exits the state he’s in, and looks at me with a sense of melancholy, “Yes?”. 
“Can we go now?” I ask. 
He nods solemnly, “Yes. We need to be quick. Last thing we do is turn on that car of yours.”

I nod. He moves slowly as he lifts the hatch, and drops his head below, looking around inquisitively. “We’re good,” he says. As we descend, I begin to ask about what happened, but he stops me before I can finish the following sentence and says, “Look. When we get in the car, when we descend the mountain, I will tell you everything I know. But most of what I know is that we must leave, now.” I nod, and begin to sprint towards the room where I had stayed the first night. As I begin to get closer, I notice long carvings upon the wall. As if someone dragged a knife deep into the wood, and carved as they made their way to the room where I stayed. And then, I hold my breath as I slowly push open the bedroom door. My nose is immediately met with a smell of something rotten. Several flies buzz. The ceramic angels have all been crushed, and the crosses lay upon the floor. I lean forward, retaining my footing to look upon the other side of the bed, but there is nothing. I grab my bag and run back towards the car. 

I can’t find Lazarus. His bag is on the front porch. He’s nowhere near the car. I run back towards the stove fire pit. The woods howl with wildlife. The fog seems thicker than usual. As I make my way towards the other side of the property, where the small river lay, I yell out, “Lazarus?”. As I near the river, the forest quiets, but now, the fog seems to blow away like smoke from an extinguished fire. It lifts quickly. There is no Lazarus near the river, and my eyes follow towards the other side, where a large dirt mound begins to reveal itself foot by foot as the fog dissipates. And finally, I can begin to see the sky. But a figure begins to appear from behind the mound. It begins with one, and others seem to follow. I stand there, completely frozen, as I watch them ascend to the top of the dirt mound. As they stand in file, I look at each one of their mangled, distorted faces. Their skin is carved with intricate designs. Their faces are almost human, but equally missing features. The one in the middle, standing tall, points his finger at me. One of the creatures falls to all fours and descends the embankment rapidly, making its way towards the river. I begin to flee. I rush up the hill, back towards the house. Upon the side of the porch sits Lazarus, with tears down his face as he says to me, “We should’ve never come here. Now, it’s too late.”
