I remember how I met the killer named Rapunzel a day ago, after school.



I walked to the street and saw some kind of crime scene.



“What happened? Was it a murder or an accident?” I asked the police officer.



“It was a murder incident, we are investigating the killer named ‘Rapunzel’” the officer replied.



“Rapunzel? You mean an ugly bastard dressed as a fairy tale princess?” I replied to him.



“no, it's… let's not talk about it” the officer told me that he will not talk about it.



“Did Rapunzel kill another person at night?” I heard a man talking to his friend when i'm passing by. 



“Yeah, I don't know How long she's going to get captured?” he replied to his friend.



I decided to ask them who Rapunzel is.



“Excuse me, can you guys Tell me who is the killer from that incident?. I asked them



“You never Heard of her? The killer who called herself “Rapunzel”. i Heard It from some elders telling this story a long time ago” the Man replied.



“Wait… did you Said “her”, i- i thought i was some Freaky girl dressed as a Princess or a man with very long hair.” I said what I thought.



“You really thought to think about it, anyway the legend tells about a girl who was born with demonic supernatural hair, her parents died years ago and got adopted by an elder lady, then she grew up and killed the elder lady, one day, they decided execute her and burning her to hell, then at night, rapunzel haunts in the streets of yokohama but if you see her at night, she will kill ya.” the man told me about the story of rapunzel.



“Wait, she's a ghost now?” I asked them.



“Yup, she's now a ghost” the other man replied.



“Thanks for the information, oh and uh i gotta go now” I thanked them and left them behind. 



“Also don't forget to beware of rapunzel!.” the man said loudly when i was leaving and i made an “ok” hand sign to him. 

After hearing that scary story about Rapunzel, I kept walking down the street, trying to get the idea of ​​a ghost girl killing people at night out of my head. That's when my phone vibrated in my pocket. It was a text message from my dad:

“Eiji, can you stop by the store and pick up some things? I think we’re running out of recipes, and I won't be able to go out today”.

I sighed. After everything I'd heard about that murderer, I just wanted to get home and forget about it. But shopping was the last thing I needed to do before heading home.

I arrived at the supermarket without any problems and started to pick up the items from the list my father had sent me. The place was practically empty, which was normal for that time of night. The silence was only broken by the sound of my footsteps and the rustling of the bags as I put the groceries in the cart.

That was when, suddenly, in the next aisle, I saw something that made me freeze for a moment. A girl with a hat. She was standing, almost motionless, next to the shelves. She had extremely long black hair that almost touched the floor, but what scared me the most was the fact that her hair looked... spiky, as if each strand was a needle.

I tried to pretend I hadn't noticed her, turning my attention back to the products on the shelf, but I couldn't help but look again. The woman was still there, staring at me with a blank stare, and I felt a chill run down my spine.

I finished picking up everything I needed from the list and headed straight for the checkout, trying to act normal. My heart was racing, and I felt like I was being watched. But the girl wasn't following me. In fact, she looked like just another student, dressed in a school uniform and looked like a hikikomori, completely oblivious to my presence.



As the cashier scanned my groceries, I risked one last glance behind me, trying to make sense of what I had seen. But the aisle was empty. Had I imagined it?

“'Thank you and have a good night” the cashier said, as I grabbed the bags and hurried out of the store. I tried to convince myself that it was just a coincidence. “She must be just a normal girl…” I thought to myself, trying to ignore the chill that was still crawling up my spine. But deep down, a disturbing idea wouldn't leave me alone:



“What if that girl was really Rapunzel?”



I ran home as fast as I could, barely looking back. When I finally arrived, my father was in the living room, watching TV. He looked at me with a surprised expression.



“You got here so fast” he commented, with a raised eyebrow.



“Oh, yes… the store was empty” I replied, trying to hide the slight tremor in my voice as I placed the bags on the table. For a moment, I thought about telling him what I had seen, but decided against it. He would probably laugh or say it was just my imagination.



After a weird day, I lay down on the bed and prepared to sleep. But suddenly, a soft, almost sing-song voice came from outside: 'Handsome\~' My body froze. That voice sounded familiar, so I slowly got up and opened the window. Down below, I saw the girl from the market earlier. Now, in the dim light of the night, her hair seemed even longer, like a real Rapunzel's, falling almost to the ground.



'Handsome boy\~, handsome boy\~, please let me into your house\~' she repeated, with a disturbing smile.



'Don't think. Get out of here!' I shouted, trying not to let my fear show it.



That moment I realized, that girl was rapunzel.



I took a deep breath, trying to ignore the discomfort that the girl was causing me outside. But then, I heard something that made my heart race: the same voice, only now much closer.



“Handsome boy\~, I'm closer than you think\~.”



Before I could react, the window to my room slowly opened. Strands of long, spiky black hair stretched up to the second floor as if they had a life of their own. And there she was, hovering outside the window, smiling sinisterly.



I couldn't move. In the blink of an eye, she was inside my room. With a quick movement, she slammed both hands on the wall, blocking any escape route for me.



Her smile seemed to widen, and the sweet, menacing voice whispered again: “Aren't you going to invite me to stay, handsome boy\~?”.



In my terror, my eyes fell on a lighter that was sitting on my counter. Without thinking twice, I reached out and grabbed it. With one swift movement, I lit the lighter and brought it close to the strands of thorny hair that were curling around me. Her hair began to burn, and a high-pitched scream echoed through the room.



Rapunzel immediately recoiled, letting go of her hair and backing away through the window. She fell outside, screaming in pain and rage as she disappeared into the darkness.



I stood there, panting, holding the lighter with shaking hands. I didn't know what she was or why she chose me, but one thing was certain: I survived. At least... for now.



The next day, i went to school but with a little surprise, rapunzel is in my classroom, calm and quiet, but i realize she is a student from my classroom and the ancient rapunzel gave birth before she dies.

i was having no fear but she started looking at me and i made an positive hand and a smile to her, but she started less angry and ignored me.

the rapunzel might be an family assassin type generation, but know her name... is yomika ito.

THE END
