They didn’t deserve that. They don’t deserve that. I don’t deserve this. No one does. The thing is, I was never close with my parents. I mean I loved them and had no problems hanging out around each other. We just were never close you know? There was always a distance that we never bothered to close.

So, when I moved away to uni, I didn’t look back. There wasn’t even much to look back to. My hometown wasn’t even that. It was just a collection of small houses that had happened to be built at the intersection of two roads. I mean sure our town appeared on the map, but that’s just because they had to put a name there. It was a nowhere place with nothing of worth. Except my family.

University was hard. I mean obviously it was hard academics-wise, but the change from living amongst the same seven families my entire life to a city with hundreds of thousands gave me whiplash. But still, I thrived. I clawed my way up with everything I had to escape from where I had come from. Even though some of my peers doubted me and others whispered “trailer trash” behind my back, I proved them wrong. I was better than them, not through some trust fund, but through my own hard work. I tried at every opportunity to forget my past, including leaving my parents behind.

When summer break came around and I had no other plans, I decided that I would visit home. I don’t know why I decided to go back. It’s not like I had any reason to suspect anything was different. I hadn’t even messaged my folks in the eight months since my mom’s birthday. I just found myself making the long drive back home in the midst of a summer heatwave with nothing but empty fields in every direction. Anyway, I eventually arrived just outside the boundary separating my “town” from the endless farmland and had to slow my car to a halt. There was a concrete barrier blocking the entire road from being used. The only thing indicating that the road stopped so abruptly was a sign posted on the top of the barrier: “Dead End”.

I had to drive into the ditch to get around the blockade, somehow getting my car stuck in the process. I swore to the sky and was reminded how much I hated this place. I should have taken that as a sign to leave, to think that maybe the barrier was there for a reason and that someone knew. Someone had to know. Still, I pressed forward, determined to not let this awful place get the better of me. The town was quiet. Not a single sound other than the windchimes and some faint noise carried by the wind. It had always been quiet but somehow, I knew it was different. There were definitely more trees in the front yards of my neighbours than I remembered. I also noticed that there was what seemed to be an empty ambulance parked in front of a house at the other end of the street. Silently sitting with its doors open and its sirens off.

When I let myself into my old house, the only sound that I could now hear was the static from the old radio my dad used to listen to the news with. The faint aroma of lavender also filled my nostrils. It wasn’t dark in the house, quite the opposite. It was bright. Every curtain was opened, and every light was turned on showing how dusty the house had become. It also meant I could see everything. My father sat in his old reclining chair facing out to the backyard with his back to me. It was almost right out of a greeting card. If not for the shallow wheezing, I could hear from him.

When I rushed over to make sure he was ok, I saw the front half of his body. It looked like his skin had melted in the chair, rooting him in place unable to move. Thin tendrils made of flesh and muscle stretched out of his feet in front of him, covering the carpet in a slick bloody flowerbed. Every inch of the front half of my dad’s body bloomed outward, stretching into the sunlight to try and get as much nutrients as possible. His skin burst open from what looked like boils, unfolding into petals and pistils. Some sprouted out of his orifices, growing and growing and growing. Grasping for the sun outside the window.

I puked and I screamed. I thought my dad had died and I had not even known. I wish. When I looked at where his eyes had been, between the skin leaves and throbbing bulbs, I saw him looking at me. And I saw fear. Those eyes that I had tried to even forget the colour of begged me for help. No matter what had to be done to stop the pain.

I ripped at the flowers and roots, trying to get him free but his flowering skin shuddered and he squelched out a small, muffled moan through a throat full of flowers. It had hurt him. It hurt him to simply be alive. I fumbled to find my phone in my pocket to dial 911 but it didn’t seem to go through. All I heard was the dial tone and the faint sound of windchimes on the other end of the line. I looked around the rest of the house to try and find something to help him. I tried the bleach under the kitchen counter but that only seemed to pleasure the flowers. Searching in the dining room I saw a lighter next to my mother’s birthday cake. Now rotting with small blossoming flies sticking out of the fuzzy frosting.

 It wasn’t long until I found what I assumed was my mother. She was outside in the back garden grimly enough. She had grown into a sprawling tree, her bones splintering into branches that stretched into the sky. Her bark scabbed over, dripping with sap and puss. She resembled a cherry tree, with raw pink wounds budding into flowers. She was also alive, for however much I wish it weren’t true. She managed to even stutter out telling me to kill her.

No one could help. Every one of my neighbours’ houses held the same thing. Now seeing the trees outside for what they really were I rushed past every house I could, hoping and searching for anyone to help me or my parents. There were dozens of flowerbeds littering the lawns, with flowering arms reaching out in the sky asking for help and sunlight. One of the most disturbing sights was the playset that the Evans had owned, now wrapped in vines.

One of my neighbours, who I think was named Ted had it worst. It had taken me a while to find him as he was in his basement at the time. It was dark and fine particles obscured the effects of my phone’s flashlight. Still, through my coughing and blinking to get the dust out of my face, I eventually found what was Ted. What Ted is? He had collapsed into a heap of flesh, nothing being able to take root in the concrete floor of the unfinished basement. The flowers that covered him had wilted and shriveled, gangrene and necrotic tissue covering his entire body. He didn’t even have a face anymore. His eyes unraveled into white lilacs and his tongue uncoiled into something similar to a grapevine. Every part of it blossomed to try and uselessly grasp at the sunlight that was not there. I think it hurt him to be away from the light more than it hurt the others inside it.

I didn’t care, I had come down to Ted’s basement for another reason and I had found it. I snatched the gasoline and ran back to my parent’s house. It took me a while to thoroughly cover the house with enough for me to be certain, using up the entire can and praying that someone else would come along to help my neighbours. Then, I used my candle lighter to set my childhood home on fire, waiting and making sure that my parents were thoroughly burned. The windchimes still rang as I heard the willow tree that we had never planted behind the house weep.

 It was as I started to walk away, certain that the house was thoroughly burning that I tripped over my own foot. When I looked down, I saw that my shoe had split open, with thin tendrils digging into the grass beneath me. I scrambled to try and get up, ripping the thin strands of nerves out of the ground in excruciating pain, but before I could do anything I realized my back was now leeching into the ground as well. Every movement I made to try and get up only pulled on my nervous system, shooting pain worse than anything I’ve ever felt through my body. Even as I coughed up blood and felt my throat expanding, I couldn’t do anything but sit there and cry.

Pustules have started to appear all over my body, eagerly waiting to pop and embrace the sun. It hurts to breathe; the insides of my lungs have bloomed already and scratch at every breath. My throat is full of roots and petals, so I can’t even call for help anymore. I’ve managed to type this though. The roots in my hand may have burrowed into my phone, but it has worked long enough for me to do this. I’m glad I could help my parents. I will soon bloom and smell of lavender. I hope someone comes soon; someone must know. Whether it’s the CDC or the government. Someone has to prune me or I will grow into a [meadow](https://www.reddit.com/r/CursesAndBoons/comments/180iwt6/welcome_to_cursesandboons/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
