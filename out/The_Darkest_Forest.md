I arrived in a forest, in torn clothes. I got up and looked around. I didn't find any path or road that I could walk on. I started walking straight ahead. I hoped that someday I could get out. I didn't understand how I ended up in the forest, and why I didn't remember much of anything from my human existence.

As I walked among the autumn trees, I heard nothing but the rustling of the leaves. The sun was already well into the evening. I had to decide whether to keep going or find a place where I could hide and sleep. I thought, what should I be afraid of since the inhabitants of the forest are more afraid of humans than I am of them. Of course, there are animals that are dangerous at this time, and it's better to avoid them than to get in their way. My thirst grew stronger.

I decided to keep going until I reach a stream. If I find one, I'll camp there for the night. So I continued on. I stumbled through the darkness. Having stumbled over a few sticks and branches, I still made progress. I don't know how far, but I was probably about an hour's walk from my starting point. As it got darker, I stumbled more and more on the stones and branches.

Fear took hold of me, if I don't reach my goal, if I don't find anything. As I stumbled, searched, and listened, hoping to hear the trickle of a nearby stream. Nothing. The dense night came so quickly that my fear remained at a constant level. Sometimes I heard one or two human voices among the trees, but I thought it was just my fear manifesting.

I reached a big mountain, and at that moment, an inner voice whispered to me. Run! I was slowly climbing the mountain when I heard a deafeningly loud scream in a thin voice. It wasn't really a scream, it was more like a woman's shriek, but at a higher pitch. My blood ran cold. My heart seemed to stop beating, and the voice in my head grew stronger. Run! I started running.

I didn't pay attention to the branches, stones, or bushes, I trampled over them. The stones rolled aside, the branches broke, and the bushes cracked. I just ran as fast as my legs could carry me. And by grabbing onto smaller trees, I pulled myself up higher. Just as I was almost at the top of the mountain, I stumbled. At that moment, I fell forward and hit my left knee hard. I sat up and looked around as quickly as I could. I didn't see anything.

I started listening for the sound, but I didn't hear any movement either. I calmed down, as much as I could for today. While I was sitting there and calming myself, a dry tree about ten meters away from me gave in and fell. Making such a loud noise that its echo passed through the entire forest. I stood up and, fearing my pursuer, headed towards the top of the mountain.

There wasn't much left, maybe a few steps separated me from it. I made it to the top. The sight that greeted me was a bit frightening. I didn't see the lights of a village or a city, maybe just a clearing. I squatted by the base of a tree, pondering whether there might be a stream at the foot of the mountain. It didn't take long, and the full moon rose above the treetops.

Now the light, if not very much, illuminated almost everything. I could see now, not perfectly, but as much as I needed, it was perfect for that. I started down the mountain, it was steep and dangerous. I had to take every step slowly and deliberately. If I misstep, I roll down, and that wouldn't end well. Just below my left shoulder, where I hit it, it hurt terribly.

But I had to endure the pain. I didn't pay full attention to it, as I was going down dangerous paths. I got tired and, leaning against a tree, looked around. I caught my breath. From the corner of my eye, it looked like a girl had walked by. I lost my sense of balance. I lost my balance and started sliding down the slope. Halfway down, I crashed into another tree, which actually held me up. I was in excruciating pain.

I was covered in bruises and felt dizzy. I felt nauseous. After this feeling subsided, I looked up, and to my left, a spring was trickling. With great difficulty, clinging to the trunk of the tree, I stood up and headed towards the spring. The spring emerged from a crack in the rock, and as the moonlight shimmered on the surface of the stream, it looked as if thousands of small and large silver beads were flowing from the crevice.

I took a sip, the water was refreshing, and it felt wonderfully good to my dry throat. After quenching my thirst and starting to wash myself, my wounds and bruises, something interesting happened. The water on my wounds started to glow, brighter than the moonlight. In a few seconds, my wounds and bruises disappeared. I liked the sight, and after its effect, my soul was at peace.

I felt complete harmony around me. Maybe. Does this little stream represent the strength of the forest? But then what could be destroying it? A voice not far from me spoke up.  
*"You! You are those Human!"* \- I looked in the direction of the voice, but I saw nothing. Only the trees moving in the gentle breeze.

I continued walking, and after two or three steps, a blow struck the back of my head. I fell over, and darkness surrounded me. My senses dulled. I lost consciousness. I was lying on my back on the ground. I opened my eyes. I found myself in a cave. I couldn't call it a bear cave. I sat up and looked around.

It was a spacious cave with one entrance, and behind me were three smaller passages. Around me on the ground, bones, skulls, arrowheads, and complete arrows were mixed in with the earth. Among the many animal carcasses and bones, I noticed human skulls. I ran out of the cave. I saw that if these are the dead and the remains of the dead, I could be the next one, becoming such morbid decorations of the cave.

It was terrible and frightening. I ran as fast as I could, and in the distance, I saw a light. *"People!"* I shouted, and at that moment the light went out. I stopped in my tracks, taking a step back. I heard something approaching me. It had a panting sound and approached me with strong, deep thudding steps.

Suddenly, I heard that scream that drove me up to the mountaintop. I was breathless. In my fear, I relieved myself and ran, but avoided the cave. I ran. I could still hear the panting behind me, but from a distance. I fell into something that was two meters deep and fifty to sixty centimeters wide. I tried to climb out.

And while I was getting up, a clawed hand grabbed my shoulder and threw me. Straight into a tree. Three of my ribs broke immediately. Blood splatters out from between my clenched teeth. I didn't hear the panting anymore. My pains were unbearable. It occurred to me that the spring I found has healing powers. My orientation was simple because I wasn't far from the place where the spring is located.

At the spring, I took big gulps of water and spat it out to rinse my mouth. When I had already achieved the effect that my pain had eased. But the spit blood-colored water stained the beautiful color of the little vein. Its color completely changed, and a liquid resembling blood was already oozing from the crack. Soon, its color transformed again into some kind of gooey-like black liquid. At that moment, I started to smell a nauseating stench coming from it, which resembled sulfur the most.

The voice that spoke to me spoke again: *"See, this is how you ruin the forest." Human!"*  
I decided not to go any further. I'll stay here, whatever happens. I'm the killer of the forest. Fear me, let me not be the one who is hunted. I opened my eyes and saw a faint mist. A figure emerged from the thicket of trees. It wasn't a human. He was sickly thin.

His parched skin clung tightly to his bones. His complexion was the ash-gray of death, and his eyes were lifeless black, deeply sunken in their sockets. He leaned closer to me and said, *"Get up, Human!"*  
I tried to maintain my confidence, but my fear lingered deep inside somewhere. His voice matched the one who spoke to me the previous evening.

He continued with his speech, but I found it strange that he called me a person. In his voice, one could sense mockery and disdain. I didn't dare to look into his eyes, only for moments. I stared at his body and his large hand, I didn't dare to speak to him. He said, *"Hey Human, listen carefully to what I'm about to say.* *Because of your destructive mentality, you ruined my source. I've been following you since yesterday."*

*"I've been watching you since you got here, but wherever you went, you destroyed everything."*  
I looked at him in astonishment and said, *"What?* *I acknowledge your source, but I didn't destroy or devastate anything further. My intentions were pure, and I will compensate for your loss."*  
He replied: *"I recommend it too, but I'll show you what your kind does and what it disrupts."*

He lifted me up and showed me the way to go and what to pay attention to. He didn't speak. From then on, he just pointed at things. It became clear to me. He pointed to a nest, looked at it, and I knew what he wanted to say. If the bird hatches from the egg and its parents feed it, but if its parents are shot by humans, then the chicks cannot sustain themselves. But there is another approach. If there's also a nest in the tree and the person cuts it down, then we're in the same situation.

But in the meantime, a few memories came to mind. One evening, for example, a conversation. I saw a human face vaguely. But... but it was human. He said a few words. *"Beware! Lure you into a trap! You'll die!"* \- One evening, when I camped in front of the creature's cave, an old story came to my mind about a being that protects the forest, not out of interest, but to catch and devour the people who come there using various tricks. He eats until he is full, but he is never full. That's why he eats more and more. I noticed a parallel.

And I waited until it became quiet. And I ran away. I couldn't stay any longer. I was afraid that the creature just wanted to kill me. I reached a clearing. I noticed a narrow little path. I started walking on it, and familiar images came to mind. The path led to a small hill. Reaching the top, I saw a tower. As I got closer, a small village came into view, a tiny village of barely 300 brave souls.

I entered the village, and in the square stood a huge bonfire. As I examined it closely, a memory flashed in my mind that not long ago a woman was burned on charges of witchcraft. It was a terrible sight. Her scream immediately came to mind. People stared at me from their windows, and where children were watching, their parents were already closing the windows. I went into an inn.

The racket and noise immediately stopped. The people just looked at me, but none of them dared to speak. The bartender asked what I was doing there. I said I would like to drink something because I was tired from my long journey. The gentleman poured me a small glass. The moment I raised the glass to my lips, someone behind me bumped into me. The glass spilled, and before I could respond, I got a right hook.

I got dizzy and fell onto the counter. Another person standing next to me kicked me in the side. I fell to the ground, and blood splattered from my teeth. I stood up. But by the time I came to my senses, they had caught me. They dragged me out in front of the inn and threw me to the ground. They asked me what I was doing there. I didn't know what to answer. The man continued: *"What you did, you thought we would forgive you, you despicable scum!*  *You run away from us and then come back three days later? You won't get away with this!"*  
I didn't understand what he meant. But while he was saying this, they started dragging him towards the mage. I noticed a shadow on one of the rooftops. It was the creature. It was lurking there and staring at us. I was tied to the wooden post that was in the middle of the pyre. I noticed that a few meters away from me, on both sides, there were two other huge pyres, on which burned, mummified, and deformed corpses were tied.

   
They set the kindling on fire beneath me. People gathered around us as if they were watching a show by street acrobats. The priest also arrived, wearing a black cassock. His eyes were just as black and lifeless, from which some black, gooey liquid was oozing. He had the same grotesque eyes as the creature. He started praying for my soul, and as he continued to murmur the prayer, a smile appeared on the creature's face. The fire reached me, and the pain bit into me so fiercely that I started screaming. I looked ahead, and he was just standing there smiling, but when the flames started to burn my thigh, he stood up and left. My ashes were not buried, but scattered at the edge of the village, and when evening fell, my ashes turned to bone, and skin grew back over my bones, but not human skin, rather grayish and thin. I had no flesh, only tendons and skin, by the time the process was complete.

The creature stood before me. The being was as big as I am now, not taller.  
He said: *"See, Human? Now you belong with us."*  
From behind the trees, about four similar creatures emerged besides us. Soon, an even larger grotesque-looking creature began to emerge, walking on four legs and with antlers on its head. It seemed he might be the leader of the creatures. Maybe this is the creature that the mysterious figure told me about, the one that devours anyone who dares to venture into the forest. The creature suddenly placed its hand on me, and I lost all human thought. Instead, only one goal mattered to me:

To eat humans, serve the **Forest God**, and protect my territory.

**The forest.**
