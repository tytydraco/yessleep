It was late at night, around 10pm. I was making a long trip back to my family home, it was about a four hour drive from my flat in the city. I hadn’t indented traveling this late in the evening, but I had been held up at work, it was understandable as it was the last day before we left for the holidays but I was still annoyed that I was the only one who had been asked as my evening plans were “just driving” as my manager had put it. I had called my brother to let him know I would be late as he was the most reliable to get in contact with, I knew the area I was going to be driving in had little to no coverage as this wasn’t my first time taking this route.

The drive had been going fine, and I was making good time as there was no ice on the roads and most people had already settled into their houses for the foreseeable future to open presents and get uncomfortably drunk around extended family. To help with the monotony of the drive I had been switching back and forth between podcasts and music for the last two hours, it was around this time this I went back to music as the podcast had started to lose me. I guess with it just being flat country and so dark I didn’t notice at first.

It wasn’t until halfway through the song that I had a thought,

“didn’t I just hear this” I mumbled to myself, I tapped the next song button on my phone that was attached to the dashboard. However the same song just began playing again, I sighed in frustration and pulled over, I still had quite a while in the trip, and I needed something to keep alert. While I was trying to get my phone to give me anything other than the same song, I had a glance around me. There wasn’t much out there, I mostly drove by small towns and farmland on this route and this wasn’t much different, from what I could see in the dark there was a big field on my left with nothing in it, just a road ahead and behind me. The only thing that stood out was an old-looking farmhouse across the road from where I was parked that was slightly obscured by trees, the only reason I knew it was there was because it had its porch light on.

After fiddling with my phone for maybe seven minutes I finally gave up and just paused the song, thankfully I wasn’t so tired that driving would have been dangerous and reckless. I took off again and started down the road, much of the same with fields and trees, I spotted a small light starting to come into view on the right of the road, as I got closer, I could see it was slightly obscured by trees. There was another old-looking farmhouse with its porch light on, I didn’t really think about this much, not until the third time. This is when it started to confuse me, the houses were spaced out enough that they were on different land but from what I could see they were all very similar. Maybe somebody just owned many properties and liked the look of these houses. I shook off my strange feelings and continued down the road.

By my eight-time seeing a porch light approaching in the distance the uneasy feeling in my stomach was starting to grow, as I kept passing the “houses” I recognized more and more similarities, from the same wattage bulb on each porch light to the same dirt path leading up to the house. Last time I passed I took special care to remember something specific as sort of a test I guess, a test of what I don’t know. My mouth was dry as I slowly passed the front of that house and saw the exact same half broken branch that was illuminated by the light, this is when I sped up.

By time number twenty of seeing the porch light approaching in the distance I had also noticed that the surrounding area was the same every time too. The same field, the same trees, the same damn leaves blew across the road every time I got near the house. Whenever I looked at the house, I expected to see somebody standing in a window or at the door, I kept bracing myself for something to jump out in the road, but no. It was the same every time, the exact same.

I had stopped counting by the time my car died, it didn’t run out of petrol or hit something in the road. It just stopped working, as I approached those porch lights again, my car just turned off and I rolled to a dead stop. Nothing I did to try and turn the car back on again worked, I took my phone off the dashboard and, as I already knew, I had no service, but I still tried to call my brother, but it didn’t even ring. The same thing happened when I tried the emergency numbers, while I was desperately trying to contact someone on my phone, I noticed two things, first the time on the phone read ten past ten at night. I knew this was wrong, I had been driving desperately for maybe another hour since I first saw those porch lights. The second was that it was getting colder.

I sat in the car for maybe 45 minutes just waiting, waiting for anything to happen but it was just the same. The temperature had been dropping steadily during this time; I had put my jacket on at this point but was starting to shiver again. I had clothes in my bag in the boot, but I didn’t dare step one foot outside of the car. I had tucked my hands under my arms to get warmer but at this stage I could see my breath every time I exhaled. I had no way of measuring the temperature, but I knew this was far lower than it was forecasted to be, still I just stayed in the car shivering away and watching the door under the porch light.

A further 30 minutes passed until it became unbearably cold, my fingers had lost all their color and were starting to throb. At this point I really didn’t have any option, I readied myself for anything and slowly climbed out of my car and hastily walked to the back of my car, I would have run but all my joints felt so stiff from the cold. I grabbed the handle of the boot and went to yank it open, but it didn’t. I tried again with both hands, but it was like it was locked. A slam made me jump and tears well up in my eyes, I expected someone to grab me and drag me away like in a horror film but there was still that same silence.

It was the door to my car that had slammed, I desperately pulled at the handle until my shoulders hurt praying to God it would open but it was firmly shut. I kept wildly glancing around me preparing to see some creature or being approaching in the darkness but the was nothing besides the porch light, I waited for maybe 30 more minutes until the air was stinging but mouth and lungs when I inhaled and it felt like I have ice forming in my nose. I had been crying for a while, sure that I had died in some wreck on the road and this was the afterlife or hell. I finally decided I had only one choice.

I approached the front of the house with a feeling of familiarity; I had been looking at it for nearly 4 hours at this point now. I slowly made my way up the dirt track that turned left passed the trees to that front porch, I was cautious when finally stepping onto it, I had my heels turned so I was prepared to run if anything came running out of the door. Still nothing though, just a stillness in the air as I placed my hand on the doorknob and turned it.

The door opened easily, it swung open with no prompting from myself and the light from the porch flooded the hall. I could see the opening of two rooms on either side of the hall and a double staircase leading up. Everything about this screamed so wrong to me so I quickly turned around to head back to my car, my blood then turned cold. My car was gone, it hadn’t been driven away or pushed or anything it was just gone, the shape I could make in the dark and moonlight was no longer there. Now the outside gave me more of an uneasy feeling than the house, so I backed in slowly watching the tree line.

I looked around the inside of the house making out what I could in the dark and with help from the porch light. On the right there was an opening to a dining room, it was small with a table with and old ragged tablecloth that had 4 seats and two windows facing towards the front of the house. There was a haze of dust and a smell I couldn’t place that clung to the back for my throat. The left side of the hall had a living room, with only a single couch that was covered with a sheet and a fireplace that had a few items next to it that I could make out from the doorway. While surveying there was a massive bang behind me that shook the entire house, and I was left in complete darkness.

I spun around and saw that the front door and been slammed shut behind me, I quickly moved to open it again, but I couldn’t, it didn’t even seem like the door was locked. It was like there was no door at all and I was just pulling on a wall. After a few minutes of trying to open the wall, I realized how futile it was, I went into the dining room to try and look out at the front of the house or use one of the windows to escape. I stopped dead in my tracks as I realized the windows were gone. The glass and the surrounding were all there but now there was a wall in place of the outside, I opened one of the windows and tried pushing against the wall, but it was firmly in place. Out of desperation I started bashing my hands against the wall, screaming out all my frustrations as tears flowed down my cheeks. My hands were getting bloody, and I don’t know how much longer I would have kept going but I stopped when something hit back.

I had been inside the house for a few hours now, I had settled into the living room as the couch was comfy and there was barley enough supplies to light a small fire. The warmth was welcoming, and I pulled the couch closer and sat in front of it. The outside of the house had been silent the whole time and I was even beginning to relax a small bit. Even though my phone said ten past ten still it was closer to about four am from my best guess, I was exhausted but in no way tired. While I was sitting there, I noticed a glint coming from the side of the fireplace, I reached up and unhooked a small but heavy brass key that had the number two engraved in it in red. It was the only thing besides the fire supplies I had found so I placed it in my pocket and lay down on the couch.

I couldn’t sleep, as tired as I felt I could not sleep with the noises. I had just been drifting off when I heard it for the first time, it sounded like someone was sprinting and full speed around the house. Not just doing laps but like they were desperately searching for a way in, I could hear them run to the far side of the house near the dining room before coming steaming back to my side of the house, I had checked to make sure the door and the windows were still gone, now thankful that they were. I still just lay on the couch hoping the sound would go away which thankfully it did. The last time I heard the sprinting it ended with the dull thud of heavy footsteps on the porch, then I heard the door creak open.

I flew off the couch and stared and the door, now appeared, as it slowly opened, through the crack in the door I saw a little cloud of air from someone or something breathing on the other side. I jumped forward and slammed my body into the door, I braced myself for the onslaught I was sure was about to come but there was nothing. I stayed there holding the door for a while, expecting something to try and open again but they didn’t. After a few minutes I realized how cold I was getting, I was trying to form a plan of blocking the door and returning to the fire when I had a horrifying discovery. The dining room and living room were now gone, replaced with just walls so the only thing I could see was the double staircase.

I sunk down on the ground and put my head in my hands and felt so defeated, the cold was beginning to sting my lungs and the cuts on my hands. I felt the door begin to open again behind me and I shot back, placing my weight against it again, this time I did feel resistance for a while not enough for me to exert myself but enough to know there was something on the other side. I sat there for a while, forgetting about the cold and just focusing on not letting whatever it was in. Finally, I felt the pressure ease off so I was able to relax for maybe 20 minutes before the door began to open again.

This routine continued for over three hours, very rigidly. Twenty minutes of it trying to get in then twenty minutes of it backing off, however every time it was attempting to get into the house the force would be stronger. I was fast approaching when I would not be able to hold back whatever was on the other side of the door. I had realized that my only option was to go upstairs, at the time my heels were dug into the floor, and I was pushing back with all the strength I had left. I could see rapid puffs of air coming through the crack in the doors and feel warm, rancid breath of whatever was outside, I knew I could only last maybe a few more seconds when it finally stopped. I collapsed to the ground and let out a feeble cry, my hands were bleeding again, and I just stared at them while lying on the floor. I knew there was only one option, and I didn’t have a lot of time so I collected myself and rose to my feet.

I made my way up the stairs warily but speedily enough; my eyes had adjusted to the darkness that I could see quite clearly but I still took my phone out to use the torch as I approached the top of the landing. All there was on this floor was a single door, I approached it slowly as I was waiting for this door to start to open like its brother downstairs, but it stayed closed, when I was finally close enough, I could see that below the handle there was a keyhole that sported a red number two above it. I slowly took the key out of my pocket with my stiff and freezing fingers and opened the door.

When the door opened, my eyes were immediately pulled to the lone ornate chair in the middle of the room that seemed to be brighter than its surrounds. I hesitated stepping into the room, every time I had moved forward everything seemed to have become worse. Almost like it was in answer to my reasoning I heard the familiar creak of the door downstairs opening and footsteps below me. I heard them stop at the foot of the stairs and I slowly leaned over the side of the banister to see the same puffs of air of something breathing in the cold. I swallowed quietly and turned back towards the open door before me.

This is when there were thundering footsteps barging up the stairs and a roar that seemed to be within my own eardrums rather than the house itself. I scrambled forward into the room while screaming and threw the door closed behind me and placed my weight against it readying myself for another twenty-minute battle but after a while of standing there I heard nothing on the other side. I turned back towards to chair and shone my torch around the room, I could now make out more details such as the large vases in each corner and the moonlight that seemed too bright pouring in the windows and towards the chair. I then noticed that the chair was surrounded by hundreds or thousands of the same key I was still gripping tightly in my frozen fingers. I knelt and picked one of them up and saw the number 746 etched in red, I considered placing my own key down but that seemed almost ritualistic to me, so I put it back in my pocket.

I walked around to the front of the chair and stared at it hard, it seemed so perfectly placed that I knew exactly what I was supposed to do. I was supposed to sit in this chair, I glanced at the door and half expected it to be gone but it was still there, but I knew that there was nothing out there I wanted to be a part of. I was just so tired, too tired I had been awake for nearly twenty-eight hours at this point if I was guessing correctly. I didn’t care what happened anymore, I was so cold, tired and scared I couldn’t cry or scream anymore. So, I chose to sit in that chair.

As I sank into it, I felt relief wash over me, my hands no longer hurt, and the room seemed to grow warmer. I sat there for a while staring ahead at the blank wall, the warmth continued to envelop me almost like I was being wrapped in a heavy duvet, only one thing really made sense to do at this point. I slowly closed my eyes and felt almost happy, I felt warm and pain free and whatever this was it finally felt like it was coming to an end. I didn’t even move when the door opened behind me, or when the footsteps approached to the back of my chair and felt that warm rancid breath on the nape of my neck. Even when I felt the heavy hands rest on my shoulders and the long slender fingers dug into my arms, I was happy, I just needed to sleep.

I awoke screaming and flailing around my car, my eyes darted back and forth as I tried to make sense of where I was. The car was parked on the side of the road, the sun was pouring in the windows as cars were passing by me, I glanced to my right expecting to see the porch of the farmhouse through the trees but there was nothing. I quickly took my phone out and looked at the time, it was half nine in the morning. I had numerous calls and texts from my concerned family asking if I was ok, none of this felt real but with the sense of relief I felt all I could do was laugh, a hard and proper belly laugh. I sat back in my seat, took a deep breath and shot my brother a message and apologized saying I had just fallen asleep at the side of the road. I shook my head in disbelief; I honestly never had a nightmare that felt so real I could remember so many details clearly. I reached my hands into my jacket pocket to get my car keys, what my fingers touched made me go cold and I could feel sick rising up my throat as I pulled out a small heavy brass key with a red number that now said one.
