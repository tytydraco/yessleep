Last year I left my job as a correctional officer in a federal death row facility after working there for over twenty years. I’ve seen horrible, horrible things during my time, but nothing came close to what happened last year on that cold night in November.

When I entered the warden’s room, I immediately noticed that smile on his face. I knew it all too well.

“Ah, Cal,” he said. “Another PET has returned. Go fetch it with Jeremy, will you? They’ll arrive in twenty minutes.”

PETS was an acronym for a certain group of inmates, meaning *Potentially Extraditable Test Subjects*. In singular form, the “test” becomes “testee”. A few of us liked to call them PESTS – the first “S” standing for “Shitheads”. But most of us preferred to keep it to PETS due to its connotation. It made us feel superior, as if we had the power to do whatever we wanted with them.

“I’ll get him,” I said and turned around to leave the room.

“Oh, and one more thing. It’s one of those sensitive ones, so it’s best if you question him while Jeremy handles the paperwork outside of the room.”

I nodded and went to look for Jeremy. As expected, he was outside, taking a smoke break.

“Hi Cal,” he said as I approached, blowing smoke from the side of his mouth. “Another PET?”

“Yeah. About fifteen minutes from now.”

He casually put his cigarette back in his mouth and smoked it down to the filter.

“Let’s go then,” he coughed, throwing the butt on the ground, grinding it with the tip of his shoe.

We walked down the corridor to the sallyport and waited for the van to arrive. We’d usually wait in silence, but since it was cold, Jeremy began to talk, likely to make time pass quicker.

“Ah, if only more women would be on the death row,” he shivered.

“Why’d you wish that?”

“It’d even things out, you know? Like that, not all female inmates would be SLUTS.”

*Sojourning and Lawfully Untouchable Trash Subjects* were frequently visited inmates or prolific cases, basically off limits for the lab personnel. We had to treat them normally because they’d always be lawfully executed. Some of us replaced the last “S” by “Sonsabitches”. Women were SLUTS by default, since there were too few of them compared to males, so they’d stand out if sent to the lab.

“Ah, they’ve finally arrived,” I said as two headlights were closing in.

The van reversed and, when it came to a stop, the back doors opened from the inside where two masked men handed us a zipped-up body bag. I grabbed one end, Jeremy the other. When we held the bag comfortably, I asked one of the men, “PET or proxy?”

“PET. Proxy incoming next week. One of the subjects didn’t make it.”

I heard Jeremy whisper “Shit”.

“It’s the second one this year...” I sighed.

“A body’s a body,” said the man and he closed the door. The van rode off soon after.

“Pieces of shit,” Jeremy cursed. “I hate doing more paperwork.”

We carefully dragged the bag through the hall towards the Refurb Room.

“But the pay is good,” I shrugged. “How much do they give you per forged certificate?”

“Can’t say,” he grinned. He looked around as if we were being watched and lowered his voice to a whisper. “Three grand. But it’s a real pain in the ass.”

Nobody knew the exact criteria for selecting PETS. A lab official would check every file, ask questions about their behavior and habits, after which they’d designate which PET they’d pick up a week later. Subjects could be either “Fit” or “Unfit”. “Fit” subjects needed falsified documents stating they’d been executed, and “Unfit” subject needed forged health certificates stating they’d been transferred to a hospital for health concerns. The latter was easier to perform when we dealt with older inmates, but requests for “Unfit” younger inmate weren’t rare.

The paperwork was Jeremy’s job, checking whether everything was in order. For example, about a quarter of death row inmates died from natural causes, so we’d couldn’t cross that threshold. Given their scarcity, female inmates were always SLUTS. Utilizing them as PETS would stand out as much as a serial killer licking a bloody knife in a room packed with corpses.

At the given date we’d drug the inmates’ food, drag them to the back of a van, and they’d be delivered back anywhere between weeks and months later. “Unfit” PETS would sometimes die in the process, so we had to forge another death certificate for the hospital or pedal back on our original forgeries if it was possible. It was a tedious process, but if we had any trouble, the lab officials would lend us a hand – after all, it was their experiments that had failed, not our due diligence.

Nobody knew exactly what type of experiment they performed. We theorized it was something to do with biochemical weapons because most returnees were debilitated and died soon after.

Since it’d be pretty obvious if all the ‘hospitalized’ PETS would die, they replaced them with a proxy. Lobotomized, of course. It’s almost funny how they didn’t care if the substitutes bore no resemblance to the PETS, going as far as handing us people of different races and body types. Where they got those proxy from, I never knew. I was too afraid to ask because we’d have to get rid of them at their stated date of death. Those types of executions were kept secret and performed behind closed doors.

Only once did a correctional officer try to leak information to the public. Obviously, he was caught in time. We were told that “They’ve moved overseas with their family”. Everyone knew very well what that meant.

“Why’re you complaining if you get extra cash?” I asked while opening the Refurb Room’s door.

“Because,” Jeremy huffed as we laid the bag on the ground and unzipped it, “I’m always afraid that I’ll make a mistake and get caught. Or rather, sent overseas with my family, if you know what I mean.”

We dragged the inmate’s body on the sole chair inside the small, concrete, windowless room, and attached his arms, legs, and chest with full restraints. I used a small flashlight to see what we were doing as the room was completely dark.

Jeremy opened a box and grabbed the syringe filled with unknown green liquid. He tapped it a few times and inserted it in the man’s arm, slowly pressing it in. We were told the room must stay in penumbra until the injection has its effect, or else the inmates could turn aggressive.

“Wonder what this one looks like,” he snorted, about to take off the black cloth on the man’s head.

I immediately grabbed his arm. “Wait. You do the paperwork, I’ll question him.”

Jeremy raised a brow but agreed and left me alone with the inmate.

A few minutes later I noticed a movement.

“Finally,” I thought, writing it down. Taking notes was  required by the lab personnel. I had to write the time of injection, the time of first movement, and the time when they began to utter something, cue to press a button on the wall which would gradually light the room up.

The inmate began to mumble, which I wrote down, and proceeded to press the button. His head was lolling downwards, but little by little I was able to notice peculiar features I had never seen on any PET before.

He was completely hairless and full of scars on his head and neck. His ears were drooping, and his cheeks were so inflated it looked like there was a balloon inside his mouth. I had seen inmates that had been beaten to the brink of death, but this looked different.

Suddenly, the inmate’s head lolled back and I jumped. Instead of a nose there was a dark contraption, akin to a breather. No hair on his face either, not even his eyelashes. I could discern incision scars made around his eyes, mouth, and ears.

“D-do you know who you are? Can you tell me your name?” I asked.

He began to hum a low, constant drone.

“Are you unable to speak? Nod if you can hear me.”

His head lolled forward again, then failed to return. I scribbled that down.

“Can you bring your head back again – yes? – very good,” I said. The hum’s pitch grew into something more distressing. “It’s all right, you’re safe here. I’m just asking questions.”

It was in those moments that I wondered what actually happened to them. Of course, I’ve never asked. It was none of my business; I didn’t want to end up like the other guy and his family.

He began to make retching noises. I rapidly took a few steps back because I wanted to deal with none of that. Then his eyes squinted open.

“Ah, you can finally open your eyes, very good,” I said, scribbling down the time. “How do you –”

When I glanced from the form to the inmate, I froze. They’d carved out his eyes; all that remained were two black slits.

“The fuck have they done this time,” I uttered.

I didn’t want to continue the interview and simply leave the room, but I had a job to do. When I inched closer, he closed his eyes and started to growl. The light was bright enough, and I was near enough to see the glint of the pus leaking from the fresh scars around his eyes, nose, mouth, and even ears.

“C-can you hear me?” I asked again.

No response. He was just gargling.

“Arin?” I asked. “Ar–? Oh, fuck.” I cursed because I wasn’t supposed to call his name.

Instantly, his eyes sprung wide open and I screamed. Instead of eyeballs, I was greeted by two gaping holes curving down, as if they put dark tubes in there.

Something began to slither far inside them, followed by the most horrible of voices, sounding nothing like a human. The eyelids moved almost like lips.

“Whrme ugr?”

Some kind of secretion oozed from the holes. I felt sick, but I *had* to finish my task.

“W-what are y-you trying t-t-to say?”

“Whyyyy… whhhyyyyy…..” he wheezed.

I tried not to stare, but those holes compelled me to look. That’s when I understood what those slithering things were. They were elongated tongues…

“S-sorry, could you – could you repeat that p-please?”

A rhythmic wheeze, growl-like. At once his entire body exploded with energy, trying to writhe himself from the chair, twitching, screaming with the holes wide open. The tongues were vibrating like mad in the center of those dark ringed tubes.

“P-please stay c-calm,” I squeaked.

“WHY! ARE! MY! EYES! HUNGRY?!” he roared, spitting blood from the tubes.

“FEED! ME!! FEED! ME!! FEED! ME!! FEED! ME!!” his eyelids pulsed at the same rhythm as his yells.

“I – I – Y-you h-have to wait, c-calm down –”

“FEED! ME!! FEED! ME!!”

He kept repeating it, oozing more and more blood, spluttering all over the place.

I walked backwards. When my back touched the door, I turned and grabbed the handle.

“Don’t… LEAVE… **MEEEEE!**”

I glanced back and I screamed. His actual mouth was open and a bloodshot eye hanged from a thick tongue at least 15 inches in length. I froze, shuddering, staring at the horror. And the eye ogled at me with intent.

“FEED ME OR I WILL CONSUME YOUR FESTERING CORPSE.”

I left the room and locked the door.

My heart was pounding like never before. I could still hear his enraged screams seeping from the thick door.

“Hey,” said a voice and I let out a yelp.

“Hey, it’s me,” said Jeremy. He frowned as he saw my strange demeanor, clutching his stun gun. “What happened in there? Do we need to shoot him?”

“N-no. D-don’t look, J-Jeremy, he – it’s… what the fuck have they done to him?” I quaked.

 “Are you all right?” He sheathed the gun.

“No, I’m not. I’m fucking not. Fuck man, don’t look I tell you! It’s a fucking horror. I think I’m gonna throw up.”

Jeremy passed by me and slowly opened the door. Between the screams I heard an audible gasp. Or maybe he hiccoughed. He immediately shut the door and we stared at each other, thinking the same thing.

 “What are we supposed to do with that thing?” he asked.

“We must contact the lab people. Immediately. Y-you call them.”

“No, *you* call them,” he shuddered. “I don’t want to end up like Frank and his family.”

“Neither do I,” I said. “Do you think they’ll – ?”

“Dunno,” he shook his head. “Maybe it’ll be OK if *you* do it. You’ve always been their favorite guy, Mr. *I-don’t-give-a-shit-about-inmates*. Except when *this* happens.” He pointed behind him with his thumb.

“Because *you* care?” I scowled. Jeremy often vocalized his hatred of death row inmates and said things much more horrible than I’d ever imagine.

“I have a wife and kids, Cal,” he said. “*You* contact them. And don’t tell them I’ve seen… whatever that shit is.”

“Fine,” I sighed. It was my responsibility after all, since I had questioned the inmate.

A phone call and half an hour later, four men in lab coats followed by two armed men entered the prison. Three of the lab coaties went in with their guards, while the last one stopped me in the hallway, inquiring about the form. He perused it, occasionally humming and nodding.

“Yes, yes, I see. Yes, I thought so, yes,” he said, forcing a smile as he eyed me carefully. “Did he… say anything special after that?”

“Er –” I was contemplating whether to tell him the whole truth, but in the end, decided it was best to spill the beans. “He opened his eyes – or rather, his mouth, I don’t know – and yelled, ‘Why are my eyes hungry?’”

“That’s it?”

“N-no. After that kept shouting until he opened his actual mouth and stuck a cow tongue out. Except there was an eye hanging off it, just… staring…”

“Yes, yes, very interesting,” he smiled, looking pleased with himself. “Very well. Thank you very much, Cal.” He put a hand on my shoulder. “And, er, no one else has seen this, I may hope?”

There was a twinkle in his eyes, a subtle squint, that made me snitch; I felt like they were able to see right through me. I told him about Jeremy.

“Aha. And where is this Jeremy fellow now?”

I shrugged. “Working somewhere around the prison, I guess?”

“Working, huh? And – ah – is he the talkative type?”

“No,” I answered immediately. “He’ll never spill the beans, if that’s what you fear.”

“Yes, yes. I see.” He lay his other hand on my other shoulder and grinned. “I *love* people like you. Truthful. Honorable. No allegiance to anyone but yourself and your job. I think you deserve another promotion, Cal. I’ll talk to your boss, OK?”

“Er – th– thank you, sir,” I said. He bobbed his head a few times and let me go. The next moment, the door opened, and the armed men were carrying a bag.

“Everything’s sorted out?” one of the lab coaties asked.

The man I just spoke to made a circle with his index and thumb, beaming in excitement.

“Good, let’s go then.”

They drifted away down the corridor, when the coatie I spoke to ran back.

“I almost forgot,” he puffed. “Keep our – ah – conversation secret from Jeremy, will you? It’s better like that for… both of us.”

“S-sure.”

He grinned widely and disappeared down the hallway.

The following day, I got called into my boss’ office and got a promotion. But that wasn’t all. I was about to leave his office when he called me back.

“Oh, and, by the way, Jeremy gave me his resignation,” he said.

“What?” I spurted out. “Just like that? But why?”

My boss laughed wholeheartedly. “You know *very well* why.” He smirked, enjoying himself. “The weather’s been quite cold here lately. Jeremy thought it was the perfect time of the year to move somewhere warmer. He decided to take his wife and three kids with him. *Overseas*.” He winked. “Funny, isn’t it? Second time that happens here. What are the odds?” And he laughed again.

I forced a smile. But inside, I was mortified. Jeremy’d been terminated. And I was certain I’d be next in line. Except it didn’t happen. Days of fear became weeks of anxiety, and eventually, one month went by.

After my initial breakdown, I planned my departure. Not only from the prison, but also from the country. Due to my qualifications, I had become acquainted with a few people from the underground, who deftly crafted a fake passport. I currently reside in an undisclosed location, far from everything.
