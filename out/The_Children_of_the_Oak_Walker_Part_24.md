[\[Part 23\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1b5rmgl/the_children_of_the_oak_walker_part_23/)

With a wet *plop*, my foot sank into another soft clump of floating grass, and I groaned in annoyance.  
*My feet are going to rot off if this keeps up.*  
Both hips, knees, and feet throbbed, the backpack straps rubbing my shoulders raw under my light jacket. Every muscle strained sore and tight, energy-starved as my poor stomach growled on empty. My clothes were soaked through, and there were burs stuck into the sides of my trousers like dozens of spiky leeches. Around me, the water-logged swamp stretched out for miles, formerly productive farmland that had been overrun by neglect and heavy rains to turn it back into a muddy plain of underbrush, dead trees, and islands of floating grass. The mid-morning sky overhead bore a gray coating of clouds, the air chilly, the only blessing that the cold ensured we weren’t beset with swarms of bugs. The rain had only stopped fifteen minutes ago, and if it had been summertime, I had little doubt we would have been eaten alive by gnats, midges, and mosquitos by now.  
I shifted to pull the wrinkled plastic bottle from my backpack and eyed what little water remained in the bottom of it.  
*Water, water, everywhere, yet we can’t get a drop to drink.*  
The joints inside my legs clicked with each step, and I gulped the last of the clear liquid with an exhausted sigh. Behind me, the line of children sloshed along in similar levels of fatigue, heads down, arms hanging at their sides. We’d been walking southward for ten hours straight, after a harrowing half-hour run from the numerous patrols ELSAR sent out to find us. The night had been spent skulking through the forest, watching the skies for drones, and shivering after the cold rain doused us all in the early morning. We’d only lost our pursuers by breaking to the southwest into the swamps, the mud here too deep even for their tracked vehicles. Drinking water had run out fast, since we couldn’t stop to capture any of the rain, nor find a dry place to build a fire, which was vital to purify any of the algae-ridden current that swirled around our ankles. With rough estimations from my homemade map, I figured we’d covered almost twenty miles in the night, though we were a good ten miles off-course, and it showed in the haggard faces of my charges.  
One of the girls tripped and fell face-first into the muck with a loud *splash*.  
Changing direction made my already fuzzy brain spin, but I waded over to her, and dragged the girl to her feet. “We’re going to stop soon. Just stick with me, alright? I promise, you’ll be able to rest in a little while.”  
An older boy slowed and shifted his well-worn hunting rifle to the opposite shoulder. “She okay?”  
“Just lost her footing.” Leaning the bedraggled girl on his arm, I flexed my legs to keep the blood from rushing to my own head, on the verge of passing out from the compounded stress of our flight. “But if you could keep an eye on her for me, that’d help a lot. Come find me if anyone else falls out.”  
*Bwwwooonnnggg.*  
Birds erupted from the spindly trees in alarm, and the electro-synth foghorn ripped through the air from somewhere to the east. Everyone else looked around in confusion, but my blood cooled, the sound unmistakable to me.  
With a renewed burst of energy, I jogged back up the line, and scanned the trees for any sign of movement. “Into the trees! Move into the bushes, come on! Stay low!”  
Motivated by the alarm in my voice, the column filtered into the scrub brush on the edge of the submerged field, and no sooner had we done so, then the *screech-thud* of heavy steel feet wandered closer.  
From where I crouched under a tangle of thorny multiflora rose, water up to my thighs, I gaped in astonishment as the Echo Spider came into view.  
*They’re out in daylight now.*  
In a slow, jerky gait, the gargantuan steel anomaly lumbered through the trees of the old forest, its satellite dish head swinging back and forth. The eight I-beam legs beneath it stabbed into the mud, and the creature slogged on through the marsh at a leisurely pace, its braided-cable mandibles ripping up vegetation to consume like hungry metal worms. Seeing one in the daytime, even if the sun’s rays were still weak from the overcast sky made my head spin, and I spotted black flakes peeling from its central caterpillar-like body. The once greasy black tendons holding the beams together were now a burnt brown and covered in a thin coat of coarse fur like a tarantula. The flash rusted steel had been smeared with yellowish-brown grease, and I watched as the massive arachnid stopped to ‘lick’ at one of its legs with the oily cable mandibles that hung under its wide head.  
*Whoosh.*  
Air rushed over the treetops, and a massive shadow plummeted from the sky in a blur of speed.  
*Crash.*  
Thrown off balance, the Echo Spider slammed to the water, snapping off trees and sending a geyser of mud into the air for yards from the impact of its titanic body. It struggled on its back, kicking its I-beam legs in desperation, but the steel giant couldn’t overcome the weight of its attacker as a second swooped in from the south.   
Both ambushers settled down atop the pinned Techno and flapped their leathery wings in cruel celebration, as the thrashing battle tore the swamp to pieces.  
The breath caught in my throat, and I withdrew further under the thorns, terrified and yet strangely fascinated, like a mouse with a snake.  
*So, that’s a Wyvern.*  
In all my life, I had never thought I would see something like it, a huge, four-legged serpentine creature with muscles shoulders, hooked bat-like wings, and clawed feet that could have sliced a tank in half. They both had greenish-brown scales, patterned like the flaky bark from a tree that Jamie called ‘shagbark’, and these also bore the ebony marks of their contact with sunlight. Black flaps of skin peeled off them from various places, the old bark burned away to reveal the hardened scales underneath. Long tails ended in club-like bony knobs the size of wrecking balls, and the creatures’ heads were similar to the Birch Crawlers in shape, but with more of a crown at the back, and bulging chameleon-like eyes that could spin independently in their sockets. One of the Organics stood slightly smaller than the other, and my intuition figured it to be a pair, the female thinner around her jaw and tail, the male sporting a small horn from his snout that looked reminiscent of the rotted oak log he’d been shaped after. Sharp spines ran down their backs, and the female hissed with a lizard-like chitter, while the male called in a deep bellow that reminded me of alligators from the zoo. If the fur-covered elephants and rhinos from New Wilderness had been a bizarre step back in time, these things were a tumultic leap, a hurtling jolt in reverse to an era when man didn’t dare show his face outside the safety of his caves or trees.  
Yellowed teeth dripping with spattered orange blood, the Wyverns tore into the crippled Echo Spider without hesitation, churning up the water with dark sediment and chunks of rubbery brown flesh. The Echo Spider tried to wrap its cables around the female’s jaws to defend itself, but the carnivorous flying nightmare swung her clubbed tail around to smash the spider’s satellite-dish head in a single blow.  
Mortally wounded, the Echo Spider let out one last, long, pained blare of its horn, and the steel legs went limp.  
*Better move, before they decide they want desert.*  
I inched deeper into the flooded wood line, and nodded for the others to follow, each passing a wave down the column, so the rest knew to slink forward. Every *slosh-slosh* of our steps made my heart throw itself against my ribcage in terror, but I purposefully took it slow. A small part of my brain told me that sudden bursts of movement would be the end for us, that these colossal beings wouldn’t care to give chase if we didn’t make ourselves into targets. No, they had their catch, and were happily gorging themselves, so there was little point in chomping down a few scrawny humans as long as we kept to the shadows.   
The huddle of teenagers behind me were white as fresh paint, many visibly shaking, this likely the first mega-mutant contact they’d ever had. In the course of a night, they’d been thrust back into a lower rung of the food chain once more, and no one dared try anything heroic or stupid, fighting against such monstrosities blatant suicide to even the greenest of recruits.  
At last, I crawled on all fours up a slight incline, and out onto a weed-infested roadbed that sat high enough to avoid the water. Many of the trees here still clung to life, leafy and thick, enough that we could stop to catch our breaths, and count heads.  
Relieved, and charged with the excitement that came from any near-death rush, the children bunched around me as we waited for the rest of our companions, trading excited, nervous whispers back and forth.  
“Did you see their teeth?”  
“I literally almost peed myself.”  
“They could lift a whole house!”  
As if to answer the hushed speculations, a bone-chilling roar echoed through the air again, the Wyverns enjoying their meal with no fear of anything else. There was a reason ELSAR helicopters never came this far south anymore. In an odd twist of fate, we were safest the further from our own kind we got.  
*Twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one . . . thirty-two. Thank God. That was close.*  
I rubbed at my eyes and tried to blink away the sleep deprivation. We had everyone. So far, so good.  
Another two miles down the road, and the land began to dry out. Tall grasses coated the empty fields, a few destroyed houses dotted the roadside in places, though some of the marsh had crept into the lower-lying areas. Most of the farmsteads we passed were either fallen-in or burned to the ground, the ruins speckled with curious eyes that watched us as we plodded on. Not content to leave us to drip-dry, the rain started once again, and poured down in force. After so long without ample rest, I was near collapse, my feet numb, legs on fire, back aching in protest. Half the children in the column were relying on each other to stay upright, taking turns supporting the weight of their companion.  
*There.*  
My eyes caught the outline of sharp right angles and straight lines to the right side of the road, and I gasped in breathless joy.  
It appeared to have been some sort of factory at one point, a flat-topped two-story red-brick building surrounded by chain link fence and cracked asphalt. The compound was small, likely a brick kiln from the many stacks of the reddish blocks on pallets in the yard, and judging by the thorn bushes grown up along the walls, it hadn’t been in use for a while. A few dilapidated vehicles sat rusting away in the parking lot, the doors were streaked with dark mold, and some of the windows lay shattered in their frames. Still, it was quiet, and I couldn’t sense anything nearby, which meant finders keepers.  
“Whoa.” A boy whispered as I pulled up a loose corner of the fence so my group could wriggle through. “Creepy.”  
His friend, a boy who couldn’t have been much older than eleven, pointed to the back fence, where a few low silhouettes scuttled back and forth on the opposite side. “Look! Those boxes are moving.”  
I heard the static-laden patches of music before I even had to look up, and my skin prickled in caution. There were four of them, square critters shaped like old-timey radios, with the metal legs bent like crabs, wires extended like hands to grasp at their prey. They were busy with a decayed whitetail carcass, and outside of the fence, but I knew better than to tempt even simple entities like these.  
“Those are Speaker Crabs.” I tugged the fence shut behind us and twisted the wires together to keep any intruders out. “Stay away from them. They eat anything they can get their wires into, including your brains.”  
That seemed to scare some sense into my curious companions, who sidled closer to me as we approached the massive factory building.  
The lower level had been boarded up, and some of the windows even had bricks and mortar barring them shut, as if someone tried to fortify it once before. The double sheet-steel doors refused to budge, and we had to wander around the outside until one of the smaller girls found a back door that hadn’t been locked.  
Inky shadows cloaked the first floor, stuffed with iron catwalks, old machinery, and more pallets of unused bricks. From the dust on everything, I figured no one had been here since the beginning of the Breach-born attacks. Two stairwells on either side of the massive ground floor led up to the second, where large metal vats and empty water tanks sat astride big sections of pipe. As expected, none of the lights worked, but the roof cut out the wind and rain, enough that the gritty industrial husk almost felt cozy. On the second floor, near the eastern corner, we found the remains of a little hideout someone had built, with a primitive wood stove, some cots made from pallet wood, and a few tarps stretched over a wooden box. The stove pipe went out the nearby window, a large bay-styled pane that had been smashed ages ago, only to be boarded back up by our unknown benefactor. Much of the factory had been similarly fortified, as it turned out, though whoever came before hadn’t returned.  
“Alright!” An older boy pried open the wooden crate with a flat piece of angle-iron to expose dusty cans, folded army-surplus blankets, plastic sheeting, and an old topographical map. “Who’s hungry?”  
*Never eat where you plan to sleep.*  
Chris’s words cut through my head, and I walked over to push the lid shut. “We’ll eat after everyone’s slept, and not inside.”  
A skinny girl folded her arms with a pouting lower lip. “But I’m hungry now. Whoever made this lit fires in here, so obviously we can. What’s a little smoke going to hurt?”  
*‘Call my baby lollipop, tell you why . . . her kiss is sweeter than a cherry pie . . .’*  
From outside, the eerie, warbling chorus of an old 1940’s song rose to our ears, and I pointed at the window to accentuate my point. “They’re not stupid. Smoke could mean a grassfire, which they avoid, but you light up a can of beans and sausage, and you might as well put out a sign for them. You can light the stove, but no cooking unless I say so.”  
Hungry grumbles slithered through the crowd, but the boys set about dragging in more pallets to make cots with the blankets, and wall in our small area with plastic sheeting to retain more heat. The girls split up into teams, one checking all the doors and windows to be sure they were locked, the other scrounging wood so we could at least warm ourselves with the stove.   
Myself, I stacked the food cans by a corner I picked for myself, to be sure no one got any sneaky ideas. With that done, I shrugged off my backpack to sit in the large brick sill of the nearest unbroken upper window and gazed out into the marshlands to our north where the distant shapes of the Wyverns soared through the sky.  
*What I wouldn’t give for a dry pair of socks, and a fish kabob.*  
From the hustle and bustle of our miniature encampment, Lucille shuffled over to where I sat, and sank onto the opposite end of the brickwork. “Do you think Andrea’s okay?”  
I glanced at her, the poor girl looking as worn-out as me, the two of us pale and sluggish in our fatigue. Truth be told, I had no idea what to think of Andrea’s whereabouts. She’d chosen to stay behind, to charge back across that field under a hail of bullets, with soldiers closing in on foot from both directions. Her odds were slim, and even if she hadn’t caught lead, I doubted the wicked Organs would be gentle with the beautiful insurgent leader if they captured her. Still, she had proven too smart for them before. Perhaps her luck would hold.  
“She’s tough.” At my stretch, a wonderful *pop* came from my lower back, and I couldn’t help but sigh in ecstasy as the tightness there ebbed away. “And fast. If anyone could have made it back to the houses, she would.”  
Lucille pulled her legs up to her chest, Andrea’s rifle hugged close to her as if the thing were made of solid gold. “I didn’t mean what I said. I don’t hate her. I just . . . I can’t stand when people treat me like I’m still in kindergarten.”  
“She only wanted to protect you.” I jerked a thumb at the marsh below us, where the Speaker Crabs clustered around the deer carcass, uninterested in us with so much abundant food at their disposal. “It’s a dangerous world out there.”  
“But I can handle it.” She stuck her chin out with stubborn pride, in a way that looked so very much like Andrea. “I’m thirteen, not six. On my birthday, I snuck off once with some friends, and we killed three Mailboxes all by ourselves. Jason even kissed me afterward.”  
My eyebrow rose. “Jason?”  
Her face tinged red, and Lucille’s pride melted into embarrassment. “We mainly hung out because Andrea didn’t like him. She said he was too old for me. He was kind of a jerk anyway, so it didn’t matter.”  
“How old was he?” I rested my back against the smooth brick, and fought the urge to nod off.  
Her face turned redder. “Seventeen.”  
*Sounds like Jason was cutting things rather close, wasn’t he?*  
Shifting in my cold, hard seat, I did my best to be tactful. “So, you guys kissed, and . . ?”  
Lucille shut both eyes and hung her head. “And nothing. We broke up. He wanted to, you know, go further, but I just . . . I wasn’t . . .”  
“Ready?” A sympathetic smile crossed my face, and I remembered how chivalrous Chris had been, how gentle and kind, never pushing further than I asked. I’d been fortunate, even if he crushed my heart like glass by kissing Jamie, that my first boyfriend had been a man who didn’t try to rip my clothes off for a quick thrill.  
“Yeah.” Lucille dug her thumbnail into the powdery mortar between the bricks, avoiding my eyes. “So, I got my first kiss and dumped, all on my birthday. Pretty sad, huh?”  
*Sad the kid didn’t get his creepy neck wrung. If my dad caught some junior in high school following me around while I was in the seventh grade, the boy would have been buried in the local park. Even mom would have lost her mind.*  
I tilted my head to one side and thought back to all the times I’d moped about being single when stuck on the road with Matt and Carla. “Nothing sad about not being ready, especially that young.”  
She rolled her eyes at me, and Lucille’s rebellious tone came back. “Of course *you* would say that, you’re an adult, no one tells you what to—”  
“I’ve never slept with anyone.” I offered the words like an olive branch, and watched her face contort in surprise.  
“Really?”  
“Really.”  
Her frown deepened, and Lucille scooted closer, confused. “But . . . don’t you have someone back at the reserve?”  
Pain sliced through my chest, but I smothered it with a deep inhale, and blinked to steady myself. “Just because you’ve never *been* with someone doesn’t mean you can’t love them. You shouldn’t share yourself with a guy unless he earns your trust, and sometimes that takes a while. If Jason was worth your time, he’d wait until you were ready.”  
*And older. Much, much older. Preferably with a stable job, and a ring.*  
Oblivious to my stringent musings, Lucille looked down at her ragged knees in contemplation. “That’s what Andrea said when I told her. Then she made me promise not to hang out with him anymore. I guess she also threatened to shoot him if he came near me.”  
I grinned, imagining the fiery rebuke Andrea would have slung at the boy. “Maybe he had it coming.”  
Lucille’s face twitched into a small smile, a sheepish one that looked more normal for a thirteen-year-old than the morose expressions the resistance often wore. “Maybe.”  
We both sat in silence for a while, listening to some frogs chirp their various songs from the swamp, and the hollow peels of thunder from a distant storm coming in from the west. Smaller flying lizard-like things cawed to each other in the trees, and a flock of Ringer Heads blinked their cell-phone heads at each other in the treetops, a kaleidoscope of screens that hissed with white fuzz. The wood stove flared to life, and I smelled the familiar aroma of charred wood fill the room, warm and comforting. Some of the feeling came back to my abused feet, and I wanted more than anything to lie down.  
Lucille turned to me, and tightened her arms around both legs with a shiver that wasn’t all from the wet clothes. “So . . . are all the mutants that big out here?”  
“Some.” Stripping the damp jacket from around my shoulders, I motioned for her to do the same as we moved toward the hot stove with the others. “The big ones are pretty easy to predict. It’s the stuff our size and smaller that are really scary.”  
Down to her T-shirt, jeans, and bare feet, Lucille held her hands over the glowing louvers in the stove and angled one elbow at the Wyverns flying over the distant horizon. “So, how do you guys survive out here, with stuff like that flying around?”  
“It’s really not that hard.” I relished the heat that wafted off the squat iron box, shoulder-to-shoulder with the other children as we all took turns beside the fire. “Just don’t make a lot of noise, never cook food where you sleep, and hide your scent any way you can.”  
Her eyes widened in understanding, and Lucille rubbed her palms together to generate friction. “What else?”  
More eyes were on me now, the rest of the group overhearing or conversation, and I found myself at the center again, the curious teens pushing me close to the fire so I would have the energy to speak.  
“Every mutant is different.” I sat on a stack of pallets the boys pushed together, and everyone ringed the stove in hushed anticipation. “The Technos are the ones made from machines and metal, while Organics are made from plants or meat. The main thing you need to remember is that they live for survival; if you want to beat them, then you have to think that way too.”  
As the morning stretched into mid-day, the children bombarded me with questions, too curious about everything to let me curl up under a musty blanket to sleep. Seated in the luxurious glow of the fire, I did my best to answer them as the rain dripped outside, the Speaker Crabs played their creaky retro music in the swamp, and the crickets called from the grass. In a strange twist of fate, I found myself in Jamie and Chris’s shoes, now the guide instead of the lost, the hardened ranger leading inexperienced city-dwellers into the haunted abyss. Part of me felt proud of that, though another part clenched tight in my chest with endless anxiety. There was still so much I didn’t know, and yet these kids looked at me with awe-inspired eyes as I recounted my journeys in the southlands, my harrowing trip through the wastes of Collingswood, and my role as mutant-bait during Puppet hunts. I was barely older than they were, and yet to them I was a traveler of the unknown, some mystical drifter from the forbidden wasteland ELSAR had tried to keep them from, an oracle of the darkness that had swallowed their old world. They stared at my eyes, whispered to each other about the streaks of gold in my hair, and leaned close when I talked about New Wilderness and our factions.  
For the first time ever, I was the expert in the room.  
When they finally retired to their respective cots, I sat up for a little while longer, going over the old escape route on my homemade map, and trying to chart a new one on the topographical map we’d found. Another day would put us in New Wilderness, but I had a feeling we would all wake up sore and hungry sometime in the evening. For certain we would have to wait until the next morning to resume our march, since I wasn’t about to risk more travel at night. The fact that we hadn’t run into anything face-to-face so far was a miracle in and of itself.  
*If we cut through this ridgeline, we could make up a few miles . . . but its going to be high, look how close the lines are together, and were going to be sore from today . . . this might not even be accurate anymore, after all it was printed in 1984 . . .*  
I froze, and a thought clicked in my mind like a puzzle piece sliding into place. 1984. The map Jamie and I had stolen from the records room had been from the same year.  
Peering down at the swirls of green, blue, and brown in the crackling firelight, I felt my heart skip a beat.  
There it was, the green clearing where the coordinates led, less than three miles from where I sat drying my socks. This could be my chance to find the truth, the reason why Rodney Carter had guarded the tiny metal key with his life, and why ELSAR wanted it so bad. Granted, I might not get far if there was some kind of door to unlock since I didn’t have the key on my person, but at least I could see what the mystery item was, and maybe even hide it in case Jamie or ELSAR came looking.  
“Assuming they haven’t found it already.” I grunted under my breath, tracing a new route with a stubby pencil on the map.  
In a slow-moving bundle of dark gray cotton-ball clouds, a thunderstorm ground slowly across the horizon, and something about it made my skin ripple with goosebumps. Like my young wards, there remained so much out there that I didn’t know . . . but with a little luck, I could solve one more mystery before my return to New Wilderness.  
Soon, however, my tired body won out, and I tucked the map under my head to curl up by the window, baked into a lovely warmth by the weak sunlight. Echoes of thunder whispered in my ears, and the stove popped with merry delight over its wooden scraps. Jumbled tunes floated from the wandering Speaker Crabs below, and in my dreams I was back with Chris on that rug in his room, dancing in his arms, wishing the moment would never end.
