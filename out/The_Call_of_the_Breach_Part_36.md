[\[Part 37\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1k83hj1/the_call_of_the_breach_part_37/)

Soft wind kissed my face, a cool summer breeze that bore the sweetness of fresh blossoms, laced with the rustle of a thousand blades of grass. Light filtered through the skin of my closed eyelids, and the generous warmth of the sun flowed over me, a familiar radiance that drove the chill from my skin bit by bit. Tender patches of vegetation cushioned each limb, lush clover, ryegrass, and speltz damp with the morning’s dew. Birds chirped to one another somewhere overhead, and insects hummed amongst the grass in the world began its day.

I blinked, my eyes fluttered open as air rushed into my lungs and squinted against the bright sunshine.

*Am . . . am I dead?*

All around me knee-high grass stretched out in a wide clearing between tall forests of swaying pines, and puffy cotton-ball clouds drifted across a sapphire blue sky above them. Golden sunlight beamed across the expanse, the sun rising just above the horizon, and the last colorful streaks of the sunrise were beginning to fade away. A fat green cricket climbed to the top of a nearby blade of grass to jump to another, and somewhere nearby, a frog croaked. Despite the earliness of the hour it was warm, as if mid-June, and something about the scene moved my heart with astonishment.

I knew this place.

Boots padded over the surrounding greenery toward me, and a blurry figure steadily came into focus as he bent down to offer one calloused hand. “You did well, *filia mea.*”

The stranger beamed at me with all the pride of a father whose child has just won some major award, and his silver irises danced with a light almost more brilliant than the rising sun’s. He no longer wore the yellow chemical suit, but had removed it to reveal a bizarre outfit underneath, one made from buckskin and hides like someone from centuries before my own. A cord of braided sinew around his head kept the long sterling-gray hair out of his eyes, and a white cloth sash hung around his waist. On the stranger’s back, he wore a knapsack made from similar material as his jacket and pants, and it seemed to bulge with the belongings of a traveling craftsman. Antique tools were wrapped in cloth and tied to the sides, a small mallet, a set of chisels, a surface plane, one of those old-fashioned hand-crank drills, and a small wood saw. No weapons adorned his belt; nothing save for an assortment of small pouches, from which my heightened sense of smell picked up the aroma of various herbs and plants. Some I recognized as healing plants that Eve and her people used, while others were foreign to me. Hanging by a loop on his pack the single metal lantern swung by its iron ring, still lit despite the daylight, and the flame atop its wick never wavered for a moment.

Confused, I accepted the stranger’s hand and staggered to my feet to cast around myself. “Where . . . where are we?”

“Tauerpin Road.” He waved one hand at the tranquil scene before us, and the stranger gave me his opposite arm to lean on, which I took without question as we walked through the grassy field. “Or rather, Tauerpin Road as it should have been. With the Breach sealed, this place has been cleansed of the evil that infected it, and so now the sun can rise here for the first time. A new beginning, a fresh start; one I’ve been looking forward to for quite some time.”

My eyebrows arched on my forehead, and I looked at him in curious wonder. “You knew this would happen?”

That seemed to amuse him, and the stranger laughed, but not the cruel, eerie, manipulative laugh of someone like Koranti or Vecitorak; this one was filled with a kindness that put me at ease and reminded me of my own father’s smile. “Of course I did. No world is made by accident, *filia mea*; everything has a place, a purpose, and a time of rejuvenation. Here a new story will begin, and life will take its course as it always does.”

Our path led to another section of the field, and I found myself looking up at a familiar concrete structure, but my jaw almost dropped at seeing it. The old concrete tower stood adorned in a coat of green vines, from which bloomed a cascade of white, purple, and pink flowers. A small herd of deer grazed nearby, Bone-Faced Whitetail adapted to the sun’s rays, their long antlers still aglow with the faint green aura of the night. On the far side of the clearing, a large Armored Black Bear dug through an old stump for grub, grunting happily in the morning haze. None of them were so much as bothered by our approach, and despite myself, I couldn’t feel any kind of fear or alarm at them either.

*So beautiful . . . how can this be the same place?*

Looking down at myself, I saw my burned, bloodied, dented armor, and felt my old worry resurface. I’d been right next to the beacon when it went off, had felt the high-frequency waves shredding my tissue like razor blades. By all metrics, I should be a hemorrhaged, bloody pulp lying somewhere in the rainy shadows of the Breach. “Am I dead?”

One weathered hand patted mine, the skin rough but the gesture less so, and the stranger fixed me with a patient half-smile. “Death is only the turning of a page, not the end of the story itself. However, this is not where your story ends, Hannah. Does that frighten you?”

“Maybe a little.” For some reason, admitting it made me feel guilty, as though I was letting the man down, and I avoided his gaze to stare at my dew-soaked boots in the grass. “I just don’t understand how you . . . I mean, if you knew all this, if you can see or control the future, then why have so many awful things happened? You could have warned me, could have made it so the bad things were avoided, but you didn’t. *Why?*”

A small flicker of grief flitted across his empathetic features, and the stranger nodded his head in the direction we were going. “Walk a little further with me, I have something to show you.”

Around the base of the old tower we circled, and I watched swarms of honeybees attend to the many blossoms, while the *slap* of a beaver tail on a nearby pond told me its denizens were hard at work. It was hard to imagine this gorgeous wilderness covered in rainy darkness, pockmarked by howling shadows, and seared with the fires of war. The very air tasted sweeter here, the earth steady under my boots, no sign of foul bogs or rotting foliage anywhere. A new world, washed clean of the old corruption, and set on the path to its own destiny.

*Hang on . . . that’s new.*

My eyes picked up on something ahead of us, and I cocked my head to one side, puzzled. A single white oak tree had sprouted near the base of the tower, and stood roughly twice my height, its rounded leaves fanned out in the cozy sunlight. Long spirals had been cut through the tree’s bark, as if it had been struck by lightning but grew on healthy nonetheless. Try as I might, I couldn’t remember seeing in the old Tauerpin Road, but the answer came to me in a sudden thunderclap of memory.

“Vecitorak,” I whipped my head to look at the stranger, and pointed to the tree. “I saw him fall with the Oak Walker. He got all tangled up in the roots . . .”

Tilting his head back to gaze up at the branches in thought, the stranger let out a sigh. “Darkness like that of the Void only serves one master and destroys those who attempt to wield it. He gave away the most valuable thing he had for something that was never truly his, and thus lost both his human life, and his cursed body. Vecitorak has been banished from your world to this one, imprisoned in the very growth that he inflicted on so many others. Here he will remain, festering in his own corruption, until those who will come to inhabit this world must strike him down to prevent his evil from spreading.”

Frowning, I held on to the man’s arm under the shade of the pale oak tree, taking comfort in him being close. “So, he’s not dead?”

“He wanted immortality.” The stranger shook his head at the tree as if in disappointment of it and shrugged. “And so, he gained it, though not in the way he hoped. His power will never be what it once was, but he will always remain a creature of the Void and will hate those who come from the sunlit lands with undying hatred.”

“But you said he’ll try to spread evil here.” I shuddered at the tree, and imagined the evil fiend trapped inside it, fused with the trunk like he’d done to Madison and the others. “Why let him live at all? If he stays to corrupt this world, the people here will have the same trouble with him that we did.”

A smile returned to the stranger’s kind face, and he gave my arm a gentle squeeze. “And where would your story be, Hannah, if he had been struck from your world at the start? Even imprisoned in that tree, Vecitorak has a role to play in another story, another life, another struggle between myself and my oldest opponent. Here, much like there, I will call another to challenge him, and shape that person’s life as I have yours.”

Those words made my heart skip a beat, and I met his eyes with mine again, baffled. The more he spoke, the more I learned about this strange man, and I couldn’t decide if I was more bewildered at what he said, or my own readiness to accept it as truth. He’d known all along how things would go, both with me and everyone else, to the last detail. Not only that, but he’d acted in it, orchestrated everything like some grand theatre master behind a curtain, the rest of us mere actors in his play. How far had this extended? Had it begun at the borders of Barron County? Had it begun in Louisville? It occurred to me that this might have been going on my entire life, a cosmic conspiracy that I was only aware of because I had been allowed to see behind the curtain. Yet, I could sense in some odd way that none of it had been out of any sort of malice; the stranger had done this out of a deeper sense of caring than I could grasp, and of the entire troupe of characters in this bizarre tale, he’d decided to reveal himself to me.

With the sensation of a heavy weight on my shoulders, I tore my eyes from his once more and narrowed my eyes at the tree in a desperate bid to make sense of it. “So, what was the point, then? I mean, if what you’re saying is true, if you’ve been planning this all along, why did you need me to do anything? Why not stop him yourself?”

“And where would that leave you if I had?” The stranger nodded at my hand, and I realized in my subconscious doubt that I had reached up to grasp my wedding ring hung by its chain around my neck, alongside the engagement ring Chris had given me. “If you never came to Barron County you would have lived the rest of your life in Louisville, without ever meeting your husband or your best friend. You would have remained as you were, lost and alone in your doubts, your fears, your failures. Tell me, child, would that have been a kindness to you?”

I hadn’t thought of that in a while, and standing there beside him in that ethereal paradise, it made my chest tighten in melancholy. True, I missed my parents, my house, all the comforts of my modern life, but what kind of life would it be without Chris? What if I had never seen his handsome smile, kissed him in his room while slow dancing to Glenn Miller, let him hold me in those strong arms that made me feel safer than anything else in the world? What if I had never met Jamie, but stayed with Matt and Carla instead, believing their shallow indifference was what true friendship looked like? All those range days, the early morning runs around the fort, the trips to the market in New Wilderness, they would never have existed. Jamie would never have got me that beautiful blue dress or threw that surprise party for me. I could have lived my life the same way I’d been living it until I died . . . and it would have been a miserable thing compared to what I’d gained.

*I don’t deserve it. I don’t deserve any of it. This doesn’t make any sense.*

“Why *me?*” My guts churned in a growing anticipation, the man next to me unknown like the depths of the sea, but I couldn’t tear myself away from him. “There are lots of other lives at stake here besides mine. I wasn’t . . . I’m *not*, anyone special. Take away the mutations, *the focus*, and I’m still the same old Hannah.”

“Are you?” He raised one gray eyebrow at me, and the stranger threw me a knowing grin. “The girl I knew from Kentucky would never have run into that spider nest all on her own. The old Hannah cared too much about herself, what she wanted, what she thought she needed to be in order to be happy. She was lost, lost in herself, and the only way for you to become who you are was to bring you here. Do you believe I made a mistake?”

Shame burned hot on my cheeks, and I blinked hard at tears that threatened to crest my eyelids, knowing I was the least of all people who deserved this. “No, I . . . I don’t know. Like you said, I didn’t mean to come here, none of this was my idea. If I had known, I would have run the other way, so why pick me?”

For a moment, he was silent, and I refused to face him in case my worst fears came true. Had I let him down somehow? It shouldn’t have bothered me so much, but after everything I knew, everything I’d seen, this man felt almost as close to me as my own father. He had done so much for me, and I wanted to understand, but felt so inadequate to the enormous truth he’d laid out before me.

A hand touched my shoulder and guided me along the turf beneath the tree. “Look closer, *filia mea*.”

Sniffling, I almost didn’t see the corpse in time and nearly stepped right into the fetid ribcage.

I yelped in horror, and jumped back, covering my mouth in disgust.

It had been a girl, that much I could tell from the moldy tangles of hair, but the skeletal remains were so badly rotted that I couldn’t make out much else. Her clothes were tattered and brown with decay, the flesh withered and shrunken, pierced by dozens of worm holes. No eyes remained in the empty sockets, the mouth gaped open in a silent scream, but upon looking at it, I felt a stab of sadness in my chest. It was as faint as a butterfly’s wingbeat, but with each passing second, the certainty grew in my heart that I knew her.

*Madison.*

Standing over her, the stranger glanced at me, then at the body. “Why do you think it was *you* who had to be the one to release her soul from the Oak Walker’s spirit? As you said, why you, out of so many others? Why let this happen at all?”

Released from the comforting brace of his arm, I folded both arms across my chest and wiped at my face as the tears persisted. “I-I don’t know.”

“*What would you do for love?*” Two silver irises caught mine, and the stranger pointed to Madison’s remains. “She gave her life for it. You did the same when you leapt from that tower. Anyone who lays down their life out of love gives a gift, a light so strong that even the powers of darkness cannot quench it. That is why her soul was protected from Vecitorak’s blade, and why your soul was connected to hers after the dark priest stabbed you. You shared a kindred spirit, one of love, and Vecitorak could not understand because he had given away the part of himself that could produce such things.”

Forcing myself to stare at the corpse, I dug my thumbnail into a tear in my uniform sleeve as a distraction from my looming guilt. “And now she’s dead. I killed her with that offering. Some hero I am.”

“It’s not about who you are, child.” An expression of pity on his handsome face, the stranger shook his head at me and knelt beside the corpse. “It’s about the path laid out for you. You didn’t choose it, which means when you walk, you must walk out of trust in the one who charted your course.”

Reaching down, the stranger took one of the gray corpse hands in his own and caressed the dead girl’s matted hair with his opposite palm. Something on the stranger’s face changed, and I watched a single, shining tear appear on his own face. It made my own seem thin and pathetic in comparison, as if for this man to weep meant something that a part of me couldn’t fully comprehend. It hurt to see him hurt, his grief contagious, the sorrow in his eyes like nothing I’d ever seen in my life.

He peered down into the empty eye sockets of the corpse with his own silver irises, and the man leaned close to whisper into the wrinkled remains of an ear. “*Filia mea*, *expergiscere*.”

My heart stopped, the air stuck in both lungs, and I stood transfixed.

Like the first tongues of flame at the start of a fire, shoots of color began to spread out through the dead flesh, turning the gray to soft peach pink. Holes sealed, muscles knitted themselves together, bones rejoined with dull *clicks* and *clacks*. Like a tide, color flowed up the arm, over the shoulder, and down the corpse’s torso to her legs. The clothes brightened, the decayed scraps giving way to khaki pants and a black polo shirt, with leather-brown work boots around her feet. Lastly, the rot was driven from the girl’s face, the moldy hair turned to a silky auburn, and two eyelids drew shut over the sockets as they filled in with healthy tissue.

Her chest rose, and Madison’s lips parted as she drew in a long, deep breath.

*What the . . .*

I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe, stunned by what I’d just seen. Of all the insane, otherworldly things I’d witnessed up until now, this rocked me to my core and sent chills through me. The stranger had always struck me as somewhat unnatural, but this . . . this was different. Neither the Breach, nor the radiation, nor electromagnetic energy could do what this man had done, a deed beyond Professor Carheim’s books on philosophy, ELSAR’s test tubes, or the coalition’s fireside rumors about the world outside our gates. No, this was something older, something powerful, an inescapable reality that crowned all others.

Two blue eyes fluttered open, and Madison squinted up at the stranger with surprise. “Who are you?”

“A friend.” The mournful expression washed from his bearded face at her words, and the stranger helped Madison sit up in the cool shade of the oak tree. “You’ve been asleep for a long time. I’ve come to take you home.”

“Home?” She blinked, and Madison seemed to come to her senses, her pretty face falling into a grimace. “Oh my . . . how long have I been gone? I lost track of the days, the time. My parents are going to freak out.”

“Unfortunately, they left some time ago.” With a wince of pity, the stranger sat beside her on the ground. “Your father took the family to Idaho after you didn’t come back. They are waiting for you there.”

“*Idaho*?” Her blue eyes flooded with tears, and the horrible memories must have rushed back, as Madison pulled both knees to her chest to wrap her arms around them. “I tried to get out but he . . . the hooded man he . . . it all hurt so much, I couldn’t move, and I thought . . .”

Her words choked into a muffled sob, but the stranger pulled Madison into his embrace and held her with fatherly tenderness. “Shhh. There’s no need for that now. It’s over.”

That seemed to calm her a little, but still Madison clung to him and choked out another painful whisper. “Mark. It killed Mark. He tried to protect me and—”

“I know Mark.” Pulling back, the stranger used his thumbs to wipe away her tears and dug into the pouches on his belt in search of something. “He and I talk often. Before I came here, he asked me to bring you this.”

In his palm, the stranger held out a small golden pocket watch, one I recognized from my own brief memories in the flaming tower. However, this one appeared slightly different; the open lid showed a new inscription on the inside, and from where I stood, my enhanced eyes picked up the words with ease.

*Until our next meeting.*

Madison took the watch in her hands as if it were a bird’s egg, her open-mouthed shock a mix of joy and renewed heartbreak. “H-He’s alive?”

“In a different place, somewhere far from here.” Rising to his feet, the stranger helped Madison to hers, and brushed some grass from her hair like a father readying his daughter for her first day at school. “A good land where the flowers never fade, and the river runs sweet forever. I’ll take you there someday, provided you stick to the path I show you.”

Her face turned to a desperate frown, and Madison swiveled her head around to look behind them, trying to find the path he’d mentioned on the ground somewhere nearby. “Why can’t we go now?”

“There is so much more for you to do yet, my child.” Steady despite her impatience, the stranger pressed Madison’s fingers closed over the watch with his own. “Mark’s road is at its end in my far green country, but yours has many miles left to go. There are others who will need you in their story, and their love will make the journey an easy one.”

Madison let out a long huff of disappointment, but nodded as it seemed the grief left her, and at that moment she turned to catch sight of me.

*I guess this is first impressions then.*

Flushed, with the tingling heat in my face as if I’d walked into the wrong room back at the college dormitories, I made a feeble wave. “Hi.”

“I know you.” Madison’s countenance brightened, as if we had been old friends once, long ago. “I saw you in a dream or . . . or something like that. You’re Hannah, right?”

Relieved and intrigued at her recognition, I pushed some stray hairs out of my face. “Yeah. I saw you too, kind of. I’m glad you’re okay.”

She looked over my uniform and armor, Madison’s face contorting in amazement at the gold in my hair and eyes. “Are you from New Wilderness?”

*Where do I even begin?*

“It’s a long story.” I rubbed at the back of my neck, unsure if telling her about the war would be a good idea. After all, the poor girl had just woken up from literal death, she didn’t need more trauma to deal with. “But the Oak Walker is dead, for good this time. No one will ever be hurt by it again.”

Something about that statement made red tinge across her cheekbones, and Madison squeezed her eyes shut for a few seconds in embarrassed shame. “I had no idea. You have to believe me, I didn’t know this was going to happen. I just . . . I wanted Mark’s death to mean something.”

“And it did.” I stepped closer to her and gestured to the tower, the tree, the paradise around us. “All of this is thanks to him, and to you. It meant more than you could possibly know.”

Her emotion pooled around the girl’s eyelids much as mine did, but Madison made a smile that hadn’t seen the sunlight for far too long and turned to the stranger. “So, Idaho huh?”

Waiting patiently by the tree, the stranger hefted his pack on his broad shoulders. “I think it’s time we were off. Your parents have missed you for long enough. Besides, this place isn’t meant for either of you; it has its own purpose to fulfill, and the sooner we go, the sooner it can begin.”

A twinge of nervousness went through me at the thought of what might come next, and I stuffed my hands into my trouser pockets to keep them from shaking. “What about me?”

The stranger flicked his eyes to a gap in the nearby tree line, where a small, but well-beaten trail led off into the forest. “If you wish, there is a path here to guide you back to Louisville; should you take it, Christopher and Jamie will go with you, and you will awake to find yourself with them in a local park near your old house. None of you will ever be able to find Barron County again, and it will vanish from this world with all those left here, but you three will live a full and peaceful life in the world you know.”

The air stung in my chest, the prospect of getting my friends to safety so close I could taste it, but I hesitated. “Is that my only option?”

He granted me a grin of approval and the stranger angled his head at the base of the flower-covered tower, where a small metal man door sat in the aged concrete. “If you wish to return to Barron County, all you need to do is walk through that door. However, you should know that you will never see your home in Kentucky again; for once I close the Breach, you and everyone in Barron will pass from this world into another, in order to maintain the balance between all creations. The Breach itself will seal as soon as you return, without the beacons of ELSAR, but in seven days’ time Barron County will slip through the gate, and you will spend the rest of your life in the place from which the missiles came.”

My feet seemed glued to the ground, and I chewed my lip in desperation to figure out a solution. On one hand, I wanted nothing more than to have the best of both worlds; to take Chirs and Jamie back to the tranquility of our world, where no monsters lurked, and both my parents waited for me in our snug home. Chris and I could have another wedding where Jamie wouldn’t have to hide in a suit of armor, my dad could walk me down the aisle, and my mom could help me with my dress. We could move into Chris’s house in Pennsylvania, raise our kids in a peaceful neighborhood, and spend our lives in relative comfort. Jamie could find someone new, raise a family of her own, and put the past behind her as we did. It could be so nice, so easy, so good.

*And Chris would never be president. He would never get to build that library he wanted, or those schools, or hand out those toy soldiers at Christmas. Jamie would have nothing to do without being a Ranger, and she’ll never get over Chris. If I go back, if I take them with me . . . would we really be living, or just existing?*

That thought soured the rosy vision, and I glanced at the tower door. “So, this other world . . . how bad is it?”

“Much of it has become like what you’ve seen thus far.” The stranger hooked his thumbs in the straps on his pack and watched me carefully. “Infested with mutants, drained of hope, where the nights grow longer and longer. Few have survived in that world, clinging to life amid the ruins, but once Barron County passes into it, the world you go to will also see the sealing of *its* Breach, and thus the tide will turn. Man will reconquer what was lost, and the darkness will recede with time. All the same, it is a dangerous road, and justice must yet be done in the old world. If you should choose it, your suffering will increase even further before the end, and you will weep as your heart bleeds. Weigh your next words carefully, Hannah.”

If the first option had been complicated, this one was even worse. If I understood him correctly, we would be plunged *through* the Breach itself, until Barron County ended up in the Silo 48 timeline, where the world had come to an apocalyptic end in the mid 1950’s. I would never see Louisville Kentucky again, or at least, not the one I knew and loved; my parents wouldn’t exist, my house wouldn’t exist, and even if I should journey there and find my street, it wouldn’t be home.

Yet, I would have a new home; a home with Chris, one built by our hands in the rugged wilderness. We would raise our children together, grow old together, and be buried together. Yes, we would face the dangers of a world overrun by mutants, but we’d already been doing that for months now. He would lead our nation forward, and I would be there by his side, the two of us against the world, as it had always been. Despite the horrendous risks, the dangers, it felt right in a way nothing else ever had.

*At least I’d get to live my life with the man I love . . . not everyone gets that option.*

I glanced at Madison, then at the tower door, and sucked in a deep breath to steady myself. “I don’t deserve this.”

“No one does.” A knowing glint played about the starry eyes of the stranger, and he shrugged. “That’s kind of the point. You didn’t choose me; I chose you. I chose to bring you to Ohio, I chose to turn Vecitorak’s infection into life-saving power, and I chose to give you a gift you have yet to receive . . . a secret that I give you now.”

With that, he leaned closer, and as he whispered the secret to me, I felt myself rocked with another heart-stopping flood of emotions. Joy, surprise, and excitement each took their turns with me, but I didn’t say anything, didn’t want to interrupt until he’d told me everything he was going to say. I didn’t have to think for a second if it was true; deep down, I knew it was, and that lit a fire inside that nothing could quench.

*I have to ask.*

Overwhelmed with the desire to know exactly who I was dealing with, I looked up at him, and thought of everything this stranger had done for me. He’d appeared from seemingly nowhere, protected me, guided me, even in the depths of my worst despairs. Never once had he hurt me, betrayed me, or cast me aside. Every time I’d been alone, this man had come to my aide, and the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I couldn’t just walk away without knowing the truth.

Staring into his soft silver irises, I gathered my courage to speak up. “Who are you?”

His face shone, as if the stranger had been waiting for years to hear those words, and he never broke his gaze from me. “Who do you say that I am?”

My heart screeched to a stop in my chest as I recognized the words Adam had spoken during my wedding, read from an ancient book. Part of me had always wondered, had peered out from behind my barricade of uncertainty, but never dared to hope for anything substantial. Even after everything I’d seen and experienced, this hit me like a ton of bricks.

I knew who he was, had seen his name etched in wood, painted in gold, and heard it whispered by the lips of my kin at Ark River.

*A name above all names.*

He turned to go, and I couldn’t help but reach out to catch hold of the calloused hand once more. “Don’t leave me.”

The gentle face softened at my begging, and He pulled me into a fierce embrace that made me feel a sense of peace I hadn’t known possible. “Never since the day you were made have I ever left you. I’m always here. You just have to look closer.”

Fresh tears streaming down my face, I clung to Him, and for the first time in my life, I let go of all my doubts.

A weight lifted from somewhere deep inside me, the guilt, fear, shame, and anxiety from a hundred sleepless nights evaporating all at once. I didn’t have all the answers, but I didn’t need them. I trusted, and that was enough.

He brushed a stray lock of hair from my face and wiped away my tears to kiss my forehead. “Go in peace, *filia mea*.”

A sense of calm flowed through me at His words, and as if my eyes had been opened, I realized then what He’d been calling me all along, the language unfolding in my head like an elegant silk banner caught in the wind.

*Daughter of mine.*

They strode toward the winding gravel of the nearby road, but Madison turned back one last time to run for me.

Her arms flew around my shoulders, and Madison squeezed me tight, her own voice choked up. “Thank you for coming back for me.”

My own throat swelled with the bittersweet goodbye, and I fought to keep it at bay as I returned her hug. “Good luck in Idaho.”

I watched them go, hand in hand down the long sun-dappled road into the distance until the trees hid them from sight. My mind whirled at what I’d witnessed, what had happened to me in the past few minutes, and the secret I’d been given to carry with me back to my world. There was more coming, I knew, more pain, suffering and death, but for now . . . for now, I felt peace.

A peace that surpassed all my understanding.

*I’m coming home, Chris.*

Turning the handle on the tower door, I swung the metal door open, and before my first step even touched the ground, I felt myself pulled down into unconsciousness once again.
