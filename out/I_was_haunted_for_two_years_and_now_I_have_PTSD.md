This is a pretty old story, I've debated if I should post this for a while now, as I suffered from PTSD for YEARS after all the events transpired, but my therapist suggested I should do it as a form of "cleanse". I won’t bother trying to convince anyone if this story is real or not, I’m just making this post as part of my therapy (I might consider answering to some comments… or maybe not at all). Regardless, I'll give a bit of context before I actually start recounting the events as this is a VERY long story.

I moved in with my father when I was 14 because I couldn’t stand to live with my mother at the time and I also wanted to help my dad as my mother was making his life miserable with the alimony payments he needed to make for me and my sister. Moving in with him was the best decision ever and I did not regret it at all. Things all changed when my dad lost his job when I was 21 and going to college. At this point both me and my younger sister, who already had given birth to my niece, were moved in with my father and we were extremely happy living with him. For context I live in Puerto Rico and it’s a small island so it’s very normal for college students to live with their parents here. After my father lost his job, I saw him struggle to make ends meet to keep my sister, niece and myself living with him so we decided it was for the best to move in temporarily with my mother, while my dad could get his finances back on track. This is where the story actually begins…

My mother lived with my stepfather, a self-made man with his own company, in a house he had recently purchased in a rather wealthy area of Puerto Rico. This house was rather big but since day one something in my gut just didn’t sit right with it. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it, but since nothing was really going on initially, I just figured it was paranoia and too many scary movies. When we moved in, the people living in the house consisted of my mother, stepfather, my two younger stepsisters, my younger sister, my niece and myself; too many of us if you ask me. Each and every one of us had our particular struggles and it really did seem like the space was way too chaotic for anyone’s good. In retrospect, I’m guessing this is what made whatever haunted us to stick to us and the house.

At first it started out very subtle and it targeted my sister. She had it the worst out of all of us. My mother was overly critical of her for having a baby at 17, she suffered from depression and had already attempted to take her life once at that point. Having the knowledge I have today, it’s clear to me why she was the first to be targeted. She started suffering from constant nightmares, her depression worsened again, and just a constant general unease at all times while being within the house. She confided in me all these things and I truly believed what she was experiencing.

Then one Tuesday morning, I was fast asleep in my bed when I started having a horrible nightmare. I woke up from the nightmare only to notice that I couldn’t move at all. My bed sheets seemed to be pinning me to the bed in an unnatural way. I tried to squirm my way out but couldn’t and immediately felt like I was sinking on the bed. I kicked and pleaded for my life until suddenly everything was lifted, and I jolted up from the bed, gasping for air and shaking violently. I left the room, still trembling from the event; up until that point in my life I had never experienced anything like that, so I was pretty confused about what exactly had happened. I went downstairs only to find my sister sitting on a sofa near the entrance of the house with a puzzled look on her face and I could tell she was unwell. I asked her what happened, and she said the words—and I quote—“I’m not sure what happened, but I just feel like I dreamt like my bed sheets were pinning me to the bed and that I was suddenly sinking into my bed.” As soon as she said the words I felt my stomach sink. I knew then and there that something was completely and utterly wrong and that this was not something we could just brush away.

I sat beside her and with trembling words I told her I felt the exact same thing. We both looked at each other for what felt like an hour, and I knew we were both considering what exactly this all meant. We didn’t really talk much about it afterwards. We both didn’t want to admit that we were experiencing something that felt straight out of a horror film, but that was only the beginning, and things just got increasingly worse from there.

As the months rolled by the events in the house became more frequent and more aggressive. Furniture moved, lights turned on and off, windows banged, the house itself shook. Without us telling anyone about what was going on, my stepsisters also started to get involved in it. They started experiencing nightmares and all the crazy things that were going on in the house. I wondered if my mom and stepdad also experienced things, but when we asked them, they just called us crazy and dismissed it like it was nothing. I think I can write a whole book about all the events I experienced but here are some of the most notable ones:

1.       I was sitting in the kitchen table, drawing (I liked to use that space sometimes) when I heard a clicking sound and quickly noticed that the lights in the ceiling, which were all individual lights wired together in the same circuit, were switching on and off individually. I remained frozen from fear looking at the lights until they all switched back on. I started gathering my things to leave when I saw a mote of light coming from the outside. Across from the table where I was sitting was an open door that led to a half bathroom with a large window that looked onto the garage. The light was glowing brightly from within the garage as if a flashlight was being pointed in. The light ran away, but the only place it could have gone was to the backyard which I had complete visibility to my right, through the glass double-doors. But when I looked in that direction, I saw nothing. Like the light just vanished when it was out of sight.

2.       In another occasion I was in the living room, watching TV and my sister was in the kitchen making food for herself and her daughter. When suddenly I heard a loud bang and my sister screaming right after. I ran towards the kitchen only to find my sister petrified looking back at me and ever cabinet in the kitchen opened. When I asked her what that sound was, my sister replied, barely able to make out the words, “they just opened by themselves”.

3.       In another occasion, I was asleep on my bed and randomly woke up in the middle of the night, something that would start to happen very frequently after this point. At this point I had no trouble sleeping with my door completely open, so I turned on the bed to face the side of the room where my door was, and that’s when I locked eyes with it. A tall figure standing at my door looking down on me. As soon as my eyes were locked on it I experienced a full body paralysis that I can’t describe. Unlike sleep paralysis I was fully awake at this moment. I wasn’t groggy or half asleep, I was conscious and staring at something I could not comprehend, something I knew wasn’t human. It was tall, and for some reason I picture “hairy” when I think back at it. The seconds felt like hours and I couldn’t blink, my eyes couldn’t look away, I was forced to stare at it as it stared back at me, until there was a split second where I found the strength to look away. That’s when my body was released, and I spent the rest of the night laying there, panicked and scared, not wanting to look back at the door until the sun came up.

A few months of similar activity passed, and we were starting to grow accustomed to it. We knew at times the lower floor of the house became heavy and scary and that was the signal to leave to the second floor and into our rooms and close the door. Some other times it would follow us into the rooms and give us nightmares, night terrors or sleep paralysis. Some other days, nothing happened. It was unpredictable at best, but slowly but surely things were getting worse, and we all experienced it.

After the one-year mark things started to ramp up quickly. My niece was already a year+ old and we quickly noticed she had a particular affinity for this thing that haunted the house. One day, my sister had to take and early class and asked me if I could drive her niece to her after the class was done so I stayed alone with her in the house. When the time to leave came, I started preparing all the bags, the car seat and things my niece needed. It was all too much for me to carry simultaneously so I carried the things first into the car and left my niece behind for a few seconds while I loaded everything. Once I’m nearly done I hear my niece frantically call to me (in Spanish uncle us “tio” which is very easy for a baby to pronounce early on so she was saying that over and over). When I ran back, she was visibly scared and pointing to a corner of the living room that had absolutely nothing. My heart sank, and I got freaked out. I quickly scooped her up from the floor and we left the house in a hurry, not even bothering to question what happened.

That same night my niece refused to be left even remotely alone, and as a means to calm her, me and my sister slept beside her so she could be calm. A few hours later I started having a nightmare that led into sleep paralysis. I struggled against the sleep paralysis and as soon as I opened my eyes, my niece woke up screaming any my sister as well. We had all experienced a collective sleep paralysis. That was when my sister started looking to move out, by whatever means necessary, and the activity just got worse and worse.

On one specific night, my family, save for one of my stepsisters and myself, was at a concert, and we were left alone in the house. I was downstairs and felt the bottom floor of the house get all scary and heavy so I ran back upstairs and locked myself in my room. Once I got sleepy and climbed into bed, I felt my heart start to jackhammer in my chest, and at this point I knew that what I was feeling meant it was close by and stalking me. I got pissed stood up from my bed and headed into my stepsister’s room, telling her as I entered the room, “listen, that thing is in my room right now, can I sleep with you?” To which my she replied, “sure, but bring your own blanket ‘cus you know I like putting the AC really cold.”

I paused for a moment at the door, thinking that I have to go back into my room where that thing was. I mustered up the courage, headed back into my room, at that point fully panicking. I grabbed my blanket, headed back into my stepsister’s room in almost a sprint, threw the blanket to the bed and then turned around to shut the door. But when the door was about to be shut, I heard and felt a thud. And that’s when my whole body and blood ran cold. I tried again to shut the door, this time visibly shaking, and that thud I will never forget sounded again through the room. It literally felt like there was something between the door and the frame, standing there, preventing me from closing it all the way. I became panicked and frantic, I tried over and over and over to close the door, but it kept getting deflected.

The fear in me was like nothing I had ever experienced in my entire life. As I was doing this, my sister was almost screaming at me to close the door, while crawling back to the bed frame. I tried to reply that I was trying to close the door, but I just stammered out of fear. A few tries later the door was ripped out of my hand and it physically pushed me back onto the bed. The door remained open for about 3 seconds while a menacing aura radiated from the blackness. Right after the door slammed shut on its own, the sound echoing through the whole house. We sat there for minutes, speechless, completely fear stricken, trembling. We didn’t know what had happened, what we saw, but it was one of the most terrifying experiences of our lives. We didn’t sleep much that night. Our family arrived around 2AM from the concert, but we just stayed in the room with the door shut.

The last and final experience that I’ll recount the one that made me leave and never return. Up until this point, everything happened at night, but almost a full 2 years of the haunting had already passed and the demon or spirit or whatever, was at the point where it could just do what it wanted when it wanted. I woke up around 9AM on a Sunday, alone at the house (this happened every once in a while, when my family was out on a trip and I had to stay behind to take tests, study or do college projects), checked my phone to see if I had any calls or messages and just laid there in bed for a moment collecting my thoughts. While lying there, ready to jump from the bed and head out, I noticed something in the corner of my eye. I looked towards the closed door and I saw something I hadn’t seen until that point.

It looked like a transparent figure was standing at my door. It looked like when the pavement is so hot that the air distorts and gives that particular wavy effect when you looked through it, but it was in a humanoid shape as tall as the door. Immediately I knew that it was in my room looking at me, and I saw it move towards me and latch onto me. Immediately I started choking, like the air couldn’t reach my lungs in any way and I began to struggle uselessly. What I could only imagine is that it was choking me. I struggled for a few seconds and then I felt it release me. I scrambled to the door, left my room and ran downstairs where I started to feel an overwhelming sense of drowsiness. I knew it wanted to make me fall asleep, because if I fell asleep I’d be vulnerable again and it could do as it wanted with me (the reason I didn’t just up and leave immediately was because my car was busted at the time and I needed my best friend to pick me up and take me places if I needed transportation).

I refused to fall asleep and for the next few hours I tried everything I could to not fall asleep. About 4 hours passed and I lulled myself into a false sense of security. I was in the living room watching TV and I decided to lay down for just a moment. In less than 2 minutes I was asleep. That’s when it happened. My body flipped so it was facing up to the ceiling, immediately my eyes opened and there it was. After two years of being haunted by the same entity I finally caught a glimpse of it. It was hovering over me, its face still transparent like before, but I could make out faint features of a grotesque but humanoid face inches away from mine. It opened its mouth at me and howled into my face a guttural, demonic, howl that to this day I still dream of it sometimes. The howl lasted a few seconds, feeling something indescribable course through me. Once it finished I immediately jolted up from the sofa. I was both livid and terrified. I was done with the hautings, done with everything, done with living in that shithole of a place. So I packed my things, called my friend and just walked out and never set foot in that house again.

The rest of my family didn’t last long in it as well. I’m not entirely sure if anyone else lives in it afterwards, but I’m almost positive we were the ones responsible for latching that demonic spirit to that place. Too many problems, negative emotions and situations happening while living there.
