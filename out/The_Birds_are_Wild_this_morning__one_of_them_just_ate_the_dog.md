They say country life is slower. Simpler. Cleaner.

That’s why I moved here.

Six months ago, I left the chaos of London behind and took a veterinary post in the Wye Valley, tucked among low ridges and thick, brooding forests. It was a town where no one locked their doors, sheep grazed under telephone lines, and the pub closed when the bartender got tired. My house sat just outside the village—an old stone shell with ivy-strangled gutters and floors that creaked like they remembered better decades.

I came for the silence. The kind that stretches for miles. The kind that leaves you alone with your own breathing.

And until last week, it was perfect.

That’s when the birds got strange.

That’s when one of them ate the dog.

••

The call came just after six.

I’d been up since five, sipping burnt instant coffee and watching mist slither through the hedgerows. No birdsong. No wind. Just the river at the bottom of the field, flat and dull as steel wool.

I remember the way the silence pressed in—like the world had stopped between breaths.

The landline rang like it was trying to wake the house.

*“Dr. Carter,”* I answered.

*“It’s Jack,”* said the voice, sharp and hoarse. *“Something’s wrong.”*

My brain hadn’t caught up yet. *“Wrong how?”*

*“The birds are wild this morning.”*

*“…What birds?”*

There was a pause. His voice dropped a register. *“One of them ate my dog.”*

I thought he was drunk. Or joking.

But his tone was clipped. Bruised with fear.

*“Come out here,”* he said. *“You need to see this.”*

••

Jack Whittaker lived a mile out of town, where the past still had roots. Retired gamekeeper. Proud bastard. Raised a few sheep and chickens, mostly to keep busy. He and his dog, Baxter, were inseparable.

He met me at the gate, shotgun in one hand, eyes sunken and bloodshot. He didn’t speak—just turned and walked.

The coop was still standing, though every bird inside was silent.

Behind it, in a flattened patch of grass, was what was left of Baxter.

I’m no stranger to death. I’ve seen mangled cows, lambs stuck half-born, foxes gutted by combine blades. But this…

Baxter was torn open at the middle, ribs split like snapped tusks. His head was intact—but punctured, clean through the cranium in three places. I’d seen surgical tools leave less deliberate wounds.

*“Tell me this was a dog,”* Jack whispered.

I crouched. The carcass still steamed in the cold. The flesh was too cleanly opened. No ragged tear. No chewing. The kind of wound a butcher makes when he knows exactly where to cut.

I glanced toward the forest. Something in me tightened.

*“What did you see?”*

*“I didn’t.”* He sounded ashamed. *“I heard the chickens go mad, then Baxter barked. I stepped outside and… it was already on him. Dark, low to the ground. Feathers, but not like any bird I’ve ever seen. It moved… wrong. Like it was built to run. Like a scary ostrich”*

He swallowed. *“Its eyes were yellow. Not golden. Yellow.”*

I stood. *“Show me the tracks.”*

••

The ground near the fence line was soft from the night’s frost. And there they were.

Three-toed prints.

Each about the size of my outstretched hand, claws like hooks gouged deep into the mud. But what stood out wasn’t their shape.

It was the *precision.*

The spacing between each step was identical. Dead straight, like it walked along a chalk line.

Nothing in the woods moved like that.

No bird. No dog. No deer.

I bent low, pressing my hand into the center of one.

The soil was compacted hard, nearly two inches deep.

Whatever it was—it was heavy.

Too heavy to fly.

*“Could be a boar?”* Jack said.

*“No.”* Jack never was the sharpest tool in the shed

He nodded slowly. *“I didn’t think so.”*

••

I spent the rest of the day going through old field guides. Dinosaur textbooks from university. I wasn’t looking for confirmation. I was looking for *impossibility.*

But there it was.

A raptor.

Not like in the films—these were leaner, more avian. Quill-feathered. Sickled claws. Built to strike.

Impossible.

But so was Baxter.

••

That night I couldn’t sleep.

I kept the curtains closed, rifle by the door.

Around midnight, I heard it.

A low **huff**, like steam venting through a valve. Then a **chirp**—not a bird’s warble, but three short, flutelike notes. High. Medium. Medium.

Then silence.

I waited.

Nothing.

••

The second call came the next evening.

*“It’s back,”* Jack said.

By the time I got there, the sun had vanished behind the trees, bleeding a rust-red haze across the fields.

Jack met me in the lane. He was pale, shaking.

*“It’s in the barn.”*

We approached slow. The main doors were ajar, one hinge twisted, the frame clawed.

Inside, it stank of meat.

And something else.

Warm earth. Piss. Sweat.

Predator.

Jack clicked on his flashlight.

The beam passed over hay, a broken pitchfork—

And then, it froze.

The thing was crouched over a sheep, chest torn open, head buried in the cavity.

It lifted its head.

Bright green and blue feathers slick with blood lined its back, bristling like wet pine needles. Its body was compact but powerful—every muscle coiled for motion.

And then it *turned.*

Not its body—just its head.

It rotated smoothly, mechanically, eyes swiveling toward the light.

A gyroscopic pivot, like a mounted camera.

That eye was vertical and narrow, ringed in burnt orange. It didn’t blink.

Just locked.

Watching.

A sharp *huff* burst from its throat.

Then a sequence of chirps—short, medium-pitched, patterned like a code.

I froze.

From the woods, I heard an answering chirp.

Jack cursed under his breath.

I raised the rifle.

Fired.

The crack echoed through the rafters.

The creature shrieked, leapt sideways—faster than I thought possible. Its feet scraped along the boards, talons gouging the wall.

It didn’t retreat.

It maneuvered.

Turned.

Tracked.

Its body dipped low again—one back leg shifting for leverage, forearms curled in like a bird of prey preparing to strike.

I fired again.

Missed.

It vanished into the shadows.

••

We didn’t sleep.

We waited in Jack’s kitchen, lights off. The field was silent.

Then, sometime past two, we heard it again.

***Huff. Chirp. Chirp. Chirp.***

Outside.

Close.

We held our breath.

A shadow passed the window.

Low to the ground. Fast.

But it didn’t test the house.

It circled.

We counted two. Maybe three.

••

At dawn, they were gone.

Jack looked like hell.

I went home, numb.

I told myself maybe they were gone. Maybe it was a one-off.

I slept for two hours.

Then I drove back to Jack’s.

His front door was open.

Chickens loose.

The coop was torn apart.

Blood on the steps.

No sign of Jack.

Only tracks.

In the mud.

Circling the house.

Again.

••

I don’t know what these things are.

But they aren’t confused.

They aren’t lost.

They’re hunting.

And they’re watching.

••

I’ve boarded my doors. Moved everything down to the cellar.

If anyone hears this—listen to me.

Stay out of the woods.

Stay near light.

They move with purpose.

And they remember.

I’ll keep updating.

While I still can.
