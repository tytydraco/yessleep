I think it all started back on June 20th 2024 at around 12:30 AM when I got out of bed, used the bathroom, washed my face and went into the living room. Before I went into my new hell, I saw my dad outside through the kitchen window fixing his truck. My outlet in my room was broken so I kept my phone in the living room where my dad's charger is. My mom had texted me telling me that she had gone grocery shopping. I sat on the couch and made the mistake of watching TikTok for around 20 minutes. 

After the 20 minutes though I felt a sense of dread. It was like butterflies in my stomach and since I hadn't eaten yet I got up from the couch and walked through the large doorframe that separates my kitchen and living room. This probably sounds weird, but I realized that I was in the middle of the living room again.

I don't do drugs. Well, I don't do them often, when my friends have weed, I'll smoke with them... but I'm definitely not addicted. I tried to exit the living room again, but it had the same result. I sat down to try and process what just happened. A minute or two later I tried to again, and back I was in the middle of the living room.

My living room connects to the front door, where there is a little space where we store our shoes and such. There are two doors between the frame, a metal one with a glass window and a plastic one that has clear plastic. I unlocked the first door and walked through but I still was in the middle of my living room. When I looked back up the front door was still closed and locked. I unlocked the door again and backed away. I looked away at the kitchen and then I felt the need to look back at the front door. It was locked and shut.

By now, I sat down to process to try and call someone. I rang my dad's phone first, but I heard his phone ring from the basement. He wouldn't hear it if he stayed outside. I wanted to call my mom but didn't want her to worry so I decided to just wait it out. Maybe my dad will come back inside and free me from whatever this fever dream is.

I have three windows in my living room across from the largest couch. Yes, I have two couches, one is smaller and directly faces the TV. I might already be losing it because I'm sitting here explaining my two couches. Anyway, I pulled open the blinds and looked outside. It was like the winter afternoon is all I can describe it. I felt like I needed to pull the blinds down and hide from whatever was out there. I peeked through the now closed blinds but there weren't people or a monster out there. 

At this point, it is 1:12 PM and I wrote this out for like 8 minutes so now it 1:20. I don't know what to do at this point. I want to experiment and try something to get out of here. I wanted to go make myself some eggs or something to kill this hunger. Actually, now that I think of it, ever since the first time I got teleported back into the middle of my living room, I haven't felt hungry or thirsty. I heard from a TikTok video that you can live 30 days without food but only 7 days without water. Now its setting in on me. What if this warping or teleporting or slit in reality or a "God's blind spot" thing is feeding and watering me to keep me in this loop. 

i'm gonna browse the internet and see what I can find about infinite loops and terrifying outsides. But before I do that I need to just try to escape a few more times. Maybe if I try really hard and concentrate it will work. I will escape. I will not live and die in here a million times. What the FUCK does that even mean?

i've used my notes app mark down how many times I've tried to pass this barier that breaks reality. 23 times. iT's 1:50 pm. I need a break. no I don't. I just want an exuse to go back on my phone. Is it my phone causing this? Doubt it. I'm gonna sound like a liar but I like playing basketball and football and being active, so i don't really like to be trapped in my living room. Now that I think of it, I only use TikTok in the background while I do other things or while I wait for something short. I never realy sit down and scroll through TikTok. 

Rereading the above paragraph. Autocorrect is telling me a bunch of mistakes but I didn't notice them while typing. I don't even feel like lifting my finger to correct my spelling and grammar because its just a better documentation of my mental state. Anyway, I'm gonna try and leave from front door a few times. Maybe that will have an impact.

15 times it failed. 2:24 PM. Time to try the windows. 

4 times. I'm writing here because it didn't fucking work. I would stop writing all this shit if it did right? Or would I not even notice that I escaped anymore? I don't know. I've never stayed in a room like this while I have other shit to do like shower and enjoy my summer.

Browsing through Youtube and TikTok trying to find some stuff on infinite loops. All I really find is some smart documentaries and crazy people. Maybe this curse only lasts a day. Maybe I can burn through it while on my phone or sleeping. It's only 4:43 so I won't go to sleep yet.

It started as watching some normal Youtube stuff. Stuff about Invincible, the show and stuff about Hitman 3. Then I started by watching some different stuff like educational and video essays. Then I watched some stuff about Trump and Biden. Now I just clicked off a 6 hour Nevada city council hearing. I watched 2 hours of it already. it's 11:39 so I'm just about ready to go to bed or maybe this torture will end now.

12:00 am. Still here. I tried the doorframe, the front door and the windows. Still here.

How the fuck did I never notice this? I found another Reddit post about my situation, although it's in a bathroom and it's only been 30 minutes for him. The thing is his phone died in the end. At least I have my charger, and at least I'm in the living room. Here [the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7fmbdm/ive_been_trying_to_leave_my_bathroom_for_the_past/) but now I fear his fate.

I threw a couch pillow past the large doorframe. It stayed! I looked back and forth and it stayed. I jumped onto it, and I was back in the middle of my living room. I regretted doing that. I don't know why. The pillow wasn't put back in its place or still there, it had just disappeared. I felt like I just shot a bear that woke up starving. I did the same with a few more pillows, and then I used some tissues and a tissue box. They are all gone. Now I had a pillowless and uncomfortable couch. Why did I do that?

I just killed myself. No seriously, it's been 6 days since I last typed in this thing, and I made a grave mistake. First I started by yelling and bashing my head against the wall. There was a small hole with blood gushing through all of it. I then grabbed my phone and tried to jam it into my head or something. I must have struck a nerve or destroyed my brain because then I was in the middle of the living room. Blood stain on wall, and worse of all. Broke phone.

OH FUCK NO NO NO NO my phone wont fucking charge its over it gone after this ill lose contact with the world like the other guy did and ill just suffer her eternally. im fully powering this thing off and keeping it like that until i need it again or until i escape. i just hope my parents dont worry about me missing for a week.
