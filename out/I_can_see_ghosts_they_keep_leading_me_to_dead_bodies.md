**I can see ghosts.**  
But this isn’t one of those cheesy ghost stories you read online.  
This is different, and it's more sinister than I ever expected.

It started recently, right after I turned eighteen. I was finally on the edge of graduation, excited to get out of this fucking town... this miserable, suffocating place I’ve been stuck in my whole life. It's not exactly small, but it's not big either. I'd call it medium-sized, just big enough to feel anonymous, just small enough to feel trapped.

I remember the first time I saw one.

He was an older man, gentle-looking, just standing at the end of the hallway.

I’d woken up in the middle of the night to grab a snack. When I turned the corner, there he was.  
He didn’t speak. He didn’t move. He just stood there.  
Staring at me.  
I stood there in fear, not knowing what to do. I want to say I called my parents for help or reacted appropriately in any way, but I didn't. I just went back to my room and got in bed.

Sleep did not come easily that night.

I kept seeing this man everywhere I went. My house, school, outside, everywhere. No matter where I went, he was there.

The strangest part? No one else could see him. Just me.

His features were the most disturbing thing. His face was completely degloved, revealing nothing but raw flesh underneath. He had no clothes on at all, completely naked, and his expression was blank.

You see in a lot of movies and ghost stories that spirits are always clothed. For some reason, that’s not the case for me. I guess when you die, your clothes don’t ghostify with you. Just you.

This went on for two weeks before I finally couldn't take it anymore. I spoke to him.

"Who the hell are you, and why do you keep following me?" I said to him.

He didn’t speak. He just sat there, motionless, in the corner of my room.

I don’t know why I expected a response. But for fuck’s sake, it was one in the morning, and I just wanted to sleep without being watched.

Even with how dark it was, he strangely glowed within the shadows.

If it wasn’t the degloved face, or the fact that he was naked, or the fact that he was even there in the first place, it was that he was translucent that made it all even worse.

I finally got the courage to walk up to him. I don’t even know what my intention was. Maybe something new would happen, maybe he would go away. Regardless, I can say it took a lot of balls to even form the thought.

The moment I took a step toward him, he finally moved, for the first time.

See, when I said I saw him everywhere, I didn’t mean he physically walked as I walked. No, he *teleported*. I’d enter a new room, and he was already there. I’d turn to look in a different direction, and there he was.

One time, I was in class and saw him inside one of the ceiling vents. The vent cover had surprisingly large openings, so you could see through it pretty clearly. All I could see were his bloodshot red eyes staring right back at me.

So when he finally moved, I won’t lie, I shrieked.

Yeah, I’m a guy, but my shriek is high-pitched enough that I’m honestly surprised I didn’t wake up the whole damn house.

But he didn’t move like he was going to hurt me. Instead, he raised a hand and motioned for me to follow him as he walked.

Any rational person wouldn’t have followed. But this had been going on for a while now, and at this point, I wasn’t thinking rationally anymore.

I just wanted him to go away.

But little did I know, this was the start of something I never could have imagined.  
As if seeing ghosts wasn’t already enough for one lifetime. 

He led me to the front door of my house, and of course, when I reached it, he walked straight through.

As terrified as I was, I’ll admit... that was pretty cool to see.

I followed him outside. He led me into the front yard, stopped beneath a tree, and pointed down.

That was it. Nothing else. Just pointed.

"What do you want me to do? Dig down?" I asked, confused. I could hear the fear trembling in my voice.

He didn’t answer. He just stared at me, arm still outstretched, finger still aimed at the ground.

That’s when I noticed the shovel. It was just a few feet to the right of him, leaning against the fence.

It didn’t take a genius to figure out where this was going.

He had just led me to his dead body, buried in the front yard of the house I lived in.

At first, I thought I was crazy. Maybe even schizophrenic. But no... that wasn’t the case at all.

And I would confirm that one hundred percent very soon.

I was chosen.  
That will make sense later.

I started digging. And digging. And digging.

I was praying, hoping it was all nothing. Maybe I just wasn’t sleeping enough. Maybe this wasn’t at all what it seemed.

I know those thoughts sound stupid when I’m literally looking at a ghost, but can you blame me?  
You try seeing a fucking ghost. You’ll try to talk some sense into yourself, too.

I dug for hours. I don’t know why I committed to it for so long. Maybe I thought he’d leave me alone if I did. Maybe everything would stop.

It had rained earlier, so the dirt was softer than usual. Easier to dig.

Eventually, after what felt like several hours, I hit something. Something solid, but it wasn't a rock.

My suspicions were confirmed: a decaying, rotting corpse.

The smell hit me immediately. It was so putrid I almost fainted.

I stood there, speechless. In shock.  
I think I pissed myself.

Why the fuck was there a body in my front yard?

I ran back inside to tell my dad, but as I stepped through the door, I glanced up at the clock on the wall.

"What the...?"

No way. Only five minutes had passed.

I was *sure* I had been out there for hours. But the clock said otherwise.

I checked my phone, it displayed the same time. It was still pitch black outside.

I snapped out of the confused and anxious state I was in and started to make my way toward my parents’ room, until he stopped me.

His expression had changed.

It wasn’t blank anymore. It looked... concerned. But also dead serious.

I also noticed his eyes, they were more bloodshot than before. Veins bulging, almost glowing.

Then my phone buzzed. Not a normal buzz. Violent. Like it was shaking in my pocket.

He pointed toward it.

I pulled the phone out, expecting the home screen. Instead, it was black, with a single line of white text:

**“Don’t.”**

I looked back up. He was gone.

For the first time, he wasn’t anywhere in sight.

I decided it was best to listen.

I reburied the hole, covered the body back up, and went to bed.

After getting back to bed, time finally seemed to resume normally.

I have no idea how, but somehow... he stopped time. Or at least slowed it down.

I decided I would call the police in the morning, but I’d keep myself anonymous.

Sleep didn’t come easily, again. Honestly, I’m surprised I even managed to sleep at all, knowing there was a corpse buried just yards away from where I was lying.

Questions raced through my head.

Was my family involved in a murder? Did the killing happen before we moved in?  
Why did he stop me from telling my dad?

The body was old, but not *too* old. The skin hadn’t completely deteriorated yet.

Morning came. I called the police and stayed anonymous.

They arrived shortly after, and before long, my entire family was under investigation.

But something strange happened. The case was dropped almost exactly a week later.

Just like that.

We were told not to speak about it. No explanation. No closure. Just silence.

After everything... that was it? Are you serious?

I wanted to do more, but what else could I do?

At least there were no more ghosts.

But of course, that didn’t last.

Soon after, I saw another one.

This time, it was a younger woman, maybe mid-twenties. She followed the same routine the old man had. Silent, distant, always watching.

Only now, her face was half blown off. As if she’d taken a gunshot to the head.

And something else, something I forgot to mention earlier.  
The old man had a letter carved into his stomach. Just one letter:

**H.**

This woman had the same mark. Same carving. Same place.

Just as I’d gotten through the first ghost, now there was another.

I felt like I was going insane. I couldn't take it anymore.

I tried to ignore her, hoping she'd go away. But ignoring the first one didn’t work either.

So this time, I gave in.

I looked at her and spoke.

"I know why you're here, so let’s just get this over with. I'm tired of this. I just want to be left alone. So show me where you are."

She didn’t react at first.

But then... she started to walk.

Once again, she led me to the front door. We stepped outside together.

"No way," I thought to myself. "Another one in the front yard?"

I was wrong.

This one wasn’t in the front yard.

We walked for what felt like an hour. She led me into the forested part of town, deep into the trees where the streetlights didn’t reach.

I kept hoping there wouldn’t be another hole to dig.

Eventually, we reached an abandoned cabin, run-down, half-swallowed by the woods. She led me straight to the front door.

I could already smell it.  
The strong stench of bacteria, rotting flesh...

This time it was worse.

It took everything I had not to pass out.

I reached for the doorknob, took a breath I instantly regretted, and opened it.

And there she was.

Not her ghost.

Her.

Just like the last one, decaying, rotting, lifeless.

The body was old, but not *as* old as the old man’s. This one was more recent. A few weeks, maybe. Maybe less.

I stood there, nauseated, horrified.

"How has no one noticed this yet?"

Half of her head was missing, which confirmed how she died, just like how her ghost appeared.

But I had to check something.

I really didn’t want to. But I *had* to.

I lifted her shirt and looked at her stomach.

There it was.

**“H.”**

Carved into the flesh. Clear as day, well, as clear as it could be, considering the state of her body. The rot had blurred the edges, but the mark was there.

I called the police. They arrived shortly after.

I waited outside for them. She was gone now, at least. But I had this gut feeling that this wasn’t going to end anytime soon.

And when it *did* end... it wouldn’t end well.

When the cops showed up, I was relieved to see Officer Davis among them.

Officer Davis was the father of my best friend, Eric. I’d known him for years. I saw him as a second father figure.

I walked up to him and just broke down. I started crying.

I couldn’t hold it in anymore. I was done. This was too much.

He comforted me while the other officers went inside to handle the rest.

Eventually, I was escorted back home, where my parents were waiting.

They were smart. They started to connect the dots.

First, the body in the front yard. Now one in the forest.

And they knew.

They knew I was the one who found the first body.

They started to question me.

I felt as if I was being interrogated.

But before my parents could ask more questions, Officer Davis stepped in.

He said I had to come in for questioning, claiming it was already risky enough bringing me home in the first place. I wasn’t supposed to leave the scene yet.

They brought me in, and I told them everything. The ghosts, the bodies, everything. 

I know... probably a stupid move. But at that point, I was mentally broken. I didn’t care anymore. I just wanted it all off my chest.

After everything was said and done, they suggested I seek medical attention. Said I might be dealing with stress, delusions, and trauma.

But something felt off.

The way they handled it, just like last time, was strange. Dismissive.

They dropped the case almost immediately.

And my parents? They dropped the conversation just as fast.

All they told me was this:  
“Come to us next time you see another ghost.”

Of course, I didn’t.

I was starting to not trust my own parents. I was starting to not trust *anyone*.

I was terrified in my own home, constantly looking over my shoulder, knowing something much more sinister was going on.

I mean... why did the first ghost warn me not to tell my dad?

A few weeks later, I was taken to the doctor.

I always liked going to the doctor when I was younger. Her name was Haily. She was always kind, professional... and honestly, really pretty too. She had this calm presence about her that used to make everything feel okay.

She ran some tests on me. Then she gave me some terrifying news.

This is how it went.

“Hello Jessie, how are you doing today?” she asked.

“Good... I’m just pretty shaken up about things recently,” I replied.

“I’m sorry to hear that. If there’s anything I can do to help, please let me know. Now, since you’re officially an adult, you’re allowed to make your own medical decisions. So I’m just going to be honest with you.”

She paused.

“After reviewing everything, we found a brain tumor... and signs of schizophrenia. I’m really sorry to break the news this way.”

My stomach dropped.

She continued, “The good news is, the tumor can be removed. However, because you’re also showing symptoms of schizophrenia, that could complicate things. It may affect the procedure and the recovery. And yes, it could get expensive.”

She looked me in the eyes.

“If you permit me, I can schedule surgery to remove the tumor and minimize the risk of anything severe happening. But I need your consent. If you’d prefer to try another approach, we can talk about that. But I truly believe the surgery is the safest option.”

Hearing all of this, I didn’t know what to say. So I just agreed to the surgery.

“I’m glad to hear that, Jessie,” she said with a warm smile. “I promise you, I’ll do everything in my power to make sure this goes perfectly. Does next week sound doable?”

“Next week?” I asked, my voice rising with concern. “Doesn’t it usually take weeks, *months,* to plan something like this? Especially a surgery this serious?”

She smiled again.

“Normally, yes. That’s true. But I can make an exception.”

I felt uneasy, but after talking with my parents, I agreed.

I was scheduled for surgery one week from now.

After everything, my parents started noticing a shift in me. I was quieter, more distant. Emotionally flat.

My dad called me into their bedroom to talk.

“Hey buddy,” he said, “I know things haven’t been great lately. I talked with your mom, and... well, I know we usually don’t let people come over. But we thought it might help if Eric came by tomorrow and stayed the night. We already talked to Davis, and he agreed.”

Hearing that made me feel a little better. I smiled and agreed.

The next day came, and Eric showed up. We did the same handshake we made up as kids and headed to my room.

Once we were alone, I filled him in on everything.

“What the hell, man? Ghosts, dead bodies, brain conditions? How the hell have the police kept all this so secret?” he asked, wide-eyed. “Have you told anyone else?”

“No,” I said. “Remember? They told me not to tell anyone, and honestly, I don’t want to argue with the police.”

“Fair point. But still... you haven’t told *anyone*? I don’t know if I could keep that in.”

He paused for a second, then smiled awkwardly.

“Also, sorry about the brain thing. I mean, I always knew you had issues up there, but I didn’t think it was *this* serious,” he joked.

“Shut up, man,” I laughed, shoving his shoulder.

“When do you think you’ll see the next ghost?” he asked.

Right before I could answer... I saw her.

Another one.

Staring at me through the window.

A little girl. Her throat was slit wide open. Blood soaked her skin. She didn’t blink. Just stared.

I froze.

My skin went cold. I went completely pale.

Eric noticed something was wrong. He turned to glance behind him at the window, then looked back at me, confused.

“Do you see another one?” he asked slowly.

“Can’t you see it?” I asked, my voice shaky.

“No,” he said quietly. “I’m worried for you, man.”

“No, shut up. You don’t understand,” I snapped. “It’s the same thing every time. I see a ghost, they follow me until I approach them, then they lead me to their dead body. I can’t do this anymore.”

My voice cracked. I was more scared than angry. I felt helpless, like this would never end.

“Dude, maybe we should just-”

“*No!*” I cut him off, shouting. “Just watch. Follow me. I don’t care how long it takes. I don’t care if we’re digging a hole all night. You need to see it for yourself.”

“What do you mean dig holes?” he asked, stepping back a bit. “Dude, you’re losing it. I think Hailey was right, there’s something seriously going on with you.”

“You’re not listening!” I yelled. “If I’m just so crazy, why do I keep being led to *dead fucking bodies*?”

“Jessi-”

“No. Follow me.”

“Jes-”

“*Shut up and follow me!*” I shouted, my voice shaking with rage.

Eric finally stopped trying to reason with me and just followed.

When I stepped outside, the first thing I noticed wasn’t just that the girl’s throat was slit.

Her *body* was gone.

Just a floating head... and neck.

I knew what that meant.  
I knew what I was about to see.

I followed her, and Eric followed behind me. I’m sure he thought I was crazy, but I didn’t care anymore.

He hesitated even stepping outside. But we were both grown-ass adults, no more bedtimes. So leaving the house wasn’t really an issue... other than the fact it was getting late.

As we walked, Eric kept trying to talk me down, kept telling me we should just go back. But I wasn’t listening. I *couldn’t*.

Eventually, we were led to a sewer entrance on the edge of town.

That’s when Eric stopped dead in his tracks.

“Jessie, this is getting ridiculous,” he said. “We need to go back. No way in *hell* I’m going in there.”

“I don’t give two shits if you want to or not. Go home for all I care. But I’m telling you, there is something *here*,” I snapped.

He looked like he was about to turn around and leave.

But instead, he said something I really wish he hadn’t.

“Dude, we’re not gonna find Lily in here, le-”

He froze. Mid-sentence.

He knew he fucked up.

“What do you mean by that?” I asked slowly.

“How do you know her name?” I stepped closer. “Why was being brought to the *sewers* enough to make you mention a girl named *Lily*?”

He looked at me and gave me an uncanny smile which made me step away from him. 

"You really should turn back Eric" he said in a calm voice, too calm.

I didn’t say anything else.

Instead, I made possibly one of the stupidest decisions I’ve ever made.

I ran.

I ran into the sewers, away from him.

The tunnels were pitch-black, and I knew I could easily get lost in there. But I didn’t care. I just wanted to get away.

I followed the girl’s head, watching as it floated just far enough ahead to keep me moving.

She led me deeper and deeper into the sewer system.

And that’s when I found her.

Just the head. Nothing else.

I knew what to expect at this point. But even then, it didn’t make it any easier.

Only this time... I was more concerned about Eric.

I could hardly see. The air was thick, the tunnels stretched in every direction, and I had no sense of where I was anymore. 

But what struck me most... was that I didn’t hear Eric behind me.

I don’t think he followed me at all.

The girl was gone at this point, so I left the sewers.

Eric was gone too.

I didn’t know where he went, and honestly, I didn’t care. As long as he was gone.

I called the police again. And, like before, the same thing happened.

Officer Davis showed up. I was taken in. Then released.  
And once again, the case was dropped.

At this point, I knew I had to be a suspect on their list.

Calling the police was pointless now. All they were going to do was just drop the case. I was completely alone in this.

When I got back to the house, Eric wasn’t there. And, strangely, my parents didn’t question it at all.

In fact, they were acting like nothing had happened. Like he’d never even been there.

I can’t trust anyone anymore.

Then, the day finally came for the surgery. And I was nervous as hell.

I didn’t even know if I could trust Hailey anymore. But I had to get this tumor out of my head.

Maybe, just maybe, if it was removed, I’d finally stop seeing ghosts.  
Maybe I’d finally be left alone.

But no. I know better now.

I’m too far into this. I need to figure out what’s really going on.

I keep noticing a pattern. A clear one.

A ghost appears. They follow me. I follow them.  
They lead me to their body.

Every time, if the torso is intact, there’s an “H” carved into their stomach.

And the bodies...

The bodies keep getting *more* recent.

“Count backwards from ten,” Hailey said.

So I did.

Before I even reached five, I was out.

I usually don’t dream under anesthesia. But this time, I did.

And I wish I hadn’t.

The first thing I saw in the dream... was ghosts. Everywhere.

This wasn’t your typical dream. No. It was *lucid*.

I could move. I could think. I was fully aware I was dreaming. Everything looked like a dream, but it didn’t *feel* like one.

At first, it was third-person. I could see myself. Watch myself move. But then it shifted.

Suddenly, it was first-person. My view. My body.

But I couldn’t move.

My head turned sharply to the side, and I could *feel* it, like real pain. Everything about it was too vivid. Too real.

And then, all at once, the ghosts around me spoke.

Every single one of them.

They all spoke at the exact same time, in the same rhythm... but each in their *own voice*.

"They will come for you soon. There is no tumor. There is no schizophrenia. Lies... Lies... Lies. Don't let them catch you. Be quick. Move quick. You must hurry. Time is running out. They are already onto you. They know you know. They know you can see us. They know they will be caught soon. Not one, but multiple. Don't trust anyone. We chose you for a reason. Don't... get... caught. Don't... trust... Hailey. Don't... trust... Eric. Don't... trust... your parents. Don't... trust-".

I woke up.

"Hi there, sleepyhead," Hailey said, greeting me with a warm smile.

"The surgery went great. Before I give you the aftercare details on what to do and what not to do, I’m going to give you a little time to wake up more." She smiled again, then quietly exited the room.

After that dream, I couldn’t look at her the same way.

I always thought her smile, as warm and as comforting as it was, it always did feel a bit unsettling at times. But now? Now I couldn’t stop thinking about what the ghosts had said. What did they mean by all of that? I had so many questions, and so few answers.

All I knew was that I needed to do something. *Soon.*

They mentioned *multiple people.*  
I don’t know what that means, but I know I have to get out of this hospital.

Just as I was trying to gather my thoughts, another ghost appeared.

I almost screamed. He was inches from my face.

The same “H” was carved into his stomach, just like the others.

But this one was different.

His limbs were *too long*, stretched unnaturally. His fingers were thin and bony, way longer than they should’ve been.  
His eyes were blood-red.  
He had no fingernails.  
His arms and legs were completely hairless, unnaturally smooth, like something unfinished.

He smiled at me.

Then raised one finger to his lips.  
**Shhh.**

He waved for me to follow.

I was still weak, barely able to move, still trying to recover...  
But deep down, I knew, if I didn’t follow him, something bad would happen.

Something *worse*.

He escorted me out of the hospital. My head pounding from the surgery.

He took me down a very specific path, one that, somehow, was completely clear of people.  
No staff. No patients. No one noticed me leaving.

I followed him through town and back into the forest.  
The same forest where the woman’s body had been found.

But this time, I was led to something new.  
An old shack. Weathered, falling apart. Hidden beneath the trees.

As I stepped inside, the first thing I noticed was a hatch in the floor, leading down into complete darkness.

Before I could reach it, I suddenly felt a sharp, overwhelming pain in the back of my head.  
A crushing pressure, like my skull was being squeezed from the inside out.

And then…

Everything faded into nothing.

I woke up, tied. No... *chained* to a chair.

The room was dimly lit by a single hanging light that swayed just slightly overhead.  
A few feet in front of me sat a metal table lined with surgical tools and work equipment. Knives, pliers, scalpels. Some clean. Some not.

In the center of the room was an old operating table, stained and worn.

And standing directly in front of me... was a man in a mask.

He tilted his head slightly, watching me.

“Ah., you're awake! Gotta say, Jessie... I’m impressed,” he said, almost cheerfully. “Really, I am. Most people would’ve gone to the cops once. Maybe twice. Then they would have dropped their little investigation, but you? You just kept finding them. Body after body after body. Let me guess, the ghosts kept you going?”

He chuckled. “You’re like my own little bloodhound.”

I didn’t speak. My throat was dry.

“Calling the police every time... that really was helpful,” he said, walking slowly around the chair. “Especially that first time. Going anonymous, smart move.”

He leaned close.

“But c’mon... did you really think they weren’t gonna figure out who kept making the calls?”

My voice cracked. “Who are you?”

He stopped pacing.

“Who am I...?” he repeated, like he was tasting the words.

Then he laughed, light, casual, almost pleasant.

“Sometimes, Jessie... it’s better not to ask questions you don’t want the answers to.”

Then his tone dropped. Cold. Flat.

“But... since you’ve come this far.”

He slowly reached up and pulled off the mask.

My heart dropped into my stomach.

“Da-... Davis?”

“Why... why would you do this?” I asked, my voice shaking, betrayed, scared, and heartbroken all at once.

Davis smiled. Not kindly.

“It’s cute you think *I* did it all,” he said, tilting his head. “But no. I had help. A lot of help.”

He paused.

“Or maybe I should say, I was *helping*.”

He stepped back and began slowly circling the room, almost like he was giving a presentation.

“You ever hear of the Hellen family?” he asked. “Course you have. Part of this town’s history. You probably assumed the name faded away, but let me tell you something... the name’s not what matters. The *bloodline* is.”

His smile widened.

“We own almost everything in this town. And what we don’t own? We control.”

He stopped in front of me again.

“Me. Eric. We’re part of the Hellen family. Descendants, you could say. We changed the last names a long time ago, makes it harder to track who’s who. But that’s the point. You never *really* know who’s one of us.”

He leaned closer.

“And we are a very, very dangerous family.”

I sat frozen. Chained. Helpless.

“All those murders, those little tragic accidents that hit the town every few months? Controlled. Managed. Cleaned up.”

He gave a soft, almost fond laugh.

“You think Hailey became a doctor because she had some childhood dream of saving lives?” he asked, grinning. “No, Jessie. She was born with a role. Bred into it. Her job isn’t to save anyone. Her job is to make sure things go *exactly* the way we want.”

He started pacing again, gesturing casually to the room.

“Car crashes. Slips down the stairs. Heart attacks. Fistfights that just go a little too far.  
Every one of them. *Staged.*  
Oh, the people died, don’t get that twisted. But the *how*? That’s what we make look natural. That’s our art.”

His voice darkened.

“You see, everyone who matters in this town... doctors, cops, lawyers, construction workers, even judges... at least *some* of them are part of the Hellen family. Sometimes one. Sometimes ten.”

Then he smiled again, cold and smug.

“Even the kids at your school. Even the criminals you think were locked away. Even that nice old neighbor you wave to... or the guy you see on the same corner every morning. All of them.”

He stepped closer again, eyes locked on mine.

“This town is ours. Always has been.  
And you, Jessie... you just started poking around in all the wrong places." He paused for a moment.

“And yes... all those bodies you found?” Davis continued, pacing slowly. “Died in all sorts of ways. Murders. Accidents. Illnesses. Fires. Whatever you can think of.”

He gave a casual shrug.

“All for a reason. Every one of them was deemed an obstacle. Someone in the way of something important.”

He stopped, turning toward me with a grin.

“I’m sure you remember the little girl. Ah, yes, *Lily*.”

My stomach twisted.

“She seemed harmless, didn’t she? But she wasn’t. She saw something she wasn’t supposed to see. And then... oops,” he mocked, slicing the air with his finger, “she accidentally slit her own throat. What a tragedy.”

He snorted.

“Of course, it went further than that. Had to make arrangements. Cover tracks. Clean up the mess. But then **Eric,** he just couldn’t follow simple instructions. Letting her name slip like that? Tsk. That wasn’t part of the plan.”  
He tilted his head slightly, smiling faintly. “We handled it. No need to concern yourself with him anymore.”

My stomach twisted. “What did you do with him?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He stopped pacing. The smile dropped. Silence.

“You ask too many questions,” he said coldly. “Let me help you, **he's not your problem anymore.**”

I swallowed hard. “None of this makes sense, my parents, the ghosts, Eric, you... and what about those ‘H’ symbols carved into the bodies?”

He leaned in slightly, lowering his voice like he was telling a secret.

“The ‘H’ symbols, those are ours. A way to mark the ones we handled. A way to track who died for the cause... and who didn’t.”

He smiled, almost proudly.

“It was flawless. Controlled. Untouchable.”

Davis's tone shifted again, darker.

“Even your dad was involved. He’s not part of the family, no blood ties. But the money? That helped get him on board real quick.”

I couldn’t breathe.

“And your mom?” he continued. “Sweet, sweet woman. Almost had to get rid of her. She got brave for a minute, started asking questions... but she finally grew a brain. Understood what would happen if she said a word.”

He paused. Then smiled again.

“We would've ended her. And her whole family.”

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t even cry.

“You almost died, Jessie,” he said, laughing quietly. “But your mom? She’s smarter than that.”

His eyes narrowed.

“I should’ve killed you the moment you found the first body.  
But I didn’t.  
For some reason... I didn’t.”

He stared at me in silence for a moment.

“Maybe watching you grow up made me hesitate. I really did consider you one of my own. I still do.”

Then his grin widened, twisted and proud.

“And I’m *glad* I didn’t kill you.  
You’re different.

Somehow... you can see them. The ghosts. The victims. At least a few of them. That’s not something we planned for, but we can use it.”

He began pacing again, hands behind his back.

“The original plan was simple: diagnose you with schizophrenia and a brain tumor. Stage a surgery. Claim you died on the table due to ‘complications.’ Clean. Believable.”

He chuckled.

“It would’ve explained everything, why you were ‘seeing things,’ what you told the others, if you did tell others of course. All of it.  
Nice, tidy little cover story.”

He leaned against the operating table now.

“But things changed. You kept seeing more. Finding more. So we had to adapt.”

He looked directly at me.

“That surgery for your so-called brain tumor? It was fake.  
All we really did... was implant a tracker inside you.”

I froze.

“I already know where the bodies are,” he said. “I just needed to know which one you’d be drawn to next.”

He stopped pacing.

Then looked at me, expression cold, focused, deadly serious.

“Knowing what you’re capable of, Jessie... we could use this to our advantage,” he said. “You could become one of us.”

He paused, watching my reaction.

“You were always a little dark. A little twisted. Even as a kid.  
Eric noticed it. Mentioned more than once how you might fit in with our... happy family.”

He smiled faintly.

“But I had to wait. Had to see if that would even be a possibility.”

He stepped closer, lowering his voice.

“You see, at least once a year, we *schedule* certain individuals to mate, carefully selected pairings. Those children? They belong to us before they’re even born. They’re assigned a role the moment they exist.”

I felt sick.

“If a child shows any signs of rebellion... they die. Simple as that.”

He tapped his temple.

“If we had let you in too early and didn’t like what we saw, we’d have killed you without hesitation. I didn’t want that. Neither did Eric. So we waited.”

Davis took a breath.

“I would’ve preferred to wait longer. But... I suppose now is long enough.”

He walked to the operating table. Ran his hand across the cold metal surface.

“So here’s what’s going to happen.”

He looked back at me.

“I want you to decide.”

His tone sharpened, clinical and emotionless now.

“Regardless of your answer, you’re going on that table.  
The reason why... is up to you.”

He gestured calmly.

“When someone enters the family, they’re given a special tracker, more advanced than the one we snuck in during your little ‘tumor’ surgery.”

He started listing the features off, like a salesman with a product he’s proud of.

“It’ll hold your ID. It can listen in and record audio. Real-time surveillance.  
It scans your brain activity constantly, so we’ll know if you’re healthy, unconscious, dead, or if someone tried to remove it.”

He smiled again.

“And yes, there’s a kill switch. Just in case one of our little members decides to go rogue.”

He stepped closer, too close.

“So, Jessie... I know this is a lot to take in.”

He leaned in.

“But a decision in the next five seconds would be nice."

I pause for a moment, but that pause was short lived as he started to count down.

"5"

"4"

"3"

"2"

"Wait!" I yelled in a panic.

"You can't possibly feed me all that information and expect me to decide right now," I snapped, voice cracking. "How the fuck do I know you're not tricking me?"

Davis smiled.

"That's the fun, Jessie," he said, grin widening.  
"You don't."

Then he laughed. A short, casual laugh. Like we were sharing a joke.

"But what other choice do you have?" he asked. "Even if you say yes... I don’t know if *I* can trust *you*. That’s why we have the kill switch."

Shit. He was right.

No matter what I chose... this could end with me dead.

"Well," he said, stepping back toward the operating table, "if you want to make things easier... we can let fate decide."

His voice dropped to a low, smooth whisper.

"So then we’ll both know what the smartest choice is."

He reached into his pocket, pulled out a coin, and held it up between two fingers.

"Pick," he said. "Heads or tails."

"Wh-" I started, but he cut me off.

"**Heads... or tails.**" he said again, firmer this time.

I knew I had no choice.

But there was a problem.

*Is the side I choose the one that means I live... or the one that means I die?*

Tails has always been my go-to. My lucky side. Every time I flip a coin, I pick tails.

So to know for sure what fate decides, *to truly not influence the outcome,* I go against instinct.

I pick the side I never pick.

I pick **heads**.

"Heads," I say quietly.

“Good choice,” he says.

He flips the coin, catches it, then turns it over onto his arm with theatrical slowness.

He lifts his hand.

“Perfect. We have a decision,” he smiles. “Let’s get you prepped for surgery.”

I don’t know what side it landed on. I don’t know what it means. But I brace myself.

He walks toward me. I see the needle.  
Then everything fades into nothing.

I wake up in my bedroom.

My head is pounding. My heart is racing.  
But I’m alive.

Whatever side I picked... it saved me.

There’s a note on the nightstand beside me.

Hello Jessie,  
Congratulations, you are now a part of the Hellen family.  
Don’t fret, your last name will remain the same.  
You have a unique role compared to the rest.  
From now on, whenever you see a ghost, report it immediately. Wait for an agent to arrive. Then lead them to wherever the ghost leads you.  
You are not to share any information about your duties, the victims, or the nature of your work.  
If you ever stop seeing ghosts, please inform Officer Davis so we can assign you to a new role.

God bless you.  
\- Hellen Family Operations

As I lower the note, I freeze.

There’s someone in the room with me.  
A new ghost. Standing still in the corner.

I do what I am told and I call Davis. He informs me someone will be over short.

However, as I look at the ghost more, I realize something isn't right.

She’s familiar.

"...Eric?"
