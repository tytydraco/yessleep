I truly apologise for anyone unfortunate enough to stumble upon this post, and reading it.

I messed around with things that are best left untouched. I mocked the devil himself and now he's going to kill me.

It all started when my friend brought over that cursed board to my home.

I was fresh out of a relationship, hurting, upset. Lily wanted to cheer me up, so she brought over a ouija board, which she thought to be a silly game. I am a believer of the occult, so I really didn't want to play, I really didn't want to invite anyone or anything into my home. But she convinced me. So we did, the two of us.

I fetched a couple dollar store candles from my attic, lit them up. We turned off all the lights, placed the board on my coffee table, and began playing.

"If there are any spirits that would like to contact us, please move the planchet to yes." Lily said while moving the planchet in a circular clockwise motion on the board. Once she stopped moving it, the planchet began to move towards yes. I got the chills.

"Are you sure it's fine to play this game?" I asked her, feeling less confident each minute.

"Yes, of course, cmon, have some fun!." I noticed the planchet moving again, even though we didn't ask any question. It moved to F, then U, then N. "Fun." Lily said.

"What does that mean?" Lily asked. The planchet didn't move.

She shrugged and asked another question. "What's your name?" The planchet moved to Z, then O, and I held my breath, fearing the worst, but instead of moving back to Z, the planchet moved to E, and then stopped, I took a deep breath. Lily gave me a weird look, then asked again. "How old are you?"

The planchet moved to 1, then 9. "19." I said under my breath.

"How did you pass?" This time I asked the question, getting into it the game a little more.

The planchet didn't move. "It seems like she won't answer questions she doesn't like." Lily said, and then spoke to the board. "Did you live in this house?" The planchet moved to yes.

"When?" I asked. It moved to 1, then 9, then 7, then 2. "1972." Lily said thoughtfully.

We continued on asking generic questions and getting generic answers, when we asked things more personal, things about her death, she'd not answer. Eventually we decided it was time to end the game and said goodbye.

After Lily left I was still left curious on the previous residents of my house. So I googled it, I googled about my house, about Zoe, about 1972, but my county was large, and many things happened in 1972, so it was almost impossible to narrow it down. I also couldn't find anyone by the name of Zoe. I know spirits lie, so I assumed whoever we communicated with did so too.

Lily came over again the next day, and offered to continue the game, as reluctant as I was, I obliged and we set everything up again. We got into contact with Zoe again, this time however the whole thing seemed off. I was getting chills all over and felt really uneasy. I kept hearing creaks and various other house noises. At one point I even heard a loud bang, but Lily claimed she didn't.

After we ran out of generic questions, we began asking about random things, like at one point Lily asked if Zoe can see or predict the future, to which Zoe responded with yes.

"Can you tell me then if I failed my math exam last week?" She asked all giggly, excited about this new revalation. The planchet moved to yes. "Okay, did I fail my math exam?" Lily asked. The planchet moved to no, and Lily cheered, taking her hands off the planchet, my heart dropped. "Lily!" I screamed at her. "Oops, please forgive me zoe." Lily quickly put her hands back on.

"Can you tell us the next lottery winning numbers to?" Lily asked, still giddy with excitement, I however only felt worry. Something wasn't right. The candles were going crazy. The planchet moved to yes, but then began spelling out something. I W O N T T E L L Y O U, It finally finished spelling out after a long moment. Lily looked disappointed, but then asked something horrifying. "When will I die?" "Lily!" I warned her, but it was too late, the planchet began moving. It first moved to T, Then O, then M, it kept spelling until it finally finished the word. Tomorrow. The candles went crazy as the planchet stopped moving and went out. "Goodbye Zoe." I said completely terrified, and forcefully moved the planchet through goodbye and took my hands off, relighting the candles.

"What the fuck Lily?" I asked her, I was furious.

"Oh calm down, of course I won't die tomorrow." She said. "Come on lets continue the game." Her voice sounded just a little bit off. She put her hands back on and invited the spirits again. Something answered. "What's your name?" Lily asked. I didn't have my hands on, she was playing alone. "Lily! Stop!" I shouted. The planchet moved to Z, then O. Then it repeated the sequence. I gasped. "Say goodbye!" I pleaded, Lily began giggling, the planchet kept moving back and forth between Z and O.

Then it stopped, Lily looked at me, her eyes were watery, and she spoke in a voice that didn't sound like her's. "When will August die?" I watched in horror as the planchet moved to numbers. 01, 01, 2023. then it moved to the letters and spelled out eve.

Lily giggled once more and passed out on the spot. "Lily!" I screamed as I went to her side and tried to wake her, it didn't take long and she did wake up. She couldn't remember anything after she apologised for taking her hands off the planchet. I sent her home and warned her to never bring this accursed board back into my house. She kept asking what happened, but I said nothing.

I got a call a day later that Lily's overpacked bus turned over as she was coming back from work, and she died. Just like the demon predicted.

I'm going to die in under 48 hours. I don't know what to do, or how to prevent it. I'm tempted to play the game again and beg for mercy. The demon we contacted is the strongest of them all. If only I never agreed to play that stupid [game.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Coureherritt)
