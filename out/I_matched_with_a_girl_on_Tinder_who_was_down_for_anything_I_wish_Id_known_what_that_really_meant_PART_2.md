Six months. It's been six long, sleepless months since [my encounter with Lily](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1egmrq0/i_matched_with_a_girl_on_tinder_who_was_down_for/), the Tinder match that nearly cost me my sanity. I've tried everything to move on - therapy, meditation, even a brief stint with antidepressants. But nothing seems to shake the feeling that I'm being watched, that something is lurking just beyond the edge of my vision.

Every night, I relive that terrifying experience in my dreams. I see Lily's face morphing into something inhuman, feel the cold touch of her fingers on my skin, hear the skittering of unseen creatures in the darkness. I wake up drenched in sweat, my heart pounding so hard I'm afraid it might burst out of my chest.

During the day, I go through the motions of normal life. I still work at the marketing firm, but my designs have taken on a darker edge. My boss, Dave, has noticed the change.

"Jake," he said to me last week, concern etched on his face, "Is everything alright? Your work is... different lately."

I forced a smile, the same one I've been wearing like a mask for months. "Just trying out a new style, Dave. Pushing the boundaries a bit."

He didn't look convinced, but he let it go. That's been the pattern lately - people noticing something's off, but not pushing too hard. It's like they're afraid of what they might uncover if they dig too deep.

But I knew I couldn't keep living like this. The weight of carrying this secret was becoming unbearable. I needed to tell someone, anyone, just to prove to myself that I wasn't going crazy. That's when I decided to confide in my best friend, Michael.

Michael and I have been friends since college. He's the outgoing, life-of-the-party type - the kind of guy who always has a new story about some wild night out or a crazy Tinder hookup. We're opposites in many ways, but somehow, our friendship works. Or at least, it used to.

We agreed to meet at our usual spot, The Rusty Nail. It's a dive bar on the edge of town, the kind of place where the beer is cheap and the lighting is dim enough to hide a multitude of sins. As I walked in, the familiar smell of stale beer and cigarette smoke hit me, and for a moment, I felt almost normal.

Michael was already there, nursing a beer at our usual table in the corner. He looked up as I approached, a grin spreading across his face.

"Jake, my man!" he exclaimed, standing up to give me a bear hug. "Long time no see. Where've you been hiding?"

I forced a laugh as I sat down, signaling the waitress for a beer. "You know, same old. Work's been crazy."

Michael raised an eyebrow. "For six months? Come on, dude. You've been ghosting me. What's really going on?"

I took a long swig of my beer, trying to gather my courage. "Michael, I need to tell you something. Something... crazy."

He leaned forward, his eyes sparkling with interest. "Now we're talking. Lay it on me, bro."

I took a deep breath and launched into my story. I told him everything - about matching with Lily on Tinder, our strange date, waking up in that box, the twisted reality she showed me. As I spoke, I could see the concern in Michael's eyes slowly morphing into disbelief, then amusement.

When I finally finished, there was a long, uncomfortable silence. Then Michael burst out laughing.

"Holy shit, Jake," he wheezed, wiping tears from his eyes. "That's some trippy stuff. What were you smoking? And more importantly, why didn't you share?"

I felt my face flush with anger and embarrassment. "I'm serious, Michael. This really happened."

He shook his head, still chuckling. "Come on, man. Shape-shifting Tinder demons? Alternate realities? You've been watching too many horror movies."

"I know how it sounds, but-"

"No, I get it," Michael cut me off, his tone softening. "Dating can be scary, especially after being out of the game for a while. But don't you think you're overreacting a bit? Maybe projecting some fears or something?"

I opened my mouth to argue, but the words died in my throat. What was I expecting? Of course he didn't believe me. I wouldn't believe me either if I hadn't lived through it.

"Yeah," I muttered, deflated. "Maybe you're right."

Michael clapped me on the shoulder. "Look, I think you just need to get back out there. Face your fears, you know? In fact..."

He pulled out his phone, a mischievous grin spreading across his face. "I just matched with this smoking hot chick. Says she's DTF. Why don't you come wingman for me? It'll be like old times."

I felt a chill run down my spine. "I don't think that's a good idea, Michael."

But he was already swiping through the girl's photos, his eyes gleaming with anticipation. "Oh come on, live a little! What's the worst that could happen?"

As I looked at his excited face, I realized with a sinking feeling that nothing I could say would change his mind. And maybe, just maybe, if I went along with it, I could keep an eye on things. Make sure history didn't repeat itself.

"Alright," I said, trying to ignore the knot of dread in my stomach. "I'm in."

Michael whooped, raising his beer in a toast. "That's my boy! Trust me, Jake. This is gonna be epic."

Little did I know, I was about to be dragged back into a nightmare I thought I'd escaped.

The next few days passed in a fast forward. Michael kept texting me updates about his upcoming date, each message making my stomach churn.

"Dude, she's so freaky. Says she's into some wild stuff."

"Check out this pic she sent. Is that even legal?"

"We're meeting at The Black Cat tomorrow night. You in?"

I tried to talk him out of it, to make him see reason. But Michael was like a dog with a bone. The more I protested, the more excited he seemed to get.

"Jake, buddy, you need to chill," he said when I called him for the third time in one day. "I get that you had a bad experience, but not every girl on Tinder is a psycho killer, you know?"

I wanted to scream, to shake him until he understood the danger he was in. But I knew that would only push him away. So I did the only thing I could think of - I agreed to go with him.

"Fine," I said, trying to keep the tremor out of my voice. "I'll come. But promise me you'll be careful, okay?"

Michael laughed. "Yes, mom. I promise I'll use protection and everything."

The night of the date arrived, and I was a nervous wreck. I must have changed my outfit a dozen times, as if what I wore would somehow protect me from whatever horrors might be waiting. In the end, I settled on a simple black t-shirt and jeans. Easy to move in, if it came to that.

I met Michael outside The Black Cat, a trendy bar downtown that was always packed on weekends. The bass-heavy music pulsed through the air, and I could feel it in my chest as we approached the entrance. Michael was dressed to impress, his hair carefully styled and a confident grin on his face.

"There's my wingman!" he said, pulling me into a bear hug. "Ready to watch the master at work?"

I forced a smile. "Yeah, can't wait. So, where is this girl?"

Michael checked his phone. "She should be here any minute. Said her name's Lily. Isn't that cute?"

I felt like I'd been punched in the gut. Lily. It couldn't be. It had to be a coincidence, right?

Before I could say anything, Michael's face lit up. He waved at someone over my shoulder. "There she is! Damn, even hotter in person."

I turned around, my heart pounding in my chest. And there she was.

Lily.

She looked exactly the same as the night I met her at The Rusty Nail. Long dark hair, captivating green eyes, and a smile that seemed to hide secrets. But there was no flash of recognition in her eyes, no hint that she knew me.

"Michael?" she said, her voice like honey. "Is this your friend you mentioned?"

Michael nodded, oblivious to the tension crackling between us. "Yeah, this is Jake. Jake, meet Lily."

She extended her hand, and I flinched involuntarily. "Nice to meet you, Jake," she purred.

I stared at her hand, unable to move. Michael elbowed me in the ribs. "Dude, don't be rude."

Swallowing hard, I reached out and shook her hand. Her grip was firm and warm - nothing like the icy touch I remembered.

"Nice to meet you too," I managed to choke out.

Lily's smile widened, and for a split second, I thought I saw something flicker behind her eyes. But then it was gone, and she was just a beautiful woman on a date.

"Shall we head inside?" she suggested. "I hear they make killer cocktails here."

Michael grinned, offering her his arm. "Lead the way, beautiful."

As we entered the bar, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was missing something. But maybe, just maybe, I had been wrong about her. Maybe this Lily was just a normal woman, and my traumatized brain was playing tricks on me.

The Black Cat was packed, the air thick with the smell of alcohol and the sound of pulsing music. We managed to snag a small table in the corner, Michael and Lily sitting close together while I perched awkwardly on the edge of my seat, ready to bolt at a moment's notice.

As Michael and Lily chatted and flirted, I couldn't take my eyes off her. Every movement, every gesture seemed normal, human. She laughed at Michael's jokes, touched his arm flirtatiously, and sipped her cocktail with obvious enjoyment.

"So, Jake," Lily said, turning those green eyes on me. "Michael tells me you're a graphic designer. That must be fascinating work."

I nodded, trying to keep my voice steady. "Yeah, it's... it's pretty interesting. Lots of variety."

"I've always been fascinated by art," Lily said, leaning forward. "The way it can capture emotion, tell a story... or even reveal hidden truths."

There was something about the way she said 'hidden truths' that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. But before I could dwell on it, Michael jumped in.

"Hey, speaking of hidden truths," he said with a wink, "how about we play a little game? Two truths and a lie. Lily, you start."

Lily's eyes sparkled with amusement. "Alright, I'm game. Let's see... One: I once swam with great white sharks. Two: I can speak five languages. Three: I've never been outside the country."

Michael rubbed his chin, pretending to think hard. "Hmm... I'm gonna say the lie is... you've never been outside the country. No way a worldly woman like you hasn't traveled."

Lily clapped her hands, laughing. "Very good! You're right, I've actually been to twelve different countries."

"Impressive," Michael said, clearly smitten. "Alright, Jake, your turn."

I froze, my mind racing. How could I play this game when my entire life felt like a lie?

"Uh... okay. One: I've never broken a bone. Two: I once met the President. Three: I... I had a near-death experience six months ago."

The words were out of my mouth before I could stop them. Michael rolled his eyes, but Lily... Lily's gaze sharpened, her eyes boring into mine with an intensity that made me want to squirm.

"Interesting choices, Jake," she said softly. "I'm going to say... the lie is that you've never broken a bone."

I felt the blood drain from my face. How could she know?

"That's... that's right," I stammered. "How did you..."

Lily shrugged, a mysterious smile playing on her lips. "Just a lucky guess. You seem like the type to have had a few... accidents."

The way she said 'accidents' sent a shiver down my spine. I opened my mouth to say something, anything, but Michael cut in.

"Alright, my turn!" he exclaimed, oblivious to the tension. "Let's see..."

As Michael launched into his truths and lie, I excused myself to go to the bathroom. I needed a moment to collect myself, to shake off the paranoia that was threatening to overwhelm me.

In the grimy bathroom mirror, I stared at my reflection. I looked pale, almost sickly, with dark circles under my eyes. Was I really just imagining things? Projecting my trauma onto an innocent woman?

I splashed some cold water on my face, trying to pull myself together. When I returned to the table, Michael and Lily were even closer, their heads bent together as they laughed at some shared joke.

"Everything okay, Jake?" Lily asked, her voice laced with concern that sounded almost genuine. "You look a bit pale."

I forced a smile. "Yeah, just... just needed some air. It's pretty stuffy in here."

Michael nodded sympathetically. "Yeah, it is getting pretty crowded. Hey, Lily and I were thinking of heading out, maybe grab a bite to eat. You wanna join?"

I looked at Lily, searching for any sign of the monster I thought I knew. But all I saw was a beautiful woman looking at me with mild curiosity.

"Nah, you two have fun," I said, ignoring the voice in my head screaming at me to stay with them. "I'm beat. Think I'll head home."

Michael grinned, clapping me on the shoulder. "Your loss, man. I'll text you tomorrow."

As I watched them leave, Lily's arm linked with Michael's, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was making a terrible mistake. But what could I do? I had no proof, no reason to believe this Lily was anything other than what she seemed.

I left the bar shortly after, the cool night air doing little to calm my racing thoughts. As I walked to my car, I kept glancing over my shoulder, half-expecting to see Lily's glowing green eyes watching me from the shadows.

But there was nothing. Just the normal sounds and sights of a city night.

Maybe I really had imagined the whole thing. Maybe the trauma of my experience had twisted my perception, made me see monsters where there were none.

As I drove home, I tried to convince myself that everything was fine. That Michael was safe, that Lily was just a normal woman, that I was finally starting to heal.

Little did I know, the real nightmare was just beginning.

The week following Michael's date with Lily passed in a haze of forced normalcy. I threw myself into my work, staying late at the office and taking on extra freelance projects. Anything to keep my mind occupied, to push away the nagging fear that something wasn't right.

Michael, for his part, seemed happier than I'd seen him in years. He was constantly texting, a goofy grin plastered on his face whenever his phone buzzed. When we met for our usual Friday night beers, he couldn't stop talking about Lily.

"Dude, she's amazing," he gushed, his eyes shining with excitement. "Smart, funny, adventurous... and don't even get me started on how she is in bed."

I forced a smile, ignoring the knot in my stomach. "That's great, man. I'm happy for you."

"You know," Michael said, leaning in conspiratorially, "she's got this friend. Maybe we could double date sometime?"

The thought made me break out in a cold sweat. "Uh, maybe. We'll see."

Michael didn't push it, too caught up in his own excitement to notice my discomfort. As the night wore on, I found myself relaxing a bit. Maybe I really had been wrong about Lily. Maybe my traumatic experience had just made me paranoid.

It was a quiet Tuesday evening when everything changed. I was at home, half-heartedly scrolling through Netflix, when my phone buzzed with a text from Michael. It was a selfie of him and Lily, both smiling widely. The background showed an elegantly decorated living room I didn't recognize.

Michael: At Lily's place. This girl is unreal, man. I think she might be the one.

I felt a chill run down my spine. Something about the image seemed... off. The shadows in the room looked too deep, too alive. And Lily's eyes... in the dim lighting of the photo, they seemed to glow an unnatural green.

I tried to shake off the feeling, telling myself I was being paranoid. But as the hours ticked by and Michael didn't respond to my messages, the unease grew into full-blown panic.

Around midnight, I couldn't take it anymore. I had to make sure Michael was okay. I dug through our old conversations until I found the address Lily had sent him for their date.

The house was in an upscale neighborhood on the outskirts of town, set back from the road and surrounded by old-growth trees. As I pulled up, I noticed all the lights were off except for a faint glow coming from a basement window.

I approached the front door, my heart pounding. Should I knock? Call out? As I stood there, paralyzed with indecision, I heard a muffled scream from inside the house.

Michael.

Without thinking, I grabbed the doorknob. To my surprise, it turned easily. I stepped into the darkened house, the floorboards creaking under my feet.

"Michael?" I called out, my voice sounding small in the oppressive silence.

Another scream, definitely coming from below. I found the basement door and descended the stairs, each step feeling like it might be my last.

The scene that greeted me in the basement would haunt me for the rest of my life.

The basement was dimly lit by flickering candles, casting grotesque shadows on the walls. In the center of the room, Michael was strapped to a chair, his eyes wide with terror. Blood trickled from a gash on his forehead, and his shirt was torn, revealing angry red marks across his chest.

And there, looming over him, was Lily.

But this wasn't the Lily from the bar. This creature was a writhing mass of shadows, vaguely human-shaped, with those same piercing green eyes glowing in the darkness. Tendrils of inky blackness curled around Michael's body, pulsing with an otherworldly light.

"Jake," Michael whimpered when he saw me. "Help me. Please."

The shadow-Lily turned to face me, her form rippling like smoke. "Well, well. Look who's come to join the party." Her voice was a cacophony of whispers, echoing in my head.

I stumbled backward, my hand frantically searching my pockets for anything I could use as a weapon. My fingers closed around my phone.

The flashlight. It had worked before.

I whipped out my phone and turned on the flashlight app, aiming it at Lily. The effect was immediate. Where the light touched her shadowy form, it seemed to dissolve, wisps of darkness curling away like burning paper.

Lily screeched, an inhuman sound that made my ears ring. She retreated to the darkest corner of the room, her form solidifying into something more human-like.

"You think your little light can stop me?" she hissed, her voice a mixture of rage and amusement. "I've consumed countless souls, boy. You're nothing but a gnat to me."

I kept the light trained on her as I edged towards Michael. "What are you?" I demanded, trying to keep my voice steady. "Why are you doing this?"

Lily laughed, a sound like breaking glass. "Why? Because it's fun. Because you humans are so deliciously easy to manipulate. Your loneliness, your desperation... it's intoxicating."

As she spoke, I noticed something on a nearby table. A knife, its blade glinting in the candlelight. I lunged for it, my fingers closing around the handle just as Lily sprang forward.

In her human form, she was incredibly fast. She slammed into me, knocking us both to the ground. The knife clattered away, sliding under a heavy cabinet.

We grappled on the floor, Lily's hands clawing at my face. Her strength was inhuman, and I knew I couldn't overpower her. But then I remembered – the flashlight.

I managed to bring my phone up, shining the light directly in her face. Lily shrieked and recoiled, her form wavering between human and shadow.

I scrambled to my feet, diving for the knife. My fingers closed around the handle just as Lily recovered, lunging at me with inhuman speed.

Time seemed to slow down. I saw the madness in her eyes, the hunger. I saw Michael, still bound to the chair, his face pale with terror.

And I knew what I had to do.

As Lily reached me, I brought the knife up. There was a moment of resistance, then a sickening give as the blade sank into her chest.

Lily's eyes widened in shock. She looked down at the knife, then back at me. "How...?" she gasped.

For a moment, nothing happened. Then, like a soap bubble bursting, she exploded into a cloud of inky black smoke. The smoke swirled around the room, accompanied by an unearthly wailing, before being sucked down into the floorboards.

And then... silence.

I stood there, shaking, the bloody knife still clutched in my hand. It was over. Or at least, I thought it was.

"Jake?" Michael's weak voice snapped me out of my daze. "What... what the fuck just happened?"

I rushed over to him, using the knife to cut through his bindings. "It's okay," I said, my voice hoarse. "She's gone. You're safe now."

But as I helped Michael to his feet, I noticed something was wrong. His eyes were unfocused, and his skin was pale and clammy. He stumbled, nearly falling.

"I don't feel right," he mumbled. "Something's... something's inside me."

I caught him as he collapsed, lowering him gently to the floor. His body began to convulse, and a thin trickle of black liquid seeped from the corner of his mouth.

"No, no, no," I muttered, cradling his head. "Michael, stay with me. Stay with me!"

But I could see the light fading from his eyes. Whatever Lily had done to him, whatever part of her had lingered... it was killing him from the inside out.

Michael's body gave one final, violent shudder, and then he was still. His eyes, wide and unseeing, stared up at the ceiling. In their reflection, I could have sworn I saw a flash of familiar green.

I sat there, holding my best friend's lifeless body, as the reality of what had just happened washed over me. Lily was gone, but at what cost? And was she really gone, or had she just changed forms?

As sirens wailed in the distance, growing closer, I couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn't really over. Lily might be gone, but there was something bigger at play here. Something that had been hunting people like us for who knows how long.

And I had a feeling we had just scratched the surface of a nightmare that was far from over.

The police arrived about an hour after my confrontation with Lily. They found me in the basement, covered in blood that wasn't mine, cradling Michael's lifeless body. The room was a disaster - overturned furniture, shattered glass, and candle wax everywhere. But there was no sign of Lily, just a dark stain on the floor where she had... dissolved.

I told them a version of the truth - that Michael's date had turned out to be dangerous, that she had attacked us and I had defended myself. I left out the parts about shape-shifting monsters and alternate realities. How could I explain that the woman they were looking for had exploded into a cloud of black smoke?

They didn't believe me, of course. How could they? But as they searched the house, they found... things. Disturbing things.

There were tunnels beneath the basement, stretching for miles underground. They found bones there, hundreds of them. Human bones. And journals, detailing centuries of hunts and feedings. The oldest ones were written in languages long dead, the pages crumbling with age.

One of the detectives, a grizzled veteran named Rodriguez, pulled me aside as the forensics team combed through the evidence.

"Look, son," he said, his voice low and serious. "I've been on the force for 30 years, and I've never seen anything like this. Whatever happened here... it's bigger than you know."

I nodded, a chill running down my spine. "What's going to happen now?"

Rodriguez sighed, rubbing his temples. "Officially? This is going to be classified as a serial killer case. Your friend is a victim, and the woman - Lily - is presumed dead, though we haven't found a body. Unofficially... well, let's just say there are some things the public isn't ready to know about."

The case made national news, with headlines screaming about the "Tinder Killer" and the "House of Horrors." I was questioned extensively but eventually cleared of any wrongdoing. Self-defense, they called it. If only they knew the whole truth.

In the weeks that followed, I waited for something to happen. For Lily to return, for some other nightmare creature to emerge from the shadows. But nothing did. Lily was gone, and so was Michael. I was left alone with my grief, my guilt, and the terrifying knowledge of what really lurks in the darkness.

I deleted Tinder. In fact, I swore off dating apps altogether. Some risks just aren't worth taking.

But the nightmares haven't stopped. Sometimes, I wake up in a cold sweat, convinced I can hear that skittering sound, like insects crawling over concrete. And when I check my phone, I swear I can see a pair of familiar green eyes staring back at me from the black screen.

Detective Rodriguez calls me sometimes, late at night. He never says much, but I can hear the fear in his voice. They're finding more houses, more tunnels. More bones.

"It's spreading," he told me during our last call. "Whatever this was, it wasn't just one killer. It's... it's something else."

I've started doing my own research, digging into old myths and legends. I've found stories, whispered tales of shape-shifting creatures that feed on human loneliness and desire. They've been with us for centuries, evolving as we do, finding new ways to lure in their prey.

And now, with the rise of technology and social media, they have a whole new hunting ground.

I'm writing all of this down as a warning. To you, to anyone who might be reading this. Be careful out there. The monsters aren't just hiding under your bed anymore. They're in your phone, in your computer. They're in the apps you use every day, pretending to be the perfect match, the answer to all your lonely nights.

So if you're out there, swiping through Tinder late at night, and you match with someone who seems too good to be true... be careful. Look closely at their eyes. And if they're a particular shade of green, for the love of God, swipe left.

Because Lily might be gone, but I fear her kind is still out there. And they're always looking for their next match.

As for me? I visit Michael's grave every week. I tell him I'm sorry, that I should have done more. And I promise him that I won't let his death be in vain. I'll keep fighting, keep searching for answers. Because someone has to shine a light on the monsters hiding in the shadows of our digital world.

And if that someone has to be me... well, at least I know what I'm up against now.

So here's to the fight ahead. And to all of you out there in the dark, swiping and hoping for a connection.

Be careful. Be vigilant. And remember - not every match is a good one.

Some of them might just be [deadly](https://www.reddit.com/user/prodshebi/comments/1e5c94y/welcome_to_my_horror_story_universe/).
