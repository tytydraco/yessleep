“What is wrong with you?”  
  
“What’s wrong with me? What’s wrong with you?”  
  
“Says the man who can’t go a whole hour without a fix. God, you’re so selfish. I never should’ve started dating you in the first place. My friends were right.”  
  
“That’s not fair. Ally, my mom died. My fucking mom. Do you even care? Of course not. You never have and you never will.”  
  
“Teddy, it’s been two years. Two entire years. You’re an addict. A worthless fucking addict. You’re just like my dad.”  
  
“Oh yeah? How? Because I like to smoke a joint every once in a while? Last time I recalled, I’ve never hit you. I haven’t laid one finger on you in the three years we’ve been together.”  
  
“You didn’t have to, Ted. When’s the last time you took me on a date? Bought me flowers? Told me you love me? Don’t lie, you can’t even remember.”  
  
“Ally, you don’t give me a chance to do those things. How can I love someone who’s fucking drunk all the time?”  
  
Tears welled in her eyes and her bottom lip began to quiver.  
  
“Baby, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”  
  
A single tear trickled down her cheek.   
  
“Fuck you, Ted.”   
  
“Ally, wait I-”   
  
Slam.  
  
That was the last conversation we ever had. Ally died in a car crash that night. She was on the way to her mother’s house when she collided with a telephone pole going over sixty miles per hour. The car was obliterated on impact. She never stood a chance.  
  
The toxicology report came back over a month later. She’d been driving drunk, more than three times the legal limit. I never should have let her walk out that door. I should have taken her keys. I should have called someone. I should have told her that I loved her. That was all she really wanted. To be loved. And I couldn’t even manage to do that. Those three simple words could have saved her life. My soulmate, my forever girl, the woman I was supposed to marry, was gone, never to return. And it was all my fault.   
  
I didn’t attend the funeral. Ally’s mother had never cared for me much, and after she found out what happened to her baby girl, she called me personally to tell me that I wasn’t invited to the service. That in itself was like a knife to the gut. I pleaded with her to let me go. Even just to stand inconspicuously in the back. But she wouldn’t budge.   
  
I nosedived into a downward spiral. Ally was all I had left. She was my everything. My dad was never in the picture, and after Mom lost her battle to cervical cancer, my girlfriend was the only one in the whole world who truly loved me. I didn’t deserve her, and I knew that. To deal with my guilt, I turned to the bottle. A nightly cocktail of weed and hard liquor subsequently devolved into something worse. First it was ecstasy. Then cocaine. And eventually, heroine. I had officially hit rock bottom.   
  
I awoke one morning with an especially empty pit in my stomach. The isolation was eating me from the inside out. I couldn’t take it anymore. This was the day. The day I was finally going to do it. I waited until nightfall, more determined than I’d been in a long time, and I drove to the bridge.   
  
I parked my car just off the road a few feet down and sat there, deliberating. Was I really going through with this? Heck, why not? I had nothing to live for. I took a long pull from a brown paper sack. A little liquid courage was all the reassurance I needed.   
  
I stumbled from the driver’s seat, slamming the door shut behind me, as I awkwardly staggered to the railing. I tossed one leg over, then the other. I gazed up at a smattering of stars twinkling like little beacons in the otherwise colorless sky. Then, I glanced down at the rushing water dozens of stories below. A light breeze nudged my back, inviting me over the ledge. There was something calming about it. It only worked to further steel my resolve. I didn’t deserve such a serene death. Not after Ally’s was anything but.   
  
Memories flooded my brain as I prepared to cross to the other side. Memories of Mom, memories from my childhood, memories of Ally. Subtle, fleeting reminders of all I’d lost. I squeezed my eyes shut, a tear rolling down my cheek. I bent my knees, summoning every ounce of strength I had. And…  
  
“Hey! What is wrong with you?”  
  
I nearly lost my footing as I whipped my head in the direction of my unwelcome spectator. A tall figure in an overcoat stood beneath a street lamp smoking a cigarette. The brim of his hat shrouded his face in shadow.   
  
“What’s wrong with me? What’s wrong with you? You’re the creep standing on a bridge watching people in the middle of the night.”  
  
My final conversation with Ally flashed through my head as a pang of guilt struck me like a sledgehammer. The stranger flicked his cigarette aside and slowly approached me.   
  
“Are you not doing the same?”   
  
I pondered it for a moment.   
  
“Well, yeah. Why do you care? Just leave me alone.”  
  
His luminescent pupils glowered at me, sending a shiver up my spine.   
  
“I will not ‘just leave you alone.’ This is my spot. If you want me gone, you’re going to have to fight me for it.”  
  
“Fine by me. I’ve got nothing to lose.”  
  
I laboriously climbed back over the rail, ready to give him a piece of my mind. I glanced up, fists balled. He was already back under the lamp post, another lit cigarette dangling from his lips.   
  
“H-hey! How’d you get over there so fast? I swear, if you make me walk that far, it’s going to be you falling face-first into that water.”   
  
The man gradually approached, sauntering up to me at a snail’s pace.   
  
“Look kid, I don’t actually want a conflict. If you want to be alone, so be it,” he said, inhaling deeply.  
  
“Then why did you say I’d have to fight you for it?”   
  
“Got you away from the edge, didn’t it?”  
  
I narrowed my eyes at him.   
  
“So let me get this straight. You just happened to be here minding your own business, you saw that I was about the jump, and you thought that threatening violence was your best option?”  
  
He shrugged.  
  
“Sounds about right.”  
  
“Fuck you, dude. Watch if you want. It doesn’t matter,” I said, turning back to the guardrail.   
  
The man’s hand suddenly clasped my shoulder.   
  
“Wait. I have a message for you. If you still want to off yourself after that, fine by me, but at least hear me out.”  
  
I crossed my arms, ready to be rid of this peculiar individual.   
  
“Fine. What do you have to tell me?”  
  
He dropped his cigarette and I watched as it tumbled through the thick wooden slats. His head lurched up to the sky, cocked back at a disturbing angle. His mouth began to stretch, muscles and tendons popping loudly as his jaw unhinged like an anaconda about to devour its prey. Fear seeped into my bones. And then, a familiar soothing voice began emanating from his contorted face.   
  
“Baby, please don’t blame yourself for what happened to me. I was broken for a long time, and it wasn’t your job to fix me. I realize now that you were the best partner I could have asked for. Even though I can’t be there in person, I will always be with you. I know you’re going to accomplish great things and I am so, so proud of you. I love you with all my heart, Teddy Bear.”  
  
Tears clouded my vision. I couldn’t prevent them from flooding down my cheeks any longer. I wailed, anguished, lamented cries echoing through the night. My heart ached. I missed her so much. All I wanted was to be able to see her, one last time. But I knew that was impossible.   
  
The man stood there, silently observing. Once I had no more tears left to cry, I wiped my cheeks and locked eyes with him.   
  
“Thank you. You don’t know how much I needed to hear that.”   
  
He nodded, producing an ancient, crumpled pack of smokes from his pocket. I stared as his lighter ignited yet another cigarette.   
  
“Can you tell her something for me?”  
  
“What did you have in mind?”  
  
“Tell her this: ‘thank you, my love. I will always cherish the time that we had together, and my heart won’t be full until we meet again. In the meantime, I’ll try every day to be the man I should’ve been when we were together. I’ll love you forever, Ally Bug.’”   
  
“Okay. The message will be delivered.”  
  
With that, he turned and began to walk away. I blinked, and when I opened my eyes, he had vanished, wisped effortlessly into the cool summer air.   
  
That night was a wake-up call for me. I stopped wallowing in my own self-pity, and I started taking my life back. I began attending therapy and AA groups to deal with my trauma and kick my bad habits. I recently found a job I love and I volunteer at a local homeless shelter on the weekends. I want to give back to the community however I can. I just hope that one day, when I see Ally again, I can say that I lived up to my promise that I made to her on the night she saved my life.
