It’s been 2 months since I saw a live person. There’s people but I don’t think there real. No matter how hard I try to get them to talk to me they just stare back at me with blank eyes and ear to ear grins. It’s driving me insane. Every where I run is another dead end,or just a circle back to where u started. And everywhere I look it’s there. It always catches me and I wake up again in what looks like my room but it’s not. I’m writing this whilst hiding in my wardrobe but it knows I’m here. I can hear it from the woods getting closer with every word I write. I’m praying the next time it gets me I wake up in my real room. 

I can hear it’s whistle from my drive now, dating me to come down to it. Am I going insane. Is this just a long nightmare or am I in a coma? I hear another crash downstairs. It’s through the door now, it’s inside. I could try to shut it out but It just keeps coming back. Im hoping the chains keep it out of this room long enough for me to find out how to escape. I’ve searched through every website there is but every time I find something it disconnects so this is my only chance. The stairs creak one after another and I know that it’s almost here. Maybe it will leave me alone this time. But I don’t think so. I miss the sun and the warm breeze every morning. The coldness is getting too much to bare,and the darkness eats me whole every time I look. I’m getting closer to just ending it,anything to escape this dream. The time is always the same. 00:42. I don’t know what’s real or not now but I suppose nothings real about this. It can hear me so there’s no point in trying to run. If someone sees this please come save me. It’s scratching at the door now. It sounds like my dad but it’s not. It can’t be. He’s still next to me but Without his eyes or mouth. The thing is here so I’ll update when if wake back up.

I’m back in the same room, and this time I’m going to try to escape. As I walked down the stairs I felt eyes all over me. The so called people was staring at me with blank expressions. One blinked. I stared at him, my hopes gradually building up. 

I decided to pretend to be one of them to get closer to him. I slowly walked closer and closer until I was right next to him. I whispered to him, “do you know what’s going on?”
He looked back at me and murmured, “No I’ve been stuck with these things for weeks”. I felt the happiest of felt in weeks,finally someone I could talk to. The people looking things all turned to us and started muttering something over and over again. I didn’t want to know what they was saying so I grabbed his hand and ran out of the house. We ran until we was sure they wasn’t following us. “My name’s Jonathan” The man said.
“Mine is Mia, do you think that thing knows where we are?” I questioned, whilst farting my eyes all over. He shrugged, and I could tell he was as scared as I was. We heard a noise in the distance, followed with a voice that was unfamiliar to me. 
“Help me” echoed a woman’s voice over and over again. Jonathan started to run towards the voice and I pulled him back. 
“Stop. What if it’s the creature!” He looked me dead in the eyes. 
“It’s my mums voice I lost her I have to go save her.” He said in a firm tone. I cautiously followed behind him as we got closer and closer to the yelling. It couldn’t have been a human. It was tall,long arms and had several eyes. 

I ran faster than I’d ever run before. I heard a screech and then Jonathan screamed. I turned to see it on top of him stabbing it’s claws into his eyes. I wish I could have been brave and saved him, but I just continued running like a coward. I didn’t want to start again. I wanted to leave. After what seemed like hours I made it back. I went to the kitchen and searched for a knife. I couldn’t cope with it anymore,I had to kill it. I felt a hand slip into mine. It was Jonathan. But it couldn’t be. I felt tears stream down my face. I felt numb and just hugged him tighter than anything, begging him to save us both and kill it. Something stung in my neck. I looked up to him and there it stood. A tall figure,grinning ear to ear.
