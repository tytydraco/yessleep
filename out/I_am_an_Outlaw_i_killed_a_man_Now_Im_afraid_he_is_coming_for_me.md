I am a member of a motorcycle club, and this weekend i saw something that made me wanna quit.
For reasons of anonymity i won't say the name of my club, i'll only refer to it as MC. 
I don't consider myself an author, and haven't written anything longer than a paragraph since high-school. So i figure the best way to start this thing woulf be with a bit o background. 

I'm part of a motorcycle club and have been ever since i gotten my first bike, at around 16. I live in a small town built between a forest and a lake, it's known for it's natural beauty but that is pretty much it. Most of the guys after graduation either move away to bigger cities, join the army or like myself join the local MC.

The MC was always very present on my life, they would donate food and clothing to people in need, run a local soup kitchen for the homeless and even take care of security. You see, between corruption and resources being stretched thin, the local police is pretty much useless when it comes to deterring anything bigger than graffiti. So the MC more often than takes care of domestic problems, thefts, and scare the eventual drug dealer or pimp away from town. 

And my account begins with the latter.

Me and some of the boys were hanging around our bar/clubhouse when a girl walked in, runny make-up, busted limp, swollen cheeks and a black eye. The poor thing was caked in mud and some other stuff i rather not describe. The girls was sobbing uncontrollably, really hard to understand at first, we eventually got her to calm down and she told us a small crew was operating on the outskirts of town, pimping local girls and selling dope to high-school kids, typical scumbag.

So me and the boys got on the bikes and went to check on the adress the girl had given us.

It was an old farmhouse, pretty run-down but still charming somehow. I must've rode by it a couple dozen times but i never noticed any movement around it, so yeah, i was more than a little confused and at first thought we had the wrong adress.

We parked, i walked up to the door, the closer i got the clearer it got, i could hear faint music coming from inside of it and not only that, looking closely at the windows i could see that all the glass was painted over, and that is probably why the house always seemed empty and abandoned.

I knocked at the door, no answer. So i started pounding on it, no answer. Me and the two other guys were getting impatient, and i was about to kick in the door, but decided to give it another try. I knocked and this time, a girls opened the door. She looked as bad as the girl from the bar, if not worse. She was thin as a skeleton, as pale as a candle, her body was covered in bruises that varied from black to green, scabs, scars and dry mud. I was a little shook but snapped out of it pretty quickly.

I cleared ny throat and said "Lady, could you step outside for a moment?" she nodded yes and stepped outside, as she did so i could hear one of my brothers gasp at the sight of the girl. 

I asked if the crew who runs the place was there and she nodded again. I told one of the guys to call the girl an uber, we waited outside with her, fully expecting that one of scumbags if not all of them would show up and stop us from rescuing the girl, but it never happened, she entered the uber and went to our clubhouse. 
Me and the boys took a deep breath, put on our meanest and toughest "badass biker" look and stormed the house, screaming, breaking furniture, bottles, everything if front of us really. 

The house looked exactly as you would expect a crackhouse to look, trash, beers cans, cigarette buts, but what got to me the most was the smell. I mean, we run a bar and it gets messy, but i never smelled something as weird as that house, it smelled like wet mud and rust, once i noticed the smell, it seemed to get stronger with every passing second, it got to a point i was only taking short breaths trying to avoid it. 

After basically trashing the place, me and the boys just stood there, trying to decide who would check the second floor, but, before we could decide, we hear the creaking of old wooden steps, and one of the scumbags comes down the stairs. He stood there, looking at us, seemingly confused at the sight of these 3 leather clad mean looking dudes. One of my brothers, (i'll call him jack) noticed before i did, and said through gritted teeth "Man... look at his hands. That motherfucker likes to beat up girls"

The scumbag's hands was covered in what it looked to be dry blood. Jack lunged at the guy, even at a good 8 feet away i could hear Jack's fist connecting with the guy's jaw, and Jack didn't stop at the first punch, he threw a barrage o heymaker aimed at the guy's head, i was amused at the sight of that scumbag getting what he deserved, but it suddenly changed. The realization was pretty slow, at least for me. 

The first thing i remember was the sound of something wet, like, a wet mop hitting the floor. The second thing i noticed was how still Jack was out of a sudden. And then, what finally made me understand, i heard the sound of liquid hitting the floor boards. And Jack went limp. It wasn't dramatic like in the movies. One second he was a person, and the other he looked like a halfway deflated blow-up doll. 

The man let go of Jack, and Jack's lifeless body immediately hit the floor with a thud. The man, standing there looked as unfazed, he was just standing there, looking at me and my other brother (Bob), holding Jack's spine. His arm was covered in viscera up to his elbow, and he was holding about a foot of Jack's spine as naturally as if it was a stick or a rock. 

I felt my head spinning, my ears were ringing, i felt like i was going to pass out, but i knew right then and there that if i did, i would never wake up. That i would end like Jack a lifeless half deflated doll in this forgotten run-down house. 

When i snapped out of it my pistol was already in my hands, i don'ts remember drewing it, i was clutching it so hard my knuckles had turb white.

I raised the 45, placing the sight right between the man's eyes, and right there, as my finger squeezed the trigger, i noticed for the first time. His eyes were completely black, like a shark's.

 But before i could register it a hole had already been opened on the center of his forehead, my ears were ringing again, Bob was screaming, and i was pulling the trigger again. I pulled the trigger until the gun clicked empty a dozen times, it's not like i heard it doing so, my ears weren't working anymore (to be honest as i type this i can still hear a high pitch noise on my left year) but at some point i realized that the recoil and the muzzle flash had stopped. 

I'll try not to be too graphical, but the man's head and neck looked like ground beef. Without thinking i tucked the gun back into the back of my pants, stupidly burning my asschecks with the red-hot muzzle. The sharp pain made me a lot more aware of the situation. That Jack was dead, that Bob took off, and that i just killed a man, or something that looked a lot like a man.

I was cursing Bob, and trying to think of what to do next. But i felt vibration, it seemed to be coming from under my boots, i was confused, so i looked back at the stairs. That man, no, that thing's body was twitching, like a dying insect, his arms and legs failed around like it was boneless, i stared at it, wide eyed, mouth agape, tears running down my cheeks, my vision got blurry, i wasn't just scared, i was panicked. I didn't even noticed that i was screaming until i felt my throat burning. 

I started waking backwards towards the door, i reached into my pocket, got a second magazine, but my hands shook uncontrollably, it took me 4 or 5 attempts to load the pistol, i couldn't remember how to cock it, i couldn't remember how to turn the safety, so i gave up on it. 

I got outside and jumped on my back, i took the interstate, rode all night, and now i find myself in a hotel in the largest city i could ride to, haven't left the room in a couple of days, nor have i been able to sleep. I keep my gun under my pillow but i know it won't help if that thing come for me. 

I don't even know what i am trying to achieve posting it here, i don't intend to go back and fight in, i am not Geralt of Rivia. I just want ideas on how to protect myself should i ever come face to face with it again. Was it a demon? A vampire? Has anyone ever come across or heard something similar to it.

And lastly, for those who will ask. No Jack was no saint, but he did not deserved to die like that.
