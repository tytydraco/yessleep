[\[Part 18\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1ho0pvq/the_call_of_the_breach_part_18/)

The hospital ward teemed with activity when I walked in; nurses evacuated patients on stretchers, still more were brought in from the front to be treated, and workers moved back and forth to shuttle supply boxes to the waiting trucks. Long shadows clawed at what windows remained in the building, the red sun low in the early winter sky, the day’s end nearing. A light snowfall had begun over the shattered ruins of Black Oak, an otherworldly contrast with the visible sunset that approached, curtains of fine silver flakes tumbling from the sky to kiss the charred earth. Rifle fire still crackled in the distance, accompanied by the dull *thud-thud* of mortar and howitzer shells finding their marks. Acrid diesel exhaust lay heavy on the back of my tongue, the scent coming in from the parking lot outside as our forces gathered like storm clouds before the rain. Our push to encircle the Organs would begin soon, but I dreaded this almost as much, hated the awful moment required of me, and yet knew I could not escape.

*You have to, Hannah.*

Taking a deep breath, I forced one boot before the other, waded down the blood-stained aisle to the end, where curtains separated the living from the dead.

She sat rigid by the cot, a statue of unmoving silence, both chestnut-brown eyes fixated on Andrea’s still face. Lucille’s cheeks bore the trails of a hundred tears through the dirt on her pale skin, smeared in places where she’d wiped at them. Tiny bits of rubble lay stuck in her red hair, rusty-red blood coated the girl’s uniform, and her hands were a mess of unwashed grime. Lucille’s equipment sat nearby, an old bolt action scoped rifle perched atop her knapsack, a weapon that Andrea had given to her the night of our escape from Black Oak. Lucille had covered her sister in a wool blanket, as if Andrea might get cold, though I knew she would never feel such things again. Andrea’s crimson hair lay brushed out in a small halo around her head, the wounds covered by the blanket, only her beautiful face showing, both eyes shut in ethereal repose.

Gut wrenched in agony over the sight, I plunked down on the cot that served as Lucille’s chair, opposite Andrea’s body, and folded both anxious hands in front of myself to keep from shaking. “How you doing?”

Lucille didn’t move, her face a stoney field of unfeeling blankness.

Shifting closer, I pushed some hair from my face and tried to ignore the immense shame in my chest. “When’s the last time you had something to eat?”

“I’m not hungry.” She rasped, her voice quiet and cold, and it made her seem so much older than I knew she was.

“I know.” I twisted my clammy fingers together in an effort to think of something better to say. “But you should try. It’s a long drive back to Ark River.”

At that, her head turned, and Lucille frowned in exhausted confusion. “We’re retreating?”

Her words made my throat want to close up, but I pressed on, shaking my head. “No. We’re evacuating the worst casualties and . . . and those we’ve lost, back to Ark River. I’m giving you a furlough to go down with your sister for the funeral, and some rest afterwards.”

Lucille shut her eyes, as if to steel herself against some reaction that threatened to explode from inside herself, and turned back to Andrea. “I can’t go. We need every rifle we can get here, I have to stay. Besides, we need to save room on the trucks for the wounded.”

*She’s talking like her sister.*

Doing my best not to show how much it hurt to see her like this, I placed a gentle hand on her forearm. “There’s enough room for you. You’ve earned the rest. Besides, I want you to be there for her.”

“You weren’t.” Her words were hard like ice, and Lucille glared at me with a bitter expression that was almost frightening for its vitriol. “None of you were. You went off to bring Sean back and left her on the ground like garbage.”

My wince must have been a mile wide, but I tried my best to salvage the situation and inched closer to her side. “Sean was going to get himself hurt. I had to make a choice, Lucille. Everything he did was because of what happened to Andrea.”

“He shouldn’t have dragged her out there in the first place.” Lucille looked down at her grungy fingernails, her jaw working, and I could sense the anger boiling just below the surface of her forced coolness. “It was a trap, everyone could see it. I wish it had been him.”

*As if Andrea would suffer any less with that guilt on her conscience.*

For a moment, I thought of Sean’s broken expression as I’d bandaged him up in the shell-cratered outpost. “Not more than he does. Of all the people in this world, Sean knows more about what you’re feeling than anyone. He loved your sister, and even if he gets better . . . well . . . I don’t think he’ll ever forgive himself for what happened today.”

Lucille’s face rippled, and some of the anger softened as a single, silvery tear managed to escape her left eye.

“Why do they hate us so much?” She met my gaze at last, and I saw a glimpse of the girl within her, shattered, alone, and lost.

With no adequate words to say, I wound my arms around her shoulders and pulled her close.

Lucille buried her face in my collar, wept hard and fierce, shaking like a leaf in the wind. For my part, I let myself do the same, my own tears hot and salty. How many were gone now, how many who had done so much for us, guided us, saved us? Tex, Professor Carheim, Kaba, Andrea, they were more than just names to add to the little black notebook. They were a part of a world we no longer belonged in, a place that no longer existed, a life that had been stolen from us a long time ago.

A part of us that had been murdered, right before our very eyes.

“You’re going to be okay.” I stroked her hair, and whispered the words I would have wanted to hear, knowing it wasn’t enough to heal the pain in her heart.

Lucille whipped her head back and forth against my uniform breast pocket. “I don’t want to be. Not if it means doing this, over and over again. I can’t.”

*If I could take the pain from you, if I could bear it for you, I would.*

“It has to end someday.” Rocking her in my arms, I swallowed a guilty lump that came from saying something I myself wasn’t sure of. “And when it does, we’ll make sure people remember your sister, along with everyone else we’ve lost. You can stay with me, for as long as you want.”

Her stubbornness returned, and Lucille pushed herself from my embrace to glower through her watery eyes. “And if you die too?”

My breath caught in my throat, not from fear of the notion, but from the uncomfortable sensation that, somehow, such an event wasn’t that far off. “Chris will look after you, he’s—”

“He’s not my family.” Lucille sniffled and glanced back at Andrea’s ash-gray face. “They’re all gone. Everything’s gone, my school, my friends, my house, *everything*, and for what?”

Again, I found myself at a loss for words, and Lucille seemed to take my silence as an answer.

“I wish it had been me instead of her.” She straightened up, her face hardened into its former stoney countenance, and it seemed Lucille’s hatred rekindled with each hissed syllable. “It should’ve been me. I’m going to kill them all.”

*In this state, I’m more worried about you turning on yourself.*

Disturbed at that idea, I eyed her rifle and reached for its sling.

“Leave it.” Lucille didn’t even look toward me, but the contempt in her voice for my action was evident. She tossed her head in pride at the nearby bunks, where the corpses of a few civilian girls who had taken razor blades to their own wrists lay shrouded in cotton veils. “I’m not going out like the others did. I’m not that weak.”

Deep shards of torment cut through my heart at her callous words, this new Lucille growing to despise the old to the point that she was almost cruel.

Letting my gaze rest on one of the corpses in question, I wondered who the girl under the sheet had been, what nightmares she’d endured, and how broken she had to be to take such desperate, tragic measures. “People handle pain differently.”

Lucille snorted but said nothing, refusing to even follow my eyes to the dead all around her.

*This is hopeless. I can’t stay here, it’s not doing her any good. The sooner she’s on that convoy to Ark River, the better.*

Rising to my feet, I let out a long, disappointed sigh, and shrugged the strap of my Type 9 higher on one shoulder. “The trucks leave in fifteen minutes. They’ll help load Andrea to be sure she gets there, and I’ve left orders for you to have a seat in the same vehicle. I’ll check in with you over the radio in a day or two, okay?”

“Just leave me alone.” With a final parting growl, Lucille scooted away from me, her eyes firmly locked on her sister’s dead face.

I walked out to my waiting armored pickup with half sobs threatening to choke me, and residual sorrow in my eyes. We were winning, our forces would soon be rolling the enemy resistance up like a rug, but I couldn’t feel any sort of joy or excitement. This war was a soul-grinding torture, one long continuous bad dream I couldn’t wake up from. More than anything, I wanted to talk to someone, to Jamie, or Chris, but they were both out of my reach. Chris had already left for the eastern flank, and Jamie was miles away from here, on some island in Maple Lake, all thanks to my choices.

*Here's to hoping all the Organ soldiers just give up and go home.*

Sneering at my own naïve wishes, I clambered into the driver’s seat of my armored pickup and checked my watch in the reddish glare of the setting sun.

*Boom, boom, boom.*

Right on cue, the mortars, howitzers, and other artillery we had barked to life, shells whistling overhead on their long arc toward the enemy. Buildings erupted across the line from us in flames, dust and rubble forming an avalanche below each on that swallowed entire streets. Even in the idling pickup, I felt the reverberations of the impacts in my seat and tasted the acrid smoke as more fires started all across the battered city. It was the heaviest bombardment we’d ever undertaken, both with our armory-made weapons and three captured ELSAR field guns that sat not far behind our headquarters. Long barreled, with enormous 155mm rounds that we could never have manufactured back at New Wilderness, these guns thundered with vengeance as the crews worked to feed more ammunition into the smoking maws of the beasts.

I clicked my radio mic and swabbed the last tears from my eyes with a jacket sleeve. “Alright western flank, this is Sparrow One Actual; we are on a general advance, I say again, general advance. Weapons free and move forward at speed. Sparrow One Actual, out.”

We rolled forward at speed, past frontline obstacles cleared by Worker units with hand tools and explosive charges, and into the maze of the western districts. Rifle fire hurtled in at us sporadically in the dark, but with the ASV’s at our side, their machine guns belching fire at every sniper who dared show their face, we overran block after block. Night closed in as fast as we did, but even that did not stop our advance, and at last we reached the farthest point of previous advancement. I caught sight of a few of the green-uniformed troops that waved to us from the windows of a bullet-riddled boutique store, and had my command truck pull over.

A white toothed smile flashed from the darkness of a nearby window, and a male voice rose on the snow-sprinkled breeze. “Hey Nick, you recognize this one?”

The machine gunner’s assistant poked his frazzled head out of the fire-blackened window frame to make an exaggerated squint at me. “You know, she might have been with us at the gate. I mean, she *looks* familiar. Can’t place that rank though.”

Despite myself, the corners of my mouth tugged upward in relief at feeling something other than guilt, regret, and mourning. True, each step back amongst familiar faces made me think of Lucille, but at the same time I realized it helped to distract me from the horrible events at the square. In a strange way, I *needed* this, needed to be on the edge of the fighting in order to keep the silence from driving me insane.

*This is where I belong, not sitting in some hospital watching the dead. I’d give anything never to go back there again. How do I feel more at home on the front than in my own tent at the rear?*

“Must be brass.” Henry rose from behind his 240 machine gun and stretched so that his back popped in a few places.

“Gotta be.” Nick folded his arms as he leaned against the brickwork and they both granted me a grinning salute. “Good to see you ma’am.”

“It’s good to be back.” Somewhat buoyed by their friendly teasing, I waved off Nick’s salute as I headed for the only path through the wire ringing the building. “You boys ready to move out? Where’s Sergeant McPhearson?”

“Heard you were coming.” Charlie appeared from the caved-in doorway of the boutique store, and took a moment to watch the rest of the convoy move forward to attack the enemy front line down the street. “Is this a fire sale? I asked for one mortar crew, not the whole damn army.”

“Well, I wanted to throw a pizza party, but they were all out of pepperoni.” Reaching for my opposite shoulder, I unslung the scoped rifle I’d captured at the enemy outpost and held it out to him. “Merry Christmas. Takes the same rounds as your M4, so you won’t have to scrounge.”

Charlie’s bushy eyebrows jumped with pleasant surprise, and he let out a low whistle as he took the AR in his hands. “A fine piece. Someone really put some time into setting this baby up. Sure you don’t want to hold on to it?”

“I prefer my own.” I tapped the cold steel receiver of my Type 9 and angled my head at the parked armored trucks of 4^(th) platoon, camouflaged in a nearby garage to keep them safe from enemy recon drones. “You’ve been busy. How bad was it to get the Organs out?”

“They gave us a good run for our money.” Charlie eyed the ASV’s as they passed by with their big cannons on the turrets. “But we sent them running back to that training facility further north. Been seeing lots of movement up that way.”

*And there’s about to be a lot more.*

With a deep sigh of dread for what was to come, I pointed up the street at the tail of our column. “Well, the armor is going to punch us a hole. Get the boys up and have them fall in behind me. Clock’s ticking.”

4^(th) platoon quickly emptied from their temporary fortress and crowded into their trucks with gleeful anticipation. These fell into line with my truck, and we rejoined the several prongs of the advance all along the western end of the city, ASV’s in the lead, armored pickups behind them. As soon as they were encountered, enemy strongholds were simply blasted with the 90mm main guns on the ASV’s, clearing the way for our fast-dismount infantry to seize each building by storm. Often, this wasn’t necessary; hand-picked resistance scouts had done their work well behind enemy lines in the past few days, and most strongpoints were already rubble thanks to our artillery by the time we reached them. Gray uniformed figures ran helter-skelter in the wake of this, only for our turret-mounted gunners to cut them down with ease. It was the most ground we’d gained in 72 hours . . . and that left a nagging feeling in the pit of my chest.

*There should be two or three companies of Organs covering this flank at minimum. Did they all just disappear? How do you hide hundreds of soldiers?*

We made our way to a sprawling industrial park, where a cluster of factory buildings sat in a broad ring around a massive concrete parking lot. The buildings themselves were huge, with smokestacks on some of them, and a prefabricated concrete wall encircled the compound to ensure thieves and vandals couldn’t get in during peacetime. Various industrial tractors, forklifts, and flatbed trucks were left in the middle parking lot, along with pallets of various manufacturing material stacked here and there. In the darkness of night, everything appeared vast, arcane, and grim, like a temple of some ancient deity of iron. There were so many ventilation grates, so many windows, and my spine tingled with the severity of our situation. Even a small team of enemy machine gunners, snipers, or mortar crews could have wreaked havoc from such vantage points.

In that spirit, I had my other columns split off to continue their assault, thus cutting off the surrounding neighborhoods from the factory as well. Our armored trucks secured the various gates, and as one, three platoons worth of infantry disgorged to fan out across the compound. Ordering my pickup to hunker down behind the first production shop on the eastern side of the park, I let our troops dismount, and the soldiers of 4^(th) Platoon gathered around the back of the truck.

Breath fogging in the cold air, I knelt on the asphalt parking lot with them and clicked my radio mic. “All western column units, report status. Sparrow One Actual is in industrial compound, moving to secure. No contact so far. How copy, over?”

My radio headset crackled, and I eyed the fiery skyline of Black Oak to watch muzzle flashes dance across rooftops from the distant eastern flank, where Chris’s columns seemed to be pushing the enemy hard.

*“Rhino Two Actual, we’re still oscar-mike. About four blocks north of you. Three blocks from primary objective.”*

*“This is Rhino Three Actual, we are swinging five blocks to the south of your position, encountering some light rifle fire, but still oscar-mike.”*

Satisfied that our advance was continuing as scheduled, I checked my Type 9 as the other platoons split up to begin sweeping the other buildings. “Okay guys, let’s take this easy. Remember, slow is smooth, smooth is fast. If we run into anything nasty, we call for the ASV’s to do their work.”

They nodded in resolute silence, and I took a moment to adjust the way my knapsack hung on my shoulders, feeling the weight of the launch panel buried inside. None of the platoon knew I had it with me, and none of them knew what it was for. I had promised Chris I would be careful, so as not to let so valuable a weapon fall into enemy hands, but at the same time I couldn’t bring myself to hide in the safety of an armored truck while the others scoured the pitch-black factory themselves. There were more men than just my platoon under my command now, and I wasn’t about to take that responsibility lightly.

*A good officer leads from the front.*

Into the shadows we went, no weapon lights used outside the buildings, less anyone draw sniper fire. Our armored vehicles served to illuminate the parking lot with their headlights, since they could take a bullet easily, and would distract enemy riflemen from our exposed troops. Still, for most of my troops seeing in the dimly lit city was difficult, but the multiple fires in adjacent buildings from the shelling made it somewhat easier. Myself, I had my enhanced eyesight to rely on, not enough to see in total darkness, but enough to filter out more light than normal human eyes. After a nerve-wracking five-minute search, one of the lead squads found a man door at the back of the production shop and managed to pry it loose with a crowbar.

Inside, we found a quiet factory with dusty machines, scattered debris from where the roof of the plant had taken some shelling, but nothing else. No enemies waited in the shadows, no hidden grenades, or booby traps. Like most of Black Oak at this point, the power had been cut, either from shellfire, or by deliberate ELSAR sabotage. Tall racks of box-laded pallets lined one side of the cavernous room, the entire area like a forest of steel beams and struts. Catwalks crisscrossed the ceiling overhead and went through the pallet racks themselves like airborne superhighways. Still more narrow metal walkways existed above these, a three-tiered system that would have put workers who used them a dizzying thirty feet or more off the ground. It made the hair on my arms stand on end as we climbed a set of angle-iron stairs to the uppermost story above the production shop, where large ventilation windows overlooked the massive parking lot on one side of the building, and the rest of the city outside the compound from the other.

Only a few times had I been able to glimpse Black Oak from such a height, and even then, never like this. Fires burned everywhere, the city seemed a charnel skeleton of its former self, from the lowest houses to the fancy high-rise buildings erected by feverish ELSAR construction crews. Red and green tracer rounds skipped back and forth over the rooftops and in between streets as the Organs continued their running battle between Chris’s forces and mine. It reminded me of lasers from a sci-fi movie, and I tasted burned tar on the wind, evidence of more structural fires that would guarantee another wave of homeless refugees.

Clicking on a small penlight with red cellophane taped over the lens to make it harder to spot from a distance, I pulled out my map board and held it so Charlie could see as well. “So, we’re here, maybe a handful of blocks from the prison camp. Our right flank is here, north of us, and the left is south, here. That puts this compound squarely in the middle.”

“From the tracers, I’d put Commander Dekker’s advance right here.” Charlie tapped a spot on the map to the east of us, near the airfield. “Maybe three miles or so. He might be on the tarmac already.”

Frowning, I scanned the inky nighttime streets beyond as our troops began to set up positions within the compound, blocking the gates with their trucks, stacking debris in windows to form gunports, or finding good places for machine gun perches. This place was a veritable fortress in its own right, and yet Crow’s forces hadn’t appeared in serious numbers at all. There were supposed to be at least a battalion of them . . . so where were they?

*Crow’s smart, there’s no way she missed this place. Maybe she was killed in the shelling? Maybe they’re retreating to the northern border with Koranti’s men?*

“There’s the prison camp.” Sergeant McPherson pointed to a collection of guard towers just beyond the industrial park, the footprint of the facility almost as big as the compound’s. “Look at all the smoke. What do you figure got hit?”

My gut churned, and I hoped that it hadn’t been a barracks full of the very prisoners we were trying to liberate, but I had no way of knowing. Instead, I just shrugged and penciled in the furthest limits of our advance thus far, the red penlight tucked under my chin. “Guess we’ll find out when we get there. We’ll use this place as an aid station and supply point. If we dig in some of our heavy machine guns on the upper windows, they can cover us while we cross to the other—”

*Ka-boom.*

A massive explosion rocked the neighborhoods to the north of our position, sending a plume of orange flame and black smoke into the air. A bright glow lit up the overcast clouds for just a moment, almost as if the sun had come back out. On the heels of the miniature mushroom cloud, a shockwave rattled the entire factory under my boots, and some of the glass in the windows cracked from the force of the blow. More car alarms went off throughout the abandoned residential areas, and my radio flared to life in both eardrums.

*“IED! Rhino Two Actual is down!”*

*“Did anyone see a spotter?”*

*“Sparrow One Actual, this is Rhino Two-Two, the road is blocked on the northern side of the advance; they dropped an entire building on our lead vic. Be advised, we have casualties. Requesting immediate medical support, over.”*

As if in response, a barrage of machine gun fire kicked up from the south, the intensity unlike anything that we’d faced in tonight’s movements so far.

*“R-Rhino Three Six to Sparrow One Actual, we’re taking heavy fire in the south! They’re coming in from all sides. I repeat, we have enemy contact on all sides.”*

Across the parking lot, a streak of red shot up into the sky, the flare arcing in a long, bloody trail across the smoke.

My blood froze. Chris had said three flares, not one. That wasn’t ours.

A tidal wave of human roars poured out of the abyss that was Black Oak’s interior, and the night exploded with small arms fire.

In a solid mass of thunderous boots on cement, the enemy surged from the houses behind us, from the apartments to our left and shops to our right, over rubble piles and across shell craters to enclose the compound on every approach. They ran screaming like demons, carrying rifles, unit flags, and explosive satchel charges bound to their chests. Even the whistles of our incoming artillery shells were drowned out by the colossal rumble of their charge, and machine gun fire lashed out of the buildings behind them to force our riflemen back. Rockets swished through the air to explode around our positions, mortar rounds screamed in from concealed gun pits beyond our reach, and the truth hit me with a cold, deadly finality.

There weren’t hundreds of Organs between my column and Chris’s.

There were thousands.
