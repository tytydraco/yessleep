&#x200B;

Here we go again, I think I’m ready to share a few more stories with you guys. I’ve had my interior camera running since day one and I always save anything interesting that happens so I definitely have enough fodder for more internet stories. After 13 years of driving I’ve developed a pretty decent sized folder of bizarre encounters for you.

&#x200B;

Also to my daughter who I know is reading this because she found my Reddit account, I’m sorry. I really didn’t want you to find out about how dangerous my job can be in that way but I just don’t have a gage for these things you know? I don’t know when you’re supposed to be old enough to handle this crazy stuff. To me you’re still just a baby and I know that you’re not one but I can’t stop wanting to protect you alright? Just know that your old man is trying with everything he has, and well…

&#x200B;

I’ll make these next three stories ones I haven’t told you yet so you can be surprised as well.

&#x200B;

This one goes way back to the first year I started driving. I wasn’t a total novice but you could say I was still lacking a bit of experience. It was pretty late at night, I had the baby sitter overnight so I spent the midnight hours on the streets trolling for passengers. This small group of 3 people waved me down from the entrance of a bar so I stopped to pick them up. The back of my car seats 2 but I figured they wouldn’t mind squeezing in. There were two guys and one girl.

&#x200B;

“Hey guys! Hop in, careful watch your step.” I said.

&#x200B;

“HahAH, thanks! Come on move it’s cold!” One of them said.

&#x200B;

They were all laughing and visibly drunk, the smell of alcohol filled my car pretty much immediately after they all piled in.

&#x200B;

“Take us to my house please! Thank you haha!” The girl said, then she balled up a $20 and threw it at me.

&#x200B;

“Hey! Don’t throw anything at me while I’m driving or I kick all of you out alright?” I said.

&#x200B;

“Finnneeee just take me home already!” She said.

&#x200B;

“You have to tell me where you live first.”I said.

&#x200B;

They all turned to each other and laughed. It took three more attempts of asking them were she lived before one of the guys finally told me. I wish I knew then what I knew now, installing a closable window between the back and front seats really comes in handy when your drunk passengers think it’s the funniest thing in the world to throw things at you. This went on for about half their trip before something bounced off the back of my head and I’d had enough.

&#x200B;

I stopped the car on the side of the road.

&#x200B;

“HEY! That’s enough! You throw on-“ I stopped mid sentence.

&#x200B;

The girl was gone. Just not there between the two boys, they didn’t even look like they noticed. I hadn’t stopped the whole tip until now, and the car door never opened.

&#x200B;

“Where’s the girl?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“What girl? There’s a giiiirrrlllll?” The boy on the left said while making obnoxious sounds I’d rather not describe.

&#x200B;

“The girl that was with you! Where did she go?” I asked again.

&#x200B;

“Hahaha brooo our cabbie is drunk too! He’s seeing things!” The other one chimed in.

&#x200B;

I was stunned, not just by how this girl managed to just disappear from my cab mid trip but also how oblivious these two boneheads were being about it.

&#x200B;

“Just drive man, I promise I won’t throw anything at you again I swear!” Said one of them.

&#x200B;

At this point I was ignoring them, I drove all the way back along the same roads and looked for her, but didn’t find a thing. There was no trace of her anywhere, and the two morons in the back seat were not helping. I drove them to the address they gave me and they both got out. They wadded up more money and just tossed it at the car as they walked away laughing into a completely empty lot between two houses. Her whole house and anyone who lived there was gone too. Just a concrete square between two normal looking houses in a subdivision.

&#x200B;

I drove off before the duo of drunken idiots could realize they were not where they wanted to be and drove to the police station to see if they could help. I gave them her description and everything I knew that happened but it was clear from the start that I wasn’t going to be taken seriously. I guess I should have known that a drunk girl not coming home after one night of bar hopping wouldn’t be high on their priority list.

&#x200B;

I actually started to think that I was the one who lost it, until I remembered I had interior camera footage. I played back the video and I was glad to see I wasn’t crazy as there definitely was a young girl with the group at the start. I scrolled though the video a bit and watched in horror as she just disappears from my back seat. I even slowed down the video frame by frame. My camera takes video at 30 frames per second and between two frames of video, she just blinks out of existence. In 1/30th of a second she’s just gone.

&#x200B;

The police had no interest in this footage, they chalked it up as a glitch in the video or some kinda of prank. It was kinda terrifying how little they seemed to care, it made me wonder how many times something like this could have happened and no one even noticed. It was the second time walking back to my car from the police station when I noticed something sitting on the floor of my back seat. It was her drivers license.

&#x200B;

Her name was Taylor Evens, and now other than me, you guys reading this are the only ones who know that she ever existed. No one looked for her, no one missed her, no one even noticed. I still have her ID, sitting in a box with some other stuff left in the back of my cab that someone might eventually come looking for. I hope that somehow, against all odds, I’ll have the chance to give it back to her one day.

&#x200B;

I’ve learned a lot from experiences like that. Over the years the shit that happens to you starts to pile up and before you know it you’ve seen it all, but that doesn’t mean it’s any less terrifying, just that you’ve got better odds of knowing what to do when that shit hits the fan. I have a motto I like to think I live by that applies to this next story pretty well.

&#x200B;

“You prepared yesterday to live today to prepare for tomorrow.”

&#x200B;

It was the summer season, and like most people with jobs, when it gets nice out you get busy. Lots of people got in and out of my cab this day, to and from a hundred different places, which is why when I found a suitcase stashed under my seat at the end of the day, I really didn’t have much hope of finding who it belonged to. Even after searching through the footage afterwards I couldn’t get a good look at anyone bringing a suitcase into my cab. Either way, I knew just what to do.

&#x200B;

It’s probably not a surprise to hear that people leave things in my cab a lot. Usually it’s a phone or a wallet and people will realize real quick where they left it. If it’s something valuable like that I always take it to the local police station for them to hold onto. It works out for me because either I get to reunite people with their lost shit or after a certain time period where no owner can be found, you get to keep the stuff you send in. This process also keeps me safe from any legal liability, can’t say I stole anything if I took to right to the police station. So that’s exactly what I did with that suitcase.

&#x200B;

I took it into the police station the next morning without even trying to open it. In my experience if I did open it then I could have been accused of stealing anything that might have gone missing from it, which I didn’t want to have happen. I dropped it off and went right back to driving my cab, didn’t think much about it.

&#x200B;

About two hours after I dropped off the suit case a disheveled man frantically waved me down from the sidewalk. Soon as a hopped in he started spit firing questions at me faster then I could answer.

&#x200B;

“Hey! Are you the cab driver from yesterday? Yes! I recognize you! You drove me yesterday to the university remember? Ok, this is really important, do you remember seeing a suitcase? Like this big and it was brown, little worn down? Did you open it?” He said.

&#x200B;

“Whoa there hold on, you’re looking for a suitcase?” I said.

&#x200B;

“Yes! Yes! My suitcase! I need it back do you have it?” He said.

&#x200B;

“Calm down will ya? I dropped it off at the police station yesterday night when I found it, we can stop by to pick it up if you want me to take you there but it won’t be a free trip” I said.

&#x200B;

His face goes white, for the first time since he got into my cab he was silent for a few seconds.

&#x200B;

“The police have it? Are you sure?” He said.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, took it there a few hours ago, you alright?” I said.

&#x200B;

“It’s too late.” He said.

&#x200B;

He had this horrible look in his eye, like just watched someone die.

&#x200B;

“I need you to take me to the airport. Now. And if you’re smart you’ll buy a ticket for yourself too.” he continued.

&#x200B;

“What? Why? What the hell are you talking about?” I asked

&#x200B;

He buries his head in his hands.

&#x200B;

“Never mind, it doesn’t matter now.” he said.

&#x200B;

And with that he stepped out of my cab and sulked off down the street.

&#x200B;

Later that day sirens blared throughout the city constantly. Roads were blocked and people were getting emergency broadcasts to stay home. According to official reports the police station I dropped the suitcase off had a dangerous gas leak and they were worried about a possible explosion. Whole block was closed up. That was the official report anyway, but according to an inside source I have, it was a total lie. I really don’t want to get my source in trouble because they’re a good friend of mine so I won’t tell you anything about them, but just know that when I say they’re trustworthy on this topic, I mean it.

&#x200B;

The problem wasn’t a gas leak, but that suitcase I brought in. Some of the officers decided to open it up and look for some identifiable information on who it belonged to. When they opened it up it was empty, nothing in it but a few pens and blank sheet of paper. Only a few minutes after opening it some officers started to get sick. One after another they got dizzy and started vomiting.

&#x200B;

Immediately alarm bells started ringing for all staff present and it broke into real chaos. The suitcase was basically thrown into a holding cell and ambulances were called for the sick officers, but it was too late. One by one, every sick officer who was too close to the briefcase just started melting.

&#x200B;

It started with their skin, just peeling off of their bodies and melting off onto the floor. The whole station was submerged in bloody screams and begs for help. Some of the on lookers wanted to help, but anyone who did would succumb to the same fate as the diseased. Some officers started to kill themselves at the first symptom, anything to avoid the excruciating feeling of helplessly watching your own skin melt away. Any police officer who didn’t punch their own ticket would eventually melt into a puddle entirely. My source said he was one of 6 people that wasn’t killed.

&#x200B;

“What happened to the briefcase?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“The CDC swooped in, got me out and 5 others who didn’t melt. They took the briefcase but I’m not sure where.” He said.

&#x200B;

“Fuck man, what the hell was in that briefcase?!” I asked.

&#x200B;

He takes another sip of his whiskey. We were over at my place late that night, my daughter was in bed. We were playing some card games and drinking away the stress.

&#x200B;

“Some genetically modified shit, I don’t know I’m not a scientist, but it was bad, real bad. If a regular virus is a roomba, this thing was the fucking terminator man.” He answered.

&#x200B;

At the end of the day the CDC managed to spin the story into a gas leak and nobody even knows that anyone died that day, I don’t know how they did it but here we are. From what he told me they still have that briefcase so I’m willing to bet they still have some of that virus kept as a sample. I just hope they don’t do anything terrible with it.

&#x200B;

I felt pretty horrible about the whole situation, I mean I basically delivered a bio weapon to the police station and killed a bunch of people, but I guess it could have been way worse. The guy who owned the briefcase said he wanted to go the the university, and I took him there! I doubt he was there for a lecture, I bet you he was planning on killing off the whole school. If he hadn’t forgot the case or if I brought it back to him, who knows how many people could have died? So, if you live in a big city and go to a university there, it’s possible I may have accidentally saved your life. You’re welcome.

&#x200B;

I’m not the smartest guy in the world, everyone makes mistakes sometimes and I’m no different. I’d like to think that when the time comes to make a critical decision I’d always make the right choice, but sometimes you look back and kick yourself over not thinking long enough. Not every ultimatum can be solved with common sense, sometimes you just make the wrong choice.

&#x200B;

I struggled a bit with whether or not I want to tell you guys this last story because I don’t want you to think of me as a bad guy. I do good things all the time, but at the end of the day I’m a father first and a cabbie second.

&#x200B;

This story is about my late wife Angie. To my daughter if you’re still reading, I think it’s time I told you what happened to your mother.

&#x200B;

She was beautiful when we first met, long blonde hair and beautiful blue eyes. Her name was Angie but to me she was an angel. We did everything together, two peas in a pod style. It was no wonder only 6 months after we met I was down on one knee. I wasn’t really well off at the time, fresh out of college with a useless degree and thousands in debt. Her father was a rich businessman, we got along really well even with our financial differences. He actually bought the ring for me to give her.

&#x200B;

About 18 months after that, a baby girl was born. Now, I was a little bit scared at first about being a father, you never really feel ready to bring new life into this world, but I swear, looking into that little girls eyes for the first time changed everything. I would set the world on fire for her. However, as I grew exceptionally maternal, my wife started acting like a complete stranger. She was irritable and distant, the longer we stayed together the more different she became.

&#x200B;

We fought every night, yelling and screaming about nothing, it was miserable. No matter hard I tried, I just couldn’t figure out what was wrong with her. She just, changed into this monster who was so angry at everything. She started doing drugs, I’m not much of a drug guy so I don’t really know what kinds but she always had bottles and needles in her bag. I was just so over the constant arguing I didn’t even care. I mean hey, you can’t yell at me if you’re stoned and lethargic, so I let it go on way longer then it should have. 2 years this went on, and I just let it happen.

&#x200B;

The final straw for me is when I watched this monster wearing my wife’s skin, slap our daughter across the face for crying too loud. I lost it, just completely lost it. No one will ever lay a hand on my daughter and get away with it, no matter who you are. I kicked her out of the house and threw all of her stuff into the sidewalk. I locked the windows and put new locks on the doors. Never again.

&#x200B;

The divorce was messy, but after drug substances were found in her purse, I was given custody of our kid. She didn’t even seem upset. It was soon after that I started my job as a cab driver. Her family had the money, and after I kicked her out she took the money with her. The next 4 months pass and I don’t hear a word from her, no calls or texts, nothing. Then one day this couple wave me down from the side of the street, so I picked them up.

&#x200B;

“Hey, how are ya?” I said.

&#x200B;

“I’m doing fantastic now thank you!” Said the women.

&#x200B;

She had matted blonde hair with ratty clothes, really skinny and sick looking. The guy stepped into the car next and was kinda the same way, short spotty hair and track marks on his arm.

&#x200B;

“How have you been? It’s been a while!” Says the girl.

&#x200B;

I turned around to face them and I could hardly believe what I was seeing. It was Angie, along with what must be her coked out new boyfriend.

&#x200B;

“Angie? Is that you?” I said.

&#x200B;

“Sure is! You miss me yet?” She said.

&#x200B;

“Hey! Who the fuck are you?” Said that guy in the back.

&#x200B;

“That’s my ex, don’t worry though he’s a loser! Hahaha!” Said Angie

&#x200B;

I was speechless, she looked like she just crawled out of a crack den. Dried skin, bone skinny, black teeth. It was horrible to see such a beautiful young girl turn into this creature that in my back seat.

&#x200B;

“Yo, we gunna have a problem here?” Said the guy.

&#x200B;

“No way this little bitch spends all his time with that little pest, I don’t even think about him anymore.” Said Angie.

&#x200B;

“Don’t you dare fucking talk about our daughter that way Angel.” I said.

&#x200B;

It was a bit of a slip of the tongue, I called her Angel while we were together and I guess it slipped out. Regardless it made the guy in the back irrationally angry.

&#x200B;

“Yo hold up, Angel? The fuck? You have a kid? With this fuckin bitch?” He said.

&#x200B;

He grabbed a fist full of Angie’s hair and opened the car door on his side.

&#x200B;

“You fucking slut!” He said as he pulled her across my back seat and out the door by her hair.

&#x200B;

She started screaming and kicking saying I was a liar and she would never have a kid with someone like me. He wasn’t listening to a word she said, he just pulled her onto the street and stood over her screaming about how much of a slut she was.

&#x200B;

I stayed in my cab and just watched from my mirror. I was just so depressed watching this happen and even more depressed by what she said, I just sat there holding back tears. In that moment I thought about my daughter, how I couldn’t let myself get wrapped up into this shit because she needed me. My ex did this to herself and I wasn’t going to end up in that rotten world she lived in, so I left, put my cab in drive and just left her there in the street pleading for help. I looked one last time out of my rear view mirror at them before I got too far away, the last time I ever saw her was when she was getting kicked on the ground in the middle of the street.

&#x200B;

I drove straight home and parked in my driveway before I broke down in tears. I felt horrible for leaving her like that, but all I wanted to do in that moment is to just get away from that whole mess. I walked into my home, payed the babysitter and locked the door. I went up to my daughters room and sat on the floor next to her bed. She was only 2 years old but I could tell she was going to be the sweetest young lady you’d ever meet. I slept on the floor in her room that night, it felt safer for me to be there between her and the door.

&#x200B;

Two weeks later the police picked up my ex-wife for breaking into a pharmacy. Given her condition, they pretty much shipped her straight to the hospital for evaluation. At the time I was still listed as her emergency contact so when she was admitted I was called. I didn’t want to, but I ended up driving all the way up to the hospital she was sent to. I guess I was looking for a bit of closure and this was my last chance to get it.

&#x200B;

Her doctor brought me to her room, he had this weird look on his face like he was trying to say something but didn’t know how. Either way, I entered her room and saw her for the first time since that night she got into my cab.

&#x200B;

“Hey Angie, you doing alright?” I said.

&#x200B;

“I’ll be fine, as soon as I let them out.” She said.

&#x200B;

“Let what out? What do you mean?” I said.

&#x200B;

“My spores, I just need to set them free to grow and spread.” She said.

&#x200B;

Then she stuck out her finger and pushed it into her temple. Her skull just gives way to her finger and she pushes deep into her own head, knuckle deep. I stumbled backwards, in horrified shock and what I was seeing. She pulls out her finger in one quick motion making a sickening gargling noise, then greenish brown ooze pours out of her punctured temple like a faucet.

&#x200B;

The nurses panic and run into the room with towels and gauze. They press down on the side of my wife’s wound to try and stop the leakage, but instead they only warp her soft skull even worse then before. All of the nurses and myself watch in horror as the whole top of my wife’s head sagged to the side before slopping off onto the floor in a pile of ooze and rot.

&#x200B;

The autopsy of her body revealed her entire head was just rotting away from the inside. The coroners believe that she was infected by a completely new microscopic fungal parasite that slowly ate and replaced her brain for years of her life. This meant that on that day I saw her in the back of my cab, her brain was already mush.

&#x200B;

When I heard this, a wave of flashbacks hit me all at once. All the times she screamed at me, all those drugs she took, all those poor choices she made, what if all of that was a symptom of her brain rotting away? Could I have saved her if I just payed more attention? I felt sick to my stomach. If I wasn’t so blinded by my hatred for my ex wife I could have brought back the woman I once loved. She was sick the whole time, and I left her there on the street getting her teeth kicked in.

&#x200B;

I’ll regret that moment for the rest of my life. I should have at least called the police or said something, but I didn’t. She died and I can’t think of a single thing I did to try and help her. In the end, I didn’t even get to say goodbye.

&#x200B;

From then on I think back on my ex wife fondly. I choose to focus on the parts of her in my memory that were beautiful. Like making burned pancakes for breakfast or watching cheesy horror movies together. I can still see that look in her eye she had when we found out she was pregnant. All of the good things that she was is still here, with me even through the hell that she went through. It’s not much but I hope it’s enough.

&#x200B;

I’m sorry Angel.
