*PART ONE*

*I always thought my stepmom was pretty normal. That was until she came home after an 8 day trip with multiple cases of eggs.*

*My stepmom came into my life about 5 years ago. I grew to love her, especially seeing how happy she made my dad. Occasionally I would see glimpses of what my childhood used to be like when I watched him kiss her like he used to kiss my mom, but in the end I knew he was happier. So it made me happier.*

*The night before her trip, she came into my room and asked me about the book I was reading. “They both die at the end” one of my favorites.*

***“What’s the point in reading if you know how it ends?”***

*“Well.. that’s kinda the beauty of it, we know how it ends yet apart of us keeps hoping one of the characters break free from it” “it’s kind of like life to be honest.. but I don’t know, I just really love the love story of it all”*

***“You’re a really bright girl lily”***

*I could tell after she said this something was wrong. Her face seemed like she was holding something back, almost like she wanted to tell me something but she knew she couldn’t.*

***“Listen, tomorrow I have to go on a trip for work, but I’ll be back before you know it. Please make sure your dad takes it medicine because he’s been pretty stubborn about it”***

*I didn’t think much of it of course, but I was worried about whatever was wrong with her. But I let it go.*

*The next day I woke up and she was gone. My dad decided he wasn’t going to go to work that day and we could just stay home and watch movies. I found this quite odd since he usually doesn’t stay home from work, but I just figured that since Amber usually doesn’t go on trips, he must of just been lonely.*

*5 days went past as normal. Pretty boring, usual life stuff.*

*It was on day 6 when things started shifting.*

***“Hey lils, can you come sit for a moment?”***

*My dad wanted me to sit next to him on the couch, I got a little worried since not even the tv was on. As I was waking I started thinking that Amber got into an accident or something.*

***“So listen, I want to take you on a trip tomorrow. You know, somewhere we have never been before.”***

*“Wait really? What about work? Are we going to surprise Amber?”*

*He didn’t like that I brought her up. I could see it on his face. Whatever is going on it makes me uncomfortable. Why are they both trying to get out the house?*

*His phone rang just as he was about to answer. He ended up just walking outside with the call. Honestly I forgot how long I was waiting for, I ended up just going back to my room.*

*I ended up falling asleep, waking up to the next morning. Day 7 of her 8 day trip. I walked downstairs to the smell of bacon and pancakes. It’s a little late for him to be home, so I could tell he called out of work again. At this point I was feeling pretty uncomfortable. But I didn’t want to ask anymore questions…*

*As soon as my dad saw me, he handed me a plate of food, then hugged me tight.*

***“You know, with my age and all.. you only have a few summers left with your old man. You should spend more time out of that room of yours.”***

*He backed away from the hug and just looked at me, I think he was expecting me to say something but I had no clue what to say to that, especially with what’s been going on. He put on the second part of the movie we were watching before, and asked if I’d watch it with him. I of course did, I mean after what he said it honestly made me sad thinking of losing him.*

*He held me close, and kept occasionally glancing over and just looking at me. He ended up even sweeping my hair behind my ears and saying*

***“You’ve always looked like your mom lils, so beautiful”***

*He seemed almost like he wanted to cry.. the same way Amber was before she left. I worked up the courage to just say*

*“dad.. I need you to tell me what’s going on..”*

***“Nothing sweetheart, I’m just gonna miss you when I’m gone you know? My only child… my only baby”***

*Okay. Something was definitely going on now. This isn’t something I could just ignore anymore. I set the plate down on the table, and just left. I went all the way to my friend D’s house. I didn’t bother explaining what was going on, just in case I truly was the one crazy here. We ended up just watching some YouTube, going down the Minecraft ARG rabbit holes. Which.. is actually really disturbing. But I ended up falling asleep.*

*I woke up to my phone blaring my usual “call me by your name”soundtrack ringtone, which was peaceful until I read the name “dado <3” on the screen.*

*I answered.*

***“Hey babygirl, your mom just came home. I need you to come help us unload the car.”***

*He seemed like nothing even happened and calm. That was until I was about to say something, and I heard what sounded like the front door being closed in the background of the phone call.*

***“Lily listen, she’s inside right now. I need you to stay there and not come home. Listen to me lily, please. I love you.”***

*The phone then cut off.*

*What the hell was that? Why did he say that? He just told me to come and help and … and now he doesn’t even want me home? No.. if Amber is behind my dad acting this way, then I need to get her away from him.*
