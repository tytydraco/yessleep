It was supposed to be a peaceful retreat. After months of burnout, endless meetings, and city noise, Alex had planned a getaway to Europe a trip into the heart of a forgotten countryside. The brochure showed serene landscapes, rustic cottages, and charming cobblestone paths, untouched by modern life. It was perfect or so Alex thought.

The journey started innocuously enough. A plane ride, then a train that snaked through green valleys and rolling hills. But it was the last leg—a two-hour bus ride to a village so remote it didn’t even appear on most maps that hinted something wasn’t quite right. The bus driver, an old man with a face weathered by time, looked surprised when Alex mentioned the village’s name. He asked twice to be sure, then shrugged, muttering something under his breath that Alex couldn’t make out.

The road narrowed as they approached the village. Trees lined either side, growing so close together their branches intertwined, blocking out most of the sunlight. The bus stopped at the edge of the village, and Alex was the only passenger to disembark. The driver simply nodded, eyes filled with quiet concern, before driving off into the distance, leaving Alex standing alone.

The village, at first glance, seemed quaint, exactly like the photos a place frozen in time. But the air was still, unnaturally so, as if the wind itself avoided this place. The few villagers Alex saw moved sluggishly, their eyes downcast, as though weighed down by an invisible burden. They never smiled. Never waved. Just stared from behind half-closed shutters or through the cracks in old wooden doors.

Alex tried to shake off the uneasy feeling and headed to the small inn. The innkeeper, a gaunt man with hollow cheeks and a distant gaze, barely spoke as he handed over a room key. His hand trembled when Alex mentioned staying for a week.

The first night, Alex awoke to the sound of faint whispering just outside the window. At first, it seemed like wind through the trees, but the whispers grew louder, more insistent. Alex rose, peeking through the curtains, but saw only shadows moving in the mist that now clung to the village like a living thing.

The next morning, the whispers were gone, but the village had an even more eerie silence. The villagers avoided Alex entirely, heads bowed, shuffling past like ghosts of their former selves. Every attempt at conversation was met with awkward pauses or a hurried retreat.

By the third day, the whispers returned this time louder and closer, as if they were inside the room. The old innkeeper refused to acknowledge Alex’s growing panic, simply muttering, “It’s the village… It chooses…”

That night, unable to sleep, Alex decided to leave. The feeling of dread had grown unbearable. But the road out of the village seemed different twisting, looping, leading back into the heart of the village no matter which direction Alex took. Hours passed in a frantic haze of running and confusion until finally, exhausted and disoriented, Alex collapsed near the village’s old chapel.

It was then that the villagers emerged. Their faces gaunt, eyes hollow, they encircled Alex, their lips moving in unison, whispering ancient words in a language Alex had never heard. The mist thickened, swirling around them like a living entity. There was no escape, no way out.

Just as the cold tendrils of the mist reached for Alex’s skin, there was a blinding flash of light. When Alex awoke, it was morning. The villagers were gone. The chapel stood silent, abandoned, as if no one had set foot in it for years.

The village, once seemingly alive, was now nothing but a ruin. The bus stop where Alex had been dropped off was no longer there. There was no sign of the inn, no sign of the people only the stillness of a place long forgotten by time.

Weak and terrified, Alex stumbled out of the village, following what seemed like a faint trail, only to be found hours later by a wandering shepherd. The man looked at Alex with wide eyes when he heard where Alex had come from.

“That village,” he whispered, crossing himself. “It disappeared over fifty years ago.”
