I keep waking up with strange markings. They are scattered across my body. I have tried staying awake, I have tried recording my room throughout the night, I have tried everything I could think of. The footage keeps corrupting, the audio is static slop, and just useless.

The first one came about a month ago, now. I woke up to find a pumpkin shaped indent across my right pec. After rubbing the sleep from my eyes, I poked at the strange shape. It stung something fierce.

I rushed to the bathroom, inspecting myself in the mirror. I poked at the cut, and it was still painful. There was no scab, no bleeding, no anything. Just a gaping hole in my chest that stung like hand sanitizer in a paper cut. Except the paper cut was pumpkin shaped and massive. It felt surreal, like someone would hop out from the shadows and announce I was being pranked. This was just plain weird.

I rushed through my apartment, noting nothing out of the ordinary. The front door was still locked, the alarm was still engaged. Paranoid as I was, I wasted no time and dialed the police.

I walked behind the two officers as they inspected my rooms. They noted nothing out of the ordinary, aside from the hole on my chest. I felt anger swell up, but fought it down as they gave me the “don't waste our time, call us only for emergencies” spiel, before leaving me to my own devices.

I knocked on the neighboring apartment door. Maybe they might’ve heard or seen something?

“Hu-hello?” A timid woman answered the door, only opening the door a crack.

“Can I like, come in or something? I don't feel safe in my apartment,” I asked, chewing my lower lip. Either she was too naive, or she could sense the seriousness in my request. She undid the lock and let me in.

“Look, I don't know how or why or what, but something stole a chunk of my flesh!” I spat, pacing back and forth.

The short haired woman sat quietly, watching. Her face remained blank, giving very little for me to make of it. “What did it take, exactly?” She prodded, volume barely above a whisper. Her lips twitched slightly, maybe unnerved?

“It cut out a chunk of my skin! Here, look-” I paused, refraining from pulling up mt shirt to show off the odd wound.

“Thanks for not, um, yknow,” she said, awkwardly.

“Yeah… but anyways. Did you hear or see anything last night?”

She shook her head, frowning slightly. “Afraid not, sorry. I'll let you know if I notice anything unusual.”

The next few weeks came and passed. Every day, a spot was carved into my flesh. One was shaped like a cartoon ghost. Another was in the shape of a Christmas tree. They were all shaped like cookie cutters.

Every day, I wake up to another one. I don't know how long until whatever is stealing my flesh, steals more. I don't know how to stop it. Hell, I don't even know what it's using my flesh for.

The woman next door hasn't gotten back to me. The police weren't helpful. The first few have not showed any signs of closing nor healing. I am slowly disappearing into cookie cutter shapes and I see no end in send. Someone, please save me.
