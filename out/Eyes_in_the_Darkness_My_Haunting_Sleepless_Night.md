Hey everyone,  
I've never been one to believe in the supernatural, but something recently happened to me that defies any logical explanation. I just need to get this off my chest, and perhaps you guys can help make sense of it.  
For starters, I've been grappling with some serious insomnia lately. It's been an ongoing battle, but a couple of days ago, I hit a new low - I was awake for over 30+ hours straight. As you can imagine, the lack of sleep started playing severe tricks on my mind. Have you ever seen Salvador Dali's paintings? They're all surreal, twisted landscapes that distort reality. That's exactly what started happening in my head. Dark, demonic faces and scenes began flashing before my eyes every time I started to drift off into a restless slumber.  
Finally, sleep took over, but it wasn't the restful escape I desperately needed. Instead, I found myself trapped in this bizarre, nightmarish dream. It was as if I had been transported into another world, one that felt far too tangible and real to be simply a product of my imagination. The weirdest part was this recurring sensation of brushing against things - unseen entities, cold walls, you name it. Each time it happened, it grew more aggressive, like invisible hands shoving me relentlessly.  
The last shove felt terrifyingly real, jolting me awake. However, waking up didn't bring any sense of relief. My room was engulfed in pitch-black darkness, darker than I'd ever experienced. I was paralyzed, unable to move a muscle, and the silence around me was suffocating. I couldn't even hear the familiar sound of my dog, who always sleeps by my bed, offering a comforting presence.  
Then, in the heart of that overwhelming darkness, I saw it. When my eyes adjusted to the gloom, I noticed a face staring down at me from the ceiling. Its eyes were glowing in the dark, unblinking, just watching me with an intense, eerie gaze. The fear that gripped me was unlike anything I had ever felt. I was frozen, staring back at this... entity, this inexplicable apparition.  
I don't know how long we stayed in that chilling standoff. It felt like hours were stretching into an endless night, but it could have been mere minutes. Eventually, as the first light of dawn began to creep into my room, the face gradually faded away with the receding shadows.  
I'm at a loss as to what to make of this experience. Was it merely a hallucination, a byproduct of my severe lack of sleep? Or did I somehow glimpse into something beyond our understanding, something otherworldly? Since that night, my sleep has been fraught with anxiety. Every time the lights go out, I find myself staring apprehensively at the ceiling, half expecting those haunting eyes to reappear.  
Thank you for reading this. If anyone has experienced anything similar or has any insights into what this could be, please let me know. I'm desperately seeking answers and struggling to find peace in the darkness of night.
