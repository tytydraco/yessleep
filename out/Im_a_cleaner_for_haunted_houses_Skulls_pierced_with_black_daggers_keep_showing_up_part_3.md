Obizuth grinned like a corpse as hundreds of candles and oil lamps burned all throughout the mansion’s massive basement. I quickly flicked off my flashlight, not wanting to draw any attention to myself. Both Big George and Obizuth had been totally consumed by whatever foul black magic ritual they were performing and, thank God, hadn’t noticed me.

  
The black, twitching appendages ascending out of her scalp started to whip through the air as Big George pushed the dying boy’s body forwards. The boy’s legs buckled. He fell forwards, smacking his head against the concrete floor with a dull cracking sound.  


The demonic female knelt forwards, the chains rattling and clanking together. The skull she wore around her neck grinned up at me as it swung in wide arcs. She reached forwards with an inhumanly long arm. I could see the white bones of her hands peeking out through deep sores eaten into her flesh.  


The boy continued to choke on his own blood, gurgling as his breathing slowed. His final breaths started to come erratically. Obizuth flipped him over. His dilated, sightless eyes stared up into her obsidian ones as his heart furiously pumped his remaining life’s essence onto the cold, gray concrete below.  


The strange spiked appendages growing out of her head reached down and stroked the boy’s corpse-white cheek lovingly. She grinned, showing off a mouth filled with needles. Thousands of them gleamed like metal. Her gray lips pulled back, revealing blackened gums.  


“Oh, what a beautiful tribute,” she croaked in a voice that sounded like she had been gargling with razor blades. “So young and innocent. So sinless…” Her voice stretched out the last word, hissing like a snake. The boy’s final death gasp came after a long period of him not breathing. I heard a shuddering exhale, wet with the slick blood that bubbled from the deep slash across his neck.  


As that hissing sound continued, the spider leg appendages twisting out of her head tightened around the boy’s face and body. Obizuth’s eyes seemed to glow with an inner light as the hissing grew louder and more insistent. It escalated into a deafening cacophony. I put my hands over my ears. I think I might have screamed, but I couldn’t hear anything above the demonic roar coming from this eldritch abomination.  


The boy’s dilated pupils began to bubble with an interior white light. Like a stream overflowing its banks, I saw the light pulse and rise before falling into his eyes again. Obizuth’s demonic eyes streamed a dark purple effulgence that made everything in the room look like it was illuminated by a black light. Her appendages had begun to bite deeply into the dead boy’s skin, causing rivulets of blood to stream down from dozens of wounds.  


Like a viper rising out of a basket, the light formed into a thread. Slowly, almost lazily, it rose towards Obizuth’s open, grinning mouth. She kept hissing as the boy’s consciousness or soul or whatever it was disappeared behind her mouthful of needles and into her enormous body. Then the demonic sound abruptly cut off. Her mouth snapped shut with a faint metallic clang.  


“Your tribute is worthy,” Obizuth growled in a deep voice filled with pleasure and satisfaction. “Step forward and accept your ascension to divinity, Acolyte. You are now a master of the Left-Hand Path.” With an arrogant half-smile, Big George drew nearer the abomination. She wrapped her spider-like appendages around his face. The pointed ends caressed his cheek lightly. He didn’t flinch or draw away. Instead, he only continued to emanate his cryptic smile.  


Then the pointed tips bit deeply into his skin. His mouth opened in a silent scream. I watched in horror as the appendages pulsed with peristalsis. They looked like intestines moving food. Big George’s body started to glow as some dark, fetid liquid gushed from the hollow ends of the demonic appendages into his flesh. Some of it flowed from his bleeding wounds, mixing with his bright red blood as it dripped onto the floor below.  


His face lit up like a jack-o-lantern as his eyes shone with the same purplish light that Obizuth had emanated during the tribute ritual. I noticed with horror that the skull with the black dagger shoved through its crown had also started to glow, sending out cascades of blinding violet beams.  


Something gripped my heart like a clenching fist. I felt a suffocating sense of rising panic and dread. I knew I needed to stop this Satanic ritual before completion. If Big George truly became immortal and had demons and countless enormous monsters at his disposal…   


I shuddered at the very thought of what that could mean for my town, my state or even the world.  


Without stopping to think about what I was doing, I reached for the pistol holstered around my waist. I had loaded it with real bullets, not the salt and iron ones Big George had given me. I didn’t know if that would turn out to be a wise decision or a fatal one.  


With sweaty hands, I raised the gun, pointed at Big George and fired.  


\*\*\*  


The next thing I remember, the room seemed to be exploding with light. Blinding white mixed with twisting violet as it strobed violently. I ran back up the stairs as a whooshing sound followed me and then a deafening, inhuman shriek.  


“You killed him!” Obizuth screamed in a voice like thunder. “You worm, I’ll strip the meat from your bones.” The house shook. Xavier and Katrina ran towards me, their faces chalk-white and their mouths open. They screamed something, but I couldn’t hear it over the roaring of the demon below. Xavier had his gun out. I saw Katrina holding something in her hand, clenched tightly in her fist, but I didn’t know it was. 


Finally, the roaring from below stopped. I heard with dread and horror what Xavier had screamed at me.  


“We’re surrounded!” he said. “The doors are all blocked.” As if to emphasize his point, I heard a window smashing followed by a sound of splintering wood coming from both the front and back of the house. Heavy footsteps started to ascend the basement stairs. The boards of the stairs screamed with a shriek of tortured wood under the weight of the behemoth. My heart felt like it would explode in my chest. I had killed Big George before he could complete the final ritual apparently, but I still felt like I had gone from the frying pan into the fire.  


Obizuth reached the top of the stairs. Her massive frame tried to squeeze through the threshold of the door like a trapdoor spider emerging from its tunnel. She gave a twisted, lunatic laugh.  


“I’ll rip you limb from limb,” she screamed as she ripped one arm out of the door. The appendages writhing on the top of her head slid through behind her. We met eyes for a brief moment. She had eyes like a snake, slitted and predatory. The irises shone with a silvery gleam.   


We had all started to run without needing to say anything. Xavier and Katrina tore through the kitchen and towards the elegant stairway in the front chamber. I followed close behind, the gun still clenched in my hand. I kept looking back, ready to shoot, but Obizuth was still pulling herself through the solid framework of the threshold. I heard boards snapping and walls shaking, and I figured we only had seconds to hide.  


\*\*\*  


The mansion’s hallways loomed before us. We ran down a hall randomly, up a set of spiraling side steps to the third floor and looked for somewhere to barricade ourselves in and come up with a plan. I needed time to think. Big George was dead, so I certainly wasn’t getting any more information from him. I wondered why he had wanted us to bring a witch when her powers might be used against him and the horde of demons he had brought to this place. I would find the answer soon enough.  


We found a room with old oak tables and chairs piled up on one wall. A giant oval window looked out onto the floating pyramid nearby. We quietly closed and locked the door before starting to stack tables and chairs in front of it, wedging one chair under the handle to try to add some support to the ersatz barricade.  


\*\*\*  


We gathered close, all of us in a high state of excitement. I saw death flashing before my eyes. I looked out the window and saw more dark red abominations streaming out of the pyramid. It was the first moment of peace we had. Katrina quickly started speaking, vomiting out the words as fast as she could as if she feared attack at any moment.  


“We need to stop the ritual as soon as possible,” she said. “He has opened a gateway to Naraka, but the door is still mostly closed. I have seen references to this ritual in an ancient medieval book on the black arts written by the Mad Arab. They say he sold his soul and wrote a ten-thousand page volume called ‘The Eldritch Tome’ in a single night with all of the foulest rites and rituals poured into it. I have never actually seen a copy of it, but I’ve seen it referenced in other books. Big George must have somehow gotten hold of it.  


“The ritual to open the doorway to Naraka usually ends up with the blood of a witch being poured into the pit below the pyramid. Once the last of her blood gets drained from her body, then the door will be permanently opened, and demons will flood into this world at will.”  


“What are we supposed to do?” Xavier asked. “We’re just three people, and only two of us even have guns.”  


“I have some things that may be useful in my satchel, if we need to…” she started to say when a slamming boom shook the wall. I walked over to the window, not seeing anything nearby that could have made the noise. Then I looked straight down and saw it.  


The creature had dangling clumps of rotted black hair over its face. It climbed up the wooden wall like a mountaineer, punching its skeletal claws into the wood over and over, each crater making a splintering crack echo through the room. Its face didn’t look up at us, which somehow made it even worse. The top of its head had split open with squirming larvae eating their way through its skin. It seemed to shiver with nervous energy, a pale, white abomination from an acid fiend’s worst nightmare rising up to meet us.  


“Oh God,” Xavier said, stumbling back from the window. He looked like he was about to pass out.  


“Listen to me!” Katrina whisper shouted. “We need to get to the basement and take the sacrificial dagger out of the skull. That is the nexus of power holding all of this together.” She shook her head. “Big George must have been working on something like this for many years. I can’t imagine the amount of people he would have had to kill to…”   


A shattering cacophony interrupted her. Looking back towards the window, I saw the demonic figure hovering outside the window it had just broken. It tried to slither through, tearing chunks of its decaying flesh off on the sharp tips of broken glass. 


Its hair, black and squirming with larvae, reached down to its waist and covered its face and chest. But as it pressed its bleeding body into the broken window, its hair pulled back from its face for a moment, and I saw a female visage straight from Hell.  


She had garish dark stitches running across her face like intersecting railroad tracks. They held the wet, squirming flesh loosely to the dark red metallic bones gleaming underneath. She grinned, showing a mouthful of dark crimson needles the same color as the pyramid.   


She pulled herself through the window like a tick burrowing into skin, ripping off pieces of pale, naked flesh on the jagged pieces of glass. Dark blood streamed from many wounds, but she didn’t seem to care in the slightest.  


“Give… me… the witch…” she hissed, pulling herself up straight. She looked at us with eyes as empty as an abyss. “I… smell… her blood…” Katrina grabbed her chest, hyperventilating and gasping as a panicked, anxious expression overtook her features.   


The demon’s head ratcheted as if she had gears in her neck, moving in a blur of movement before stopping to look at each of us in turn. Her grin spread across her face as her mouth fell open. Like a snake unhinging its jaw, I watched her mandible fall down below her neck. There was a rending sound as the stitched-up flesh across her cheeks tore from ear to ear. The thousands of sharp needles in that gaping, grinning maw glistened as she ran forward toward Katrina.  


Xavier took the Weaver stance, raising his pistol and straightening his arms. With a booming crack like a shout from God, he fired over and over, first hitting the abomination’s right leg. Her kneecap exploded in a shower of bone fragments and rotten, gray flesh. Her leg collapsed underneath its weight, snapping with a sound like a ceramic pot shattering.   


She continued to crawl forward without any sign of pain, leaving streaks of cold, clotted blood squirming with countless worms on the hardwood floor behind her as she went. She gnashed her needle-sharp teeth together, giving a metallic clattering as she advanced, her eyes still fixed on the witch with a supernatural intensity. She started to gnash her teeth so fast that I saw needles breaking off.  


“Your blood…” she hissed again, spitting needles and dark blood. She swiped at Katrina’s leg with a clawed hand, wrapping it tight around her calf. Pieces of sharp bone poked out through the rotted tips of her fingers. With a squeal of pain, Katrina jumped back, but the hand held on.  


I walked forward, pressing the barrel of the gun directly to the back of the abomination’s head. I stepped on her back, pushing her to the floor then emptied the entire clip into her skull.  


Her head exploded in a splash of rotting gore. Sharp needles and fragments of red bone splattered back on me. Her throat gurgled in a dying explosion of breath, her claws still tightly wrapped around Katrina’s leg, the fingers curled up like a dead spider. Rivulets of blood streamed down Katrina’s leg.  


“Oh God, she’s still got me,” Katrina shrieked, panic marring her face. She looked like she might pass out at any moment. She looked down at the mutilated nightmarish monstrosity still clutching her flesh and wavered on her feet. I ran over to help. Xavier circled around the other side, examining the hand. We tried prying the fingers open, but the hand held tightly shut like the fingers of a marble statue.   


“Shit man,” he said, sweating heavily. He nervously tried prying off one finger at a time. With a sound like bones shattering, he finally worked one finger loose. After a few more seconds, he cracked another open and, finger by finger, eventually loosened the whole hand. The tips had been embedded deeply in the layers of fat and muscle of Katrina’s leg, but luckily they hadn’t gone deep enough to puncture any major blood vessels. They pulled out of her skin with a wet, sucking sound.  


“We need to get out of here. Big George is dead. I can’t believe the whole time he was leading us here as sacrifices,” Xavier said.  


“Especially me,” Katrina said, and as if the universe had a sense of humor, at that moment the windows went dark. I looked outside to see swarms of the flying monstrosities who had earlier emerged from the pyramid hovering right outside the window. Like a cross between a spider, a dragonfly and a scorpion, they pressed against the glass with their eerily human faces at us, their iridescent, insectile wings furiously beating and blocking out the light. With faces like those of hairless mutated children, they examined us, their heads all twisting eerily towards Katrina like predators smelling prey. Their mouths opened, revealing countless needle teeth that gnashed furiously.   


Their large stingers flexed with enormous bulging muscles, the sharp balls ending in  curving, needle-like points. I saw with some consternation that the tips of their stingers constantly emitted drops of ruby-red venom. Like drops of blood dripping down, the crimson poison ran down their hard red exoskeletons.  


I had loaded some of the bullets Big George had given us into the pistol, deciding to see if they would work. If he had wanted us alive as extra tributes, then he might have given us an actually effective means of repelling these demons so that we could survive long enough to fulfill his evil plan.  


I heard an angry, predatory roaring from the floor below us. It was the voice of Obizuth, a choked, predatory growl that made her sound as if she had been gargling with sulfuric acid. Her voice came out like a slowed-down recording, stretching out and vibrating the floor.  


“The witch… give me the witch, you worthless vermin… I can smell her blood… it smells sweet… so close…”   


Without warning, one of the creatures took advantage of the distraction and flew in through the window. Its head ratcheted towards Katrina, its body twitching with excitement. Then it wrapped its muscular tail around her, keeping the writhing, dripping stinger away from her skin. She screamed, beating her fists against its hard crimson shell. Before I could even raise the gun, it flitted back toward the window in a blur of motion.  


“Oh shit!” Xavier screamed, running after Katrina. I felt frozen solid for an endless moment as the abomination jumped, Katrina’s face still looking backwards towards me with a pleading expression in her terror-stricken eyes. Its wings fluttered with a sound like helicopter blades slicing the air. In a graceful, curving arc, it flew through the room and escaped outside the shattered window with Katrina still wrapped tightly in its tail. Her panicked shrieks quickly faded into the distance.   


“We can’t let it get away!” he continued yelling, his eyes as wide as dinner plates. I shook my head.  


“You need to go to the basement and dismantle the skull holding this ritual together,” I said quickly. Another one of the freakish flying scorpions had begun to crawl through the window like some kind of demented vole emerging from its burrow. I shot at it with the salt-and-iron bullet. It gave a very human scream, its face and exoskeleton starting to melt as if it had been sprayed with a corrosive acid. It fell to the ground, seizing and kicking, rolling on its back with its sharp, spidery legs kicking out. Xavier reloaded, running over and blowing the top of its fleshy, hairless head apart with a few point-blank shots from his pistol.   


“I can’t believe the salt-and-iron shit actually works somewhat,” Xavier said as more flying beasts smashed through windows. He reloaded and tried to keep them at bay. I ran to the barricade and began throwing chairs and tables aside.  


“I’m going to try to get Katrina back before she gets sacrificed,” I said. “You need to get to the basement and take the dagger out of the skull and stop all of this. At any cost. We’re all counting on you.” He nodded grimly. I ran out into the hallway, turning left. Xavier ran out behind me and headed towards the servant’s stairs. I glanced back, wondering if I would ever see him alive again.   


I fled towards the front door of the house and the massive stairway in the entrance chamber. I got as far as the end of the hallway and started turning when I ran into the first of the crawling abominations that swarmed all over the mansion.  


It looked like a giant centipede with thousands of long bristles that formed skittering legs the color of pale straw. Waves of motion rippled through the legs, propelling the abomination forwards in a blur. It had a mouth like a leech, a sucking, slimy circular hole with hundreds of triangular teeth spiraling in towards the center. Its enormous, black compound eyes glistened with a colorful sheen. There was no recognizable emotion in those eyes, no glint of compassion or understanding or anything human. They looked as blank and empty as the eyes of a mannequin.  


I had filled the pistol’s chamber with salt-and-iron bullets. With uncertainty in my heart as to how effective this would be, I raised the gun. The beast, nearly ten feet long and coming at me like a runaway train, gave a deep, throaty growl that vibrated the floor. As fast as I could, I pulled the trigger, emptying the entire chamber.  


The first bullets hit it in the face. Its flesh immediately began to drip and melt like candle wax, its insectile eyes bursting apart in a stream of blue blood the color of antifreeze. And yet its legs continued to skitter towards me even as it gave a long, bubbling hiss. Its mouth continued to suck at the air as if it could already sense the tasty human blood that would flow into its alien mouth.  


I tried to sideswipe it as its heavy body thudded to the ground and skidded across the hallway towards me. Even without eyes, its dying body seemed to sense my presence, perhaps feeling the vibrations or smelling me. Its body slid into an S-shape, its sucker coming straight for my chest. I was out of bullets and cringed back.  


Inches away, it exhaled a long, shuddering breath and finally collapsed.  


\*\*\*  


I sprinted through the opening, savoring the few moments of peace. I heard crashing and shattering coming from all around the house. There was a scream of tortured wood on the first floor, and I heard glass smashing. Something laughed like a hyena, an inhuman, high-pitched cackle that sent shivers down my spine. For a moment, I wondered who drew the short straw on this one- me or Xavier.  


I reached the sprawling, elegant staircase, standing on the top. It was wide enough to drive two cars down it with room to spare. The front door stood, one door hanging off its hinges at a 45 degree angle, the other splayed out on the floor.  


From the kitchen on the first floor, I heard rapid gunfire. Xavier screamed. He sounded like he was either laughing or crying, or maybe both.  


“Come get it, fuckers!” he shrieked in a lunatic voice. “Come fucking get it! I’m not afraid to die!”  


I ran out the door, the blinding sun staring down at me like a burning eye. As my vision adjusted, I looked over at the pyramid. Only a few hundred feet away now, but a few hundred feet had never seemed so far.  


\*\*\*  


I sprinted across the garden, seeing strange, burrowing trails of piled dirt running in random curving lines under the earth. Something about that caused me to shiver. Creatures flew over the trees and mansion by the dozen, circling and howling with inhuman cries.  


I heard Katrina’s terrified voice. Looking through the trees, I saw her, still held tightly in the flying abomination’s thick tail. Obizuth walked calmly along the dirt trail towards Katrina, giving her a motherly smile.  


“Do not feel bad, girl,” Obizuth hissed in a serpentine voice. “Your blood will forever join Naraka and Earth together as one. You are the most important living person on this world right now. You will bring the ancient ones out, and we will take our rightful places as the rulers of these worthless masses of life.”  


Ozibuth walked towards Katrina and the surrounding creatures. I saw a long sacrificial dagger held in her hand. The handle looked like it had been carved from bone. The finely-honed obsidian blade gleamed black in the ruby-red glow of the light emanating from under the pyramid.  


“Please, don’t do this,” Katrina pleaded. “So many people will die.” Obizuth laughed, a sound like the tortured grinding of metal. Obizuth only grinned wider, raising the dagger and walking forward.  


I sprinted towards them as silently as I could. I had put a new magazine in the pistol already, this time with real bullets. I fired at Obizuth’s arm holding the dagger.  


The shot went wild, hitting a tree next to her head and causing splinters and smoke to rain down on Obizuth. Without surprise, she turned, the gray, dead flesh of her face stretching tight as her expression formed into a scowl.  


“You will join her in eternal agony for that,” Obizuth shrieked as a torrent of creatures poured towards me. Something reached down from under the soil and grabbed my ankle. I looked down, seeing the clotted black hair of another one of those things that had attacked us in the mansion. Her hands were skeletal, the flesh worn down to the bone in most spots. They were smeared with blood and covered in dirt and grime.  


I shot into the ground and felt the hand release me. But as I looked up, a massive tail wrapped around my body. I felt myself being lifted up. The flying scorpion creature jumped into the air with a shrill flutter of its wings. My stomach dropped as we rose a dozen stories and then fell back to the ground in a graceful arc. It brought me down in front of Obizuth’s pleased face.   


I still had a few shots left. I raised the pistol and fired at the leader of this nightmare.  


The first bullet shattered her ankle. She fell with a grunt, her lips pulling apart in a predatory growl, the chains wrapped around her body tinkling like wind chimes. I aimed the second shot at the creature holding Katrina. It burst through its face with a shower of blue blood.  


As rapidly as I could, I turned the pistol to the one holding me and fired. It smashed into its back along the length of its spine. Its tail began twitching and seizing. I fell hard as it dropped me. I saw the vicious stinger swinging inches in front of my face. Crawling away, I knew I was a goner. I tried to reload as I crawled, but more cold hands reached up from the earth and grabbed me. The clip fell from my numb fingers.  


I reached where Katrina lay on the ground, shocked and gasping. She had fallen hard when the beast released her and it had apparently knocked the wind out of her.  


“I’m here,” I said, grabbing her hand and giving it a gentle squeeze. “I’m here, Katrina. At least you won’t die alone. I’ll stay with you until the end.” She nodded, her face pale and sad.  


I noticed the pyramid floated above a bottomless pit in the earth that slowly belched thin wisps of smoke. I looked down for a moment and saw a scene that will give me nightmares for as long as I live.  


It was like looking down through a telescope into another world. Rocky cliffs dozens of stories high towered over flat, lifeless stone roads. Everything burned with a violent intensity. Blue flames shot out of the ground and black smoke rushed up into the air. The smell of scorched flesh and smoke was overwhelming.  


Thousands of people rushed in different directions, burning and screaming. Their skin fell off in strips and their bodies blackened, but by the time they had taken the next step, they would be fully healed.  


Countless creatures from a nightmare surrounded them, ripping into their flesh, grabbing them from the air and dragging them under the ground. Yet no matter how many disappeared or got taken away, more of these naked, emaciated people would come in to fill their place, sprinting for their lives in every possible direction yet finding no solace. I saw some people trampled underfoot, their crying, screaming faces pressed hard against the flaming ground as thousands of bare feet ran over them.  


“It’s Hell,” I whispered, knowing the truth. “Naraka is Hell.” Katrina only nodded.  


\*\*\*  


Obizuth rose to her feet, her shattered leg already healing. More of the creatures swarmed around her. Dozens of the women with the skull faces and clotted, black hair climbed out of the pit, their grinning skulls showing off their sharp needle teeth.  


They grabbed at us with cold hands, the loose skin of their hands nearly falling off the bones. I cringed, my skin shivering. They pinned our arms behind our backs and pulled our heads back as Obizuth came over in a fury.  


“You will die slowly,” she said. “I will skin you alive before I cut your throats. So much the better for the ritual. The pyramid feeds on agony. Know only that all the ones you know and love will follow you soon. Perhaps that will give you some solace.” She gave us a twisted grin, the needles in her mouth glistening.  


Obizuth’s hand shot out like a snake grabbing a mouse. With a quick slice, she took off Katrina’s left pinky finger in the space of a moment. Katrina didn’t even cry out, simply looking down with a stunned expression. Bright red blood spurted from the wound.  


Then Obizuth put the knife to Katrina’s chest, deciding to start the skinning.  


In an adrenaline-fueled spike, Katrina ripped her right arm free. I saw she still had her hand clenched tightly. In a blur, she threw a shower of something at Obizuth’s face. Obizuth screamed, pulling back. The knife fell out of her skeletal hands. Her mouth opened inhumanly wide, her scream shrieking across the forest like a steam-whistle.   


She looked up at us. I saw her face melting, pieces of the loose, gray skin sliding off to show the metallic, red bones underneath. But Katrina had used her one shot. Obizuth shook with outrage, one of her eyes dripping out of its sockets. I saw thick granules of salt, dull shreds of iron and sharp pieces of silver embedded in her skin.  


Her other eye focused on Katrina with a cold fury.  



“You will pay for that, witch,” she said, breathing hard. She started to come forwards again, looking even more nightmarish than before. But she was cut off by a deep, roaring sound that vibrated the earth under my feet.  


Then the earth trembled as in an earthquake, sending the creatures falling over. Obizuth stayed on her feet, wavering like a sailor on a ship. Her eyes went wide. The creatures all around us began howling and shrieking in tones of fear and panic. They started rushing back towards into the pyramid or fleeing to the pit beneath it. The pyramid had started to descend with a deafening cacophony. As it lowered into the pit of fire and smoke and tortured souls, the hands released me.  


“No…” Obizuth said, falling to her knees. She began to crawl towards the pyramid. She reached the edge and pulled herself over, tumbling down into the void below. With a jumble of inhumanly long, rotted legs and arms, she fell and was gone.  


Within the space of a minute, we found ourselves alone. The earth continued to shake as the tip of the pyramid disappeared beneath the surface. The soil started to fill in the hole on its own, as if an imaginary hourglass had been overturned.  


Soon, the spot where Hell had been unleashed looked like nothing more than a massive dirt square. We were alone.   


“Are… are we dead?” I asked, hyperventilating and stuttering. “What is this?”  


“No!” Katrina said enthusiastically. “No, someone must have stopped the ritual.” Her eyes widened. “Xavier.”  


We sprinted towards the house. Panic and relief fought in my chest. What about Xavier? If he had stopped it, he must still be alive, right?  


\*\*\*  


I found Xavier’s swollen, green body in the basement. A nightmarish, fifteen-foot long snake had wrapped around his torso and sunk its giant fangs into his leg. At his feet lay the skull, the jaw bone broken off and teeth scattered across the floor like litter on a sidewalk.  


In his right hand, he still held the black ritual dagger tightly. Its blade had bit deeply through the snake’s eye and into its brain.  


They had died together, hugging like two lovers who just carried out a suicide pact.  


\*\*\*  


As I left his funeral later that month, I had the Grateful Dead blasting on my car. I listened to the lyrics with sadness. They reminded me of Xavier. 

 
“Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride,  
Hot as a pistol but cool inside.  
Going where the wind don’t blow so strange,  
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain.  
Lost one round but the price wasn’t anything.  
A knife in the back and more of the same.  


“Like a steam locomotive,  
Rolling down the track,  
He’s gone,  
He’s gone,  
And nothing’s going to bring him back.”  


I thought of his swollen body, the expression of purpose eternally frozen on his dying face.  


And I knew that he was undoubtedly the best trainer a man could ever wish to have.
