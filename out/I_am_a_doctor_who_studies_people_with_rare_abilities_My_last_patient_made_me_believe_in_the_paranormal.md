The following passages are excerpts from two separate books. One of them is my personal progress notes on patients.

The other is my own journal. 

I executed both writings in an underground research facility based in Nevada. I am not permitted to disclose the location or name.  this is for fear of violating a non-disclosure agreement.

The job was routine once I filled it, and I found it easier than an emergency room for a multitude of reasons. The environment, although it resembled a nuclear fallout silo, was sterile and empty.  The laboratory equipment and machinery was all that filled it.

The place was also the size of three football fields. I was not alone. There were other doctors, nurses and staff of all kinds. They showed up to work as clueless as I was. None of us knew what the grand goal of our mission was. 

The only task made transparent to me was to study individuals with unique and rare abilities. Most of the studied were volunteers, some brought in against their will. 

Despite my employment at an ER beforehand, I had a doctoral degree in psychology. This boosted my resume to the forefront.  I would hate the government recruiter who selected me for the assignment.

Some patients had committed serious crimes.  This was their way of increasing the likelihood of getting a lighter sentence. 

I found a variety of abnormal skills in these humans. Some of the studied had eidetic memory. Others had the capacity for high-level chess. Others were elite mathematical geniuses.

There were a few crackpots who slipped through. They claimed to be able to do special things. Their severe delusions embarrassed them in the end.

One patient in particular struck me as different based on his booking.

Armed security carried him in cuffs. He hardly looked like a threat and was only fourteen years old or so. They brought him into a chamber which did not resemble any of the others.

His space had a candle-lit circle around a glass dome which emanated a crimson light.

The general supervisor of the premises, Arthur Kemble, stood in the threshold of the room. The boy would find it to be his prison. Kemble touched a pack of cigarettes in his pocket. 

Rumor was that Kemble had served in Operation Al-Fajr in Fallujah.  What rank he had attained was unknown since he rarely discussed his past. I could tell he was waiting to go the surface so he could light up.

“Who is the new test subject?” I asked.

“His name is Aidan.”

“Alright. Why does his medical unit look like a cave a witch would live in? And why did it take men with guns to bring him here?”

“Don’t ask questions you’re not paid to know,” Kemble said before he walked away. 

*

Later on in the night, they brought a tray of food to the boy. 

The server walked up to me after he had served the newcomer.

“He’s your patient?”

“Yes,” I said. 

“I don’t like the way his eyes look. I won’t go near him without a guard from now on.”

July 23rd, 2023

I would describe the new test subject as something of an anomaly. Today I walked into his cell, and found symbols penned in blood. Although I am only fluent in English, I pride myself on being somewhat well-read.  I recognized the letters from somewhere. Further research indicates the scribblings are of Greek origin. What is bizarre to me is how I have no idea where the blood came from. There were no noticeable lacerations. Nothing indicated he was self harming.

I asked the boy if he had any symptoms or pain. 

“I dug into the ground past concrete until my nails hit the dirt,” he said. “My hands hurt now.”

I found his claim absurd, until I did a close analysis of the ground. I discovered it was as though someone with a shovel had endeavored to escape. There is no possible way he could have caused such damage without a tool of some kind, but there were none seen.

“Okay,” I said. “What else are you feeling?”

“I need to take a shower soon, since this place is gross.”

“I will make sure they’ll have one available to you.”

We arranged one for him later. 

When he got out, one of the cleaners came to Kemble and told him that there was a noxious odor in the tub. 

Someone had somehow poured benzene onto the water proof mat. How he had access to that was beyond my understanding.

“I have other issues,” he said.

I inquired further and his answer shocked me.

“I keep having a nightmare where the moon crashes into my yard at my house. At the last second, though, a swarm of locusts lift it up.”

With all my research into the work of Carl Gustav Jung, I still could not read into the symbolism.

“I know how crazy it sounds,” he said. “May I ask who referred me to this place?”

His verbiage struck me as odd.

“They don’t tell me,” I said, and I could discern by the look on his face that was not the answer he wanted. 

“What is the reason I’m here?”

“That is unclear to me as well.”

“What do you do? Why do they have you in this place?”

“Because I try and understand people who are greater than most,” I said. “Kids and adults like you are uncommon. It is my job to figure out how you do what you are able to, whatever that may be, because it defies understanding.”

“Am I allowed to go outside?”

Although it required another escort with a guard, we were able to go above ground.

The night air was cold, and in the distance I could see Kemble puffing away. A vapor cloud surrounded him.

A kit fox scurried between scrub brush. A red streak was in its fur.

“I want an ant farm,” Aidan told me the next day. 

I had applied cardiac monitoring pads to his arms and chest to see the condition of his heart. Although his BPM was great, he did have a never-ending fever I could not bring down.

I gave him his ant farm. He squashed most all the bugs. He lived at the few who lived. It was a primal scream which reverberated through the hallways.

*

Kemble’s office was at the end of a black metal corridor.  The hallway was fluorescent with overhead lights that cast a greenish hue. I proceeded down it and walked in. His door was open. 

An atlas laid out on his desk, he looked up at me.  I observed thumb tacks pierced through paper crucifix’s at various points of the world.  The locations included Los Angeles, New York, Washington DC, Moscow, and Jerusalem. 

A print out of the dome of the rock lay by his computer screen. There was nothing personal in the chamber. Most people would decorate their space with portraits of loved ones. Kemble seemed to be a purist when it came to his profession.  He dedicated himself to blocking out any interference to his mindset.

The entire assembly was odd, but I did not wish to push for information on confidential matters. He folded the atlas and stuffed it away in his drawer after seeing me. 

“How is the investigation’s momentum with the new patient?” Kemble asked.

“That is why I came in here today. The only thing inexplicable about the child is how high his body temperature runs. It does so without physiological consequence. He does not have febrile seizures or brain damage. I administered acetaminophen and electrolytes. There is no marked improvement to his core heat. I did a full blood culture and even checked to see if he was in the throes of a stroke, but it turned out clear. I have antibiotics on standby, but there is not a hint of any infection. I am attempting to isolate the reason behind his pyrexia-tolerance without delirium.  I must theorize that that task is better suited for a geneticist. I am unsure if I can solve it with the resources given to me here.”

He leaned back and scratched his chin, contemplative but calm in his demeanor.

“Nature or nurture has made him a complex case,” I said, “but not the kind I am used to examining. I admit that his penchant for sociopathic behavior is definitely within my wheelhouse-“

“Explain,” Kemble said as he leaned back.  He was more relaxed and proud of himself for having interrupted me with a wide grin on his face. It was the first time I saw him smile.

“He enjoys inflicting cruelty and intimidating people in anyway he can. He also has perpetual nightmares of massive loss of life events. He views them with enjoyment rather than terror, although they would alarm most.”

“This does not sound unusual for a teenage boy. They all go through dark phases.”

“Even then,” I said, “I must confess he should be in a juvenile detention facility, not a research center such as this.”

“You should do what we ask of you and not try to reshape administrative policy. Keep your nose down and your mind busy. Do your job and nothing more. Now get out before you give me a hernia.”

I went to my bunk that night with a strong fantasy of breaking Kemble’s nose for his bullying tendencies. I knew that likely would not have ended well for me. I tried to remind myself that his job was to aim for compliance towards the orders of his higher ups, nothing more.

I fell into a slumber but awoke in the middle of the night. What caused the shift in my own sudden energy was unknown. 

Sleep deprived and ready to abandon it all, I still concocted an idea.

I told Aidan the next day to draw his next nightmare.

“Why?”

“It will give me a visual sense of what you’re seeing, through your own senses. You never know, there could be benefits we don’t expect. You might be a great illustrator who hasn’t figured it out yet.”

“My Mom was a painter.”

“Excellent. Where is she now?”

“Sone one murdered her in a tool shed. They never caught who did it.”

“Oh,” I said as I felt a lump form in the back of my throat. “What about your Dad, where is he?”

“They sent him to a prison somewhere in the Arctic. He lashed out and beat both of us before a neighbor told on him and he got into a lot of trouble. I’m glad I haven’t seen him, he was a bad guy. May I have a pen and paper?”

The one thing the facility was not short on was reams of paper and pens. I brought him the supplies.

It took him fifteen minutes before he completed a sketch. 

It was of a piano in an empty field. I am unsure if artistic talent is ever inherited, but whatever the woman who birthed had, he possessed.  

Inside the piano, near the sound board and cast iron plate, were piles of gore-strewn serpents.

I walked towards Aidan’s cell the next night. I found a few things out of place upon arrival within a matter of seconds. The red lights were verdant, and their glow stretched out along a much greater radius than before.

The server who delivered his food was unconscious near the doorway of the glass bubble. A rivulet of blood was around his mouth.

Aidan sat in the center. 

As I inched closer, I saw he was on his hands and knees as though he was genuflecting. Origami pieces he had crafted in the night surrounded him. Each one was in the shape of toads with wide mouths.

Redness covered his hands. He had used them to write letters on the ground. I could tell it was Koine Greek again, though I had to walk around to see them in their proper direction. I would translate the letters later in the evening.

It read:

I AM THE ANTI-CHRIST.
