We prepared a bag full of filming equipment:

Ghost detector

Dowsing rods

A toy for the children to play with


The old legends about the house on the hill had always intrigued us, and after hearing so many stories, we decided it was time to see for ourselves. We packed up everything we might need for a ghost hunt, each of us feeling the thrill mixed with a strange, underlying unease. We knew we were in for more than just a 20-minute adventure.

The drive out to the site felt unnervingly long, as if time itself were stretching the closer we got to our destination. The sun began to dip below the horizon, casting long, creeping shadows across the road. By the time we arrived, the world was bathed in a dim, unsettling twilight.

Once we got there, the place had eerie vibes, almost as if it were waiting for us. We parked at the base of the hill, the skeletal remains of the burnt house barely visible at the top. The wind was deathly still, and the silence was thick, broken only by the crunch of our footsteps on the gravel as we began our climb.

We walked up the hill, the looming presence of the ruined house growing larger with each step, almost as if it were drawing us in. There was something unnatural about the place; even the air felt different, heavy with a suffocating sense of dread.

As we reached the charred remains of the house, a strange coldness seeped into our bones, far too cold for a late summer evening. My breath fogged up, the temperature inexplicably dropping as we stepped closer to the ruins.

I pulled out the dowsing rods, my hands trembling slightly, though I couldn't tell if it was from the cold or the fear gnawing at my gut. The moment I held them out, the rods snapped together violently, pointing towards the heart of the ruined structure. The force was so strong it nearly knocked me off balance. My wife and her cousin gasped, their faces pale as they huddled closer together. The rods continued to pull, as if something unseen was guiding them.

It was then that I felt it— a presence, dark and ancient, watching us. The air grew thick with a foul stench, like something rotting deep within the earth. The toy we brought, meant as an offering to appease the spirits of the children, began to move on its own, rocking back and forth in the dirt with an eerie creak.

My heart pounded in my chest as I asked the first question, my voice barely above a whisper. "Is anyone here with us?"

The silence that followed was deafening, and just when I thought nothing would happen, a faint whisper brushed past my ear, so close that I could feel the breath of the words: "We never left..."

The presence of the children who had perished in the fire suddenly surrounded us, palpable, their tragic energy pressing in from all sides. The ghost detector in our bag lit up wildly, its sharp beeping echoing through the night as unseen hands tugged at our clothes, pulling us towards the smoldering remains of their forgotten lives.

I could feel them—small, cold hands grasping at my legs, a soft giggle that was more chilling than any scream echoing in the darkness behind me. I spun around, but there was nothing there. Just shadows dancing in the dark.

Panic surged through us, and we bolted, tripping over ourselves as we fled down the hill, the feeling of those icy fingers still clinging to our skin. We barely made it to the car, the engine roaring to life as we sped away, leaving the cursed hill behind.

I made a video documenting the whole experience, but even now, the memory of those voices haunts me. If you're curious—or brave—enough to see what we captured, check out my profile... but be warned, some things can never be unseen.
