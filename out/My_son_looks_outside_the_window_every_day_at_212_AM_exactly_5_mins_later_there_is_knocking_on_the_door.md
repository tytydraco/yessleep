It started about a month ago. I woke up in the middle of the night, thirsty as hell. As I stumbled to the kitchen for a glass of water, I noticed a sliver of light coming from Ethan's room. The door was cracked open, and I could see his small silhouette framed against the window.

"Ethan?" I called softly, pushing the door open. "What are you doing up, buddy?"

He didn't turn around. He just stood there, staring out into the darkness.

"Ethan?" I tried again, a little louder this time.

Finally, he looked at me, his eyes wide and unfocused. "Daddy, it's time," he said, his voice flat and emotionless.

A shiver ran down my spine. "Time for what, bud?"

But he didn't answer. Instead, he climbed back into bed and pulled the covers up to his chin. Within seconds, he was fast asleep.

I checked my phone. 2:12 AM. Weird, but kids do strange things sometimes, right? I tucked Ethan in and went back to bed, chalking it up to a random night terror or sleepwalking episode.

The next night, I woke up again around 2 AM. Call it parental instinct or just paranoia, but something made me check on Ethan. Sure enough, there he was at the window again. I checked my phone: 2:12 AM on the dot.

This time, I didn't say anything. I just watched him from the doorway. He stood there, perfectly still, for exactly five minutes. Then, just as I was about to intervene, a sound pierced the silence that made my skin crawl.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Three sharp raps on our front door.

Ethan didn't react. He just climbed back into bed like nothing had happened.

With my heart pounding in my chest, I crept downstairs and peered through the peephole. The porch light illuminated an empty stoop. No one was there.

I tried to convince myself it was just a coincidence. Maybe some drunk teenager playing a prank. But a nagging feeling in my gut told me something wasn't right.

For the next week, the same thing happened every single night. Ethan at the window at 2:12 AM. Knocking at 2:17 AM. No one at the door.

I tried talking to Ethan about it during the day, but he had no memory of getting up at night. He just looked at me with those big, innocent eyes and asked if we could have pancakes for breakfast.

I was starting to lose it. I wasn't sleeping. I couldn't focus at work. Every night, I'd sit on the stairs, watching Ethan's door, waiting for 2:12 AM with a mixture of dread and morbid curiosity.

One night, about ten days in, I decided to do something different. At 2:10 AM, I quietly entered Ethan's room and stood next to his bed. As the clock ticked over to 2:12, his eyes snapped open. He sat up, but when he saw me, he froze.

"Daddy," he whispered, "you shouldn't be here."

"Why not, buddy?" I asked, trying to keep my voice calm.

"Because," he said, his eyes darting to the window, "she's waiting."

My mouth went dry. "Who's waiting, Ethan?"

But before he could answer, the knocking started. Only this time, it wasn't coming from the front door.

It was coming from the other side of Ethan's bedroom window.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

The knocking stopped as suddenly as it had started. In the eerie silence that followed, I could hear my own ragged breathing and the frantic pounding of my heart.

"Ethan," I whispered, my voice trembling, "get away from the window. Now."

But my son didn't move. His eyes were fixed on something outside, something I couldn't see. Slowly, deliberately, he raised his small hand and pressed it against the glass.

That's when I saw it. A hand on the other side of the window, mirroring Ethan's. Long, skeletal fingers with blackened nails. The skin was pale and waxy, like that of a corpse left too long in water.

"Jesus Christ!" I yelled, lunging forward to grab Ethan. But as soon as my fingers touched his shoulder, he let out an ear-piercing scream that made me stagger backward.

The hand outside the window vanished, and Ethan collapsed onto the floor, his body convulsing violently. I scooped him up, my mind reeling with panic. As I turned to rush him out of the room, my eyes caught something that made me freeze in my tracks.

There, scratched into the window glass, were five words: "I'M COMING FOR HIM, JOHN."

A wave of dread washed over me. How the hell did it know my name?

I ran downstairs with Ethan in my arms, fumbling for my phone to call 911. But as soon as I hit the bottom step, every light in the house flickered and died. In the pitch darkness, I heard something that sent chills down my spine.

Scritch. Scritch. Scritch.

The sound of nails dragging across wood, coming from every direction at once.

"Daddy," Ethan whimpered, his small body trembling against mine, "she's inside now."

I sprinted for the front door, my free hand outstretched in the darkness. But when I grabbed the doorknob, it was ice cold and slick with something wet. I yanked my hand back, feeling warm liquid dripping down my wrist.

The coppery smell of blood filled my nostrils.

"You can't leave, John," a voice whispered, so close I could feel fetid breath on my neck. It sounded like Marie, but wrong. Like her voice was being forced through a throat full of gravel. "We're a family again."

"You're not Marie," I choked out, backing away. "My wife is dead."

A chilling laugh echoed through the house. "Dead? Oh, John. I'm so much more than dead."

Suddenly, the lights flickered back on. I blinked, momentarily blinded. When my vision cleared, I saw her.

Marie stood at the foot of the stairs. But it wasn't the Marie I remembered. Her skin was gray and bloated, her eyes sunken and filled with a sickly yellow light. Her once beautiful hair hung in wet, rotting clumps around her face. She wore the same dress we buried her in, now stained with dirt and God knows what else.

"Marie," I breathed, unable to believe what I was seeing.

Her mouth stretched into an impossibly wide grin, revealing rows of needle-sharp teeth. "I've come to take our son home, John. It's time for Ethan to join me."

Ethan squirmed in my arms, reaching out towards the thing that looked like his mother. "Mommy?" he called, his voice a mixture of fear and longing.

The creature's eyes locked onto Ethan, and she took a step forward. The floorboards creaked and squelched under her bare, mud-caked feet.

"No!" I shouted, clutching Ethan tighter. "You're not taking him!"

I turned and ran for the kitchen, my mind racing. Salt. I needed salt. Wasn't that supposed to work against spirits or something?

As I fumbled through the cabinets, I could hear Marie's wet footsteps getting closer. The air grew cold, and the putrid stench of decay filled the room.

"Oh, John," her voice sing-songed from just outside the kitchen. "You can't protect him forever. Ethan belongs with me now."

I finally found the salt and turned around, ready to throw it. But what I saw made the container slip from my numb fingers.

Marie stood in the doorway, but her body was... wrong. Her limbs were elongated, joints bent at impossible angles. Her head lolled to one side, neck stretched and distorted. And behind her, writhing in the shadows, were dozens of arms, reaching, grasping.

Ethan screamed.

In that moment, as I stared into the abyss of that horrifying scene, I knew our lives would never be the same. Whatever was wearing Marie's face, whatever had been coming for my son night after night, it wasn't going to stop.

And I had no idea how to fight it.

The thing that wasn't Marie lurched forward, its grotesque limbs scrabbling across the kitchen floor. I backed away, clutching Ethan to my chest, my mind blank with terror. My back hit the kitchen counter, and I realized we were trapped.

"Please," I begged, though I knew reasoning with this creature was futile. "Please, just leave us alone."

The thing cocked its head at an unnatural angle, Marie's once-beautiful features twisting into a mockery of confusion. "Leave you alone? But John, we're family. And family should be together... forever."

One of its many arms shot out, impossibly fast, grabbing my ankle. I yelped as icy fingers dug into my flesh, the chill spreading up my leg like poison. Ethan whimpered in my arms, his small body shaking uncontrollably.

In that moment of pure desperation, something inside me snapped. A surge of protective rage coursed through my veins, burning away the paralyzing fear. I wouldn't let this thing take my son. I couldn't.

With a roar, I kicked out at the creature's face. My foot connected with a sickening squelch, and it reeled back, momentarily stunned. I seized the opportunity, charging past it towards the basement door. If we couldn't leave the house, maybe we could find a way to trap it.

I slammed the basement door behind us and fumbled for the light switch. The dim bulb flickered to life, casting long shadows across the cluttered space. Ethan clung to me, his face buried in my shoulder.

"Daddy," he whispered, "I'm scared."

"I know, buddy," I said, trying to keep my voice steady. "But we're gonna be okay. I promise."

That's when I saw it. In the corner of the basement, partially hidden behind some old boxes, was a door I'd never noticed before. It looked ancient, its wood warped and stained with age.

From upstairs came the sounds of splintering wood and shattering glass. The creature was tearing the house apart looking for us.

With no other choice, I approached the mysterious door. As I reached for the handle, Ethan suddenly spoke up.

"That's where Mommy comes from," he said matter-of-factly.

I froze. "What do you mean, Ethan?"

He pointed at the door. "Every night at 2:12, that door opens. Mommy comes out and goes to my window. She says she misses us and wants us to come with her. But I was scared, so I didn't open the window."

My mind reeled. How long had this been going on? And why 2:12 AM?

Then it hit me. 2:12 AM. February 12th. The day Marie died.

Before I could process this revelation, the basement door exploded inward. The creature that wore Marie's face came slithering down the stairs, its body contorting in ways that defied physics.

"Found you," it hissed, its voice a chorus of whispers.

I grabbed the handle of the mysterious door and yanked it open. Beyond it was not the foundation of our house, but a swirling vortex of shadows and mist. The air that rushed out was frigid and smelled of decay.

The creature let out an inhuman shriek. "No! You can't send me back! I won't go alone!"

It lunged at us, its numerous arms outstretched. In that split second, I made a decision that would haunt me forever.

I set Ethan down and kissed his forehead. "I love you, buddy. Always remember that."

Then, using all my strength, I shoved the creature towards the open door. But as it teetered on the threshold, one of its arms wrapped around my waist.

I looked at Ethan, saw the terror and confusion in his eyes. "Run, Ethan! Run upstairs and don't look back!"

The last thing I saw was my son's tear-streaked face as the creature and I fell through the doorway into the abyss beyond.

I don't know how long I fell. Time seemed to have no meaning in that place of shadows and whispers. But eventually, I crashed onto what felt like solid ground.

I opened my eyes to find myself back in my own basement. The old door had vanished, leaving only a blank wall. Sunlight streamed through the small windows. Morning had come.

Painfully, I climbed the stairs, calling out for Ethan. I found him curled up on the living room couch, sleeping peacefully. When I woke him, he had no memory of the night's events.

It's been a week since that terrible night. The scratches on Ethan's window are gone, as if they never existed. He no longer gets up at 2:12 AM. To all appearances, our lives have returned to normal.

But I know better.

Sometimes, late at night, I hear whispers coming from the basement. And in my dreams, I see Marie - the real Marie - reaching out to me from beyond a door I can never open.

I don't know if the creature will find another way back. I don't know if it's truly gone, or if it's just biding its time. All I know is that every night, I check on Ethan at 2:12 AM.

And every night, I pray that the knocking doesn't start [again](https://www.reddit.com/user/prodshebi/comments/1e5c94y/welcome_to_my_horror_story_universe/).
