I’m writing this now because I don’t know how much of it is still in my head and how much actually happened. If you’ve ever taken something that bends reality, you’ll get what I mean. But this felt like more than that. This felt wrong in a way that drugs can’t explain.

There’s this field we always go to. Me, Vini, and Renato.  
It’s outside the city, far as hell, but it’s peaceful. Massive field, slightly hilly, with that soft blue-green grass that looks like a dream when the sun’s low. Always quiet. Always empty. We’d go there to smoke, eat some laced candy sometimes, lay down and just drift.

We’ve been going there for over a year. It never changed.

But this time, when we arrived… there was a building.

Dead center of the field. Like someone just planted it there.

A tall, narrow concrete block, windowless, covered in stains. Black patches on the surface, rusty streaks that looked almost organic, like veins. It was all wrong — the proportions, the way it just *sat* there like it had been waiting for us.

But we were already buzzing. We laughed it off. “Field just leveled up,” Vini joked.

We each took a candy. Strong stuff. I don’t know where Renato got them. He always knew someone. The sky started melting like usual, but the field didn’t feel right anymore. The wind didn’t blow. The grass didn’t move.

And the building —  
It looked closer.

There was a door too. Not the building entrance. I mean a DOOR. Just standing there, alone, upright in the field about twenty feet from us. No frame. No walls. Just a wooden door in the dirt.

At first it looked closed.  
Then it wasn’t.  
Then it was breathing.

Vini was the first to freak out. He started scratching his cheek, muttering that something was under his skin. But not in a “paranoid-high” way. Like he really felt something crawling. His nails dug in. Blood started running down his neck.

Renato stared at the door like he was hypnotized. His mouth was hanging open and his eyes were watering. He said, “It’s listening.”  
Then he laughed.  
Then he started pulling at his face. First his lips, then under his eyes, peeling back the skin like he was trying to take his own head off.  
His gums were bleeding. He didn’t even flinch.

I wanted to run. I think I did. But everything around me was too soft. Like running in a dream. I looked at the door — and it was wide open.

Inside…  
I saw something that broke me.  
It was like a hallway made of meat. Breathing walls. A sky that pulsed like a heartbeat. Screams that were muffled, like underwater crying.  
And something standing at the end of it.  
Tall. Bent backwards. No face.  
It was waving.

Vini was on the ground, laughing and slamming his head against a rock, blood splashing with each hit. Renato tried to walk through the door, but his leg stopped working and he just dragged it behind him like a puppet on broken strings.

I screamed. I think.  
I don’t remember getting out of there.

I woke up in the field, alone. My shoes were gone. There was dirt in my mouth. My arms were scratched to hell. No sign of the building. No door. Just a quiet field again, like none of it happened.

That was two days ago.  
Renato and Vini haven’t come back.  
I told the cops they ran off while high. I didn’t know what else to say.

Last night, I woke up at 3:12 AM. My bedroom door — which I always keep closed — was open.

And for a second,  
I swear I could hear breathing coming from the other side.

Since then, I haven't been able to sleep well. I'm paranoid. Maybe the weed is still making me this way. But I'm thinking about going back there. Maybe that place can only be accessed this way. I need to find my friends. I feel like the police are suspicious of me, and Vini's mother's looks are scary. When I close my eyes, I can hear her crying. This weekend, I'm thinking about going back there. Any advice or warning? Has anyone had a similar experience?
