Okay so huge update! Between this post and the last one I received a message from someone claiming to be from Plucketville. Asking her questions now to see if she recognises certain landmarks or people, if she does then I will give her her own part to explain what she knows about Plucketville and potentially where it went.

Also Hancock still doesn’t believe me, I have little to no photos of Plucketville since Mum and Dad always told me to live in the moment. He wants to see some and if I find any I’ll post them but I genuinely think I have none, sorry guys. 

Finally, yes, my name is Jacob. Forgot to mention it until the last line, my bad.

Anyway, back to it.

**13-16:**

During my early teens I started to normalise the oddities mentioned in the previous post. I think when I was younger it confused me because nowhere else on TV or online had the same specific rules and local legends. But by the time I was in highschool and slowly creeping to adulthood, I just assumed we may be a little different or that these things were so normal and commonplace that people online just didn’t talk about them.

I was wrong.

Michael’s funeral was odd, it came well after his death, months after. I had just turned 13 and we went to an open field. There were other grave sites but no grave stones, just sticks, some had a plank of wood for a name, others had nothing.

A priest arrived and he wore a standard brown robe, he read an excerpt from the Bible. I think what he said was, “If young Michael Richards came back alive today, he would repent for what he had done, he would quote the holy words of the lord. I think he would say something akin to Job 42:6 before dying once more, in honour of our blessed lord!”

Michael’s mother was the only family member there, his Dad never showed. I actually never saw him again. When the priest handed her the microphone she read what Job 42:6 was and left, not saying any kindness with it, not talking about how happy of a child he was or his laugh or even that she missed him.

Just, “Job 42:6, Therefore I reject myself and repent in dust and ashes.”

Sarah and I would bike to his grave whenever we got the chance. Just to be around him I suppose. I remember one time Michael’s Mum was there. God her cries were damn near deafening. I welled up in tears just listening to her. Sarah and I stood out of sight and watched, listened for a while.

“You stupid, STUPID boy! Why did you close the door? Why did you fucking do that?”

She never used to swear, it was like a gut punch to hear such fury and sorrow. Rage at her son for what he did, for what he could have avoided. 

I never spoke, I just followed Sarah when she walked up. She was a kind child, very soft spoken, “Miss Richards? Are you okay?”

She turned and faced Sarah, her eyes wide as saucepans, her cheek literally dripping with tears, feeding the weeds by her knees.

She sucked in a gulp of air and rose, towering over Sarah, “You can make choices Sarah, they gifted us this.”

“Who?” Sarah responded, her fingers playing with the torn plastic on her handlebars.

“God. Michael chose to kill himself, for that is his right. As this is mine.” She struck Sarah across the face, an open palmed slap that dropped her to the ground. She grabbed at Michael’s grave stick and wreathed it from the earth and left. Never making eye contact with me, and never caring to listen to Sarah’s whimpers. 

Sarah’s parents pressed charges, last I heard she got locked in prison for a while, and died in there. Self inflicted to my knowledge.

Sarah herself always seemed to understand why she was slapped, she would justify it by saying she was just sad or that she startled her. I never defended it, I don’t care if you lost a loved one, you don’t assault a child. Sarah never saw it that way, “She knew something we didn’t.”

At age 14 I started being taught more about religion. My family wasn’t a religious family, no bibles in the house, we didn’t go to church or even discuss it, it was a concept I knew of but didn’t learn the details. After Michael was buried my parents started discussing it more, trying to get a grasp of it all. By 14 I was also drawn in.

Hancock and I also disagree on how the Bible is meant to be read so let me detail my knowledge on the subject. 

During the dawn of time God created the Earth and light and people. This Hancock and I agree on.

Now this is where our beliefs change. He claims that Adam and Eve were the first people. I was under the belief that Adam and Eve were a representation of humans without the guiding hand of God. God didn’t tell the two to not eat the apple, they just knew it was bad. The snake was a representation of their desires, their defiance to what they knew was right.

Additionally the main idea I was taught was that I have free will, that if I didn’t want to follow the rules I didn’t have to but I was told that these rules will be more beneficial than not. Hancock vaguely agreed  but kept reiterating that God is meant to forgive all sin, and if breaking a rule is a sin it doesn’t matter if I break it or not I will be rewarded.

Heaven was another weird concept for me to grasp. Hancock described it as this idea that AFTER life you will go to heaven, this eternal place of light and happiness, where all your dreams come true. I was informed I was already in heaven, that Earth and specifically Plucketville was what God built for me, that I should love what I had before I died, because after death there was nothing for me.

I suppose after rereading certain parts of the Bible my beliefs fall apart, there is direct mention of heaven and sin and Adam and Eve were directly affected by God's guiding hand.

Oddly in Plucketville it was debated if there was only one God, my parents thought there was but had a belief that his mind was connected to dozens and dozens of bodies. Though some pastors believed there are multiple Gods, mentioning all of them would simply take too long and they’re all as important as each other so they were all connected in the singular word of God.

Jesus wasn’t ever taught to me as important, yes he did miracles and yes he was given to us by God but as my Mum said, “Both you and Tyler were gifts from God. I’m still a virgin after all.”  Which I suppose was true. Hancock informs me that my Mum being a virgin is impossible, the virgin Mary is the only biblical virgin with a child. Though, most people in Plucketville never had sexual intercourse and many had kids.

At 15 I finally got the guts to ask Sarah out. This was the most important moment of this year so I thought to mention it. It also meant I got to visit her family more often and I found that their rituals were even more strange than mine.

As I mentioned in the previous part, Sarah’s family believed the elves were spirits and therefore treated them with a little more respect. Not only was their backdoor nailed open but they had no other doors except the front door. Their house was constantly freezing and leaves blew all around the house so often they didn’t even bother to sweep them up. Every night they placed a plate of cooked lamb on the counter, every single night. 

Apparently observing these spirits was so taboo that the kids were forced to have padlocked masks on. They were standard sleeping masks pulled incredibly tight and then instead of velcro to strap them shut it was two metal rings and lock. The parents would come around to each room and unlock them every morning and every morning they would eat what the spirits left on the plate, which was never much.

Even when I stayed over I was forced to wear the mask, except on my 16th birthday.

My 16th birthday was nice, Sarah’s family baked me a lovely cake and made me homemade crumbed chicken. It wasn’t perfect though, it was the first time they talked badly about Michael and his family.

Sarah’s Mum said, “Upsetting the spirits like that, of course they would let Michael run all over them and risk everything!”

Her Dad even belittled him, calling him a, “Sinful, greedy, cowardly, prick.”

I stood up for him, he was my best friend, I loved him. I told them they were all awful for saying those things, that he was just a scared kid. I then remember saying, “I don’t think the spirits would like hearing you speak like that either.”

Sarah’s Mum apologised and walked away from the table crying. Her Dad just said, “Fucking hell,” under his breath. 

That night I wasn’t given a mask, I saw Sarah’s Mum putting it in the liquor cabinet and locking it away. I wanted to ask why, I wanted to apologise but I was a fired up teen and I refused to back down.

That night I was awoken by a noise to my right. A sucking, swallowing, gurgling noise. Heaved intake and outtake, over and over. At first I thought it was Sarah but when I went to roll over and look I felt Sarah grab my arm from the other side and she whispered, “Just close your eyes, close them so tight it hurts.”

The breathing continued, I dared not look over, a sucking, wet, disgusting noise for the inhale followed by a loud swallowing gulp for the exhale, over and over.

“Please Jacob, just don’t look, please.”

I tightened my eyes and I heard the sucking noise get closer and closer to my head, at one point I felt a soft wet prodding on my cheek that slowly dragged itself to my forehead. Like I was being slowly licked over the course of a minute. After maybe 10 minutes I heard the thing trample away, clumsy, clicking footfalls. I heard it scuttle out of the room and scratch along the wooden floor as it went towards the kitchen. I heard the plate shift and clatter as this thing consumed the lamb and then the noises just stopped. In the morning I was scared to leave the room. 

I told Sarah, “It didn’t leave, I didn’t hear it walk out.”

And she just nodded and said, “Yeah, they never do.”

For the rest of the day I asked her why I couldn’t look, I begged to know why it was such a risk in this house and the best answer she gave was, “I think that because we attract them to our house they’re more curious and as Mummy says, a curious spirit will take the curious child.”

The rest of my 16 year old life was spent at my house, Sarah rarely came over and when she did she made me double, triple check I locked my room’s door. I’m scared to mention this part but on a few occasions Sarah and I enacted Foul Reproduction but without making a child. I had seen it online and wanted to try. My parents found out once and didn’t get mad, they just told me that if I wanted to risk having an ugly baby I should keep going.

I didn’t like the idea of an ugly baby, I felt guilty. Sarah didn’t, Sarah told me that if I had seen what they do to women in Correct Reproduction I wouldn’t feel guilty either. That was also the moment I found out that all the girls had to make a promise to the teacher to never disclose what happens to, “Avoid scaring away boys from wanting to use Correct Reproduction.”

I was so conflicted I asked my Dad what was wrong with an ugly baby and he said, “They’re like out of towners, they’re a risk.”

I asked, “What’s risky about out of towners?”

“God doesn’t like them, they’re not his creations.”

**17:**

I know I usually do multiple years of my life but this singular year was quite confronting to remember. The next part will contain the rest of the years, 18-24 I promise. It will also contain what this certain nameless Plucketville resident saw during her stay. Unless it’s too long, then I’ll have to split it up.

17 was when I graduated school. I immediately had to pick which university I wanted to go to in town, of which there were 2. P.U.R (Plucketville University of Religion) specialised in religion (obviously), and many kids were being forced to go. The other, Phoenix University, was mostly for engineering and medicine. Both schools had other focuses but none of them stood out to me.

I decided to look elsewhere and stumbled across the uni I am going to now, (which will remain private). It had more artistic pursuits and seemed very highly rated compared to the other universities in the same area. I told my Mum and Dad about my choice and they seemed sad. They didn’t say anything, oddly enough, just left the room.

The next day they were sitting on the couch in the living room when I walked in, with a massive binder of old photos from my childhood. They said nothing, just got me to sit in the middle of them and rest the album on my lap. 

There were pictures of me playing in a sandpit, me posing next to the biggest tree in town and even pictures of Michael. After about 8 pages my Dad closed the book, his thumb bookmarking the page, “Jacob, do you want to lose all this?” He asked, not upset or mad, just curious.

“No, of course not Dad, I love those pictures.” I said reassuringly.

“Not the pictures kid, everything in them. The people, the places, do you want to lose them?” He had such a kind smile, such a nice tone of voice.

“No, why?” I didn’t get it, I was trying to grasp at what made him get so sentimental.

Mum chimed in, “People like you and Tyler aren’t meant to leave, you’re not ready for it. Please pick a uni in town, maybe Phoenix?”

Dad mumbled, “Not P.U.R.” Followed by a lovely chuckle.

I took a moment and processed what she said and I came up with a response, “I’ve always wanted to go on a trip out of Plucketville, if anyone in this family is MEANT to leave town for schooling it’s me!” I nearly felt like standing to act out my speech, “I’ve always dreamt of going places, searching the nearest airports, bus rides and the like. I know how to travel, I know how to use maps and I know the best highways to get anywhere from here to fricken North Australia!”

Mum yelled, it was sudden and caught me so off guard, making me flinch and cower slightly. I would be lying to say I didn’t tear up a little, “You’re not built for it! You’ll kill yourself on the way or worse kill someone else!”

She had tears running down her face, this emotion must have been building since the day prior, “Plucketville isn’t perfect, but just think a little bit about it okay? Just a little bit?”

I went to hug my Mum, a child leaving can never be easy, honestly I don’t know how I’m gonna do it when the time comes. As I turned my hip bumped the corner of the book and it spilled out onto the floor, a single photo slid out of its pocket, sticking upright facing the ceiling. Dad scooped it up quickly but the image was burned into my brain.

It was a baby, a newborn, I assumed it was me. I was swaddled in a towel, on a steel bench. Around me were two doctors and more metal, metal floors, metal walls and a strange large metal door with a red light next to it. The door was in the middle of sliding open, leaving the streaking motion blur. In the doorway was a massive quadrupedal thing, the legs were thick and brown, hairy too, the image was taken from so far away that its details weren’t entirely captured. A flat disk sat on top of the legs, like a mudcrabs body but slightly thicker, dangling from the centre of the disk was a grey eyeless face, no nose, or maybe just too far away to tell and a gaunt mouth, dangling open towards the floor. The last thing I remember was how red its right leg was, red from the clawed foot to the first joint, the red then leaked onto the metal floor.

“What the hell was that?” I asked.

Dad shrugged, “You in hospital I think.”

“No!” I said in exasperated annoyance, “The thing, the thing in the doorway.”

My Dad then slid the picture into his pocket, “Just a fella, looks weird cause of the door’s movement.”

My Mum, still crying, spoke up, “Don’t lie to him Chuck,” her eyes looked to mine and she placed a calm hand on my leg, “that’s an auditor or an elf, if you still believe in that. That’s the one that helped me give birth to you.” She pressed her index finger into my chest.

I hate to say it but it was that moment I decided I would eventually leave Plucketville. My Mum was trying to sway me to stay but I instead realised how frightened I had become.

In the moment I don’t know if I realised how scared the situation made me, for years I never told myself but that was the turning point. 

Reflecting now, I was terrified, terrified not only of the elf but terrified of how my Dad hid it, how my Mum seemed to respect it. She spoke like it was a family friend or the guiding hand of a skilled nurse. I think in that moment I saw flashes of Michael, I saw flashes of his fear, his desire to lock the creatures out. I saw myself with that fear, with that burning desire. 

I may have even come close to closing our door.
