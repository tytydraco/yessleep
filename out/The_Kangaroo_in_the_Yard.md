It’s been a week. It doesn’t make sense to you, and honestly, not to me either. It all started on an ordinary night, after a long day of work. I was exhausted, you know how it is, just wanting to get home, see my 11-year-old daughter, maybe watch TV together and relax a bit.

When I parked the car, I noticed something strange. The gate to my house was ajar. I swear I had closed it before leaving, or at least, I think I did. But now, trying to remember, that memory feels faded. I can’t even recall leaving the house. Maybe it was just the exhaustion. I’m forgetful, always have been. Little things, like what I had for lunch, slip from my mind. But that gate... that worried me.

I jumped out of the car, running toward the yard. My heart was pounding—my daughter was inside. What if someone had broken in? As I turned the corner leading to the living room, I stopped abruptly. There, standing in the shadows at the end of the hall, was something that made me question reality.

A kangaroo.

Yes, I know, it sounds ridiculous. But it wasn’t a normal kangaroo. It was distorted, almost humanoid, and the strangest part, it wasn’t looking at me directly. It just stood there, turned sideways, as if it were smiling at something invisible. I yelled, trying to scare it off, but it didn’t move. It just stayed there, with that frozen smile, staring into the void. I shouted my daughter’s name, ran to the living room, and locked the door behind me. She was there, asleep on the couch, like she always did, but the TV was off, which was strange. She never slept with the TV off. It was as if someone had… turned it off for her.

I shook her awake. She opened her eyes, confused. When I told her there was a kangaroo in the yard, she became curious, but also scared. I rushed to show her… but it was gone. Disappeared as if it had never been there. She gave me that disappointed look, and I felt the fear twist into a sense of madness. Was I imagining it all?

The days that followed were a blur. I tried to carry on with my routine. I took my daughter to the park, as I had promised. The park was busy, lights twinkling, children laughing. It seemed like the perfect place to forget what had happened. But then, I saw it again. While my daughter was playing, I noticed a door, one of those marked "Employees Only." It was slightly open. And there, in the dim light, it was again.

The kangaroo.

The same smile. The same vacant stare. My skin prickled. I couldn’t move for a while. Then, as if on instinct, I began walking toward that door. I don’t know why I did it. Maybe I wanted answers. Maybe I wanted to confront it. But suddenly, the park lights went out. The voices around me vanished. A deafening silence fell over the place. It was as if I were the only one there. I sprinted back to my daughter, panicking, but when the lights flickered back on, the park was… empty. The laughter and shouts were gone. Everyone had disappeared.

I rushed back to the car, heart pounding. I drove like a madman to my mother’s house, needing something familiar to ground me. When I arrived, I knocked, and she appeared at the door, but something was off. She looked… different. Older, maybe? Or was it just my mind playing tricks on me? I went inside, still shaking, and started telling her how the park had gone empty, how everyone had disappeared. She tried to calm me, went to get a glass of water from the kitchen.

That’s when I heard the knock on the window. The same knock I hear in my nightmares to this day.

I looked, and there it was.

The kangaroo. Smiling.

I called for my mother, panicking. She rushed over and looked out the window. “What is it, dear?” she asked. “It’s him, our pet, go see him.”

I froze. What? My mother didn’t have any pets. But she smiled, as if it was the most normal thing in the world. Something inside me screamed that this was wrong. That none of it made sense.

I don’t know why, but I opened the door. And there it was. The kangaroo, standing in the yard, waiting for me. As I took a step forward, I felt something warm trickle from my nose. Blood. My vision blurred, and then… everything went dark.

I woke up in the hospital. My mother said she found me unconscious in the yard. My daughter was safe, someone from the park had taken her to safety when the lights went out. But she said something that chilled me. She said she saw me "making faces" at the park, as if I were playing alone. She thought I had run off.

And since then, I haven’t seen the kangaroo again. But every night, before I go to bed, I look out the window, waiting for it to appear again.

I know it will.
