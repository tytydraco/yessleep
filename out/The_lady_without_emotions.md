London, 1892.

The fog slithered like a dying thing—low and heavy, coiling around lampposts, stretching thin fingers along cobblestones slick with last night’s rain. From somewhere unseen, a church bell tolled once, twice—a slow, iron sound mourning something already buried.

Detective Elias Rourke stepped past the constable’s chalk lines behind Milliner’s Row, pulling his collar high against the damp. The alley reeked—sour meat, soot, and something older, deeper. Rats skittered as he approached the body.

He didn’t need to ask who had done it.

She was waiting again.

Same as before.

Amaya sat beside the corpse on an overturned crate, hands folded in her lap like a schoolgirl at chapel. Her black boots were spotless. No blood on her gloves. The boy’s throat had been opened cleanly—no mess, no hesitation.

Surgical.

She watched Rourke with unblinking eyes, their colorless clarity more unsettling than any madness. No triumph. No regret. Just... stillness.

“Evening, Detective,” she said. Her voice was quiet and flat—like the last echo of a prayer long forgotten.

Rourke studied her in silence, then glanced at the boy.

“You ever run?”

“I’ve never needed to.”

The Interrogation Room.

Gaslight hissed and fluttered. The plaster walls peeled in long strips, like skin. Rourke sat at the edge of the table, sleeves rolled to the elbows. A cigarette trembled between his fingers, barely lit.

Across from him, Amaya sat with iron cuffs circling her wrists. She hadn’t spoken since her arrest. Not until now.

“You look tired,” she said.

“It’s been a long week.”

“You haven’t slept in three days.”

He raised an eyebrow.

“You’ve had six cups of coffee today. No alcohol. Your pupils are dilated. Your left hand twitches slightly every time you inhale.”

She tilted her head. “Do you always lie so poorly?”

He stared at her. “You always watch this closely?”

“It’s how I survive.”

“No. You survive because the law hesitates.”

She smiled—barely.

“Let’s talk about Gunther’s Lane,” he said. “Seven-year-old girl. Missing for two weeks. Found wrapped in white cloth, left in a pew like an offering.”

Amaya was silent.

“You cut her open. Took her heart.”

She blinked slowly. “It was an experiment.”

Rourke slammed his palm on the table. The cigarette ash snapped.

“What the hell is wrong with you?”

“I ask myself the same thing.”

“You cut out a child’s heart!”

“I didn’t hate her. I didn’t feel anything at all. There is only a gap where emotion should live.”

She raised her cuffed hands.

“This is my shape. But inside? There’s only observation.”

He sat back, jaw clenched. The cigarette had burned out.

“You know what they call you.”

“Monster. Devil. Abomination.” She shrugged. “People need words to protect themselves from mirrors.”

He narrowed his eyes. “Mirrors?”

“Yes.” Her voice barely stirred the air. “Because if I’m not a monster, what does that make you? The soldier who shot children in the hills of India. The detective who let a man bleed out because you feared the dark.”

His mouth twitched. “You don’t know—”

“I don’t feel,” she interrupted. “But I notice. I smell guilt like rot. I hear it in your breath. You want me to be evil. Because it means you aren’t.”

He stood abruptly. The chair screeched back.

“I sleep at night,” he muttered.

“Do you?” she asked.

The bell tolled again—faint, outside, far away.

The Execution Chamber.

The room was white—too white. The paint had a sickly yellow sheen in the electric glow, like old teeth. The air was still. Too still. As if even the walls held breath.

Amaya sat strapped to the chair, the copper headpiece gleaming dully above her brow. Her hair had been tied back with surgical precision. Her face remained unreadable.

Behind the glass, officials murmured. Journalists leaned forward with pens poised. Rourke stood at the back, hat against his chest.

No one met his eyes.

Amaya’s gaze moved through the crowd—not searching, only cataloguing.

Pain. Anger. Curiosity. Fear.

So many faces. So many masks.

The warden stepped forward.

“Any last words?”

She looked at him. A beat passed. Then another.

“Will I feel it?”

Confused silence rippled.

“The pain,” she said, voice low. “The pain that teaches. That molds. That makes humans real.”

Her eyes turned toward the glass. Toward Rourke.

“I wonder,” she whispered, “if it will make me real too.”

A long silence.

Then the switch.

Her body arched violently. Fingers splayed. A cry escaped—not of fear, not of agony—something raw and unnamable. For one moment, something sparked in her eyes. Something alive.

Then stillness.

Eyes open. Staring.

And in them—faintly, perhaps impossibly—was the shimmer of something that might have been recognition.

Rourke lingered after the crowd dispersed. After the officials left. After the corpse was wheeled away beneath a white sheet.

He lit a cigarette.

The match shook in his hand.

The bell tolled again, far off.

A flicker of ash dropped to the floor.

He stared at it.

He still didn’t know who the monster had been.
