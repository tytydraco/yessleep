Well surprise to everyone. I lived. I certainly didn’t think I would. Sorry for the hiatus I didn’t quite have the time to update everyone. But I’m back. Or at least I hope.

I’m a little calmer this time around. 

To acknowledge a few comments:
1. To the people quoting the Frey, truly where did I go wrong? 
2. To the person saying I was doomed for recording for TikTok. Honestly fair point however, I would rather have my death documented. At least then there would be evidence.
3. To the person telling me to call the police, I think I would get chucked into a psychward. Like “Hello officer yes there is a ‘god’ like being currently harassing me???” 
4. And finally, to the person who is saying I should be nice to it? Are you in on this too? Do you know about this being?? If so please tell me. Cause this shit is insanity.

Also I realize I should probably introduce myself. Hello, I’m Mica I’m a 24yr old professional dumbass who probably needs an exorcism. 

From where I left off with it coming to the closet door. Right as it was opening it. Everything suddenly stopped. It went eerily silent, like I could’ve heard a pin drop. I think I sat in the closet for another hour before making my way out. And when I got out the sight before me was terrifying. My bedroom door was closed, not even a scratch in it. But my kitchen chair was broken. On the wall written in what I think is charcoal was a bunch of religious quotes. Most notably “he died for our sins” with a bunch of others illegibly written amongst it. The blood and alcohol however was cleaned up, and the previously broken bowl was reassembled. Which just fucked with my head. Because I swore it was a broken mess. But my bedroom… my bedroom was probably the most confusing. 

Nothing was out of place. The only thing different was a cross, a cross that seemed to be nailed to my wall. And as of my time of writing. It is still there. Which I do plan to take off my wall. Because that thing scares me. I have no idea what the hell that cross is doing there. Like I stated before. I am not religious. My family isn’t religious. And I’ve never owned a cross. But it just looks wrong? It looks like it was carved out of bone? Or maybe a type of ivory. It however, will be vacating the premise.

Additionally, my landlord is pissed. Apparently several times over the previous days he has attempted to get ahold of me. As there was complaints of loud banging sounds, church bells and crying. Which. I don’t know how the hell I am supposed to explain. But that’s not the weird part. When I finally called him back apologizing, he said it was fine. The noise complaint only came in on Sunday, and ended promptly a couple hours later. Despite during the entire week I was basically in hell. 

I also got fired. For no-call-no-showing work for a week. I mean I got severance. But there was no way in hell I could explain this. Absolutely no way.

Another wild thing. TikTok deleted my posts saying they violated community guidelines. And I cannot find any evidence of Mary. It’s like she dropped off the face of the earth. The texts from her in the dm’s are gone. Like there is NOTHING. So I’m starting to officially think that maybe I did go insane. Or have a psychosis episode. Or something. Because what the hell just happened. Regardless. I think I’m insane.

Which the idea of my mental health going is terrifying enough as is. But the idea of this being real? Even worse.

But I am going to go attempt to clean my wall. And removed the cross from my wall as well.


Update: So it’s around 10pm, and honestly I think I just need to move.

While I was trying to scrub the walls, there was two things I noticed. The charcoal stuff seemed to be oily? Like the soapy water wasn’t making a dent in it. It’s like it just smeared more. So I guess I’m stuck with it for the time being. I guess it’s art now? But I have no idea what I’m going to say or do if my landlord ever wants to come and inspect.

As for my unfortunate cross situation. I got it off the wall. It was nailed in. When I took it off, it seemed like the energy in the space changed. Like. It had the air sucked out of it. But I decided for the time being; I’m going to hold onto it until I figure out how to properly dispose of it. 

In the meantime, I was doing some research online and I’ve come across weird things. But most notably, this god named Yaldaboath. Apparently he’s from the New Testament? He is a “false god” who only desires to cause pain and suffering. So I am thinking maybe I should call a local church. Maybe have a priest or demonologist help out? Cause I think I may have severely fucked up. 

It’s been about 3 days since I last heard or saw anything though. So maybe I’m in the clear? I also called my sister earlier today. She’s all into the witchy pagan stuff. She thinks I’m just fucking with her. And since I can’t find anything to back up my claims (thanks again TikTok now my family thinks I’m crazy). I’m kind of at a loss.

Update2: it’s 4am. I think I made a mistake removing the cross. 

I was sleeping pretty much after adding that last update. I had gone to bed, plugged my phone in. Fell asleep.

In my dreams however, I saw my ex girlfriend. We were arguing. (Note we had broken up probably 2 years ago). And it was the same argument leading up to the breakup. I worked too much, she was too busy. She thinks I cheated, I think she did. Then everything went black. She came back into view. Then I felt this splitting feeling in my head, there was horns growing out of my head. My eyes were burning, I started screaming at her “don’t you love me? You said you do” she smiled, the same fucking smile that thing had and Mary had. And said “God loves all of us Mica.”

I snapped awake. As I did I was frozen staring at the ceiling, I could feel tears pouring out of my eyes. But then I heard my door slowly creak open and then close. I didn’t want to move. But I heard this noise, like when a cat chatters. I started tingling all over, I felt my heart rate pick up. Then all of a sudden things when silent. And I heard humming. This wasn’t regular humming, this was the humming of a little girl. I slowly turned my head towards my door. I didn’t see anything, I turned my head the other way towards my dresser. There was nothing. I sighed of relief. I figured that was just me scaring myself.

Turning my up back up. I closed my eyes. Until I felt something on the foot of my bed. I wanted to scream, but I opened my mouth. Nothing came out. Snapping my head up, there was that same fucking hand. The pitch black spindly hand of the thing. I couldn’t move my legs or my body. I was frozen in fear, the other hand came up. Then slowly, the things head came up. It was cracked porcelain, the eyes weren’t black. They were pits, like the eyes had been gouged out. It slowly started making its way up onto the bed. The weight and the smell. It’s engrained into my body. The sick smell of incense and the weight feels like when I get up tomorrow I’m going to be covered in bruises. As it made its way up I squeezed my eyes shut. Eventually it was right on top of me. In the breathless voice of an elderly man. Like a hollow struggling to breathe, breathy voice it said “Look at me child. You are after all a child of god aren’t you? Created in his divine image.” Then eventually I felt breath on my face. “Just give up, the heavens provide light, all against the way. I am sorry about your kid. Wouldn’t have been good, I met him.” Before a couple wet drops hit my face. Then the same way it came, it crawled off, my door creeped open then shut.

This was the first time I got a good look at this things face. I don’t think I can’t not see it. The wet stuff on my face was what I think was anointing oil. As for the comment about the kid. Me and my ex lost a pregnancy at 16 weeks? It was a boy.

I’m currently sitting in my car outside a gas station, I ended up deciding I can’t stay in there right now. I ended up buying a pack of darts too. I quit smoking but now? Seems reasonable. 

I’ve decided I need to find a priest. I also need to find Mary. 

So if anyone has any ideas let me know.

Update3: 8am a new cross was put up. This one is iron. My name is engraved in it.
