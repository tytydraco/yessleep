“Listen, to me bro, you gotta check out this recording studio in Downtown. It’s dirt cheap, it’s kinda sketchy but we’ve all done some sketchy shit,” I remember my friend said. 



“What’s it called?” I asked. 



“The pickled piper or something,” my friend responded. 



I’ve never been good with money or keeping up a job. Partly, this is because there was inspiration to be had and music to be made. I know it sounds like an excuse, but working a 9-5 job hampers my creativity. So I take odd jobs, mostly gigs and food delivery, so when inspiration calls, I’m available. 



I’ve been struggling to record the last part of my album because I’d been short on funds.  I always felt like money was allergic to me.  There was always rent to be due, bills and credit cards and my car was overdue on maintenance, always making a rattling sound when I drove. 



I’d nearly forgotten about that conversation about that cheap studio.  It came to the forefront of my mind during a food delivery while I was in downtown Los Angeles. 



I was dropping off the food delivery, and a few blocks down from the apartment complex where I dropped it off was a discreet building with an emerald green neon sign with *The Piper’s Call* in bright green neon LED cursive lettering.  I think that was the name of the sketchy studio that my friend was telling me about.  



The street lights hardly illuminated the area, it was in an industrial part of downtown, and there were a few long trailers down the block with some camping tents set up on the sidewalk.  Old trash littered the street, I saw a brightly lit taco truck closer to the studio area serving fresh tacos, and bacon-wrapped hot dogs.   A typical sight in downtown Los Angeles. 



There were well-dressed folks walking in and out of the studio, it looked like my kind of crowd.  Beanies, locked hair, urban fashion, and statement pieces, they looked like they were in entertainment. Funny how downtown Los Angeles had houseless folks juxtaposed with brand new buildings and the middle class on the same block. 



“It’s gotta be that studio my friend was talking about,” I said to myself, absently crunching an empty can underfoot. 



I made a quick detour to check out the spot. It was the music studio.  The inside was new, everything was all black with pops of green,and there was a modern purple couch in the shape of big red lips in the waiting area. There was some funky pop music playing in the background.  On the left, there was a soundproof conference room with a clear glass window where a group of creatives were having a meeting. 



Despite all this, I could feel the tension in the place, like something stale in the air despite the well-polished design. But I’d been in worse studios than this, so I didn’t think much of it. 



“How much for studio sessions here?” I asked the front desk staff. 



The young woman looked up from her cell phone and smiled, a silver tooth gem sparkled when she did. 



“It’s $500 per day, and you gotta pay at the end of the month.  No exceptions.” 



That was a steal in Los Angeles, where studio sessions ran $2500 per day.   
  


“What’s the catch?” 



“Like I said, pay at the end of the month, no exceptions. We have multiple rooms and a bunch of free sounds and clips, and other stuff you can use without copyright.  We mostly want our artist community in Los Angeles to thrive,” she said pointing to the non-profit sign with her French-tipped acrylic nails. 



Maybe they kept the costs low through grant funding, whatever it was. I didn’t care, because I’ve been wanting to record the music in my head for ages, and this price was a steal. 



I worked on my deliveries for the rest of the night, got a few hours of sleep, and took myself back to the studio the next day.  The same girl was there, in a fishnet top eating a breakfast sandwich and scrolling her phone when she saw me.  She smiled again, was the tooth gem always a red cherry? 



She pushed the iPad towards the contract.  There were bold red letters in multiple parts throughout the digital document that said ‘no late payments accepted’ ‘deadline strict,’ ‘no exceptions’ and I scrolled straight to the bottom of the terms of service and signed.  I checked the box to pay later.



I had just enough funds to pay for the studio, and the rent was going to be due soon.  I was already late on last month’s rent, so my plan was to pay the rent that was overdue. I had a month to make up the money for the studio session. I had confidence I would be able to do that quickly. So I put that thought on the back burner, and focused on my music.  



The studio session was one of my dreams. 



The quality of equipment was top-notch, the sound engineer was amazing and helped facilitate my creative process.  It was cannabis friendly, the dank earthy smell permeated my studio session and enhanced my sounds. 



My sound engineer was the spiritual type and asked me if I had anything to offer her studio altar.  There were flowers, coins, and mini alcohol bottles on it. There was incense burning, and a picture that had a black satin cloth over it.  I shrugged and threw a bit of loose change that was in my pocket on it. 



“What’s under that cloth?” I asked, curious. 



“A good luck deity, helps me make sure I mix the music real good,” she said, lighting an orange candle on the altar. I shrugged and took a long hit of my joint, whatever made the music flow. 



I laid down 4 tracks and damn near finished the album, I had about one more song to go before the night fell and the engineer and I decided to call it a day.  



I found myself humming my favorite song’s hook tune wherever I went. I loved eerie music that sounded like longing.  I incorporated a lot of those sounds and created some new ones with the engineer and was over the moon. 



The next three and a half weeks flew by, I was on a high from what the sound engineer had mixed and was sharing it with friends. My bank account was dreadfully low after paying the late rent, despite the long hours of food deliveries I was doing. Something about being in the studio and laying the tracks down made me feel like I was somebody again, and I went out to happy hour a few too many times with friends to celebrate and share my music. 



Then my car's engine died.



I only had enough to fix my car or to pay the studio back, and tomorrow was the due date. 



I did a quick Google search on The Piper’s Call studio to see if anyone had shared any experiences with not paying the studio back in a timely manner. Nothing came up, it was just five-star reviews without any comments. I even used Reddit to check, but I guess the studio was so small nobody had made any posts about it. 



I called my friend who had recommended me to the place, but it just rang once and went straight to voicemail. I looked long and hard at my bank account. I’d been late on rent before and my landlord was patient with me, late to work and folks didn’t mind as long as I did my job, I assumed this would be the same. I wouldn’t be able to make ends meet without my car.  



So, I took my car into the shop and decided to get it fixed up.  



I had just finished a delivery to someone in Silver Lake when I felt someone grab my arm sharply on the sidewalk.  It was a homeless man, his nails were overgrown, and his skin was scaly with untreated eczema, scratches, and there were pinprick bits of bleeding from skin picking. 



“Pay your dues.  Don’t end up like me, young man.  Work hard and always pay your dues,” he said, patting my shoulder with fervor.  



My face was furrowed in confusion, and I’m ashamed to say disgust.  He walked away, pulling a tattered blanket over his shoulder, and looked at me with a toothless smile, the smell of old urine fading as he walked away. The words he said went in one ear and out the other. I shook my head and threw my earbuds back in to re-listen to my favorite track that I had just recently finished at the studio. 



As I finished my delivery I swear I heard feedback in the background that I didn’t record.  Was that another person whispering in the background? I rewound the area where I heard it, and it was there again in between my singing.  Some harsh-sounding whispering, barely audible between the track. 



I texted the sound engineer and let her know my track was funny, and she texted me back she’d look into it. 



The next day came and went, and my car finally was out of the shop two days later. I missed the due date for The Piper’s Call and unsurprisingly nothing happened. I didn’t get a text reminder, nor any missed calls or email reminders. 



“Sweet, must be under the radar,” I said to myself, seeing that another day had passed without a warning text from the studio to pay up. 

I was happy, I didn’t want to call them and remind them about my lack of payment until I made some money.  So I decided to spend the full day doing food deliveries, it was early in the morning and I figured I could make some decent cash. 



I clicked on one of my singles to listen to in my car, wanting to hear it in surround sound.  I turned the volume way up, and pressed play.  I damn near crashed the car when I heard screeching on the track.  I pressed the off button quickly and pulled off into the street.  



“What the fuck?” I said out loud, turning the volume down and pressing play once again. 



It was screeching like tires on the road, and it sounded like someone was gurgling mud in deep octaves underneath that and that whispering was there, louder this time. It was in a language I hadn’t even heard of before, but it felt bad.  It made my head hurt, and my stomach turned, and I felt the air in my car get stale. 



I went to press the off button, but I kept almost making out words, or making out a phrase.  It felt like if I listened longer I could make something out, but it also felt like I was playing a dangerous game. Like I was looking into a dark pit that I knew I shouldn’t have been looking at, hoping to see something but knowing that if I looked long enough something would make its presence known. 



The sound tickled my ears in the strangest way - more like scratching an itch inside my head that I didn’t know existed.  It felt forbidden like I should not be listening to it. I continued to try and make out what the voices were saying. 



My eyes traveled to the rearview mirror and I saw my mouth was moving on its own and I had a drool dribbling down the sides of my mouth that had pooled on my shirt. There was a large wet stain on it, and my collar was soaking wet from sweat.  I looked at the digital clock on my dashboard and saw that two hours had passed.  



I was confused, I had just pulled to the side of the road just a few seconds ago.  I was shaken and slammed the audio button off. I checked my surroundings and saw a homeless man again, sitting and laughing at me with his toothless smile turning the corner on the road.  



I shuddered, and wiped up some of the drool from my face, bewildered.  I looked at my watch, and something told me it had to do with the studio.  I didn’t want to go back over there, because I didn’t have the money but there were too many weird things going on for it to be a coincidence. At the very least, someone messed with the music we recorded. 



I decided to go to the studio to figure out what was going on.



The woman at the front desk looked at me and smiled knowingly when I entered. “Can I help you?” she asked. 



“I need to speak to the sound engineer who worked on my album, is she here today?”

The girl shook her head.  “She’s out of town, you were the guy that came in a month ago to record your album with her though right? Your payment is past due,” she said tapping away on her iPad. 



“My car died, I’ll have the money next week,” I said. 



The young woman looked me in the eye and tapped the sign that read in bold letters ‘NO EXCEPTIONS’. 



“Our manager will contact you soon about payment,” she said, going back to her phone. 



I fumbled and pulled out my credit card, it was almost over the limit but I didn’t like the weird shit that was happening.  She looked at the card and myself, not moving an inch.

“Our manager will contact you soon about payment,” she pressed a button on the table, and a harp-like sound began to peal like delicate wind chimes being swayed by the wind, except the sound was discordant. It made my stomach hurt, my ears felt a growing pressure behind them and my sinuses felt like they were congested all of a sudden.  My hearing felt like it was underwater and I had the urge to leave the premises immediately.  I stumbled backward and out of the waiting area and into the street.  Everything was back to normal, no ear pressure, no nasal congestion, and my hearing was clear. 



I felt my heart beating, quickly and I had to get some answers. 



I called my friend's number again, the one who suggested the location in the first place. Maybe they would know what was going on, or could at least tell me if they had an experience with them.  Yet again it rang and went straight to voicemail, this time it said the voicemail box was full.  I cursed under my breath. 



“Answer your phone asshole,” I whispered. 



My fingers tapped the screen rapidly and I searched for his Instagram.  I was shocked to see that his last post was the same day we talked. He posted constantly.  Underneath his last post were comments like “praying for your safety’ ‘please come home friend!’ and someone who looked like a family member posted a link to a gofundme page, requesting support to help look for my friend who was apparently now missing. 



I cursed under my breath, something in me wondered if my friend had used the studio. I needed to chill, I needed to think.  I pulled a joint out of my pocket and lit it, while walking to my car.  I hummed to myself one of the melodies from my album.  I looked at my phone and connected it to bluetooth, I skipped the song that had the screeching sound from earlier and played the next one that we recorded.  



It sounded good to begin with. The music was like butter in my ears, until I heard the first inkling of whispering behind the track.  The urge again to make it out crept into my consciousness, but some survival instinct in me slammed the music off again.  



“No no, no this is all wrong.  What the fuck happened to the music we recorded?” I yelled in the car frustrated.



I pressed the number to dial my sound engineer.  I didn’t care that she was on vacation.  No answer.  I pressed it multiple times, I left voicemails and sent several text messages. I didn’t realize it but I was crying.  I angrily wiped the tears from my eyes and took a deep puff of my joint. 



I slammed my hands on the steering wheel and gripped it hard.  I took a deep hit from the joint to calm me down so I could think. I imagined my anxious thoughts leaving my body as I blew out a puff of smoke. 

I wanted to hear my music in the way we recorded it.  The only way I could figure out what was going on was to get my sound engineer's laptop or at the very least the USB they used.  My guess is that it was still in the studio room that we used, and if I couldn't get that USB maybe the studio had a master copy somewhere of all the music.  Mine had to be there. 



I stayed in the car for several hours until it was nighttime, waiting a few blocks down from The Piper's Call.  I wasn’t hungry, I wasn’t sleepy, I was focused. I smoked and waited.  I finally saw the young woman lock up the front door to the Piper’s Call at around 10 PM, I waited another 30 minutes and decided it was time to get inside and rummage through the recording room.



I’d done shady shit before, so it wasn’t hard to pick the lock of the studio. The studio was quiet, the name of the studio in green LED lights was in the waiting room making a faint buzzing sound.  It was dark inside, so I used my phone’s light to walk down the hallway. 



The doors were unlocked, which I found strange given there was so much expensive studio equipment to be had but I didn’t care too much, I  just wanted to find out where my sound engineer's laptop was. 



I entered the room where we had our studio session four weeks ago.  It looked the exact same, the altar was in the same spot.  Looks like there were new items added to it, a joint, a jar of what looked like dried mushrooms, and a patch of rainbow sequin fabric.  



I looked closer at the jar of what looked like mushrooms in a jar and clapped my hand over my mouth when I realized they weren’t mushrooms.  The dark brown curving lines that resembled mushrooms were human ears.  Several of them even still had gold and silver piercings dangling from them.  



I stood in shock, blinking.  I felt sick, my eyes traveled to the black satin that was covering part of the altar.  The one where when I asked the sound engineer what it was she said it was a good luck deity. Something compelled me to look underneath, to see what was giving this studio its good luck.   I grabbed a corner of the satin fabric and pulled it back. 



It was a painted portrait of what looked like a woman. 



Her hair was wet and stuck to her face, it was thick and curly and there were weathered dark lines all around her eyes, and the corner of her mouth.  At first look, they seemed like wrinkles, but on closer inspection, I saw they were written words in some other language. They were carved into her skin from the top of her forehead to her chin.  



Her mouth was open with a half smile, it looked predatory. I saw that her teeth had carvings on them too.  The artist really made it look like whoever she was looking at was being devoured by her stare.



There were large reptilian frills where human ears would be, and it was covered in what looked like multiple small tympanic membranes. Her eyes were bright yellow and threatening. A gasp left my mouth out of shock and fear at what my sound engineer considered a deity, when I did that I swear I saw her ‘ears’ flick towards my direction before I hurriedly let go of the black satin to recover her visage. 



I smelled the stench of urine and heard the humming of my song in the room.  It took me a moment to realize that I had been humming while I was looking at the photo, and my pants were soaked with urine. I realized my phone's battery was on low and was surprised because it had been almost full when I stepped inside the studio. How long was I looking at the portrait? 



I cursed under my breath, the air felt menacing now.  I felt like I messed something up.  But I was already here.  I focused my energy on rummaging around the room I was searching high and low for the laptop my sound engineer was using.  I tried the desk in the area. I tried to open it but it was locked.  I attempted to open it violently with little effect.



“Can we make this shit any harder?!” I yelled between gritted teeth, mostly talking out loud to not feel the oppressive silence and to try and scare away the fear that kept creeping into my psyche the longer I stayed in the dark studio. I imagined the lizard woman watching me from the darkness whenever my back was turned. It made it look around faster.



I looked through a bookshelf in the room and found a book incredibly hard to pull from the shelf.  Frantically I pulled with all my might and I heard a mechanical clicking sound.  The bookshelf moved to reveal a doorway that led to a dark basement. 



Call it morbid curiosity; call it stupidity but something in me wanted to know what the hell was going on down there. A small part of me thought this was where they hid the expensive equipment, but a bigger part of me felt that this wasn’t what I thought it was. 



“It-it could be down there,” I said to myself, standing still in the entryway that led into the darkness below. I felt the hairs on my neck prickle as I imagined the lizard woman again.  



“Fuck it,” I said.  I had already broken into a studio, fucked up a studio room, I might as well go all in. 



I walked down into the dark basement, my hand gripping the handrail.  I couldn’t see anything, so I turned my phone light on brighter.  The space in front of me was incredibly small, half of the size of a small exam room, but there were shelves of heads, just heads.  It was men and women missing ears, faces looking blank and stoic. 



I saw a door, a few feet to the left of the head shelf, it was slightly ajar, and I saw a small glow from the room, like that of candles being lit.  I turned my phone light off and peeked inside as quietly as I could.  



In the room I was looking into, there were shadowy figures around a table. They were silent, and the minute I laid eyes on them I started to hear whispering.  There was a group of 10 people in robes chanting.  The chants sounded like those uncanny whispers in the background of my music.  I squinted in the dark, they were lit by candlelight under there, and was appalled to see that it was my friend that I had been calling, the one everyone wrote Instagram posts about ‘come back home’. 

He had no ears, and he wasn’t making a sound despite seeming to be screaming.  I fumbled with my phone to get a video of what was going on because I knew I had to get this to the police, but I didn’t realize that it was in photo mode and a flash photo was taken of the group.  Two of the people turned to look at me and I froze. 



Their faces were blank, all with carvings on them.  My fight or flight brain took over and I booked it out of there, out the door and to my car, but I know they saw me. 



I shoulder-checked a man because I was running so fast to my car. I took a few unsteady steps back, trying to help him up, and I nearly threw up when I saw it was the homeless dude again. I let go of his shoulder, but his hand shot out to grab mine. I didn’t notice it before, but he had hearing aids on. 



“That’s the only way to get them to stop, here today, gone tomorrow,” he said pointing to his ears with a cackle. 



I took a shower and changed to calm down from the night's event. I’m sitting at home writing this on Reddit, one to warn other people about The Piper's Call studio and what they mean by no exceptions. My hands are shaking as I type this because I can hear those terrible whispers even without playing my own music. I’m thinking of that homeless dude and his hearing aids.   I’m positive I saw that reptilian lady from the portrait in the mirror after I took a shower.  



Long story short, if you ever see a studio called the Piper’s Call and they tell you to pay your dues on time.  Do it. Don’t end up like me, sitting in my home, staring at the chopsticks in my kitchen drawer, wondering how I get these whispers out of my head.
