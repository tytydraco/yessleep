It’s been a year since I escaped that village, but sometimes, when I’m in the shower, I feel a roughness on my elbows or the back of my neck that wasn’t there before. I scrub until I’m raw, but the feeling always comes back. I haven’t eaten a single peanut in a year. The smell alone makes me want to puke.

I’m writing this down because I don’t know what else to do. I need someone to believe me. And I need to warn you. If you ever get lost in the mountains, pray you’re found by a park ranger. Pray you’re found by a bear. Anything is better than finding the village we did.

It started as a stupid hiking trip. My best friend, Fang Heguang, and I thought we needed some real adventure and decided to go off-trail. We got what we wished for. The sky had turned a bruised purple by the time we admitted we were hopelessly lost.

“If you ever ask me to go hiking with you again, I will slap you!” Heguang panted, his voice a mix of exhaustion and real anger. “Do you even know how to read or use that thing?”

He was right to be angry. I was the one holding the compass and map, and I’d led us in circles for hours. The woods were growing dark and threatening, and the kind of silence that feels heavy was pressing in on us. Just as true panic began to set in, we saw it—a tiny speck of light at the bottom of a gorge. A village.

Relief washed over us so completely that we didn’t stop to think how strange it was for a village to be nestled so deep in the wilderness. It was a tiny place, no more than a dozen houses huddled together. As we got closer, the silence felt less like peace and more like a warning. There were no dogs barking, no TVs murmuring, not even the chirp of crickets. Only one house had a light on, a single orange-yellow glow that flickered like a candle in a tomb.

I walked up to the house and knocked on the weathered wooden door. The dull thuds echoed loudly throughout the silent village.

“Softer!” Heguang whispered, pulling a bag of peanuts from his pack—his favorite snack, the man was addicted—and popping the last few into his mouth. “You’ll wake the whole village.”

We waited. Nothing. I knocked again, more gently this time. After a long moment, the door creaked open a few inches. A middle-aged man with wary eyes stared out at us, the details of his face hidden by the bright glow behind him. All I could make out was a shock of messy hair and a coarse, gray shirt.

We quickly explained our situation, plastering apologetic smiles on our faces. He didn’t say a word, just stared with a furrowed brow before his gruff voice finally broke the silence. “Go find the village chief.”

He slipped out, pulling the door shut behind him. In that brief moment, I glimpsed others inside—a figure lying on a bed, and what looked like yellowish, withered peanut shells scattered on the floor. Before I could process it, the man beckoned us to follow him and led us to another house.

The village chief, an old man with a stony face, was clearly reluctant to let us stay. “You can stay the night,” he said, his voice void of any warmth. “But you leave tomorrow.”

He showed us to an empty room. When Fang Heguang asked if there was a phone we could use, he just pointed to the oil lamp sitting on the bedside table. The quilts on the bed were musty and old, so we opted to sleep in our sleeping bags instead.

“This isn’t right,” Heguang whispered once we were alone. “Where’s the legendary mountain village hospitality? The food, the liquor, the pretty maidens?”

“Stories also say isolated villages are haunted,” I shot back, only half-joking. “Be grateful we have a roof over our heads. And turn off your phone to save battery, there’s no signal or electricity here it seems.”

Despite my exhaustion, sleep didn’t come easy. I tossed and turned, the oppressive silence of the village seeping into my bones. Sometime in the dead of night, I heard Heguang get up. I thought I heard him whispering to someone outside, but I was too deep in a haze of fatigue to be sure.

The next morning, Heguang was sick. He had a raging fever and was shivering uncontrollably. We weren’t going anywhere. I gave him some medicine from our first-aid kit and some food we had left, and that helped soothe him temporarily. The chief’s expression hardened when I told him we had to stay. He offered no help, just a cold glare that said, *get out*.

Now, in the daylight, I noticed something deeply unsettling about him. His hair was white, but his skin was smooth and unnaturally pale, with a faint, waxy sheen, like polished ivory. It wasn’t the sun-beaten skin of a man who’d lived his life in the mountains.

I spent the day wandering the village waiting for Heguang to hopefully get well enough so we can get the hell out of there. I didn’t see many people and no one seemed to be working. I saw no farmland or orchards. A few villagers sat outside their homes, smoking pipes with blank expressions, their movements stiff and slow. It was unnervingly still. The whole place felt like it was holding its breath. I sat by the village well, smoking a cigarette to curb my hunger, and suddenly felt a chill creep up my spine despite the midday sun. I couldn't help but recall my joke from the night before about haunted villages.

I also noticed that all the adults here had the same strange, pale, flawless skin as the chief. The children, however, were the opposite. Their skin was sallow and rough, almost pitted, as if they had survived smallpox. I tried to rationalize it—perhaps a hereditary disease, a result of isolation and intermarriage. It made sense. It had to.

That afternoon, Heguang woke up, delirious and still in no condition to leave. He told me that when he’d gone out last night, he’d met a man by the village well. A handsome man named Mr. Song, who was eating peanuts by the light of an oil lamp. He explained that he was hungry and his craving kicked in so he asked for some. Mr. Song was kind enough to give him a handful and then some to bring back. They chatted for a while figuring that's when he caught a cold or something.

His story sounded like it was pulled straight from a book of ghost tales. A man eating peanuts by a well in the dead of night all alone? Isn’t that strange and creepy as hell? My mind was racing and my sense of dread was back, stronger than before.

At dusk, the middle-aged man from the lit house last night came to see the chief. Feeling suspicious, I hid behind my bedroom door, peeking through a crack. They spoke in low voices, but I could see joyful smiles on their faces. It was the first time I’d seen anyone in this village smile. As the man was leaving, the chief spoke a little louder, and I caught his words clearly: “Your grandfather is the oldest; he has gone through it the most times. His successful passage sets a good precedent. Tonight is your third son's first time, I’m sure he’ll do fine. After he has passed through, I’ll come to see you.”

*Passed through?* Passed through what?

I split the last rations of whatever food I could find between us for dinner and when I heard the chief come out of his room, I decided to catch him and asked about the elusive “Mr. Song”. His expression changed drastically. He stared at me, his eyes wide. “You’ve seen Mr. Song?”

“I haven't,” I said quickly, intimidated by his gaze. “But my friend said he hung out him last night by the well and they had a chat over some peanuts.”

“He ate Mr. Song’s peanuts?” The chief’s voice was a choked whisper after hearing what I said. His eyes widened with a look of horrified resignation. He stared at me, then at the closed door to my room where Heguang lay sleeping. After a long moment, he sighed, a deep, shuddering breath. "This is fate," he murmured, his previous hostility replaced by a look of profound pity.

That night, I couldn't sleep. The chief’s words echoed in my head. Around midnight, I slipped out of the house. I had to know what was going on. The village was as silent as a graveyard, but a single light was on—the same house from the night before. Drawn by a morbid curiosity I couldn’t fight, I crept up to the window and peered through a crack in the curtain.

My blood ran cold.

On one bed lay a person whose skin was a perfect, pale white, like a jade statue. But everyone’s attention was on the other bed. On it lay a humanoid *thing*. It had the basic shape of a person, but its limbs were fused to its torso. Its entire surface was a withered, yellowy-brown, covered in pits, like a giant, human-shaped peanut.

As I watched, frozen in horror, a faint *crack* echoed from the thing. Fissures spread across its shell. It was breaking open. Slowly, grotesquely, the shell flaked away, revealing a crimson form underneath—a writhing figure wrapped in a thin, red skin, like the papery film on a peanut kernel. A pair of arms, pale and delicate as lotus seeds, tore through the red membrane from the inside. A young man, naked and flawless, emerged, gasping.

These people weren't sick. It looked like they were being reborn. They were shedding their shells. They were some kind of humanoid peanut.

I stumbled back from the window, my heart hammering against my ribs, and turned to run. I ran straight into the village chief. He was standing right behind me, his face grim.

He told me everything. They couldn’t explain it but it was like a curse or some kind of unknown disease that had plagued their village for generations. Children were born normal, but as they aged, their skin would harden and crack until they became a living shell. Before adulthood, they would have to "pass through"—shedding their shell and red skin to emerge anew. This horrific rebirth happened every ten years. Failure meant death and not many survived each time. Mr. Song was the only one who never had to pass through, and no one knew who, or what, he was. I finally understood our inhospitable experience. They wanted us to leave to protect us from catching whatever it was they had.

“Your friend ate Mr. Song’s peanuts,” the chief said, his voice heavy with sorrow. “It’s too late for him now.”

I didn’t want to believe it. I burst back into our room. Heguang was still curled up in his sleeping bag. “Heguang, we have to go! Now!” I yelled, shaking him violently.

“Li Hou, you have to go,” he moaned from inside the bag, his voice muffled and strained. “Leave me. Run.”

Ignoring him, I grabbed the zipper on his sleeping bag and yanked it down.

I will never be able to erase the image from my mind. His body was covered in small, finger-sized holes. The flesh around them was dark red, but it didn’t bleed. And nestled inside each horrifying pit was a single, perfect peanut kernel. His body was becoming a host.

I screamed and scrambled backward, tripping over my own feet. The man from the first night was blocking the door. There was no escape. But as he lunged for me, a sudden, primal terror gave me strength. I grabbed the heavy oil lamp from the table and threw it at him with everything I had. It struck him in the head with a sickening thud, and he staggered back.

I didn’t wait to see the consequences. I bolted out the door and into the night. I was in full on flight mode. I ran without looking back, ignoring the shouts behind me. I ran until my lungs burned and my legs gave out but eventually, I found my way back to civilization. I stormed into the nearest local police station and told them I’d gotten separated from my friend in the woods and he needed immediate medical attention. I didn't recount the actual story to them or they would’ve thought I was crazy or was on something. I needed them to act fast so I could at least try and save Heguang somehow. I escorted them to approximately where we had found the village but as daylight broke, there was nothing there. They searched for weeks after but never found a trace of Heguang or the village. It was like it had never existed.

But I know it did. I know because sometimes I wake up in a cold sweat with the phantom taste of peanuts in my mouth. I know because sometimes I could hear the cracking and crunching of peanuts as if Mr. Song was right there beside by ear. And I know because of my skin. It’s getting drier and rougher by the [day](https://www.reddit.com/user/General_Escape1288/comments/1l9xw34/insomnia_series_season_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
