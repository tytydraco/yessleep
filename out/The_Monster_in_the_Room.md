Q: Please state your full name for the record.  
A: (sniffles) S-Samantha Ellen Reeves.  
Q: Age?  
A: (voice trembling) Thirty-two.  
Q: Address?  
A: \[REDACTED\], Farmville, Virginia.  
  
Q: You understand why you’re here, Mrs. Reeves?  
A: (shaky breath) Because… my husband is dead.  
  
Q: Mrs. Reeves, we just want to understand what happened.  
A: (eyes welling up) We were in the living room after dinner, watching TV like we always do. Then—the window… it just burst open, and this—(her voice falters, eyes widening)—this thing squeezed through.  
  
Q: What do you mean by "thing"?  
A: (barely above a whisper) It wasn’t human. Tall, gaunt, its limbs too long… James—he told me to run. (chokes back a sob) So I did. And then I heard… (voice breaks) the noises… Oh, God, the noises.  
  
(Subject begins sobbing. Interview paused at 11:55 PM.)  
(Resume at 12:10 AM.)  
  
Q: Mrs. Reeves, I understand this is difficult, but we need you to help us. Please, describe the creature to me in as much detail as you can.  
A: (voice trembling) It… it wasn’t like anything I’ve ever seen. The skin was so pale, almost sickly, like it hadn’t seen the sun in… forever. And its eyes… (swallows hard) they were black, like endless pits, and… and it stared at me.  
  
Q: Did it speak to you? Did it say anything?  
A: (shakes head) No. It didn’t speak, it… it just moved. It wasn’t walking—more like it was gliding across the floor, like it didn’t even need to touch the ground.  
  
Q: And your husband—James—what happened to him?  
A: (choking back sobs) He tried to fight it off. He… he grabbed the lamp, but it was like it didn’t even feel the blows. (pauses, visibly struggling) I heard him scream. It… it didn’t sound like him. It was so… so wrong.  
  
Q: You said you heard noises when you ran to the bathroom—what kind of noises?  
A: (voice cracks) It was… like someone… someone was being torn apart. I—I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even look. I just… hid. I thought if I stayed quiet, maybe it wouldn’t find me.  
  
Q: And then what?  
A: (takes a shaky breath) Then it— (pauses, trembles) then it just stopped. Everything went quiet. For a while, I thought… I thought maybe it had left. I didn’t dare leave the bathroom until… until the police showed up.  
  
Q: Mrs. Reeves… the house—it’s empty. We didn’t find any signs of forced entry or… anything unusual, aside from the broken window. And… there’s no trace of your husband.  
A: (blinks in confusion) What…? What do you mean? I—I saw him! He was there, he was screaming, and then… (her face pales as realization sets in) Oh my god. Oh god… he’s gone.  
  
Q: We need you to stay calm, Mrs. Reeves.  
A: (gripping the table) It wasn’t supposed to happen like this. It wasn’t supposed to happen to us. (her voice barely a whisper) What… what is that thing?  
  
Q: Mrs. Reeves… (pauses, voice softens) we don’t know yet. But we’ll find out.  
  
(Subject begins crying again. Interview paused at 12:20 AM.)  
(Resume at 01:00 AM)  
  
A: (takes a deep breath, reaches for the glass of water, and drinks slowly) I’m ready... I’ll try to tell you everything I remember.  
Q: Thank you, Mrs. Reeves. (glances at the glass, then back at her) Take your time.  
  
A: (sets the glass down, hands trembling) James and I... we’ve been together since middle school. You already know that, Harold.  
Q: (leans forward slightly, glancing at the glass, voice firm but gentle) Mrs. Reeves, I know we’ve known each other a long time, but for now, let’s keep this professional. I want to help you find out what happened to James... Sammy. But I need you to cooperate with me.  
  
A: (nods, wiping her eyes) Thanks... Detective.  
Q: (pauses, softening his tone) Tell me about your relationship with James. What was it like?  
  
A: (takes a shaky breath) He’s my husband. We’ve been married for sixteen years... since 2008.  
Q: That was a tough time to get married. The recession, the war... it couldn’t have been easy.  
A: (nods) It wasn’t. But we made it work. I was working two jobs, and James... he was in Iraq. At least, I think it was Iraq?  
  
Q: (nods) It was Iraq.  
A: (stares at the table, lost in thought) Yeah... Iraq. When he came back, we saved up and bought our home in 2013. It was supposed to be our fresh start.  
  
Q: (pauses, choosing his words carefully) Did you ever have any... serious arguments? Anything that might’ve caused tension between you two?  
A: (shakes her head firmly) No, never. We argued sometimes, like any couple, but it was never... violent. I loved him, and he loved me. (voice cracks) He was my everything.  
  
Q: (offers a small, sympathetic smile) I know he was, Sammy.  
A: (looks up, tears welling in her eyes) We were just sitting there after dinner, talking about the election. Everything was normal. And then... (trails off, voice breaking) How did it all go so wrong?  
  
Q: (sighs, leaning back in his chair) Sometimes, Mrs. Reeves, things happen that we can’t explain. As much as I want to let you rest and recover, I need you to keep going. We need to figure this out.  
A: (nods, wiping her face with her sleeve) I understand. I’ll... I’ll keep going.  
(01:20 AM)  
  
Q: Did you hear anything outside the bathroom after James told you to hide there?  
A: (nods, voice trembling) Yes... I heard a struggle. I think James was trying to fight it off. There was something loud—like glass shattering—and then... (pauses, swallowing hard) I heard gunshots.  
  
Q: (leans forward, frowning) Gunshots?  
A: (nods again, more emphatically) Yes. I heard gunshots.  
  
Q: (sighs, flipping through his notes) Right... We found your husband’s pistol at the scene. He emptied the entire magazine.  
A: (blinks, confused) What does that mean?  
  
Q: (pauses, studying her carefully) It means he fired every round. (stands up) I’ll be back.  
  
(Interview paused at 01:25 AM)  
(Resume at 01:30 AM)  
  
Q: Mrs. Reeves, you told us James told you to hide in the bathroom while he tried to fight it off. But we noticed you have some... bruises on you. Can you explain that?  
A: (looks down, avoiding his gaze) Why— Oh... I... don’t know.  
  
Q: (raises an eyebrow) You don’t know?  
A: (shifts uncomfortably in her seat, face flushing) I... Okay, this is embarrassing to say out loud, but... (takes a deep breath) We had just finished... you know, being intimate... before dinner.  
  
Q: (clears his throat, visibly uncomfortable) Oh. I see. (pauses, regaining his composure) Alright then. Let’s move on.  
  
(01:32 AM)  
  
Q: (glances at the water glass on the table again, raises an eyebrow, then turns back to Samantha) Mrs. Reeves, you said the house was broken into through the window... Is that correct?  
A: (nods, avoiding his gaze) Yes... (looks down at her hands, which are trembling slightly).  
  
Q: (stands up, his chair scraping against the floor) I’m going to step out for just a moment, Mrs. Reeves. I’ll be right back.  
A: (whispers) Okay...  
  
(Detective Denton exits the interrogation room and approaches his colleague, Officer Ramirez, who is reviewing the evidence in the adjacent observation room.)  
  
Denton: (keeps his voice low) What do we have so far?  
Ramirez: (hands him a file) The pistol was a Beretta M9, standard issue. Fifteen rounds in the magazine, all fired. We found Mrs. Reeves in the bathroom, just like she said. But... (pauses, glancing at the one-way mirror) there’s no sign of James. No body, no blood, nothing. It’s like he just... vanished.  
  
Denton: (frowns, flipping through the file) And the window?  
Ramirez: (leans in, lowering his voice) That’s the weird part. The glass fragments—they’re outside the house, not inside. If the window was broken from the outside, the glass should’ve been scattered inward. But it’s the opposite. It’s like... something broke it from the inside.  
  
Denton: (narrows his eyes) You’re saying the window was broken from the inside?Ramirez: (nods) Exactly. And there’s no sign of forced entry anywhere else. No footprints, no fingerprints, nothing. It’s like whatever got in... didn’t come through the window at all.  
Denton: (rubs his temples, exhaling sharply) This doesn’t make sense. She’s clearly traumatized, but the evidence... it’s not adding up.  
  
Ramirez: (glances at the interrogation room) You think she’s lying?  
Denton: (shakes his head) I don’t know. But something’s off. Keep digging. I’m going back in.  
(02:30AM)  
  
(Denton re-enters the interrogation room, his expression unreadable. He sits down across from Samantha, who looks up at him with red-rimmed eyes.)  
  
Q: (nods, his expression grim) I understand. This is a lot to process, but we’re going to find out what happened. I promise you that. (pauses, glancing at the glass of water on the table. He notices it hasn’t been touched since he refilled it earlier. His eyes narrow slightly.)  
A: (notices his glance, quickly looks away, her voice trembling) Detective... I just want to know if he suffered. Please, tell me he didn’t suffer.  
  
Q: (leans back in his chair, studying her carefully) Mrs. Reeves... can I ask you something? You’ve been here for hours now. You haven’t eaten, you haven’t drunk anything. Aren’t you thirsty?A: (freezes for a split second, then forces a weak smile) I... I’m just not hungry. Or thirsty. I’m too upset to think about that right now.  
  
Q: (nods slowly, his tone casual but probing) I get that. Grief can do that to a person. But you’ve been through a lot. You should at least have some water. (pushes the glass closer to her) It’ll help.  
A: (glances at the glass, then back at him, her smile faltering) I... I’m fine, really. I just want to focus on finding out what happened to James.  
  
Q: (leans forward again, his gaze sharpening) Mrs. Reeves, humor me. Take a sip. It’s just water.  
A: (hesitates, her hands trembling as she reaches for the glass. She lifts it slowly, her eyes darting to Denton, then to the one-way mirror. She brings it to her lips but doesn’t drink, setting it back down.) I... I can’t. I’m sorry. I just can’t.  
  
Q: (narrows his eyes, his voice dropping to a quieter, more intense tone) Why can’t you, Mrs. Reeves? It’s just water.  
A: (looks down, her voice breaking) I... I don’t know. I just feel sick. My stomach’s in knots. I can’t keep anything down right now.  
  
Q: (pauses, then leans back, his tone shifting to something colder) Funny. You didn’t seem sick earlier when you were describing what happened. You were very... detailed. Very precise. But now, when it comes to something as simple as drinking water, you’re suddenly too upset?A: (looks up, her eyes wide and pleading) Detective, I don’t understand why you’re pushing this. I just lost my husband. I’m not... I’m not in the right state of mind for this.  
  
Q: (ignores her deflection, his voice steady) Mrs. Reeves, let’s go back to the window for a moment. You said the creature came through it. But the glass fragments... they were outside the house. Not inside. That suggests the window was broken from the inside. Care to explain that?A: (shifts uncomfortably, her voice rising slightly) I don’t know! I told you, everything happened so fast. Maybe I’m wrong about the window. Maybe it came through the door. I don’t know!  
Q: (raises an eyebrow) The door? You didn’t mention a door earlier. You were very specific about the window.  
  
A: (clenches her fists, her voice trembling with frustration) I don’t know what you want from me! I’m trying to remember, but it’s all a blur. I was scared out of my mind!  
Q: (leans forward, his voice low and deliberate) Mrs. Reeves... let me ask you something else. When we found you in the bathroom, you were... calm. Too calm. Most people in your situation would’ve been hysterical. But you were just sitting there. Almost like you were waiting for us.  
  
A: (stares at him, her expression hardening for a split second before she forces it back into one of grief) I was in shock, Detective. You don’t know what it’s like to go through something like that. I was numb. I still am.  
Q: (nods slowly, his eyes never leaving hers) Maybe. Or maybe you’re not what you seem. (pauses, then drops his voice to a near whisper) Mrs. Reeves... what are you?  
  
A: (freezes, her eyes flickering with something dark and unreadable. Then, just as quickly, she crumples into tears, her voice breaking) How can you say that to me? After everything I’ve been through? My husband is dead, and you’re accusing me of... of what? Being some kind of monster?  
Q: (doesn’t flinch, his voice steady) I’m not accusing you of anything. Yet. But the evidence doesn’t add up. The window. The gunshots. The fact that James’s body was found miles away, drained of blood. And now this... (gestures to the untouched glass of water). So I’ll ask you again. What are you?  
  
A: (stops crying abruptly, her face going eerily still. She looks at him, her eyes glinting with something inhuman. Then, slowly, she smiles—a cold, predatory smile.) Detective... you really don’t want to know.  
((Detective Denton clicks a button under the table. The door to the interrogation room opens, and another officer enters, armed and standing ready near the door. Denton doesn’t take his eyes off Samantha.)  
Q: (his voice calm but firm) Mrs. Reeves... what happened to your husband? What happened to James Reeves?  
  
A: (her voice rising in panic) I told you! I don’t know what happened!  
Q: (leans forward, his tone sharpening) So, let’s go over this again. At first, you told me you were having dinner together, and this tall, gaunt... thing came into your home through the window. James told you to hide, and you did. You heard noises—ripping, gunshots, shattering glass. But here’s the thing, Mrs. Reeves. There’s no blood at the scene. None. Just an emptied pistol, a broken lamp, and a window with glass fragments outside the house. And now you’re telling me it all happened so fast that you can’t remember? (pauses, his gaze piercing) That doesn’t add up.  
A: (clutches her chest, her voice breaking) How could you... how could you do this to me? I don’t know what’s going on! Am I being accused? Oh my God... (her voice rises to a hysterical pitch) You think I killed my husband?  
  
Q: (doesn’t flinch, his voice steady) I think you’re not telling me the whole truth. And I think you know exactly what happened to James.  
A: (stands up abruptly, her chair scraping against the floor) This is insane! I loved him! I would never hurt him! (her voice cracks, and she collapses back into the chair, sobbing) He was everything to me...  
  
Q: (glances at the armed officer, then back at Samantha, his tone softening slightly) Mrs. Reeves, I’m not saying you hurt him. But I need you to be honest with me. If you didn’t kill him, then who—or what—did?  
A: (looks up at him, her tear-streaked face pale and drawn) I told you! It was that thing! That... that creature! I don’t know what it was, but it wasn’t human! (her voice drops to a whisper) It wasn’t human...  
  
Q: (leans back, his expression unreadable) And yet, there’s no evidence of this creature. No footprints, no traces, nothing. Just you, Mrs. Reeves. Just you.  
A: (stares at him, her eyes wide and desperate) You think I’m lying? You think I made this up? (her voice trembles with a mix of anger and fear) Why would I do that? Why would I make up something so horrible?  
  
Q: (leans forward, his voice low and deliberate) Mrs. Reeves, I have reason to believe that you’re not... telling me the whole story. (he subtly nudges his colleague, gesturing toward the glass of water on the table. The colleague glances at it, then freezes.)  
A: (notices their exchange but doesn’t react, her voice trembling) I... please tell me... how am I not telling the whole story? I’m telling you the truth... everything I know.  
  
Q: (ignores her plea, his tone sharpening) Mrs. Reeves... what is your birthday?  
A: (blinks, caught off guard) I... huh? Why... are you asking me that?  
  
Q: (his voice firm, almost cold) Please answer the question.  
A: (hesitates, her brow furrowing) December 2nd... 1992.  
Q: (nods slowly, his gaze never leaving hers) And how old were you in 2008?  
  
A: (pauses, her expression flickering with confusion) Um... Twenty-one?  
Q: (leans back, his voice steady but laced with suspicion) You were sixteen.  
  
A: (stares at him, her face paling) That’s not... huh? (she trails off, her voice faltering as she realizes her mistake.)  
  
(03:00 AM)  
  
Q: (his voice low, almost a growl) Samantha Reeves... no. What are you? Who are you?  
  
(Samantha sits back in her chair, her tear-streaked face shifting into something cold and calculating. The trembling, grief-stricken widow vanishes, replaced by a predator. She smiles—a slow, unnerving smile that doesn’t reach her eyes.)  
A: (her voice calm, almost amused) Finally asking the right questions, Detective. Took you long enough.  
  
Q: (his jaw tightens, his hand instinctively moving toward his holstered weapon) What the hell are you?  
A: (leans forward, her eyes glinting with a predatory light) What do you think I am, Harold? You’ve already figured out most of it. The reflection. The age. The... inconsistencies. (she tilts her head, her smile widening) But let me save you the trouble. James didn’t die because of some monster breaking into our home. I killed him. I drained him. And then... (she licks her lips, her voice dropping to a whisper) I ate him.  
  
Q: (stares at her, his face pale but his voice steady) You’re lying. You’re trying to mess with me.  
A: (chuckles darkly) Oh, I’m not lying. James and I were having dinner, just not the kind you’re thinking of. He was the main course. (her tone becomes almost conversational) He fought back, though. I’ll give him that. Emptied his entire magazine into me. Hurt like hell, but... (she shrugs) what can I say? Immortality has its perks.  
  
Q: (his voice tight with barely contained anger) You’re a monster.  
A: (smirks) Maybe. But I’m a monster who’s been sitting right under your nose this whole time. And you had no idea. (she leans back, her tone mocking) Poor, grieving Samantha. The victim. The widow. You bought it all, didn’t you?  
  
Q: (glances at his colleague, who’s gripping his weapon tightly, then back at Samantha) Why? Why kill him? Why... eat him?  
A: (her expression darkens, her voice losing its playful edge) Because I was hungry. Because I could. Because... (she pauses, her eyes narrowing) he was starting to suspect. He noticed things. The way I never ate. The way I never aged. He was getting too close. So I did what I had to do.  
  
Q: (his voice shakes with rage) You’re sick. You’re a goddamn animal.  
A: (laughs, a cold, hollow sound) And yet, here I am, sitting across from you, while James is... well, let’s just say he’s not sitting anywhere. (she stands up abruptly, her chair scraping against the floor) But enough chit-chat. I think it’s time we end this little interrogation.  
  
(The armed officer raises his weapon, but Samantha moves faster than either of them can react. In a blur of motion, she’s across the room, her hand closing around the officer’s throat. He fires his weapon, but the bullets tear through the wall as she slams him into it with inhuman strength.)  
  
Q: (draws his own weapon, his voice sharp) Let him go! Now!  
A: (glances at Denton, her grip tightening on the officer’s throat) Or what, Harold? You’ll shoot me? (she smirks) We both know how that ends.  
  
(Before Denton can react, Samantha snaps the officer’s neck with a sickening crack. She drops his lifeless body to the floor and turns to Denton, her eyes glowing with a predatory light.)  
  
A: (her voice soft, almost gentle) Don’t worry, Detective. I’ll make it quick. You’ve been... entertaining.  
  
(Denton fires his weapon, the shots echoing in the small room. Samantha staggers back, her body jerking with the impact, but she doesn’t fall. She smiles, blood staining her teeth, and takes a step toward him.)  
  
A: (her voice a low growl) Like I said... immortality has its perks.  
  
(Samantha stands over Denton, her eyes glowing with a predatory light. Her lips curl into a cold, vicious smile as she leans down, her voice a low growl.)  
  
A: Don’t worry, Detective. I’ll make it quick. You’ve been... entertaining.  
(Denton, barely conscious, tries to reach for his weapon, but his movements are sluggish. Samantha’s hand closes around his throat, her grip like iron. Just as she’s about to deliver the final blow—)
