The year was…let me think…uh…oh yeah…  
The year was 1995, in August somewhere between the 15th and 17th. My 2 friends, David and Aaron, and I went camping at a camping site in Greenhill Riverside.  
  
 “I don’t know about this place,” David said, “I always heard bad things happen here and…” David was a cautious guy and he always looked both ways before crossing. He was looking at the map of the state and biting his nails a bit, while we all sat at the island bar, David sat beside the window. “Shut up, big pussy \*Aaron said and laughed afterward\*” Aaron was the cocky, all ‘tough’ guy, and for a weird reason liked to explore bad situations that no sane person would do. Aaron was playing with a 2 of spades card from boredom. ”Hey, shut up Aaron or I’ll tell Jessica that you’ll date a Jock instead of her.” I said sarcastically, as I put away my phone into my pocket. “You wouldn’t because you’ll be dead by the time I get my hands on you.” He said with a smirk and placed the card down.  
  
David sat at the bar with us, “Seriously though, like what if something happens and when need someone to come over, and since it’s a far place from people and..” “David, you’re overthinking it, how long ago since something happened there?” I said as I cracked my back. “All I heard from it was a mutilated body from 12 years ago…” Aaron said as he stared at the card. “You’re always edgy, I can’t tell if you’re just making that up or something else,” I said while getting up from the table to get some SunnyD. Aaron gave me a hateful glare, then looked back at his card.  
  
 “...” I tried lighting the mood, “Hey David, How’s Sam?”  
David gave a surprised look before going back to his confused face like he did. “Oh she’s..been a.., a bitch” he said and he took a screw and twiddled with it. “Huh? Why I-I thought you guys were a good couple.” I said. They’ve been a good couple since June, and it looked like everything was turning out good for David for once. “Yeah, but she’d like…she ditched me for Winston…that horny bastard-jock guy…’ know who I’m talking about?” He said as he stared at me.  
  
 “Oh, Winston? Pft, he’s the stupidest man I've ever seen from…well any jock at the high school,” I said with annoyance, he was like talking to a brick wall. Trying to be friends with him was like trying to be friends with a wall. “I’m friends with him…he’s not far from what you said…” Aaron replied and picked the card up.  
  
 I poured myself a glass of orange juice. “Sorry for bringing that up David,” I said. “It’s fine, I’m already past that…it’s just…what I did wrong...I don’t what I did for her to leave me..” David said. “Maybe ‘cause you can’t stop being an introvert?” Aaron said, crossing his arms with the card between his fingers. “Ok, stop trying to have a pissing contest Aaron”…” What is Krisha doin’ this weekend?” I said as I finished my glass. “I don’t know, she’s probably going to have another party like every Friday this week…what did you expect, Caleb?” Aaron said and licked his teeth. “Yeah, she does the same thing…” David added.   
  
“Ok…so when are we going to that campsite?” I asked, “I don’t know…” Aaron said, “I want to go, but why Greenhill? As I said, lots of freaky-deeky shit was going on at the place…” David said, after a moment he started to bite his nails again. “It’s fine! The plan’s simple. We stay there a day or 2, and…just have a good time.” I said as I finished it off with a shrug.  
  
Aaron was never a wimp, he always acted so vigorously and had a constant personality over the years. He still acts the same. I remember when he spent a day spray-painting penises under the highway from SawRoad and Hilltonvile, just because he felt like it. He had no remorse or anything guilty.   
  
“Aaron, I think we should go…” I said, hopping for a straight yes or no answer, “Sure, I don’t give a rat's tail…” Aaron said. “Oh, so I see you’ve been trying to keep your cursing down ever since you went to that church in SawRoad huh?” I said smirking, “Yeah, it ain’t me though…I just got numb to it so I can still get the free food they serve without getting kicked out…” Ironically, the sun from the blinds got a bit brighter. “It’s hell, \*he laughs a bit\*” …Yeah I think we should go on Friday tomorrow…how’s that David?” I said. “Sure. I don’t have anything to do over weekends anyways…”   
  
There was an awkward silence as I tried to think of something to say or do. The light of the sun made the kitchen where the island bar sits more lit. It was always dimly lit in the kitchen like it was straight from a 2000’s horror movie. The kitchen was small and the island sat in the middle, it was made from marble as well as the countertops were. After a while, David and Aaron decided to leave for the night,  
  
After 2 hours, after we agreed to go on Friday, I sat in my room. My lamp makes the room lit and the corners dark. I was watching a documentary about the Spectites, pale monsters is what it's translated to.  
I stayed up, did my homework, and fell asleep in the middle of work.
