I had just wrapped work on a Friday night, when my wife, Cara, first told me about the ad.

"I don't know how long I can work for this guy anymore." I said to her, closing my laptop for the weekend.

"Alan?" She replied.

"Yeah. He's such a prick. Everything's urgent, and everything's a fire drill. Until he doesn't care about it anymore."

"You know what you should do?"

"What?"

"Kick his ass."

"I wish. But you know full well that I don't have a threatening bone in my body. I'm a lover not a fighter." I said with a wink.

"Oh, that reminds me! Speaking of lovers."  My wife said with a smile, pulling out her phone. "Look at this."

Taking the phone from her hand, I saw that she had saved a job posting.

"New Reality Series Seeks Married Couples For Chance To Win Once In A Lifetime Prize."

At first, I scoffed at it. Having been happily married for a few years now, and both of us gainfully employed, I was pretty confident that neither my wife nor I sought money or fame. We already had everything a couple could ever want.

"Why would we ever go on a reality show?" I asked.

"Keep reading," Cara replied, pointing to the bottom of the posting.

I did as she suggested.

"The winning couple will receive a once in a lifetime chance to work with one of the best fertility doctors in the world, to aid them in having a child."

Okay, maybe we didn't quite have everything a couple could want.

I looked at my wife. "Enticing, yes. But I mean, what are the chances we'd actually get cast?"

"Hey, you can't win if you don't play, right?" Cara replied, "And what other choice do we have?"

She had a point. We'd been trying to conceive for a few years, but no matter the approach, whether natural, IUI, or IVF, you name it, the outcome was always the same.

It was the one thing we didn't have. The one thing, save for surrogacy or adoption, that money couldn't buy...

...Having a child of our own.

And so...

...The next day, we reached out to the production company's nondescript email address...

...A couple days later, we heard back...

...And a week later, we found ourselves on a video call with a casting director, attempting to sell her on why they should choose us as one of the five couples competing in their pilot, and why we deserved the prize.

But my wife and I both left the meeting thinking we botched it, each of us walking away with the same feeling that one gets after a flubbed job interview.

And so, we both resolved to go back to our lives. Back to being realistic about the situation. And even started looking into some adoption agencies.

That is, until a week later, when Cara and I received an  email from the production company...

...Informing us that we were selected to participate in the reality show pilot!

A few signed contracts, NDAs, and talent release forms later, and my wife and I were off on an all-expense paid trip to Los Angeles.

I remember pulling into the parking lot of the production studio that first day, and finding it a bit strange that a TV show would be filmed in such a rundown, dilapidated warehouse. But I knew nothing about production, and chalked it up to budgetary constraints. And, after all, we had already traveled too far, and there was too much on the line, to turn back now.

Upon entering the building's lobby, we were immediately welcomed in by the show's producer, Phil, whose warm greeting through his medical mask, quickly turned sour, "You're late! Literally the last couple to arrive! Hurry, hurry! Follow me! We're about to start!"

I thought it a bit rude, and noticed a concerned look wash over Cara's face. But then I remembered it was our fault, after all, that we underestimated LA traffic, so I bit my tongue.

Phil then confiscated both of our cell phones, before escorting us out of the lobby, down a long hallway, around a corner, and into a massive lounge, lit by professional lights, with five couches scattered about. Four of which were occupied by other couples, who were sitting there, patiently waiting, when we finally entered the room.

"So sorry!" I called out to them, while simultaneously waving "Hello," as I sat down in one of the loveseats.

"Thanks for your patience!" Cara added, as she took a seat beside me.

But our peers and competitors didn't even have a chance to react, as Phil suddenly ran into the room with a similarly masked production crew of about ten individuals, and got right down to business.

I thought it strange that they were all masked, assuming that covid regulations had long ended, but before I could dwell on the details too much, Phil yelled out, "Alright, places people! Sound!"

"Speed!" A few masked sound guys yelled back, as they hit record on their audio devices and aimed their boom microphones at the front of the room.

"Camera!" Phil continued.

"Speeding!" Several masked camera men replied, in unison, each carrying a broadcast camera on their shoulder.

"Slate!" Phil added, as a masked production assistant ran up to the front of the room, where there was a set of two doors on the far wall, and a door to the side that must have led offstage. He then opened his clapboard, for all of the cameras and microphones to see and hear.

I wondered why they hadn't filled out the section on the clapboard where the first take would go, but my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of it clapping.

CLAP!

Then Phil gestured to what must have been the director, who was hanging back in the shadows, his features hidden in the dark, outside of the set's bright lights.

"Action!" The director yelled out for all to hear.

And then...

...There was silence.

All of us couples looked at each other with a smile, literally on the edge of our seats, when suddenly, we heard the voice of a middle aged man ring out over the speakers that had been mounted to the ceiling of the lounge. "Ladies and gentlemen! Who's excited to make history?"

The cameras turned to the ten participants, including Cara and myself, and we all immediately started clapping and whistling, before they turned back to the man.

"I'm your anonymous host, four time husband, and five time divorcee!"

The group erupted in laughter, cheering him on, as they looked up at the speakers.

"And you know what? I'm not proud of that. Cause, much like you, deep down inside, I want to love and be loved. To have the fortitude, the patience, and the will to fight on through good times and bad, all in the name of love. Which is why I've brought you all here. Yes, you! Give yourselves a round of applause!" He said, before pausing to allow us all to react.

And so we did, all the couples clapping and smiling.

"Yes, I'm here, hosting and watching remotely, to learn from the five happily married couples before us, what the secret is to persevering through the challenges that life throws our way. To see what ends you'll all go to in support of your marriage, and if you'll do... anything for love. Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome... to Anything For Love."

Everyone let out a nervous laugh, but kept applauding anyway.

"And now... it's time for the rules. In this reality competition, the first of its kind, you'll be split up into two groups, five men and five women, and separated from each other for the duration of the game. Over the course of the show, both teams will compete in four challenges, with each challenge resulting in one loser, who will be promptly eliminated. At the end of the game, the winning player from each team will be revealed. If those two players are not members of the same couple, then no one wins. But if those two players happen to be members of the same couple, they win the game, and a once in a lifetime prize... The chance to work with one of the best fertility doctors in the world, to aid them in having a child. So before we begin, let me ask you this... Are you prepared to do anything for love?"

His voice blasted out from the speakers with so much enthusiasm, and so much energy, that in that moment, every single one of us hopped up out of our seats, and began cheering and clapping.

Eventually, the applause faded, and our host continued, "Now, will the men please line up on the left side of the room, and the women on the right?"

The couples did exactly as he asked, and when we had finally split up into two groups, men and women, our host simply said. "Now goodluck! And I can't wait to see who makes it to the end!"

Suddenly, the two doors at the front of the room opened, and each group was escorted by a masked production assistant through one of the doors, separating the husbands from the wives, until that fateful moment at the end of the show, when only the two winners will be reunited.

For the first couple games, I didn't know where they took the wives, or what kind of challenges my own wife was facing. All I knew were the games they presented to us husbands.

Games that were, let's just say...

...Utterly fucked.

As all five men entered the room for the first game, we all saw before us, a massive open factory space, that had been adorned with only one simple piece of art direction at its center... a small wooden table.

"Will the contestants please make their way to the table." The host called out over this room's  ceiling-mounted speakers.

We did as he said, as the masked camera crew followed us to the center of the room.

"The rules of game one are simple. In marriage, you must sometimes sacrifice a piece of yourself, for the greater good. Today, that sacrifice... is your wedding ring. But not just your wedding ring... your entire ring finger!"

The five guys and myself all turned to one another and chuckled, assuming he was kidding.

But suddenly, a door opened into the factory, and a masked crew member proceeded to walk over to the table holding a steak knife.

He didn't say anything, and simply stared at us  through his mask, as the host continued.

"The last person to cut their finger off, or the first to give up, is the loser. And will be promptly escorted from the premises."

What the fuck. I thought to myself, realizing the host wasn't kidding.

"Wait a minute," a few of the men mumbled.

But one of them, the most obnoxious in the group, could not have been less afraid, puffing out his chest and yelling into a camera, "Fine! I'll go first. I aint afraid."

He then slammed his hand down on the table, clenching his fist in a way that only exposed his ring finger.

There was a brief moment of silence until...

...Suddenly the masked crew member grabbed the husband's hand and brought down his blade so hard, that it cut the man's finger clean off, blood spraying all over the table.

It took the arrogant man a moment to process what had just happened, before he started screaming in pain, a scream that turned into a maniacal laugh, as medical staff ran over to tend to his wound.

Meanwhile, the rest of us guys looked on in horror, as we saw blood pouring from his hand, and realized we were next.

The wounded husband then looked directly into one of the cameras and defiantly said, "That was nothing." Before turning back to us and asking, "Come on. Who's next fellas?"

Two more of the men begrudgingly followed suit, each of their ring fingers being severed from their hands, leaving just myself and one husband left.

We were both shaking in fear, but the other guy was terrified, that he started begging the producer for a way out. "Wait you can't be serious? We really need to do that? Please. Please don't make me.

"The show is called Anything For Love." Phil replied. "And you signed paperwork that warned you things like this would come up."

"I didn't read that!" The nervous man yelled back.

But before he even had a chance to consider participating, I must have accidentally leaned on the table with my hand.

"Wait!" The nervous man yelled out...

...But it was too late. Before either he or I noticed, the masked man had already amputated my ring finger, blood spraying everywhere, as I let out a great scream that echoed throughout the factory.

And as the medical staff ran over to me, just as they had done for the others who had gone before me, I heard the host's voice on the speakers again. "Congratulations, gentlemen! Four of you have shown that you'll do anything for love. While the fifth, did not have what it takes, and must now return home."

And like that, a couple masked production assistants grabbed the nervous man by the shoulders, and escorted him out of the room.

It was in the aftermath of that first game, that I realized the title of the show, "Anything For Love," was not just a play on words, but the literal description of what we would need to do to win.

And then, the host continued.

"Will the remaining four husbands please walk through the open door, and into the next room."

We did as he asked.

On the way there, I looked down at my missing finger, its stump wrapped in gauze, and couldn't help but wonder if Cara had also been forced to make the same choice, and if she had gone through with it.

When we entered the second room, we all saw another giant warehouse space. Except this time, instead of being sparse, it was completely overgrown with shrubs of thorny vines, separating where we stood, from the other side.

"Love is both a rose, but also has thorns." The host called out over the room's speakers. "It can make you feel euphoric pleasure, but at the same time extreme pain. In game two, you'll need to prove that you can overcome that pain to get to the other side, and make it to game three. The last person to crawl through the thorns, or the first person to give up, will be promptly eliminated from the show and removed from the premises. Will you do anything for love? The game starts... now."

The four husbands all looked at each other, then back at the thorns, then back at each other, before the arrogant man, who was standing beside me, made me a proposition. "Let's team up. If we follow the same path, we can take turns, one of us pushing forward for a while, then the other, and it'll save us half the pain.”

But I didn't like the idea of cheating, or supporting such an asshole, so I politely declined. "Sorry man."

"Fine, have it your way, idiot. I don't need your help, I was just trying to help him out." The arrogant man said to one of the cameras, before he turned around and charged into the thorns.

The rest of us husbands, including myself, still in shock from what had happened in the first game and clenching our wounded hands, looked at each other, and then back at the production crew. But a group of them were standing behind us, ready to push us into the thorns, should we decide not to comply.

So we all proceeded to follow the arrogant husband into the thorns, and began a race, through what felt like a football field's length of sharp vines, each of us doing our best to avoid what we could, but inevitably getting scratched over and over and over again, to the point where our bodies were covered in blood.

And when I finally crossed the finish line, and stepped out of the thorny shrubs bloody and exhausted, I was relieved to find that only two husbands had beat me there. The arrogant man, of course, and another.

We all looked back, to find the fourth pour soul still halfway through the shrubs, his clothes caught in the thorns.

"Wait for me!" He called out. But it was too late.

"Congratulations, winners!" The host's voice called out over the speakers. "You've proven you would truly do anything for love, and can proceed on to the next game. And as for the loser, please remove him from the game."

Then, a couple crew members wearing rubber suits and carrying shears, cut their way through the thorns, freed the fourth husband from the thorns, and escorted him out of the factory.

As the three remaining husbands left the second room and entered the third, my thoughts once again returned to my wife, and wondered whether she too was faced with the same challenge, and had made it through the thorns.

Game three is where things... escalated.

When we entered the next factory, I saw three beds in the center of the room, each with a TV next to it.

"Remaining contestants, welcome to the semi final challenge." The host bellowed out over the room's speakers. "Will you each please choose a bed."

The three of us did as he asked, and walked to the center of the room, each of us standing in front of one the beds.

Then, a door opened and three masked women emerged, making their way to the center of the room, and each lying down on one of the beds.

"The rules of game three are as follows." He continued. "You simply have to sex with the stranger before you..."

The arrogant husband looked at me and smiled.

"...While watching your partner do the same."

Suddenly, the three TVs turned on, each displaying our wives in the very same situation. And lying on each of their beds, was a masked man.

"First off, we assure you that the women and men before you complied consensually, and have been tested for STDs. So the test of this game is not about morality, or safety, but fidelity. Would you cheat on your significant other, for the greater good of the relationship? The last couple to have sex, or the first to refuse, will lose. While the others, will proceed on to the final challenge."

I looked at my wife on the TV screen, relieved that she had made it this far, but started in shaking fear of what we both have to do to win.

Meanwhile, the arrogant husband started unclipping his belt button and turned to one of the cameras. "You call this a semi final? My wife and I are in an open relationship. Bring it on!"

While the third man, simply stared at his TV screen, sweating and pacing, clearly terrified to go through with it, and watch his wife do the same.

"The game begins... now!” The host called out.

As the arrogant man began to have sex with the woman on his bed, his naked body still littered with fresh scratches from the thorns, I thought about trying to escape, but then I saw the timid husband, and realized his hesitation was an opportunity for me to make it to the next round.

And so, I too removed my clothes and exposed my wounded body, crawling into bed with the masked woman, as my wife did the same with the masked man.

Before long, it was over, the arrogant man laying there naked and smiling into one of the cameras, while I, also naked, hung my head in shame for what I had just done.

I looked at the TV screen, and saw my wife put her clothes back on too. We had both made it.

The same could not be said for the nervous man and his wife, who both stayed true to their values, neither engaging in the act, before masked crew members promptly escorted them out of the factory.

And then there were two. Well, two couples that is. Myself against the arrogant man, my wife against his.

Masked production assistants then brought myself and my competitor into the room where the final challenge would be held.

It, much like the first room, was completely bare save for a dinner table at its center, where two plates and sets of utensils were set out.

"Finalists. Welcome to the fourth and last challenge. Will both contestants please take a seat at the dinner table."

We followed his instructions, as we had done previously, and sat down at the table, before a couple production assistants ran over and helped us tuck bibs into our shirts.

"The rules of game four are perhaps the most simple of all. You'll be presented with an item that you must eat. The first to finish eating it, is the winner." The host said over the room's speakers.

That's when a door opened and two masked PAs came out holding trays, and began rushing them over to us.

As they approached us, I began to panic, knowing that whatever it was that they were about to present to us, would likely even be more terrifying than anything we had encountered in the previous games.

"Sometimes you have to break a heart, to win another." The host called out, "In this challenge, the item you'll need to eat is..."

At that exact moment, the two PAs each removed a pair of tongs from their pocket, uncovered their tray, and placed the item on our plates.

"...A human heart."

I gasped, and nearly threw up in my mouth, as I saw the disgusting bloody organ lying there on my plate.

"May the best husband win! Goodluck, the game starts... now!"

For a minute, I hesitated, disgusted by the challenge set before me, but then I thought about what was on the line, and saw the arrogant husband immediately biting into his heart, blood pouring down his face.

I hurried to catch up, briefly fumbling my own heart, before chomping into it, and attempting to eat it as fast as I could, as blood sprayed all over my own face.

But the arrogant husband had gotten a head start, and was moving too quickly. No matter how fast I ate it, it was becoming clear that if nothing was done, he would surely beat me..

So, not knowing what else to do…

…I slammed what was left of my heart onto the plate, removed my bib, stood up, and proceeded to tackle the arrogant man out of his seat, sending his heart sliding across the concrete floor.

"What the fuck are you doing, man?" He asked, likely surprised that I was capable of such an act.

"I'm doing what needs to be done for love." I replied, before pummeling him over and over in the face with my fist, as I channeled my innermost frustrations, ranging from the traumatic experience we had just gone through, the arrogant husband’s obnoxious behavior throughout the game, years of belittlement from asshole boss, and my wife and my countless failed attempts at getting pregnant over the years.

I kept pummeling him, until he had completely shut the fuck up, and was simply mumbling incoherent words, his face a bloody pulp, blood bubbling out of his mouth.

I then stood up, walked back to the table, sat down, put the bib back on, and took the last bite of my heart.

"Congratulations, you’ve proved that you'll truly do anything for love, and have won the show! Please remove the loser."

Rather than celebrate, my mind once again returned to my wife, worried about her well being and wondering if she too, had mustered up the courage to eat the heart, and had become the winning wife.

A couple masked production assitants then ran over and dragged the arrogant husband away, as he simply stared at me in shock.

I looked down at my hands, which were still covered in blood, then up at one of the cameras, which was now right up in my face.

“How do you feel?” Phil asked, prompting me to speak to the camera.

But I couldn’t bring myself to speak any words.

I tried to think of something to say, but before I could, a door opened, and the masked PAs grabbed me by the arms and escorted me out of the last room and into an adjacent hallway, which led to a huge set of double doors.

"Winners,” the host said over the hallway’s speakers. “You stand here before us, victorious, each of you on one side of the doors. Now it is time, to find out if the person on the other side… is your partner… and if you both had what it takes, to do anything for love."

I took a deep breath, expecting the worst. Expecting to see the arrogant man’s wife on the other side. After all that.

But when the doors opened, I simply saw…

...My wife, standing there on the other side.

We ran to each other and embraced, both of us missing our ring fingers, littered in scratches, emotionally exhausted, and with faces and hands that were covered in blood.

"Congratulations!" The host continued, "You're the winners of Anything for Love!"

Both crying, we smiled at each other, but our smiles quickly turned into looks of sadness.

We'd won. But at what cost? I wondered, before the thought was overshadowed by that of the once in a lifetime prize that awaited us.

The producer, Phil, then brought us into yet another room, where we met a doctor, his face covered by a surgical mask, and both shook his hand.

"When you two showed up late,” Phil began, “I never thought you'd be the ones to win. But you did. So we stand by our promise. After you return home, you’ll be contacted by the doctor, who will provide you with the guidance and resources to hopefully have a baby of your own. That part, is obviously not guaranteed."

"Thank you." My wife replied, clearly torn by saying those words. “Understood.”

"Thank you." I added, also torn, before realizing that the camera crew didn't follow us into the room with the doctor. "But can I ask, why aren't you filming this part?"

"Oh, our audience only cares about watching the games." Phil replied with a chuckle.

"Audience? But we just filmed it."

"Oh, yeah we were livestreaming the whole time."

"I thought it was just a pilot. Who was watching?"

"The subscribers."

"Who are they?"

"A very small, very privileged group of people, who can't be bothered by pedestrian entertainment. They desire something more... elevated."

"Will this ever be a real show?"

"This? Of course not." Phil laughed, "No one else will ever watch this again. And no one but the small group of contestants and this crew, will ever know of what went on here."

"What happened to the other couples?"

"Oh they're fine. Aside from missing fingers, and being a little physically and emotionally scratched up. We'll do with them exactly what we'll do with you. Drop them off somewhere just far enough away that after we give them their phones back, if they choose to call the police or tell anyone about this place, by the time they come here to investigate, they'll find this factory abandoned, without a trace of what went on here today. The same goes for you. By the way, we better get you ready to go, your car will be arriving any minute now.”

Neither my wife nor myself had the energy to conjure up a reply.

"Thank you again for playing!" Phil said through his mask, "And on behalf of the subscribers, please enjoy your prize!"

He then led us out down a long hallway, through a back door, and into an alley, where a car was waiting to take us away.

"The chauffeur will provide you with your phones upon your arrival."

An hour or so later, the driver pulled over on the side of a highway, and let us off, handing us our phones just as Phil had promised.

But rather than call the police, we just stood there for a while, still horrified by the terrifying experience we had just been put through.

And ultimately… we decided that since we had won, it'd be best to leave it alone.

We hitched a ride back home, and sure enough, about a week later...

...We received a call from the doctor...

...And less than a year after that, my wife gave birth to our baby boy.

Sometimes, I think back to that day, and the terrible games they set before us, and wonder if my wife and I went too far to win…

...But then I look at my newborn son, and all the doubt, all the shame, all the horror, washes away.

And as for the subscribers. Every once in a while, when a car drives suspiciously slow past our house, or I get the feeling that my baby monitor might have just moved on its own, I wonder if they're still watching us, and if this is just the next episode of their reality show.
