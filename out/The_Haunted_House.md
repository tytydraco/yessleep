It was a warm summer day when I first set foot in the old, abandoned house on the edge of town. I had always been curious about the place, with its peeling paint, broken windows, and overgrown yard. It was said to be haunted, and I had heard all sorts of creepy stories about the strange noises that came from the house at night, the ghostly apparitions that could be seen through the windows, and the feeling of dread that seemed to hang in the air.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I entered the house, but I was certainly prepared for anything. I had a flashlight, a camera, and a sense of adventure. I was determined to uncover the truth about this creepy old place, no matter what it took.

As I stepped inside, I was immediately struck by how dark and quiet the house was. The only sound came from my footsteps as I made my way from room to room. The furniture was covered in a thick layer of dust, and cobwebs hung from the ceilings. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized that no one had lived in this house for years.

It was as I was exploring the upstairs of the house that I heard the first strange noise. It was a low, mournful groan, like the wind blowing through a narrow alley. At first, I tried to tell myself that it was just the wind, but as the groaning grew louder and more persistent, I realized that it was something more sinister. I shone my flashlight in the direction of the sound, but there was nothing there.

I continued to explore the rest of the house, trying to ignore the growing sense of unease that was settling in my chest. Every time I turned a corner, I expected to see something frightening, but there was never anything there. And then, as I was about to leave the house, I saw something that made me wish I had never entered the old, abandoned house in the first place.

In one of the rooms, there was a small, wooden door that looked like it led to a closet or a small storage room. I cautiously approached the door, wondering what I would find on the other side. I reached for the doorknob and was about to open it when I heard a voice whisper in my ear.

"Don't go in there."

I jumped back, my heart racing, but there was no one there. I looked around the room, but there was still no sign of anyone. I was alone in the house, and yet, I had heard a voice.

I was about to leave the house when I realized that I had left my camera in the room with the door. I didn't want to leave without it, so I reluctantly returned to the room. I hesitated for a moment, but then I reached for the doorknob and opened the door.

The room was pitch black, and I could barely make out the shapes of the things inside. I reached for my flashlight, and as I did, I heard the voice again.

"Don't go in there."

I turned to run, but my feet wouldn't move. I was frozen in place, and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. I heard a rustling sound, and then I saw a pair of glowing eyes in the darkness.

I don't remember what happened after that. All I know is that I woke up outside the house, with no memory of how I got there. I never went back to the old, abandoned house on the edge of town. And I never told anyone what I saw in that small, wooden room.

Years have passed, and I still think about that haunted house. I wonder what was in that room, and what the voice was trying to tell me. I sometimes hear the groaning sound in my dreams, and I see the glowing eyes in the darkness. And I know that I will never forget the fear that I felt in that old, abandoned house.
