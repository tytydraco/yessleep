It was winter season. All my family members had gone for a walk. I was alone at home. Yes, I love horror movies. So at night I fell asleep watching a horror movie alone. I didn't like the movie so much so I fell asleep. This is normal for me but something strange happened that night. 

I was dreaming that I was on the moon. And I'm driving a jeep. And a beautiful girl is sitting next to me. I felt very happy seeing him.  I asked her who are you and what are you doing here? She then introduced himself to me. She said that I am the daughter of the devil. I didn't feel that strange after hearing this. Because she was so beautiful that I fell in love with her. After that I can say something. many animals arrived before that, At first I thought it was all animals but? But all of them were Demon's and started attacking us. And that girl came and sat on me.  To save myself, I started driving holding her. Then suddenly out of nowhere a sword appeared on my hand. And I kept killing all the monsters. 

Well, there was a lot of twist in the story. Then she held me and started kissing me. And I also kept kissing her and killing demons with one hand. Suddenly the sword left my hand. And we both kept kissing each other like crazy. After that we both had sex while the car was moving. It happened once, twice, thrice and it kept happening continuously. And we both got lost in each other. And she was also loving me with immense love. So many times that she would actually become the mother of my child. Always happened again and again.  She kept coming to my dreams again and again. And it still comes. But earlier when I dreamed of intercourse, I used to get discharged. But since then she has started coming in my dreams. My NightFall Never Happened again. I started having this dream 3 years ago! And yet I see. And sometimes I see that I am running away holding a girl's hand. And there's a monster like thing running behind us. And when I look at that girl, I never see her face. That's why I get a little confused whether this girl is the same girl or someone else? I don't know if I only have this dream or does anyone else also have such dreams? But all the people I have told about these dreams? Everyone has told me only one thing that you should go to a priest. But I never went, I don't want her to stop coming in my dreams.

You guys must be wondering what strange dream I am seeing? But this dream comes to me again and again and I like it very much. And now I have become used to it. Right now, whenever I don't have such a dream, I feel very uneasy. But I keep dreaming like this.  Sometimes in a dream I am killing a demon. And sometimes in some dreams I myself have become a Demon. It is not that I am a devil slayer or a devil worshiper. I believe in God a lot. And I also previously studied in a religious school. But I like it when she comes in my dreams.
