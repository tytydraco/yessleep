I'm sure all of you have heard the famous urban legend about a hitchhiker who turns out to be a ghostly apparition, around campfires, the internet, and even TV shows.

The reason why I'm bringing this up is because my city has created a similar talltale around me, the ghost teen who always stands under a streetlight in a lone interstate bordering between my town, and the town next to it, but only appears every Halloween night. It has been that way for me ever since 1993 when I got into a tragic car crash one thunderstorm-y night. but however I'm not always like that, I guess you can say that I'm immortal for the most part, but it's only on Halloween night when I'm a ghost that can freak motorists out by disappearing from the passenger seat, making me the only phantom hitchhiker whose male.

I live in a continent that has 27 cities in it, both have a nice beach at the end of each side. however my current life isn't on the sidewalk, I mostly live with my sister, and friends in a underground facility that's related to a chain of children's entertainment joints. Though me and my family used to live in Mahoning County in Ohio up until I started High school that we moved to the small city filled continent when at the time I thought my mom or dad got offered a better job in a less busy town like Berlin. My Halloween nights used to be trick or treating, having experiences with creepy old ladies' houses, or hanging out with friends because I was too old to be trick-or-treating anymore when I hit 15. But now i do my ghostly duties every Halloween night that keeps the ancient legend alive to this day.

Most of my town's residents talk about me, my guess from person to person, until it spread like wildfire around the continent, describing their encounters always ending on my sister telling them the bad news, So much so that people started avoiding the road, mostly black people, and people who don't want to have a encounter with a ghost. and there will be times when old people will pick me up for the sake of feeling bad for me, who wouldn't feel bad for a young man whose all alone without their parents?

However 1 year ago, I experienced some visitors that weren't like my normal pickups, I know this will make me sound like a hypocrite but just bare with me on this....

On Halloween 2023, It started like any other Halloween night in my hitchhiker duties. but it was understandly slow, but some would come driving to another city, and some were driving home. then I would get those thrill riders, and they either were teenagers, who wanted nothing but to see if the stories about me were true, or they had somebody with their phone out, my guess to get reactions from Tiktok, or YouTube. However at 3AM, While I was waiting for the next car to come, and trying to keep myself warm against the chilly air of Fall.

I heard the distant noise of a engine running, I thought someone had pulled over seeing me on the sidewalk all alone in the dead of night, but I didn't see any car near my spot. I looked to my right and so as I did. I noticed a car yards away on the middle of the street that staying still like it was at a traffic light.... but here's the thing I have been on this street every Halloween night, and there is no traffic lights, so why isn't the car moving, like it was on this side, then I would've said that I didn't have to get out the hitchhiking gesture, but this car was in the middle of the street not moving a inch, that I could tell something was instantly wrong.

"*I-in the m-middle of t-the street?!*" I said, concerned by the driver's chosen parked spot.

I walk from the sidewalk and across the pavement, as my footsteps echo throughout but as I walk closer to the car I then notice that the car looked vintage, like 50s/40s vintage. That's odd, barely anyone owns those kind of car models anymore, they are stored in storage unit places to rot away. Once I walked to the driver's side I froze. The driver, and the passenger were acting strange, they were stood still like mannequins looking at the road ahead of them, neither of them were moving like they didn't see/acknowledge me walking towards their car.

The driver looked like he was in his 40s or 30s, 30s in the most. he wore old fashioned limo driver clothes, the same with the hat on his head, he had his hands on the steering wheel not letting go, smiling like in a way that made me unnerved. That's when I saw his passenger.... They didn't look normal or even human at all, it looked like a skinless corpse came to life, it too was smiling. I turned to the backseat window. and saw a skeleton in the backseat looking at the same direction too.

"*W-what the H-heck?!*" I stammered, mortified by the strange figures inside the car, yeah I rather go home than get inside, if there was room for me that is. There's probably another skeleton too that I don't see.

"**Hey...!**"

I heard a deep gravelly male voice that sounded like Mr. Creeps break the silence, I turned to the source to the sound. *Maybe a bystander had noticed me standing outside their car*. But instead I turn to the driver's window to suddenly see the driver is now looking at me dead in the eyes; his body still not moving. Oh, now he acknowledges my existence after seeing me walk out into the street, like he was blind or something.

"*W-what?*" I muttered.

"**Room for ONE more**" he said coldly, and his voice echoing in the car.

I stepped back, and raised my hands to my chest as to say "*Oh hell no*" There's no way I'm stepping inside, as I don't know where those things will take to, They are NOT normal, humans don't act like that way at all. The whole thing feels off from any other ride I had in my ghostly duties.

"*N-no, t-thank you! H-have a n-nice night, s-sir!*" I stuttered, as I backed away from his car, whatever intentions he, and them have; I'm not getting involved in it.

I turned around, and started walking back to my spot under the streetlight, as my footsteps echoed against the asphalt, turning my head back to the car hoping it drives off, because you don't park your car in the middle of the road except if your at a traffic light, or if your car breaks down, or runs out of gas.

"**You're Calvary Guard, right?"** I heard him call out. How does he know my name, I don't know him. Only my family, my friends and sister are allowed to call me by my name.

I turned back around, and walked back to the driver's window, he was still looking at the direction I was, I was starstruck by his sudden calling, it sounded like a driver confirming if it's you or not. His expression didn't change.... he was still smiling,

"*y-yeah, it is...*" I confirmed, still confused.

I then heard a car door open, as I jerked up when I saw the car door on the left side of the backseat open on it's own, no wind, no one opening the door, the skeleton in the back still didn't move, nor make any attempt to reach for the interior door handle. Don't tell me they want to get inside, because usually when a driver offers me to get inside I happily oblige, and thank the driver because I want to be nice to the driver. But when this guy.... It's better if I walk back home, I know the night air will be freezing but I don't care.

"**Funtime St. Westeast. that's the address, am I not wrong**?" he continued in that guttural monotone voice, How did he know?! Why is he saying that like I ordered a ride.

My eyes widen at his response.

"*H-how do you k-know that?!*" I raised my voice, but he didn't response to my tone like most parents would do.

"**Have a seat**!" He said, as his body jolted within the blink of a eye till he was against the open window, as he raised his tone too, like he was saying through gritted teeth.

Caught off-guard, and speechless, I silently agreed, as I slowly walked to the open door, and got inside, the whole car was glowing green, and what looked like a coffin was separating me, and the skeleton. However after the door closed by it's own, He started driving without moving the steering wheel which sent off so many red flags in my mind, is he driving the car by his mind?! I immediately grabbed the car door trying to open it. It didn't budge like it was locked or something. I used some keys in my hoodie pocket, my own strength, nothing worked like the door was glued to the car. What the actual heck is going on.

"D-did you lock the doors, s-sir?!" I asked him. Nothing came out, not even a single answer. as I defeatedly put both hands inside my hoodie pocket, silently praying for my disappearing ability to get me out of this un-human filled car as the passenger in the front seat's odor clouded the car, as I covered my nose trying not to gag. after what felt like 10 minutes I looked out the window... it was pitch black, like actual pitch black.... *what the, where is he taking me?*

"**I know you will disappear from this Car**" he finally spoke. What? How does he know I will do that, I mean I plan on doing that, but how does he know?! Can he read my mind or something.

"*H-how do you know I-i will do that?!*" I asked, now confronting him, as I stood up straight.

I looked at him, and that's when I jump, his head was now facing the direction towards me as he's not facing the road.... He's gonna crash the car! However his expression did change as it was now the type of expression a villain gives when they're giving a speech towards the hero, like a evil confrontational type of look in his eyes, that looked dull, and there was no life behind his eyes.

"**Because I know that you're the Vanishing Hitchhiker of this town, you think I didn't know? You also died from a heart attack from some robots in your death place you call home. I might as well take you to your parents. Also I don't even need to keep my eyes on the road because we're already halfway there"** he continued, as I was trying to not freak out just looking at him.

What's next, is he gonna know that I will do my scare face after I tell the story of how I became like this? I then looked at my hands and froze.... they were translucent again. How am I in my ghost form while in the car?! I looked back to the driver who even though a side of my forehead was bleeding, and my torso was bleeding staining my hoodie, he didn't look away and still keeping eye contact with me.

"*W-what t- the?! W-why am I i-in my g-ghost form in your c-car?!*" I shouted, looking at him, and my hands, I want OUT of this car. I can't stand the passenger's odor.

"**Because you've been dead for 30 years, what did you expect Calvary? So is your sister, And You know you're dead, do you? And if you truly live in that death bunker, why do you still live there?**" he went on, Yes dude. I'm already aware, you think I didn't know that I'm dead? That's why ghosts exist. ! And the reason why i still there is my room is in there, and I have accepted this life since 1994. and Violet knows she's dead too, trust me I can ask her if she's dead and I can bet your mannequin self she would immediately say yes. Just tell me that I reached my destination already.

"Y-yes, I already know that I-I'm d-dead, and V-violet knows t-too! B-but the reason why I-I still live there b-because me and violet h-have chosen this l-life, o-okay!" I responded back, having the annoyed tone in my voice because I want to give this guy the hint that I want to leave this car, If he allows me to leave before he does arrive at Funtime St.

After a few more minutes of silence, suddenly the car stops, and the door next to me opens. *Yes! Finally, get me out of this surreal nightmare!* Without any hesitation, I get out the car. Forget leaving behind the headphones. I'm taking them with me! I stand up and see the door close on it's own, Then I walked back to the driver window and he was back to looking at the road ahead of him. I let out a winded sigh of relief when I saw that he took me to the correct address, I crossed his car and onto the pathway onto the entrance of the building, where the doors open and Violet sees me, in my bloodied ghost form, and her happiness immediately turns into confusion, and concernment. But before I can greet her, she looks behind me and her brows rose, as she pointed behind me.

"Um, where is the car the driver is in that dropped you off?" She asked.

I looked behind me and as I said "*W-what do you m-mean? T-that car right t-there*" I froze dead in my tracks. the car was gone, don't tell me the car magically disappeared when she opened the door. She was confused as she watched me become flabbergasted and drop my arms to my sides while facing the direction of the car that was there 1 minute ago. *It was a ghost car wasn't it.*

*"Calvary, you okay? Why are you in your ghost form?"* she asked, curiously pointing out my appearance.

Once I finally snapped back to reality, I turned around to face her, and immediately tears welded up in my face as I hugged her as hard as I could and started crying after taking in all of what just happened back there.

"Woah, what's wrong Cal? Why are you sobbing?!" She asked, understandably concerned, after a moment I let go of her, and immediately went inside, heading for the elevator, as she followed asking behind her of why was I crying in her embrace. I didn't say anything to her until we arrived at our floor and got inside the control room in-between the showroom auditoriums. All the while I was wondering if the driver, and those not human passengers were dead and were like me; ghostly apparitions, or if I experienced some sort of extraterrestrial transportation fever dream.

"F-follow me to my r-room...!" I finally spoke, she nodded, and once we got to my room, and I sat down in my bed, she did the same, and I finally explained to her what happened, as she was shocked but stayed silent the whole time, listening to everything I told her about, as she had her legs, and hands crossed. till she patted me on the shoulder, as I covered my face with my hands, as I dropped my head down,

"I'm sorry you had to experience that, Calvary. I can't imagine seeing a motorist acting like that." She told me after I explained to her everything I witnessed. She gave me a hug of comfort, and reassured me that i see that car again next Halloween I should ignore it, and I nodded as a response. After that night, when I returned back to my visible self with my non hitchhiker attire, we told our friends, who also felt bad for me, while some told me that I should've ignored the car which I didn't deny to agree. They managed to get people researching about the driver, and those strange passengers, till I found a text number from someone who knows the driver.

"Hey I heard about your story, and I want to inform you that robotic driver you experienced was a ancestor of my father who tragically passed away in a brutal car accident while he had a couple passengers inside, on the same street you passed away in, and he shares the same anniversary you do. anyways take care."

I knew it, the driver, and those passengers were dead, I mean there was a literal skeleton in the backseat. So did I meet another phantom traveling apparition as well without realizing? I mean if so, he could've at least told me that he's dead as well. But as much as I want to go back to that moment, It's better if I don't relive that night, as well resmell that bad odor that left me throwing up in the toilet after I told Violet my story. But even if he and those passengers were also a ghost, why was he acting robotic, turning his hand in a superhuman like way, and making the car move without him moving the steering wheel.

"But what about the skinless passenger I saw next to the driver?" I responded.

It took them a few minutes to respond, but when she did, I got this reply.

"....They were the only ones who wasn't taken out of the car when authorities came to the crime scene, so they rotted till they had to be taken out as well, and the car eventually got destroyed because no one could handle the bad smell."

That's why the passenger smelled so bad that night, I should've known.

"Thanks for letting me know!"

From then on, I tried to forget about what happened mainly to keep my mind off the images of him turning his head in moments I didn't expect, but I couldn't; simply because people kept talking about it, and talking about it was a coincidence that I, who is a ghostly apparition, met another ghostly apparition just not in the way I expected, and others would talk about the car crash that ended the life of that driver and his passengers.

It has now been 1 year since that weird encounter, and so here I am.... currently standing under the streetlight this Halloween night, in my Vanishing Hitchhiker state, waiting for a normal driver to pull over, I don't know if that ghost car was always there in the middle of the road at exactly 3AM because when 3AM rolls around, no other car enters the street. But I came to the conclusion that he was always waiting for the chance I would finally walk up to his car, because I always saw his car but I never walked up to, and now I wished I hadn't. Even as of this second while I'm writing this, I see that ghost car in the distance, and I dare not to glance closer because I don't want to see that smiling driver anymore.

And I still keep her promise, as while he was able to get me to my correct location, I still wonder how he somehow knows about me, if he died decades ago than when I was born. But even when I'm right now distantly hearing him say Hey in that guttural deep tone, I will just look the other way, and wait for the car to disappear on it's own. Because trust me if I were you I would not get into that car no matter what how much ~~H~~e will convince you, who knows what would happen to you in there.
