**"Breaking news, reports have just come in that confirm the complete decommissioning and destruction of Monolith industry site 46 after the chemical disaster last year. Here's Rhonda with more on the subject."**

**"Thank you, Tom. I am currently standing just outside of the abandoned chemical plant Site 46, which, for the past 15 years, has been the city's primary chemical and pharmaceutical distribution plant. Last year, the site experienced a nasty chemical spill that was reported to have resulted in the deaths of no fewer than at least 30 of the workers and--"**

I shut the laptop after that. I couldn't watch anymore. They were actually doing it, they were going to demolish Site 46. After everything that happened, and they're just destroying it. How fuckin' rich.

Look, I'm sorry, I... I don't know how to really go about this. I'll say that if my therapist is reading this, yeah, you get your way, pal, I'm finally writing about this like you've been bitching at me to do for at least the past 8 months. I know he means well, and hopefully he's right that it'll actually help me, but you'll see in a bit why it's taken me this long to want to talk about what happened.

If there was one fact that those idiots on the tube managed to actually slip that was true, it was that the place had served as the city's top chemical distribution center for the longest time. I was 15 when it first opened, and over those next couple of years, I'd gradually see more and more people's houses stocked with their products. They basically assimilated the Pharmeceutical supply and distribution  industry in my city in just 3 or 4 short years.

Their biggest claim to fame was how their products could *actually* cure or stabilize just about any condition. I remember even seeing claims supporting how it could treat early stages of cancer without the need for chemo *and* had even less of a relapse rate to boot. Oh, and the best part; this shit came with little to no side effects. How fuckin' lucky for us, right? Yeah, that was Site 46, the heaven of pharmaceutical junkies. Funny enough, too, where as with most other over the counter meds, their shit didn't have much, if anybody at all, getting hooked on it either.

In short, the place was the manufacturer of miracle cures. Now for those about to accuse me of blowing smoke up your asses, running your mouths that that's all "too good to be true", well, you're right and wrong. While this *does* sound like a pipe dream or wishful thinking, I promise you, it *was* real, all of it, and I promise you, I wish more than anything that it wasn't.

Okay, so now that you know a little about Site 46, let me get into what happened a year ago. By that time, I'd been working there for about 4 or 5 years, had risen through the ranks and been promoted to Operations Supervisor of the plant, and thought I'd seen the place inside and out. I'd even gotten Employee of the month twice in a row. "Iron Rod" was my nickname around the plant on account of all the overtime I kept pulling. What could I say, the money was great and I didn't have a family yet, only my out of town girlfriend who I got to see every other week, so why not milk the biggest cash cow in my city for all it was worth, you know?

I remember that day, the bell for lunch hour had just rang and my crew and I had all filed into the cafeteria. I sat down next to my work buddy, Ben, and started wolfing down my triple cheeseburger deluxe (with bacon, too) while he just stared at his tray like it'd just told him his mother had died. "Ben, you okay, man?" I asked over an admittedly large mouthful of burger.

"Huh?" he asked, dazed. "Oh, uh... Yeah, I uh... Yeah, I'm fine." I raised my eyebrow.

"You sure? Cause I mean..." I gestured to my half eaten burger, "It's bacon triple cheeseburger deluxe day, man."

"I know... I just..." He started rubbing his forehead. I noticed then just how much he was sweating. Now, I should mention that this all happened right smack in the middle of the winter, and keep in mind, too, the A.C. in the plant might as well have been nonexistent, with the temperature having to remain below freezing for the chemicals. The kitchen was the only place where any kind of heat would've existed. Hell, I was actually having to wear my coat inside the cafeteria just to eat. But not Ben. He was in just his work uniform, a bright orange shirt with the Site 46 logo on it, and heavy work slacks.

"Hey man, you sure nothing's up, I mean, you're burning up."

"I... I don't know, I just feel woozy for some reason."

"You eat anything this morning?"

"Yeah, remember the pancakes from the drive thru?"

"Oh yeah... Well how long have you been feeling ill?"

"It just started 10 minutes ago. I don't know man." He scooted his tray towards me. "Here, you want this?" I looked at the tray. He'd taken only a small bite of his sandwich and left his fries all but untouched. I looked back up at him and saw his eyelids starting to flutter like they'd had lead weights dangling from them.

"Ben?" He started, looking back to me. His breathing started getting heavy. "Ben, come on, we need to get you to the--" My words died in my throat when, out of nowhere, he fell out of his chair and hit the ground, headfirst. "Ben!" I shouted, dropping down to him. His eyes looked glazed and his skin had already started going pale. "Somebody get the medical team!"

By this time, the cafeteria had already started into a commotion, with everyone gathering around and a general uproar already brewing. On the ground, Ben's body was perfectly still and I watched a steady red stream run from Ben's nose, eyes, ears, and mouth. My heart started racing, then I noticed that the liquid running out of him wasn't exactly what I was expecting. By this I mean that, rather than a thick, viscous stream of blood like normal, it was thin, watery, looking more like cherry kool-aid than blood. This sent my head spinning as well.

*Dear God, that isn't blood, is it? What the hell's happening to him?* It was about a minute later when the emergency medical alarm sounded which meant that someone, somewhere in the plant had collapsed or was in a seriously critical condition, which alerted everyone to clear the room for the medical and chem-hazard crews to arrive at the scene. Thirty seconds after that, the teams entered the room and escorted myself and everyone else out.

The entire time, all I could think about was if Ben would make it. We were all led out to the hallway and made to wait until either the area was deemed safe to reenter or we would have to be escorted to the quarantine zones ourselves. It was more than twenty, possibly more than thirty, minutes before we finally saw the teams clearing out of the room, where we were then being escorted to the quarantine zone while alarms began blaring all around us.

**"Attention all personnel in the east wing, I repeat, attention all personnel in the east wing, please report to the quarantine zone immediately. This is not a drill, I repeat, this is not a drill!"**

My eyes grew. *What the hell?! What happened, why's the entire east wing being told to quarantine?*

Typically, in situations such as medical or biohazard, the protocol only dictated that those closest to the exposed or infected persons -- in this case, those in the cafeteria -- were required to undergo quarantine, hence why it was only a small bunker to begin with. It's not meant to fit an entire wing of the plant. If they were having to go to *this* extreme of measures, it meant only one thing, whatever the hazard was, whatever had taken Ben down, had already been exposed to at least 2-300 or more other workers and was likely *still* spreading.

Even worse was the fact that when they cleared out of the room, Ben wasn't brought out. That's when I started to go ballistic, knowing full well what was about to happen. See, in cases of a biohazard like this, there was one remedy they'd use called "Rinsing". Basically, through some sort of cocktail of phosgene, chlorine, sodium chloride and one or two other household chemicals being mixed in just the right way, they set off a cloud in the exposed area that completely sterilizes the room, essentially incinerating, or "rinsing", the area of all hazardous chemicals or bacteria. It's highly effective, naturally...

Unfortunately, a little *too* much so.

Thanks to the aforementioned mix, namely the phosgene aspect, if you were in the "rinsing zone", well... Good news is, you won't have to worry about an infection or unknown contagion anymore -- because you won't have much of a *body* anymore. "Wait!" I shouted, "What the hell are you doing? Someone's still in there!"

A Chem-hazard member blocked me from approaching any closer, telling me, "You can't go any further, sir. Please go with the rest to the quarantine zone."

"I can't, you're about to--" I was cut off when two other men in hazmat suits approached from either side to take me by my arms and begin leading me down the hall. "Get off of me! Stop, you can't do this, my friend's still in there!" I struggled frantically against them, but it was no use. I was dragged further down the hall, pathetically kicking and screaming, "You're killing my friend!" like a frenzied child in a grocery store who was showing their little ass.

Eventually, I was finally thrown inside the cramped ass quarantine bunker before they walked off without so much as another word or nod in my direction. As soon as the door closed, I rushed it and started howling at them, "You bastards! You fuckin' killed him!" Eventually, I managed to cause a ruckus long enough for one of the others there to come over and pull me away from the door and tell me to shut the hell up.

"They... They-they..." I stammered, my brain completely fried.

"Calm down, Rod." demanded Daniel, the shift manager of my area of the plant. The two of us had a stare down for about 5 seconds before I finally broke, taking a deep breath to relax. Everyone else around me looked shook up themselves. I heard indistinct chatter throughout the room, much of it, from what I could understand, was geared towards the obvious question; what the hell was going on?

"What happened to Ben?" I heard someone ask.

"I saw him collapse," I heard another reply. He then turned to me and asked, "You were with him, Rod, what do you think happened?" I just stared blankly at him. How the hell was *I* supposed to know?

"Maybe he had an allergic reaction to something he ate?" our data manager, Edna, chimed in.

"An allergic reaction?" Daniel asked, stupefied. "You *see* what happened to him?" He stared moving his hands down his face from his nose to mimic blood fall. "Had shit runnin' all outta every hole he had. You think *that* was from somethin' he ate?"

"Okay, well what's *your* theory then?" Edna rebutted.

"I don't know, but it sure as shit wasn't the food. Hell, it's the same thing we was all eatin'. If it was the food, shouldn't we all be bleeding out of our faces like we was livin' an Edgar Allan Poe story?"

"Not only that," I chimed in finally, "but he barely ate any of it. Not to mention the fact that that wouldn't have likely triggered an evacuation and quarantine of the entire east wing of the plant, would it?" Daniel nodded in regard to me while Edna shrank back down. "No, whatever this is, it's coming from somewhere in the plant itself.

"But what, where?" asked another of the grunts in the stuffed room around me. Again, I just shrugged at this.

"Whatever it is, it better be the most dangerous thing in the world that they're trying to prevent." I said this through gritted teeth. *If they're having to go and fry Ben over it, yeah... it better be a fuckin' world ending threat!*

"Well, how do we know *we* haven't been infected with it?" asked a particularly annoying grunt from around the plant named Craig.

"We don't," I replied, sighing.

"Why the hell do you think we're in here, dumbass?" Daniel added.

"Yeah, but... what if... What if we're not *all* infected?"

"Well then I guess you'll have nothing to worry about, will you? Now can you do us all a favor and shut up?"

"But what I'm saying is, what if there IS someone here who's got whatever that was that got Ben? We'll be locked in here with it. We'll all get infected and we'll be trapped!"

"Then in that case, we'll at least get a break from hearing your whiny ass mouth, huh? How's that sound everybody?" No one replied to this. On any other day, and under any other circumstances, I'd have been right there with Daniel, berating Craig to quit being a fuckin' baby. The dude's the walking definitions of both the terms "Hypochondriac" and "Worry wart", and he couldn't help himself but to make a show out of expressing his fears to the rest of the free world, making it their problem as well. Thing was, after thinking about it for a moment, I started to realize Craig might have an unfortunate point.

The bad news about this is that, given that we were in a cramped ass space with a bunch of already panicked people, and I couldn't just reassure them the way Daniel was, in his own pushy and messed up way. The crowd started trying to space themselves apart from each other, which of course was impossible, given that there was barely enough room to fit us in there the way we were to begin with. I could hear a rumbling murmur start to brew as well.

"Calm down, calm down, people." Daniel announced. "Look, it's been a crazy day, can we please just keep it together and see what's actually goin' on?"

"Dan's right." shouted someone from the back. Dan made a gesture toward the voice before turning to face me. "Now Rod, you said that Ben hadn't eaten anything before he collapsed?" I sullenly nodded. "What about this morning, he eat anything then?"

"Don't know, he and I were assigned different departments this morning. He was in the chem lab while I was throwing freight in the warehouse."

"What about yesterday, or hell maybe the day before? He complain about feelin' ill any time then?"

"Huh-uh, he was just fine until an hour ago."

"He say anything before he collapsed in the cafeteria?" asked someone at my right. I shook my head in response.

"Not really," I replied, squinting to remember the events. "He just said he wasn't hungry, and he was sweating."

"You know what he was doin' in chem?" asked Daniel. I gave him the look you'd give to someone who'd just asked you how to play a banjo underwater. "How the hell am I supposed to know?" He held up his hands.

"Just askin', I mean, you were friends with him, wasn't ya?"

"Yeah, but you know good and damn well as I do, they'd sooner have him dead than let him slip whatever the hell was goin' on in there." He nodded his head and turned around again.

"Well then, what the hell *is* going on, here?" asked another one of our "Steel jockeys" (the term we affectionately gave to the crew primarily working the machines in the processing station), Hannah.

"The man just said he didn't know." shouted someone else from the back.

"Didn't I tell y'all to calm the hell down?" Daniel said.

"Look, I don't know what the hell happened, and I don't know what the hell was going on with Ben in Chem lab, okay? Here's what I DO know; one minute, I'm enjoying a delicious burger like the rest of you, and the next, my friend's writhing on the fuckin' floor with shit comin' out of every available hole, and now we're all stuck in here. That's it. I'm not hiding anything, I'm not exaggerating anything, no, that's all I know, and I'd like to leave it alone now, if that's all the same to you all."

"Well said, bud." retorted Daniel.

"Still, we need to make sure no one's sick, don't we?" whined Craig. Daniel groaned.

"And here we go again."

"I'm serious. You want to end up with, pardon my french, shit coming out of every available hole like Rod was talking about?"

"And how the hell're we gonna do that?" Edna piped up.

"Spit sample?" one from the back shouted.

"Piss in a cup, maybe?" shouted another.

"Why don't we--"

"Enough, people." declared Daniel, annoyed. "I don't wanna keep saying this, settle the hell down."

"But what if someone's--"

"Then we'll take care of it, but for God's sakes, can we maybe not cause people to die of a panic attack in the meantime, please?"

"What's the point then?" asked someone from my left. "If we start dying off already, how the hell are we supposed to "deal with it then?" Daniel sighed.

"Alright fine, since y'all want to get all in a tizzy about this shit, here's what we'll do," He turned to me and asked, "Just before he fell out, he have any sort of symptoms?"

"Sorta. He was pale, sweating his ass off and said he felt dizzy."

"So basically the symptoms of a cold?" I shrugged.

"I guess."

"Well alright then, here's what we do, everyone's gonna turn to the person next to you, and if they look like they're a little under the weather, then we'll make sure to stay away from 'em and alert the med team. Capisce?" They all began turning and mumbling to themselves while cautiously examining each other. Daniel and I gave each other a very quick up and down with a look of "Yeah, we'll do it too, anything that shuts these fuckin' hippies up."

About ten minutes later, the room settled down again. "Alright, so everyone satisfied?" Daniel asked. "Was anyone sick?" He waited a moment before continuing with, "No? Okay then, so we can all relax now, right?" The crowd glanced back and forth between themselves and themselves and Daniel. He took this to mean they agreed with him and said, "Okay, now, from here on, I say we sit here and wait until the hazmat crew gives us the all clear. All in favor, say aye."

A very subdued "aye" was heard from the crowd. I turned and looked back through the porthole window of the door. *Just wait here, our thumbs up our asses until they come back for us...*

I thought again about Ben. What the hell *was* he doing in the Chem lab, I wondered. Sure, in our line of work, it was normal for one of us Steel jockeys or grunts to be volunteered for work in the Chemical department -- that's just about any factory, right? Stand in a room and get pepper sprayed or have some crap slathered all over you or drink some weird juice so they don't have to pay people off the street, and you get a little extra in your next check, right?

But then, most places like this weren't secretive like Monolith was, were they? I mean, waivers were one thing, but they didn't just threaten with termination of employment or prosecution, we were under pain of death to keep our traps shut, according to common word of mouth anyway. Admittedly, no one had ever tried, not that we actually knew of, but then, no one we knew of was foolish enough to try, either. I tried thinking of others I knew who'd been called for test monkey duties. From what I could remember, they'd all turned out fine, no real changes at all, save maybe a bit of renewed energy that would always have us confused.

*"Hey, lookie there, yesterday, Larry can't even lift the crate off the ground without almost throwing his back out, now he's Captain America after a stay in the Chem lab. What, did they give ya an extra servin' of spinach?"*

Those, and a good few others, were some of the jokes we'd used to crack with 'em, but we were genuinely shocked and curious. Unfortunately, again, there was no way to get the secret ourselves.

*What are y'all hiding?* I thought, staring out into the dark, dingy hallway. Hours ticked by like they were days and I heard my stomach roar at me furiously. *Wonder if they're even gonna have the goddamn decency to bring us some food...*

I wasn't the only one with this idea, either, just the only one who wouldn't voice it. Edna would take that monicker. "God, anyone else starving?"

"I am, shit." replied another from the back.  I raised my hand in agreeance.

"Yeah, I'm feeling it too." Daniel conceded.

"What should we do?" asked someone from my right.

"What can we do?" asked Edna. "They can't hear us in here, can they?"

"Don't think so." said Daniel. "There's no microphones in--"

"Not true." Craig piped up. We all looked at him curiously.

Daniel scoffed. "That right, and how the hell would you know that?"

"I work maintenance, remember?" Craig nodded, chuckling. "Yeah, they installed microphones in the walls in case they had to evacuate the quarantine zones."

I frowned. "Evacuate the quarantine zones? but then, why the hell bring us here? I mean, this is THE safe zone, right? THE last resort, right? What in hell could be so bad they'd need to evac this place?"

He shrugged. "Like you said, how am *I* supposed to know what the hell those lab monkeys do up there?"

I nodded and said, "Good point."

"Okay, so what, we find the microphone and order takeout?" Daniel asked. "Cause, I mean, I doubt they're in any hurry to come rushing down here after us without knowing whether or not whatever happened out there's been dealt with."

"Well we gotta eat something." Craig whined.

"He's right." said someone from the right. I turned around again and stood up.

Eyeing Daniel, I said, "Why don't we hold a vote then. Raise your hand if you think we should try calling for them to come down here." About half the room, plus a few others raised their hands. "Now those in favor of waiting like Daniel says, raise your hands." About the same amount of people on the other side, this time including Daniel, raised their hands. I noticed there were a few that still hadn't raised their hands, so I asked who was undecided. They didn't raise their hands, but they did look at me.

Looking to Daniel again, I said, "Well, majority vote rules we at least give it a try." Daniel sighed and threw up his hands. "Craig, where the hell's this microphone thing?" He turned and pointed to the far corner of the room.

"Just gotta find the button somewhere along the wall."

"Along the wall?" someone asked.

"Yeah, it's all built into the wall, that way it couldn't be tampered with."

*"Tampered with"? Who the hell would want to tamper with an intercom mic?* Craig went over to the far corner of the room and reached up as far as he could. He was too short though. "Hey, can anyone reach up for me?" I walked over to him and asked where I was supposed to reach for. "There."

I reached up and felt across the wall. Surprisingly, I realized it was only common drywall holding the place together. I felt across for a second before feeling a slight protrusion in the wall. *Bingo.*

"Got it?" he asked

"Yeah."

"Good, now just hold the button down and shout into it." I mashed the button.

"Hello!" I shouted. "Hey, uh... When's someone gonna come to bring us food?"

"Well be direct, why don't ya?" Daniel remarked sarcastically. There was no answer or sound from the other end.

"Hello?!"

"Maybe they're away from the reciever?" suggested one person from behind me.

"Huh-uh." Craig replied, "Like I said, that's supposed to be an emergency thing, meant to be heard in the event of a dire emergency."

"In other words, you speak through there, and it's supposed to be heard throughout the facility?" Daniel asked.

"Exactly."

"Well then I guess they went deaf, cause I shouted as loud as I could into the damn thing."

"Try again."

"Hold on, Craig." Enda said, "How do you know this? Has it ever been used?" Craig's face sunk.

"So wait a minute," Daniel chimed in, "You're getting our hopes up over something you don't even actually know works?"

"Oh, and I see *you* coming up with a better solution?" Craig rebutted. "Yeah, just sit on our asses and *hope* they actually come back for us?"

"Better than you getting everybody in here all riled up over nothing." He had a point, admittedly. Then again, so did Craig. The room was breaking into another rumbling murmur.

I piped up, "Well, I'm not too keen on staying in here any longer than I have to if I can help it." I turned again and hit the intercom. "Hey! Hey, it's me, Rodger McCormick. Look, we've been in here for the past three hours and--" I was cut off when I heard a low, weird sort of humming noise coming from the ceiling. About four or five seconds later, the lights in the bunker shut off abruptly. Several loud, ear-splitting screams echoed around us before a louder, droning whirr came on, followed by the soft, crimson glow of the emergency lights.

*What the hell? Power outage?*

"What happened?" asked someone from somewhere in the room -- I couldn't really tell anymore where certain voices were coming from.

"Power went out." Craig replied, stupefied.

"But how, what happened?" asked Edna.

"How the hell am I supposed to know?"

"Rod?" she asked. *Oh great, now it's MY fault...*

I shrugged. "Fuck if I know, sweetheart. I just hit the button like I was told to and now..." I waved my hand about the room. I turned to Craig and asked, "You sure that's the one for the *intercom*?"

"Yeah, I'm sure of it. Put the damn thing in there myself, I promise."

"So now what do we do?" asked someone.

"Stay calm, that's what." Daniel declared. "Look, I'm sure there's a reason for this, and everything's gonna be alright, so long as we keep our heads and--"

"Hang on a minute." I said, stopping Daniel. Turning to Craig again, I asked, "Aren't the doors on an electronic seal?" He frowned for a second before his eyes widened, picking up where I was going with this. "And emergency power wouldn't cover those, would it?"

"Nope, not that I know of." I turned to Daniel.

"What're you planning, Rod?" he asked cautiously before realization hit him like a moving train and he immediately went wide eyed. "Are you nuts?!" he exclaimed.

"What? What's the problem with getting the hell out of here?"

"You mean *other* than the fact that we have absolutely no fuckin' clue what the hell's out there? Jesus man, I knew you were a bonehead sometimes but come on, this's fuckin' insane!"

"Well I can't say I'd be any better then." said Craig. Daniel scoffed.

"Oh, of course *you* can't."

"Look," I said, "If you wanna stay, I get it, but I'm out." I turned to the crowd then and declared, "Anyone else joining me or am I going it alone?"

"I'm in." Craig piped up.

"I'm with you, see ya." said Edna. I heard a few other people say they were in as well as we headed for the door.

"You're making a mistake, man, I'm tellin' ya." Daniel warned. "All of ya." We of course ignored him and opened the door, venturing out into the blood red lit hallway. Just as soon as the last person joining me was out of the chamber, I heard the door slam shut. I took a brief glance behind me to see Daniel staring back at me through the porthole window with a look of grim expectation. A look that told me just as loud as he could actually shout the words *"Damn fools"*. We then ventured further down the hallway.

The walk was relatively silent; surprising a bit to me, considering the circumstances -- me leading a bunch of frightened plant workers (who frankly don't get paid quite enough to be dealing with a bunch of shit like this) down a hallway that looks like something that came straight out of a sci-fi movie right before the monster comes out. The entire time, too, I had one thing to keep repeating in my head, what in the unholy hell are we going to find once we make it back to the surface level? What caused the power to go out?

There were about a thousand others, obviously, but before any more of them could grab my focus, our little party was forced to a dead halt. Dead ahead of us, we heard the groan of what I assumed to be a dying animal, like a deer or something similar, echo all the way down. "What was that?" Craig asked panicking. The sound rang out again. It was closer this time, moving toward us.

My back stiffened and my hands clenched. "What do we do?" I heard someone behind me ask.

"Maybe we should turn back." said another from behind me.

"We can't. You really think they'd let us back in?" I heard Craig retort. My eyes stayed locked in front of me. Admittedly, a part of me couldn't help but do what the one guy said and make a break back for the quarantine chamber, but at the same time, I knew Craig was right. Daniel's stare said it all. We made our bed, and now we'd have to sleep in it. Possibly for good.

The hallway was quiet again for about twenty seconds before we heard it again. This time, it sounded noticeably more painful, tortured even. I closed my eyes, took a deep, though shuddering breath, and said, "Alright, everyone stay here, I'm gonna go see what's going on." I turned to Craig, "You're with me."

"Wait what?!" he exclaimed, his eyes about two seconds from shooting out at me like they were bullets firing from his skull.

"You heard me, come on."

"Hold up, how the hell are you gonna just waltz down there and "check that out"? You don't even know what it is. Oh, and you wanna drag *me* in too?" I just stood staring at him, my right eyelid drooping. This was the absolute last thing I needed right then; a bitch-rant session from Monolith's top contender for "Poindexter of the Month" award. I wanted to slug the absolute crap out of him and tell him to finally grow a goddamn pair, but I didn't.

No, instead I sighed, smiled my most shit-eating grin, and told him, "Okay, you're right. Clearly, you're smarter and wiser than I am, so I think you should take the driver's seat for a while, eh?" I ended this with a wink. He just stared back at me, confused.

"Huh?"

"Yeah, since you're apparently the smartest of us, why don't *you* decide what we do next?" He stiffened, darting his eyes around at me and everyone else. "Well?"

"Okay, fine, look, I don't know what to do. We can't go back and--"

"And so, therefore, I'll be taking lead again, glad we're on the same page on that. Now, first order is that your ass and mine is gonna march down there and see what the hell's going on, capisce?" He looked pleadingly at me for a moment before diverting his eyes to the ground. "Good, now come on."

The two of us walked quickly, though hesitantly, down to the end of the hall where the sound had come from. The further we went, the darker it became. The red light almost completely dissipated at around the halfway point, almost completely shrouding the two of us in complete darkness. I couldn't much see my own two hands when I held them up to my face. When we got about the rest of the way to the other end, I heard the sound again.

This time was different, though, in that it wasn't so much a groaning sound, but more like *gurgling.* Instead of sounding like something or someone was in excruciating pain, it was now like they were underwater, or at least gargling water, if you understand what I'm saying. This was followed with several sounds of hacking or sort of like wheezing noises. Someone was choking, I thought, and my pace quickened. "Hello?" I called out, "Hang on, I'm coming!"

"Whoa, wait a minute, man, what're you doing?" I ignored him and kept going. The groaning had stopped again.

"Hello, are you hurt?"

"Rod, what the hell are you-- Oh my God!" I turned around to see the color drain completely from Craig's face. He was staring directly ahead of me, into the darkness ahead. I turned around again to find a man shambling down through the hall in front of us. Being as dark as it was, I couldn't see much, but I was able to make out that the guy's skin was *literally* albino. He was tall, too, painfully skinny, looking like a P.O.W., and made this weird guttural sort of noise from his mouth which hung almost to the floor as he stumbled drunkenly along. Briefly, too, I noticed he was wearing a hazmat suit, without the helmet.

"S-Sir?" I called out, shivering slightly. The only reply I got was that gurgling sound again. I could hear Craig shivering behind me like he was cold. Being perfectly honest, I could feel the temperature drop a few degrees myself. I took a small step backward.

"Sir, are you okay?" He stopped this time, snapping his head to his right side like he was examining me. My heart rate quickened. The way he was looking at me, sizing me up almost, and the wobbly, uncoordinated balance of his body gave me the impression who or whatever this was, they weren't exactly friendly. "Who are you?" I asked.

He took a stumbling step forward, to which I stepped backwards. I repeated my question. "Dude, I think we need to--" The stumbling figure cut him off by letting out a loud, tortured moan that sounded like a mix between a dying man and a man coughing up water that echoed all the way down through the hallway. Both mine and Craig's hearts jumped at this.

Another step forward saw the man fall onto his face. I rushed over to him then and was about to reach out to him when his back split open. At first, it looked like something had exploded and we shielded our faces from the splatter, except there was no splatter. We looked again to then see these weird vines or tendrils coming out of his back. They wormed their way out of the hole like an army of squirming baby snakes before becoming rigid, anchoring themselves into the ground.

What happened next was a mix of two things. The first is that Craig and I started sprinting back down the hall while we heard the sounds of simultaneous pounding come from behind us. Like the dumbass I am, I chanced a look behind me to see something that will always haunt my nightmares. Those things, the tentacles or whatever, were charging for us at top speed while the poor bastard's body just dangled limply as it went along. The way it looked, too, was almost like whatever had happened had somehow made his bones disappear, leaving him nothing more than a fleshy sack being moved along by the tentacles. Even worse was it was in the red light when I saw it, making his empty, sagging flesh  look all the more ghoulish.

Before I even realized it, Craig was snatched up by his ankle and ripped backward. I just briefly caught a glimpse of his body whizzing by, screaming, as I kept running. I didn't dare look back again. I didn't see what happened to Craig, and I didn't want to. The last thing from him was a series of painful wailing before going silent completely. By that time, I'd made it back to the others. "GO!" I shouted. "Come on, we have to go, now!"

"Rod, what's happened, what was that?" Edna asked.

"Where's Craig?" someone else asked. I started pushing them down the hall back toward the bunker.

"Forget about him, come on!" By the time I could get the crowd moving, though, the thumping came barreling down the hall. *Oh Jesus...*

The crowd got one good look and then it was over. They couldn't clamor through that cramped crimson hallway fast enough. I can still hear the screams of the particularly unlucky few who'd tripped and were promptly trampled underfoot. Even more than them, of course, I remember the mix of the screams of people being snatched like how Craig was and the sort of gurgling roar the creature was making. I kept running, praying to God that the tentacles would stay busy with the others long enough to make it back to the bunker-- morbid and callous as that sounds.

Ironically, in a sick sort of way, I managed to make it a foot away from the bunker, only for the thing to then land right out of the air in front of me. It's rolled eyeballs, only very loosely held inside its sagging sockets, bore through mine. Its gurgling noise became a high pitched screech when I noticed that one eye wasn't actually looking at me at all, instead cocked a bit to the side to look *behind* me. My head snapped around to see all of the bodies, all looking like bloody human swiss cheese, twitching.

I did at least three double takes between the bodies and the creature, expecting him to pincushion me like the rest when I saw something even worse start to happen. Each and every one of them had begun to make that same gurgling noise, leaking red fluid from their mouths, ears, and noses like Ben was, before a loud *POP* noise erupted from each of them, where tentacles sprouted from their backs and stomachs. This thing didn't just kill them -- it infected them, too.

They all rose up and surrounded me. I was choked off, there was nowhere I could run to. My heart was speeding, my body twitching yet rigid at the same time. They all closed in on me and I brought my arms up in a last ditch effort to defend myself when I heard the one in front of me, the one in the hazmat suit from the hallway, almost split my ears in half with a wild shriek. I brought my arms down again to see Daniel with some sort of torch that he appeared to have fashioned using his handkerchief, his pipe wrench, and his cigarette lighter. "Come on, quick, before these things get in!"
