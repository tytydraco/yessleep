Imagine standing on the shores of a beautiful lake, still and vast. Now imagine that under the water before you a whole town sleeps, its streets and buildings buried in the lake. This is Birmingham, Kentucky and it lies at the bottom of one of the largest man-made lakes in the country, Kentucky Lake. 

Birmingham has been the source of lore, legends, and hauntings since it was flooded by TVA in the 1940s for hydroelectric power and flood control. The town was established in 1849 and became a thriving community that relied on the timber and stave mill business. The construction of the Kentucky Dam in the 1940s led to the inundation of Birmingham, and complete submersion of the town. The residents were forced to leave, and buildings were either torn down or left to the incoming water. 

Many of the townspeople were attacked and driven from the area. The black population that lived there since the Civil War suffered the majority of these attacks for the rich farmland of the area. The town eventually became a “sundown town”.

Today, when the water at Kentucky lake is low, you can still see building foundations and streets around Birmingham Point. The haunting stories that have come from the area are dreadfully creepy, but the town is a ghost town in the most literal sense.

About ten years ago, Tyler and I were on one of our normal fishing trips around the Big Bear area of Kentucky Lake. We’d had a few good days of fishing, but it happened to be slow that day on the water. Tyler figured we had enough crappie to feed both of our families for three or four days back at the campground. Slow fishing means small talk in the boat and he got to asking me about Birmingham. He said he’d seen some odd things in that area when he was a kid. I had heard some of the stories, but never laid eyes on the place myself, so we decided to head over and check out the area.

The water level was down the whole week, so he thought we may at least be able to see some of the foundations of what was left of the old town. He started up the motor and we headed out around Wilson Cove and on over to the point. We made our way around the point slowly so that we wouldn't hit anything with the boat. I’m not one to believe in this kind of stuff, but I don’t mind telling you that seeing the foundations stick up out of the water gave me the creeps. Tyler remembered being here when the water was up when he was a kid and seeing lanterns lit up and moving beneath the murky water. Needless to say, I thought he was just trying to get a scare out of me.

Dusk was settling in and night wouldn’t be too far behind, so he thought we should hang around and see if anything happened. We were on the lake, one of my favorite places, so I was happily along for the ride. As the sky became darker, so did the water. It was already murky from the bottom of the muddy lake being stirred around, but it seemed to turn from brown to black. 

We waited around for an hour or so after the darkness took hold, but hadn’t seen anything out of the ordinary. I noticed that there was a separate island just off the point. Tyler said it was an old cemetery. We headed over to take a look and on the way, could see a light through the trees. I figured it was probably just a camper or somebody exploring the old cemetery. As we moved in closer we could see that the light was a lantern, and someone was walking with it as it swayed in their steps rhythmically. What happened next, I’ll never forget. 

The person holding the lantern kept walking until they reached the shore of the island. We moved in closer to see if they needed help, when the person began walking again, right down into the water. Tyler yelled after them as we watched them disappear up to the knees, then waist, then chest and head, until only the lantern could be seen through the dark water. We watched the lantern in the water moving toward us, until it disappeared under our boat. A few seconds of silence went by and Tyler and I stared at each other, unable to process what we’d just seen. Then the boat started to rock from side to side. Slowly at first, but then faster and faster. As soon as the realization hit that we could be thrown overboard, I yelled at Tyler to get us out of there. That is the fastest our boat has ever been out on the water. I worried that we might run into the foundations of Birmingham or other debris sticking up out of the water, but Tyler navigated us safely back to the deeper part of the lake. As we moved away from the island, the water went back to the “normal” dark color we were used to seeing. 

On the way back to the campground, we talked about what we saw and what we should tell our families. We both agreed to keep it just between us. My wife would’ve had me committed if I’d come back spouting a story about a figure walking into the water and trying to turn our boat over. It was years before I told her about it, and even then I don’t think she believed me. I mean, I wouldn’t have.

So if you ever go around the underwater town of Birmingham, Kentucky, take precautions. Something unexplainable is going on there. People go missing on Kentucky lake all of the time, and Birmingham isn’t the only place on the lake rumored to be haunted. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.
