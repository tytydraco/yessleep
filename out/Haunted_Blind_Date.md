My best friend had been bugging me for weeks to go on a blind date with this girl he knew. She's perfect for you, he insisted. I was skeptical, but eventually, I gave in. Little did I know, this date would land me in the hospital. Her name was Lila. She was stunning, with piercing green eyes and a smile that seemed to hide secrets. We met at a cozy little restaurant downtown. The conversation flowed easily, and I found myself genuinely enjoying her company. Just when I thought the night couldn't get any better, she leaned in and asked, Do you believe in the supernatural?



I chuckled, thinking it was a joke. No, I replied, grinning. I'd only believe it if something happened to me.

Her expression changed instantly. The warmth drained from her eyes, replaced by a cold, unreadable stare. Take me home, she said quietly. We finished our meal in awkward silence. Before leaving, she excused herself to the bathroom. She was gone for what felt like an eternityâ€”fifteen minutes. When she returned, there was something different about her. Her eyes seemed darker, her smile more sinister.



We walked to my car in silence. As I drove her home, she said only one thing: When you get home, text me when it happens. I laughed nervously, not understanding what she meant. When I got home, I tried to shake off the weirdness of the night. I took a shower and got ready for bed. As I lay there, I started to feel a strange, tingling sensation in my limbs. My heart began to race, and I felt a tightness in my chest. Panic set in. I got up, feeling compelled to check the windows and doors. As I approached the living room, I saw a dark figure standing in the corner. It was tall, with long, tangled hair and eyes that glowed a sickly yellow. It was staring right at me.



I froze, unable to move or scream. The figure slowly raised a hand and pointed at me. My entire body went cold, and a chilling whisper echoed in my mind: Believe. I stumbled backward, my heart pounding in my chest. I grabbed my phone and texted Lila, my hands shaking: It's happening. Her reply came almost instantly: I told you. The figure vanished, but the terror remained. I spent the rest of the night huddled in my bed, every creak and shadow sending me into a fresh wave of panic.



The next morning, I confronted my best friend, demanding to know more about her. He looked at me, bewildered. Lila? I don't know anyone named Lila. The realization hit me like a punch to the gut. Whoeverâ€”or whateverâ€”Lila was, she wasn't just some girl my friend knew. I had encountered something far beyond my understanding, and it had marked me. That night changed me forever. I never heard from Lila again, but I couldn't forget her haunting words. When you get home, text me when it happens.
