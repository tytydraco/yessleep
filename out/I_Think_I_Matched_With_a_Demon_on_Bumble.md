I should have noticed the signs...

His Bumble profile said he was 28, but he could only meet from midnight to 2 AM.

When I matched with Alex, his hours threw me off. Midnight to 2 AM? Who only has time for a date at those hours? I asked him about it, and he was blunt but charming. "I have a demanding job," he said. "But I get a break from 12 to 2. It’s my only free time."

I figured he worked nights. Maybe security or something else that required odd hours. The truth was, he seemed cool, and I’d been having a lot of fun talking to him, so I wasn’t about to let weird hours stand in the way. We agreed to meet at a late-night diner in town. Midnight, on the dot.

Our first date was odd.

He arrived exactly at midnight, and I mean to the second. It was almost eerie how punctual he was. He walked in wearing a leather jacket, his dark hair slightly messy, with this casual confidence that made him instantly attractive even in person. I smiled as he sat down across from me, and his eyes locked on mine with this almost hypnotic intensity.

We talked easily, laughing at each other's jokes, but there was something else there. A tension. Alex kept glancing at the clock on the diner wall. I figured maybe he really had work, but the way his eyes seemed to darken every time he looked at the time made me uneasy.

“You okay?” I finally asked.

“Yeah, just… I have to be back by 2,” he said, offering a strained smile. “Non-negotiable.”

I let it go, but I couldn’t help wondering what kind of job had those kind of demands. It wasn’t like he was on call — he was here, in front of me. But at 1:45, Alex’s whole demeanor changed. His eyes darted to the clock, then back to me. He looked almost panicked.

“I need to go,” he said, standing abruptly. “I’m sorry, but I’ll see you again?”

I barely had time to respond before he was already out the door, disappearing into the night.

Every date was the same.

Alex only ever met me between midnight and 2 AM. And every time, at exactly 1:45, he would get restless, his eyes turning distant as he glanced at the clock. By 1:50, he was on his feet, rushing out the door as if his life depended on it.

It was starting to get to me. I liked him... a lot. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was hiding something. One night, as he was getting ready to leave, I asked him straight out.

“Alex, what kind of job do you have? Why can’t we meet at normal hours?”

He looked at me, his eyes narrowing for a split second before he smiled, his face softening. “You wouldn’t understand,” he said. “It’s just… complicated.”

But that wasn’t enough for me. Not anymore.

One night, I decided that I had to know.

I had to understand what was happening at 2 AM that made him run like his life depended on it. So, one night, after he rushed out of the diner, I followed him.

My heart was pounding as I trailed him, every instinct screaming that I shouldn’t be doing this. But I had to know. He didn’t take a car.

He walked, quickly, through empty streets, his footsteps echoing against the pavement. He didn’t look back, and I kept my distance, my pulse racing, my palms slick with sweat.

He led me to a neighborhood I recognized. A nice, quiet place, lined with large houses, all dark and still at this hour. My breath caught in my throat as Alex slipped through the gate of a two-story house. The lights were off, and it looked like the family inside was asleep.

I hesitated, fear prickling at my skin. I knew I should turn back. I knew I should leave, but my feet moved on their own, following him up to the side of the house.

The door was slightly ajar.

I slipped inside after him, careful not to make a sound. The air in the house was thick, oppressive, and every instinct told me I shouldn’t be there. I crept down the hallway, careful to stay quiet. The faint glow of candlelight spilled out from a room ahead, flickering and casting strange shadows on the walls. I peered around the corner, and what I saw made my stomach lurch.

Alex wasn’t alone.

In the center of the room knelt a boy, no older than fifteen. His eyes were wide with terror, his body trembling violently. Around him, a circle of candles flickered, their flames casting distorted, nightmarish shadows on the walls. The air was thick with the acrid scent of wax and something metallic, something darker.

Standing over the boy was Alex.

His eyes glowed an unnatural, deep crimson, a light that seemed to pulse with something alive. The faintest hint of horns protruded from beneath his hairline, just barely catching the light, and his shadow stretched across the room, warped and monstrous. His voice was low, a sinister rumble that seemed to reverberate in the boy’s bones, as if the words themselves had power.

“You will do as I command,” Alex hissed, each word dripping with venom. His lips curled into a malicious smile, his teeth unnaturally sharp in the candlelight. “You’ll hurt them, won’t you? Your sisters... You’ll do it quietly, while they sleep.”

The boy sobbed, shaking his head furiously. Tears rolled down his face, mingling with the sweat that had begun to bead on his forehead. His voice came out in a broken whisper, pleading. “No, please... I don’t want to—”

Alex’s face twisted into something barely human, his features contorting as his eyes burned brighter, deeper. He leaned in, his voice lowering to a cold, inescapable whisper, each syllable coated in dark promise. “But you do want to. You’ll feel the power rush through you as their breaths fade. You’ll make them pay. It’s what they deserve, isn’t it? For treating you like nothing… for making you suffer.”

The boy shuddered, his mouth opening but no sound escaping. Alex’s shadow seemed to envelop him, the darkness growing thicker, pressing in from all sides. The air grew colder, and a foul stench filled the room—the unmistakable reek of sulfur.

Alex chuckled, the sound guttural and echoing.

He straightened, his eyes flashing with a terrible fire. “I am no mere man,” he said, his voice now resonating with a depth that seemed to come from the bowels of the earth itself. His skin rippled, darkening, his form shifting to something grotesque and horned.

“I serve the almighty Satan,” Alex declared, his voice rising, each word dripping with a perverse reverence. “And tonight, you, child, will be my instrument of torment. The sins of your family… will be washed in their own blood.”

The boy’s sobs turned into a hollow wail, the room echoing with his despair, drowned only by Alex’s laughter. A sound that clawed at the edges of sanity, promising horrors yet to come.

I felt a wave of cold terror wash over me, my breath catching in my chest, my knees threatening to give out. I wanted to scream, to do something, but I was frozen, my body refusing to move. This wasn’t just a break from some demanding job. This was his job.

The boy whimpered, his body convulsing, and I watched, horrified, as Alex placed a hand on the boy’s forehead, his eyes blazing even brighter. The boy's eyes rolled back, and a guttural sound escaped his lips as he struggled, as if fighting something deep inside himself.

A shiver ran down my spine, and I stumbled backward, my foot hitting a loose floorboard with a creak. Alex’s head snapped up, his glowing eyes looking in my direction.

"One of your sisters, child?" Alex beckoned to the boy, to the room.

Alex started walking over right towards me. I knew he would find me. I could see his full demonic figure in perfect clarity. The grotesque horns, the claws, oozing blood from his orifices.

"Shall I give you a helping hand and slay the bitch?"

I literally was having a fear-induced, static-shock feeling, central-nervous-system-wrecking shit storm of a moment. I knew deep down I had seconds before I met a nightmarish end.

And then...

"Stop! Just talk to me some more," the boy screamed. "Leave her alone, please. Just talk to me!"

Alex turned back around to face the boy.

"Aah...," he started to say.

But I didn't hang around to hear the rest.

I forced myself to turn, to run. Down the stairs and out the front door, not caring how much noise I made in the process. My legs felt like they might give out beneath me, and every step was a struggle as I fled, my breath ragged, my heart pounding in my ears.

I didn’t look back. I didn’t dare.

I didn’t stop until I was home, slamming the door behind me, my entire body trembling. I collapsed against the wall, my mind racing, replaying everything I had just seen. I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think straight. All I knew was that Alex wasn’t who or what I thought he was.

I blocked his number and his profile on Bumble right away.

This all happened over the weekend.

Tonight, I have gotten a barrage of texts from a random number. I know it's him.

**WE NEED TO TALK.**

**WE CAN MEET AT MIDNIGHT.**

**I KNOW IT WAS YOU IN THE HOUSE.**

**YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO ME.**

Please be careful out there, ladies. Your bumble date might literally be a demon.
