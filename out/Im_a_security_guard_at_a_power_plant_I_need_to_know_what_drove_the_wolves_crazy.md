  

I work at Van Hydro Energy Center. Hearing "hydro energy," you might expect a dam built over a river or blocking up a lake, but this place doesn’t follow that logic. No, it was built in the middle of the woods. It uses a near-surface underground waterway or something. I don’t know the specifics beyond that, and I'm honest enough to admit that, as odd as it is, I haven't investigated any deeper. They pay me well, and my job is about as straightforward as they get.

I'll skip all the nonsense since that's not really why you're here and not why I'm writing this, but I have to describe the facility just a bit. Its central building is huge, like one of those enclosed football stadiums, with two wings - north and west. North is just offices and the cafeteria, but the west wing is a lab of some sort. I can't describe it beyond that because we don't go inside it. We patrol its perimeter at night and ensure all the doors are locked, but they don’t give us the keys. If we find any door unlocked, we report it to our boss, who reports it to his boss, and so on, until it's taken care of. Thankfully, I haven’t had to deal with that issue in the four months I’ve been here.

Around the place is a fence topped with barbed wire, with two gates on opposite sides of the facility allowing entry to the parking lot and loading docks. Around all of that, they cleared a perimeter of trees and mowed the grass, placing floodlights to illuminate the field if anything larger than a rabbit moves. It's overkill, I'd thought, but like I said, they pay me well, so I don't complain about them making my job easy.

There are seven of us on any given shift. Two per security shack next to the gates and three in the security office in the north wing. We rotate between jobs periodically, but the incident that’s got me writing this happened last night. I was in the western shack. Zack was with me. He’s a wiry guy and ex-military, so we had plenty of topics to discuss to pass the long boring hours between perimeter walks and visitors. We hadn't had anyone come by all night, which was typical. There was only one planned stop, and unscheduled arrivals were rare. We'd already done our walk at the beginning of our shift, so we were deep into our conversation, not paying attention to the street.

It was just past midnight when the floodlights clicked on suddenly, startling the hell out of us. I was on my feet, the chair rolling backward as I rose and looked across the field for whatever had triggered the lights. Thankfully, we had a mostly unobstructed view, with only the far left side of the area masked behind some of the gate's chain links.

“You see anything,” I asked after a moment. Zack hummed a no, similarly on his feet. 

We spent a minute or two staring at nothing by neatly trimmed field before he started to chuckle, “I didn’t think you could jump that high, old man,” he said, cutting the tension.

My response could have been more appropriate. We chalked the lights up to deer. Tony radioed us from the central office and confirmed that there was nothing on the cameras. We fell back into pleasant camaraderie.

Maybe an hour passed before the radio buzzed again.

“Y’all sure ya didn’t see anything earlier,” Tony asked.

“Nope,” I said, “whatever it was scampered off quick. Why?”

The radio was silent momentarily before his voice buzzed, “Eric and Amelia have had their floods go off a few times now. Nothin’ on camera, nothin’ in the field. Keep your eyes peeled. If it happens on your end again, we wanna make sure it’s an animal.”

Zack exaggeratedly rolled his eyes and I suppressed a grin at it, "will do, chief,” I responded dutifully before dropping the radio back into its charger.

“What the hell else is it gonna be,” he leaned back in his chair, “we’re too far west for bigfoot, aren’t we?”

“Nope,” I said, popping the p, “pretty sure bigfoot’s west cost.”

“Is he really,” he leaned forward now, looking out the window toward the pitch-black field. It was a cloudy night, and we couldn't see much of anything without the floodlights. The fence's security lights gave us enough light to see maybe ten feet past the road, leaving the other forty feet to the tree line wholly obscured. "Well, maybe we ought to keep our eyes peeled like the boss man suggests, see ourselves a bigfoot.”

I breathed a laugh out, “and what happens when it is? The camera on your phone's shit. Go around proclaiming bigfoot's out there and people might actually realize you’re an idiot.”

“That’s what the gun is for, Ty,” he said as he waved his hand at the gun case at the back of our shack, “I won’t need a photo if I bring a body.”

“I’m a better shot than you and I have one hand,” I shot back, “You’d be better off…”

I was interrupted as the floodlights sprang to life again. “There,” Zack said immediately.

I’d been carried away with the conversation. By the time I followed his finger there was nothing but brush and trees. "What was it?”

“No bigfoot, unfortunately,” he said with an overstated huff, “looked like a dog. Pretty big though, maybe a wolf or something.”

“I’d be amazed if it was a wolf, they’re…” I was interrupted again as, down the street, another set of floodlights lit up. I snatched the walkie, "do we have eyes on the northwest field?"

The response was immediate, “nothing on camera. Did you two see anything?”

“Zack thinks he saw a wolf.”

We waited for several minutes for a response after that. The lights in the field switched off while we waited. The darkness that followed seemed, somehow, deeper than it had before. The hairs on my neck stood as I stared into it.

“Feels like something’s looking at us from out there,” Zack said quietly.

I nodded, not speaking as I kept my eyes glued to the impenetrable wall of black. The longer I stared, the darker it seemed to get, taking over my vision inch by inch.

"Rangers say there aren’t any packs out this way,” Tony’s voice cut through as I looked down at the radio, “Y’all sure it wasn’t a coyote?”

“That wasn’t a fucken coyote,” Zack said, “It was big. Seventy feet away and it looked big. Coyote don’t get that big.”

“We’re pretty sure it wasn’t a coyote,” I responded.

The radio was silent again and I set it down. “Anything other than a wolf you think it might’ve been,” I asked as I focused on the darkness again, waiting for the light to snap on again. Zack was a hunter. He bragged about being one, at the very least.

“This far out,” he said with a thoughtful hum, “Coywolf, maybe. I don't think they're common around these parts, though. Malamute or a husky would fit the profile from this distance, too. It was a damn big dog. Not a whole lotta things fit that profile."

A light flicked on around the far north side of the complex. Farther than we could see but close enough that we saw the light. Zack and I both stared at it as another near it lit up. Suddenly the field in front of us was bright again and I was on my feet again. My body was tight as my eyes raced across everything, looking for movement. I took in everything in an instant, but the field was empty. 

That there wasn’t nothing there failed to bring me comfort, though. This didn't feel like animals running around in the woods. This felt intentional. This felt prodding. “Are any of those animals smart enough to test a lighting system?"

“Not a damn one.” Zack moved away from our desk, his keys jangling as he pulled them from his pocket. He opened the safe, pulling out a rifle first, checking it, and slinging it over his shoulder before he did the same with a handgun.

He handed me a pair of earplugs before he handed me the gun. I took them gratefully. We sat there in our shack for the next half hour. Lights came on and off intermittently, never seeing more than a whooshing of movement as whatever it was ducked back into the cover of the tree line. Tony was on the radio on and off, but he didn’t sound like he had a single clue about what was happening, and every time the radio buzzed I felt the muscles in my back tense and twitch. Nothing happened though. The lights went on and off, but nothing happened.

Then we saw headlights.

I recognized the truck as it pulled toward us. A quick glance at our desk's clock told me it was right on time. The driver turned his truck wide outside the gate and swerved in, bringing the whole trailer behind him. I felt a chill down my spine as a howl sounded from the forest's darkness. Then another and another. They echoed faintly through the glass panes of our little shack, and as Zack pressed the button to shut the gate behind the driver, who was hanging halfway out his window and waving to us, the power went out.

"Hell," I spat out as I moved around Zack and ripped the door open. The emergency power hadn’t turned on yet, but I could see the man from the light of his truck. He was waving like an idiot with his headset on and covering his ears. “Get over here!”

He shot me a confused look and opened his door, “what’s going on,” he asked, removing his headset and tossing it onto his seat as he took a step down.

I was ripped backward before I could respond. I whirled around to yell, but my words died in my throat when I saw a massive wolf tearing across the street, dimly illuminated in the red glow of the truck's brake lights. Zack pushed passed me roughly, and with a warning shout of "wolves," he pulled the door shut just as the beast reached it. Up close, silhouetted by the semi's light, it was even bigger than I'd thought. I had to ask myself how we'd missed it before, but seeing how fast it was, it wasn't a surprise.

My heartbeat slammed in my chest as it snarled and clawed at the door. Zack backed away from the door, shouldering his rifle as he fell into line next to me. “That’s the biggest wolf I’ve ever seen,” he said, his voice calmer than his posture.

The emergency power kicked in and the lights came back on. I wish they hadn't. I'd zeroed in on the monster of an animal in front of me. But, in the darkness, I'd missed the other two in the gate yard. Then, with the light returned, I saw them both just as the larger of the two slammed into the truck driver. He went down fast, his head crashing into the pavement as he hit the ground. The wolf trotted off of him as he lay there dazed. His head swiveled around erratically as he worked his jaw soundlessly.

I let out another curse as the third wolf dove in, its jaws clasping around the man's neck violently, blood pooling on the asphalt under him instantly. I turned away, grabbing the handgun off the desk I'd left it on as I cursed again. 

“You’re welcome,” Zack said, his voice still calm.

I wasn’t calm. I could feel my heartbeat in my ears as I whirled around without reason and screamed at the wolf that still stood at our door. I wasn’t thankful he’d pulled me back at that moment. Wasn't grateful that I had to see that man die. Because he was dead. With a neck wound like he was gone.

“What the hell is happening down there,” Tony’s panicked voice came through the radio.

Zack got to it first: " Where did our power go? This is a god damned power plant. How in the hell did we lose power?" he shouted instead of answering.

I reached out and snatched the radio from his hand, “The driver’s down, bleeding badly," I glanced back at the man. He was dead. He wouldn't survive, but I couldn't just do nothing about it. "We need to get these wolves out of the yard and get EMS in here now. This guy isn’t going to make it without life flight.”

“We need to know why the power went out!”

I rounded on him, "A guy is dying out there, we can figure out the power later!"

“Charlie and Kent are on their way to you, hang tight,” Tony said.

“He’s already dead, Ty. You know that.” Zack said. “But those wolves howled and the god damned power went out, we need to know why.” His voice was tight, and his eyes flicked from me to the door behind me.

“It was a coincidence,” I told him. I don’t know if I believe it was, but I still said it because… what else could it have been?

“A coincidence,” he hissed, “they were testing the floodlights. They were trying to get close without us seeing them.”

A wolf slammed against the window of the shack. We both surged away from the impact. Zack aimed his rifle toward the window, and I looked back to the yard beyond the door. The three were still there. They’d given up on the man, though, ignoring the meal that he was to stare at us with their maws agape, blood and saliva dripping from their teeth as their low growl reverberated through the glass.

Another wolf slammed against the glass, cracks splintering from the bloodstain it left behind as it fell to the ground and sprinted to the darkness again. I saw Zack’s hands twitch as it happened, his finger hovering over the trigger guard. “It’s bulletproof glass,” I said, “they can crack it all day. They're never coming through it.”

Another wolf impacted the glass, shattering it further. This time, to my dismay, I saw the bolts where the glass was fastened to the building shake.

“They’re gonna break it down,” Zack said as he nodded rapidly, an unhinged smile spreading across his lips. “They’re not gonna shatter it. They're gonna break it off the wall. That’s perfectly normal for a wolf. That’s a thing they do.”

Another slam came. Then another after that. I squeezed the handle of the gun tightly with every charge. I flinched again when the sound of a gun rang out from the parking lot, and yelping drew my attention back to the three waiting outside our door. One was low to the ground and I could see the spot where it’d been hit.

“They’re here,” I breathed. The truck was in the lot beyond the gate, Charlie out of it already, rifle at his shoulder, while Kent was moving to join him.

Another wolf hit the window, causing the bent and malformed glass to break free at the top.

More shots rang out, and, against every instinct, I moved toward the broken window pocketing the pistol as I did and pressed the button to shut the outer gate. The wolf’s yelped as they were fired on, the one that had been first hit falling to the ground as the other two started to flee through the shutting gate. I opened the inner gate as I saw them run. "Come on, we’re going!”

I opened the door and stepped out, turning to usher Zack past me. He wasn’t there though. He was staring at the broken glass, his eyes wide and terrified. I didn't have time to react past that. The window was hit again, and it caved. A wolf flailed through the broken pane and crashed into him. The rifle went off, but I couldn’t tell if the wolf had been hit. It thrashed around on top of him. I heard him grunt in pain as the wolf righted itself, snarling at me through broken teeth as it faced me. 

I thought, at that moment, that it was going to dive at me. It was less than five feet from me. I could feel its breath as it huffed. It didn't though. It reared back and turned, bringing its teeth down on Zack. I pulled my pistol free as quickly as possible and fired until the magazine was empty. Charlie and Kent were with me then, and they helped me pull its body off him. 

Zack was in bad shape. We moved him quickly, conscious that just shifting him brought out a groan of pain. We got him in the back of the truck. I kneeled awkwardly on the floor between seats, trying to keep him still as Charlie and Kent entered the front and drove away from the gate.

He was dazed. Delirious, really. He was muttering incoherently as I tried to keep him still. One thing came through clearly, though, and I don't know what it means. "Not a wolf," he said. He said it again and again. Out of order sometimes. But it was some combination of those three words.

We got to the main building. Eric, Amelia, and Tony were all there and they helped get Zack inside.

Nothing happened the rest of the night. No howls, no wolves blowing through windows. Tony and Eric had first aid training, so they tried to take care of Zack, but I was still relieved when I heard the helicopter. I’m at the hospital now. I was covered in Zack’s blood and apparently non-responsive enough that EMS took me with them.

Zack's okay. He will be, at least. A lot of new scars but… alive. He’s asleep still. Will be for a while, I imagine. 

Tony's called me a dozen times, but I haven't answered. I don't know what to say. Everything is so surreal that I can't get Zack's words out of my head. Not a wolf. What did he mean? What did he see that had him so terrified he couldn’t even move? 

I’m… not a person that believes in campfire stories. Those wolves were massive, though, and they were brilliant. I know wolves are intelligent, but I've been on my phone all morning reading about them, and they're not *that* smart. They don’t test defenses like that. They sure as hell don't throw themselves at a bulletproof window with so much force that they break it off the wall.

It wasn't normal. But if that's true, if it was something abnormal, then I don't know what happened last night, and I need to know what happened. I said earlier that this job pays decent. I was underselling it. But, with me being at the end of the story and with my fingers shaking again, I'll say that I'm not in a position where I can afford to lose this job. The thought of going back out there though… Please if anyone knows anything about wolves acting crazy, or being too smart, even if the answer isn’t normal, please contact me. There has to be some explanation for everything that happened. There needs to be.
