Thursday evening. Too tired to do anything productive, not tired enough to go to bed. Time for a cheap dinner and a true crime YouTube video on the TV. Volume up loud. Feet up. 





"*This video is brought to you by---*"





Skip 30 seconds. 





The horrifying case of \[REDACTED\]. Oh, that's funny. He shares my name. 





The narrator explains the intricacies of the case. My brain theorises.





How could an unassuming young man be the victim of such an evil-spirited crime and there be no leads?





TV off. Brain still whizzing with ideas. Time to turn that off, too. Friday is a big day at work, rest is important. Sleep eventually comes.





A knock awakens me. The red lights of the alarm clock on the nightstand read 4 AM. 





Who the fuck is knocking at 4 AM?





I open the door. Nobody. Not a soul. A little pink coloured note lies on the bristled doormat.





"*Welcome to the show.* 





*Kisses.*"





I figure it was a dream. Or a nightmare. Slapping myself ought to wake me up. 





Slap.





Slap.





Slap.





No luck. Now I'm confused and have red cheeks. The note is the same as the one described in the video from last night. The note that started it all. Was somebody playing a stupid prank on me? How would they even know what I had been watching last night? 





Head is spinning now. Sleep won't come and the note mocks me from the pillow beside mine. The first sunlight of the day peeking through my blinds jars me. I notice another note slipped under the door. Part of me knows what it'll read. Another part tries to forget. 





"*Tick.* 



*Tock.* 



*Tick.* 



*Tock.* 



*Tick.* 



*Tock.*"





Heart sinks. The note is less pink and more red this time. I place it on top of the older one. They both sit. 





Awaiting the next. 





Work could wait. That thing today isn't important anymore. They'll understand when I show them the video. 





The video. 





I try to find it again. Type, search, scroll. Over and over. It hides from me. Out of sight, never out of mind.





Maybe the video was a warning?





I pace around the bedroom. Theorising. Planning a way out. The next note would be hand-delivered.





Maybe the video was a taunt? 





Barricading the door could work. Good idea. The couch works perfectly. I push it along the linoleum floor and it sits just right underneath the handle. I'm safe. They can't get in. 





The video had to be a taunt. 





That's why I could never find it again. 





They were playing with their food. 





The clock ticks along. Tick. Tock. They'll be arriving soon. Sundown, supposedly. 





The last ray of sunlight fizzles out. 





*Knock.* 





*Knock.*





*Knock.* 





Polite. Timely. No words. No response from me, either. I stand frozen. Hoping for some otherworldly intervention. It doesn't come.





*Knock.*





*Knock.* 





*Knock.*





It grows louder. Then louder. Then louder. 





The door handle rattles. The frame heaves. Over and over. It'll give way soon. 





It does. 







A tall man in a hood and glasses. Shadowy. Anonymous. A blood-red note clutched in his hands. He places it on the floor. Slides it across to me. 







"*I thank you for your viewership oh-so-kindly.* 







*Kisses.*"







He lumbers over to me. Cleaver in hand. A blank portrait of a man. Time slows to a crawl. I try to run. To throw the nearest objects at him. No luck. He lumbers still. Slowly. Deliberate. 







Tongue was the first to go. Tongue went agonisingly. Unhurriedly. Blood spewed all over. Screams lowered in volume until the tongue was all gone. Then nothing. Not for want of trying. Fingers went next. One by one until ten. 





Consciousness went at the same time.  





A ray of sunlight jolted me awake once again. Morning. Saturday. I lay in a drying pool of viscous crimson-red blood. Screams are still stifled. I shuffle towards the nightstand to grab the phone. I need help. The notes still lay there. Perfectly preserved. The most important one atop the others. 







"*911 what is your emergency?*" 







No words. 







"*If you can't talk right now, please use the keypad to answer my questions."*







*"Are you hurt? Please press 1 on your keypad for yes and press 2 for no*."







Instinct leads to blood on the keypad from stubby "fingers". I use my knuckles instead. 







"1".







"*Do you need immediate assistance? Again, press 1 on your keypad for yes and press 2 for no.*"





It hurts. I switch knuckles.





"1".







"*Thank you, we will send a unit as soon as possible. Please stay on the line.*"







Pain sears through my body. My now incomplete body. I wait. 







*Knock.* 





*Knock.*





*Knock.*





Instinct screams at me. A mundane sound now takes on an intensely sinister energy. 





I freeze, again.







This time, the right people break in. 







I pass out, again. 







A hospital room greets me the next time I awake. He did more damage than I thought. 13 weeks in a coma. Learning to walk again. To talk. To be something resembling normal.







Every day I find myself looking for that video.







Every day it remains out of sight.
