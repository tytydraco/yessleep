# I took the night shift because it paid more. That was really all there was to it. I wasn’t in it to “help people” or “give back to the community.” Bills were piling up. Student loans. Rent. My car’s alignment was shot, and I needed a new pair of shoes. So when they offered a few extra dollars an hour to cover nights at the hospital, I didn’t even blink.

The place was called D.F Memorial. It was one of those huge concrete-block buildings from the 50s, the kind with green-tinted windows and humming fluorescents that flicker when you walk under them. The newer part of the hospital had touchscreens and those sleek rolling beds with built-in speakers. But the wing I got assigned to? It was older. No touchscreens. No music. Just linoleum tile floors with hairline cracks running through them, a bunch of rusty handrails, and the smell of antiseptic that never went away no matter how many times the place got cleaned.

The nurse who trained me, Marla, was about five-foot-two and never looked me in the eye. She had this wide-eyed way of speaking, like she was always waiting for someone to interrupt her. She handed me a clipboard, and I noticed her hands shook a little. Not a lot, just enough.

“You’ll be covering Ward C,” she said. “It’s sealed off from the main floor, but there’s a corridor that still connects through the stairwell. Maintenance left the lights on low for safety.”

“What kind of patients?” I asked.

She hesitated. “You’ll see.”

Ward C had been shut down in the early 2000s after some kind of renovation budget got cut. Supposedly it was only used now for overflow, but no one ever said overflow from what. The place hadn’t seen paint in two decades. The hallway leading to it was lined with storage bins and old wheelchairs with shredded vinyl seats. Someone had draped a plastic tarp over a gurney, and it bulged in the middle like something was still underneath it.

I hated how quiet it got back there. The kind of quiet where your ears start ringing just to remind you you’re still alive.

The door to Ward C was this heavy fire-rated thing with a steel handle and a faded “Authorized Personnel Only” sticker that had peeled halfway off. The key they gave me stuck a little when I turned it. I had to push with my shoulder to get it open.

The lights buzzed when they came on, but they stayed dim. Just enough to see a few feet ahead. There were six rooms in the ward. Three on each side. A narrow nurse’s station at the end with a flickering monitor that didn’t seem to be connected to anything.

And patients. Four of them.

They didn’t speak. They didn’t move much, either. I checked their names on the chart: Howard M., Edith K., Lyle D., and “Unidentified Male #3.” No birth dates listed. No diagnosis. No scheduled medications. Just vitals. Stable. Monitored nightly.

The first thing I noticed was that they all stared straight up. Didn’t matter if I walked in, coughed, even waved a hand in front of their faces. They just lay in their beds and stared at the ceiling, eyes open, unblinking. I touched Edith’s wrist to check her pulse and she flinched a little but didn’t look at me.

Then I noticed the walls.

In each of the rooms, near the doors, someone had scratched something into the paint. Deep enough that you could still see it through three layers of whitewash. The same sentence in all four rooms:

“Close the door before it comes.”

Not “if.” Not “maybe.” Just “before it comes.”

That first night, I thought it was just some kind of leftover psych ward graffiti. I figured maybe they stuck the long-term mental health cases in here and left them to rot. Or maybe one of the nurses got bored and decided to mess with the new hire. I wrote it off. Made my rounds. Clocked out. Drove home in silence.

But when I got back the next night, the hallway felt colder. Like the air had been pulled tight. I told myself it was just the HVAC being weird in the old part of the building. But something about the place stuck to me.

You know when you walk into a room and you just know someone else is there, even if you can’t see them? That’s what it felt like. Except it wasn’t someone. It was something.

And it was waiting.

The second night started the same way. Cold air. Dead hallway. No sound except my own shoes sticking to the tile. I buzzed in through the stairwell, passed the old vending machine with its cracked screen, and opened the door to Ward C.

Something felt off right away.

I hadn’t touched anything the night before—just checked vitals, logged time, left. But now, the supply cabinet was open. Not all the way, just a crack, enough for the door to cast a slice of shadow across the floor. I didn’t remember leaving it like that. It made me pause.

I walked to the first room—Room 1, Howard M. Still lying flat, eyes open, neck craned up like he was tracking something above him. I looked up. Just the ceiling tiles, fluorescent light flickering behind a frosted plastic cover. Same as last night.

But this time, Howard’s lips moved.

Not much. Just a twitch, like he was mouthing something. I leaned closer. His eyes didn’t shift. His gaze locked on that same stretch of stained ceiling. I was inches from his face, and I could hear it now. The faintest rasp.

"Don’t open it..."

I stepped back fast. My heart was already in my throat. I grabbed my clipboard, pretending I hadn’t heard him. Marked his vitals. Normal. BP slightly elevated, but nothing extreme.

In Room 2, Edith K. had her hands folded tight over her chest like she was praying. But her fingers were moving, small repetitive twitches, as if she was counting silently. Or signaling.

Room 3 was empty. The bed was stripped and bare, tucked tight. I didn’t think much of it until I realized I hadn’t noticed an empty room last night.

I went to the station, checked the file again.

It still said four patients.

Howard M. Edith K. Lyle D. Unidentified Male #3

But only three rooms were occupied.

Room 4—Lyle D. Same position. Staring at the ceiling. Pupils dilated too wide for the room’s light. When I leaned in to check his pulse, he let out this sharp exhale. I jumped. He didn’t blink. Just said, barely above a whisper:

“Don’t leave it open.”

Same words. Different voice.

My stomach turned. I went to Room 5. That was the one with Unidentified Male #3. The door was closed. I remembered leaving it that way. But now, the handle was ice cold. Not room temp. Not slightly cool. I mean cold, like something pulled the heat right out of the metal.

I pushed it open and felt immediate resistance, like the air itself was thicker inside. The man was lying perfectly still. Just like the others. Except his eyes weren’t on the ceiling. They were wide open. And pointed at me.

I froze.

He blinked once. Slow. Like he was registering me. Then his head tilted, not fast, not dramatic. Just a slow lean, like he was adjusting to hear better.

And then he smiled.

It wasn’t friendly. It wasn’t even human. It was the kind of smile you see when someone knows something they shouldn’t. When they’ve been watching too long.

I backed out of the room and shut the door behind me. I tried to laugh it off. Thought maybe I was too tired. Maybe I was reading into it too much. But the scratches on the walls didn’t help.

Because now, the message had changed.

In Room 2, under “Close the door before it comes,” a new line had been scratched in. Thin. Fresh. You could still see the white dust where the paint flaked off.

“It watches when the door stays open.”

No one else had been in the ward. I was the only nurse assigned there. Security said the cameras had stopped working years ago in that wing. I even asked Marla if she had checked in behind me. She shook her head fast and said, “I never go in there anymore.”

“Why not?” I asked.

She just said, “We aren’t supposed to reopen that ward. It was meant to be sealed.”

That word stuck with me. Sealed. Like something had been trapped there. Or kept in.

Later that night, the hallway lights blinked out. All of them. Not just a flicker. Full black. I had to use my phone’s flashlight to find the panel and reset the switch.

When they came back on, Room 3—the one that was empty before—had its door wide open.

And the bed wasn’t empty anymore.

I stood outside Room 3 for a long time.

It had been empty the night before. That was the one thing I was sure of. I remember the way the plastic mattress looked without the sheet, that pale blue texture that always reminded me of swimming pool liners. But now it was made. Tight hospital corners. Blanket drawn up to the chest. And someone was in the bed.

They weren’t asleep. I could see the rise and fall of the blanket with their breath.

The door was open, but just barely, the way someone might leave it if they weren’t sure they wanted it open in the first place. I hesitated before pushing it. My fingers brushed the edge of the wood. It was damp. Not wet, but soft, like the humidity had soaked into it overnight.

Inside, the person in the bed didn’t move. Their face was turned to the wall. A curtain had been half-drawn across the space, but not enough to hide them. I stepped in slowly, trying not to make a sound.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. It wasn’t what you expect in a hospital. Not antiseptic. Not soap. It was more like soil. Damp earth. Basement concrete after a flood. I looked up. The vent above the bed was dripping. Thin trails of water traced down the wall, darkening the paint.

The person turned over.

She was a woman, probably mid-forties. Dark hair. Pale skin. But what froze me was her mouth. It had been sewn shut.

Stitches. Real ones. Thick black thread pulled through the lips, looped over and under like a child’s first attempt at embroidery. Her eyes were wide. She saw me. Her body trembled like she was trying to speak, trying to scream, but couldn’t.

I stepped back. My heel caught on the leg of the bed behind me and I stumbled. The curtain rattled on its rod. She jerked toward the sound, as if it had triggered something in her.

She lifted one hand.

Her fingers made a slow, deliberate motion. Not waving. Not pointing. Writing.

She traced letters in the air, over and over.

C L O S E

I backed into the hall.

The hallway lights flickered again, like they had the night before. This time, the flicker lasted longer. I stood still, afraid to move. When the lights came back up, the door to Room 3 was shut again.

And the message on the wall in Room 2 had changed.

The older lines were still there, but underneath them, another had appeared. This one was longer, more rushed. The scratches overlapped, letters jagged and uneven like whoever wrote it couldn’t hold still.

It heard the door. Now it’s listening.

At that point, I should have called someone. Should have gotten on the radio. Walked out. I didn’t.

Instead, I did another round.

I started with Howard. His vitals were the same. But now his hands were pressed flat against the mattress. His fingers had dug into the sheets. He wasn’t moving, but his knuckles were white.

I checked Edith next. She was still in the same position, but her head had turned ever so slightly. Her eyes weren’t on the ceiling anymore.

They were looking at the vent.

I followed her gaze. The same damp stain had formed there too. The water had spread, darkening the ceiling tiles in a wide, uneven bloom. I could hear it now. Not a drip. A hiss.

Room 4 was worse.

Lyle was sitting up. I found him that way. Not gradually waking, not groggy. Just fully upright, legs over the edge of the bed, back rigid, hands in his lap. He was looking right at me when I walked in.

He said nothing.

But he pointed at the window. The blinds were down. I walked over, unsure what I was supposed to see. I pulled one slat down with my finger.

The outside hallway was dark.

No, darker than dark. No exit lights. No emergency signs. It looked like the world had stopped on the other side of that glass. But just as I let the slat fall back into place, I caught a flash of movement.

Something small. Low to the ground. Crawling.

When I turned back to Lyle, he was lying down again.

No memory of sitting. No sign he had ever moved. His hands were back on his chest, folded like before.

That was when I heard the door.

Not one of the patient doors. The main one. The thick one at the end of the hall. The one we weren’t supposed to leave open.

It creaked. Slowly. Painfully.

And then it stopped.

Just a little open.

Not enough to see through. Just enough to know it wasn’t shut anymore.

I walked toward it. My legs felt wrong. Numb, almost. The kind of sensation you get right before a fever breaks. As I got closer, I could hear something from the other side. Not movement. Not footsteps. Breathing.

But not normal breathing either.

It was slow. Deliberate. The kind of sound a person makes when they want to be heard.

The vent above me groaned. Something shifted inside it.

And then something small landed on my shoulder.

It was wet.

I reached up and touched it. My fingers came back dark. Not red. Black.

Thick. Smelled like rust and rot and something worse.

And when I looked down the hallway again, Room 3 was open.
