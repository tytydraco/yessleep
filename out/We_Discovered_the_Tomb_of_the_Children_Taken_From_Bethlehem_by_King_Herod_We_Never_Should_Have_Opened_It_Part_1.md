Growing up, I was always fascinated by the Herodian dynasty. Salome, the briefly mentioned younger sister of King Herod, was the member who had always stood out to me. I knew she would have lived quite an extraordinary life, and I felt sorry that ancient historians only deemed minimal moments of her life worthy to be recorded. My admiration was so great that I made her a prominent character in a historical fiction series I wrote as a little side gig.

I would later complete a doctorate in Classical Near-Eastern Antiquity, where I chose to do my research paper on the life and brief reign of Herod’s sister. I would eventually graduate, and start working as a Historian at a Museum in Rome.

My research paper on Salome turned out to be the most in-depth analysis of her character available to the academic world. Some even considered it an “authority” on all Salome research and thus another monumental paper to add to the deep library of existing Herodian content. It was an honour to have had my research regarded so highly.

 I would soon wish I had never written it. If I hadn’t, perhaps I never would have received that unexpected phone call from Naeem Alami, a Palestinian Historian.

When my phone rang, the screen displayed a strange international number that I initially thought was spam. Looking back now, I wish I had gone with my usual gut feeling with such calls, and declined it. But I answered. And boy you have no idea how glad I was that I did. Hindsight is such a bitch.

Butterflies fluttered in my guts and goose flesh prickled my arms as Naeem filled me in on a new Herodian-era archaeological find that was currently being excavated, himself being the head of research for the dig. Apparently, it was discovered shortly after a minor earthquake struck the Jordan Valley a few months prior. A group of local boys from a village located within the Westbank called Fasayil had been shooting targets in the hill country to the west of their village when one of them stumbled upon the remains of what must have been a recent landslide caused by the earthquake. What had once been a hill that the boy had frequented often, was now reduced to a rugged rubble-strewn embankment. The boy had been analysing this new feature when something caught his eye. About a foot above the base of the embankment was the image of an open palmed hand carved into the rock. Within the palm was an inscription in ancient Hebrew.

Palestinian authorities were quickly notified, and a renowned West Bank politician, Suffian Al-Masri, hastily commissioned the dig and employed Naeem as head of research.

The excavations had only just commenced but based off the brief description inscribed within the open palm, Naeem was quite confident in what the find might be.

 The tomb of Herod the Great. 

My stomach lurched at this development.

The first thing that came to my mind - *screamed* in my mind - was *why contact me*? Yes, my resume indicated a thorough understanding of Salome, which naturally inclined a heavy understanding of Herodian history in general. But I didn't believe it qualified me as someone worthy to be contacted about a potential burial site of Herod! Gosh, there were scores of university professors and academics out there, some who had spent most of their lives studying Herod. Being such a prominent figure in both historical and biblical contexts, he was in one of the most studied figures in all of history! 

The other thing that swiftly occurred to me was that Herod’s tomb had *already* been discovered, back in 2007. Using Josephus’ written accounts of Herod’s death and burial within the ancient fortress of Herodium as the blueprint for a guide, archaeologists conducted an excavation on the site. Sure enough, a tomb had been discovered that lined up perfectly with Josephus’ description. There had been several arguments against this belonging to Herod due to the modesty of the tomb, which for such an eccentric individual renowned for his architectural wonders, seemed inconsistent. Having visited the site several times myself, it was definitely hard to favour one of the arguments over the other.

Clearly, if excavations had just begun, the only evidence Naeem had of this being Herod's tomb was the contents of the inscription within the hand. I asked him what it said.

I was startled by an unexpected hesitancy in his tone as he spoke it to me: 

*I, Salome, Toparch of Jamnia, Azotus, and Phasaelis, Daughter of Antipater of Idumea, has commissioned this to honour her brother, Herod ben Antipater, King of Judea, who is imprisoned within. To who it be that look upon this monument, do no more than read that which is inscribed on these walls. Let the Kings torment remain contained.*

A chill ran down my spine.

There was a drawn-out silence as my mind processed it. *Imprisoned within? King’s torment remain contained?* All of this written within the symbol of the open hand? For those who do not know, the open hand, or *Hamsa*, was a commonly used symbol in ancient times to ward off evil. Many have been found on artifacts across a whole range of Eurasian cultures. But never on the tomb of a renowned king. The inscription within it made the place sound more like some torture chamber of the damned.

 If Salome had supposedly commissioned whatever this thing was, it had definitely been overlooked in my thorough research of her. It *was* found a few kilometres west of Fasayil, which in Antiquity had been the city of Phasaelis, one of those inherited by Salome after her brother’s death, and - according to my research paper - the place she resided the most during the latter years of her life. Based off that, it might be plausible that she was behind it.

 But what Salome had written within the *Hamsa* symbol stumped me hard. During my intense research for the paper I wrote, I found absolutely nothing in the records to suggest any enmity held towards Herod; Nothing that would possibly incline her to want to *imprison him,* or *contain his torment*. On the contrary, the two siblings seemed to share a particularly strong bond that lasted the entirety of their lives, even throughout Herod’s final years of “madness”. I could never imagine Salome having her brother buried in a location even more remote than that which the poor and infirmed had usually been laid to rest.

Naeem must have sensed these questions ringing through my mind and assured me that this was a rather “complex” find. He admitted that the tomb found in 2007 was definitely a more likely candidate for Herod’s tomb. Regardless, he was apt to find an explanation for the inscription. Suffian was relentless in his demands to have the place analysed down to the last stone, and would not allow Naeem to rest until it was. Of everyone tied to the dig, it was Suffian who was most convinced that it was the tomb of Herod.

And so, it came to the reason of me being contacted.

Due to Salome’s - my bread and butter - connection to the site, Naeem wanted to fly me over so that I could assist him and his team in painting a clearer picture of what this place might be whilst the excavations were still taking place. My heart leaped at the offer which at the time was simply too good to refuse. Despite being exposed to rich Roman history through my well-paying job at the museum, I thirsted for more exposure to cultures from the Levant.

So, I agreed. And how I wish I hadn’t…

For the rest of the phone-call I was provided with all the information needed to assist me with a smooth transition to my new role. Accommodation and meals were to be provided at the site. Payment was quite generous but it would only be received if a strict condition was met; No word of what we were doing was to leave the research site. Suffian’s order.

Naeem went on to explain Suffian’s intense paranoia of Israel finding out and taking over the dig. Being so certain that this was Herod's tomb, Suffian wanted Palestine to receive all the credit for the find once it was fully analysed. He had strictly enforced that only Palestinians were to work on the site. It had taken an insufferable amount of persuasion for Naeem to convince Suffian to allow me to be contacted.

I personally cared little for politics, so had no quarrel with respecting their wish. What I did care for, was Naeem’s consideration of me. I thanked him earnestly for the opportunity and looked forward to meeting him in person.

So, I got all my affairs in Italy sorted, handed my resignation in, and by the end of the week touched down in Israel.

I was received by a dour looking man holding out a sign with my name printed on it. He had the look of a military man and I was quite intimidated by him. His name was Hamza and he would be my escort to the site. We drove in silence all the way to the checkpoint, unease churning my guts the entire time. I couldn't help feeling like an imprisoned fugitive. I assured myself that this Suffian must have deemed it a necessary precaution to ensure all chances of me slipping my tongue in Israeli occupied territory was eliminated. We eventually crossed the checkpoint and entered the Palestinian occupied territory of the West Bank.

As we crossed the border, Hamza’s composure softened, the burden of Israeli scrutiny visibly lifted from his shoulders. We were soon joined by several other vehicles and for the remainder of the drive, I rode in what I knew from outside must have looked like an armed convoy.

We eventually arrived in Fasayil, and soon turned onto an off-road track that led up to the western hills. My eyes watered and squinted until they were little more than tiny slits as I gazed out of the dust smeared window. The haze from the heat, combined with the white hue of the surrounding limestone hills made me regret forgetting my sunglasses.

15 minutes later we arrived at the base. I jumped out of the car and shook the dust off my clothes as I looked around at the site that was to be my world for the foreseeable future. The convoy had parked on what seemed to be the only decent plateau in the area large enough to make a base on. A row of demountable buildings lined the north edge with various shipping containers scattered amongst them. Some gazebo tents had been erected near these buildings where people were coming in and out. Tables had been set up within the shade of these tents containing what I deemed to be finds from the site to be recorded and analysed. More tents and shipping containers lined the southern side of the plateau but the most notable feature was the large 100 tonne mobile crane. Its outriggers were setup on the very edge of the cliff where its arm extended out. From the top of the arm a long lifting cable ran all the way back down, its end hidden from my view as it plunged to the base of the cliff.

Hamza approached the crane and spoke to one of the Dogmans, his hand gestures clearly indicating for the cable to be brought back up to the plateau. The Dogman looked over the cliff, spoke something into his two-way-radio, then signalled for the crane operator to bring the cable back up. The crane’s engine began to roar as the hydraulics kicked into action and I watched the cable begin to be wound back up through the pulley.

A steel cage came out of the cliff, connected to the cable via four evenly spaced chains fastened to a hook. It swayed like a pendulum as the crane began to turn and lower it a few feet from where I was standing.

Hamza approached it and removed one of the steel bars that seemingly acted as the door. He was given two hard hats and entered the cage, gesturing for me to do the same. I hesitated for a moment, the surface rust on the cage suddenly standing out like stains on a white shirt. The thing was just big enough for two people to stand shoulder to shoulder and looked incredibly sketchy. One of the Dogmen noted my reluctance and laughed, slapping me on the shoulder and assuring me it was safe.

“Get in,” Hamza said in a tone that I knew would get me nowhere arguing against.

Adrenaline pumped through my veins as I placed the hardhat onto my head and the crane hoisted us up into the air. I held one of the bars for dear life while the cage swayed, and fought the nausea churning in my guts. Hamza meanwhile, was lighting a cigarette.

The crane turned and momentarily held us high up over the cliff where my unease was slightly sated by the breathtaking view.  Despite all the haze, to my east the well irrigated fields of the Jordan valley shone like pearls in murky water. The crane began to bring us slowly down, and my view switched to the area below us. I thought the cage we were in was sketchy, but compared to the terrain below us it was like a concrete slab. What I had thought to be a cliff was actually an extremely sharp embankment filled with myriads of loose stones of various sizes. Several electric extension leads connected to generators atop the plateau weaved between these stones. A makeshift net system had been set up along the face of the embankment to catch any rocks that might tumble down. It didn’t look far from reaching capacity. Several feet below it, was a large cubed shape cage built on top of what little solid ground there was at the base. It sat snug between the embankment and a large pile of rubble from the initial landslide that had settled at the bottom. The steel meshing was extremely fine, and was clearly made to be durable for many rocks were scattered over it.

“The last line of defence,” Hamza said as he puffed out smoke, noticing where I was looking. “Now I know what it must have been like storming a fortified wall during a siege. Instead of falling arrows, it’s the damned rocks we have to constantly watch for. The dig is in there.”

I had no idea what I was expecting to see within that mesh, but it definitely wasn’t the tomb of Herod the Great. Gosh, it took a fucking crane to get us down to it and that was after a landslide revealed it in the first place. Yes, I knew that time could greatly alter landscapes to make a once easily accessible place become extremely difficult. From our position I could even see a logical explanation for the place being lost to the landscape over the millennia. There was an abundance of dried out water trails which ran along the hills and drained into larger gullies which would eventually water the Jordan valley at their lowest point. Who knew how much sediment had been carried down these courses over the years? There could also have been other landslides caused by earthquakes lost to history.

The crane touched us down atop the mesh structure. Hamza jumped out and opened a manhole where I saw the first rung of a ladder welded to the wall. “Just a short trip down the ladder and you’ll be there.”

Hamza held open the manhole as I brought my feet onto the first ladder rung. It was just a matter of luck that I noticed the tiny movement just above us. I jolted my head as though it had touched a hot stove and felt something fly past my face. There was a loud clang and I saw a large soccer-ball sized rock settle on the mesh. A foot away from my head was a large dent that had not been there a second earlier.

“That was close.” Hamza chuckled uneasily. “The Spirit of the King mustn’t like your presence.”

Looking back now, in a way he wasn’t far from the truth.

“Keep the hard-hat on at all times,” Hamza said. “Professor Naeem will take you from here.”

With that, Hamza slammed the manhole and was hoisted back up to the plateau leaving me standing on the top of the ladder processing how close I had just been to a severe injury. Eventually, voices from below brought me back to my senses and I made the four-meter descent down the caged wall.

For a site where “excavations had just begun” according to Naeem, a lot of earth had already been moved.  Two young men walked past me, carting rocks in a wheelbarrow and exited the mesh cage through a doorway just behind me where they dumped their load out on the existing pile of rubble. They were coming in and out from behind a large tarpaulin that had been draped from the top of the cage to seemingly conceal the actual excavation site at the very base of the embankment. Despite the tarp blocking my view, I could see a large cutting about three meters high by two meters deep which extended into the embankment.

My heart thudded in anticipation as I made my way to the draped tarp. I took a deep breath and ducked beneath the flap.

What I saw would forever be branded in my memory. It was something I had neither seen through my eyes or through research. I somehow knew it was the only one of its kind.

The cutting went about 2 meters into the embankment, where it stopped at a large 2 by 3-meter-high marble slab. Inscribed into this monolith was not just *one* hand, as Naeem had described to me on the phone, but hundreds! Even from my position I could see the Hebrew script filling each and every one. The hands were laid in a similar way that those eye charts you see in Doctor’s offices are. The top row contained only one hand, the next row two, the third three, and so on. With each subsequent row the hands became significantly smaller so that by the last row they were no larger than a newborn baby’s hand. Despite the tiny size the script was still written within. All up, I counted 36 rows of hands.

 It definitely sent a chill down my spine later, when I did the math and discovered there were in fact 666 hands engraved into that wall. Definitely an omen I should have considered.

I stood staring like a gaping fool for what felt like hours as my eyes soaked in this anomaly. Salome had spared no complacency in keeping this place safe from evil. Or from the evil contained within…

It took the woman until she was waving her hand in front of my face for me to notice her. Catching her gaze was an icy plunge out of my momentary shutdown and I instantly felt self-conscious of how stupid I must have looked. A set of wide brimmed glasses lined her sweet face and a mop of exquisite dark curls was carelessly tied in a pony tail. It was like meeting an Angel at the gates of hell.

“Mr Turner?” she asked.

“Yes. Yes, that’s me,” I stuttered. “Sorry I was just taken aback by all those hands,” I gestured towards the monolith.

“*Hamsa,* you mean,” she said in a teasing tone. “Being the great Herodian-era Historian working in a Roman museum, I thought that would be common knowledge for you?” Her lips twisted into a smirk.

“Sorry, what is your name?” I asked.

“Mia.”

We exchanged a few more pleasantries where I learned she was one of Professor Naeem’s students and beside him and myself, the only other Herodian expert present. She was so easy to talk to, and I could tell that the instant attraction I was feeling for her was returned. I probably could have stood there talking to her for the rest of the day - was even about to intensify the flirtation - until she reminded me where we were. My eyes fell back to the dreadful hand smeared wall, finally sobering me enough to get to the bottom of what I had been summoned here for.

She led me to the base of the wall, where one of the hands on the third row from the ground was being analysed by an older man. And so, it was where I met Professor Naeem Alami for the first time in person.

He had a receding hairline and wore a blue button up shirt, with the sleeves rolled up to his muscled forearms. My first impression of him was definitely not that of a timid fellow. But when I extended my hand to shake his, he flinched as though I was about to punch him. When he eventually grasped my hand, it was a rather pathetic grip and I got the immediate impression that he was probably someone who had been bullied - or maybe still was. The voice that spoke to me on the phone gave no hint of this.

 Very soon I would learn precisely why he was so jittery.

“I am pleased that you have arrived Mr Turner. I heard the bang from up there.” He pointed to the mesh roof above us where the soccer-ball stone was still sitting. “If only your Salome had chosen a more hostile location to bury her brother.”

“Indeed,” I replied. “Though I must say, I am looking forward to seeing what reasons she had to do so - *if* she did so.” I traced the outline of one of the many hands. “I assume it is all written on here?”

Naeem looked around as though he was making sure no one was close enough to eavesdrop. He gestured Mia to lean closer so that he could speak to us like co-conspirators. “The wall explains something that I know neither of us could ever have assumed.”

“So, you’ve already translated it?”

Naeem nodded. “Completed a week ago. It might look like each hand contains its own message but it’s actually one continuous account.” He pointed to the largest hand at the top, which I knew was the one that had initially been discovered. The one I had only been expecting to see. “It starts from that solitary one, the text being read from right to left as is normal for Hebrew. It continues down to the right most hand on the next row and goes on until it finishes at the left most hand on the 36th row. I’ve brought you here so that we could have your opinion on the text and Salome’s part in it.”

I scoffed. All of a sudden, I was not feeling kindly towards this man. “Why the hell did you lie to me then? You said that excavations were only just beginning, and that I would be here to assist with interpreting any finds throughout the dig. It looks like it has been almost a year of progress! If you need me to read your translation, you could have just emailed it to me.”

Naeem dropped his gaze and sighed. “I’m terribly sorry. Suffian was adamant you be misled. His paranoia for word of this find reaching Israel has made it hard for all of us. In his eyes, the less you knew of what stage we are at in this dig, the better. I *was* going to email you the translation, but he was adamant that Israel would somehow intercept it.”

I felt my ire begin to bubble. In that moment, if I had seen Suffian I would have punched him square in the face, regardless of what consequences that’d entail.

“I honestly care little about your political situation. Fuck, I just resigned from my job in Rome to come here, thinking it to be a long project. Where is this Suffian? I’d like to have a few words with him.”

All the colour drained from Naeem’s face and I saw that it took a great deal for him to regain his composure. Mia replied instead. “He’s away on political duties. But he expects you to have read and provided your analysis on the translation by the time he comes back, which will be in three to four days.”

I shook my head, incredulous. Here I was, resigned from a prestige job, led by a lie to this foreign country, and now subject to meeting some paranoid politician’s expectations. I just wanted to stick my finger up and leave this place, stopping along the way to tell some museum curators in Israel of this site, just for shits and giggles.

Mia must have sensed the rebellion burning within me, and quickly found a way to sober it. “Corey, Suffian is very dangerous. Just do what he has said and you won’t have any trouble.”

I impulsively ground my teeth. I had just thrown my life away to become a prisoner in some foreign political game, centred around an archaeological find. Despair gripped me.

A hand planted itself on my shoulder. It was Naeem’s. He looked at me through glassy eyes. “He had men stationed around my son’s house. Hamza’s men. I believe you have already met him?”

I nodded, not liking where this was going.

“Inside were my grandchildren and their mother. If I failed to call you…to lie to you… they would have been put down.” He stared at me intently as his Adam’s apple bobbed up and down. Mia placed an arm around his shoulder and it took all his strength to hold back the tears.

I knew he was not lying. Despite my ire, my heart went out to him.

As he recovered, Mia addressed me. “Your resignation is not in vain, Corey. If what the translation says has any truth to it, there may still be a lot for you to do here.”

“True or not true!” Naeem suddenly spat, catching me off guard. “A warning from some dead two-thousand-year-old princess will be as infective at altering Suffian’s course as a damned air raid. Nothing will stop him from going further and uncovering the tomb. You think our objection to go further, based solely on the words written within the *Hamsa* will do anything to sway him?”

I felt a jolt of unease at this unexpected display of anger. “You actually believe it is Herod’s tomb then?”

Naeem sighed. “At first, based off the initial solitary uncovered hand, no I did not. But Suffian was adamant that it was, hence why the whole dig began. But the deeper I got into the translation, the harder I found for it to not be of any merit. Too much effort has gone into it.  Yes, I do believe this is Herod’s tomb.”

Naeem paused, catching Mia’s eye, and a silent understanding passed between them. It lasted only a second, but in that moment, **their eyes were freshly cleaned windows into minds that were fermenting in fear.**

 Naeem continued in a voice that was little more than a whisper. “But as for the circumstances that led to this place becoming Herod’s tomb? Let me just say, I prefer you read the translation and decide for yourself. What is mentioned has definitely added another layer to the uneasiness that has driven this whole project. And, like Mia has said, I guarantee there’ll be more work for you to do here, after we have displayed our analysis to Suffian.

“Has Suffian read the translation yet?” I asked.

“No. He is under the impression that the translation is going through some difficulties, and that we will not have a polished version until you have had your say. Based off the content, Mia and I already have a decision we want to make and present to Suffian, but would like at least one other reputable researcher to back it up. I don’t think Suffian will be happy with it.”

“Do you believe there is any truth to the warning though?” I asked, feeling my guts twist.

“Yes.” Naeem replied simply. “Read it yourself, then come back to me to discuss it further. Ok?”

That evening I sat on the bed in my accommodation - a basic amenity demountable with surprisingly excellent air conditioning - and held the folder that Mia slipped into my hands after we had our evening meal in the mess tent. Inside were several sleeved A4 papers filled with text.

My fingers trembled. 

Heart slamming against my chest, and feeling the urge to shit my pants, I read it...
