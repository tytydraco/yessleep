“I’m going to Saturn,” Isaac said under his breath. 

I looked over towards his desk and jokingly said back, “You’re going there for summer break?” 

Isaac just stared downward scribbling something in his notebook, ignoring me, mumbling to himself. I sighed and moved back in my seat and stared at the clock. Only 10 minutes until we’re out of here and summer finally begins. 

Isaac and I weren’t exactly friends, but we got along all right during the school year. We worked on some projects in class and sat together at lunch every so often. We’ve been talking a lot less in the past few months, though. Recently he’s been a lot more reclusive, spending more time focused on his own personal projects and dashing away to eat lunch in class.

I clung to the edges of my desk, watching the minute hand slowly crawl to the next digit. You could feel the tension in the air as every kid in class readied their bags and propped themselves into half-standing positions, as if a starter pistol was going to fire any second.

The room filled with a near deafening alarm, only being drowned out by the sound of cheering and four dozen feet shuffling on the linoleum. Despite my excitement to rush out of the room to three months of freedom, I felt compelled to look back at my science classroom one more time. 

Isaac was seated, still in his desk, repeating a violent circling pattern in his notebook, with the pencil now worn-down ripping into the paper.
Mrs. Clairemont interrupted my confused staring, blocking the doorway in front of me, her face plastered with a smile.  

“Now why are you still hanging ‘round here? Get out there and enjoy summer.”

I stood there and felt as if I were being rushed out of the place. 

“Thanks, Mrs. Clairemont. I’m gonna miss you.” 

She waved her hand in an “aw shucks” kind of gesture and told me to “Make smart choices” and shooed me away with a playful attitude.
I smiled awkwardly and I thought about asking what Isaac was doing still in class, but felt my summer was much more important to me in that moment. 

I turned around to leave, and noticed that the door quickly shut behind me, with a piece of black paper covering the door’s small window.

…

“One more year, are you excited?” my mother asked, pointing her spoon in my direction.

“Yeah, I guess,” I replied, shoving mushy and slightly burnt potatoes into my mouth.

“I’m going to miss you so much.”

“Relax, mom. I’m not going to be going that far. I don’t even know if they’re going to accept me, yet. I still have a whole damn year of school left, too.”

She shot me an angered glance. 

She didn’t like me swearing, even with such a kiddy word like “damn”. That’s the type of thing a 7 year old says to impress his friends. 
I held my eyes shut to hide my rolling eyes and apologized, “I’m sorry.” It was a habit I picked up to avoid any other lectures about my attitude. 

She stared at me, looking towards the ceiling and then back at me as she crossed her arms.

I sighed, closing my eyes to roll them again, “I’m sorry, Lord. Please forgive me.” I know I said it in the most monotone voice I could muster. It didn’t seem to matter to my mother how I said it, as long as I did.

Peeling her arms away from her chest she held her necklace to her lips and kissed the cross. She moved up from her chair and picked up her plate of food and kissed me on the head. 

“Thank you for humoring me. I just care about you and want you to make smart choices”.

She then removed my plate from the table and took it to the kitchen along with hers.

I sat there, a moment of déjà vu smacking me in the face. 

“Strange, my science teacher told me the same thing when I left class.”

“Well, sounds like we both want you to live a successful life.” 

I chortled and looked at the ring mark that my plate left.

…

“Isaac was acting weird as fuck again in class” I messaged my friend Oliver online.

“Whoa, careful there. Watch your language. Your mom might make you say sorry to God again”

“lol shut the fuck up”

“lol. So what was Isaac doin?”

“He was just scribbling in his notebook again, and he was whispering to himself too”

“doesn’t he normally do that?”

“I mean he’s definitely been doing it more I guess”

“kid’s just a weirdo. Who cares?”

I thought for a moment. I remembered that Mrs. Clairemont was acting a little weird too.

“Yeah I guess… but Mrs. Clairemont like closed the door on me and kept him in the room”

“oooo isaac and Clairemont getting it oonnn”

“brooo lol stfu that’s disgusting”

“didn’t some teacher in Florida have some weird thing with her student too? Lucky kid”

“Dude she’s like 50. That’s so fucked up”

“lol I’m just kidding, come on man. Anyway I gotta go. Meeting up with Kate and Lindy tonight”

I thought about inviting myself with them. Being here alone with my mom on the first day of summer felt like I was being some social reject. I sent Oliver another message, but he was offline.

Fuck. Maybe I’ll just text him. No, I don’t want to seem desperate. I’ll wait awhile. Play it cool.

Maybe I can drive around, try to find them, make an excuse. “Oh man, you guys just happened to be here too? That’s crazy! We should hang out or something!” 

Yeah, that’s smart. Definitely not creepy or weird at all. Ugh. I rolled my phone in my hands a couple times, debating what to do. Fuck it, I’ll make my move and start summer off with something more interesting than being alone in my room playing games and jerking off.

I readied myself, barreled down the stairs and flung open the door, ready to announce my night drive to my mother, only to see Mrs. Clairemont standing at the door with her wide-eyed smile with some sort of casserole dish in her hands.

“Oh… hello Mrs. Clairemont.” I said dumbfoundedly. 

She stared towards me, but didn’t meet my eyes. It looked like she didn’t realize that the door opened in front of her. I was about to say something else until my mom came and interrupted my confusion. 

“Oh hello, Vicky! So nice to see you tonight” she said.

Mrs. Clairemont replied, like she was being activated out of a trance. Her eyes gleamed with life.

“Oh, Angela, I just wanted to thank you so much for your efforts with our graduation bake sale. You’ve helped tremendously these past few weeks.”

“That is no problem at all,” my mom fiddled with her cross, “I’m always willing to help out and do good for the kids.”

I stared awkwardly, being in the center of this middle-aged mother-blather encounter. My hand was propping the door open. I knew if I didn’t say something soon I’d be here all night, waiting to get a word in. 

I dashed to my car and yelled toward my mom that I was going out for the night. I knew when she starts talking, she doesn’t seem to notice or care what is happening around her. She waved a small hand towards my direction and mouthed “I love you”. 
As I backed my car out of the driveway, I noticed that the doorway was now empty. Looks like my mom invited Mrs. Clairemont inside.

…

Slowing down at the stop sign, I whipped my phone out and texted Oliver. Figure enough time passed to not seem desperate. I asked what he and the girls were doing. I felt like maybe if I played it cool I can “coincidentally” be in the same spot as them and we could merge our plans together. Brilliant idea. No issues at all. Flawless. No notes. 

I looked over to my right and noticed a handful of young girls playing in their yard. I looked at the time and it was 9:15pm. I rolled down the window, preparing to jokingly shout at the kids that it was too late to be playing Ring Around the Rosie at night, and then noticed that they were doing it without making a noise. No singing. No laughing. Nothing. 

“What the…”

A text interrupted my thoughts.

“Oh hey man, we’re just going to that haunted hand movie” Oliver texted me back.

My eyes lit up. 

“Oh no way! I was planning to go tonight too!” 

What a great idea. What better way to slip in socially than a movie. No real excuses, just a “Oh hey I was seeing that movie too. Let’s sit together!” It’s perfect. 

Oliver responded, “You got tickets already? This showing has been sold out all night!”

I stared at my phone. Shit. How was I going to get out of this?

The car behind me honked. Guess I was sitting at the stop sign for far too long and was holding up traffic. I readied to move forward, looking both to the left and right before I drove away. I noticed that the girls were gone. Suppose they went inside after all. 
Driving towards the theater, I readied my game plan. 

Okay, so, I don’t have the tickets to this. But maybe I can buy some tickets to some other movie online, scan them, and then sneak into their movie. I’ll lie, saying how convenient it is that my seat just so happens to be next to Oliver. I’ll joke and say it was fate or something.
I pulled into the theater lot. I noticed Oliver, Kate, and Lindy waiting at the front of the building and vaping. 
I tried to play it cool. Nonchalant. I didn’t want to show that I was some excited weirdo that was plotting to hang out with my friend with some half-baked excuse instead of just asking like a normal person.

“Hey dickhead” Oliver eyed at me, smiling.

“Hey asshole” I said back, trying to copy him.

Oliver mockingly bowed towards the two girls, extending an arm towards their direction. 

“M’ladies, this is my best friend, Nathan.”

They both giggled in a way that felt less than authentic. 

“I’m Lindy, and this is Kate”

“Nice to finally meet you,” Kate said, holding her hand out. 

I met her hand with mine, and I could feel just how clammy mine were. Hers, though, were so soft and small, and I felt myself shaking it a bit too hurriedly. 

I stammered a “Nice to meet you” as I met her pale blue eyes. Her brown curls fell down onto her shoulders, and I noticed a small freckle on her chin. I felt like I was in a trance, and it wasn’t until Oliver jokingly said that I was still shaking her hand that I snapped out of it.

“Oh shit, sorry!” I could feel my face turn into a hot red mess. 

Both girls let out a quick laugh and Oliver pulled out his arm and locked it with mine, leading me inside the theater, with the girls following and doing the same.

…

“Theater 4, to the left” The theater clerk directed. It wasn’t until my ticket that he scanned it, noticing that it was a much later showing for a very different movie. He was about to say an entirely different theater and direction, until I interrupted, loudly telling the others to go get snacks without me. 

The clerk looked up from the ticket and looked at me with a dumb, judgy look before telling me the theater number that I was supposed to go to. I shrugged it off and took my ticket for some foreign romance film and quickly discarded the piece of paper before meeting with the group.

I followed them into theater 4, finding their seats. Luckily there was an empty one right by them.

“It’s crazy that you managed to get a seat right next to ours.” Oliver said in amazement.

I laughed awkwardly, “I know. Lucky right?”

The girls took turns laughing with each other, saying something about fate and the stars.

I leaned forward, pretending to tie my shoe, trying to get a look at Kate again.

She and Lindy were locked in conversation, but I noticed Kate was smiling, and locked eyes with mine for a split second before I rushed quickly back into my seat, blushing.

A combination of anxiety and calm rushed into my bloodstream. I looked at Oliver and asked how he knew the girls. He was about to reply, but then a man’s voice interrupted instead. 

“Hey kid, you’re in my seat.”

I turned hot, and I could already feel the sweat pooling under my pits. 

Shit. I didn’t think this far into my plan. 

I turned around, eyeing an overweight, tall man wearing some black band t-shirt, holding a giant tub of popcorn and a soda in a container that resembled more of a bucket than a cup.

I stammered, trying to come up with some excuse to fix the situation. I turned around and looked at Oliver and the girls, foolishly expecting them to say something defending me. They just stared in confusion. I looked back at the giant standing beside me.
“Well?” he responded.

I felt like I was being crushed from all sides, unsure of what to do. Then I pulled out a classic that would fix this situation.

“I gotta piss.” 

…

I hurried to the bathroom to make my next plan.

“I’m such an idiot,” I spoke quietly to myself out loud, “I didn’t think about any of this assigned seating stuff. I can’t go back. But I can’t leave either. If I leave, then I’m just going to look like a cowardly jackass. But if I go back, they’ll know I lied about having a movie ticket.”

I sat in the stall, mumbling to myself like an insane person about my social idiocy. This felt truly more horrific than any horror movie I was going to see. I prepared to return to the theater. I figured I could manage to find some empty spot, and just lie, saying I picked the wrong seat. I opened the door of the stall, only to see what looked like a staff member cleaning the bathroom mirror. He was making a circular motion on the glass. 

“Be sure to make smart choices,” the worker spoke. 

“Sorry?” I questioned. 

He didn’t turn to look at me. He just repeatedly wiped the glass in that circular motion. The entire time. Unblinking. 
I looked down at my hands in the sink, “Oh,” I laughed, “Yeah, I be sure to wash my hands after. Definitely something I do a lot more since COVID.”

I assumed that’s what he was talking about. Him being some health-conscious nut. 

He didn’t say anything else to me. He just circled the washcloth around and around on the mirror. I could make out that he was still speaking, albeit quietly. I could vaguely make out the words. Something about “return”? Maybe “Saturn”?

I rushed out of the bathroom without drying my hands. 

Fuckin’ weird guy. 

…

I held my breath walking through the darkness, only the small lights on the floor illuminating my path. I stared up at the dozens of seats and dozens of people filled each one. I found the spot where Oliver and the girls were sitting. Oliver had an annoyed expression on his face. That greasy guy next to him clearly wasn’t what he was looking forward to. I could tell he was trying to argue with him while I was gone. He wrongly assumed he had taken my spot. 

Oliver looked down and spotted me, shrugging in annoyance. I waved awkwardly back at him and tried my best sign language improv to tell him that I was going to try and sit elsewhere. 

I scanned the darkened room, loud trailers airing behind me, where I noticed a lone empty seat in the far front corner of the theater, right underneath the screen. Sure, I was going to have to crane my head every direction just to make out what was going on in the movie, but at least I can say I saw the movie with my friends… sort of.

I made my way to the front of the theater, trying to avoid any more eye contact with Oliver, Lindy... or Kate. God, how embarrassing. 
I was practically staring at the ceiling here, but at least I found an empty seat. Here’s hoping someone else doesn’t come and tell me I took up their spot, too.

…

The woman next to me was fiddling with something. It was this crunching, splintering noise on the wooden armrest between us that I’ve noticed since the beginning of the movie. I tried to ignore it, but after an hour, it was really getting to me.

I looked over to ask her to be a little quieter. My words didn’t seem to connect, though. I looked over and saw her heaving and gasping, as if she was struggling to breathe. I glanced downwards at her hands and saw she was aggressively fidgeting with the armrest, circling her index finger onto the wood. It wasn’t a slow circling. Her finger was aggressively digging into the wood, splintering and cracking the armrest, sending small wooden bits around. The upper digit of her finger was missing, where a bloody bone took its place, turning into a point from the violent repetitive tracing. 

I shot up from my spot and yelled for someone to call 911. I looked at the woman gasping in her spot. She moved her gaze from the screen and stared right at me, and for what seemed like a moment, her irises appeared to look like empty, golden rings. 

...

That's it for now, I have to gather my thoughts on everything happening right now. I'll keep you guys up to date soon. I promise.

Remember, make smart choices.
