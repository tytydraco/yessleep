I want to start this off my saying I am horrified. My friend Karla has been living with me for a few years now. We decided to rent an apartment together, since it would be cheaper than trying to live on our own. 

Karla is a very outdoorsy person, she loves nature, herbs, flowers, and animals, she’s basically the biggest hippie you could ever know. I love her for it, we get along great because I too love all of those things, just on a much calmer level. Karla often takes long camping trips, sleeping in the woods for weeks with no socials or contact. I could never spend that much time outdoors, I love being outside but I couldn’t handle the sweat, bug bites and lack of social interaction. 

A couple of months ago, she took on a particularly grueling camping trip in the mountains. She would be back packing through the woods, carrying around her tent, food, water and supplies. I was a little worried for her, but I knew if anyone could do it, it would be her. Karla set off on her trip, we had hugged and talked before she left and I wished her well. I knew I wouldn’t be hearing from her, since she would always turn her phone off when she got to the forest. She was planning to be gone for three weeks, which was the longest she had been gone for. The apartment was incredibly lonely in her absence. 

After the first week, my phone pinged and a message from her lit up my screen. I was a bit shocked because like I said before, she never used her phone on her trips. It was a picture of a waterfall in the forest, it was beautiful, it led down into a stream surrounded by flowers and beautiful elm trees. There was a giant willow tree in the foreground beyond the stream. The picture came with a message that read “thinking of you :)” I hearted the picture and replied “Im surprised you turned on your phone, but that is beautiful” she simply hearted my reply, and we went back to radio silence. 

A few days passed and I got another message from her. It was another picture, this time of a ruined cottage, it was falling down, the roof almost completely collapsed into the house, trees and plants wrapped around it, and butterflies flew past the screen, landing on flowers that were darted out across the long grass. This time the only text was a simple heart emoji. I hearted the picture and sent back “how is the trip going?”. My message was seen but she never replied. 

I didn’t think much of it, I figured her phone had probably died. Over a week out in the forest, with no charger I wondered how its battery would have lasted this long. I was making myself some ramen noodles, when I heard the front door unlock. I jumped back startled, as Karla walked into the room. She set down her things, she was covered in dirt, sweat and honestly looked like shit. “Holy shit K are you ok?!” I said, truly concerned. She looked up at me and her eyes felt lifeless. “Everything’s good Sasha, just really need to shower!”. I thought it was strange, she wasn’t supposed to be home for days, and she never called me by my full name, she has been calling me Sash since we first met. 

Karla took her things to her room and spent a few hours in the bathroom. She came out in fresh clothes and looked a lot better, but she had fresh scratches across her arms, scabs on her face and her eyes looked haunted. Like she has seen something that had scarred her. “Is everything ok? You don’t seem alright” I pried. “Im fine Sasha, Its just been a shitty week ok!” She said it in a harsh tone, a tone id never known she had. I backed off. 

I went to bed early that night, hoping tomorrow she would be ready to talk about what happened. Karla didn’t sleep that night, I heard rustling around in the kitchen, since my bedroom had been a wall behind it. I thought it was weird but I fell back to sleep anyway. The next morning I was watching tv on the couch when Karla stepped out of her room. “CAN YOU TURN THAT SHIT DOWN!” She yelled and slammed her door. I was startled and fumbled for the remote. “I-Im sorry I didn’t know it was so loud!” I turned the tv down. It wasn’t that loud though, I never listened to the tv loud as it would bother me. The tension was high and I didn’t understand what was happening. 

I was scrolling tiktok on my phone, trying to drown out my thoughts when a text appeared. It was from Karla, another picture, this time it was a cave opening. Flowers and vines coated the stone around the cave, and a little bird was perched on a small plant in the view of the camera. The message read “my trip has been going really well! tomorrow I am going to be hiking up the mountain” I was incredibly confused, and my heart started to beat a little faster. 

I didn’t reply, I didn’t understand what kind of mind games she was playing, but I was pissed. She came out of her room and sat down at the kitchen counter, she was reading a book, I had never seen before, it was in a language I couldn’t make out. I shut off the tv and went back into my room. I didn’t say a word to her and she didn’t say anything to me. I took to scrolling facebook, looking at pointless memes, AI images and the occasional town news article. I had been scrolling for a few minutes when an article appeared with the cover image of Karla! It was a picture I had taken of her, and the caption of the article read “Body Of Mutilated Hiker Identified” 

I was astounded, my heart raced and  my hands became clammy, the article was real! It was posted that day from our local police station. It had hundreds of comments, mourning the loss of my very alive friend. I kept reading. “The body discovered on June 3rd has been identified as Karla Rae Rhodes, a 23 year old resident of elmwood. The cause of death has been determined to have been an animal attack, it is believed that Karla had been mauled by a mountain lion in the night. Family has been informed and funeral services will be announced as soon as possible” 

I dropped my phone. June 3rd was only three days after she had left. She had sent me the first text message, a week into her trip, on the 7th day of June. I read through our texts, the dates, the times. My heart raced, and my thoughts consumed my mind. How is this possible, who is in my apartment. Who has been texting me?! What the hell happened to Karla?! I am devastated, horrified! I immediately texted Karlas mom, who confirmed the article, and apologized for not calling me sooner. 

As I sit here writing this, whatever is pretending to be my dead friend, is sitting in my kitchen, eating our food, reading a book In a language I have never seen, with intentions I can’t begin to understand. My phone buzzed, and another photo from Karla, this time it was a selfie of her, in the woods, a big smile across her face, no scars, no scabs. She looked perfectly fine, and the message read “do you miss me?”
