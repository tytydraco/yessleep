I always thought being abandoned by my parents was the worst thing that could happen to a child. You see, children born without a gift are sent to "the Zone," a place where they eventually meet their end. There, cities are skeletons, and people are mere shadows of what they once were. The few of us who survived quickly learned never to trust anyone.

I was fourteen when I discovered my power. It all started with a small black hole, the size of a marble, that appeared before me in a moment of desperation. I had stolen food from a group of raiders who chased me like ravenous wolves. There was no escape. That’s when I felt it: a strange vibration in the air, like a hum that settled in my head. In the blink of an eye, I was somewhere else.

The world I arrived in wasn’t better than mine, but it was different. And that was enough.

For years, I jumped from universe to universe. Each had its own rules and logic. In one, people lived in floating cities suspended among clouds; in another, the sky burned like an eternal canvas of fire, while coal rained down. Some worlds were peaceful; others, lethal. I learned to adapt, to survive, and even made a few friends along the way. Over time, I discovered I could guide the portals to places closer to what I imagined.

I didn’t realize the cost until much later.

One day, I arrived in a place I thought I had invented: Earth. This world wasn’t like the others. It had chaos and beauty, but also something inexplicable: humanity. And there, I met Sofía.

We crossed paths in a run-down café. I was the stranger who didn’t know how to use coins; she was the girl who smiled and paid for my coffee. It seemed like a small gesture, but for someone like me—accustomed to disdain and distrust—it was like a spark in the dark.

With Sofía, I learned what it meant to truly live. She introduced me to music, something I had never experienced in the worlds I visited. We danced in the rain, laughed at my clumsiness, and I cried without shame. For the first time, I stopped jumping from one universe to another. I stayed.

She was everything I didn’t know I needed: laughter amid chaos, patience for my emotional clumsiness, and a quiet strength that made the world seem less bleak. She listened to me. She understood me. And because of her, I stopped running.

Sofía also encouraged me to confront my past. One night, after weeks of conversations, I decided to return to my home universe to search for answers and perhaps find closure. With more precision than ever, I tried to open the portal, but I couldn’t. I tried every universe I could think of, yet it was as if they had never existed.

My home, my parents, the friends I met on my adventures... everything had disappeared. Was it my fault?

I couldn’t bring myself to tell Sofía. Instead of seeking comfort in her, I shut myself off. My bitterness grew like a cancer, slowly driving her away. I remember the day she looked at me for the last time, tears in her eyes, searching for an explanation. But I just stared back coldly. Without a word, I let her leave.

She tried to help me, but in the end, my darkness consumed her too.

Now I’m alone. I have nothing left to stay for. Perhaps I could start over somewhere else, but would this place also vanish?

The question that haunts me is simple: will I risk this universe for one last leap, or accept that my punishment is to stay here, in the one place that was never truly mine?
