I always thought that being abandoned by my parents was the worst thing that could happen to a child. You see, children born without a gift are sent to "the Zone," a place where they eventually meet their end. In that wasteland, cities are skeletons, and people are mere shadows of what they once were. Those of us who managed to survive quickly learned never to trust anyone.

I was fourteen when I discovered my power. It all began with a tiny black hole, the size of a marble, that appeared before me in a moment of despair. I had stolen food from a group of raiders who were chasing me like ravenous wolves. There was no way out. Then, I felt it—a strange vibration in the air, like a hum deep inside my head. In the blink of an eye, I was somewhere else.

The world I arrived in wasn’t better than my own. But it was different. And that was enough.

For years, I jumped from universe to universe. Each one had its own rules, its own logic. In one, people lived in floating cities suspended among clouds. In another, the sky burned like an eternal canvas of fire while it rained coal. Some worlds were peaceful; others, deadly. I learned to adapt, to survive, and even made a few friends along the way. Over time, I discovered how to guide the portals toward places closer to what I imagined.

I didn’t realize the cost until much later.

One day, I arrived in a place I thought I had imagined: Earth. This world wasn’t like the others. It had chaos and beauty, but also something inexplicable: humanity. And there, I met Sofía.

We crossed paths in a run-down café. I was the stranger who didn’t know how to use coins; she was the girl who smiled and paid for my coffee. It was a gesture that seemed insignificant, but to someone like me—used to disdain and distrust—it was like a spark in the dark.

With Sofía, I learned what it meant to truly live. She introduced me to music, something I had never experienced in the worlds I visited. We danced in unexpected rain, laughed at my clumsiness, and I cried without shame. For the first time, I stopped jumping from universe to universe. I stayed.

She was everything I didn’t know I needed: laughter amid chaos, patience for my emotional clumsiness, and a quiet strength that made the world seem less bleak. She listened to me. She understood me. And because of her, I stopped running.

Sofía also encouraged me to confront my past. One night, after weeks of conversations, I decided to return to my home universe to seek answers and perhaps find closure. With more precision than ever, I opened the portal.

What I found was devastating.

My home, my parents, the friends I had made on my journeys... everything had been consumed by the black holes I had created. Every leap that saved me had condemned an entire universe.

The guilt was unbearable. I couldn’t bring myself to tell Sofía. Instead, I shut myself off. My bitterness grew like a cancer, pushing her further and further away. I still remember the day she looked at me for the last time, tears in her eyes, searching for an explanation. But I only stared back coldly. Without a word, I let her leave.

She had tried to help me, but in the end, my darkness consumed her too.

Now I am alone. I have nothing left to stay for. Maybe I could start over somewhere else, but how could I justify destroying another world?

The question that haunts me is simple: will I risk this universe for one last leap, or will I accept that my punishment is to remain here, in the one place that was never truly mine?
