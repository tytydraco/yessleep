This happened in 2024, roughly November. It lasted for a long few weeks.

It started when I went to sleep one night, on a Monday.

A dream. A nightmare, even.

It was strange and warped, and I don't remember it well, but it was me on the sidewalk outside of my grandparents house. I was in a third person view, but it wasn't me I was looking at—a twisted version of me with white skin and black and red marks, my face blurry and unrecognizable. My view slowly advanced toward my face, but it didn't become clear or visible. Just blurry. Not me.

I thought nothing of it the next morning; I've always had weird, prophetic dreams and whatnot.

But things got worse. I kept seeing your average stereotypical old man in my dreams—grey hair, hunched back, black cane, dark blue jeans and a flannel shirt. He didn't say anything, just stared or was in the background of my dreams. The same exact man.

Then I kept seeing triangles in my dreams. Everywhere. On a tree, someone's clothes, I mean everywhere.

And then I saw them in real life. Outside my dreams.

Stars aligned in a crooked but unmistakable triangle.

Roots jutting out of the ground in the formation of a triangle.

In the faint patterns of scratches on my walls; a triangle.

Everywhere I looked—Triangle. Triangle. Triangle.

I was sick of that word. Absolutely sick of it. Dream after dream, thought after thought, those wretched connected three lines haunted me. Sometimes, they even had a line in the middle of it, like a closed eye. In my dreams, the eye would slowly open but never enough so I could see beyond the lid.

I searched up what it meant. "The Holy Trinity." It was a triangle, yes, meant to be a sign from God.

But this? This felt sinister. Evil. Devious. If it was from God, I wouldn't have dread after my dreams and sightings of triangles everywhere, and it most likely wouldn't be  associated with a dark, dark red. Red enough to be red, but dark enough to be mistaken as black.

I'd be in a forest of pine trees in my dreams, peaceful as the birds chirped ahead and the rays of the sun danced cheerfully.

But then the chirping would come to an abrupt stop.

All sound, cut off. Later on, with eerie silence, it was replaced by an unbearably loud blaring, like a cruise ship. It wailed forever and ever, then clouds of a sinister dark red would roll in, blotting out the sun and blue sky, instead a black carpet of nothingness. Slowly but surely, outlined in a fiery orange, clean lines would slice across the sky, connecting... Aligning...

Topped off with a bridged line in the center of the lines.

A triangle.

The line in the center, presumably an eye, would open and spread and inside I could see unfathomable horrors. I shudder at the thought. A massive black shape (which I saw flickers of in the corner of my eye outside my dreams) charging through the forest near my house, my town, crushing anything in its path, swallowing it and replacing everything I knew and loved and cared for into a undesirable void of nothing. Pandemonium broke out. The river I swam in, the bridge above it, the same dark water my dad caught a fish for the first time in years in, trees I saw everyday, houses I saw everyday, small little shops I visited and liked, the infamous ice cream shop—renovated into a void of nothing. Unlovable. Undesirable. Unremarkable. The black void flooded the planet I knew and loved and hoped to save from pollution one day. Every opportunity ripped away and every chance at feeling or seeing anything but a void black rippled away.

All hell broke out.

As the void spilled across vast fields, scaled mountains and cast a dark blanket over the oceans and rivers and everything,

All while the three-cornered shape loomed, watching me with its singular eye, filled with all negative things that could happen to me and everyone. All negative things that would happen. Had happened.

Ever since that one dream, I stopped seeing everything like that. Yes, I saw triangles, but not everywhere I looked anymore and no more dreams of them, no more dread, I was completely fine. Left with the confusion on what that dream meant and why I had it in the first place. Now, I get this odd lingering feeling of impending doom whenever I see a triangle. Not unbearable, but an anxious "I have to leave" feeling.
