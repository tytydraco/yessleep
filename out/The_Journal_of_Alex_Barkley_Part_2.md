I woke up at 8am with a box being thrown at my face by my mom who was already clearly drunk. I looked inside the cardboard box wrapped in brown paper like those old wrapped packages from movies. Inside was a note written on what looks like parchment paper I don’t recognize the language it’s written in it doesn’t look like any language. Even though I’ve never seen it before I can read it . It says, “Payment for you freeing me, speak your will to the box and it will be done”. I’m going to ask it for an explanation. 

[The following was written in the previously described language]

Alex opens his eyes in a large black void only a stone slab below him. Before him stands a large statue. The statue stand at 11 feet tall with a 3 foot base made of polished granite with the inscription [the following line was scratched out] on a bronze plaque in the statue’s base the statue itself stood 8 feet tall towering over Alex. It was a long and slender being, a being with a large potbelly off setting its slender figure. Its legs were crouched not revealing its true height though if they were extended the statue would be 3 feet taller. The arms of the statue were long, too long for its body being able to grab the top of the base which was 6 feet below the shoulders of the statue. The neck of the statue was 2 feet long and was fully extended with a slight curve to look down at Alex its head was obstructed by the large six pointed star mask it wore only its red eyes visible. 

It spoke in a deep horse voice so deep Alex could feel the voice in his bones. “You wish for me to explain my gift?” It didn’t wait for an reply “This is the box containing the amulet of cupiditas simply speak your will to the stone and it will be done I give you a word of caution nothing is free the amulet will require a price be paid you will know what that price is once it takes it from you. This box was the price paid for my freedom to you. If you wish to forgo my boon simply speak my name and it we will speak again” the statue was then pulled into the darkness the last thing echoing in Alex’s mind before he awoke was “Numquam aliquid assequi potes nisi aliquid simile sacrificas.”

I just woke up my pen was on my opened journal with the same writing as before I’m just going to go about the rest of my day and process this I will write more tommorow.

I woke up to day and the box was gone instead there was a small amulet looking thing. It looked like a six pointed star with a red gem in the middle I read over what was written in my journal from yesterday I don't know what I should do I'm going to think about this see if I can understand what is going on.

I thought it over and I am going to try something it said to speak my will and I think that means a wish. What should I wish for though? What would be a good way to test this? 

Ok so I ended up wishing for $1,000 I just figured it would be the best way to test this I'm not sure what else I could have asked to test this. I'm waiting to see what will happen I don't know what price it will be for this.

I have arrived at a nearby motel until it is safe for me to go back home. I had seen the front door of my apartment on my run out there was a symbol carved in my door I think the knocking was to cover up the carving. I wasn’t able to catch the symbol I’ll write what it was when I get back to my apartment. I’m gonna get some rest I think I’m seeing things I thought I saw eyes staring at me through my window.
