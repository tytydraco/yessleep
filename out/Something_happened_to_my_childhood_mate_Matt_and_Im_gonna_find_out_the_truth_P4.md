Part 4: The rest of that memory was shattered and faint. I got back to school without being pursued and managed to enter the school without being seen. I was late to class yet again! When I entered the classroom, there was an eerie, quiet quality to the air. All eyes were on me, quizzical, questioning, and confused looks. Oh, but Mrs.Jess? Mrs.Jess had an evil smile,  and she looked at me with menacing eyes.

“Go to the principal's office…” That was all she said, 5 words, but I could hear the evil and glee in her voice. I was a bit confused, then a bit scared. When I got to the principal’s office, the principal, an elderly man named Mr.Martin, was looking at me with a disappointed expression. 

“Mrs.Jess has informed me that… You have been sneaking out of school. I checked the cameras to see if this was true. I couldn’t believe you would have done such a thing, I could hardly believe my eyes! You were always one of the more mature students among your grade… For that reason… You’ve been suspended from school…”

When I went back to class to get my things, Jacob looked at me with a ‘I told you so’ look. I didn’t dare look at Keria, I don’t think  I could’ve comprehend my crush’s disappointed, disapproving eyes. My dad picked me up early. My dad wasn’t mad, not mad at all, in fact, he was cheerful and happy. Maybe because he liked my company, I was always at school  and my dad was alone with booze as company.

So that’s all I remember, I decided that I’m gonna ask Jacob if he could access some police reports of that day when Matt disappeared to try and find out more. I wanted to go meet him in person though. I didn’t like the distant, eerie quality of the previous call with him, it made me uneasy in a way I couldn’t explain.

The next day, I texted him, asking if he could access the police reports of the incident and where we should meet. He quickly responded back with a ‘Hold up, mate. I’m coming over to your place, I need to tell you some… ‘unfortunate’ news…’ Well that was vague and cryptic, but nevertheless, I waited for him to arrive.

When a rapping sounded on my door, I strode over to it and opened it. Jacob was standing there. His eyes seemed hollow and empty, and I could see dirt streaked on his cheeks. He was still in his officer uniform and he was carrying a plastic bag laden with what seemed like a very expensive bottle of scotch whiskey. 

“Hey, er, what’s up? Is something wrong?” I asked him, confused. He didn’t meet my eyes.

“Can I come in?” He asked, ignoring my question. I nodded and he strode in. He stopped at the dinner table and set the bag down, pulling the bottle out of the bag and setting it on the table with a thud.

“Hey, mate, what’s happening?” I asked, a bit firmer this time as I closed the door. Jacob brandished 2 glasses out of the cabinets, ignoring me, which pissed me off. He lay them gently on the table and looked up at me with a sad smile.

“You got scutskill in your eye.” I say, trying to break the tension. In case you Americans or whatever don’t understand the Aussie slang, scutskill is what you guys call eye boogers or something. He popped open the bottle of booze and quickly poured it into both glasses, spilling a little as he did so.

Jacob then took a seat and motioned for me to do the same. Once we were both seated, I tried to say something else in an attempt to break the tension hanging in the air. 

“You know I’ve been dry for 4 days now right?” I said as Jacob slid a glass full of scotch my way. Jacob didn’t laugh, instead he spoke with a cracked voice.

“I’m sorry to have to be the one to tell you this…-” He took a deep breath and looked hard into my eyes-” Your dad died in a car accident…” My ears were ringing, and the world seemed to shift and blur before my eyes. Thoughts of my dad played in my head, I recalled good memories we’d share together. Tears welled up. What a way to go, a damn car crash! He’d always tell me that he wanted to go peacefully in his sleep, dying at an old age.

“H-how’d it- how did it happen?” I asked, stuttering and stammering as tears dripped down my cheeks. Jacob looked uncomfortable and took a sip of his drink. 

“I don’t think I should tell you…” I grabbed my glass and gulped all the booze down in one go. 

“Please-” I ask, defeated-”Please tell me how it h-happened.” Jacob pulled a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket, and swiftly took one out, quickly igniting the end with a lighter before jamming it in his mouth. He took puffs of the cigarettes, the wisps of gray smoke shrouding his face. He finishes his cigarette before he speaks again.

“We found his body along with broken pieces of a car on the side of the road. We haven’t found his car yet. However, we have evidence that the car was flung deeper into the woods, proven by the scratches on a few tree bases which could have only been made by a car.

His body was covered in scratches and teeth marks… It’s the strangest thing…” Jacob trailed off, he didn’t need to finish what he was going to say. Scratches and teeth marks? Then it couldn’t be a car crash, perhaps some animal got in the car and attacked dad, causing him to crash? No, no, I think… I think the edge got him…

The funeral was 2 weeks later…I barely remember what happened, everyone’s speech was garbled and distorted, and time seemed to be going by too quickly! The events of the funeral were a complete blur. I was in a state of despair. I did nothing all day, work let me get a few days off, and my wife isn’t home most of the time. I just sleep, eat, sleep, eat and so on. We had an argument today, me and my wife. When she came back from her work,  she said that we needed to talk.

“Listen, honey. I know what happened to you takes a toll on someone, Matt’s disappearance, the edge, and what happened to your father, it’s horrible, but you’ve been grieving too long. You’re doing nothing! You’re just lazing about all day, you don’t want to spend time with me at all!

I didn’t marry you just to be ignored! Listen, this business with the edge now, it’s just become an obsession now! Please, please, stop this, please honey.” She stammered out quickly, the volume of her speech rising steadily as she spoke. 

“How dare you.” I said, softly and dangerously. How dare she! She doesn’t know anything I’ve been through at all! The edge has taken over my life! The edge is my life now! How dare she claim that it’s an obsession! She doesn’t know what it’s like to go through that!

She doesn’t know what it’s like losing a father to the god forsaken edge! I got up quickly and angrily, and stormed into the bedroom, Diana didn’t follow. I packed my gym clothes into a backpack quickly and stormed back out of the room, car keys clinking in my hands. 

“Hey, I’m sorry, okay, where are you going?” She asks me, trying to hold my hand but I brush it off.

“The gym.” Her eyes widened in shock as I said that.

“Hey, hey, I’m really sorry, I should have known better, please don’t go.” She stammers out but I’m already out the door. Fuck Diana.

I hop into the car and pull out of the drive quickly, in no time, I’m on the main road. As I approach an intersection, a thought flashes through my mind. The gym is left, and the school, the same school where Matt disappeared, the one where I snuck out, is to my right… Which way should I turn?

“Fuck it!” I say to myself, turning right…
