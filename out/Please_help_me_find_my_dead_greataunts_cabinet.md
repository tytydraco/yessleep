Hello everyone, it’s with great urgency that I ask you all to help me find a piece of furniture that was apparently misplaced or mishandled during the disposition of my great aunt’s estate. I know this forum is dedicated to the strange and horrible, so I hope you’ll take my words to heart. This particular item is quite old, likely over 100 years old at this point, but it would still appear to be in good shape after years of careful maintenance and cleaning. It is not a family heirloom; in fact, it comes as a bit of a burden to my family.

The item itself is a narrow chest of drawers about waist high. It is made of a dark oak wood which has been carefully sanded, finished and polished many times over the years. There is a distinct discoloration down the front, reaching across the drawers and cabinet which ranges from dark brown to dark burgundy in color. The drawers do not open easily and it has not been opened in many years. Should you find it, you may hear items rustling and shifting around inside but I must demand that whatever you do, *do not attempt to open it or look inside*. It seems to have been built specifically to conceal something, and I think it’s best that we all respect that.

Before I recount what I know of its history, I want to stress: this was never intended to be sold or given away. My great aunt’s will specifically stated that it should remain with my family until a suitable caretaker could be found. This is not a decorative piece or a place to store your least favorite sweater. It is somehow tied to events in the past that are horrific in ways even I am not totally privy to. Treat it with the respect you would afford the worst tragedies of your own life and return it to my family with whom it was entrusted long ago.

A little background first. My great aunt was a vivacious woman, often the cleverest and most outspoken person in the room wherever she went. I always remember visiting her as a child and loving the way she carried herself and invited attention from everyone around her. She was keenly aware of your inner thoughts which could occasionally be quite eerie—having her intense gaze on you felt like being under a microscope and she would often surprise me by pointing out thoughts which I had believed I was carefully hiding. She was never cruel, however, and these moments were probably the moments in which I felt most seen.

When I graduated college and got into a prestigious graduate program in California, I planned my route from Chicago where I lived with my parents specifically to stop at my great aunt’s house in Iowa. Though my grandparents had long ago moved to the city where my mother eventually grew up, my great aunt had stayed firmly in place, claiming she had been far enough in her lifetime. As a result, I only saw her on family vacations when we would cross through, and she had always been the most gracious host so I figured she would be accommodating if I surprised her on the way out to begin my life as a researcher. To my delight, she was.

She lived in a small cottage she had sublet from a rural farmer nearly 40 years earlier. In front of the house was a gorgeous garden that was as vibrant and unusual as she was. She apparently had made a living for so many years caring for the yards and gardens of the town’s elite, and as she got older, they had gone out of their way to take care of her. When I pulled up, she was sitting on the porch reading a book with a large cover and binding so heavy as to apparently require significant effort simply to hold. She didn’t even look up until I got out of my car and the way she leapt to her feet and flashed a look of deep concern had me on my heels before she cracked her trademark smile and ran to give me a hug.

My great aunt had a tall, stunning figure for a woman her age and when she hugged me it was like her arms wrapped around me multiple times and tangled me in a web of joy. Before we had even gotten my bags in the door I was exhausted from her questions ranging from my studies, to my love life, to my parents, and my plans for the future. We sat for hours chatting outside on the porch talking about our lives, my parents, my sister and my upcoming plans. When it got too chilly to stay outside, we retired to the kitchen, where she lit the wood burning stove and gave me a glass of moonshine she’d gotten in a trade with one of the local farmers. As we sat and drank, I noticed it.

The chest of drawers had always sat in the same place in her house, as long as I could remember. It was out of place in the area between the kitchen in the living room that wasn’t quite a hallway, but wasn’t quite a room of its own. On visits growing up the children had always been curious about it, often trying to sneak up and yank open the drawers that seemed to be locked shut—though there were no apparent key holes. Even when we thought we were being tricky, though, my great aunt always somehow caught us as if she had a sixth sense around it. It wasn’t that she’d ever get mean—I’d never seen her shout or raise her voice in all the years I was around her—it was the change in her voice and demeanor that suggested she would not tolerate our foolishness in this one thing alone. Even my parents avoided it, having apparently experienced the same thing at some point and not wanting to poke at something that could so drastically affect her.

Truthfully, there was something haunting about it. My memories are faded now, but I could swear as a kid I felt it calling to me. It looked bigger…which, of course, I was much smaller at the time, but it also seemed unearthly in a way I can’t describe as an adult. If you’ve ever been down into a basement or cellar as a child and got the weird sensation that the space could contain anything; whether something amazing or horrible, then you may have a sense for it. Maybe that’s why we persisted in trying to open it no matter how many times my great aunt scolded us.

And then there were the dreams. Every time I returned home after visiting my great aunt, I had truly horrible dreams. I was in a dark place with a concrete floor. I couldn’t see any walls or ceiling, just darkness in every direction. I walked in one direction thinking I’d find my way out, but no matter how far I went, I couldn’t see anything. That’s when I noticed the lights. Five red dots way off in the distance. Like fireflies shifting and rotating around as they moved in my direction. I stopped, staring into the darkness, trying to make sense of anything. As they approached, they seemed to get bigger and bigger until they were close enough that I could see they were what appeared to be eyes on an enormous…something.

I would say it was a creature based on the way it writhed and crawled forward, but it didn’t have anything resembling the body of something I’d seen before. The eyes squirmed around in a massive gash along its front that appeared to consist of deep, thick blood and rotting flesh. The body around it seemed to consist of a thick mass of dark brown thorny vines. The movement of the mass of vines was unnatural, moving slow and quick at uneven intervals, where stationary parts seemed to attach to moving parts without being drawn by them. By this time I had fallen to the ground and I tried desperately to scream, but I couldn’t draw breath. As the eyes drew within only a few feet of me I could clearly see the face of a child screaming from within the eerie red light.They seemed focused on me. They seemed to beg me to reach out. And I did.

Every time I woke from the dream I felt like I was suffocating. My limbs were stiff and I thrashed around in my bed trying to get to my feet before I realized where I was. My heart was beating so hard I could feel my blood pulsing through my veins. When I finally relaxed, I cried. I felt alone. And I couldn’t bear to call for help. I would spend the rest of the night awake, staring into every dark corner, worried about what might be there. Even though I haven’t had these dreams in years, I still remember that feeling. It was the most awful despair I’d ever felt.

So, I sat there, already a little drunk on some truly harsh moonshine, and I gathered up the courage to ask.

“That there, it came with me from Ireland.” She turned serious, her eyes hardening as she seemed to brace herself to tell the story. “Or maybe I came with it. I can barely tell.”

She noticed my look of concern. “It’s not a curse really. More of a burden. The cost of time.”

My grandmother had moved from Ireland in the early 1970’s with her husband, a physician she met while he was visiting with a friend. She and her sister grew up destitute after the death of their parents in the late 1960s and they had had to rely on a collection of family friends and neighbors to get through their teenage years. By the time my grandmother left, my great aunt had a stable life with a long-term boyfriend and a nice flat in the town where she’d grown up. Unfortunately, that changed rapidly after my grandmother moved to rural Iowa where my grandfather originally set up his practice.

“I was ignorant to how things were changing; that is, until he died.”

Her boyfriend was murdered. She never would tell me how or why and I was afraid to ask. But it’s not hard to make the connection between that and the fact that she immediately fell on hard times.

“One day I was at work, and the police showed up. Within the hour I was out on the street with my last paycheck. That check didn’t last long, and soon enough I was out on the street with nothing at all.”

She was carefree and not involved in politics, but her friends and late boyfriend very much were. People on both sides of the conflict saw her as trouble. She did odd jobs and kept a low profile, sleeping on the street and in guest bedrooms of sympathetic neighbors, but she couldn’t establish a new life with things the way they were. She started writing to her sister in hopes she could leave for America and escape the scrutiny.

“I asked for their help, but they had sunk their savings into establishing his practice. They were living off very little income as the town wasn’t as well off as it is now. They started saving right away, and called what friends they had to give me a helping hand.”

She continued for months, doing cleaning, gardening, and child care for little money. For a short time she had managed to get a gig as a bookkeeper at a shop, which led her to a better opportunity. The shopkeeper couldn’t afford to keep her, but had made the acquaintance of a wealthy couple looking for someone trustworthy to help them with the estate of their deceased uncle.

“They needed someone trustworthy to help them with creating an inventory. I told them nobody in this town trusted me, but apparently I had made the impression on them that I wouldn’t be taking anything and I wouldn’t be blabbing their business to the whole neighborhood.”

They paid well. Not only that, they gave her a key to a spare room in their sizable mansion. They even invited her to have meals with them.

“I must have gained 20 pounds the first week. They said it was better for them since the work would be done quicker, but I also knew they were relieved I wasn’t going out. It didn’t matter, there wasn’t anything out there for me.”

So she kept working. There were odd things, for sure, she mentioned a bowl made out of what she was relatively certain was a human skull. A book made from leather too soft to be a cow. A collection of small animal skeletons from their cousin who had an interest in taxidermy. Each night she had dinner with them and they’d tell her about their family and the many odd habits and hobbies of each member. Apparently with the kind of wealth they had, few of them had to work and so many of them took up their strange interests as a way to ward off boredom.

“It didn’t seem that weird. We always joked growing up that these rich folk were getting their fortune from the life they stole from others in dark rituals. I guess finding out they carried around this junk made them seem quaint instead.”

She continued the inventory for weeks.

“The only thing more impressive than the amount of stuff was that they had space for all of it. When I turned in my ledgers each day, they’d go through and mark the things they were planning to sell, and it was barely a tenth of it all. I’d thought the attic was filled with more stuff than anyone could possibly acquire in a lifetime, and that was before they showed me the cellar.”

She didn’t like working in the cellar, where there was less light and it seemed to get colder throughout the weeks. It wasn’t helped by the fact that there were few people around during the week.

“Normally a house like that would have half a dozen or so servants, but they had only a cook and a maid, and neither liked to talk during the day or take their meals with the lord and lady. I wasn’t sure why–they were never unkind. I asked once why they didn’t have any children…they certainly weren’t short on space or money for rearing. Well, they said, they wanted children from the day they got married, but they couldn’t bear to have any while there was so much evil in the air. I assumed they meant the Troubles, but perhaps they didn’t.”

The work got more grueling as she continued on–the junk in the cellar was filthier and less organized. It was now taking weeks to get through space that had taken hours before.

“I had a ragged cold at one point and had to stop. They had soup sent to my room and had the staff check on me regularly. Again, it would be nice to think it was for my benefit, but they clearly had some other motive as well.”

It was when she came back after being sick that she noticed the chest of drawers. Her first impulse was to open it up and mark down everything inside, but it wouldn’t budge.

“It was a nice piece of furniture. Very pretty. Maybe the prettiest thing they had in there, so I didn’t want to break it. I asked about it at dinner and they got really cross. They said they told the housekeeper not to leave it down there. Then they stopped talking—became dead silent for what seemed like an hour—only to apologize and reassure me that it wasn’t a part of the inventory and that I shouldn’t concern myself with it.”

Sure enough it had disappeared by the time she started the next day. She put it out of her mind and dedicated herself to finishing up her work. She was sure she could afford to move to Iowa with the money she was saving and wanted to get out of the town that had turned its back on her.

“I just dropped the news at breakfast one day, that I was leaving for America and never coming back. They seemed surprised, but then excited. They said they needed someone to go to America for them. They needed someone to deliver something. Well, they said ‘deliver’, but what they meant was ‘take’.”

The deal was simple, they had already purchased a cabin on an expensive passenger vessel across the Atlantic.

“They would give me the ticket and the money they owed me along with a fee for taking it with me. The ship was incredible. The cabin was huge and the fee they gave me was more than they owed me for the work I’d already done.”

The item, of course, was the chest of drawers. They weren’t paying her to deliver it to someone in the states, they were paying her to take it with her and never come back.

“That seemed real odd, you know. They didn’t care where it went as long as it stayed across the ocean. Not just that, but they wanted to make sure it stayed gone. ‘Don’t sell, don’t trash it, keep it there or find someone who will keep it until long after we’re gone.’ This was starting to sound like a burden, so I told them I tried to open it, but couldn’t and I asked what was inside.”

“‘Nothing that will ever do anyone any good.’ the lady told me. ‘My brother…you see, he got into trouble–*real* trouble. The kind your family will never live down. They took him to jail but he ended his own life in his cell. ‘Good riddance,’ my mother once said. Well, the police searched his home and found all sorts of terrible things. And they took it all into evidence–all except that chest, it seems. I don’t know why, but they didn’t want it. ‘Nothing that will ever do anyone any good.’ is all they told me. And I believed them. We didn’t try to open it; we took it to the dump and buried it. Figured out there it’d rot like it oughta. A week later we got a call from the same policeman that brought it to us. Guess someone dug it up and was on their way to sell it when they hit a tree and died instantly. The chest was in the back of their truck without a scratch. At that point we figured we’d never be rid of it.’”

“It all felt a bit incredible to me. Like they were trying to fool me with a tall tale. ‘So you just kept it around waiting for a poor sap like me?’ I said. ‘Well, no’, she said. ‘We kept it locked up for the last two years. But each time we did, it would find its way out and the staff’s children would try to open it. We had to fire all the staff with children. We figured we finally had it trapped until you found it–we didn’t leave it out for you. We never would have. We have no idea how it wound up in the cellar while you worked. That’s when we realized we should move it. Take it to America and beg someone to keep it.’”

“I didn’t know how to respond. I was never superstitious, you see. You see enough real evil, you don’t need the supernatural stuff. But there was something not right about this. ‘You don’t have to keep it. We’ve paid you enough. Take over there and beg it off on someone else, if you want. Just make sure they’ll keep it. And…make sure they don’t have children.’”

“I should have paid more attention to that last part, I suppose. They told me the children were curious, but it wasn’t until your grandma and grandad had your dad that I found out how serious they were. It was a full time job keeping your dad and your uncle and you and your cousins and your siblings away from that thing.”

I was honestly a bit stunned by all these revelations. I knew my great aunt came from trauma in Ireland, but I had no idea how she got out. And why would she keep this thing for all these years if she was sure enough about it to keep us away? But she wasn’t lying when she said she wasn’t superstitious; she was the most grounded person I’d ever known. Was this why she never had kids of her own?

That was the last we ever spoke of it in person. I went to bed that night drunk and weary. And I had that dream again. Except this time there was no writhing creature in the darkness. There were only two red eyes. A man stepped forward…he was missing most of his face and jaw and his eyes shone that eerie red. He moved in that otherworldly fast and slow motion and when he got to me he laughed as I saw in his eyes my own face grinning unnaturally wide.

That was the last time I saw the chest of drawers or my great aunt. She sent me a letter last month, with the ominous words “Don’t keep it. Find someone to take it.” She had never shown signs of dementia but the letter was so disorganized and illegible I called my parents immediately. When they got me back on the phone an hour later they told me she had died in her sleep the night before.

When all was said and done, I was the primary beneficiary in her will. I was honored, but also a little uneasy because of her final letter and the story she told me back then. I went to her house to pick up her things so the landlord could clean up everything and get it ready for a new tenant. The whole house seemed so oppressive without her around. The garden out front was brown and dead. The inside was cold and dusty. And in the hallway, the chest of drawers was nowhere to be found.

You might ask at this point why I would want to find it. Maybe it’s better out there with someone who doesn’t know. But no one should take on a burden without knowing it. And I don’t want this thing to find its way back to me the way it did for the lord and the lady so many years ago. If you hear of it, see it, or have it, message me and I’ll come get it. I know this story may make you want to keep it or sell it, but that would be both crass and unwise. Let whatever lurks within remain at peace. And, whatever you do, keep it away from your children.
