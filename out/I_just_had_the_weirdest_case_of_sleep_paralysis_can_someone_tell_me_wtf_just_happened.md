Quick prelude edit: this really just happened moments ago, to me, in my real life. I picked r/nosleep because the event was spooky, but I am actually looking for answers/feedback. I’m not sure where else to ask.

I was just stuck for around 10 minutes, and some things happened I really can’t explain. My boyfriend said I should ask Reddit to see if this ever happened to anyone else.

So it started with getting out of my bed after an afternoon nap. I opened my eyes and saw my hands on my chest, and the room around me fully lit and the door across from me. So I got up, opened the door, walked through my living room and opened the front door… and it was some dreamscape… black sky, red lights, concrete wall where there was none before. I recognized immediately I was dreaming, and I could focus back on my actual body and open my eyes again. My hands were still on my chest.

I tried to keep my eyes open but they were really heavy, so it was hard. I tried to get up for quite a while. I’d throw my legs over, I’d feel everything move, my blanket, I felt my pants and shirt rubbing over my skin and I felt my feet hanging over the edge of the bed, but when I opened my eyes, I hadn’t moved. Nothing had changed. My hands were on my chest.

I forced my eyes to stay open and I moved my hands in front of my face. Nothing. I could feel my hands moving, I could feel the sleeves of my shirt while I moved my hands, but I saw them laying on my chest. I moved them right over my eyes. Still no visual movement. 

This is the part that was really weird. I touched my face. I felt the sensation in my fingertips and on my face. I physically pulled my eyelids up and my field of vision grew, my eyelids WERE pulled back… but my hands were still on my chest! I could see them!

I tried a lot of other stuff. I felt around for my phone and I found it next to me, and I moved it in front of my face so I could call someone for help, but of course there was nothing there. I just saw my hands on my chest. I tapped on it with my fingernail and I could hear it, and I could hear the movement of my clothes against the sheet. I accidentally bumped my phone against my face trying to see it. I felt the glass, it was cold. But the scene never changed.

I just kept trying and eventually one of my attempts just worked. I snapped up out of bed. I didn’t really believe it so I called my boyfriend. When I heard his voice, I didn’t really know what to say so I did my best to explain what just happened. I got up and went through the living room, went outside and it was normal. Not some dreamscape.

So yeah that’s it. I’ve heard of sleep paralysis but I’ve rarely had it happen to me, and I’ve never heard of it happening where you could feel yourself moving but you weren’t really moving. And even if that’s a thing… how in the hell did I pull back my eyelids when I could see my hands right in front of me not moving?
