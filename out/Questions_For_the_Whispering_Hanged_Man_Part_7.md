The preacher’s body slowly swung left to right in the church entrance, now blocking my exit. His whispering continued, “what questions do you have, what do you want to know, aren’t you curious to know what’s going on?” And I was, what were the smiling deer that always tried to eat me, what was with the residents of the town, why did the moon hunt, and where did it go at the end of every day. Though something was off, why did the book never mention this hanged man? What was he doing out here in the church and what was with this church? No crosses, no bibles, not even a statue of Jesus, just pews, a preacher stand, and the preacher hanging in the entry way.

I first needed to collect information, uttering my first question “who are you?” Immediately my body was wracked with pain, as if all my pores felt as if they were being slightly opened too wide. I could feel little drops of blood appearing all over my body, staining my clothes a crimson red. I gasped, falling to the floor in pain, much to the giggling of the hanged man. “Me? No one has asked that question before, for that I’ll give you two questions on the house. I’m the preacher of Fredericksburg, guiding the residents to a promising future. You can either follow my teachings, or return home, or what’s left of it anyway.”

My knees on the floor, body still pulsating in pain, I wondered what my next “freebie” question would be. Should I asked about what he meant by my world and “what’s left of it”? Do I just risk it? How bad could my world be compared to this one? Though as time goes on, I have been feeling my memories fade away, I know I received this book from someone and winded up here, but who was it? And why? I sat there, frozen in thought, the silence of the church being broken by screaming coming from outside. The screaming roosters were out, pretending to be my family again. I had an hour to get back to the cabin, back to the closest thing I can call home.

Knowing I may regret it, but I had to know, “who was the person that gave me the book, and why?” despite the darkness, I could see a grin appearing on the preacher. “I’m surprised you don’t remember the face of your own brother, though he came into this very same church demanding for a way to have his place taken by you.” I sat there in shock, trying to remember the faces of my family, their hobbies, the times we spent together, and yet nothing could come to mind. I remember their voices, yet nothing else.

Once again, an answer to my question ended up with me having even more questions, though every minute I spent here thinking about it, the less likely I’d be able to make it home. Looking at the grinning preacher, I asked him the question I originally came here for “how do I escape the town of Fredericksburg?” The grin faded from the preacher, and with an angry voice he spoke “Fine, though don’t come crawling back once you find out what has happened to your world. Though remember, once you start, you can’t stop the process. First you’ll need to return to the school and reclaim the memories you gave up to come here. Second, fuel up and begin leaving the town through the town exit, you’ll know where when the time comes. You’ll be driving a while, and if you wind up without any gas, be ready to become the shadows you see around town. Finally, you’ll reach the gate, bring the book and pass the gift of Fredericksburg to a new worthy body. Now get out, you don’t have much time before the moon finishes it’s blink.”

I wanted to ask more, what happened to my world, why did my brother send me here, what was the book, but I knew I wouldn’t be able to survive the “payment” again to ask another question. I thanked the preacher for the information he gave me. As I left, I heard him mumble “it’s not too late to join the residents, it’s a better future than what awaits you.”

I opened my car door, turned on the engine, and started my departure from the church, the answers from my questions swimming in my mind. What was going on? Should I stay in this nightmare realm? Was the preacher right in joining whatever the hell was in the buildings around town? Driving down the road with deflated tired didn’t help at all, though I made it into town without too many issues (besides bent rims). Darkness began falling on the town as the moon slowly began closing it’s eyelid, and that’s when I noticed it. The gas light, turns out 2 gallons wasn’t enough to make it home, leaving me a choice. Sprint to the cabin hoping I’ll avoid the monsters of the town, or take my chances in town and experience what happens in the darkness of the night.

I proceeded to the only gas station in town the book told me was safe, maybe I could… “shop” for 10 hours and make it through the night. My car grinding to a halt in the parking lot, I made my way, entering the gas station store. The gas station attendant this round was not covered in spiders at least, though I have a feeling most gas station attendants are supposed to have their eyes, ears, and shouldn’t be eating the brains out of a skull as if it was pudding. “How’s it going, can I shop around for a while?” I asked. “Of course” the attendant said with a coarse throat, “though if a resident finds you here, I’ll need some...payment, to not give you up. They’re very thirsty around this time, and you do have plenty of blood on you based on your shirt”
