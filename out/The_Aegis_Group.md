*The wipers squeaked back and forth rapidly, doing their best to keep up with the driving rain accumulating on the windshield of the all black van. The driver, realizing he couldnt turn them any higher, muttered quietly to himself and leaned closer to the to the steering wheel in an effort to see the lead van clearly.*



*“Not long now.” The man in the passenger seat spoke up for the first time since we had left the safe house.*



*“Two minutes out.”*



*In the rearmost of the two bench seats, I began a final check of my kit. Most of what the quartermaster had issued me when I had arrived was standard gear for a breacher in a tier one unit. Bump cap, carrier loaded with level IV plates and pouches for spare ammunition, first aid and whatever else the wearer might want to keep close at hand.*



*Rather than rifle magazines, the pouches on my vest had been loaded with a series of 6 round tear-away shotshell holders which could be attached to the velcro pad mounted on the side of my company issued weapon. The shotgun, a Beretta semi automatic, had been fitted with a sling, flashlight and an extension of the tube magazine that brought the capacity up to seven. All in all a standard loadout for an assault team breacher.*



*Looking around the van at the rest of the five man team, some of the gear they carried was anything but standard for what I assumed was a counter-terrorist unit. The big man who’d introduced himself as John sat solo in the bench seat ahead of me. As I watched him load his weapon I realized that he was loading a belt of 7.62 Nato rounds into what I had initially mistaken for an MP5. He in fact, had been issued an HK51b; a bastardized invention of the SAS that had coupled the manoeuvrability of a sub-machine gun with enough muzzle velocity to kill everyone two apartments over. It had been rejected by the Brits due to concerns about over-penetration and the fact that shooters found the flash and report from the shortened barrel to be ‘disturbing’.*



*Not the sort of thing most teams wanted going off in the same room as them.*



*Beside me sat a wiry, red-haired man whom I had only thus far heard referred to as Abe. He carried a short barrelled M4 carbine fitted with an underbarrel grenade launcher. His plate carrier was festooned with spare 40 millimetre grenade rounds of various types and purposes. I’d seen what some of those rounds were capable of during my time in Iraq and once again wondered just what sort of threats these guys were expecting on a domestic deployment.*



*What exactly was The Aegis Group involved in? Up to this point everyone I’d met since being recruited had been incredibly tight lipped, even for a community as secretive as spooks. This had to be Agency business, I reasoned; the recruitment had reeked of CIA. During the last work up, my commanding officer had informed me that I had been selected for a special assignment.*



*That afternoon I met with a man who called himself Lucian Duval. The meeting itself had been fairly informal; my service record spoke for itself, and he had clearly familiarized himself with it.*



*“You saw quite a bit of action over there, didn’t you?” He had asked me. His voice was low, with the faintest hint of an Italian accent.*



*“Yes sir”, I replied, “regular patrols and fifty direct action missions on my last tour.”*



*Lucian nodded, flipping casually through my file. “You’ve a great deal of experience as a breacher.” Not a question, a statement of fact.*



*“Correct, mechanical and explosive.”*



*The rest of the conversation followed in a very similar fashion, less an interview than a performance review. Once Lucian seemed satisfied that the information he’d obtained about me was accurate and complete, he laid my file on the table and stowed his reading glasses in his breast pocket. He looked up at me as though seeing me for the first time since we’d sat down. He seemed to appraise me for a moment before he broke the silence.*



*“Why exactly did you enlist, Sergeant Reid?”*



*I let out a small laugh. “Same reason every eighteen year old signs up I suppose. Serve my country and save the world”*



*Lucian’s mouth twitched up at one end momentarily in response, a flicker of a smile crossing his otherwise placid features.*



*“You wanted to help people?” He asked. “To protect the innocent from the wicked, yes?”*



*“Sounds a lot more noble when it’s all dressed up like that”, I replied, “but sure”.*



*Lucian nodded thoughtfully. “Are you religious?”*



*“Raised Christian and went to Catholic school most of my life, but I haven’t been to church since I left high school”*



*“Baptized, then?”*



*“Yes sir,” I replied, unsure of where this conversation was going.*



*Seemingly satisfied with my answer, Lucian began to gather his things into his briefcase.*



*“You’ll fly out this weekend. The paperwork’s already been taken care of with your commanding officer, as well as your bank details. Officially you’ll still be paid by the army, with a significant pay increase. As far as any outside observer is concerned you got a major promotion and sent work on some project with a high clearance level.*



*“Unofficially?” I asked.*



*Lucian handed me an ID card bearing my face and a false name next to an insignia of a shield bearing a red cross.*



*“Welcome to the Aegis Group.”*





*The two weeks since then had been a whirlwind of training and settling in the company headquarters. After arrival Id begun daily training in close-quarter scenarios on the range, followed by hand to hand practice. Outside of the shoothouse, I saw very little of the rest of the team. The team, such as it was, consisted of twelve men. Two five-man assault teams and a two man sniper-spotter pair.*



*They weren’t rude to me by any means, just curt. It quickly became obvious that they had recently lost the man I had been brought in to replace and were still grieving. Out of respect for their loss I did my best to give them space outside of training hours, spending my off time reading in my room or walking the woods that surrounded the compound.*



*Since then I’d had small conversations with John and Abe, who both seemed decent enough. Michael, the man currently driving us through the outskirts of Detroit, had spoken to me only once outside of work hours. On his visit to my quarters he’d introduced himself as the team leader and presented me with patches bearing the Aegis logo for my carrier and helmet. Before leaving he had also presented me with a beautifully carved rosary of some dark polished wood.*



*“Keep it under your vest,” he’d advised. “we all carry one with us in the field”.*



*I’d thanked him, taking the time to properly adorn my kit and stowing the rosary securely in the medical pouch affixed to my plate carrier. As little as the symbol meant to me, the was no question that I would be wearing the prayer beads under my armor. Every team had their superstition and it was not the place of the new guy to disrespect tradition.*



*The daily routine went on more or less the same: morning PT, range time and team, manoeuvres free time in the evening. Until two days ago. I had been reading in the headquarters library; adjacent to the chapel when my new company pager chimed and began to vibrate.*



*The message was directly from Lucian, reading only “Situation room. Ten minutes.”*



*Five minutes after the message went out, the team was gathered before a projector screen upon which were displayed a map of Detroit and street level photographs of a three story brick building.*



*“Our Michigan offices have picked up intelligence that suggests we have a hostile cell operating out of the east end of Detroit,,” he began. “We’ve tracked the movements of their leadership to an abandoned building approximately thirty minutes from the city centre. We expect level three resistance.”*



*The rest of the meeting had been a brief review on the layout of the building, and our plan of attack.*



*Which brings us to tonight. The plan was simple, but nonetheless effective for it’s simplicity. Our sniper team had infiltrated two hours after sundown and begun observation of the target building from a water tower three hundred yards to the north, feeding us updates on the comings and goings of the neighbourhood. The assault teams left the safehouse at 0230, aiming to be on site by 0300.*



*With a little bit of luck we might catch our hosts sleeping soundly, unprepared for out late night visit. On arrival, Alpha team --my team-- was to ascend to the roof via a ladder in the alleyway to the right of the building. Bravo team would hold the alley and cover our ascent until we were in position, then move to the front door while our sniper team provided overwatch of the surrounding area.*



*Once both assault teams were in position we were to simultaneously breach the roof access door and the front door. Bravo team would clear and hold the main floor while Alpha cleared the top floor and worked their way downward. By hitting them high and low at the same time we hoped to keep them from organizing any sort of defence. Once both teams met up on the main. floor, Alpha would proceed downstairs to clear the basement while Bravo held security on the main floor and waited to provide backup for us if things got hairy in the basement.*



*“Thirty seconds out” Dom broke the silence from the passenger seat.*



*I began feeding shells into the Beretta as the van slowed. Outside, rain hammered the body of the van as we passed an endless run of dilapidated, seemingly abandoned houses. The streetlights; where they still worked, showed overgrown yards filled with refuse. Broken windows and boarded up doors adorned the front of many of the homes we passed.*



*“Rough neighbourhood,” I said, to no one in particular.*



*John grunted his agreement. “Not likely to see any cops out here tonight, makes our job much easier.”*



*Dom’s radio crackled to life from the front seat: “Samson 1-1 this is Valkyrie. How Copy?”*



*Keying his radio, Dom replied, “Copy Valkyrie, how’s our approach looking?”*



*“All clear on the exterior at this time Samson, 1-1. Four military-aged males left in a sedan about thirty minutes ago, other than that nothing to report.”*



*“Copy that Valkyrie, you’ll have eyes on us momentarily.”*



*The vans rounded one final corner and came to a stop. The objective building lay a hundred and fifty meters ahead. A three story brick tenement building, its street-facing windows all boarded up. The light above the front door showed it to be of heavy steel, far newer than anything else on the block.*



*Our convoy coasted slowly, nearly silently the remaining distance to the building, pulling into the alley to its left. Once both vans were safely hidden in the darkness of the alley, Michael, our driver turned to face those of us who were seated in the back. As his gaze passed over each of us he withdrew from under his armor a rosary identical to the one that he had given me.*



*Michael bowed his head and began to pray. The rest of the men followed his lead, myself included once I caught on to what was happening.*



*“O Lord, my Rock and my Fortress,*  
*Shield us from the snare of the wicked.*  
*Let our hands be the instrument of Your justice*  
*And Your grace guide our hearts.*  
*Though we walk in the shadow of the serpent,*  
*We shall fear no evil.*  
*For You are with us.*  
*Your rod and Your sword,*  
*They guide and protect.*  
*Let us be the agents of your wrath,*  
*And the vessels of your mercy.*  
*In Your name, we go.”*



*“Amen,” came the team’s reply.*



*With that, the van doors were opened and the siege began. Bravo team exited their vehicle and took up security positions watching both ends of the alley. Once we were confident Bravo had all their angles covered, Alpha moved to the ladder at the end of the alley nearest our van. First up was Michael, slinging his rifle and bounding nimbly up the ladder. As he neared the top, he stopped and clipped himself to the ladder with a carabiner. Once secured, he shouldered his rifle and slowly peaked over the roofs edge, clearing it before climbing up. Next was Dom, followed closely by John, Abe and finally myself.*



*By the time I reached the rooftop, the team were stacked up to the left side of the door leading down into the building itself with the exception of Michael. He had climbed the water tank that sat atop the building and opened the hatch, seemingly murmuring to himself.*



*Once he joined the rest of us, Michael gave me a nod and bumped his fist twice on the front of his helmet in the universal sign for “breacher up”. I approached the door from the right, keeping out of the line of fire should anyone decide to shoot through the door.*



*It was steel, though nowhere near as heavy as the one up front. The shotgun would be sufficient to get through. I cycled the bolt on the Beretta, removing two of the buckshot rounds I had loaded earlier and replaced them with two specialized breaching rounds. Composed of powdered steel bound in ceramic, the breaching loads would dump all the energy into the door a short range, and disintegrate just on the other side, minimizing the risk of collateral damage or ricochet.*



*With the shotgun ready, I got into position to blow the hinges and waited on Michael’s signal. Ten seconds passed before his radio quietly spoke up. “Bravo team in position. On your go.”*

*Michael waved two fingers at me in a gesture vaguely resembling a finger gun. The Beretta roared as I fired two rapid blasts into the doors hinges.*



*With two of the door’s three connections to its frame effectively vaporized, the kick I followed up with was enough to knock it free and send it careening down the stairs. As the door came down, the beam of the flashlight affixed to my weapon flashed across the figure of a man raising a pistol. I fired twice, as fast as I could before ducking out of the opening for cover. As I withdrew, John rounded the corner of the doorframe from the opposite side, his shortened machine gun spewing a tremendous gout of flame as he let loose a hail of automatic fire down the stairs.*



*I finished reloading just as the rest of the team followed John down the stairwell. From the street below came the thunderous blast of a breaching charge as Bravo team blew the door clear of its frame.*



*With John leading the way, we surged down the stairs, stepping carefully over the crumpled body at the bottom. From the landing, a doorway led into a hallway that ran parallel to the staircase. Without missing a beat, John cleared the entrance and turned left, followed by Michael who proceeded to the right. He fired immediately upon rounding the corner trailed closely by Dom who had been the next to pass through.*



*With the immediate threat neutralized, Abe and I were clear to enter the hallway. The sounds of gunfire from the ground floor reverberated through the building. John, Michael and Dom stacked up on the first door to our left while Abe and myself set up to watch the hallway on our right. Halfway down the hall, about thirty feet away lay a prone figure in a blood soaked tank top and sweatpants, near his outstretched arm lay a large machete.*



*With Abe and I guarding their flank, the rest of the team went about clearing all the rooms to our left, one at a time. Any interior doors were unlikely to give them much trouble, but they would call me over should the need arise.*



*The first two rooms went without incident, but as the breaching team stacked up on their third, a door flung open at the far end of my sector. As I raised my gun the flashlight revealed the figure of a terrified young woman, shoeless and wearing ragged clothes. When the light hit her eyes she screamed, turning to run before another figure darted out behind her, grabbing her savagely by her matted hair.*



*The scrawny bastard was dragged fully into the hall by her momentum, the sawed off shotgun in his left hand swinging wildly about as he tried to keep his feet.*



*“Fuck,” I muttered as I adjusted my aim.*



*At this distance the pattern of the buckshot would be about fifteen inches across, more than enough to put pellets into the apparent hostage if I shot centre mass. When the sights settled just on the outside of the mans left hip I fired.*



*I’d guess about half of the shell’s nine pellets struck true. Flesh tore from the man’s side, and he fell to the floor as the pellets shattered his hip bone. The woman, now free of his grip, got to her feet and sprinted for the end of the hallway, disappearing into the stairwell that led to the lower levels.*



*The moment the girl was clear of her assailant Abe and I both fired on the wounded attacker, silencing his enraged screams and halting his attempts to raise his weapon. The sulfurous stench and haze of gunsmoke hung thick in the air as I began to reload.*



*Abe keyed his radio: “Bravo be advised, possible hostage headed your way, watch your fire on those stairs”*



*“Copy Alpha, will do,” came the radio’s reply.*



*Abe looked across the hall at me. “Nice shot, Reid”*



*I replied only with a curt nod, shouldering the Beretta and resuming my watch.*



*Two minutes passed as the rest of the team cleared the remaining rooms to my rear. From downstairs, Bravo’s sporadic gunfire lessened gradually before stopping completely.*



*A tap on my shoulder and a hand gesture in my peripheral vision informed me that it was time to advance. We moved up the hallway in bounds, two watching ahead while the other three cleared each room we passed.*



*Most of the rooms contained nothing of interest, only the odd piece of dingy, water damaged furniture and a variety of trash. When we reached the room the woman and her attacker had come from, I was the first to enter.*



*The walls were covered in sheets of notebook paper upon which were scrawled strange symbols, and text in a script I had never seen before. In the center of the room was a circle of candles, roughly six feet across, their wax melted and hardened in little puddles on the floor. Symbols matching some of those on display were painted in red within the circles borders. A chain lay in the circle, leading across the room where it was secured to the radiator.*



*Just what in the fuck had I gotten involved in? No time to ask now, hopefully the debrief would hold some answers.*



*“Clear,” I called out when I had finished searching the room.*



*On the way out, I stepped over the body of the man Abe and I had shot. He lay face down, blood soaking into the ugly, worn out carpet of the hall. As my light passed over him I paused. Where the blood hadn’t covered his skin, every visible inch was covered in tattoos. The mans arms, neck and scalp were covered in symbols and script that matched those that had covered the room.*



*I had just begun to kneel down to investigate the lifeless body when a word from Michael broke my concentration.*



*“Reid, let’s move. You’ll learn all you need to back at HQ.”*



*With that I regrouped with the rest of the team, topping up the Beretta with fresh rounds as I followed them to the end of the hallway. Upon reaching the stairwell, I once again took point, probing cautiously downwards as John covered me from the top landing.*



*Moving in turns so that the lead man was always covered by another in a good firing position, we quickly cleared the stairwell and proceeded into the hallway of the second floor. Here again, we cleared room after room, but found no resistance and nothing of interest save for a small cache of poorly maintained pistols and shotguns. About a dozen weapons in all, dotted with surface rust and likely stolen or sourced from local pawn shops.*



*Before leaving the room I emptied a box of buckshot from the accompanying ammunition stockpile into the dump bag on my carrier. With the second floor cleared, we stacked up on the door to the stairwell as Michael keyed his radio.*



*“Bravo this is Alpha, how copy?”*



*“Loud and clear Alpha” came the reply.*



*“Roger Bravo, upper floors secured. Coming your way now, watch fire.”*



*“Copy that Alpha, ground floor clear. Possible hostage secured”.*



*With that we proceeded down the stairs single file, weapons held at low ready. As we reached ground level, Michael stopped before the entrance and called out, “Friendlies coming through!”*



*The shouted response came a moment later, muffled slightly by the thick wooden door.*



*“Clear!”*



*Passing through the door and into the building’s lobby, the scent of gunpowder and fresh blood struck our nostrils. At the center of the room stood the members of Bravo team, our mirror image in their black tactical gear.*



*Pools of blood dotted the floor and spatter lined the walls near the motionless bodies that littered the lobby and adjoining hallway. In all, Bravo had put down six enemy combatants upon breaching the front door, a trail of spent casings marking their path from cover to cover during the ensuing firefight.*



*Michael crossed the room and was met halfway by Bravo’s team lead.*



*“Main floor’s clear.”*



*“Check” Michael replied. “Where are we at on the girl?” he asked, gesturing towards the bound, sobbing woman with his chin*



*“Haven’t run a check on her yet” came the response.*



*“She says she was grabbed off the street last weekend on the way home from work. There were two more girls here when she got here, apparently the fuckers dragged them into the basement two days ago and they never came back.”*



*Michael grunted in response then strode across the room, kneeling slowly beside the girl. She scarcely seemed to notice him, trembling and weeping uncontrollably as he began to speak.*



*“What’s your name?”*



*“Hannah,” she replied between choked sobs.*



*“Look at me, Hannah.”*



*Michael reached slowly for the woman’s face, provoking a panicked flinch on her part. A gentle hand laid upon her shoulder seemed to soothe her greatly. In a moment her breathing slowed and her tremors faded.*



*She allowed Michael to turn her face slowly towards him. There were still tears flowing freely down her filthy, bloodstained face but her eyes held none of the wild, unbridled terror we’d seen a moment before.*



*“You’re going to be alright,” Michael assured her.*



*As he spoke he withdrew a small piece of cloth from his pants pocket, and from a grenade pouch on his vest came a small plastic water bottle.*

*“Those men can’t hurt you anymore,” he continued, wetting the cloth thoroughly with the bottle.*



*“We’re going to get you out of here, but we still need to clear that basement. We’ll need you to stay outside in the van until we’re finished, is that alright?”*



*As he finished speaking, he began to wash the grime and dried blood from her face, gently wiping her clean with the cloth.*



*Hannah, now remarkably calm, just stared wide eyed at Michael nodding slowly.*



*Her face now clean, Michael gave Hannah a long drink from the remainder of the bottle, watching her intently as he did. Once she had had her fill, Michael turned back to Bravo’s team. lead.*



*“She’s clear,” Michael declared. “Get her to the van. Alpha’s headed to the basement while the rest of Bravo covers our six up here.”*



*“Roger,” came Bravo’s reply; then, keying his radio: “Samson 2-1 to Valkyrie”*



*“Go for Valkyrie,” the radio squawked back.*



*“Watch fire Valkyrie, two friendlies coming out with civilian for transport.”*



*“Roger that Samson. All clear out front.”*



*With that, the leader of Bravo gestured to two of his men, who cut Hannah’s restraints and escorted her out through the hole where the front door once stood.*



*Michael turned back to our team, “Ready up.”*



*Thirty seconds later, we were stacked up on either side of the doorway leading down to the basement. I was in the lead position on the right side of the empty doorframe, John opposite me on the left. With a shared glance and a nod, I rounded the corner.*



*The small circle of light from my weapon-mounted flashlight revealed an empty, flooded laundry room at the bottom of the stairwell. Six inches of water had pooled on the floor, trash and the bloated corpses of several rats floated on the surface. On the right hand side of the room sat the washer and dryer, decrepit and rusted with what must have been years of disuse. At the far end of the room was a heavy steel door, its hinges and latch bolted securely into the concrete wall of the basement.*



*“Clear” I whispered to John, and the rest of the team followed behind me as I descended the stairs.*



*The air was rich with the stench of rot and decay, growing thicker with each step we descended into the darkness.*



*Now standing ankle deep in the fetid water --and trying my very best not to think about what else I might be standing in-- I crossed the room to examine the door more closely.*



*It had to have been custom built, the steel of the hinges and latches much thicker than anything sold on the civilian market; each of the three latches secured with a heavy titanium padlock. Painted in dark red down its center was an inverted cross, surrounded by that same strange script.*



*“We’ll have to blow it,” I said, turning to Michael.*



*“Prep it,” he replied. “John, give him a hand.” His eyes fixed markedly on the symbols painted on the door.*



*It took John and I two minutes to get the charges set. Given the sturdiness of the door there was no chance in hell we were getting though it with anything less than two heavy directional charges. In such a tight space we’d have to take cover to keep ourselves clear of any shrapnel.*



*“Ready,” I called out, moving to join the rest of the team behind the stairs, feeding out the wire from my detonator as I crossed the room.*



*Once settled in, I turned to Michael, awaiting the order to pop the door.*



*He looked me in the eye and held the gaze.*



*“Reid, whatever we see on the other side of that door, shoot first. Don’t hesitate. Don’t ask questions. Just shoot. Understand?”*



*“B-but sir,” I stammered “those girls might still-” A firm hand on my shoulder cut me off.*



*“They’re gone,” Michael replied. “I know none of this makes sense to you right now, and there’s much worse yet to come. I need you to trust me and do as I say, can you do that?”*



*I nodded, speechless in the wake of his words.*



*“Good,” Michael said, readying his weapon. “Execute.”*



*The blast was tremendous in the confined concrete box. The thump of the charges going off was felt in our chests more than heard through our heavy ear protection. The door had been sheared in two, the greater part of it blown violently into the room beyond, six inches of ragged steel hung crookedly from the hinges.*



*Wordlessly we moved as one, crossing the room before the smoke cleared and anyone on the other side could recover from the blast.*



*Once through the door frame, the smell of death struck me like a kick to the guts. I fought the urge to vomit as the stench of rotting flesh wormed its way into my nostrils and filled my lungs.*



*Five flashlights danced across the room as we split up, clearing it from corner to corner, revealing the source of the aroma. Bodies, or rather fragments of bodies, littered the room. Arms and legs floated in the flooded room, white and bloated with rot.*



*“Jesus Chri-” I began before Michael clamped a hand over my mouth.*



*Quietly, softly at first we could hear a woman's wordless sobs emanating from the darkness across the room. The team leveled their weapons in the direction of the sound. Their flashlights began to flicker and burn out as the wails grew louder before dying out altogether, leaving us in complete darkness.*



*As the crying stopped, the sounds of many feet treading through water surged toward us from across the room.*



*“Abe, light, NOW!” Michael shouted, notes of panic seeping into his heretofore unshakable demeanour.*



*The footsteps drew nearer as Abe fumbled to load his launcher, their rhythmic splashing echoing in the cavernous room.*



*“Fifty feet;” John’s voice came as a shout from the darkness to my right.*



*Deep, rasping breaths could now be heard from the darkness. Abe cursed under his breath, followed by the sound of the 203 sliding home as he managed to load the illumination round.*



*“Fifteen feet!” John screamed, “contact front!” before opening fire into the void. The short barrelled machine gun spewed thunder and smoke. Rhythmic bursts of flame showed glimpses of something big coming towards him; of pale skin and of a great number of limbs bent at odd angles.*



*John stumbled backwards, falling to his back in the filthy, tepid water.*



*A loud thump sounded to my left and the darkness was driven back by brilliant white light as a flare struck the creature square in one of its chests.*



*I say chests. Not chest. There were several. Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw that night in the harsh, searing light of the flare.*



*The thing that loomed over John’s supine figure was not human; though it had once clearly been people. The lower half of its body was made up of several human torsos resting horizontally atop six sets of legs sewn roughly to the sides of the trunks.*



*Where the lower segment of its body ended, the torso continued vertically with the chests and abdomens of three women stitched shabbily together. Rotting, pallid wounds fused together at the seams to form a profane mockery of life.*



*The vertical portion of the beast’s body sported six sets of arms, the original set remaining on each torso, with a second set attached at the base of the ribcage.*



*Topping off the abomination was a scarred and badly decayed head. Its eyes were milky white, obscured slightly by the few remaining strands of greasy, matted hair. A skinless jaw hung open far too wide in a shriek of pain as the illumination round burned its way into the monstrosity’s core.*



*I froze in terror, time stretching onward as my mind fought to make sense of the thing that stood before us. I might have stood that way for eternity, slack jawed and awestruck if not for Michael.*



*He shook me from my stupor, grabbing me roughly by the front of my carrier and spinning me towards him.*



*“Get that fucking gun up!” He screamed before turning to face the creature, weapon slung and rosary stretched out before him, chanting in what sounded like Latin.*



*The beast, for its part, had turned its attention from John to Abe, seemingly enraged by the pain he had managed to inflict on it.*



*As it crossed in front of me I levelled my weapon, unsure where to aim. Centre mass becomes complicated when the target has greater than a half dozen torsos. I settled my sight on the point where the two segments of its body met, running the gun dry as I dumped seven rounds of double ought buck into the mass of decrepit flesh.*



*Each blast tore chunks of putrid flesh from the monster’s trunk, causing it to stumble as it lunged towards Abe and Dom. The upper half of its body lolled to one side as the supporting flesh was vaporized, forcing the beast to crawl along through the water on all of its many limbs.*



*The bolt on the Beretta locked back as the last round was fired. In my panic, I pulled the trigger twice more before realizing the gun was empty. Turning to my right, Michael had helped John to his feet and closed the gap between us.*



*Reaching me, Michael broke his chanting for an instant to call out “Alpha, Behind me! Back upstairs!”*



*The three of us circled to the left, Michael in the lead and John a half step behind strafing the creatures legs with bursts of automatic fire. My hands shaking, I struggled to load the shotgun, dropping several rounds in the process.*



*As we closed the distance to Abe and Dom, the nightmarish construct lashed out with its forward most arms, grabbing the former viciously around the shin.*



*Our grenadier was dragged down into the murky water with a sickening crunch as the beast snapped his leg at the knee, sinking its teeth into the flesh of his thigh.*



*As Abe began to cry out in pain, I levelled my weapon at the junction where arm met torso and let loose another salvo of buckshot. Flesh and bone were torn from the creatures flank as the arm was torn free of its body.*



*Another shriek of agony freed Abe’s leg from the wretched jaws as the writhing mass of limbs wheeled to face John, Michael and myself. John continued firing as I once again emptied my gun into the trunk of our attacker.*



*The light began to fade as the flare burned its last, but just as I was sure the darkness would consume us entirely, a faint glow began to emanate from Michael’s hand.*



*The rosary clutched tightly in his fist began to shine, softly at first with a gentle white light. As the intensity of his incantations increased, so too did the light the relic emitted. In a matter of seconds the crucifix grew from a dim flicker to blazing beacon of purest white light.*



*The creature drew back in pain, shielding its eyes with its remaining arms as it retreated to the edge of the light. John and I sheltered behind Michael on our way to retrieve our crippled teammate, Dom firing on our assailant the whole time.*



*He was in bad shape. His leg had been broken in two places, folded at an unnatural angle just above and below the knee. Blood poured fourth in spurts where a fist sized chunk of flesh had been torn from his thigh by jagged teeth.*



*John looked up from the wound and met my gaze. “Aterial bleed”*



*Abe screamed as John and Dom lifted him fully from the water, his bad leg hanging limply where the bones were broken. I dropped the Beretta, letting it hang by its sling as I pulled the tourniquet from my vest.*



*Abe’s howling reached its peak as I fought to stop the bleeding, hands shaking and slick with blood. It took three tries but eventually I was able to get him stabilized, screams fading to silence as shock took hold of him.*



*The creature crept back and forth along the light’s edge, testing its boundaries as it stalked our path to the exit. Michael maintained his sermon, a voice of thunder and fury that drove the beast back anytime it dare come too close.*



*We had nearly reached the door when it happened. Michael stumbled as he backed over the remnants of the security door and though it was not enough to break his prayer, he took his eyes off the enemy for a split second.*



*The beast saw its opportunity and seized it, tearing one of its wounded legs off at the stitches and hurled it at the priest, catching him squarely in the head.*



*Michael’s helmet took the majority of the blow, but it was still sufficient to break his concentration. He fell to his back and the light faded, darkness swallowing all save for the small patch of dim light coming through the door.*



*I cut Abe’s rifle from its sling as we raced the last few feet to the door. By the time I’d pulled a grenade from his carrier and loaded it, we were halfway up the stairs and the sound of our pursuers frenzied splashing had nearly reached the door.*



*I stepped aside, letting the rest of the team pass me by as I fixed my sights on the door. I fired as the first set of arms passed through, followed immediately by those horrible, milky eyes and maniacal grin.*



*The round struck low, detonating underneath the lower half of the creatures body, severing top from bottom. Its upper section fell limp as it hit the floor, and I had just crossed the threshold at the top of the stairs when I heard the sound of palms slapping on wood.*



*I turned to see what resembled a large, fleshy centipede barrelling up the stairs towards me. Its upper body was now propelling itself towards me on its many hands at a terrible speed, jaws snapping ravenously all the while.*



*I fell backwards into the lobby as I dropped the rifle, bringing my shotgun up as I hit the ground. I fired wildly from my back, emptying the gun into the advancing monstrosity, crippling two of its arms and all but destroying the upper left quadrant of its head.*



*I jammed my weapon into its jaws when it pounced, struggling against its sheer mass as it bettered me with its remaining limbs. It had nearly closed two of its hands around my throat when Michael reached the fire alarm.*



*Water poured down from the sprinklers and the creature writhed in agony. Everywhere the water touched its flesh it seemed to burn, smoke pouring up from the wounds and wails from its mouth.*



*Nearly half a minute passed before it finally died, coming to rest in a curled position that on a normal human body would’ve resembled the fetal position. It had been silent for another fifteen seconds before Michael began shouting instructions.*



*“John, Dom, get Abe outside, CasEvac is around the corner. Get them on the radio.”*



*Then, turning to Bravo’s leader “Harris, have your men rig the building, they’ve made this a temple to Astaroth. Babylon protocol is in effect, this building needs to be rubble five minutes after we leave.”*



*With that, everyone went about their tasks with rehearsed efficiency. I sat in silent shock, trying desperately to calm my racing heart.*



*I'm not sure how long Michael spoke to me as I remained motionless, gaze fixed on the husk of the thing that had just been trying to rip out my throat. At some point he extended a hand to me and I took it, allowing myself to be helped to my feet.*



*Michael guided me toward the door as he continued speaking*



*“You’ve done good work here tonight, Reid. Lucian and I will explain everything at the safe house.”*



*I stopped at the front door and turned to him, meeting his gaze*

*“W-what the hell w-was that thing?” I managed to stutter. “A-and how did you k-kill it?”*



*“Holy water,” was Michael’s reply. “I consecrated the reserve tank on the roof before we breached.”*



*Gesturing toward the things body, “As for that, it was an... avatar of the enemy, a body built for Astaroth by the cultists.”*



*I stared silently at him, left by his answer with only more questions.*



*Michael nodded. “You’ll be briefed at the safehouse but the short version is this: you’ve stepped into a war that has been going on for two thousand years, many good men have died fighting it and many more yet will.”*



*With that he turned to leave, pausing just before he stepped out into the storm. “We’re losing.”*



*Bravo went about their task as I followed Michael to the van, the heavy rain washing the blood from my clothes and into the gutters in snaking red trails.*
