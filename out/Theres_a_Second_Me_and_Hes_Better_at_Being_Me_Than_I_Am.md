It started with a voicemail.

Not a spooky whisper or distorted voices saying things like “get out.” Just a regular voicemail. From my own number.

“Hey, it’s me. Don’t freak out. I know this is gonna sound insane, but I need you to listen carefully.”

I froze. My blood felt like syrup. It was my voice. My cadence, my phrasing, even that annoying sniff I do before I talk.

“But I’m not you. Not exactly.”

I don’t remember the rest. I dropped my phone halfway through, my hand trembling, a metallic taste flooding my mouth. I didn’t sleep that night.

The next morning, I tried to play it again, but it was gone. Not deleted. Gone. Like it never existed. But I remember every word.

At first, I thought I was losing it. Stress from work, lack of sleep, maybe a psychotic break. My therapist said the same. I even took a week off to rest and reset. That’s when things got worse.

I started noticing changes in my apartment. Small at first. Coffee cups in the sink I didn’t use. The thermostat set two degrees higher than I ever put it. My toothpaste squeezed from the middle, which I never do.

Then, my neighbor waved at me. “Hey, man! Sorry again about the noise last night.”

I stared blankly. “What noise?”

He frowned. “The music? You were blasting that 80s playlist at midnight. You okay?”

I hadn’t played any music. I hadn’t even been home that night—I’d spent it at my brother’s house.

That’s when I checked the building’s security cam.

I watched myself walk into the building. Laughing. Carrying groceries. Even nodding at the front desk guy.

But I wasn’t there.

I stopped going outside. Changed my locks. Covered every reflective surface in my apartment. I didn’t want to see it again.

Because one night I did. Just a glimpse.

I was brushing my teeth when I looked up, and my reflection… wasn’t brushing.

He was staring.

Not even blinking. Just a wide, flat smile. A smile that didn’t belong on my face.

I punched the mirror. I bloodied my knuckles. I slept on the floor with the lights on.

A few days later, I got a call from my mother. She sounded cheerful. “It was so good seeing you today. You looked healthy. Finally.”

My stomach dropped. “Mom… I haven’t left the apartment in days.”

Silence.

“Don’t do that,” she said softly, her voice trembling. “Don’t scare me like that.”

She hung up.

Then came the job termination email. I hadn’t shown up for two weeks, they said. But apparently, I had. And I’d been… amazing.

“Confident, funny, focused.” My boss said I seemed like “a new man.”

He was right. Because it wasn’t me.

The final straw came last night.

I woke up to the sound of humming. Familiar. Low. Coming from the kitchen.

I crept out of bed and peeked around the corner.

There he was.

Sitting at my table.

Wearing my clothes. Eating my cereal. Reading my book.

He looked up and smiled—my smile, but warmer. More human.

“Hey,” he said, just like in the voicemail. “I’m sorry it had to happen this way.”

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t speak.

“You weren’t doing anything with your life,” he continued, standing slowly. “No ambition. No passion. Wasting every day. I’m fixing it.”

He stepped closer.

“I’m better at being you.”

I slammed the door and ran. I’ve been hiding in a motel for two nights now, writing this from a burner phone.

I don’t know what he is. A copy? A parasite? Something from another world?

But he’s taken everything. My job. My friends. My family.

And the worst part?

No one has noticed.

I called my brother an hour ago. I told him everything. He just laughed and said, “You’re being weird. You just left my place like twenty minutes ago.”

Twenty minutes ago?

I’m in another city.

He’s replacing me, piece by piece. Erasing me.

If you’re reading this, and something—anything—strange starts happening:

The mirror.  
The voicemail.  
The humming.

Run.

Because I don’t think there’s only one of him.
