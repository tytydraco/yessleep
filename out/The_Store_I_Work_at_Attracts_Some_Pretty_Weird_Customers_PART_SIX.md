Hey all. Been a minute, huh?

Sorry for the complete and total lack of an update, but a LOT has happened in the 20 days since I posted last. So? I’m going to tell you \*all\* of it. Every last word.

Before the main continuation of everything, there are actually two separate anecdotes I’d like to tell you about; Spike’s first Christmas here and our 4^(th) of July.

Since the 4^(th) happened recently, I’ll tell you that story first.

July 5^(th), 2025.

Hey all, it’s Ollie! Yesterday was the Fourth, and it was… uh… interesting to say the least.

Since it was a Friday, I had to work. Surprisingly enough, Spike, Lily and Clyde were there too. Guess they had nothing better to do during the holiday either.

I was doing my usual task of acting like I was doing something at one of the registers when the ding of the doors alerted me to the emergence of our newest customer.

“Happy Fourth of J—”

Before I could continue my greeting, I had to stop and actually look at what was in front of me.

Atop his head was a white hat with a starry blue strip near the base. He wore a blue jacket with a white undershirt and a red bowtie.

If you can believe it, he was also elderly.

I turned to Spike and whispered “you don’t think he’s?”

“No, he definitely is.”

I was pretty sure that I was looking at Uncle Sam.

“Okay,” I said “what brings you here?”

He looked into my eyes, and with a bombastic voice, yelled “I WANT YOU FOR THE U.S. ARMY!”

Okay, weird. Anyways, I cleared my throat and asked him if he wanted something else.

“I WANT YOU FOR THE U.S. ARMY!”

Whatever I was going to say was likely not going to work. So, I was going to do to him what we do to all customers who don’t buy anything and just come in to bother us.

We were going to kick him out.

“Sir. If you aren’t going to buy anything, then you’re going to need to leave, we do have a (insert me pointing to policy sign) No-Loitering Policy instilled, so, y’know.”

He didn’t look at me, but instead began to sing.

“O, Say Can You See—ee? By the Dawn’s—”

Spike decided to make a move before I did. He went over to the man, grabbed him, and walked him out of the store.

He walked back in with a grimace on his face.

“Man, the recruitment B.S was bad enough, but when he started talking about politics—”

“Thanks for removing him.”

“Huh? Oh, yeah, no problem buddy.”

And that was the Fourth. Not really eventful, but no matter how mundane, nothing here is going to be normal.

Spike here, Halloween was a bit of a wet blanket, so I’m going to tell you about my first Christmas here at the store. Christmas 2024.

This one was a bit strange, but nobody died during it so it’s already better than Halloween. We lose workers just as fast as we get them, so within the month, I had two new people to work with.

James and Holly.

It was us in the store on Christmas Eve. Yeah, it sucks that we had to work it but whatever.

We were actually having a little bit of fun just messing around considering there weren’t too many customers around.

I think the reason for that was likely the town-wide blizzard. We’re no strangers to snow here in Maine, but this instance was actually ridiculous.

It snowed every single day from the first of December until the first of January.

Anyways, we were definitely going to be spending the night in here as none of us wanted to try and brave the wall of snow blocking the auto-doors.

I like to keep a speaker on me “just in case” and it actually ended up paying off! Look at that.

Anyways, I was playing Christmas music and other festive audio experiences while we played Go Fish and 21. After we got bored of those, it was time to look through the break room cabinet.

What awaited us in that cabinet would forever change Christmas.

It was a game similar to Monopoly aptly named “CHRISTMAS RUSH”. The details of the game are as follows.

“*Become one of Santa’s elves and try to escape his workshop! Encounter patents to toys and make enough money to build new ones! If you can’t put your candy cane where your mouth is, then you’re on the naughty list! Hope you like coal!*”

The game sounded like fun, so we obviously had to play it. Not like there was much else to do there anyways.

The game had a little gimmick where you played with a snow-globe that had dice in it. That’s how you rolled them.

“You guys up for this?” I asked, pointing to the game.

They agreed.

We set it up on the table and began to play. About 15 minutes in, Holly noticed something at the bottom of the box.

*A note*.

“You two. Look at this.”

She began to read the letter.

“To any individual unfortunate enough to find this game. DO NOT OPEN IT! DO NOT USE THE SNOWGLOBE! SHAKING IT WILL BREAK THE CHAINS HOLDING BACK THE WRATH OF CHRISTMAS!”

I looked at her.

“Shit, okay, so just don’t shake it. Simple eno—”

My words were cut off by the sound of James shaking the globe.

I looked right at him.

“Did you just shake that?”

He gulped.

“Y—yes, I did.”

God dammit. We had one job to do and we couldn’t even cut it.

We decided that whatever was going to happen was going to happen and we went to sleep.

At about 3 in the morning, I had to go to the bathroom. Heading out to the front, I was startled to find Holly staring out of one of the windows.

She turned her head slightly and looked at me.

“I’ve had worse Christmases. Definitely not worse snowstorms though, jeeez.”

I walked up and stood next to her.

“Agreed. I’d rather be home with family right now but this—this is good too.”

Before she could respond, we both heard a skittering outside. The skittering was followed by a huge—

***CRASH***

“The hell was that?” Holly asked, looking more carefully out the window before turning to me. “Did you hear that too?”

“Yeah, the hell?”

I ruled out the possibility of some parent letting their kid roam around in these conditions on Christmas Eve. Okay, it was possible but be for real.

We began to hear snickering soon after.

Holly looked at me again. “Are we being pranked?”

That’s when we heard the sounds in the ceiling. Footsteps and snickering. I concluded that it couldn’t have been kids up there because they didn’t have the key that we use for it.

Some shuffling sounds came before an object fell out of one of the panels in the ceiling. It was a folding toy mirror.

Inside was a note that read “we’re in the ceiling, if you couldn’t tell!”

Geniuses.

I decided to communicate with them.

“HEY! I know you’re in the ceiling. You can come out, I’m not angry.”

Before my eyes, multiple ceiling panels fell to the floor and out came a bunch of… Elves.

These weren’t just any Elves, though; clad in green and red clothing with red pointy hats adorned by bells at the ends… These were Santa’s Elves. Holy shit.

The lead one spoke up.

“Good evening! We’re a loo-oong way from home, ha-ha!” They were all a staggering 2’5 and about as intimidating as a speck of dust. Physically, anyways.

“Looks like it. What happened to you guys?”

“We crashed into the dumpsters outside.”

Oh yeah, I guess I forgot to mention that we got new dumpsters.

“So, what do you guys need?” I asked.

“We need help nursing the reindeer back to health.”

That was easy, we had food and water.

“Why were you guys usin’ em anyways? Santa usually does this stuff, no?”

“We were sent out on a supply run. Papa Nick couldn’t do it cuz’ Mama Claus came down with a bad case of the Christmas Blues. So, he sent us out.”

“Okay. What should we do first?”

“We need to go outside.”

“Alright.”

*Shit.*

I looked over at Holly.

“Hey, help me with this, will you?”

“Sure.”

We went over to the automatic doors and braced ourselves.

“Gonna be cold.” I nudged her.

“Yup. It is going to suck.”

Within seconds of the doors opening, Holly and I were enveloped by the bitter hands of Winter. The snow raged on around us as we trekked through the parking lot to the reindeer with the Elves.

“So—” I said, taking a moment so I didn’t get snow in my mouth, “—anything we should look for? Like a signal for one of the reindeer?”

Holly nudged me.

“Spike. ‘Had a Very Shiny Nose? And if You Ever Saw it, You—‘”

Would Even Say it Glows, got it.

Just had to locate the blazing red glow of Rudolph’s nose.

The snow whipped against my bare skin and stung it. We should really invest in long sleeve work shirts.

I was hoping the frigid winds wouldn’t sweep the Elves off their feet, but I was also sure they had a way of making sure it didn’t.

Still, I had to make sure.

“HEY! YOU ELVES ALL GOOD BACK THERE?”

From the back, a voice squeaked out.

“yes.”

They must’ve been freezing, but they were okay, so I was okay too.

As we came upon the fallen calvary that was Rudolph and his brood, I could only think of one thing.

“I need a raise.”

I turned to the Elves.

“You fellows gonna help me with this?”

They responded by putting on gloves that appeared to be made of wood and metal.

They each grabbed a reindeer, excluding Rudolph and Dasher. Ones for Holly and me, I guess.

The harnesses on the reindeer clicked with the gloves and I suppose some technology was allowing the Elves to drag the reindeer along.

I grabbed Rudolph, Holly grabbed Dasher and we walked back to the store.

Nothing really happened on the way back.

We finally made it back and rushed inside to the soft, welcoming warmth of the store. We cranked up the heat and James was made to get food for the reindeer.

Then, for the next indeterminable number of hours, we sat in a circle, nursing the reindeer back to health.

“So,” I said, “Christmas is probably coming a bit late this year, huh?

“Nope!” The leader Elf responded. “Mr. Claus also came down with a case of Christmas Blues, so he made the rounds six hours in advance.”

“Cool!” I exclaimed.

The reindeer finally began to stir. They ate and drank like they hadn’t in weeks. And like that, they were back in tip-top flying shape.

Us three stood outside in the whipping cold.

The Elves had set up the reindeer and were nearly ready to go.

“Think you’ll make it back?” I asked.

“Definitely.”

We exchanged goodbyes and a ‘Merry Christmas!’ with them. And then they left.

They zoomed through the air, Rudolph’s nose leaving behind a streak of red as they cut through the Winter sky.

After that, the snow cleared up and we were able to go home.

So, we were able to celebrate with family and we essentially saved Christmas.

Lastly, even though it’s the middle of July, Merry Christmas, folks.

\-Spike.

It’s Ollie again.

Let me tell you what happened on July 6^(th), 2025.

So, it turns out Kent (our manager) can clone himself.

I discovered this when I found his corpse in one of our dumpsters.

“Kent, are you alive right now?”

“Yeah, I think so? What’s up, Ollie?”

“Found your corpse in one of the dumpsters.”

“You what?”

“I found your corpse in one of our dumpsters. Nasty thing, really. It’s all sludgy and shit. Guessing it isn’t really you?”

“Kind of.” He replied before hanging up.

Five minutes later, I saw a beat-up red Prius pull into the parking lot. Out of it came Kent.

He came right up to me.

“Where?”

I pointed at the dumpster.

“Okay.”

He spent a few minutes looking at it before coming back to me.

“Yup, that’s me alright. Good god.”

“So, how?” I asked.

“I was born with it, I think. Just always been able to split myself in two. It came in handy when I wanted to skip school or fulfill some social obligation. Funnily enough, I retain all the memories of a ‘me’ that I make. It isn’t hard, either; kind of like peeing yourself, if you get that.”

Okay, so my boss can clone himself, that’s kind of sick.

Spike here again.

While Ollie and Kent were dealing with all that, I was experiencing something strange too.

Okay, not really strange, but to put it in simple terms; I rage-baited the Grim Reaper.

I was manning the register like I usually do when I felt a heavy presence in front of me.

I looked up and saw nothing and something. It was there and it wasn’t. It existed and it didn’t. With form and formless. It was weird as hell.

It didn’t talk, no. Instead, it sent a message through me. In my brain. I felt a dull pressure in my head, like someone was fingering my Thalamus.

“I am the End.”

“You’re what?”

“I bring death to all.”

“Are you?—”

“Yes, I am Death.”

“So, are you going to buy something or not?”

“Materialistic desires do not affect me.”

“Then what? You’re gonna loiter? We have a policy against that.”

I was sick of his uptight attitude. He was pissing me off with the cryptic messages and florid wording.

“Do you remember when you were young? And you almost died? Do you remember, Stephen?”

I was puzzled.

“I think? Crushed a spider as a toddler when I meant to pick it up?”

“Correct.”

“Wait—are you here to finish the job?”

“Yes.” What a petty ASSHOLE.

“So, you’re gonna kill me. Big deal, others have tried and I’m still here.”

“Oh? Others have attempted to reap your soul?”

“Yup. AAAND they did way better than you. I mean, I’m still alive but they got closer to killing me than you, so I think it’s time to start practicing a little more, buddy.”

I felt nervousness in the Reaper.

“M—maybe you’re right. Okay, how can I be known as the Reaper and not even live up to it?”

“Mmm, I dunno. Maybe if you were good enough, you’d know.”

With that, it disappeared and what stood before me was a skeleton.

“My true form.” It told me.

“Okay. You gonna buy something?”

It bought a pack of mint gum and paid me with these weird black coins that had molten cracks in them. They emanated heat and hummed.

That was all for the 6^(th). However, the next four days were likely the craziest of any individual living in Fallscean, Maine.

The next part will be the last one, so stay tuned.

>It’s going to be a hell of a ride.
