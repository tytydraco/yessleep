Cassie set up a day and time for me to meet her mother. I took a day off work and drove down to Cassie's house; from there she drove us to Virginia. On the way, she told me a bit about what to expect. 

"She's pretty woo-woo, my mom. Growing up, I was always embarrassed by the herbal remedies and folk medicine and chants and spells and whatnot. As I've gotten older, though, my thinking's changed. I can't pretend like there haven't been times I've seen something in it."

She never used the word "witch."

Cassie's mom, Pria, had a small native plant nursery in Virginia horse country, out beyond the southwestern exurbs of DC. There was only one other car in the lot when we pulled in.

"So nice to meet you," Pria said. "Let me lock the gate, so that we won't be interrupted." 

When Cassie had said her mom was "woo woo," I pictured someone in loose, flowing robes of turquoise, crystals strung around her neck. Pria, though, cut a practical figure: khakis and a sweater, work boots, gardening gloves. Making small talk, she led us through the nursery past trees hung with wind chimes and into a quonset hut. 

Inside was much warmer, though I saw no source of heat. Bunches of herbs were hung around the hut and smooth, multicolored stones were scattered over the floor. She invited us each to sit on one of the large pillows in the middle of the hut, then chose for herself a pillow behind a low table.

"So, Lena," she said. "Cassie gave me the broad strokes, but why don't you tell me exactly what's going on?"

I did as she nodded along, gently prodding me from time to time for more detail.

When I was finished, she said, "It certainly sounds like something's wrong with your house. Given what happened with the architect, it seems logical that whatever's happening must be related. Only, a word of warning: These things don't always proceed according to obvious logic."

"So how do we find out what it is?"

She brought out the sketch I'd made of the symbol on Nick's back -- the one that Cassie had passed along. 

"I've been looking into this," she said. "No luck yet, but I've reached out to people who may be able to help. For now, unfortunately, all you can do is remain watchful. Though there are measures we can take to partially inoculate you from whatever's happening."

She grabbed a small silken satchel from the floor beside her and shook out, atop the low table, what looked like irregularly shaped, multisided dice made of stone with patterns carved into their sides. She gathered these up in her cupped hands and lowered her head, so that her forehead pressed against the stones, and began muttering to herself in a low voice in a language I couldn't place. 

This went on for a minute, until she raised her head and dropped the stones to the table, where they clattered around before coming to rest. Bracing her hands on each end of the table, she leaned over the stones, her head scanning left to right, right to left, back and forth, her gaze moving between stones, settling on one after another. 

Finally, she said, "OK," and rose abruptly from her pillow, walking across the hut to rummage in a cabinet. 

She returned with another stone, this one wide and flat like a dinner plate, with a subtle declivity in the middle of it. On this stone were small, squat glass bottles that she began uncorking in sequence, pouring portions of their contents into the declivity. One of the liquids was viscous, an impossibly deep red; another was thin and green; yet another a creamy blue; and still there were others. She stirred them together with a long black feather. The resulting mixture was thick and dark. 

Pria came and knelt before me on her knees and asked if I would lift my shirt above my belly. "This inoculation, it's not just for you." She swabbed some of the mixture with a fingertip and said, "May I?" gesturing at my pregnant stomach, just beginning to bulge. 

I nodded.

She smeared the liquid, first around my belly in a circle, next in a series of swipes and swabs within the circle. She leaned down close this pattern she'd created and began to speak lowly in the same language she'd spoken before. 

Then she spoke to me. "Close your eyes."

I did. And when she told me to open them again she had a small bucket, from which she withdrew a wet cloth that she used to clean off my stomach. She dried it with a towel and had me lower my shirt.

"Well," she said with the same brightly caring expression a mother might have after putting a band-aid on her kid's boo-boo. "That should do it."

The visit did seem to help. If nothing else, it was nice to have a plan, even if that plan was only to wait and watch. And I'd be lying if I said the ceremony didn't have an effect. It might've been a placebo, but it seemed to bolster my resolve to keep myself and my growing baby safe from whatever was happening.

This resolve allowed me to put some distance between myself and the house. Even though we were out in the sticks there was a little town about fifteen minutes away with a cafe that had perfectly serviceable wifi. I decided to start working from there as much as I could. It seemed to help.

For instance, I started to notice the way I was moving, my walking and gestures, to feel the strangeness in it that was causing the changes that Cassie had noticed -- those I'd previously noticed in Nick -- and correct for it, work against it. 

As I did, I resumed bumping into things around the house, so that I recognized for the first time the correlation between this phenomenon and the weird bodily physics that prevented it from happening. 

Nick was making dinner when I first mentioned how the house seemed constructed to subtly encourage a strange way of moving. He said, "What do you mean, strange?"

"Like the way you just picked up that spoon. The way you're stirring."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

I couldn't bring myself to point out the similarities between his manner and the architect's. Just mentioning the architect, I knew, would make it easy for him to dismiss whatever I was saying as paranoia. 

This was more or less what he'd accused me of whenever I mentioned my misgivings about the house. Everything I said, he countered with an explanation. The mass amnesia of our friends' visit: Everybody drank too much. The snakes: We were in the woods. His waking up outside: Sleepwalking. 

I told him about the feeling I had sometimes, in the house. Which would come over me much more frequently now that I was spending more time away. Whenever I returned it would greet me, just inside the door. And as it became more familiar I began to recognize that it had nothing to do with my pregnancy, with hormones or whatever -- that the feeling had an external source, that it was something environmental and alien. 

Of course, this was just a feeling. The easiest thing of all for Nick to dismiss.

I reminded myself that it was out of character for him to act this way, and that if there was something wrong with the house, something that had started working upon me when I sought Pria's help, that same something was still working upon Nick. He didn't have the benefit of a protective spell's effect, placebo or otherwise. I was, in a sense, the only protection he had. 

Which is why I took it as a good thing, or at least not a bad thing, when he started leaving the house at the end of his workdays -- even though those workdays had been growing longer and longer, his office door closed to the world for twelve or more hours at a stretch, and even though when he left he'd do so without telling me where he was going or when he'd be back. 

He would get home late, sometimes after I was already asleep. Whenever I asked him where he went he said just driving around. I started checking his odometer and it did appear to be true that he was putting serious mileage on the car, enough that he probably was spending most of his time on the road rather than any particular place. Getting away from the house had been good for me; maybe it would be good for him too. 

Meanwhile, I tried to remain as attuned as possible to my environment. I started picking up on things beyond the house's walls, out in the forest. Of course, a forest is resonant with mysterious sounds, from falling trees and branches and the unseen doings of woodland animals. Which is one thing to recognize on an intellectual level and another thing to accept when -- as was my experience, on one occasion -- you're lying in bed and hear what sounds like a whole uninterrupted procession of nocturnal critters down the hill from your house.

"Do you hear that?" I said softly, in case Nick too was awake. If he was, he didn't reply. Even if he had, though, I'm sure he would've told me to go to sleep, it was nothing to worry about. And in this case I likely would've conceded that he was right.

\###

It got to be that I rarely saw him. He'd already be in his office in the morning when I left for the cafe, and he'd still be there when I came back, then he'd drive off. 

One night, while he was away, I couldn't help myself, and went into his office to snoop. Everything appeared normal; he hadn't taken to scribbling mad ravings on the walls or anything like that. Waking up his computer, I entered his password and was happy to see he hadn't changed it. That had to be a good sign -- he wasn't so different that he'd started suspecting me of... well, of doing exactly what I was doing now, I guess. 

I didn't feel great about it. 

I clicked around aimlessly, eventually shuffling through code snippets in his repo. Like all code, it didn't mean much to me. But I took what seemed like a consolidation of several snippets and pushed it to his personal sandbox, to see what was there. 

What was there was either brilliant or crazy or both. 

There was no way any of this getting approved for production. It was such a fundamental change to the platform's building mechanics that it was a marvel he'd been able to pull it off. No wonder he'd been working such long hours.

The mechanics had nothing to do with building inside the platform's typical game-space, the blank grid. No, what Nick had done was engineer a way to build *between* game-spaces -- to connect grids one to another, not by putting them side by side but by tunneling between them, creating hidden portals. 

I clicked around for a long time. It was an amazing accomplishment, really. Amazing, albeit toward a strange purpose that I couldn't imagine getting any traction at the company. 

These tunnels could be as short or as long as the user desired. As the grids were connected by tunnels, they formed a kind of larger map. I pulled up the map that Nick had created.

His connected grids formed a gradually arcing vertical line that struck some chord in my memory. What was it? 

I'd seen this. Somewhere, I'd seen this pattern. A few minutes of trying to place it, then it came to me.

The references that the architect had provided us. Homesites in a line extending roughly south to north, arcing along the eastern side of the Appalachian ridge. 

A map of the homes the architect had built.

This couldn't have been a coincidence. I wondered if that's where Nick had been driving, all these nights racking up miles on the odometer, along this line of homes. 

Was he visiting the references? Were any of them experiencing what was happening to us?

Quickly closing out of the sandbox and putting Nick's computer to sleep, I let myself out of his office and went into my own, to sit at my laptop and find the references' contact information.

The next day I began what became an extended outreach campaign. It started with a round of calls, leaving voicemails, hi, this is Lena, you may remember me, etc., I'm hoping to connect. When a day later I hadn't received any return calls I sent a round of emails, trying to sound as casual as possible, assuring the references that I wasn't contacting them about all that unfortunate business with the cameras. No, I just wanted to ask them some questions about their houses and the way they were designed. 

No responses there either. 

Another round of calls, leaving voicemails. And another. Then a second round of emails.

Finally, I decided: Fine. If Nick can drive from place to place, so can I.

On my first round of visits I waited until I knew someone was home, then went right up and knocked on front doors. Nobody did anything sketchy like pretend they weren't there. No, they opened right up, greeted me pleasantly enough, said oh of course they recognized me, yes yes, made excuses for why they hadn't had a chance to return my voicemails or emails, asked me if everything was OK. 

I recognized them from our video calls, or thought I did. But something seemed off. At first I couldn't figure out what it was. It finally hit me after one of these visits on the long drive home.

Babies. There should've been babies.

Several of the women had been noticeably pregnant when we'd called them as references. Since then, a little more than a year had passed. All the pregnant women would've given birth by now -- several months ago, at the latest. So where were the babies? 

Watching the houses to make sure someone was home, I'd seen people come and go, but not with babies in tow. Standing on doorsteps, talking to these people, there had been no babies in sight, no telltale cries coming from within. 

And hadn't some of these couples, all those months ago, had newborns at home? Those newborns should've been crawling around by now. Where were they?

Some of the women, now, were pregnant and showing. Were some of them the same women who'd been noticeably pregnant during those previous conversations? I thought so but couldn't be absolutely certain. In any case, there should've been babies somewhere. 

Over the next couple weeks, I made a few more rounds of visits, lurking to observe the houses from a discreet distance, watching the couples come and go. Pregnant bellies. No babies. 

Stillbirths? Miscarriages? Such tragedies did happen, but what were the chances that they'd happened to all of these women? Even if they had, that didn't explain where the newborns had gone. Assuming I was remembering correctly.

I didn't mention anything to Nick. Obviously he didn't know I'd been making these visits. But I figured I could safely ask him if he remembered the conversations we had with the architect's references, if I was correct in remembering that at least one of the couples had a newborn.

Of course, to ask him I had to wait until he emerged from his office. By now he'd taken to locking himself in and he wouldn't always respond to knocks at the door. When he did emerge he'd do so looking tired and ragged. Sometimes his skin or clothes were smeared with what at first I took to be ash or soot. 

When I finally got a chance to ask, he told me he didn't remember about any babies.

"Speaking of babies," I said, hands on my bulging stomach. "We should start thinking about converting your office soon. Or I suppose we could convert mine."

Truth told, I was beginning to worry that I'd already accumulated so many bad associations with his office -- the closed door and what it seemed to mean, that is -- that I didn't want it to be my baby's room anymore.

I mean "our." Our baby's room.

It was sometimes easy to forget that Nick had anything to do with the life growing inside me. He never asked how I was feeling. Fortunately I'd had a pretty easy pregnancy -- no morning sickness early on, no dysgeusia -- but that wasn't the point. Even when he did come along to the checkups with the obstetrician he seemed distant, uninvested. 

Which is why the forcefulness of his response, now, surprised me. 

"What? No," he said. "My office is the baby's room. It's always been the baby's room. I've just been working in it. We'll convert it. Very soon. It's almost ready."

I was happily surprised by this show of enthusiasm. Every day the baby seemed less like an idea and more like what it was, a little life growing inside me, a person I was already beginning to know. Soon we'd be finding out boy or girl. I knew that Nick, at least the one I knew so well, or thought I did, would make a great father. I wanted him to be as excited at the prospect of parenthood as I was.

It didn't occur to me until later what he might've meant about the room almost being ready. Ready how? 

But by then he was back in the office with the door locked.

I knocked, intending to ask him. No answer. Until now, I hadn't forced the issue when he chose not to respond. It seemed absurd, standing there and banging on the door, playacting the shrewish spouse -- and to what end? So that I could force him to open the door when he didn't feel like it?

No, I wouldn't let him put me in that position. Not even now. But there was another option.

I went to the kitchen and from the junk drawer retrieved one of the little hooks that came with the doorknobs and allow you to unlock them from the outside in the event of emergency. I returned to the door, slipped the hook into the small circle in the center of the doorknob, and fiddled around until I felt something click. I opened the door.

And Nick wasn't there.

For a long moment, I stood in the doorway, having a hard time getting my mind around it. 

"Nick?" I said, looking under his desk, like he was playing hide and seek. I checked the corner behind the armchair. I checked the closet. I even checked the storage cabinet under the window seat, though it was too small to fit him. He was nowhere. I checked the windows -- locked. 

I sat down in his desk chair and cried. It was an unfocused sort of cry. At the impossibility of the situation, the possibility that I was losing my mind, the loss of Nick both figuratively and literally, I don't know. 

After a while I got it in my head that maybe he was about to knock on the front door, the way he had that morning I'd awoken to find him missing. I went out to the deck and looked all around. With the leaves down I could see well into the distance through the trees. No sign of Nick; no sign of anyone. 

I went back inside and grabbed my phone from the kitchen counter and was contemplating who to call and what to do when I heard the door to Nick's office open, and a second later he was standing there in front of me.

"What happened? Where were you?"

"What do you mean?"

"I mean where'd you go?"

"I was in my office."

"No. I was in your office. And you weren't there."

"How?" His eyes narrowed. "The door was locked."

"I let myself in. It doesn't matter. Where were you?"

"Yes it does," he said calmly. "It does matter." He headed back down the hall and into his office and slammed the door hard enough that I heard something fall off a wall somewhere. That day, he went out and bought a deadbolt for his office door and kept the keys for himself.

I shouldn't have been surprised, I suppose, when a short time later I found out that Nick had been fired. 

Like I mentioned, our paths rarely crossed at work. In fact, the way the company was organized, even the paths of the people whose paths crossed ours rarely crossed each other's. But rarely isn't never, and I guess word made its way around. Then it was just a matter of time before it made its way to me.

It was in the course of an otherwise banal Slack thread, a colleague saying that she heard the news and was sorry. I had no idea what she was talking about. I wondered if maybe she'd confused me with someone else. After a brief, confusing exchange, she explained that she'd heard about Nick. 

Not only had he been fired, he'd been fired several weeks ago. Which fact raised a number of questions, not least of which was how and why money in the amount of his typical paycheck had continued to be deposited into our shared account per its typical schedule.

I confronted him that evening when he emerged from his office. 

"It doesn't matter," he said.

"Where's the money coming from?"

"I don't know. The house provides."

"What do you mean?"

"The work I'm doing is important. The job doesn't matter."

"I saw your work. The map. The other houses." I assumed that this -- the time he'd wasted on it -- was what ended up getting him fired.

"What I'm building, what I'm doing, you don't understand. You've had every opportunity to understand, but you don't."

"Nick, please. Talk to me. You're right. I don't know what's happening. Not the job -- I don't care about that. I mean you. I don't know what's happening with you. With us."

"Us," he said, his voice dripping with contempt. He looked around, exasperated, as if appealing to some sympathetic, unseen audience. Then he turned around, returned to his office, and bolted the door.

\###

"Help me," I said to Pria on the phone, after getting her number from Cassie. "I'm losing my husband. Or my mind."

She still didn't have any concrete updates about the symbol on Nick's back, though she'd managed to connect with someone who thought it appeared familiar and was looking into it. "Until I hear more, maybe there's some way to help him," she said. "Could you get him down here?"

"I doubt it. No, I'm sure I couldn't. He's too far gone. It's the house, something about this house."

A long pause. I thought I could hear her breathing. Finally she said, "I can't promise anything. But I have an idea."

She said that she could visit the house and give it a kind of cleansing, that she'd done something like this before with good results. I asked if it was OK that Nick was there, assuming that when she came he'd be locked away in his office like always. She said that was fine. Maybe even for the best.

And indeed the day she came by, one of those cold, overcast, early December days that seems to leech the color out of everything, he was in his office. He hadn't emerged at all and he hadn't spoken to me in days. 

Pria's car came up the driveway and I pulled on my coat to meet her outside, so that we could talk for a moment without Nick overhearing. She stepped out of the car as I approached, giving her a little wave. She didn't return it, didn't even look at me. She was looking at the house. 

"Well, this is it," I said.

She continued to stare at the house and I half-expected her to offer some desultory compliment about it, the way our friends had.

"It's terrible," she said.

"It is?" I turned around so that we were both staring at it. And, yeah, I mean, I too thought it was terrible. Even now, though, with all that was happening, whenever I looked at it I still felt a vestigial twinge of aesthetic appreciation. 

"I started to feel it as soon as I pulled onto your driveway. The energy. It... emanates. Do you mind if I walk around?"

"Of course" I said. Then, thinking of Nick: "Except maybe not the far corner. That's my husband's office. He's in there, working."

As she walked the perimeter, periodically stopping to close her eyes as if in concentration, I followed, trying to pick up on whatever she was sensing. When we neared the corner of Nick's office she said, "You say your husband's in there?"

"Yeah. Has been all day."

She held her palms up toward the corner, took a step closer, then stopped in her tracks. A long black snake blocked her path. "That's strange," she said, taking a few steps back. "A bit cold for snakes, isn't it?"

"I don't know. We see a lot of them."

We ended up back in the driveway, near the front door. "Well," I said. "Come on in, I guess."

She smiled an uncertain smile. I led her to the door and opened it, then stepped aside to let her in. She remained on the stoop just outside, taking deep breaths. She squared her shoulders as if to brace herself and took a step inside -- then immediately backed out, so fast she almost stumbled. 

"What's the matter?" I said, going out to steady her. She looked like she might collapse.

"I can't. I can't go in there." 

As she continued to back away from the house, she seemed to regain her steadiness, her composure. I went to close the front door, then rejoined her. She was leaning against her car, catching her breath. As I approached, she regarded me with something like disbelief.

"You've been living in there?" she said. I nodded and she went on: "You must have incredible strength."

"I don't know about that."

"To withstand a place like this? Oh, yes."

"Maybe it's your spell. The inoculation, you called it."

She shook her head. "That was nothing. Nothing compared to this. Like taking a vitamin for cancer."

"Cancer? You think that it's going to kill me?"

"Sorry, no, I- Listen. I don't know exactly what you're dealing with here. I've never encountered anything like it. Maybe somewhere in my reading, only, well, I'll be completely honest with you: From what you and Cassie told me, I had no idea it was this serious. I knew you were upset, but in situations like this, faced with the conventionally inexplicable, most people tend to overreact. I wasn't ready for this."

"Isn't there anything you can do?

"Not today. It will take me time to prepare. I'm sorry."

"No, no, that's OK," I said. "That's fine. That's fine." But even as I said this I found that I was leaning back against her car and had started to slide slowly down to the ground. After a moment I was sitting on the gravel with my arms on my knees, then my head in my arms, then crying to myself. "What do I do?"

"Do you have someplace to stay? No, scratch that, of course you do. You can stay with Cassie. Pack a bag. Give me a few days to figure something out. A week at most."

I looked up at her. "What about Nick?"

Pria didn't immediately answer. She didn't need to. Her expression was all the answer I needed. I broke inside.

"I'm not saying it's too late to help him," she said. "But it's like you told me on the phone, about how part of him must be gone -- about how it's the house. Even if he'd agree to leave with you, it might not be safe. Not until we know what we're dealing with."

Leaning against her car, I'd lowered my knees so that my legs were splayed out in front of me. I managed to nod. 

"Good, good," Pria said, and helped me up. "Do you think you can pack so that he doesn't see? It's better if he doesn't know your'e leaving. Better if the house doesn't know, to tell the truth, but that can't be helped."

"That shouldn't be a problem."

"I'll call Cassie. Tell her to expect to hear from you."

I stood in the driveway as Pria pulled away. Then I turned to look at the house.

Her reaction had rattled me, even as it reassured me that I wasn't losing my mind. I knew that the situation was grave. Even so, it had never occurred to me that I'd have to abandon Nick, however temporarily. And abandon him to what, exactly? Not even Pria had been able to say. 

Our house. Our terrible home.

I clasped my arms protectively around my stomach and stepped inside.

It didn't take a great deal of cunning to pack a bag without Nick's knowing. All I had to do was keep an ear out for his office door, which rarely opened. Once packed I could've -- probably should've -- left immediately. Most likely he wouldn't have realized I was gone, not until later, when he returned home. But there was something I wanted to do before leaving. So I put the bag in my closet and waited. 

When night fell, he emerged, locked the office door behind him, then drove away without so much as acknowledging my presence.

As soon as his taillights disappeared down the drive, I went outside and around to the storage shed, looking for the right tool. Maybe the chainsaw? What I really needed was a sledge, but all we had were hammers. Then I got an idea.

I went inside, into my office, and grabbed the chrome sculpture from the corner where it had been banished. It was certainly solid enough for the job. Holding it upside-down, like a baseball bat, I took a couple swings. Yes, it would do nicely.

I checked Nick's office door, just to make sure. As expected, he'd bolted it.

The last time we'd spoken, days ago, he told me I didn't understand what he was doing. He was right. Before leaving, I meant to fix that. "You've had every opportunity to understand," he'd spat at me. 

So here I was, seizing the opportunity. 

I swung the sculpture at his door, up by the deadbolt, with all the strength I had. Still, it didn't give until the third swing, the force of which ripped the bolt through the frame. The door swung open. I let the sculpture fall to the floor and stepped inside.

Like Pria said, we didn't know exactly what we were dealing with. But I did know that Nick's work was related to it, somehow. He'd said so himself. And his work had already led me to an apparent connection between our house and others that the architect had built, to the families in those houses. 

To what am I abandoning you, Nick? 

To what have you abandoned me?

I woke up his computer, went to his repo, started pushing his recent code to the sandbox. The map had grown, the constellation of building grids having expanded along its arc. But that wasn't all. He'd continued to tweak the platform's building mechanics. Only whereas before he'd done so by building outward from the game-space, connecting one grid to another, this time he'd built inward. 

Per the platform's normal mechanics, the user builds with configurations of blocks. I'd already seen how Nick had created configurations to recreate the panels used in the construction of our house. What he'd since done, I now saw, was to create functionality that allowed the user to build *within* these panels, within individual blocks. 

It made each block, in essence, a small, three-dimensional building grid. At first, I absorbed this simply as a feat of engineering, and in that light it was impressive. It was more than that, though. It had to be. 

To this point, Nick had been recreating in virtual space what the architect was doing in physical space. Which meant...

The now-familiar feeling flooded in, stronger than ever. A lurking and something else, something active, moving all around me. So strong that it drove me from the office and into the hall, into the bedroom, to sit at the foot of the bed and collect myself. 

Here, the feeling was almost as strong, but different -- missing that active, vital element it had in the office. I waited for it to pass, but it didn't. After a while I stopped waiting and tried to think. To concentrate not on the feeling itself but its implications -- on some insight that I could almost grasp. 

Then I had it.

I went out to the hallway and picked up the sculpture from the floor. Holding it upside down, by its narrow end, I returned to the master bedroom. It was as good a place to begin as any. 

Time to open up the walls.
