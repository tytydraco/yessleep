I have some good news, well… sort of, [my phone was slowly dying](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12v1r5b/ive_been_stuck_in_an_airplane_for_the_past_9/) but I rummaged around in other peoples bags and managed to find a power bank and a cable that I could use to charge up my phone, so at least that’s something… however what happened after was less than good… I got a bit curious in case there was someone I recognized in the pile of flesh, so I walked up to it to take a look. It was indistinguishable what it was, just looked like a mashup of skin, muscle tissue, dark red blood and something glittery… then it started moving… or rather writhing.. I took two quick steps back and felt my heart suddenly racing and my lungs breathing quickly. 

I could feel panic starting to fill my entire body as the pile of flesh started almost breathing and slowly rose to about the height of an average human, long tentacles started reaching out going everywhere, it almost looked like a huge octopus made out of human parts, the sight of this thing terrifying me so badly that I couldn’t move any part of my body, I was just frozen in place when I suddenly got the wind knocked out of me and I flew for a few meters.. luckily I landed on a few soft bags, instinctively I grabbed the nearest heavy looking bag and threw it at the giant octopus, I heard a giant roar, both from it and from what I could only assume was the boy upstairs

That’s when my legs finally was able to respond, I ran, I just ran faster than my legs or lungs was ever designed for, it felt like they were going to explode at any given moment, but I had to get away from that monster, I was dodging bags and various luggage in my way until I finally reached a yellow ladder.. I climbed it as quickly as I could, the sudden rush of adrenaline made me able to just force open the overhead hatch that blocked my way going up the ladder. I quickly closed the hatch and sat myself on top of it hearing loud slams of giant tentacles hitting the hatch, feeling the thumps in my entire body as they hit.

They eventually stopped and I had time to realize that  I needed to focus my breathing and calm my heart down, I did look around though, I was now in the cockpit, it was empty and moldy, at least from what I could see sitting on the hatch, when I was finally able to move again I got up and decided to take a better look around, there was the door leading out to the passenger area, right next to it was another door, I opened it and carefully peeked inside, there was pretty much only a bed and a nightstand in there, that wasn’t important right now though, I only needed to check that there wasn’t anything that could be dangerous in there. What was more important was checking the controls, the captains and the copilot chairs where empty.. or not exactly empty, there was piles of ash in both of them, but I could see on some of the screens that were still working that we were on autopilot, and that the fuel level was… huh !?how’s that possible !? 1/4th tank of fuel !? But the power systems seems to be wonky at best..

I managed to find the emergency manual checklist that I have seen the pilots use in various episodes of air crash investigations, and with it I managed to set the emergency frequencies on the radio, called out emergency several times, broadcasting on as many frequencies as I possibly could, no help, I could only hear static on the radio, which was strange considering that according to the navigation system I was pretty close to several countries and the signal should have gone out to everyone.

I was even able to fire up an emergency generator that these planes have in case of power failure, hoping that I could get the ventilation system working again, no dice, seems like the entire system was clogged or something, but I did make a decision though, you see whatever this mold was could apparently affect both living and dead tissue, and the only logical conclusion I could make from us still having fuel, was that it somehow converted biological things into fuel so that the plane could continue on its programmed path, probably while it was still building that creature in the luggage area, I… I think that the only option I have… I think I need to crash the plane.. and the best place to crash it would probably be the ocean, I think I might have a slight chance of survival, and I don’t think that neither the boy or the giant octopus looking thing could survive in the actual depths of the ocean, even if I don’t survive the crash, I just can’t let these things get out there in the world..

I managed to manipulate the autopilot enough that we would be on a fast decent down into the water between Sweden and Estonia, while I was sitting there in the captains chair just pondering the consequences of my choice, I noticed that by 2 fighter jets showed up on each side of the plane I think they tried contacting this plane… and when they didn’t get any response they decided to to a visual inspection, I don’t think anything looked very much off from the outside, I tried my best to just look forward so that they wouldn’t notice me, and I think they didn’t see anything through the windows, because they broke formation pretty quickly.. I just want this to end now… I can hear both the zombiefied octopus and the boy screaming and banging and scratching on the doors… and honestly.. I’m terrified… this might be the last thing I do… I really hope it’s the right decision. I can feel the plane descending faster and faster now, gaining in speed and momentum, I just hope it will be over fast…
