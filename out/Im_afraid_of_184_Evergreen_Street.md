  Hi, just letting you know this might be a long post because the events surrounding this delivery was … strange? I don't know, maybe you can shed some light in my situation.


   So I'm a mailman. I deliver letters and packages to people's house's. Sometimes I just put them in their mailbox.


   Anyways. On this one delivery I had a busy day. There was a bunch of mail as it was the first week of the month. All of us scrambled at the post office trying to get the stuff right. I put all the mail that was supposed to be delivered into the truck and pulled out.


   So far the day was going good. The cool breeze of winter after the months first snowfall gave me the chills but it was good in all. As I got to the last few bits of mail I got a certain mail that went to an address that I never heard of.


   "184 Evergreen Street?" I mumbled to myself looking at the mail I was holding.


   There ain't no Evergreen Street and I know that since I've lived here all my life. I then reached for my phone and got it out. I typed the address in the GPS and for my surprise the street was there.


   "Well I'll be damned", i said as I went to the location of the address.


   It still gave me an odd feeling though. Like I was moving towards a monster that was gonna get me as his prey. I thought. That's ridiculous though. It's just another delivery.


   I went and turned my last right through the local trailer park. We call it "Drug Street" at the office, because all the drug addicts live there.


   When i went down the road this address was in I got a sense of dread. I felt like eye's were looking at me in all directions. It was especially eerie since there wasn't even a single house or trailer in this entire street! 


   "What the he'll?" I said out loud. I looked again at the GPS. Sure enough it was still leading me where I needed to go but from it's standards it's in the middle of the street.


   As I got closer to the abandoned neighborhood I still feel the goosebumps crawling all over me. 


   I went to the final point and as my heart was beating out of my chest I only saw a mailbox. I breathed a sigh of relief, "it's just a mailbox", I said to myself.


   I then grabbed thw letter I was supposed to deliver and walked out of the van. As soon as I got out of the van the feeling of dread, sorrow, and fear was so strong that I threw up. I then walked fast enough to the mailbox and put the letter in, shut it" and walked fast again to my van.


   As soon as i got it relief swept through me. "What the hell us going on?" I said. I have never been scared of a delivery before so why the hell start now. 


   I drove off to finish my delivery. As I exited the street I looked back at that lone mailbox. Why was I so afraid of it? I then laughed it off and finished my day.

   Charlie: So how was work?

   Sam: Same old same old. Hey you ever heard of a 184 Evergreen Street?

   Charlie: Doesn't ring a bell, I don't even think we do have a Evergreen.

   Sam: Thought so it was weird. 

   Charlie: Like how?

   Sam: I don't know. There was only one mailbox at that whole street. No houses just a mailbox.

   Charlie: You think one of them drug addicts at the "Park" uses it as his personal? That way no one there would steal his mail?


   I didn't even think of that, as i looked up from the conversation. I suppose it is possible. 


   Sam: I guess your probably right. I was just asking you if you knew anything about it.

   Charlie: Yeah man no problem. That address is the only thing bothering me though. Like something that's out of place. Well I'll see ya tomorrow ok Sam?

   Sam: Yeah, ttyl.

   As I slept that night I had a nightmare. I was walking into a house only it wasn't any that I recognized. 


   It was of a brownish yellow color. The paint looking like it was about gone from it. It smelled of pee and feces. I could see a dog chain at the side of it. No dog house though. 


  I tried to turn away but my feet didn't listen. They went up the creaking wooden steps that I was afraid one of my feet would fall through. 


   I looked down and saw I was holding a package. I couldn't see who it was but my hands uncontrollably went for the door and knocked. My heart started beating as i hear someone dragging there feet through the door. Please. I thought as I feel like I'm crying. Don't come any closer. 


   By the time the thing went to the door and started opening it I blacked out.


   I woke up that morning drenched in sweat as my whole bed felt wet. I then went and washed and dry my sheets as i took a shower. Who was it behind the door. I thought as I shivered. Hopefully I never know.


   That day work was going slow which I liked.  I went through all my deliveries fast and went and looked at the last one. My heart was buming in my chest so hard I thought I was going to have a heart attack.


   184 Evergreen Street.


   Right there. On another letter. Why I thought as I felt like I was about to cry. Why me again. 


   I went the treachorous journey through the trailers. What i saw as I went to the final street and turned shook me. There it was, that same mailbox. Only this time it had a chain link fence. The fence was rusty brown. No way, I thought. 


   Was the house in my dream trying to form itself? No, the fence wasn't even in the dream. Or, did I even noticed the fence the other day? 


   I delivered the letter again with the same terrible feelings I had the other day. Except today i ran faster. 


   I pushed so hard on the gas pedal of the mail van that I sped the tires. I'm pretty sure I made black marks on the road. I didn't even look back to check.


   When I got off work and went home I pulled up my computer. I tried every resource on the internet. I couldn't find nothing on 184 Evergreen Street.


   Why? I thought. Why would there be a street even though it doesn't exist. 


   That night I had the same dream. Except this time the fence was there. Also I was going slower. The dream was torturing me as I cried to be woken up. 


   I woke up again as the door creaked open in the dream. The sweat this time was bad. I washed the sheets and took another shower. "What the hell is going on?" I say to a God if there is one that will answer me.


   That day I told my manager that I was sick and she said I looked. She told me Charlie will drive the truck for me. I told her thank you and went back home. 


   I went back to my house. Made some hot chocolate and popcorn and turned on some Netflix and scrolled through Facebook. As the day went on I got a text message from Charlie.


   Charlie: Hey Sam? You know that street you were telling me about? Well you were right about it being creepy. When I went down there, there was a mailbox fence and what looks like a dog chain. 


   My whole body trembled in fear as i looked at that message. 


   what looked like a dog chain


  That means I was right about my suspicions. That horrid house from my dreams is showing up in reality. In 184 Evergreen Street. 


************************************************ 


   Well now that we are at the end of my story I'll say it's been a week now. My manager let me have the whole week off as I said it was family troubles. 


   What should I do? Charlie says there is a whole house on there now. It is drawing me to it. Tugging at me with an invisible rope. 


   I feel myself wanting to go out the door. Go back to the now real house. Make my last delivery.
