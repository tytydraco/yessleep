Chris sighed and shook his head at the mirror. “I look like a penguin.”

In the quiet confines of our tent, he stood before a cracked mirror we’d scrounged from an abandoned house, while the woodstove in the corner crackled merrily on its embers. It wasn’t much of a shelter, but it kept the cold away and we never had snow fall on us, so that was a plus. There was enough room for our crude bed, a simple bunk knocked together from scrap lumber bearing a mattress stuffed full of old rags. Our floor had been fashioned out of wooden pallets to hold everything off the frozen mud, and a rectangular pine chest contained most of our meager belongings. During the day, our homemade wood stove put out enough heat to keep the tent fairly warm, while at night it struggled to keep ice from forming on the tent poles. We were fortunate, I knew; there were still so many out there that had nothing, despite how hard our forces worked to put more old houses bac in working order. Chris wanted to wait until he was sure most of the general populace had somewhere to go before he arranged for our own home, and I’d grown used to sleeping under several blankets. With him by my side every night, snuggled by the glow of a fire, it wasn’t so bad.

*Though I won’t mind once we have a real door that can lock. And a fireplace. And a toilet.*

With gentle hands I straightened his tie, taking in the way the suit fit him like a glove. “No, you look *handsome.* It fits you. Very distinguished.”

“So, a very distinguished penguin then.” He let slide an ornery grin and pulled me to him, both calloused hands on my waist so that my spine tingled in pleasant shivers. “You sure you can’t come early? There’s got to be room enough on the helicopter for one more.”

*Tempting, Mr. Dekker, very tempting.*

I took his face in my hands to kiss him and savored how my brain fuzzed with happy static at the sensation. “I’ll be there once everything is set here. We still have to lay groundwork for the new perimeter wall and a food storage bunker. Then there’s taking measurements for the cabins, a watchtower and—hey!”

He lifted me from the ground to settle us both down amongst the tangled sheets of our bunk with mischievous gleam in his sky-blue eyes. I had barely a second to think before his lips were on mine again, a delicious warmth in my core that by now was a familiar and welcome feeling.

“You’re. . . you’re going to be late.” I gasped as he made his way down the soft skin of my neck, our hands in a blind race to undo belts and shirt buttons.

“A president is allowed to be late.” Chris whispered in my ear and cupped a hand behind my hip to keep me tight against his body. We were both still sore with bruises from the battle for the Western Pass, but time had helped to soothe most of the worst injuries. My ankle still hurt, and it would take longer to heal than I wanted, but I didn’t need to put much stress on it for this. Clearly my husband didn’t mind his new scars enough to care either.

Running my hands over the raised bits of skin that crisscrossed his muscled chest, I gave him a playful nibble on the shoulder, conscious to avoid where sutures held fresh wounds together. “You could tear those stiches.”

His energy only heightened by my teasing, Chris discarded the last bit of fabric that kept him at bay to pull the blankets over us in a soft cocoon of linen and wool. “If you want me to stop . . .”

*Don’t you dare.*

Unable to muster any words for the way his skin felt on mine, I laced my arms around his neck and happily gave up trying to dissuade him.

Twenty minutes later, we lay side-by-side in the thoroughly rumpled bed, his suit laid out in various discarded pieces on the nearby chair, my own nightshirt lost somewhere in the blankets. Thankfully, all bandages and sutures held, the stiffness in some of my wounds fading to a drowsy contentment. Chris tucked a thick fur coverlet over us, and I rested my tangled head against his chest, shutting my eyes to bask in the moment.

*Practice certainly makes perfect.*

“I still wish we could go together.” He stroked my hair, and Chris stared up at the tent ceiling with a grim line across his lips.

Spreading my fingers across his chest, I watched the short dark hairs flatten under my palm and chewed on my lower lip in thought. As the new president of the Free American Republic, Chris had many challenges on his hands. His first order of business had been to draft and sign into effect an official Constitution for our fledgling nation, one built off the principles of the original we’d grown up with in the U.S. With the Bill of Rights restored, curfews lifted, and market reforms implemented, Chris’s popularity soared amongst the surviving population. Many local businesses reopened, the streets were cleaned of rubble, and food shortages began to wane. A joint effort between the withdrawing ELSAR forces and our own soldiers had seen the power grid restored across Black Oak, and we managed to get the water mains back online. Sewage no longer flowed in the streets, and the number of disease patients in the hospital began to go down.

Still, our greatest accomplishment was, without a doubt, the new Constitution, and I myself had been among the delegates to sign the document. It had been one of the proudest days of my life to stand beside my husband as our dream became a reality, to see Chris’s eyes twinkle with hope for the future, and to walk out onto the courthouse lawn with him to greet the cheering crowds. We’d run up our new flag, red and white striped like the old one, but with a white pine tree in the blue square instead of fifty stars, and someone had even found a stash of old fireworks to shoot off in celebration.

However, like all things, it was not a bloodless victory. With the relaxing of political suppression, the new two-house Assembly had formed ideological blocs that began to look eerily like political parties. Our own Reformists, led by Chris, made up roughly 2/3 of the total government, but a rival group of former collaborators known as the Provincials proved to be a thorn in our side. They refused to sign the new Constitution until Chris promised amnesty to most former Auxiliaries in return for a guarantee of Provincial support in reconstruction. This had in turn enraged many of the former resistance members, who splintered into other factions; most went to the Independents, but sadly a large number defected to the United Liberation Front.

Formed by Josh and his insurgent comrades, the ULF demanded the total removal of all former collaborator families from Barron County by force, the execution of all Auxiliaries and Organ members, and the handing of military authority in Black Oak to ULF forces. All efforts to negotiate with them failed, and when the Assembly refused to allow them representation in both House and Senate due to their aggressive tactics, the ULF denounced our government as illegitimate. They carried out three separate car bomb attacks on our security units in Black Oak and tried to vandalize warehouse where our aid was stored in order to prevent it from reaching the poorer districts. Chris had officially declared them a terrorist organization which meant that, in a strange twist of fate, our troops ended up patrolling alongside the last of the ELSAR soldiers before the latter’s withdrawal to keep the bloodshed at a minimum. While there were multiple ULF attacks to investigate, my scouts reported having trouble with an unidentified sniper who harassed our police units without end, and I dreaded the day I would look down my rifle sights to find Lucille staring back at me. We had won the war, but it seemed true peace would continue to elude us for quite some time.

Still, not all was dark in the road ahead. As the Secretary of Human Welfare for Chris’s cabinet, Sandra Abernathy worked night and day to restore medical services within the town and acted as an envoy to the most impoverished districts in order to gain their support for further reforms. Ethan Sanderson won over the working class with ease, mediating between them and local business owners for pay, benefits, and improved conditions, thus avoiding multiple strikes. He’d wanted to go back to being a simple mechanic, but Chris eventually convinced him to accept the role of Vice President, for which Ethan turned out to be well suited. Black Oak University had been renamed the Carheim Institute, and with a book donation campaign from surviving residents, the old library was brought back to its former glory. I had a painting of Professor Carheim done by one of his former apprentices from the underground, and it hung just inside the entrance along with an inscription in old Latin that read, ‘Those who reach for the light of truth have no need to fear the darkest of lies.’

The real surprise came when one of the newspapers, a Provincial-friendly one no less, ran a story about our soldiers protecting civilians from reprisals during the siege of Black Oak.

In a shock to me, one of the interviewees happened to mention my name, and somehow a picture of me running down the street during the northern district massacre appeared in one of the local magazines, likely taken from a refugee that had been hidden in the bombed-out houses. Just like that, I went from a secondary figure in the new government to a pseudo-celebrity, and my face appeared on pro-reconstruction posters all over the city. Stylists copied the golden streaks in my hair for dozens of girls, tattoo artists ran out of silver ink due to sheer demand, and it got to where I was more worried about being mobbed by fans than attacked by insurgents every time I went anywhere. I found that I hated being so famous, unable to move about in town without an armed escort, but it did come in handy with the one project other I led inside the walls of Black Oak.

At the center of town, in the same square so many had been killed during the fighting, I had a temporary wooden pillar erected in place of a stone one that would replace it in future, once our quarries were operational. Onto this pillar, I carved the names of all the recovered coalition dog tags and captured ELSAR ID cards I had, along with every single name in Kaba’s little black book. He was given the place of honor at the top, *Adrit Veer Kabanagarajan*, along with *Andrea Louise Campbell,* and *Sean Fredrick Hammond*. Without any records as to his real name, I put *Tex* there as well, knowing he wouldn’t have wanted much spotlight anyway. I invited everyone from all sides in the Assembly to the opening ceremony and gave them the chance to write down the name of a loved one they would like to see etched onto the pillar. It didn’t matter who they were, which side they were on, or why they had died; the pillar was for everyone, for all the lost souls who hadn’t lived through the nightmare we’d barely survived. I called it Remembrance Square, and never a day went by that there wasn’t some kind of wreath, bouquet, or candle left at its base by a grieving family. It wasn’t much, but as Chris assured me, it was the first in a long series of steps towards healing.

“I’ll be there before dark.” I curled one leg around him and clung to Chris’s torso with both arms to soak in the heat radiating off his chiseled frame. “Once I know New Wilderness is secure for the night, I’ll come find you. I promise.”

He planted a tender kiss on my forehead. “I’ll hold you to that. First Ladies need to keep their promises. Besides, once the new road is paved, we can move the presidential residence out here and avoid the traffic altogether.”

That drew a smile from me, both in the thought of living closer to the reserve, and at the idea that our cozy little farm wasn’t so far in the future. “Not sold on being an urbanite, huh?”

“My grandfather had it right.” Chris rubbed my shoulder and stared upward through the green canvas ceiling in thought. “A sturdy house, a good piece of land, and a beautiful family is more than enough in this life. Once my term is up, I figure if you won’t mind helping me build the house, I can get us the land, and then maybe we can work on that last part some more.”

*I think we’re well past ‘maybe’, Mr. Dekker.*

My face heated up, and I kept both eyes on his satin-steel chest to avoid giving my giddy smile away. “I’d like that.”

We lay there for another few minutes, before my battered alarm clock rang to inform us that he was, in fact, late. Together we rose to repeat the dressing process, and I shrugged on my new uniform, eyeing the golden stars on the collar in the nearby mirror.

With the war over, and the bulk of the coalition army disbanded, those who didn’t want a place in the budding government went their separate ways. Adam and Eve returned with the remainder of their brethren to Ark River, where Eve made sure her recovering husband got his rest, whether Adam felt he needed it or not. Their patrols continued to round up Puppets in order to redeem them via sunlight, though multiple Arkian women discovered they were pregnant shortly after the Breach’s collapse, and fresh marriages continued in their enclave by the day. Many of the original population of Barron County stayed in Ark River, while others traveled west to join the growing flock of people looking to reconquer the gated community near Sunbright. Some moved to Black Oak, but a few dared to venture out into the wild, with hopes of building their own fortified blockhouses, miniature settlements, or farming strongholds in the vast unclaimed lands of the countryside. Untainted by the continuous influence of the Breach, the landscape stabilized, and the tide of mutants slowed. Now it was time for mankind to do what we did best; regroup, rearm, and take back our home.

“Morning, Mr. President; the transport flight is ready at the landing pad, awaiting your orders.” As we emerged from the military surplus tent, a green-uniformed ranger came up and saluted us both. “Commander Dekker, we’ve got a supply convoy that just came in, and the captain asked where you wanted the radios to go?”

It took a moment for me to remember that he was addressing *me*, and I nodded toward the line of vehicles parked on the other side of the ridge, where bulldozers rumbled back and forth to smooth out the shell craters. “Talk to Head Ranger McPhearson. Tell him I’ll be helping with the wall construction detail this afternoon, before my flight to the capitol this evening. He’ll be briefed before I leave.”

“Yes, commander.” The boy saluted again and took off at a run.

I turned to find Chris watching me with a toothy smile. “What?”

He shook his head and slipped one hand into mine as we walked. “I do *not* miss my old post.”

“And I do *not* envy your current one.” Leaning on him to keep the weight off my sore ankle, I strode with Chris down the newly bladed road between the tents, snowflakes tumbling around us. Our medics had provided me with a cane to use until the wound healed, but while I carried it even now, I hated using the thing. It made me feel old, and I couldn’t wait until I didn’t need the creaking stick anymore. “Those Assembly sessions drive me crazy. I don’t know how you get through them without wanting to shoot someone.”

“Trust me, it’s crossed my mind.” Chris’s face dimmed somewhat, and he let out a long sigh. “But I think once enough time passes, the old problems will sort themselves out. Our first civil war didn’t end us, and we had a lot more to deal with this time around.”

Pacing through the camp, we looked on in mute thought at the fervent construction that bustled all around us. Crews worked tirelessly to operate heavy equipment, lay gravel, and haul logs to their various positions. Unlike the old New Wilderness, this one would be larger, encompassing the entire hill the reserve originally sat on, with rings of palisade walls guarding it from base to crest. Once the spring came, we planned to pour cement foundations and bring in large stone blocks from the local quarry, replacing the wooden fort with a stone castle that would outlast us all. It would serve both as a conservation center for the animal species that roamed our newborn republic, and as a command post for our peacetime military, of which I was now chief officer. Some of the structures being rebuilt were given their old names: Carnivore Cove, the Fur and Fang Veterinary Center, the Herbivore Barns. It was with a strange combination of melancholy and closure that I observed the workers raise framed walls on the central barracks, which bore the name “Elk Lodge.” In truth, it would be closer to a medieval keep by the time it was done properly in stone next spring. Part of me would always miss the old rustic lodge, where Chris and I shared our first dance, our first kiss, and our first clumsy attempt at a dinner date. It would never truly be the same . . . but then again, none of this would be. We were about to pass into a different world, a different time, and everything was once again going to change.

Reaching the helicopter pad, a flattened part of the small ridge where a Blackhawk waited, Chris stopped to adjust his tie in the way he always did before going into another heated Assembly meeting. “I’ll see you tonight, then?”

My heart skipped a fluttery beat, and I took the lapels of his suit in my hands to kiss the boy who dug me out of the moldy pile of shoes all those nights ago. “I guarantee it.”

Chris rested his forehead against mine and bore into my eyes with his. “I love you, *pragtige*.”

“And I love you, *aantreklik*.” I held him tight, satisfied at the way my rough attempt at Afrikaans made him smile. “Be safe.”

A part of my heart twinged as the helicopter whirred off to the north, but I hefted the rifle on my shoulder and made for the front gate. There, a small caravan waited for me, made up of riders on horses, bicycles, motorcycles, and a few wagons drawn by oxen. Every saddlebag bulged with supplies, the wagons piled high with everything the group might need. Tools, provisions, water, medicine, no expense had been spared. Such extravagances would be unheard of tomorrow, the first day Barron County would wake up in a new reality, cut off from ELSAR’s mandated contributions.

*But it’s not tomorrow yet.*

At my approach, a rather conspicuous figure jumped down from the lead wagon to make a sweeping bow.

“Didn’t expect you to be up, commander. Thought you decided to take the morning off.” Even with his broad hat in one hand, head bent in dramatic flair, I could still see the wry grin on Peter’s face. “Though by the look of the president’s suit, you almost did, eh?”

“Something like that.” I chuckled as he righted himself and eyed the pirate’s revitalized getup. “I like the hat.”

Peter again wore the long-tailed coat, knee-high boots, and gleaming silver rapier of a 17^(th) century buccaneer, adding a tricorn hat that someone found atop his bandana-wrapped head. A single feather poked from its silken band, and with the dark stubble lining his thin face, Peter certainly looked roguish enough to appear in a movie set somewhere. One piece of his kit was not for mere appearances, however. Over his left eye, Peter now sported a black eyepatch, the long red scar extended from either side denoting where Grapeshot’s cutlass had made its mark. Our medics tended to it the best they could, but Peter knew as well as they did that he would never see with his left eye again. Still, it hadn’t dampened his spirits.

If anything, it made him more of a rascal than ever.

Behind him, the last of those who were going south lounged on their various mounts, talking or sipping on hot coffee provided by the camp mess. In a shrewd political maneuver, Chris used the Provincials’ amnesty demand for the Organs as a loophole to waive the life sentence for Peter and his crew. Officially free men, they were granted letters of marque as privateers of the F.A.R Naval Forces. Granted, they were the *only* naval force we had, but Peter had accepted the task before the Assembly with great charm, stirring more than one adoring newspaper article written by swooning girls. Set to return to the *Harper’s Vengeance*, they would patrol the Sea of Sargosia (formerly Maple Lake) on behalf of our government, ferrying settlers to abandoned farm sites or protecting researchers while they studied mutant migrations. As well, they would aid in keeping any form of banditry off our waters, especially since a large portion of ex-Organ members had elected to leave Black Oak and move into the countryside for fear of the ULF. Many orphans volunteered to join him when Peter opened a recruitment line in the local pub, and they all looked forward to a new life on our growing inland sea.

One face in particular stuck out of the caravan, and I limped over to crane my neck at the silent figure atop the lead wagon’s seat. “Hey, you. All ready to go?”

Tarren didn’t say anything, but nodded, twisted a few thin strands of vine in her fingers to form knots. She hadn’t very much spoken since the Breach, and never smiled, a quiet shadow of the girl I’d met in the hold of the *Harper’s Vengeance.* It hurt to see, and I knew Peter was most affected by it, though he tried not to let the pain show. Of anyone, Tarren was least deserving of what she had endured, but the war had shown no favoritism to anyone.

*Curse Vecitorak and his filthy rotten soul.*

I rested my elbows on the wagon’s side and made a conspiratorial whisper in a bid to cheer her up. “I heard they’ve got an ice cream shop set to open in Black Oak. I’ll bring some with me when I come to visit, and we can eat crunchy cones together. Maybe after, you can take a trip here and pet a mammoth. They’re like elephants, but fuzzier. Sound good?”

The girl chewed her lower lip, but bobbed her head in agreement, and continued to tie knots in silence.

“Okay.” Somewhat disappointed, I turned to go, but to my surprise, a little jerk on my sleeve halted my steps.

Tarren held her arms out for a hug, and I didn’t deny her.

“I don’t sleep good.” Her whisper in my ear broke my heart, raspy from disuse and fatigue.

*I know the feeling.*

Rubbing her back, I held her tight, and felt a sympathetic wince cross my face. “Nightmares?”

She nodded, skinny fingers gripping my uniform epaulets like they were lifelines.

“I have them too.” I kissed her hair and wished I could keep the little thing with me, though I knew she was better off with her crew . . . her family. “But you want to know a secret?”

Tarren looked at me with watery eyes, on the edge of tears that she’d likely shed a thousand times already. Few could know what she’d been through, the feeling of the roots burrowing inside her skin the pain, the whispers in her mind. I had been fortunate never to fully succumb to the infection, but she had spent hours, days, weeks in the clutches of the Oak Walker’s growth. Still, I knew how it felt, and in that way, we were closer than sisters, bonded in memories too horrible to forget. I wouldn’t let her trod that path alone.

Leaning close, I produced a little wooden pendant I’d carved from a chunk of pine, crude and angular, but sanded smooth enough to prevent splinters. It was a lantern, a tiny wooden lantern with the inside of the vault painted with gold to stand in for a flame. While I didn’t get much down time, there were moments of darkness for me too, nights when I woke up in a cold sweat, or brief instants of panic that hit me out of nowhere in random places. Thanks to helping Chris with a new batch of miniatures for his Christmas outreach program, carving had become my nervous tick in those times, and I didn’t know why, but my mind always went back to that golden lantern, shining in the night. Like the one I’d seen in a different place, held by different hands, perhaps this too would help guide Tarren home.

“Whenever you can’t sleep.” I handed her the pendant and closed her little fingers over it. “Light a candle and hold this tight as you can. When you do, I want you to say one thing to yourself, out loud, until you feel better again.”

Her face contorted in a mix of hope and confusion, Tarren waiting for the necessary words that must have sounded like a magic recipe to her young mind.

Seeing a pair of gentle silver irises in my mind, I rubbed one thumb over the little girl’s cheek to wipe the tears away. “*You have no idea how loved you are*.”

I had to her repeat it back to me until Tarren could say it without stumbling over the words. She thanked me with another hug, and it took a superhuman force of willpower just to walk away. However, when I looked back over my shoulder, Tarren was peering at the lantern in her hands, lips moving with the silent mantra, eyes filled with something like hope.

*He can hear you, Tarren. He’s right there. Just look closer.*

As we walked to the front of the lineup, Peter glanced at me out of the corner of his one good eye. “You sure ya don’t need us to stick around for a few more days? Me and the lads don’t mind the heavy liftin.”

“The snow’s going to get deeper the longer we wait.” I thumped along with my cane, a bittersweet frown on my face as we stopped next to the poles that would soon become our main gate. “I’m sure the *Harper’s Vengeance* will need repairs before she can put to sea again, and the roads from here to there won’t be easy. Chris and I will come visit as soon as we can.”

“I’ll have to build a spare room in the fort then.” Peter rested his hand on the hilt of Grace’s rapier, the ornate sword hanging from his hip, and I noted how calm he seemed. The old weariness, torment, and sadness were long gone, and Peter gobbled up the morning sunshine with hungry eyes. He was ready, ready for a fresh start, a new life.

*Hopefully a long and happy one.*

“You know, I never did ask.” Staring out alongside him onto the white, snow-covered hills around us, I rested both hands on my cane for support. “You last name . . . what is it?”

“Nelson.” He smirked, and Peter made a modest shrug. “Peter G. Nelson. Honestly never had much use for it, ‘specially once I turned pirate; imagine a pirate named Nelson.”

“Maybe not a pirate.” I raised one eyebrow and recalled something Chris had told me once during our early dates at New Wilderness. “But there was a famous admiral by that name. Even had a statue of him put up in Britain somewhere.”

“Ya don’t say?” Peter’s good eye twinkled in wonder. “Well, I suppose I’ll have to read up on that, if we ever find more books. The crew could use some new stories . . . who knows, maybe I’ll try and write one for them.”

“I look forward to reading a copy.” At my wave, the rest of his caravan mounted up, and I met Peter’s eye one last time. “Fair sailing to you, Captain Nelson.”

Mounting his own horse at the front of the wagons, Peter tipped his hat with a cavalier grin and tossed one of my uniform collar pins to me that I hadn’t realized was missing. “Until next time, Commander Dekker.”

Alone, I trudged back through the camp to a quiet spot on the eastern edge of the hilltop. Here a small cherry tree had survived the ELSAR barrage that destroyed the rest of its brethren in the artisanal grove, and with most people a fair distance off, I sat down on a large stone dumped by our earth-moving crew.

Placing my rifle to one side, I slid the camera strap off my shoulder and set up a small tripod one of the mechanics fashioned for me. I popped in the last SD card I had, two plastic containers full of them in my camera case and positioned the lens to face me.

My thumb hit *record,* and I sat back on the stone to clear my throat. “So, um . . . this is going to be my last video. I want to state for the record that I am not suicidal, this is not a death note, and I am in good health. This is . . . well, this is me saying goodbye.”

A hard wave of emotion hit me at that word, and I had to blink back the mixed feelings as I thought of what I was doing.

*Focus, Hannah. This is important. You can do this, you have to.*

“Everything you need to know should be recorded in the memory cards.” Staring at the tiny image of myself in the side screen, I looked back into the dark lens, holding up a stack of papers, notebooks, and files. “Along with a complete roster of the accounts collected by Professor Carheim. I also had one of the girls at the university transcribe my recordings on one of the computers we got shipped in during ELSAR’s last aid convoy, so everything is in paper form too. There should be two sets of each in the box.”

Cold wind blew a light dusting of snowflakes over my shoulder, and I watched them dance across the scene before me. They were beautiful, clean and white, as if washing away the scars of the old world. Somehow, they made me feel stronger, and I pushed myself onward.

“If you’re watching this, then you know what to do.” I nodded at the camera, as if I were speaking directly to the person I would entrust the dossier to. “The memory cards I will go to my parents, Allen and Margerie Brun, along with one of the transcript copies. As agreed, you keep one of the paper copies of everything, and you can post or publish them however you see fit, just so long as the truth is told. I’m counting on you, so . . . please, don’t let me down.”

One of the Smugglers from the old resistance, a man who had distinguished himself in the war, had sworn he could slip across the border before the Breach took us. Due to our agreement with ELSAR, we had forbidden such things, but I secretly agreed to let this man go, if he did me one very special favor. I had remembered a contact on the other side, an old acquaintance that knew me from a summer job in my high school days, and one I was confident would be trustworthy. In return for getting both packages to this special contact, the Smuggler and his family would be escorted to the border and snuck through the ELSAR checkpoints to freedom. Then, my old coworker would hopefully do as I asked and send one of the packets to my parents, before posting everything he’d been given online. By the time ELSAR reacted, it would be too late, and the world would know the truth. Most would laugh it off, many dismiss it as mere fiction, but some would believe, and that was enough. Koranti wouldn’t be able to hide forever, and mankind would have a chance, if a slim one, to fight back. It was a risky gamble, but I’d made worse decisions than that before.

*We’ll be ancient history by tomorrow anyway.*

Looking at my hands, I drew a deep, shuddery breath, and tried not to envision how much blood they had shed. “Now, I want to speak directly to my mom and dad.”

My heart beat a thousand miles a minute, as if they would step out from behind the camera to surprise me, but I straightened up and thought of their loving faces. “If you’ve watched the other videos, or read the transcript, then you’ve heard my story up to now. As much as it seems like some crazy hoax, as much as you’ll want to believe it’s all fake, please, trust what I’ve told you. I am alive, and I’m safe.”

A tear managed to crest my left eyelid, but I brushed it away stubbornly. “I wish you could have met Chris. I know you would have liked him, Dad. He would have been so nervous to meet you, but I think you would have gotten along. He’s good to me, kind, gentle. He reminds me of you, sometimes.”

Still the feelings rose in my throat, tried to choke me, and I fought not to sob. “Mom, I . . . I miss you. There’s a video from our wedding in one of the SD cards, I guess someone had a working camera and thought to record it all. I know we didn’t always get along, but I hope I made you proud. I wouldn’t be who I am if it weren’t for you. I know we’ll see each other again someday, even if not the way you’d want.”

Pain, old and familiar at this point, grew in my chest, a coarse sensation that wanted to stifle me. I couldn’t let it. This was too important. I had to carry on, to finish this.

They had to be told.

*Give me strength, Adonai.*

“I love you both, more than you could ever know.” I squeezed my eyes shut, and my voice cracked as hot salty waves rolled down my cheeks. “I always will. That’s why I wanted to make this recording just for you, because you deserve to know something.”

Across my face came a smile, a real smile, one that burst with the secret whispered to me in the sunlit meadows of Tauerpin Road. “You’re going to be grandparents. I know, it should be too soon to tell, but let’s just say I have it on good authority. I haven’t told Chris yet, I want to surprise him. If it’s a boy, I’d like to name him Rodrick, after Chris’s grandfather. If it’s a girl . . .”

The breeze rustled my hair, sending strands of brown and gold twirling before my eyes. Despite the winter chill, it almost seemed warm, as if from a distant summer memory, and I glanced down at the rifle by my side. While heavier than my old Type 9, the Kalashnikov gleamed under a thin coat of oil, scuffed and scratched, but reliable. Across the ground in front of me, dozens upon dozens of picture frames stood amongst the snow, staked into the ground under the cherry tree with a multitude of smiling faces. They had been copied at the university by one of the few remaining printers, encased in laminate to guard against the weather. Names were painted on the frames under each, and the one closest to me bore a man and a girl with similar facial features. Their bleach-blonde hair played in the sunlight, their uniform shirts boasting ‘New Wilderness Wildlife Reserve’ on the pocket, and tucked into the frame alongside it, was our picture.

*Man, that cake was good, wasn’t it? I never danced so much in my whole life. The dress you got me was so beautiful too . . .*

Laughing as I wept, I let grief mingle with joy until both melded into a torrent of feeling, not painful so much as grateful. Perhaps someday I would grow old so that the places, times, and dates faded into obscurity, but a part of me knew I could never forget the ones who guided me here.

Here, where I was always meant to be.
