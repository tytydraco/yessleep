It’s been a long time since I posted. If you forget about me and the rise and fall of the town I used to live, [you can read about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/d3yj52/i_live_in_a_town_full_of_serial_killers_someone/).

I’d been a wolf in sheep’s clothing for so long that I convinced myself I really was a sheep, but after years of torment living as a citizen, I finally snapped. 

A motorist cut me off on the highway and had the audacity to give me the finger. He was a young man in a pinstripe suit driving a Lexus. I could see him laughing through the car window as he flicked me off.

A long-buried rage bubbled over. I knew the man thought he was better than me. That I deserved the ridicule he gave me. 

I followed him to his fancy house on a fancy block. Entering through an unlocked window on the second floor, I made sure he’d never laugh again.

The blood poured through my fingers and I felt alive again. A river that had run dry was now a raging torrent of water — the old me had returned with a vengeance.

Riffling through the dead asshole's pockets, I snagged his keys and hopped into the Lexus. Sending my wife a series of disparaging text messages, I floored the accelerator and peeled off into the night. My family would never see me again — good riddance.

Slaughtersburg had been destroyed by the Zodiac. His murderous rampage against his own kind had left it burning. His maniac army of children decimated the other killers — but I was determined to bring it back. He’d bested me in every way, but the blood had reinvigorated me. Not only would I bring the town back, but I’d also hunt down Zodiac and his followers. I wouldn’t just kill them, I’d make them wish they never lived.

On the drive to Wyoming, my blood lust rose. I made several stops to quench it. Those unlucky enough to stumble across my path were left rotting in the dirt. The closer I got to Slaughtersburg the stronger my urge to kill became. Everything the Zodiac had stolen from me started to return. I was a dark phoenix rising from the ashes.

After days of driving, and countless bodies left in my wake, the town finally came into view. It was burnt husk. Almost every building had been burned to the ground; skeletons of timber and brick. All that was left standing was the General Store. Behind the store were dozens of unkempt graves marked with a wooden cross emblazoned with the symbol of the Zodiac. Even in death, he claimed ownership over them.

Despite the death and destruction, I saw endless opportunities. The town was a fresh slate. I’d attract new residents and serve as their leader. Nothing would stop me, and if the Zodiac or his children returned, they’d rue the day.

A crescent moon rose in the sky. With its pale light bearing down, I grabbed my supplies and sleeping bag and brought them into the store. For now, it would serve as my home base. I fell into a comfortable slumber. What others called nightmares I called sweet dreams — and I had them for the first time in years.

I awoke in the middle of the night to the sound of a car engine revving loudly. I ran to the window and watched the Lexus speed off into the distance.

Booming footsteps surrounded the store. A loud groan echoed from the darkness. I wasn’t frightened, I’d expected this. Zodiac had kept tabs on me before and I assumed he had eyes everywhere. Clutching a rifle I’d brought with me, I tip-toed towards the front window and slightly pulled back the curtain.

A huge figure darted across the porch. Without hesitation, I unloaded several rounds. My aim was immaculate and I struck them with every shot. Whoever they were collapsed on the porch. Silence engulfed the night again.

Carefully, I stepped outside to examine the body. A stench of rotting flesh hit me like a ton of bricks — a smell serial killers know all too well. Most found it putrid, but I found it comforting.

The body was massive and was laid out on its stomach. I could tell it was an older male, maybe 6’3 and well over 300 pounds. Keeping an eye out for other attackers, I struggled to roll him over. After several tries, I was successful.

“What in the fuck?” I muttered to myself.

I recognized that face. In fact, I’d know him well — but he’d been dead for years. It was John AKA the Cincinnati Maniac, one of the first victims of the Zodiac’s rampage. His skin was rotting away, flesh and muscle peeking through the skin. I pulled up his shirt and found the phrases carved into his chest all that time ago were still present — but they’d decayed along with his body.

All of a sudden, his left arm started to convulse. I backed away and gripped my gun. Something was wrong, very wrong. A banshee-like scream escaped his lips and John jumped to his feet. Bathed in the moonlight, I could see that he was a rotting corpse — but somehow moving. His eyes were milky white, teeth missing, and skin was too tight for his massive frame. He charged, wailing like the maniac he was. Before he could reach me, I put three rounds into his head.

The bullets blew the top of his head off, and he slumped into the dirt still twitching. Heart racing, I flew into the store and barricaded all of the doors. I gathered my weapons and waited. For the rest of the night, I didn’t sleep a wink. I paced around the different rooms, ready to defend myself — but nothing else ever came.

When the dawn finally broke, I ventured outside. John’s body was gone. Muddy footprints covered the ground, crisscrossing back and forth.

The makeshift cemetery had been ransacked. Tire marks were everywhere and three of the graves had been dug up. It was a mess.

As I headed back inside to gather my thoughts, I spied a trail of blood leading to the back of the store. Scrawled sloppily on the wood siding was a message.

“Welcome back. We’ve been dying to see you again."
