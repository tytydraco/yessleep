The dream I had that night was the same as the first. I was trapped in an endless loop in those woods, eventually stalked by an unseen creature, and I woke up after it caught me. 

I woke up with a scream, to be specific. 

My mother came rushing in. 

“What’s wrong Baby?” Yes, I was still called her Baby at nine, no that would not change with any number of years thereafter. 

“I was still in the woods!” I wailed. I couldn’t think of a better way to say it. I still can’t. 

“It’s okay, Baby. You’re not in the woods. You’re home.” She tried to comfort me, pulling me into a tight hug. “What happened in there? Was there anybody else in there with you?”

“No. Not people. Just the thing. But I couldn’t see it.” 

A few years later, I would come to understand the significance behind her attempt to gently prod out if a human attacker was the source of my unusually traumatized reaction. 

Instead, my answer seemed to leave her still concerned but mostly placated that it was just an unusually strong nightmare.

Life continued as normal for a while. I never fully forgot the incident. But, it’s hard for even something pretty bad to fully keep a nine year old down.

I do think it made me even more of an introvert, just more distance between me and the world. It wasn’t huge, certainly. I would say I was basically normal, and the nightmares were gone, I hoped for good. 

That wasn’t to be.

The next incident happened months later. School had let out and come back again. I have never been responsible about switching my schedule around and planning around getting a good night's sleep.

One night, just after going back to school from summer break, I got determined to push through winning a video game. I had been floundering on the final fight for days. So, it was time to set in and do it. 

Those digital cambion twins humiliated me for hours, and hours more. By the time I finished, it was so far past late that the moment I crawled into bed, literally the very next moment the alarm went off pulling me up. 

I’m sure you don’t even need to imagine how exhausted I was. At that age, it wasn’t the constant dragging aches and exhaustion I feel now. I mostly could still pull through the day, but with fits of sleepiness hitting at the most unexpected moments. 

That was what got me.

I was sitting in one of my classes. Not so surprisingly, I couldn’t possibly tell you which subject it was. What I know is that only a few minutes in, I passed out. 

I didn’t even need to open my eyes. I smelled the rotting leaves. I felt the dirt encrusting my body. I was in my own personal hell yet again. 

I was in the woods. 

It is hard for me to put the emotions I felt at that moment to words. The sheer existential dread that shook my body was devastating. I knew, in the deepest parts of my soul, that I had always been there. No matter how many months passed, I had never left those woods. 

Eventually, I pushed myself up and looked around. I didn’t need to look at myself to know that I was the same age, in the same clothes as I was then. I mean that not just because it made sense. No, somehow I was the same child who had gotten lost in those woods. The time since was the hazy and indistinct part. 

I tried to reject that nightmare. I kept my eyes clenched shut. I cried until I had no tears left to shed. But the woods never changed. 

Eventually, I stood up and walked. Resigned, but still terrified, I made no attempt to keep or choose any path. I knew it didn’t matter. I just needed to endure whatever the forest had in store for me. 

The woods became dark much faster than before. It was as if it knew that it needed to change how it would torment me as I no longer held hope of just walking out. 

The trees oppressively narrowed around me, trapping me tightly in what was almost a maze. Eventually, I could only follow the paths which split and formed ahead of me as the trees were so grown together that I could not push off-course even if I wanted to. 

The way the trees transformed into a great wall of wooden flesh unsettled me. Branch veins and leaf hair blended into a hellish picture on the canvas of nature. 

I heard it coming. 

The rustling of leaves came first. Then I could make out the stomping of feet. 

I ran. You have to remember, I was still a child, not meaningfully older than when I first found those woods. How was I supposed to deal with that? Panic pushed me forward. I knew well enough from last time that it could cause pain. 

The forest canopy above me melted into blackness. The wall of trees looked like a stretched sheet of wooden skin. Only the forest floor remained oddly normal. 

A stench like burnt skin assaulted my nose. I could sense it getting near me. This time, it didn’t grab me in one fell swoop like before. Instead, many hands raked across my back and arms, weakly grasping me. I continued to struggle to run, but gradually the hands pulled me to the ground. 

Thrashing and screaming, I struggled to break free of their grasp…

-

I fell out of my desk. 

Every set of eyes in that classroom was on me. As far as anyone watching could see, I had just shrieked and flung myself out of my desk. 

“What’s wrong?” Being in elementary school, the question was far more concerned than annoyed. 

“Where-?” Slowly, the memory of where I actually was came back to me. 

“Come on. You’re going to see the nurse.”

I was promptly taken away. Understandably, the teacher wanted to offload the problem before a room full of elementary children went out of control.

I did actually explain my problem to the nurse. That got me an appointment with counselors. I would have loved it if an adult could have given me answers. 

Instead, after thorough questioning about my home life, I got my mother called about my “nightmare problem” and nothing more to show for it.

I knew my problems ran deeper though. These were not dreams. Having another incident so far detached from my trip into that forest made me certain of it. 

I shouldn’t have been capable of feeling every sensation, seeing every detail, and thinking with total clarity in a dream. No dream feels that real. 

That incident left me with no ability to pretend that this was a single freak accident. Something had happened in those woods, and it wasn’t going to just leave me behind. 

I was too young to do anything about it though. I felt powerless. So I did what I had to: I lived with it.
