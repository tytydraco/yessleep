I guess I’m writing this to put my mind at ease… I’ve never written in any sort of journal before, but I guess now there’s some sort of record of what happened to me at least. That is if there’s anyone left to read this.

Last year the clouds came. Humanity gazed upward as dense red formations accumulated above us. Immediately, people took it as a sign of the end times but were quickly dismissed as the rain the clouds produced didn’t have any distinguishing qualities. It was just rain.

No blood fell from the sky, no acid, and no concoction turning us into horrible monsters from a 1980’s horror flick. The rain seemed to be harmless, and the clouds were gone the next day.

The news just echoed the reports that “meteorologists and experts were ‘stumped’” at what caused the clouds to appear or why they were colored in such an odd way. It turned into a meme for about a month, and everyone had all but forgotten them by the end of last summer.

Around the end of the year, however, as all of the leaves started falling off the trees and plant life began to wither away for the winter, bright red spherical flowers roughly the size of tennis balls began sprouting where fields of grass and forests had been before. Everywhere you went you could see these flowers bloom.

Folks quickly started making the connection to the red clouds, and statements by world governments advised everyone to avoid the flowers as best they could, as more research was necessary before a conclusion could be made. Panic started to set in from the masses.

Conspiracy theorists claimed this was planned by our governments and the flowers would produce spores that would make us more subservient. The religious claimed it was a sign of end times and to prepare for the second coming. Others claimed it was extraterrestrials taking their first step in terraforming our planet for their incoming invasion.

Maybe they all had some sort of truth. Maybe they all couldn’t be further from it. I still don’t know. The media and our elected officials stayed quiet, which of course didn’t help the ever-growing theories on the matter and the government's involvement.

Around December, the flowers were blooming everywhere you looked. Entire countrysides were now painted red with the sprawling vines and buds of these flowers. The new plant life began overtaking all other flora wherever they grew, like an extremely aggressive invasive species.

Finally, our governments couldn’t slap band-aid statements on this ever-growing phenomenon anymore. Task forces were dispatched and began burning operations to remove the flowers, but for every square mile burned, ten more would just as quickly turn bright red with the flowers’ bloom.

Things started turning more insidious once herbivores started eating the flowers as their normal food sources were all but snuffed out. The herbivores who ate the flowers had a rapid change in demeanor and would quickly run to find a secluded place where they would lie still for days before a guaranteed demise.

Predators and scavengers took advantage of the easy meal, only to meet the same fate. Insects, fungus, worms, and bacteria would all consume the body like they had done for their entire genetic history, and then they too would wither and die.

As farming became impossible and the cattle and livestock either died out or became malnourished, food shortages became our next problem. Many died in riots and famine over the next few months. I guess they were the lucky ones…

I had been dealing with the recent death of my mother, who lived in a farmhouse in the countryside of Virginia. My father passed away years ago, which left the house to me. Looking back, I’m appreciative that they didn’t have to witness what was to come.

I wanted to sell the property, but obviously, no one had buying a house on their mind at a time like this. After receiving an alert to stay indoors on my cell phone, I decided to return to my old home near Washington, D.C., thinking it would be safer.

I arrived in February to my childhood home covered in bright crimson red. I had grown somewhat accustomed to the world being covered in red by this point, but I’d be lying if it didn’t bring me sadness to see the property in this state.

Likewise, the chickens and cattle my parents had raised were all gone… A few of their bodies lay rotting, cloaked in red decay by the edge of the forest behind the house.

Days, weeks, and months passed. I spent my time watching the news and tried to stock up on as much food and supplies as I could. The nights became quiet. I’d go days without even seeing a car drive down the road. 

I started to feel as though something was watching me in the darkness of the night, just outside the tree line where the moon could not reflect the red glow of the flowers in the fields. I attributed it to solitude and paranoia but I could never shake the feeling.

I've always been one to prefer being alone. I worked for a small tech company that didn't require us to go into any office so outside of the occasional zoom meeting here and there I never really talked to anyone. I never thought I'd miss being around others as much as I did at this time. 

April arrived, and the temperature started to rise with it. I think we had all been secretly hoping these red flowers were simply a seasonal phenomenon and would die in concession with our normal plant life returning in the spring.

It never happened. In fact, the red flowers just grew ever more dense, and in late April, they began producing their own form of some twisted pollen. You couldn’t see more than five feet in front of you on a bright spring day.

The smell it produced was like that of both iron and sulfur and left a rancid taste in your mouth. The news began calling this red pollen the “Red Murk.”

On the third night of the new bloom is when I heard them. I awoke in the middle of the night to wailing screams in the distance.

I lived in the countryside but was within walking distance of a small town where I had been buying my groceries and supplies. I opened my curtains and cracked open the window of my room to peer outside but was met with nothing but blackness and the sounds of men, women, and children screaming in the distance.

I could not tell if the screams were from agony, fear, or a mixture of the two, but it sent a dreadful chill down my spine. I sat frozen next to my window as my heart raced, and a heavy pit in my stomach started to weigh me down, just listening and feeling helpless to whatever was happening. I was terrified that whatever was making those people scream, would come for me next. 

I realized I had not even noticed the cloud of red spores that had entered my home while the window was cracked. I quickly shut the window, which only muffled the screams in the distance.

I rushed to turn on my TV to check the news, but all that would appear was a never-ending loading screen as the TV tried to connect to the internet.

I went to find my phone to see what the hell was going on and was met with a new emergency alert notification stating:

“EMERGENCY ALERT: HIGHLY AGGRESSIVE UNIDENTIFIED CREATURES REPORTED ACROSS MULTIPLE STATES. SHELTER IN PLACE. LOCK ALL DOORS AND WINDOWS. AUTHORITIES ARE RESPONDING”

Before I could even process what I was reading, a loud knock at the door had broken my concentration.

“David! David! It’s Ryan. Please!”

I recognized the voice to be my parents' neighbor Ryan and was given a fleeting moment of relief. Ryan was about ten years older than me, and I had spoken with him briefly in the past but never more than a short small talk conversation here and there.

I opened the door to see Ryan, his wife Trish, and their son Nate, who couldn’t have been older than ten. Ryan and his family quickly rushed inside.

“What’s going on out there?” I asked as I brought them into the living room.

Ryan and his wife Trish were both in a panic, yet their son was practically frozen, just staring off into the distance.

Ryan told me he was awoken to the screaming as well but realized his son Nate had gone out the front door for some reason. When he and his wife Trish rushed to go find him, they found him standing in the road in front of my house.

In a panic, they rushed here. Ryan’s sentence trailed off to a mumble.

I put on a face of false confidence and offered to let Ryan and his family sleep here for the night. Trish took Nate to bed, but Ryan stayed with me.

I realized at about this time that the screaming had stopped. After Trish and Nate had left the room and Ryan had a second to calm down, he looked over to me and said, 

“I didn’t want to scare Nate, but I saw something out there. It looked like some sort of insect or… or a spider. It was just watching him from outside the fog.”

“An insect?” I responded. “How big was it?”

Ryan looked like he had been shaken to his core. “Big. Like the size of a large dog or… or a deer… I could just see its silhouette at the edge of the darkness, looking right at Nate, and… and I could almost swear it sounded like my voice was coming from it, just lower and… broken.”

Ryan kept trailing off in his sentences and seemed like he was trying to make sense of it all himself.

“By the time Trish and I grabbed Nate, your house was closer to us than ours, so we ran this way,” Ryan said.

We sat in silence for a few minutes, both of us just overwhelmed and afraid.

I walked Ryan to the room where I had led Trish and their son to rest. Trish was lying on her side, holding her son in her arms and stroking his hair. I could tell she had been crying, but I didn’t feel like I knew her well enough to say anything.

The boy, on the other hand, looked almost unbothered and just continued staring off into the distance. I didn’t get any sleep that night.

After receiving the emergency alert, both my cell service and internet connection stopped working. I quickly realized how much I had been relying on my phone to bring me comfort over the past few months, but now I had no way of knowing what was going on—no connection to the outside world.

The next day, I awoke to my power cutting out. I walked outside to find the Red Murk was less dense, but it brought me no solace, for now I could once again see the sky.

As I gazed upward, my heart was filled with dread as thick red clouds covered Earth’s atmosphere.

Ryan and his family stayed at my house for a few weeks. I was honestly happy to have the company after being isolated for so long. We stayed inside and rationed our food carefully.

Eventually, however, my supplies began to run dry. Ryan and I decided we should try and head into town to see if we could find any supplies or someone to help us.

Trish objected and was able to convince Ryan to stay at the house. I left my front porch for the first time in months. Luckily, the Red Murk had cleared up enough that I could at least see where I was going.

The walk into town was eerie, the silence so heavy it felt like a weight pressing down on me. I scanned the empty streets, hoping for any sign of life: a bird, a squirrel, even a distant voice.

But there was nothing. Just the oppressive quiet and that unsettling feeling of being watched, a prickling awareness that something waited, just beyond the red-stained fog.

I was able to make my way into an old Walgreens that had been abandoned. It was at about this time I realized I should have done some research on what type of medicine would be useful in a scenario such as this.

Then again, what research could I have done with no internet? Walgreens wasn’t teeming with fresh, nutritious food, especially not any that hadn’t completely rotted with red mold anyway.

I grabbed as many items of food and medicine as I could before quickly heading out.

As I walked out of town, the sound of my steps reverberated through the streets. Fear began to take hold of my body.

It wasn’t fear like I had ever really felt before. It was more primal than that—like I was experiencing for the first time what it was like to be on the bottom of the food chain.

With no phone, no gun, no car, or no sort of human technology to keep me safe as it had humankind for thousands of years, I was completely alone.

Whatever I felt watching me from just outside the Red Murk, I could feel that it was hungry.

I don’t know if it was simply paranoia or a sixth sense from an age where humans were at the same level of disadvantage, but I knew from the deepest part of my physical body that I was not safe.

I began picking up the pace as I tried to get back home as quickly as possible. I can’t be certain, but my eyes were darting back and forth as I ran towards silhouettes of something slowly stalking my path just outside the fog.

As I ran down the road, I saw what looked like the silhouette of a person on my right who had not been there on my way in. Relieved to see another human, I slowed down and began to approach the person, who I could now tell was sitting on their knees in an almost yoga-like position with their back turned toward me on the side of the road.

“Hello?” I quivered. My words echoed in the fog like I was in a small cave.

“Are you okay?” I asked as I kept my distance but continued to walk around the person to see their face.

As I walked around this person, I began to make out through the Red Murk a young man no older than seventeen, his mouth agape and his eyes bleeding from their sockets.

All up and down the parts of his body I could see were red bulbs the size of golf balls. Some of them were broken like something had hatched out of them.

I took only one step closer as morbid curiosity overcame my fear. The boy was silent but twitching every few seconds and made a guttural hiccup sound with each twitch.

It was at about this time I noticed small creatures that looked like an uncanny mix of both crustacean and arachnid. They were roughly the size of quarters with long red legs and a round black abdomen.

They all had misshapen pincers near the front of their body like a crab with some sort of deformity. They crawled up and down the boy’s body and in and out of his nose and mouth.

I could hear some of them moving under his clothes, and they emanated a short and faint clicking sound as they scurried around. Small pieces of his flesh were missing, as though they had been using his still-living carcass for both incubation and food.

I could feel myself getting ready to vomit, but the feeling of needing to run home was stronger.

The next few minutes were a blur of animalistic focus to get indoors as quickly as possible.

It wasn’t until I ran through my front door and an air of safety washed over me that I began to feel guilt. I left that poor boy to suffer an unimaginable fate, and I didn’t even think to save him until I was safe and inside.

As I quickly closed the door behind me and began considering the horror I just witnessed, I didn’t even notice Ryan and Trish waiting in the foyer.

I stood there shaking, staring at the ground. My mind was filled with thoughts, but I didn’t say a word, still not noticing Ryan and Trish.

“Hey, what happened? Are you okay?” asked Ryan.

Just now realizing they were standing there, I jumped in fear. I dropped the supplies on the ground and walked to the upstairs bathroom, where I began to vomit.

I sat on the bathroom floor for the rest of the day. The image of that boy’s broken face burned into my eyes.

I didn’t get much sleep after that, the feeling of both horror and guilt keeping me up into the late hours of the night.

At this time of year in Virginia, the heat started to become unbearable—another painful reminder of our reliance on technology.

We kept the windows closed for obvious reasons, which made the house a humid hellhole. I was always one to keep the AC at about 68 degrees or so, so sleeping at what felt like no lower than 89 degrees, on top of the fear, paranoia, and guilt, made meaningful rest nearly impossible.

One night, as I lay in bed staring at the ceiling while the moonlight peered through my curtains, filling my room with an off-red glow, I was startled by the sound of a horrible scream coming from Ryan and Trish’s room.

I jumped out of bed and ran straight to where they had been sleeping.

My heart sank as I opened the door and was greeted by the sight of Ryan holding a gun, pointing it in my general direction, with his family cowering behind him.

Standing between Ryan’s family and me was a creature shaped like some sort of stingray with long, flat, thin limbs that looked way too small for its large winged head.

The creature stood about a foot taller than me and had a long pointed tail like a scorpion. The creature's head shook in what seemed to be some sort of intimidation display as its long pointed tail raised higher and higher while vibrating back and forth pointing towards Ryan and his family.

As the tail vibrated, I noticed it made almost the exact same noise as a rattlesnake.

The next thing I knew, I heard a gunshot that made my ears ring. Growing up on a farm, I was no stranger to firearms and the sound they made when the trigger was pulled, but I was so focused on the strangeness of the creature, I wasn’t expecting it.

The creature didn’t shriek like monsters do in the movies. It was high-pitched, sure, but it almost sounded more like an injured dog yelping in pain.

The creature immediately fell to the ground, writhing in agony as it began to bleed its bright red blood all over the carpet, its sharp pointed tail flailing everywhere.

After a few seconds, it took its last breath and deflated dead on the floor.

It was around this time I looked toward the window on the other side of the room, which had been left cracked open not even two inches.

We made sure to leave the windows closed after that night.

I was somewhat upset that Ryan brought a gun into my home without telling me. Granted, I was glad he had it at that moment, but I started to feel like my hospitality was being taken advantage of.

On the other hand, the last thing I wanted was to be alone.

After much thought I decided to confront Ryan about the gun. He was sitting at my kitchen table reading an old book my dad kept around about the Korean war.

“Hey, can I talk to you?” I asked somewhat hesitantly.

“Yeah sure, of course” Ryan responded closing the book and setting it to the side of the table.

“Look I don’t have a problem with you having a gun but between that and the window being left open… I feel like we need to have a little more communication here…” The volume of my voice trailed off. 

I was never good with confrontation so this was exceedingly uncomfortable for me.

“I know. I’m sorry, but just for me and my family's safety I thought it was best. As for the window I told Trish we couldn’t open it but I guess Nate got the idea at some point in the night. But I’m sorry.” Ryan responded

“It’s alright I just wish that like you would have been a little more forward about it… I guess” I responded almost to a mumble near the end of my sentence. 

“Look, we can't thank you enough for all you’ve done for us. Letting us stay here together, going into town to get supplies and going through what you saw. We are all so appreciative, but at the end of the day all that matters to me is keeping my family safe. Not to mention if anything you should be thanking me, especially with what's out there” Ryan’s tone abruptly shifted from apologetic to frustrated and almost downright angry as he spoke.

I was almost hurt by his words. I mean, I understood what he was saying but I now felt like an outsider in my own home, fending for myself as strangers shared my food, water, and shelter. I sat back in my chair and just nodded my head towards Ryan. We sat awkwardly in silence for a few minutes before Ryan got up to leave. 

As I sat at the table in my kitchen I thought back to what Ryan said about Nate opening the window. What was he opening the window for? One would assume to let some air in but I was brought back to memories of the night Ryan and his family arrived. I remember him saying he heard some sort of creature in the darkness calling from his very own voice. My mind wandered as I sat at the table, considering all of the horrible possibilities. 

As the weeks passed, we continued to hear more and more creatures just outside the house. They would moan and screech and scutter through the red foliage outside our walls. A terrifying reminder of how thin our layer of protection really was.

 At night, I continued to think of the boy sitting on the side of the road, of the voice calling to Nate, the creature that broke into my house not long ago...

Are humans really this ill-equipped to survive without the use of any type of machines or technology? Ryan may have broken my trust but he was right about one thing. Who knows what would have happened if he didn't have that gun? 

My mind then wandered to what it must be like to be an insect or a small creature living on the ocean floor.

I remember seeing a documentary once about wasps that would lay eggs in still-living caterpillars. The eggs would hatch, and the larvae would eat their way out of the caterpillar's still-living body.

It seems like the horror of that microscopic world is one that we now live in. One that was always right outside the comfy embrace of our safe, air-conditioned front door.

My thoughts kept circling back to one singular question. What could have laid its eggs in that boy?

As more time passed, all hope for being saved faded away. We had to begin being more strict with the rationing of our supplies. I refused to go back into town, especially alone. Trish and Ryan of course would not volunteer themselves.

Some contention started arising between Ryan’s family and I. I barely talked to Trish, and Ryan seemed weary of me. Like he didn’t trust me. Meanwhile he continued to drink my water and feed his family with the food I had saved up. 

We never argued or anything like that but it seems our air of trust had been broken ever since he shot that creature in his room. 

As I was scouring the pantry one night, looking for anything that could be consumed, just outside the wall, I could have sworn I heard Ryan’s voice calling out.

I was worried and confused because the other side of this wall led to my backyard, where the tree line that guards a forest sits about 30 yards from my back door.

“Ryan?” I yelled.

“Yeah? Everything okay?” Ryan responded from what sounded like the living room.

“Uh, nothing. Sorry. Thought I heard you say something,” I responded, confused.

A few minutes passed, and Trish came rushing down the stairs.

“Where’s Nate?” she asked Ryan.

“I thought he was with you…” Ryan responded, scared of the next words to come out of her mouth.

As I walked toward the stairs, I looked toward the back door, which had been left open, letting a cloud of red fog into the house.

The three of us darted toward the back door, led by Trish. I grabbed my flashlight on the way out.

The Red Murk was thin, but the moon was nowhere to be found, so we relied on the light of my flashlight as we looked for Nate in the backyard.

As we called out to him, we heard what sounded like crying from the tree line. The sound was identical to Nate’s voice.

I pointed my flashlight at the area from which the sound was coming to see Nate with his hands over his eyes.

He barely moved. Even though he was sobbing, his mouth didn’t twitch or open or close at all.

Trish ran straight for him without a second thought, followed by Ryan and then me.

Trish ran to Nate, squatted down, and began trying to pick him up. I noticed she struggled for a second and seemed confused about why she couldn’t lift the small boy.

I raised the round light of my flashlight upwards a few inches as I realized the sound of crying was actually coming from further into the forest itself and not where Nate was supposedly standing. Ryan who was standing behind me began moving towards them both.

Just as Ryan let out a sigh of relief over finding Nate, the large abdomen of an insect-like creature no shorter than 30 feet long and 20 feet tall whipped forward.

The bottom of its thorax had been pointed up to the sky until now, unnoticed by us as it was camouflaged to look like shrubs and small trees that had been colored a subtle red to match its environment.

Two large pincers darted toward Trish from either side of the flashlight’s round illumination and clamped her by the waist and right below her neck.

The creature’s legs, which I now realized were made to look like the bark of long thin trees, began to slowly stand up. 

In a matter of seconds I understood this creature had been there the entire time we had been outside. Waiting for the perfect moment.

As the creature rose, it pulled back its tail into the dark forest behind it. At that moment, I realized the tip of its tail had somehow either perfectly camouflaged itself to look exactly like Nate or had used the child’s corpse as a lure to get his mother out of the house.

I moved my flashlight upward in disbelief as I stared, dumbfounded, at the behemoth.

The sound of Nate’s crying voice was still transmitting from the creature as it pulled Trish roughly 20 feet into the air and began to engorge itself on her body, starting at the side of her neck.

Its head resembled a praying mantis, but its mandibles were wrong. They jutted out from its jaw like fleshy red tentacles, twitching unnervingly, pulling pieces of Trish’s flesh into its mouth where smaller more rigid mandibles did the chewing. 

Red blood started to drip down onto the ground as it rolled off the creature's clamped pincers, trapping her in place by her waist and upper body.

I stood frozen in fear once again as the woman who had lived in my home for months was eaten alive by this creature.

Looking back, I think I was most disturbed by how innocently uncaring the creature looked. Although it was a horrible abomination, it harbored no ill will. It was simply consuming energy.

Trish’s family, life, hopes, and dreams—it all meant nothing to it. She was simply food. I think that somehow felt worse than something that hated or felt anger towards us. Something that we as humans could understand.

Its large oval eyes even darted around from side to side, independently of one another, as though it itself had to be on the lookout for predators while it ate.

I stared in horror as Trish’s lifeless body was torn apart one chunk at a time by the creature's maw.

It all must have been about eight seconds before my shock was broken by a bloodcurdling scream finally let out by Ryan, but there was nothing he or I could do.

I snapped out of it and quickly ran to Ryan, grabbing him and attempting to drag him inside. My flashlight quickly jetted from side to side as I tried to grab him.

In the illumination of my flashlight, I caught a short glimpse of dozens of eyes of varying sizes glowing from the reflection of the light at the cusp of the Red Murk, which had begun to grow thicker in the few short minutes we had been outside.

The creatures sitting and staring from the red void would, without a doubt, make us their next meal if it weren’t for the giant organism just a few feet from us, which was currently consuming Ryan’s still-living wife.

I was able to drag Ryan inside as he angrily and mournfully sobbed into my shoulder.

Once inside, he pushed me away and ran upstairs. I didn’t chase him—yet another thing I now feel guilty about—but I had a new horrific image burned into my mind.

Ryan returned with the gun he had used to kill the stingray-like creature. I understood at the time, but maybe I was too afraid to stop him.

I knew what horrors awaited us out there and like I always, I did nothing.

I sat on the floor thinking about the image of Trish being eaten by something none of us could even comprehend.

Ryan swung open the back door and started firing into the tree line.

It was pitch black outside, but I could hear the creature grumble and move as its large but slender legs broke down smaller trees and retreated, meal in hand, into the forest.

Ryan fired around five or six shots, then slumped down to his knees, dropping the gun.

I finally mustered the courage to stand up and try to calm Ryan once again and bring him inside.

As I took my first step toward the back door, a long mucus covered appendage struck Ryan in the back of the head originating from somewhere above him and out of sight.

He immediately slumped over, paralyzed, as the appendage still stuck to him pulled him upward.

His frozen body faced toward me as his back folded over his legs, twisting his body. All he could move were his eyes, which locked with mine.

The anger that overtook him all but a short few moments ago was gone. All I saw was fear and sadness in his eyes. 

Ryan was then pulled away from my view to God knows what sort of fate.

I quickly closed the door as fast as I could and fell to the floor. My mind was filled with the thoughts of a whole family gone in the blink of an eye to the horrors outside of my very home.

I didn’t get any sleep that night either.

The next day, I gathered up enough bravery to quickly grab the gun Ryan left behind on my back porch.

The Red Murk was the thickest I had ever seen. The gun was not but a few feet from my door, but I could barely find it between the overwhelming fear and the red fog that filled the outside air.

The Red Murk smelled particularly horrible that day. On top of sulfur and iron it gave an unholy aroma of putrid decay. 

A few weeks have passed. I was proud of my rationing abilities but that meant I had gone days without eating more than once.

 I’m scared to look in the mirror, I don’t know if I’d even recognize the person staring back. I know I have a long beard now and that my hair has grown down below my neck line. I don’t want to see the scared shameful creature that I’ve become.

I can hear them outside now as I’m writing this. It’s only a matter of time before they find a way in or decide just to break down a window or door.

Some are larger than the creature that took Trish. One sounded so gargantuan its steps shook the house like an earthquake. The noises it emitted sounded like whales calling of all things.

At night, I swear I hear Ryan’s voice calling my name from the edge of the forest. I know it's not him. One day recently I saw Ryan's split open carcass about 20 yards from my back porch. His lifeless form wrapped in red decay near where the cows my parents once raised used to roam. 

I’m almost out of water now, so I guess this is it. I checked the gun Ryan left behind, and of course, there’s only one bullet left. Seems poetic almost.

I don’t know why I’m writing this. I was hoping it would bring me some sort of comfort or a way to put things in perspective, but all it’s done is made me relive the horrors of the last year. So I guess these are my final words. 

I’m not going back outside. I won’t be a part of the food chain.

There’s one bullet left.
