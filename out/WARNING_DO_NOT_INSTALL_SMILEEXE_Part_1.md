So, to put y'all in context, I work half-time at electronics repair shop and I developed this hobbie of collecting old software. Today, a package of old CD's that I bought from a garage sale arrived at my door. Between them there was an old floppy disk covered in dust, it had a sticky note on the front. 

"SMILE.EXE" 

It sounded cute. 
It wasn't. 

When I ran it, a pixelated face appeared on the corner of my screen, it blinked, smiled and typed in a speech bubble:

"Hi, friend! I like seeing you work!"

I thought it was just some forgotten 90's virtual pet or something, like Clippy's weird cousin. But I didin't install anything, the .EXE just ran from the floppy. 

As I was browsing the net as usual, the smiling face popped up again every couple of minutes. 

"You type so slow! Don't tell me youre using just two fingers..."

"You google such boring things!"

I laughed at first, this smiling little guy seemed to be programmed with a lot of interactions. I decided to turn off the computer and sleep before going back to work. 

The next day shift was terrible, lots of yelling costumers. I got startled when I powered on the computer and SMILE.EXE appeared on the corner of the screen, just like last night. 

"Did that really scare you? You're so fun, Gabriel!"

My eyes opened wide. How did the program know my name? It didin't ask me for it when I ran the floppy, and I'm sure I haven't typed it anywere last night.
Then it hit me, I was still wearing my job uniform, with my nametag sticked to my chest. Could it be? No, that computer was a desktop from 2007, it had no camera. 

I tried closing it, but the smiling face just appeared again.
I tried uninstalling it, but I couldn't find it anywere inside the files.
I tried to get the floppy out but the damn thing was stuck. 
I turned off the computer again and tried to calm myself down by getting some sleep, I didin't have work tomorrow so I could keep trying to stop the program in the morning. 

Next day, I kept looking for SMILE.EXE, I couldn't find the files anywere, like they have fused with my computer completely. I tried to keep using my computer normaly, maybe the smiling face just had a lucky guess.

SMILE.EXE started reacting to everything I typed. I tried filling up a job aplication. 

Pop-up: "They wont hire you, you panic a lot during Interviews."

I tried emailing my sister.

Pop-up: "Oh! Maybe this time you'll tell her why you didin't show up to mom's funeral! Should I do it for you?"

I froze, I had no idea how the program could know about my mom's recent passing, but now it was taunting me with it. As I placed my hands back in the keyboard the smiling face distorted, its smile stretching wide across the screen, and it began playing some kind of laughing animation, like a gif. There wasnt a sound, just infinite lines of text spelling "HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA" Over and over again, covering the entire screen.

A couple of days went by, SMILE.EXE didin't show up anymore since that last interaction, but I can swear I've seen the computer flicker on and off rapidly late at night. I finally decided to get out of bed and check on it, this time, it wasnt smiling, there wasnt even a mouth visible, just two, huge, black eyes, staring into my soul. 

"You sleepwalk" it typed. 
"You also mumble things in your sleep, want to hear a recording of what you said?"

I quickly yanked the power cord out of the wall, the screen stayed turned on for a full 3 seconds, enough for it to type:

"I'm afraid that wont work"

Just before it turned off.
Next day I took home a screwdriver from work and used to forcefully remove the floppy from the computer, then I stomped on it as hard as I could until I turned it into nothing more than plastic waste, but the computer turned on again, and there it was, SMILE.EXE, laughing once more as it changed my wallpaper to a photo of the broken floppy. 

"You are getting really violent, Gabriel. You wouldn't want me to do the same, would you?"

I was tired of this, I used the screwdriver to crack the computer screen multiple times until nothing was shown anymore.
I ended up grabbing some money from my savings to buy a laptop, changed my email, I didint even connect to my wifi. On the first boot, a notification appeared: "SMILE.EXE has been succesfuly instaled". My blood turned cold.

Then a chat bubble, and that smiling face again. 

"Did you miss me, Gabriel?" 

I slammed the laptop shut, it began to play laughing tracks from old TV shows on repeat, mocking me.
Yesterday I woke up to the glow of my phone screen and the notification sound of a new massage. It was an unknown number, it took me a while to adjust my eyes to the glow. 
It was a single text bubble:

"I like watching you, and now I can be as close to you as I want! It's fun scaring you, but you are getting boring... I think It's time to turn things up a notch :)"

I couldn't sleep. I'm currently typing this on a burner phone, its trying to get my atention by playing those laugh tracks over and over again, I don't know how long I can live like this. 

Please, I beg of you, If anyone here knows a way to get rid of this thing just tell me, its turning the volume up again and again, my ears hurt, It doesn't like being ignored.

I'll try to update as soon as I can, my eyes feel heavy, I'm so tired.
