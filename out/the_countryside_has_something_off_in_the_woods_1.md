the countryside has something off in the woods [1]

So much has happened recently, so much to the point where I don't even know where to begin.
I guess to start at the very beginning would be best.  My family after my step-mother and 3rd mother left my dad. My dad said enough is enough and said the city life was too much and bought some land out in the countryside for about 3000 Dollars.


 apparently it was on a major sale. So a few days after we packed up everything and left the city that my family had known and loved. We soon arrived at the old land there was a medium sized house with two floors and a forest in the back with some fields. 


We soon moved everything in the house and I got my room set up. A few weeks passed as normal, it was the middle of summer so I didn't have school so I was up late looking at my phone with the tv playing reruns of south park. But then suddenly there was a crash that came from my little sisters room. My blood went cold as I slowly climbed out of bed and heard the window shatter.


 I quickly walked over to my door and swung it open into the hallway and noticed the light was on in her room from under the door. I jogged over to her door and swung it open my little sister was crying under her bed. Glass was all over the room. My dad quickly stood in the door frame with me. "What happend?!" He shouted with my sister was stammering on her words. All she could do was point out the window into the woods. 


The next day was a blur as we tried to get my sister to calm down the entire day. She explained that she thinks it came from the woods nearby. My dad sighed "Sean, take your sister out into the woods to show her everything is fine." My sister grabbed me and just shook her head at me with tears in her eyes. I sighed and walked her out the door with me. We stopped by the truck and I pulled the back down and I picked up and opened  a cardboard box labeled "TOYS" and pulled out 2 walkie talkies and gave one to her. "IF we lose each other we can still communicate, Alright?" She nodded silently


We slowly walked through the tall grass and into the forest we held our hands together to make sure I wouldn't lose her.
I think I zoned out for awhile because I stopped feeling her in my hand.
I looked back and she was gone
I looked up and saw stars.
"What?" I said to myself
I remembered the walkie talkie and pushed in the button on the side
"Mia? You there?." I whispered
"Yeah?"
I pushed in the button


"Where are you?" 
"I'm with you"
I looked around I felt like I was being watched..
"What do you mean?
"I'm still holding your hand."
I then heard her say something before the radio went static "Shit!" I looked around 
There was some kind of red mist surrounding eveywhere you looked.


I pulled out my phone and tried to call my dad in a panic, I opened up my contacts to see blank. There was nothing. I felt a tear drip down face as the situation grew in stress. I heard a twig snap followed by footsteps and I thought it was a deer at first but the snap was soon followed by human like footsteps. I turned on my phone's light and shined it in the general direction of the sound. I saw glowing eyes with the outline of antlers and a cloak. It hissed and ran into a bush.


 I panicked and ran the way back home. I had never been a very aware kid when it comes to surroundings. But I slammed my forehead into a log. I fell and sat up, and looked behind me I saw there was more of them I shined the light at it again. They hissed and ran off. I crawled under the log and ran to the right and dived into a rouge log on the ground. I heard them outside saying something in a language 
I've never heard.


I looked through a hole in the log and looked for a while and I saw one take off their deer skull mask, the mask was almost like a wendigo's mask.Under the mask was what looked like a skinned human with scales and snout like some sort of lizard humanoid. It later put back on its mask and both walked off. And soon the red mist faded. I slowly crawled out and noticed the sky was blue and normal. I looked around and saw my house. And looked behind me and noticed my sister holding my hand behind me. I was silent on the walk back home. It's been 2 weeks since that happened I don't think I'll ever know if it was real or not.  And no one wants to believe me, not my sister, not my friends and not even my dad. And I don't think I'll ever really recover from this.
