I work full-time as a nurse in a hospital in England. 

On a Tuesday and Thursday i go in there around 8:00am and end my shift at 8:00pm - i try and get my emails sorted and my patients in check.

Theres always someone with me, my ten colleagues that usually work the same hours as me, some of them sit at the front desk doing whatever they do, and the rest of my good friends are scattered everywhere making sure the patients have enough food and water for the night. I usually sit on a massive sofa near the front desk where four of my colleagues talk away endlessly about any subject they can think of.


Theres these massive televisions that are displayed on the sides of the walls that tell us which patient needs us in which room, the television is usually off but when someone needs us all they have to is ring the bell in their room and it will be displayed evenly on the tv showing what floor, room and what person needs help.

But this is the problem, on one occasion i wasnt in on the Tuesday shift and the alarms went off. My colleagues told me worriedly that room 13 was displayed as well - i snorted and told them that this was no joke and what patient was needed in the rest of the rooms but all of them shrugged and left with a petrified expression.


No one ever talks about that room.

Why?

Because im not going to talk about that room. 
It does not exist anymore so what is there to talk about?.. i told my self repeatedly that it was just a harmless joke but i couldn’t get their faces out of my head, i mean my friends know that they can never steep this low to scare me. 

So why now?

Room 13 wasnt on the chart, it usually went room 1, (missing out 3) to 14 and onwards. We never included room 13 so technically it didn’t exist.


After this day there was things happening when i wasnt there, if i was ill sometimes it would fall on a Monday and skip through Tuesday and when it did my colleagues would complain and tell me that all the alarms for all of the patients went off at the same time, but as soon as Rosette got to the first floor and into the first room the alarms would stop before she got to check up on the patient.

But when i was there nothing happened, and i couldn’t believe it - so nothing happens when im here but when im not, something does?

The rest of the days like Monday, Wednesday and Friday are normal days where i check-up on my patients take their blood and pressure.

Monday, Wednesday and Friday are for the other workers that work in the hospital, they do the night shift on those days. 

One of my coworkers, Aleisha Walker, she does THAT night shift and texted me that she somewhat had all of the alarms go off at the same time which coincidentally didnt have the room 13 on the screen, but had this other room that obviously didnt exist come up on the screen. 


Now i knew that this was no joke anymore because all of us meeted up on a Saturday talking about it. I respectfully butted in and told them my side of the story and how i didn’t believe some of it because everytime I wasn’t there it didn’t happen. Aleisha’s colleagues we will call Group A and my coworkers Group B.

So Group A exclaimed that Marshall wasnt in on the Wednesday night because of a family issue, so he took the day off. The others in group A told us that all the alarms went off but no room that was never on the chart went off as well.

I cupped my coffee and listened intensely about my group and when i wasnt in, the alarms would go off and show a room that never existed before. I looked at all of my colleagues, they all had this look that i couldnt get out of my head. As i was detailing the looks  of everyone, my eyes met Aleisha whom had the same mild and confused expression as me.

Both of us got up and went outside for air as we discussed our opinions about this situation.

“Well.. i mean.. at first I thought it was a dumb joke, but when i was not at work and i wanted to take a look on my phone and text the others, it would show i had no connection to this person.” Aleisha exclaimed as i gasped quietly.

“Wait.. so your saying that your coworkers would text you and you wouldnt get the message?” I asked in a nervous tone as she nodded weirdly.

We both looked up at eachother wondering how we are in the same state and the others are just witnessing it.

All of us went back to our usual shifts after that — nothing happened even when i wasnt in or Aleisha. We held our celebration together quietly, at the hospital we got our work done and group A visited seeing as it was our last shift until we leave the place for good. We all sat down comfortably, and talked among ourselves telling eachother funny stories and how we will still be in touch.

Ive been working for this hospital for years and i wanted a fresh start, so did everyone else. A loud rhythmatic alarm blared my ears as a blinding red light surged through my eyes, i blinked slowly looking at everyone, but all my colleagues were looking at the television - i slowly turned my head.

All the rooms, floors and patients were displayed in red writing, flashing off and on every ten seconds as the alarm repeatedly went off not missing a beat. The others shouted and pointed at the screen of the tv

Room 13 and room 3 were shown.

We all noticed a room that was missing.

Number 1.

The same room that Rosette just went to.

That’s when we heard bloodcurdling screams coming from all the patients.

But the strange thing was.

No one came.

It was like the screams were coming from the television. 

But where was Rosette?

And where were the patients..?
