After my wife inherited a trust, there was an increase in unwanted attention. Occasional large men seemed observant in the course of our routines. A few months later I defended myself from someone who visibly clenched up as soon as he entered my line of sight. Surprised, I did a double take, whereupon he made a show of deliberately looking away, as if commanding me not to notice him. After a moment he looked back at me, and I called him out with a curt nod. He then became verbally abusive and assaulted me in front of multiple witnesses and security cameras. A security guard came afterwards and asked if I wanted to make a police report but I declined.

Seemingly overnight the rougher demographics of the community began to act more vigilant and menacing towards me. Was it a sudden faintheartedness or a premonition? Were people pointing their phone at me or was it just my imagination? Because I didn't know who he was, until I recognized him getting indicted on the news a year later as an organized crime figure, I called on several remote family members to help protect my loved ones. My own father said he didn't want to go "anywhere near" the situation. My uncle in law agreed to come help us fly out of the state.

I started to feel like myself again once we boarded the plane. I was about to leave this disaster behind. Then my uncle in law called attention to us by loudly making fun of my sense of insecurity regarding our safety. One nearby passenger stood up to get a good look at us. I had a sinking feeling as the plane took off. Could this follow us?

I've been in a state of limbo. Only recently I thought it strange. The in laws never expressed any interest, let alone concern, or even passing curiosity in such a life threatening event that could have subsequent ramifications.

Later this uncle gave her unsigned pieces of paper of an additional "Article" of the will. They changed the distribution and included a clause that gave the trustee more discretion in the event of her death - but it's not in the probate court records. Why?

*Thus began a series of high strangeness and unfortunate events. Stay tuned for part two! Chapters:*

**The Crime Boss**: Not long after my wife inherited a trust, there were attempts on one or both of our lives, not least of all by someone later identified on the news as an organized crime figure.

**A Clause in the Will**: Her uncle, the former executor, then gave her an unsigned addition to the will. It changed the distribution and granted the trustee more discretion in the event of my wife’s death. These are not in the filed will.

**The Family Friend**: We were then illegally kicked out during the COVID moratorium by a family friend of the in-laws after reporting inappropriate and intrusive behavior.

**Continued Stalking Shenanigans**: Suspicious neighbors and hostile property owners in multiple states, break-ins, hacked email account. Records and evidence available.

**The Disappearing Father**: My wife’s father allegedly died soon after abuse allegations. Her uncle, despite having met him, claims to have forgotten his name.

**Attacking Stability with Slander**: When my wife and I applied to one of our first rentals all those years ago, the property owner practically fell in love with us and approved us on the spot, but drastically changed after moving in, as she became inexplicably standoffish. We had used this uncle as a reference. For him it's starting to seem as if this was never about me. It was always about her father.

**A Parallel Probate Paranoia**: A deceased relative of the in-laws had been placed under guardianship for paranoid schizophrenia, raising questions about institutional abuse.

**The Streisand Effect**: Around the end of last year this stalker in-law fished for our address by emailing my wife that he had some mail to forward and she told him, yes our p.o. box is still the same. It's a p.o. box because we know by now what he's up to and we don't want him in our business anymore. Then a couple of weeks later he emailed her a random "interesting" article, by amazing coincidence about the very city we were in. He then started to write to a private email address of mine which I have not shared with him. Months later I received notice of a data breach on the account less than a week before he started writing to it.
