Suffice it to say, I didn’t continue my stream the other night.

Between my mysteriously locked door and the unsettling timing of my new ‘follower’, it just didn’t sit right with me. I felt as though I was better off just going to bed and ignoring it entirely. If you haven't read Part 1 of this story so far, please, read it here: [I Have One New Follower, I Wish I Didn't (Part 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lkp8qe/i_have_one_new_follower_i_wish_i_didnt_part_1/)

I knew I was overreacting but something was buried deep within me that wouldn’t let it go. Like a small seed planted in my mind had sprouted roots and latched onto my thoughts. But there was one thing throughout all of this commotion that I could look forward to, and that was my date with Anna. Before you say anything, I know it wasn’t actually a date-date. I could just call it a ‘get-together’, but that sounds ridiculous to me.

Anna sent me a text that afternoon, double checking that our plans were still on. As to not seem too eager, I waited about 5 minutes before responding.

“*Definitely, what’s the plan?”* I finally replied.

Almost immediately she sent a message back: “*awesome, we plan on meeting at Murphy’s around 7. Do you need a ride?”*

A ride. Shit. The only places I’d been to in the last 3 weeks had all been within walking distance. I had almost forgotten people my age were supposed to have a car.

I sheepishly typed: “*I guess it would make the most sense if we carpooled! lol I can throw you some $$ to make up for it.*”

She replied: “*no worries haha I got you! Meet at my place 6:45?”*

I sent back: “*sounds good!*

*I know where you live. lol”*

She didn’t respond. I don’t know why I said that. I thought it might be funny, playing off of our conversation the day before. But within minutes after sending it with no reply, a knot formed in the pit of my stomach. It stayed tight until she finally sent a text about 15 minutes later.

“*don’t be weird. haha”*

The knot unfurled.

I spent about an hour and a half getting ready. Teasing and twisting my hair in three hundred different directions, hoping to land on the perfect style that would miraculously make me lose fifteen pounds.

My closet was less than spectacular but I’m capable of throwing together a presentable outfit. Out of everyone in my old friend group, I was the only one who had actually put thought into their style. If my timid personality wasn’t going to attract girls, I would have to let my clothes do the talking. Honestly, they don’t say much. Besides, most arcades are known for being dimly lit with flashing neon lights and I hoped that would work heavily in my favor that night.

I left my place, making sure I had my keys with me and the door was properly locked. Flashbacks of my mom consumed me as I went back to make sure it was locked a second time. I finally felt an inkling of what was going on in her mind all those years ago.

I walked up the stairs towards her apartment feeling my excitement fade into anxiety. Who was I kidding? This wasn’t anything close to a date. If anything, this was a pity invitation. She probably reached out this morning hoping that I had changed my mind. Now her poor friends were being dragged into this...that wasn’t fair for them. I had almost convinced myself to just turn around and go home. But just as I started to turn, I heard a door open.

"Trevor?” I stopped at the sound of her voice. “I thought I heard you out here.” Anna’s tone was calm, but playful. “Come in, I’m almost finished getting ready.”

I followed her through the threshold, unable to tear my eyes away from her stunning outfit. Based on her posts, I'd expected the usual jeans and graphic tee. But apparently this was a special occasion. Wrapped around her body was a beautiful black strapless dress. It extended two-thirds down her legs and went up to a few inches below her neck line. On top she wore a cut-off red leather jacket, adorned with multiple straps and studs. The cherry-red color matched her short heels and lipstick to a T. Butterflies started to form in my gut. Maybe this *was* a date…

The first half of the drive was only about ten minutes, but it felt like a lifetime sitting in the passenger seat. We’d each attempted to start a conversation only for it to fizzle out after one or two responses. At one point I literally said, “How about this weather, huh?” Kill me.

She eventually turned on some music to fill the silence. Our lack of conversation honestly didn’t feel awkward, in fact, it was kind of peaceful. Sitting with our thoughts, listening to the Velvet Underground’s “Satellite of Love” as she drove me through unfamiliar parts of the city was oddly calming. I was content just enjoying her company.

She made the cutest face when she wasn’t sure which turn to make next. Every once in a while she’d catch me looking from her peripheral view.

She chuckled, “What are you looking at?” Her focus shifted between myself and the road.

“Nothing… it’s just.” I paused. “You look incredible tonight.”

She smiled and looked out the driver’s side window, in what looked like an attempt to hide her blushing. “Thank you, Trevor.” Her eyes traced me up and down. “You don’t look so bad yourself.”

I knew she was lying, but it was a comforting lie. In reality, I was a Minivan sitting next to a Ferrari.

As we pulled up to Murphy’s, two of Anna’s friends were already waiting outside. One of them was a rather lanky boy with curly bleach-blond hair that draped over his left eye. He leaned against the side of the building, giving off an aura of “I was dragged here,” as he stared at his phone. Closer to the sidewalk was a petite girl with sleek black hair, pulled tightly into a ponytail. She wasn’t nearly as dressed up as Anna, which made me feel more comfortable about my choice of attire.

Anna leaned over. “So that’s Cory.” she pointed toward the unamused boy against the wall. The girl in the ponytail jumped excitedly and started humping the air when she spotted Anna’s car. “...and that’s Chloe…”

Chloe seemed like the type of person I needed in a friend group. I was usually pretty quiet, even among close friends, so the balance of an extroverted soul always kept me in check. I spent a lot of high school parties playing goalie for the snack table. Constantly blocking people from retrieving their only source of sustenance without intending to.

Sarah was good at pulling me out of those anti-social behaviors, but Sarah was now over 3,000 miles away.

After some brief introductions outside, we stepped into Murphy’s Arcade. It was much bigger than I had anticipated, but for a small town like this, I imagine the arcade was a lot of student’s main source of entertainment. Especially for the unfortunate ones under 21, like myself. Just past the entrance stood a couple of miniature claw machines. Small trinkets that would attract children immediately as they walked in. Beyond those were endless rows of larger prize-games followed by your classic shooters, ski-ball and dancing simulators, etc. If I hadn’t been so focused on Anna that night, I might have actually enjoyed myself. I used to love playing Step Step Redemption when I was growing up. Dancing had never been my strong suit, but when my mom would watch me get 100% on a song in Expert mode, I felt like a superstar.

We purchased our Play Cards at the front counter and Anna told Chloe she could pick the first game. Without hesitation she bolted for the Free-Throw Basketball machine. We paired off into groups of two—Me and Anna vs. Chloe and Cory. I felt like proving I was even somewhat athletic would help my chances with Anna. To put it plainly, I sucked. During the entire ninety seconds we had to shoot, I made only three baskets total. I was getting a bit frustrated. Anna kept giving me a reaffirming smile after every missed attempt, reminding me that it’s just a game.

Chloe sank her last shot right as the buzzer rang and the final score was 56 to 38. They crushed us. I felt my ego take a slight hit, but tried not to visibly show it. I congratulated them both, making sure they knew that I took the loss gracefully. Anna looked down at her phone, appearing to check the time. It was the third time she did it that night.

“What time is Scott supposed to be here?” She turned her head toward Chloe.

*Who the fuck is Scott?,* I thought.

“Who’s Scott?” I asked.

“My stupid-ass older brother.” Chloe hissed. “And he should be here any minute. Calm yourself, Anna.”

They shared a look. The kind of look that said a million words in less than two seconds. I try not to overthink these kind of small interactions. It can end up sending you spiraling down into meaningless speculations and conspiracies with little-to-no evidence beyond your own biased emotions. But this was so blatant that it was almost impossible for me to ignore. Anna and Scott had a history.

As awful as it might be to say, my only hope was that Scott was uglier than me. I’ll be the first to admit it, I’m not the most attractive guy in the world by any stretch of the imagination, but that didn’t matter. I just had to be *more* attractive than Scott. It’s like being chased by a bear in the woods. You don’t have to be the fastest man in the world—you just have to be faster than whoever you’re camping with.

“Speak of the literal devil…” Chloe gestured toward the entrance.

Through the double doors walked a slim but clearly fit guy with a fresh buzz cut and five-o-clock shadow—even though it was almost twenty past seven. His light blue denim jacket swayed with each step, lying over a tightly fitted black t-shirt. A pair of boot-cut black jeans accentuated his calf muscles as he walked. He was clearly a couple years older than us, but couldn’t have been older than twenty five. I caught a glimpse of his deep blue eyes as he scanned the room for his sister.

Fuck. He was hot.

An instant flash of warm jealousy over took my face and made my cheeks burn. It began to fade as I looked past where Scott had just walked in. About ten feet behind him followed a much older man, easily in his late seventies. He wore a tattered white t-shirt and what looked like pajama pants that hadn’t been washed since the late 90’s. His face was cold and vacant as he approached the front doors. His body seemed almost impossibly skinny, as though he had been trapped under a hydraulic press. Scott either didn’t see him coming in, or chose to ignore him entirely, because he didn’t even bother holding the door. My bet was on the latter.

I gestured subtly toward the door and leaned over to Anna. 'Who invited their grandpa?' I whispered.

I expected at the very least a pity chuckle, but instead she elbowed me in the side and shot me a look. My heart sank. I offended her. She must know him personally somehow—possibly a family friend or old teacher. I was about to apologize when Scott finally reached us, embracing Chloe in a one armed hug.

“Hey, guys! I’m so sorry I’m late. Max begged for a walk right as I was about to leave.”

Of course he has a dog.

He wrapped both arms around Anna and pulled her in a little too tight before meeting eyes with me and releasing her. “I’m Scott, by the way. Anna said she was bringing someone from her building tonight.” He extended his hand toward me.

I reluctantly shook it. “Trevor. Nice to meet you. And yeah, I just moved in about a month ago.” I made an attempt to sound enthusiastic. To be honest, I couldn’t help but focus on the old man.

While Scott introduced himself, the man had now pushed the door open using only his chest and face, as if his arms were completely useless. He never broke his stride, walking slowly but intently, toward Scott. His limbs rubbed against the glass of several claw machines as he passed, smearing them with skin oil and grease. He stopped about 5 feet behind Scott and stared at Anna. The edges of his mouth curled up forming a content smile.

I felt an uneasy pit in my stomach form, but based on everyone else’s reaction, I had to assume this was normal. In my hometown, it was pretty common for the unhoused to just wander into random air conditioned businesses as a means to cool down. Most of them were virtually harmless at the end of the day. They just wanted the same things that every person wanted—to survive and to feel seen.

But no one looked at the old man.

We continued our night, bouncing from game to game. The more Scott’s personality came out, the more I receded into my own thoughts. He had an inherent charm without even trying. The right words came effortlessly to him, and I was fumbling my way through every other sentence. I chose to speak less as the night went on. Mostly out of embarrassment, or more so, the potential embarrassment.

I started taking cues from the rest of the group and elected to ignore the old man entirely. I would lose sight of him every once in a while, which was equally unsettling as it was reassuring. His presence made me feel uneasy. Like floating in a body of water and knowing something is underneath you.

The next time I spotted the old man, he was standing directly behind the air hockey table where Scott and Anna were playing. Scott had just scored his third goal in a row, and Anna was laughing—genuinely laughing—in a way I hadn't heard all night. The old man's smile widened as he watched her, his head tilting slightly to the side like a curious dog.

"You okay, dude?" Cory asked, appearing beside me with a slushie. "You look like you've seen a ghost."

"Yeah, just... tired, I guess." I forced a smile. "This old guy staring at Anna is creeping me out a bit though, if I’m being honest."

Cory looked toward the air hockey table as he sipped from his drink. When my comment hit him, he chuckled so hard a bit of it came out of his nose. “Jesus dude, that’s harsh.” He walked away with a judgmental look in his eyes, accompanied by a sense of appreciation for my honesty.

Why was everyone defending this guy? He must have been a well known figure in the town before a terrible fall from grace or something. It just didn’t make sense to me.

I was becoming increasingly convinced that something was very wrong with this place, or very wrong with me. The old man kept appearing at the worst possible moments—whenever Scott made Anna smile, whenever she touched his arm while laughing, whenever I felt that familiar stab of jealousy in my chest.

The pattern was becoming impossible to ignore.

We moved to the racing games next. Scott, of course, was annoyingly good at everything. As Anna cheered for him during his victory lap, I caught a glimpse of the old man in the reflection of Scott's screen. He was standing directly behind Anna now, close enough that his breath would be bouncing off of her neck. But she didn't react. Nobody reacted.

"Trevor!" Anna's voice snapped me back to reality. "Your turn."

I fumbled with the steering wheel, my hands shaking slightly. The old man was still there in my peripheral vision, that same content smile spread across his weathered face. I crashed my virtual car within the first thirty seconds.

"Guess racing isn't your strong suit either," Scott said with a chuckle that felt like a punch to the gut.

Anna gave Scott a playful shove. "Be nice. He's having an off night."

But it wasn't an off night. It was becoming clear that this was just who I was when faced with actual competition. A loser who saw things that weren't there and couldn't even pretend to be interesting for one evening.

That's when Anna spotted the claw machine.

"Oh my god, look at that little Yoshi!" She pressed her face against the glass, pointing at a bright green plushie nestled among the other prizes. "He's so cute! I used to play Mario with my little brother all the time when we were kids."

Scott leaned over her shoulder to look. "Want me to try and get it for you?"

"No, that's okay," she said, but I could hear the want in her voice. "Those things are totally rigged anyway."

This was it. This was my chance.

While Scott was busy showing off his basketball skills to Chloe, I approached Anna at the claw machine. "I could give it a shot," I said, trying to sound casual. "I'm pretty good at these things."

That was a complete lie. I'd never won anything from a claw machine in my life.

"Really, Trevor, you don't have to—"

"I want to," I interrupted, already feeding a dollar into the machine. "Consider it a housewarming gift for being such a cool neighbor."

She smiled, and for a moment, the old man didn't matter. Scott didn't matter. Nothing mattered except that smile and the possibility that I could be the one to earn it.

The first attempt was pathetic. The claw grabbed nothing but air.

"It's okay," Anna said. "Like I said, they're rigged."

But I was already inserting another dollar. Then another.

Then another.

Then another.

Then another.

Then another.

Then another.

The group had eventually moved on to the ski-ball lanes. but I stayed at the claw machine, feeding it money like some desperate gambler. Five dollars became ten. Ten became twenty.

"Trevor?" Anna appeared at my side again. "We're going to grab some nachos. You coming?"

"Just give me one more minute," I said, not taking my eyes off the claw. "I almost had it last time."

She hesitated. "Okay, but don't feel like you have to—"

"I've got this," I said, more to myself than to her.

Twenty minutes turned into forty. Forty turned into an hour. My friends—if I could even call them that—had given up on me entirely. I could hear them laughing in the distance, probably at Scott's jokes or Chloe's stories. But I couldn't stop. The Yoshi had become more than just a stupid toy. It was proof that I could succeed at something. That I could be the guy who came through when it mattered.

Fifty-three dollars. That's how much I'd spent when I finally got the claw to grab the Yoshi properly. My hands were cramping from gripping the joystick, and there was a thin layer of sweat on my forehead despite the arcade's air conditioning.

"Come on," I whispered, watching the claw slowly transport its prize toward the chute. "Come on, come on, come on."

That's when I saw his eyes.

They were staring at me through the glass on the opposite side of the machine, wide and unblinking. The old man's face was pressed against the surface, his nose flattened against the glass like a child at a pet store window.

I froze, my hand stationed on the joystick. The claw continued its mechanical journey, but all I could focus on were those eyes. They weren't curious anymore. They were hungry.

His lips were mouthing the same phrase I had been repeating. "Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on." he muttered quietly to himself.

My gaze traced downward past his chest. The tattered white t-shirt was gone. So were the dirty pajama pants. Pale, translucent skin stretched over his ribs, revealing a network of blue and red veins pulsing beneath the surface like some horrible roadmap. My eyes drifted further down when I finally caught sight of his forearm aggressively moving back and forth above his crotch. His hand gripped tighter as he pleasured himself more rapidly, the harsh realization of what I was seeing coursed through me. His face contorted into an expression of pure ecstasy as he finished all over the back of the claw machine, thick streams of fluid coating the electrical components and colorful artwork painted on the outside.

"You did it! Good job! Congratulations!" The machine erupted in a celebratory jingle. Yoshi dropped into the prize chute with a satisfying *thunk* as I shook.

The machine's cheerful music continued playing its victory song as the old man straightened up, that same satisfied smile returning to his face. He looked directly at me through the glass, gave a small wave, and then walked calmly toward the front exit.

I screamed.

Not a gasp or a yelp—a full-throated scream that cut through the arcade's orchestra of 8-bit sounds and music. Several families turned to stare, and I heard someone's child start crying.

"Trevor!" Anna was suddenly beside me, her hand on my arm. "What happened? What's wrong?"

I pointed toward the front doors, but the old man was already gone. "Did you see—the man—he was just—"

"What man?" Anna looked genuinely confused. "Trevor, you're shaking. What's going on?"

"The old man from earlier," I said, my voice cracking slightly. "He was just... he was behind the machine and he—"

"I don't know what old man you're talking about," Anna interrupted. Her expression shifted from concern to something else. Something colder. "Is this another one of your jabs at Scott's age?"

"What? No, I—" The confusion must have been written all over my face. "You didn't see him? He was standing right there when Scott came in. The guy in the dirty clothes?"

Anna stared at me for a long moment. "Trevor, there was no old man. It's been just us and a few other families all night."

The realization hit me like ice water. She hadn't seen him. Not at the entrance, not during the games, not at the claw machine. None of them had seen him.

I looked behind the machine and it was completely dry. No trace of him was left.

"I need to use the bathroom," I mumbled, grabbing the Yoshi from the prize chute and shoving it into my jacket pocket. "I'll be right back."

Anna watched me go with an expression I couldn't quite read. Worry, maybe. Or the dawning recognition that the guy from her building might not be as normal as she'd hoped.

The rest of the night passed in a blur. I smiled when I was supposed to smile, laughed when I was supposed to laugh, and tried to pretend that I hadn't just had a complete mental breakdown in front of a claw machine. But I could feel Anna watching me, and I could see the way Scott's easy confidence made her light up in ways my forced enthusiasm never could.

By the time we left Murphy's, I felt like a stranger in my own skin.

The drive back to our building was quiet.

We pulled up to the apartment and parked. Feeling a rush of embarrassment over the night, I gave her a quick, “Thank you for everything” before jumping out of the car and heading toward my front door.

"Wait," she opened her door and walked toward me. "Are you okay? It felt like you kind of shut off at some point tonight…” there was a genuine concern in her voice. Maybe she did care.

“Oh, I’m fine. I just haven’t been around… people in a little while.” I thought I could sprinkle a little truth into my lie so it would seem more believable. “It took some adjusting. But as far as people go, those people were pretty cool.”

She giggled at my phrasing.

This was my moment. The moment I'd been building toward all night.

"Actually," I said, reaching into my jacket pocket. "I have something for you. Close your eyes."

Anna hesitated for a fraction of a second before complying. "Trevor, you really didn't have to—"

"Trust me," I said, pulling out the Yoshi plushie. "Okay, open them."

Her eyes fluttered open, and I watched her face cycle through several emotions—surprise, confusion, and something that could’ve been misconstrued as discomfort.

"This is what you were doing for that entire hour?" she asked, taking the plushie from my hands. "Trevor, I... this is really sweet, but you didn't need to spend all that money. I was fine without it."

"I wanted to," I said, and before I could second-guess myself, I leaned forward and kissed her.

For a moment, time stopped. Her lips were soft and warm, and she smelled like vanilla perfume. This was it. This was the moment everything would change between us.

But she wasn't kissing me back.

She wasn't moving at all.

I pulled away to find her staring at me with wide eyes, her body rigid with what I told myself was surprise. Maybe nervousness. Some people freeze up when they're overwhelmed with emotion, I had been there before.

"Anna?" I said softly. "You okay?"

She blinked several times, as if coming out of a trance. "I should... I should go inside. Thank you for the Yoshi. Really."

She practically bolted up the stairs, clutching the plushie to her chest. I watched her disappear through the building's front door without looking back.

But I felt incredible. Euphoric, even. Sure, she'd been a little shocked—maybe she hadn't expected me to be so bold. But I'd done it. I'd actually kissed Anna, and the world hadn't ended.

I walked toward my apartment building practically floating on air. The night hadn't gone exactly as planned, but it had ended better than I'd dared to hope. Anna probably just needed time to process what had happened between us. By tomorrow, she'd be texting me about our follow up plans.

I pulled out my keys and inserted them into the lock, already planning what I'd wear on our first *official* date.

The key turned, but there was no click. No resistance at all.

The door was already unlocked.

I stood there for a moment, key in hand, trying to make sense of it. I was absolutely certain I'd locked it before leaving. I'd checked it twice, just like my mom used to do.

Maybe the lock is just as likely to unlock by accident as it is to lock itself, right?

I took a deep breath and pushed the door open.

The old man was standing in my living room.

My skin crawled as I stared at him.

Completely naked, his translucent skin hung loose over his skeletal frame, he held an electric drill in his right hand. The walls surrounding him were scattered with holes, white dust covered my floor. He looked up as I entered, those same hungry eyes now filled with a sense of relief.

He moaned softly before speaking, "Don't trust the Wallflowers.”

He raised the drill to his temple and pulled the trigger. The tip disappeared into his head.

The sound was indescribable—a wet, grinding noise that seemed to go on forever. I stood still in shock. Blood sprayed across my carpet and couch as his body convulsed once, then crumpled to the floor. The drill continued running for several seconds before the motor finally died. The smile stayed plastered on his face.

I don't remember screaming. I don't remember running outside or calling 911. I don't remember much of anything until I was sitting on the curb outside my building, a scratchy police blanket wrapped around my shoulders, watching paramedics wheel a covered gurney through my front door.

The detective who interviewed me was kind but clearly skeptical. He confirmed it was the previous tenant, no signs of forced entry. They'd eventually run the drill through evidence, check for fingerprints, but it was pretty cut and dry as far as they were concerned.

His partner informed me that underneath my desk was a freshly carved hole, about two feet in height and width. Just wide enough for a human to push themselves through, the lead detective pointed out.

They didn’t say it… but I knew what they were implying.

He had been in living my walls.

The scratching... The holes... he had been watching me.

The hot air I had felt beneath my desk... he had been breathing on me.

They asked if I had anywhere else to stay for the night.

I told them I'd figure something out.

As I sit here typing this on my phone, I can see Anna's bedroom window from across the courtyard. The light is still on, and I can make out her silhouette moving around inside. She's probably getting ready for bed, maybe thinking about the kiss, maybe holding that Yoshi plushie.

I want to text her, to explain what happened, to make sure she knows I'm okay. But something tells me she's not ready to hear from me yet.

The police said I could go back inside tomorrow after they finish processing the scene. They said the blood would clean up fine with some bleach and elbow grease.

But I don't think I'll ever feel safe in that apartment again.

I was getting ready to post this when I got a sinking feeling in my gut. As ridiculous as it might sound, I felt the need to go Live. I opened the app and started a stream. My camera showed the pulse of red and blue lights bouncing off the side of dorm buildings in front of me. Almost immediately a message popped up in the chat.

**wx11flow3r\_75:** “You’re the man of the house now. Act like it.”
