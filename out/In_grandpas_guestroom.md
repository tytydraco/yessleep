My grandpa passed away in march of 2022. Me and my relatives on my dads side have always been close to eachother. So was also me and my grandpa. 

He passed away due to multiple strokes, which made his death very sudden. He was as healthy as a 78-year old could be.

After my grandpas death, I have spent countless of hours at my grandmas house so she does not feel alone at night. They have had separate bedrooms for like 6-8 years before he passed, due to her heart and breathing machine which make a lot of noise.  
This resulted in that I got to sleep in my grandpas bedroom when I visited my grandma. I had slept there multiple times before and I slept like a baby in that room. 

But then there was this night. My grandma had made me some pancakes for dinner and then we watched her favorite sport; handball before it was time for bed. I do not remember what teams that played against each other, but the game ended 44-19. My grandma mumbled ”Hmm, that is weird”. I did not know that she meant but I did not think much of it.

However, I brushed my teeth and washed my face before I got in to bed. When I washed my face I got a sudden feeling that someone was watching me. My grandma had already gotten into her bed so it could not be her. I’m used to that feeling from living at a ”haunted” farm, but this feeling was not scary. I thought it was weird but I did not think more about it. Went to bed and had the best sleep in so long. 

Fast forward, about 2 months later, I slept at her house again, in the same room. This time it was a special reason for it. This day it was 1 year after he had passed so I wanted to make my grandma company in the house that night. Same night routine as before but this time I took a shower before bedtime. As I shampooed my hair with lather in my whole hair and face, I got this extreme pain in the back of my head. It only lasted for like 15 seconds but that was the worst pain I have ever felt. I finished my shower and got to bed. 

I woke up at 4:19 am wide awake with a weird feeling in my spine. I always lay with my face facing the wall so my back was pointed out in the room. I could not really tell what the feeling was at first, but then I remembered… 

When I was little, me and my grandpa would always sleep in the same bed as he told me childhood stories and scratched my back while I was trying to fall asleep. The feeling I felt on my spine was the exact same feeling of when he scratched my back 13 years ago.

Now all puzzle pieces fell together. The score of the handball game, the feeling of being watched and the pain in my head. My grandpa was born in 1944. He would always keep an eye on me when I played with water as a child. And I can just assume that the pain I felt in my head was the pain he felt when he got his strokes. 

I felt calm and warm when I felt the weird feeling in my spine. I just said ”Hi grandpa” and the feeling in my spine stopped. I do not think that I made him sad or angry. I just think that he wanted me to know that he is still with us somehow. And when he got the confirmation that I felt him, he felt satisfied. 

I miss him everyday and not a day goes by that I do not think about him. 

Rest easy grandpa
