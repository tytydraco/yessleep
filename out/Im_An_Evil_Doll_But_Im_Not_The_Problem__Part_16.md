Did you miss me versus the Temu toys?

Get caught up

I’m flying high on scraps of soul and the rare feeling of victory. 

I did it, I didn’t watch it, I didn’t help, I saved that little girl, I stopped that cutesy cavalcade of carnage. Not Leo or Mike, me. 

As sick as it might sound, in the midst of this horror and evil, it feels good. 

But I’m not done, not by a long shot. Whatever is holed up in the attic, was just using the toys as guard dogs. 

My brain flickers with snippets of the children’s lives, the last fleeting glimpses of what was fused with the mob. 

Flames still cling to books and furnishings, but they’re dim, ember fueled things. The floor wet with long dead blood and gore should stop it from spreading. 

And if not? I don’t see anyone wanting to return to this place any time soon. Maybe it’s best if it becomes a pile of ash. 

To say getting into an attic is old hat for me would be an understatement. But when I get there, what I see makes my base of operations look like grandma’s pantry. 

Bare skull to the air I smell the rot and disease. Food mostly, but also the kind of wet leaf and sulphur reek of decaying flesh. 

There’s a makeshift workbench in one corner of the room, strewn on it are an assortment of cheap firearms, knives and other weaponry. A simple green sleeping bag nearby, discarded junkfood and takeout containers surround it like a nest. 

Backpacks and duffel bags are all around the room, a small man, about 5 foot seven sits watching the chaos outside through a small hole cut through the roof.

By the sounds of things, it’s starting to wind down. Which I can understand. There’s only so many bodies, and at the end of the day, all but the biggest lunatics tend to value their own lives. It’s becoming a stalemate. 

Hopefully. 

The alternative is one side is just about dead, and if that’s the case, It’s going to be ours. 

I’m feeling invincible, the strength running through me is absolutely enough to take out some paramilitary freak. 

Last time I talked about how the world was metaphorically my weapon. But as I creep up behind the twisted little sniper I’m faced with an interesting conundrum. 

 My world is literally weapons.

Lucky day, I guess. 

I grab a wide bladed combat knife, easily wielding the carbon steel tool. That voice inside , that part of me that revels in violence has a million ways it wants me to flense and flay the coward in front of me.  But I know time is short. 

He's wearing a brown three quarter length leather jacket, I can’t describe the style. It’s somewhere between wild west and Temu tactical. 

He has a black, worn baseball cap on, its brim full of tiny slash marks. A tally of some form. Underneath is long, greasy, brown hair framing a face I can’t quite see as I stand behind him. 

I drive the knife into the back of the baseball cap, burying it to the handle right above the plastic fitting. I repeat this, and for good measure jam the blade through the man’s spine, into his heart and twist. 

I see no innocence in this person, I feel no guilt, brutal as what I do is, he deserves it. 

“That make you feel better?” The man says, his raspy voice having just a bit of a country accent. Texas maybe. 

I look, and besides a torn jacket, nothing I did left a lasting impression. 

But I’ve seen this before, and you know what they say, “ If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.”. 

The man stands, and my swing is about half way to severing his leg at the knee when he says, “ Stop.”.

And I do. 

No urging from that dark part of me helps.  No desperate, panic, fear stoked  attempts to move my frozen limbs work. 

The man turns, his face not quite undead, but a long way from living. Sunken, red eyes, a weeping, open sore, and teeth like a disused graveyard. 

“I was wondering what was causing all the ruckus downstairs. “ the grey skinned man begins, studying me, “ My word, you’re a custom job ain’t you?” 

“Who are you?” I ask, trying to buy time. 

“Polite folk would have made introductions before putting a pig-sticker in the back of my head. 

But I’m a forgiving sort. 

William Meridian, hired gun , at your service.” The thing smiles, adding “ Hop up on the table if you will. “ 

My mind rages against it, I try to cling to fear, shame, desperation, but the control he’s exerting over me isn’t some kind of hypnosis, it’s something, more. 

In a few seconds I find myself laying on his workbench surrounded by weaponry. The symbolism isn’t lost on me. 

“Kill me if you want, my friends are going to put an end to the Bishop’s cult. “ I say in an attempt to be defiant. 

William laughs, a long dry chortle.

“Not my ranch, not my horses half-pint. 

That’s the whole ‘ hired’ part of ‘ hired gun’. I’m here because I’ve been paid well. That, and an opportunity to reunite with the clown down there.  In fact, I wish you fellas the best of luck. That Dutch weirdo gives me the willies. 

But the problem is, you broke a whole mess of expensive kit downstairs. I’m getting paid, but I can’t exactly write things off as business expenses, can I?” William says. 

 “You don’t get paid any more for working harder. Why not just let things play out at this point? Screw the Bishop.” I say, trying to bargain. 

“I’m with you on that one Hoss. That ol’ boy, he’s messing around with things well above his pay grade. 

And if you ask me, he’s all hat, no cattle. Not a good combination with his particular… aspirations. 

Listen though, this isn’t personal. And hell, you’ll probably like working with me. “ William says, bringing out a small, wooden case. 

He opens it, inside is a selection of tools I can’t even try to name. He pulls out a long thin thing that looks like an awl, he begins to prod where my metallic skull meets my neck. 

“I’m not trying to be brave here, just stating facts. 

Are you planning on piloting me the entire time? If not, seems like you’re putting an awful lot of faith in me doing what you want. If so, I’m nothing special, superglue any gun here to something that can move and it’s scarier than I am. “ I negotiate. 

William brings his face low and close to mine, with a twist of the awl like tool my skull snaps shut. William grins, I’m glad I can no longer smell what passes for his breath. 

“ Maybe I need to explain some things. 

The world is sick, half-pint. You can see it, you just don’t know it. 

With every day that passes, things make a little bit less sense. Look at the kind bullshit stalking the dark nowadays. 

Weird, is what I’m saying. Moving pictures that want to kill you, critters with pun names spilling blood, a peckerwood named Jeff that has a whole generation pissing themselves. 

The farther back you go, the more simple, more powerful things were. A man that could turn into a wolf, the spirits of the dead, or even, a man who can talk to weapons. “ William’s grin tells me he’s speaking of himself, though I’d have picked it up otherwise. 

“Why side with evil then? Seems like there’s plenty of weapons on either side.” I say, trying to buy time. 

William slaps the table, then points at me excitedly. 

“See, great minds think alike. 

I’ll hop the fence from time to time. Love me some war, join up with the black hats, they’re doing the most vile things on earth. Join up with the white hats, you get to do worse, to the black hats. 

But the problem is, I don’t just talk to shooting irons and ice picks. I understand them, I relate to them.” 

He walks away from the table, and pulls out a large Ziploc bag with a boxy pistol inside. 

He puts his face into the bag, inhaling it like a sack of pot. 

He gingerly takes the weapon out of the Ziploc bag, a look of elation washing over his face. 

“Just a touch, and I know everything about one. Every kill, every flaw, I understand every atom of it. “ He smiles, holding the gun, the slide cocks itself, “If somethings spilled enough blood, I can even give it a little ‘get up and go’.”

“Ransom me then, my friends down there are sitting on all kinds of weird equipment. “ I suggest. 

William hovers a yellow-nailed finger an inch or so above my chest. 

 “But I never owned something that can think for itself. Something with a real mind, not anything I could control anyway. “ William leads. 

“But it’s a catch 22, isn’t it? I’ll walk myself into traffic if you give me half a chance. I’d rather deal with that than killing innocent people. Tap my forehead and tell me if I’m lying. “ I dare. 

William’s grin gets wider. 

“I’ve no doubt you would. But you might want to think that through a little more. 

I’ve seen wars from revolutionary to Iraq. I’ve been around a long time. No kin, friends are long dead. 

You though, you’re just a young buck, maybe twenty or thirty when you got killed, another ten or  twenty like this, give or take. 

You’ve got people still living. Not those roughnecks trading lead, but soft folks. Brothers, sisters, parents ,hell, maybe a kid or two.

I’ll know all about each of them, and if you so much as miss one note when I ask you to dance to my tune, I’ll know them *inside * and out. “ William holds his finger above me like the sword of Damocles. 

 I’ve thought of my past life, even caught glimpses of it, but this is the first time the possibility of harm to people I knew has entered my mind. 

Panic and fear for family I don’t even know floods through me. You’d think my lack of memory would be a blessing, but my mind goes to some dark places, no solid information to anchor itself. 

William slowly brings one yellowed nail down, grinning, enjoying my struggles. I can manage to twitch, to scream, but not much else. 

When he makes contact I feel nothing, but the look of intrigue and joy on the withered old revenant’s face tells me all I need to know. 

“Oh, don’t that beat all. I know your story, but you don’t. God loves himself a joke, doesn’t he?” William turns, setting out two black, shining bladed tools , and opening my skull case with the awl, “ All I’m going to do is a little tune up. 

Interesting thing about objects like you is that your hardy as all get out. Need to nearly grind you to dust to stop you. 

No going into shock, no blood loss, never damage, anything like that. Lucky in a way. 

But in others, you drew the short straw. “

William leaves the statement unfinished as we hear a loud noise. He walks over to a tall curtained window cracking it slightly. 

Whatever hold he had on me I know I can figure it out, I just need more time. My scant muscles strain as I try to control the random twitches I’m capable of. 

“Son of a bitch!” William shouts, quickly turning away from the window, hands on his eyes. 

There’s a smell of ozone, I catch a glimpse outside, the sun is threatening on the horizon. 

Small wisps of smoke hang on William’s face as he gingerly inches toward the curtain, closing it. 

“Time flies when you’re having fun, don’t it? Best thing on earth is loving your job.” William rummages through another duffle bag, pulling out some kind of jury-rigged zip-gun. He holds it, looking like an addict taking a hit for a moment, before aiming it out of the crude hole on the other side of the house and firing. 

In the distance I hear a scream. 

“Looks like we need to get moseying here half-pint. Suns up guns up is my motto. “ William walks toward me, eyes bloodshot and bleeding. 

He picks up one of the bladed tools, cutting deftly through my flesh, and tapping the remnants of my actual skull. 

“Clock the fuck out man, why take the chance of getting caught up out there?” I beg. 

“Among my many talents is a damn fine internal clock. I’ve got seven minutes before sunrise proper. 

Plenty of time to re-arrange the furniture in your attic and get back on the dusty trail. “ William says, picking up a flat, small chisel from his case. 

I can’t describe the pain as he begins to pry up a part of my skull. On a physical level, it’s nothing I should be able to survive. A brutal pressure filled, blinding tension. And in some other, more esoteric sense, I feel, violated. 

It’s the end, I’ve just about got one hand listening to half of my commands, and this lunatic is a couple centimetres away from plucking out all of the parts of me that matter. 

In this moment of acceptance, the monster is nowhere to be found. It’s much easier to try and move now, but what’s the point? I can’t hurt William, I can’t get away, all I can do is try and go out with a little dignity. 

“Don’t move!” I hear a familiar, young voice say. 

My heart sinks, moreso when I hear the extremely laboured cocking of a pistol, then said pistol being dropped, then picked back up. 

William grins, casually taking a hooked brush knife from the table, and advancing toward the girl. 

“Run, for god sake!” I scream, of course Alex doesn’t understand. 

“That would have been the smart thing to do. “ William answers me, “ Now, miss, I’m a bit pressed for time here. So, why don’t you put down the gun, leave and we call things square?”

William’s control of me is looser now, I struggle, almost able to sit upright. 

It takes two seconds for Alex to pull the trigger, something in her wrist gets damaged, she struggles to hold on to the gun. She’s at point blank range and hits William in the chest. 

He doesn’t even wince. 

Alex is panicking now, sweat starting to form on her face. For some reason she cocks the gun again, William laughs, slowing his pace to let her line up another shot. 

She fires, her wrist going from sprained to fractured. 

William flicks the blade faster than I can see, and in a shower of sparks the bullet is sent off course. 

Alex is crying now, backing away.  

She screams with her third shot, not in rage, but pain as something in her hand breaks. 

William, slashes at the bullet again, enjoying the terror his display of power is causing in the child. 

Whatever William is, he’s strong, quick, full of dark power, and nearly indestructible. The same can’t be said for the wicked looking tool in his hand. 

Tearing metal and red hot slag hit all three of us. The majority of the blade sheers from the handle, taking a wild, arching trajectory. Cutting cleanly through a part of the plywood roof. 

In an instant, a single flat beam of sunlight enters the room. It cleanly severs the first three fingers on William’s hand, leaving them smoking on the floor. One with a gaudy, cattle-skull ring. 

For a second, a look of confusion washes over William’s face. Then it’s replaced with pure hate. 

“You little bitch!” he growls, looking at the smoking stubs of his fingers. 

He dashes toward her, ducking under the beam of sunlight. William grabs the girl by the shirt, holding her over the attic entrance. 

She’s petrified, I’m in the same boat. The situation is rapidly devolving. 

He punches the girl, holding her aloft with one hand. A rib breaks, Alex screams, and tries desperately to hold back tears. 

He strikes her again, there’s a dazed look on Alex’s face that scares the hell out of me. 

Enraged, wounded, and focused on the source of his pain, I feel William’s hold on me lessen. 

I can’t hurt him, but the laws of physics still apply, and I’m still infused with plenty of supernatural chutzpah. 

He’s holding the girl with one hand, beating her with his other, and spewing the most vile threats I’ve heard to date. 

I push myself to my absolute limit, burning through every bit of stolen soul in one burst of activity. 

I leap from the table, scampering across the attic floor in a blur of skittering limbs. 

Speed makes up for a lack of mass, I  take him out at the knees. He drops Alex, trying to grab at the doorframe as we both fall from the attic to the livingroom floor. 

Neither of us are stunned by the fall, as we hit the ground it’s a senseless grapple. 

I hold on for dear live, clinging and stopping William from getting to his feet. 

Light floods the livingroom through the window facing the sun. Immediately William begins to smoke, unleashing a hellish scream that rattles my brain. 

Soon enough he tosses me off, obliterating the flat-screen television. 

It scurries to the door, taking refuge in a shrinking patch of shadow. The revenant looks to me with a hatred born in hell itself. 

“You just made things personal, you little shit. Remember that. “ He says, opening the door. 

He walks out the door, skulking, coyote like from shadow to shadow in an attempt to outpace the morning. 

Outside the ward is barely functional. Members of both sides of the conflict are finding their opportunities to retreat. The sun making the ward’s job all but impossible. 

Alex practically drags herself down the stairs. Broken bones, missing eye, and more lacerations that I can see at a glance. 

She walks beside me, watching the carnage with the innocence of a child, but the look of someone who has seen more than they should. 

“What do I do now?” she asks, voice hollow. 

I walk upstairs, retrieving the William’s fingers. Then grab Alex by the hand and begin walking to JP’s place. 

The scene around me is surreal, survivors of all types, walking wounded, missing limbs, thousand yard stares all trying to get out of this pit before the ward finally gives. 

Sveta is outside, still changed, but with an understanding, almost human expression on her face. 

Kaz and Hyve look torn up, Mike and Leo are wrapped in a half dozen battlefield dressings, and a handful of Mike’s people are taking the worst of the wounded inside.

I hold out the severed digits to Sveta, she bends comically low, breathing in their scent. 

And before I get blasted in the comments. I know, lying to her isn’t the most moral play. But I’m more concerned in getting things taken care of before we have the X-files crew to deal with. 

She starts to convulse, dropping to the ground. Flesh and muscle starts to fall off like parts of a dying car. After a few minutes of what I can only describe as a gory seizure, Sveta, looking human crawls from the pile of liquefying flesh, fur and blood.   

The scene inside JP’s place is like a battlefield hospital. Wounded being treated, blood staining the floor.

Sveta clothes herself, the look on her face distant and brooding. 

“We need to get that kid to a hospital. “ Leo says, stitching up a long gash on his arm. 

Mike snickers. 

“Why go to the trouble? Might as well just give her to one of the freaks going back to the bishop. “ Mike comments. 

“Shit. “ Is leo’s answer. 

“Do you have any family out of state?” Sveta asks as she starts to go over Alex’s injuries. 

“I’m not leaving.” The young girl says, winching as Sveta removes a shard of glass from her arm. 

Even with all of the terror around us, watching the consequences of our conflict, this statement is enough to silence us. 

For the first time in a long time, I’ve got you guys caught up to current minute. Here we are, pondering our next step, and wondering what we are going to do with Alex. 

I can’t tell if we have the Bishop on the ropes, or if this was just the prelude to worse things to come. 

So as always, any advice is appreciated. We’re in the home stretch now, that all of you for hanging on this long. 

Till next time, watch your windows, and look out for each other. 

Punch. 


Looks like I'm getting by, with a little help from my friends.
