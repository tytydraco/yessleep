When I was 15, I lived in southern Sweden in a rather old wooden house next to a large cornfield.
The floorboards creaked as you walked across them, and the once smooth, dark red paint of the house had started to peel—but I didn’t complain, because every day there was food on the table, and every night I went to bed upstairs in my room.

Sometimes, I thought I could hear whispers in the wind outside my bedroom window—the one that never quite shut all the way. Dad always said there was nothing to be afraid of out there, that it was just my wild imagination. And I believed him.

My parents, Lars and Katrin, worked hard every day with the animals and the harvest, while I helped out when I could. It was a simple life, but one we were happy with.
Something that made our family a bit different was that we never slaughtered our farm animals. We loved them too much, and after naming every chicken and cow, the bond was too strong—they simply became part of the family. Dad and I took turns naming the cows, and mom got to name all the chickens.

I named my first cow Majken. She always waited for me right by the fence when I came home from school, so I liked her a little more than the others. Sometimes I’d even bring bread from school for her to eat.

I haven’t thought about that summer in a long time. But sometimes, when the wind is just right, I swear I can still hear Majken’s mooing, far out in the fields.
Now I’m going to read the last pages from my diary—the ones I wrote just before my life turned upside down and changed forever.

I woke up feeling a bit unwell today. I’ve started having nightmares about the voices outside my window—the ones dad says are just in my imagination. When I bring it up with mom, she quickly changes the subject and says there’s nothing I need to worry about.
I know he knows something she doesn’t want to talk about. I just can’t prove it yet.
Someone has stolen a lot of the good corn we had left from last summer. Dad called the police earlier, but they didn’t do anything except tell us to call back if the thief actually shows up.

It makes me so angry! Our closest neighbor is a kilometer away and the town is 20 kilometers off. Who the hell would come out here in the middle of the night and steal a bunch of corn?
But… you can’t stay angry forever. Now I’m going to eat my porridge and go to sleep. Hopefully I won’t hear the voices tonight.

August 7, 1983. 9:15 PM
Last night I woke up around 2:45 AM with a headache, so I got up to get a glass of water and try to fall back asleep. I was just about to head downstairs when I heard mom and dad talking downstairs.

Mom said, “It’s not normal for her to start hearing them this early. We need to tell her.”
Dad replied that it was too soon to tell me about “her,” and that I wouldn’t be able to sleep for weeks.

I hurried back to my room as quietly as possible, trying to step on the few floorboards that didn’t creak, and finally jumped into bed. I was scared—but also satisfied. I fell back asleep and woke up at eight. No nightmares last night.

I planned to confront them about their secret conversation in the morning, but when I came downstairs, they had left a note saying they would be gone all day at the market in town, and then heading to a party at a friend’s place. I had to look after the house for the day. They wanted me in bed before they got back.

It’s now 9:30 PM, and I’m going to try to sleep again. Mom and dad still haven’t returned, but I’m sure they’ll be back during the night.

August 8, 1983. 3:30 AM
I’m so confused I don’t even know what to write right now.
About 20 minutes ago, I woke up to a loud thump followed by a sharp, splintering sound—wood breaking.

I quickly threw on my nightgown and ran downstairs barefoot and sweating.

Everything was quiet. Too quiet. I barely whispered a soft “hello” before a door opened behind me.
Mom and Dad stepped out of their bedroom. “Sorry, did I scare you?” Dad asked. His voice sounded dry—almost mechanical. “The door got stuck. I had to kick it open, we got trapped inside.”
Mom stood beside him, smiling.
But it wasn’t her smile. It was too wide. Too stiff.
I’m going to try to get some more sleep, but it might be hard.

August 8, 1983. 10:10 PM
It’s been quiet. Too quiet. The voices in the wind have stopped whispering. I don’t know if it’s the calm before the storm or if they’ve just moved on to someone else.
Mom smiles more now. But it’s a stiff smile—like someone taught her how to smile without really understanding the feeling behind it. Dad too. They move like they should, say the right things, but there’s… something in their eyes.
They follow me for too long. Like I’m something they’re waiting on.

At first I thought maybe I was imagining it.
But this afternoon, I heard mom talking to someone in the kitchen. When I peeked in, she was alone. Silent. Staring out the window toward the field.
When she turned to look at me, she smiled. That smile again.
I have to stop writing now. I hear footsteps on the stairs.

August 13, 1983. 6:30 PM
Majken is gone.
I’ve searched the entire field, called her name until I lost my voice. Not even hoofprints in the mud. It’s like she just… vanished.
Dad says she must’ve escaped through the back fence, but I checked. The wire’s intact. Everything’s untouched.

They’ve started calling me “sweetie” again. But it sounds wrong. Like a word they learned, not something they’ve ever used before.
And last night, as I passed the living room, the TV was off.
They were just sitting there—upright, staring at the wall.
After they saw me, mom reached for the remote, but it looked like she had forgotten how to use it.

I wake up a lot at night now. Not just from the voices, but from creaking footsteps in the hallway. Doors opening only to slam shut again.
What the hell is happening to them?

I couldn’t find The Clan of the Cave Bear, the book mom borrowed. I knew she’d put it in her nightstand, so when they were out digging in the garden, I snuck in.
But it wasn’t there. I checked the wardrobe. Nothing.
Then I saw it—on top of the pile of winter clothes.

When I picked it up, I noticed the pages didn’t close all the way. A crumpled note was stuck inside. It flew out when I turned the book upside down.

I read it. I read everything.

Dearest love,
If you find this, it means we didn’t get the chance to tell you.
She’s here. The Meadow Mother.
She has returned for us.
We meant to tell you when you were old enough, but we waited too long.
We hope you find this in time. When she takes our bodies, she stays calm for seven days while using us as a cocoon.
Then she breaks.
Run. Please.
We love you, even if our bodies can’t show it anymore.
—Mom & Dad

I froze. The tears burned, but my legs started moving on their own.
I grabbed my little backpack, stuffed in a sweater, a bottle of water, and the diary.

They were in the kitchen when I passed. “Where are you going, sweetie?” “Mom” asked—but the voice… the voice was too deep. Wrong.
I didn’t say anything. I just started running.

⸻

August 16, 1983. 3:30 PM
I’m gone.
I’m still running in my mind, but I’m gone.

When I opened the door and ran, I heard their shouts behind me.
“Not yet, come back, stop for god’s sake!”
It wasn’t their voices.
It sounded like someone trying to learn how to speak human.

Dad—the one who looks like Dad—grabbed me. He pinched my arm so hard I thought my skin would tear, but I broke free.

I ran across the edge of the field. The invisible line.
And that’s where they stopped.
They just stood there.
Staring. Screaming with mouths that opened too wide. Eyes glowing.
But they couldn’t take one more step.

I didn’t look back again. I just ran to the train.

Now I sit here. Diary in my lap. I don’t know where I’m going.
But I’m not there anymore.
I only know one thing:

The Meadow Mother lives. And she is waiting.

⸻

Many years have passed.
I’ve lived a life trying to forget. Suppress. Build something normal, something of my own.
But you can’t build a house on rotten soil.

The voices have returned.

They whisper the same things as before, but more forcefully now. As if they’re no longer asking me to listen—they’re making me.
Last night I heard someone calling my name from the woods outside my window. Just like before.
I live in an apartment. In the city.
There is no forest here.

I understand now.
When Dad (or whatever it was) pinched my arm that final day—something got in. Just a seed. A tiny piece of the Meadow Mother.
It wasn’t much.
But it was enough.
She’s been growing inside me ever since. Slowly.
Almost like she didn’t want to be discovered too early.

For years I’ve had nightmares about the field. About Majken. About Mom’s eyes when they suddenly lost all emotion.
But only now do I feel something actually moving inside.
Something that isn’t mine.

I know I won’t make it. That’s why I’m writing this. So someone will know what happens when she finally takes over.
Maybe she already has.

I try to remember what it felt like to be a child, before everything.
But all I see when I close my eyes is a field full of tall, whispering grass.

Soon I’ll go there.
Not because I want to.
Because she wants to.
And I’m tired of saying no.
