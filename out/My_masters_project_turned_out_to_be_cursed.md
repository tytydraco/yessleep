I'm an archaeology masters student studying in the UK, which yes, I see the irony behind. I've heard every grave robber joke there is, I get it. I've always had a personal interest in Irish archaeology specifically, in fact I wish I had gone there to study, in some ways. At least this way though, I'm not paying international student fees.

I ended up picking up a personal project purely by coincidence in September, two months ago. I was visiting a small town near Kerry to see some friends before heading back to university for the autumn term. We ended up perusing the local charity shops, which were pretty cheap and full of knickknacks. One of my friends, Cait and I started joking about some of the things there being older than what I was studying, since I had just finished a module on Victorian pottery. We both laughed it off, but it did get me wondering about whether there was anything there I just wasn't seeing. You learn fairly early on in archaeology that sometimes there can be artefacts and history found in random people's houses, at car-boot sales, and charity shops. Unfortunately, much of it doesn't end up in museums.

I came away with a shabby necklace, and a nearly untouched pair of vintage doc Martens, spending just under €25, most of it being from the cost of the shoes. The necklace was an odd duck though. The 'string' seemed to be made out of some kind of tanned leather, with a series of white beads strung across it. It wasn't my usual style by any means, but it was weirdly charming and stuck out to me amongst all the clunky 2010s reminiscent jewellery. Also did help that it was 29¢.

It was only when my other friend David commented on it that I looked at it properly. He pointed it out while we were at the pub, asked which shop I had gotten it from. When I told him, he seemed to freeze up for a second before averting his eyes and relaxing. When I asked him why, he didn't give me any clear answer, instead saying it was nothing and moving on quickly, ordering another pint.

That night, as I laid awake on their couch, the buzzing of an electrical box keeping me awake, the necklace crossed my mind again. I was still wearing it, since it was fairly loose, and I was a little worried about breaking it in the process of removal. I hadn't been sleeping well, on account of being on a couch, but after I did eventually fall asleep, I began to wish that I hadn't. The first thing I noticed after waking up was the smell. It had me questioning if something terrible had happened or I was being messed with, it was that bad. It was almost like a peat bog, the stench of decomposition that anyone who has been near one will know what I'm talking about. It's one of those stinks that you can't get out of your nose for ages after it's there. The low talking from David and Cait's room was gone, so I figured that I had just woken up in the early hours. The low buzzing from earlier still persisted, and I figured that I wouldn't be able to get back to sleep again with that, so I tried to raise my head up. No luck. I tried reaching over to the ground to find my glasses or phone, planning to doom scroll until a socially acceptable hour, but my hand wouldn't move either. I attempted a leg, which with extreme effort I finally managed to nudge towards the edge of the couch, making me question whether it really was sleep paralysis. Every time I had experienced it before, it had been full body, often not even with anything scary, just the mild inconvenience of being immobile. This time, there was something else. 

The moment I moved that leg, making a small shuffling sound, the buzzing stopped. The only noise now was my breathing, growing heavier as my mind raced with reassurance. *It was a coincidence, you're alone, we'll wake up soon.* It wasn't enough to slow my breathing. The only counter I had was that awful stench, putting me into the same experience I imagine it is having a panic attack in a festival portaloo. Needing to breathe, but *really* not wanting to. After five or so minutes, I started to relax again, although not for long. As my breaths grew thankfully slower, I became aware that the heavy breathing I had been hearing wasn't any quieter. In fact, it was louder than ever, as if it was coming directly from me...

*or above your head.*

The thought had me panicking again. I tried pinpointing the sound but it was even louder still, and I still wasn't able to move my head to check the room. I felt bile in my throat at the smell, it was so close I could practically taste it on my breath. The breaths grew louder until I could feel hair brushing beside my ear, the icy feeling of cold breath making my skin crawl. In less than a millisecond, I could feel a strong force dragging at my necklace, practically forcing me up with a sharp tug. It must have been enough to wake me up properly, thank god, because I was bent over the loo within five minutes, puking my guts out and waking Cait and David up in the process. I stopped sleeping with the necklace on after that. Put it down to a mix of the beer in my system, and the jewellery probably snagging on something as I tossed about in my sleep.

Maybe it was a mix of my curiosity and that night (alongside a few more nights of sleep paralysis) which led to me taking the necklace to the lab, four weeks later. After I had brought it home, it had sat at the bottom of my bag for days before the smell made me pull it out. The weirdest part was, when I actually sniffed the thing, there wasn't anything there. Just the musty scent of old leather. I ended up fiddling with it while sitting in the library that day, holding it in my hands as I listened and made notes. After so long, I began to wonder what it was even made from, given the texture and weight. The leather I could deduce was probably from a cow, but the white beads had a really odd feel. They were heavier than plastic, but not quite enough to be a stone or metal, which led me to wonder if they were made from animal bone. it wouldn't be that unusual, maybe a bit strange to find randomly, but nothing I hadn't seen before. I had a lab scheduled later that day, so I planned to ask my tutor about it then. He came to a similar conclusion that I did, mentioning that if I was interested, there was similar jewellery currently at a local museum.

I thanked him, before I asked if he had any ideas on how old it was. He paused for a few minutes as he held the leather up to the light, looking the beads with a deep frown before handing it back over. He asked me where I had found it, and so I told him. After that, he asked me if he could send it off for sampling. I was confused, but agreed.

Around a month had passed before I asked him about the necklace again. By that point, I had another project lined up, so I wasn't overly concerned about getting it back. I was a bit annoyed sure, I had been curious about how old it was, where it was from, etc. There was some intrigue, mystery, and I was hoping for answers.

When my tutor did finally email me again, however, it wasn't with the answers, nor any results. It was an urgent request for me to come and speak to him during office hours regarding my research project. When those rolled around the next day, I managed to sneak off during a rare break between my lectures.

If I was to be brutally honest, he looked terrible. Huge grey bags under his eyes, a dishevelled and wrinkled shirt, and a pair of trousers with a large coffee stain on the front. His skin was deathly white, but I put a lot of that down to him being a university tutor given all the news stories about overworking and poor pay. It was what he told me that was really the kicker.

After handing him the necklace, he'd been curious himself about the material. So, after taking samples and sending them off, he'd decided to examine the leather in closer detail. When I had removed the leather from my neck, I had asked my flatmate who had untied it very carefully. He decided to forego that and cut it with a hair of scissors, instead of untying the new knot which I had tied in order to keep the beads on there. He told me, that as soon as he had severed the leather, there had been a burning sensation around his neck. The feeling persisted for long enough in the end that he asked his partner to look, upon which he discovered a pair of wet handprints, seemingly stuck to the skin with some kind of dirty liquid, like a water stain on a wall. Following that day, he told me that he'd experienced nightmares, which was when I chimed in with my own sleep paralysis stories. He looked somewhat relieved once I told him that, but the frown didn't leave his expression. He continued, telling me about regular spells of paranoia, illness, and misfortune. Small things, like being caught in the rain or losing your bank card, but often enough that it felt suspicious. I asked him if he knew what the material was, after all of that.

"Human. The leather is human skin, petrified and likely from a peat bog. Once I found that out, I sent for a carbon date as well as contacting the police. The results for the carbon date came back yesterday, police told the university that unless it was recent, they didn't need further involvement."

"And the results?' I remember asking.

"3000BC."

I couldn't hold back my surprise, nor my excitement. "Do you still have it?"

"Well, that's the other thing I needed to discuss with you. The university has actually had offers from several museums for the necklace, but we've not been able to find it."
