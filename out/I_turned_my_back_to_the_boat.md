If you’re seeing this, me and my colleague are probably already dead. I’m a dog trainer in training and work more often with smaller breeds. The family had me and my co-worker come over, she said to not turn your back to the boat. They have a boat in their backyard near a trailer. I asked why, and the mother said that I don’t need to know yet.

Ok.. red flag already. She just wanted me to trust her about always one of us facing the boat. But, we just  went along with it. She also wanted us to make sure that the dogs didn’t go anywhere near the boat either)

They were taking a business trip with their kids as well for the week. They wanted us to train their dogs over the week with new tricks.

My colleague was showing me how to use treats for dog training, and how to get them to heel. She wanted me to try, and I kept facing the boat till she walked over to face it as well. We had to describe to each other in detail what was happening since we couldn’t look away.

The first three days were good. But, something strange happened on the fourth day. The boat moved. I didn’t think much of it, while my co-worker told me that I shouldn’t be so lenient about it.

We did what we usually did. Kept an eye on the boat and trained the dogs. But, I saw a shadow move behind the boat.

Now, we had to walk backwards to get to the house, till we touched the door. And make sure all the dogs were inside by 10:59 P.M., and couldn’t go out till 4:59 A.M. They have 14 dachshunds. So, we barely made it occasionally.

But, as I was saying, there was a shadow behind the boat, and it moved. I asked my colleague to check it out. One of the dogs was near the boat and got a scratch. It wasn’t a big one, but I worried more than I should’ve.

The fourth day was creepy. But, day five was even worse. I let my guard down. I let one of the puppies get near the boat. There was a huge scratch along her back. It wasn’t deep, but it was bigger than the day prior.

We made sure she was alright. Which was my fatal mistake. I walked to my colleague, who was across the yard. I quickly looked at the boat again. There was a tall figure by it. There were two fishing rods stuck on his hand. I yelled to my co-worker to get the dogs inside as I ran to the house while getting their attention. 

You can’t outrun him. He has accurate aim and he got me at the back of my shirt. My colleague got the dogs inside but tried to rescue me. And that was her fatal mistake.

We were both reeled in like fish. Instead of letting us go, he tossed us in the boat. The figure soon put the boat in its original spot, as all our bones were crushed during transportation.

I saw the family come to the backyard when they returned. They didn’t bother to check inside the boat. Instead, they smiled crookedly.

If you find a house with a boat in the back yard, keep an eye on it until it’s out if site. Unless you want the same fate as I did.
