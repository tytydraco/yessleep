I never thought I’d be putting this on the internet of all places.

I’m a skeptic. I don’t believe in the paranormal or supernatural. Everything has a scientific explanation. Everything. Even things we can’t explain yet, we just don’t have the resources or technological advancements to do so.
You might be asking why I’m here considering the above. You are the only people I could possible think would believe me. I’m hoping you won’t so that I can also believe this is all bullshit.

I’m going to be honest, I didn’t buy into a lot of “spooky supernatural experiences” but I sure do now.

Nobody was suppose to be there
Yet, I saw somebody, or something. I’m hoping more so it’s a thing.
There aren’t many quiet places for me to take walks, so recently I’ve been wandering around a parking garage whenever I have free time. Most of the time there’s other cars and people there, but we were notified that nobody would be allowed in the garage during the weekend due to an event taking place. I assumed that was mostly for cars. I figured if I go there, walk around for a bit and they tell me to leave, I’ll leave.

Unsurprisingly, nobody was there.
Surprisingly, something was there.

I can only describe it was looking like a humanoid void, like a shadow had become sentient. Like a backrooms-SCP thing, but those things aren’t real and this was.
It was a tall skinny thing. Maybe about 7 feet tall? It was wearing a large hat, and seemed to just be wandering, like I was, but more aimlessly. It’s body seemed to droop as the feet shuffled against the concrete, which resulted in a noise that was borderline disturbing. It hunched over almost dramatically. They walked as if their legs were so heavy that they could barely be lifted from the ground. While it resembled a human, I can almost guarantee that thing was not human. It had no neck. The head seemed to be detached from the rest of its body. 

And then it looked up at me.

They were trying to say something, express something, but it had no mouth, no arms, but it did have eyes. They were filled with emotion but I’m not sure which one. Curiosity? Fear? Desperation? Anger? Hunger? Maybe a cocktail of all of them. (honestly I drink is what I need after that.)

As it looked at me, I nodded and put up my hand as if to apologize, and ran; but not too fast. I didn’t want to be rude. Which is why I sadly don’t have a picture but I wish I could to prove to someone that this is real and I’m not paranoid or crazy.

Luckily it didn’t follow me. It’s been about two days and I haven’t seen it, but I also haven’t gone back. I’m considering it. Part of me thinks: “what’s the worst that could happen? You’re psyching yourself out. Just go back, realize you’re just paranoid, and get some sleep.” While the majority of me thinks: “I’ve never not known anything before, or have not been able to not know something. I need to know what that was, but maybe I shouldn’t know.

Has anybody else encountered something like this? I hope not. Don’t tell me if you have. Just tell me this is all bullshit and not real. I rather be lied to than have this fear eat through my head any longer. It physically feels like something trying to tear apart my brain with intent of consumption. Please lie to me.
