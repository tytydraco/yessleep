I dropped out of college early; studying was never my thing. I’d rather be a YouTuber than work a 9–5 job. Still, I was obsessed with space, new planets, stars, and black holes. I even had a huge collection of galaxy wallpapers on my phone.

Before college, I worked as a taxi driver. A friend of mine, an immigrant from Canada, drove taxis too. He used to say, “Taxis can take you places you never imagined were real.”
He had no relatives or friends here besides me. Strangely, he never mentioned anyone back home. He avoided social media entirely, calling it “a disease, a circus where everyone looks like a clown trying to attract attention.”

Two years ago, he went missing. The last footage of him alive came from a toll booth camera on Highway 35.
His body was never found. And honestly, it wasn’t just him, plenty of people had gone missing on that same stretch of road. It all started with him. The place became infamous as “Missing You Highway.”

Still, greed made me take a job driving the same route.

City driving wasn’t so bad, at least not as bad as those 9–5 puppet-maker jobs. That’s why I eventually returned to the highway. The pay was good, the work was familiar, and the thrill was addictive. My usual route took eight hours, with a few side trips to nearby towns.

Passengers often paid extra for speed, to break rules, change lanes, overtake. Some even challenged me to reach their destinations twenty-five minutes early for double payment. It became easy money. Over time, I got famous on that route. People started calling me “The Close Call.”

That’s when I began noticing her, a woman in red, always standing near the same gas station. I’d see her almost every day at the exact spot where I stopped for refills. Eventually, I couldn’t ignore her anymore.

One evening, I asked the station attendant, “Hey, who’s that woman? What’s she doing out here every day?”

He shrugged. “Oh, her? She’s looking for a skilled driver. Says she’s waiting for someone who can handle her car the way she wants. Maybe she’s searching for someone... unusual.”

A week later, the woman approached me.

“Hey, you must be The Close Call,” she said.

“Indeed,” I replied.

“Well,” she smiled faintly, “I need to test your driving skills. I’m offering twenty-five thousand. But it has to be here, on the highway. No controlled environment. I want to see how you handle real chaos.”

Her smile was strange, too calm, too knowing. Then she asked if I could take her to a town less traveled. The route was always jammed, only three lanes on each side. She wanted to reach early, and I was to pick her up from her home the next morning.

I agreed.

The next day, I left early and found her waiting outside her house, wearing the same red dress. She looked otherworldly,  too striking to belong to this side of the highway. When she got in, I caught her smile in the rearview mirror.

Before we began, she said softly, “Whenever I say now, overtake, no matter what’s in front of us.”

I frowned. “Hey, look, I drive my own way, alright? I don’t take instructions from passengers. You could get us both killed.”

She didn’t argue. She just smiled again, the kind of smile that makes you forget logic for a second , and tossed a small bundle of cash onto the seat beside me. It was too much to resist.

Then she said, “If not my words, follow my head movements.”

We were right behind a truck when she tilted her head to the right. I followed. Then she tilted right again. Then left. Again left. Then right. Then left.

That’s when everything changed.

Her eyes turned bluish, her skin paled, and she began to fade, as if the air itself was absorbing her. The stars above started leaving trails, though we weren’t moving fast enough for that. It felt as if time had frozen, and my thoughts were being peeled away one by one.

Her final tilt to the right took me somewhere I can’t describe properly. Suddenly, the asphalt turned to dirt. The sky glowed red and heavy, the horizon melting into darkness. She was almost invisible now, only her red dress marked her presence.

Then I fainted.

When I woke up, I wasn’t alone. A faint, glowing outline hovered near me, her shape, but not her body.

Her voice echoed inside my head. “We’re in Andromeda, on a rogue planet that mirrors Earth. Welcome to my world.”

I couldn’t breathe. “Please... please let me go.”

“Of course,” she said calmly. “But there’s a catch. Remember your friend who went missing? He’s here, but not as himself. We took his soul. He refused to deliver souls to us.”

“Deliver souls?” I stammered.

She laughed softly. “We’ve built a new species, but they’re missing something essential, a soul. Your friend became one of us. You can either join him or serve us.”

I shook my head. “No, no, please...”

Her invisible hand rested on my shoulder. “Either deliver souls, or lend yours to us. The choice is yours.”

I agreed, of course. Since then, I’ve been taking people on one-way trips down that route. The unlocking sequence is simple, you just have to overtake in this exact order: right, right, left, left, right, left.

A day after delivering another soul, I asked her, “What’s the mystery behind that sequence?”

Her response sent chills through me.

“That particular pattern takes you to Andromeda — for now. It can be changed anytime by the administration.”

I hesitated. “And what if someone accidentally drives in the same sequence?”

She smiled faintly. “How do you think people go missing on that highway?”

“Then why not make the sequence simpler?” I asked. “You’d get all the souls you want.”

Her answer froze me completely.

“They go missing,” she said. “I never said they reach us. They drift, lost forever in the galaxy, because they’re uninvited.”

“How did you even introduce that invisible lane into our world?” I asked. “How does it all work?”

“It’s a portal,” she explained. “We established it on a highway because still humans can’t cross it, only those moving fast enough can trespass and reach our world... or drift away.”

Her response left me numb.

Now all I do each day is take one or sometimes two people to Andromeda. They die instantly, and I can see their souls rise, translucent effigies of themselves, before they’re absorbed into the beings who need them. It’s horrifying... and yet, somehow, fascinating.

I’m living the nightmare daily now. I don’t know if I can quit. The woman already told me there are many of her kind roaming the Earth. She says they’ll never annihilate humanity , it’s their soul factory. And leaving the job would mean losing my life.

So I’ve tried to bargain. Somehow, I convinced her to let me bring older people , the terminally ill, the dying, even terrorists , so that the young and good don’t vanish at random.

That’s all I can do now: keep driving... and hope I never miss a turn.
