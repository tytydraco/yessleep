I can not believe how amazing this community is! [Thank you so much for welcoming me in and reading my first post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/unieso/hello_fellow_insomniacs/) It’s been a bit over a week since my post and let me tell you my new doctor has been amazing! The sleeping pills he prescribed me have been absolutely top notch. I have been sleeping like a baby (if any of you want in on the clinical trial DM me and I will see if I can get you in! Also do babies actually sleep well?) until tonight sadly. I was told to ONLY take one at night. Sadly sometimes I am so scatterbrained I forgot I had already taken the pill and I somehow managed to take three. I guess more than one cancels out the effect and now I am more awake than I have ever been in my life! So that's the quick update with me. Hope you are all still doing well!

Now, I can not believe how many of you wanted to hear about some of the silly stories of my life that brought me to the no sleep lifestyle (I have been telling all my friends about this community and the name they love it). A few of you wanted to hear about the time I was a security guard, but I’m still not sure if some three letter agency is still monitoring my online activity. So I think we should go with the second most requested which is when the well dressed man came knocking on my door and offered me unlimited cash.

Every fifth day of the month, early in the morning, the well dressed man shows up at my door. He always requests a cup of chamomile tea and before I can even finish my cup I wake up back in bed the next day 24 hours later tired as hell. Sometimes I have new bruises or scratches, usually just a sore back, it's almost never anything I can’t recover from quickly (there was a time I woke up in a hospital bed and not my own bed but semantics right?). The first few times I woke up in a panic completely terrified. I have gotten used to it now. How did all of this start? Well it’s a doozy of a story.

Ericka, my best friend at the time, was having major relationship issues. She was going to stay with her parents for a while and asked if she could store a few boxes at my place. I feel AWFUL admitting this, but I am a horrifically curious person and I just HAD to snoop (I’m a bad person I know). Inside one of the boxes I found a strange book. Normally this would not catch my interest, I was mostly looking for anything scandalous, but the symbol that was branded into my foot when my house (condo) was burned down by my asshole neighbors was on the cover.

Don’t tell me I should have known better! Because I totally agree. However, my need to see if I could learn why those POS neighbors branded me got the best of my logical skills. Annoyingly the second I opened the book there was a loud knock at my door. At first, because I wasn’t expecting any company, I decided to ignore it and dive in. The knocking just got louder and louder. The more I tried to ignore it the deeper and louder the sound became. I could almost feel it drilling and echoing in my brain. The second I made the decision to open the door the noise completely stopped. Thinking back now I guess that might have been odd? Don’t people usually stop knocking after someone opens the door, not after someone decides to open the door? Any who.

He was dressed in a very fine, well tailored suit. It was the kind of suit where you can just smell the money wafting behind the person wearing it. Nothing flashy covered in labels like the nouveau riche, this was the suit of someone who came from old money. I will say I was a bit miffed at being disturbed. I felt like I could get some damn answers from that book and here is this jerkface pounding on the door interrupting that. So I was not the most polite when I greeted him. The man did seem to take my rudeness in stride as he invited himself in. Or did I invite him in? I really can’t remember. The details of everything after I opened the door are a bit hazy.

“Everyone has a price.” is what he told me. I do remember that. He made me a deal. One very hard to refuse. Anytime I went to purchase something the full exact amount in cash would be in my pocket. All I had to do was allow him access to my body one day a month. You may all be thinking WOW what an incredible deal! Unlimited cash!!! That’s what I thought at first too. Well let me tell you it is not the deal you think it is. Who actually goes to stores these days? I can’t pay in cash anytime I want to order something on Amazon. I can’t even do store pickup. They want you to pay, in card, in advance. It also doesn’t work if I go to one of those check cashing places to pay bills. IT DOESN’T EVEN WORK AT RESTAURANTS. Or if I am getting my hair done. I have to be purchasing an item not a service. I don’t know about you all, but I absolutely loathe having to go anywhere in person to shop. So in the end it was an absolute crap deal on my part. I did try to renegotiate for Amazon gift cards but the man just laughed in that soft creepy way and I woke up in bed with one hell of a hangover. So sadly I still have to work. It does come in handy once in a while though.

Lamely, after all of that I never did see that book again. I do know, for an absolute fact, that I left it on the sitting chair in the living room, but after the man left it was gone. Every time I try to go looking for it I seem to get distracted and suddenly remember I need to be doing something else. My apartment (I never was able to get the insurance payout on my house [condo] and prices these days are insane) has been staying a lot cleaner! Maybe one day it will show up again.

Please let me know if you all have any tips on what can help me get to sleep tonight! I am so desperate. Things were going so well and now I feel like I might never be able to sleep again. I really can’t believe I managed to take more than one. I vaguely remember the doctor warning me about taking too many.
