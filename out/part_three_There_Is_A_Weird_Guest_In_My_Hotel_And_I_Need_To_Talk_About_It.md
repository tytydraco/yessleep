Okay so, hi all again. This is where I was expecting the story to taper off. I mean, he was supposed to check out today so this should have been the end of the story, and a pretty short post. First off, I’ll list out some quick updates from yesterday’s post, as well as some work-related weirdness that happened.

My manager texted me about Mr. Weird last night. Basically asked if, you know, anything weird happened. I felt bad for not letting her know what I told all of you so I gave her the basic run down. I wasn’t in any physical danger (I’m pretty sure), so she wasn’t mad at me for not messaging her. So that's good. 

The girl that clocked in after me actually did text me some weird things the guest did yesterday.

1. He called a couple times during her shifts. I asked her if she felt anything weird when he called, and she said “it felt like she was being watched”, but otherwise nothing too strange on the call. 
2. She did say that he spoke to her, in full sentences (why he didn’t with me, I don’t know), but that he was really quiet and hard to hear.
3. Apparently he was standing in front of the elevator for a really long time, so she got a lot of complaints about that (one guest let her know that he was standing right out front of the elevator, and that she basically walked into him when the doors opened). There’s no cameras in that area though so we can’t check to see how long he was actually standing there for. 

Car key people reported their keys missing again, girl after me said she did find them. They were sitting in front of the desk on the ground. They did walk by the desk a few times during her shift but it never seemed like they were leaving to go anywhere. 

 The housekeeper that cleaned Mr. Weird’s room called out for today. From what I understood she basically just said she wasn’t feeling well. 

I was able to talk to our overnight girl about the phone calls she got the other night from Mr. Weird’s room. She basically said the same thing that the PM shift girl said. He was quiet/wasn’t talking and she felt watched. She did say that she stopped picking up after the 3rd or 4th time he did it though. 

A guest called and said that someone kept knocking at their door and saying stuff but leaving before they could look through the peephole to see who it was. They also said they couldn’t quite hear what the person was saying, but they sounded like they were talking about someone.

I tried to check the cameras but it's set at a weird angle (the room that called was at the very end of the hall, and the camera cuts off right before those doors, so it’s usually impossible to see anything). I only ever saw the person staying in the room across from them walk down that way, and I don’t know why a guest with a room would randomly knock on the door of someone else's room. 

Some not work related weird things that I noticed going on. Could be related, could not be.

1. Got a lot of tiktoks last night on my FYP talking about dimensionality stuff. Third Dimension, Fourth Dimension, and a general vibe of “Other Dimension” stuff too. Plus some… interesting alien stuff. Maybe my phone really IS listening to everything I say and type. 
2. Found a set of car keys outside my house on the driveway last night when I went to go check the mail. Not mine, not my sisters, and not either of my neighbors. I listed them on our towns ‘must know’ facebook page to see if they were anyones. Waiting on a reply for that. 
3. Had a dream where everyone I knew was taller than me. That was weird. 
4. Got more spam calls than usual. (all different numbers)
5. My popsocket (it's one of those magnet ones) kept falling off. Like three times last night my phone smashed into my face as I was scrolling. 
6. Got an email from my English professor at like 9pm last night (it just seemed really late for a professor to be emailing students). It was about a discussion post I made earlier in the week. 
7. Thought I saw someone at the end of the street (also while I was checking my mail). I wasn’t wearing my glasses so it was pretty hard to make out what it was at all, but yeah. That was creepy. 

So, onto the big news. Mr. Weird extended his reservation. Honestly it sort of came out of the blue. I don’t know why but I was really expecting it to be a big thing I guess. I’ve been working this guy up so much in my head I was shocked when it happened so casually. 

I was working on some homework stuff, doing research for a project, when I heard, 

“Hello.”

Honestly at first I was super embarrassed. I really didn’t think I was That invested in looking up sources about the myth of the labyrinth and the minotaur. It’s interesting but when I’m at work I try not to get too ‘sucked in’ to homework. Homework goes slower that way, but I’m also not being paid to do homework so, c’est la vie. We make it work. 

Anyways, I looked up to see who said hello and, shock and awe, it was Mr. Weird. Okay. 

So I try to be casual, “Hi, I’m so sorry about that. Are you checking out?”

“No”

Okay, so I continue, “Oh, how can I help you?”

As soon as I saw him my mind started trying to come up with all the questions that I could ask without seeming weird, you know, trying to get a hold on what this guy’s deal is?

So as I’m trying to think of questions, our mystery guest looks up at the camera (the one behind me that looks over the lobby and front desk), then looks at the lobby door, then back at me (this time I didn’t feel the intensity of our weird stare down from yesterday. I mean, it was still weird and unsettling, just not to the level of yesterday), then finally says, 

“I need more time.” WHAT??? EXCUSE ME??? What, in the everloving hell, does that mean?

I can’t say it like that though (customer service always comes first guys), so I say, “I’m sorry?”

“I need more time.” Quieter than the first time. That still does not answer my question buddy. 

“I’m sorry I don’t know what you mean.”

Then he looks around again and says, “More time?” 

I honestly felt like this was going to go in circles if I didn’t try to offer some sort of like, question, to confirm what he meant so I just asked, “In the room?”

He nodded. (I’m going to add that this is the most I’ve seen him move the entire time he’s been with us, which on its own is starting to freak me out). 

So then I ask, “Do you need a late check out?”

“No,” he paused here for a while. I think he was maybe trying to, I don’t know, find the right words? Maybe? “I need more nights.” Which is the weirdest way anyone has asked for an extension on their reservation. 

“You need to extend?”

“Yes.” 

So I pulled up the reservation. I tried to buy some time by like, pretending to see if the room was available. I already knew it was (we are not close to sold out At All right now, slow month), but I was honestly trying to work up the nerve to like small talk him. Try to figure out where he’s from. Get some answers. 

So I finally get how many more nights he needs (three), let him know the prices, and then get started with actually extending him out. I’m clicking around the computer, and guys? Small talk makes me want to explode inside (ironic because that is my entire job), but I finally worked up my nerve and ask, 

“So, I never asked where you were coming from?” Well, of course he just stared quietly at me. I genuinely felt like my insides were turning into soup (I hate small talk so much) so I just said,

“I’m sorry, you don’t have to answer that.” I’m sorry, I know I said I would try to get answers but that was a knee jerk reaction, I felt like I was going to puke when he just, didn’t answer. Like, I let the question sit there for a long time and he just, didn’t say anything, so anxiety kicked in I guess. 

But, I’m not that sorry because right after that he said, “Far away.”

“Oh, like, opposite side of the country?”

“Further.” Um, okay. That’s… an answer. I guess. But, even though my stomach was FLIPPING inside me, I tried to push it a bit further. I mean, that was my entire goal for when I saw this guy again right? Get answers?

So I say, “Oh, what country are you from?” 

Which, I’m going to interlude again here but, if he’s not from America, I don’t think he’s from ANY country. He doesn’t really have any discernible accent that I can hear, but on top of that, you guys have read about the everything about him.

You’ve also made a lot of guesses about what is going on with this guy, and really none of them point to ‘from this planet’. I mean, even after the first post I was starting to lean with ‘this guy is not from here’, whether ‘here’ means this city, this state, this country, OR this planet. Wherever he is from, it's not from here. 

Well anyways, he just said, “You don’t know it.”

So I printed out his paperwork because I figured I kind of wasn’t getting anywhere with the current line of questioning, and gave it to him to fill out. I sort of had this idea that I would really try and watch him fill it out. I mean last time I had him fill it out, I didn’t see him do it. I just looked away and it was done and I never heard him move.

But also, I am being paid to do a thing right now, so I sort of Had to look away from him for a moment to make a new set of keys. I mean, I figured it would be fine? Usually guests take about a minute to fill out the papers, so I always finish the keys way faster and just awkwardly watch them while they finish. 

Can you guess what happened when I looked back up to try and watch HIM finish the paperwork? I’ll give you a second to think it over. 

Gold star to anyone who said the paper was filled out and I didn’t see him move. (and an extra gold star to anyone who said Mr. Weird was staring holes into me when I looked back up at him). I sort of thought, ‘Hey, why not! You’ve already decided you want to get some more info on this guy! Go ahead and call him out on that.’

“Wow, you finished that really fast.”

He blinked, “Is it usually slower?” Honestly, for as weird as that question was, I’m ecstatic that I’m getting, like, real sentences from this guy. I don’t know if you guys have noticed, he doesn’t talk very much. 

So I try to like, laugh off the weird energy he is giving me, “Yeah, usually people take a bit longer. I think we are all too used to our cell phones.”

Which like, for reference, I don’t think that. I think that the General Public loses all sense of knowing how to do literally anything, and they ignore customer service workers when we tell them ‘Only the highlighted lines please!’ as they proceed to fill out everything BUT the highlighted lines. 

Then he scrunched up his face really tight (like when people have to think really hard. Picture Elmo having to think of something, his face goes all squish together). 

I almost asked if he was alright, but he ended up saying, “You do everything slower here.” 

I don’t know about you guys, but this feels like some kind of answer. Wherever he’s from, actions just, go faster? Or maybe technology does?

I’m sort of thinking if, like, I had to go back in time, and everyone for everything wrote letters and telegrams. I would think ‘there is a faster way to do this’, because cell phones exist where (when?) I’m from. Maybe he’s thinking something like that. (this also made me think of him calling from his room a million times, but I’m not 100% sure exactly how to fit it with this almost theory). 

Anyways, I ended up asking him, “In America?” (I think I asked it mostly because of the whole ‘Americans are slow and dumb’ stereotype, but that other thing was kind of on my mind too). 

Then he just said, “Here.” I wanted to ask more questions, I mean, I have about five million questions swimming around in my head, but suddenly the keys I made were gone and so was he. Well shit.

First thing I did after that was run back to the camera. And this camera is starting to piss me off. I know a lot of stuff in our hotel is old and needs replacing, but god these cameras are just awful. The UI is horrible, I have no idea how to navigate it. I always go too far back in time, and the fast forward is just choppy frames so you end up missing the moment you are trying to look back at.

Also the camera fuzz has gotten really bad lately. 

But, as a positive note, I did see him blink away. On Camera. He was there, hard to see under all the camera fuzz, but he was there. Then, in the next frame, he was gone. 

You guys talking about how weird this whole situation is has made me feel less crazy. But this? This is like a wave of ‘Thank God. Thank every god that’s ever existed ever. Thank everything, because this? This is proof. This is definitive proof. I’m not going crazy.’

I was so excited to see proof of it on camera I pretty much forgot to do anything else for the rest of the shift. 

So, even though there are still a lot of questions, I felt good coming home today. I wasn’t weirded out (well, I was, but answers. Yay!), I wasn’t terrified (I was anxious, but that was mostly due to the social anxiety I think), I was just… Ahhhhh. Deep sigh of relief. 

Even though Mr. Weird is still at the hotel, I’m off for the next few days.

I’ll be trying to keep an eye on this post, try to answer any questions or just generally respond to comments, but school is school so I don’t know how much time I will have.

He should be checking out when I get back to work, so I might try to ask some more questions then. I’ll still keep an eye out for any texts from coworkers/managers/housekeepers, and for anything strange on the passdowns. 

I’ll update if anything goes on after my weekend. Honestly though, I’m hoping the strangeness is like, locked onto the hotel, and I just want to be out of it for a bit.
