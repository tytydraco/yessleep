  “Oh thank you! You’re such a kind young man, aren’t you? I really appreciate this you know. I really, really do!” 

&#x200B;

I just gave a sheepish smile as I set Gloria’s grocieries down on the kitchen counter.

  “It’s no problem at all Mrs. Mercer!” I assured her.

  “Nonsense, you took the time out of your day to help me, the least I can do is thank you!” She said, “Could I get you some tea perhaps? Or would you prefer coffee?”

&#x200B;

  “Really, it’s fine!” I said but she waved a hand dismissively, refusing to take no for an answer.

  “I insist!”

  “Coffee then, I guess.” I said.

  “Coffee it is, then!”

&#x200B;

I really didn’t want to stay at Gloria’s for too long, but it felt rude to just dip out. When I’d noticed her struggling with the groceries, I knew I couldn’t just leave her alone. Gloria was pushing 80 and skinny enough that the wind had blown her over a few times before. Helping her was just the right thing to do. Although I’d never actually taken her up on her offer of coffee or tea before though. She usually offered whenever I helped her out with something, although I usually was able to get out of it. She was nice and all… but I just had other things to do! 

&#x200B;

This time though, I was actually in her kitchen and she’d already put the coffee machine on.

  “Do you take cream or sugar?” Gloria asked me.

  “Two sugars, please, and thank you!” I said, putting on my best smile and taking a seat at the kitchen table. Gloria’s house had a simple sort of grandmotherly charm to it. There were cute little decorative plates hung on the walls and a lot of clutter that felt kind of organized in a way. 

&#x200B;

Even watching Gloria putter around the kitchen invoked memories of my own grandmother, (rest in peace). 

&#x200B;

  “You know it warms my heart so much when people stop to help me,” Gloria said. “The simplest things can be so difficult when you’re my age… and time catches up to you so slowly that you never notice just how much it’s taken from you until it’s gone. Like my husband. Oh… that man was so sweet. You remind me a lot of him, you know.”

&#x200B;

  “Yeah?” I asked, trying to participate in the conversation despite not being terribly interested. Just because I didn’t really want to listen to her reminiscences didn’t mean I shouldn’t at least be polite about it. 

  “Oh yes! He was such a gentleman. He would have liked you, Raj. He would have liked you quite a lot, I think!” 

&#x200B;

  “Yeah, I’m sure I would’ve liked him too!” I said and she chuckled.

  “You would have. You seem like a very smart boy with a good head on his shoulders! My husband Nigel and I never got to have any children of our own… but I’m sure that if we ever had a son, he would have wanted one just like you!”

&#x200B;

  “You’re flattering me, Mrs. Mercer!” I said.

  “No, not at all!” She said before pouring me a cup of coffee. She took her time adding the sugar to it, before slowly bringing it over to me.

  “You know… I miss my Nigel every day,” She sighed. “I did try to date after he passed but… well… it was hard to find another man as good as him.”

&#x200B;

She set the coffee down in front of me.

  “Well, it’s never too late, right Mrs. Mercer?” I asked.

  “Oh? That’s sweet of you to say, dear.” She replied wistfully. I took a sip of my coffee. It tasted a little bitter, but I figured she just hadn’t put enough sugar in it. 

&#x200B;

  “You hear so much about just how awful people are towards each other these days that it’s easy to expect the worst of people… kindness seems in such short supply these days. My husband wouldn’t have stood for that…” Gloria said, staring out toward the window. She seemed a little lost in thought. “I miss him every day, you know…”

  “If you don’t mind my asking, Mrs. Mercer… what happened to him?”

  “He got sick,” She replied. “Very, very sick.”

&#x200B;

She looked over at me again, snapping out of whatever trance she’d been in.

  “Is the coffee alright, dear?”

  “Yeah, it’s great!” I lied and took another sip. She watched me like a hawk for a moment before letting her thoughts take her away again.

&#x200B;

  “You know, I did try to meet other men after he passed… but none of them quite measured up. It was so disappointing.”

  “Yeah, I can imagine,” I said. 

  “Can you?” She asked dismissively. “No Raj… I don’t think you can… forgive my rambling, though. I’m sure that I’m boring you!”

  “You’re really not!” I said.

&#x200B;

She looked back at me and cracked a knowing smile. 

  “You don’t need to lie,” She said. “I understand why you are. But you don’t need to. Old stories aren’t of much interest to most people… and while you are a good man, Raj. I know that your mind is elsewhere. Work. Video games. Your friends. Pretty girls… but that’s okay. We can work on that.”

&#x200B;

Something about her tone didn’t sit right with me. Her smile didn’t sit right with me either.

&#x200B;

Actually, nothing about what she’d just said sat right with me. It seemed very… ominous.

&#x200B;

I set my coffee cup down, unsure exactly how to respond to her.

  “Um… yeah, we will…” I said. “Maybe next time? I should probably go.”

  “If you wish,” She said, staring at me as I started to stand. Although I could already feel my legs starting to give out from under me.

&#x200B;

  “You’re a good man, Raj…” She said again. “The others weren’t good… but you… you’re just like my Nigel was. You’re the one I’ve been looking for… I’m sure of it.”

  “G-Gloria…?” I stammered, trying to ask what the hell she was talking about, trying to ask what the hell she’d put in my drink, trying to ask *anything!*

&#x200B;

But the words wouldn’t come out and as I sank to the floor, darkness swallowed me whole and the last thing that I remembered was Gloria smiling down at me. 

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

I don’t know how long I was out for. I only know that when I woke up, I wasn’t in the kitchen anymore. As far as I could tell, Gloria had moved me down to her basement. Given the headache I had and the faint taste of blood in my mouth, she hadn’t been gentle about it either. 

&#x200B;

As my vision slowly adjusted to the low light around me, I was greeted by the sight of a human face a few feet away from me.

  “Hello?” I called, “Hello? Is anyone else the-”

&#x200B;

My voice died in my throat as I noticed the face beside the one I was looking at. A face that had mostly decayed into little more than a skull. And beside that, was another skull… and another… and another… and another… 

&#x200B;

Oh God, they seemed to line both sides of the room! Skulls upon skulls upon skulls! I wasn’t even able to begin to count them! And as I looked at the skulls that lined the room, I slowly realized that the face I’d been trying to talk to wasn’t attached to a living person. In fact, it wasn’t attached to a person at all.

&#x200B;

  “Are you awake, Raj?” Gloria called from the next room. I saw her coming through the door at the end of the room to join me. She’d changed into a flowing white dress that almost looked like a bridal gown. She studied the look of absolute terror on my face before frowning.

  “Oh no… I left the lights too bright, didn’t I dear?” She asked. “I’m so sorry… I hadn’t wanted you to see those just yet.”

&#x200B;

  “What the *hell* is this?” I demanded. 

  “These are the men who were… inadequate,” She said. “The men who were cruel… or demanding… or vulgar…” She shot me a look. “The men who weren’t as good as my Nigel. I had to get rid of them, you see. I couldn’t just let them go out there and mistreat some other poor girl. It wouldn’t have been right.”

&#x200B;

I stared blankly at her, unable to fully process what I was hearing. I was still trying to accept that the kindly little old lady I’d known for the past few months was a goddamn serial killer! I tried to move. Tried to stand up. But the handcuffs keeping me bound to the chair wouldn’t budge. My legs were free, but there wasn’t a hell of a lot that I could do with those. 

&#x200B;

  “But you’ll be different, Raj…” She said, “You’ll finally be different!”

  “And if I’m not?” I asked weakly, dreading the answer.

Gloria didn’t respond. She just stared into the empty eye sockets of one of the skulls… and that seemed like all the answer that I needed.

&#x200B;

  “Gloria… please…” I said, “You have to understand how insane this is, right? I mean… come on, you can’t just keep me down here!”

  “And I won’t. I don’t intend to keep you trapped down here forever, dear… it wouldn’t do to treat my husband like that, would it? Once I know you’ll behave, you’ll be free to leave that chair,” She assured me. “We can start with teaching you your proper manners. I don’t expect to have much trouble with that. You’re already quite well spoken. But the last good candidate I had proved… deceitful. Oh, he said such wonderful things when I had him bound down here. But once he was free, he tried to run from me! I had to move here after that… a shame. I quite liked my old home. But then again, if I hadn’t moved, I would never have met you, would I?”

&#x200B;

She grinned and drew closer to me.

  “Oh Raj, you’ll be very happy with me. I assure you. I’ll be every bit the girl you need and I will take *very* good care of you. Yes, yes… even in *that* way, you dirty boy.”

&#x200B;

She reached over to caress my cheek, still smiling at me as she did.

  “Gloria… no…” I said, but she ignored me.

  “But first… you and I will need to spend some time together. Just the two of us. I thought I might tell you about your predecessors… they were an interesting lot. There are 28 of them in here, you know. 28 failed attempts at love… it’s a little embarrassing. But, I think you’ll be the one who finally stays.”

She seemed off in he own little world as she rambled to me about the men she’d killed.

&#x200B;

  “You’re the most like Nigel, you know… the others, they were either violent, or they were drunks or they had a wandering eye… there was always something.”

&#x200B;

As she spoke, I could do nothing but stare at her, half listening as I tried to think of some way out of this situation. The chair she had me tied to was made of uncomfortable wood and metal. It seemed fairly sturdy. The handcuffs were secured to the chair, and I had no idea how I could get out of them. 

&#x200B;

My legs were free, but it’s not like that would do me any good. The chair was bolted to the floor, making any attempts to move fruitless. I was stuck there. 

  “Florisvaldo, for example. Florisvaldo was my third… an immigrant. I thought he was so charming at the time. So exotic! But he had a wandering eye. He told me he would be loyal, but his penchant for staring said otherwise. So I thought it only fitting I take his eyes first.”

&#x200B;

She spoke about the way she’d killed a man with such fondness, as if she were reliving a happy memory. Listening to her talk like that… I think that’s what really hammered home just how *fucked* I was.

  “Or Theodore. Oh, Theodore was *such* a romantic. He used to take me dancing, just like Nigel did… do you like to dance, Raj? I’m sure you will soon. Theodore used to be such a great dancer. But when he went out he liked to drink and when he drank too much, he wasn’t a good man anymore. That just wouldn’t do.”

&#x200B;

She was going to find a flaw in me. I knew that was just about inevitable. She was going to find a reason to kill me. Maybe it would be because I was too young, maybe it would be because I didn’t like being tied to a chair until stockholm syndrome took hold, maybe I’d say the wrong thing and set her off. Whatever it was, she’d find a reason!

&#x200B;

She was going to kill me.

&#x200B;

Unless…

&#x200B;

My legs were still free. I swallowed uneasily, and decided that I had nothing to lose. 

  “For Christ’s sake, Gloria will you just *shut the fuck up?”* 

That got her attention. She went silent, her head snapping to look at me and her eyes narrowing.

&#x200B;

  “Excuse me?” She asked.

 “I don’t care about any of your ex boyfriends you evil ball of shit!” I spat. “And I don’t care about your stupid dead husband! *Get the fuck over it, you whiney fucking bitch!*”

I could see Gloria’s breathing growing more violently. 

  “You are trying to provoke me…” She said, struggling to keep her voice calm. “You are trying to get me to get angry with you… but I know that this is a trick.”

&#x200B;

  “It’s not a trick you fucking ancient whore, you locked me in your fucking basement with your corpse collection! I mean, what the fuck?! You’re just going to up and tell me about how you went and fucked up *every single relationship you’ve ever been in* before fucking murdering the guy? What the fuck is wrong with you? How the fuck do you fuck up dating 28 goddamn people? How fucking unlikeable are you? How the hell did you not find a single other person in however many years it’s been since Nigel died that could tolerate you? Jeez, at this rate I’m not entirely convinced that Nigel isn’t *lucky* to be dead so he doesn’t have to stay married to you!”

&#x200B;

Gloria didn’t reply, but I could see the rage in her eyes.

  “Y-y’know maybe I AM trying to provoke you, because right now, getting murdered seems more appealing to me than spending another moment with you! If I’d known this is what would happen, I would’ve let you break your withered old spine hauling the groceries in! I mean hell, you barely got me down here, didn’t you? What, did you throw me down the fucking stairs?”

&#x200B;

I could see her pause for a moment, before shaking her head.

  “Stop it, you’re trying to provoke me…” She said, her voice cracking. “You’re not *like this* Raj!”

  “Oh no, I’m *exactly* like this!” I snapped, “I was just being nice because I felt *bad for you* because of how fucking pathetic you looked! But now? Now I don’t give a shit about you, Gloria! *Fuck you!”*

  *“ENOUGH!”* She roared. I watched her storm out of the room, before returning with a kitchen knife.

  “If you’re no better than the rest, then *die like them!”* 

&#x200B;

She came for me, and I let her do it. I figured that this was going to end in one of two ways and at this point, I was fine with either of them.

&#x200B;

When she was close enough, I kicked up at her as hard as I could. The first kick connected with her knee, and I heard the crack of bone as her leg broke. Gloria screamed as I kicked at her again, hitting her in the stomach this time and sending her crashing to the ground. The knife slipped from her fingers as she landed hard on the concrete floor with a grunt of pain.

&#x200B;

Then there was silence.

&#x200B;

Gloria was still alive. I could hear her panting. Beneath her dress, I could see that her leg was bent at an odd angle. She tried to drag herself toward the knife, before crying out in pain when she moved her leg.

&#x200B;

  “No…” She rasped, “What did you do to me…”

  
I didn’t have an answer for that. 

&#x200B;

Gloria kept trying to move, howling with pain every time her broken leg so much as shifted. I could see the tears of pain streaming down her cheeks, before she fixed me in a look of pure hatred.

  “Why…?” Was all she could ask.

  “I don’t want to die…” Was the only answer I could give.

Now it was her turn to be silent.

&#x200B;

I watched as she slowly tried to drag herself toward the fallen knife, although she didn’t make much progress. Every little movement seemed to send a fresh jolt of pain through her and when it got to be too much, she’d simply lay there, breathing heavily and refusing to talk to me. The whole time, I just sat there… and slowly realized that even with Gloria incapacitated, I still had no real escape plan.

&#x200B;

I had no way out of the handcuffs.

&#x200B;

I was still stuck down there with her.

&#x200B;

The hours passed by slowly. Gloria would move in small spurts before the pain became too much for her, but she never got very far. Even when she finally made it to the knife, all she really did was clutch it to her chest and lie on the ground, staring at me. At first she looked angry, but as the hours ticked by, that anger faded. 

&#x200B;

  “Were you trying to bait me…?” She finally asked, “Were you just saying those things, Raj?”

  “Yeah…” I admitted, “Yeah, I was…”

  “Those were some very awful things you said, you know.”

  “Yeah, well those were some very awful things you did, Gloria,” I replied. 

&#x200B;

She scoffed.

  “You didn’t know those men… you didn’t have to meet them.”

  “And you didn’t have to murder them. So… yeah, that.”

&#x200B;

She went back to being silent after that, and we didn’t really speak for a while afterward. I imagine that it must have gotten dark at some point. The lack of light made it hard to tell just how much time had passed, but it had to be hours.

&#x200B;

At one point, I saw Gloria’s eyes drift close as she slipped into a restless sleep and I dozed off not too long after that.

&#x200B;

I’m not sure how long we slept for. Long enough, I suppose.

&#x200B;

She was still asleep when I woke up… and so I sat there in silence, looking into the eyes of the skulls that surrounded me, wondering who they’d been. I thought about asking Gloria when she finally woke up, but I wasn’t sure if she’d tell me or not.

&#x200B;

The basement was silent. The only thing to look at was Gloria and the skulls. Gloria was still alive. I could tell because she was breathing, and because at some point she’d pissed herself and that still seemed relatively fresh. The skulls were not alive, even if the one that still had a relatively fresh face attached to it seemed to move sometimes… that was probably all in my head.

&#x200B;

  “Raj…” Gloria asked me.

&#x200B;

I hadn’t realized that she’d woken up, nor was I sure how long she’d been awake for. How much time had passed, exactly?

&#x200B;

  “What?” I asked.

  “I’m thirsty…” She said. 

  “Me too…” 

  “Raj… I can’t get up,”

  “Yeah… neither can I.”

Gloria went silent again, before meekly trying to move her leg. She whimpered in pain and stopped. I watched her clutch the knife tightly and for a moment I wondered if she was going to use it on herself and leave me alone in the dark. I was afraid that she might do that.

&#x200B;

But no.

&#x200B;

She seemed to be as afraid of what would happen if she did that as I was, even if our fear was for two completely different reasons.

  “I just wanted to be happy again…” Gloria murmured, “That’s all…”

&#x200B;

After that, it was back to the silence.

&#x200B;

I think Gloria died sometime during the second night. After I fell asleep again, she didn’t seem to be breathing anymore. I was all alone down there. And I knew that it wouldn’t be long before I died too.

&#x200B;

I sat in that chair, contemplating the skulls around me and watching Gloria’s body, waiting for the moment when I slipped away and joined her. My muscles felt sore and weak. I’d given up my dignity and soiled myself days ago. 

&#x200B;

I hoped I’d die in my sleep, since it seemed less scary than the alternative. So after Gloria died I spent as much time as possible trying to sleep. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn’t. Sometimes I’d imagine that Gloria was still talking to me, although I think those conversations might have been in dreams.

&#x200B;

I’m sorry if the details are getting hazy here, everything after Gloria died sort of blurs together. Hell, most of what happened after I broke her leg blurs together.

&#x200B;

The days went by and I felt myself growing hungrier, thirstier and weaker. 

&#x200B;

The days went by and I waited to die.

&#x200B;

But I didn’t.

&#x200B;

I guess one of the neighbors got concerned after not seeing Gloria for a few days, so they called for a wellness check. When I heard a voice upstairs, I thought it was another dream. But I called out anyways.

  “I’m down here! I’m in the basement!”

&#x200B;

Then I heard the footsteps coming down, and I still thought it was just a dream. It wasn’t until they’d cut me out of the handcuffs and called an ambulance that I knew that this was real.

&#x200B;

I was still alive.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

It’s been a few weeks now. I’ve told the police everything and they’ve taken Gloria’s body and the skulls.

&#x200B;

I don’t sleep very well at night. When I dream, I dream of the basement and the skulls. I dream of sitting alone in the dark with Gloria’s rotting body, with the stench of my own filth filling my nostrils, hunger gnawing at my stomach and thirst clawing at my throat.

&#x200B;

My therapist said that talking about what happened might help me. So… here goes nothing, I guess. Maybe it really will help. Maybe it won’t. All I know is that after everything, I’m still alive.

&#x200B;

I’m pretty sure that I’m still alive.

&#x200B;

I’m sure that I’m not still in that basement.

&#x200B;

I’m sure that I’m safe.

&#x200B;

I’m sure that I’m free.

&#x200B;

I’m sure…

&#x200B;

I’m sure…

&#x200B;

I’m sure…
