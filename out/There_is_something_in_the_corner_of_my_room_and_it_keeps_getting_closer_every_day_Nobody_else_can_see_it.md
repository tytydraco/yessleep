It all started a month ago. I got ready for bed, and then fell asleep. I fell asleep just fine, woke up at the normal time, and was just going to go get ready for the day, when I saw something in the corner of my eye and my heart stopped. 

There was a figure, standing in the corner of my room. I had curtains up and the lighting in my room was terrible (barely lit up the room), so I could only see it’s outline. 

I screamed and ran to my mom, frantically telling her to come look at it. We ran to my bedroom and I pointed to the corner, yelling for her to call the police. She made an angry face at me, and said “You really had to scare your poor mother like that?” 

I was so confused, pointing at the corner again, but she just didn’t see it. She left the room, and I followed behind her, still persisting that it was there. She wouldn’t listen to me, so I grabbed a baseball bat my dad kept in a closet and went to my room and swung right at it. 

It was dark, so I thought I missed it the first time, but then I just realized that… it wasn’t a person. The bat went right through it, and I just couldn’t believe it. I got my phone, and took a photo of it, with the flash. I was so confused when there wasn’t anything in the photo, no outline or person. 

I looked up from my phone, and it was still there, so I decided to do one last thing, to try and prove that it was actually there, and I wasn’t just going crazy. I shined a flashlight at it. I thought I would see a face, you know, a nose, mouth, eyes, some hair, ears, etc, etc. 

When I shined the flashlight at it, nothing was there. Just a black figure. No face, no hair, no clothes, it was just… a black, eerie figure. And then, It finally hit me. This wasn’t a person, it was something we all see in those horror movies, but it was in my bedroom. 

I screamed and ran to my mom, telling her I couldn’t sleep in there, or even stay in this house. I told her there was a figure in my room, and I didn’t want to stay here anymore. “Honey, stop that! Do I need to take you to an asylum or something? Your acting crazy!” 

I told her I wanted to sleep on the couch and she told me I had to sleep in my bedroom, and at night she even locked my door, and my windows were always locked. I could barely sleep the first night, but I finally fell asleep, some time in the middle of the night. 

I woke up, and nothing changed. The house was fine, I was fine, my mom was fine, and everything seemed normal, so I thought I might’ve just been going crazy, and continued on with my day. 

This same thing went on for about 3 days before I finally noticed it was getting closer to me every time I woke up, about half a foot from the corner. I thought I was just seeing things, until the first 5 days went by, and it was about a quarter of the way there. I was very naive, and didn’t realize what was happening. 

It was about the 12th day when I finally opened my eyes and realized that it was getting closer. I kept telling my mom that I didn’t want to sleep in there, but she didn’t want to listen to me. She kept threatening to take my things away if I didn’t sleep in there, and every night, I tried so hard to stay up, but I just couldn’t, I ended up falling asleep. 

It’s been about a month now, and it is right by my bed, staring down at me as I write this. I don’t know what this thing is, or where it came from, but I don’t know what it will do to me If I stay here. Whatever it will do, it won’t be good.
