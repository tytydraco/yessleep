Jesus Christ, I’m updating from the hospital. Everything that could’ve possibly gone wrong at that rave went wrong. Let me catch you up.

Me and Jah showed up at a warehouse in the middle of Long Beach. It looked abandoned—rusted and desolate. At first, we thought we had the wrong address. You couldn’t even hear the music from outside. But when someone rushed out and threw up all over the floor, we had a feeling we were at the right place.

We walked in, and immediately, the crippling sensation of overstimulation hit me like a truck. The lights flashing in my eyes irritated my retinas. Fun fact: people with mental disorders are typically sensitive to light, so I was already irritated. Then, the people bumping into me and past me made me feel claustrophobic, like I was in a sea of people screaming for help but no one could hear over the screams of joy.

It’s kind of how the world works, huh? The people actually experiencing and going through the peril scream while the ones lucky enough to not go through those experiences laugh and drown out those less fortunate.

Sorry, I keep getting distracted. I need to focus. I went to the bathroom because it got to be too much. I don’t know how many people have been to raves, but a lot of them have no-gender bathrooms. Even if they do, people go wherever the fuck they want. So here I am, splashing my face with cold water, trying to get a grip on myself.

Then that all-too-familiar voice spoke to me, “Mark? Is that you?” I didn’t need to look over to know who it was. I didn’t need to guess. It was Vanessa. Of course she’d be there. Why wouldn’t she be? That sort of shit was always her type of scene. “I—Va—” I grunted out of frustration. Something I wish I hadn’t done now, I wasn’t frustrated with her but with my inability to find something to say. I mean really, I should’ve had something to say. 

I burst out of the bathroom, my heart racing, propelled by an instinct I couldn’t quite grasp. I sprinted toward the front door, colliding with bodies and jostling elbows as I fought my way through the crowd. Finally, I broke free into the open air. The fresh breeze, untainted by the stench of cigarettes and weed, felt like a balm to my lungs. A hypocrite, I thought, as I sank down against the warehouse wall and lit a cigarette. The dawn was creeping in, the light taking its sweet time to break through the lingering shadows of night.

I intended to tell Jahseh I was ready to leave, but then I heard that unmistakable voice, and there she was, framed in the doorway. “Mind if I get a hit of that cigarette?” Damn. Her wavy, silky brown hair cascaded around her face, framing those eyes that sparkled like stars in the early light. It was a sight that made my heart ache. Vanessa was as stunning as ever, the only one who had ever accepted my… well, my struggles. A rush of infatuation and loneliness surged through me as I locked eyes with her.

“Why not ask someone in there?” I winced at my own words, realizing how foolish they sounded. “They probably all have coke in them.” My next comment was even worse. “So you’re staying clean—sorry, that’s probably none of my business.” To my surprise, she laughed, a genuine sound that warmed me. “It’s okay, trying. It’s not like a girl hasn’t had her slip-ups.” I adored the way she spoke, and despite my best efforts, I couldn’t shake my feelings for her. “Yeah, it happens,” I replied, trying to sound casual.

She tilted her head slightly, that familiar gesture she always made when she wanted to gauge my thoughts. I feigned ignorance, pretending not to notice. “You back on the meds…?” Her voice trailed off, leaving a question hanging in the air. I gestured for her to join me, and there we sat, side by side, outside the day rave, the world around us fading into a blur.

I watched as she took a drag from my cigarette, her smile blooming like a flower, stretching wide enough to reveal the dimples that danced at the corners of her mouth. “Yeah, I’ve been on them for about a month now,” she replied, her voice light yet tinged with something deeper.

That look in her eyes—oh, that look—it was as if she wanted to peel back the layers of my mind, to uncover the secrets I kept buried. But she held back, and for a moment, silence enveloped us like a thick fog. “Ness? Why did you—why did you leave?” The question hung in the air, heavy and painful, a weight I had no right to bear. “Don’t do th—” 

Before you judge me for my clumsy handling of this, understand that I’m just a foolish, immature young man, still stumbling through the maze of my own emotions. “But you just vanished, no farewell, no ‘I love you,’ just… gone. I know I messed up, Ness, but didn’t I at least deserve that?” My words tumbled out in a frantic rush, as if I were racing against time, though there was nowhere to run. 

She playfully swatted my head, a gesture that ignited a spark of anger within me, but then I remembered something I should carry with me for the rest of time. We were at a restaurant, where I had made a scene over my food like a petulant child, and she had done the same. It was a light tap, her way of saying, “Calm down, will you?”

“I’m sorry, I just— I miss you.” Her fingers brushed my shoulder-length hair back behind my ear, a tender gesture that sent shivers down my spine. “Can we just not? I missed you too, Mark. But I don’t owe you an explanation.” With that, silence reclaimed its throne between us. I felt the warmth of her head resting on my shoulder, and for a fleeting moment, I dared to believe we were sharing something special. But that illusion shattered when I glanced over and saw her slumped, unconscious. “Ness?” I called, my voice rising in panic. “Ness?!” I shook her urgently, my heart racing, praying she would wake up and laugh it off. But she remained still.

I checked her pulse and it was fading, at this point I started having a panic attack. Screaming violently for someone to come help, bystanders probably thought I was insane. “Help us! Someone please!” When no one came I ran into the warehouse searching for Jah until I found him tipsy dancing with a girl. I told him what happened and we ran out of there.

The world around me faded into a haze as we lifted her into the backseat of Jah's truck. Jah was in no condition to drive, so I took the wheel, my focus split as I kept glancing back at Vanessa. A wave of anxiety washed over me; I had never felt such fear for someone before. When we finally reached the hospital, they whisked her away on a stretcher, and I found myself outside, nervously smoking another cigarette.

A nurse approached, her voice cutting through the tension. “Hey, your girlfriend is going to be alright. It was smart of you to get here so quickly. You didn’t break any speed limits, did you?” I looked up, momentarily struck by how much she resembled Vanessa—long, flowing hair tied up, though I couldn’t see its full length. The nurse was Asian, while Vanessa was Caucasian, but the resemblance was uncanny. I hesitated, caught in my thoughts. “Sorry, I—she’s not my girlfriend. Just a friend. But I’m relieved she’s okay.” 

She settled beside me, reaching for my cigarette, which I handed over. “Aren’t you the ones who usually warn about the dangers of smoking?” I let out a soft chuckle, but she responded with a genuine giggle that brightened the moment. “Maybe, but working in a hospital can be overwhelming. We all have our little indulgences.” 

Her smile was captivating, and I found myself drawn to her, but I knew I had to stay focused. “True, life can be stressful. We all have our vices.” She returned my cigarette, her expression turning serious. “Do you know what she took? It would help, but we can always pump her stomach if needed.” I paused, trying to recall the last time I was with her. “No, but I think she probably got laced. She wouldn’t take anything from someone she didn’t trust.” 

The nurse nodded, her demeanor shifting to one of concern. “Has she struggled with drugs before?” I flicked my cigarette into the street, the ember glowing briefly before extinguishing. “Yeah, but she’s doing better now.” It was clear she sensed the topic was sensitive. “Understood. I’m Amy, by the way. I work in the emergency room.” I managed a small smile, though it felt forced. “I’m Mark, Mark Henderson. Thank you for your help.”

I’ve never really delved into what happened between Vanessa and me with my therapist. She’s aware of the ‘incident’—that’s the reason I’m back on medication. But Ms. Shirley, my therapist, doesn’t know the aftermath, the tangled emotions that swirl within me now. To be honest, I’m not even sure how I truly feel about it.

The reason I’m bringing this up is that Jah and I were parked in the hospital lot, his truck idling softly, when he suddenly asked, “So Mark, we’ve been friends for a long time. Why haven’t you ever told me what happened with you and Vanessa?” I turned to him, confusion etched on my face. Why was he bringing this up now, but I knew the answer when we were waiting at a hospital for a girl who had ended things with me just two months prior. And Jah, of all people, didn’t need to be here. “It’s tough to talk about,” I replied, but he shot me a knowing look. “That’s exactly why you needa talk about it.”

I hesitated, the memories flooding back, memories I hadn’t revisited since my last session with Ms. Shirley. “We were together for a year and a half, and I was finally making progress. I thought I was stable, even without my meds. But you can’t be truly okay when you’re battling something like this, Jah. One night, while we were asleep, I—” My voice faltered, tears threatening to spill over.

“I started seeing things, Jah, and I thought she was— I hurt her. Damn it, I hurt her, and I can’t keep hiding behind excuses. I act like it was the illness, but it was me.” My hands fell to my face, tears streaming down my cheeks and pooling in my lap. Jah took a moment to absorb my words, I could see the weight of it all settling on him. “You’re right, there’s no excuse for that. But Mark, you’re sick and you’re hurting. I can’t speak for Vanessa, but I don’t see you as a danger. You’ve been on your meds, and you’re doing better, man. You’ll never move forward unless you stop looking backward.”

When he said that, a wave of realization washed over me, as if the very thing I had been avoiding was now laid before me. My premonition of needing to confront something. Well it’s clear now that I need to face my inner turmoil and acknowledge the mistakes I’ve made, truly embrace accountability. 

The thought of whether or not I hold the strength to do so lingered in the back of my mind, but I know I have to attempt. I can’t continue to let this affliction dictate my life, it gnaws away at my spirit, leaving a hollow husk of my former self. The possibility of rekindling my relationship with Ness seemed far-fetched. But I now recognize the importance of seeking closure and moving forward. The stagnation was becoming unbearable and I longed for a sense of any progress. 

I pulled Jah into a heartfelt hug, the kind that spoke volumes more than words ever could. “I know I don’t say this enough but you’re a-“ My voice faltered again as I struggled to hold back the tears. “You’re a wonderful brother, and an amazing friend.” 

After that, Jah drove me back to the car dealership so I could get my car. I made my way home to my apartment. I often label it as shabby and dilapidated, but I realise now that this perspective was a reflection of my own lack of effort to give it life. Admittedly, part of these feelings are influenced by the medication, but that’s another excuse I try to cling on to. 

The flickering light in my living room had finally pushed me to my limit, prompting a trip to the nearest outlet store where I purchased a pack of bulbs. Surprisingly, that simple act ignited of a spark of inspiration. The next couple of hours were spent scouring the internet for affordable living room set up’s and furniture replacements. 

That’s when I received an unexpected call from the hospital. A nurse told me that Vanessa had just woke up and was asking for me. I’ll update after I talk to her. I think I’m at a turning point, things are looking up for me.
