“You damn ass! How could you tell them?!” He pushed me to the ground, I stumbled against the rotten floorboards. Some of the floorboards had fallen through revealing soft dirt underneath. “Maybe you shouldn’t have told me then!” I cried out, a swift kick to the gut had me on my side and gasping for air. The other guys stood around looking at each other before joining in kicking and punching me to a pulp.

When they were done they spit at me and Henry grabbed me by my collar, “listen if you had just kept your mouth shut you wouldn’t be in this mess.” He pulled a switchblade from his pocket and held it up against my cheek. The cool feel of the blade made me shiver, the few guys who were enjoying this were chuckling while the others tried to inch out of the cabin. 

The blade made a slice and blood spilled down my cheek leaving a trail of red. “Happy now?” I said a smirk finding its way onto my face. He reached for my neck and started choking me. My back hit the floor and I was reaching grabbing for anything his eyes, hands, fingers, I scratched until I could feel my fingernails peeling away. The guys pulled him off of me and he stood up still seething with anger. “Let this be a lesson,” he walked out of the cabin, keys jangling on his belt loop. A door closed and the light inside the cabin was cut off. 

The pain surged through me all at once, the Adrenaline was gone and all that was left was anger and something deeper. Something raw and primal, it told me to bite and snap and break. The feeling wore away as the cabin grew colder. I reached out and flinched when I touched the soft dirt. The floorboards that were rotten had fallen through and revealed something that wasn’t dirt underneath. 

I reached out and gave a tug pulling something hard with a lid out. Maybe something that could help me out was in here. I tugged at the lid and popped it off. Something foul filled the air I gagged, I threw the container to the floor and a splash of something wet and sticky hit the floor as other things oozed out. I scrambled up and looked for any source of light. I saw wood covering some windows and pried at them until they came away letting sunlight spill into the dark cabin. I turned around and saw what was on the floor were organs. Eyes, kidneys, blood, and teeth were laying about. My legs grew weak I felt like I could puke. Some ice cubes were mixed in and they had blood all over them. 

Just as I was about to throw up everywhere a familiar sound made it’s way toward the cabin. The jangling of keys and a whistle. I scrambled trying to find a place to hide, I slid between some wooden planks against the wall and hope the darkness would work in my favor. The door creaked open and Henry stood looking at the spilled contents on the floor. Anger filled his face as he rushed over and scooped desperately trying to push them back in the container. His hands were covered in blood and his jeans were soaked red. 

He stood up and kicked the container over. He then looked around the cabin searching for what I hope wasn’t me. When he was out of breath and anger he left the cabin door wide open. I crept out of my hiding place and rushed out of the cabin. 

The sun beat down on my back as I ran through the woods. Branches tore at me trying to knock me to the ground as their roots tripped my feet knocking me down more than I can count. What was that? Why was that there? Why did Henry look so desperate? Something in my chest heaved and I realized it was enjoyment. I was enjoying watching Henry look so desperate and pleading. Before I had time to dig deeper Something from behind me knocked me out cold.
