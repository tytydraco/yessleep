The following are excerpts from the journal of Joseph Whalen, a miner during one of Colorado’s silver rushes. The journal was found in an empty cabin in the wilderness near the mine several years after it closed due to undisclosed circumstances. No trace of Whalen or his family was found. None of the miners or their families were seen or heard from since the first few months of the mine opening.

It has been three weeks since the wagon train left St. Louis for the Colorado territory, several more since I dragged Sarah and Timothy from our home in Pennsylvania. There just was not any work in the East, then I saw the advertisement for Bridge Brothers Mining Company hiring for a new claim they established in the rugged Colorado wilderness. I know nothing of mining but my family has to eat, so here we are. I can’t say Sarah was all too pleased with the idea but, wonderful as she is, she supported my decision regardless. 

I knew the trip West would not be easy, especially with a two-year-old child, but all things considered, the trail has been mostly calm. About 5 single men and a dozen or so families were on the train with us. A friend of mine, Henry, decided his future might look a little brighter out West, but I think Charlotte turning down his engagement proposal might have more to do with it. Another friend, Horace, was with me back home when I found the advertisement and I guess he thought it would be a good idea too, he’s bringing his wife and their two children. I will never know how he ever got Eliza to go along with this foolish venture. I had to use what was left of the money I got when Pa died for supplies and to send ahead for a small homestead to be built for us in our new home, it should be ready for us shortly after we arrive, I hope. 

On top of not knowing anything about mining, I can’t say I’m all too familiar with how to run a homestead either. I figure it can’t be too hard, I can just learn as I go, that’s what most people do right? Lord, help me, I can’t help but feel that I may have dragged us into a horrible situation. When I thought of Sarah and our little Timothy, though, I knew this was what I had to do, I couldn’t pass up the pay, not if I wanted to give them a good life. I think the fresh Colorado air will do us all some good, Philadelphia could be a bit stifling anyway. That is all for today I think, it’s almost my watch shift. Thankfully there haven’t been any run-ins with any natives or bandits. I hope we can manage the rest of the trail in the same fashion, violence is yet another aspect of life that I am unaccustomed to.

We’re only a day or two out from the mining settlement now. From what I understand, Bridge Brothers bought this claim from another company whose ambitions were a bit larger than their wallets. This meant there was already an established mine tunnel and even a small town nearby for the miners and their families to have some semblance of civilization. Sarah, Timothy, and I will be staying in the boarding house until our homestead is finished, perhaps not the most comfortable of accommodations. Still, I think we’ll be grateful to be out of this wagon. 

They don’t tell you this, but packing up all your worldly belongings into a modestly-sized covered wagon is not exactly easy. Sarah has stayed with Tim in the back of the wagon for most of the trip, I don’t blame her, the sun was punishing. Luckily we brought the family dog, Scout, along to keep me company while I drove the wagon, otherwise, I might have lost my marbles before we even made it to Kansas. 

We crossed into the Colorado territory a couple of days ago, there is something about the land here, it feels ancient, untouched. It feels foolish for man to try to tame this wilderness, something so vast and ancient would surely fight us at every turn, much like the wild horses we’ve seen so many times coming here. I’ve always lived in the city, my father owned a moderately successful general store in Philadelphia, the things we’ve seen on this trip might as well be completely other worlds to me. 

My mother died when I was eleven years old from Cholera. My father never recovered from the loss of his beloved wife. He poured all of his time and energy into his work, telling me that he was working hard to send me to school so that I wouldn’t have to work so hard just to survive. Unfortunately for my father, I chose to study writing and literature, not exactly the most lucrative of career fields you see. I wonder what he would think now as I resort to back-breaking manual labor as the only means I have to support my family. My father passed during my second year of University, his heart gave out while two men robbed his store. After I graduated from University I briefly worked with a small newspaper in the city, unfortunately for me, the editor’s nephew was looking for a job shortly after and I was pushed out. 

Since then I’ve done all sorts of odd jobs and small errands for my father’s business associates. When I met Sarah I knew I would need more stable work but it just never came. Needless to say, her father never cared for me much. That didn’t stop us from marrying of course, and it was only a short time later that we had little Tim on the way. 

Which leads us here. It's almost nightfall, which means it's almost time for me to take my watch with Henry. The nights here are something else, with only the light of the moon and campfire to illuminate the dark recesses of the wilderness, your mind can play all sorts of tricks on you, especially when you’re as tired as we are. Another reason I’m thankful for Scout being here with me, I can usually count on him to separate fact from fiction out here. Like the time I thought a stick was a rattlesnake and I almost woke the whole camp with my yelps, seconds later Scout was holding the “snake” in his mouth, looking longingly to play. 

June 2, 1874

We arrived at the mining settlement yesterday, the small team of men that the company sent out to make sure the buildings and mine were up to snuff were there to greet us. It was surprisingly easy for us to get settled into the boarding house, I suppose we were just ready to be within four walls again. There was even a tub! I don’t think I need to tell you what months on a dusty trail under the beating sun will do to your hygiene. We all went to bed quite early last night, and without wasting any time, today was my first day of work. All in all, it was a fairly unassuming day down at the mine. 

The men who were here before us took time to introduce themselves and show us around the settlement and the mining camp, the tunnel would have to wait until they knew we weren’t incompetent enough not to cave the thing in. They also evaluated our skills and experience with mining to see what jobs we would best be suited for. Of course, I was selected to haul the rubble out of the tunnel as the other more experienced men dug further in. This was to be expected and I was fine with it, it would be my luck that I would cause a cave-in the first day on the job. Tomorrow will be our first day working in the tunnel. As it is, the tunnel only goes in about 300 feet or so right now. The previous mining company didn’t seem to last very long here after all. I guess this area has been popular with miners ever since the first gold rush. 

Apparently, there wasn’t much gold but the hills here are fairly rich with silver. The settlement is located in a small mountain valley, with plenty of forest surrounding the small group of buildings. It’s rather cozy honestly. There are about half a dozen buildings in the settlement, the boarding house is the largest by far. There’s also a general store, a doctor barber, a saloon, and a church most notably. Compared to the city we came from, this small town was nothing, but it was a breath of fresh air, both literally and figuratively. 

The air here is so much cleaner, which I'm sure will be most welcome after a hard day underground. I received word that our homestead would be finished by the end of the month. The boarding house has not been all that bad of an arrangement but I think we’ll all be glad for some room to breathe.

July 2, 1874

We moved into our home late last week. It’s not much, but it’s ours. We also have a few sheep and a cow along with the horses we used to haul the wagon. Sarah and Tim went to church on Sunday, I stayed here to get some things in order. I wasn’t much of a churchgoer anyway. I grew up going every Sunday with my mother and father, but after my mother passed, my father was either too busy or too heartbroken to attend, which meant I didn’t go either. As I grew older I became a little more jaded towards church and religion in general, once my father passed it sealed the deal that God and I didn’t much get along. While I was clearing some brush and gathering firewood, a stranger walked across the property, in front of the house. It was an older man, I waved a friendly hello and he returned the gesture. We then walked towards each other and struck up a conversation. The man’s name was Byron and he was a prospector from back in the gold rush days, he stayed in the area because he had left everything behind when he came out here to strike it rich. He used to walk through what was now our homestead when making a trip into town, I told him I didn’t mind if he continued to do so as long as he didn’t cause any trouble. He asked what brought us out here, I told him I started work in the mine. When I mentioned the mine, Byron went stonefaced and gave me a very stern and cryptic warning: “Mind where you dig.” I’m not sure if I offended the old man but he left very abruptly after that. 

July 13, 1874

Something very odd happened today. We were finally starting to make some real progress on the mine tunnel when one of the men, Silas I think, struck his pickaxe into the wall of the tunnel and instead of the usual sharp, ringing sound, it sank into what we thought was stone but was more like a clay substance. When Silas pulled the pickaxe out of the clay, it brought a sizeable chunk with it and the outline of a smaller tunnel started to take shape as the clay collapsed. Silas and my friend Horace cleared out the clay to uncover this mysterious opening. Sure enough, it was a smaller tunnel, about three feet high and four across. We weren’t sure what to make of it, we didn’t know of any burrowing animals that were big enough to make such a large hole, but then again, who knows what kinds of creatures are out here in this untamed place? As I gazed into this mysterious new opening in our mine, Byron’s words echoed in my mind: “Mind where you dig.”

July 18, 1874

We came into town today to pick up some supplies and to spend some time with our friends. While talking with Henry and Horace, we heard a commotion coming from the saloon. The three of us went to see what was going on, when we walked through the doors of the saloon we saw Silas surrounded by a handful of other men as he was very animatedly explaining something to them. As we got closer we could hear what he was talking about. Apparently, several of Silas’ sheep and a goat had gone missing overnight. He explained that they had been safely enclosed in a pen last night and the gate wasn’t open when he went to check on his livestock this morning. 

There was no blood or any sign of violence that you might find if another animal like a wolf or bear had come around looking for a meal. Silas started blaming the disappearance on natives, though he used a much less polite word to describe them. My parents had raised me to treat all people with respect, regardless of the color of their skin, needless to say, Silas lost some of my respect after that comment. This did make me realize something though, we had seen signs of different tribes a few times on our way here, but as we neared the mining town and since our time here, we hadn’t seen or heard of any native people in the area. It seemed odd to me since most of the stories I heard of the West made it sound like they were everywhere out here. I made sure to triple-check that our animals were safe and secure tonight, just in case.




July 20, 1874

Strange things continue here in our small community. Silas didn’t show up to the mine today. Usually, miners try to avoid missing work unless they’re gravely ill. After all, no work means no pay. Some of the other men had been talking about hearing strange animals in the night, probably whatever took Silas’ animals, a pack of wolves, or maybe even a mountain lion. 

A few of the others who lived outside the town advised that I should probably keep watch back at the homestead with a gun, in case whatever animal it was decided to make a meal of my livestock tonight. That would be well and good of course, except for the fact that I didn’t own a gun. Like I said before, I was very unaccustomed to violence. I made a mental note to put an order in for one at the general store when I got paid next.

July 22, 1874

They found Silas. He hadn’t shown up for work again so a few of the other miners went to his homestead to check on him in a wagon. They came back a few hours later looking very concerned. In the back of the wagon were Silas and his family, a wife and two children. They were dead. Not just dead, but it looked like every ounce of blood had been drained from their bodies, almost like fruit when you leave it in the sun too long. Their faces were frozen in what I imagine were their last moments, wide-eyed and fearful. 

Whatever did this and took their livestock was not a wolf or a mountain lion, no one knew what it could have been. At least that’s what I thought, as we were all muttering to each other around the wagon, I couldn’t help but notice that old Byron was looking towards us in the distance. He looked less shocked and more disappointed, almost like this wasn’t the first time he had seen such a thing. I looked back towards the bodies of what were once a fellow miner and his family and when I turned back to where Byron was, he was gone. I would have to wait for another day to talk to the old man and see what he knew.

July 23, 1874

I awoke this morning to the sound of Scout barking and Sarah screaming. I jumped out of bed to see what was causing all the commotion, I was not prepared for what I saw. Outside our front door laid the shriveled and mangled corpse of old Byron. I guess I won’t be able to ask him what he knew about the mysterious happenings around here, not in this life anyway. As alarming as finding a dead body in that state outside of your home first thing in the morning is, what was more alarming is that whatever did that to the poor old man came very close to us, and likely would return. 

Needless to say, Sarah did not go to church today, even though she may have needed it more than ever. As I had not had the chance to order a gun at the general store, I visited my friend Henry who is an avid hunter. He lent me one of his rifles and enough bullets to either scare or kill whatever was killing people in the area. Tonight I will keep watch on the front porch with Scout and hope that nothing comes for us.

July 24, 1874

My hopes were completely shattered last night. The first few hours after sundown were fairly uneventful, just the usual nighttime noises, bugs, owls, and the like. Then everything grew eerily quiet, Scout rose next to me, his hackles raised and a low growl coming from his throat. They came. I saw them. Five…creatures. I don’t know what else to call them. They were as pale as the moonlight itself, crawling on four disjointed limbs, low to the ground. They had hand-like appendages that ended in impossibly sharp claws. The most notable thing about them though was the absence of eyes. Their entire bodies were hairless, their faces were mainly gaping maws filled with two rows of long and needle-like teeth. 

Upon seeing them, Scout began to bark more aggressively than I had ever heard him bark before, but he didn’t dare dart toward them. I slowly backed towards the door, raising the rifle with one hand while I blindly searched for the latch to get inside. I couldn’t take my eyes off the monsters that were now in my presence. I found the latch finally and I must not have been paying attention to how much I was leaning on the door, I fell into the house as the door flung open behind me. 

I panicked as I fell onto my back, Sarah must have woken up from Scout’s barking or never slept at all as she was there to help me up instantly. We shut the door as quickly as we could and barred it shut. As we caught our breath, Sarah asked me what happened, she hadn’t seen the creatures I guess. I started to explain when I looked at her with horrified realization. Scout was still barking…outside the house. She still didn’t know what was happening and didn’t realize the danger our poor loyal pet was in. 

As I scrambled to get the door open and grab my faithful companion, the barking stopped suddenly. The silence couldn’t have been more than a few seconds but it felt like an eternity. It ended with the sudden and violent thud of God knows what against the door. I couldn’t bring myself to open the door and see what caused such a horrible noise.

July 25, 1874

My fears were realized this morning when I finally worked up the nerve to open the door. Scout’s lifeless, bloodless body had been thrown against the house after being drained by those monsters. I kicked myself for being so mindless as to leave him out there, defenseless. He was a good dog and a good friend to us. I spent the first couple of hours of the day burying him underneath his favorite tree. The rest of the day was spent bringing all of our supplies that weren’t in the house inside. 

We then boarded up the windows as best we could, and reinforced the front door. I knew those creatures would return tonight and I was going to do everything I could to keep us safe from whatever they were. All the while I couldn’t get the images of all the corpses I had seen in recent days out of my mind. I couldn’t help but imagine our family being the next victims of whatever had decided to prey on our small community. As I shook the thought out of my mind, another thought came to me. It was Byron’s words echoing once again, “Mind where you dig.”

July 26, 1874
I was right in my assumption that they would come back. The sun had set just an hour before they came this time. They scratched and banged at the door and tried to break through the windows in the front of the house. Sarah took Tim back to our room where she felt safer. I was too shocked and frightened to realize what a mistake it was to let her go. Tim’s crib was under the window in our room, Sarah thought he would like to see the moonlight if he woke up in the middle of the night. I guess she thought he would rest if she put him in the crib. 

As she went to lay him down, the window next to her gave way to the otherworldly strength of one of the creatures. This got my attention, I turned towards our room and started to sprint towards them, but it was too late. Before I could even make it halfway there, I saw the razor-sharp claws of the creature grab Sarah by the shoulder, unyielding in their strength. I blinked and both she and Tim were gone. I sank to the floor, utterly devastated. God has truly forsaken me, for what I do not know. I always thought myself a good man, yet death always followed close behind. 

There are still a few hours before daylight, I know they’re still out there. My wife and child must have sated their immediate appetite for the blood in our veins. I cannot fathom a life after this, if I am to die at the hands of these monsters I will do it on my terms, maybe I can take one of them with me. I’ve freed the front door of all its reinforcements, I plan to charge outside and loose as many bullets as I can before they can retaliate. I was just a simple man living a simple life, but heed me when I say, “Mind where you dig.”

The Bridge Brothers mine described in the journal entries was caved in and abandoned shortly after the events laid out in Whalen’s journal. It is not known if any of the miners were still alive and had moved on from the area, or if the owners of the mining company were aware of what was going on in their settlement. The land around the claim remained untouched by human hands for almost 100 years, when the journal was discovered. One can only wonder if the Bridge Brothers knew of the rumors of these mysterious creatures if that is what caused the previous mining company to abandon the mine. There are many parts of our planet that we have no idea what lurks within, perhaps it’s better that way. Byron’s words should serve as a warning when dealing with the unknown. Mind where you dig.
