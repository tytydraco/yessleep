For anyone that missed how the neighbourhood from hell started.

“So, what’s the play?” Mike asks Leo. 

“We’re trying to get our friend back to her senses so we can make an exit. “ Leo says, pointing toward Sveta. 

Who is, at this moment pinning down and attempting to consume an entity that is regenerating faster than she can destroy it. 

It feels like the Bishop is done playing around. The survivors of this latest group shake off Mike’s shock and awe tactics, beginning to form into squads. 

“She’s the one I’m getting a really unfortunate angle of? Tall lady, a bit hirsute, ripping out that guy’s guts for the fourth or fifth time?” Mike asks. 

“You got it Clarabell. You and your mob keep your hands off the humans though. I assume you have some kind of control over them?” Leo’s tone surprises me. I’d have expected these two to get along great, but he’s goading the clown. 

Mike grins, half of his teeth are pointed and cracked. I can’t tell if it’s an old injury or self mutilation. 

“Anyone that lays a hand, paw, or tentacle on me, or my *colleagues* pulls back a stump. Anyone that presses the issue won’t have time to wish they didn’t. 

You have a bad case of main character syndrome, you know that, right? Looked like it when I was keeping an eye on you, but meeting you in person, fuck sakes man. “ Mike taunts.

“Keeping an eye on me?” Leo says, an unspoken threat in the words. 

“Yeah, both you and the beehive you kicked were too busy keeping tabs on each other to notice. 

You think I just rolled into this donnybrook looking to shed some blood? “ Mike shakes his head, then locks eyes with Leo, “ I haven’t kept my head this long going into things looking to cause chaos. 

If that hand creeps any closer to that knife of yours though, we’re going to have a problem. “

“I don’t trust you.” Leo says bluntly. 

“You don’t need to. 

I’ve got my own reasons for wanting to get in on the action here. And your pissing contest with the Flaying Dutchman is an opportunity I can’t pass up. 

Maybe someday we end up on opposite sides of the fence. But that isn’t today, unless you make it. “ Mike replies. 

The tension between Leo and Mike is contrasted by the absolute anarchy around us. The two simply stare at each other. 

Panic, fear, and more than a little annoyance make me speak up. 

“You two are going to get people killed. “ I say, the ward flickering in the night sky as a hail of gunfire is aimed at Sveta. 

Shame blooms on Leo’s face like a drunken flush. 

“You’re right. Both of you. “ Leo says. 

Mike looks thoughtful. 

“ I agree, three fart noises and a cough, profound. “ He says, reminding me not everyone can understand when I talk.

Leo grins, then laughs. 

“Let’s try this again. 

 Can you and your people keep the worst of the worst busy while Punch and I go get Sveta some breathing room? I’d appreciate a minimum of civilian casualties. “ The hero says. 

“I’m not what you think I am. “ Mike begins, “No one who hasn’t made a lot of bad decisions is getting hurt tonight. “ 

Mike then taps something on his collar. The clown goes silent for a few seconds. 

“Subvocal mics? “ Leo says, curious. 

Mike smiles, “But if anyone asks, it’s telepathy.  Fill me in on this ward situation. “ he says, surveying the scene around us as he talks. 

The clown walks closer to the heart of the, conflict as he speaks, we follow. 

“It can only hide so much, no way the Bishop’s folks stay if it blows. What’s going on here is the kind of thing that’ll get the g-men here in about a second. “ Leo says, trying to figure out what Mike is looking for. 

“Good to know, chaos isn’t my thing, but I’m good at getting attention. 

There’s my new best friend.” Mike says pointing to someone I’d have assumed he brought. 

It’s an entity, even from a distance through the growing toxic haze it’s proportions are wrong for a person. It’s a rotund thing. I’d say it was shaped like a person, but beyond the fact I’ve used that one a few times (just now in fact), it’d be a lot more efficient to say it was shaped like a clown. 

A frog-like mouth filled with yellow, crooked teeth. Rotten looking blue, red and white makeup thick enough to look more akin to scales, or fungus. 

Suspenders hold up torn, grime encrusted, oversized pants. Meter long feet clad in shoes that were once red, but now crimson with gore and filth. Holding a stained sack with a jaunty pattern and a seltzer bottle full of a brackish liquid on one hip. Creepy doesn’t begin to describe the thing.

“You’re going to want to bring a few of your people if that’s your plan. “ Leo says. 

“That’d be the smart thing wouldn’t it?

But I’m not getting what I need out of this without a little flair. And honestly, if there is one thing I fucking can’t stand, it’s a clown-themed killer. “ Mike replies, surprising the both of us. 

“Seems hypocritical. “ Leo says.

“No, it isn’t. “ Mike begins in a matter of fact tone, as he starts to adjust his clothing, and check a few pieces of equipment, “I can guarantee that thing doesn’t have it’s face on an egg. Same  with Gacy and just about every dickhead who slaps on some makeup thinking it’ll make their bland ass scary. 

A *killer clown* is scary because it’s both a killer and a clown. Those are two skillsets that require a lot of effort. The overlap, is where things get really interesting. “

Not going to lie, seeing Mike talk about clown trivia and philosophy with zeal in the middle of all of this, is in the top 5 strangest things that’s happened to me. 

 “Horseshit” Leo says, somehow his tone is friendly. 

“Maybe.” Mike replies calmly walking toward the clown-like entity. 

“This is bad, Punch.” Leo says, his voice almost lost in the din. 

“Kind of an understatement.” I answer. 

“Not for us, not just for us I mean. 

You, me, Kaz, we can see this crap, be around it, wade in it, and be fine. Regular people, they can’t. 

The ward is already having to dig around in their brains, god knows what the Bishop put some of them through. There’s a states worth of boogeymen and women crammed into a city block. Not to mention the fact a lot of this has been going on for weeks now. 

We can’t let this drag out, not at the rate things are escalating. This is the kind of thing that can leave a scar on a place. Turn this little cul-de-sac into one of those places people tell their kids not to go. I’d be surprised if some people haven’t already started to feel the effects. “ Leo explains. 

It's a lot to take in, just getting out of this without any more casualties seems like an impossible goal, but trying to end things quickly? Hopeless doesn’t even begin to describe it. 

“What can I do?” I offer. 

“House at the end of the block, get to whatever shot JP. Sveta’s still Sveta, once the deeds done, she’ll get her shit together. “ JP replies. 

“ Is that all?” I say, the houses between me and my destination  looking like a mile long trudge through a warzone, “Death march through suburbia, great.  Strange question though did Mike look a little…different to you? “

“Distended stomach? Happens when you get starved, then overdo it. “ Leo says, extremely confidently.

And with that bit of biological trivia Leo turns toward the new vans and the collection of evil guarding them. 

The Hero wades into a wave of people and creatures, Kaz and Hyve struggle with the swarm attempting to neutralize Sveta, even Mike seems to be finding his place stalking through the crowd. 

Me?

I stand, all but unnoticed, failing to see any kind of direct path to my destination. 

I try and follow in Mike’s wake as he strolls toward the clown entity. Unfortunately this is one of those situations in which size really does matter.

I’m tossed and jostled, dodging sprinting combatants from both sides. In a scrum of werewolves and kitted out lunatics, I’m pretty much an afterthought. 

I’m making progress, but it’s too slow. The fighting around me has a kind of tempo, and with every passing second it’s getting harder for our eclectic little group to keep dancing. 

I’m hunched beside a recycling bin, stray rounds put instant, quarter sized holes in it. But I can’t move, ahead of me the clown entity stands in a milling throng of violence. Behind me Survivors of Pi’s factory and human members of the congregation engage in a battle of pistols and luck. 

Mike steps out of the crowd, shattering a windshield with his cane, and pointing it at the clown-like entity. 

“Well look what we have here. The worlds billionth clown-themed killer. 

Where are the balloons, the confetti?” Mike asks, a manic energy beginning to take over his words. 

The entity simply stares, it’s vile, massive mouth slightly agape. 

A small creature with a  child-like face and short, pointed limbs leaps at Mike. He drives the head of the cane through it, launching the body from the makeshift truncheon without missing a beat. 

“What’s the point, man? Seriously, you really think someone’s going to hire, whatever the fuck you are, for a birthday party? Like your going to be working a gig at Barnum and Baily’s and no one is going to say, ‘ honey, isn’t that clearly a demon or some shit?’ 

Me? Give me some makeup and I can walk right into anywhere, children’s hospital, bachelor party, wherever. You’re a walking danger sign asshole. “ Mike taunts.

No reaction from the entity besides a thin stream of pink drool and one massive gloved hand moving toward it’s bag. 

Mike walks closer, his fervor clear. A few of the entities around us begin to watch what’s unfolding. 

“Clown” The entity says, voice deep and grating. 

“Jesus Christ. Not enough that your some kind of monster, not enough that you’re trying to look like ‘ It’s’ plus sized cousin, but you don’t talk either. 

  Let me guess, your shtick is being the avatar of overcompensation? You’re what happens when too many edge-lord tropes get too close together? “ Mike is within arms reach now, the size difference between the two is staggering. 

From the bag the entity draws a five pound sledge hammer, caked in dried gore. 

“Clown.” It repeats, in a threatening tone. 

“Now you’re speaking my language. “ Mike says, drawing and empting a small, odd looking automatic pistol into the creature. 

Slugs hit the ground, the clown entity walks forward, unfazed. 

In reality, the fight was less than a minute. But with every one of those sixty seconds, more of the nearby crowd was drawn into the spectacle. 

The clown entity is an immovable object. A constant barrage of firearms, knifes, and blows from the cane, causing superficial wounds at best. 

Mike twists and turns his body, walking over cars, corpses and debris as if they weren’t even there. Acrobatics and contortionism keeping him safe from the worst of the blows. 

But even then, every glancing hit sends Mike skidding along glass strewn pavement, in moments he’s looking like the survivor of a car wreck. 

 “I’ve got to say, you’re a damn good killer. But, let’s circle back to the whole, clown situation. “ Mike says, walking around the entity, “ You don’t actually think you’re a clown right? This is all just a work? “

“Clown!” the entity screams, taking a wild swing at Mike, the missed blow sending a mailbox far enough down the block I lose sight of it. 

“See, if you went to college, knew some basics, you’d have known what I was going to do there. “ Mike grins, moving his head inches away from a thrust of the hammer that would have easily decapitated him. 

“Shit, you’re taking this seriously aren’t you? That’s even better. 

You say you’re a clown, name me one screamer march other than Entrance of the Gladiators. “ Mike asks. 

Now, I didn’t get the reference, but the entity seemed to. 

But Mike sees the blow coming. 

In a move that was half pirouette , half parkour, Mike rolls onto the hood of a pickup. In the same motion he twists at a nearly inhuman angle, launching himself from the roof of the truck.

The clown spins in a random, whipping lunge, cane becoming almost invisible in hazy night. I’m amazed, it’s the kind of thing you’d see in an action movie. 

For good reason. 

The clown-like entity drops the hammer, plucking Mike out of the air like a fly. He holds Mike by the neck, a twisted look of glee and satisfaction on its inhuman face. 

Fear and shock wash over Mike, he scrambles and claws at the entity’s hands, but the grip is beyond steel. 

The clown entity grabs the nozzle of the seltzer bottle, and with a brutal tug and a screech of rusted metal, I see it. 

The bottle was a sheath for a massive, barbed punch-dagger. It’s polka dotted paint job contrasting horribly with it’s intended use. 

Mike begs for a second before the eight inch blade is buried in his stomach. 

The entity lets go of Mike’s neck, holding him aloft by the blade alone. 

Mike screams, begs for help from me, Leo, god himself. 

The entity grins, slowly drawing it’s arm back. With a brutal display of strength the creature pistons it forward. 

Mike is sent into the door of a white sedan, ten feet away. His internal organs largely remain on the wickedly barbed blade. An almost comet like streak of blood and gore trailing from Mike to his guts. 

My heart sinks, Mike struggles to rise and falls flat on his face. 

For a moment, the reality hits me. The evil all around me, the power, the scale. It’s horrifying, overwhelming. The time where I felt I was a danger to anyone or anything seems so long ago. 

The entity flicks the blade to the side, intending to fling the pile of organs onto the ground and continue it’s spree. 

Now, i’m sure you all agree I’m a pretty good judge of how organs act outside of the human body. When the mass of flesh and gore didn’t hit the pavement, I knew something was up. 

The entity, fortunately, took a little longer to figure this out. 

There’s a glow from within the gore, then smoke begins to billow from it. Small, desperate flames try to take hold. 

The entity tries to drop his blade, but already, it’s fused to his hand. Metal red hot and burrowing into unnatural flesh. 

Within another two seconds, the gore is burned to cinder, a white hot blob of something about the size of a toaster is all that remains. 

The screech from the entity is so loud, so unnatural, it causes the ward to flicker. It tries to wave out the burning metal ( some mixture of thermite, and more esoteric ingredients from what I was told.), and succeeds only in throwing unquenchable pieces of burning slag into other members of the Bishop’s congregation. 

Next it tries to sever it’s own arm with it’s hammer. But the heat simply fuses hammer, and the arm wielding it, to the increasingly hot metal. 

If the sixty seconds of fight felt like an hour, the fifteen seconds it took the clown entity to die felt like a week. As evil as it was, it was a miserable, pain laden death. 

Around us is a circle of quiet in the battle. Those closest to us, stunned at the spectacle. 

Mike stands, casually cleaning up the remaining bits of intestine hanging from the hole in his shirt. He grins to the crowd. 

From my angle I can see the remainder of the black plastic bag, and the thin Kevlar sheet behind it. I make a conscious choice to not ask where Mike got the organs for his ruse.  

 But the rest of the onlookers, those that only saw the fight in quick glances as they fought for their own lives. They don’t have that look behind the curtain. 

“There’s your distraction little fella, make use of it. “ Mike says, nodding toward the staring combatants. 

The ward flickers, then shudders hard enough to blur the stars. For a tenth of a second the ward fails. 

I’m surrounded by vantablack walls again for a brief instant.  

At first, I’m worried. Those things aren’t just a warning system, to me, they might as well be made of brick. Then it hits me. 

I run ( okay, scuttle might be a better term.) as fast as my worn, damaged joints will take me. Pushing the mechanical and the biological parts of me to their limit. 

That brief flash of my creator’s safeguards, let me know where things weren’t looking. 

For something my size, the distance to the house was like a marathon. No, scratch that, it was a gauntlet. 

Even if I could keep track of who was brought by Mike, and who was a member of the Bishop’s congregation, everything is happening so fast, there’s no time for explanations or argument. 

I feel tiny, fragile, skittering away from clawed hands and red-dot beams, fractions of an inch away from death. 

But the farther away from JP’s house I get, the thinner the crowd becomes. 

Then, I do what I do best, I hide. 

Moving through the shadows calms me down a bit. I hate to admit it, but being away from the fight does too. 

I skulk, starting to feel more in control of things. 

I wish that extended to the feeling of dread and paranoia coursing through me like poison, but I’ll take what I can get. 

The house is quiet, and as I climb into a cracked window, I feel it. 

Death, brutal and hard.

The place reeks of it, esoterically, and I’m assuming, literally. 

I stand in a livingroom, it’s clear a family lives here. Scattered toys, a half eaten package of fruit snacks, and a child friendly collection of dvds. 

Those dark parts of me, the evil shit I tend to avoid talking about tell me there are two people in the house. Whatever is taking pot-shots from the roof, is, something else. 

Slow, light footsteps coming down the stairs into the kitchen. 

I go limp, hoping to blend in with all of the other toys in the deep shadow. 

“Angela, where did you go?” a voice says, young, male and lilting. 

When I see the 18 year old walk down the stairs I know what he is. 

He’s the result of all of this shit. He’s what happens when the human mind is barraged with forces powerful enough to disguise a supernatural gang-war.  

Fear and self loathing fight for control of my mind as I realize my part in all of this.

He’s cut off his nose, whatever he used to cauterize the wound left an ugly, blistered scar. He’s wearing a hooded bathrobe, the cuffs stiff with blood. A pair of cargo shorts reveal legs covered in weeping, infected wounds. 

 “Come on kid, I’m bored, mom and dad stopped moving an hour ago. “ The young man says, tossing a vase into a ceiling rack of wine glasses. 

The cacophony draws a meek scream from a bedroom. The kid in the bathrobe walks absurdly on his tiptoes through the glass, with every crack and pop blood hits the floor in small arcs. 

He wildly begins to pound his fists on the door. Inside a small girl cries, begging him to stop. 

He does, for a few seconds, before starting to kick the door. It buckles, but whoever is behind it, was smart enough to get something in front of it. 

“Go the hell away!”  the small, female voice from behind the door screams. 

“That’s a bad word Ang.” The young man says, punctuating the sentence with a gale of insane laughter, “Better hope you figured out a way to put a dresser against the window too.”

The brother slinks low, like a cartoon thief, almost crawling his way out the front door. 

I hear the girl inside moving things around, likely trying to figure out another makeshift barricade. Judging by the sounds though, she’s not having much luck. 

 Of course, I feel that dark pull, that constant voice that wants me to do the worst things on earth. But that’s not all I am, this kid, trapped in the middle of this senseless hellscape, she needs help. 

I start to try and come up with a plan, but I’m stuck. I can’t talk to her through the door, she wouldn’t understand a damn thing I’m saying. And let’s face it, suddenly being face to face with myself isn’t going to end with anything less than her running in the opposite direction. 

I check the vents, too small to move though. Damn modern construction. 

Then it hits me, a hail-Mary play.

When this all started I dived head first into the horror genre. Figuring I can’t be the only one giving out some truth. 

A pattern I’ve noticed is codes. Horror today, and esoteric ways of communication go hand in hand. Cyphers, backwards messages, you kids love that stuff. 

As I walk to the door, I hope the girl behind it is a member of the tribe. 

Back when I was a kid we didn’t have much like that, but we did have scouting. And Morse code must have been a badge I completed. 

“I’m here to help.” I tap in a loop on the door. 

With every tap I look around the room, expecting some new horror to waltz in. I’m nearly at my mental limit, this whole event seems to be getting out of control. 

But after the third repetition, I hear a voice.

“Who are you?” she asks. 

“ A friend.” I tap out, “ It’s safe, you need to get out. “

There is a few seconds of silence, my heart sinks. 

Then I hear the dresser being moved, slowly, inch by inch, by someone barely strong enough to do so. 

She opens the door just enough I can make out a bruised, horrified face. Dark hair and blue eyes that have seen much more than any child should. 

Her eyes go wide, she takes a step back from the door. I think it’s me, after all, I didn’t exactly start out as a loveable plush, and the hell I’ve been through has done nothing to improve my looks. 

But then I see, she isn’t looking at me, she’s looking behind me. 

“You said it was safe, they’re still here…” she says, face going white, backing away from the door. 

I turn as the weather outside begins to rain. A bolt of lightening lights up the kitchen behind me, and I see them. 

The toys scattered around the living room are perched in the kitchen. Sets of tiny, unalive eyes watch me with a predator’s curiosity. 

I’m surrounded, outnumbered, and with a ten year old behind me that just opened herself up to whatever wickedness these things have in mind. 

It’s a grim situation, and where I’ll leave you guys this time. I don’t know how I’m going to pull out of this, but if I do, you guys will be the first to hear about it. 

Till next time, if there is one. 

Stay safe, and for your own sake, keep an eye on your neighbourhoods. 

Punch. 


Well the house got weird.
