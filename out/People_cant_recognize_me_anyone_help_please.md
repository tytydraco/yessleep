To elaborate this all started 5 months ago, I set a meet up with my friends from college. We were gonna meet up at a bar just to catch up, in my texts they recognized me and knew who I was. Then a week later when we set to meet up, I was taking an hour nap after work since we were meeting up at 6:00 and it was 4:00. But I slept in on accident since my alarm didn't go off, so I hurried to get ready and rushed over to the bar.

When I made it to the bar, I ended up being 20 mins late, so when I entered I walked up to them and apologized for being late but thats when Tony, one of my friends said, "Who are you?"

"Ha Nice one Tony," I said thinking it was a joke.

"How did you know my name? We never once met you before," Tony said, with the others noding in agreeance.

"I am your friend, we met in college remeber," I said. "No, we didn't who ever you are you need to leave."

" I have proof we met, and plus I set this meet up," I said taking out my phone to show them the texts, "See, I set this up!"

"That's just a reminder to that you have a day off work, and plus your not in our group chat, so you better leave before I get security," Tony said.

So I left, and when I got home I called my childhood friend talking over video chat about what happened, and even they thought it was a prank, until we realized I wasn't in the group chat. So we both thought it was weird and just decided to say our goodbyes and go to sleep.

Two months later I went to give a surprise visit to my parents, but when I arrived it happened again, I knocked on the door, and my mom answered and said, "Who are you?"

Thinking they were joking I said, "Good one mom," She instantly replaied with, "John! We have a stranger at our door saying their out son"

My dad soon came with a bat saying, "GET OFF OF OUR PROPERTY NOW!"

I replied with "What do you mean I'm your son?"

He said, "We don't have a son, we only have a daughter so unless you have proof, get out now, or I will call the cops."

I instantly took out my phone scrollin though my family pics album to then see, my parents not in there, so I promptly said, "Oh Shi- Sorry, I confused with my parents, your house and their house look similar I am very sorry"

My dad replied, "Oh, ok we get the confusion, but still get out now," I replied with, "Yeah, sorry bye now."

After I left and got in my car I called my parents numbers to see what would happen and all I heard was that the number doesn't exist. So I called my sister, and the same thing happened they don't exist.

Now it's today and my childhood firend is starting to forget me, her memories are fading of me, and my ID is starting to disapear. But me and my friend came up with an idea for her to remember me. But we have no idea how I can keep my identity.

So to anyone reading this, please help me find out whats going on? Because, I think I'm running out of time.
