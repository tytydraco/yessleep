Just a usual workday… or at least that’s what I thought.



I clocked in for my shift at the local shitty comic book store — we sell every kind of comic, magazine, whatever you can think of.



Anyway, it was the middle of the night. No one ever comes in that late. Honestly, I don’t even know why my boss keeps the place open past midnight, but hey, whatever. I figured no one was showing up, so I decided to make the most of the time.



I grabbed one of my favorite magazines off the shelf and looked at the cover.



A busty brunette in a sleek bikini. Hell yeah — that’s my type.



“THIS WEEK ON JIGGLE DIGEST: VIOLET, YOUR FAVORITE BRUNETTE, POSES EXCLUSIVELY FOR JIGGLE DIGEST”



“ONLY $5 — BEST SHOTS OF HER YET! GRAB IT WHILE SHE’S HOT!”



“Well, Violet… looks like it’s time for some quality time,” I muttered with a grin.



I took the magazine to the back room, dropped it on the table, grabbed some paper, kicked my feet up, and cracked it open.



And there she was — Violet, right in front of me, looking absolutely beauti—



The door swung open.



That asshole walked in.



“Fuck,” I muttered under my breath.



I left the back room, headed to the front, and slipped into my usual bored customer-service voice.



“Welcome, mister. What can I get you?”



Weird customer comes in: mirror sunglasses, "Cash-Only Jesus" t-shirt.



He doesn’t look up. Doesn’t smile. Doesn’t even take the shades off. Just walks straight to the counter like he’s been here before. Like he owns the place.



“You got BOXX: The Leather-Clown Chronicles, Issue Zero?”



He says it like a threat.



I blink. My mouth opens but nothing comes out. For a second, I honestly think he’s fucking with me. Like he’s part of some nerd forum bet to see who can name the stupidest deep cut.



BOXX was a goddamn disaster of a series. Mid-90s splatter pulp — the kind of comic that gave your hands ink poisoning and your soul HPV. A ripoff of every antihero mashed into one leather-clad greaseball. Deadly, edgy, and drawn like the artist had a seizure with a Sharpie.



Catchphrase: “Slap ya into the panel, baby!”



Weapon of choice? A chainsaw made of jokes.



Sidekick? A literal bag of expired candy named Lick-Stik who only spoke in Bazooka Joe puns.



It was cancelled after Issue #7 when the creator allegedly mailed a bloody page to the publisher with a note that just said, “He’s in now.” No one talks about BOXX without a punchline.



And Issue #0? That was the urban legend. The “missing” prequel. No listings, no barcodes, just whispers in forums that smelled like old Doritos and dried cum.



I half-laugh. “Nah, man. That thing never existed.”



The guy doesn’t say anything. He just nods, slowly, like he already knew that. Then he turns around and walks out the door without another word.



No goodbye. No closing the door behind him.



Just gone.



I stand there, waiting for the prank cameras to come out. Nothing. I roll my eyes, head back toward the counter, and then stop.



Because something’s sticking out of the Horror Longbox.



Bagged and boarded. Slightly bent at the corner.



BOXX #0.



My throat tightens. It’s there — the cover art shows BOXX in all his smeared-ink glory, eyes wide and wild, holding a dripping slap-glove like he’s about to high-five Satan.



There’s a price sticker.

But no barcode.

No publisher stamp.

No back cover ad.



Just static.



The bag is warm.



Like someone held it before me. Like it remembers the last pair of hands.



I told myself not to open it.



I stood there for maybe three minutes just staring at the bag. My fingers were already sweating through the plastic.



I should’ve filed it away, called someone, burned it, pissed on it, whatever.

Instead, I peeled back the tape, slid the comic out, and cracked it open like it was whispering my name.



Page one hit like a slap.



The art style was… off. And I don’t mean “bad.” I mean like the page itself was melting.



The lines weren’t lines. They were scribbles pretending to be anatomy. BOXX’s face changed every panel — sometimes sharp and angular like broken glass, sometimes round and bubbly like a child’s drawing of a serial killer. Colors bled out of the frame and into the margins. Flesh tones ran green. Blood was… teal?



The backgrounds were worse — warped staircases, impossible shadows, store shelves that bent like rubber. Like the world was folding in on itself. Like the comic didn’t want to stay flat.



The fonts were scribbled, shaky, and… whispery? That sounds insane, but I swear — when I squinted at the letters, they made a sound. Not like a voice, not even a word. More like a hiss in the back of my skull. A mosquito tone that tickled my brainstem and made my teeth itch.



Then BOXX looked straight at me.



Panel six. Full splash. He’s got his slap-glove raised, a cigarette dangling from his smirk, and a speech bubble dripping red ink:



“Heya, Page-Turner. Ever felt… scripted?”



I flinched. Not metaphorically. Like, actually jumped in my seat like someone goosed me with an ice pick.



I flipped the page.



Panel one: SuperRealms.

My store. Angle’s from the front entrance, but warped like a fish-eye lens. You can see the Vape Knight display, the busted neon “WE BUY BACK ISSUES” sign, the cardboard standee of Professor Cumulo that I’ve been meaning to throw out for weeks.



Panel two: me.

Sitting behind the counter. Holding this exact comic. In the same hunched-over, dead-eyed posture I’m in right now.



Panel three: a speech bubble with my name in it.

Except I don’t remember ever saying it out loud.



“I’m not supposed to be here tonight.”



My mouth went dry. The words weren’t a narration box. They weren’t from BOXX. They were just… hanging there. No tail. No speaker.



I stared at the panel. Then I looked around the shop.



Empty. Fluorescents buzzing overhead like nervous flies. The AC kicking on and off in weird spurts.



I looked back.



Panel four had appeared.



I didn’t turn the page.



There was no page four.



But there it was — BOXX again, full splash, crouched on top of the Hentai Vault display case, licking his glove. Behind him: a new background. Static. Grey and grainy like old CRT noise.



His speech bubble wasn’t whispering anymore. It was pressed against my temples.



“Keep reading, Clerk. I just drew you in.”



The bell above the door jingled like it was underwater.



I didn’t look up at first — figured it was a wind thing. We get weird drafts when the A/C forgets how to exist. But then I heard the trenchcoat. Not footsteps. Just… swish-swish-swish, like a heavy tarp dragging itself through a flood.



I looked up, and there he was.



Fat kid. Puffy cheeks. Hair like wet yarn. Round wireframe glasses sitting crooked on his face. He had a trenchcoat that looked like it was made of shower curtain plastic — covered in NecroNuggets pins. You know, that cursed series from the bootleg Pokémon spin-off? Little demon monsters with names like Stabachu and Clawrietta, drawn by some Romanian animator who died in a meat grinder or whatever.



He stopped in front of the counter, blinking fast. His eyelids made a weird squelch every time they closed, like wet paper towel being peeled off tile.



And that’s when I saw it.



Black.

Thick.

Toner.



Dripping from the corners of his eyes like runny mascara at a goth prom.



He didn’t wipe it. Didn’t react. Just stared and stammered:



“I–I wanna subscribe to The Apathetic Four and the new Void Lantern Corps, please.”



I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.



He reached into his coat and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. It was yellowed, curled at the edges, soft like old printer paper left in the sun.



A receipt.

Timestamped: August 19th, 1996.



My stomach dropped.



He laid it on the counter like it was sacred. The paper hissed when it touched the laminate.



I looked down.



On the receipt, in smeared red ink, BOXX was grinning. Not drawn — photographed. Like a shitty cosplay headshot, but real.

And under it, in jagged font that crawled like centipedes:



“HE’S OUT OF THE PANEL.”



I blinked. Looked up.



The kid was gone.



No swish. No jingle.

Just… gone.



I spun around like a moron, half-expecting to see him hiding in the B-tier anime shelf or inside the fridge behind the counter. Nothing.



I grabbed the BOXX comic again.



I swear I’d left it on page six.

Now it was open to page ten.



Panel one: BOXX in mid-slap, glove arcing through the air toward a screaming clerk.



Panel two: the clerk.

He had my hair. My apron. My fucking wrist tattoo.



Panel three: a full-width caption across the bottom, black on bleeding red:



“Next: THE NIGHT SHIFT NEVER ENDS”



I looked up at the wall clock.

1:12 AM.



I blinked.



12:07 AM.



I blinked again.



2:03 AM.



Then:



“∞”



The clock stopped ticking.



So did the store.

No buzzing from the lights. No hum from the cooler.

Even my breathing sounded like it was coming from another aisle.



The comic was getting warmer.



And the next page…

I hadn’t turned it.



But it turned.



All on its own.



I don’t remember deciding to destroy it.

One moment I was staring at that slap-panel like it owed me rent, the next I was grabbing the lighter from the register drawer — the one we used for birthday candles and unironically labeled “FLAME SWORD +3.”



I took the comic to the back.



The breakroom was lit like an interrogation scene — one buzzing tube light above the folding table, fridge humming like it was choking on dust. Violet from Jiggle Digest still smiled from the corner, oblivious. I dropped the BOXX comic onto the table like it was radioactive.



Pulled the lighter. Flicked it.



Nothing.



Flick.



Nothing.



Flick-flick-click.



Finally: flame.



The corner of the comic should’ve curled, blackened, done something normal.

Instead, the flame danced politely next to the page like it was shy.



I pressed the flame harder.



The page shimmered.



Shimmered.



Like it was laminated in sweat. The paper rippled slightly, not from heat — but like it was breathing.

I yanked the lighter back, fingers shaking. My skin felt cold, despite the heat.



Then I saw it.



The panel. The one I hadn’t seen before. The one that hadn’t been there.



It was a drawing of me in the breakroom, holding a lighter to the comic, mouth open mid-swear.

My eyes looked wrong — like they were someone else’s.



In the drawing, the comic wasn’t burning either.



The next panel?



Just a full black box.



With white text in handwriting I’d never seen:



“You think you’re the author here?”



The lights above me flickered.



I looked up.



The flicker didn’t come from the bulbs.

It came in rhythm.



Panel cut.

Flicker.



Panel cut.

Flicker.



The whole store was syncing up to the page turns.



I ran to the front, heart jackhammering. I needed to check the time — the clock, the register, anything.



The wall clock?



1:12 AM.



Then it spun backwards.



12:07 AM.



Sped forward.



2:03 AM.



Then slowed.



“∞”



And stopped.



But that wasn’t even the worst part.



I looked at the CCTV monitors.



There are four screens above the counter. Black-and-white, shitty quality. Normally just show the aisles. Or spiders. Or nothing.



Now?



They showed next week’s schedule.



Typed. Printed. Pinned to the corkboard in the manager’s office.



Except there were new shifts.

Shifts I hadn’t taken.

Shifts that had my name crossed out in red marker and replaced with one word:



“BOXX”



Then the monitors glitched — not static, but ink bleed. Like the image was printed too wet, and the toner was running down the screens.



I backed away from the counter.

The lights dimmed.



The comic on the breakroom table was gone.



And somewhere behind me, I swear I heard it.



A glove slapping leather against leather.



And BOXX giggling like he already knew what the last page said.





The air shifted.

Not cold. Not warm. Just... off. Like the temperature decided to sit this scene out entirely. The fluorescents hummed louder than usual — a high, warbling pitch like a VHS on fast-forward.



I turned my head, slow.



Didn’t want to.

Felt like my spine knew better.



But I turned.



BOXX was there.



Not drawn. Not imagined. Not hinted-at in clever metafiction bullshit.



He was standing in front of the register, glove dripping, head tilted like a ventriloquist’s dummy someone left out in the rain.



His presence bent the air. Like he was drawn in ink so thick it warped reality — outlines flickering, face swapping styles frame to frame.



I didn’t scream.



I grabbed the Sharpie.



There was one on the counter. Some cheap, half-dried thing we used to label back issues. I snatched it, sprinted to the back, and slammed the breakroom door shut behind me like that would do anything.



The comic was back on the table.



Open. Waiting. Last page blank.



Not blank-blank. Glossy. Silver. Reflective.



Like foil cover stock. Like a mirror.



And BOXX was in it. Staring at me from the panel like a fish behind glass.



He raised the glove. Winked.



And then the caption appeared:



“Clerk ruins his own ending.”



I didn’t think.



I scribbled.



Right over the page. Through the panel. Through BOXX’s eyes. I drew Xs across the caption, through the gutters, into the margins. I tore through that paper with marker like it was a ritual, like if I could ruin the script enough, I’d get to write something else.



The page bled black.



The lights buzzed, cracked, popped.



Everything pulsed. The walls stretched like they were made of cheap rubber and started folding in.



Then—



Silence.



When I opened my eyes, the comic was just paper again.



No BOXX. No panels. No whispering captions. Just torn glossy cardstock, ink-streaked like an angry toddler went to town on it.



I left it there.



Didn’t even lock the shop.



I don’t know if I beat him.



Or if I just bought myself another page.



But I made noise. I wrote over his script. I didn’t let him finish the panel.



So if you ever get offered BOXX: The Leather-Clown Chronicles, Issue Zero?



Don’t read it.



And if you already did?



Write fast.
