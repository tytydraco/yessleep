  
My name is Johnathan Williams. 34 years ago during my Junior year of high school my class went on a field trip to the manor in our local forest. The manor has been there since the 20's and it's a yearly tradition for our class to go stay a night at the manor for a research project about the 20's and the innovations it has made. My girlfriend at the time who i will name Jane Doe because i don't want them to find her too was excited about this trip because we get to finally be fully alone together and do some dumb teenager shit. We arrived at to the manor 6:00 PM, perfect time for dinner. The owners of the manor greeted us in with happy smiles. They were a older couple wanting to keep the place nice and just like how it was back then. They fed us dinner and we went to our rooms.

My girlfriend and i snuck out when everyone was asleep and went to the shed to have sex. When we were undressing each other i heard a loud noise with a man yelling "Shut the fuck up! Shut up!". We were confused but just thought it was another student pissed off. We continued to do what we do. 5 minutes later we were interrupted again by a man screaming. I was deeply concerned so i dressed myself up again and told Jane to wait in the shed. I got out and saw the old man from before over the lifeless bloodied body of one of my classmates. The man look out of breath and pale. I was fucking scared to death. Was he gonna kill me? Beat me? Rape me? The man yelled "Young man, i really don't want to do this, they are making me do this fucking shit. Tell me where the money is at and you will be let go". I had no idea what he was talking about. What money? Was there a treasure of some kinda. He lunged at me and tried to strangle me. I screamed out and punched and kicked him multiple times. He finally got off for a breather and i ran to Jane and told her to get the fuck out but before i could tell her i was struck in the head with a hammer. It went black.

  
I woke up later chained to bed. The room was dirty with cockroaches crawling on me and mold in the walls. Luckily the struck didn't give me any brain damage except for some minor bleeding. I was ass naked and scared. The old woman from before came in with a cart of scraps from last night. "Don't worry, you will be fine" she said in a sweet voice. I was confused as hell. All i could think about was what happened and if my girlfriend was okay. The woman force fed me the scraps. It was disgusting but it beats starving to death. A few minutes later the old man from last night came in. I was terrified of him. "Look Martha the boy looks happy" i was not happy. The man told me everything will be alright if i don't try to fuss about it. They gave me three rules:

-Stay in the bedroom

-Don't make any noise

-Be nice to gramps

Whenever i did cry because i was starving or because i was in pain because of the chains making blisters in my wrists he would beat me with a belt or torture me. I had cuts all over my body from the torture. He would use knives, scalpels, blades, even the fucking volts. This lasted for 4 years and only stopped because the couple died from natural causes. A abandoned building explorer found me almost death from dehydration, the only way i could stay alive was drink the water form the leaking roof. I was taken to the hospital for a couple of weeks so that i could get the help i needed. I now need a wheel chair due to not moving my legs for 4 years and i suffer from severe PTSD and insomnia. I am in my 50's now. I have my caretaker and that's it. My parents died when i was in the hospital due to suicide. I have tried to kill myself 5 times so far and i am on suicide watch. I want to die. Why was it me that got tortured? Does god hate me? I have not talked to Jane ever since the incident. I hope she is doing fine.
