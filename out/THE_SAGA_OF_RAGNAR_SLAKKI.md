The Allfather’s wind carried us west across the whale-road, our knarr groaning like an old ox under the weight of supplies and the hopes of thirty souls. We had sworn oaths on the ring of my jarl before leaving, sworn we would return with tales worthy of skald-songs or not return at all. I was Ragnar Slakki, born under a raven’s cry, raised with salt in my beard and iron in my grip, and still the sea humbled me every dawn.

The men said the waves were angrier than usual, that Ægir, the sea-giant, wanted toll for letting us cross the world’s edge. So we offered him a cask of good ale, pouring it overboard as was proper, thanking him for every sunrise he spared us.

On the twelfth day the sea changed. The smell of land reached us—pine resin, wet loam, and something sweet I could not name. When the mist lifted, we saw a wild shore of tall trees and black stones. Even our hard-hearted helmsman fell silent. “This land is older than our sagas,” he whispered. I felt it too. The very air tasted untouched, as though no man’s breath had ever tainted it. We beached the ship, raised our shields in greeting, and stepped onto sand that felt strangely warm beneath my boots.

Men emerged from the forest, silent as stalking lynx. Their hair was black as raven feathers, their clothing stitched from hide and woven bark. Their spears gleamed with stone tips sharper than many blades I’d seen in my raiding years. For an instant the world held its breath. Then one among them—broad-shouldered, painted with red ochre—stepped forward and raised an empty hand. I answered with an empty palm of my own. That was the first moment I knew we would not need our axes.

Their village sat among the trees like it had grown naturally from the earth. Long lodges, smoke curling through holes in the roofs, children chasing dogs along packed dirt paths. They greeted us not as enemies but as strange cousins from distant shores. I felt the eyes of their elders on us, measuring whether we carried honor or trouble. Among them stood Dyani.

Her presence pulled my gaze like the moon pulls the tide. Her eyes were dark lakes full of their people’s history, her voice soft yet steady as she spoke her name. Her braids were bound with shells and copper beads. I spoke my own name—“Ragnar Slakki, son of Hrolf”—and she repeated it carefully, her lips shaping each hard Nordic syllable as though learning the weight of my spirit. That night I offered my portion of dried salmon to their hearth in thanks, as honor demanded; she offered me her people’s drink of ground berries mixed with smoked water. In giving and receiving, we became friends.

Days passed like warm wind. Dyani taught me her language beside the river, pointing at fish, sky, earth, naming them for me. Mînîthé, water. Mîna, berry. Napêw, man. I taught her Norse words—sól, sun; fjall, mountain; fylgja, the spirit that walks with each person from birth. She listened with the curiosity of a child and the wisdom of a healer. She showed me how her people followed the stars, not as our skalds chart them, but as living guides with their own stories. Their constellations were beasts and spirits, guardians and warnings. 
As i was speaking the saga of Grettis, Dyani fell silent in my arms. Grabbing a nearby pelt, too fell to the night.

The next day, we feasted on venison roasted over stone pits, corn mash sweetened with sap, smoked fish served on bark plates. I gave them iron arrowheads—small things, valuable beyond measure to a people who shaped stone instead. They gifted us furs thick as winter wolves. Their generosity reminded me of the old Norse law: A guest is a gift from the gods. Feed him well, for tomorrow he may save your life.

On the 13th night the elders called for a great fire. They beat drums whose deep rhythms stirred ancient memories in my bones. The shaman rose—an old man whose braids were bound with bones and whose eyes were milky like those who walk between worlds. He spoke in their tongue, his words moving like a stormwind. Dyani leaned close, translating in whispers against my ear.

He told of the Wīhtikow.

A spirit of winter. Of hunger sharpened over centuries. A man whose soul had been devoured by greed until only thirst for flesh and warmth remained. When famine struck, it grew stronger. When hearts grew selfish, it walked freely. It took the shape of a tall, starved creature with limbs stretched beyond nature’s design and a heart frozen in its chest like cursed ice. Its scream turned warm breath cold, its presence stilled the forest.

The fire seemed to shrink as he spoke. Even the hunters—fearless men with stone spears—tightened their grips. I sipped the smoky drink and muttered, “It sounds like the Jötnar, the frost giants from the time before men.” The shaman turned toward me though he could not see with mortal eyes. “Your frost giants are born of your world’s edges,” he rasped. “The Wīhtikow is born from the spaces where no worlds touch.” A chill crawled over my shoulders. Even I, a Norseman who had seen omens in the shapes of storm clouds, felt the truth in his voice.

Three nights later the wind changed. The wolves stopped howling. Birds fled before we noticed them leave. Every man knows the silence of a hunted forest, and this was that silence. The fire snapped low, suddenly feeble. The hair on my arms rose. Dyani’s hand found mine, trembling.

The creature stepped from the pines.
It towered like a frost-gnarled tree, limbs thin as grief, skin stretched pale over bones that jutted like broken antlers beneath flesh. Its eyes glowed an icy blue not found in any mortal creature. Its breath steamed in great white clouds though the night was mild. When it opened its mouth the sound was wrong—like wind screaming through the ribs of a dead ship.

Chaos erupted. Warriors sprang forward but the Wīhtikow moved with the hunger of winter storms. It ripped shields apart with its claws, flung grown men like driftwood. Its touch left frostburn on skin. When it seized a hunter and bit into him, steam rose from the wound. His body stiffened, frozen from within. Arrows stuck in the creature’s hide only to shatter with sharp pops. Even my men, who had faced berserkers and Irish blades and English volleys, faltered in terror.

Dyani grabbed my arm, shouting over the screams. “Ragnar! It fears pâskwâwiht, fire!” Her words burned through the panic. Fire. Always fire. The purifier. The first gift of gods to man.

We rallied, casting torches, swinging fire-hardened spears. The beast shrieked whenever flame neared, though it only staggered briefly—as if remembering a pain from some other life. Still, every breath of it numbed the air. Every movement killed a man. We retreated toward the shore, shielding the wounded. My brothers fell around me. My shieldmate Örnulf died in my hands, his chest frozen solid despite the warmth of his blood on my fingers.

When we reached the trees near the beach, the survivors fled toward the ship. Only Dyani remained with me. Her voice shook as she said, “If we do not hold it back, it follows your people across the sea.” She pressed a hand to my chest where my fylgja stirred. “Your spirit is strong, Ragnar. Strong enough to stand against it—long enough for the rest to live.” with tears in her eyes, she gave me a longing kiss.

I nodded "Go now Dyani, Odin is with us."  I was raised to know that a drengr's fate is his own to claim. So I dipped my long sword in thick ship-oil, the kind that clung like sap, then thrust it deep into the firepit. Flames roared along the blade, bright as the forge of Brokkr. I felt its heat in my bones, felt the All-father’s hand on my shoulder. I stepped toward the forest and bellowed into the cold, “Héðan! Skepna helvítis! Come forth, cold-heart!”

The forest answered with a roar that shook the branches. The Wīhtikow lunged from the shadows, sprinting with unnatural speed, Its claws tearing into the earth. I braced myself, swung the flaming sword, and struck its side. Burning flesh peeled under the blade, and the creature’s scream cut through the night like a soul being torn apart. But its claws were faster than expected. One raked across my face, splitting flesh from brow to jaw. Blood poured hot down my cheek. Pain flared white.
Still I held my ground.

We battled among the trees, fire casting wild shadows. I struck again and again, each hit searing its corpse-pale skin. Frost radiated from its wound, chilling my hands even through the heat of the sword. With a final cry in the old tongue—half prayer, half curse —I drove the flaming blade between its ribs, aiming for the frozen lump that passed for its heart. The beast shrieked so loudly the birds fled their nests miles away. Smoke curled from its chest. Its limbs shook. Then it turned and fled into the dark forest with a sound like cracking ice.

The moment it vanished, my strength faltered. I ran toward the beach, half-blind from blood. Dyani and my surviving men hauled me into the ship. The sea wind stung my wound, but it was clean—living—unlike the cold touch of the creature. We rowed until dawn, until the cursed shore slipped beneath the horizon.

I spent days recovering on the open ocean. Dyani tended me with herbs she gathered from the ship’s stores and sang me soft and warm songs of her people. The scar on my face burned with fever, but I lived. When the cliffs of Norway finally rose from the waves, Dyani stood beside me, wrapped in my spare cloak, gazing at the land that would become her new home.

We returned with fewer men, no treasures, and a story most would not believe.
