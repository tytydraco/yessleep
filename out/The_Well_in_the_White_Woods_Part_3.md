If you haven’t read [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/bhFfkFdcsn), or [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/RK10nVyNYq), please go read those. I’m sorry for pause in between entries, it’s been a difficult task to dredge all of this up. This is the note I found in my mother’s cabin, if any of you have any thoughts or ideas on what any of this could mean so far, please let me know. 

“To whoever has found this—

I write these words knowing they may be my last. If you're reading this, you've likely stumbled down the same dark path I did, and I pray you're better prepared than I was. They're watching, always watching, even when you think you're alone. Their eyes are everywhere in this town.

I came to this story as a skeptic, seeing only a quaint local legend worth a few column inches. How naive I was. What I've uncovered is a cancer at the heart of this place, a darkness that has fed on our silence for generations. Each layer I peeled back revealed something more horrifying, until I finally understood the true cost of knowing too much.

To my children, if by some miracle you find this—I'm sorry. Sorry I won't see you grow up, sorry I couldn't protect you from what's coming.
To any other readers I apologise, this may be the last thing I write.

The truth is down there, in the dark. I've discovered something about the entity in the well, something that might be its weakness. When it hasn’t eaten in a long time it’s not as powerful. So tomorrow, I'll try to end this nightmare once and for all.  If you're reading this, I failed.”

The revelation sent me spiraling. Each new piece of information hit like a punch to the gut, leaving me dizzy with questions and what-ifs. Mom had tried to stop it—whatever "it" was—and now I was left clutching fragments of a puzzle that refused to make sense. Every lead had turned into another dead end, and I was exhausted from chasing shadows around this godforsaken town, hunting answers that seemed to evaporate like morning mist. The only way forward was terrifying: I'd have to follow in my mother's footsteps, maybe even face what she had faced.

The walk home that night felt surreal. I'd finally found what I'd been searching for, except I hadn't—not really. Larry was still missing, and the truth remained frustratingly out of reach. But at least now I knew it wasn't all in my head. The thing that haunted these woods was real. I suppose that counted for something, even if it wasn't exactly comforting.

Dawn was breaking by the time I stumbled home, the sky turning that peculiar shade of gray-purple that makes everything look slightly wrong. My father was exactly where I'd left him, passed out in his armchair, an empty bottle dangling from his limp fingers. I fired off a quick text to Missy and John, asking them to meet me at the oak tree. While I waited, exhaustion crept up on me like a tide, and I kept catching myself drifting off. Missy's gentle touch on my shoulder startled me awake. She wore that soft smile of hers, the one that always made my heart skip a beat, even in times like these.

I spilled everything—my grandfather's cryptic words, the disturbing absence of my mother's records, and the revelation about the cabin Jeremy had mentioned. The words tumbled out in a rush, like I couldn't get them out fast enough.

"Well, shit," John muttered, running a hand through his hair. He looked as tired as I felt.

Missy leaned forward, her eyes intense. "So we have to find this cabin now, right Matt?"

I shifted uncomfortably, my hand going to my neck. "Yeah... about that."

When I finished telling them about my solo expedition, Missy's hand connected with the back of my head hard enough to make me see stars. "Are you insane?" she demanded. "What if something had happened to you? What if you'd gotten lost? What were we supposed to do then?"

"Keep going, I guess," I mumbled, not meeting her eyes.

"We need you, Matt." Her hand found mine, squeezing tight enough to hurt. "We can't figure this out without you."

I sighed, trying to hide how her touch made my face flush. "I know it was stupid. I just... I needed to see it for myself first."

"Well, from what you're saying, there's no point going back there now," Missy said, her voice heavy with resignation.

John, who'd been unusually quiet, finally spoke up. "So what's our next move?"

My eyes drifted to the White Woods, those ancient trees standing like silent sentinels at the edge of town. "I'm done waiting," I said, reaching behind me to pull out my father's handgun. The metal felt cold and wrong against my skin. "If there's even a chance Larry's down there, we have to try." The gun safe's combination hadn't been hard to crack—dad's birthday wasn't exactly Fort Knox security.

"Matt!" Missy's hand connected with my head again, harder this time.

"It's for protection!" I protested, rubbing the spot she'd hit. "Look, I wanted to believe this was just some tweaker living in the woods, but if my mom said it was something more..." I swallowed hard. "I believe her."

We exchanged glances then, and I recognized that look—the same one John had worn all those years ago when Larry first disappeared. It was that uniquely teenage mixture of courage and stupidity that makes you believe you're invincible. Without another word, we turned toward the White Woods. This time, we'd face them together.

Missy's hand found mine again, and then, surprisingly, John grabbed my other hand. I shot him a questioning look.

"Don't get any ideas," he grumbled. "I'm scared shitless, and I'm not holding her hand. You're the buffer zone."

The unexpected humor broke through our tension, drawing shaky laughs from all of us. And so we set out, a chain of trembling hands and racing hearts, to face whatever waited in those woods. My feet ached with every step, the familiar path seeming longer than ever before. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I wondered if our parents had noticed our absence yet, if they'd figured out where we'd gone. But those thoughts felt distant, unimportant. Only one question really mattered: Was Larry still alive?
