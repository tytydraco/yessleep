It begun on a very normal day I had just entered 4th period greeted by my teacher Mrs Scott but as soon as everyone had entered sirens loud enough to make me cover my ears blared overhead and metal shutters slammed blocking of the windows and doors obviously the students were all a bit rattled by this but Mrs Scott assured us it would be fine and too stay calm so we did I went over to my mate Jayden and we began talking joking about what might off happened 

Hour 1: Everyone was a bit nervous by now I was ok messaging my sister in her English and  chatting with Jayden id been snacking on some of my leftovers from lunch apparently some religious in my sisters classroom was preaching about the end of days sounded crazy too me it had still only been An hour 

Hour 3: A lot of the students were mad we should’ve been on our way home by now but we were still locked up in this room one of the Bullies Jason was mid way through screaming at her “LISTEN HERE FATTIE YOUR GON-“ that’s when the power went and everyone began screaming luckily only a few minutes later the backup generator turned on but that was only a taste of what Off what would happen later

Hour 3 and a half:
At this point the students were getting worried messages from their parents (myself included) I explained to my mum the situation and told her I was fine but she was still worried my sister messaged again telling me some others had joined that weird religious kid  

Hour 5: Id Taken a nap to pass the time but was i was trywoken up by a voice over the speaker it was our head teacher I think I’m not sure if it was the speaker or just her voice but the one word she spoke sounded distorted that one word was: “help” I messaged my sister to see if she had gotten the same message and sure enough she did I noticed even Mrs Scott was getting worried 

Hour 8: i think some kids are starting too snap a small and shy boy who I don’t even know the name off suddenly grabbed a stool and began slamming it into the shutters they must be stronger than we thought before a few of the bigger kids pulled him off he didn’t even make a dent

Hour 10: I’m going to sleep soon but I thought this story needed to be mentioned incase I don’t survive the night nearly the entirety of my sisters class has joined that crazy kid who I now knows name is John she’s pretended to join him after she saw what he did too none believers luckily my class hasn’t devolved to this yet infact we’ve been sitting around chatting to eachother but I’m not sure quite how much longer we can last please give me tips and ask me questions
