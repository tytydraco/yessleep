I know, down to the cent, how much it costs to cross the river of death. Charon doesn’t do discounts. He’s an asshole like that. I wasn’t buried with money, not that uncommon these days. Charon understands that, and he’s got to make a living like everyone else, so he adapted, he changed it up. He still charges the same but now he takes his tribute in jewelry, fine clothes, dress shoes. All the accouterments of luxury that are given to the respected dead. 

  
I was buried in a shallow grave by a man I don’t remember the name of. He told me, but I’ve forgotten it over the last century. I do remember that he was crying when he killed me, regret maybe. I don’t care for his regret. It’s got a bitter taste to it. He buried me naked, no bits and baubles to pay for my passage over the river. I was not of the respected dead. 

  
There are others, abandoned souls like me, sometimes, but they always leave quickly. There was the Nigerian woman who died of starvation, stuck in a cave, but a couple days after she arrived, she got smart and traded her beautiful hair for a trip across. My hair is dull and unkept, not nearly valuable enough. Then a man with eyes the color of sea glass, who tried to swim across by himself. The souls of the damned tore him to shreds. I’ve got a piece of his arm hidden somewhere, I talk to it sometimes. 

  
There must be other rivers, other Charons, because there are never more souls to cross than can fit in the boat. Maybe those other rivers look like the staircase of heaven or the cycle of reincarnation, and I just got unlucky enough to end up with the only gates to the afterlife that require payment. 

  
I don’t know if this message is going to go through. Charon got me a computer, a couple days ago. Or a couple years ago. It doesn’t matter. He told me that he couldn’t go against his nature, but he felt sorry for me. I don’t know why, when he's been a large part of my suffering. I think it might be nice to share my stories, though. It’s taken me hours to figure out how all the buttons work. It’s strange, how quickly technology advances. Charon’s certainly advanced with it. He’s got a smartphone now. He plays Geometry Dash in the mindless minutes or decades spent waiting for more souls to ferry. There was a chunk of time when he wore things he called Google Glass. 

  
“Those make you look ugly,” I told him. 

  
“You just don’t understand fashion,” he responded. 

  
I’ve been wandering the banks of the river for almost a century now, I think. I collect the stories of the people who cross the river, who have been abandoned like me, even of the writhing sufferers in the river, occasionally. I’ve collected some good ones over the years. 

  
Stories of the past. *I eat picnic picnic food out of conch shells. Dig my fingers into the red ground which isn’t quite clay yet. Wonder how the ocean got all the way out here. Wonder where it went. There’s a meteor. Fireworks. Death can be so pretty. The dinosaurs start to starve across the world. Everything is already dead here. Everything except the bugs who stick their heads out of the ground. They gossip. I hear them when they run under my fingers and burrow under my nails. Burrow like that horrible neon green nail polish. I was forced. Peer pressure. It never came off. Even now, miles and miles in the past, it crusts my cuticles. I cling to it. I think maybe I can hear the dinosaurs fighting across the ocean. Stegosaurus. Herbivores. Spiky. T-rex. Little baby arms and big dreams. Gallimimus. Baryonyx. Carnotaurus. I was glad when the dinosaurs finally finished dying. I was afraid they’d be as dumb as us humans in another couple years.* 

  
Love stories. *You were furtive kisses, tentative things that landed on cheeks or foreheads or the corner of my mouth. You were boundaries told in the manner of old Greek storytellers, nestled around the fire of our hearts in the midst of old lockers. You were the third person I kissed. My first was drowned at the bottom of the pool, me a selkie to his mermaid. We bragged to our friends about fluttering things that I barely felt through the water pounding in my ears. My second kiss was a harsh thing, her tongue heavy in my mouth. I did not kiss her; I was kissed by her. You and I, we were awkward, in the way of new couples everywhere. But we figured it out. We became Prometheus and seared the night away. I wish you were my first instead of my third.* 

  
I tried to steal Charon’s boat, once upon a time. I waited until he was distracted with something he called a Gameboy, then I snuck up behind him and struck him in the head with a branch that I’d snapped from one of the shriveled trees that line the banks. He’d gone down, easy as anything, immortal but just as fragile as my skin was when it parted under my murderer’s knife. 

  
He’d dropped the oar when I hit him, and it fell into the river, then sunk away into the depths, so I paddled with my hands. I took up the water in my palms and pushed it behind me while the damned brushed kisses across my fingertips. It was a sacrifice bend, knees against the sides of the boat, my arms splayed out to either side. I pressed prayers into the water with my bare hands and didn’t look away from the shoreline, the shore that would finally take me from this awful limbo. I didn’t care where I went after, I was just tired of the endless waiting. 

  
But the land never drew closer. I put all my strength into it, really buckled down and did the work, but I was just drifting in place, alone and conquered by the river. 

  
Charon came to claim his ferry when he woke up. Turned out he had a spare boat, surprise surprise. He pulled me out kicking and screaming. 

  
He held me up over the river by the throat, with one hand. “I should really just drop you in.”

  
I was choking, but of course I was still able to talk. I’m dead, I don’t need to breathe. 

  
“Do it then,” I said, I dared. I knew he wouldn’t. He is a ferryman, not a judge. It is what he always has been and always will be. He could not damn my soul, even if he desperately wanted to. 

  
He tossed me in the back like a sack of flour and took me back to my shapeless eternity. 

  
I gathered more stories. 

  
Stories about therapy. *I twirl a small intestine around my finger, thoughtfully, like a piece of hair. This one is recently dead. I can tell by the taché de noir la sclérotique just barely leaping for joy beneath her closed eyelids. “I’ve got this body in the back that is starting to breathe again. Wanna see?” And of course the answer is yes. The body on the table has an uneven slit across her throat because she wouldn’t stop fighting as I murdered her. Blood long since dried is trickling down her chest. “Yeah, crowd anxiety was a bitch. No, I’m not that concerned either. I can always kill her again. Maybe I’ll smother her this time.” I thump the side of the skull like a new car. “Just got this puppy carbon dated, turns out it’s older than bacteria learning to think.” It practically crumbles to dust beneath my fingers.* 

  
Wanderlust contained in the words of a story. *I imagined running away. I sipped from searchlights and seared my way along the east coast. But I am not a razorblade girl. I twirled around my room and my lamp became the eiffel tower. Dame de fer. I bounced off the edge of the atmosphere and landed right back here.* 

  
The thing about stories, in the land of the dead, is that they have power beyond just entertainment. Strip someone of their physical form and that’s all they really are, a collection of stories that makes up a life. 

  
I’ve spent a long time here. A long, long, long time. Maybe more than anyone ever has. Most people, they get past a decade and they throw themselves in the river. Not me. And in those years, I’ve discovered that if you wield a story right, it can change the fabric of the afterlife. That’s what this afterlife is, after all. A collection of legends, a Greek myth that powers the reality that I see. 

  
My domain is a narrow strip of land between the river and a rock face that extends up and to the side, forever. I arrived here in the space it took to take my last breath, fading into existence like all the other souls that come here do. There’s a place, a hundred or so miles down the shore, where the cliff takes a turn, into a hidden little cove. 

  
My stories can carve this rock. They blast holes in it, flowing out of me with explosive force. I’ve been tunneling for decades. I have to reach something eventually, the rock can’t go on forever.

  
And then? I don't know. Maybe I’ll be reborn. Maybe I’ll just end up in a different afterlife. Anything is better than this.
