Torsney is a small suburban town in upstate New York. No more than around 500 people live there. I was born there in the late-90s and have never lived anywhere else. I just never had the incentive to move. I can't recall a time when anything happened in that town. Not even a theft. It has to be the definition of a quiet sleepy town in which nothing happens.


I was out of town when it happened. On a casual trip to Manhattan for two days. I'm not exactly sure when it began. I was sitting in a hotel room, waiting for responses from two of my friends to messages I had sent them three hours earlier. My friends from out of town had responded to me within minutes. I had messaged all of these people at roughly around the same time. 7 PM on Thursday.


That wasn't the thing that felt weird, however. I didn't think much of it at first. I assumed they'd respond at some point. Them taking a bit longer to respond than usual would have to mean they're busy. It was nothing to me. Then at around 10 PM, there was a knock at the door. I went to answer it. A police officer was standing in the hallway.


"Are you Jesse Colson?"


"Yes," I said.


"There's a disturbance going on in Torsney," he said. "We're going to make sure your friends and family are safe. Do not go into the town until we can be sure of your safety."


"Alright, officer," I said. "What's the disturbance though?"


"I don't have all the details," he said. "When I get them, I might be able to tell you."


He walked away and I shut the door. The idea shook my nerves. But of course, if they stayed safe, whatever was happening wouldn't get to them. But I didn't know what was happening. I couldn't assume anything. Was there a way the police had no details to give? Maybe a few officers didn't have any details, but the ones in the town had to have them. There's no way most officers were without details on what was happening if they're telling me to stay out of town until it's taken care of.


I got back into bed and did a Google search for Torsney, New York to get updates on the situation. When I looked under the News section, there was nothing, let alone anything about any situation going on in the town.


That's when I realized my friends and family from Torsney hadn't gotten back to me. I messaged them again. All of them. I asked them what was happening and if they were safe. There was no immediate response. I assumed they were busy making sure they were safe and distracted myself to ease the anxiety.


I couldn't distract myself for long. The itch of worry became irresistible. I couldn't bear anything terrible happening to my friends. Not knowing what was happening was even worse. If the situation was dire enough to warrant not visiting the town, there'd have to be something about the situation somewhere. I checked every social media app I had, searching for any comments or videos about the situation in the town.


There were no Tweets about it from anybody who lived in the town. Not even from the mayor of the town, who's latest tweet was from earlier in the afternoon.


There were no TikTok videos of the situation from anywhere within the town, let alone any TikTok videos from or about the town from any time in the past. There weren't any videos about the situation on the accounts of anybody who lived there. That of course includes the friends I have who live there. All of whom have TikTok accounts.


Then I checked YouTube. I did a search for Torsney, New York and sorted the results by the Past 24 Hours. There was a video with only 2 views. Amongst all the unrelated videos with 0-100 views that popped up. It was titled "Upstate Drone Capture." In the thumbnail was an aerial shot of a wide area that included a town. I recognized the town, along with the line of hills behind it. It was Torsney. I selected the video. The town looked normal from above and afar in the thumbnail. If the situation was as bad as I felt was implied, it would be visible in some way at some point in the video.


According to the description, the video was taken that afternoon. I skipped through it until I found a part my town was visible in. I stared at the screen, waiting for something to happen.


The drone never got close to Torsney. It just hovered around above the neighbouring town. The only thing I can say happened was that at multiple points, a flock of birds flew away from the town. That was it. It was nothing. Nothing visibly happened within the town at all. At least not at that hour. The hour my friends would have responded to my messages in, based on the usual amount of time it takes for them to respond to my messages.


The reason I'm explaining this is because I found the lack of information to be quite dreadful. I felt cold thinking about it. Nobody from the town was saying anything. Yeah, maybe they're busy trying to stay safe, but the town's government hasn't said anything. It's as if the town is dead.


I didn't expect to be able to get to the town myself because of the police, so I was running out of options. Waiting wasn't one of them for me though. I was getting colder by the hour. I messaged my friends again. Jack and Sam. I asked them both the same burning question.


"What's going on in the town? Are you entirely safe? I'm worried as shit."


After that, I scanned the news again. Nothing. I decided to get some sleep. Afterall, I was exhausted. There had to be something in the morning, right? The next morning, I woke up to the bright shine of sunlight. As I got up, I turned my phone's screen on. Hopefully, I had at least one message. A rush of emptiness filled me when I saw a screen with no notifications displayed on it.


I checked the same things frantically. Everything was the exact same as they were last night.


After eating breakfast, there was a knock on my door. When I looked through the eye hole, I saw a man. At first, he looked normal. Long sleeve t-shirt, blue jeans, black hair. Then I caught his glare. It was foreboding. Invasive. His eyes looked off in general, in fact. His pupils were an odd colour I can only describe a tiny bit for some reason. It was like a yellow with the energy of the darkness of blue. At the same time, it felt as if his eyes were dark abysses. Not never ending though. More like things wanted to jump out at me. His glare and everything about his eyes sent shivers down my spine.


I phoned service and asked them if they sent somebody up. I told them about the man. They told me they hadn't sent anybody up. I looked through the hole again. He was still there. With his glare almost frozen at the expression it was at before. After about a minute, I heard footsteps coming towards the door. A woman spoke.


"Hey," the woman said in a stern tone.


I watched as the man walked away. The lady walked by, asking him to identify himself.


With that, I shifted my focus back onto Torsney. The police hadn't returned, but I assumed that if the situation wasn't big enough to make the news, it was probably over. I checked my messages again. Still nothing.


"That's it," I said to myself.


I walked out to my car. Maybe it was the coffee, but I didn't care much about what the police might do if they were guarding the town. Maybe they'd just tell me to turn back. Maybe I wouldn't come face to face with the officer from before. Maybe the situation ended as recently as when I stepped into the parking lot.


As I drove through the countryside, things were relatively calm. I wasn't expecting much. Halfway down a road in the middle of a forest, things got weird.


A gas station came up ahead. It was to my right on my side of a 4-way intersection. I knew the intersection as the last one to cross before reaching the town. On the opposite side of the intersection was a police blockade. Two cars, a van, and seven officers.


I pulled up to the gas station to refill my car. It was running out of gas anyway. After that quick business was done, I climbed back into my car and contemplated what I was going to do next. If the situation was bad enough for a blockade, then it was still in progress. If the situation wasn't on the news, then it would have to be bad enough that the press wouldn't know how to handle it. But how could anything get that bad?


As I drove away from the pumps, the way my car was moving felt… off. I parked in a nearby parking space, then I stepped out of my car. Taking a look at the tires, I found a square hole had been cut of the back tire on the passenger side. The hole was a clean cut square shape that gaped out towards the sides of the tire.


Who did this?


The sensation of somebody staring at me hit the back of my head. I glanced to my right, towards the bushes and trees across the street. The man with bulging yellow-blue eyes was standing in front of one of the bushes. The chills returned. What did he want? Glancing around to check if anybody else could see him, I glanced at the convenience store. A woman with long black hair sprinted out the front doors. A loud bang erupted from inside. The glass from the double doors shattered into pieces and flew some distance away from the building.


I glanced towards the blockade. The officers were looking in the direction of the store with hesitant looks on their faces. As if confused about what to do. None of them fished out their radios. None of them drew their guns. They didn't look ready one bit. I watched on, wondering when they were going to do something. Anything. Then I heard a deep growl behind me.


I glanced back. I went cold at what I saw. The owner of the store stepped outside and fell to the ground. The right half of his head was a purple fleshy mush with two extra eyes. His hands were turning grey. He screamed and tried to pick himself up, but then he let himself lay on the ground. A few things crawled out from under his shirt and squirmed around on the pavement. I can't even begin to describe what they looked like without being choked with dread just thinking about them.


What the hell?!


I glanced at the officers across the intersection. They had the same horrified expressions on each of their faces. The one on the far right took out their radio and spoke into it. The man with bulging eyes rushed over and jumped him. The other officers took a step back. Each of their eyes widened as they looked on. However, not one of them pulled out their guns. Was there some sort of deal between the officers and somebody else to not act at all?


The officer's radio fell to the ground. The man let him go just to crush the radio to pieces. The officer picked himself back up and reached for his own gun, then the man kicked him with what had to be the hardest kick I've ever seen. He flew about 30-40 feet and rolled across the muddy/grassy ground. I never thought a kick could be strong enough to push a human that far. The officer let out a painful grunt. The other officers quickly exchanged looks with each other. As the inhuman man walked up to the hurt officer and grabbed him by the neck, the officer standing nearest pulled out his own gun. The man dragged the hurt officer into the bushes while the officer standing by aimed his gun. He fired in the man's direction, but a hole was put through his own neck. He shrieked, fell to the ground and struggled. A few more seconds passed before the kidnapped officer let out a chilling animalistic scream from somewhere deep in the bushes.


What was that thing? It didn't act in a way a human could possibly act. It seemed like an exaggeration of a human… at least in terms of strength.


As I stared in horror, something caught my eye. On the road in between the forest and the gas station, huge swarms of tiny things… like groups of bugs… were moving across the street. Towards the gas station. It was like they were escaping something. Jumping ship. The chills intensified.


This isn't better than I thought it would be…


I stood up. I had to get back in my car and drive wherever necessary. Away from this mess. Even with a flat tire. However, a woman was sprinting towards me. Her speed was inhuman. I barely turned my head before she reached the car. Her eyes were bulging. They too included the mysterious yellow-blue color I was sure didn't exist. She pulled out a device and placed it on the trunk. I wanted to ask her what was going on, but she sprinted back in the direction she came. The device on the car began to blink.


"Get away from the car!" One of the blockade officers yelled.


I turned around and sprinted to the far side of the gas station lot. At that point, the store owner was frozen in one spot. His skin was now a deep grey colour. His hands had melted into the pavement, appearing unrecognizable to what they once were. As I ran past him, a loud bang hit my ear drums. When I got to the other side of the lot, I stopped. I looked back and noticed my car was flaming. Great.


I'm typing this while keeping watch of my surroundings. A red minivan drove up the road and the police officers at the blockade signaled them to turn around. They backed up and drove into the lot. They parked, then out came a man with dark hair and a well groomed beard. He looked similar to my neighbor, Frank. I read the license plate on the car. It was Frank. He had a look of surprise as he looked in my direction.


"Jesse?"


"Frank… Yeah. It's me."


"Are you trying to get into town too?"


I summarized the situation up until now, then I asked him if he knew why it was happening.


"No, I just wanted to get back home. It's like the town is just missing. No one's picking up my calls."


He went on to explain a man with bulgy eyes was following him half of the way to town, and he could feel the man staring at him. The feeling disappeared whenever he entered a crowded place, then it would come back when he was alone again.


Great. He was being stalked too.


He asked about me. I explained my situation the best I could. Frank was pale by the time I finished.


"W-what's going on, man?"


Frank took out his phone. I went back to typing this. As I typed, Frank screamed. I glanced up. The stalker and the woman were dragging him by the head and throat. He got dragged across the street and into the trees. The pit of dread grew. What did they want?


What should I do next? I could run the other way, but going by what Frank said, along with the way police were acting… if I called the police on the stalker, they'd report it and soon they'd just tell me not to go near it or something. The stalker would probably disappear before any officers who didn't know this was happening could find it. Me reporting while in close vicinity of a stalker could get me kidnapped by one or two, based on what I saw. I'm avoiding that. The fact they want to be hidden so badly fills me with dread.


Oh, and one extra thing I noticed was that the taller trees beyond the blockade stood still while the others swayed around whenever the wind picked up. Not sure what that's about.


I need time to comprehend this whole thing.
