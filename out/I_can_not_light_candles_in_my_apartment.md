   I have been burning thought candles way faster than usual for months now. When it first started, only small amounts of molten wax would disappear at a time, and while I noticed that I would burn through candles in a couple of days instead of a week like usual, at first I ignored what was happening, thinking that the company producing the candles probably started using different materials, but over time more wax started to disappear.

   I work from home and usually light a scented candle while working. I usually light the candle on my bedside table, which is right next to the door that leads to the living room. Around two weeks ago, while getting up from my computer desk, which faces away from the candle, to take a quick bathroom break, on my way out, I caught a glimpse of the lit candle. A two-inch layer of molten wax rested on another three-inch layer of solid wax, which the wicks rose out of at first being somewhat visible through the molten layer, breaking the surface and being slowly burned away at. The flames flickered as I swung the door open and walked out of the room. When I returned 10 minutes later, the molten layer was gone, and the wicks had been shortened down so that the flames rested right above the solid layer of the wax. At first, I thought that the glass jar that contained the candle was leaking, but after a short inspection, I was only able to find two small drops of candle wax that had solidified right next to the candle on the bedside table. I still had 2 hours of work left to do, but I was too lost in thought and was unable to do any work.

  
   Around 4 days later, I mostly forgot about the incident and went back to using the candles like normal. I kept burning through the candles pretty quickly, which means that it was still happening, but one night I saw it.

  
   Every night before I go to sleep, I like to read for at least 30 minutes, and while reading, I usually light a candle. Three days ago, I fell asleep while reading, I woke up to loud slurping noises. As I opened my eyes, the brightness of the light I had not turned off almost blinded me. As my eyes tried to readjust to the light and focus on what was in front of me, I saw a somewhat humanoid brown blur that contrasted with the white paint on the walls behind it. Another brown blurred line stretched from the forms head all the way to the candle on my bedside table. I could feel my heart skip 8 beats consecutively. I wanted to scream, but I could not. I opened my mouth and tried to force out a scream for help, but the pressure I applied to my throat was way beyond what it was able to handle, leading to me only producing a light wheezing sound. I tried to prop myself up or to at least sit up, but my muscles failed me. Trying to push myself up with my arms felt impossible. As I stared at the figure that had suddenly appeared in my room, my eyes finally managed to focus, making it possible for me to see the intruder who was now staring at me. The figure was a man at least 7 feet tall, dressed in all black; he looked bloated; his eyes were bloodshot and looked like they would pop out of their socket; at any point, his skin was a grayish light blue.

**HIS LIPS**

   His lips extended from his mouth like an elephant's trunk, which had been split in half. The lips extended all the way from the man's mouth to the candle, the flames had been put out. He was using his lips as a makeshift straw, slowly sucking up all the molten wax from the candle, which had fully melted while I was asleep. I lay in bed, unable to move, unable to scream for help, staring until he emptied the jar. His lips retracted back to his face, the molten wax solidifying on their tips and cracked, flakes of wax falling off the man's lips and falling down to the floor, as the man grinned, staring at me, his teeth also covered in solidified wax; the ridges and gaps between the teeth were filled in with wax making it impossible to make out where one tooth ended and the next one began. The man opened the door he was standing next to, but instead of walking out of the room, he stepped behind it. His face peered at me from above the door, and then once again, like he had done to drink the wax, the man puckered his lips, which stretched from his mouth and floated all the way to me. I shook and tried to roll over away from him, I wanted to get up and run, but my fear had taken over my body. Tears flowed from my eyes. He kissed me on the cheek, leaving flakes of wax and light moisture. He retracted his lips and lowered his head behind the door.

   I don't remember falling asleep, but when I woke up, I saw the empty glass jar which at one point contained the candle. Even though I had hoped that what had happened was a dream, it wasn't. I still had flakes of wax on my cheek, and on my bedroom floor, the wax in the jar had disappeared. I called the police, but they were unable to find anyone in my apartment; they also could not find any evidence of a brake in. I'm currently staying at my friends house while I look for a new apartment. I tried to stay at my apartment while looking for a new place to move to, and while I had thrown out all of my candles, I still could not get the thought of the man watching me starving, waiting for me to feed him out of my mind.
