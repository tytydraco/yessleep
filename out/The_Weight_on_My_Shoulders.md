I never thought I'd be a single father at 35. Every morning, I force myself to get up at 6:30, make breakfast for Tommy, and try to keep our lives as normal as possible. But it's hard. So hard.  
  
The house feels different now. Empty. Silent. Sometimes I catch myself staring at her coffee mug, still sitting in the kitchen cabinet where she left it. I haven't touched it. I can't.  
  
Tommy, my five-year-old, he's been... surprisingly strong through all this. Too strong, maybe. When Sarah left, he didn't cry. Not once. Which is strange, considering how close they were. He just keeps smiling, playing with his toys, as if nothing has changed.  
  
The first few weeks were the worst. I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I'd see her face. Her expression in those final moments... No. I can't think about that. I need to stay strong for Tommy.  
  
Lately, though, something's been off. I'm constantly exhausted, but it's more than just emotional fatigue. There's this... heaviness. It started in my head, like a fog that wouldn't lift. Then my shoulders began to ache, as if carrying an invisible burden.  
  
I've been taking sleeping pills, but they don't help much. Sometimes, in the corner of my eye, I catch glimpses of something. A shadow. A silhouette. But when I turn, there's nothing there. Just empty rooms and silent walls.  
  
The worst part? The garden. I used to love gardening with Sarah. Now I can't even look at it. The soil seems... different. Darker. The roses she planted are growing wild, their thorns sharper than ever. They're blooming blood red this year.  
  
Tommy still goes out there to play sometimes. Yesterday, I saw him talking to himself near the rose bushes. When I asked him who he was talking to, he just smiled and said, "Mommy's flowers are pretty this year, aren't they, Daddy?"  
  
I had to turn away. I couldn't let him see my face.      The exhaustion is getting worse. At work, I can barely focus. My colleagues keep asking if I'm okay - I must look terrible. I tell them I'm just having trouble sleeping, still adjusting to being a single parent. They nod sympathetically, probably thinking Sarah left me for another man.  
  
If only they knew... No. Stop. I can't think like that.  
  
The weight on my shoulders has become almost unbearable. Sometimes I find myself hunched over, as if something's pressing down on me. The doctor says it's stress, prescribed me some pills. But pills can't fix this. They can't fix what I... what happened.  
  
Last night was particularly bad. I was washing dishes when I caught a reflection in the kitchen window. For a split second, I thought I saw Sarah standing behind me. When I turned around, there was nothing there. But the air felt heavy, thick with the scent of her perfume - that sweet, floral scent she always wore. The same scent that still lingers in the garden soil.  
  
Tommy's behavior is starting to unnerve me. He's always been a happy child, but this is different. He hums to himself while playing, the same lullaby Sarah used to sing. Sometimes I hear him laughing and talking in his room late at night. When I check on him, he's always alone, but his toys are arranged in a perfect circle, as if he's been having a tea party.  
  
This morning, he asked me something strange over breakfast.  
  
"Daddy, why do you look so tired? Is it because you're carrying Mommy?"  
  
I nearly choked on my coffee. "What do you mean, buddy?"  
  
He just smiled and went back to his cereal, humming that damn lullaby again.  
  
The roses in the garden are growing faster than they should. Their roots must be reaching deep, feeding on... No. I need to stop. I need to focus on keeping it together. For Tommy.  
  
But this weight... God, this weight...  Today, everything fell apart. Literally.  
  
I was standing in the kitchen, trying to make dinner, when the room started spinning. The weight on my shoulders had become crushing, like someone was hanging onto my back. My knees buckled. The last thing I heard before hitting the floor was the sound of small footsteps running down the hallway.  
  
"Daddy? Daddy, wake up!"  
  
Tommy's voice pulled me back to consciousness. I was lying face-down on the kitchen floor, the cold tiles pressing against my cheek. As I struggled to push myself up, my shoulders screamed in protest. It felt like my spine was being compressed by an invisible force.  
  
I managed to get to my knees, coming face to face with Tommy. His expression wasn't scared or worried - he looked almost... amused? The kitchen lights flickered above us, casting strange shadows on his small face.  
  
"Tommy," I wheezed, the pressure on my back making it hard to speak, "don't you ever feel lonely? Now that... now that Mommy's gone?"  
  
He tilted his head, looking at me with those innocent eyes - Sarah's eyes. Then he smiled, that sweet, childish smile that usually warmed my heart. But this time, it sent a chill down my spine.  
  
"But Daddy," he said, his voice light and cheerful, "Mommy never left. She's always with us."  
  
My throat went dry. "What do you mean, buddy?"  
  
Tommy giggled - that same giggle he used to share with Sarah during their private jokes. "Silly Daddy. Mommy rides on your back every day. That's why you're so tired!"  
  
The room started spinning again, but this time it wasn't from exhaustion. The weight on my shoulders suddenly felt different - more defined, more... human. I could feel something pressing against my back, arms wrapped around my neck, legs gripping my waist.  
  
Something wet dripped onto my shoulder. When I touched it, my fingers came away red.  
  
Tommy was still smiling, still humming that lullaby. "Mommy says the roses need more water, Daddy. She says they're growing really well where you planted her."  
  
I can feel her now, even as I write this. Her weight on my back, her cold arms around my neck. Tommy is in his room, having a tea party. I can hear him talking to someone, laughing.  
  
The roses are blooming beautifully this year. Blood red and thorny, feeding on what lies beneath.  
  
And Sarah... Sarah never left.  
  
She's still here.  
  
Still watching.  
  
Still riding on my back.
