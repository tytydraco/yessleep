I’ve always been fascinated by the paranormal, especially haunted dolls. I’ve seen many videos and stories online about people who own them and experience strange things. I wanted to have one for myself, so I decided to look for one on eBay.

I found a listing that caught my eye. It was a porcelain doll with blonde hair and blue eyes, wearing a pink dress. The seller claimed that the doll was from the 1800s and that it was possessed by the spirit of a girl named Lucy, who died of tuberculosis. The seller said that the doll was very active and that it could move, talk, and even cause poltergeist activity. The seller also warned that the doll was not for the faint of heart and that it could be dangerous if provoked.

I was intrigued by the description and decided to buy it. The price was only $50, which seemed like a bargain for such a rare item. I paid with my credit card and waited for the doll to arrive.

A few days later, I received a package at my door. It was the doll. I opened it eagerly and took out the doll. It looked exactly like in the pictures, except that it had a crack on its forehead. I assumed that it was damaged during shipping, but I didn’t mind. I thought it added to its charm.

I placed the doll on a shelf in my living room and admired it. It looked so innocent and cute. I couldn’t believe that it was haunted. I decided to name it Lucy, after its original owner.

That night, I went to bed and fell asleep. Around 3 am, I woke up to a loud thud from downstairs. I got up and went to check what it was. As I walked down the stairs, I heard a faint giggle coming from the living room.

I entered the living room and turned on the light. What I saw made me scream in terror.

The doll was on the floor, surrounded by broken glass and books. It had fallen from the shelf and knocked over everything in its way. But that wasn’t the worst part.

The worst part was that the doll had changed.

Its eyes were no longer blue, but red. Its mouth was no longer closed, but open in a twisted grin. And its voice was no longer silent, but loud and clear.

“Hello there,” it said in a high-pitched voice. “Do you want to play with me?”

I ran back to my bedroom and locked the door behind me. I grabbed my phone and called 911. I told them that someone had broken into my house and that they needed to come quickly.

As I waited for help, I heard the doll banging on the door.

“Let me in! Let me in! I want to play with you!” it shouted.

I prayed that it would stop, but it didn’t.

It kept banging and banging until the door broke down.

And then it came in.
