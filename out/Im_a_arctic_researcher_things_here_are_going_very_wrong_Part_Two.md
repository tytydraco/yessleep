We waited till sunrise to talk, as I had suggested. The things I saw from last night still reeling in my head, I kept trying to rationalize what I saw, I just simply can’t. Maybe I never will. We all sat in the lounge, me, Olivier, Wyatt and Garret. We were in a malformed circle trying to figure out what happened.

“It had to have been a bear, nothing else could’ve swiped him like I saw. Hell John you were closer, what did you see,” Garret said pointing and turning his head to me. 

All eyes are on me for an answer.

“I saw nothing, just him in the snow then the next thing I saw was him being snatched away. I never saw a bear,” I said, understanding three things, I was the only one who saw what took him, it was most certainly not a bear, and I was the only one to hear him speak that night before he was grabbed. 

“We need to find him, his remains,” Wyatt said, leaning forward ready to stand up.

We all agreed, so we got up and got ready. Before we left we set up a line system, the 4 of us would be attached to a rope connected to the base, so we wouldn’t get lost in the white. The rope attached to us was long enough so that we could go far. We had no luck for a long time. We were forced to stop after a few hours due to cold and hunger. But once we were rejuvenated, we went back out. The others wanted to find Jamie's body, I knew it wasn’t going to happen. But I went out anyway, hoping we’d find him. Multiple points during the search I swear I heard footsteps around me. Whispers beckoning me into the snow. 

The whispers sounded close to me, like it was in my ear, and far away at the same time. It was human but sounded like it was coming from a parrot mimicking sound. But as much as I ignored it, what happened next sucked me out of my concentration. The rope I was connected to started to be pulled, as if someone was tugging on it past the line of visibility. It wasn’t a hard tug, more like a curious one, but it got more and more noticeable until it was pulling hard on it. Then with one strong tug, I was swept off my legs. 

“SHIT! FUCK! HELP! WHAT THE FUCK,” I was screaming as I was being dragged. 

The dragging felt more powerful than even Garret could muster. Eventually it stopped after it reached the end of the rope, whipping me around on the ground as if one part stopped while the rest kept going. I hit my head on a rock, blood filled my left eye. The pain shooting down my spine into my legs and pounding my jaw.

Oliver found me soon after, saying something I couldn’t understand. Whatever was dragging me gave up. My neck felt horrible, my head throbbing, I was slipping in and out of consciousness. He pulled me to the rest of the group, passing me to Garret and Wyatt to carry me. My jaw was locked tight and my legs felt like jelly. My arms were noodles, it was as if the rock removed my motor functions.

As I was thrown between the two Oliver felt like he was torn away from me. I turned to see him being dragged away by the rope around his hips. Oliver looked pale, the air being launched out of his lungs like a cannon. Wyatt threw me on Garret to run after Oliver, Garret pulled on Wyatt’s collar. Garret threw Wyatt on the wall. 

“We can’t go after him alone. Let me put John down first dammit,” Garret said, gritting his teeth and throwing me onto the wall like Wyatt. 

I felt like puking up everything as my back slammed into the wall, my neck feeling worse. I was able to see them begin to walk out there. Oliver screamed bloody murder, until he went quiet. He went quiet when the rope was taught. The ropes snapped when Wyatt grabbed onto the rope. Wyatt was slammed to the ground, busting his jaw onto the cold snowy floor. Garret picked up and dragged Wyatt inside. 

I felt the hands of consciousness slipping from me. Garret slammed the door shut, his face twisted with fear. My head was pounding with a pain I've never felt before. Garret began to lift me up. That's when I passed out.

I woke up hours later. I couldn’t feel my head, but my neck and spine felt as if it was being riddled with puncture wounds. My arms felt heavy as if I was pulling them through a pool of viscous oil. I was laying on a medical bed that was moved into the lobby. Wyatt was to my right messing with his jaw. He looked up, noticing I was awake. 

“So, are you fully conscious? Also I have a question, what the fuck was that out there,” He asked as his arms fell from his face into his lap, he began leading forward.
