\--- I try to convince myself I’m real.

I’m a freelance UI/UX designer. Most of my work is remote—startups, early-stage apps, those “move fast, break things” types. The kind of clients who vanish when it's time to pay you, or rebrand weekly to avoid tax. I’ve seen it all.

Three months ago, I got an email through my portfolio site. Subject line: \\“Immediate Contract. Silent NDA. 7 Days. \\$7,500.”\\

No message body. Just a .PDF and a link. The PDF was a short contract—super vague, filled with legalese, and one weird clause that stood out:

>“Contractor consents to image and likeness usage for neural training and deployment under digital anonymity clauses.”

I’d seen AI companies play fast and loose with user data, so I assumed it was for some facial recognition training dataset. Not ideal. But I’d been ghosted on two invoices and had less than \\$200 in my account. I was desperate. I clicked the link.

The portal was minimalist. Brutal, even. No logos, no contact button, no names. Just a basic login system that somehow already knew who I was — autofilled my email and showed a user ID: \*"nd-0079-p/face\\:active"\*.

There was a single message:

>“Upload 25 high-resolution facial photos. Neutral expression. Blank background. No accessories. No glasses. No filters. Thank you for your cooperation.”

No “hi.” No project details. Just that.

I hesitated for a few minutes. Then I did it. I used my phone, good lighting, blank wall. Uploaded them all, hit submit. The screen flickered and gave me a final message:

>“Processing complete. Work begins in 24 hours.”

The dashboard locked. No downloads, no messages, no buttons. Just a blinking cursor.

That night, nothing happened. But the next morning, I had five new messages across platforms.

The first was from a girl named Kara on Instagram:

>“Hey sorry, weird Q — are you working on that new video platform VELT? I swear your face is the one greeting people on the homepage. It's... kinda creepy tbh.”

Then a Reddit DM from someone I didn’t know:

>“Dude, are you in some beta AI chat thing? Your face just showed up on my screen when I joined this link from a friend. It said ‘Welcome to the Edge.’ What the hell is that?”

I thought it was spam. But I got curious.

I found a link: \*velt.live\*— invite-only site, buried in weird Discord servers. The homepage was stark: black background, white serif text, one button. \*\*“Enter the Feed.”\*

Inside were dozens of live video streams. Grainy, low-res, all muted by default. No usernames. No chat.

Each window showed a person. Always alone. Always sitting at a computer or looking at a screen. No one speaking, but some were visibly distressed. Crying. One person sat still for over 20 minutes, unmoving, except for their fingers twitching slightly. Another one had covered their webcam with a post-it note… but you could still hear breathing.

And in every stream, in the lower right corner, was \*my face\*.

Neutral expression. Pale. Watching.

I clicked on one stream at random. A teenage boy, maybe 16. He was typing rapidly — Discord or something. Then he stopped, looked straight into the camera, and whispered:

>“He’s watching again. Tell it to stop.”

He was talking about \*me\*.

The more I looked, the more wrong it felt. This wasn’t some creative art piece or ARG. These were real people. I recognized the sounds, the UIs on their screens, the rooms — these were live feeds into real devices. I started recording my screen, but the video file corrupted immediately.

The next night, at 3:41 AM, I got a call from \*Avery\*, a dev I’d worked with last year. I hadn’t spoken to her in ages.

>“Why the hell did you FaceTime me at 3AM and just sit there staring? You didn’t even blink.”

I told her I didn’t. She didn’t believe me until she sent the screen recording. I wish I could post it here, but I’ve wiped my phone since then. It showed \*me\* — absolutely still, barely breathing, eyes wide, no shirt, just... watching her. No background, just darkness.

Except... behind me, you could see a sliver of her bedroom wall.

I never left my apartment.

The days after that were a blur. My face — or the version of me they built — started popping up in strange places. A YouTube ad no one else could find. A Twitch stream that got taken down mid-broadcast when someone said, “He’s here again.” A random TikTok where a little kid pointed at the camera and said, “That’s not a real man.”

I deleted every app. Formatted every drive. Changed phones. Nothing helped.

I’ve spoken to three other people who think they got the same contract. One guy uploaded videos instead of photos. He hasn’t been online since mid-April. Another girl said her clone started \*talking\* in her voice on her Alexa device.

The last guy—well, I saw his stream on VELT last week. He wasn’t moving. His eyes were open, but he wasn’t blinking.

Just... sitting there. While I watched him watch me watch him.

I’m writing this from a public library on a borrowed laptop. Every camera in here is covered. I keep feeling like people recognize me, but they don’t know from where. And when I sleep, I dream in third person — like someone else is piloting me. Like \*I’m the feed now\*.

If you get the email, don’t open it.

If you already did… don’t look at your reflection.

You might see someone looking back who’s not quite finished becoming you.
