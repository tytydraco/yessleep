My name is Jules, I am 13 years old, and I think there is a dog I don't know watching me sleep from the corner of my room.

Everything started three nights ago. I woke up for no reason, with that strange feeling that someone was watching me. At first, I thought it was my dog, Pistache. But when I looked at the foot of my bed, Pistache was sleeping deeply, curled up on his blanket.

That's when I saw it.

A dog. Big, still. It was sitting in the corner of my room, just at the edge of the shadow. I couldn't see its fur well, but its eyes... they were glowing. Not like Pistache's when light reflects in them. No. These ones glowed by themselves, like two little lanterns.

I closed my eyes very tightly, and when I opened them again, it was gone.

The next morning, I told mom about it. She said it was probably a dream, or my imagination. I wanted to believe her. Really. But the next night, it was there again.

This time, I tried to move, to reach for my bedside lamp. But my body wouldn't listen to me. It was like I was stuck. My heart was beating so fast. The dog didn't move. It just watched me. With its glowing eyes. Its silhouette seemed to tremble a little, like a poorly tuned TV image.

I closed my eyes even tighter than the night before. When I opened them, it was gone again. But I heard a noise, like claws scraping the floor.

The third night, I was even more scared. Because this time, I didn't even have time to fully wake up: it was already there, closer. Almost at the foot of my bed. I could feel its breath. It was cold, damp, not like Pistache's, which smells like kibble and grass.

I wanted to scream, but no sound came out of my mouth. My fingers trembled under my blanket. The dog opened its mouth. Its tongue hung out, black and long, way too long. And its teeth... they were thin, sharp, and they didn't look like Pistache's at all.

I closed my eyes, once again. But this time, I heard it move. I heard a growl, a low, rumbling sound that seeped into my head. I felt like it was laughing.

This morning, when I woke up, my blanket was covered in scratches.

Tonight, I will try not to fall asleep. But I know it will come anyway. And this time, I'm afraid it will be even closer.

I told my dad. He laughed and said it was a nightmare. But when I showed him the scratches, his face changed. He told me it was probably Pistache playing rough. I know that's not true. Pistache never comes up on my bed, and these scratches... they looked too deep, too deliberate.

I tried staying awake last night. I kept the lights on, hugged Pistache close, and waited. Hours passed. I felt my eyelids grow heavier. I shook my head, pinched my arms, whispered to myself to stay awake. But at some point, I must have drifted off.

Because when I opened my eyes, the lights were off. And the dog was there. Right beside me.

Its breath was in my ear, slow and heavy. I could hear it, feel it, smell it. The scent of something old, something rotten. My body refused to move. I wanted to scream, but my throat was locked. The dog’s mouth opened wider. Wider than any real dog’s could. And I saw something inside. Rows and rows of tiny, jagged teeth. And something else. Something moving.

Then, just as suddenly, it was morning. My room was empty. The dog was gone. But the scratches on my blanket were deeper, the fabric torn through.

I don’t think it’s just watching me anymore.

Tonight, I‘ll ask my parents if I can sleep with them, I hope the dog will not follow me.
