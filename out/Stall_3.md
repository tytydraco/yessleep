I’m a trucker. Been one for almost twenty years. I’ve seen a lot of strange things on the road—but nothing like this.

It happened during my early years, when I still ran long international routes. The kind that cut through nowhere, threading across mountains and ghost towns. I was somewhere in northern Spain, driving through the Babia y Luna Natural Park, heading toward Portugal.

The landscape was breathtaking—mountain peaks, still lakes, forests thick enough to swallow you whole. What it didn’t have was people. For hours, it was just me and the road, the only signs of life being the occasional rusted marker for some municipality I never saw.

Still, it was peaceful. Just me, my truck, and the radio. Until the silence started getting to me. After a few days without human contact, I found myself craving a hot meal and a voice that didn’t come from the speakers.

As the sun dipped behind the hills, I spotted a sign—finally. A service station up ahead.

By the time I reached it, night had fallen. The parking lot was dark, lit only by a single flickering lamp that barely held back the shadows. A handful of cars sat scattered across the lot, their windows fogged with cold. Above the front door, a buzzing red neon sign blinked in a language I couldn’t quite read.

Inside, the lighting was dim, the air stale. A few patrons sat hunched in booths, nursing beers or staring at empty plates. Behind the counter stood a short, stubby man with a thick mustache. He scowled when he saw me.

“Buenas,” I said, summoning what Spanish I still remembered. “La… cena?”

He grunted, tossed me a menu, then turned away to pour someone else a drink.

“Sí, cerveza. Una,” I added, settling into a seat at the counter.

The beer came cold and frothy. The food—when it arrived—was surprisingly good, or maybe I was just that hungry. A couple more beers later, I asked for the check. Then, remembering I wouldn’t see another stop for miles, I asked about the bathroom.

The man glanced at the clock behind me, then looked away quickly. With what felt like hesitation, he handed me a key and pointed toward a hallway at the far right of the diner.

As I turned, he grabbed my wrist—tight.

“No. Número tres,” he said, holding up three fingers. “No bueno.”

I nodded slowly, not sure what he meant. I made my way down the hallway and found the bathroom door. It stuck, like it hadn’t been opened in days. I forced it open and stepped inside.

The place was filthy. Dust and cobwebs clung to the ceiling, grime stained the tile, and the mirror above the sink had turned matte with age. A faint fluorescent buzz echoed off the walls. There were three stalls. The furthest one had a paper taped to it. Out of order, I guessed.

With a sigh,I stepped inside the closest stall.

The door let out a tired groan as I closed it behind me. The lock clicked into place with a reluctant snap, like it had been years since it was used.

Inside, the light felt dimmer, though it was just the same flickering bulb overhead. Shadows pooled at the edges, and the walls sweated with old moisture. It smelled like piss and bleach—an acrid, chemical sour that stung the back of my throat.

I sat down.

The toilet seat was cold. Not just unused cold—unwelcoming. My legs tensed automatically, and I forced myself to relax. I leaned forward, hands on my knees, trying to breathe through my mouth.

I sat there in silence, letting the hum of the fluorescent light settle over me like a film. The smell of bleach hung sharp in the air, but something mustier lingered beneath it—wet concrete, mildew, and a trace of something sweet and metallic, like old blood soaked into tile.

Then I heard it. A thud. Faint, but distinct. From the far end of the bathroom, beyond the row of stalls.

At first, I thought it might’ve been the plumbing. Old buildings groaned sometimes. Maybe the pipes were shifting in the walls. But it came again—lower this time, heavier. It didn’t echo through the walls like a vibration. It landed in the room itself, dull and full-bodied, like something hitting the ground.

I leaned forward and glanced under the stall. Nothing. No boots, no feet, no sign of movement. Just grime-stained tile and the slow flicker of dying light.

The smell thickened—moist fabric and rust. Something sour crept into my mouth, the taste of copper curling on the back of my tongue. My instincts flared. I wasn’t alone anymore.



Then it came again, louder this time—a groan dragging through the air. Long. Tense. I recognized the sound immediately. A stall door. One of them was opening.



My stomach tightened. I swallowed, but the knot in my throat held firm. I tried to speak, to say something—anything—but my tongue stuck. My lips parted, then closed again.

Another thump followed. Then a pause. Then another. 

Heavy, uneven footfalls began to move across the bathroom, slow and labored. With each step came a dragging sound. It was soft, but thick, like wet rope or cloth being pulled across the floor behind it. The steps didn’t sound right—too measured, too slow. Not like someone walking. More like something trying to remember how.

I leaned forward again to look under the divider, but saw nothing—just more empty tile.

Still, the sound grew louder. Closer. Each step brought it nearer in an awful rhythm, scraping and thudding across the floor until it reached my stall. It was then that the dragging stopped. 

The air felt heavier than before, like the room was shrinking around me. I could feel it—whatever it was—standing on the other side of the door.

My hands moved to the latch. They were slick with sweat. My chest felt too tight, heart hammering like it wanted to escape before the rest of me.

I couldn’t see anything, but I knew it was just outside the stall. Standing there. Facing the door.

The air felt wrong—warmer, like breath. My skin crawled. Every instinct screamed to keep still, to be silent, to disappear into the metal and tile.

But my hands moved anyway, slowly, as if someone else were controlling them. I reached for the latch, pressing down hard, as if that thin bit of plastic could keep whatever was out there from coming in.

I leaned forward, careful, trying to angle my head low enough to peek under the stall—to confirm it wasn’t just nerves, a trick of isolation.

But before I could look, the door jolted.

A sharp, violent pull from the other side.

My body snapped upright, heart hammering in my chest. I pressed harder against the door, both hands now on the latch.

It yanked again. And again. Repeated, jerking tugs that rattled the metal, shaking the entire stall with a brutal rhythm. The door clattered in its hinges. The latch scraped in its slot. My fingers went numb from how tightly I was holding it.

There was no breathing on the other side. No voice. Just force.

Each pull made the door flex outward, as if it might tear loose entirely. The metal groaned under the pressure. My teeth clenched as I leaned in with all my weight, heels sinking in the grimy floor.

The fluorescent bulb above buzzed louder. The walls felt closer. My ears rang.

I could smell it now—whoever, whatever, was trying to get in. Damp, rotten fabric. The reek of moldy paper. Sweat. Soil. Something that had been underground too long.

Tears welled in my eyes. My throat clamped shut. Every muscle burned.

And then—just like that—it stopped.

No warning. No sound.

Just… stillness.

And then the footsteps started again, slow and heavy, dragging away from my stall. Each step smearing whatever it trailed behind it back toward the end of the bathroom.

Back toward stall number three.

A long, groaning creak filled the air. The sound of a door—that door—easing open, and closing.

I didn’t wait.

Still fumbling with my belt, I pushed the stall door open with my shoulder and stumbled into the main aisle. My legs moved on instinct, carrying me toward the exit.



Then I heard it again.

That same groaning creak. Behind me.

The door of stall number three was opening.

I turned my head—just enough to catch a glimpse.

Something dark pushed against the inside of the stallt—black and rotten, with long fingers stretching too far, curling around the edge like it was testing the air. The door eased open another inch, and something shifted behind it.

I didn’t stay to see more.

I flung the bathroom door open and crossed the threshold—

—and stopped.

The diner wasn’t the same.

The lights were gone. The ceiling sagged. Cold air rolled over me, sharp and dry, thick with the scent of dust, rot, and cold grease. Glass crunched underfoot. The windows had shattered. Wind blew in through the empty frames, stirring dead leaves across the cracked linoleum.

It looked like it had been abandoned for years.

Tables were overturned. The counter was rusted through, its chrome surface pitted and brown. The fridge doors hung open behind the bar like gaping mouths, and mildew crept along the walls in spreading veins of black and green.

The front door was gone—just a splintered frame opening into night.

Beyond it, the parking lot stretched out in silence. No cars. No lights. The overhead lamp I’d seen on arrival was shattered, its glass scattered across the pavement. The asphalt was cracked, overgrown at the edges, littered with damp leaves and windblown trash.

Only my truck remained.

I didn’t think, I simply ran.

Straight across the lot, up into the cab. My hands shook as I turned the key, and the engine roared to life like a voice I’d forgotten I needed to hear. The headlights cut a path through the dark, and I pressed the pedal to the floor.

I didn’t look back.

I don’t know what was behind that stall door but whatever it was, I saw it from the rearview mirror standing at the door.
