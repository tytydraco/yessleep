This happened 5 years ago in the states. Feel free to ask questions.

My name is Sarah, and the night my friend Emily and I stumbled upon a terrifying cult in the woods was supposed to be a fun adventure.

We had all been feeling cooped up and restless, so we decided to go on a hike in the nearby forest. As someone who has hiked in many places and through many woods, I never expected to encounter something as terrifying as what happened that night. None of us had ever been there before, but we had heard that it was beautiful and peaceful.

As we hiked deeper into the woods, we began to notice strange symbols etched into the trees and rocks. We thought it was odd, but we didn't pay it much attention. We were too busy enjoying the beauty of nature around us. It wasn't until we heard the chanting that we realized something was wrong. We followed the sound, hoping to see what was going on, but we never expected to find a cult. The cultists were all dressed in black robes, and they seemed to be performing some kind of ritual around a large fire. It was just as out of the movies.

We were scared, but we couldn't look away. The chanting grew louder and more intense, and we could feel the energy in the air. But then, one of the cultists spotted us, and everything changed.

They immediately stopped chanting and turned towards us. We could see the anger in their eyes as they began to approach us. We ran as fast as we could, but they were always right behind us. "I don't think we can outrun them!" Emily gasped. "We need to find somewhere to hide!"

I nodded in agreement and scanned our surroundings frantically. That's when we spotted an old cabin up ahead. We ran inside and slammed the door shut, hoping it would hold. We could hear the cultists pounding on the door, and we knew it was only a matter of time before they broke through. We searched the cabin for any weapons we could find, and that's when we found an old axe. We knew it wasn't much, but it was better than nothing. We huddled together, ready to defend ourselves, when suddenly everything went silent. That's when we heard the sound of wolves howling close by. It was an eerie sound that sent chills down our spines. We didn't know if it was a good or bad sign, but at least the cultists had stopped pounding on the door.

We were terrified, but we finally mustered the courage to peek outside. To our shock, the cultists were gone and there was no sign of them. It was like they had vanished into thin air. We stayed in the cabin a few hours until we decided to make a run for it back to our car.

We knew it was a risk, but we couldn't stay in the cabin forever. We opened the door cautiously, ready to bolt if we saw any sign of the cultists. We ran as fast as we could through the woods, we kept moving, trying to stay on the path we had taken earlier. We didn't know how long we had been running, but our legs were starting to feel like jelly. We kept running, the dense forest started to thin out, and we could see a clearing up ahead. Just as we thought we had made it, we saw them. Two cultists emerged from the treeline, their eyes fixated on us like predators. The sight of their black robes and masks made my blood run cold. They were holding long, sharp knives in their hands, glinting menacingly in the dappled sunlight. We skidded to a stop, our hearts racing in our chests.

But just as they were about to close in on us, we heard a gunshot ring out. The cultists paused for a moment, startled, and we took the opportunity to run past them. As we looked back, we saw a figure emerge from a cabin up on a hill. The cabin was surrounded by a cleared radius of trees, presumably to prevent wildfires. The figure was dressed in a ranger's uniform, holding a gun in their hand. They shouted out a warning to the cultists, who seemed to think better of pursuing us any further. We kept running until we were sure we were out of danger.

We collapsed on the ground, gasping for air and shaking with fear. We explained everything to the ranger, and he quickly called for backup. The police took our statements, and we led them back to the cabin where we had taken refuge. The officers searched the area, but they found no trace of the cultists. They told us that they would continue their investigation and that we should go home and stay safe.

Emily and I got into our car, still trembling from the adrenaline and fear. We drove back to our homes, grateful to be alive but still shaken by what had happened.

Over the next few days, we followed the news closely, hoping for any updates on the cult and their whereabouts. But there was no news, and the incident seemed to have been forgotten.

Months passed, and Emily and I tried to move on from the terrifying experience. But every time we went into the woods or heard a strange noise, we couldn't help but remember that night.

One day, we received a letter in the mail. It was a handwritten note, with no return address. We opened it cautiously, unsure of what to expect.

The letter read, "We know what you saw, and we know what you heard. But you should know that you are not safe. We are always watching, and we will come for you."

Emily and I were terrified once again, and we immediately called the police. They assured us that they would investigate, but we knew that we couldn't rely on them alone.

We started taking self-defense classes and installed security cameras around our homes. We never went into the woods again and always carried some form of protection with us.

Years passed, and we never heard from the cult again, but we couldn't help but wonder if one or more of the cultists knew us. They must have obtained our addresses from somewhere, and it made us feel uneasy.

Eventually, after several strange incidents in the woods, the police were eventually able to track down and arrest some of the cultists involved. However, when questioned by the police, the arrested cultists denied their involvement and never revealed their motives. The fact that most of the cultists were still free and at large was unsettling.

Looking back, I still can't believe that I had never heard of the cult before. It's scary to think that such a dangerous group could be operating right under our noses without anyone knowing.

I don't hike anymore, the thought of being out in the woods and encountering the unknown was no longer thrilling, but terrifying. I couldn't shake off the feeling of being watched, of being followed. What did the cultists want with us? Did someone know us? Was the letter only meant to scare us? Are we still in danger? These questions still haunt me to this day.

As much as I wanted to forget that night, I couldn't help but think about how lucky we were. The thought of what might have happened if the wolves hadn't scared the cultists off still sends shivers down my spine. And then the ranger showed up just in time to save us from the cultists. If it weren't for these fortunate events, who knows what could have happened to us.

As time passed, we went back to our normal lives and eventually moved out of the area. That night in the woods was a wake-up call for me, a reminder to always stay vigilant, aware and never underestimate the dangers that could be lurking. Who knows what other dangers are out there, waiting to be discovered?
