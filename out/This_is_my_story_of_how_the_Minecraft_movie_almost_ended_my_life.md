I had been so excited for the Minecraft movie until last week...

i had bought the Jack Black Steve action figure and was planning to take it to the theater with me once the movie released, after weeks of waiting the it had finally came out and so i drove my rusty 2002 Hyundai accent to my local movie theater. After parking my rusty 2002 Hyundai accent, me and my Steve figure excitedly made our way inside the theater and got our tickets for a Minecraft movieâ€”I purchased 2 so my Steve figure could watch too. I then purchased an extra-large Dr. Pepper to slurp on during the movie and the limited edition Chicken Jockey popcorn bucket. I made my way past the giant Jack Black cutout to take pictures with and headed to theater 2A like the attendant had told me to see the greatest movie ever made.

Upon entering I noticed I was the only one there, I assumed maybe most people had jobs and couldn't see a life-changing masterpiece at 4 PM on a Thursday.



As the movie progressed I couldn't help but holler in a fit of laughter and throw my popcorn everywhere whenever Steve made one of his comedic quips, I couldn't help but notice that Steve's sword had been unexpectedly replaced with a rather large butcher's knife, I figured it was probably just a new weapon coming to the game that they wanted to advertise so I continued throwing my popcorn everywhere and screaming. Finally, the moment I had been waiting for, when Steve said his coveted line "I, am Steve!" but I could never had suspected what terrifying horror would come out of his mouth... 



Steve opened his mouth and blood came pouring out as he said "I... am Satan!" in a deep grizzled voice, suddenly grotesque horns spouted out from his head as he let out a terrifying laugh. I managed to quickly pull out my phone and get [this](https://imgur.com/cGyKaBY) picture of it. The blood from his mouth poured down onto his sweater turning it dark red with blood, next, his eyes turned black as blood too started pouring out of them, Jason Momoa screamed bloody murder and Steve began chopping him into pieces, the rest of the cast followed as they met the same grizzly fate.



Apparently still not satisfied of his bloodlust he turned towards the screen and made direct eye contact with me, before I could even do anything Steve gad burst into flames, no, wait... that was part of the movie, the actual theater screen was on fire. A whole burned directly where Steve was as the theater was ingulfed in a dark thick fog, I could barely make out a silhouette from where the whole had burnt into the screen, but just then "I, am Steve!" echoed and crescendoed throughout the theater shaking me to my very core. Through the cacophony of evil laughter, the fire alarm, and the movie I managed to form one clear thought, "run." I shot upright out of my sheet and bolted for the theaters exit, but upon seeing me Steve pulled out his butcher's knife and began chasing me, Thinking fast I threw my limited edition Chicken Jockey popcorn bucket at him causing him to trip and stumble down, I just barely made it out of the exit when I immediately heard firefighter sirens. I wiped a bead of sweat off my forehead and turned back, I saw Steve just standing there, ominously at the exit door. I slowly walked back to my car, still making sure to keep and eye on him, when, I finally saw him mouth one final thing to me, "No one's going to believe you." I made it back to my rusty 2002 Hyundai accent and drove away. A few hours later and the police came knocking at my door.



I'm currently on trial for suspected arson against the movie theater in the state of Oregon since apparently no one else was in the building at the time except for me. 



[I still have that burnt Steve figure on my desk and it stares emptily at me](https://imgur.com/mj4eBvs), taunting me. "No one's going to believe you."
