I’ve always loved eerie stories, the kind that stick with you long after you hear them. Urban legends, old folklore, the weird little superstitions people swear by. A few weeks ago, an old lady from my neighbourhood told me one that I haven’t been able to shake, and I figured I’d share it here.

Her name is Alice. She’s about eighty, maybe a little older, though she’s never specified exactly. She’s lived in the same house for decades, long enough to watch the neighborhood change around her. If you saw her sitting on her porch, you’d think she was just another quiet old woman enjoying the afternoon sun. But Alice loves to talk.

I stop by her place pretty often, once or twice a week, whenever I have time. She lives alone, so I like to check in, but I think we both know it’s not just that. Alice is fun to talk to. She’s got this sharp, dry humor that catches you off guard, the kind where you’re never sure if she’s joking or just stating facts in a funny way. She complains about her knees, about how “kids these days” don’t know how to fix things properly, about how the supermarket keeps moving stuff around just to mess with her. But then she’ll turn around and tell me some wild story from her past, like the time she claims she saw a bear standing in her driveway when she was a little girl, only for it to walk off on two legs like a man. Or the time she swears she heard someone knocking on her bedroom window in the middle of the night, even though her bedroom is on the second floor.

She’s full of stories. Some of them are funny, some of them are eerie, but all of them have this quiet certainty to them, like she’s not trying to convince you; she just knows what she saw.

Alice has her little routines, too. Her house always smells like black tea and books, no matter what time of day it is. She keeps her sugar in a glass jar with a label so faded you can barely read it, and her butter in an old ceramic dish that looks like it’s been around since the ’50s. She’s the kind of person who still writes letters instead of texting. Every time I visit, she offers me tea and biscuits, always two biscuits, even though she only ever eats one.

She also talks to herself. Not in a weird way, just the way some people do when they’ve lived alone for a long time. She mutters while she’s making tea, clicks her tongue while looking for something in the cabinets, sometimes even responds to the TV like it’s part of the conversation. I never thought much of it. If anything, it was kind of endearing, just Alice filling the quiet in her own way.

But last week, she told me a story. And now… I don’t know. Maybe I should’ve paid more attention.

She called it The Listening Room.

I don’t know where she first heard it. When I asked, she just said, “It’s something people used to talk about.” And the way she said it stuck with me. Used to. Like it wasn’t just an old legend, but something people stopped talking about.

Alice leaned in a little, as if someone else might overhear. “It’s a room that wasn’t supposed to exist,” she said. “Not haunted, not cursed, just wrong. And if you stay inside too long, you start to hear things.”

She hesitated then, her spoon clinking softly against the ceramic as she stirred her tea. Her gaze flicked over my shoulder, just for a second, like she was checking the doorway.

Then she said, “And if you hear the wrong thing, it hears you too.”

I laughed when she said it. Not in a mean way, just that quick, reflexive chuckle you do when someone tells you a spooky story with a straight face. “So, like an echo?” I asked. “Or ghosts?”

Alice didn’t laugh. She just lifted her teacup and took a slow sip, eyes fixed on the table like she was thinking.

“It’s not ghosts,” she said finally. “Not voices, not really. It’s like… a sound that’s waiting to be heard.”

I must’ve looked confused, because she set her cup down with a little clink and sighed. “You ever been in an empty house before?” she asked. “One that hasn’t been lived in for a long time?”

I nodded.

“And did you ever notice how quiet it was?”

I shrugged. “I mean, yeah. No one’s there, so-”

“No,” she cut in. “That’s not what I mean. I mean the kind of quiet that’s too quiet. The kind where you feel like if you listen hard enough, you’ll hear something waiting on the other side of the silence.”

Something about the way she said it made the back of my neck prickle.

I knew what she meant. That heavy, unnatural kind of quiet. The kind that isn’t just an absence of noise, but something else, sitting in the silence with you.

She must’ve seen something in my face, because she nodded. “That’s what it starts as,” she said. “Just a feeling. A quiet that doesn’t sit right.”

I waited for her to keep going, but she just stared down at her tea, stirring slowly, watching the liquid swirl in lazy circles.

“…And?” I prompted.

Alice sighed. “And then, if you stay too long, the quiet starts to change,” she said. “You start hearing something in it.”

I smirked. “Like your own heartbeat? Your breathing?”

She shook her head. “No. Like murmuring.”

I didn’t say anything to that.

Alice shifted in her chair, running her finger along the rim of her cup. “At first, you won’t be able to make out words. Just a low, steady sound, like voices talking in another room. Far away, but getting closer. And if you stay longer…”

She hesitated again. This time, her fingers tightened around her cup.

“…If you stay longer, you start to understand them.”

The room suddenly felt a little smaller.

Alice let out a slow breath, like she was trying to shake something off. Then she smiled, tight and tired, but not unkind. “Anyway,” she said, waving a hand. “It’s just an old story. Something people used to say when I was a girl.”

I nodded, finishing the last sip of my tea. It was a good story, I had to admit. The kind of eerie folktale that probably started as a warning to keep kids from wandering into abandoned places. Alice had plenty of those, local legends, bits of small-town superstition passed down from people who barely remembered where they’d first heard them.

She didn’t say anything else after that, just started gathering the cups, moving a little slower than usual. As I stood up to leave, she let out a small hum under her breath, a soft, tuneless thing, like a habit she didn’t realize she was doing.

I didn’t think much of it. Alice did that sometimes, humming while she moved around the house, like she was keeping herself company.

The air outside was crisp when I stepped onto her porch. It was later than I realised, the sun had dipped lower, and shadows stretched long across the pavement. For some reason, the street felt quieter than usual. No passing cars, no distant hum of a lawnmower or kids shouting down the block. Just the soft creak of Alice’s old screen door as it swung shut behind me.

I hesitated at the bottom of her porch steps, adjusting my jacket against the chill. Behind me, I heard the shuffle of movement inside, Alice heading toward the kitchen, still humming softly to herself.

Then, just before I reached the gate, the humming stopped.

Not suddenly, not in any dramatic way, just… faded out. Like she’d gotten distracted by something else.

I didn’t turn back. Didn’t think much of it at all, really.

Alice had plenty of stories like this, half-forgotten folklore, strange little superstitions people used to believe in. If you’re interested, I’ll ask her for more the next time I visit.

It might take a little while, though. Work’s going to be a nightmare this week, and I don’t think I’ll have much free time. But I’ll drop by soon enough, Alice always has the kettle on, and I’m sure she’s got plenty more stories to tell.
