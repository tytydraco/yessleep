I always loved the thrill of old, abandoned houses. There’s something fascinating about wandering through a place where time seems to stand still, each creak of the floorboards and draft of cold air telling stories of lives once lived. Last month, my friends and I decided to explore an old Victorian mansion on the outskirts of town. It had been vacant for decades, rumored to be haunted, but that only fueled our curiosity.

The mansion was a decaying marvel of gothic architecture, its windows shattered and ivy crawling up its cracked walls. We entered through a rotting door, flashlight beams cutting through the dense dust. The place was as eerie as expected—creaky stairs, dusty furniture, and the occasional scurry of rats.

We spent hours roaming the house, capturing photos and recording our findings. It wasn’t until we reached the master bedroom on the top floor that things started to feel unsettling. The room was dominated by an enormous, ornate mirror. It was covered in a thick layer of grime, but it seemed oddly pristine compared to the rest of the room.

For some reason, I felt drawn to it. The mirror was framed in elaborate gold, its surface reflecting the dim light of our flashlights in a way that made it seem almost alive. As I wiped the dust away, a chill ran down my spine. The reflection showed the room behind me, but there was something off—an extra shadow, dark and shapeless, lurking just beyond the edges of the room in the glass.

I thought it was a trick of the light or perhaps my imagination running wild. I mentioned it to my friends, but they laughed it off. We joked about the ghost stories we’d heard about the place, but my unease persisted. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.

Later that night, after we had left the mansion and were back in the safety of our homes, I reviewed the footage and photos we’d taken. When I came across the images of the mirror, my blood ran cold. In every single photo, the shadowy figure was there—hovering in the reflection, but never visible in the actual room.

That’s when things started to get really strange. Over the next few days, I began to notice a figure watching me from the edges of my vision. It was always fleeting—a dark shape slipping just beyond my sight. I thought it was stress or exhaustion until I began to see it more clearly. The figure was identical to the shadow in the mirror—a tall, gaunt man with hollow eyes and a face twisted into a grotesque grin.

One night, as I lay in bed, I heard a soft scratching sound coming from my bedroom mirror. I turned on the light, but nothing was there. The sound continued, louder and more frantic, as if someone was trying to break through from the other side.

Desperate to end the nightmare, I went back to the mansion with a friend, hoping to find some explanation or closure. We returned to the master bedroom, and the mirror was still there, untouched. But as I stared into it, the shadowy figure appeared again, clearer than before. This time, it was no longer just a shadow—it was a man, grinning wickedly, his eyes locked onto mine.

I reached out to the mirror, but before I could touch it, a freezing cold hand gripped my shoulder. I turned to see my friend’s terrified face, and when I looked back at the mirror, the man was gone. We fled the mansion, never looking back.

Since that night, the shadow has become more than just a fleeting presence. It follows me everywhere, appearing in mirrors, windows, and even in dark reflections. I’ve tried to move, but no matter where I go, the figure finds me. The scratching in the mirror has grown louder, more insistent. It’s as if something—or someone—is trying to break free from the other side.

If you ever find yourself in an old, decaying mansion, and you come across a mirror that seems too clean, too pristine for the surrounding decay—don’t look into it. Don’t even touch it. Whatever you do, don’t invite the man in the mirror into your world. Trust me, you don’t want to know what he wants.
