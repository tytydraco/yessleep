After the hurricane, our village went dark — no power, no signal, just the wind whispering through the cornfields like something old and wrong. My uncle’s wooden house stood two kilometers from the nearest neighbor. It was already quiet before. Now it felt… post-mortem.

The generator hummed in the basement — steady, low, unchanging. But if you listened long enough, it started to tickle just under your ribs.

I sat on the porch with a mug of warm beer, staring into the fog. And I could feel it — the silence was wrong. Too thick. Like the world was holding its breath.

My uncle hadn’t left his room in three days. I brought him food, but he said nothing. Just a soft scraping sound from behind the door, like something being moved on the floor. The hallway cameras glowed with a dead red light. He’d installed them last year when he started mumbling about being watched. I laughed at first. Then I stopped.

It wasn’t what he said. It was his left eye — the fake one. Glassy, dead. But somehow… it saw too much. I avoided his face, not out of fear, but unease. That eye didn’t blink. And even with the door closed, I felt it watching.

That night, I woke to a thump. Deep. Wet. Not thunder. Outside was still. The generator hummed as always — but under it, something echoed.

Thump-thump… thump… thump-thump…

A slow, pulsing sound. Not mechanical. Not natural. Alive.

I walked the hallway barefoot, phone light trembling. One of the monitors was black. The door to my uncle’s room stood wide open.

He was gone.

The pulse was louder now. It was coming from below — the basement. The generator’s hum and the pulse fused together. Like breath and heartbeat. I froze on the top step, listening.

I remembered what my uncle once said, in a tone too calm to be sane:
“The generator isn’t just a motor. It transmits. It keeps the connection alive.”

Back then, I thought he’d lost it. But now — I wasn’t sure which one of us had.

His room was empty. Bed made. Nightstand bare — except for the glass eye. Just lying there. Watching.

And when I reached for my phone again — the eye wasn’t there anymore.
It was in my pocket.
And it was pulsing.

I opened the basement door. The air smelled of diesel and mold — and something sweet, rotting. The generator roared.

And underneath, the other sound — uneven. Organic.

I stepped down. The concrete floor was wet. A red line seeped from under the generator.

I opened the maintenance panel.

There, inside — was a heart. A human heart. Connected to pipes and wires. Beating. Alive.

It wasn’t my uncle’s.
It was mine.
I knew it.

Time blurred. I sat there for hours, maybe longer. I heard voices in the wires. My uncle’s voice in the vibration of the walls. I swallowed more — the white powder I was supposed to deliver to the Mexicans. It used to be product. Now it was the only thing keeping my mind from sinking.

I told myself I was in control. That it wasn’t real. That I could leave. But with every heartbeat, the walls moved. The cameras whispered.

And the eye in my pocket blinked.

When the police arrived, I was sitting on the kitchen floor, naked, trying to cut myself open. I kept saying:
“I need to stop the machine.”

One officer said the neighbors had called. Another found blood in the basement. Too much blood.

The third wore a vest that said: NARCOTICS.

He looked at me like I was already gone.
“You were using the house to cook. Out here. Quiet. No one watching. But your uncle started asking questions. You argued. You killed him.”

I wanted to scream. To tell them the heart was mine. That the generator was alive.

But I just looked at them.

They sedated me. The van doors closed. And before they did, I saw the hallway monitor.
It blinked.
Then glowed red.

Solid red.

And something inside me kept pounding.
Not a heart.
A motor.
