“Mommy, can I use your phone? I want to play Minecraft,” I ask, pulling on her sleeve. She looks down at me with that tired face she always makes when I ask her for something.
“Not right now, sweetie. I need it,” she says, turning back to her computer.

I groan and stomp off to my room. I hate when she says no. There’s nothing fun to do, and I don’t even have my tablet anymore because she took it away last night.

I sit on the floor and drag over my big bucket of Legos. It’s heavy, but I get it open and dump all the pieces out onto the rug. I start stacking them into a tower, making it as tall as my arm. But then I decide it’s a castle. I put some walls on it, a red piece for the gate, and even a little blue block on top like a flag.

After a while, I get bored. I push the Legos around with my hand and glance toward the door. Mommy’s still busy, but maybe she’ll let me use her phone this time if I ask again.

I get up and walk back to the living room. “Mommy, please? I’ll be super careful!”

She sighs and looks at me like she’s thinking. Then she picks up her old phone from the table and hands it to me. “Here. You can play with this, but just for a little while. And remember, no Minecraft—it doesn’t have internet.”

“Okay!” I grab it and run back to my room, holding it with both hands so I don’t drop it.

I plop down on my bed and turn the phone on. The screen lights up, but there’s not much to do. Most of the apps don’t work, and the games are boring. Then I find the green phone icon. It looks like the one on Mommy’s phone, so I tap it.

A bunch of numbers pop up on the screen, all lined up like on a calculator. I don’t know who to call, so I just press random buttons. One, two, three, four… I keep going until there’s a long line of numbers filling the box. It looks silly, but it makes me laugh.

I press the green button to see what happens.

The screen changes, and it starts ringing.

I hold the phone up to my ear to listen.

The phone rings a few more times, and I’m just about to hang up when I hear someone pick up.

“Hello?” I say, smiling a little. I don’t know who’s on the other end, but it’s exciting.

There’s silence for a second. Then, all of a sudden, a man’s voice shouts, loud and panicked:

“OH SHIT, THEY FOUND US!”

The sound nearly makes me drop the phone. My hand tightens around it, and I sit up straighter on the bed. In the background, I hear what sounds like a bunch of people running. Their footsteps thud, and voices overlap as they yell things I can’t quite make out. It’s chaos—loud, messy chaos—like the cartoons where people are running around in every direction at once.

I hold the phone tighter, my heart beating weird and fast. “Uh… hello?” I say again, quieter this time.

No one answers. The man’s voice keeps shouting things I don’t understand, and the running noises get louder, like they’re coming closer. There’s a crash, like something big fell over, and then someone screams.

I don’t know what’s going on. It doesn’t sound like a prank, but it doesn’t sound real either. I lean closer to the phone, trying to hear better.

The noise keeps going—shouting, running, things breaking. It feels like forever, but it’s only about two minutes before it all stops.

The phone makes a weird beeping sound, and the call disconnects. I stare at the screen, my stomach feeling funny. I don’t know what just happened, but it wasn’t what I expected.

I sit there for a second, staring at the phone. My hands are shaking a little, and my heart feels like it's beating too fast. What just happened?

I don’t know what that was, but it scared me. The voices, the running, it all felt too real. I try to forget about it, but I keep hearing it in my head, like it’s still happening.

I get up and walk out of my room, still holding the phone. My feet feel heavy, like they don’t want to move. I don’t want to look behind me, but I do. The phone is still on, and I feel a little sick in my stomach.

When I get to the living room, Mommy is sitting on the couch, typing on her computer.

“I’m done with the phone,” I say, my voice quiet.

She looks at me, surprised. “You’re done so soon?”

I shrug, not looking at her. “Yeah, I was bored,” I lie, handing her the phone.

She takes it without saying anything else. I turn around and walk back to my room, still feeling weird. I sit down on the floor with my Legos, but I don’t really play. I can’t stop thinking about the call, about the yelling and the running.

I try to focus on my Legos, but every time I close my eyes, I hear those footsteps and the voices. I feel like something’s watching me, but I don’t know what.

The next morning, I wake up early and run downstairs to get my cereal. Mommy’s in the kitchen, making her coffee. I sit at the table, eating and talking to her about nothing.

After breakfast, I go outside to play. I forget all about the phone and the weird call. It’s a nice day, and I run around the yard, pretending I’m a superhero. I climb the tree, jump off the swing, and chase after the neighbor’s cat. I have so much fun, I don’t even think about the phone once.

By the time I come back inside, it’s almost lunchtime. I’m tired but happy, so I sit down on the couch and turn on the TV. My feet are sore, but it’s a good kind of sore.

Later, Mommy is sitting at the table again, looking at her phone.

“Mommy,” I say, “can I borrow your old phone again? I wanna play.”

She looks up and nods. “Sure,” she says, handing me the phone.

I run back to my room, happy to play again.

When I open the phone, the screen lights up, and I see the same numbers from yesterday. But then I see something I didn’t expect.

There’s a red circle in the corner. A missed call.

I tap it and feel my stomach turn. It’s from the same number. The one I called yesterday.

My hands start to shake. I don’t understand. The phone doesn’t have signal. How could it call me?

I feel cold. My heart starts to beat faster.

I stare at the phone, not sure what to do. And then, the phone rings.

I jump. The same number.

My fingers are stuck, and I can’t move. The ringing is loud in my ears, and I’m too scared to pick it up.

Then the ringing stops. I feel the phone buzz in my hand.

I stare at the phone, my heart pounding in my chest. The ringing stops, and I take a deep breath. My hand is shaking, but I press the green button to answer the call.

The phone crackles, and I can barely hear anything for a second. Then, suddenly, I hear something.

"THEY FOUND ME"

It’s my voice... but it’s not me…
