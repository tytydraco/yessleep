&#x200B;

Hill was sitting in our kitchen within half an hour. He was hazy-eyed and chugging coffee as quickly as James could refill his cup, but he was alert for it being the middle of the night. I was working up the nerve to ask what was in this gift when he blurted it out unprompted.

“It was a face,” Hill said, staring into his mug. “A human face. Just the face. Jesus, it was cut off clean with a razor.”

James cleared his throat. “I don’t think we need-”

“Was it a woman?” I asked. Hill nodded. “Did she look like me?”

He took a shaky breath. “Probably. At one point. The…object was distorted, stretched. Like someone was playing with it for a few days after, uh, Christ. After.”

“Did your officers see Nate leaving his house?” James asked.

“No. I checked in and the guys in the car didn’t see a damn thing. Nate went to bed around eleven, lights out around midnight, and no sign of activity between then and when I got your call three or so hours later.”

“He might have slipped out,” I suggested. “Given the cops outside the slip.”

“Maybe,” Hill agreed neutrally. “I’m going to post a unit outside your place for the next day or two. See if our friend is going for a hat trick.” The detective stood up and drained the rest of his coffee. “I’m going to head back to sleep. If you two could come into the station sometime in the morning after nine, we can talk about next steps.”

A round of quick handshakes and Hill was gone.

“Good God,” I said, collapsing into a chair in the living room, “he sent a *face*. Skinned. Peeled. Some poor-”

James put a hand on my knee. “We’re going to get him this year. He’s slipping up. Remember, he said, ‘This is the year.’ He’s right, but not in the way he thinks. Nate will not be bothering us ever again.”

“Do you really think it’s him?”

“I don’t know. Maybe. Probably. Either way, *somebody* is out there and that same somebody is **done** scaring you.” James stood up. “Look, I know you’re not a fan of violence. I appreciate that. I *love* that about you. But after the box the other day, I…I went out and bought a gun.”

“James.”

He held up his hand and then folded it down to two fingers. “A shotgun. Two barrels. Over and under, not side by side. It’s for shooting skeet. Or, you know, it can be after we’re done. For now, it’s for keeping us safe.” He looked at the baseball bat I’d left in the corner of the room. “I think it’s a good idea.”

“Where is it?”

James walked over to the coat closet between the living and dining room. He rummaged around in the back for a moment, then pulled out a long gun with a pair of black barrels stacked vertically. The shotgun ended in a glossy wooden stock. James broke it open after struggling with a switch for a moment. He pulled a small box from high up in the closet and then walked over with the gun, which was opened on a hinge just above the trigger area.

“It’s a twelve-gauge,” my husband explained, opening the box. Inside were rows of plump red cylinders that reminded me of rolled pennies. “These are the shells. All you have to do is load them in the barrels then close it.” He demonstrated, snapping the gun closed. “This is the safety. White means, ‘safe,’ and red means, ‘ready to fire.’ You point somewhere in the target’s general direction and pull the trigger. That fires one barrel. Pull it again to shoot the second. Then you press this lever-thingy to open it back up.”

I stared at the gun as he extracted the unfired shells. “James, I don’t think I could ever shoot somebody.”

He nodded. “I hope you never need to. But I feel better knowing you can protect yourself in case things hit the fan. The gun will be in the closet–unloaded–and the shells will be on the shelf above.” James kissed me on the forehead. “Let’s go back to sleep.”

We took a slow drive around the neighborhood in the morning. James protested but I wanted to make sure the squad car was still observing Nate. It turns out Hill hadn’t posted a squad car; he actually set up two undercover units. James noticed them first and only because we were looking for cops. Two non-descript sedans parked at either end of Nate’s street, each car containing two very “police” looking men. You know the type: buzz cuts, bland suits, aviator shades.

“You think they fell asleep on the job?” James asked, parking the car. “Let Nate slip out last night?”

“Maybe they’re in on it,” I joked, chuckling until I saw a hard look on my husband’s face. “Oh, come on. They’re the cops.”

James tapped a finger on the wheel. “Yeah. You’re right. The cops never do anything wrong.”

We sat for a few minutes. It was early, yet, and the clouds had that shredded wool-and-cloth look that meant more snow was likely. The radio was playing faintly, some Christmas station. One song ended with me barely listening. Then *it* came on.

*Oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh*

*Ah-ah*

*… Last Christmas, I gave you-*

I turned the radio off. I was shaking.

“We should go,” James said, pulling out from the curb. “Let’s go see Hill.”

I nodded, not trusting myself to speak. As we were driving out of the neighborhood, I glanced back down the street. Nate was standing on his porch watching us. For a second, I almost asked James to turn around but I decided I wasn’t ready to confront my old stalker yet. Not until we had proof he’d been tormenting me for the last decade.

Not until I was sure he was my sick, secret admirer and giver of gifts.

Hill’s office was a lot like the detective who occupied it: basic, tidy, boring. The most interesting thing I observed was a collection of those bobblehead-type figures–funky something–sitting on a shelf behind his desk. Each of the little statues was from a popular horror movie; I recognized more than half even if I didn’t know all of their names. There was chainsaw butcher guy, dude in the hockey mask, burned-up finger claw fella, and maybe a dozen others.

“Didn’t realize you were a horror fan,” James remarked, also studying the figures.

“Huge,” Hill admitted. “Basically a horror and true crime junkie. My only vice. Other than all the other vices.”

He winked. I smiled back but felt a little uncomfortable, though I couldn’t put a finger on why.

“I double-checked with my guys in your neighborhood,” Hill continued. “Nobody saw a thing. I’ve put a unit outside of your house but I can only justify keeping these folks on overtime for a few days. I’m going to pull them all back Saturday. Just a heads up.”

James was squeezing the arm of his chair. “And if Nate shows up after that?”

“We’ll get him–*if* it’s him–eventually,” Hill promised. “I don’t plan on letting this gruesome gift crap continue for another decade, no knock on my predecessor.”

“How did our case end up on your desk?” I asked.

“I requested it after Jim retired.”

“Why?”

Hill took a moment to answer. “Emma, James, I’ll level with you: I think what’s been happening to you is fascinating.” James raised an eyebrow and Hill spread his palms in a calming gesture. “Okay, not the best word choice but you see what I mean, right? Ten years of untraceable Christmas gifts, each box containing a body part. When he sends fingers the prints are burned off. Skulls come with the teeth removed to prevent identification by dental records. He even drains the parts of blood and pumps bleach through to clean them out.”

I felt my stomach flip. “I didn’t know that.”

Hill was smiling, not looking at me. “It’s, I mean, it’s a little genius and *deeply* unique. Have you ever thought about selling your story?”

“Excuse me?” James asked.

“You know, a book deal. A podcast. ‘Sadistic Santa Claus and his Grisly Gifts.’ Something like that.”

“That’s not really…I don’t really want to talk about that,” I said. I could sense James was about to get a harsher reply so I changed the subject. “Can you at least bring Nate in for questioning?”

Hill frowned, clearly wanting to go on the book sale topic.

“Without any proof, there’s not a lot that will accomplish.”

“Maybe he’ll crack under the pressure,” James suggested.

“Is that what happened to get him to leave Emma alone the first time?” Hill asked. “Did you, uh, ‘crack’ him under pressure.”

I saw James’ eye twitch. “I just had a talk with him.”

“Just like that? And months of stalking and incidents stopped?”

“Just like that,” James said, coldly.

Hill leaned back in his chair. “I’ve been looking through the files on that. Emma, you never actually *saw* Nate messing with your car or breaking windows, right?”

“Yeah. Yes, *but* I did notice him following me many times after we broke up.”

“And he would knock on the door and call at odd hours, correct?”

“Correct.”

“But–again–you never saw him or talked to him directly?”

“What are you implying?” I asked.

“Not a thing,” Hill replied. “I’m just getting my ducks in a row.”

I stood up. “If you don’t talk to Nate, I’m going to.”

“I wouldn’t recommend that, Emma. I really would not.” Hill glanced at my husband. “Both of you should stay far away from this man. Let us do our jobs.”

“First time for everything,” James muttered.

We left Hill in his office sitting under his shelf of horror toys. The drive back home was silent without conversation or radio. As we pulled into the drive, James took a breath.

“I agree with you,” he said.

“About what?”

He gave me a long look. James had put on a little weight during our marriage but still had the scrappy, athletic vibe that drove me wild when we first met. His eyes were so blue they seemed painted on. And, at that moment, those eyes were colder than I’d ever seen them.

“This ends this year,” James promised. “No more us being afraid to open the door every December. No more taking long trips knowing that the packages would be waiting. No more fear.”

I felt a rush of love, primal love.

“Okay,” I said. “But what’s the plan? We can’t just invite him over for coffee to catch up?”

A little smile tugged at my husband’s lips. “Why not?”

The plan was a simple one: we waited until the weekend when the cops would be gone. I still had Nate’s number in my phone ten years later (though it was blocked). The gist was that James and I would invite Nate over to try to bury the hatchet. It was a decade after all the mess, after all. James figured that if Nate really was innocent, he’d be happy to clear the air and wouldn’t even know about the deliveries I’d been receiving. But, if Nate was behind it, how could he resist talking to me again in person?

Unfortunately, Nate must have changed his number because my texts all bounced back. However, I was able to find him on social media, and just like James predicted, my ex was all too eager to chat. I made a completely fresh account with no information other than my name and picture for the exchange. Nate told me he’d actually been working up the nerve to contact me after seeing me in the neighborhood. He said it felt like fate that he ended up moving in only a block away.

“I’m not saying it’s a second chance,” my ex said, “and I know you’re probably married, but maybe we could be friends?”

I told him I think maybe we could and invited him over for coffee that same evening.

Nate showed up promptly at 9 pm freshly shaved and wearing a black blazer over a t-shirt and jeans. I recognized it immediately as his “casual formal” look from when we went on dates to nicer places. He even wore something like that to prom, like he was allergic to ties or suit pants.

“Emma, you look amazing,” Nate said, accepting my handshake though I knew he wanted a hug. “You haven’t changed. Still a stunner.”

I smiled. “And you’re still a charmer. Come on in.”

I closed the door behind him and led him toward the kitchen.

“Beautiful house,” Nate remarked, biting his lip. “Look, I just want to get it out there that I really appreciate you-”

Nate stopped when we got into the kitchen and he saw James standing at the counter, pouring coffee. For a second, I almost thought Nate would run.

“What’s he doing here?” my ex whispered.

“Well, we’re married.”

“You married *him*?”

“It’s good to see you too, bud,” James replied, setting three coffee mugs on the table. He patted a chair. “Have a seat.”

Nate didn’t move.

“It’s okay,” I promised, taking his hand. “I told you I was married.”

“Yeah, but you didn’t say to whom.”

James held up his hands in surrender. “I know you and I didn’t get along when we first met.”

“No kidding.”

“I’m here to make peace,” my husband continued. “We were practically kids back then. We’re adults now. Let’s bury it.”

Nate glanced at me, then back at the door. I figured he might be nervous to see James. I knew my husband probably confronted him harshly about the stalking but this was a whole different level. Nate reminded me of a rabbit who wandered into a doghouse.

“Please,” I said, tugging on his hand. “We’re just going to talk.”

Nate reluctantly allowed me to lead him to the table. We all sat quietly for a moment, drinking our coffee. I saw Nate’s mug had a slight tremor. Eventually, he calmed down enough that I was ready to ask him straight out about the gifts. But James started before I could.

“What are you doing in this neighborhood?” he asked, his eyes with that distant, icy look again. A blue sky threatening snow.  “I told you to stay away.”

“I-I didn’t know this was where you lived. I swear. It’s a coincidence.”

“You said, ‘fate,’ when we talked earlier,” I reminded him.

“Fate?” James asked. “Like a love story?”

Nate kept opening and closing his mouth. “That’s not what I meant.”

“You’re saying my wife is lying?”

“No! No.” Nate turned to me. “I’m not here to try anything. I promise. I thought you just wanted to clear things up.”

“Why did you stalk me? Why did you slash my tires? You made me feel unsafe, terrified.”

Nate shook his head. “I didn’t! I never did any of that. Okay–okay, I *did* follow you around a little after we broke up. But that was just me being lovesick. I never did any of the other stuff the police talked to me about.”

He sounded so convincing, so honest. It didn’t make sense. I decided to dive into the deep end.

“Nate, have you been leaving…gifts for me every December? I’ve been getting *unusual* packages every year for the last decade.”

“What? No. Of course not. I didn’t even know where you lived until a week ago. And, even if I did,” he looked at James, “I knew I was supposed to stay away.”

James drained the last of his coffee. “So it really was a coincidence you moved in down the street from us? Just bad luck?”

“*Yes*,” Nate hissed. “I’m swearing to you, on my life. Random. Stupid. Chance.”

James nodded and stood up. “Could be but, personally, now I’m thinking it was fate. I knew when I saw you moving in a few weeks ago that this was going to be the year.” He walked over to the coffee pot. “Anybody want a refill?”

Nate was staring at me, his eyes pleading. There was a roaring in my ears. My pulse. Everything James said was clicking into place. He was humming as he poured another cup of coffee.

*Hmmm hmm hmm, hmm hmm hmm hmmm hmmmm*.

I recognized the tune from the card and the car.

“James?” I said. “You said you saw Nate move in weeks ago? Why wouldn’t you tell me that?”

Nate leaned forward and gripped my arm. “*Please*,” he whispered. “Whatever you think I did, don’t let him-”

“James!” I screamed.

He moved so fast. One second he was at the counter, the next he was smashing the half-filled coffee pot over the back of Nate’s head. My ex screamed, his scalp torn up by the boiling liquid and broken glass. The scream was cut short as James wrapped a strong arm around Nate’s throat from behind in a chokehold. I stood up so quickly my chair fell but after that, I was frozen. Nate’s face was red, both from burns and from lack of air. I didn’t know what to do. Nothing made sense.

Then my husband winked, forearm still slowly crushing the other man’s windpipe.

“I told you this would be our year, Emma,” he said. “I’ve been waiting to tell you for so long; ever since the first time I saw you. But it was *so hard* to express how I felt about you.”

Nate’s eyes were going back into his head, his arms falling limp. I saw tears going down his cheeks. I looked over at James with his wide, hungry grin. That got me moving.

“Where are you going?” my husband called out cheerfully.

Twenty steps or so to the closet. A few seconds fumbling for the gun in the back including a false start grabbing an umbrella. A couple of heartbeats were spent struggling with the lever, all the while wondering if I’d feel James’ arm snake around my own throat. Two bright red shells like small firecrackers, one in each barrel. I swiveled with the gun to find James standing in the space between the kitchen and living room, Nate’s unconscious–or dead–body held in front of him.

“I’m sorry I took so long to tell you,” James said, his grin a little softer now. “I followed you for months. Took care of the competition. Ya know, I even thought that once we were together it might be enough. I might be satisfied. But there was so much love it made me ill, overwhelmed me, tore up my guts. You ever see a puppy so cute you want to squeeze it to death? You know that feeling, right? That’s how I felt every time I looked at you, every morning I woke up next to you. I had to find girls just a little like you or maybe I would have needed to squeeze *you*.” He frowned. “I don’t want you to think I did anything with them inappropriate. I’ve always been faithful.”

“You killed them?”

“After I hurt them, yes.”

I had a finger on the trigger but knew I’d hit Nate if I fired. If I *could* fire. It all seemed like a nightmare I would wake up from at any minute.

“Why send me the…the *pieces*?” I asked, voice breaking.

James smiled like it was the most obvious thing in the world. “To show you how much I loved you. How much I thought about you. Constantly. And those girls, the ones that reminded me of you, how dare they, you know? How dare they act like they were your competition?”

“That’s insane.”

“Hey, don’t be mean. Honestly, can you think of a more unique gift? It doesn’t make you feel special?”

Before I could think of a reply, James suddenly shoved Nate towards me. I fired on reflex, blasting a red chunk from my ex-boyfriend's ribs.

“Nate!” I shrieked, stunned.

James was on me before I remembered I had a second shot. I felt a heavy fist sink so far into my stomach that I worried it would push out through the other side. I folded up, not blacking out but seeing spots. For a long time, all I could do was try to catch my breath curled into a fetal position on the rug. I heard a ripping sound and then footsteps going back into the kitchen. James came back and stood just behind me. Music drifted to me from the kitchen, dreadful and familiar.

*Oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh*

*Ah-ah*

*… Last Christmas, I gave you my heart*

*But the very next day, you gave it away*

*This year, to save me from tears, I’ll give it to someone special*

“You need some time to process this,” I heard my husband say from above me. “I understand. Don’t worry; I’ll be around. I’ll know when you’re ready.”

Something warm and heavy landed in the space between my arms and face. I kept my eyes closed but the smell made me gag.

“This is *our* year,” James said, leaning down to kiss my hair.

Then he was walking away, humming along with that song. I thought about the gun, about trying to stop him, but it hurt so bad just breathing. I found out later he’d cracked two of my ribs. It was a long time before I opened my eyes. It hurt so much to scream, the pain ripping up my side like a striking match.

Nate’s wet, purple-red heart lay on the floor inches from my face. I cried, and that hurt, too. My phone was in the kitchen and the music got louder as I crawled across the floor.

*"Merry Christmas, " I wrapped it up and sent it*

*With a note saying, "I love you, " I meant it*

*Now I know what a fool I've been*

*But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me* [again](https://www.travisbrownwriting.com/)
