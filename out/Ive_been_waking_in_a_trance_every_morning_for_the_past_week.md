The recurring pattern in which I've found myself for the last week exhibits itself as follows:

It begins always with a rich and fulfilling sleep. This is interrupted by a startling awakening, which brings with it an anxiety so disorienting and profound that for fifteen minutes or so, I'm reduced to the irrational behaviours of a mad person.

I rise and hurridly drink the air in three deep breaths, as if in my sleep I've been completely deprived of all oxygen. Then I am held captive by a paranoia, sending suspicious glances careering out into the darkness. I am yet to see anything. Inevitably, I rest my head back down again onto its pillow and, briefly, try to sleep. Sleep however does not come. Instead, I find the disquiet growing in intensity, and become compelled to rise again, to take 3 more breaths, and to investigate the darkened room with my eyes once more.

This cycle, as I have come to know it, repeats itself many times for a period of around twenty-five minutes. I know this because of the clock I have hanging on my wall that always reads 06:09 when I wake and usually reads a time around 06:33 when I finally manage to shake myself free and emerge from the bizarre state.

The first occurrence of these behaviours was initially a source of great amusement for me. How fallible the brain is, I mused to myself as I stewed my morning cup of tea, so marvellous and so complex yet so prone to error and misjudgment. Then I went about my day, and paid it little mind.

Upon the third morning, all thoughts of amusement had faded. Though I could shake myself from the unusual trance, I could no longer shake the unsettled feeling and the anxiety that accompanied it. I developed, what I thought of as, a peculiarly specific and quite irrational fear; that in the grainy dark-light of 06:09 AM, there was some kind of Thing in the room with me. Some unnatural Thing that was triggering an innate fight or flight response in me. Even as I pen this now, it is hard for me to know for certain what the reality of the situation is.

In true fact, there are only two unnatural occurrences that took place outside of my mind, only two that I can be completely sure of.

The first happened on the sixth morning. I had awoken in the same fashion as the previous nights, however, on this morning, I felt a part of my psyche wanted to resist, to fight back against the compulsions.

I focused myself, switching my concentration from the cycle of anxieties and fear in which I'd been trapped, and instead, turning my attention to the lamp upon my bedside table. Fixing my mind to the idea of switching on the light, I somehow managed to free myself from the grips of my trance.

The very moment I released the switch of the lamp, a gust of wind hit my windows with the force of a wave risen by a storm and breaking on the base of a cliff. The unexpected gale tore through the gaps, tearing open the windows with a thunderous clap as wood cracked on wood.

Simultaneously, the light, which fleetingly sprung to life in a hue of warm orange, exploded. For a fraction of a second, as the lightbulb burst, it emitted a wondrous and terrible shade of electric blue, filling the room like many strikes of lightning.

Then darkness.

The wind howled through the unlit room, bringing forth its freezing temperament. Knowing my way around my room in either darkness or light, I leapt up to close the windows shut, then hurried out, towards my kitchen. As I tried to turn on the rest of the lights in my house, I found every one broken. I suspected they'd been rendered unusable by the strange surge of blue energy I'd just witnessed.

Upon retrieving some old candles tucked away in a drawer, I managed to light the kitchen. I noticed the clocks still seemed to be in working order, this led me to an interesting, if a little vague, hypothesis.

On the seventh, and most recent, night, I somehow fell into sleep, even through my genuine and rational terror. Earlier I'd paid a visit to my local high street to acquire some carpentry vices and electronics, and had since clamped all the windows shut tight and placed on my bedside table a small battery-operated radio and a torch.

Sure enough, I woke up at 06:09 AM, and this time I focused the entirety of my mental efforts to the idea of turning on the small torch beside me.

Once again I broke free from the strange and cycling affliction that had been hounding me and reached out to the little torch. The wind howled, but could do little now except throw itself against the firmly sealed windows.

Defiantly, I turned the torch on. It flickered to life. No shattering bulb, no electric blue light. My theory seemed to hold true, the phenomena was unable to affect electronic devices unconnected to the mains power. Shining it round the room I was relieved, and a little disappointed, to find nothing at all.

Then I turned on the radio. At first, I found only static, and as I scrubbed through, I could find nothing at any of the frequencies with which I was familiar.

However, at the very end of the FM radio spectrum, I did find one thing, although I wish now that I had not. The station played nothing that any person of sound mind would call music, nor any talking in any language I understand or could recognise. The audio, which crept out from waves of undulating static, sounded nothing more and nothing less than the wails of all the damned souls on earth.

As I write this now, at half of three in the morning, I have nothing of consequence to add. All I can tell you is that I'm now loathe to sleep, because I'm terrified to wake up in that cycling state of mind, and even more terrified of what I may discover if I try to fight it once more.
