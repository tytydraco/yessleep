Hi. My name is Liisa. I’m not really sure how to start my story. It’s not exactly my story, though. It’s the story of my cousin, Emilia. I’m sorry for any formatting issues, I’m on moblie.

We’re a Finnish family, and although we are cousins me and Emilia were raised like siblings. She was a couple years younger than me, but we were joined at the hip nonetheless. In Finnish, the name ‘Emilia’ means “to strive”, and Emilia certainly lived up to that legacy. She was top of her class, athletic, well-spoken and social. She was years ahed of her classmates, mentally and academically. My mother often called her an “old soul”, on account of her wise, sometimes jaded outlook on life. One of the areas she succeeded in the most was swimming. Emilia was a natural in the water, ever since birth. And she got a lot of practice, too.

In the summer, my family and Emilia’s went on a two-week holiday to our grandmother’s home in Lakeland. If you don’t know, Lakeland is true to its name. It’s a large lake region in Finland, with a forest-covered landscape surrounding. It’s a beautiful place, and if Emilia’s fate had been different I would have definitely recommended visiting. 

Emilia and I spent almost all day by the lakes. I rarely joined her while swimming, as I was a weak swimmer at best, but I always sat by the shore to keep her company. Our grandmother would scold us when we were out after dark, though. She was especially hard on Emilia, as she was more likely to get caught in a dangerous situation than me. One particular morning, August 9th 1996, she was very upset at us. I remember she stopped us at the door before we left.
“Children, no! Today is a bad day! I feel it…” She clutched her heart, a desperate look on her face.
“Äiti, leave them. They want to play.” My aunt said, as she gently steered my grandmother away. She wouldn’t relent, though.
“No, they mustn’t. The näkki, she is out.” The näkki. Our grandmother had told us about them since I could remember.

The näkki are a type of demonic jinn, that can disguise themselves as many things, often a silver fish or a three breasted woman. They lurk around lakes, preying on bathers or young children. I’d always shrugged it off when grandma had warned us before, but something felt different this time. Deep down, I knew she was right. Unfortunately, Emilia didn’t share my feeling of dread.

“I want to go and play, Äiti!” My cousin begged, and her mother nodded.
“On you go. Liisa, are you going too?” My aunt asked. I shook my head.
“Emilia, stay close to the cabin. Don’t wander. Come in for lunch, and be back when the moon is high.” Emilia was warned. She nodded. Emilia ran out the door, into the blinding sunlight.

Throughout the whole day, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Emilia was in trouble. She had come in for her lunch, and she had seemed fine then, but now the moon was up and she wasn’t home. I volunteered to go and fetch her, as I was the only one who knew her hiding spots.

It didn’t take me long to find Emilia. She was wading in one of the smaller lakes, around the back of the cabin. She was about 15 meters away, so I didn’t call out to her. Maybe I should’ve. Maybe she would’ve swam over, and the woman would’ve left her alone.

The woman was tall, at least 6 foot, even in the lake. Her hair was dark, long, and decorated with leaves and twigs. Her skin was a dark, muddy green. And, as my eyes scanned her, terror washed over me like a swampy wave. Three breasts. I knew what she was. A näkki. 

I tried to call out, I really did. But my voice was caught in my throat. I tried to run, but I was held in place, an unwilling spectator to the horror show that was about to reach its climax. I saw the figure dip under the surface of the lake, and silently swim towards Emilia. Emilia was bobbing in the water, not knowing of what was to come. 

In the blink of an eye, Emilia was pulled under water. She let out a blood curdling scream, sending birds flying out of the surrounding trees. The water around her seemed like a whirlpool as she thrashed, swimming for her life. But it was no use. Emilia was dragged down to the depths of the lake, never to be seen again.

Emilia was reported as a missing person within the next hour. Search parties turned the lakes upside down for days trying to find her, but I knew they wouldn’t find her. Not that I could say that, of course. The case made headlines globally, and has since appeared on more true crime podcasts than I can count. Some say she was abducted by a suspicious-looking fisherman that lived about 2 miles from grandma’s house. Some say that I drowned her and buried the body under some old cabin, a story that greatly harmed my chances of a career, by the way. The police ruled it as a “tragic swimming accident”. Bullshit. 

I’m not sure if this story really has a moral. If it did, it would probably be “listen to your elders” or “watch out for shapeshifting demons the next time you’re at a lake in Finland”. I don’t know. What I do know, is that what happened to my cousin wasn’t a “tragic accident”.  And, you know what, maybe you SHOULD watch out for shapeshifting demons next to Finnish lakes. It might just save your life.
