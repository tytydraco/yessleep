My name is James Watson. I’m a first-year medical student at Columbia University. 24 years old, living in New York City. My life was pretty ordinary. Had a few hobbies. Hiking, biking, video games. But most of my time was studying, going to classes or doing shifts at the hospital.

My story starts at a Christmas party with my med school classmates, faculty and the staff. The party was at a hotel a few blocks away from Central Park. I’m not very good at social gatherings. But I knew I had to go. At the party, I noticed a girl. She had dark hair. Had a black dress on. Had a lean physique. The reason she stood out to me was because she didn’t look like she belonged. She looked around 20 or 21 years old. A few years younger than me. She didn’t look like a med student. I decided to approach her out of curiosity.

“Hi, my names James Watson”, I shook her hand. “I’m a first-year med student”.

“The names Synthia Holmes”, she smiled. “I’m a student at Julliard. I play the violin”.

“Holmes and Watson. Like Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson?”, we both chuckled. “Julliard? That’s very interesting. What brings you here?”.

She suddenly got a text message. After looking at her phone. She said, “Sorry, I have to go. Nice meeting you!”.

She then left. I just shrugged it off. Didn’t know what brought her to the party. But not really my business. Maybe someone invited her as a date. The party ended around midnight. I was about to enter the metro station nearby to get back to my apartment in Woodside, Queens when a cop said, “Can’t do that. F trains not in service. Have to go to another station.”

This annoyed me, because I would have to walk through parts of central park to get to the next nearest metro station. Should I take uber or taxi? Nah, I thought. I had a 30 day unlimited metro pass and didn’t want to waste money.

So I decided to walk through central park. I immediately felt uneasy.  For one, no one was around but it felt like someone was watching me. I stopped in my tracks and then heard footsteps abruptly stop behind me. I decided to speed up my pace and then I heard footsteps behind me speeding up its pace. I started to run and heard the footsteps running too. I immediately start sprinting for my life not knowing where I was going. Suddenly, I was backed up in a corner. What I saw was a man grotesque in appearance. It was incredibly pale, fangs, long nails and skinny fingers. It started to approach me. I was paralyzed in fear.

It continued to get closer and closer to me. Move! Move! I said in my head. But my body just wouldn’t do what my mind was thinking. It was now a few feet away from me. It reached out one with who one of its slender fingers, about to touch me. I gave up hope and accepted my fate at that point. Then suddenly its arm fell off and blood gushed everywhere, a lot of it getting on me. The monster screamed in agony. What the hell happened? I thought to myself. I looked up.

“Holmes?”, I whispered in confusion. She no longer wore the black dress but a hoody, jeans and had a sword in her hands, the blade covered with water. She then took out a wooden stake and stabbed the monster in the heart. The monster screamed in pain and died.

“What was that?”, I asked.

She looked back at me, “A vampire. Quite a few of them in NYC. Judging by its appearance, I would say it was a few centuries old”.

“A … a vampire?”, I asked, “That can’t be. I don’t believe you”.

“Whatever, it doesn’t matter to me”, she took out the stake from the vampire’s heart. And wiped her wet sword with a towel.

“Why is your sword wet?”.

“Holy water.”, she replied. “That’s why I was able to cut off the vampire’s arm. Holy water hurts vampires”.

“Who are you?”, I asked.

“I’m just an ordinary human. But my job is unusual. I hunt supernatural beings. Ghosts, demons, monsters. It doesn’t matter”, she explained. “I also have the psychic ability to see and communicate with demons and ghosts”.

“Psychic abilities?”, I replied. “You must have more powers than that. I saw you chop off that vampire’s arm”.

“No, being psychic is the only power I have. As I said, I used the sword covered with holy water to cut off its arm. I use special items or trinkets such as swords or scrolls to kill or capture supernatural beings”.

“Where did you learn to do that?”.

“It’s a family business. My grandpa trained me”, she replied. “We’ve been doing this for generations”.

“Why were you at the party?”.

“I heard the vampire was at the hotel. I tried to blend in at the party and investigate. But then I got a text saying the vampire was on to me and fled to Central Park looking for a victim”.

She looked at her phone. “Got a text. Looks like I have another job”, she grinned. “I’ll see you later. Don’t tell anyone about this… Fuck it. Tell them if you want. No one would believe you. A cleanup crew will come by and get rid of the vampire”

She passed me her business card. “Contact this number if you ever have another encounter”, she said. “I charge $20 an hour”.

“Thanks”, I said putting the card in my pocket. “But I hope I’ll never have to see you again”.

I managed to get back home. I took a shower and went to bed. I woke up the next morning doubting what had happened yesterday. Must have got a bit drunk and had an encounter with a junky in Central Park or something. But then I saw my bloody clothes in the laundry basket. I then remember the blood was from the vampire, when its arm was chopped off its blood gushed all over me. I also saw Holme’s business card on my kitchen counter. 

A week had passed. I went about my ordinary business. I had night shift at the hospital. At the hospital lived a cat named Toby. Toby is a very sweet and well-behaved cat. However, the strange thing about Toby is he always lies on the bed of patients that will die the next day. The hospital staff tried to hide this to not cause panic for the patients when the cat lies on their beds. However, the patients soon picked up on it. However, most of the patients accepted their fate without panicking.

Anyway, the first half of the night shift was pretty boring. I was doing some paperwork when I noticed Toby staring at me from the open office door entrance.

“What’s wrong?”, I asked. “You want me to follow you?”.

Toby then ran out into the hallway, I followed. He took me to a patient named Mr. Lee’s room. Mr. Lee was in good condition and was going to leave in the morning. He was awake and looked terrified.

“Mr. Lee, what’s wrong?”, I asked.

He suddenly turned his head towards me. He just noticed me. “Something’s in here”, he replied. “I don’t know. I can’t see it, but I can feel it’s presence. I can feel it breathing down my neck.”

“Mr. Lee. You’ll be fine”, I smiled. “There’s nothing here. You’re just a bit excited. You’ll go home in a few hours!”.

He gave me a weak smile. “Yeah, you’re right. Must be the excitement and my imagination”.

I went back to my office and worked on paperwork. Around 6 am, near the end of my shift, I did a checkup on all of the patients. When I entered Mr. Lee’s room, I stared in horror. He was dead. His face morphed and contorted into a grotesque shape. I couldn’t even recognize him.

The police came in, but they couldn’t do anything about it. At the end of my shift one of the nurses told me. “This is the fifth one this year.”

“Fifth one?”, I asked.

“Yeah, five patients were about to go home the next day. But they end up dead in the morning with their faces all mutilated. Some people say this place is haunted”.

When I got home, my head was still racing with what just happened. I couldn’t get the picture of poor Mr. Lee’s mutilated face out of my mind. Then I suddenly thought of something. I opened my kitchen drawer and found Synthia Holme’s business card. I called the number.

“Hello!”, a man immediately barked from the other end. This completely shocked me.

“Oh, sorry”, I replied after composing myself. “This must be the wrong number. I’m looking for a Synthia Holmes“.

“Oh, yes. I’m her grandfather. Call me Mr. Hudson”, Mr. Hudson yelled.

“Oh, thank you Mr. Hudson. I believe there’s a hospital that might be haunted and I would like your service”.

Mr. Hudson gave me an address in Brooklyn, 221B Banker Street. I went there by train the next day. What I found was an antique shop. As soon as I entered the antique shop, I heard someone playing the violin. It was Holmes. She stopped playing.

She exclaimed, “Watson!”.

“This is my grandpa. I call him Grandpa Hudson”.

Next to her was a man in his 70’s. Gray hair, 6 feet tall. Fit for his age. He was probably very handsome when he was younger.

“Nice to meet you”, Grandpa Hudson said shaking my hand. “I’ve taught Synthia everything I know. But I’m retired now. She’s now in charge of the business.”

I then told them everything that happened in the hospital that night. They listened intently without any questions.

“Interesting”, she said after I told the story.

“Based on its actions, I don’t think it’s a demon. If I were to guess, it’s a vengeful ghost. I’ll come with you to the hospital tonight and catch the ghost”.

“How would you catch the ghost?”, I asked.

“Elementary, my dear Watson”, she said.

“Ha ha”, I replied sarcastically.

She then started rummaging through the antiques in her store until she picked up an urn.

“An urn?”, I asked.

“I see”, Grandpa Huson chuckled, “It’s not just any urn. It’s a special urn that you can use to traps ghosts”.

“Why don’t you use that badass sword like you did with the vampire?”, I asked.

“Because it’s not a monster, dummy”, she replied. “It doesn’t have a physical body. I can’t kill or harm it. It’s already dead. However, I can communicate with it using my psychic powers. Also, I can trap it”.

She then paused and stared at me for a few seconds. “I’ll also need your help”.

That night we took the train together to the hospital. During the train ride I asked her a few questions.

“So, how many of you are there?”, I asked.

She replied, “There are estimated to be only around quarter of a million psychics in the entire world. However, no one knows for sure. Of those quarter of a million, 50 percent of them are unaware they’re even psychic. And I would say only 1 percent of the 50 percent who do know they’re psychic hunt supernatural beings like I do.”

“I see”, I said. “What do the other psychics do?”.

“Whatever they want. Help others communicate with loved ones, help spirits find peace or just ignore their abilities entirely. Among other things”.

“Is it genetic?”.

“A lot of the time it is. My family has been psychic for generations. But it’s possible to have normal parents and end up being a psychic”.

“If you don’t mind me asking”, I said hesitantly, “What happened to your parents?”.

“Yeah, I don’t want to talk about it. Sorry, I hope you understand. My grandpa has taken care of me since I was 6. Taught me everything he knows.”

We eventually made it to the hospital. Toby was at the entrance like he was expecting us.

“Toby, I’m assuming”, she inquired.

“Yes”.

“I see”, she smiled. “The cat’s psychic”.

“Wait. Animals can be psychic too?”.

“Yes, especially cats”. She knelt down and touched the cat. “Show me the way”.

The cat immediately started running and we followed. We ended up in another patient’s room. Ms. Gibson, she was going back home in the morning.

“What’s wrong?”, she asked with confusing.

Holmes whispered to me, “Can you take her to a different room? I plan on communicating with the ghost and want to be alone”.

I nodded and took Ms. Gibson to a different room. Ms. Gibson was obviously confused. After talking with her and calming her down, I went back to the other room where Holmes was at.

“I just talked with the ghost. Her name is Felicia Andrews”, Holmes said.

“What now?”, I asked.

“I can either trap her in the urn. Or I can free her soul by finally putting her at peace. I honestly don’t want to trap her in the urn. It’s not the most humane thing to do to trap a soul in an urn. However, to put her soul at peace, I would need to convince her. I would need to learn more about her past”.

Holmes and I went to the hospital archives room and looked for records of Felcia Andrews to learn about her past. After an hour or so of looking, I found her records.

“Holmes!”, I yelled to get her attention. “Look at this”.

Turns out Felicia Andrews was a patient at this hospital in the 60’s. She had a serious illness, the doctors thought she would die. But she made a miraculous recovery. However, the day she left the hospital, she got run over by a drunk driver. That’s why she kills patients that are going home the next day. She’s jealous of them because she died the day she was supposed to go home and wants them to share her fate. Now that we knew about her past, Holmes was going to try and convince Felicia to stop killing patients and put her soul at peace. We went back to the room where Felcia was at.

Holmes started talking to Felicia. “Felicia! What happened to you was a tragedy. We know about your past. You fought like hell to survive a serious illness. You had your future ahead of you. All of it to just to end with a stupid drunk driver. But these patients have done nothing wrong”.

I then heard moaning and a strong breeze blowing on my face.

“What’s going on?”, I asked.

“She just replied”, Holmes whispered. “Felicia said she doesn’t give a shit. Killing patients that are about to leave the hospital brings her great amusement”.

“What? That’s really fucked up”, I replied.

Holmes tried to convince her again, “Felcia! You know this is wrong. You must---”. She was interrupted by a great scream from Felicia. A massive gust of wind blowing against us, pushing us back. The bed, desks and hospital equipment started levitating. The room window smashed into pieces.

“What now?”, I asked.

“There’s no other choice”, she said solemnly. She took out the urn and opened its top. The ghost of Felicia immediately said “NO!!!”. I could slightly see Felicia’s essence get pulled inside the urn. After her whole essence was inside the urn, Holmes closed the urn. The gust of wind stopped, and all the hospital equipment stopped levitating and fell to the ground.

Holmes sighed, “It’s over. I’ll have to call the cleanup crew to clean up this mess and fix the window. Make sure no one in the hospital sees.”

And so that was the end of that incident. I paid Holmes. And I thought that was the end of it. However, after a week had passed, all I could think about was the incident with the vampire and ghost. I wanted to know more about this world. I decided to go back to the antique store. After class, I took the train to Brooklyn.

I entered the antique store. I could hear Holmes play the violin again. On one of the shelves was the urn with the imprisoned ghost, Felicia.

The sound of the violin stopped. “What do you need, Watson?”, Holmes voice said behind me. I turned around, she was behind a music stand with the violin still in her hand.

“Can’t believe I’m saying this”, I said. “But I want to join your business. Can we be partners?”.

“What for?”, her eyes studying me.

“I want to help people”, I paused. “To be honest. It’s not only that. I find it fascinating. Scary even. It’s like the feeling of going on a roller coaster. A mix of fear, excitement, adrenaline, exhilaration. I never knew I wanted this feeling before. But I do. I want to know more about this world.”

She put her violin in her case and gave me a warm smile. “I was going to ask you to join anyway”, she extended her hand for a handshake. “Welcome to the team”.

As we shook hands, I felt something moving along my leg and purring. I looked down.

“Toby!”, I exclaimed.

“Toby followed me home”, Holmes said. “Guess he’s also joining the team”.

“Synthia!”, Grandpa Hudson yelled running toward her. “You got another case! The clients from Maine!”.

“Maine?”, I said. “You take cases out of State too?”.

“Sometimes”.

“It’s a small town in Maine”, Hudson explained. “Lots of kids disappearing. Signs of mysterious girl dressed in white that comes out at night.”

“Sounds interesting”, I replied. “How will we know if what’s going on in that town is really supernatural?”.

“Elementary, my dear Watson”, Holmes grinned.
