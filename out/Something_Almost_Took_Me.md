I've kept this to myself for years and I need to get it out. Even if I'm just screaming into the void.

I had been camping alone in the Nevada desert. I’d always loved the quiet of the desert. It was the kind of place where you could feel the weight of the world lift off your shoulders, and the night sky stretched endlessly, like an invitation to disappear into the stars. So, when my friends bailed on the camping trip at the last minute, I decided to go alone. I didn’t mind the solitude. I welcomed it.

I parked just off a dusty, unmarked road, far from the nearest town, trekked about a quarter mile across the playa, and as the sun dipped below the horizon, I made a small fire, letting the flames dance and crackle. The heat of the day had finally begun to fade, and the night air was cool and crisp. I sat back, sipping water, watching the stars emerge one by one, scattered across the sky like glittering shards. Everything was peaceful. The sounds of faint distant coyotes yipping provide a source of entertainment.

Then, it came—something that didn’t belong. A faint hum, almost like the earth was vibrating beneath me. At first, I thought it was just the desert playing tricks on my mind. But then it grew stronger, rising until I could feel it in my chest. My pulse quickened and I stood up, looking into the dark, trying to locate the source of the feeling. The night was clear, the stars sharp and unblinking, and the sudden quietness was unsettling. It felt like something was watching me.

That’s when I saw it. Movement. A shadow in the distance, just at the edge of my firelight. Something short with long limbs. Too long. I blinked hard, but the figure didn’t vanish. It was standing there, still as stone, watching me.
I reached for the pistol in the holster at my side, my fingers trembling. I didn’t expect to need it for this, not out here in the middle of nowhere, but this night was different.

It started walking towards me. My heart hammered in my chest as panic flooded through me. I aimed my gun straight at it, hands shaking, and fired 3 shots into its center.

The bullets bounced off its chest like. A. Nerf. Dart.

But before I could move, the being let out a guttural call so loud it was deafening, and the ground beneath me rumbled even harder. It wasn’t a normal rumble. It sent shockwaves up through my legs. My eyes went wide, and I turned to the direction of my car to start sprinting. As I did, a huge orb-like thing apparated right infront of us, dark against the bright starry sky, moving swiftly toward the being. It wasn’t like anything I had ever seen. It was a massive, pitch-black, perfect sphere.

Then it started shining as white as a full moon. I could feel the heat of it as shielded my eyes. And as suddenly as it started, it stopped. It was back to its original black. I realized that the thing pursing me was gone, so I took the opportunity and ran as fast as I could to my car. I don't think I've ever run that fast in my life.

I locked myself in my car and caught my breath, my thoughts racing. What was that thing? Why did it just leave after I shot its species? Where did it go? Wtf? The shock of it all wearing off, I start to cry. Bawling is more like it.

After a few minutes, the car started feeling..off. Like it was a table with one leg too short. Then like it was being lifted onto a tow truck too tall for a small car. Snapping out of my confusion, I finally noticed it was much brighter than it was. I glanced up towards my sunroof and saw the sphere again.

I opened my door only to see I was, what I'm guessing, six feet in the air. I didn't even think, I just leaped out of the door and bust my butt on the landing. I gasped from the wind being knocked out and laid there for a second, after recovering I pulled myself up and darted towards the nearest boulder, hiding behind it. I took the opportunity to shimmy into a large enough divot of the rock and scoop sand over the exposed parts of me.

 I stilled my breath and listened for the hum to come closer, and it did. The sphere hovered over the entire area before leaving as fast as it came.

Later on in the week there was a news report of a missing hiker with his last known location being about 10 miles away from where I was. I think about him a lot these days and wonder if he was their new target.
