I had already seen three of the victims online before I ever spoke to the man and his daughter.
The first was a young mother from Victorville. Her photo on the news looked like it had been taken on some family camping trip, the sun tangled in her hair, her smile slightly off center like she had been laughing when the picture was snapped. The second was a truck driver from Apple Valley, who used to stop by for coffee when he passed through town. I didn’t know him well, but I remembered his voice, raspy, like every word scraped its way out of a dry throat. The third was a retired mechanic from Hesperia, a quiet man I had served pies to a handful of times. He always smelled faintly of oil and hot metal, even after he washed his hands.

The articles were short, bare facts and vague warnings. Black text on white screens, names reduced to ages and locations. But my dreams filled in the rest. Not the way you would expect, no monsters, no faceless killers. Just strange, quiet details that clung to me after I woke.

In one, I was standing in a patch of desert at night, the wind cold and restless, tossing grit into my eyes until they burned. The air tasted like rust and sage. The young mother lay in the dirt, one shoe missing, her sock dark with blood. Her hair was stiff, matted close to her scalp, crackling faintly when the wind touched it. I reached down and felt something hard pressed into her palm. A flower. Dry, fragile, its edges sharp enough to bite my skin. In the morning, when I read her obituary, I told myself my brain had made that up.

Another night, I dreamed of the truck driver’s rig sitting abandoned on a frontage road. The engine ticked softly as it cooled, metal snapping in the silence. I opened the cab door and the smell of old coffee and diesel rolled out. He was there, eyes open but not seeing, his hands resting on the wheel like he had simply paused mid drive. Between his fingers was the same kind of flower, pale, dry, curling inward on itself like it was trying to hide. I shook myself awake, heart racing, sure it was just because I had read too much about him.

For the mechanic, I dreamed of a dark workshop, the air thick with dust and grease. Tools hung on the walls, faintly clinking as if something had just passed through. He was slumped in a chair, head tilted to the side, mouth open slightly. One arm hung loose, fingers stiff. In his palm, again, a desert rose, chalky and brittle. I told myself it was just my mind recycling the same image.

Still, the dreams made me worry for my customers. Folks were scared. You could hear it in the way they spoke, voices low, sentences trailing off. Nobody wanted to throw birthday parties or retirements or even graduations anymore. If people weren’t celebrating, they weren’t ordering cakes.

My bakery in Adelanto, California, was barely holding on. The air inside always smelled like sugar and warm butter, but lately there was an edge to it, something anxious, like the smell of overheated wiring. I dropped my prices, lowest in town. Not because I needed the money, my aunt had left me enough to keep the place alive. But because it felt like something I could do. Maybe if people had a reason to smile, it would keep the fear from settling too deep, from sinking into the walls.

The cops came in sometimes. Their radios crackled softly at their hips while they drank coffee that had gone lukewarm. I gave them free pastries, told them it was just good community service. Really, I wanted to hear whatever scraps of information they would let slip. One afternoon, while they were nursing their coffee, I asked if they were getting any closer to finding him. One of them said something about “those flowers,” then shut his mouth like he had just stepped off a cliff.

I leaned in, resting my palms on the counter, felt the cool laminate under my skin. I asked what flowers.

“Desert roses,” he muttered, eyes fixed on his cup. “Every one of them is found with one in their hand.”

The weird part was, I knew that already. It wasn’t in any article. I had only seen it in dreams. I told myself it was just a lucky guess, that maybe I had read it somewhere and forgotten. But the thought wouldn’t leave me alone. It sat behind my eyes, heavy and insistent.

The nights after that were worse. I would wake in the dark and swear I smelled dust in my sheets, a dry, bitter scent that didn’t belong inside. My mouth felt gritty, like I had been chewing sand. Once I found a few grains of it on my bedroom floor, clinging to my socks when I got up for water. I told myself it was from tracking it in during the day, but I couldn’t remember walking through any that week.

A week later, the man and his daughter came in.
The bell over the door gave its usual tired jingle. She looked about sixteen, shoulders hunched, keeping her gaze low like she was somewhere else entirely. He stood too close to her, filling the space with the smell of sweat and aftershave. He was looking for a cake with a specific kind of frosting I didn’t have. I told him I couldn’t do it in time for the date he wanted. The girl flinched, just a small movement, like she was bracing for a sound that never came. Something in me twisted, tight and sharp. I smiled and told him I could make it happen after all.

That night, my sleep came heavy and deep. No tossing, no teeth in the dark, just a single, vivid dream.

I saw him walking alone on the edge of a dirt service road, the sky the color of cooling ash. The wind smelled like rain hitting dust, sharp and electric. Someone was behind him, close enough that I could hear their breathing, slow and steady. He turned his head, and there was a dull, wet sound, like something heavy dropped into mud. His knees buckled. He fell forward into the dirt, his cheek pressing against the ground, mouth filling with grit. His hand twitched once, twice, then went still. Between his fingers, a brittle desert rose caught the moonlight, its shadow sharp against the earth.

When I woke, I felt good. Rested. Clear headed. My body felt light, like I had finally exhaled after holding my breath too long.

I lay in bed scrolling through my feed until I saw the headline. LATEST VICTIM IDENTIFIED.

It was the father. Same photo I remembered from the shop, his arm around the daughter, her smile stiff and forced. I stared at the screen until my thumb went numb, and for some reason, I suddenly remembered something from that day in the bakery, something I had pushed aside.
Before I had stepped away to check the frosting, he had muttered at her. Low, but sharp enough to cut. “You’re wasting my money. Could have just bought a damn boxed cake mix and had your mother make it.”

Her eyes had stayed fixed on the floor. She hadn’t blinked.

I don’t know why that memory came back then, but it settled into my chest like a stone, cold and heavy.

I pulled out my order book, found his number, and called. No answer. Just his voicemail greeting, cheerful and oblivious. I told him the cake was ready for pick up.

When I hung up, I opened the industrial fridge to start on the morning prep. Cold air rushed out, raising goosebumps on my arms. The top shelf caught my eye. Two of my aunt’s dried desert roses sat in their glass jar, petals curled like little fists, pale against the glass.

Only two.

I stared at the empty space where the others had been and asked the room, “Where the hell did the rest go?”
