I’m a 35-year-old male beef and dairy farmer. I raise cows and sell them to producers. Contrary to popular belief, I spend most of my time working the fields and taking care of the farm instead of the animals because the farm provides food for them.

Oddly enough, I can’t stand to eat beef. Even just seeing it makes my skin crawl. I know it sounds strange, but let me explain.

I had hired some contractors to expand into the forest, and I thought it was going to be all fine. But one day, my tractor broke down in the middle of a long stretch of road. It was around dusk, so I wanted to get moving as quickly as possible before the animals woke. So there I was, looking through the tractor’s engine to see what had gone wrong. Turns out the serpentine belt had broken. Damn. I don’t have a replacement for me. I sigh and try pulling out my phone. While twiddling with the buttons, I felt a weight on my shoulder.

“Hello there partner, I think this might be helpful” The voice was low and grainy like someone who had just woken up.

I turn around to see a flat-faced man holding a slip belt perfect for the tractor.

I accept his aid and take a better look at him. However, the sun shining behind him blinds me. Silhouetted like a shade blending into the darkened treelines.

“Word of advice. Friend. You should give up your intrusion into the forest-” he begins to push past me and walk past my tractor, just outside of my view. I’m able to catch a glimpse of what he’s wearing. A long dark shawl decorated with what looks to be a million eyes. “- give up, before you wake the beast.”

“Hol up partner. Roll that back a minute. What are you talking about?” I walk around the corner of the tractor to glimpse him. Nothing but still air.

Later that day, I received a call that the contractors had found a small marsh of sticky black tar, filled with a number of animal skeletons.

The farm has always been quiet at night. All the farmhands leave to go home, and it’s just me and the barn. My part of the country doesn’t have many criminals, and most steer clear of cattle farmers because there isn’t much worth stealing.

I jolted awake one night. I could hear the distant sound of my cows in distress. A dozen guttural cries layered on top of each other. It’s hard to express what the sound was; it was an octave lower than what cattle typically sound like.

I shuffled onto my feet and grabbed my shotgun. Usually, I’m not too distressed about these things. Most of the time, it’s just a sickly cow passing or one of the pregnant ones giving birth. However, I never found there to be any cows in such a condition. I was worrying—what if a thief had gotten in, or worse, a bear?

The closer I got to the barn, the more I picked up on the small sounds around me. The sound from the barn grew louder—a small whisper in the distance turned into a roaring cacophony. My head felt like it was going to spill out of my skull, but then I noticed something odd: the dull pitter-patter of hooves on dry ground was missing.

I inched closer to the barn. My legs felt like a pair of stilts a thousand miles tall. My shotgun weighed down in my arms, and I could feel the cold steel of the barrel pressing into my arm as I readied to enter the barn. I adjusted it in my hand, feeling the texture of the barrel. Smooth, finely machined steel ran across its length, interrupted by pure sandpaper. I hadn’t needed to take the weapon out often, so it had grown weak. I could only really shoot it twice; the hinges had rusted over a while ago, and I hadn’t thought to get it maintained.

I swallowed as I pushed into the barn. It felt like a mouse passing through the inside of a snake. I entered the barn quietly. I had left the door open, and a light shaft cast through the barn. The light bounced off the floor, faintly illuminating the forms of the barn from underneath. It was bright enough to make out the space vaguely. I was so caught up in my anxieties that I hadn’t noticed the barn had gone quiet.

“Is anyone there?”

SLAM.

Silence—no more light except for crooked lines of moonlight slithering into the barn, jagged and broken. Dozens of unaware black eyes stared back at me. The cows were fine, some awake, others asleep, all in order.

This can’t be right. Where’s the bear? The thief? There has to be something in here.

I aimed the gun and scanned the barn from corner to corner. Pieces of hay crunched under my weight as I walked through the barn. I scanned each of the pens—cows, bulls, and calves. I felt a jitter in my spine. Usually, one or two would swing their tail or eat a bale of hay, but they sat there ghost-still, posed as if ready for a picture.

A shadow passed through the gaps of light.

“I’m armed, and I will shoot if you don’t give up peacefully!”

Still nothing. I could hear the fluid in my ears sloshing around. The cold air was stagnant. My face stung from the chill, and my nose picked up on something—a bitter smell, almost like rotting meat. I inched closer to the smell.

Scuttling. A thousand hooves on the hardwood.

A shadow shifted through the forms. The guttural screaming of a thousand cows began once more. The cattle were still stiff, almost like they couldn’t hear it. Distorted and low, snorting and growling, it was the war cry of a great army bearing down on me. I inched away, my gun ready. I was prepared to shoot.

A long shadow cut through the splintered light. The silhouette of a great bull cast itself on the wall of the barn.

“LEAVE” a low growl echoed in my skull, sounding like it passed through thin metal. My gut twisted into a knot and the walls felt like they shot out in odd angles. Pitching and rotating with wild abandon, it was like the barn was melting around me.

My fingers twitched. BANG.

The many horned heads turned up at attention. Madness. The cattle were running into the walls, injuring each other in the chaos, however, they were trapped in their pens. My head was about to pop off, and the world was closing in, madness, sheer cacophony, I leaned against the wall and looked forward. 

A form emerged from the Shrieking mass. It was approaching. As it got closer, I flinched instinctively. Two piercing red Eyes were looking back at me. White hot anger. The shotgun weighed 1000 pounds. I shifted its weight gasping as I tried to keep my arms straight. BANG. The barrel was aimed directly at it. Still approaching. CLICK click click. What the oh no. 

My legs toppled. I tried to pull myself up but, they wouldn’t won’t work. I felt a warm wet breath on my face - It was inches away from me. Cud curdled in my throat; the smell of pure sulfur violated my nose. 

And before I could react, I was hurled backward, landing hard in the dirt with a mouthful of grass. Dazed, I looked up to see the barn looming over me from the outside. I had no room to question the voice. Whatever thing could do those things wasn’t human, nor was it an animal. And I wanted no part of it. I sold the farm that same month and moved into the city to work as a gardener. Agriculture skills are surprisingly transferable to gardening.

I don’t miss the farm. But sometimes, when driving through the countryside late at night, I swear I see a pair of red eyes glowing in the distance, watching. Waiting.
