I’m (F) in my 50’s now so grew up predominantly in the 1980s. Living in Sydney, I had mum, dad and my two younger sisters. On the occasions my parents decided to go out, we had family to look after us. By the time I was 12, my parents decided they would trust me to finally babysit my sisters. This story occurred on the very first time I babysat.

My parents had decided to go out for movies and dinner on a Saturday night. They had found a midnight screening of one of their favourite movies from their childhood so knew they wouldn’t be home till 1-2am.

At around 11pm we were still staying up late together lights all off, watching tv when we heard somewhat of a rustling in our front yard. Easily putting it down to wind or a cat I didn’t worry too much. But then about 2 minutes later \*BANG BANG\* on our front door. Way louder than a normal friendly visitor.

The three of us were terrified. We became a bit more collected but still silent and turned the TV off. Even in the 80s there was no way in hell I was going to open the door to anyone especially that late at night and knew it wasn’t our folks.

\*BANG BANG\* another time as the door, I decided to brave it a little, to the front door. Fortunately the door was almost completely wooden with just some thin strips of heavily coloured and frosted glass panels. So no one outside could see in. So we kind of crouched there and barely made out a figure at the door.

Before we knew it the doorknob was rattling, this person was trying to enter the house. Not knowing if they knew we were home and too scared to make it obvious I had to do something. Luckily we had a wooden doorstop, I quickly grabbed it and tried to quietly jam it under the door so that it hopefully couldn’t be opened.

Our only phone was right at the front door as well so was too scared to use it if they heard. So I ushered my sisters upstairs to my parents room, where we just huddled. I knew we could see the front stoop from our parent’s window but it didn’t have blinds just heavy curtains. But I couldn’t resist not looking! My sisters of course feeling the same, we ended up slowly putting our heads under the curtains so we didn’t have to pull them open and looked out the front.

What happened next has fueled our nightmares for life. We saw this old man, his eyes were dead focused right on us from the second we looked out, like he knew exactly where we were in the house waiting to catch our gaze. He had the most menacing scowling face. We saw he was holding something, a brown paper bag. He held it by the top making it obvious that something was inside and slowly lifted it up to beside his head. He then lifted up his other arm with a finger pointed at the bag and vey slowly moving his forearm back and forth creepily gesturing to whatever was in the bag.

That whole thing lasted all of 5 seconds before we all ducked our heads back down, recoiling in fear. I stood up about a minute later and moved to the very edge of the window praying I may see more without him seeing me through the chink of the side of the curtain. I could just see and… He was gone.

My sisters and I just huddled together scared for ages on the floor of the bedroom. And I don’t remember much else just our parents coming home and us in hysterics telling them. Think my dad made a police report but that was about it. He was never seen by us again.

I have and will forever be desperate to know who that man was, what he wanted with us and WHAT THE HELL WAS IN THAT PAPER BAG!
