Ms. Bigsbee waddled out of the darkness holding a small leather bound book. "It's not much but it was in the scary section of the restricted reading.", she giggled out. "I'm sure it's just some old superstition, or some such nonsense.", she laughed. "Nothing you can't handle, right Sammy?" I nodded with a smirk.

  
I looked for a good corner to crack this sucker open, and before too long I had a good spot. The book was old, like, really old. Might be from when the town was founded, I thought. I gently opened the book, not wanting to damage the thing, and started reading.

  
This was someone's personal journal. Just dates and little thoughts here and there. Kind of boring really, if I'm being honest with you, but at the time I was enthralled. Nothing really stood out until I was almost done flipping through the pages. Three pages before the end of the journal was an entry simply titled, "May God help us all."

  
My brow lifted slightly as I read. "What was it? The hand of the devil? I don't." The writer was pausing a to collect there thoughts. "It reached out from the tree and. She was gone. Jenny was gone. My sweet child. Ripped away from this world by the hand of that demon! What have I done to anger you oh lord?" The rest of the page was just stained with what looked like water damage, so I flipped the page.

  
"No. I refuse to allow this. I will raise an army of the lord to hunt down this unholy creature.", "We will hunt it down and kill that which takes without mercy.", "We will be victorious!", "Lord bless us, who are but humble men, I seek your light in this, my time of darkness. Guide me to it, oh lord, so that I may take an eye for an eye." An eye for an eye makes the hole world blind, I thought, but he was right. He started to ramble on about strength and devotion and well, all kinds of cooky stuff.

  
By the last page, the handwriting was written very poorly, it seemed rushed and angry. "Tonight we hunt in your name oh Lord! I have gathered a few faithful to my flock, so that we may be blessed in numbers!" And that was it, it just ended there. I was pretty shaken by the almost aggressive handwriting. I could tell this man went through the stages of grief, but stopped at anger.

  
On the back cover was written: 'Property of David Park' I blinked and then furrowed my brow. I remember thinking that name was important or something, but I wasn't sure where I had heard it. I let out a slow, sad sigh and closed the book while leaning back in my chair. I got the idea to ask Ms. Bigsbee about the name, so I took the book back over to her desk and laid it down gently.

  
"Does anything come to mind when I say the name, 'David Park'?", I asked. Her eyes immediately lit up, "Oh, the town founder?! Of course I do!" She giggled and pointed out the window. "That's his statue over there!", she stated with a proud voice. I paused for a second, "Oh yeah, I guess I forgot.", "What happened to him?", I puzzled. "Well, his story was kind of cut short you see, he would walk the town grounds with his daughter every evening, and well, the story goes that she ran away or something like that.", "He got a few of the townsfolk to search for her, but none of them ever came back.", "We use it as an old ghost story still to this day!", she giggled. "No one ever found them?" I questioned. "Nope, just gone, total mystery." she puckered her lips and raised her eyebrows, "Why do you ask?".

  
"Oh you know, just learning more about our town." I nervously chuckled. "Well I think that's great! History is important after all, if you don't know it you'll repeat it." she snickered and smiled. I politely smiled and nodded, wished her a good rest of the day and walked my way back home. It couldn't be the same creature, right? That was a super long time ago, but then I realized, things like that don't die unless you make them. Over the past two years I've been trying to put all the puzzle pieces together, but I'm still missing too many pieces.

  
I was running out of ideas and this was the last summer I was ever going to get in this sleepy little town. But then I remembered something. "Hey dad?", "Yeah, kiddo?" he grinned. So like, how come you don't manage that steel mill back in the woods anymore?" His eyes sort of glazed over and he looked back down at his food as the smile melted off his face. "They shut it down, remember? I haven't worked there in forever, I'm surprised you even remember the place." He took a big bite of his meatloaf and smirked with his mouth full, trying to get a chuckle out of everyone at the table. I laughed a little, but the thought persisted. "Yeah, I know, but like, why?"

  
My mother excused herself from the table, and my dad slowly wiped his face with his napkin. He sighed, "There where a lot of problems up there, building wasn't really up to code and all that, lots of accidents, you know.". "Accidents?", I queried. "Well, a lot of people got hurt and stuff, so they just thought it best to close the hole thing down." Looking back, I now realize that's one of the factors that was going into us moving at the end of the summer. My dad couldn't find a high enough paying job, and just resorted to being a manager at the local grocery store. And when we moved it, I found out later that my mom's new job fell through after just a few years of us being there.

  
I guess money was tight and it was time to look for new opportunities. I remember thinking that it was a little odd to shut down a hole, huge factory, instead of just fixing it up, at the time. It made my wheels start turning again. Maybe people where going missing, and my dad didn't want to ruin dinner or something by saying that. I think that's probably what it was.

  
The last week of school was uneventful, like always. Most of the teachers put on video tapes for us to watch, as long as we where being good. During that time, I started to put a plan together about how, we where going to find and document Mr. Hands. I remember thinking, How had the legend of Mr. Hands taking your pets been started? Must have been someone to cry wolf first. Maybe through the years, people and animals would go missing, and someone had genuinely seen the thing, and the legend was born.

  
"Hey, Hank, what do you think about us doing one last hurrah this summer?", I said as I closed my locker next to his. "Are we sneaking out again?", his eyes squinted as a devilish grin crept across his face. From time to time we would sneak out after dark and just do stupid kid stuff, shoot Ron's .22 at some old cans, go fishing after midnight at the old creek, harmless stuff really. The worst thing we ever did was share a single beer that Ron was able to bargain off his old man last summer. Hated it the second I put it up to my lips, but Ron took to it like water.

  
"Hey Sam-man, Yo, Hanky-panky" Ron chimed in as he walked over. "Dude, you gotta give me a better nickname.", Hank retorted. "Okay, okay, It's only been your nickname for like, what a year now? Alright fair enough, I'll work shop and see what I can come up with, these things take time, Hank-a-sauris Rex." Hank chuckled, "Oh no, defiantly not that one either.". Ron was heading home because being older he only had half days this year. "So what are we doing then?", Ron questioned.

  
I gathered my strength and said, "S-so you know how we all became friends, right?", "You guys always stood up for me and stuff, and I was, am, super grateful for it.", I trailed off. "Hey man, spit it out, this is a safe space." Ron moved his arms in a bubble shape around the two of us. "Yeah, was is it, man?", Hank perplexed. I swallowed a sour taste in the back of my throat. "You guys remember Mr. Hands?", I asked. Hank and Ron looked at each other.

  
"Oh man, Uh, yeah, but like, c'mon man, that's kid stuff.", Ron stated. "It's a cool monster, sure, but like, I don't know man, it's been a long time, maybe you where just seeing things and your dog just ran away." Hank said as Ron fixed his greaser hairstyle in my locker mirror. Ron pointed his comb at me and said, "Look man, you know we always got your back, but Hanky-Tank might have a point.", "Dude, also lame." Hank said without even giving the name time to grow on him.

  
"Look I just got like, one last idea, alright? We head out Friday night to the old steel mill, just like, thirty minutes and when we can do chill by the late or something and sing Kumbaya.", I tried to reason. Hank and Ron sighed in unison. "Okay man, like but this is your going away present, you dig?", Ron smirked. "Yeah man, I actually guess the idea of one final test of our metal would be fitting.", Hank said. "What do you mean? It's Just an old abandoned steel mill in the middle of the forest with nothing around it for miles.", I said, pushing out my chest. They both laughed at my display of manly authority. "Okay, Okay. Same meet up spot?", Ron questioned. "Rodger, Rodger.", I said in a robot voice while Hank smiled.

  
"And don't get caught!" I hollered cuffing my mouth walking backwards to my next class. They both nodded in agreement and waved. The plan was in motion, I felt like, If I could just take a picture of this thing and prove it exists, I would finally be able to move on, you know?
