Item #: SCP-XXXX

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-XXXX is to be contained in a secure holding cell at Site-██. Access to SCP-XXXX is strictly limited to Level 4 personnel with explicit clearance. SCP-XXXX is to be monitored at all times by video surveillance, and any unauthorized attempts to access the containment chamber are to be met with lethal force.

Description: SCP-XXXX is a phenomenon that occurs within a series of interconnected rooms and hallways collectively referred to as "The Back Rooms." SCP-XXXX is characterized by its anomalous ability to cause individuals to become lost within its labyrinthine passages, often for indefinite periods of time. The Back Rooms themselves appear to be constructed from an indeterminate substance, and the space is largely devoid of any furnishings or fixtures beyond the walls, floor, and ceiling.

Individuals who become lost within SCP-XXXX are at high risk of encountering a variety of hostile entities, often referred to as "backrooms entities." These entities range in size, appearance, and behavior, but all share the common trait of being aggressive and dangerous towards human beings. Some entities appear to be predatory in nature, while others appear to be hostile towards humans on sight.

Addendum: Incident Report XXXX-1

On ██/██/20██, a team of SCP Foundation operatives was dispatched to escort a small team of SCP scientists through SCP-XXXX en route to the SCP research hub located within the facility. The team consisted of four operatives and two scientists, all of whom had undergone extensive training and preparation for this mission.

The team entered SCP-XXXX via a designated access point, and quickly began making their way through the winding corridors of the Back Rooms. The team had been briefed on the various dangers of SCP-XXXX, and were armed with standard Foundation equipment including firearms, flashlights, and communication devices.

As the team progressed deeper into SCP-XXXX, they began encountering a variety of backrooms entities. The first encounters were with entities that resembled humanoid figures, but with distorted features and limbs that appeared to be elongated or stretched out. These entities were relatively easy to dispatch with conventional weapons, but the team soon found themselves facing more formidable opponents.

Approximately ██ minutes into the mission, the team was attacked by a large, spider-like creature. The entity was approximately 3 meters in length, and possessed numerous appendages that it used to crawl along the walls and ceiling of the Back Rooms. The creature was highly aggressive, and attacked the team with venomous barbs that it launched from its body.

Despite sustaining several injuries, the team was able to successfully neutralize the creature using a combination of firearms and improvised explosives. However, the team's progress through SCP-XXXX was slowed considerably, as they were forced to navigate around various obstacles and hazards.

Over the course of the next several hours, the team encountered a variety of other backrooms entities, including creatures that resembled giant rats, swarms of insect-like creatures, and a humanoid figure that appeared to be made entirely out of shadow. The team sustained multiple injuries and casualties, but was able to push on towards their objective.

As the team approached the entrance to the SCP research hub, they were ambushed by a group of humanoid entities that had been hiding in the shadows. These entities were heavily armed, and opened fire on the team with automatic weapons.

The team was forced to take cover and return fire, and the ensuing firefight lasted for several minutes. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, the team was able to successfully eliminate all of the hostile entities, and secure the entrance to the SCP research hub.

The team successfully delivered the SCP scientists to the research hub, and were commended for their bravery and dedication to the Foundation's mission. However, *redacted* has had long term effects due to exposure of toxic substances inside of SCP-XXXX
