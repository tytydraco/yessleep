Whether this transmission will reach anything or anyone, I do not know. Yet, I must send something—anything—to warn those who may follow. If this reaches even one person, perhaps I will have saved a galaxy… or more.

My name is [REDACTED], and I was the chief physicist aboard the Nova Project. The last remaining crew member. It’s hard to believe now that we ever thought this mission was a good idea. We received a transmission. It was short, simple, chilling. It said: “Help.” Not in code, not in some alien tongue. No, it was in plain, clear English.

The signal came from NGC 1068, also known as Messier 77, a galaxy 45 million light-years from Earth. The message was impossible—unthinkable. But how could we ignore it? The year was 2458 AD, and humanity had long surpassed the limits of light-speed travel, colonizing distant corners of our galaxy. But this… this was something else. The first transmission of its kind. And it demanded an answer.

We gathered the best, the brightest—the crew of 15 included minds from Earth, and a few from the Europa colonies. Our ship,The Nova, was a marvel of engineering, capable of reaching 177 times the speed of light. Time dilation made the journey feel like the blink of an eye for us, but back on Earth? Thousands of years would pass before anyone knew of our fate. Yet, nothing could have prepared us for what we found.

When we arrived at the coordinates, we found a world not empty, but abandoned in the cruelest sense. Cities lay in ruin, their bones picked clean by time. Overgrown forests clawed at the crumbling remnants of once-great structures. It was like stepping into a graveyard of civilization, long dead, yet whispering of things far worse.

Our search was fruitless, every building we entered filled only with ghosts and silence. Until we found it: a skeleton, clutching a journal. The name written inside… Hiriko Nakaseya, the first human to achieve faster-than-light travel. The first to voyage into the deep unknown.

Her journal told us a story that mirrored our own. She, too, had answered a signal—a signal from this very world. It was different, a Morse code transmission that read “Come.” Her crew, part of a classified mission called Project Ginga, had vanished without a trace. Now we were walking in their footsteps.

Our captain ordered us back to the ship immediately, but when we returned to where The Nova had landed… it was gone. Nothing remained but disturbed dust. Panic set in, but there was no time to process it. The ground shook. In the distance, something moved—a creature, if you could even call it that.

I lack the words to fully describe it. It was a towering, hulking thing, some 20 meters tall, its form seemingly stitched from the minerals of this desolate world. Its chest bore a great, hollow cavity, and the way it moved—like a nightmare dragged into reality. We ran. We hid. It didn’t matter.

One by one, it found us.

I survived by chance. I was out on an expedition to find food, but the others... they weren’t so lucky. It hunted them down as if it knew every place they would try to hide. When I returned, they were already gone.

Now, I’m alone, sending this message from an ancient laboratory. There are pods here, filled with eggs—eggs of the creature. It is breeding. 

To whoever receives this, do not come here. Turn back. Flee. If you do not heed my warning, you will meet the same fate as us.

Goodbye.
