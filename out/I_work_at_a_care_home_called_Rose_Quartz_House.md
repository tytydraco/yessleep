I’mLiz, and I’m a carer. Iwork at a care home called Rose Quartz House.I mean I used to work there. I need to write down what happened there to get it out, even though I’m unlikely to be believed. I swear I’m not making this up.

**…..:::……..:::……..:::……..:::…**

I look after – I looked after -- a resident called Kayleigh, in her early 40s. Kayleigh. Like the song, she says. Said.

Kayleigh has – had -- always loved Sausage Plait. Ever since she was young. “Not the food, the man,” she’d say. “Everyone expects me to love the food,” she’d say, “ but I hate it.”

She loved her dog, Lancelot, too. He was a sniffy Border Collie. “Was” being the operative word – Lancelot was dead now and had been for 8 years. EIGHT. YEARS.

She used to love him sniffing her with his wet nose – silly woman, all dogs had wet noses.

As well as her beloved dog and his treasured memory, Kayleigh thought that Sausage Plait, and his backing band, Toad in the Hole, were fantastic. The sound of the motorbike that started off his shows was the “best sound in existence” she’d tell me.

At the time of Sausage Plait’s death he’d been loved by millions -- “and it was only later I realised I fancied him.” she slurred to me.

She loved watching his “boobs” – she meant his pecs -- bounce up and down as he sang to a tiny woman she’d always secretly wished was her, nearly squashing the woman with his sweaty body as he stuck his tongue down her throat.



Kayleigh was having a hard time of it recently, with a bad leg that appeared to be getting a lot worse.

She’d say “It's a good job I’m already in a wheelchair.”

An online friend got her a rubber duck that’s dressed like him – for as she told me, in life he collected them. I found his duck equivalent terrifying.

Another gave her a memory stick with films he’d been in. Another gave her material just like the scarf he always carried.

She loved all of her friends through their shared love of the band. One man who played in yet another tribute called Sausage Sandwich.    

Were these people even real?? They never visited her. I’d never met them, and was unlikely to.

I probably don’t need to tell you Kayleigh and I didn’t get on that well. We fought like cat and dog.

Maybe I just needed a career change. Maybe I was burnt out.

I’d found her sobbing over Sausage Plait.

Later she would tell management she heard me imitating her cries as she howled, “Sausage Plait is gone!” down the home’s corridor.

I didn’t imitate her in a nasty way. All I did was tell a colleague about it so her notes could be updated.

Kayleigh was always trying to get on with the others who lived here, too, but it’s difficult as few spoke and most got upset if they were looked at wrong.

The bus could only take 2 wheelchairs; hers was huge with special supportive seating, and she had family to take her places. Her parents were older but they could still take her out.

Kayleigh loved Sausage Plait’s hit from the late ‘70s. ‘Starvin’ For My Love (I’ll Feed You Now)’.

Her collection bag filled up, as always hearing him. she’d had it for nine years. I wondered why she didn’t empty it more often.

“Sausage Plait, Sausage Plait! That’s all she ever talks about!” said Mitch, who was of the few who could speak. “She bores me to death!” he laughed. Then he started ranting about how the band had had their day decades ago. He was likely right.

Kayleigh was always teased for her love of him, as well as the folk and blues she’d told me her dad liked.

Her purple hair, as short as a boy’s, bent over her newspaper as she squinted through her smudgy glasses. I wondered why she bothered getting an actual newspaper, that she’d only throw away, rather than looking online??



“Kayleigh, where have you been?” called the clinical lead, Joan, despite knowing where she had been –not that she ever needed that concern, she only ever went to 3 places! -- and with no concern at all as to why it had taken so long to get there.

Later I heard her put Sausage Plait’s song on paired with her water speaker. As always it was at full volume. It wasn’t ‘Starvin’…..’ but it was called ‘I’ll Never Leave (I’ll Always Be There)’. Kayleigh thought it was a lot better.

*“Does your heart cry for me??*” he said softly at the end.

*“’Cause I’m still here you see.*

*I’ve fed you with my love, so I’ll never, ever leave.*

*You’ll never ever have to grieve.”*

That lunchtime there was a plate of garlic chicken with chickpea rice.Kayleigh looked at it. Normally she’d have wolfed it down but she didn’t seem to want it, or even to know what it was, let alone what her favourite drink next to it was.

“Kayleigh, you love garlic chicken,” said a carer, Louise. “Why aren’t you eating? Do you want something else? A sandwich? Carbonara?”

No response.

“And you love your black tea, you haven’t touched it??”

Kayleigh looked through her.

“Oh my god,” Louise said, looking at the notes. “Kayleigh….”

….is sat over there reading the paper,” I said. Louise did panic.

“She’s under her fluid target!” said Louise.

The whole lounge seemed to gasp. It was common knowledge that she would drink the sea dry if allowed. Kayleigh loved black tea, water and lime cordial so sour it took the skin off your mouth and turned you inside out.

We tried to stop her, we all tried but we couldn’t as she had capacity; she knew what she was doing. She drank until she had stomach pains, at least once every week she had diarrhoea severe enough that she couldn’t leave the care home, and was at risk of hyponatremia –water intoxication or fluid overload – but she still never stopped.

Louise turned to her. “Are you feeling all right, lovey??”

Lovey. I saw that tears welled in her eyes. I knew she was called Lovey by her parents.



Most here couldn’t eat by themselves but Kayleigh was always fine eating. She’d have said I was rude – I was -- but she already had a well-documented weight issue, just like her hero and would-be lover! It also said that she was on a speeding train to diabetes if she didn’t go on a diet…… fill in the end of this sentence. She probably already had it – hence all the drinks.

**…..:::……..:::……..:::……..:::…**

My God, it was a hard shift that day. It was January 20^(th). Everyone seemed to be kicking off. She’d be extra hard to cope with too; it was the date Sausage Plait passed away.

Someone screamed; someone had fallen over; someone had attacked my colleague; someone had opened their bowels.

Though it mostly wasn’t her, she was always terrified that it was. She sat on a plastic sheet and sometimes a nappy, or as Sausage Plait would’ve said, a diaper –- and even a spot on them would horrify her and mean they’d have to be thrown away.  Kayleigh had stayed in homes worse than Rose Quartz House ever was or could ever be. You’d have to make up new words to describe just how awful they were.Suddenly urine spurted all over the floor and the lounge lights flickered. I smelled voided bowels.

“Kay…...” I said.

I heard a motorbike roar, so loud it was distorted, and a dark shape shuffled in. It was carrying a rotten scarf. Skin as green as Kayleigh’s nail varnish. Skin that was continuously falling off and landing on the floor with a splat.

Clumps of hair constantly falling from its head.

It walked over to the clinical lead, Joan, then me. “Work in store now,” it growled.

Then it walked over to Kayleigh. Her face seemed to light up. Its voice whispered:

*“Does your heart cry for me?*

*“’Cause I’m still here you see.*

*I’ve fed you with my love,*

 *so I’ll never, ever leave.*

*You’ll never have to grieve.”*

Its face stretched into a smile.

Kayleigh sighed and slumped over in her seat, clear fluid pouring from her mouth.

**…..:::……..:::……..:::……..:::…**

Reports of a resident’s heart giving out were all over the papers, police came to the home. Kayleigh would’ve loved the detective that interviewed me – he was Northern and shouted a lot.



“I loved Kayleigh,” I sobbed. “It was hard work caring for her, of course it was, we… we clashed, but that was my job.”

I blew my nose. I couldn’t seem to stop crying. Had Kayleigh just given up, unable to live without new music from her beloved Sausage Plait?

“She seemed fine,” I sobbed. “She was in a wheelchair but she was healthy. How can she just….be gone like that?”



Kayleigh’s family were up in arms. The home held a celebration for her, putting a little purse and a colour-shift lipstick in a spot outside what had been her room.

Rose Quartz House was put in special measures and then closed.
