She's pretty, her face is youthful, innocent. But I don't get to see much of it these days. No matter, I have it memorized, it's cemented in my brain, the color of her eyes, the texture of her complexion. I've been too busy walking behind her, watching her blond hair bounce with each step, watching her hips sway. She's tiny, a fact made more evident the closer I get. I never noticed how small she actually was, not until she walked past me the other day. Maybe she's not small, maybe I'm just tall. I don't know, this is all new to me. It was her perfume that got my attention, Dior, the smell was sweet, feminine. I love that smell. It was familiar and it brought so many memories to mind, memories that no longer belong to me. 

I think she's on to me, she's looked over her shoulder a few times now. No matter, I want her to know that I'm behind her. Her back stiffens, she's hugging her arms, she's trembling. Good. Ecstasy pulsed through my veins. I want her scared, to ferment in her sorrow, to fear what comes next, to be wary of... me. 

My mouth is watering with intent. 

She turned down a side street, maybe trying to lose her tail, but I know where she's going. I know where she lives. A girl like her shouldn't be out here all alone, but I guess she's an 'adult', the ripe old age of nineteen. 

Her pace quickened and I struggled to stay under the cover of the shadows. She's fidgety, like a gazelle that hears the rustling of the underbrush. When her movements become sporadic, I stop, a predator stalking its prey. When her head returns to the pasture, I inch closer.

She makes a left turn, a detour down a busy street, one illuminated by street lights. I do my best to blend in among the crowd. Her shoulders relaxed a bit, she felt safe, but security was momentary. Ahead of her was the obscurity of darkness, where I'd blend in perfectly, my soul camouflaged by the colorless void of the night. The last streetlight brightened the vivid colors of her clothes before the moonlight caused the hues to dim. 

The air was cold, my feverish breaths condensed in front of my face, and the puff of smoke from my lungs turned hazy amber under the shine of the yellow street lamp, that too dimmed as I plunged into the void. It would only be us from here on out. 

She picked up the pace and I struggled to find cover, her shoes slapping the concrete. I did my best not to let her hear mine. 

She veered right, her chest started huffing with anxiety, her composure slowly waning. 

She turned left, her nerves fraying and her feet spending less time on the ground. 

She shifted right, I was no longer cowering behind the safety of parked cars. She was now fully aware of the presence at her back, her arms dropping, swinging at her side. My thudding steps joined hers, a tone-deaf percussionous clatter. 

When she veered left, she was trying hard not to start running, but when my foot slipped off the sidewalk she lost her nerve. She was sprinting, the gazelle was on the move. 

I ran at her, motivated by the thirst I felt in my throat. Her steps were unpracticed, clumsy. She'd never had to run for her life before, and it showed. Mine were determined, unwavering. She tried screaming for help between huffs of air, but the bitch couldn't even do that right. 

"Hel-- hel--" 

'Help' snagged in her chest, getting forced down by the air streaming through her airway. She was a pathetic excuse for a human. If I was her, I'd be a lot better at getting away. 

She turned right, down an alley, one with no outlet. That was about the time she started crying. I couldn't see the tears, but I pictured how they tasted, salty, bitter. 

She walked up to the brick wall, clawing at the masonry. There was nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, and she knew it. She fell to her knees, her sorrow condensed in the air above her head, and I walked closer. The sound of my boots echoed through the corridor, yet she didn't move. Maybe she'd accepted her fate?

Halfway down the alley, I started getting a whiff of that familiar perfume. It was the one I used to wear, once upon a time; In a different life, a different body. 

I towered over the pathetic balled-up mound of flesh worshiping the wall, the yellow in her hair, silky, smooth. I remember how it felt when I brushed my fingers through it, I missed that feeling. Back then I had taken it for granted, now, old, bold, dying, it was all I longed for. I reached down, the golden fibers on her head flowing through my fingers and falling back onto her shoulders. She shivered with my touch. 

I caressed her arms, they were thin, fragile. Her back stiffened, and I smiled. I felt so powerful in that moment, her heart pounding through her skin, the pulsations in my fingers. 

"Please." She begged. 

I didn't listen. She was cunning and manipulative, managing to convince everyone around her, a wolf in sheep's clothes. If only I wasn't the sheep who got robbed. She caressed her arms, just as I would. I would've believed it, if I wasn't the victim. I don't know what the hell this she, no, what 'it' is, but it stole my life from me. I woke up in an old man's body, one nearing its expiration date. While she, it, assumed the role I left behind, sleeping in my bed, living my life. 

My hand drifted to the nape of her neck, I squeezed just hard enough to get her, 'its' attention. 

"Drop the act. I want what you stole from me. I want my life back." 

My voice rasped in my throat and emotion billowed out of her mouth. 

"Please sir, I don't want to die." 

I lifted her off the ground and pinned her face to the wall. 

"I said drop the act." 

It didn't say anything. Staying as still as a corpse. That was until she, it, started laughing. Her tone was cold, demented. 

"I was wondering when you were going to take to those new balls of yours." 

She'd done what I asked, but the sudden shift in her demeanor was uncanny, like hearing a dog talk for the first time. Still, I maintained my hold on her neck, but that was until she turned around to face me. One second I was looking at the back of its head, the next I was staring into its eyes, my eyes. It was like her body had caved in on itself, melting in my grasp and re-stiffening in my palm. It felt disgusting as if I'd briefly held a creamy wad of dog shit. I let her go, her feet meeting the ground. She cocked her head and stepped forward. 

Suddenly, I was the one on the back foot. I was a foot taller than her but I knew that I wasn't the one in control of the situation. Did I corner her here, or was I the one who'd been lured? 

"Want your life back? What if I say no?" 

Her eyes started to go hazy, before turning a solid white. Despite the lack of pupils, it felt like it was staring directly into my soul. 

"What if I like being young and beautiful? What if I think you don't deserve this little life?" 

Suddenly, we were eye to eye. She had grown taller, more menacing.

"What if your friends, your family, love me more? What if I wear this skin better than you ever would?

I was craning my head up now. Now her proportions were off her torso too long, legs stubby. It's neck curled over the top of me. 

The plump youthful skin became shriveled, before flaking off its body entirely, like old paint on a weathered house. 

"You don't deserve to be me, but I deserve to be you." 

The hair fell off its head, and the flesh clung to its bones. 

"I could've let you die. But I gave you a body worthy of you. As rotten on the outside as it is within." 

'Rotten', the smell that left its mouth. It lifted a hand, one with three long bony fingers. 

"You want your life back? Fine, but you might not like your new reality." 

It covered my face with its hand, and I felt my chest cave in on itself, the air was sucked from my lungs, and when the hand left my face, my back was against the wall. I was looking into the face of an old man, his white beard dirty, and worn. His skin, droopy and wrinkly. His eyes, milky and judgmental. Without saying a word the man turned around and walked away, disappearing into the shadows. 

I looked down at my hands, which were now manicured and lacking liverspots. I trailed my fingers across my face, the skin no longer rough and wrinkled. I found a phone in my back pocket and held it out in front of me. I saw the blue eyes in the screen's reflection. I was me again. 

The phone in my hand lit up. 

'New message from Mom: Dinner's almost ready when are you coming home?'

I had a family again. 

I stood on the street for a while, looking into the warm glow through the windows. My mom was washing dishes, the blue light of the TV flickering in the background. Dad was watching his shows, and I was late for dinner. I opened the door, the house smelled of Mom's cooking, the table was set for three, and Mom welcomed me home. 

"Finally, your home. Honey, dinner's ready." 

Dad grunted when he stood up from the couch and ruffled my hair as he walked by. I was still taking in the sight, the normality. I hadn't even noticed I was awkwardly standing in the foyer. 

Dad gestured to the seat across from him, and I took my place. 

It had been so long since I'd felt safe and it felt strange, almost too good to be true. 

Mom pulled the meatloaf from the oven, the pan hovered over the table as the meaty dish steamed into the air. A home-cooked meal, after all this time out on the street, in the cold. I was happy, ecstatic. But it all came crumbling down when I saw Mom's hands. 

Her skin was sizzling against the hot pan, the flesh blistering against the metal. She placed the pan on the table and the flesh of her palm instantly mended. I looked across the table to find Dad studying me with pale white eyes, equally aware of my strange behavior. Mom took her seat and looked in my direction. Her eyes looked just like Dad's. I felt this revolving shutter in my body, like biting aluminum Foyle with dental fillings. I was shivering and sweat built up on my brow. 

There was a person at the window, it was tall, ill-proportioned.

'You may not like your new reality.' 

It looks like I wasn't the only one who was replaced.
