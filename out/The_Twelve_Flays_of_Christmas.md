"Come take a peek, Bethany-Josefina," said, 'The Spyder,' to the fly.

BJ gave the greasy man in the leather trench coat a look that said, "I'm hangry and you're starting to annoy me."

"I'm sorry. Come take a peek, Fly-Girl."

"That's better," she said, her face softening. Using La Reina's coven name was like juggling chainsaws while the 101st airborne opened up on you. Only Spyder could dare and only with three 5ths in him.

For my part I breathed a sigh of relief.

McFly had a very bad temper.

And she didn't cotton well to being called, "McFly" either.

Which was a Catch-22 scenario because, well, McFly was her real name so what the fuck am I supposed to do about it? Anyways, I been McFly's *Dude Friday* since the pandemic when I was on my ass trying to find ramen money between the seat cushions of my 2003 Prelude.

Now I drive a Rolls, or a Bentley, or sometimes even a Lambo, yo. But alas, I don't own them. I serve at La Reina McFly's whims and caprice.

"Peasant. Do you want to eat this delicioso, filet? Oui?"

The Spyder, if he's sober enough to comprehend the banter usually just smirks into his Stoli. Even after Spyder went big time, and gave up his big fat momma to the greasy Sandanistas and brujas, well, as Spyder was fond of saying, "Fuck it, pendejo."

So now here we are in the holiday season and business ain't immune from the world at large. Satanic worship is down. Sacrifices are down. Spyder and McFly keep eyeballing each other's throats like inquisitors half-a-millennia removed.

***14 Days Ago***

"Espiritus Satanis!"

That meant front and center in hangry fly-speak.

"Si, *La Reina*?"

Fly looked down her aquiline nose at me. Her eyes seemed to focus on me then immediately regret the decision.

"Why are you so corrupt, Henry? Just last week, did I not see you eating Papa John's?! Again!"

I felt a cold pass over me. My teeth made a CLAK sound.

"Um. Well, I had a coupo-"

"COUPON!?!?!?!?!!?!" La Reina bellowed.

Suddenly, as if time and space were unworthy of her consideration La Reina was en mi cara y furioso.

"Worm! Slime! Pig! Filth! Toad! Cur! What did we say about this American piss they call Italian, '***food***'?"

Fuck! I forgot! La Reina was not only Latina but she had snatched her first soul right under Constantin's probiscus. It was the secret.

"In milennia, never has it been such a chagrin to witness demon fodder stutter for my amusement."

Then the fingers gripped my throat. Nails like talons. But talons dipped in battery acid.

I whimpered.

"Are you going to piss yourself? Again? You disgust me! Insect!"

And then, as if a hurricane had been hiding in her hand I was making the acquaintance of the gothic library's far wall at a respectable clip. When I was done hurdling through mid-air, I collided with a book of spells from the mid-17th century, simply entitled, "Norm's Necrotic Necromancing and other spells to satisfy Satan."

I shook the birds away under a pile of dusty books.

From across the room McFly yelled, "I am the Queen. Fuck 2025! It has not even begun and I am horrified and dyspeptic! And I have this piss boy to annoy me. Piss boy? Stooge? Gopher? Errand boy?

I ask him to perform one Satanic Ritual to ensure a ghastly Christmas for parts of the third world I am responsible for as well as the South Bronx, and yet, after all my endless charity and forgiveness, this dyslexic fuck, fucks up my spell and now, I can't say it!"

Spyder got off the barstool. He tilted his head sharply from left to right and it made a sound like 2x4's snapping in the hands of a cuckolded silverback gorilla.

"Now why ya gotta blame it on, Henry?"

I got a book called, "*Trial by Barbecue by Roberto Flay, IV: Mayhem from Milan to Minsk*" off my head and tossed it on top of the pile I had squirmed out of.

And then she was back next to me. Again. Same gnarled hands. Same breath that smelled like pasta de putanesca with extra anchovy.

La Reina smothered a belch.

"Aye cono! Pinche anchovies!"

Her breath smelled it plus something darker than any dental decay a dentist could discover. It was the all too human stench of corruption.

"I want more. We serve at his unholy master of all master's pleasure. Our master is easily chagrined as I am. I feel the need for deceit and misery. Get the high priests. Get the-"

"They all quit-"

"WHAT?!?!?!?!!?" La Reina bellowed at Spyder.

It blew his handlebar moustache back and he snuffed the air like Kerberos.

"Anchovy fer sure, McFly."

"You are a cur, too" La Reina bellowed. "Why must I be surrounded by dogs?"

And then I was tossed across the library. Again. This time I heard something in my back make a sound I can't say I liked.

"We will serve our Dark Overlord global misery and suffering. I have alerted the Bureau of Sad State Affairs we were on target to deliver the souls of the damned like nobody's ever seen. Numbers like no demons alive or undead and damned to hell have ever seen. Numbers so satanically severe mere numbers cannot represent the reprehensible heinousness except to await the anchovy to pass through the cave of evil. Ave anus Satanus."

Spyder looked at me.

"Henry. You're a good kid. So, I hate to do this to ya at the holiday season and all."

Spyder patted himself down.  Then he took inventory. Medieval weapons, gold coins, each item he removed from his cloak seemed to perturb Spyder further.

"Arrrrgh."

"Idiot!" La Reina snuffed in Spyder's direction. "Suffer!"

Spyder stepped back and put up his hands like he was giving Iron Horse signals.

The eyebrows went up.

"You challenge me?"

"Safe passage."

"Why?"

"Christmas in Hell."

There was a pause. Finally, La Reina looked at me.

"Fine. I have pig boy to amuse me. Safe passage."

Spyder tilted his gnarly mane. Then he shot me a weak smile that said, "Hate to leave you in the lurch, but better you than me, son."

And then, Spyder was gone. And *fourteen* more days to Christmas.

Not enough suffering for La Reina. Not enough for Satan.

What did I have? Steady gig? Was I lucky to be employed? Was I lucky to awake every morning with battery acid sloshing around in my guts? Being beckoned any hour of the day or night, seven days a week, three hundred and sixty-five fucking days a year. Henry go fer this. Henry go fer that. Henry go decapitate the evil spirit that has possessed your cat!

Yeah, she tried to get me to decapitate my cat once. But fortunately, it too was a Gatita Bruhita and was able to abscond out the open window out into the Mexico City night. But, to gatita's credit she left La Reina a little going-away present. It was a surprise though. One La Reina did not discover until she sat in her favorite Louis IV chair only to discover it was a spongeful of magic cat piss.

After Gatita's abrupt departure, any pretense of decent working conditions flew out the window. Not to mention the Santeria. The voodoo. The sacrifices. All the trips to the jungles of southeast Asia and Papua New Guinea.

So, that was years ago. Now, now, I don't know what's going on. I am only the peon. But I have never seen the Queen like this. So, angry. So damn hell-bent on destruction.

Anyway, that's when it hit me how I could survive.

I was watching old reruns on the Food Network and it hit me. Like a diamond bullet. A diamond bullet in the forehead. That these demons. These American werewolves displeasing the full moon and upper management. I had to give more.

Ask not what your cruel Satanic Mistress can do for you, but ask what you can do for your evil fucking soul sucking demoness succubus that left you to do your crying in the red rain.

That realization. That if I had the right ingredients. The right anchovy paste. The right chili peppers. The red hot ones. That somehow I, I could resist the evil. Lead us not into temptation. Lead us not off the path of the righteous.

McFly wants FRIES, filthy pig of dwarf's scrotum!

And then, it was the night before Christmas, and all through the mansion on the hill, the moans of the damned were moaning a song of surrender.

"This? This is what you serve for the son of our GREATEST enemy's birthday? Steak? We always eat from the sea of hatred and intolerance? Shark meat! How many times must I remind you peasant!?!?! Pig!"

And then came the moment of truth. In every man's life, whether pauper or prince, comes the moment when you either establish your boundaries or resolve to forever be the demon's pin cushion.

"You fucking wench! I gave everything! Everything to you this Christmas! You think last Christmas I gave you my heart! Well, you don't even appreciate the trouble I went to this year. Just to make your Helltide Season fucking ghastly with ruin and despair.

And this, this," I said, using what was left of my right arm to make a grand, sweeping gesture. "'This,' is the fucking thanks I get!

Ya like them falafels didn't ya? Ya liked the pudding? Burgers? Fries? Salads and smoothies?

Well, you want everything, so I gave it to you and you, what did you do, your HIGHNESS???

*You.*

*Licked.*

*The.*

*Plate.*

And in a restaurant too?!?!?! Who the fuck licks the plate? Only a narcissistic, negative attention seeking demoness, that's who!

And then La Reina glared with all the heat of a thousand bottles of red hot chili sauce coming out one's southern border.

"PIG! I WILL FLAY YOU!"

"NO!"

I looked around then let my garb slide down my hollow man shell. It gathered around my ankles and for once in her endless hellspan of a life La Reina McFly was speechless.

"That's right baby! Henry, pig boy, beat ya to it! I made a deal with the mother ship union. And you, you can digest most of my liver, gall bladder, right buttock, left tricep and right bicep as well as molars 23 through 27 and one very giant sebaceous cyst I had been nursing since the 1960s. That was the tahini sauce you couldn't get enough of you, you...; what do we call greedy and corrupt power-mad demons?

**PIG**

And then, then the unexpected happened. La Reina turned her nose up at me and said, "Oh." Then she walked unceremoniously out the door. That was two days ago. Now I gotta go back to my regenerative frog boy spells. I don't just flay myself half-cocked. Them frogs know what time it is. The knowledge is out there. You just gotta let it in.

Happy Holidays from Hellscape Vermont
