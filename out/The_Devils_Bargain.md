I don’t know if anyone will believe me. Hell, I’m not even sure I believe myself anymore. But I need to tell someone—anyone—before I lose what’s left of my sanity. Maybe someone out there has gone through the same thing. Maybe you’ll think I’m crazy. Either way, I don’t care. If you’re reading this, please… just listen.

It started about a month ago. At first, I thought it was just nightmares—horrible, vivid nightmares—but now I know better. Every time I fall asleep, I leave my body. I don’t mean in a dreamlike sense; I mean I *leave*. My soul—or whatever part of me isn’t tied down to flesh—gets yanked out and dropped into a place that no human being should ever see.

I’ve been to Hell. And every night, I go back.

The first time it happened, I thought it was a lucid dream gone wrong. You know the kind where you realize you’re dreaming but can’t wake yourself up? It started with this awful sensation of falling—like my stomach was being ripped out through my spine—and then suddenly, I was there.

Hell isn’t fire and brimstone the way people like to imagine it. It’s worse. So much worse.

I landed in the middle of a barren wasteland that stretched endlessly in every direction under a sky that wasn’t a sky at all. It was red—not just red like blood but deeper, darker, like the color of an open wound that never heals. The light didn’t come from a sun or stars; it just… existed, casting long shadows that moved even when nothing else did.

The ground beneath me wasn’t solid. At first glance, it looked like cracked black rock, but when I stepped on it, it shifted and squirmed under my feet like something alive. It was sticky and wet, and when I crouched down to touch it (I don’t know why—I guess curiosity got the better of me), it burned my fingers like acid and left behind this awful stench that clung to me for hours after I woke up.

And the sounds… God, the sounds were the worst part. Screams echoed from everywhere and nowhere at once—high-pitched wails of agony mixed with low, guttural moans that made my skin crawl. Sometimes there were whispers, too—soft voices murmuring things just out of earshot, like they were trying to lure me closer.

I wandered for what felt like hours that first night, trying to find something—anything—that made sense. But Hell doesn’t make sense. It’s chaos given form.

It didn’t take long before I realized I wasn’t alone in that place.

At first, I thought the shadows were playing tricks on me. Shapes moved at the edges of my vision—quick flashes of something crawling or slithering just out of sight—but when I turned to look, there was nothing there.

Then they started getting closer.

The first one I saw clearly was humanoid… sort of. It had arms and legs like a person but bent at unnatural angles as if its bones had been broken and reset over and over again in all the wrong places. Its skin was gray and mottled with patches of raw flesh that oozed black liquid onto the ground as it moved. Its face—or what was left of it—was featureless except for a gaping hole where its mouth should have been.

It didn’t walk; it staggered toward me on limbs that twitched and jerked like a marionette being controlled by an unskilled puppeteer. And when it opened its mouth to scream… oh God, that sound will haunt me forever. It wasn’t human—it wasn’t even animal—it was pure pain given voice.

I ran. I didn’t think; I just ran as fast as my legs could carry me across that shifting, living ground while more of those things crawled out from the shadows around me.

One of them grabbed my ankle at one point—a hand with too many fingers digging into my skin with claws sharp enough to draw blood—and when I kicked it off, its face split open into dozens of tiny mouths filled with needle-like teeth that snapped at me as it fell back into the darkness.

By the time I woke up screaming in my bed, drenched in sweat and gasping for air, my legs felt like they’d actually been running for miles.

It wasn’t until about a week later that *he* showed up.

I’d been falling asleep less and less by then—too terrified of what would happen if I went back—but eventually exhaustion won out. That night started like all the others: falling into Hell’s endless wasteland with its burning air and shifting ground and screams echoing through the crimson sky.

But this time… this time he was waiting for me.

He stood in the distance at first—a figure dressed in black against the blood-red horizon—but as he walked closer, everything around him seemed to change. The ground stopped writhing beneath his feet; even the screams faded into silence as if Hell itself was holding its breath in his presence.

He didn’t look how you’d expect Lucifer to look—not red-skinned or horned or monstrous in any way. No, he looked human… almost too human. His face was flawless but unsettlingly symmetrical, like someone had carved him out of marble rather than flesh and bone. His suit was immaculate—blacker than anything should be—and his eyes…

His eyes were empty pits of darkness that seemed to swallow everything they looked at.

“Welcome,” he said with a voice as smooth as silk but layered with something deeper—something ancient and cold and utterly devoid of mercy. “You’ve been wandering long enough.”

I couldn’t speak; my throat felt dry and raw from breathing in Hell’s sulfurous air—or maybe from screaming so much during my previous visits—but he didn’t seem to care about my silence.

“You’re not supposed to be here yet,” he continued casually as if we were old friends catching up after years apart. “But since you are… perhaps we can help each other.”

That’s when he made his offer: protection from the creatures that hunted me every night in exchange for small favors when I woke up back in the real world.

“What kind of favors?” I managed to choke out eventually.

“Oh, nothing too difficult,” he said with an almost playful smile that didn’t reach those empty eyes. “A note left here… an object delivered there… tiny little things that won’t cost you much at all.”

I wanted to say no—I *should* have said no—but then one of those creatures appeared behind him: taller than any human should be with limbs too long for its body and a face split open into rows upon rows of jagged teeth dripping black ichor onto its chest.

Lucifer snapped his fingers lazily without even looking back at it, and the thing disintegrated into ash before my eyes.

“Think about it,” he said simply before turning and walking away into the crimson haze as if nothing had happened.

The address led me to a part of town I’d never been to before. It was one of those forgotten places—empty streets lined with boarded-up windows and crumbling brick buildings. The kind of place where the air feels heavier, like it’s weighed down by years of neglect and misery.

The building itself was an old bookstore, or at least it had been once. The sign above the door was so faded I could barely make out the words, and the windows were caked with grime so thick it looked like they hadn’t been cleaned in decades. But when I pushed open the door, the bell above it chimed like it was brand new.

Inside, everything was still. Dust hung in the air, catching the weak light that filtered through cracks in the boarded-up windows. Shelves lined the walls, their contents long since decayed into unrecognizable piles of paper and mold. But on the counter at the center of the room, there was a single book.

It didn’t belong there. It was pristine—its leather cover smooth and unblemished, its gold lettering shining as if it had just been polished. The title wasn’t in English—or any language I recognized—but as soon as I saw it, I felt something… *wrong*. Like a cold hand had reached inside my chest and squeezed my heart.

I don’t know how long I stood there staring at it before I finally worked up the nerve to pick it up. The moment my fingers touched the cover, a sharp pain shot through my hand and up my arm, like I’d grabbed a live wire. I almost dropped it, but something—curiosity? fear?—made me hold on.

The note Lucifer had left me wasn’t specific about what to do with the book; it only said to leave it on a park bench near the riverfront. So that’s what I did.

I tried not to think about how wrong it felt as I walked away from that bench, leaving the book behind for whoever—or whatever—was meant to find it. But deep down, I knew this wasn’t just some harmless errand.

That night, when I fell asleep again, Lucifer was waiting for me.

This time, Hell felt different.

The air was hotter—thicker—as if the place itself was reacting to what I’d done. The ground beneath my feet writhed more violently than before, and when I looked down, I saw faces pressing up from beneath its surface. They weren’t fully formed—just vague impressions of mouths screaming silently and hands clawing at nothing—but they were everywhere.

Lucifer stood in the distance, his silhouette sharp against the blood-red horizon. As I approached him, the screams around us grew louder, blending into a deafening cacophony that made my ears ring. But when he spoke, his voice cut through it all like a knife through flesh.

“Well done,” he said with a slow clap that echoed unnaturally through the wasteland around us. “See? That wasn’t so hard.”

“What… what was that book?” I asked hesitantly.

He smiled—a cold, empty thing that sent shivers down my spine despite the heat of the air around us. “Oh, just a little something to help set things in motion.”

“Set *what* in motion?” My voice cracked as panic crept into my throat.

Lucifer tilted his head slightly, studying me like a scientist might study an insect pinned to a board. “You’ll see soon enough.”

Before I could press him further, something moved in the shadows behind him—a creature unlike any I’d seen before. It was massive, its body twisted and contorted into shapes that defied logic or anatomy. Its skin was translucent, revealing muscles and veins beneath that pulsed with sickly green light. Its head was nothing but a gaping maw filled with rows upon rows of jagged teeth that clicked together rhythmically as if in anticipation.

The thing lunged toward me faster than anything that size should have been able to move—but Lucifer raised a hand lazily, and it stopped mid-air as if hitting an invisible wall.

“Not yet,” he said softly before snapping his fingers.

The creature let out an ear-splitting screech before dissolving into ash like all the others.

“Consider this your warning,” Lucifer continued, turning back to me with that same unnerving smile. “Fail me again… and next time, they won’t stop.”

Two days later, I saw a news report about a man who drowned himself in the riverfront park—the same park where I’d left that book. Witnesses said he’d been sitting on a bench talking to himself for hours before suddenly standing up and walking straight into the water without hesitation.

I knew it wasn’t a coincidence. Somehow, that book had done something to him—something *I* had set in motion by delivering it.

And now Lucifer wants more favors.

Every night when I fall asleep, he’s there waiting for me with another task—a package to deliver here, an object to hide there—and every time I wake up feeling less like myself.

I’ve tried staying awake—tried drinking coffee until my hands shake or forcing myself to keep my eyes open until they burn—but eventually exhaustion wins out. And every time I close my eyes…

I go back.

Hell is getting worse each time too. The creatures are bolder now—hungrier—and Lucifer seems more amused by my suffering than ever before. He says he’s preparing me for something bigger but won’t tell me what that is.

I’m scared of what will happen if I keep doing what he asks… but even more terrified of what will happen if I refuse.

Please… if anyone out there knows how to stop this—how to break free—tell me before it’s too late.
