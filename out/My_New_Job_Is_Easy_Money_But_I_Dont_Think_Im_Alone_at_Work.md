When I saw the ad, I couldn’t believe it.

$500 a night to watch an empty office building.

It sounded perfect for someone like me—struggling to pay rent and not great at staying awake during the day. I applied immediately. The company, NightWatch Solutions, didn’t even ask for an interview. They emailed me within hours, asking if I could start that night.

Of course, I said yes.

The email was brief but clear:
	1.	Arrive at the office by 9 pm.
	2.	Lock the front door after you enter.
	3.	Stay in the security room unless absolutely necessary.
	4.	Don’t check the fourth floor under any circumstances.
	5.	Leave at 6 am.

Sounded simple enough.

When I arrived, the building looked ordinary. A plain, three-story office complex surrounded by an empty parking lot. Inside, the air felt colder than it should have, and the lights flickered slightly.

The security room was small but cozy—complete with monitors, a coffee maker, and a comfortable chair. I settled in, watching the live camera feeds of each floor. The first few hours were uneventful. Occasionally, I saw a cleaning crew on the second floor, but otherwise, the place was empty.

Around midnight, I heard it.

BANG.

The sound came from somewhere above me.

Remembering the rules, I checked the monitors but avoided the fourth-floor cameras. Nothing seemed out of place. The cleaning crew was gone, and the building was silent again.

BANG.

This time, it was louder, echoing through the vents. My curiosity got the better of me, and I flipped to the fourth-floor feed.

At first, the screen showed an empty hallway. Then, a shadow moved across the corner of the frame.

I froze.

The email had been clear—don’t check the fourth floor. But someone—or something—was up there.

I leaned closer, trying to see if the figure would reappear. Instead, the screen went black.

The other monitors followed.

Panicking, I grabbed the walkie-talkie left in the room. I wasn’t sure who I was supposed to call, but before I could press the button, static crackled from the device.

A voice, distorted and low, whispered: “Come upstairs.”

I slammed the walkie-talkie onto the desk and stared at the dark monitors. My phone buzzed in my pocket, making me jump.

The message was from a blocked number.

“You shouldn’t have looked.”

Shaking, I glanced toward the security room door, which was slightly ajar. I hadn’t left it like that.

The building was silent again, but something felt wrong. The cold air was heavier now, pressing against my skin.

Another message buzzed on my phone. This one included a photo of me in the security room, taken from just outside the door.

The message read: “You still have time to leave.”

I didn’t need to be told twice. I grabbed my bag, sprinted to the front door, and unlocked it as fast as I could.

As I stepped into the parking lot, I turned back toward the building.

On the fourth floor, a single window was lit. A figure stood there, watching me.

This story can continue with the protagonist being pulled deeper into the mystery of the building, possibly getting lured back by an even more lucrative offer or facing consequences for breaking the rules. Let me know if you’d like more!
