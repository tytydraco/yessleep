I haven't shared this storyI haven't shared this story with many people. I, 23 F, worked at a Gas station for just over three years some time ago. At the time of this story I would have been no older than 18. 

I lived in a heavily suburban area in the deep south that wasn't witness to anything too insane, so many businesses didn't take many safety precautions beyond what our training instructed us on; ie don't fight a robber, give them what they want, etc etc. My manager, Sophia, never scheduled women for over night shifts, it was always our male staff, however I had offered one night to stay later for the extra bit of money and seeing as I lived a 5 minute walk away, didnt see the harm in staying later. 

One thing I feel I need to mention is that it gets incredibly dark in the south at night and the sun sets quick. My area also had little to no street lights. 

So, my shift started as normal; I manned the register, swept, restocked what I could, and kept things tidy for the most part, but a girl can only mop so many times before there's nothing left to do, so I spent a lot of my time at the register waiting for customers and screwing off on my phone to pass the time when a customer comes in. I call out my standard greeting as I look up to find a tall, disheveled man standing at my register. Obviously I immediately disregard my phone to help him out, but I notice hes acting... odd. At the time I had chalked it up to my imagination, but my gut told me otherwise. 

He asks where the restroom was and i point him in the direction. Now, to get to the bathroom you have to walk past the registers and into a small hall where our office and stock room also was. He goes and I continue on as normal, completely forgetting about him. 

A regular of mine walks in, a taller man who had served in the marines for 22 years, and we get to talking when I hear something fall over in the back, like a broom or mop or something. My regular asks me if im working alone and if I want him to take a look around. I decline the offer as I didnt want to get in trouble with my boss for letting a customer into employee only areas. 

He stays his goodbyes and let's me know that he'll be back by later for lotto tickets. 

Some more time passes and I have to pee after drinking endless power aid from the soda machine. I go to make my way back and before I could rech the bathroom I glance to the office and notice the door is way more open than id left it. I dont know what compelled me to push the door in with my foot, but that's what I did. I kicked the door so itd swing open and trigger the motion sensor light. 

The light comes on and I dont see anything until I spot the odd bathroom guy stood stock still behind the door. We made eye contact as I immediately backed up and out of the hall. The man emerges from the office only seconds later and just casually strolls out, keeping his eyes in me the entire way out until I couldn't see him anymore. I called my boss immediately to tell her and she called the police. 

Apparently, that man had been banned from every single other store in the area for the same thing, but never faced charges as he hadn't "committed a crime" yet. He continued to show up everyday at random hours to just stare at me over the aisles without ever buying anything... 

Im not sure what his intentions were or why he hid, but something about the way he stood so still long enough for the motion light to turn off doesn't sit well with me....
