The Voice has lived with me my entire life. As far as I can remember it has been a part of me since birth. Only my mother and the doctors know about it. It has tormented me my entire life and has been the source of my constant migraines. I hate it and no medicine has ever helped my condition, in fact, it just makes it worse.

As a child, my mother did everything to hide it from my classmates so I wouldn’t be bullied for it. I was the quiet kid, no one spoke to me and I spoke to no one. I’ve always been a loner, The Voice says we don’t need anyone but each other. It speaks in a deep soothing voice that would calm me if it wasn’t so malicious.

“Feed me.” The Voice would say constantly. It can taste but it can’t feel, its only form of worldly contact is through food. Its favorite is meat, red meat to be exact. It would beg for food at all times of the day, like a prisoner of my mind begging to be free from its eternal chamber of nothingness.

When it wasn’t hungry it would torment me endlessly.

“You are weak, useless. This body you’ve been blessed with, and you’ve accomplished nothing with it. You are a waste of a life.”

It would say things like that all the time. I’ve tried to not let it get to me but to be honest, it does. I’ve cried myself to sleep many nights, believing The Voice's vile words it would say.

“If our mother would have blessed me instead I would do so much more than fucking waste away like you.” The Voice spewed

“Stop it”. I muttered through sobs “Please just leave me alone.”

“Like it or not we’re stuck with each other, we need each other, we can’t live apart brother.”

“Don’t you fucking call me that you parasite.” "My head began to pulsate painfully

“You can’t deny what we are brother, it’s in our blood.”

It isn’t my brother it’s a monster, a horrible apparition made to serve its sole purpose of making my life hell. This demon hitched a ride using me as a vessel to come into this world.

The headaches become worse the hungrier it gets. It tortures me to get what it wants, I can feel a numb, stinging pressure on my brain whenever it wants to hurt me. I just want it to stop, to leave me alone, to get the hell out of my life.

"I'm not going anywhere brother, feed me."

"Go to hell." I said knowing what came next.

"Feed me brother."

"NO!" I yelled

"FEED ME FEED ME FEED MEEEEEE!!!" The Voice screamed

My head instantly felt like it was going to burst, I exclaimed in pain and the voice continued screaming.

"FEED MEEEEE BROTHER!!! FEED FEED FEEEED!"

"FUCK! OK OK, I'll feed you." I said defeated, just wanting the pain to end.

I went to the refrigerator massaging my temples, and found some ground beef. I went to open it but The Voice yelled "NO!" startling me a little

"What do you want?" I whimpered

"Not that, I'm sick of cold meat, I want something fresh."

This was new, it wasn't the first time it had complained about what food I fed it but, it didn't want meat. Meat was the only thing I fed it that made the headaches go away completely.

"Go find me fresh meat brother. FRESH MEAT!"

The Voice knew I hated it when it yelled at me, every time it yelled my head rattled and quaked in agony. My pain is its leash on me, it hurts me to get what it wants. A tear rolled down my face, feeling absolutely agonized.

"I'll get you whatever you want, just please stop yelling." I sobbed

"Whatever I want? Brother, you spoil me."

It wasn't hard finding an alley cat this late at night. Using the ground beef to lure it over to me, I picked it up carefully and the cat purred in my arms. Tears were still rolling down my face, I didn't know if I could do it.

"I'm sorry little kitty, I'm so sorry, please forgive me." I said through choked-up tears. The cat looked at me trusting that since I fed it, I wouldn't hurt it.

"do it." The Voice whispered to me.

The cat's head didn't cave in how I wished it did when I swung it down against the pavement by its hind legs. I can still hear its final yowl as it was in motion. It sort of seized up and went stiff but it wasn't dead, it was in pain. Oh god, I'm so sorry little one. I swung it against the pavement again, its skull cracked, blood and pink brain matter spilling out this time, I knew it was dead then. I wished I were dead then, I vomited and fell to the ground bawling my eyes out.

What had I done? What was I capable of doing? The Voice just laughed as I stared at the dead cat in the alley, knowing it now had full control over me to do whatever it wanted.

"Now brother, feed me." The Voice said calmly

The bones cracking reverberated in my head as they were chewed up. Blood ran down my neck and I just sat there and sobbed. Chewing and devouring the dead cat right there in the alley, my headache was gone. I was free of pain, but for how long? This cat paid for my relief but, it wasn't really a relieving feeling it was absolute dread.

Every night I would go out and do this at the behest of The Voice. finding cats, birds, whatever animals I could find whenever the voice would hurt me. I hated hurting these innocent animals, I really did but the pain was unbearable. It felt like a thousand knives being plunged into my skull over and over again. It only went away now with fresh animal meat, I wish I had talked the voice into just eating the ground beef like it had been for years. I, however, made hunting and killing these poor creatures the norm and The Voice expected it now. Until one night, it didn't want it.

I had just finished snapping the bird's neck when The Voice said "No more brother, these animals can't fulfill me anymore."

I tearfully said, "No, please just eat the bird."

"I DON'T WANT IT!" The Voice's scream echoing through the alley

I whimpered "PLEASE! God just eat the bird. please." I sobbed,

Suddenly an all too familiar pain shot through my skull like a bullet. I screamed in agony, certainly waking the neighbors but I didn't care. I was at the mercy of The Voice and it knew that. I was scared, I would do anything to make this stop, to make the pain end. Anything.

"You're life is going to be a living hell until I get what I want." The Voice snarled

I didn't sleep that night, the pain was so unbearable I could hardly even make it back to my apartment. I fell over in the kitchen and writhed in pain on the floor. I was crying, yelling, and banging on furniture begging The Voice to free me of my torment. It was the most painful migraine I had ever experienced. It was conditioning me, manipulating me, pain being the all-powerful variable in controlling my actions.

"Do exactly as I say or this will NEVER end." The Voice growled

"anything." I whispered, "please, I'll do anything." I begged as morning light came

The next day I was drowsy and tired beyond any tiredness I'd ever felt. My eyes were swollen from crying all night and my headache was numb now. The Voice promised to keep my headache at bay so long as I followed the plan. I was broken, years of buildup from the torment and agony I'd felt my entire life were leading up to this.

I wore a hat, sunglasses, and a face mask. Weird looks from passersby but no one questioned my outfit. I drove into town, almost falling asleep a few times but the voice would startle me awake.

"HEY!" The Voice would scream and I would swerve back into my lane. My hands were sweaty and shaking as I came to the local shopping mall. Sweat rolled down my forehead and I had to take off my mask to keep my composure during this heatwave. I was dizzy almost not knowing what I had to do. Almost. I found my target, A little boy whose mother was too busy shopping at Rue 21 to pay attention to her son.

I lured the boy over to me.  "hey you". I whispered, the little boy almost didn't hear me and he walked over to me. The mother and employees were too busy or distracted to notice as I held the boy's hand and told him I'd take him to get ice cream. I was trembling as we walked out of the mall, this was INSANE, no one even batted an eye at what looked to be a father and son leaving the mall together on their way to get something sweet. The Voice silently chuckled, its demented plan being carried out by me.

I could feel my blood rushing through my entire body. The pressure felt like my veins were going to burst like a hose and spew everywhere.

"H-Hey there's our stop." I said pointing at the ice cream parlor.

I wasn't lying to him, I took him to an Ice Cream parlor and he wanted moose tracks. My head throbbed and the voice whispered for me to follow the plan. Part of me wanted to be caught, I wanted someone to stop us and ask the boy if I was his father but it never happened. I at least wanted the little boy to have one last good memory before I continued the plan. As we drove away my phone buzzed with an amber alert. My heart raced almost out of my chest as I pulled up the alert and read.

"Child Abduction- Indianapolis IN, 5-year-old, blonde male taken from shopping mall wearing blue race car shirt and cargo shorts."

It was for him, I felt lightheaded, I wanted to pass out, I wish I did, I wish I were dead. So many things I wish had happened instead. I wanted to take this boy back to his worried mother, a reunion I begged for. Tears once again welled up in my swollen eyes as we made our way home.

Once we were inside the boy asked if I had any more ice cream. Looking at him and his chocolate-smeared face I smiled. "Sure bud, we have-"

"NO WE DON'T!" The Voice screamed as I put my hands to my head. The boy jumped and looked frightened at my sudden change in demeanor. I went for the freezer, A million needles seemingly piercing my skull as I pulled out an ice pop to give to the boy.

"I want blue." He said,

"too fucking bad." The Voice whispered

"Go watch cartoons buddy, I have all the cartoon channels." I said crying

The boy lit up, not knowing or understanding why I was crying went over and found the remote, to my surprise he knew exactly how to work my TV. My head pounded like a sledge hammer repeatedly slamming my skull.

"THIS ISN'T THE PLAN!" The Voice hollered

I fell to the ground curling up into a ball "I can't, please just-" A sharp jab ran straight through my brain causing me to exclaim.

"FEED ME BROTHER! FEED MEEEEEEE!"

"Please, just-" I screamed as it felt like my brain was being pulled from all directions

"YOUR LIFE WILL BE THIS! NOTHING ELSE UNTIL YOU FUCKING FEED ME YOU ROTTEN SHIT!"

"I can't" I whimpered as my tears pooled under my cheek on the cold tile floor.

"THAT BOY IS SHIT! FUCKING NOTHING! YOU WILL FEED ME! AND I PROMISE YOU IF YOU DON'T THIS CAN BE SO MUCH WORSE!!!"

Sobbing, and without saying a word I got up almost slipping on my tears and slobber. I went for the kitchen knife, the big one like in the movies. I didn't want to believe I could do it, it wasn't in me. The boy would be fine, I can't possibly do this. I walked behind the couch the little boy knew I was there but he was clearly scared and didn't want to look. He clutched a couch pillow in fear as I raised the knife. Tears and snot covered my face and I was hyperventilating, The Voice chattered teeth in excitement for what I was about to do. I'm so sorry, I'm so fucking sorry.

I brought the knife down into the boy's chest, through the T-rex on his graphic tee piercing his lung. He didn't even have time to let out a scream. I pulled the knife from his chest and He fell to the floor gasping for air. Blood pooled in his mouth foaming out slowly. He stared at me and began crying, clutching his chest. I looked down at his bloody face wincing at every attempt to breathe. I turned away, I couldn't bear to watch this horrible sight any longer as I cried for his life. a minute went by before the boy went silent. A life snuffed out by me, it was my choice, I did it selfishly to ease my pain. The Voice didn't control my actions, I did, and it made me sick.

I ran to the sink vomiting and slipped on my pool of saliva and tears. vomit ended up all over the cabinets and didn't make it into the sink. Crying harder than I'd ever cried in my life I banged my hand against the counter. What the hell had I done? I didn't want to believe that there was a dead little boy in my apartment. But there was and I couldn't run from it.

"feed me." The Voice whispered to me "feed me brother."

I wailed "Oh God! WHY! FUCK WHY!"

"it'll all be better soon brother, trust me."

"I CAN'T TRUST YOU! JESUS FUCKING CHRIST" I sobbed "WHAT THE HELL HAVE I DONE?!"

"do you feel that?" The Voice said "Relief?"

My headache was entirely gone, not like before but like it never even existed. For the first time I could remember I felt nothing in my head, no pain, no numbness. Absolutely nothing. I couldn't help but laugh, through wet tears and snot I laughed. not for what I just did but for what The Voice just said. He was right, I felt relieved, I'm ashamed to admit it but I was so relieved. I could finally know a life without pain, but that little boy paid the ultimate price for my selfish bliss. It was euphoric, it was sickening.

"I can keep it that way forever brother, no more pain, please just feed me." my brother whispered calmingly

I smiled "OK" breathing a sigh of relief "I will feed you brother." I said, my psyche completely broken giving into his will.

I walked over to the dead boy and saw his lifeless eyes seemingly lurking through the room. Although that was impossible, His glare shot straight at me, making eye contact. I felt scared and naked standing there like I was caught watching porn, I leaned over to puke but nothing came out but a large burp, and I gagged. still, I picked up his bloody corpse and brought it to the empty sink. His eyes kept contact with mine the entire time as I lay his small body into the sink. I grabbed his hand, lifted it up, and began sawing it off. Blood squirted out in all directions and the bone got caught on the serrations of the knife. Struggling I snapped his bones in his wrists and sawed through the rest of the limp flesh. He still stared at me as I pulled his hand off, stretching skin from the rest of his arm.

Holding this hand devoid of a body I brought it to my mouth. Crunching down on half his index and middle fingers and tearing it off into my mouth. It tasted disgusting but still warm, like dinner cooked half an hour ago. The bones crunched in my teeth getting stuck between them and jabbing the inside of my mouth. I gagged and vomited this time bloody foamy vomit spewed up from my throat.

"feed me brother, oh sweet, sweet brother." He whispered longingly

Crying and bleeding out of my mouth I said "Please no more headaches, you have to promise before I'll feed you."

"I promise," he said quietly and reassuringly. I felt trust in him this time, like I'd never felt before.

I raised the rest of the hand to the back of my head, moving away hair where my brother's mouth sat inside my body. His teeth bit down on part of the hand and I pulled it away, tearing flesh from popping bone. Warm juice ran down the back of my head, neck, and back. My brother chewing and crunching the hand felt rattling in the back of my head. With every snap of bone and tearing of flesh, I felt it resound through my head painfully, but I knew it wasn't on purpose.

"More brother." He said squeezing bloody flesh between his teeth

"OK," I said a single tear rolling down my face, a smile widening as I raised the rest of the wrist to his mouth. As the bones painfully split in the back of my head I laughed leaning against the counter and so did my brother as I made us lunch from the staring boy's corpse. I was finally free of my life of pain, and that's all I've ever really wanted. I can finally live a normal life and I couldn't be happier.
