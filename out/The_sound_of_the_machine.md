I live in a town that is next to a quite large factory, the factory has normal working sounds like any other factory, but once a month there is a really loud sound of a machine working for 30 minutes. 

Everyone in the town can hear the machine, the owner of the factory mister Jackson apologised to the entire town and said that he had to use old machinery since the newer models were unreliable.

I remember in my youth when i was 7 years old, everyone around me was angry at mister jackson. But he did something that won him the favour of the people. 

He bought things for them, he gave roses to the husbands for them to gift them to the wives, he lended money without asking for a return to the people who wanted to open their own businesses, he donated money to the town council for road repairs.

He did good things, and the people loved him enough for them not to try and remove mr.jackson from the town. 

When i was 15 years old i was with my group of friends, playing around and talking with them, daniel Mccormick looked at me with his icy blue eyes and asked me "do you ever plan on opening your own business?" 

"Why would i want to do that?"when i answered him i thought about the benefits of having a business, having a business and getting a lot of money would be nice but there are many responsibilities. Daniel just smiled at me and looked away for 30 seconds, then he suddenly spoke "well, to get money,influence,respect. You know many people are opening their own businesses in the last 3 years? We could start our own business!" 

"Selling what?" I quickly replied to him.daniel then spoke enthusiastically "Well we could start a unique restaurant, specializing in selling unique and exotic foreign foods!" 

To be honest,in our town there aren't too many restaurants selling exotic foreign food, but considering most of us are teenagers we would first have to make money through a job. 

My eyes wandered around then i sharply looked at daniel and i said "you do realize we would have to first HAVE money to be able to start restaurant? We would also have to make authentic quality foreign food, do you have a job yet?" 

Just before daniel could answer,howard yelled out "you know we could borrow money from mr.jackson right?" 

And just then the sound of the machine screamed out. 

Everyone was startled by the machine and placed their hands in their ears, we all then ran the opposite of the direction of the sound. 

After 15 minutes of running we came to a place where the machine wasn't as loud. 

No-one said anything until the machine was done making the sound 

"Man, that thing is so loud! Why didn't he place  the factory much further away from the town?" Howard said loudly. 

All 9 of us turned towards him, then i spoke "i don't trust mr.jackson, something about him just doesn't feel good" 

"Really?" Jack said "the man who gives money to everyone so they can tolerate the sounds of his machine doesn't feel like a good man to you?" 

I looked towards the direction of his factory "more like he gives them gifts, i just don't like the man and i don't like that old car making machine of his that is so loud!" 

I then turned towards all of them and i said "i have a plan,why don't we destroy that old machine of his with molotov cocktails!" 

Many of the boys didn't agree with me, after they all voiced their reasons many of them left, leaving only me,daniel,jack,john,and howard to raid the factory. 

We gathered everything we needed for the raid,2 medium bombs and 4 molotov cocktails. 

We went to mr.jacksons car factory that night with flashlights, we searched around in the dark factory, then we heard footsteps and we quickly hid. 

We saw mr.jackson and several other men bring in large containers, we then saw them bringing people out of there. 


I could barely hear the conversation but just then they brought out a giant speaker, we then managed to quietly get close to them, and we saw a metal door opening the ground and we saw 100s of bodies insidie and a giant machine which seemed to kill people. 

I was scared,seeing what they were doing to those people and seeing that hole truly did scare me.

One of the people started to scream so mr.jackson screamed at another man to turn on the sound.

When they did we barely could tolerate that, so howard grabbed the molotov cocktail and threw it ar the large speaker. 

Everyone there panicked, the fire spread quickly and the people in the container started running away, a couple of men chased after them but daniel threw another molotov cocktail at them and they started to burn

Mr.jackson saw us and screamed at us "I'LL KILL YOU, YOU LITTLE SHITS!" we then threw the rest of our improvised weaponry onto them and mr.jackson and rhe rest of his men died. 

We quickly ran away from the burning factory.

The next morning all the news talked about the event,one of the people from the shipping containers talked to the police, and the police found the bodies that were in the hole.

All the people from the shipping containers made it back safely to their homes. 

While the police found the body of dead mr.jackson.

I don't know exactly what Mr.jacksons reason was for killing people,I asked around and nobody knew, what I do know is that there is a theory that he was a sadist.
