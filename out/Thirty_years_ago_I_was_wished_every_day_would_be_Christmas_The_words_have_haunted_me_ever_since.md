If you’re reading this, you’re like me. At least a little. And for that, I’m sorry. 

You probably have some place better to be. Maybe there are presents waiting for you under a tree. A crackling fire might be calling out to you. You could leave now, go sit next to it, and try to slow your mind enough to actually appreciate something simple. But you won’t. You can’t. If there’s family in the next room, they know better than to call you over.

For one reason or another, you’ve wound up here, reading my words. And that’s a good thing. They’re meant for you. If I’m successful in collecting the few sane thoughts I have left and I’m able to organize them just enough to convey some meaning, maybe you’ll see how deep our connection really goes and that there’s something to learn in all of this. That buried inside the even wildest fantasy can lie a curse. And that the faintest spark of hope can sometimes be enough to warm yourself by.

Because you’re not like me. Not entirely. 

And for that, you should be truly grateful.

What makes a given day special? I have found myself asking that question often lately. When I was a child, the calendar told me which days were important. The good one were marked there. Birthdays, holidays, the start of summer vacation. These were the tentpoles that carried me through the year, how I measured time, always fighting off the feeling that I would never make it to the next.

And yet, I would have traded every one of them for a single December 25th. 

Birthdays bring presents, and Thanksgiving puts delicious food on the table. Christmas would give you all of that and deliver it with a flourish that no other square on the calendar could offer.

Magic. 

But it wasn’t gifts under the tree that made me believe in the day’s supernatural qualities. That notion had faded years before, when I had opened a copy of *Street Fighter II* that was markedly similar to the one I had found weeks earlier in the coat closet. 

Christmas’ real power was what it did to my parents. By the time I was nine-years-old, their arguments had become increasingly regular. And when frequency couldn’t go up any more, volume did. I never understood the fights, or why they needed to happen at all. There was no primary perpetrator, other than whoever made the first unnecessary comment or raised their voice in response. 

I had noticed the effect that the season had on them a couple years before that Christmas—the one that changed my life forever. By that time, when I was eight-years-old and  a shared look between them cut an argument off at the knees, it went beyond what I thought the holiday could deliver. It felt magical.

That particular Christmas morning, I woke up alone. My mother hadn’t crawled into my bed during the night to lie beside me. The walls hadn’t been humming with the distant shouts they never did enough to conceal. And my eyes weren’t puffed from crying. The house was at peace, as if it held its breath in anticipation of what awaited me downstairs.

I only glimpsed the tree and the neat stack of gifts next to it before I found my parents, and when I did, my eyes refused to leave them.

They sat together in the corner, across from the tree. She was perched on the arm of the reading chair. He was on its wide, comfy seat, inches from her. They watched me, smiling from behind the veil of steam that rose from their mugs. Their eyes had the same sleepless look that I was accustomed to, but the redness was of a different temperature. It was joyful.

“Well, do you wanna open them?” my dad asked with a grin.

The morning proceeded with the breathless sense of an uneasy balance. With every present I unwrapped, I would only glimpse back at the sight of them, careful not to stare too long and scare it away. The only notion that could chase off my fear that something would break the facade was the ecstatic disbelief that Christmas had pulled off its trick once again. 

After presents, we had to prepare for our arriving guests, which meant straightening the house. In years past, my parents would need to pull me away from the thrall of some toy, but not that day. Nothing could have taken me from their side or out of the sunshine of their gaze. I eagerly cleaned up alongside them, blinking back tears of joy.

The doorbell heralded a flurry of familiar faces. Aunts and uncles, grands and greats. Relative strangers whose importance in my life was stated rather than understood. I sat at the kitchen table watching my parents listen to the stories they told, that referenced histories unknown to me. But my mom and dad followed and would gasp or laugh as stories took unexpected turns. And I marveled at the people they could be, unburdened by the weight of a normal day. 

As the sun set, I found my thoughts traveling ahead of me, away from the warm light of the kitchen table, to the next morning, when the sun would rise again—except on a cold day, free from magic. I would go downstairs to find that it had been a trick after all.

It was then that one of my older cousins ran into the room, shouting about what was happening outside.

There was a slow march from the kitchen to the coat pile and then out the front door to snow-covered yard. We filed past the snowman that my dad and I had built the day before, huddled together, and—finding nothing apparent around us—looked upward.

The sky was streaked with light.

“A meteor shower,” one of my great uncles declared with a confidence earned from PBS documentaries. But that certainty faded as the lines appearing out of the void began to glow a brighter and brighter shade of green. “Huh,” the same uncle said, a note of fear materializing much like the colorful bands above us. “Not sure I’ve seen that before.”

I don’t remember deciding to make the wish in that moment—or whether I knew I was making one at all. I recall the chill on my cheeks, the weight of my parents’ hands on my shoulders, and the clarity with which a single thought played out across my mind.

I wanted every day to be Christmas. 

Those words have haunted me ever since.

\#

I lingered in bed the next morning, held there by the notion that the previous day wouldn’t have truly ended until I left it. I must have lied there extending Christmas for hours before there was a gentle knock on the door.

When I saw that it was my dad poking his head into my room, I began to get up. An early appearance from him typically meant one thing. I had a role to play, to not make matters worse by adding friction to a day already grinding him down.

But sitting on the edge of the bed, I met his eye and found something unexpected. “Well,” he began with a note of concern beneath his bemusement. “Do you wanna open them?”  

I didn’t recognize his words from the day before, nor did I recall the shooting stars. Those were connections I would draw later, hours after I had followed my dad downstairs to find our tree once again resplendent with wrapped presents meant for me.

Mom waited for us on the armchair, wearing a quizzical expression resembling my father’s from when he woke me. All three of us were seeking answers.

Had I imagined the day before? Had that been a dream? Or was I dreaming now? 

Each seemed more plausible than Christmas having repeated itself. But no matter the nature of the illusion, I wasn’t ready for it to shatter. 

That morning passed much the same as the December 25th before it — but not identically. The presents I opened were new. Seeing them torn into brought a similar anxious joy to my parents, who asked if I liked what I was receiving. They must have seen the curious look on my face as I unwrapped boxes attempting to untangle what exactly was happening.

Of course, I told them. They were still happy, together. What could have disappointed?

Even so, something exceedingly strange was happening. In the privacy of my bedroom, I set aside my new toys to try to decipher what was actually occurring. 

I laid out the facts as I knew them.

This was another Christmas. I didn’t seem any taller, so unless I had finished growing by the age of eight, a year hadn’t somehow passed over night. My parents were unaware of anything odd, so for them, yesterday must have been Christmas Eve. If their memories didn’t carry over, what did?

Like most children on Christmas Day, my thoughts seized upon my gifts—though not the ones I had just opened. The presents from the previous morning were gone. The neat pile I had organized them into at the foot of my bed had vanished. I scrambled across the carpet, reaching beneath the bed skirt and behind that day’s toys for any sign of yesterday’s. Then my hand found the leg.

My fingers froze. Its shape was unmistakable, even disconnected from the rest of the body.

The white boot could have belonged to any of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, but the green in the diamonds and along the top half of the leg could only be Tommy Oliver’s. The Green Ranger. The best one. I had received him just the day before, but there was only a remnant of him left—broken, discarded, and forgotten.

I didn’t have time to ponder what it meant, though it clearly indicated something. I was needed back downstairs. 

Guests were on their way. 

\#

I carried on that way for some time—waking every morning to find Christmas renewed and my parents still in harmony. 

Remaining in this winter wonderland came at the cost of every other day of the year. There would be no more birthdays or Halloweens or summer vacations, yet I was unbothered. I had received the very thing that all children longed for, that full-grown adults wrote songs about. 

Of course, I see how naive that all was now.

Because time did pass.

After a few hundred Christmases, I found that the calendars had progressed a year. The hash marks I made on my doorframe with a pencil resting atop my head told a similar story.

And Christmas changed with me. 

The differences were small at first. My parents and I stopped cleaning up together after presents. Inevitably some chore would take either my mom or dad across the house, where they could be on their own. At night, they would speak to separate relatives during the party and do dishes in silence after everyone had left. As much as I told myself that things weren’t going back to the way they had been, that these small observations were simply my fears creeping into view from the edges of my mind, it couldn’t be denied forever. 

The first morning I found them seated apart, I was between 13 and 14 years old and had experienced somewhere in the neighborhood of two thousand Christmases. There were still smiles on their faces, but the lights behind them had dimmed. I could feel them deciding that their performance was too taxing, less necessary for a kid my age. 

When I finally did wake up to find that my dad didn’t live with us anymore—and apparently hadn’t for months—it wasn’t all that surprising. He arrived later that day, with the rest of the family, and hugged my mom with a sense of obligation, the last remnant of their two-person act. I imagine that any kid watching their parents’ marriage disintegrate before their eyes feels that same keen sting of helplessness. 

But I had to on Christmas. 

And only Christmas.

\#

It had been years since I had actually asked for anything. The overabundance of Christmases had left me bereft of requests. But as the holiday continued on, only ever reminding me of what I had lost, I had found something I wanted more than I could ever remember.

December 26th. 

As a teenager, Santa Claus was a concept I knew I should have discarded years before. But considering that I had found myself stuck in an endless loop of Christmases, I had to admit that there were aspects of  the universe and its various holidays that were beyond even my post-pubescent sagacity. 

From what I could recall, the process of writing a letter to him was relatively straightforward. I would address the man warmly, but not in an overly familiar manner. An accounting of my behavior from the last year was customary and helped the ask that followed immediately after go down more easily.

I’m not entirely sure what I wrote. If I had to guess, I most likely thanked Santa for the opportunity to experience never-ending Noels, before explaining I had come to see that the meaning of the day lied far beyond presents and cookies. 

It must have been some trite drivel like that, because in the days after I hid the note somewhere my mother wouldn’t find it and came to discover it had vanished overnight, I learned that I was in far much more trouble than I had previously understood. 

\#

A week after the letter to Santa disappeared, I was still waking up on Christmas, so that night, I asked my uncle what he knew about meteor showers. 

It may have been the first question I ever asked him, and he reacted with an amount of surprise that confirmed as much. He rubbed his forehead as if his memory needed warming up. He said that he had watched a documentary on PBS about them a long time ago. How much of it he retained, he couldn’t say, but politely asked what I had wanted to know anyway. 

I ask my uncle how often meteor showers occurred, and he brightened at my question. It was one he knew the answer to. There were about a hundred or so named meteor showers that happened every year, usually around the time. When I tried reminding him of the bright green one we had all witnessed together on the front lawn, he seemed less sure. 

“This was on Christmas?” he asked. “You’re sure?” 

“Pretty sure,” I said, trying my best to keep the frostiness I felt from my voice.

He didn’t remember that ever happening, but suggested we take a look at the night’s sky, just in case. 

We stood together, bundled up on the snowy grass, starring at the flawless expanse of black above us. There no meteors. Something in me knew there wouldn’t ever be. I have to think my uncle suspected the same, but he continued to play along, wondering aloud whether he had just seen one.

It had been stupid to think I could simply leave Christmas the way I had come in. My cheeks grew warm against the cold air. I wanted to look anywhere but the sky. That’s how I found the snowman. 

The mounds of snow shaped roughly into human form had been the other constant since my wish. If my parents acknowledged it at all, they might mention that one of them had helped me build it the previous day, a moment I would never have access to. The last snowman I had any memory of making was the one from the day before the wish.

And to my recollection, that snowman didn’t have as grotesque a face as the one standing a few feet from me and my uncle. 

Its topmost sphere had become misshaped, likely melted by bright sunlight reflecting off the snow around it. One half of its head sloped to the side, dragging down a coal eyeball with it and transforming the rigid smile into a grimace. But even more than how the snowman looked, I was unnerved by *where* it looked. I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was glaring at me, its malformed countenance somehow aware of my presence and wanting me to know. It was as if the letter had somehow tipped off the holiday itself to my dissatisfaction with the wish. For the first time since all of these Christmases had begun, I felt that I was in danger.

When my uncle gave up on the meteors several long moments later, I hastily agreed that perhaps we had missed them. We made for the door, and I forced myself to not glance behind me. I knew that the snowman’s craggy black eyes weren’t following me inside. 

They couldn’t.

Without the hope of a rescue from Santa or another meteor shower, I started keeping to my room during the evenings. Sometimes, one of my parents would come to check that I was all right. Other times, they wouldn’t, probably chalking up my remove to regular teenage angst. 

I had been looking out my bedroom window on one of those nights, watching the snow fall gently onto the front lawn when I noticed the snowman facing a different direction than it usually stood. The one I remember building with my parents faced out toward the street, just like every snowman that came after. Except this one. 

This snowman resembled the one from the night with my uncle in the yard, but with its features had shifted. They were set higher on its sloped head, as if it were peering up—directly at my window. Again, I told myself that snowmen couldn’t look anywhere, thinking level-headed enough to allow me to fall fitfully to sleep. 

The next night, I found the snowman standing directly beneath my window. I stopped skipping the parties after that.

Decades slipped by. Only Christmas stayed the same.

The first time one of my grandparents didn’t show up at the start of a party, I asked my mother if her dad was still coming. Her eyes were brimmed with tears. Of course, he wasn’t coming, she told me with a mix of frustration and concern on her face.

So I started asking fewer questions. 

For me, the people in my life only existed on Christmas but the same was not true for them—even in regard to me. I had to piece together my life away from December 25th from the inquiries I received while making small talk. By my thirties, I knew I wasn’t living at home anymore, but always spent Christmas Eve in my old room. A cousin told me they liked my place in the city, which was nice to hear. 

When they asked about the girl I had been seeing, I didn’t know what to say. Before I could stumble through a deflection like I usually would, my aunt—their mom—butt in to admonish them. It had been rude of them to ask such a question, she told them. They should have known it was over between this girl. She had ended things months before. My aunt apologized on behalf of her kid and consoled me about the broken relationship, of which I had no recollection. She had been sad to see us break up. She thought we were going to get married. My aunt seemed to have really liked her. I’m sure I would have too. I never was able to figure out what happened between us.

Another plate of turkey and stuffing was impossible to stomach after that. The meal that I had told myself I could never get sick of was now nauseating, so I took the first excuse I could find to get out the house. My dad seemed suspicious at my insistence that we needed more ice, but I was adamant. And he, maybe sensing a deeper need than cold drinks, tossed me his keys. 

He had every reason to believe I knew how to drive. The version of me that my dad encountered every other day of the year probably did know how to drive, but when you’re stuck in a time loop on Christmas, it’s a skill that’s hard to pick up. Thankfully, there was a 7-Eleven a mile or so from my mom’s place, and I didn’t mind a walk in the cold. 

The snowman, of course, was there to watch me go. 

Walking past the connected storefronts of the strip mall, the smell of toasted sesame oil pulled me up short of the convenience store. Steam obscured the windows of the Chinese restaurant in front of which I had stopped. Apparently, I was just hungry for something other than Christmas dinner. 

The bells on the door that jangled as I entered could have been hung for the holiday or were simply always there to alert the staff of a customer entering. A face appeared in the passage to the kitchen a moment later. I could sit anywhere, they said.

There was only one other person in the small dining room. She sat along the wall with her back to the door, her dark hair peeking over the top of the booth. A quaint eatery, every available seat in the restaurant was closer than I would have chosen to sit, but she didn’t seem to mind, offering a nod of camaraderie before returning to her meal. I was flipping through the hefty menu when she spoke up.

She told me to get the duck. It was what she came here for every Christmas. In her opinion, it was one of the two actually good things about the day.

I thanked her for the recommendation, privately also grateful for the obvious follow-up question. The last girl my age I remember speaking with socially had been eight.

“What’s the other good thing?” I asked. 

“’Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,’” she said.

It was the only Christmas song that understood the day, that engaged with life as it really is—largely a miserable slog. She didn’t have much family, and the bit she did have wasn’t worth keeping around. That fact used to make the holidays hard for her, serving as a reminder of what she lacked more than anything. But one day, she heard the song playing over the P.A. system at a grocery store, and for some reason, the words sounded clearer than they ever had before. 

“Have yourself a merry little Christmas. Let your heart be light.” 

It’s all a choice, she said. Christmas is nothing more than an excuse to guarantee one good day for yourself and the people who mean something to you.

And for her, that meant duck.

We didn’t talk much after that. She finished her meal shortly thereafter, thanked the staff, and left with a small wave to me. 

She had been right about the duck.

Walking home, I thought about my mom and dad. About how they were still waiting for me at home. About how that even as life as they had known it fell apart apart, they would always come together—for me. And how even after all these years, I could still count on seeing them every day, even if it was just once a year for them.

There was a lot to think about on that cold walk home, made colder by the ice I was carrying. I sped up, eager to see that house and walk through that front door—so much so that I failed to notice the snowman missing from the front yard.
