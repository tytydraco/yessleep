On January 3rd, 2020, I witnessed the apocalypse. 

I can't remember why, but I can recall feeling a great sense of anger and sorrow the night before it. I can vividly see myself sitting in bed and just wanting to punch the wall. I decided that I'd try to sleep those negative feelings off and hope they'd go away, and I think part of me wished I could sleep forever at this point. I forced myself to lie in bed and finally drifted off after an hour or so of tossing and turning.

At 5:00 AM, I was awoken by a loud cacophony. My senses were instantly sharpened by how loud it was; The sound of those countless panicked voices and cries of pain among the crashing and roaring shook me to the core. Without another thought, all I could do was sprint downstairs and fly out of the door to see what was happening. I'll never forget what I saw outside.

Almost all the residents of the other houses were sprinting from their homes. Many of them were frantically carrying their children, pets or prized belongings and getting into the car to drive to who-knows-where. Among the screaming, I heard people loudly wailing and lamenting that this was 'The end of everything.' I saw flames roaring upon the horizon and yet all the panicked people weren't focused in it. Rather, they were looking upwards and screaming at *something* up in the sky. 

My mind felt just as disordered and chaotic as the sight before me. I found myself trembling before my thoughts suddenly turned to thoughts of my friends who lived down the block. I know it might sound impulsive now, but right there, all I needed was to be sure my friends were safe as this happened. I quickly ran away from where I was and bounded through all the discord to the one who lived closest to me. But when I finally got to his house, I froze.

He was laying dead upon the grass. He'd been burned to a crisp. I found myself suddenly caught in some belief that what I saw before me was just a hallucination. I stood there for so long, trembling uncontrollably until the sound of a car pulling up to the house snapped me out of the shocked trance. I turned to see my friends gathered inside of it. My chest felt heavy as I watched them realize their friend was laying dead on the lawn; each person was either frozen or scrambling in terror. One of them even began sobbing hopelessly.

After a minute, they pulled me into the car without saying anything. I said nothing back as I just sat in my seat and leaned my head against the window, trembling and numb, staring at the destruction outside. Staring at the buildings burning and the countless people meeting their agonizing end. Soon, I couldn't help but make a vain attempt to make sense of this situation.

"What's happening?" I asked my friends as we drove on, as though it was a casual situation.

"The world is ending," our driver replied flatly. 

Those words didn't seem real to me. The apocalypse was just something that happened in movies and books. It couldn't be real. In that moment, I saw the end of the world not for how horrifying it was but rather how impossible all that horror felt. We kept driving, only finding more danger and chaos. With the four words I'd just heard, I felt- No, I knew- that even if we drove forever, we'd never find somewhere safe. 

Just then, I felt a great rumble in the ground which nearly veered our car off its track. Silent panic and worry filled the car for a moment. It quickly calmed down until we heard a strange roaring sound and a larger rumble caused the car to veer even more, crashing into the edge of a bridge. My life flashed before my eyes as my friends screamed and the window right next to my head loudly shattered. I was dizzy, struggling to fully realize that we'd crashed as I felt myself slump to one side. I felt myself slipping out of the warmth of the seat and into the air. Then, I was falling.

I plummeted into the water beneath us, suddenly awakening mentally. My instincts to live kicked in and I was quickly filled with panic and terror at the prospect of dying. I scrambled and swam to get out, yet I couldn't figure which way was up. My thoughts became blurry as I suffocated. 

The water became heavier and the world became darker, but it soon felt warm and restful. I embraced whatever awaited me and sank downward into the abyss.

I died January 3rd at 7:02 AM.

I awoke January 4th at 8:30 AM. 

At first, I was filled with confusion. The images and feelings of all I'd experienced were fresh in my mind and I couldn't comprehend the fact that I was awake. I was soon able to fully wake myself up. I was in my bedroom. But as my senses sharpened, everything came flooding back. The chaos, the sight of my dead friend, the revelation that the world was ending, and finally the car crash that'd landed me in the sea as I drowned.

But when I turned to look out the window, I was greeted with blue skies and the sound of birds singing.

Stumped, I looked at my arms and legs and checked for any bruises or proof that I'd just died a day ago; there was still nothing. The sight of my friend, dead and burned, flashed through my mind again. I quickly ran downstairs and opened the door to see the neighborhood undamaged and peaceful. I ran down to that same friend's house and knocked on the door. He answered, happy and uninjured, and asked me what I was looking for.

Not knowing what to say, I simply asked if he wanted to do anything with our other friend later. He looked at me with confusion and asked, "Who is that?"

Now, I was filled with even more confusion and panic.

I ran down to the houses of every other friend who'd been in the car with me. Each one was empty as if nobody had ever lived there. I asked people around the neighborhood if they knew any of them, and each person said no and looked at me as though I was insane. I told so many people about the apocalypse the day before, and I was labeled as delusional each time.

In these past 4 years, I've had so many horrific nightmares of the experience. The horrific sights, sounds and feelings from that day are embedded in my mind. Nothing can convince me it just didn't happen, that my friends who I now miss deeply simply don't exist at all. If they're dead in some way, I don't even get to mourn them properly because nobody remembers who they are. And they aren't the only one; there were more people who were 'erased.' There were celebrities who I recall the image of vividly and are now remembered or recognized by nobody. In fact, I recall that the population was 9 billion before January 3rd. On the 4th, it was only 7 billion and everyone claims that it's always been like that.

Whatever happened, it seems I'm the only one who knows. I tried attending therapy and when I told my therapist that I'd died in the apocalypse, even she wrote me off as delusional. I've made posts on the internet again and again, searching endlessly for someone, somewhere, who might remember what happened as well. I never found anyone who did.

Please, I beg of you; Please tell me I'm not insane. Please tell me there could be someone out there who knows what happened. 

Even if it was just one person, I would feel so much less alone in this madness.
