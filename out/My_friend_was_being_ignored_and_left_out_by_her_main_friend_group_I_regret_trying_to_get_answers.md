My friend, Alice, and I, are girls in their early 20s. Alice has a main friend group of six girls, including her. They're all in their early 20s and, according to Alice, usually went to the movies, streamed TV series, and discussed their everyday lives, among other things. I should've noticed something was up sooner, but I have a habit of looking on the too-positive side. To better understand this situation, here's the context:


Back in early November, Alice told me her friends were starting to hang out without her. She would try to initiate plans, but they'd always fall through, because her friends would always say they overestimated the time they had to hang out. While this sounded concerning, I wasn't willing to believe friends of five years would ditch her without reason. When I discussed it with her, I told her it was likely a coincidence. She then told me her friends were still responding to TikTok and Instagram posts, along with direct messages. It seemed to me she was overthinking. When I told her that, she let out a sigh of relief. Everything seemed to be fine.


Alice had a group chat with her friends. On January 14th, she told me the group chat had been silent for an entire day, which, according to her, was unusual. The last of her messages any of her friends responded to was sent on the morning of the previous day, January 13th. All private messages about the chat were ignored. I didn't know what to tell her. She then told me she tried initiating plans with Sarah, but it turned out she was busy. She went to Sarah’s Instagram page, where there was a new ig story. She tapped the story and what popped up was an image of all five of her friends sitting next to each other, holding glasses of wine and laughing. Alice buried her hands in her face and moaned. I empathized with her, as I knew how harrowing social anxiety can be. That pit is a terrible, overbearing feeling. All I could do was tell her to wait. It didn't help that nobody would respond to private messages about the group chat. It really didn't help when, as the weeks went by, the chat remained empty.


In early February, I was at a bar when I ran into Jessica, one of Alice’s friends. I asked her about the group chat. Why was it empty? Why had it been empty for weeks?


“We don't have anything to say in there anymore.”


That's when I noticed Snapchat was open on her phone. There was an active group chat called MainFriendGC. I pointed at it, then asked her if Alice was part of it.


“No, it would be annoying for her.”


She turned her attention to her phone, leaving me confused, but with something to tell Alice. Once I told her, she told me her friends could've at least told her about the new chat. I agreed. I was distraught seeing all of this happening to a good friend of mine, so this is what I told her:


“I'll go tell them they need to include you more if they're really your friends.”


This is the thing I regret saying. Not because of what it means, but because of the circumstance it would end up putting me in.


Over the following few months, I’d hear Alice crying. Whenever I asked her what was up, it was always that she saw social media photos and videos of her friends hanging out without even speaking about or tagging her. Eventually, this interaction happened:


Alice opened the comment section under Sarah’s latest post. She scrolled down and hit the bottom. Her eyes widened. “Where's my comment? Did she delete it?”


I wanted to assure her it was probably a glitch, but at that point, if was obvious her “friends” were leaving her out and refusing to comment on their absence. Alice went to Jessica’s account, then navigated to the comment section of her most recent post. She scrolled through a couple dozen comments, then gasped. “I left like three comments on this post!” She then checked the comment section under Leah's latest post. Same thing. Anna’s latest post. Same thing. After checking Sandra’s latest post, she told me it was the same thing… her friends deleted all her comments. She moaned.


“I can't take this anymore!”


I was frustrated for her. As far as I've been told, her friends’ accounts are all private and they don't accept random follow requests. I got Alice to try to set up a sleepover with them. She messaged each of her friends, then we waited. To my actual surprise, Alice told me they responded with plans for a sleepover at Sarah’s house the following Saturday at 9 PM.


At 8 PM on Saturday night, Alice told me she got a message from Sarah reading, “Sorry, Alice, we're going to have to cancel the sleepover. I'm really busy right now. How about we shoot for some other time?”


I cringed at the excuse and that suggestion, knowing how fake they were. It hit like bricks, and I wasn't even experiencing this first hand. Alice and I left the house. All we brought with us were our wallets and keys. We weren't going to commit to anything nobody wanted to commit to, but this was ending tonight.


At around 8:30, we reached Sarah's door. I knocked, then took a deep breath. Sarah answered the door, eyes widening as they rested on Alice.


“Um, hold on a second.”


Sarah turned away, but I wasn't going to wait another second for this to end.


“No, we need to speak to you right now. Don't ignore us. I know that's what you like to do now, but you just can't.” Sarah turned to face me.


“You two aren't supposed to be here. Especially not you, Alice.” Alice furrowed her brows.


“Why are you doing this to me? I don't want to cry anymore! Just tell me why you aren't answering my messages and why there's a new group chat I wasn't told about. Do you guys want to be my friends anymore? Just tell me!” Sarah furrowed her brows.


“You know what, Alice? My friends and I aren't obligated to hang out with you, so just leave us alone!” That was the kind of lame excuse I expected. I pointed at her.


“Maybe you need to be upfront with her! Don't lead her friendship on! Nobody needs to be emotionally tormented! Maybe she deserves people who actually care about her and don't leave her out! What did she ever do to you, anyway?” Sarah stared into my eyes. 


“You're not welcome here. I don't know why Alice brought you here, but it's not going to change anything.” Determined to get some actual answers, I stepped towards her, but Alice told me we should go. I looked at her.


“We need answers!”


“No, we should just go. You're right, I shouldn't be around toxic people. This is too much for me.” Alice turned to the street, then walked along the pathway. I couldn't argue with what she said, so I followed behind.


We walked along the sidewalk in silence. I had a hard time processing how stupid this situation was. On our way, I heard the murmuring of a couple familiar voices. I looked back and saw five people walking a few dozen feet behind me. I took it as a coincidence. This group was just minding their own business, right? Then I heard the name, Leah, being uttered in Sarah's voice. I leaned close to Alice’s ear.


“I think your friends are following us.”


I looked back again. The girls were now speed walking. They sped under the shine of a street light, revealing a terrifying sight. They wore masks crafted out of grey touques and were each carrying two hammers, all pointing right at us. My heart sunk deep into my chest, then I turned my focus back onto the sidewalk in front of me and ran. Alice sprinted alongside me with a look of absolute terror. We took a left onto another road, then avoided every street light, so we could avoid being seen. I was tempted to look back, but wasn't willing to. We took another left, then a right.


At some point, I looked behind me. Nobody was there, aside from Alice. There was a street light shining on the corner we had just taken. I thought we had lost them, and took deep exhausted breaths. Dread filled my guts when I saw a couple of the girls walk under the light. My adrenaline shot up, compelling me to continue sprinting.


Alice and I took more lefts and rights, with me hoping to my soul I wouldn't find out what those psychopaths wanted. The worst part of it is, I thought they were regular everyday people. Now, they're ganging up and chasing after us with hammers for whatever reason.


Soon enough, I was out of breath again. Despite the adrenaline coursing through me, I slowed to a stop. I looked back. No girls. Alice had stopped as well, and was pretty much on her knees. I was trembling, hoping we had lost them. Eventually, we continued running.


By the time we got back to my home, my legs were about to break. Before we returned, I had called the police and made an agreement with Alice to hide at my place due to the fact her friends didn't know where I lived. We sped inside. I locked both of the doors, then shut every curtain while Alice shut off every light. Right now, I'm exhausted and shaky to the point where all I can do is breathe. I barely want to move, but I may jump any time I hear a knock or even anything similar to one.


I'm not, under any circumstances, telling you the room Alice and I are hiding in. I hope this ends soon. The police are on their way, so we should be good, right? Unless the girls get here before the cops do… then do things to us… We didn't get any answers, and I honestly don't feel like we will, but maybe that'll change someday. That’s all I wanted. Right now though, we're in need of help.
