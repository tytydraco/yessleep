As you all know i am a shift manager for our smaller location here at Redacted Restaurant Group however, today i got a promotion that changed everything. 

&#x200B;

"Rex" a older bald man said with a raspy voice "yes Mr. Brown what can I do for you" I replied with a almost smart remark. 

"Don't get smart Rex you know I never come to our smaller locations unless its for something urgent" he said sitting up straight in my office chair fixing his tie. 

"Now as you know our regional manager for this general area had a very unfortunate accident with one of our more strange set of rules" "As if there not all strange" i coughed forcing a smirk. "very funny Rex yeah keep it up see how far it gets you" he said now looking more annoyed then what he was. 

"Anyways I am here to offer you the position, you are my more senior manager and I could use you in a spot like this how about it?" I looked at him for a second before opening my mouth to speak, "I would love to but uh what are these new rules that I'm going to have to try not to die following." I said chuckling to myself as by now i have become immuned to all of Redacted's surprises. 

He stared at me for a second before reaching into his coat pocket and pulling out a neatly folded piece of paper and handing it to me. I unfolded the piece of paper and began to read it to myself when Mr. Brown stopped me dead in my tracks, "NO!! not here are you crazy do not read them here" he said now practically yelling in my face as if i was his son who just spilled juice on the family's new carpet. 

I stared blankly before folding it back up and placing it in my pocket. "Meet me tonight at 7pm sharp at this address" Mr. brown said now handing me an additional piece of paper with an address on it. 

I read the address and nodded as Mr. brown turned and walked out of the office disappearing as if he was never there. 

7pm came quick and quite frankly i was excited for this new job i have been assigned too. "Ah Mr. Rex" Mr. Brown said excitingly as he saw me park and exit my vehicle. "Mr. Brown" I said nodding my head at him as i swung my wind breaking over my shoulder. 

"Are we ready to go inside" Mr. Brown said motioning toward a tall concrete skyscraper that stood all alone in an empty parking lot in the middle of know where. 

"I guess so" i said taking one more look at the oddly tall building letting my saliva get stuck in my throat as i swallowed hard and began to walk toward the entrance. 

"So tonight should be pretty quite security has there own set of rules and they usually handle all if any intrusions pertaining to your short list of rules, oh you got the list right?" he said looking over at me as we walked through the very bright lobby. "yes right here" I said patting my right pocket. 

"Good good well this is the elevator you are to take it to the 200th floor and have a seat at the desk and read those rules above them should be a little note on how to start your shift good luck" He said shaking my hand and walking away through the lobby and out the front doors into the cool autumn night. 

I let a sigh escape my mouth as i entered the elevator and took it all the way up to the 200th floor. After what felt like ages of going up and up the elevators ding filled the shaft at a overwhelming level. I let out another sigh as i approached the very shiny and clean wooden desk that awaited me in the corner of a very dim room. 

"Ok let's see" I said to myself unfolding the list once again. 

"RULES FOR THE REGIONAL POSTION HERE AT REDACTED RESTAURANT GROUP"

were the words that fell upon my gaze in big bulk lettering as i unfolded the paper and began to read. 

&#x200B;

Rule 1. Between 11pm and 12am if you receive a call from security and the number is listed as anything else but the front desk let it ring do not pick up, no matter how loud the ringing becomes. If you decide to pick up we are not responsible for any hearing loss you may receive durn the duration of that call. 

Rule 2. A man in a security uniform may come off the elevator between 2 and 3am, ask him what he wants and if he starts asking if he can inspect your files tell him no as nice as possible and turn him back toward the elevator. Security has there own set of rules and duties and will never ask you to see your files there is no need for them to see them that is not there job, if they do not get back on the elevator there is a gun in your desk do what you have too. 

Rule 3. Sometime between 1 and 4am you may here voices coming from the desk opposite of your own, do not under any circumstances look over and see who it is if you have not already noticed you are alone and will always be alone on your shifts. If you so happen to ignore this rule and look over to the other desk the creature that will stare back at you will most likely rip your face to shreds. 

Rule 4. If you hear or see a little girl wandering your floor between 6 and 6:30am do not talk to her and do not make eye contact call security with the number posted above your computer. If you shall break this rule and make any contact with her you are to lock your self inside the elevator and disable it with the emergency stop, it will start again at 7am when your shift concludes. 

To start your shift please enter 001730 into the computer prompt and good luck.

I sat back in my chair letting yet another sigh escape as i wondered what the hell i got myself into. I did as the sheet said and started my shift, to my surprise it was very quite the first couple hours as Mr. Brown said it would be. I guess by now working for this company for 10+ years and knowing they are not reliable when it comes to taking there word on things i expected a demon to come try and kill me by now, but it was quite to quite.

And just like that as if i was in some kind of horror movie it happened, the sound of the elevator ding was filling the room once again, and i found myself looking at a 6'2 roughly 188 pound security guard. I shot a look down at the clock as he stepped off the elevator and approached me, it was 2:15am. 

"Can I help you" i managed to say in a quite but confident tone. "Uh yes you have a phone call on line 3 if you wanna take it" I paused for a second before giving my reply "who is it?" I said in a louder tone than before. 

"Not sure but hey can I look over your files while I'm here have to do a security check on them to make sure everything is up to date" my heart sunk into my stomach as he said this. Remembering rule 2 i looked at him and firmly said "no you can not". 

He looked at me for a second before repeating his question and saying it would only take a minute which i continued to deny him access and he finally turned and left back onto the elevator. Thankful i did not have to use the gun in the desk I turned back to the computer and then i realized, "Shit" I said to myself i never answered the call.

I looked down at the phone and clicked the line 3 button only to be met with static. I guess whoever it was simply no longer wanted to speak to me or there was simply nobody ever there in the first place. 

I sat back in my chair and continued my shift as normal, other than the actional weird noises that i could only guess was coming from the ventilation system it was very quite. 

I guess it was too quite as i started to get deep into a game of candy crush on my phone the sound of a little girl crying filled my office, "hello" I said calling out to whoever or whatever was making that noise. 

Before i could realize my mistake it was too late, a 8 foot tall skinny demon creature with the shape and face of a little girl now stood over my desk staring at me as i sat helplessly in my office chair. Remembering rule 4 i sprung to my feet and ran for the elevator, barely making it inside and slamming my palm against the emergency button on the wall. 

With a screech the elevator stopped and completely shut down all power to the shaft. My body relaxed against the wall of the elevator and before i knew it the doors swung open and there sat Paul the security guard. "Hey 7am you're all good to go home" he said looking down at me as i was now sitting on the floor of the elevator. 

I looked up at him and said nothing as i pushed passed him into the lobby "i see you met Sarah the last guy did to that's why he's not here anymore" he said laughing as i walked to the door and pushed it open heading into the parking lot. 

I sat in my car for what felt like hours honestly thinking to myself is this really what i want to keep doing. i returned the next night so i guess i answered my own question.
