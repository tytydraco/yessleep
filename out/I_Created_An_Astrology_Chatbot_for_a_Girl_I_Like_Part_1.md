This all started because of Jasmine. She’s the kind of girl who walks into a room, and suddenly, every other sound gets quieter. It’s not just how she looks (though yeah, she’s beautiful)—it’s how she talks, like every word she says is pulling you into her orbit.

I met her two months ago at a party, where she was chatting with a small group about the planets lining up a certain way soon. Like a total idiot, the first thing I said to her was, “Astrology’s not real, you know.” 

She laughed, thankfully. Not in a mean way, more like she was amused by how *wrong* I was. “Of course you’d say that,” she said, grinning. “What’s your sign?”

“My… what?” 

“Your zodiac sign.”

“Uh, Virgo?” 

Her grin widened like she just figured me out completely, “That makes sense. Virgos are skeptics.” 

We talked with the group for the rest of the night about the upcoming election, fate, and some really deep shit. At the end of the night, she leaned over to me and whispered, “I’m a Pisces, which means we could be really fun for each other.” 

 I felt my face burn red and she handed me her phone with a new contact already pulled up. Smooth, she was smooth in ways I could never be.

 That was my introduction to Jasmine and, well, her obsession with astrology. Charts, horoscopes, moon signs, all of it. We texted about how the stars guide everything—your relationships, your decisions, even your future. And yeah, I thought it was total nonsense. But Jasmine? She believes in it like it’s gospel. And for some reason, I couldn’t stop thinking about her after that.

I didn’t see her again until the next week when she invited me to a “star reading” party she was hosting. It sounded like a cult meeting, but I showed up because, well… Jasmine. Her apartment was packed with candles, crystals, and people talking about retrogrades like it was breaking news. I felt *completely* out of my element. But then Jasmine came over, grabbed my hand, and pulled me to the couch. 

“Let me read your chart,” she said, typing my birth date, time, and location into her astrology app. “Let’s see what the stars have to say about Geoff Lowe.” 

Honestly, I wasn’t expecting anything. But then she started talking. And the stuff she said… it wasn’t just generic “you like being alone” stuff. It was *specific*. Like, she knew I was terrible at letting people help me, even when I’m drowning. She knew my mom’s been on my case about college lately. She even guessed that I’d quit playing soccer last year, even though I didn’t tell her. I felt my stomach twist when she said, “You’re carrying a lot of guilt about something you couldn’t control.”

 

How the hell did she know that?

 

“Okay,” I said. “That was… freaky. How do you do that?”

 

“It’s not me,” she said, handing me her phone. “It’s the stars.”

 After that, I couldn’t stop thinking about how she nailed so many details about me. Sure, maybe it was coincidence. Or maybe she was just good at reading people. But part of me wondered: Could there actually be something to it? Or was I just falling for her so hard I was willing to believe anything she said?

So, like the nerd I am, I decided to test it. If astrology worked, then I could make it work scientifically. Right?

I figured if Jasmine could use an app to freak me out, why couldn’t I make one? I started training ChatGPT on open-source astrology data. I dumped in horoscopes, star charts, natal readings, even random Reddit posts about moon signs. It was kind of fun, honestly, building something that felt *alive*.

Then I took it a step further. Jasmine mentioned palmistry once, so I added an image recognition mode. Now, all someone had to do was upload a picture of their hand, and the AI could analyze their palm and combine it with their star chart. I named it AstroBot.

The first time I ran it, I tested it on myself. It analyzed my palm, cross-referenced my birth chart, and spit out this: *“You’re afraid of failure, but your greatest fear is being forgotten.”*

I swear I got chills reading that. Because it was true. I don’t know if it’s the kind of thing that’s true for everyone, but in that moment, it felt like it had *seen* me.

I didn’t tell Jasmine about it right away. Part of me was worried it wouldn’t impress her, and another part of me was nervous it’d freak her out. But I kept testing it, refining it, feeding it more data. And then, last week, it said something I can’t stop thinking about. 

I asked it a generic question—*“What do the stars say about my future?”*—and it replied, *“You will lose her.”*

I tried again, asking a different way: *“What’s going to happen with Jasmine?”*

It responded immediately: *“A dramatic change will sever your bond. It is unavoidable.”*

Unavoidable. Like it wasn’t a guess. Like it *knew.*

I laughed it off at the time. Told myself it was just an algorithm predicting generic outcomes. But now… I don’t know. I haven’t told Jasmine about the AI yet, and I don’t know if I should. Part of me thinks she’d love it. The other part worries she’d hate what it’s already said.

Do you guys think I’m overthinking it? It’s just a program, right? There’s no way it’s actually telling the future.

Let me know what you think! Should I tell her about AstroBot, or just keep it to myself? If anyone here knows more about astrology or AI, I’d love to hear your thoughts.

Astrology is fake, right?
