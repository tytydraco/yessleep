For privacy purposes I’m going to call the son Jon, Jon was a happy go lucky kid, grew up in a lower middle class family in the backwoods of Georgia. Jon was always fascinated with mechanics as his father Jake was a ASE certified Technician, 

so at the young age of 8, Jon started helping his father with side jobs he had at home to provide extra income for the family. Jon caught on very quickly and could bring his father any tool he asked for within the first couple months of helping. 

Fast forward to 13 years old Jon was a pro, He had the skills to do oil changes, brake jobs, rotors, starters, alternators, transmission replacements, to engine overhauls. His father was amazed by how far Jon had came in the past five years.

As time went by Jon was well on his way to being a certified mechanic himself, now in high school. Jon was a likable kid had average grades  but wasn’t too concerned with school work, as he knew what he already wanted to do for the rest of his life.

Jon worked after school day in and day out on side jobs of his own from classmates who wanted quality work done on there vehicles at a lower price than an established shop in town. 

Jon was busy everyday, even more busy than his father Jake who was laid off from the shop he worked for and side jobs were only coming in here an there. With Barely enough money to pay the bills Jake was starting to stress out.

Jakes wife Megan soon filed for divorce as Jake was well on his way to filing for bankruptcy and losing the house.  The fighting had just became too much, so Jon moved out an got his own place. He offered to help his parents but they declined not wanting to put there burden on their son. 

There was a tall creepy guy about 6’8 that started coming to see Jake on a regular base Jon noticed. The guy didn’t look or act normal always kept his face hidden and wore sunglasses. He had pale skin and unnatural long arms. They hung down to his knees standing with arms at his side.

Jon was tired of seeing his father struggle so they decided to open up a mechanic shop together mostly with Jons saved up money. Now 22 yrs old, things were a little better as business was coming in and Jake was able to save his house. 

The Creepy Guy, Karl was his name Jakes friend if you want to call him that came around with paperwork with policies and numbers on them. Jon was unaware what they had been discussing as he just assumed it was some other thing his father had going on. 

Things were going good, bills were getting paid  
And stress was brought to a minimum, but Jake started acting funny, he asked Jon if he could take an insurance policy out on him just for safety precautions he stated. Jon thought yeah why not your my Dad I trust you. 

Little did Jon know Jake had become jealous of his son and greed started to kick in, he was making plans behind his back with Karl to take out an insurance policy on Jon for an amount that would have him set for life if something were to happen to Jon. 

Jake had it all planned out a sinister plan, to have a truck they were working on fall on his son Jon and kill him, looking like an accident so he could then be set for life. Jake blamed Megan for Jon anyway, as Jake really never wanted to have a child. 

Jake kept this to himself all these years and even though everything was going good with himself and his son. Jake felt the time was now. Jake set the car up on broken jack stands that were worn out, called Jon out to crawl under the vehicle to do a simple oil change. 

This is when the evil in Jake came out, he shook the car with Jon under it, Jon yelling “what are you doing”, then in a split second the jack stands gave in and dropped the truck crushing Jon. He died immediately laying lifeless under the car crushed. 

Jake acting innocent made the 911 call to make it seem like an accident. Paramedics arrived and Jons whole upper half of his body was crushed with a wrench still in his hand. All he had done for his father, an greed took over turning Jake into a monster. 

After the funeral Karl came by Jakes with a sinister smile. Great Work Karl said, you sold your sons soul to live wealthy without worry. Karl was an insurance fraud specialist that convinced Jake to go through with this plan that would have him set for life. 

Jake having already lost his wife felt at ease about losing his son as well. Thought he would get money and start all over with a new family. Being 54 years old he thought he had to act fast and Karl’s convincing played a huge part in that. 

After showing no signs of grief and spending money lavishly, living it up with his new beautiful younger wife. Investigators felt the need to look a little closer into the death of Jon. 

They had surveillance teams keeping an eye on Jake, as they had found out just days previous to Jons death that Jake took out two Major life insurance policies on his son. 

They brought him in for questioning, and forced a lie detector test to prove his innocence. Jake complied as he said it was an accident. He had nothing to hide or so he thought. 

The results came back and sure enough none of his story had added up, Jake felt the guilt building up and finally confessed to what he had done. Jake didn’t mention Karl so he remained a free man. Jake on the other hand was charged with premeditated murder, 2 counts of insurance fraud. Jake hired a good lawyer but was still found guilty at trial and sentenced to spend the rest of the remainder of his life in prison. 

This was a true story with fictional names and location but just goes to show that No amount of money should ever replace any family member whether hated or not. Greed and money go hand an hand of being the root of all evil.  Thoughts? Comments?
