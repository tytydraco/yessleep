They warned me that there might be some problems with impulse control.  And that they were not really sure when I could, or should, expect a return to full cognitive function.

So, I mostly stayed in my little Brooklyn apartment, trying to keep myself occupied as I experienced auditory hallucinations.

The hallucinations were friendly and mostly told me the cops were coming, my wife, Vera, wanted to hurt me, and that sanity was just around the corner.

Thanks to legal weed and listening to Eminem playlists I was able to more or less keep myself from going completely over the edge, but due to the aftermath of severe head trauma, I was now grappling with fun stuff like migraines, seizures, ADHD and best of all; a touch of Turrets.

Motherfucker!

Why was I drag racing on crystal meth you ask? 

Fair question. 

Sounds good at the time but they will forget you, leaders of the pack. Moral of the story is you can't ever impress narcissistic chicks. NOT really, no.

The aftermath of a car wreck and one insult to injury beatdown left me in and out of the valley of the shadow of death and beyond the valley of the dolls for a month at the ICU.

Eventually, I was released to Vera and thus began my journey to madness. It's not all bad, though.

Surr, there's the petit-mal seizures and randomly seeing Em jumping out of walls and rapping to me that I should cut Vera out of my will, yo, and divorce that scheming-

So, like I said, or meant to, when I was lucid last Thursday and watching shorts about how they handle infected cow and horse hooves by using these Spanish Inquisition looking sharp ass curly knives to pare away the hoof, layer by horny layer.

Like mining for a vein of gold the skilled hoofsmith finally cuts away the last layer. A geyser of putrid pus and blood erupt, pulsating spastically as a cuckold heart.

 So when I saw the ad for these Pookiémon creepy Crawlies, with their cute little Manga anime Japanese faces, well, I just could hear them sing-songing, "We just wanna make your Hard Knock Life and Damaged Head some kind of pookie smookie wonderful."

 I moved my mouse to add to cart and ordered the Luxe Pookie Pod Party Pack. It had all the pookies, their sweet face telling me promises of a magnificent manga miracle saving me from my enemies. 

Two Days Later they came. I didn't even care I had an aneurysm kind of sensation going on and saw Eminem briefly look in my fridge disgustedly. Then Em was gone and the box was open.

They weren't lying like no rug in the ad, this was my new family. My golden retriever,  Mel, had died protecting me from the bat wielding maniac who finished the job my drag racing engine started.

Dogless, married to Vera, and knowing she was three timing me with identical twins Neil and Bob across the street was no help either.

Em once said, "Yo. Better forget them dishes, Aloyisius! Bob and Neil, they might be trouble. This shit could pop like double bubble."

Vera kept finding excuses to visit them. Cup of sugar. Eye of newt. 

"I need a break from you, Al."

How those words stung. But Setsuko Pookiémon jumped up on my left shoulder right out of the Amazin box from Pookiémon Shipping Center. The box smelled vaguely of almonds. 

"Vera's not trustworthy Al, pal. She's been thinking about that fat life insurance policy while Neil and Bob are filling her head with crystal meth. Hai!"

More Pookiémons popped and hopped like Mexican jumping beans with purpose.  

Within moments all 12 from the Pookiémon Glam-Fam Grow Pod were lounging on my head, shoulders,  lap and one little fellow jumped from my shoulder until his tiny lips reached my ear.

"Tonight, Al. There's gonna be a home invasion. Maybe 3am. They wanna make you sleep the big sleep Al. 

The swinging kitchen doors parted and Em said. "Yo, see that Pookiémon Creeper, the one on your monitor? That's Skinny Pook. You listen up and hear him out. I got to jet."

The doors swung shut. Em was gone. I could no longer feel his presence. I felt some blood trickle out my nose.

I heard the little creep clear his throat, then say:

At 3am in the morning 
Vera's not yawning 
Instead she's spawning 
A nefarious plot
To get all that you got
Sleeping high on pot 
You will be shot

Now Pookiémon fam will allow this; NOT
Pookiémon is here to thwart this 
This insidious bitch
Who wants to be rich 
She must make love in a ditch
but no we cannot snitch
So here's what we'll do....

All the little creepers started whispering in my ears. At first it was a cacophony. But as I bled more and began to seize I suddenly heard, no felt, their voices become one as deus ex Pookiémon Creepers.

The creepers then told me what I had to do. 

I nodded.

And suddenly,  the pain was gone and so would be my double troubles too. The only question I had left was how did Clint Pookiémon know where I kept the rope?
