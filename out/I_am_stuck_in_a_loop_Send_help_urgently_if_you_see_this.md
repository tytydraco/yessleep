I will try to keep it short! Or maybe not. Please be patient!

My days are in loop. Not sure how this happened but it's never ending. I am preparing for competitive exams --- yk the kind where you give this exam, interview blah blah blah and if you end up getting satisfactory marks, you go to college. Yeah that's about it. 

But here's the thing. My exams are 80 days away. I am essentially trying to get into med school so more confusing stuff and lots to learn. I wake up, I am not sure how many days has it been atp but I wake up to my mom screaming at my face, "I am convinced you're planning to leech off us all our lives. Have some shame. You're a girl and we are investing sm even though others are advising us not to. And this is how our kindness gets paid in return? My patience is running low and if I don't see you up on your feet in a min, this jug of water will be splashed onto your face." This happens EVERY FUCKING DAY. 

EVERY SINGLE DAY
EVERY SINGLE DAY
EVERY SINGLE DAY

I WAKE UP TO MY MOM SCREAMING TO ME THE SAME THING EVERY SINGLE DAY. 

No change in speech or whatsoever.

I unlock my phone, look at the homescreen--- displays FEBRUARY 15, 2025. 8:00 AM.
but I don't believe this. NO SOMETHING IS TERRIBLY WRONG. My boyfriend (well ex now?) dumped me right after Valentines Day. I remember crying over it for days, grieving over our shared past and envisioned future. He left me. It's alright. Studies are more important anyway. 

OR SO I THOUGHT. Until I am not sure what and when it went wrong. Every day I wake up to my mom screaming at my face, him texting me "I thought about this for a long time and I think we don't have a future together" but I am pretty sure it's been days since we last talked or had a real conversation so why does he keep texting me that? I didn't realise it at first, the continuous text screwed up my mind. Annoyed, I blocked him. But the texts never stopped. 

Thinking he was having a hard time evidently, I tried to send him some consolation at first cuz I knew this wouldn't work out no matter how much I tried. But here's the catch! The message doesn't get sent. It keeps showing a small red cross beside it with a resend option. I kept tapping on it until eventually the app shutdown "There's an issue with xxx application. Please be patient while we quickly fix this." That's it. I tried contacting consumer support but my complaints there doesn't get sent either. It's frustrating and I admit I almost slammed my only phone I owned. The next day, the same thing. The next next day, the same same thing. 

Convinced, maybe this is him playing a cruel prank, I blocked him. I was almost losing my sanity. But the text was back again the next day. I asked my mom sneakily if she went through my phone and unblocked some "friend" well "by mistake" yk. She looks me straight in the eye and goes, "Stop chatting with your damn friends. You hv your exams hovering over your head in 80 days, for god's sake. You're such a disgrace to our ancestors." The usual, nothing surprising. As if the texts weren't nerve wrecking, her screaming to wake me up and when I ask for smth, being slammed down with the same "80 days left" argument messed up my mind. 

Wait 80 days? That's when it clicked my mind. Before, I didn't bother checking my calendar or being updated with time and stuff. I would wake up, stuff down cereals or oats whatever I would find in the cabinets, slump over my desk, dream irrelevant stuff wasting my time, begrudgingly start revising till lunch, eat and repeat the same till dinner and then surrender myself to my drooping eyes. This was a loop but now it's real.

"Hmm, 80 days is weird. It's been days since she's screaming the same stuff. Man, isn't she tired? Might as well change the dialogue yk for a fresh beginning." My inner monologue would race with thoughts. The texts from ex were irritating and oh, I couldn't text anyone else either. I discovered this when I tried asking one of my friends for notes. There was a class I missed ages ago and it has finally come to bite me in the butt especially when I thought it wasn't of significance...welp I hv to study by myself now. Although the internet is fine as it seems but extremely slow, not like it bothers me. I don't own any social media, disabled my IDs when I started my prep so I hv no idea if there's an economic breakdown or smth? Or an alien invasion? There's no way to contact my friends. Tried calling but my phone would shut down. Switched it back on but the same thing all over again.

Initially I chalked it up as mom messing with router or installing some shady stuff to stop me from "distraction" as she likes to quote until it wasn't. Bored as hell, I decided to take a quick trip to a nearby street or shop whatever I felt like it. Checked my whole house, couldn't find mom. Weird. But okay. Perhaps she went somewhere and didn't tell me as she didn't want to bother me. Alright I will be quick anyways. The sky was abnormally blue, way too blue, as if you kept looking at it, it would blind you. Hauntingly blue. "Heh nice weather these days, it seems." Too much quiet. No sounds. Didn't realise it at first but why is there no sound at all? I tried speaking but I couldn't hear myself wtf. Okay maybe my ears are blocked or idk some weird shit. And why are the streets so empty??? Umm smth's amiss here, back to home I guess. Mom isn't here yet. Uh okay. I will js study, who cares? "Lunch time!" I hear mom calling. 

Wow finally. Relieved, I step out of my room but mom's already locked in her room as always. She's so quick, huh? Does she not want to see me anymore or smth? Disappointed, I pick at my rice and sides of spinach salad. Disgusting but I gobble down anyways. Cereals are better than this. It's been days since we went shopping. How come the cereal's not over? Thoughts plague over me. I put my spoon down and creep near kitchen shelves. No empty boxes??? How? I never skip breakfast and the newly opened box third fourths fulls peaked my curiosity but maybe js maybe mom's filling it up everyday so I don't get worried over nothing? That's when I hear a mumbling "Distraction." Caught aback, I tip toe back to my room. Lock it up and inch an ear near to my door. I knew it then. Nah everything is wrong and nothing else can convince me otherwise. Wait...I hear slight steps. But there's no knock on my door? After what passed to be over 10 minutes, confused I peak from the gap near the hinges.

FUCKKKK. I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

I see my mom, her head twisted at a weird angle peeking under the door. Is that even humanly possible? OH SHIT. Did she see my feet? No but I don't think I can cross over and go to my desk anymore or she will know. She will definitely know or maybe she already knows?? I stayed there crouched in a small space, my legs aching from hours in the same position and my bladder threatening to burst with all the water I drank before being stuck. 

I think it was about 8 hours later after which she finally stood up. Calling for me, "Dinner is ready" js after a minute. But she never cooked dinner, did she? I shift my chairs to make a sound of me getting up and unlock my doors, she's gone. Thank God. Her bedroom's locked. Dinner consisted of pasta, warm and delicious. How's that even possible? Is this edible? Safe to eat even? I doubt it's food but it looks like pasta though? I take a few bites before submitting to my room and oh, not forgetting to visit the washroom real quick. Alright seems like she's already sleeping since I can hear soft snores. I was praying hard that all of this is a dream or my mind playing games. Perhaps the stress is getting to me? No everything is wrong and I can't deny it for long, I was well aware. I switched on my dimmed lamps for sleep and slowched down on my bed, tossing and turning until sleep took over me. 

Except I kept the doors unlocked this time. I have to. It was a rule in my home to keep the doors unlocked when you sleep. Or my parents banged at our doors near midnight to force us to unlock the door and give them a reason for the unruly behaviour. Also it did help that mom would wake us up early so we got used to it. I forgot to mention, didn't I? My dad and siblings don't live with us currently due to personal reasons. Anyways, I was sleeping well until I woke up in goosebumps, sweaty all over. Couldn't figure out what was wrong but I knew smth was peeking from the gap in the door left ajar. I tried shrugging it off and pulled my blanket all over my head, moaned unsuspecting words as if I was in deep sleep. I hear breathing. Cold deep breaths near my head. My blanket slid off a bit. So I could feel the shivering breaths as if I was in Alaska or smth. Weird grumbling and groaning and the footsteps went away. Thank God. I hv no idea how I fell asleep after that. Wish it was a long dream and when I wake up everything will be okay?

I wake up to my mom screaming, " I am convinced you're planning to leech off us all our lives. Have some shame. You're a girl and we are investing sm even though others are advising us not to. And this is how our kindness gets paid in return? My patience is running low and if I don't see you up on your feet in a min, this jug of water will be splashed onto your face." She's in front of my face. Ngl she looks uncanny, dark circles looming under her eyes, haggard as if she hasn't slept in days (maybe she didn't actually). Tbh I wouldn't hv noticed this stuff normally, had it been for not the incident yesterday. I pretend to be groggy and she goes out, Finally!!! Checked my phone, same text, hmm.

"I thought about this for a long time and I think we don't have a future together." Okay sure. There's no future, you're correct. Since the day keeps repeating. February 15, 2025. 8:00 AM.

Shower essentials never seem to finish no matter how much I use them. Hit the tap close and I hear,"DO YOUR BREAKFAST!" 
Cereal boxes three fourths full, okay fine. Front poarch, faint rustling of newspapers, mom yeah (atleast she's not spying on me, mornings are the only time she doesn't, I guess). Asked my mom about the text trying to be sly during breakfast.  She goes off on another screaming slot, "Stop chatting with your damn friends. You hv your exams hovering over your head in 80 days, for god's sake. You're such a disgrace to our ancestors." The repeat, huh. 

I agree I might seem nonchalant but I am not sure why I feel so calm? Maybe I am getting used to it afterall. Except for mom's weird antics or well...hobbies, I feel fine. Bland day but I don't hv to worry about the exams anymore cuz they will never come. I figured it out, it's a loop. I probably realised it sooner than I would like to admit. I think it was the repeating texts or the same food, or.... mom's same dialogue everyday idk but everything is fine, right? I am okay. I think so. I don't remember why I am writing this ermm the cereals taste weird but I think it's okay. Why am I posting this? Umm I don't really know but it's okay. Uhh anyways, yeah Everything is okay. I should stop getting distracted so easily. I am imagining things. I should study. Yeah right, everything is fine.

I think she knows...they know. Who knows? I am not sure but everything is okay tho.
