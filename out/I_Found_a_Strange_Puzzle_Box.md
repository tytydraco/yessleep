I always liked Antique shops. Niche little decorations made up 80% of the shelves, but there would be times when people leave truly extraordinary items. I’ve gotten 200$ lamps for pocket change, rare collector items and even hundred-year-old heirlooms. My biggest find however was a small purple puzzle box, shifting dark purple panels and decorations of eyes made me think it may have been from a circus or traveling caravan.

The old lady behind the desk said that she had never seen it before, but it wasn’t uncommon for people to leave strange things just lying on the shelf. She told me that it would be mine for just five dollars. I handed over the paper and walked out with my new toy. I wanted to know if there was still anything inside or if someone had just pawned off an empty box on a poor old lady. The shifting panels puzzle was a bit more difficult to solve than I had thought, no combination seemed to work, no foreseeable algorithm.

By the time I decided to call it quits and try again later I had saw that three hours had gone by. No way, I spent maybe 30 minutes on that puzzle, my clock must have been wrong. It was dark so I got a night snack and went to bed after doom-scrolling on my phone. In my dream I am attempting to unlock the puzzle box and the room gets darker and darker. I don’t know why I woke up with such a profound sense of dread.

As I walked into my apartment living room I saw it on the table, it almost seemed to be challenging me. It was too early for this; I grabbed a coffee and made my way to another mundane day of stocking shelves at the dollar store. The whole day of work; my mind was consumed with thoughts of the box. My mind was feeding me images of grand rewards, as though within that box were the secrets of the universe or riches abound.

When I got home, I had my after-work smoke and then began once more to delve into the boxes secretes, this time I actually had an easier time and managed to get one of the panels to lock into place; that’s when I heard a soft whisper.

“Are they stars or eyes that watch from the dark void?”

I looked around pulled out of my stupor by the idea of an intruder. When I looked outside, I saw the metallic blue dawn sky over the world illuminating the ground below as birds sang.

I had spent all night just getting that one panel done and there were still numerous more to go. How did I spend so long on it? Who was that voice? When I came to, I found that I was starving and really had to use the bathroom, I had the day off, so after bathroom use and eating breakfast, I decided to take a nap.

In this dream I was holding the box and about to put in the final mechanism when a large tendril of sorts sprang from the box and grabbed my throat pulling me into the puzzle box. That’s when I awoke in a cold sweat, the clock read 3:00pm.

This damn box was becoming more trouble than it was worth. I should have thrown it away or given it back to the lady, but then I noticed something; recalling the last time I tried and managed to get one right I think I’ve cracked some kind of algorithm. I sat down and began again, this time I set an alarm for one hour. I began working again, and as soon as I was about to put the second panel into place, I heard the alarm ring.

I turned it off and looked back at the box. I was about to complete the Panel but forgot the combination, the damn alarm broke my focus. I went back to work on it forgetting to set an alarm and worked for two hours to get to the second panel; I then heard another whisper, breathy and echoed.

“What happens when the dream awakes and the dreamer fades into oblivion?”

What were these whispers? Were they clues? I didn’t even sleep, and yet I had another vision. This one was a daydream about a city. I was looking at it over the cliffside, a city made of golden architecture, spires and buildings making up the bulk of the land surface. When I looked down, I saw What I think were people. They had a tall slender appearance; pale white faces and stick-like appendages to make the bulk of their body. They almost looked like a 3^(rd) grader drawing of a human. That’s when the sky went dark and a great hole tore in the fabric of space, something colossal grinned from the other side and I woke up paralyzed and on the couch.

I don’t know how long I sat there but when I looked out the window, it was dark. I almost completely lost track of time at this point, I rarely eat, but I will continue to persist with this box because I believe the prize is knowledge about the unknown. Our origins, our Place in the Universe and if we are alone or not. If I don’t write about this subject again, It means I never solved the box or perished in doing so.
