Jack was behind me, one step down the narrow staircase. The sun was high in the cloudless sky, and the smell of the garbage by the door filled my nose. The door opened and there was Rachel, bright-eyed and smiling. She invited us in.

It was a small, three storey house on an estate near the primary school. We walked into the living room and sat down on a couch. The three of us drank coffee and talked for a while about all the things that’d changed in the last several years. Rachel was now married; she had an eight-year-old daughter and was working part-time behind the counter of a service station a few streets away.

We soon ran out of small talk and I knew it was time to tell her about the real reason we were in town. I was considering how to bring it up without sounding like a conspiracy theorist, when Jack went ahead and beat me to it. He told her all about his social work and the case files and the lack of investigation. He said we were down here to find information about any of the missing children, and asked if she knew about anyone who had gone missing.

Earlier that morning, I called up my sister. She’s a few years younger than me, and after hearing the kid in the park the previous night, I had to learn more. I asked her, when she’d been at school in the years below me, if she’d ever heard about the Gnawbone.

It turned out she had. In fact my question came as quite a surprise to her.

“Doesn’t everyone know that old story?”

Apparently, in the years after we first heard of and went looking for the Gnawbone, it had become the most popular ghost story for kids to tell each other in the lower years. She told me the kids all used to talk about it for a while at that age, but it was generally forgotten about in the later years.

One particular memory that it brought back for my sister is a rumour she heard around age ten or eleven. One of the girls from the other school across town had supposedly disappeared and was never seen at school again. The reason, her classmates decided, was the Gnawbone. It had taken her away into the woods to eat her.

My sister said she never really believed it herself, I guess I was the only one in our family who would’ve at the time. She never did forget it though.

And then, a couple of hours later in Rachel’s living room, her eight-year-old daughter Sarah peeked her head around the doorway to the living room.

“Are you talking about Tracey?” She asked.

Rachel walked over to shoo her out of the room, but before she could, Jack said “Did you know Tracey?”

She was one of the kids he had found out about.

Sarah nodded. “I haven’t seen her since last year,” She said, “The teachers all say she moved but she didn’t say goodbye.”

Rachel just stood there looking stunned that her daughter knew someone who could’ve gone missing under suspicious circumstances. I can’t say I blame her. Jack kept on talking though, worried her mother would soon stop his questioning.

“Did Tracey ever hang out with anyone older than her?” He asked.

Sarah shook her head. “No. The other kids say something else though.”

“What do they say?” Said Jack.

“That the Gnawbone got her.”

Jack excused himself and we stepped out the front door before Rachel could process what had just happened. We walked across the street to where we parked the car. I turned the key in the ignition and pulled away onto the road. We both knew where we had to look next.

We pulled up a few minutes later by the path down Landing Lane. It was midday and it was quiet. Jack stepped out of the car and I followed suit.

“Do you think we’ll be able to find the asylum again?” Said Jack.

“Maybe, it was pretty deep in the woods. I don’t exactly remember the way,” I said.

We walked up the path and turned off down the trail to the river.

“Do you really believe it?” I asked, “I mean, that there’s a creature called the Gnawbone out here?”

“I don’t know,” Jack replied, “But I get the feeling the stories stuck around for a reason.”

The two of us followed the trail across the bridge, and turned left toward the old weir we hadn’t seen in thirteen years. It looked no different than it did back then, water trickling down the cracked concrete, between piles of twigs and dead leaves. We walked on past and into the treeline.

The woods were calm and still, no birds singing or breeze drifting through the branches. All I could hear was the sound of my footsteps over the dirt trail in time with Jack’s just ahead of me. We plodded through the woods for minute after long minute until we came to a patch Jack thought looked familiar. I wasn’t so sure, but we left the path and shoved our way through the overgrown brush.

After a long time spent tangled in long and sharp trees, we didn’t seem to be getting anywhere. We were going in a straight line, at least I thought we were, but even then, we were only kids when we came through the first time. We could easily have been going around in circles and been none the wiser.

“Are you sure this is right?” I asked Jack.

“Of course not,” He replied, “It seemed like the best shot though.”

“Maybe we should go another direction?”

We changed our heading and pushed on through endless leaves and branches, the sunlight trickling down from above not revealing much of anything. Then I heard Jack up ahead.

“Hey, I think I found it!”

I crouched under a low branch and found myself in the clearing with the row of pine trees, just how I remembered from our last trip.

“Wow, it really wasn’t a dream then,” I said.

We walked up the road and long the line of trees. I didn’t really know what to expect when we’d finally get there, or what kind of answers the old building might hold. Whatever we’d find though, I was sure would be the key to our mystery. Then I saw it, looming over the path like a shadow.

The abandoned asylum looked no different to how I remembered it. The cracked ceiling tiles and the layers of moss and the shattered windows seemed exactly as we had left them. Except for one tiny detail. Someone had written in spray paint the words: *The Pleasure Room* above the doorway.

“Was that always there?” Said Jack.

“I don’t think so,” I said.

Since there were no obvious signs of life, we walked up the steps and pushed the door open. It creaked, creaked, creaked open, the sound echoing in the room beyond. I peered through the widening gap and saw the same empty reception with the wooden desk built in to the corner. Jack and I stepped inside.

We walked up the staircase at the back of the room, having decided to start in the place we knew best. Coming out at the top, we stepped into the ward with the lines of hospital beds in either direction. I turned right, and stopped almost immediately. There again was the graffitied poem that scared us as kids.

*I walk the trees, night by night*

*I know each one by name and sight*

*I find the children all alone*

*And rip and tear and gnaw the bones*

“I’d forgotten what it said exactly,” I said, “No wonder it scared us.”

“Yeah, there must have been some messed up teenagers back then,” Said Jack.

“I hope so,” I said.

“Hey that must’ve been where the name came from, ‘*gnaw the bones’*,” Said Jack.

We turned away and paced the room looking for anything else of interest. Paint was peeling from the walls and shards of glass lay in small puddles where the afternoon sun entered. We walked past rusty hospital beds until one of them caught both of our attention at once. Jack and I rushed over to it. On each side, attached to the metal, were a pair of handcuffs.

“What the hell…?” Said Jack.

The dots were joining together for us now. The painted signs on both this building and the train cars, coupled with this was too much to brush off as nothing.

“What do we do now?” I said, “Tell the police about all this?”

“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Said Jack.

“Why not? You really think this is some kind of cover up?” I said.

“That’s what it looks like to me,” Said Jack.

“So what else do we do?”

“I don’t know, maybe someone out of town?”

“Maybe,” I said, “But we need more to give them, right? How do we know these weren’t here thirteen years ago?”

“I don’t remember them,” Said Jack.

“Maybe we should try Roger? He might remember if we don’t.”

“Alright, it’s a start, I guess. His old number doesn’t work anymore though.”

We walked through every other room with an eagle eye, but we didn’t find anything else of interest. Having taken photos of the graffiti and the handcuffs, we left the building and stumbled our way through the woods until we eventually made it back to the car. As I drove back to my bed and breakfast, Jack scoured the internet on his phone to find a way of contacting Roger.

“I can’t find him anywhere, no social media at all,” Said Jack.

“Anyone else who might know him?” I asked.

Jack kept on searching.

“I’ve found his dad’s business number, I could try that,” He said.

I looked across at the clock on the dashboard. It was before five.

“Try it,” I said, silently praying. Having another person helping would be a big improvement.

Jack dialled and it rang forever, but eventually someone picked up and answered. Jack didn’t spend long speaking to him, and from what I heard it didn’t go as I was hoping. Jack took the phone away from his ear and sat in silence.

“What is it? What did he say?” I said.

“He invited us to go and meet them,” Said Jack.

“Okay,” I said, “Maybe they just want us to meet in person.”

“I just realised something,” Said Jack.

“What?”

“You remember that toy giraffe we found? In the train cars?”

“Yeah?”

“Roger had one just like it.”
