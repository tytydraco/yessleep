It’s Hiroshi Nakamura again. My last post was four days ago. Four nights have passed since then, each one darker, longer, and more suffocating than the last. The days blend into one another, each longer and quieter than the last. Writing has become my way of keeping track of time, of tethering myself to some sense of reality. But even that feels like it’s slipping away.

The food is almost gone. Two dented cans mock me from the shelf, their rusted edges a cruel reminder of how little stands between me and starvation. The rain hasn’t come in over a week, and the water I managed to collect is almost dry. I’ve been rationing carefully, but no amount of planning can change the fact that I’m running out. My stomach aches constantly, a low reminder of how fragile my body has become. And yet, it’s the nights that scare me most.

The silence during the day is unnatural, as though the world itself is holding its breath. But when the sun sets, the sounds return. Scratching at the door. Wet, dragging noises in the hallway. Sometimes I hear whispers, faint and indistinct, coming from the pipes or the walls. Once, I thought I heard my name. I’ve learned not to investigate. Whatever is making those noises, I don’t want to meet it.

Last night, the terror escalated. The scratching became pounding slow, deliberate, and impossibly heavy, as if whatever was outside wanted me to know it wasn’t going to stop. I swear I saw the doorframe shudder with each hit. I sat frozen, clutching the knife, the dim light from my flashlight casting jagged shadows that seemed to move on their own. Then came the smell a sickly, metallic odor that seeped under the door and clung to the air. It made my stomach turn, and for a moment, I thought I’d pass out. Whatever was outside wasn’t human. I’m certain of that now.

The apartment feels like it’s shrinking, the silence pressing in from all sides, heavy and oppressive. It’s as though the walls themselves are alive, watching, waiting. There are traces of her everywhere the chair by the window, the tea cups she cherished, even the faint scent of her perfume in the bedroom. But at night, those traces feel wrong. The chair’s silhouette seems to shift, as if something unseen has taken her place. The bedroom door creaks open on its own, revealing nothing but darkness. And the perfume… it’s stronger now, almost overpowering, as if trying to smother me.

I can’t stay here. Not anymore. But the thought of leaving terrifies me just as much as staying.

The internet flickers on and off, an unreliable lifeline that I cling to out of desperation. I’ve been refreshing forums, looking for answers, for anything that might help. Most posts are fragmented, desperate. A man in Osaka wrote about his brother walking into the ocean after drinking tap water. A woman in Sendai described black tendrils slithering out of a storm drain after heavy rain. No one seems to know what’s happening, and the official news channels remain silent. The world is unraveling, and we’re all just grasping at threads.

Two days ago, someone posted about a military convoy near Chiba. They said the soldiers were rounding up survivors, taking them to a quarantine zone. Or so they claimed. No one has heard from those who were taken. Are they being protected? Or silenced? I don’t know what to believe, but it’s the only lead I have.

I’ve started preparing. A flashlight, some batteries, what little food and water I have left. A rusted kitchen knife I found in the drawer. It’s not much, but it’s better than nothing. The walls feel like they’re closing in. The air is heavier, thick with a tension I can’t explain. Last night, something scratched at the door. It wasn’t human.

And then came the footsteps. Slow, deliberate, impossibly heavy. They circled the door like a predator toying with its prey. I heard a voice, low and guttural, speaking words I couldn’t understand. It wasn’t speaking to me. It was speaking to *something else*. The pounding started again, more frantic this time, and then it stopped. I waited for hours, knife in hand, but the silence that followed was somehow worse.

I’m writing this now because I don’t know if I’ll survive another night. Each sound, each shadow feels like the prelude to something I can’t face. Tomorrow, I’ll have to make a decision. Stay or leave. But as I write, the sounds outside are getting louder. Scraping, dragging, something wet slapping against the walls. It’s closer than ever before. I can’t tell if it’s the building settling or something trying to get in.

I feel trapped, and I don’t know what to do…
