**Before You Read**  
I debated even uploading this. It's not a story. It's not a warning. It's a record. Something I started writing down after the first time I saw one of *them.* I didn’t write it expecting anyone to believe me. Hell, I didn’t believe it myself for a while. But I think this might be bigger than me. Bigger than one bad store in Texas. If you’ve seen something like this—anything strange, anything off—I need to know. Because I don’t think I’m the only one anymore.

What follows are excerpts from the journal I’ve been keeping since it started. I’ve edited out some personal details, but otherwise, it’s all here. Read it. Don’t read it. Just… be careful what you notice. Once you know to look, they know to look for you.

**ENTRY 1**  
It started in Texas. I was visiting a friend, killing time at a local Dollar General while they ran errands. I can’t even remember what I was trying to get—batteries, maybe. Whatever it was, they didn’t have it.

At the register, I made some offhand complaint about having to go to the big store now. That’s when the cashier—older woman, name tag upside down—said something strange.

"There’s another DG down the road, if you know to look for it."

Then she mumbled something else and changed the subject like she hadn’t said anything at all. I should have let it go. Should’ve laughed it off. But I didn’t. I drove down the road.

And there it was. Another DG. Same yellow sign. Same squat beige building. But different.

The lot was empty but spotless. No trash. No gum on the sidewalk. The windows were crystal clear. I figured it was new.

I went in.

Everything was perfectly in place. Like a catalog. Every label faced forward. No broken bags, no scuffed tile. Just... immaculate. And quiet. Dead quiet. There were a few shoppers, but they didn’t act right. They moved slow. Deliberate. One guy picked up a bottle of dish soap, examined it like it was alien, then carefully put it back—but crooked. Then he stared at it and adjusted it. Like he’d broken some rule.

They all kept side-eyeing me. The cashier never spoke. Just watched me.

I told him I forgot my wallet and walked out.

The air outside felt brighter. Harsher. When I drove past later, just to confirm, the building was gone.

Just an empty lot with a rusted fence and a “For Lease” sign.

I should have never gone into that damn store.

**ENTRY 2**  
I keep thinking back to that cashier in Texas. Her words were throwaway at the time. "There's another DG down the road, if you know to look for it." She barely looked at me when she said it. Changed the subject right after. It was a shrug of a moment—one I would've forgotten, if I hadn't driven down that road and seen it.

I tell myself I shouldn't have gone in. But I did. And now I see them.

Not just the DGs. Other ones. They're everywhere. Or maybe they've always been. Maybe they're just now showing themselves because I know to look.

**ENTRY 4**  
Passed a gas station on Route 60 today. Thought it was abandoned. Pulled over to piss.

It wasn't empty. Not exactly.

The pumps were new. Spotless. No logo, no brand, just matte black with digital readouts that never changed. The station itself had one flickering neon letter: an "R" that didn't match any brand I've seen. Through the windows, I could make out aisles, coolers, even a guy behind the counter. But they never moved.

I waited five minutes.

They never moved.

I got back in the car. Didn't look back. But I could feel it. Like it was watching. Like it knew I'd seen it.

**ENTRY 7**  
Made a list today. Just to keep track. Not the normal world stuff—the other ones. The stores that shouldn't be there. The places that feel too still.

* DG #2 (Texas)
* "R" Gas Station (Route 60)
* The Barbershop with no mirror (Nevada)
* Grocery outlet with 4 exits and no entrance (Kansas)
* Auto shop with no signage, but every car outside is the same make/model/year

I never go inside. Not anymore.

But I write them down. Because maybe someone else will see this someday. Maybe someone else is seeing them too.

God help them.

**ENTRY 12**  
There was a guy at the rest stop this morning. Leaning on the sink like he hadn't moved in hours. Looked up as I washed my hands and said, "Once you know to look, it doesn't stop, does it?"

I froze.

"You saw the DG, didn't you?" he said.

I didn't answer. I walked out. Didn't even dry my hands.

But it confirms something: I'm not the only one. And that scares the shit out of me.

**ENTRY 15**  
Dreamt about the store again. The original one.

But it wasn't the same. The aisles had changed. They were longer, endless. The lights buzzed like they were breathing. I kept turning corners, but everything was still organized like a perfect planogram—just infinite. The same few shoppers there, watching, moving, resetting items I touched. One whispered something. I couldn’t hear it, but it made my ears ring.

I woke up and my bedroom light was on.

I live alone.

**ENTRY 21**  
Sometimes I think about going back. Just to see. Just to confirm I didn't imagine it all.

But what if it lets me in again?

What if this time I can't leave?

**ENTRY 24**  
Found a family dollar with no roof. Sky just open and blue above the aisles. Nothing and no one inside, but I swear the air was warmer when I stood in the doorway. Like the store had breath. Like it had lungs.

I turned around. I keep turning around.

But one day, I won’t.

**ENTRY 28**  
I met another one today. A woman. She was sitting outside a thrift shop with blacked-out windows. She looked at me and said:

"You can't save them. The ones that go in. It's not built for them to leave."

I asked her how many she’d seen.

She said, "Too many to count. But it's not the seeing that matters. It's the wanting. The stores call to those who need *something*. Doesn't matter what. They offer the shape of what you want, just wrong enough to trap you."

I asked her if she ever went inside.

She didn't answer.

**ENTRY 30**  
It’s not just stores. I think it’s spreading.

I passed a playground yesterday. Looked normal, but none of the swings moved, even in the wind. Kids were sitting on them, but not swinging. Not talking. Just holding the chains and staring forward.

I didn't stop. Didn't slow down. Just wrote it down.

The list grows longer.

**ENTRY 34**  
I know what the worst part is now.

It’s not the fear. It’s the curiosity.

Because every time I see a door with no handle, or a staircase that goes down farther than the building should allow, or a window with no reflection—

—I want to go in.

Just for a second. Just to *see*.

That's how it gets you.

That's how it got me the first time.

**ENTRY 38**  
I'm not writing this for myself anymore.

If you found this, and you’ve seen them too—don’t go back. Don’t follow them. Don’t let your mind start tracking the patterns. Don't make a list. Don’t *name* them.

Forget the doors. Forget the way the air changes. Forget the silence.

Because once you know to look...

They know to look for you.

**UPDATE**  
If you’ve seen anything like this—anything at all—message me. I don’t care if you think it’s fake. If you think it’s a dream. I just want to know I’m not alone.

And if you haven’t seen anything... then forget you ever read this.

Seriously.

Stop looking.
