I met my wife, Katelyn, when she was 20. I was 40. She was a singer in my band, and I was lead guitar. I guess it’s important to mention that I was also married when I met her. I was married for quite a while after I met her. Anyway, back to how we met. She was singing in random bars with another band when my friend, Mark, introduced us. He said she’d be the perfect fit for us, and boy was she. 

From the moment I laid eyes on her, I was hooked. It also didn’t help that my wife was never around. She never came to a show, so the main person I talked to was Katelyn. Hell, the only people I was close to were her, Mark, and the other guys in the band. She was just something special. 

About 5 years after meeting her, the band all started to gradually go our separate ways. She moved off to go to college, and I was still stuck in our dump of a town with a woman I didn’t love. Sure, Katelyn kept in touch, but communication got slimmer and slimmer until we didn’t speak at all. I still saw her in everything. Every good moment, bad moment, anything, I wished so badly I could tell her about it. She got some douchebag boyfriend and that was the end of it, or so I thought.

I’ll never forget it. It was a random Tuesday night in May. I was sitting in the living room watching God knows what with my wife. Just sitting in silence as usual, until the sound of my phone ringing ripped through the air. Nothing could prepare me for the name showing on my screen. 

“It’s work, I’ve got to take this,” I said to my wife walking out the door. 

“Kate?” I asked, as though it couldn’t possibly be her. “What’s up?”

That’s when I heard her crying. I don’t know why, but I panicked. “Katelyn, what’s wrong?”

She lost it. She explained in between sobs how she just wanted to die. She and her boyfriend had been split up for about 6 months, and she went downhill from there. There was nothing in the world that could make her want to stay. There was no one in the world who could love her. Her whole life was falling apart, and she was a constantly fighting the demons in her mind.

“Kate listen to me, and listen carefully. I love you. I have always loved you. You are worth loving, and you cannot do whatever it is you’re thinking about doing.”

“I know plenty of people love me, but I’m broken. I’ll never get married, have a family, anything,” she told me.

I took in a breath and explained to her carefully.

“I’m in love with you. This whole time. I never planned on telling you that. Ever. But you need to know that there’s someone who would be absolutely destroyed if you did anything to yourself.”

To put it simply, she said she loved me, too. We started meeting once a week, just to spend a few minutes together. Then, it turned into visits to her house 3 hours away. Sometimes I’d stay the night on “work trips”. She was always conflicted on the fact that I was married, but she wasn’t committed enough to me for me to have a reason to leave.

“Every morning, I reach over for you and you’re not there,” I’d tell her. “One day, I’m going to reach over, and you’ll be there. I’ll tell you ‘you’re not real’, but you’ll kiss me and tell me you are. That’s how it will be when we’re finally together.”

This affair went on for a year before she called me and told me to get my shit and come home. Within 6 months I was divorced and living with her. Another 6 months later, we were married. She was finally Mrs. Katelyn Hall.

I had all I’d ever wanted. It was everything I’d dreamed it would be. We’d stay up late watching movies, talking, laughing, loving each other. Every morning, I’d reach over and put my fingers in her hair. 

“You’re not real,” I’d tell her. Every single morning, and every single morning she’d kiss me, look at me with those beautiful brown eyes and say, “John, I’m real.”

Life was perfect, or so I thought.

Katelyn struggled with depression. She was on medication for it, and for the most part it was good, but one Sunday morning, something was off. Very off

I was running my fingers through that long blonde hair of hers. Just studying her face until she stirred awake.

“You’re not real,” I said smiling at her.

And for the first time in a year, she said nothing. She rolled out of bed and went to the bathroom. The only thing I heard that morning was her footsteps to the bathroom, a period of silence, then the bathtub faucet being turned on.

I had no idea what the fuck was going on. Sure, we fought from time to time, but hardly ever after we got married. I had done nothing to warrant the cold shoulder. 

I got up to make coffee and listened to silence. I guess she just needed to relax. Maybe she was getting depressed again. I could handle anything. I could help her through this if that was the case.

I had two cups of coffee while I watched the news. When I realized she wasn’t planning on coming out anytime soon, I walked to the bathroom door.

“Kate? Baby, I’m going to run to the store to get stuff to make us breakfast. Anything in particular you’d like?”

Nothing.

“Okay.. I’ll make pancakes unless you object.”

Nothing.

“Baby I don’t know what’s wrong, but whatever it is, we’ll figure it out. We always do. I’m going to give you some space. I’ll be back soon. I love you so much.”

Nothing.

I racked my brain the whole way to and from the grocery store. She had to be depressed. Maybe she had missed some of her medication? I didn’t know, but something wasn’t right.

When I got home, I sat the bags of groceries on the counter and walked to the bathroom door.

“Baby please talk to me.”

Nothing

“Katelyn you’re scaring me.”

Nothing.

I turned the door knob, but it was locked. 

“Katelyn! I’m going to break this door down. I’ve tried to be patient all morning, but you’re scaring me.” All I could think about was that phone call on a Tuesday in May a few years back.

Nothing again.

I rammed my shoulder in the door twice and it flew open.

What I saw was horrific.

She was in lying in the bathtub with her eyes partially open, but the water was bright red, and both arms had long vertical slits in them.

What happened next is a blur, but I know I could feel a faint pulse, and I called for an ambulance.

She laid on the gurney with a blanket over her in the ambulance. They were doing CPR, yelling out her vitals, pumping fluids into her. It was a nightmare of a scene. When we got to the hospital, they took her straight to the trauma unit. They kept me in the hallway as they tried desperately to revive her. About 15 minutes later, a man in a white coat stepped out of her room.

“Mr. Hall, I’m so sorry, but there was nothing we could do.”

The doctor’s voice rang in my ears and I slid down the wall.

I screamed, cried, flailed. They tried to calm me down but I couldn’t stopped freaking the fuck out. This is where everything got so much worse.

While my back was against the wall, they restrained me. I didn’t understand. The love of my life was dead, and they were restraining me. The next thing I know, a needle is in my arm, and I slowly fade into unconsciousness.

When I wake up, I’m in a blank white room, restrained to a bed. At this point I’m terrified and beyond confused, so I just start screaming.

“Wha the fuck did you do to me?!”

Nothing.

I screamed a few more times until a nurse came in. 

“John, it’s okay. You’re at Trenton Psychiatric Hospital. It’s 2024.”

“What? It’s 2025,” I said shakily, “My wife just killed herself, and you’re fucking with me?”

“John, Katelyn Samson killed herself May 10th, 2022. I know you’re confused, but you’re being taken care of. You just had a bad night.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?!”

And then it hit me.

It was Tuesday, May 10, 2022. I was sitting in the living room watching God knows what with my wife. Just sitting in silence as usual, until the sound of my phone ringing ripped through the air. 

It was Mark. He was probably high and just wanted to shoot the shit. I went to the bathroom to get some privacy. 

“Hey man, what’s up?”

“John. Katelyn shot her self in the head the morning.”

My blood ran completely cold.

“She left a note,” he told me. “Said she was doing the world a favor by being gone. That she couldn’t live life knowing someone could possibly love her.”

The woman I was madly in love with had killed herself not know how loved she was. If I had just told her, she’d probably still be alive. 

Mark went on to tell me he’d find out funeral arrangements, apologized because he knew how close we were, and got off the phone.

I was so numb and so heartbroken all at the same time. I ran a hot bath and sunk down into the tub. 

I had dreamt of this woman since the day I met her. I had never loved a would like I did her, and she was gone. My wife’s razor sat on the edge of the tub. I was able to break it open and retrieve a blade from it. I ran it up my left arm, then my right. As a my eyes got heavy, the last thing I heard was my wife screaming.

“John?” The nurse said touching my hand. “Are you remembering?” 

I looked up at her and nodded slowly.

“This happens sometimes. It’s good you’re remembering. Do you think we’re good to remove the restraints?” 

I nodded again.

She freed my arms and legs and left me to “rest” whatever that was supposed to mean. I looked around the room and the emptiness of the space. My mind was going 90 to nothing trying to catch up to time. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a figure, and turned sharply to my right. 

There she was, my beautiful blonde haired, brown eyed love of my life, smiling at me.

What she said next had me back in those goddamned restraints within minutes.

“John, I’m real.”
