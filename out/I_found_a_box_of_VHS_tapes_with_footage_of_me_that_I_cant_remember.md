In a world obsessed with digital streaming, 4K resolution, and algorithms recommending what you should watch next, I find comfort in the analog hum of a VHS tape. Working at a video rental store that's more of a living museum than a business, suits me perfectly. I'm Mike, a lonely guy in my late twenties who's found sanctuary in a dying industry.  
  
My day-to-day life is a calming blend of the mundane and the nostalgic. Sorting through movies, helping the occasional customer find a hidden gem or an old classic, and playing my favourite '80s flicks on the store's CRT TV sets the tone for most of my days. And I like it that way. It's a peaceful routine, the kind you can get lost in.  
  
So, imagine my intrigue when I arrive one morning to find a tattered cardboard box sitting right outside the store's entrance. It's the kind of box that's been used one too many times, its corners softened and its flaps barely holding together. I haul it inside, my curiosity piqued.   
  
I rip the tape off and open the box, revealing a disorganised pile of VHS tapes. No cases, just the tapes themselves with dates scribbled on them in black marker. 1987, 1991, 1993, they read. Each date sends tiny ripples of curiosity through me. Who would drop off a box of memories like this?  
  
I pop the first tape into one of the store's VCRs. It takes a moment for the image to stabilise, but soon enough, I'm looking at what seems to be an outdoor family gathering. Kids run around in giddy chaos—tag, hide and seek, the usual childhood rites. They're the centrepiece, these children, with voices of presumed parents giving commentary from behind the camera. There's laughter and cheering, but something's off. The voices sound overly enthusiastic, strained, as if trying to convey joy they don't actually feel.  
  
I can't put my finger on it, but a chill runs down my spine. Yet, I can't pull myself away. There's a magnetic discomfort in watching these tapes, like peering into a life that could've been mine but never was. No parents are ever shown; the camera never turns to capture a smile or a wave from them. They remain hidden, disembodied voices that fill the air with an eerie sense of unnatural happiness.  
  
A child runs up close to the camera, and for a moment, the screen is just a blur of colours. Then, the child moves back into focus, and the lens captures something—or someone—in the background. It's a shadowy figure, distant and indistinct, standing by a tree. My eyes narrow, trying to make out the details, but the tape cuts to another scene before I can comprehend what I'm looking at.  
  
I eject the tape and sit there for a minute, staring at the pile of VHS tapes still in the box. There are dozens more, each one potentially darker than the last. The hum of fluorescent lights and the distant roar of car engines fill the otherwise quiet store. I wonder if I should continue watching, part of me itching to delve deeper into this unsettling mystery that has landed literally at my doorstep.  
  
I shake off the hesitation, reminding myself that I thrive on stories, even if they're not neatly scripted Hollywood productions. Maybe especially if they're not. I reach for the next tape, my heart beating a touch faster than before.  
  
The question echoes in my mind: What am I about to uncover?  
  
I press 'play'.  
  
As I load another tape into the VCR, a sense of uneasy anticipation washes over me. The screen flickers to life, and I'm met with another scene of children playing, this time in a park. It's all so... ordinary. Kids climbing on jungle gyms, swinging on swings.   
  
Except it's not. Not really. Because as I scan the background, I find it again: that dark, blurry figure I'd seen before. It's still distant, standing among the trees as if watching over the scene, but there's something inherently disturbing about its presence. It's like a smudge on a painting, drawing my eye away from the beauty and light of childhood.  
  
With each subsequent tape, the figure gets closer, still just out of clear focus. And I'm becoming increasingly disturbed. Why am I doing this to myself? Why can't I just eject the tape, throw the whole box away, and pretend I never found it?  
  
Because I can't. Something won't let me. So instead, I watch. During breaks, after work, before bed—I even take some tapes home with me. I can't shake the feeling that I'm on the brink of discovering something momentous, something that may explain the unease that's settling deep within my bones.  
  
The laughter of the children, once so endearing, now grates on my nerves. It sounds wrong, like a record played at the wrong speed. And the parents' commentary—god, the parents. They're always there, but never seen, their voices growing more and more unnerving as I go through the tapes. Phrases like "Aren't they precious?" or "So full of life!" take on a menacing timbre that chills me to the core.  
  
By now, I've noticed that my own behaviour is shifting. I'm jumping at the slightest sounds, avoiding mirrors because I don't want to see the strain in my eyes. I find myself watching the store's entrance, half-expecting that dark figure to walk in and rent a horror movie.  
  
And then it happens. I load a tape from 1995, and there I am—a younger version of me, barely six or seven, playing catch with some kids. I freeze, the remote slipping from my fingers. That's my old red cap. The one I lost when I was a kid. It's as though I've been physically struck, my past flooding back in flashes, but they're only fragments—disconnected images and sounds, and none of them match what I'm seeing on the screen.  
  
My eyes drift, almost unwillingly, to the background. The figure is there, of course. Closer than ever. Almost as though it's aware of me, watching from the future. My heart pounds as I eject the tape, overwhelmed by a mixture of fear and an inexplicable sense of violation.  
  
What is this? Some kind of sick joke? A threat? A warning?  
  
Despite the terror creeping through me, despite every instinct screaming at me to stop, I reach for another tape. I have to know. I have to find out who that figure is, why I'm in these tapes, and what all of this means.  
  
With trembling fingers, I load the next tape and press 'play'. And as the screen flickers to life, I can't help but wonder: Am I merely an observer, or am I part of this twisted story that's still unfolding?  
  
I'm about to find out.  
  
I brace myself as the tape begins to play. This one starts differently—no playground or familiar setting of suburban bliss. Instead, it's an open field, overcast skies giving the scene an otherworldly appearance. The camera hones in on a young boy standing alone in the middle of the field. It takes me just a second to realise that the boy is me.  
  
I'm clutching a teddy bear in one hand, its worn fabric and missing eye immediately recognizable. It's Teddy, my childhood companion I thought I'd lost forever. How could this be? Memories flood back—memories of that teddy bear, of songs I used to hum, of a younger, more innocent time. And yet, those memories are fragments, jumbled pieces that don't make a complete picture. They don't include this field, this tape, or anything on it.  
  
My younger self looks lost, afraid even. He—or I—glances around, as if searching for someone. Then my eyes drift to the background, and there it is. The figure. Unlike before, it's much closer now, just a few feet behind my younger self. Although still shrouded in shadows, the figure's form is clearer. Almost human but not quite. It stands there, unmoving, as if waiting for something.   
  
Before I can make sense of it, the tape ends abruptly. The screen goes black, replaced by the soft, white noise of static. I'm left there, sitting in the darkened room, trying to catch my breath.   
  
What the hell did I just witness? How can I be on these tapes, participating in scenes I have no memory of? Who is that shadowy figure that seems to haunt these fragmented slices of my past? Questions swirl around in my mind like a storm, each unanswered and each leading to an even darker place.  
  
I eject the tape, my hands trembling. Only one tape remains in the box. The last one. Despite the icy dread filling me, I know I have to watch it. Is this masochism? Curiosity? A desperate search for answers? Maybe it's all of those things. Or perhaps it's something deeper, an instinctual need to face whatever it is that's been lurking in the shadows of my past and now, seemingly, in my present.  
  
I take a deep breath and insert the final tape into the VCR, my heart pounding as if trying to escape from my chest. Whatever is on this tape, it's the last piece of a puzzle I never asked to solve, a story I never wanted to be part of.

I press 'play', staring at the screen as static fills it. I'm waiting for something, anything to make sense of this haunting series of tapes that have consumed my life. And then, it comes—not in images, but in sound. The high-pitched, heart-wrenching screams of children pierce through the room. It's a sound no one should ever have to hear, and it chills me to my very core. My heart races, my palms are sweaty, and a sense of dread washes over me, like an unrelenting tide.  
  
That's it. No more. I can't take this any longer.  
  
I eject the tape and pick up my phone, dialling the number for the police. As I explain the bizarre and horrifying series of tapes I've discovered, I can sense the scepticism on the other end of the line. Yet, the seriousness of my tone, or perhaps the very absurdity of what I'm describing, convinces them to take it seriously. They arrive within the hour, confiscating the box of tapes and assuring me that they'll conduct a thorough investigation.  
  
Weeks go by, and the unsettling events become a persistent background hum in my daily life. The loneliness of the video store, the place that once gave me solace, now only amplifies the disquiet that has taken root inside me. I find myself jumping at shadows, avoiding the small pool of regular customers, and pacing nervously through the aisles of old movies. I tell myself that the police will find some explanation, rational or not, that will help me put this chapter behind me.  
  
One evening, as I'm closing up, I notice something that makes my heart skip a beat—an envelope, placed carefully at the edge of the counter. I don't remember seeing it earlier, and no one has been in the store for hours. With a sense of foreboding, I open it and pull out a small piece of paper.  
  
"Did you like our family time?"  
  
The words, written in an elegant, almost playful script, send a jolt of terror through me. My hands tremble as I read and reread the note, each word like a punch to the gut. I look around, half-expecting to see that shadowy figure lurking in one of the dark corners of the store. But I'm alone, at least as far as I can tell.  
  
The police investigation, the unanswered questions, the figure in the tapes—all these come rushing back with a sense of urgency that leaves me dizzy. I sit down, my legs unable to support me, and try to catch my breath. The memories of my childhood, those lost years, remain as elusive as ever. They taunt me from a place just beyond my reach, but their emotional weight is all too present.  
  
I realise then, with a clarity that cuts through the fog of my confusion and fear, that whatever this is—whatever those tapes were trying to show, whatever that figure represents—it's not done with me. Not yet. I don't know if it's a haunting, a warning, or some sick game, but I know that I can't escape it. At least, not yet.   
  
And so, I sit there, alone in the dim light of the video store, surrounded by rows and rows of forgotten stories. Forgotten, much like my past. A past that has come crawling back, refusing to be ignored any longer.  
  
As I lock up the store, the note clutched tightly in my hand, a single, chilling thought echoes in my mind: My past is not ready to leave me. And with that realisation comes another, even more unsettling one: I'm not sure I'm ready to confront it. But it seems I have no choice.
