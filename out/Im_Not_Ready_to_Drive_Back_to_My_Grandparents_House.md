I wouldn’t say my grandparents live out in the middle of nowhere, *exactly*…



It’s more that up in the north of British Columbia everywhere can feel a bit like nowhere sometimes.



You can be driving on a main road and not see another car for a better part of an hour.  For that reason, it’s custom that you always check on cars with their hazards on in case somebody is having a medical emergency or has a flat or something. 



Anyways, my grandparents live in a fair sized town up in northern British Columbia. I visit them every week while finishing up my degree.  



My grandfather’s health has declined a lot these last few years so I typically arrive on Friday nights at 11:30, sleep in their guest room, do some housework over Sunday and leave after lunch and a couple hours of catching up.



This schedule means that up until recently I’ve been making late night drives on the really quiet “highway” that goes from the city where my university is, up to my grandparents place.  It hasn’t really been a problem for me as I’m naturally a night owl and the drives were a great way to unwind after a stressful week of school.



A few weeks ago something happened on one of my drives up to their house and I feel like I need to talk about it with someone or my head is going to explode.  I don’t want to tell my friends or family because they’ll think I’m crazy so I figured maybe you folks can help me and I can stay anonymous.



It was right at the beginning of March, there wasn’t any snow but it was still cold as hell up here.  I had started my trip late because of a stupid argument with my roommate and I had called my grandparents and told them to not stay up for me.



I had been driving for most of the two hour trip and not seen a single car on the road.  It was pitch black out with some of the early spring mists we get up here.  The huge black forest hemmed in both sides of the highway.



I saw the red lights flashing in the mist as I crested a hill.  



The car was pulled over on the shoulder, interior lights on and surrounded by a red corona from the hazards.



The first thing I noticed was that it was the same make and model as my car, the second thing I noticed was that it was empty.  



I punched my own hazards on and pulled behind the car.  I got out and walked up to the it.  I peeked in to see if someone was lying in the back or something, no dice.  I noticed that the driver's side door was slightly ajar.



I looked around and called out



“Hello, anybody out there?  You left your car open.  Are you OK?”



The forest was silent. 



I peeked into the car to see if it could give me some hints as to who it belonged to.  The interior was pretty plain, I only really noticed that the dashboard clock was set to 12:12, 33 minutes ahead according to my serviceless phone.  I didn’t think to check the license plate.



I waited a minute longer in case the driver had just ran into the woods to pee or something but when nobody appeared the creepiness of this abandoned and unlocked car started to get to me and I resolved to call it in to the highway patrol as soon as I got back into service.



I walked back to my car through the red lit mists and pulled back onto the highway.



I drove for about five minutes, half guilty I didn’t look for the owner more than I did, half glad as hell to have that car behind me when I saw it.  



Red lights flashing in the distance.  



As I got closer I started to feel a little lightheaded.  This whole last fifteen minutes seemed like a dream.



It was the same fucking car



Same model, same interior light on, as I got closer I could tell the door was ajar.  I could tell it was also empty



I drove past it.



As the lights faded into the rearview again I found that the unease only got worse.  I was wondering if some prank was being played on me by… I didn’t know.  Kids maybe?



I found that without even thinking I had slowed down on the road.  I was cresting another hill and I couldn’t admit it to myself then but I guess I can now…



I was scared to see what was on the other side.



Eventually I hit the top.  I breathed a half-sigh of relief before it stuck in my throat.



Red lights flashing in the distance.  



The mist had almost swallowed them but once I noticed them I couldn’t look away.



I stopped my car on top of that hill for a good few minutes before starting to roll forward again.



The mists gradually revealed exactly what I knew they would: make, model, interior lights.  When I was up parallel with the car I peeked into the window and saw the dashboard clock read 12:12, 18 minutes away.



I saw it through three panes of glass.  My passenger window, and then the two windows of the empty car.



Something moved into the treeline.  



Something human.



Suddenly, most of my fear was transfigured to anger.  Someone was screwing with me and whoever it was was hiding in the trees and laughing about it.  I pulled in front of the loser's car and jumped out of my own, intending to give them a scare.

 

“Hey dumbass, game’s up I saw you!”  I started to jog towards where I had seen the figure move.  



I heard motion deeper in the trees, it sounded clumsy, but pretty far in.  Not thinking I plunged in after the sound.



I chased the noise for what felt like only a couple minutes but it kept getting fainter and suddenly I realized that the only crunching footsteps I could hear were my own.



That’s when I realized I couldn’t see the road or really much of anything in the dark and the mist.  I suddenly realized I was very cold.



I turned back the way I thought I had come but after a few minutes of walking I wasn’t so sure.  I pulled out my phone planning to use the compass but I must have turned the flashlight on in my pocket or something because the screen only turned on for a few seconds before the phone shut off.



Just long enough to read the time.



12:08.



I heard something crunch in the trees.  I peered out blindly towards where I thought the sound had come from before hearing a similar noise coming from behind me then to my left, then in front again.



Suddenly I was surrounded by footfalls from sources I couldn’t see in the dark and my heart started pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears.  



I bolted away from where I had stood frozen and dashed away from sounds. I heard them  give chase a moment later.  



I was running more or less senselessly, surrounded by trampling feet when I heard it.  It was so distant that I was scarcely sure I hadn’t imagined it



“Hello, anybody out there?  You left your car open.  Are you OK?”



Somebody must have seen my car and the other one!  It was coming from a good distance behind me.  I was running the wrong way.



I pivoted and ran back towards the sound.  I ran straight through the sounds of pursuit nearly silently praying I didn’t run into whatever was in the woods with me.  



The crunching, running feet moved past me and I ran towards where I had heard the voice trying not to make a sound.  



“Hey dumbass, game’s up I saw you!”



The same voice, much clearer now.  I should have noticed it then, I don’t know how I didn’t.  It must have been total panic but I just followed the sound of the voice.



A moment later I saw a glow of flashing red lights cutting misty red beams through the huge pines.  



I stumbled out onto the gravel shoulder and the lights and saw only one car.  The one with its hazards on.  



I peered back into the forest for a moment trying to make sense of the voice that led to safety when the sound started.  



It wasn’t one scream.  There were many screams all starting at different times coming from the woods from seemingly different places.



But even though there were many screams, they were all the same voice.



It was my scream. 



I ran to the car with its hazards on and plunged my key unthinkingly into the ignition. 



It started.  I slammed the gas and flew away from the shoulder and down the road with the sound of my own screaming voice still filling my ears.  I watched the clock tick over to 12:13.



I haven’t told a soul about this and I haven’t driven on that road since.  I told my grandparents that university has just been too hard lately and I needed to take a couple weeks but now they’re asking me to come by again. The only other way up to my grandparents house is an 8.5 hour detour.  I took that way back but if I took that path regularly people would start to wonder.  I heard my own death scream on that road, a sound I haven't made.... yet.  What should I do?
