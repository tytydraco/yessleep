Maybe this is just the norm for everyone; if so, then I’m about to sound like a fool. For as long as I can remember, dreams have always felt all too real. I can still remember nightmares I had as a child, often more vividly than my own memories. I struggle to distinguish my memories of reality from those that have only occurred in the depths of my own mind. Many times as a child, I would recall events to my parents, only to be met with confused looks, followed by reprimands for "telling stories."

When I dream, I wake up exhausted. I’ve always heard that sleep is supposed to be restful, but I’ve always just assumed that was a misconception. How can the intensity of dreams possibly feel like rest?

Last night was like any other. I followed my usual routine, took some melatonin gummies, and then lay down to rest, making sure my night light was on. I’m a grown man, but I always keep a light on for comfort; something about being alone in the darkness with my own thoughts is unsettling, especially when I already struggle to decipher what is real. It also provides solace when I jolt awake in the middle of the night—a reminder that whatever I experienced can’t affect me anymore. It took what felt like hours to fall asleep, but at some point, I finally drifted off.

I found myself on a road—similar to the quaint downtown I grew up in—but uncomfortably different. It was noon, the sun had an orange tint, and the sky was a pale yellow. People were in the streets in a panic, terrified of something, yet their faces were devoid of emotion. Had it not been for their body language, I wouldn't have realized anything was wrong. There was a man who stood out. He was standing in the barber shop across the street, calmly staring out the window. He wore a blue and white suit embellished with multicolored sequins; a stark contrast to the dull, warm colors around us. I looked around and spotted a reptilian creature a few hundred yards away. It was about seven feet tall, standing on two hind legs, covered in brownish-green scales. It had massive red talons on each appendage and rows of teeth like a shark, but with cat-like canines. Saliva dripped from its jaws as it looked into the crowd. I recognized that it was distracted and slowly began to walk towards an alley, hoping to go unnoticed. I took my first steps and instantly realized that it was the first sound I had heard since arriving in this town. I looked back at the creature, which was now looking in my direction. It tilted its head back and let out a deafening screech as it began to charge at me. Each step shook the ground. I instinctively sprinted down the alley, desperately trying to escape as the creature’s steps grew louder. I didn’t dare look back; I just kept my head forward as I exited the alley onto another street.

Ahead of me, I saw a familiar road sign followed by several dilapidated houses, all unique. The road sign was purple, and one of its sections read “Joy Avenue.” It was the road I grew up on. I began to recognize the houses on the road and noticed my childhood home on the hill at the end of the road. Still running, I could still hear the footsteps getting closer and the ground shaking more intensely. I crossed a few more blocks and then I saw it—my old house. I finally reached the front porch and started banging against it's the old wooden door 

“LET ME IN! HELP!”

I was quickly knocked to the floor as the door swung open. I looked up to see a hand reaching out.

“Get up and come inside, quickly!”

I grabbed the hand and looked up to see who it belonged to. I was comforted to see it was my mother, though considerably younger. She didn’t seem to recognize me. She lifted me to my feet and hastily dragged me inside, locking the door behind us. The house looked so familiar yet eerily different. The couch was the same but a different color, the ceiling was covered in wall paper and the dimensions of the living room were slightly off. The fireplace on the wall was filled with ice and cool blue flames that seemed to be keeping the house cool. All the blinds were tightly closed, but they were backwards, defying gravity as they hung from the windowsill and were dangling upwards towards the ceiling

“We’re safe now. It can’t see us in here. Are you okay?”

“I’m alright, but a little out of breath.”

“I saw you coming. I almost thought you weren’t going to make it. I’m Susan, by the way.”

“I’m Sean.”

At this point, it was clear that this version of my mother had never met me before

“What was that thing?”

Susan chuckled, paused, and then gave me a look of confusion.

“Wait, are you serious? How have you never seen a booma before?”

I paused briefly 

“GOTCHA! I really had you fooled, didn’t I?”

“Ha! Good one. They have been bad this year. I can’t wait for winter to get here.”

“Winter?”

“The...the cold season? When all the reptiles hibernate? Come on, Caleb, did you flunk out of grade school or something?”

“Oh, yeah... sorry... I, uh, I’m just a little shaken up still, that’s all.”

“You can wait here until the booma leaves, then I can take you to your car.”

"I don't think I have a car"

“No car? How do you even survive the summers? Fine, I can take you home then. Where do you live?”

Wait, this is my home. I was suddenly hit with the realization that I was in a dream. It doesn’t always happen, but when it does, I can often wake myself up to escape whatever nightmare I’m in. I tried to open my eyes to awaken. Within a moment, I was transported back to my bed.

I sat up. My heart was racing, and I was out of breath. I lay back down and breathed a sigh of relief; it was over. I decided to watch some videos on my phone to calm myself down. As a hobbyist magician, my feed is often filled with tutorials on tricks. I found a video that seemed to draw me in almost magnetically and pulled it up.

The video started with a shot of a card table. On the table was a single card. The magician stretched out his arm and flipped it over, revealing a Jack of Diamonds.

“Is this your card?”

I noticed that my hand was now lying next to me. Though I could have sworn I was holding my phone with both hands, I felt something between my fingers and lifted it up. In the dim light I could just barely make out the Jack of Diamonds. I felt my heart sink and my body tremble. I looked back at the video, and the camera had now panned up to the magician’s face. I immediately recognized his fashion sense—a blue and white suit, embellished with sequins, and a grin stretching from ear to ear.
