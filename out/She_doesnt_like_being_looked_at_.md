You know the feeling. That brief, unshakable sensation that someone’s watching you? Like an icy prickling at the base of your spine, the hairs on your neck standing at attention. It’s harmless, right? Just a fleeting moment of paranoia. A quirk of the mind. Maybe the wind brushing against the window. Maybe a shadow shifting. You dismiss it. It fades as quickly as it arrives.

But tonight? Tonight, it doesn't fade.
It lingers.

My laptop is glowing in front of me. The soft hum of the fan is the only sound, the only thing to break the silence as I’m making edits I’ve put off. The words blur together, my mind unwilling to focus. I’m tired, I tell myself. That’s all. But still, my eyes keep darting to the edges of the room. The shadows are too thick. The corners too dark. I catch myself staring into nothing.
Except… that feeling.

It’s there again. That pressure. Like someone’s close enough to breathe down my neck. My pulse quickens. The air grows dense, too thick, like the room is shrinking in on me. I try to focus on the screen, but the weight of it all is suffocating. It’s like the walls themselves are closing in, the air too heavy to breathe.

I force myself to exhale, to push through, but then I hear something.

It’s so faint at first, I wonder if I imagined it—a soft rustling, like the whisper of fabric. My breath catches. I glance around, scanning the room. Nothing. It’s as if the noise came from nowhere.

But then…

A soft scrape.

My window’s shut. The house isn’t settling. The sound is too close. It reverberates in my skull and my chest tightens. I freeze. The air feels too still, too thick, like it’s pressing in from every direction.

No.

I try dismissing it, but the sound comes again—faint, like something heavy moving across the floor, barely audible. I feel my body tense. The pressure on my chest tightens. I’m not imagining it. I’m not.

I’m not alone.

I turn my head, glancing around the room once more. But there’s nothing.

Nothing.

Just the shadows, deeper now, darker, pressing against the walls like something waiting to unfold. I glance up at the ceiling, almost hoping—no, praying—that I won’t see anything. But, I do.

In the far corner, where the ceiling meets the wall, there’s a slight shift. Minute, but it’s there. A shadow. A shape that doesn’t quite belong. My stomach drops, and I can’t look away.

It’s not just a shadow.

It’s… moving.

I can’t breathe. My hands freeze above the keyboard. I should look away. I should run. But I can’t. I have to keep looking.

The shape... it’s shifting. Growing ever so slowly. A tiny patch of darkness, stretching out unnaturally, slowly developing in the corner where my wall meets the ceiling. It’s a twisted black form that seems to stretch, distorting like it’s made of something that isn’t quite real. Not light, not shadow. But something… worse.

I feel my heart racing, thumping against my ribs like a drumbeat. My eyes are locked on it, even though I wish I could look away.

What looks to be hair comes next.

Strands of black, stringy hair begin to fall from the shadow. They don’t sway like hair should—they move too slowly, floating, gliding through the air. Long, wet strands that cling together, framing something below them. Something I don’t want to see.

I can’t pull my eyes away as the face forms.

It’s pale, too smooth, stretched thin over what seems to be bone. The skin is drawn tight, and the more I stare, the more I see, and I don’t want to see it. I wish I didn’t.

But there’s no way I can stop.

The face tilts, and I hear the sharp snap of bones as the neck jerks forward. The motion isn’t fluid—it’s jagged. Jerky. Unnatural.

The hair parts, revealing empty, black eyes. Hollow. Endless. They swallow the light around them, sucking the room into their void. The cold in the room deepens, and I can feel it in my chest now. Like the room is freezing me from the inside out. I can barely breathe.

The whisper comes.

Not quite a whisper, but a vibration. Not a sound in the air. Not a voice. But a hum, a deep shiver, thrumming deep in my chest.

“I don’t like being looked at.”

The words don’t come from the air. They feel like they come from inside my mind. My heart lurches in my throat.

The shadow shifts again and grows.

The figure tilts its head, slowly. Too slowly. My mind can’t comprehend how it moves. The face bends in ways it shouldn’t. A crack splits the air as the bones of what have now formed her neck snap, the sound sickening, like something breaking. The figure’s arms stretch upward, one hand slowly pressing flat to the ceiling. The skin of her elbow bends backward with a sound that makes my stomach churn. Her limbs don’t bend at normal angles—her elbows twist around like broken hinges, her hands jerking into place.

The skin on her fingers is stretched too tight, the bones too pronounced.

And then—she moves.

It’s not walking. It’s not falling. She’s crawling. She starts sliding across the ceiling, her palms pressing into it with a sickening, crackling sound. Her fingers twitch, curling against the ceiling, scraping. The noise echoes in the room like nails on a chalkboard.

I feel the pressure in my chest grow worse. I can’t breathe. The air is so thick now, so cold. I feel my body freezing from the inside out. Every breath is a struggle. But I can’t stop looking at her.

The cracking doesn’t let up and she inches closer.

I hear the sound of her joints popping, crackling like dry branches breaking. Each movement is slower, deliberate, like she’s savoring the fear that’s crawling through my veins.

She’s right above me now, her black eyes locked onto mine, pulling me in like gravity. My body won’t move. I’m trapped. I’m frozen.

“I don’t like being looked at.”

The words vibrate through my bones. They’re not a warning, because I can’t look away now. Not anymore.

And then, I understand.

I’ve seen her now. Seen her stringy hair, her face—either her eyes or her eye sockets, I still can’t tell. Her anatomy and movements. I can’t unsee what’s now manifested in my room.

For whatever I did to deserve this, she can’t unsee me. She doesn’t like being looked at.

But now, I’m not sure if I want to look away.
