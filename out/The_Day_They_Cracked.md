# *Trigger Warning*

I was sitting in the closet with a kitchen knife held close against my chest. My heart was pounding up against my chest as my breath grew more and more strained. They were looking for me around the house. Calling for me. One had taken a baseball bat as a weapon, banging it against the wall aggressively shouting at me saying I shouldn't have come there. But I still remember what I came there for.

I went to this house after a lot of consideration before hand. I knew the people inside well. I thought they were friends of mine but now, I know they aren't. I met Madison a few years ago in a mall. I was at my lowest point and she brushed up against me while I was walking around the food court. We both stopped and turned to each other apologising before having a nice conversation. From that day forward I saw her nearly everyday. Whether it was at the mall, park, or gym. I saw her nearly everywhere except for her house. I have only been able to stop outside of it once, when Madison told me to leave her alone and freaked out. I knew something was wrong with the other people Madison lived with. They must've told her something about me that had tainted our relationship.

This is when I finally decided to do something about it. I really appreciated the relationship that we had formed since that day in the mall and I was going to get it back. I decided that I was going to finally talk with them that day.

But when I finally entered the house through the window to try to find them. Someone saw me and immediately picked up a weapon to try and harm me. I panicked and ran down a hallway to one of the rooms before jumping into the closet with my kitchen knife.

As one of the men in the house entered the room I tried to control my breathing to hopefully not give away my position. He walked in further in before he opened the closet swiftly and hit me over the head with the baseball bat agin and again. Suddenly the life and death scenario kicked in and through the pain I stuck my knife in his neck with much resistance. Blood squirted all over my face and hands as he started suffocating. Drowning in his own blood and gurgling while I plunged the knife one more time into his heart to make sure he was not a threat. I did it out of self defence. If I didn't do it, I'd die...

Little did I know my ears were ringing the whole time from what I assume was an overuse of adrenaline in my body. When the ringing had subsided I saw another one of Madisons friends screaming in the doorway, utterly shocked at what she had just seen me do. I let the mans limp body drop to the floor and hurriedly moved over the doorway to silence her. I put my hand on her mouth as she stood there frozen. The blood on my hands and torso was dripping down her clothing, soaking into the white T-Shirt she was wearing. But she started to fight back against me elbowing me and punching me. I didn't understand. What did I ever do to these people to warrant this reaction. These psychos were out to kill me!

Then I finally heard Madisons voice down the hallway. "Mom, are you ok?"

Hearing her voice made me feel more relaxed hoping that'd she'd help tell her friend who I was so we could all be happy. Thats before Madisons friend elbowed me in the stomach most aggressively before yelling at Madison to call the police. Again I didn't understand, these people are trying to kill me! The cops would surely take my side.

But Madisons friend ran over to the baseball bat and started trying to hit me with it. I was able to catch one of the swings and I yanked the baseball bat out of her hands. Her eyes were wide open as I threw the bat to the side and began to advance on her. Knife in hand, as blood dripped off of it from the previous psycho who tried to kill me. She pleaded for her life but I knew this was all a tactic just so she can get one up over me. I struck her down stabbing her over and over again to make sure she couldn't hurt me or Madison any more.

I could tell she was dead when I looked at her lifeless eyes. They were almost a reflection of the darkness of the room around us. But no matter. I needed to find Madison so we could put an end to this madness. I slowly walked out of the room. My vision blurry from the flurry of attacks from these people.

I was looking around trying to find Madison before hearing her voice in a room at the end of one of the hallways. It was definitely Madison. I knew her voice very well.

She was saying "Yes I know the man! I met him in the mall a few years back... I think he's been stalking me ever since... yes officer I told him to go away and leave me alone after I encountered him outside of my house!" She said all of this crying and hyperventilating over what I assumed was the phone. She continued "I think he just hurt my parents! Please send some one over here!"

As I heard these things I had to wonder why she was lying to them. Thats when anger overcame me and I started fiddling with the doorknob thing to get in. The door was locked so I yelled at Madison to open it. "HES HERE! PLEASE GET HERE FAST! PLEASE!" Her screeching was starting to give me a headache. I started bashing up against it hard. Leaving blood marks all over the egg white door. As I was I heard the front door being broken down.

As I turned around I saw two police officers with guns drawn and aimed directly at me. They shouted at me to put the knife down as I tried to explain to them that this was all a misunderstanding. I took one step forward before a volley of shots rung out. I fell to my knees before uttering my last word. "Madison..."
