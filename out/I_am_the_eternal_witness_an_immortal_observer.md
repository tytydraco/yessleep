I have been alive for longer than you can imagine. I cannot die. I’ve tried, many times, but nothing can kill me. I’ve jumped off cliffs, crushed my head with rocks, one time I even sat in a volcano. I have outlived my friends and family, and even my entire species.

At first, it was exciting. I could go on adventures and experience things that nobody else could. But as time went on, the true horror of my existence dawned on me. I watched as the world around me changed, as civilizations rose and fell, and as the earth slowly decayed. I was the last human, the last being of any kind.

As the planet became uninhabitable, I wandered the barren landscape, searching for any signs of life. But there was nothing. There was only me, and the sand beneath my feet. I would remain alone for all eternity. I watched as the sun died, and the universe began to go cold and dark.

In my younger years, much like anyone, I learned of the heat death of the universe, the inevitable end of the universe. I thought that this end had finally come, that after aeons I would finally be able to die. But even as the stars let out their final rays one by one, I remained. I watched as galaxies collapsed, and the universe became nothing but a vast, cold, emptiness.

But even in the emptiness, I was unable still to die. I floated through the void, or perhaps I was immobile, without any light I was unable to tell. My thoughts were the only company I had. I thought about my life, about all the things I had seen, and experienced. I thought about the people I had loved, and lost.

I could not even try to guess how long I’ve been there, in the dark, but after a long, long time, something miraculous happened. Another big bang occurred and a new universe began to expand once again. I could not believe it, but it was true. I watched as new stars and galaxies formed, and I knew that I would once again see the beauty of the universe.

As the new universe began to take shape, another earth formed, and yet again I experienced the rise and fall of many a civilization. I couldn't help but wonder if this cycle would continue forever. As you are reading this, I have lived through eleven big bangs.

If there was one thing I knew for certain, it was that free will as you know it is an illusion. Every cycle is the same. But now, because I posted this message, your life from now will be different. Just by you reading these words I have made an impact. But it will not matter.

I will never know the peace of death, and I will be forced to watch as the universe continues to evolve and change, and end, and start again. I yearn for death, but it will never come. I am trapped in this existence, cursed to witness eternity.
