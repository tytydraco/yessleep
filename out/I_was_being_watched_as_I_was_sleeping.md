It was October 16th of 2021. it was a normal night for me, scrolling through tiktok for hour straight then dosing off around 11pm. i woke up around 2am to some noises coming from outside my window. i thought it was the wind but it wasn’t a windy night. i found it kind of concerning but didn’t think nothing of it and went back to sleep after taking a sip of some water.

 I woke up the next morning feeling really tired. i looked at my window and it was open, i didn’t remember opening my window as i always kept it closed. i went to shut my window but then i saw something in the trees and it took a second for me to realize what it was.. it was a ladder. i was in shock wondering if someone has been in my house. i wouldn’t be able to ask anyone because i lived alone. so i did something i never thought i would have to do, i set up some cameras covering every room and making my office my security room. i made sure that the window in that room was completely covered so who ever was watching me or breaking in wouldn’t be able to get into that room. 

after i got done setting up the cameras i went and made some dinner before i went to bed. i made sure to lock my windows before going to sleep. i turned on some Netflix and fell asleep around 12:30 am. i didn’t wake up that night and i checked the camera footage. i didn’t see anything until around 1:30am, there was someone at my window trying to open it at least i thought it was a person, i sped up the footage then seeing it gone i checked the other camera footage and i saw it crawling through one of my windows in the kitchen that i have forgotten to lock. and then i noticed it was going into my room. i changed the camera to my room and i saw it walk into my room and it just stood there watching me sleep for about an hour. then it didn’t leave my house, i realized it looked like some crackhead i’ve seen before while taking a walk in town. then i heard the door open and he or what ever it was started attacking me we fought for a few minutes then i was pushed into one of my windows that was not so secure and i was planing to get it repaired in a few days but i should have gotten it fixed sooner because it pushed me out of the window and i fell and landed on my back, then i blacked out.

i woke up to paramedics putting me into a ambulance then i saw a man being arrested by police turns out he was an escaped inmate at a mental institution that was known to rob and murder the owner of the house and stalk them in there sleep. i ended up being paralyzed from my hips down. i now live with my friend and he’s taking care of me. i go to therapy because of this and now i can’t sleep in a room with a window and the door has to lock. all i can say is make sure everything is locked before going to sleep you never know who’s going to try to break in.
