I have exhausted all my avenues and I don't know where else to turn so here I am. I'm concerned about someone close to me whom I love so very much.
 
Her name is Maya, and she's my best friend. She also happens to be a cat. She's the only creature in this world that I care about, even more than i care about myself. She's my only companion in this large, empty, dusty house that I moved into two weeks ago. I am writing this now to recall those past two weeks, just in case something bad happens to us. Or when something bad happens to us.

About a month ago, February 18th, my father died. It was...a relief, to be honest. Speaking in retrospect at least. He was a selfish man, and one who believed that investing in your strongest asset is the best. 

That's why he left our family property to my little brother. And his prized Ford-F150, and his boat, and even mom's old mini-van. Our youngest brother inherited dad's back up Jeep, which he promptly drove off to live the hippie druggie life out somewhere in California. And I inherited the responsibility to plan and execute his wake, funeral, and obituary. And somehow, the responsibility of tracking down our druggie youngest brother from some coke house and nursing him back to sober enough to function at aforementioned wake and funeral. My younger brother already had his own home with a wife and a baby on the way, so he wasn't interested in dad's old house. So its passed on to me, the Black sheep of the family. 

After all the hoopla of the burial and handing out of assets, here i sit, almost alone. At least I have Maya. But, as mentioned in the title, she's been acting strange since we got here. I know cats take awhile to get accustom to a new space, but even after I first got her and she moved into my old apartment, she didn't act like this. 

Maya has been meowing a lot. She was always vocal, begging for food or the laser pointer whenever she felt playful. But this had been different. She's been meowing at nothing, constantly, to the point where her voice gets croaky and hoarse. What's been particularly frustrating is when she does it at night, wondering through the halls as I try to sleep. Even trippling my sleep medication hasn't stopped me from being awakened by her cries. And when her cries turned to moans, almost a croaky groan in her throat that sent a shiver down my spine every single time. It scares the shit out of me. 

I call out to her, beckoning her to come back to bed, or praise her for collecting a toy if i suspect that's the cause of her howling. It never is though. When I felt brave one night to get out of bed and seek her out, i find her sitting, staring straight up at the ceiling. When I call out her name, she turns to me, eyes glinting in the  light in that animalistic way. She just stares, doesn't move, even as I become and call. Her stance mimics a statue until she slowly, eerily turns her stare back up to the ceiling. My heart pounds in my chest, and I slink back to bed, closing the door behind me to keep her out for the night. It felt cruel, especially hearing her scratching at the door accompanied by those chilling yells through the empty halls. I've kept my door open at night since then, despite my fear that night.

I consulted with my best friend, Marie about it as she visited. She's owned cats all her life, currently housing 4 herself in her home with a husband and son whom I sometimes babysit. They're the ideal, picture perfect life i wish I could have. And she's the ideal best friend I've ever had. 

Marie advised food and treats to coax her to come to bed with me, as she often used to in my old apartment. Pavloving my cat, essentially. I felt admittedly dumbfounded at myself not thinking of such an obvious idea. I'll blame my growing anxiety, in retrospect. But, yes, classical conditioning. That seemed easy enough. She also advised to remove any catnip infused toys that she had, which i did promptly with Marie's help. With a hug and wishes of love and good luck, i wished her goodbye. 

That was yesterday. I'm currently sitting in my bed, typing this out at 4am, after being awoken by Maya's cries yet again. Ill probably edit this later and post it during daylight hours. Despite all the measures I'd taken. Yes, I know im probably being paranoid. Maya did follow me to bed, coaxed by the treats as advised. When the sleep meds hit my brain she was still snuggled up in the crook of my curled legs, her head resting on my knee beneath her paws. It was peaceful for the first time in this house. That's probably why I'm so freaked out right now, wrapped in anxiety as tightly as I am wrapped in my blanket.

If anyone has any advice I'd greatly appreciate it. I've only owned Maya for about 4 years now, and grew up with nothing more than a toad. I've exhausted all my other avenues, Google and reddit have no good, scientific answers. I have an appointment for the vet in a week, even though the phone call with her seemed oddly intent on insuring me that Maya is getting used to her new space. 

 I care about her a lot, as previously mentioned she's my closest companion. I want to make sure she's okay. That were both okay. 
Thanks in advance.
