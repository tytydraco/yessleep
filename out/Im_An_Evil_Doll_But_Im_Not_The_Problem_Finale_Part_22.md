The beginning of the end

“Mike, you’re not going to say anything?”, I ask. 

Amid the chaos and rules of creation being broken, Mike chuckles. 

“No, I’m not. If it was me in his shoes I’d be doing the same thing. Kind of jealous actually.”, Mike replies, lacking conviction. 

“I’d estimate ten to twenty minutes before I’m nothing more than…well nothing, actually. 

I’ve borrowed enough totems and baubles to bring hell with me during that time.”, Demi says somberly. 

“I’ll change. I can’t let you do this.”, Sveta says, tears in her eyes. 

Demi laughs, “One lycanthrope, at the cost of likely the entire line. 

The ledger doesn’t balance Sveta. The only thing that holds me back from bending reality is self preservation. You’re one hell of a brawler, but…be reasonable.”

The cold logic, coming from one of history’s worst people feels right at home in the twisted war we find ourselves in. 

“I always wanted to be the one to put you down.”, Mike says. His tone is sad, the threat comes across more as a compliment. 

“I know. If you’d been around when I was ripping my way through London, maybe the world would have been a few dozen unfortunate women richer. 

It’d been one hell of a game either way.”, Demi says, putting his hand on Mike’s shoulder. 

“I did get to disembowel you once.”, Mike replies. 

The two men are being flippant, but the conversation is more than the words being said. Deeper than the gallows humor they both wallow in. 

“When I got a new body, after we saved that town. 

Bit harsh really, didn’t get me out of your head either.”, Demi reminisces.

“The universe does seem to hate me. 

There’s one thing I need to tell you though.”, Mike’s tone is somber. 

“Now would be the time.”, Demi answers. 

Mike takes in a long breath. The moment of reflection in this deathtrap underscores his statement. 

“I found fan art of us, making out.”, Mike says. 

Demi grins, it’s the closest to friendly, the closest to human he’s looked. 

“My dying wish is for you to kill the artist Michael.”, Demi says, rolling with the bit. 

Through his haze of dark humor, tears are falling down Mike’s face. Making grimy trails in the blood and makeup. 

“ I will.”, Mike barely chokes out. 

 Demi turns away from us, walking toward the ever expanding mass of the Bishop. 

As he does, one by one, items of power he has purchased or stolen begin to float from their places of hiding of their own accord. They begin to orbit him, each starting to fracture and leak it’s unique essence. 

Demi begins to inhale the energy, waving his hands through it, exhaling smoke as his body begins to vibrate and crackle with arcane force. 

Compared to the Bishop’s chaotic transformation, Demi seems to undergo an evolution. 

His laugh booms through the vast space, echoing in our minds like an intrusive thought. Terror, pure and elemental bleeds off of Demi. 

He grows, he changes. From a backalley stalker to a massive gaunt thing that looks like the banned relative at the grim reaper family reunion. 

As this happens, Demi speaks, “I am the prodigal son. I am the noble savage, the moral heretic. 

My legacy will echo throughout the millennia, the horrors I’ve inflicted, the disasters I’ve averted. 

 Yours will die with the hero you tormented. 

I am the good Samaritan. I am the bad man. I am the paradox, the contradiction that is humanity. 

I am, the, *fucking* Ripper!”

And with that, the emptiness behind him changes to a grey mix of cloud and esoteric power. It might be just the human mind looking for patterns, but I swear I see a face in it. 

He stands as large as the Bishop, but more than that, his energy, his will can be felt. 

“That’s…something.”, Leo says, stunned. 

“Old boy, this work of yours shows zeal, but it’s sloppy. 

To be fair, that’s what happens when you go poking around places your mind cannot handle. 

Subtlety is key, sir.”, Demi says, casually waving one hand at the spreading mass of the bishop at his feet. 

Dozens of feet around Demi are cleared of the Bishop’s foul corruption. The ripper’s smirk nearly extends off his face. 

Massive abominations, hastily formed lurch toward Demi. With a clawing motion they fall apart, inert rags and chunks of meat. 

The Bishop keeps up his litany, but there’s a look of concentration on his warped face. 

“Hard to focus, isn’t it? I’ll bet every inch of this paranormal fungus you’ve elected to become takes concentration most people couldn’t imagine. 

Sorry to say, chap, but I don’t think you have it in you.”, Demi taunts. 


With a snap of Demi’s fingers the Bishop is swarmed by hundreds of massive red eyed insect-like creatures. Somewhere on the Venn-diagram of locust and wasp. 

"Jesus!", I scream, scrambling out of the way of one of the cat-sized things. 

It’s aggressive, and soon joined by a handful of it’s swarm. 

Leo slashes at some with a combat knife, taking a nasty sting in the process. The wound develops a black ring around it almost instantly. 

Sveta swats one out of the air, bare handed. She’s quicker than I can track.  The creature twitches on the ground, organs ruptured. 

The way the rest give her a wide berth sends a chill down my spine. These things are smart. 

Leo clips one with his blade, it’s enough to send it zig-zaging to the ground. It takes me three stomps before it stops moving. 

With a shuddering jerk of reality the insects simply cease to exist. 

Still the Bishop keeps up his call to beyond. 

That force where the gate was, that energy, seems closer, larger, watching. Trying to look at it feels like a splinter in my eye. 

“Sometimes if you need something done right, you have to do it yourself.”, Demi says, walking toward the Bishop. As he does, the carpet of the Bishop’s flesh below him turns to ash. 

A haze comes off of Demi. Excess energy bleeding from him in arcs and wisps. 

“Face me, false prophet!”, Demi screams. 

He begins to speak, a language not meant for the ears of man. 

In front of him appears a dark gift from a darker place. 

It’s a flagpole sized stiletto, black handled, with a blade that holds the agonized faces of hundreds of victims. 

He grabs it. His face has an almost erotic look of glee. 

 “Never thought I’d hold you again, my love.”, Demi says to the blade. 

The Bishop begins to form a massive simulacra of himself. He pours almost every inch of the fungal growth into it. 

It’s a dark, faceless humanoid mass. What a lunatic sees when he looks into the mirror. 

Left chanting is the Bishop’s head, a deformed spinal cord and malformed organs hanging below it like a tadpole’s tail. 

The road around us starts to crack and shake. Stone and strange debris begin to lift, launching themselves at the Bishop’s avatar. 

A handful of seconds is all it takes for the air to turn into a whirlwind of shrapnel. 

We run for cover, debris striking around us with the force of gunshots. 

“Demi, we’re catching strays down here!”, Leo screams. His voice is lost in the chaos and violence. 

I feel small, insignificant. These two gods in front of us engaged in a war for the future of reality, while I’m cowering from aggressive rocks. 

All around Demi and the Bishop energies war with each other. The void, and what is in between battling as much as their avatars. 

Temperature swings from boiling to freezing. Waves of emotion hit us like air-burst bombs. Dark clouds begin to form, the air fills with grimy rain. 

With every thrust of Demi’s blade, figures begin to form. Wailing, chained things, the remnants of centuries of foul acts. 

They rage, they swarm, they destroy. 

But they aren’t a surgical strike. They’re tortured spirits, bound and trapped, looking to take out their rage on anything that still draws breath. 

A tall, ethereal woman with a face mangled by an untold number of slashes screams toward Leo. Centuries of rage, terror and pain let out on the first living creature she can see. 

Before Leo can think of a defense or draw a weapon, she has him by the throat. 

Frost creeps from her touch, she babbles insanely, screaming in Leo’s face, demanding answers he doesn’t have. 

Mike tries in vain to harm the spirit. Then attempts to distract it. 

But all of that time, trapped, tortured, and tormented has made her focus beyond pinpoint. 

Sveta is backing away from a small girl, one arm nearly wrenched from it’s socket, hangs limply. Her ghostly form flickers, appearing from different angles. 

I see more and more of the damned spirits take notice. 

“Fuck!”, Mike says. He tries to keep his distance from a mutilated father, daughter duo that has seem to taken interest in him. 

“Demi, we need some help down here!”, Sveta screams. 

But the fact is, he can’t hear us. Between the cacophony of masonry and the undead, we might as well be whispering in a wind tunnel. 

There’s no one coming to save us, good, evil or otherwise. 

I assume the thing that crawls toward me was once human. But as it stands, it’s a rearranged jigsaw of a human form. Grey wisps of ectoplasm fall to the ground as it makes it’s way toward me. 

Despite the freezing temperature, I’m pouring sweat. The fate of reality hangs in the balance, but that means nothing if I die here. 

“The hell are you doing Punch?”, Mike asks, stumbling as the two tormented spirits close in. 

I don’t answer him. But to clarify things for everyone reading, I sit down. 

Trying not to be afraid is a lot like trying not to think about polar bears. The harder you try the quicker you fail. 

So I don’t think about not being afraid. I sit down and try to comes to terms with the fact that I’m going to die. 

Inch by inch the mutilated thing comes closer. Taking it’s time, enjoying the fact it is now it’s turn to mete out violence. 

“How long has it been?”, I ask, a fist sized chunk of road exploding beside me. Driving fragments of stone into my arm. 

The thing in front of me doesn’t react.

I’m not welcoming death, but I understand it’s reality. 

I feel a little spark, the tiniest of connections to the thing in front of me. 

“Do you know where you are?”, I say. 

It keeps coming forward, working it’s rearranged limbs in an unnatural fashion. 

“You think this is going to make you feel better? No judgement, just curious.”, I prod. 

It stops for a moment, tilting it’s head almost doglike toward me. I feel that spark grow just a bit. 

I block out the chaos around me, the blood running from a dozen random wounds.

“I don’t think it will. You’re angry, and you’re hurt, you’ve been twisted by something you can’t understand. 

I get it. Before I got here I was basically a ghost in a doll. Driven to kill, hell, designed to kill. 

But you know what I figured out? The supernatural, isn’t as full of absolutes as it seems. Nothing is all powerful, nothing is set in stone.”, I say. 

The thing keeps coming toward me, it’s face is inches from mine, long rotten grey hair obscures a face that has been cut apart and put back together by the hand of a psychopath. 

It’s presence makes me feel tired, weak. 

“The man that killed you won’t exist in about ten minutes. I can’t say I know what that means for you, but I can’t see how it could be any worse than what you’ve went through. 

What’s going on is bigger than either of us.  I promise you, if we get out of this, we’ll make sure you and yours find peace.”, I plead. 

The creature in front of me wails, loud enough my head starts to ring and my vision blurs.

As I try to shake off the daze, the apparition turns toward the others attacking us.  

I don’t hear any words being exchanged, but Leo is dropped, and the handful of spirits start to move toward the bishop. 

“What in the hell did you say to it?”, Mike asks. 

Leo tries to stand, grabbing at his frostbitten neck. 

“Just told it the truth.”, I say simply. 

Mike raises an eyebrow. 

“Punch, you were, Christ, I don’t know how to say it. Speaking ghost, I guess? You didn’t notice that?”, Mike asks. 

I shrug, “Guess we’ll add that to the ‘I’ll look into it if we survive.’ file.”

“Leo, are you alright?”, Sveta says running over to him. 

“I’ll live.”, Leo barely croaks out. 

There’s a world shaking snap that brings our attention to Demi and the Bishop. 

My heart sinks, Demi is bent backward, nearly in half, the Bishop’s avatar screams in triumph, swatting away spirits like flies. 

Behind the that energy from in between begins to reach out toward Alex.

Ichor flows from Demi, his spine sticking through his stomach. 

We stand, stunned, watching our only hope of saving reality get snuffed out. 

“Demi!”, Leo tries to scream. The hero tries to sprint toward our dying companion. 

Mike holds out an arm, blocking Leo’s path. 

The rest of us are shocked, scared, and feeling our deaths creep in. 

But the clown, he has a smirk on his face. 

“Get your fucking hand off of me, we’ve got to hit him while he’s weak!”,  Leo screams at Mike. 

“He’s not weak Leo.”, Mike says simply, “But give it a second.”

Demi coughs up a torrent of blood, his head turns limply toward us, his long, almost snake-like tongue, falls out, trailing on the ground. 

I don’t see it at first, but a small light pulses on that black, pointed organ. 

The Valhalla. 

With a knowing look to us, he draws his tongue back and swallows. 

White, pure flame springs from Demi’s body, either its heat or its source driving the Bishop back. 

For a moment the fire is blinding, the hand of God making a clenched fist. 

Then, we see him. 

Believer or not most people can picture a fallen angel. Satan, the devil, old scratch. 

But what about an ascended heretic? 

The power of the divine, manifested through the farthest thing from it. Juxtaposition incarnate. Demi blazes with holy light, he clenches a fist, the energy burns like the sun. 

The Bishop chants, his avatar throws itself at Demi. 

Demi’s backhanded blow throws the avatar, it lands in a heap, trying to give itself form again. 

“What a divine joke. I’d always assumed the power of the righteous to be a paltry thing. 

But this….

Live and learn I guess. Though I won’t be doing much more of the former.”, Demi says. 

The ripper grabs the staff imprisoning Alex. At first, even his form, burning through itself with the warring powers of light and darkness can't budge it. 

Pieces of Demi flake away into the aether, but with a final massive pull, the staff moves. He throws it end over end, it flies down the ancient road like an esoteric caber, tearing and gouging the road beneath it. 

The Bishop’s head has a clear look of concern. It keeps up its insane litany, but it’s now stumbling over words, sweat beads its brow. 

The force, the thing coming from where the gate once stood lashes out. Whatever it is has learned anger. It refuses to be starved of sensation again. 

“Sveta, Mike, get her out of there!”, Leo yells. 

Punch, any chance of doing you thing with…”, Leo points to the visual attack coming from the space where the gate once was, “That?”

I try, and I don’t make it more than a second before I hit the ground, eyes dripping blood. 

“Hell no.”, I reply. 

The Bishop’s avatar has given up any kind of humanoid form. It spreads itself out, a globular mess. Demi tears through it with glee, but we still can’t see anything that might be a weak point. 

Leo aims his pistol at the Bishops head. The small round passes through. 

“Thought it was worth a try.”, Leo says hopelessly. 

 Mike and Sveta try in vain to crack open the staff. Whatever is holding it together doesn’t budge. 

Demi tears through the Bishop’s avatar, tearing through it faster than it can create more mass. But with every blow, with every burst of energy, the warring powers of the divine and the arcane take more of his body and soul. 

But then, as Demi hits the avatar with a glimmering white cloud of fog, we see it. 

A twisted impossible nine sided geometric shape composed of vile flesh and bone. As quickly as it’s exposed, the Bishop covers it in more of his uncontrolled growth. 

“That’s it!”, Leo screams, “Keep it up Demi!”

Leo takes aim with the pistol, waiting for his next chance. 

“This is god damned invincible.”, Mike laments. 

Despite her monstrous form, Alex looks helpless, trapped, afraid.

“Fuck this, I’m changing.”, Sveta says. 

This time there is no one to convince her not to.

She begins to cry, thinking of everything she is going to lose. 

Then I feel it. A couple hundred faint pinpoints of light. Scores of dedicated, blessed souls. 

“Wait!”, I scream at Sveta. 

She gives me a look of confusion, I can tell she has no intention of listening to me. 

But then she feels it. Not the same sensation I have, but the road itself slightly vibrating. The effect of an army on the march. 

In a few seconds we can hear them, a booming chorus of footsteps and battle-cant.

Demi is starting to wane, the warring energies having stripped him to nearly a skeleton. He no longer taunts and laughs, a look of supreme concentration on his face as he tries to keep his blaze of glory going. 

Coming down the road is an army of Heroes, and their collection of horrors. Travis at its head. 

It doesn’t take any kind of paranormal intuition to understand these folks know they are likely not making it back. 

We meet them by Alex, Travis looking grim and holding something strange.

“What made you change your mind?”, Leo asks him. 

Travis gives a mirthless grin and chuckle, “Let’s just say I found out who keeps the cell phones going down here. And when a member of Hell’s royal family tells you reality is in danger, it’s a good idea to listen. “

“Son of a bitch, Art?”, Mike says. 

“The one and only. He told me to give this to you, with a message.

He wants you to consider this an act of good faith. If you survive, he says he needs a sit-down.”, As Travis passes this message along he hands Mike a thick, black walking stick, topped with a yellow happy-face orb. 

“That’s the third one of those I’ve seen you with.”, Leo says, unimpressed. 

Mike studies the walking stick, holding it close to his eyes, even smelling it, “This is my weapon, there are many like it, but this one is mine.”, he explains. 

After he does so, Mike walks over to the staff trapping Alex. With a few casual flicks of his wrist, the hinges break as if they were made of candy-glass.

She throws off her prison, screaming, “ Nine”, as she raises her monstrous form in challenge to the bishop. 

“Yeah, yeah, clown we’ve all seen full metal jacket. 

Sveta, you get back to the city, we’ve got a safehouse and a new identity. 

The rest of you, take these. If you come out of this alive, you’re not going to want to step foot in the city again. This shit is going to have repercussions, and everyone and their grandmother is going to want to figure out who is responsible.

These will get you home.”, Travis says, passing each of us a small silver coin, “Now, let’s do something stupid.”

 Demi’s scream starts out loud enough to hurt, then trails off like a dying speaker. 

What’s left of him begins to fall like a morbid rain, body, soul and essence spent. Knowing who he is, I don’t know how to feel. But watching him give up everything for the fate of reality, it has to be worth something. 

Before the bishop can recuperate Travis’ people hit him with a wave of every flavor of the divine. Prayers from the bible, Torah, Koran and everything in between ring out as Travis people expend their finite power on our behalf. 

“Nine!”, Alex screams, dropping to all fours. 

Leo checks the chambers of his pistol, then climbs on her back. He reminds me of an old time sheriff going to meet the local rustlers. 

“I’ll get his attention. You Stick that up his ass and pull the trigger till you see daylight.”, Mike says. 

The Bishop’s litany stalls, the force where the gate once stood starts to falter, become erratic. 

Mike, laughing like the lunatic he is, charges blindly toward him. 

The remaining mass of flesh lashes out, but there are too many targets. Long tendrils fly through the air and smash into the ground. It isn’t without casualties, but for every Hero wounded, there are two more to take their place. 

Mike dances through the chaos, dragging his walking stick across the Bishop’s formless mass. 

The litany is replaced by screaming, but the Bishop can’t focus on the clown. 

Mike grabs his stomach, stitches ripping as he has to nearly limbo to avoid a blow. 

Alex charges, Leo on her back. She leaps into the air, her legs burrowing into the Bishop’s flesh like a tick. 

Leo holds on for dear life as beams of energy, and enchanted ammunition tear holes in the bishop that are taking longer and longer to regenerate. 

Four heroes who I can only describe as aggressively Amish looking work an ancient looking Gatling gun. The shells tear through the Bishop, creating a hold large enough to expose that core of hatred and evil that keeps him going. 

Leo hangs off of Alex by one leg, twisting himself to manage to get a shot.  

The first is wild, doing nothing more that making a momentary pinprick in the bishop. The second tears a piece off the side of the hellish organ. 

The Bishop screams, his form lashes out randomly, the energy from in between begins to flicker. 

A thin, whip-like protrusion gauges a deep line across Leo’s face. 

Leo screams, focuses for a moment and fires. 

Dead centre, pun absolutely intended. 

The Bishop’s death is like a chemical reaction. The energy from in between starts to spike, tearing apart the road, and the Bishop’s body. 

Far from being a sudden peace, it feels like Armageddon has hit this hidden path.

“The coins, Now!”, Travis screams. 

Alex leaps off of the liquefying Bishop, joining us. 

“We’re not leaving you, we don’t even know what’s happening.”, Leo replies. 

“Neither do we, other than that asshole is dead. If this isn’t the end, there needs to be someone alive who knows what went down here.”, Travis says grimly. 

Mike rejoins us, barely able to stand, his entire lower half soaked in blood.  

“Can I say it, I’ve always wanted to say it.”, He says as the energy behind us lashes out in rage and confusion. 

“Sure Mike.”, Leo says, exasperated at Mike’s gallows humor. 

Mike grins holding out his coin, “Well, here goes nothing.”.



A purple flash. The, nothing for what feels like a long time. Long enough that I begin to wonder if we made it, or if we were all just torn asunder. 

Out of that darkness, that void, I start to feel like I’m falling. With a painful impact I’m jarred out of my torpor. 

We’re in that same field where the Bishop gathered his congregation. 

I feel guilty as I smile, I may be down a hand, but I’m still in my body. Hurt, tired and starving, but human. 

“Shit, I was hoping I’d get a fresh meat suit out of the deal.”, Mike says inspecting himself. 

Leo is half conscious, blood loss and the effects of being hit with a half dozen forms of supernatural energy. 

But, Alex. 

Her massive, armored form lays inert. No breath, no warmth, not a single sign of life. 

“No, fuck me, no.”, I say, running over. 

I shake her, I scream, I even try kicking anything resembling flesh. But, nothing. 

I know, maybe we just saved reality, but this kid deserved better. She had no choice in this, and she spent her last days being twisted in mind, body and soul. 

I hit the ground, sobbing, burying my face against her cold chitin and bone. 

Mike puts a hand on my shoulder, “Punch, she’s gone.”

I know, but I just can’t bring myself to accept it. If there is a god out there, he’s a malicious son of a bitch. 

We walk away, intending to get back to JP and Sveta’s old place.

As we do, we hear a snapping noise, flesh tearing. We assume it’s Alex’s form breaking down. 

“Punch…”, I hear faintly. 

I rush over to the body, Confused, Mike and Leo catch up. 

“Help…”, we hear from deep inside the mass of flesh and bone. 

We begin to tear away at the body, it’s surprisingly fragile. Bone spines break like sand sculptures, flesh that was once bulletproof falls away like discount steak. 

Once we have cleared enough away, she manages to drag herself out. Alex looks at us, eyes wide. 

I can’t say she’s fine, she’s banged up, bleeding, and could use a week’s worth of hot showers. But she’s alive, and more than that, she’s human. 

Leo starts to cry with joy, picking her up. 

“Leo, that hurts.”, Alex says, but the happiness in her voice outshines the pain. 

So we leave, eventually making our way back to Sveta’s old home. 

“Does anyone have a key?”, Leo says as we stand in front of the door. 

We all share a morbid laugh at the thought of being stymied by something so simple after everything we’ve been through. 

Leo rattles the doorknob, then gives it a bit of a test kick. 

“If we could not break in and have to deal with cops while soaked in blood, that’d be great.”, Mike advises. 

“I agree, but…”, as Leo replies the door swings open. 

At first I’m confused, I don’t see anyone behind it. 

Then I hear it, something low to the ground talking in a voice not many people would understand. 

“I’m so glad to see you two. I was beginning to think you weren’t going to come back. 

No idea why I wasn’t able to go through the portal but Kaz, Hyve and me have been keeping an eye on things around here while you were gone. 

Everything worked out I assume?  And who’s the new guy?”, Punch says. 

I feel a sense of disorientation looking down at that body I inhabited for so long. And a sense of confusion as to how I’m looking at…myself?


This is going to be the last post for a long time. It’s been a long trip, and I’m eternally grateful for all of you that have been on it with me. All of the advice, the encouragement, hell, even the jokes kept me going. 

But right now, I need to figure out why, and how there seems to be two of me. 

It’ll be a nice change of pace at least. 

Till then. 

Remember everything I’ve shown you. 

Punch.
