There were never any construction crews before it appeared. Nothing to indicate that people had worked on it or that it was planned. Where there once been a lot, there was now a house.

But this house was not like the ones that surrounded it. Our street was not a place where the populace thrived and extravagance ran through. We were modest in our living quarters, our one story homes more than sufficed. But this house towered over us, casting a shadow over our sleepy town.

Its design imitated a mansion more than presented as one. Staring at the windows only revealed them to be glass panes attached to the brick wall, with no way to look inside. The side door was attached to what was supposed to be a chimney, causing fire to jump out whenever it opened. Catching the garage door opening revealed it to open sideways, much like the front. The more you stared, the more nonsensical the building became.

Our cul-de-sac was tight knit, but welcoming. Our neighbors were the first to attempt to welcome these new guests. They had stopped by our house before walking over. My memories of thirty years ago failed to recall specifics, but they invited my parents to their surprise housewarming. My parents denied. Our neighbors then left to go to the House at the end.

They never came back.

The next day, where my neighbors house once been, a sign, reading "For occupation" stood on its ground. It lay empty for weeks before another of house came in its place, bringing with it new occupants.

What can I say of those occupants? My parents never wanted me to come close to them, for like the houses they inhabited, they seemed like imitation rather than flesh. Their white teeth always shown in a smile that was just wide enough to cross over from friendly to creepy. Their skin, it crossed the barrier of what could be considered pale into almost ghost white.

And their mannerisms. Even their bizarre appearances would have been excused if not for the way they acted. Their speech sounded strung together, like the words they spoke belonged to different sentences spoken in different ways. When outside, sometimes they would just walk around in a circle, or they'd start mismatching chores like painting the grass, or using a lawnmower to vacuum their car.

Other times, they would just stand and stare. Sometimes, I felt that they were staring at me.

My parents forbid me from going anywhere near that house, which after a while soon became houses. I heeded their demands not out of obedience to them, but out of fear for my own safety. And although many neighbors and friends went towards that house, getting replaced not soon after, we stood our ground.

I remember that, when my mother was still on the town council, major chances had come about due to the house. Our schools, infrastructure, and other utilities suffered major cuts by the mayor, all so they could reallocate funds 'somewhere else.' They would shy away when you ask where the money was going.

My mother was the only opposition on the council to this change. But was quickly outvoted by the other members of the council. I sat in one of those meetings once, when my father was busy and couldn't look after me. I saw he scream on deaf ears and cry out every word of her plea, but everything she did was dismissed in a monotone voice.

I caught for a glimpse what the mayor and council were paying for. As mom stormed out of the hall, the members gathered in a meeting room next to the main entrance. My eyes caught what I assume now to be the budget chart of the city, and taking up what I believed to have been almost 70% of it, was just something called 'House.'

The council disbanded soon after. Although the vote was not unanimous, the other members just never showed back up to meetings, leaving my mother to have to deal with everything alone. Soon, however, the mayor personally showed up to fire her.

At that point I hardly recognized the man anymore. Ever since he reallocated the funds, he started getting paler, his smile more toothy, his grin growing wider. I could sense he was becoming more like the imitators at that house. My mother cried that day, that night, and the next morning. I tried to console her, but she pushed me away. Before I left, I heard her mumbling something.

"That wasn't my friend anymore."

Now that my mother was without a job now, my father was the sole breadwinner for our family. But it wasn't as if his place was free of that house's influence. 

He told us night after night about how those things have picked up jobs at his place of work. They didn't seem to even do anything productive, other than to type random letters on a notepad or even resting their head on their computer. Yet, despite everything, they were praised by upper management all the time, even promoted faster than my father ever was. Soon enough, even his new boss was one of those 'imitators' as he called them.

This continued for years. My mother searched for a new job, but each one was either run by an imitator or rejected her for her 'criminal record.' My mother, who never so much as stole a candy bar and would never hurt a fly, now had a criminal record. I inferred it had something to do with the council, but I couldn't know for certain.

This had also made me an outcast, as my former friends turned on me for not bowing down to these new invaders. They called me names and pushed me around while they got showered in riches and the latest toys, accessories, and other forms of opulence. All the while, they were oblivious to their own transformation. 

It wasn't until college where I managed to escape from town. I went somewhere far away, where they couldn't follow me. Driving out seemed almost like a nightmare. Each resident of those houses and those who had given in were all outside on their lawns. I could feel their eyes on me, so I tried not to stare back. Once I had left, I felt something I hadn't since before those things came, relief.

I've had a normal life from that point onwards. I've started a family, made friends, and found a career in History, a passion of mine. For now, I've been able to have a pretty normal life. I have only been back to my childhood town once, though, and with my hindsight, I realized that was a grave mistake.

I had gotten a call from my mother. Apparently, things have gotten even worse for them since I left. The house have started to grow, some even started to connect. My mother even says she can feel a heartbeat when walking near one.

I knew I couldn't leave them there, so I rushed to get them as fast as I could. Going back, I found the most unusual surprise. The signs that had once displayed the name of the town only said one thing. 

"Welcome home."

I knew I really shouldn't have tried to go further, but I didn't want my parents to be left alone in that hell. Going in, I saw what my mother was talking about. The houses looked like what you'd think a child would design after asking about his dream home. Every one was taller, with rooms sticking out of each other and even being diagonal at some points. 

Everyone was outside, staring at me that same way just like when I left. I ignored them, my parents were my top priority after all. Coming to my cut-de-sac, I saw something I had only ever read about in science-fiction before. 

It was the house from all those years ago, but now it looked almost like an organ. It had what I could only describe as tendrils sticking out of it, connecting the other houses that looked even more grotesque. It could see every branch of it moving, beating almost like a heart. But that didn't hit me as hard as when I saw my former home.

It was completely covered in those tendrils, not an inch of the house even showed. I tried calling my parents, maybe they had gotten out before whatever had happened. My hope, fading with each ring, eventually died out when I saw the tendrils start to contract. 

This thing had trapped my parents inside and now it was slowly suffocating them. There was no doubts about it now. I know others that would have been braver and tried to ram into these tendrils to save their loved ones. Unfortunately, I am not one of them. I drove away like a coward right then and there. I let my parents die, without a fight. 

No one tried to stop me from leaving, and got to my house after a long and arduous drive. I still blame myself for what happened. If only I had thought to get them out of there before the house took revenge. If only I tried to fight back against this monster, maybe they would still be here. I cried, just like my mother did all those years ago.

After the service, I started up a habit of driving around the whole town now. My wife thinks I'm getting paranoid, but I know what I saw, and I know what happens if you don't get away fast enough. I don't know if whatever that house is has started to spread, but the first time I see one of those monstrosities enter my town, I am protecting my family and moving as far away as we can. 

Hell, I've even started getting concerned now, as one of my friends showed me some vacation photos with one of those things in the background. Just knowing they're spreading is putting me on edge. But what concerns me even more, were the faces of those outside the house.

They had the same exact faces as my mother and father. And they were looking right at the camera.
