Dear Exalted members of the Calmet Society.  
  
My name is Veronica, and I’ve been the active regional manager at the Jessheim Hotel chain for four years as of last month. I will include the address and direction of our location along with any relevant contact information with this letter.  
  
I have learned about the existence and purpose of this organization from Mister Sebastian R. Atkinson, who from what I understand is a retired member of your organization. And from what he was able to convey to me. I understand that you are a group of independent researchers of the uncanny and the unusual.  
  
And I took the courage to contact you because I believe that my current predicament may be of great interest to your members.  
  
We’ve been having unusual events going on in one of our hotel branches. I could only describe it as poltergeist activity. And although that may sound absurd, our security cameras have captured several disturbing examples of this activity that we could share with you.  
  
I’ve worked in the hotel industry for over 15 years, and never once have I encountered anything remotely close to what’s been going on here. It all started a little over a year ago when one of our guests, had come to the front desk complaining about strange noises coming from the room next to hers. At first, I thought she was just hearing things. But as time passed more and more guests began coming to the front desk with very similar complaints.  
  
I would be walking around the hotel or I would be doing some work in my office, and I would hear hysterical crying or even screaming coming from one of the rooms. And when going to investigate, the room would be completely empty. Sometimes these events manage to confuse my senses so much that I would need to go as far as to check the booking logs only to find out that the room was not booked, sometimes for weeks in a row. And yet I would find myself asking the same question. “Who was that just now?” But lately, this activity escalated. Especially in the past three or four months.  
  
Guests have been complaining about being disturbed in the middle of the night by strange apparitions, noises, and objects being moved around. And I can attest that there is more to those stories than meets the eye. On one occasion I was working on checking our inventory stocks, and I heard a noise coming from the hallway. As I walked down the hall when out of nowhere, a decorative desk lamp launched at me. It had enough force to tear its plug from the wall socket and send it crashing into the opposite wall. I was the only one on shift at the time but this was captured with our CCTV camera system. It made no sense.  
  
Yes, I have seen many benign events like doors slamming shut on their own, lights flickering, and large objects moving around in the rooms when there’s nobody there. These affairs are creepy and irritating but I am more concerned about the occasions that could cause legitimate harm. I know it sounds absurd, but these ongoing issues are escalating for the worst. Two weeks ago, I was filling in a post for the late shift, and I received a call at the front desk from one of the rooms. The man was screaming and sounded absolutely terrified. He claimed that somebody was in his room with him and trying to strangle him to death.  
  
In the background, I could hear furniture dragging across the floor and the sounds of various objects being thrown across the room. I could hear the man screaming for his life. Security and the police were called to go and investigate his room. By the time we all rushed up there, the man flew out of the room, cowering in a ball in a corner of our elevator lobby. Upon entry, the room had been completely trashed. It looked like a tornado had gone through. The man was babbling about how something had been trying to kill him and how it had almost succeeded. He was so shaken up that we had to call an ambulance.  
  
As you might expect, he checked out the following morning, and we have not seen or heard from him since then. He was outraged at us and blamed us for not warning him so that a black shadow man could appear in his room. He said that this entity attempted to strangle him violently. It was something that he had never seen or experienced before. He described it as pure evil. Although, he struck me as a very religious man, and he stands firm that whatever had attacked him was a demon from the pits of hell that was targeting him. Although we did try to bring several priests from several religions. We attempted multiple types of rituals cleansings or exorcisms with no change in the outcome. All attempts were inconsequential. All rituals or ceremonies were completely ignored by all the entities that haunt our hotel.  
  
All these failed attempts have left me completely shaken and without any answers. But recently I would hear my name on the wind and I am not going to lie. I don’t know how to describe it really. The only thing I can compare it to is the distorted sounds old radios make. I guess that would have to do for now. This unnerves me every time this happens. I am afraid of what lies in the dark corners of the place where I work. And it is not just me. These events are unnerving, to our guests, as well as our employees and if this continues for long we will need to close this branch down. So far we called in priests, medius, shamans, and even paranormal investigators.  
  
I don’t know what to do, and I’m starting to feel like I’m going crazy. Do any of your members have experienced anything like this? Is there any advice on how to deal with this? I would really appreciate any input on this situation.  
  
But more importantly, If you believe you could solve our issue I would like to invite you to visit our humble establishment, for an all-expenses-paid stay at our hotel.  
  
Thank you for your understanding.  
  
Kind Regards
