My name is Raphael.  
After what happened a few weeks ago, I stopped paying attention to small things that don’t make sense. This is probably a mistake.

I have a habit of checking the time whenever I wake up at night. I don’t even think about it anymore. My eyes open, my hand reaches for the phone. Automatic.

That’s why I noticed when the clock started being wrong.

The first time, I woke up feeling unusually alert. My phone was face up on the bed. I tapped the screen.

**3:12 a.m.**

Something about it felt off. Not the number itself — the feeling. Like I’d already seen it recently. I brushed it off and went back to sleep.

The next night, same thing.  
Same feeling. Same automatic movement. Same number.

**3:12 a.m.**

I remember frowning at the screen, genuinely confused. My phone updates the time automatically. I checked the battery. Fine. Signal. Fine.

On the third night, I woke up *before* touching the phone already thinking, *If it’s 3:12 again, something’s wrong.*

It was.

I started paying attention after that. I didn’t change my routine. Didn’t force myself awake. I just… noticed.

Every time I woke up naturally during the night, no matter how long I slept before or after, the time was **3:12**.

I tested it once. I stayed awake on purpose, scrolling, waiting.  
3:10.  
3:11.  
3:12.

I locked the screen.

When I turned it back on, it was **3:12 again**.

I didn’t sleep that night.

The following day, I checked my phone history, screen-on times, notifications. Everything suggested normal use. No glitches. No freezes.

But something else bothered me.

I couldn’t remember *falling asleep* anymore. Not once.  
Every night felt like a cut. Like time simply skipped.

A few nights later, I woke up without reaching for the phone. I stayed still, staring into the dark. My heart was racing, but I didn’t know why.

Then the phone lit up by itself.

No vibration.  
No sound.  
Just the screen turning on.

**3:12 a.m.**

I hadn’t touched it.

That’s when I noticed something new, reflected faintly on the glass of the screen.

The time wasn’t the only thing being displayed.

Below it, in small system text, like a calendar reminder, there was a line I had never seen before:

**“Awake.”**

I sat up immediately. The screen went black.

The next morning, there was no trace of it. No notification history. No reminder. Nothing.

I tried not to think about it. Tried to convince myself it was a half-dream. Stress. Sleep deprivation.

That worked until I stopped waking up at night altogether.

No dreams.  
No interruptions.  
Just sudden mornings.

But I knew time was still passing, because every morning my phone battery was lower than it should’ve been.

Last night, I decided to check something.

Before going to sleep, I wrote a note on my phone:

*“If I wake up, I’ll remember.”*

I put the phone face down on the nightstand.

When I woke up this morning, the note was gone.

In its place, there was a new one.  
Same app. Same font. Different text.

It said:

**“You do wake up.**  
**You just don’t check the time anymore.”**

I don’t keep my phone near the bed now.

But every morning, when I unlock it, the first thing I see isn’t the home screen.

It’s the clock.

Still frozen at **3:12**.
