My dad was the first man to ever scare me. He used to put holes in walls, and he would scream, god, he would scream. He wouldn’t ‘hit me’ hit me, but he would hit the walls around me to let me know that he could. He hit my mom for a few years at least, until we got out of there. 

I don’t think any of them ever hurt as much as my dad. The man who made me couldn’t love me. Sometimes I look in the mirror and all I can do is stare at the parts of me that I stole from him. I have his red hair, his pointy freckled nose, and his stupid eyes. The eyes are the worst. I look at them, but they glare back at me, and I can feel the hate wash down my spine. 

The day my mom decided she’d had enough and we left, he pulled a gun. I was sitting in the car, buckled into my car seat, and even at my age, I felt the air shift. My uncle had to hold my father down while my mom, my Mamaw, and my Papaw got my mom's stuff out of the house. My dad and uncle served together in the Marines; that’s how my parents met. My uncle invited my dad over for Christmas at his house.
 
I wish I could have been there that snowy day. I wish I could have seen my dad red-faced from the cold, spot my mom waiting for her brother on the porch. I imagine the look in his eyes when he realizes he wants to marry this woman, have a life with her, to love her. That fantasy never lasts long when I think about the real life they would lead. Having a baby at 19 when they aren’t yet separated from their own childhood days.
 
I remember my uncle crying, this war-hardened veteran begging my dad to stop, telling him I was in the car, telling him I was seeing this, seeing him like this. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him cry aside from this moment in my life. 

In my dreams, my dad is a rabid beast. He’s thrashing under my uncle, trying to grab the gun my uncle had gotten away from him. His bones begin to crack, with loud pops and shifting bumps under his skin. The sharp shards start to break free, poking out of his flesh. The wounds bleed, and I know he’s in pain, but he stops screaming and begins to growl. These animalistic deep sounds that shouldn’t come from a man.

My uncle throws himself away from my dad, scooting away from him as fast as he can. My dad doesn’t seem to notice he’s free because at this point, his teeth have begun to grow into sharp shark-like points sprouting out of every bit of empty space in his mouth. There’s blood dripping from them due to their violent birth out of his gums. I watch him slowly, so slowly, rise from the ground. His arms look closer to a spider’s than a man’s; they bend where the bones have broken, and he throws them around as though he doesn’t quite know how to use them. The father-creature crawls his broken body toward my uncle, who lunges for the gun. But he’s too slow, far, far, too slow. 

Father-creature throws himself on my uncle, staring at him with bloodshot, engorged eyes. My uncle tries to fight, clawing at father-creature's face and trying to break the already mangled bones. Father-creature takes his nails, now pointed like ten knives, and digs them into my uncle’s eyes. I want to look away, I want to focus on anything else, but when your brain wants you to see something so bad you dream it, you unfortunately have to look. My uncle screams and screams as father-creatures’ nails go deeper and deeper. His eyes pop out one by one. They hang by his cheeks, connected by nothing more than two thin red lines of tissue. My uncle stops screaming as his body falls to the ground with a sickening thud.

Father-creature rises off my uncle, more steady on his tangled legs now, as if the bloodshed has sated him. He lumbers toward the house where the rest of my family is, totally unaware of the beast stalking their way. I try to scream, to yell, to do anything to warn them, but nothing will come out. My throat is so dry it’s painful, and all I can get out are strained gasps. Father-creature pushes the door open, and I hear the screams start.

I hear my papaw first, his deep voice going up to a girly tone as he yells for my mom and mamaw to run. When my papaw’s voice dies out, I hear the beginning of two female voices. One is begging, “Sal, Sal, I love you, please!” The other is hurling threats, screeching out profanities as if they will be a physical shield. One after the other, the curses halt and the begging intensifies before it's snuffed out as well.
 	
Father-creature emerges from the house after what feels like centuries. Years piled on years of sweating in the boiling car, decades spent with the straps of my carseat cutting into leftover baby fat I hadn't dropped yet. He pushes his way through the door, his stomach distended in a way that betrays his sins. Father-creature stares at me, and there’s no father left in his eyes. He makes his way to the car, taking the slow steps of a predator when they know their prey can't run. The knives of his nails scratch and screech against the glass as he drags his hand across it. When he finally shatters my last line of defense, the shards fly my way, and I feel warm blood flow from a new cut on my cheek. 

Father-creature enters the car, corralling his spindly limbs inside. He looms over me and huffs out a breath. The smell of my family washes over me. He leans in close to lick the blood off my cheek. I feel his mess of teeth press into my skin,  and he’s gone. I started to cry then my throat was finally able to pass noise. sobs, full body heaves, and screams leave me. Father-creature is gone, and he didn't even have the decency to eat me. He didn't care enough to even give that effort. He couldn't finish what he started. He never wanted me. He never wants me.
