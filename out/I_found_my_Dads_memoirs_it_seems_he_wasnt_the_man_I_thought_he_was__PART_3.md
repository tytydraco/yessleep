For those who missed it as it’s been a while, here are both the [First](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/yujo94/i_found_my_dads_memoirs_it_seems_he_wasnt_the_man/) and [Second](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ywjc7z/i_found_my_dads_memoirs_it_seems_he_wasnt_the_man/) parts. I want to apologise to you all, as I know there’s been some concern in the comments for me and Mikey. We’ve spent the last nine months on the run, moving from place to place to avoid being found. I couldn’t risk posting before now just in case anything led my parents to where we were. I’ll pick up my story from where I left it last time, in order to help you understand some of the reasons why i’ve been so quiet.   
As I stared out of the window in shock, watching the light glint off the knife Mum was holding, my survival instincts kicked in. I needed to do three things: Keep Mum away from me and Michael, free Michael, and make good our escape. I hurriedly dialled 999 on my phone, and it connected instantly.   
“999, which emergency service do you re-”  
“Please, help, police, my Mum’s murdered my brother! 29 Cranbrook Gardens!” I yelped desperately, cutting the operator off. I immediately hung the phone up as the operator started to respond. I knew that nothing would mobilise the police in our sleepy town like the word ‘murder’, so I went for the dramatic. I stuffed my phone into my pocket as I heard the front door click shut. I shut up straight away, hair standing on end, trying not to move too much.   
“Saaaarah” came my Mum’s voice downstairs, sing-song and taunting. She was toying with me, knowing she was in complete control. “Do you want to go first, or shall I go and deal with your disgusting brother?”. Her voice dripped malice as she slowly made her way through the hall, clearly listening out for any sound. I knew I had to keep her away from Michael, so I dashed quickly across the room, out onto the landing and into what had been Michael’s room. Mum had reacted instantly, flying up the stairs at a rate faster than I thought she could move. I readied myself, waiting for Michael’s door to fly open. I heard a brief movement as Mum must have gone to check her own room first, and then-  
*CRASH*\- Michael’s door flew open, wood splintering out of the handle. I saw a brief glimpse of Mum’s cruel, excited face, and had time to register the sharp tool in her hand, before I swung Michael’s cricket bat as hard as I could at her head. You see, Mum had clearly never bothered to give Michael a second thought again after they did whatever they did to him, but I had. I remembered his love of cricket, the way he was obsessed with watching it and playing it, and I remembered the bat that had been kept in his dusty old room. I sometimes went in there when I missed him, and the quick memory of his room, kept intact all those years, had saved my life. Mum flew backwards as if shot out of a cannon, back cracking against the landing rails, and slumped to the floor, blood streaking down her face. She lay where she was and didn’t move.   
Not caring if i’d killed her or not, I hurriedly scooped up the knife from where she’d dropped it, and ran downstairs. I entered the kitchen in a state of panic, still trying to think about how I could free Michael, when I remembered. Mum’s keys. Her and Dad were always so protective over their keys, and I vividly recalled a screaming match in the supermarket when she thought she’d lost them. At the time, still being a child, I didn’t understand, but it suddenly made sense to me. I rushed outside, opening the front door to go and search her handbag in the car, when I saw the keys sticking out of the lock on the front door. She’d been in such a hurry to kill me that she hadn’t bothered to take them with her. I ran through the house again, mind racing, blood pumping. I got out to the shed where I was glad to see Michael was waiting, watchful and fearful. I sorted through the set of keys until I matched them, and unclipped his chains. Putting an arm around my shoulder to support him as he stood up, we moved slowly out of the shed. His whole body weight was so light, I could have almost carried him. We made it out into the garden and turned towards the house, when I nearly dropped Michael. Standing at the back doors, fury and hatred radiating from her, face matted in blood, was Mum.   
“Going somewhere?” she hissed, eyes fixed on us. I felt Michael begin to quiver, and anger coursed through me. It was only then that I realised I didn’t have the knife on me. I must have dropped it in my panic, because it was now in the hand of the woman staring at us, thirsting to kill us. She grinned; a monstrous, evil leer that chilled me to the bone. She held up the knife and pointed it dramatically at us.   
“Who’s going to go fir-'' she stopped. She cocked her head like a dog, listening to the ever louder sound of sirens descending on our house. They were a street away, maybe less. What happened next changed everything. It must have taken her no time at all to make her mind up. She grasped the knife firmly, and then plunged it directly into her own stomach. She let out a gasp of pain as she staggered backwards, knife in almost up the hilt, eyes bulging wildly. She backed into the kitchen table and sank to the ground, where she began to scream.   
“HELP ME! HELP!”. I took a moment to let my body absorb the shock of what had just happened, and then pieced it all together. My fingerprints were on that knife. They’d also be on the cricket bat covered in her blood. It’d be my word against hers. I didn’t know how much talking Michael was capable of, and in any case even staying and calmly trying to explain would result in us being separated, even temporarily. I wasn’t about to let that happen. Who knows what Mum and Dad would be capable of, even if it was from hospital? Brain ticking wildly, I swung Michael and I around and made for the bottom of the garden. There was a small gap which brought us out into an alleyway. If I could get clear, if we could get down to the end of that alleyway, I'd be a street away from where i’d parked my car. I hadn’t brought it to the house because I liked a bit of a walk to help boost my steps for the day. Thanking the overpriced gadget on my wrist for guiding my decisions, I supported Michael all the way, until we got to the car. I helped him into the front seat and rushed round to get in the driver’s side. Driving off, I had to think of our next options.   
All of that happened nine months ago. As predicted, Mum used the whole situation to her advantage, and a wide net was cast to try and find Sarah Bauer, the 25 year old who’d tortured and kidnapped her brother, and attempted to kill her own mother. The news told of how I'd kept my parents constantly living in fear by threatening to kill Michael, how I was a psychopath, how I’d lured my Mum away from the house to see my ill father so I could disappear with my brother. Unfortunately the last part was actually true, and poor Tors, who’d just been trying to help, was arrested and charged with being an accessory to a crime. The police swallowed my Mum’s lies wholeheartedly, and the manhunt for me was intense. I used the short window between escaping from the house and my face hitting the news to withdraw all my savings, buy a cheap car in cash, and stock up on medical supplies and food, whilst me and Michael headed North. We needed to come up with a plan, and one that involved us not being separated. I never wanted to let him out of my sight again. We eventually reached a remote Scottish village, where I decided we could stop and reassess. An attempted murder of a parent, and torture and kidnap of a now 28 year old man were juicy news, but they weren’t quite ‘live under a rock for the rest of your life’ levels of infamy, so after a quick hair dye and some creative makeup work, I was able to go out in public. Michael couldn’t however, he was deformed. I’d ditched all of my electronics so I had to buy a medical journal from a local bookshop, and use my best guesses to tend to his wounds. We rented a small bedsit, paid a year up front in cash, and bunkered down together, Michael in the bed and me on the sofa.   
We lived like that for six months, Michael’s strength slowly starting to return, despite the fact he was almost wasted away by the time i’d got him out of there. I chanced the opportunity to buy papers whenever I went to get food for us, and my oh-so-delightful parents, both now out of hospital and on the road to recovery, seemingly didn’t miss an opportunity to come up with some new revelation about how cruel I’d been, even as a young child. Michael spoke in bits and pieces here and there, but he was very silent on any insane motive our parents could have had for doing this to him, and he seemingly didn’t want to talk about it. I’d gone out to get some food one Wednesday when something caught my eye in the window of the same bookshop I’d bought the medical journal from. It was a thick black hardback book, with the title embossed in gold and a sullen looking photo on the front. A photo of my parents. My head swam as I read the title:   
‘*PARENTS OR PRISONERS? THE ANDREW AND LUCY BAUER STORY*’.   
Rushing back to the flat, I burst in full of anger and rage. Michael shrank back from me a little bit. He didn’t like loud noises or me raising my voice, which was understandable given what he’d been through, and served to calm me down a bit.  
“Whaaaass roooong?” he drawled, his absence of lips making diction impossible.   
“The monsters, the absolute fucking monsters!” I shook, unable to believe what i had seen. “They’ve written a book! All about how i’m a parent terorrising, brother torturing maniac!. The *fuckers*!”. I put the kettle on as a reflex, thinking i’d make myself a cup of tea and calm down a bit. I needed to see that book, I needed to read their lies. I was just debating whether to go back out and buy it when I saw Michael scribbling something on a piece of paper. He shuffled over to me and put a clumsy, comforting hand on my shoulder. I looked at him in his one good eye, which was filled with tears.   
“Iss time you knew” he said, his hand clenching on my shoulder tighter. I looked at the piece of paper he’d handed me, to see one sentence written in a childlike scrawl which had never developed past the age of nine, spelling mistakes and all. 

  
‘Their not our reel mum and dad’.
