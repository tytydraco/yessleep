I found myself walking on the road with no memory. I didn't even remember my name. It was just me all alone in the middle of nowhere at night. The night was chilling cold and the surrounding was filled with fog. Through the haze of fog, I saw yellow light coming from a lartain. When I saw the face of a lady holding it, I was completely mesmerised by her beauty. It felt like her beauty froze the time for me. She was the most gorgeous woman I have ever laid my eyes on. I looked into her eyes for hours. She stood there still and didn't even speak a single word. Then she forwards her hands and crooked her fingers against her palm while nodding her head as if she were calling me. She turned around and started walking and I started following her. I am not 100% sure what struck me but I started asking her questions like "Miss who are you? Where the hell are we going, and who am I? How I ended up here ?''.

After a few minutes of walking, she suddenly disappeared into the haze. I looked around and saw a river in front of me. She was sitting there on a boat and making hand gestures calling me. I am not sure if it was her or not since half of her face was covered with an opaque veil. I took a step forward and then thought it wouldn't be safe to go on the boat with a stranger in such a remote area. She came out of the boat and stood there completely silent in front of me. She gave me a pendant which was shaped like a rose. It had her picture inside.

She started walking away from me and again disappeared into a haze. I was standing there, still and silently thinking about her. I was still very much awestruck by her mesmerising beauty when I suddenly heard noises and people shouting and coming towards me.l They were looking at someone lying on the ground. I came forward and saw the face of a person lying on the ground. The face looked very familiar but I was unable to recognise who he was. I tried to ask people what was going on but everybody was ignoring me as if I didn't exist. They looked like some tribal villagers. They carried the person's body while I followed them to their village but because of the crowd in the village, I lost it. I tried asking for help from other villagers but everybody ignored me as if they couldn't hear me or I never existed.

I started looking through the windows of huts and tents in the village and everybody pretended as if they couldn't see me. I can't believe my eyes what I saw afterwards. The man who was taken by the villagers was lying naked in the middle of a large circle and half of his body was covered with dark ink. Another guy came and cut the genitals of the man lying on the floor. Tiny disgusting worms that I had never seen before rolled out of his genitals. after that, they amputated his both middle fingers. While I was witnessing this horrific act I felt someone staring at me, and when I looked around it was the same lady who disappeared in front of the river was staring at me. She made the same hand gesture of calling me and it felt like she was the only one who could see me. Then she started running while giggling and I started chasing her like crazy. She ran into the dark woods and I kept chasing her unlit I fell into a ditch.

After this, I remembered nothing. I woke up in a hospital bed. I tried asking the nurse "How did I get here, and what things happened to me ?" The nurse didn't reply to me anything. When I went to the washroom I saw that my genitals were missing and noticed that both of my middle fingers were amputated. I  looked in the mirror and realised that I was the guy who the villagers amputated.

After I was discharged from the hospital I went receptionist and inquired about who admitted me into the hospital. He told me I was discovered unconscious in very bad condition by a lady in the woods. She immediately called the police and the hospital. He gave me the contact number and a copy of the police reports and told me to collect the rest of the details and information from the police station. They also gave me the address of the lady who admitted me to the hospital.

 I was told to collect my belongings before leaving the hospital which were some soiled clothes and a gold chain. The pendant on the chain was shaped like a rose and it had pictures of that woman in it.

A few days later I decided to go to the address of that woman who probably saved my life. I followed the address and reached an old isolated house in a remote wood. I rang the bell and an old man opened the door. I inquired about a woman who admitted me into the hospital. He told me, there was no woman in his house and he used to live alone. I saw a picture of a woman hanging on the wall and pointed out it and said "That's the woman who I saw last time before I woke up in the hospital''.  The old man said it was his wife who died in 1990.
