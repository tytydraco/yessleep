Joseph's phone rang in the middle of the night, jolting him awake. Groggily, he answered the call from an unknown number.

"Hello?" he said, his voice hoarse with sleep.

"Is this Joseph?" a voice on the other end asked.

"Yes," Joseph replied, rubbing his eyes. "Who is this?"

The voice asked a strange question about the layout of Joseph's house. Joseph thought it was odd, but he answered anyway, not thinking much of it.

Joseph had been haunted by the memory of that strange phone call for weeks. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about it, but he couldn't put his finger on what it was. Then, one night, he woke up to a sound that made his blood run cold. It was scratching at his bedroom door.

At first, Joseph thought it was his imagination. Maybe it was just a dream or a noise from outside. But the scratching continued, growing louder and more insistent. Joseph's heart raced as he realized that someone or something was trying to get into his room.

He lay frozen in his bed, too terrified to move. The scratching continued for what felt like an eternity, until finally, it stopped. Joseph waited in silence, his ears straining for any sound, but there was none.

The next morning, Joseph checked his bedroom door and found deep scratches in the wood. It looked like someone had been trying to claw their way through.

Joseph knew he had to do something. He installed cameras around his house, hoping to catch a glimpse of whoever or whatever was stalking him. But every time he reviewed the footage, there was nothing there. No sign of anyone or anything.

As the days went on, Joseph became more and more paranoid. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. Every time he left his house, he felt like he was being followed. He started to see strange figures in the corners of his vision, but when he turned to look, there was no one there.

Then, the photos started arriving. They were pictures of Joseph, taken from a distance. He couldn't see who had taken them, but he knew someone was watching him.

Joseph's fear grew to an unbearable level. He knew he had to find out who was behind all of this. He hired a private investigator, but even the investigator couldn't find anything concrete. It was like whoever was after Joseph was always one step ahead.

One night, Joseph woke up to find a figure standing at the foot of his bed. It was the same figure he had seen in his peripheral vision for weeks, but now it was right in front of him.

The figure was tall and shadowy, with glowing eyes that seemed to pierce Joseph's soul. Joseph tried to scream, but no sound came out. The figure simply stared at him for a long moment before disappearing into the darkness.

Joseph knew that he was going to die. He had felt it coming for weeks, and now it was here. He closed his eyes and waited for the end.

But when he opened them again, he was alive. The figure was gone, and Joseph was alone in his room. He couldn't explain what had happened, but he knew that he had been given a second chance.

The next day, Joseph received a package in the mail. Inside was a note that read, "You got lucky this time. But I'm still watching." Joseph knew that he had to leave his house and never look back.

He sold the house and moved far away, hoping to leave the nightmare behind. But he knew that the figure was still out there, watching and waiting for its next victim. Joseph had escaped with his life, but he knew that he would never truly be free from the horror that had stalked him for so long.
