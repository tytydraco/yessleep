I’ve not lived on this farm all my life. I don’t expect to live here much longer, but that’ll make sense later. To set a scene for y’all, I live down bout 15 miles outside of Odessa. No more info bout that, I know what you online type are like. My Pa and I live alone with our dog Roscoe, who I love to death. We ain’t had real company since Mom passed way back when, but let me tell you, not a day goes by that I don’t miss her. Anyways, the farm’s magnificent, not plagued by the suburban lights like Michigan, and the nights are particularly special. When you look up, you really feel like an ant, small and useless when faced with the universe, but there is something peaceful about that. We got about fifty bison on the farm, nothing major but they do help us get by, another source of income along with the shop Pa works at. I do my share of work and have really taken a liking to the gentle giants. 

Now, I want y’all to know I’m the superstitious type, I enjoy the thought of a skinwalker stumbling across our farm, could be fun to fight an inhuman creature, ya’ know? So you can imagine my slight curiosity when one of the bison ended up dead, but this was soon replaced by a thick sense of dread. We call our bison either Bert’s or Bessie’s  , Berts are the males, and the females are the Bessies. This bert wasn’t killed in any typical fashion. It ain’t a common occurrence in general to find one dead, much less in these circumstances, and worst of all, his body had no signs of decay. This was recent, real recent.

Bert was dry. Now I don’t mean in a sickly manner from an infection or disease, like when one of the herd refuses to eat, he was deflated. Something had torn into his sides, gorging itself on his blood, his intestines lay in a sickly pile and I could see the broken ribs and stomach bile caking the ground in a crimson pool. Something had torn into my boy with malice, fang marks clearly visible on his nape in a circular fashion. He had been overpowered. 

“Holy shit.” I stammered through dry lips.

In my seven years on the farm, I had seen several bison killed by wolves or bears, but never to this extent. This Bert was a strong one. When we do get the rare instance of an attack, it’s the calves and runts of the herd, never a good ol’ boy like this one. An animal couldn’t have done this, or at the very least, not one hunting for prey. 

I ran back to the house to get Pa, he had to see this. Returning a few minutes later with Roscoe tagging along, Pa studied the corpse and stood silent for a time, but I couldn’t get a read on his feelings.

“Well, this sure as shit ain’t a normal killing.” His statement broke the silence. Didn’t know Pa was a genius. 

“What you think could’ve done this?” I asked, looking for any more abnormalities.

“Well, back in the day, before I met your mother, Grandpa found a cow mauled in a similar nature. Figured it was a rabid pack of wolves, but as for the blood loss? Your guess is good as mine, maybe a crazy possum.” He simply stated, eyes boring into the oval-shaped markings on the neck. 

Pa always had lived on a farm so for now, I took his word on it. We couldn’t leave an animal this powerful and vicious out there so we made up a plan. This afternoon, Pa, Roscoe, and I would take the .375 Ruger, a beautiful rifle with enough stopping power for a grizzly, and blast this sick bastard back to hell’s gate. 

Our property was large, and everywhere you looked there were dips and peaks of hills and dry grass everywhere. We knew that a mile or two out, some streams converged into what you could call a river but had never bothered walking out there as few trails interrupted the nature out here and we decided it best to keep out. 

We geared up with a couple of flashlights in a bag along with some snacks, headlamps, water, and ammunition. Roscoe perked up and ran wild, bursting with the excitement of leaving the house again (He’s an inside dog with a love for the out). Being a tiny beagle, his looks didn’t come close to his bravery and it was my job to chase after him when he caught the scent of a hare or different critter.

Setting out at three in the afternoon, we figured we’d have more than enough time to make it back before dark. We’d never taken a true look at the property through and through, since Pa had arthritis and couldn’t walk the best, and we decided there could be some sign of what committed the atrocity. 

“We taking the north path or the west?” I asked, the warm autumn air blanketing me.  

“West. If an animal got in, that’s where we’ll find them” As the west was the only section of the fence short enough to get around. 

I complied and we walked on, reaching the trail head when we noticed something on the ground. It looked an awful lot like a leash, but the rope was weathered and attached to the end, were the remnants of a collar. The collar had torn away, leaving behind a strip of leather with teeth in it. Not human teeth, we could tell that much but teeth nonetheless. 

“Pa, what kind of a person puts teeth on a collar?” I said, bringing it in for a closer look. 

“One with a pet I reckon” He voiced with the same flat, slightly sarcastic tone I had heard all my life.

It wasn’t the most unusual thing we’d ever found on the property. One time we even found a human femur, but nothing important came from that. I dropped the collar on the ground and we carried on, thinking it was either someone’s crudely made project or an artifact from another time. How I wish it was the former. 

Roscoe didn’t pick a scent up from the collar, and we continued on for half an hour before we came across some tracks. They were like the ones we’d find within the barn, rats. Larger by far than any normal rat we’d ever seen. Our feet had room to move inside of the print and we started considering that whatever was out here, might be best left alone. Roscoe still couldn’t pick up a solid trace, which should’ve been an easy task. After carrying on for a few long minutes, we reached an area where the grass obscured any prints and we had no choice but to turn around. 

By now, twilight had set in but we were well prepared for such an event and brought out our headlamps. We weren’t too far but when we were within an hour of the house, we started to hear a grating whistle. It started as a whisper in the wind, barely audible but became more pronounced as the night crawled on. Roscoe had begun acting agitated by the sound and my heart seemed to agree with the dog’s. Something was off. 

“Pa, what the fuck is that?” I couldn’t contain myself anymore.

“If I gave you an answer, it would be a lie. We’re going back and calling the Wildlife Department tomorrow. For now, keep walk-” As the words came out, his bad ankle fell into a burrow at a sharp angle, and the snap sounded horrific through the silence. 

He cried out and I ran to him and he started rolling his pant leg up to assess the damage. I took my headlamp off and helped him pull the rest up, seeing the mishappen ankle, bone almost piercing skin. 

“Broken. Should’ve been watching the ground. Now help me off my ass so we can get out of here” He raised his hand for help and I was about to throw his arm over my back for support when I noticed something.

Roscoe hadn’t come to Pa’s side yet. Surely, I thought, he would’ve darted over when he heard Pa’s cry, yet I couldn’t make him out in front of us, where he had been. At this point, I had noticed the whistling was now gone, nothing but silence. When I turned around, I noticed him standing still as a post, staring at the form approaching us. It was close, so fucking close, couldn’t have been more than ten feet. I couldn’t make a form out in the grass, but Pa must’ve since moments later he pushed me forward. 

“DON’T STAND THERE, GO!” he bellowed at me as I saw the thing leap towards him.

This next part is hard to talk about but I’ll give the account to the best of my ability. As Pa turned to face the creature, struggling to get the rifle off of his shoulder, his headlamp illuminated it for the first time. It had the face of a horse, but there was a mouth replacing  where the nose should’ve been. It was an oval-shaped pit of teeth, like a leech, with rows of thin daggers circling down the throat. Its eyes were inky black pools of nothingness. Its body was, as best as I could describe it, like a kangaroo’s. At the end of the arms were these massive claws, and its feet were just like a rodent's. It had no fur and looked like a hairless dog, the legs had an obvious power to them, and I could barely make out a forked tail in the back. The last thing I managed to see was a torn strip of leather, stabbing into its neck with a human touch to it. The collar. 

I saw all of this within a second, as it flew through the air towards my father. All I smelled was blood. There was no animalistic scent to pair with it, even from a mere four feet away. As it knocked into my father, it started to tear into him. His headlamp lit up its claws as they entered his mouth and tore down, ripping through his jaw, throat, all the way down to his ribs. It just tore into him and I saw his body split open, a mess of organs, bone, and muscle. The power in it’s leg must’ve been astounding in itself since as it turned to feast on his lower body, it brought its leg down through Pa’s skull and it exploded, the ground now a mess of brain matter and skull fragments. The headlamp was crushed too, and the area was plunged into darkness 

This jump-started my brain and freed me from the paralysis that had overtaken my mind. This couldn’t happen. I hadn’t fully collected myself by the time I started to book it in the opposite direction, and my mind was still clouded as I sprinted through the field, up the hills, and all the way to the house, not ever fully taking in what had truly gone down. I passed out from either exhaustion or fear, probably a mixture. 

I’m typing this as the police are on their way. I can’t, I don’t, I won’t process this. It’s impossible to even think bout what I saw in that field. I’ll update you as soon as I can. I can finally hear the sirens. Pray for me, and if ANYONE can bring me some comfort, advice, anything, now’s a good a time as any.
