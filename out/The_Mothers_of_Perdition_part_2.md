I work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it to make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building we found a secret room! And guess what was in it? More books! I even found a journal from Sean. After reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.

I hated living in New Brunswick. I had moved here the summer before grade 1 and was now in grade 3. I was 8, it was 2001.

New Brunswick was a woodsy place with not much to do and I couldnâ€™t stand living here. We used to have a pool and live beside a park in huge city in Toronto, and this was such a downgrade. We had no pool, and were just planted in the middle of the suburbs, with no stores in walking distance.

The alleged upgrade was that we had a camp that my mother insisted on dragging us too most weekends. I hated it out there even more than in the city. 

Then not long after we moved here Dora up and died. We still had to go to the damn camp every weekend though. The loons sounded like wolves and it always creeped me out. Even swimming in the summer was creepy. My parents said there was eels in the water. Even Carl was creepy. 

School had started last week and thankfully this weekend we didn't get dragged out to the camp. I was at my friend Wilburs place for the weekend, me him and Arik were having a sleepover on saturday night. We were going to play videogames and swim in Wilburs blowup pool.

His dog Six sat there barking at Arik with fangs barred.

Arik looked suspicious and looked to Wilburs father. "Why is the dog named Six?"

Wilbur's father made an awful scowl "I named him that when I completed the six pack." He then looked to wilbur with reverence in his eyes. "Some day there will be a passing of the torch, from father to son, and Wilbur will start a six pack of his own."

Arik eyed him suspiciously "Completed the six pack? What does that mean?"
Wilburs father looked at him an awful scowl "When I drank a six pack of beer  all at once of course."

Wilbur scowled as well "When I start my own six pack I wonder who will be with me?" Looking from me to Arik and back.

Arik looked stunned. "My dad only drinks on the weekends."

Everyone looked to me and I blurted out "My father drinks a six pack every night."

"Good man" said Wilburs father as wilbur barreled towards the pool.

Wilbur was fat and had huge manboobs. He climbed the ladder and let out an awful warcry "WAH!" he screamed at the top of his lungs. He then did a bellyflop into the pool.

His mother came out of the house wit ha scowl on her face. "Wilbur wheatly!" She screamed. "I'm trying to sleep in here!"

I then joined Wilbur in the pool and we swam and pretended we were in the matrix.

We played in the pool until sundown, and then went inside and played super smash bros on N64.

When we went to bed that night I couldn't sleep. Both the other boys lay there asleep as I looked out the window.

We were out in the country and all was quiet. I got a creepy feeling as I heard Six bark, breaking the silence.

'You know Wilbur's old man is a serial killer right? That's why the dog is named Six, six victims.' I heard a voice in my head loud and clear.A black dragon head appeared and circled around my vision.

'Don't listen to him! He's a liar!' another voice chimed in. A red dragon head appeared, writhing and moving around what I could see.

I had never been so scared in my life I wanted to scream, but I just couldn't.

'Hold it together kid! I'm not here to scare you.' The black dragon head said.

'He's a liar! Wilbur's father is saint!' The red dragonhead screamed. 'I'm the angel on your shoulder, and he's the devil on your shoulder!'

'He's the liar Sean! All those anime shows you watch about the power of friendship have poisoned your mind. These people arn't your friends! They are traitors, only your friend until the wife can't get preggo and it's time for a fertility ritual.' The black dragon head mused.

I suddenly regained control of myself  and screamed at the top of my lungs. "Dragons are after me! DRAGONS are after me!"

Josh and Arik both woke up along with his parents. They all came into the room and waited for me to explain. After I had explained everything Wilbur's father proposed a solution.

"Saren talks to us all Sean, he is a good wise dragon. Follow him and banish the evil black dragon, that is what must be done. Simply obey the red head and ignore the black one. The angel is the one who you must follow if you wish to find salvation" He said softly but firmly.

I went back to bed and was not bothered by either head. We woke up the next day and everything was just kind of tense.

When I went home my parents had a present for me. A very nice silk, red dragon shirt. I thought about what Wilbur's father had said. The red dragon must be the good one I thought to myself.

It was Sunday and I had a doctors appointment. Me and my mother drove there and I thought about wearing my new shirt to school tomorrow.

When we got there we sat in doctor King's office. I played with the toys and when it was our time he inspected my groin region. I had a number of moles above my pelvis. There were 3 large ones in some kind of pattern.

Doctor king inspected the moles and looked with disgust at my penis.

'He's not after the map kid' I heard the black dragon say.

Doctor king made an awful scowl and looked at my foreskin. "This one is unclean. He has not been circumsized. Hold him down, woman. This can not be allowed"

My mother grabbed me and held me there while doctor king grabbed some short stout scissors. He grabbed my foreskin streatching it out.

'Kill' The black dragonhead commanded.

My arm cracked like whip and I hit the scissors out of the doctors hand. I turned and sunk my teeth into my mothers arm. She screamed and let go. I jumped off the table and headed for my pants.

"GET BACK HERE" they both commanded.

I stared at doctor king with blood dripping from my mouth. "OVER MY COLD DEAD BODY" I screamed and pulled up my pants.

On the car ride home my mother talked about how my father would beat me. She said that he had a belt and something about it being grandfathered in. 

When we got home he made a joke about her being a dick chopper and put her in her place. 

The next day when I was getting ready for school I heard the black dragon head again.
'Sean, this school thing is more lies than truth. Your grandfather got rich and he dropped out in the third grade 3.' It said.

'What are you telling me?' I thought.

'Just that today you can go to school, and get lied too or you can stay home and watch TV and see history unfold. ' It said. 

'You want me to jig school? Are you the good dragon or th bad dragon' I asked.
just then the red dragon head appeared 'I'm the good dragon! Look what a nice shirt I got you! I'm clearly the angel and he's the devil.'

'Liar!' The black dragon head scolded.

'Go to school and show your friends your cool shirt Sean. You know it's the right thing to do. Jigging shool is for outcasts and loners. Do you want to be that?'
I thought about it while I got ready and decided to go to school.

When I got there everyone was giving me compliments on my shirt and the ladies especially seemed really nice.

We sat down as class was about to start and the teacher came in sobbing.

"You know when I first started teaching we used to watch the news in class sometimes. I was in a room full of kids when space shuttle challenger exploded right in front of our eyes." She sobbed.

The kids in the room looked around, clearly thinking there was something up.

Class then began and the teachers assistant started talking Hiroshima and Nagasaki. She read eyewitness accounts of people who were in the blast radius of the atomic bombs thee Americans dropped there.

At recess I went to the playground and started searching for my friends when the red dragon head appeared again.

'See Sean? Everyone loves your shirt like they love me. Everyone down here loves me' The redhead said.

'Like your wife loved you?' The black dragon cackled and then appeared.

The red head started screeching in rage. 'How fucking dare you Nibiru! Spread awful lies about me!?'

'Yeah Sean, Saren is no more female than you, but I am. I didn't eat my fucktoy you see-' Nibiru cackled.

'I'll eat you!' the head screetched and lunged at Nibiru.

I looked around the playground. Clearly no one else could see these things. Had I totally lost me mind?

The black head spoke again. 'No Sean your mind has been poisoned by the lies taught to you in school. No magic? That's something an evil sorcerer would teach someone so they didn't know when a spell was cast on them. And that is what this dragon does Sean, tries to curse people dumb enough to watch his curses that masquerade as entertainment. Video-games are safer now, but this is early for them and they will not be for long.'

'You curse people too you scoundrel! Don't deny it!' the red head barked.
'No I eat who I want. I don't need to curse people. Thats his game. Hey Sean? Want some more proof the Japanese are trying to kill your culture and take your lives for what America did to them in world war 2? Look at the fucking NES. It designed to fucking break after a couple years. And yeah the famicom doesn't do this.' Nibiru spoke directly too me.

'So my NES is going to break? What about my N64?' I asked him.

'The N64 is fine he responded but be careful with that NES though. These japanese are all evil sorcerers you see. They tried to make a curse that would actually kill you when the thing shits out. IT would have worked if the graphics weren't so primitive. Even so there is one game that can kill you so don't ever play Star Tropics 2. I'm warning you that is not a fun way to go, what that game does too you. EW.' Nibiru monologued.

I was crying inside. I couldn't stop playing videogames. What if this dragon was right?

'Like kid this is actually the golden age of games. Play your heart out before they get really dangerous. Here I'll give you some recomendations. Conker's bad fur day is my favorite game these people ever make. I'll get you a copy soon. Since you love videogames isn't that a better gift then some cursed shirt? I'm going to have to take that from you. Consider the game my condolences.' He monologued.

'Thats mean', I responded in my head. And then came to my senses. 'Actually thats a fair deal mr Nibiru' I continued.

'Sean I'm going to be covering for you, watching your ass your whole life and this dragon has no other goal but to eat you.' Nibiru said menacingly. 'Unfortunately we need to cover your ass right now. If we don't tell people about the fail-safe they will murder you because of it.'

I was terrified. All this talk of murder from these dragons was really getting to me.
Nibiru continued. 'You see Sean I'm not like Saren. Being eaten by a dragon is one of the worst ways you can go. But being burned by one? That's a mercy killing in comparison. And that is what I'm going to do to these people. But it's a game you see? I'm not allowed to turn the sky red, or disable peoples ability to die, or anything really scary while your still here. And that's the thing, every time I save you I'm going to kill someone you know in your place. I'm going to kill like 5 people when you're in high-school alone. So just don't let them get you before you lay down the law' He said forcefully.

I gulped in fear. 'When do I Tell them?'
'Oh you'll know kid. Anyway Sean. Your teacher wouldn't tell you, but every other grade 3 and above class got briefed on the situation today. But you got jipped by your awful lieing teacher. Go ask that girl from the other class what I did today' Nibiru said.

'Your going to kill everyone? Your a bad dragon!' I yelled.

'Told you so!' The red dragon sneered.

'Jesus kid. Between your parents and all the awful media you're consuming you'll probably get dementia by 40, if you don't smarten the fuck up you little brat.' Nibiru scolded.

'Go away Nibiru!' I thought to myself.

Nibiru scoffed. 'Kid your angry because everyone you have ever met in this life has lied through their teeth to you and you simply can't handle the truth. Think about Neo in that matrix movie you like so much. Does he believe the lies he was taught in school?'

'What are you trying to tell me' I asked.

'Allahu akbar, death to the infidels. I don't care what these people call me these days. Allah, Shiva, Nibiru. These names mean nothing to me. I understand that the only thing these people understand is fear. All I care about is that these people pay for their crimes. These so called Musilms, that you don't like you racist little fuck. Yeah I'm giving out free tickets to wrath today. Go, ask that girl what I did.' Nibiru cackled.

I walked up to Katie and asked "What did the black dragon do?"

She looked at me like I had 7 goat heads and made an awful scowl. "Airplanes flew into the world trade center, they didn't get burned down by a dragon." She looked at her friends "I think Sean might have to go back to kindergarten."

Some kids cried, none laughed. Some gave Katie dirty looks.

I was dumbfounded. The dragons left after that and the teachers tried to pretend nothing was wrong until we went home.

When I arrived at home I saw both of my parents standing beside the TV. 

They got me and my brother Scott to watch the news as they explained what they thought had happened. I asked everyone I knew over the next couple of days if they had heard anything about a black dragon, but everyone thought I was just a kid playing with his imaginary friends.

My life resumed, and everything seemed the same, but somehow different. My parents said we weren't going to be able to travel as much anymore because of the restrictions on planes.

I am a monk who lives at a monastery in rural Tennessee. I wrote the preceding story when a black dragon told me that if I did not, that I would be sent to the lake of fire. I have written this here so please Nibiru have mercy on my soul!
