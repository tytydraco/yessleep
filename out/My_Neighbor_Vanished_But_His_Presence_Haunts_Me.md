It all started on an ordinary morning, just like any other. I was sipping my coffee on the front porch, enjoying the quiet of our suburban neighborhood, when I noticed something strange. My next-door neighbor, Mr. Thompson, who I waved to every morning, wasn’t outside. He was a creature of habit, always out at precisely 7:30 AM, trimming his hedges or tending to his garden. But today, his yard was eerily still.

At first, I shrugged it off. Maybe he was running late, or perhaps he had an appointment. But as the days passed, the absence of Mr. Thompson became more unsettling. His mail began to pile up, and his garden, usually immaculate, started to look neglected.

On the fourth day, curiosity got the better of me. I knocked on his door, the sound echoing unnervingly in the silent air. There was no answer. I tried the doorbell, but still nothing. Concerned, I peered through the windows but saw no sign of movement inside. The house seemed untouched, frozen in time.

I decided to call the police, but they didn’t seem too concerned. "He’s probably gone on a trip," they said. "People forget to inform their neighbors all the time." Their lack of urgency only heightened my anxiety. Mr. Thompson was a solitary man, no family to visit, no close friends to call on. It didn’t make sense for him to just disappear.

A few nights later, as I lay in bed, I heard faint noises coming from Mr. Thompson’s house. It was a sort of soft rustling, like someone moving around quietly. I bolted upright, heart pounding. Grabbing a flashlight, I went outside. The night was unnaturally quiet, the air heavy with an inexplicable sense of dread. I crossed the lawn and pressed my ear against his door. The sounds were clearer now, unmistakably coming from inside. Someone was in there.

I tried the door again, and to my surprise, it creaked open. The house was dark, and a musty smell hit me as I stepped inside. My flashlight beam cut through the darkness, revealing a perfectly normal-looking living room. Everything was in its place, as if Mr. Thompson had just stepped out for a moment.

But then I saw it. On the mantle was a photo of Mr. Thompson, only it wasn’t just him. There were other people in the photo, people who looked strangely familiar. I realized with a jolt that they were previous residents of the house, people I’d seen in old neighborhood photos. They looked exactly the same as they had decades ago.

A chill ran down my spine. What was going on here? My heart raced as I ventured further into the house. The faint rustling grew louder, leading me to the basement door. I hesitated, but a morbid curiosity pushed me forward. I had to know.

The basement stairs creaked under my weight, the air growing colder with each step. At the bottom, the flashlight beam revealed an old, dust-covered workbench and shelves lined with jars of strange, preserved specimens. The rustling was louder now, almost a whispering sound, like voices just out of reach.

I turned the corner and froze. There, in the dim light, stood Mr. Thompson. But something was terribly wrong. His eyes were vacant, staring straight through me, and his skin had a ghastly pallor. He didn’t move, just stood there, as if waiting for something.

I backed away slowly, my mind racing. Suddenly, the whispering grew louder, the voices overlapping in a cacophony of unintelligible murmurs. The flashlight flickered, and in the brief moments of darkness, I saw shapes moving around me, fleeting shadows in the periphery of my vision.

Panicking, I turned and ran up the stairs, bursting out of the house and slamming the door behind me. I stood on the porch, breathing heavily, my mind struggling to make sense of what I had just seen. The night was silent again, but the sense of dread lingered, clawing at the edges of my sanity.

In the following days, I tried to avoid thinking about that night. But the image of Mr. Thompson’s vacant stare haunted me. I began noticing things out of the corner of my eye, fleeting shapes and shadows that vanished when I looked directly at them. The whispers never fully left me, always just a little too faint to understand.

One evening, as I was preparing for bed, I heard a knock at my door. My heart leaped into my throat. I opened it slowly, peering out into the dark. No one was there. But as I stood there, I felt a cold presence slip past me, into the house.

I turned back, the whispering growing louder, surrounding me. The shadows moved closer, and I felt their icy touch on my skin. I realized then that whatever had taken Mr. Thompson was now here for me. The door creaked shut behind me, the lock clicking into place.
