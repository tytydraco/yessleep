My name is Seiji, a 22-year-old man. I had always been a bit of a skeptic when it came to the supernatural. Growing up in Japan, I had heard countless stories about ghosts and spirits, but I never really believed in them. That is, until I met him.

His name was Kato, and he was a Japanese soldier from World War 2. He had been killed in battle and his spirit had remained trapped in our world, full of rage and resentment.

I first encountered Kato one night when I was walking home from a late shift at the restaurant where I worked. I heard a faint voice calling out to me, and when I turned around, there was Kato, standing there in his old military uniform, his face is distorted, twisted with anger.

I tried to run, but it was like my feet were stuck to the ground. Kato approached me, his eyes boring into mine and I knew that I was in serious trouble.

"You don't belong here," he spat at me. "I will make you pay for what you've done."

I had no idea what he was talking about, but I knew that I had to get away from him. I tried to run again, but it was like I was moving in slow motion. Kato reached out and touched me, and suddenly, I felt an overwhelming sense of dread wash over me.

I woke up the next morning feeling disoriented and confused. I had no memory of what had happened the night before, but I knew that something was off. I felt like I was being watched, and every time I turned around, there was nothing.

As the days went on, things only got worse. I started to see and hear things that weren't there, and I couldn't shake the feeling that Kato was inside of me, controlling my actions. My parents noticed the change in my behavior but they had no idea what was causing it. I knew that I had to do something about Kato before it was too late.

One night, I was walking home from work when suddenly, everything went black. When I regained my consciousness, I saw my parents on the floor, brutally murdered with my bare hands. 

I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I had no memory of killing them, but the evidence was right in front of me. I knew that Kato had taken over my body, using me as a vessel to seek revenge on those who he felt had wronged him.

I couldn't live with the guilt and the knowledge that I had been responsible for the deaths of my own parents. I knew that I had to put an end to this haunting, no matter what it took.

I knew that I had to turn myself in and face the consequences for what I had done. But as I sat in the police station, confessing to the murders, I couldn't shake the feeling that Kato was still with me, watching and waiting for his next chance to take control.

I was haunted by the ghost of a Japanese soldier, and I knew that I would never be able to escape him.
