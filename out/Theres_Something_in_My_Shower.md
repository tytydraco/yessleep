I shower a lot. Or, at least I used to. My city gets pretty humid, and I live in a crappy apartment with no air conditioning. Add those two things together, and you get a lot of cold showers. A guy’s gotta keep cool somehow, right?

In the middle of June, I took a trip back to my hometown to visit family. It was nice to see everyone–plus, my parents have a great HVAC system. All in all, I was dreading coming back to the city. But I had no clue that what was waiting for me was so much worse than just a scorching apartment.

I arrived back in my city in the evening. Stepping through my front door, I was greeted by stifling heat. Immediately, I felt sweat starting to bead on my forehead, and my mind went straight to the shower. Without even stopping to turn on the lights, I set my bags down and made my way down the hallway. 

At the end of the hall, I entered the small room on my right–the bathroom. I got in the shower as fast as I could and turned on the water. I heard a rattling sound, and the water began to sputter out of the showerhead before reaching a steady stream. I didn’t think much of this at the time–just chalked it up to the fact I’d been gone for the week. Maybe the water pressure had to equalize or something? I’m not a plumber.

I was too busy enjoying the cool water to think about that anyways. I’d been in there for a few minutes when I felt it. Something wet touched my leg. I know, I know–I’m in a shower, everything’s wet. This was different. This was something *solid*. The touch was light, almost imperceptible, but I felt it all the same. I spun around, turning towards the showerhead and drain. Nothing there. I shrugged it off as best I could, insisting to myself that it must have been my imagination. 

The next morning, I went to take my pre-work shower, having mostly forgotten about the little incident from the day before. But I felt it again. This time, there was no denying it. Something wet had touched my leg, more confidently than before. The texture of the thing was familiar, but I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. 

I forced myself to go to work, but found that I was completely unable to focus. That afternoon, I once again arrived home to an unbearably hot apartment, slick with sweat. This damn heat wave. Despite my hesitancy, which was quickly turning to fear, I knew I had to shower. So I came up with a plan: I would shower facing the drain, rather than turning my back to it like usual. Confident I’d be able to identify whatever was causing my problem, I stepped in the shower.

But my plan didn’t work. I was an idiot–I got shampoo in my eye. Instinctively, I shut my eyes, and felt that familiar sensation on my leg. What’s worse, I realized what the texture reminded me of: it felt like a fucking tongue. I decided that I’d had enough. I phoned my landlord, who, after a great deal of persistence on my end, agreed to come check the shower drain the next morning. 

That night was a sleepless one for me. I must have looked like shit, because when he got there the next morning, my landlord–who typically doesn’t seem to give a damn about his tenants–asked if everything was alright. I said it was fine, just that the drain was acting funny and that he needed to fix it. I’ll be the first to admit, I was kind of being an asshole about it. But can you blame me? 

About fifteen minutes later, he came out of my bathroom and told me everything was fine, that there didn’t seem to be anything abnormal with the drain at all. I just stared at him. Obviously everything *wasn’t* fine, but what am I going to tell him? That something in the drain keeps licking my leg? Still, I didn’t say anything, and my lack of appreciation must’ve pissed him off, because he left without saying a word. 

I was late for work by this point, but I didn’t care. I left my phone in the kitchen and went to the bathroom. I got on my knees in the shower and just stared down the drain. I don’t know what I expected to happen, but I need answers. And in the end, I got them.

I’d been staring down the drain for maybe ten minutes when I saw it. It started as a dim yellow slit running horizontal through the dark circle of the drain. The slit expanded until it became a full, familiar circle. A fucking eyeball. A big one, too. It almost looked human, but was just too damn big. It quivered slightly as we made eye contact. Almost like it was excited. 

I scrambled out of the bathtub and slammed the bathroom door behind me. I refused to set foot in that room or even open the door after that. For days, I didn’t shower. Coworkers began to give me dirty looks and cringe when I approached them. But it didn’t matter to me. There was no way I was going back in the bathroom. 

I snapped on the sixth day. That morning, I emerged from my putrid bedroom after another near-sleepless night. I don’t know what it was, but something in me told me to look down the hallway toward the bathroom. What I saw stopped me in my tracks. The bathroom door was wide open. 

I don’t remember much of that day after that. I remember the intense, primal fear that drove me out of the house and to my car. I remember entering my apartment with the jerry can. I remember lighting the match. And I remember the sound of screeching tires as I drove to the last place I had felt safe.

I arrived at my parents’ house a little after dinnertime. They were surprised to see me–and more surprised at how rough I looked. I had barely slept over the last week, was hyperventilating, and probably smelled like garbage that had been left out in the sun. My mom encouraged me to take deep breaths and try to relax. After that, we could talk about what had happened and why I was back. A nice warm shower would do the trick, she told me.

My mom wouldn’t take no for an answer, and it probably wasn’t an option to decline anyway, given how I smelled. And honestly, the shower worked wonders. I felt the weight of the world lifting off my shoulders as I washed off a week’s worth of filth and grime from my body.

Then I felt something warm and wet wrap around my leg.
