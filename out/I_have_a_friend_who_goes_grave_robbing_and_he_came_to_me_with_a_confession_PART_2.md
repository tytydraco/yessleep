Since his [visit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/yuewqd/i_have_a_friend_who_goes_grave_robbing_and_he/), I have slept less and less.

My wife came home and immediately sensed something wrong. She knows what's up with Theo (the grave robbing part), yet I won't tell her about his visit. I'm just protecting her.

Because, let me tell you, since our talk, I can't help but feel this presence around. All the time.

Even in my sleep.

I had a dream that I was walking on a bridge. I couldn't see underneath, and every time I tried to look up, I got really nauseous. Suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned and saw Theo.

'Dan, this is dangerous if you're alone.'

'How?'

'I can't explain it to you fully. I just want you to trust me. You will suffer less.'

'Out of all my friends, why would you pick me? It's ridiculous.'

'I trust you. You make the call.'

I woke up before I could get to the end of the bridge. I turned to my wife, but she wasn't in bed.

Something was up. And the feeling of nausea had come back.

I stood up too fast and got dizzy, then sat on the bed.

Hearing footsteps in the dark is never reassuring.

I froze. That was not my wife, for the steps were too... rhythmic.

When in situations like these, one has two choices to make.

One: turn around and face whatever is there.

Two: ignore it and wait for it to get to you by itself.

I turned around.

For reference, my bedroom is pretty big. I was sitting on the bed, with my back turned to the hallway that has the dressing on one side and the door to the bathroom on the other, with the door to the main hallway at the very end.

I turned, and was greeted by this dark hallway, poorly lit by the moon.

My eyes adjusted, and my senses heightened. The door at the end was opened, and I could make out a silhouette. It looked almost normal, but something was off: was it the uncanny angle the arms seemed to make? Knees bent slightly off? Head a bit too long? I don't know. I couldn't put my finger on the flaw that made it inhuman.

Next to the silhouette, a pile of something. Clothes?

And what was the worse, what made my blood freeze, wasn't that thing, but my son.

He had woken up too, and was standing way behind that thing, in his bedroom doorframe, staring.

He saw my eyes, wide and glassy, drowned in terror. I was telling him to *Go to his room. Don't come out. Whatever you hear next.*

He slowly closed the door.

The silhouette did not move. I had to do something.

Now, what I did next was not very heroic or smart, but I figured: make noise.

So I screamed as loud as I could. I didn't even think I could scream like that.

The silhouette flinched, but again, the flinch was off. As if it had seen us, humans, do it, and wanted to copy it.

I screamed again. And again. I was sitting on my bed and just screaming. In another context, it would have been comedic.

The silhouette, then, walked out into the hallway. It hadn't turned, so was it walking backwards facing me, or had it been with its back to me (facing my son) the whole time? I don't know which was more terrifying.

It left. Through a window. I turned on the light.

*Where is my wife.*

The pile of clothes was a black coat.

What the fuck?

First thing. Check on kids.

They're fine.

Check on wife.

Didn't need to. She came running upstairs.

'What the fuck happened? What the fuck, Dan?'

She had heard my screams.

She explained, she had been in the kitchen because she couldn't sleep.

I told her everything. Her reaction was, of course, rational. Theo had gone mad and that could've either been him, threatening me, or one of his 'friends' to whom he owed his debts. Either way, we made one thing clear. We were going to move out. I was so sick at that point, that I went and puked. I just had this *awful* feeling. Something bad, *bad* was about to happen.

We didn't even wait. Packed essentials right up and drove to her mother, in the middle of the night.

&#x200B;

After this... um, *encounter,* the only thing I felt compelled to do was to seek a priest.

You know what the weirdest thing is? In horror movies, in books, anywhere, the main character, upon encountering *the evil,* feels repulsed, wants to get away from it, but it rarely feels... tied to it. I mean, it will seem crazy, but this darkness, these arts seemed to pull me closer. Was it curiosity? Or the desire to finish what somebody else had started?

I drove to one of the churches I used to go to as a child, and asked for Father Lewis, one of the priests that had watched me grow up and that also knew Theo.

Upon telling him the story, he remained silent for a while. I felt uncomfortable, and began to lose my patience, because he just wouldn't speak.

He broke the silence with a sigh.

'Daniel, I feel sorry for your friend. From what you've told me, he's already doomed. And I fear he may have led what is chasing him to you.'

'But are these real? The Rupture? The Wandering?'

'I wouldn't know for sure. I have always been oriented towards the Light, and never questioned or tried to draw a map of God's phenomenon. I don't deny their existence. Science and religion are tied together, but I value knowledge through revelation, not through study. I feel that whatever God wants me to know about His work, He'll show to me. The darker side, however, demons and what else lurks below, they give you this knowledge not because you deserve it, or because you have proved to be worthy of it, but because they want to make it your burden. They want to tie you to it, and to them. It weakens you, and then they take advantage of you. Since Theo consented to this stuff, I fear he lost himself.'

'The thing I saw... was it him?'

'I wouldn't know. Daniel, you say you let him inside?'

'Yeah, I mean, he's still my friend.'

Father Lewis took my hand in his. 'Be careful. It is very dark stuff you're dealing with. It's a chance something else entered your home along with him. Grave robbing is horrible, but what Theo did, that's just on another level.'

'Is there a way to get rid of him? Of this... presence? Or will it just haunt me forever?  Can you help?'

'I am not initiated in this dark science. However, if you want to work it out, you should go to someone specialized. Do you know people who buy antiques and sell them at auctions?'

'Why?'

'There's a special side of the market for people who look for... different antiques. Old books, tables, artifacts that are tied to certain cults or religious rituals. I suggest you seek one of them. They know a lot about what they're selling, the dark arts, and they could help you. But I advise you, don't go actively looking to know more than you need. Knowledge is power, but sometimes not *your* power.'

'And you think it will help me... understand how to protect myself from such happenings? Like, seeing stuff? The black coat? What did that even mean?'

The priest's expression was understanding, but I felt a strange undertone. Was it fear? Did he know something I didn't?

'Daniel, I don't mean to scare you.'

Well, that certainly couldn't be good.

'The black coat is a symbol of death.'

Hm.

'So will I die?'

'Let's not rush to conclusions. You don't know what it means. Signs often bring more mystery than they find.'

'That isn't very comforting.'

'I pray for you, boy. I pray for you and your family.'

'Thank you, Father.'

'Oh, and another thing.' He said, as I was leaving. 'I don't advise you to go back to your house until you know what to do. It's not yours anymore.'

My heart sank. My mind was so tired, that I couldn't feel an ounce of fear anymore, but I still understood the gravity of his words.

'I understand.'

Left without saying a word. I knew who to look for, my friend Jenna had this ex who hosted auctions. Once I had access to that field, I could easily find who I was interested in.

At first, I hadn't any determination to act, but after the dream and the encounter, I fear I'm already part of this charade. And passivity is not a solution anymore. I must seek a professional, and either get rid of Theo, or figure out how to cut ties completely. And I'm not talking about blocking him on my phone and moving houses, because I know that won't help. I need to do something more serious.

As I am turning on the engine, I can see something in my rear view mirror.

Watching.
