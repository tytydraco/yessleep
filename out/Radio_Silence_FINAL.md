Hi everyone, it's Billie here for the last post on here.

The day after Markus left I woke up to my parents knocking on my door rushingly, I sat up and they rushed inside telling me, there were some complications with the moving guys and they would be taking everything to the other house today instead of tomorrow. I grudgingly got up and rushed everything into the truck. They hugged me goodbye and told me I could stay with Markus today if I didn't want to drive all the way to the house at night. I told them I would let them know what I decided and waved them goodbye. I walked inside and sat on my bedroom floor, after a few minutes of sitting on my phone I figured I should go and say goodbye to Elijah since I would either be leaving tonight or tomorrow morning.

I drove to the apartment, typed in the passcode, and slowly walked up the stairs. When I made it to his apartment, I knocked and the door pulled in slightly. I pulled my phone out and called him, I could hear his phone ringing from the kitchen inside, the rings quietly echoing into the hall. I opened the door all the way to reveal a quiet dark apartment, the whole place was completely silent. I looked around, closing the door behind me.

“Elijah, you home.”

With no response, I walked further in, I looked to my right and saw his phone sitting on top of the table by the door, I picked it up, and when I did so I suddenly remembered the picture of the police report sitting there. Why would he have one, what was it for? I looked up at the small spiral staircase and slowly walked up. I looked at the pictures hanging in the hall. It looked like him and his family. I stopped at one. He was sitting at a table with someone, but I couldn't tell what they looked like, the face was too blurry. I stepped back taking in the pictures, He looked so happy in all of them. I looked back to the bedroom door and walked inside,  I saw his desk and went to it.

I looked through the drawer and found the folder hidden by a small pile of books. I pulled it out and flipped through it. The report my parents made about the animals on our porch, the report Markus’s mother made about the man who came to the door, my hospital visit, the missing person's report, The fire at the store,  the man in the woods Markus and I ran into the fire, and more missing persons from surrounding towns. I looked down at the papers confused, why would he have these? I bent down to the other drawers looking through them, but it was just random trinkets, nothing related. 

I looked back down at the folders and glanced at the little notes he had written. It was all scribbled so I could only make out a few words. For someone who was so put together, you would think he would write a little cleaner. I flipped through them, took some photos of the sticky notes and other contents of the folder, and put the report back in the drawer. I stood up and noticed the bathroom door, it was slightly open and I could see red, my heart sank and I rushed to the door.  I looked down at the floor in disgust, there were bloody napkins and towels piled on the floor. Dried blood covered the once-white tiles and sink. 

What the fuck happened in here?

I realized how creepy I was being and told myself I should be leaving, I turned to leave when something caught my eye. I looked back to the desk. On the highest shelf, there was a small black box with these gold designs on it. I walked over to it, picked it up, and slowly opened the lid. I looked inside, small white pieces of paper. I picked them up, they were thick, like stock paper. I pulled them out. I froze in my place…Photos. Photos I know too well. My hands began to shake, I flipped through them, pictures I’d seen pictures I hadn’t, then I saw pictures of Markus, of us talking from last night, of him in his house, on the couch, in his bed. My face felt hot, I couldn't breathe. 

I shoved some photos into my bag, hurriedly put the rest back into the box, and placed it on the shelf. I turned and walked to the bedroom door and when I opened it, there stood Elijah reaching for the knob. I nearly screamed in fear. I stepped back and he looked back at me with a confused smile. 

“Why are you in my house?” He asked innocently

I opened my mouth to speak, but nothing came out. 

His face twisted into a deeper confusion. “Billie?” 

I looked at his face, taking in every detail, I knew this face, and I knew those eyes, I’d seen them for so long, and yet I ignored it. Elijah noticed my fear and his face dropped, his eyes slightly twitching.

“Were you going through my room?” 

I took a sharp breath in. I couldn’t let him know I saw those photos, but I just couldn’t get my body to work with me. I forced a smile to my face.

“No sorry I came to say goodbye…Your door was open so I was trying to find you.”

His face lit up a little and he regained his sincere grin. “Oh, I’m sorry I was out.” He said, nudging my shoulder.

I laughed forcibly. “No, it’s ok.”

“Do you want some coffee?” Elijah asked.

“Oh no I’m fine,” I said.

I tilted his head to the side. “I insist.” He smiled, squinting his eyes slightly taking in any detail of my face.

“Fine, but just one cup, I have to get home soon.”

He grinned widely and turned for the stairs. I followed close behind. When he made it to the kitchen, I sat myself on the couch nearby. I looked at my reflection in the TV and tried to calm myself down. He wouldn’t do something unless he knew I saw something I wasn’t supposed to. I just had to act a little. I looked back up at Elijah who was digging through his pantry…I shot him, I shot Elijah, and yet he’s here. What was this thing standing only 20 feet away from me? He sensed I was staring at him and looked over at me. He stood up straight. He asked me something, before looking back at the kitchen counter.

“Oh shoot, left  something upstairs, mind if I get it.” He asked blankly.

I nodded my head reassuringly. He smiled and rushed upstairs. I leaned back on the seat, should I run, where would I ever go, who knows what he would do to me, to my family? I looked back up at the stairs, did I put everything back the way it was, did I misplace the books in the drawer, leave a drawer open, or put the box in the wrong place? I put my hands over my face and listened. 

I heard him slowly walk to his room, moving stuff around. My heart started to pound louder and louder. I heard him leave the room slamming the door behind him. My eyes widened and I looked up at the stairs. I didn’t hear him moving, he must have been standing at the top of the stairs. I called him down softly and he resumed his walk. He looked at me with a warm smile. I could feel my shoulders relax. He placed the two mugs on the table and poured creamer into my cup.

He encouraged me to come sit with him at the table so I stood up, holding my hands together tightly, nails digging into my skin. He pulled the chair out for me and pushed my chair in lightly. He walked around dragging his hand on the rim of the table. He sat down and looked at me. He didn’t say anything, just sat there occasionally taking a sip of his drink. I could hear the clock’s ticking grow louder with every second I laughed nervously.

“Is something wrong?” I asked

He looked up at me, raising his eyebrows slightly. “Of course not.”

I nodded before wrapping my hands around my mug.

“You went hunting with your dad the other day, how was that, you never told me about it?”

“Good.”

“Catch anything?” He said almost tauntingly

I looked up at him.

He smiled widely.  “That seems like a yes.”

“No, I didn’t,” I said, stuttering.

He shook his head slightly, before straightening his posture with a grin. 

He took a sip of his drink.

“You go through my room Billie?” He said seriously, his smile dropping.

I felt my heart stop for a moment. I looked at him, his eyes stabbing right through to my soul. “No, no I didn’t!” I said rushingly. “I promise I didn’t take anything, I would never do that!” 

He stood up, walked around the table, stood next to me, and bent down. I felt my heart drop into my stomach. 

“Why’d you really come?” He asked, his voice almost sorry.

I opened my mouth but paused. I thought for a moment letting my heart rate settle before speaking up. “The police report, I saw when I was over last, and I wanted to know why you had it. I’m sorry I lied.”

He stayed silent before laughing nervously. “You find it?” 

“I did.”

He nodded slowly before putting his hand to his mouth and dragging it down in frustration. He stood up and turned away. “I can explain.” He said trailing off. 

I turned to him, he hung his head. I looked down at his hands and saw his fingers were twitching. I stood up and walked to him. I put on a warm smile and placed my hand on his shoulder. He looked at me. His dark hair drooping over his face.

“It’s ok, you don't need to explain, I understand, I do… I know I’ve got a weird past.” I tightened my grip on his shoulder. 

He looked at me blankly, his eyes looking through mine. I stood silently waiting for him to say something. He bit his lip thinking. He looked down and tapped his finger against his face. I felt as if my knees were about to fold. I needed to get out, but it seemed as if it was never going to happen. 

“It’s ok.” I said quietly.

He smiled and looked at me. “Thank you for understanding, you’ve just got a strange track record.” He laughed.

“Yeah, I guess I do.” 

He turned to me smiling, his white teeth showing. “I’m sorry this was our last conversation before you leave.” he laughed a little.

“It’s ok.” I shrugged.

“Yeah…Well, you should probably get going, you going over to Markus’s?”

“Yeah.”

“Ok.” He smiled.

“Goodbye, Elijah.” I frowned a little.

“Goodbye.” 

He pulled me into a hug, my knees nearly gave out. He wrapped his arms around me tightly, I did the same. Tears welled in my eyes, I shut them tightly holding in my urge to run. I laid my head against his chest… silence…I tightened my hug before pulling back. He looked down at me, noticing my tears. He wiped them away slowly.

“Tell your parents I say hi.” 

“I will.” I smiled                           

I walked to the couch standing by the door. Elijah didn’t move, he just stood there. I walked to the door. I twisted the knob slowly opening it. I looked back and waved, he returned it. I closed the door behind me and fell forward, grabbing the stair’s railing. I looked down the stairwell before standing straight up. I slowly pulled my phone out and pretended to use it for a while before walking down the stairs. My legs were shaking so violently that I felt as if I was going to collapse. I pushed through the door, the wind blowing my hair into my face. I walked mindlessly not even realizing I made it to my car until I was grabbing at the locked door. I took out my key, the charms chiming as my hands shook violently. When I climbed inside I closed my eyes before slamming my hands against the steering wheel, I screamed, tears welling in my eyes.

“No, no, why, no!” 

I slammed my hands against the wheel over and over and over, till my palms bled, Screaming till my voice went hoarse. I looked up at the parking lot around me before I silently turned the car in, preparing to drive home when I got a call from Markus, I rushed to the hospital.  I pulled up, almost forgetting to shut my car off. I ran through the rain and saw Markus waiting for me outside. His expression changed as soon as he saw me. He must have been standing out for a while, he was soaked in rain and held himself tight. I ran up to him. As I got closer I  could see his arm was wrapped up.

“What happened, did they take anything, are you ok?” 

He shook his head. “It didn’t hurt me, but…my mom.” Tears welled in his eyes. “That thing almost killed her. It was that thing, Billie, it knew we were talking, I don’t understand...” He grabbed me. “It could've killed us.” He said breaking down. 

We stood in the rain for a while, the wind getting harsher. He took me to her room. I was surprised she was even alive. Markus couldn’t even look at her. I sat in silence as he told me what happened. He wiped tears from his eyes. 

“Markus, I’m sorry.” 

I couldn’t think of anything else to say. He stayed silent for a few moments, just looking at his mom. His hands twitched until he curled them into a ball.

I looked up at him. “Markus.”

He turned to me his eyes filled with grief.

“It’s Elijah...”

His eyes squinted in confusion slightly before the realization set in. His eyes widened. “W…What?”

“I looked down not wanting to see that look on his face.

 He turned away burying his face into his hands. “We can’t let this happen again.” He whispered. 

“What, do you mean?” 

“He…He’s responsible for all this taunting and torture we’ve been through…We have to kill him.” 

Markus and I talked for a while before we left for my house. I unlocked the door slowly and walked in, the sound of our footsteps echoing through the house. We sat on the carpet in the hollow living room, wondering how on earth we kill something that bullets can’t harm, eventually, we relied on the fact that fire had to kill him. We figured we could trap him somewhere, and burn him to death. We thought we could try that old pink house, but we couldn't trap him in there with the hole in the basement door and the shattered basement window. I looked up at the rooms around me, and the house was completely empty. My eyes widened and I turned to Markus before standing up. 

He looked up at me with curiosity. “What?”

“You still got that gun my dad gave you?”

“Yeah, why?”

“Just come on.”

I jumped up and we left for his place. I grabbed the gun my dad gave Markus, its silencer, and its bullets, as well as some matches and lots of gasoline. I drove back home and set everything on the counter. I dumped gasoline in the attic, and all rooms upstairs, before grabbing the alcohol my parents left out for the next owners. I pulled out my phone and looked over at Markus.

“Do you trust me?” I asked.

He looked into my eyes, his face filled with worry. “I do.”

I smiled before calling Elijah. It rang for a few seconds before he picked up.

“Billie?”

“Hey, Elijah my parents are out and Markus and I pulled out some alcohol they left behind…If you want to come over one last time before I leave.”

I waited.

“Sure, I'll be over.”

“‘Ok, see ya soon.”

He hung up, and I looked up to see Markus’s horrified look. I reassured him this was the only way, and let him in on my plan. Half an hour went by and Elijah knocked on the door. He walked in, the smell of his cologne washing over me as he leaned into a hug. Markus and I welcomed him inside, before popping open the drinks. A few hours went by and Elijah excused himself to the bathroom. Markus and I looked at each other, now or never. I yelled up to Elijah that I was leaving, and walked into the dining room, and stood on the other side of the wall. A few minutes later Elijah walked back to the living room.

Markus and him made small talk for a while before Markus spoke up.

“I know it’s you.” He said bluntly.

A few moments went by.

“What?” Elijah said confused.

“I know you’re that thing.” Markus grew a little louder. “I know it’s you, and I’m going to tell Billie.”

“Markus, what are you talking about, are you ok?”

“You’re handwriting it’s the same, you’ve been stalking her for years, and she's almost on to you, you’re a fucking monster.”

Elijah stayed silent.

“And…I know about-”

I heard Elijah grab Markus shoving him to the ground.

“Shut up, you don’t know what you’re talking about!” Elijah yelled.

I turned the corner and promptly aimed my gun at Elijah,  I yelled and Elijah quickly stood up, taking his hands away from Markus’s neck, Markus pulled back and stood up. I walked up to Elijah. I looked down at him. I raised my gun. I didn’t even know what to say if I even should say anything. Eventually, I opened my mouth but could only manage one word.

“Why?” I asked, teary-eyed.

He looked up at me,  I could see his hands shaking. “I…I”

 Markus walked up behind me.

“What are you doing? Just shoot him.”

I looked down at him, he looked terrified. He knew he was going to die.

I put my finger over the trigger. “I…I can’t.” I said, stepping back. 

As I did Elijah pulled the gun violently from me. He pushed me aside and I fell to the ground. Elijah pointed the gun at Markus and shot, he yelled in pain as he hit the floor. I looked back at Elijah and put my hands up. He pointed it at me.

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” He asked terrified.

“Elijah I know, I saw your photos.”

His face went blank and he lowered the gun, his cheeks still flushed from all the alcohol. He didn’t know what to do, but he knew he couldn’t get out of this. He stood up and looked at me. I couldn’t see a hint of any emotion in his eyes, but I could see his hands still shaking. He dropped the gun and walked up and sat down next to me, putting his face in his hands. Seconds later I could hear him crying, begging for me to forgive him. I turned my head slightly, Markus was holding his shoulder he looked up at me, before referring me to the basement. I stood up slowly and walked to the basement door and looked down the stairs. My movement caught Elijah’s attention and He walked up to me. I turned to him, I shakily took his arm, before smiling.

“I forgive you, I’m sorry.” I said gently

I put a hand on his cheek and pulled him into a kiss. I shut my eyes as hard as I could. I heard Markus’s shot, then another, and another. I felt Elijah pull away from me. I opened my eyes and Markus pulled me back before quickly tossing a lit match down the stairs, immediately engulfing everything inside the basement in flames. I could hear Elijah yell before Markus slammed the door shut and locked it.

As we heard him bang against the door, He begged to be let out,  I couldn’t listen, I wanted to open that door, to believe that I was just crazy and that Elijah was the friend I thought he was, but looking at Markus’s cold stare at the door eyes filled with emptiness, I remained still. His voice grew into horror, it stopped, and then we heard a whisper Markus and I looked at each other. We waited, his whispers grew to a yell, and that yell to a scream, it was my mother. She yelled she loved me and that she was in pain. Tears welled in my eyes, even though I knew it wasn't her. With every voice we heard he no, it got more desperate, and eventually, it growled its voice getting deeper, with every word it yelled its voice changed until it landed on a man's voice, I knew that voice. Markus’s dad. He looked at the door and rage-fuelled his eyes.

“Please Mark, don't do this to me, I love you, Markus Please, It’s your dad, Help me it hurts, it hurts, Mar-”

“SHUT UP, SHUT UP, STOP!” He screamed. Covering his ears.

Markus’s screams were so loud I could barely hear that creature's voice anymore, I could see Smoke rising through the door, and The creature's call became weaker. Markus began crying, shouting aimlessly at the door. I yelled for him to get out of the house, before grabbing the rest of the gasoline and spreading it across the living room carpet. More and more smoke seeped into the living room. I took my box of matches from my pocket and lit it, fire never seemed so lovely. I tossed it into the house before running through the door and jumping to the sidewalk. I watched the house light up in flames.

 I could smell burned wood but it was as if it smelled like the sweetest treat on earth my heart was lifted with the sights of flames, all this torture was finally over. I watched as the roof sunk in and the wood fell to the ground.  I couldn’t help but smile. I could hear Markus walk up to me. He took my hand, and I tightened my grip. By the time firefighters were able to get to the house, it was too late. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, I was free. My worries, my fear, my hate, it was gone. Every chip on my shoulder, every hole in my heart had been filled. 

I turned to Markus who looked into the fire, he turned to me. “I told you so.” he nudged me.

I looked at him confused until I remembered his words from so long ago, I smiled and couldn’t hold in my laugh. Tears started to fall from my face. I couldn't believe it was actually over, but it was.
