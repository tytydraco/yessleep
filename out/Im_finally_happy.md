"Your mom got in a car crash",  those were the words I heard coming from my phone, in the empty school hallway. A cold wave traveled through my body rapidly fast, my vision was starting to get blurry, my hearing got messed up, until I heard the words "Hey what're you doing, get back in my class!". Everything suddenly became normal. I heard the words "Sorry, Ms Smith" come out of my mouth forcefully, my legs started to forcefully walk into the classroom and sit down. 

After class, as I was walking out of the classroom and finally into freedom, Ms Smith stopped me and said: "Young man, remember you have detention today!'. "B-but Ms smith", the words
 stopped coming out and I finally said "Fine".

 At 3:15 I was already in detention, being tortured by boredom. After waiting for 2 hours, I finally was released. 

It was dark outside, since it was winter. No one was on the streets, I was alone... I wanted to get this over with fast, I took a step, then another and proceeded to walk faster.  As I was walking past the old abandoned house, which kids were scared of, a hand grabbed my arm from behind, and Screamed "Do you want to be happy?". I started to run in fear, and when looking back I saw a humanoid being, that was way too large to be human, with arms longer then me myself. It started to run towards me, I also ran, but no matter how fast I was running, IT was running faster. 

In the distance, I could see a car, I didn't care, I ripped the door open, sat inside, and Screamed "Drive!" The car drove and led me back to my house, even though I never told the driver where I lived.
 

As I entered the house I saw a depressed human like creature, that I could identify as my dad, sitting on a chair, that I hadn't seen before. I could see the last humanity my dad had left, slowly started to fade. I asked him "Is mom okay?". He didn't reply, he looked at me and then at his hands. At this state, I didn't dare to tell my dad what happened outside.  I went to bed early, and wished I wouldn't wake up the next day. 

As I entered the kitchen in the morning, I saw ny my dad going up white stairs, that lead to the ceiling and beyond. At the top of the stairs, I could see a little platform, and a rope on it, that was shaped in an oval form. I knew what would happen, I tried to run up the stairs to save dad, but I suddenly started to fall into emptiness. "Was this a dream or whas this a reality?", I had asked myself. 

I landed on a sideway beside my house, fully dressed and ready for the day. I saw a person walking towards me, with a big inhumane smile, his eyes were watery and he was tall like the humanoid creature.  I started to walk towards him, it didn't stop walking either. And then... It..... walked past me. I definetly didn't expect that.


I didn't feel like going to school today, hence I sat down on a bench near the abandoned house and waited. Days were passing rapidly, I think I was starting to get crazy. At this point I was as depressed as a human being can be. I begged for the creature to appear, it was my last hope. A psychiatrist wouldn't help, no one would, I NEEDED THE CREATURE. 


At this point, I've been sitting on the Bench for months now, nobody came looking for me. My legs started to grow rapidly, as did my arms. I started to become more like the creature. 

On day 345. I just had a enough, I took a knife that had magically appeared in my pocket and started to carve a smile in my face...

The knive made a move, it hurt, then again it made a move, Air started coming through the cut hole, then again, then again. At some point it started to hurt, and gave me a dopamine rush, each time the knife moved.  I started to feel happy, but it all faded when I was done. I felt the same depression again. From this point on, I started to cut myself in different areas of my body. Each time I stopped I felt that same depression again. 

On day 671, while I was cutting myself, I saw a little kid wakk past the abandoned house, it was the first time, since I saw a human life, while sitting here. I walked up to the kid, and asked the same question, the creature asked me 2 years ago. "Do you want to be happy?". My life was surprisingly loud, and the kid started to run. Was I really that ugly and terrible? I became angry and started to Chase the kid, the kid screamed. This time there was no car to help the kid, I grabbed the kid and ripped of his little arms, I suddenly had the strong desire to taste the arms. Hmm,DELICIOUS! I saw the little pathetic kid trying to crawl away with just his legs. That little creature was so cute. I grabbed it and threw it into my very large mouth.

On Day 1961, I had run out of places to cut my body, from now I had to switch to just eating, everyday, suddenly at exactly 16:34, A kid walked past the house. Each one of them shared the same faith.

Look at me, I started to realize that I had become the large humanoid creature,  what would've happened if that car never saved me, what if.. I am a monster now...
