*This is a real story, and one that I do not recall fondly. But as I stumbled upon this sub, I figured I might as well take the time to retell it. Thanks for reading!*

To preface this story there are a couple key points I must make that provide some much needed context:

1. For many years (ages 10-14 ish) my entire family (my family, my cousins, grandparents) went on a family vacation to Colorado for 2 weeks every summer.
2. During these trips we always stayed at the same "villa," they were like Airbnb's but big enough for all three families to stay together. Except for one summer, (the summer in which this story takes place) we stayed at a similar house not far from our usual rental home.
3. Much of this story takes place in a basement. I am from Texas, where nobody has basements. So forgive me for describing basements, and this basement in particular, as inherently creepy.

I'll begin,

At the time of this particular summer trip, I was 11-12 years old. My cousin (who for now is the only other relevant character) was one year younger than me -- so 10-11. When we arrived, we all set out to pick our rooms; long story short, my cousin and I got the worst of them all -- we were to stay in what was essentially a shoebox\* in the basement of this large house\*.

-***The House***: For more context, the layout of this house is important (this will make sense later). It had 3 floors, an upstairs with 1 or two bedrooms, a central "ground" floor which had the living room, kitchen, master bedroom, etc., and the basement which had a small living area, a bedroom, and on the other end of a long narrow hallway, the shoebox my cousin and I would be sleeping in that hardly fit two twin size beds.

-***The Shoebox***: I've attached to the best of my ability a general layout/description of the room (this is very important for later): [https://imgur.com/a/shoebox-HwbKGvV](https://imgur.com/a/shoebox-HwbKGvV)

**Night 1:** The first night of the trip, my cousins and I stayed up talking and playing games, then all went to sleep in our respective rooms. My cousin asked that we leave the door cracked so the night light in the hall would come into the room, just a little bit. I obliged as we were in a creepy basement in an unfamiliar place, and went to sleep unbothered.

I woke up in the middle of the night to see my cousins bed empty, which upset and scared me (I then had the realization that I was alone in an eerie basement (save for the other cousins on the other side in their bedroom). I struggled to get back to sleep, but managed, and woke up feeling more on edge. I went up for breakfast to find my cousin had gone up to the top floor to sleep in his parents room. During breakfast, he claimed to have gotten scared in the night -- which I forgave.

**Night 2:** The second night went similarly. I cracked the door by my bed to let some light in, and went to sleep. This time, I woke up in the morning to find his bed empty, and was now a little angry that he would leave me again--I did NOT like the idea of being alone in a creepy room (a basement room no less).

We spoke at breakfast, where he gave me the same reasoning as the night before, and he had slept upstairs with his parents. Except this time he mentioned that there was something about the basement he didn't like (safe to say that stuck with me). This conversation led to me forcing him to swear he wouldn't leave our room the next night, as I was now scared as well. He agreed.

**Night 3 (THE BIG ONE):** The third, and most important night of this story began with me reminding my cousin that we had an agreement, and if, under any circumstances he was too scared and needed to leave, he was to wake me up and tell me so (I would have gone as well). The evening closed with him assuring me and we set off for bed. I once again cracked the door so a sliver of light entered the room. I went to sleep praying my cousin would stay, as his fear of the basement had now taken hold of me as well.

\* \* \*

I woke up in the night to see that it was **3:06 a.m.** on the digital clock across the room. I was comforted to hear my cousin rustling in his bed and rolled over to go back to sleep. As I closed my eyes, I heard my cousin continue to shift in his bed. Louder, this time. And again. Planning to tell him to be quiet, I rolled back over. But what I saw instead terrified me.

Upon my cousin's bed, a figure sat -- more perched if you can imagine -- squatting on its toes; and completely still, staring at me. I could only see a silhouette (as the room was dark) except for two glowing eyes, magnified by the sliver of light coming from the cracked door.

I stared, frozen in fear. Until, the figure moved, slowly at first, then quickly it began to thrash the covers of the bed upon which it sat. It shook and waved the sheets until finally, (praying to God this was in fact my younger cousin who was either "sleep thrashing" or playing a sick joke) using every ounce of courage I had, I told it to stop.

And stop it did. *Immediately* -- almost unnaturally. I regretted speaking up instantly, as once the covers fell it returned to its perched position and began again, to stare at me. At this moment I wanted nothing more than to scream and run, but I could not. I couldn't breathe, much less move. Frightened beyond anything, I slowly pulled the covers over my head, and begged for morning to come.

\* \* \*

When I awoke the following morning, recalling the events of my restless night, I gave a quick glance to my cousin's bed. And, to my utter shock, the bed was empty. And had been made--perfectly.

I ran upstairs to find my uncle making breakfast and immediately asked for my cousin (wanting to scold him for the terrifying prank he decided to pull on me, and also hoping that it was indeed him and not something else in the room with me). My uncle casually told me he was asleep upstairs and that he had once again gotten scared and came into their room last night.

Panicked and horrified by this news, I asked him what time he came into their room. He briefly thought about it, and answered -- **11:30**.

Shaking, I sat down at the kitchen table.

\* \* \*

When I told my family over breakfast the tale of my terrifying experience the night before, no one believed me. It was my imagination, or a really bad dream. I was old enough to know the difference between dream and reality, but adults rarely believe children's stories, and I was chastised for now scaring the other kids.

It wasn't until days later that I had confirmation (needless to say I had moved out of the basement and upstairs to a less comfortable, but safer, floor pallet).

Near the end of our trip, my grandmother told us she had been up into the night reading a book in the living room, as she was finding it impossible to sleep, when she heard a sharp knock on the front door. She went to answer, and found no one there. When she returned to her book, the knock came again. This time on the windows. Believing some troublemaking neighbors were playing a trick, she brushed it off and started to go back to her room. But the knocks came again--now from everywhere. The walls, windows, and doors began to shake as they grew louder, and harder. She claimed the whole house shook.

When everyone said they heard nothing of the sort that night, my story became more believable.

That was the last time we took a family trip to Colorado.

***THE END***

If you did in fact take the time to read this, thank you -- my sincerest apologies for making it so long, but I wanted to do the story justice. Cheers, everyone!
