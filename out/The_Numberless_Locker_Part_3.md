Summer was over and me and Jason were soon gonna start school again. Our evening gaming sessions had also turned into what we called “masters in the making of plans”, which sounded stupid enough but to both our parents passed as one of our games. We knew it was a serious matter and we were determined to expose the janitor and undo the rumors against Jason, but we couldn’t help but to draw maps, gather “survival gear”, act out certain tactics and such. I guess it helped us ease our minds towards doing something possibly very illegal. But all in all, this was to uncover the truth about Jason's sister. Whether we believed we would get caught, find anything at all, or had a good plan, it was worth a try. 

We both knew we probably wouldn’t be able to sneak into the gym during the night. The office would most likely be locked and none of us were rather skilled at lockpicking. Stealing the keys from either Louis or the janitor would be difficult too. And even if we did manage to do so, entering the office during daytime basically meant we were asking people to notice us. Keeping the keys until night time was a stupid idea as well. We needed to get into the office, unnoticed, for a long time, and search for something of which we didn’t know what to look for. It was incredibly stupid and risky, but to our credit, we actually had a good plan. 

It was mostly Jason's idea. Every year, after summer, our school had a PE program hosted at the gym. It was meant to educate the kids about the importance of exercising or something, and meant the gym was gonna be packed with kids. Our plan was to cause a small fire, enough to scare kids out of their mind. Which would get everyone out of the gym and in the confusion of a lot of screaming kids and stressed adults, get us into the office. Neither Louis nor the janitor would have enough time to lock the office among the chaos we planned to ensue and the whole ordeal would give us enough time to search through it. That was the plan, atleast. And maybe it would have worked, if Jason had showed up.

The day of the plan, we didn’t bike to school together. When I knocked on his family’s door, his mom answered and told me Jason had already left. He wasn’t at school either, at first. During one random pee break in the middle of class, I met Jason in the hallway, waiting outside our classroom.

“What the hell man, where have you been?”

“I’m sorry. It’s just, I dunno. Can we really go through with this?” 

“What do you mean? We’re doing this for you, for your sister!”

“I know, I know. I just can’t be in class right now, it’s too much. I’ll meet you at the gym later”, he said, before turning his back to me and walking away.

I could already tell our plan was failing. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong with Jason, which was greatly reciprocated when he didn’t show up at the gym. I sat in the locker room for way too long, staring at the door leading out to the gym. Most of the other kids had already left, but some boys were still inside of the locker room and were now eyeing me and whispering among each other. I tried my best to ignore them, which became impossible when they came up to me. I was expecting them to beat me up or something similar, instead they almost treated me as some kind of celebrity. The reason for, was Jason.

“You’re friends with Jason, right?”, one of them asked.

“Yeah”

“What’s it like?”, another one said.

“What do you mean?”

“Did he, you know, do it? Did he put his sister in the locker?”, a third one said.

“The locker? What are you…”. I had forgotten about it again. The numberless locker. No matter how hard you tried to take your mind away from it, it always made its way back to you. The people of this town were a constant reminder of it, they were a testament to its survival. I didn’t believe the stories nor think they were interesting enough to be given a second thought. Even less, I didn’t believe the rumors about Jason. But here I was, alone in the locker room, ready to burn down the gym for him, and he was nowhere to be found. The whole plan was to undo the rumors about him and his sister, and he wasn’t here? 

“No, no he didn't…he wouldn’t…”, I fumbled with the words, I didn’t know what to say. Why wasn’t he here? Immense anger was bubbling up from my stomach and the anxiety made my head feel like it was going to explode.

“He’s crazy, everyone knows he did it. I wouldn’t dare go near him if I was you. You have a sister, right? I wouldn’t keep her near him, who knows what he..”

I’m not proud of what happened next, but I honestly don’t regret it. Before he could finish, I was on top of him. I had never gotten into a fight before and I’m pretty sure it looked like a wrestling match. But, when the other two boys pulled me off of him, someone had gotten a punch in. Not me, nor the boy I had launched myself at or any of the others, but the floor. Blood was slowly oozing out on the stained tiles from the back of the boy's head. 

Before I realized what happened, the other two boys were frantically trying to wake him up. My anxiety was literally pounding on the inside of my head. I just stared at him, slowly backing up, until I was stopped by a locker behind me. I could feel it, the cold touch it gave, the fear striking every part of my body. Despite every single neuron in my brain telling me not to, I slowly looked up. The numberless locker. It was wide open. All I could see was black, vile darkness, stretching down like an empty hallway. I swear I could hear it tell me it was all my fault. I was mocking me. Taunting me. But it was wrong. Everything that just happened was because of the rumors. All because I waited for Jason, all because of our plan, all because of the pain this town had cursed upon us. All, because of the numberless locker. I wasn’t going to let it have power over me. I wasn’t going to let the stories remain true. 

Everything around me went silent for a second and the only thing I could hear was my own breathing. I didn’t know what to believe at this point. I wanted to believe Jason, I wanted the janitor to be the monster I imagined him to be, and to my own disbelief, I wanted the stories about the locker to be true. Then, everything would make sense somehow. The rumors wouldn’t be just rumors, the truth wouldn’t be masked with lies. I guess I didn’t want things to make sense, I didn’t want the reality of a gruesome murder to be true. I wanted the numberless locker to be something else than just a fake story made to satiate people's ignorance. In a stroke of either pure stupidity or wreckless rebellion, I grabbed my bag, opened the locker and shoved it in before closing and locking it. 

The next thing I knew, people were flooding the locker room. A hand grabbed my shoulder and led me out of the room, to the outside of the gym where I was sat down. It was Louis. 

“You alright kid?”

I didn’t respond. A single ambulance siren wailed in the distance but didn’t take long to reach the gym. The perks of being a small town is quick response time I guess. I felt completely apathetic, unable to comprehend what was happening. After some time, I eventually looked up to see my dads car among other parents pull into the parking lot. My dad tried talking to me before eventually grabbing my arm and leading me to the car. I looked back for just a moment, people were vomiting out of the gym. But, between the masses, I swear I could see the janitor standing near the entrance, staring at me. His eyes were pale with the smallest, blackest pupils I’ve ever seen. No color, no shine nor any amount of life seemed to accommodate the black and white in his eye sockets. Those eyes, they’re burned into my mind.

A few days passed after the incident. The day after, my dad told me the boy was fine. He had cut the back of his head badly, receiving twelve stitches in total, and gotten a bad concussion. Though he certainly had a rough time at first, apparently he got loads of attention at school and a cool scar, so nothing was really lost except for my already substantially low reputation. Between being forced to help with every possible chore you could think of around the house, I mostly spent time in my room, laying in bed, doing nothing. Both my parents urged me to talk with Jason, but I refused. Everything was ruined. And I was beginning to believe my friendship with Jason was ruined too. Which is why angriness quickly followed the surprise when he was suddenly knocking on my window. 

“Alex? You in there?”

“Yes, you can literally see me.”

“Well, can you let me in?”

“Are you serious? No.”

“Look man, I’m sorry. I heard what happened. I’m sorry I didn’t show up in time, my bike’s chain broke.”

“You mean my bike.”

“Yes, your bike. Look, we need to talk, I’ve-”

“We don’t have to talk about anything”, I said, as I went up to my window and opened it. “I stood up for you. I defended you. And what did it get me? Everybody at school hates me now. They think you made me crazy. They think I tried to kill that guy.”

“Alex, I know how you feel.”

“You don’t know shit Jason! If you did, you would have shown up. You would have cared about going through with our plan!”

“I know I know, please just let me-”

“You don’t even care about your sister, do you? Maybe the rumors are true? Maybe you did kill her!”

I was angry. I was depressed. Jason, I am so sorry. He didn’t say anything. He just stared at me for a moment, trying to grasp what I had said. The silence made me realize how hurtful words can be. I wasn’t proud of myself, not one bit, but I still felt like my anger was justified somehow. I didn’t care how unreasonable and selfish I was. I just wanted Jason to be as hurt as me. Eventually, he spoke.

“I just wanted to let you know, I got into the office.”

I was taken by surprise so quickly, all my anger left my body. 

“What? What are you… how?”

“I did show up at the gym. I didn’t know what happened yet, everyone was outside but I didn’t see you. So I just assumed you went along with the plan. I went inside, into the office and I started searching around. I found nothing, except for a key. I thought I heard someone outside in the hallway so I shoved the key down my pocket and ran out.”

“Jason, I-”, before I could finish he cut me off.

“I escaped through the shower windows in the boys locker room and went home. I could see the pool of blood on the floor. Then I heard about what happened. I wasn’t sure you wanted to see me, but I guess I know now.”

He didn’t even look sad, just tired. Like he was used to feeling so small for so long, nothing could push him further down.

“I was going to ask you if you wanted to find out where this key leads to. Maybe to a safe? Maybe it’s a spare to the office? But, I don’t know if we should even try anymore…I don’t know if it’s worth it anymore.”

Silence had never been so loud. After a moment, all Jason said, was bye. My eyes followed him all the way back to his house before I pulled the curtains, went to bed and cried. The next morning, I was supposed to return back to school. I had never been up so early and ready to leave for school as I was that morning, and I had my inability to sleep that night to thank. 

But as I was ready to leave, I couldn’t find my backpack. The realization hit me so suddenly I felt lightheaded. My backpack was in the numberless locker. I completely forgot about it. I rushed to tell my dad, I think he was more surprised that I seemed so distressed about my backpack rather than being angry at me for forgetting it there. My dad managed to call Louis and we were let inside the gym before it opened. He told me to go get my bag while he talked to Louis. 

I went inside the locker room. Even though I tried to avoid it, my eyes darted straight towards where the boy had been bleeding on the floor. Then to the numberless locker. It was still secured with my lock. There was nothing left to prove now, I could punish myself with the fact that the numberless locker was nothing but a ghost story,  But once I opened the locker, and my backpack was gone, I knew I was never gonna be the same again.
