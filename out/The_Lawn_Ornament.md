 I never cared much about Halloween.  Growing up, I didn’t like scary movies or dressing up, and it seemed a weird way to get candy.  Now that I’m in college, my opinion hasn’t really changed, though the peer pressure to go out and do something is even worse than when I was a kid. 

 

Maybe that’s why I picked this week to go home for a few days.  My parents were happy to have me visit, and I was glad to see them too, though it got a bit boring after the first weekend.  That’s what led me to browsing my dad’s recent pile of newspapers, and that’s how I found the ad from last Friday’s edition.

 

***Need adult actor to play a role in my yard’s Halloween decorations.  Only Monday night, as that’s when the trick-or-treaters are coming out!  Will pay very well to the lucky employee.***

 

There was a local number below, and I hesitated to even call.  I was just trading one Halloween for another, but technically it wasn’t even Halloween yet, and if he really was paying a lot…

 

“Hello?”

 

“Hello.  My name is Becky Chatsworth.  I’m calling about the ad.  Do you still need someone for your lawn decorations or whatever?”

 

A quiet laugh, and then, “I do, yes.  I’ve had a few calls, but no one that stood out as worthwhile.  So you’re interested in it?”

 

“Maybe, yeah.  If I could find out more about what you’d need me to do and how much it pays.”

 

“Sure, of course.  You would be part of one of my lawn exhibits, playing someone partially buried.  Your face would be in the free air, of course, and I don’t think you’d find it uncomfortable.  Basically you’d just moan and scream and beg to be freed when people come up for candy.  I’d plan for it to go from 6pm until 10pm, though we might knock off early if there are no more trick-or-treaters.  And I would pay you $400 for your time.”

 

I tried to keep my voice even.  “Um, well yeah.  That doesn’t sound too bad.  I’d be interested in doing the job if you’d like to use me.” 

 

“I do think you stand out.  Hmm.  Yes, I don’t see why not.  I’ll text you my address and if you don’t mind arriving at 5:30,  I’ll put some make-up on your face so you look appropriately ghoulish.  Sound good?”

 

“Um, yes…yes sir.  It does.  See you then.”  Hanging up the call, I grinned to myself.  “A hundred bucks an hour?  Don’t mind if I do.”

 

\*\*\*\*

 

When I got to the address I met Langford Lumley, a man in his early sixties that lived alone in a large house tucked away at the end of an otherwise empty cul-de-sac in a large neighborhood that was nice, if a bit run down with age.  He invited me into a home that was cluttered but clean, though you could still see the remnants of where he had been working on Halloween decorations scattered across the living room and kitchen.  Apologizing for the mess, he sat me in a kitchen chair and quickly put some make-up and fake skin on my face to make me look like the corpse I was meant to be.  Looking into the mirror ten minutes later, I was kind of amazed.

 

“Do you do this professionally?”

 

He gave a deep belly laugh as he blushed a little.  “No, nothing like that.  I learned it from my wife before she passed.  She was a real talent.  This stuff I do now…well, we always loved decorating, and I guess this is my way of honoring her.”  Sniffing sharply, he shook his head as he dug into the overalls pocket of his zombie farmer costume.  When he pulled his hand back out, there was a roll of twenties that he pressed into my palm.  “Here’s your pay in advance.  I went ahead and made it $500 since you came early and are such a nice young lady.”

 

I frowned.  “Are you sure?  That’s a lot.”

 

He waved away my concern.  “Not at all.  You’re going to be the centerpiece of the whole evening.  The kids’ll love it.”  Smiling widely, he gestured to the way we’d come in.  “Speaking of which, we better get you settled in before they start coming.”

 

\*\*\*\*

 

The “grave” was a large metal box about seven-feet long and over three feet wide.  The top was a hinged lid covered with realistic-looking grass that, when closed, blended in almost perfectly with the grass of the lawn.  It was so good that when Langford first went over and reached into the ground to pull it open, it felt like I was watching him magically flip open a real piece of the yard.  He’d grinned at my surprise.

 

“Yeah, the keys are to fit it perfectly to the hole and match the grass.  Not just color, but length and type too.  It’s taken me a few years to get it just right.”

 

Nodding in wonderment, I looked down into the open container I was going to be living in for the next few hours.  Honestly, it didn’t look that bad.  It was lined inside with memory foam, with extra padding towards the top where my shoulders, arms and head would be.  I gave him a questioning look and he smiled wider, reaching into the lid to pop out cut-outs for my head and arms. 

 

“Yeah, I keep them plugged until someone is in there for appearance and safety.  But it should be plenty of room for you to stick your hands and forearms through, and your face too, of course.”  He pointed to two holes in the side of the container.  “I even have air being piped through so your body won’t get too sweaty in there.  I know it’s cool out here, but with all that foam, it can get warm if you don’t have ventilation.”  Glancing around, his eyes finally came back to me.  “So does it look okay to you?”

 

Returning his smile, I nodded.  “A grave fit for a queen.”

 

\*\*\*\*

 

It really was pretty comfortable in there.  The lid holes also had some foam around the edges, and while my arms would get tired occasionally, I could always pull them in.  My face was more tightly surrounded by its cushioned halo, and with the lid down all the way, It would be hard to get it out without pushing against the padding beneath me and twisting hard, but I doubted it would be an issue.  I was in more danger of falling asleep than anything else.  The interior space where most of my body was had plenty of room, and I could definitely feel a small stirring of cool air against my side and legs.  It was such a strange and neat thing to make, and it made me both like and pity lonely Mr. Lumley with his empty house and his full yard.

 

Because I was far from the only decoration outside.  There were skeletons and ghosts and pumpkins, and even a large grim reaper presiding over everything from an oak tree on the opposite side from where I was buried.  At first I wondered if I was even in the best spot for kids coming up—I was on the far end of the yard from the driveway most people would walk up trick-or-treating, and my head, while angled a bit above the surface of the ground so that I could look down and see across the yard, wasn’t the most obvious thing in the world.  I could be seen and heard, sure, but I definitely wouldn’t stand out if I didn’t move around and make noise.  But then again, maybe having me go unnoticed until I started to scream was part of the plan.

 

I’d been in the grave for awhile before the first victims came.  I had started to worry—what if no one came and he’d put all this work in for nothing?  And if that happened, I knew he wouldn’t ask for the money back, but should I keep it?  I guess I still did the job either way, but I’d feel bad.

 

So when the first group of kids came up, I felt more than a little relief.  I almost said hey or “Happy Halloween” or something, but I caught myself in time.  Instead, I waited until they were almost to the door and then I let out a wail.

 

“Help meeee..!  I’m not dead yet!”

 

All three of them jumped and screamed, and one of them started to bolt before the biggest, probably his older brother, grabbed him with a laugh.  “It’s a decoration, doofus.”  He pointed me out in the far part of the yard.  “It *is* badass t…”

 

“Happy Halloween, kids!”  Langford had opened the door now, and his warm and friendly zombie seemed to set them immediately at ease.  “We’re a bit early, but that just means you can bug your parents for more candy in three days!”

 

I let out a laugh then, and when they headed back down the driveway, still eyeing me nervously, I did call after them, wishing them a good night of trick-or-treating.  After that, we had a few more kids and their parents, with the pace picking up more and more as night came on.  I was getting into it too—screaming at some, laughing manically at others, and I was so into looking for the next group that I didn’t notice when the air circulating through the grave box stopped.  It wasn’t until I felt myself slowly being pushed up tighter against the head opening that I realized something was going on.

 

“You’re going to want to take a deep breath now.  As big of a breath as you can.  Hold it and keep it, okay?”

 

Langford had somehow come up behind me, was over me staring down, and it was as I went to ask him if this was some kind of prank that I felt cold liquid spraying against my body in a torrent.  I tried to pull free, but my head was too tightly in place, and when I pushed against the lid of the box, it didn’t budge.

 

“You’re wasting time, Becky.  This is a quick-dry resin filling up that box.  It’s flexible, but not enough that you’ll be able to breathe well if you don’t make room now.  So puff out your chest, fill your lungs, and keep them full until I say.”

 

I wanted to argue or threaten or scream for him to let me go, but he was right.  It was already halfway up my body and I could feel it thickening as it went.  I could barely move my legs now, and it took effort to pull my arms back up as high as I could get them.  Talking to him or calling for help could wait until after I knew I could still breathe.  Staring at him, I sucked in the biggest breath I could manage.

 

The moments crawled by as the box filled almost all the way and then stopped.  My chest was burning, and I was starting to let out a slow leak of air.  I had to stop.  If I didn’t, I wouldn’t be able to take another breath again.  My vision began to turn red and I felt tears running down the sides of my face as he casually checked his watch. 

 

“That should be good enough.”

 

Gasping, I let out all the air and immediately started sucking more in.  “Just remember to keep taking big breaths so it doesn’t creep in on you.”

 

“Why?”  I squeaked out the question as I exhaled before breathing in a new, deep breath.  There was a generator going somewhere nearby—another thing I hadn’t paid attention to until it was too late—and I was worried he wouldn’t be able to hear me at all.

 

But he did.  Smiling, he just shook his head.  “It’s funny.  You’re scared.  Terrified you’re going to die.  And you still ask why before you ask me to let you go.”  Langford tapped the side of his nose.  “That’s not uncommon, either.  I used to think it was because people are naturally curious and want the truth.  But more and more I think it’s just because people are so entitled, so conditioned to having life work out like they want, that the idea of someone doing something like this…well, it offends them more than it scares them.”  He snickered nastily as he walked along the side of my grave.  “But no, I won’t tell you why.  My reasons are my own.  And if you want to have any chance at all, you better save your cries for help for the next batch of trick-or-treaters.”  His face brightened.  “Here they come now!”

 

As he ambled off to get his basket of candy, I started screaming to the couple bringing their little girls up the driveway. 

 

“Please!  Please help me!  This isn’t a joke!  I…I’m not a decoration.  He’s crazy and he’s trapped me in here!”

 

The man in the couple glanced over at me nervously, but the woman just laughed as she pulled the kids up to the door.  For his part, Langford just guffawed and waved to me as he filled their bags with candy. 

 

“Please!  Call the police!  He’s going to kill me!”

 

They were walking away now, and the man did pause for a moment, glancing over at me and back at Langford, but Langford just laughed again and wished them a Happy Halloween.  And when the woman pulled on his arm, the man started moving again with a nervous laugh.

 

That’s the way it went for the next two hours.  I would scream and beg and threaten and none of it mattered.  Most people thought it was part of the show, and whenever anyone started to look worried or concerned, Langford was just make a joke about how he needed to bury his victims deeper next year or offer them a caramel apple.  They wanted to believe it was fake, so it didn’t take much for him to convince them to take their candy and go.

 

I tried everything I could think of, but there wasn’t much I could do.  The resin or whatever that he’d filled the grave with was too strong to move through.  I couldn’t reach my phone or move my body at all except for my head and hands, and even that was only a little.  I could almost get my hands under the lip of their cutouts in the lid, but my head didn’t want to move at

 

“I think it’s slowing down.  Time to do a big finale for the next group.”

 

I rolled my eyes up to where Langford stood on his porch.  “Please!  Please let me go.  I won’t tell anyone.  It was all just an extreme decoration prank or something, right?”

 

He didn’t laugh this time, but just stared at me somberly.  “I think you know better than that, don’t you, Becky?”

 

Silence stretched between us for a few moments as I tried to think of something else to say or do.  It was then that I heard a group of kids coming up the driveway, talking excitedly.

 

“Happy Halloween, kids!  Got lots of candy left, but even better, I have a special surprise if you’ll wait there just a minute!”  The five kids slowed to a stop, and Langford took that as all the agreement he needed to head around the other side of the house.  “Be right back!”

 

As soon as he was out of sight, one of the kids, a thin blond girl in a devil costume, headed across the yard in my direction.  I immediately tried to catch her eye as I spoke in a lower tone of voice.

 

“Little girl, hey!  I need you to help me.  This man is crazy.  He…He has me trapped in here.  I need you to call the police.  Or go home and tell your parents, okay?  Please, this is super important and I’m not joking.  Please get help right now.”

 

The little girl had stopped, swinging her jack-o-lantern bucket as she listened to me intently.  When I finished, she gave a small giggle as she grinned at me.

 

“You’re funny.”

 

With that, she went on past me and out of my peripheral vision.  What the fuck was wrong with her?  Anyway, it didn’t matter.  I started calling out to the other kids, asking them to come closer, thinking that if I could find one that wasn’t an idiot or warped, me talking to them seriously might get one to get help more than me yelling like a Halloween lawn ornament.  But none of the others would come—they’d look my way nervously and laugh a little, but that was it.  And a couple of minutes later, the girl was walking back past.  I could smell gasoline coming from her, and when I looked at her pumpkin basket now, I could see it dripping down the side.  Had she gone and taken gas from around the generator I was hearing?  Fucking why?

 

I called out to her again, but she didn’t look back, and by the time she had made it back to the driveway, I could hear a new sound approaching.  Another mechanical sound, a familiar sound.  The image came to me right as it came around the corner.

 

Langford on a large riding lawn mower.

 

He stopped in front of the kids, keeping his seat as he gestured at the yard with the flair of a circus ringmaster.  “Kids, with all this Halloween preparation, I’ve really let my yard go.  It may be time to cut the grass.”

 

More nervous laughter from the kids.

 

“What do you guys think?  Think I should mow the lawn?”

 

A couple of them said yeah, but the blonde girl and the others just smiled and watched.  Happy with the agreement he’d managed to get, Langford put the mower back in gear.  “Well, let’s get to it then.”

 

He started making a wide, lazy circle across the yard, and I wanted to scream, but I couldn’t stop staring at the mower as it drew closer.  This wasn’t a joke.  The blade was moving and cutting—not a lot, but I could see bits of higher weeds slinging out as he drew closer to my end of the lawn.  The grave wasn’t at the very edge, so he circled around behind me on the first lap, giving me a finger waggle as he promised to be back soon.  I did start screaming then, but the kids weren’t going to move a muscle, and no one else was coming up.  And when he turned back again, he was headed straight for me at full speed.

 

Squealing, I pulled my hands down as far as I could and tried to yank my head back against the foam as hard as I could.  The mower was wide enough to straddle the sides of the grave easily, and I could feel the vibration of it coming before I saw the underside of the mower start to pass over me.  I caught a glimpse of whirling metal before dirt went into my eyes and I closed them, ramming my head down and back as far as it would go.

 

When I felt the mower pass on by, at first I thought I was okay.  My eyes were burning and pouring water, but…no.  I could feel cold wetness pouring down the sides of my cheeks and into my mouth.

 

He’d cut off the tip of my nose.

 

“FUCK!  Help you little fucks!  Go get the cops or so help me I’ll fucking get you all!  You’ll all go to fucking prison!  Do you see me bleeding?  Go get help!”

 

My vision wasn’t great, but I could see they still weren’t moving.  The little blond girl with her bucket of gas was in the front, and while the others at least had the decency to look scared, she was smiling excitedly as Langford pulled up near them again.

 

“What do you think, kids?  Is the grass low enough now, or should I go ahead and cut it lower?  I’ve rebuilt this thing myself, you know, and I’m kind of itching to see what it can do.”  He chuckled good-naturedly to the children before focusing on the devil girl.  “What do you think, sweetheart?  Think the yard has had enough or should I cut some more?”

 

She looked down the yard to me, meeting my eyes for a moment as her smile grew bigger.  Looking back at him, she gave a small but vigorous nod.  “I think you should cut more.  I think you should cut it all the way.”

 

Langford let out a bellowing laugh as he put the lawn mower back in gear.  “Your wish is my command!”  Dropping the cutting deck down as far as it would go, he began moving towards me, but slower this time.

 

“Stop!  Please stop!  Just let me go!  I’m sorry!  Oh God!”

 

I looked past him and saw another couple of people had wandered up.  A woman and her boy.  They were watching with only mild interest as Langford trundled toward me, the little boy letting out a loud, discontented belch as they stared.

 

“Fuck!  Oh help me!”

 

I could feel the ground shaking around me now.  The whole world shaking.  I pulled my head and hands down again, but it wouldn’t be enough.  Not nearly enough.  I kept screaming as I felt the air from the whirring blade move against my cheek.

 

“Oh God help me!  Please ju…”
