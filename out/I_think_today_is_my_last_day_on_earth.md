I'm sitting here looking out the window of my childhood home and since yesterday and I can't see a way out. I suppose I am writing this just to get some perspective.

Yesterday the weather was like most early days, cool and damp. It still felt surreal, only a week ago I got the news, Mom decided to get a DNR order. I suppose I knew this was coming for awhile, she had been sick for some time but it still hurt. 

She was still sleeping as I did my morning chores for her, the farm animals needed tending and I had yet to collect the mail down the hill. Something seemed to have spooked the animals, the horses were restless and the goats kept crying despite how  soothing I spoke, when I offered food or butt scratches. I figured some coyotes passed by last night as I heard their yipping and howling all night.

After finishing up I made my way to the mailbox, mostly bills and junk as looked through them. Only looking up to see four horse riders making their way down the road at a trot. I gave them a nod before walking back up to the house. 

Washing my hands before finding the tv remote I turned it on. Despite her various states of lucidity mom liked to watch the news every morning. Some new war in the middle east, possible disease outbreaks, grocery prices on the rise, just another day in paradise.

I sit on the bed with her, still sleeping, a picture of Dad on the nightstand, much happier times. It was a old photo back before he got seven bullets in him in a standoff outside a meth house he was clearing. Of course this was before both my brothers moved away, one to start his own family, the other to join the army.

One thing I didn't expect to see was a old stuffed rabbit, since I came home I just hadn't noticed it somehow. I stood and walked over to it. Picking it up the memories of when I was a young kid, anyone could see that it was loved with how ratty the fur is, one of its ears bent at a odd angle from falling asleep with it so many times. 

The little rabbit was still wearing a little purple bow around its neck. Matthew 18 10 inscribed on it. Just then I heard a emergency broadcast on the TV.

Turning to look dropping the toy to look. between beeps the news changed showing rolling text on screen.

"Shelter in place. Do not go outside until there in a all clear notice from the Federal government. Close all exits to your home. This is not a test." The text repeated over and over again through the beeps.

I glanced at mom, I didn't see any tornado watches and the weather wasn't terrible just a moment ago.

"How the hell am I going to move you?" I asked myself. Then I heard the screaming, rushing to the windows I saw the animals in the pasture writhing on the ground, screaming. The grass under them shriveling. The sky turned red. In tornado alley I was used to seeing the sky change color but my stomach sank. I could see the smoke coming from town in the distance. I couldn't see what it was but I could see things besides just the smoke floating up in the distantness. Yet all I could see was the writhing animals, I fell to my knees  covering my ears as they screamed. The land continued to shrivel up like unwatered house plant. Yet the horses were just screaming in pain.

It went on like that for who know how long before they stopped. I looked up to see the earth had turned ashy with the end of the screaming. I shakily stood up to check on mom. She was still sleeping but I could tell It wouldn't be long. I pulled out my phone, turning off the tv I tried calling my brothers. Both didn't answer, I tried my friends, it immediately went to voicemail. In desperation I dialed nine one one. I held my breath hoping someone would answer, someone could help.

After a few rings I heard a woman's voice "I'm sorry but all our lines are busy right now please wait." I held onto moms hand. I could tell she was struggling to breath as we waited. after a hour I got up to grab a bottle of water, after two I laid down next to her as she started to gasp. I held her hand as I cried into a pillow. next to my own mom as she slowly died. I don't know how long it was  until I passed out.

I woke around one AM according to my slowly dying phone. The sky looked the same but as I glanced over seeing mom's chest wasn't moving anymore. I put my fingers to her neck, part of me hoping to to feel something. Yet I couldn't feel any heartbeat. I wiped my still wet face before getting out of bed with her. I was truly alone.

Some time later I got up to get some more water, closing her bedroom door behind me. I didn't feel hungry but my mouth was dry. Yet as I walked I could see something out the windows. Some lights in the sky not matching the deep red. They were getting closer incredibly fast. I rushed to the basement, mom was gone but maybe I stood a chance. I punched in the code to the gun safe before pulling out some of the weapons and ammunition.

I rushed back up the stairs quickly loading up the weapons. I could see the lights outside as I mentally prepared myself. Then I heard it. From mom's room I heard the floors creek. "Mom?" I asked in a whisper.

After a moment I heard a knock coming from her door. "Lets go outside sweetie." I heard her say. The knocks were gentle growing more forceful. "It is ok, I am ok now and you will be too." My hands shaking as I raised a gun to the door. 

"You aren't coming through that door!" I said breathing heavy as I could feel the adrenaline pumping through my veins.

I heard footsteps walking away from the door then a *Bang* then the sound of shattering glass. I slowly moved to the door, opening it to see the bed empty and the window shattered. keeping the weapon aimed I walked over peaking through to see footprints in the dirt a few paces out before disappearing. Yet I could see the strange lights above the porch overhang.

They let out a strange buzzing sounding, In a moment of frustration I shot at them *bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.* They didn't move but that buzzing(?) got louder in response. I backed out of the room closing the door before dropping the gun. and putting my head in my hands.

Sometime later as my stomach started to growl I picked myself up along with dads old gun. As I walked to the mostly empty kitchen I grabbed a apple. munching on it I walked around the house aimlessly. Eventually I found myself in the home office. Sitting at the desk I look out the window to see my old stuffed rabbit. sitting on the windowsill. Staring at its unblinking eyes for a moment before seeing the writing on the glass.

"Nolite Timere"

I looked back into the unblinking eyes of the stuffed rabbit before opening the cylinder of dad's old gun. I took out five of the spent bullet casings. I couldn't decide what a I was more afraid of, taking the bullet or walking outside.

Yet I hesitated, the computer was still running so I figured I would delay the inevitable. Maybe someone will read this. Maybe this is wasted words. Regardless I said what I wanted to. I think I can hear distant speaking, the lights around my house keep moving. I wish they would just break in. Then maybe I wouldn't be so scared to use my last shot.

Update: Just as I worked up the courage and put the gun in my mouth, then I heard it. The voices, I could hear my family. All of them begging me to come outside. I cant see them through the windows but I can hear them. God I'm scared. I don't know how long I can last. They are getting louder.
