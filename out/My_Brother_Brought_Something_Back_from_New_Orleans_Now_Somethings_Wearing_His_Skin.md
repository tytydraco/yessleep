I hadn’t heard from my brother Peter in over a year when I got the phone call. He’d dropped off the grid right after Mom died, took off to “find himself,” whatever that meant. The last I knew, he was couch surfing in New Orleans, working odd jobs, and getting too deep into the scene down there.

The call came from an unknown number. The voice on the other end said:

“Come get him. He’s not right.”

That was it. No name. No location. Just the click of a dead line.

I probably should have let it go. Pete always played the victim, always ran when things got real. But something about that voice—it didn’t sound angry. It sounded scared.

I drove to New Orleans. It took two days. By the time I got to the address left in my voicemail—an old shotgun house sagging on its foundation in Tremé—my nerves were shot. The street was quiet, too quiet. Most windows were boarded.

I knocked once. No answer. I pushed the door open.

The smell hit first—mildew, rot, and something metallic. The air was thick, and the room was dark except for the flickering of a single candle. On the floor, scrawled in what looked like dried blood, was a veve symbol. I only recognized it because I’d looked up voodoo symbols on the drive. This one was for Baron Samedi—the loa of the dead.

Pete was sitting in the corner, shirtless, thin as a rail. He looked up. His eyes were too wide. Like they didn’t blink anymore.

“I’m ready now,” he whispered.

I told him we were going home. He didn’t argue. He followed me out like a stray dog. But the whole ride back to Georgia, he barely said a word. Just stared out the window, whispering names under his breath. Not words—names. Old names. Names that made me uncomfortable to hear.


It started small.

Pete wouldn’t eat. I’d cook, offer him takeout, beer, anything. He just shook his head. He started locking himself in the bathroom for hours at night. I heard him talking in there. Sometimes laughing. But when I asked, he said he didn’t remember doing it.

One night I found dirt under his fingernails. Like black, wet soil. When I asked where it came from, he said:

“From where I was buried.”

I started keeping my bedroom door locked.

Then came the animals. The neighbor’s cat showed up on our porch, eviscerated. Then a squirrel, its eyes gouged out. I found both of them placed neatly in front of my door. The same veve symbol was carved into their fur.

I confronted Pete. I yelled, begged, even tried to slap some sense into him. But all he said was:

“It’s not me anymore. He’s riding me now. Like a horse.”

That was when I remembered something I’d read online—about riding, a concept in voodoo where the spirits, the loas, temporarily take control of a person.

But this didn’t feel temporary. It felt like Pete was… disappearing.



Then I found the jar.

It was hidden behind the toilet tank. A mason jar sealed with black wax, bound in twine. Inside was a dark red fluid, clotted like congealed blood, mixed with hair.

My hair.

I don’t know how long I stared at it before smashing it against the wall. And I swear—I swear—when it shattered, I heard Pete scream from the other room. Not from pain. From rage. Like something ancient being torn out of him.

I rushed in. He was convulsing on the floor, mouth frothing, eyes rolled back.

He stopped breathing for a full minute.

Then, like nothing happened, he sat up and grinned.

“Too late,” he whispered.


The real horror began after that.

Pete started changing physically. At first it was subtle—he didn’t blink anymore, barely breathed, barely slept. But then I noticed his teeth. They were sharper. Yellowed. His skin looked like it was starting to sag, like it didn’t quite fit right.

I called a priest. He refused to enter the house.

I called the cops. They did a wellness check. Pete smiled politely. Told them I was paranoid. The cops left, laughing.

That night, I heard dragging sounds. Long, wet dragging sounds. I came out of my room at 3 AM and saw Pete hunched in the hallway, chewing on something. It was raw meat. Not store-bought. His mouth was red to the ears.

He looked up.

“You always were the favorite,” he said.

I tried to leave.

I packed a bag and was halfway to my car when I saw the veve symbols carved into the windshield. The battery was dead. My phone had no signal. I started to panic, started pacing the driveway—until I realized I wasn’t alone out there.

Across the street stood a woman, tall and gaunt, wrapped in a shawl of animal bones. She nodded once, like she had expected this all along. I didn’t know what made me cross the street toward her—fear, desperation, instinct—but she didn’t run.

“You opened the gate,” she said.

I told her I didn’t do anything. That it was my brother. That he brought something back.

She shook her head.

“He was the gate.”

Then she handed me something. A small, fabric doll, hand-stitched with black thread, filled with what smelled like dirt and blood. My brother’s name was sewn into the side.

“You have one chance,” she said. “Don’t miss.”




I didn’t sleep that night.

I waited. Doll in one hand, lighter fluid in the other. Pete didn’t come out of his room until nearly dawn.

He looked worse than ever—bloated, skin sloughing, eyes filmed over like wax. His voice wasn’t even his anymore. It rasped like wind through dead trees.

“Brother,” it said. “You stink of fear.”

I held up the doll.

“This ends tonight.”

The thing wearing my brother looked at the doll… and smiled.

“Then burn it,” it said. “Let’s see who screams.”



I did it.

I lit that thing and watched it blacken in my hand.

Pete fell to the ground shrieking, convulsing. The air turned sulfurous. Lights exploded. The walls groaned. I thought the house would collapse.

Then—silence.

Just him. Curled on the floor, naked  and shaking. His skin was pale, the rot gone. His face was his again.

He looked at me with tear-filled eyes and said:

“I tried to stop it. But I couldn’t. I—I made a deal.”

I fell to my knees. I told him it was over. That we’d fix this.

But Pete looked past me.

And he smiled again.

Only this time, it wasn’t him smiling.


It wasn’t over.

I found him the next day in the backyard. Hanging from the tree, a noose of barbed wire around his neck. The bark beneath his feet was scorched black with another veve.

The coroner said it was suicide. I didn’t argue. What could I say? That something from another world had ridden him into the grave?

But here’s the worst part.

The grave we buried him in? It doesn’t stay buried. Every morning I go out, and the dirt’s been stirred. Like something’s digging its way up.

And two days ago… I found another jar. Under my bed. This time with my hair in it.

It’s not over. Pete was just the beginning.

And I think I’m next.


If you’re reading this and you ever see a veve drawn in dirt, blood, or bone—walk the other way. Don’t touch anything. Don’t dig.

Because once they ride you… they never let go.
