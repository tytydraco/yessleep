Not every photo you take will be a good one, but every photo you take will  be worthwhile. Because you can learn something new from every photo.  That's how you improve. A girl named Darlene Stapleton taught me that.  And even though she died almost 33 years go, I've never stopped thinking  about those words. In a lot of ways the story I'm about tell is like a  photograph that's been underexposed. There are too many shadows and dark  blotches in the frame. I wouldn't blame you for looking away from those  shadows. Even I look away, when I think about them too much. But this  story is one I've been wanting to tell for a very long time. And maybe  in some ways it's like a photo that needs to be developed and shown to  the world.

Shadows and all.

Where  should I start? Well, I guess I should say I never expected to fall in  love with photography. Ever since I was little, sports had been my main  passion. Baseball was my church. By the time I was 2 years old, I was  already carrying around a small plastic bat with me everywhere I went.  By the time I was 6, I had dreams of playing in the major leagues.  Sports were my life. My everything. But photography? Cameras? Film?  Never even crossed my mind.

Then  one day in 1988 when I was 11 years, I was looking in my garage for my  favorite baseball glove, which I somehow lost. I was panicking because  that glove wasn't just any glove, wasn't just my favorite glove, it was  my *lucky* glove. When I wore that  glove I never dropped any fly balls, nor did any grounders get through  between my legs. When I wore that glove I felt like the greatest  baseball player on earth; or at least the greatest 11 year old baseball  player in Jasper, Wisconsin. I was beginning to give up hope when I came  across an old shoe box. I prayed to the baseball gods for my glove to  be in there. I opened it up. There was no glove. I let out a bitter sigh  of disappointment. There was no glove, but there was something else. A  camera

Not one of those point and  click disposable things that come pre-loaded with film, but an actual  35mm film camera. I picked up the camera gently, not really sure what to  make of it. It was silver and black and had the word Nikomat written on  the front. On the bottom in black letters it read: Made in Japan. Below  that in faded black sharpie, it read: Property of Edward S. Trotter.

Even  though I had been losing my mind trying to find my baseball glove,  holding that Nikomat camera, I could almost feel my passion for baseball  slipping away, the way a dream fades right after you wake up. I won't  say it was love at first sight, but holding that camera in my hands,  something definitely switched inside me. It was like the gears in my  mind had been going counter-clockwise my whole life and only now  switched back to clockwise.

My  father told me the camera had belonged to my grandfather(that would be  Edward S. Trotter). He even showed me some of the photos my grandfather  had taken. The photos were incredibly intimate portraits of my  grandfather's life. They were so vivid, so painstakingly beautiful. Each  photo was like a window into the past. I thought if I leaned in too  close, I could actually fall into the photos. Looking at those old  photos, I couldn't believe I had ever cared about something as silly as  baseball. No, looking at those old photos I knew with absolute  certainty, that I wanted to become a photographer.

I  even gave the camera a name. Since it had Nikomat written on it(which  was really the Japanese branding for Nikkormat), I decided to call it *Saint Nick.*

That  very weekend I went down to my town's local photo store. It was a nice  little place called Ted's Photo Booth. Before heading inside I propped  my bike by the bike stand and caught a glimpse of the public community  board. Normally, this board would be used to advertise festivals or  upcoming bake sales, but the only thing on it now were posters for three  missing people. At least 3 people in my town had gone missing over the  past year and half. One adult, and two children. All separate cases. It  wasn't enough to stir national media, but it did create an uneasiness in  Jasper. The kind of uneasiness that made people look over their  shoulders when walking down the street at night. I stared at the posters  of the missing people and the faces on those posters stared back at me  with cold, frozen eyes.

I  shuddered at the sight of those eyes and walked into the camera store.  There was a middle age man sitting behind the front counter. He was  reading a magazine. He had a slightly crooked nose and beady hawk-like  eyes, framed by thick square glasses. He had a name tag that said his  name was Richard. I opened up the brown saddle bag my father had given  me and took out Saint Nick. I presented the camera to Richard and asked  for a roll of 35mm film.

"What speed?" Richard asked, not looking up from his magazine.

"Speed? Well, I guess don't know," I said slightly embarrassed.  "My dad just told me I should ask for 35mm film."

Richard  let out an annoyed sigh. The kind of sigh a veteran makes when dealing  with a complete novice. He eyed Saint Nick. "Have you ever used that  thing before?"

"No." My cheeks flushed red.

"Look  kid. That camera isn't a toy. That's a Nikkormat. Why don't you run  back to your dad and tell him to buy you one of those nice little  disposables. They're pre-loaded and I hear they come in all sorts of  colors."

Richard snorted out a laugh and then went back to looking at his magazine.

"But I want to use this one," I said.

"And I wish I lived at the playboy mansion. We can't always get what we want. Now buzz off-"

"Wow  that's some great customer service, Rick," a new voice said. We both  turned at the sound of the voice. A woman had appeared behind the  counter. She was younger than Richard. She looked like she could be a  senior in High School or a freshman in college. She had blonde hair and  bright green eyes. Her name tag said her name was Darlene.

"Whatever,"  Richard said. "I have other things to do. If you want to waste your  time and show him how it works, be my guest." Then he stormed off and  went into a door with a sign above it that said: Employees Only.

"Don't  worry about him," Darlene said. "He's all bark and no bite. And  unfortunately he's also the owner's brother. You said your looking for  35mm film?"

I nodded.

"But what you don't know what speed, is that right?"

I nodded. And again I felt my cheeks flush red.

"It's okay. Learning photography can be a lot to take in, but I'll help you through it. Turn your camera over for me."

I turned Saint Nick over. On the underside of the lens mount were eight numbers: **12 25 50 100 200 400 800 1600.**

"Those  numbers are what you call your ISO, or you film speed," Darlene said.  "Based on what film speed you buy, you'll set your camera to that  number."

"But how do I know what film speed I need?"

"Well,  it all depends on what kind of photos you want to take and when you  take them. The ISO tells you how sensitive the film is to light. If  you're shooting at night, you'll want a big number like 800. If you're  shooting when it's sunny out, you'll what something like 100 or 200.  Does that make sense?"

I nodded and smiled. It did make sense.

"For beginners, I recommend 400. It's perfect for indoor and outdoor shooting. It can work on bright days and on overcast days."

Darlene  reached under the counter and brought a small box of 35mm film. The box  was green and written on it was the word Fujifilm, and underneath that  was the number 400.

"So if I use that," I said grabbing the box. "I have to set my ISA-"

"ISO."

"Right, ISO to 400?"

Darlene smile and nodded. Then she said, "Now has anyone explained the exposure triangle to you?"

"Exposure what?"

Darlene  laughed and then proceeded to explain one of the most important and  fundamental rules of photography: Exposure. It did not matter how cool  my subject or composition was if my photo was not exposed correctly. A  perfectly exposed photo is one that is not too bright and but also not  too dark. Improper exposure can kill any photograph's worth. On the side  of my camera were 11 more numbers: **1 2 4 8 15 30 60 125 250 500 1000**.  These numbers were my shutter speed. The higher the number, the faster  the shutter. 125 is great for portraits, where as for something like  wild life or sports photography, 500 or 1000 would be ideal.

"But  now here's the tricky part," Darlene said after explaining shutter  speed. "The faster the shutter, the less light is being let in. So you  have to compensate or balance it out. That's where your aperture comes  in."

On my camera's 50mm lens were six numbers: **16 11 5.6 4 2.8 2.**

"Those  numbers control your aperture," Darlene continued. "It's how much light  is let into your camera through the lens. Now it may sound funny kiddo,  but the smaller the number, the wider the aperture gets and the more  light it lets in."

"So if my shutter speed is at 1000, I'll probably want a really wide aperture?"

Darlene clapped and laughed. "Yes, you got it!"

"But how do I know what settings to use? Is it all guessing?"

"Well, you're in luck. That Nikkormat of yours comes in with a built in light meter. Take a look through the view finder."

I did. On the right side of the view finder was a small plus and minus sign, and what looked like a lever in between them.

"When  you adjust your aperture and shutter speed that little lever will move.  If it goes toward the minus, your photo is going to be underexposed. If  it goes towards the plus, overexposed. If it lands right in the middle  -"

"Perfect exposure," I said  grinning. I may have called my camera Saint Nick, but that day Darlene  felt like a real saint to me. I don't know if I ever truly would have  gotten into photography if it weren't for her kindness that day. In the  afternoon sun that glinted through the store's windows, she looked like  an angel to me. Darlene went over the exposure triangle again to make  sure I got it and also taught me how to load film into the camera. We  laughed and made jokes the entire time. Neither of us knew that just one  year later, I would find a camera that was unlike any other camera in  the world. Or that one year later we'd both be tied up on the floor of a  grimy basement.

Or that Darlene would be dead.

\---------------

I  wasn't great at photography. Not at first. It was hard. Not just  getting the exposure correctly, but finding the right subjects, the  right framing. I spent the whole summer of '88 shooting with Saint Nick.  The silver and black camera became like an extension of my right arm, I  never left home without it.  My parents didn't seem to mind. I bought  all my film with my own allowance. I even helped out at Ted's Photo  Booth from time to time, which might have been breaking a child labor  law, but it did get me a discount on getting my photos developed. And  even Richard the Terrible seemed to warm up to me.

I  spent a lot of time at Ted's Photo Booth, hanging out with Darlene and  Richard, learning the rules of the game. One day when I was particularly  discourage by my photos, Darlene nudged me gently on the shoulder and  told me the best advice I ever learned about photography.

"Not  every photo you take will be a good one, but every photo you take will  be worthwhile. Because your can learn something new from every photo.  That's how you improve."

Eventually,  photography started to click. I started taking good photos, the kind  that drew your eyes and were layered in both the foreground and  background. That school year I entered in a local photo competition and  manage to win. I even became the head of my middle school's photography  club, despite being younger than anyone else in the club.

It  was the summer of 89 when I found the camera that was unlike any I had  ever held or would ever hold again. I was exploring the the abandon  train yard that was on the outskirts of town. This had become one of my  favorite places to shoot. The overturned train cars made great subjects  and the entire area was overgrown with yellow grass and weeds and there  was a lot of wildlife around. And when the sun was low enough, during a  time that photographers call magic hour, it became a photographer's  paradise. I took most of my best photos there.

I  was walking through the train yard, when I noticed something in the  weeds. At first I thought it was some kind of animal. Maybe some kind of  dog? It seemed to be staring at me with yellow eyes. I was sure it was  an animal, only when I blinked it wasn't an animal at all. When I got  closer, I saw what it truly was and my heart stopped.

It was a camera.

An  actual camera. Just lying in the weeds. I don't know how I ever thought  it was a dog. How could I have mistaken it's lens for two yellow eyes?

I  picked it up. The first thing I noticed was how hot the camera was. Not  hot the way a steering wheel heats up in the sun, but a different kind  of hot. It reminded me of when I visited my aunt and uncle a few years  back. My infant nephew had been sick and I only got to hold him for a  few minutes. I'll never forget his heavy breathing and the heat of his  little body. That's what it felt like to hold the camera. It was like  holding a sick baby. The second thing I noticed was how wrong the camera  felt in my hands. Despite it's sleek design, it felt lumpy, misshapen.  As if you could never really get a proper hold of it.

The  camera was pitch black. There wasn't any logo on it, but based on the  general shape I could tell it was a 35mm camera. And it had a gorgeous  35mmf1.4 lens. Despite lying in the train yard for who knows how long,  the lens did not have a single scratch or spot of dirt on it. I had  dreamt of shooting with a 1.4 lens going back to the previous summer. A  lens with an aperture that wide would create incredibly dream like  photos. I didn't hesitate. I loaded the black camera with a roll of film  I had on me.

I looked around for a  subject. There was a gorgeous sunflower sticking out of the weeds. The  flower swayed in the wind as I approached, almost as if to say hello.  The camera didn't have an internal light meter like Saint Nick did. That  was fine. I kept an external one with me at all times. I pointed it at  the flower and it gave me the settings I would need for a properly  exposed photo. However that summer I had been experimenting with  under-exposing my photos. Despite what I had learned about the exposure  triangle, I had also learned that under exposing photos did have it's  advantages. For one, it made colors and contrast really pop, especially  with certain types of film. So instead of setting the black camera to  the proper exposure settings, I set it to be under-exposed by two stops.

I  pointed the camera at the flower, getting all of it except the bottom  part of the stem in the frame, and snapped the photo. The shutter made a  dull noise. It was far cry from the satisfying clicking-noise that  Saint Nick's shutter made. I walked around and took more photos and each  time the camera made that same dull noise. Each photo I took I  purposely underexposed. I was going to leave the train yard when I  caught sight of the sun flower again. Based on the counter on the  camera's body, I only had one more shot of film left. I decided to take  one more photo of the sunflower, but this time properly expose it. I  adjusted the aperture and shutter speed and took the photo. This time  the shutter did not make a dull noise. Instead, it made a horrible  noise. One that sounded like bones crunching. I flinched at the sound it  made.

When I brought the camera down and looked up, the sun flower was gone.

At  first I just stared dumbly at where the flower had been. I couldn't  understand what I was seeing, or in this case - not seeing. How could  the flower be gone? One moment it was there and then it had vanished. I  looked around to see if maybe the wind had somehow blown it away during  the short time in which I snapped the photo. But there was no trace of  the sunflower to be found.

Only  that wasn't entirely true. Part of the flower's stem was still there. It  was the part of the stem that had not been in the frame of the camera's  view finder. Slowly the gears in my head started to spin. A thought  began form, but it was too ludicrous. Too insane.

*Did I....did the camera....*

I  pushed the thought away. I shoved the camera into my saddle bag and ran  home, not daring to look back at where the sunflower had been.

That  night I couldn't get to sleep. I couldn't stop thinking about the  flower vanishing and what that meant. I turned over to look at my desk,  where I had placed both the black camera and Saint Nick. Enough  moonlight pooled into my room through the window so that I could see  both cameras. The two cameras seemed to stare at each other the way two  dogs might stare at each other from across the road. I know this will  sound insane, but even though they were inanimate objects, I could feel a  strange tension between the two cameras. I leaned over and turned Saint  Nick so that it was facing the other way. Looking at the black camera I  thought of the yellow eyes I had seen in the weeds and knew exactly  what nickname to give it.

"I'm going to call you Black Dog," I whispered softly.

\------------

I  decided not to shoot with Black Dog again until I got those first  photos I took developed. I didn't even know if the strange camera really  worked, so getting that film developed was a priority, and of course  there was a part of me that was hoping those photos would hold the key  to what happened to the flower.

Normally  the days my photos were developed were a happy occasion. Darlene or-  sometimes on rare occasions Richard - would call my house and tell me my  prints were ready and then Darlene and I would look over my shots,  praising and critiquing my work.

When I came in this time though, Darlene looked pale. There was not even a hint of a smile on her face.

"These photos you took were kind of strange, kiddo."

Darlene  brought out the prints. We looked over the underexposed photos first.  There was the first shot I had taken of the sunflower and the other  various photos I had taken in the train yard. The underexposure had  given the results I had wished. The colors and contrast popped vividly,  but there was something else to the photos. An aperture opened at f1.4  would give the photo a dream like look, but these photos had gone beyond  dream like. There was a creamy-ness to the photos that was unlike  anything I had seen before. The photos looked like paintings.

"You shooting with some new glass you didn't tell me about?" Darlene asked eyeing my saddle bag.

"No,"  I said, shifting nervously. I didn't want to tell Darlene about Black  Dog. Partially because I wasn't sure of the camera myself, but also  because technically speaking the camera didn't belong to me. I had found  it in the train yard and if someone had reported the camera lost or  stolen...

I didn't feel good about  lying to Darlene, but I didn't want to risk losing Black Dog. I felt  like a character in those old fairy tales. The kind who finds a precious  gem or diamond and are terrified of someone else getting their hands on  it.

"I don't even know what to  make of this one," Darlene said bringing out the last photo. Even before  she revealed it, I knew what it would be. The last photo I had taken  that day.

It was the photo of the  sunflower. My heart stopped in my chest when I saw the picture. A cold  shiver ran up my spine. Unlike the under-exposed photo which had shown a  normal, if not dreamy looking sunflower, the properly exposed photo  showed something completely different. It was the same sunflower, only  it wasn't. It's petals were black and withered. Flecks of something dark  and ashy looking were coming off the petals, almost as if the flower  was disintegrating right before the camera.

"Are  these the same flowers?" Darlene asked. She put the two photos of the  sunflowers next to each other. "What's happening in this one? How did  you get the flower to look like that?"

"I have to go," I said flatly.

"Huh? Kid, is everything okay?"

"I'm sorry Darlene. I'll explain it later. I swear, but I have to go."

I  ran out the door, not stopping even as Darlene called after me. As I  pedaled away from the store on my bike, I passed a white van. If i had  known who was in that van at the time, I would have pointed Black Dog at  him and ended everything right then and there.

But  I didn't. At the time, all I saw was ordinary white van. And I rode  past it with out giving it a second glance. Behind me, I could still  here Darlene.

That was the last time I would ever hear her voice again.

\-----------------

I  was standing in the abandon train yard, holding Black Dog in my  trembling hands. The July sun had created a heat wave across the field  of weeds and yellow grass, and I thought for a moment, I might faint. My  insane theory, the one I had been trying to push out of my mind because  it had been too ridiculous to even humor, had turned out to be true.

Black Dog made that sunflower disappear.

Or really *I had* by taking it's photo.

In  the 1/400th of a second in which Black Dog's shutter had opened and  closed, that sunflower had withered away and died, all in an instant.   It withered until none of it was left, except the little bit of stem  that had not been seen by the camera. But why did the flower only vanish  when I took that last photo?

I  think I knew, but I needed to be sure. Not far from where I was standing  there was a wooden chair someone had dumped in the train yard. I took  it's light meter reading and adjusted Black Dog so that the photo would  be under-exposed. Then with my hands still shaking, I took the photo.  The shutter made a dull noise.

The  chair was still there. It rocked back in forth in a breeze that was not  quite cool enough to stop the sweat from spilling down my forehead. I  wiped the sweat away with the back of my hand. The chair rocked gently,  as if to say *"now what are you taking my photo for, silly?"*

I took another photo, this time adjusting Black Dog's settings so that the picture would be over-exposed.

The chair was still there.

Now  came the moment of truth. I adjusted the camera settings so that the  photo would be perfectly exposed. My hands were shaking so badly now, I  really did think I might drop the camera. I took the photo. The horrible  bone-crunching noise of the shutter seemed to echo all across the train  yard.

The chair was gone.

I let a small pitiful gasp. *It's real,* I thought to myself. *Oh god it's real.*  The camera could erase anything it took a photo of, just so long as the  photo was properly exposed.  My head began to swim as I thought of all  the terrible implications. What would happen if you took a photo of a  person? Or what if I took a photo of a busy street, with a more closed  aperture, so that most of the photo was in focus? Would the entire  street disappear, along with every building and person caught in the  frame?

What if I pointed the  camera at the sun? And for one horrifying moment, I heard a voice in my  head urging me to do just that. To take a photo of the sun. *Go on* the voice seemed to say. Y*ou're  a photographer aren't you? Take a shot of the sun and see what happens.  Not every photo you take will be good, but every photo you take will be  worthwhile.*

I didn't take a  photo of the sun. Instead, I let Black Dog fall from my hands. The  cursed camera fell onto the yellow grass with a dull thud. I backed away  from it, as if it really were a dog, that could pounce and bite at any  moment.

I jumped on my bike and  fled the train yard, not daring to look back at Black Dog. I resolved to  tell Darlene everything, but when I returned to the store, it was  closed and there was no sign of her anywhere. And all though I didn't  think about it at the time, the white van was gone as well.

I  promised to tell Darlene everything the next day. But when I returned  the following day, Richard was manning the store by himself. He looked  worried. He told me Darlene had not shown up, had not even called in,  which was not like her at all. Shortly after the police had arrived at  the store, to ask questions. Darlene's parents had reported her missing  because she had never showed up the night before.

In  my head I saw a new missing person's poster being put up on the town  square bulletin board. One that showed the photo of a young woman with  blonde hair and bright green eyes. One that said in bold black letters: **Have You Seen Darlene Stapleton?**

The  news of Darlene's disappearance combined with what I knew about Black  Dog had caused me to enter what I could only describe as a depressed  fugue state. I spent a few days, lying in my bedroom, not sure what to  do. I only returned to the train yard a few days later because something  in the back of my head told me it was wrong to leave Black Dog out  there. What if someone else found the camera? There was a part of me  that hoped Black Dog would not be where I left it, because if the camera  was gone, then it truly wasn't my responsibility anymore. But it was  there when I returned, right where I left it, laying in the yellow  grass, almost smugly.

I picked it up and put it in my saddle bag and began to walk away, when someone spoke.

"Don't scream."

Before I could say anything, I felt two large hands wrap themselves around me, and then everything went black.

\---------------

When  I eventually woke up, I understood three things. One: Both my hands and  feet were tied so I wasn't going anywhere. Two: I was in some kind of  basement. There was a small window that let in just enough sunlight, so  that I could make out the room and the set of stairs that went up into  the house. Three: I wasn't alone. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I  saw someone else lying on the concrete floor across from me. They were  staring at me with wide eyes.

The  light was dim, but I'd recognize those green eyes anywhere. The last  time I had seen them they were looking at a photo of a withered  sunflower.

It was Darlene.

I  tried to say something, but through the gag in my mouth, it only  sounded like muffled none-sense. Darlene didn't respond. She simply  continued to stare at me with her green eyes. Again, I sent out a  muffled cry. Again, Darlene didn't respond. In fact, she wasn't moving  at all. She was lying perfectly still. Seeing a dead body isn't anything  like the movies, where they use movie magic or just good acting to make  the light leave the actor's eyes. There was still light in Darlene's  eyes. They were as vivid and bright as the day I had met her. But there  wasn't any *life* left in them. They just stared.

I  started to sob, and then stopped as I heard footsteps from the ceiling  above. The footsteps moved across the floor and then the door to the  basement opened. Slowly someone made their way down the steps.

He  was a large man, with a bulbous neck, and a thin, wispy looking  mustache. He wore dark green pants and a black work shirt. He loomed  over me like a giant troll.

"I've  been watching you," He said. His voice was unbearably high. I never  would have expected such a high and wheezy voice to come out of such of a  giant man. "Oh yes, I've been watching you a long time."

He  bent down. "If I take that gag out, you gonna scream?" I shook my head.  I didn't know if I meant it. I wanted to scream more than anything, but  the last thing I wanted was to make him angry. "That girl behind me  said she wouldn't scream. But she lied. She screamed a lot. I made her  get quiet though. I made her get *real quiet.*"

He put one of his giant hands into my mouth and pulled out the gag. I started coughing.

"That's  fine, you can cough," the man said, not unkindly. "Coughing is only  natural, but screaming, that's just uncalled for. It's not good manners,  you get me?"

When I didn't respond, the man leaned in close to me. "I asked you a question."

"Yes," I said hoarsely. "I get you."

"Gooood," the man said in an almost too pleased voice. "You're sharp. You gotta be to be a photographer right? Yes, I *have*  been watching you. Running around town with that little camera of  yours. You're a real little photo-maniac aren't you? I've even seen some  of your work in the local paper. You're good. Very good. I wanted to  ask you to help me with a little photo project of my own. You think you  can do that?"

I nodded.

"I didn't heaarrrr you," the man said in a horrible sing-song voice, cupping one of his large hands to his ears.

"Yes, yes I'll help you."

"Goooood.  You see that pretty little lady behind me? Well, I'd like to take some  pictures of her. There are people - all sorts of people - that would pay  real good money for pictures of her, lying there just like that. Only  problem is I'm not much of a photographer. I got big clumsy hands, you  see? And some of my past clients, they've been none too pleased with my  past work. Unless I start taking some better pictures, I might just up  and lose my whole business! Can't have that, can we? Well lucky for me.  Because I got Jasper's very own photo-extroadinare with me today. So  what do you say? You take her pictures, and after that you can go on  home."

"If I take these photos for you, you're really let me go?"

An  insane grin broke out on the large man's face. Even in the basement's  dim light, that grin was clear enough to tell me everything I needed to  know. The man was not going to let me go. It was all just a game to him.  He would make me take photos of Darlene's body and then he would kill  me. I was sure of it.

"Of couuuurse. Scouts honor. So we got a deal?"

"Yes."

"Goood,"  the big man crooned. And then his voice darkened. "Don't try to run  when I take your bindings off. Or I'll break your fucking legs."

I  didn't run after he untied me. I stood up and stretched my limbs. For a  brief moment I did turn to look at the stairs and something inside me  urged me to run for it. But the big man seemed to catch my eyes and  another insane smile broke out on his face. One that seemed to say, *go on try it. I double dog dare you.*

"Now,  unfortunately some of your belongings got, well a little dinged up,  when I grabbed you." Then the big man brought something out of the  corner that I had not yet noticed. It was my brown saddle bag. "These  big clumsy hands of mine, remember? Sometimes I just don't know my own  strength."

He opened up the saddle  bag and brought out Saint Nick. The body of the camera seemed fine, but  the 50mm lens had been cracked to hell and back. Next he brought out my  light meter. It was also broken.

"Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. I really am sorry about that. I hope that camera wasn't your favorite. Luckily, this one seems to be just fine."

The  big man reached one of his hands into the saddle bag, the way a snake  charmer might stick his hands into a large vase, just before pulling out  a king cobra. But when Darlene's killer brought his hand out of my  saddle bag, it wasn't a snake he was holding.

It was Black Dog.

"You think you can use that?

When  the big man handed me Black Dog my hands began to tremble. Not just out  of fear - and I was terrified - but because the man had unknowingly  signed his death warrant. Black Dog was in perfect condition. There  wasn't any scratches on the camera. It felt hot in my hands. More hot  than it had ever felt before.

"I asked you a question."

"Yes. This one will work just fine."

"Goooood. Now get to work, Mr. Photographer."

"I need more light. It's too dark down here."

"Alright,"  the big man said flatly. He walked over to the other side of the  basement, pulled on a cord and light bulb sprang to life. I walked over  to Darlene's body. Seeing her across the room had been hard enough, but  now standing over her, I felt my knees begin to shake. If I had been  standing outside, even the slightest breeze would have been enough to  topple me over.

I had no  intentions of making Darlene's body disappear. I set the camera settings  to what I knew would be an underexposed photo and took some shots. Each  time the shutter was dull.

"Goood, that's real good. Take a couple more. Can't ever be too safe."

I  did and then looked down at Black Dog's frame counter. I only had a  couple shots left. Without a light meter it would be hard getting  perfect exposure. Hard, but not impossible. I thought of everything I  knew about exposure, about lighting, doing the mental math in my head as  quick as possible. I adjusted the settings, turned, and pointed Black  Dog at Darlene's killer.

I snapped a photo. The dull sound of the shutter filled the quiet basement.

"Now, what are you taking my photo for?" the big man asked. That insane smile was still plastered on his face.

I adjusted the settings again and snapped another photo.

"Quit  it," the big man said and now the smile dropped from his face. "Quit it  right now. I told you to take pictures of her, not me."

The  big man lumbered for me and reached his hand out. I stepped back,  turning the aperture ring again and pointed the camera. The only thing  in frame was the big man's hand as he reached for me.

I said a prayer and took the photo. A horrible bone-crunching noise filled the room.

For  a second the big man and I said nothing. We were both staring in shock.  Staring at where the man's hand had been. Now it was gone. Most of his  arm was still there, but where his hand should have been, the arm simply  ended in a nub.

"What the hell,"  the man said. And now there was something in his voice that hadn't been  there before. He sounded as scared as I felt. "What the fuck did you  do?"

He began to lumber towards me  again. I stumbled and fell back wards. On the ground I could only get  his lower half in the frame. I snapped another photo.

The  big man's upper half fell to the floor as his bottom half disappeared.  He let out a terrible cry as his head smacked against the concrete. I  stood up and looked down at him.

"What....what  are you doing to me? What the hell is happening?" His voice was filled  with anger and fear and tears were streaming down his face. His voice  was so high now he sounded almost as if he was on helium. "Where are my  legs? My hand? What the fuck is happening?!"

I  pointed Black Dog at him, this time getting him fully in frame. The big  man waved his handless arm at me, in a warding off gesture.

"STOP! DON'T-"

"For Darlene."

The  man's screams disappeared in an instant as the crunching noise of the  shutter filled the basement for the last time. Then, only Darlene and I  were left in that cold dark room.

Not  every photo you take is going to be a good one, but every photo you  take will be worthwhile. Because you can learn something new from every  photo. That's how you improve. Darlene Stapleton taught me that. I'll  never be able to repay her kindness. I still wake up screaming, when I  think about that day in the basement. When I think about what that man  did to Darlene, or what I did to him. Or how I ran away from the camera  store. What if I had stayed with Darlene until she closed? Would that  man have been so brazen to attack us both together? I never told the  police about Black Dog or what really happened to Darlene's killer,  because I knew they wouldn't believe me. And as it turns out, I didn't  have any proof. After erasing the big man I ran out of the basement,  which had been in a home on the outskirts of Jasper; I ran until saw a  car I could wave down. I had left Black Dog in the basement. When I  returned with the police, Darlene's body was still there. So was Saint  Nick, my saddle bag, and my light meter.

But Black Dog was nowhere to be found.

The  police came to the conclusion that Darlene's killer had been  responsible for the other missing people in Jasper. Fine work gentleman.  According to official reports from official authorities, the Jasper  Killer, is still at large. But I know that's no true. I know that  somewhere out there, is a film negative, that if developed will show a  legless man, frozen in time, withering away in an instant.

I  don't know where Black Dog is. I suppose it went to find a new owner.  Once I thought of trying to track it down, but I knew that'd be  impossible. That camera will only be found, when it *wants*  to be found. So if you're ever alone one day, and you think you see a  dog, or some kind of animal, with a pair of yellow eyes staring at you,  take a closer look. You might find it's not a dog at all. No, you might  find that instead it's a camera. Maybe you'll even pick it up and say, *how did I ever think this was a dog?*

Be sure to take a couple good pictures for me.

Just be careful *who* you point it at.
