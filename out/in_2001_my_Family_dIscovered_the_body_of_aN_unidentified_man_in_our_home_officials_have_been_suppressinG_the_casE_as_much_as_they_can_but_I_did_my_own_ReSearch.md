1/21/2001. LM conducted interview with DC, age 37. 

LM: I want you to know, first of all, nobody is in any trouble here. This isn't a criminal investigation, all we’re trying to do now is identify him, and of course, you and your family were the last people to see him alive.

DC: We didn't see him alive. 

LM: Your daughter said she did.

DC: You can't say she would know living from dead. She’s 6. 

LM: She found his body. I guess she must have seen some movements from him, before she woke you up.

DC: He didn't look dead, did he? Don’t you think? 

LM: Where do you work again? You work at a nursing home, don’t you? 

DC: Yeah, I do. 

LM: So you’ve seen dead people quite a lot, haven’t you?

DC: Oh yeah, man. And he just didn't seem like any dead person I ever saw. I guess he can't have been there that long but he was just… you know in a movie when you see an actor playing dead, and you can just tell they’re not? 

LM: Is it right you felt for a pulse?

DC: Yes, and there wasn't one. It felt like I was being tricked. His face still had colour, but he was cold to the touch… it didn't make any sense.

LM: Maybe it's because you're not used to seeing someone so young dead. 

DC: Maybe. 

LM: What we need to do is figure out how he got here. It’s just you and the kids right now. I’m a little confused on where the father is.

DC: Dean? I have no idea. I haven’t heard from him since July. 

LM: Have you ever filed a missing persons report about him?

DC: I didn't think it would be a good idea to put everyone through that. He’s done this before, he… he can take care of himself. 

LM: Okay, so on this night, it’s you and the kids. Who goes to bed first?

DC: Jules went to bed at 8. Joe went to bed at 10. 

LM: And yourself? 

DC: I think midnight. 

LM: 2 hours before you guys found him. 

DC: Yeah.

LM: How do you think he got in? What's the security situation in your house?

DC: Nothing fancy. I don't have any cameras or anything. Just one lock on the door. I’ve never really thought about it. 

LM: Were you still awake for those two hours? Could you have heard him get in?

DC: I was asleep from there, until Jules came into my room and woke me up. 

LM: To clarify; that was 2am.

DC: It was.

LM: What did she say?

DC: She was saying that there was a man downstairs, she said he was showing her something.

LM: You must have been terrified.

DC: I wasn't, she’s so imaginative, I don't even know what I thought. Joe was there too, he was standing at the doorway and he looked kind of panicked. I told Jules to stay on my bed and Joe was saying that the man downstairs was dead. He just said there was a dead guy lying on our living room floor. I asked if he did anything to Jules and he said he didn't know, he said Jules found him first, but he thought he was probably dead already. 

LM: So you just went downstairs?

DC: I thought it would be Dean. 

LM: Don't you think they’d have recognised him? 

DC: No. I don't think they’d have wanted to get too close. I told them to wait in my room, and I went to check. I went and he was lying face-down. He looked like he’d just fallen asleep. I hardly thought he was dead. I thought, maybe some drunk guy climbed into our house thinking it's his… I don't know. But then I thought it was Dean. Maybe it was just a trick of the light but I- I recognised him as Dean. I was so scared for Joe and Jules, how I’d ever explain it if it was him. 

LM: But you couldn't see his face?

DC: Well, no, I turned him round and I saw him and he was just… someone else?

1/22/2001. LM conducted an interview with JC, aged 14.

JC: My sister woke me up, I think it was like 15 minutes before we woke mom up. 10 minutes, I don't know. 

LM: What did she tell you?

JC: She said something about, like, a guy was in our living room. 

LM: Did she say that he showed her something?

JC: She didn't say that to me. I don't really think she said that to mom either. She said he said something, like… he said something about like, all the things she could see. 

LM: Could you tell me the exact words she said?

JC: She said ‘he said that there's so many things I could see’

LM: How did you feel when she said that?  

JC: I was scared. My sister says some crazy stuff sometimes but it seemed really wrong. Like why would she come up with that? I just thought some guy was in the house and I was like, really, really scared. 

LM: But you braved it out?

JC: I had to. I went to the landing and we can see down into the living room from there. I saw this guy just lying there, face down. I just got mom, I never got up close to him. 

LM: You said your mom locked the door, do you know anyone who could have had keys? 

JC: Not that I know of. 

LM: What about your father? Do you think he might have been a friend of your dad?

JC: Dad wouldn't give keys to someone, even his friends. His kids live here. You don't know my dad, I… come on! 

LM: What do you think happened to your dad?

JC: I think he might be dead.

THE STORY OF THE STRANGE MAN- By Jules C. 

There was a strange man. I didn't ever see him before. I knew talking to strangers was bad. But he was in my house. He said he was not a stranger. He called me Jules. He knew my mommy and my brother’s names. His fingers were longer than I had ever seen. They went all down to his feet. He told me he wished me the best and said there were so many things I could see. I went to go get Joe but when he went to look the strange man was lying down and wouldn't talk to anyone. Mommy said he was dead actually. 

=========

Dear Dana.

We understand your family has had a troubled year. We are writing to voice our concerns about Joseph. We recommend you choose to approach mental health services for him. 

On the 4th March, Joseph was missing from his second period class. Another student said he had locked himself in the bathroom and was “shrieking about something” 

We went to check on him and found he was indeed locked in a cubicle. 

He told us he was hiding because there was a dead man lying on the floor of the school hallway. He said he recognised the body as his father. He was obviously inconsolable. We understand his father is missing. 

Of course, there was no such body. 

We have excused Joseph from class for the next 2 weeks, and encourage you to help him get mental health support as soon as you can.

IMPORTANT; BURIAL OF JOHN DOE 012001.

As you know, we had originally made plans to cremate the unidentified body found on 1/19/2001 as it was of no forensic importance. However, we argued his case may be of some forensic significance. DNA is still pending. We made plans to bury him at a local cemetery. 

This can't happen now, as his body is now unaccounted for. I cannot explain how this has happened, but nobody at the coroner’s office can find the body. 

Lambert was the coroner on this case, and he made a bizarre insistence that the unidentified man’s fingers were growing to over 30 inches while he was in the morgue. I came to view the body with him on 3/6/2001, and found it was gone. 

Lambert told me that John Doe’s fingers had grown to a point where they were touching the door of the morgue. He said they remained upright and did not droop downwards. He had taken photos of the growth. At the point where they touched the door, the flesh seemed to splash outwards and cover the door. I’ll attach the photos Lambert showed me for your interest. 

=========

*Have you seen our dad? He has been missing for almost a year.*

*He is 34 years old, 5’9 about 140 pounds and has brown hair and brown eyes.*

*If you can see this, dad, please call us and get back in touch. We miss you and we need you back.* 

* *Love Joe, Jules and Dana.*

The Strange Man Came Back- by Jules C.

Mommy and I were shopping. I was standing outside the car while mommy was putting the stuff in the car. I saw a man standing in front of me. It was the same man I saw that night. His fingers were longer now. As long as a car. He has put them on top of a car because it is hard to hold them up. I asked if he wanted to meet Mommy, but he said he had met her before. He said I should go back to her. Mommy came out and asked who I was talking to. Then she screamed. I looked down and he was lying on the floor and wasn't speaking to anyone. I tried to explain to mommy that he was talking to me. But she got scared and made us go home. She called the police again.

Body was found in a parking lot on 3/19/2001, curiously by the same family who had found JD012001 in their home in January. We have spoken to the mother and son again, and someone from the juvenile division has spoken to the daughter. We were unable to gather any new information from them. 

We have raised the theory that this body is the father as he matches the physical description. However, the entire family has not recognised him as such. We ourselves do not personally see a resemblance. We would like to pursue this through DNA, but no DNA sample can be established from the John Doe. In fact, we can't match the January discovery with the March discovery through DNA, but you know as well as I do it's the same man. 

I believe we need to heighten security on this body. I believe we should bury him as soon as possible in case we lose the body again. I would like to note that when we first found the body, we believed that he had been dead for less than 2 hours. The body now must have been dead over 2 months, but there isn't even one sign of decomposition. As I send this email, his fingers have grown about 10.5 inches.

*From: Heavenly Memories Memorial Gardens.* 

*Subject: disturbances to grave, marked as ‘Unknown-2001’* 

*On 3/22, your department paid to  bury an unidentified man here. On the morning of 4/16, we discovered 10 deep, round holes in the dirt of the grave. We discovered these holes went all the way down. We looked with a penetrating radar and it appeared no body was down there. We exhumed the grave and found the body was gone. The body bag he was buried in also had these ten holes pierced in. We are working with the police department on this, and are hereby closing off the grave.*

OP: On route 80, right? 

ML: Yeah, uh, this guy checked in and I recognised him from one of the wanted posters. Francis Troy. 

OP: Oh, did you happen to see if he has anything with him?

ML: Just a suitcase.

OP: A big one?

ML: Pretty big.

OP: Ma’am, stay where you are and don't go to his room. We’re going to dispatch somebody right away.

Incident report 9/8/2001

Paulson and I entered room 34 of the Blue Star Motel at 12:02am and found Troy was lying on the bed. He was fully clothed and there was a pool of blood on the pillow around his head. A 22 calibre pistol was in his hand. 

The room was undisturbed. The clerk told us he’d checked in at 10:56 under the name ‘Frank Glenn’. We looked for the suitcase and found it empty except for a suicide note. Paulson noticed there were some dark brown hairs on the paper, so the body may have been in there before. We read the note and it doesn't tell us where he might have left the body.  Paulson and I searched around the perimeter and could not find the body.

Notes on John Doe 01-0807 - Coroner Francis Troy

The body is a white male in his late 20s or early 30s. No signs of decomposition. I would say the death was less than an hour before he was discovered. He’s 5’9 and 145 pounds. Hair is brown and short. Eyes are also brown. 

No distinct scars, tattoos or other markings. No signs of drugs or alcohol in the system. No trauma to the body. I could not determine the cause of death.

Can’t pinpoint any dental treatment having been done,  but teeth are in good condition and all are present. 

I have also had a hard time taking fingerprints. I know other people in the department of tried, but the deceased does not appear to have fingerprints, but there is no sign of any chemical alteration to get rid of them. The body also has uncommonly long fingers. 

=============

OP: Bergen County Police Department, how can I help you?

DC: Hi, my name’s Dana Campbell. I want to call about my son. He’s missing.  

OP: Where’s your residence? 

DC: We’re in Chester, in Pennsylvania but my son’s run away. He called me and said he’s in New Jersey. I called it into the Chester PD, they told me to call here as well.

OP: Of course, ma’am. Please could you tell me your son’s name and age, and any other information you think is important? 

DC: His name’s Joe , he’s 14. He’s got problems right now, his dad’s been missing since July last year. Joe thinks- he thinks his father called him. 

OP: When did he say the call happened?

DC: On Monday. He packed up all his stuff and he told me that his dad had called him, said he was in New Jersey, in the Blue Star Motel. He asked me to take him, but my son’s been… he’s been seeing and hearing stuff that isn't really there. We’ve been talking to all these psychologists…

OP: Is that the point where the son ran away. 

DC: No. I think he was in the house for around an hour after that. He talked to his sister and told her to tell me he was going to get a bus into New Jersey to look for his dad. I went down to the bus station, I asked them and they said they saw him get on a bus. 

OP: Do you think his dad was really the one that called him? Do you think the story’s true or could he be meeting someone else? 

DC: I don't know if the call really happened but he’s obviously convinced himself it's his dad. 

OP: Do you think he's a suicide risk? 

DC: Yes. 

OP: Okay, ma’am. We’re doing everything we can.

INCIDENT REPORT 14/8/2001.

Patterson, Clayton and I were told to stake out the Blue Star Motel in relation to Joe Campbell, who we believed to have been lured to the motel by an individual posing as his missing (presumed deceased) father. We considered the possibility this individual was in fact the late Francis Troy. We put the building on lockdown. Clayton interviewed the guests who were still here. None of them seemed to have knowledge of Francis, the whereabouts of the body or the  boy. 

Patterson went down into the utility room at 12:09AM after he said he heard something moving in there. He said the body that Troy had stolen was down there. He seemed shaken up and we asked him what  we were about to see. He said just come down.

The body had abnormally long fingers, as Troy described. He was lying face down on the floor and his arms were extended upwards with his fingers reaching out of the window. From what we could see, the fingers were at least twice the length of his body. 

We panicked and we called Chief Armendiaz. He said to just put the body in the body bag and close off the room, because he would send back-up. Clayton went to go look out for the missing boy, Patterosn got the body bag and I looked out for the body. 

I moved up to the window to see just how far the fingers could reach. The fingers outside the window must have reached out for over a mile. See photos. 

At about 12:34am, I heard Patterson come up with the body bag and I went up the steps to open the door for him. When we did turn around, the body had entirely vanished.

Psychological report for patient 0145

Joe, 14, was admitted to a mental hospital after a runaway incident. There were many previous incidents of his possibly psychological breakdown. As we understand it, his missing(presumed deceased) father had bipolar disorder. No diagnosis has been made for Joe, although we believe most of his breakdowns are to do with the trauma of losing his father and with enough counselling, he could probably move past it.

The incident that occurred was that Joe got a phone call from a man claiming to be his deceased father. The man told him to come to the Blue Star Motel in Bergen County, NJ. Joe says he’s in two minds if this was really his father who made the call. He recognised his voice, but raised the possibility it was somebody else. Joe asked the caller what room he was in, and the caller oddly said he was in the utility room. He had explained he had a job there and was fixing it. Joe said in retrospect he should have known it didn't make any sense. He never made it to the motel, he stayed at the bus station until an officer saw him. He said he realised that the motel was by a highway and there was no safe way to get there. He was inconsolable by the time he was found. 

Joe is a lot more stable since this incident. He says he has come to accept he most likely will never know the whereabouts of his father. He has claimed he sometimes hears his voice calling to him but ignores it. He responded well to grief counselling. He has reported sometimes having nightmares about long fingers reaching in through his window and under his door, he’s not sure why. Other patients have reported a similar delusion.
