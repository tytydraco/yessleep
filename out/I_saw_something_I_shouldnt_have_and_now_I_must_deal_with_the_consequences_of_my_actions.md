Listen up. 

I don’t know how I got here. There is a bed, unmade, that I am currently sitting on. The pillows are enveloped by the duvet, being dragged along as if I was only thing keeping it down. There is a bedside table, where a lamp dutifully resides, and a phone, unlocked. There is a picture on the wooden, damp wall, that piqued my interest. 

“A happy family”, the inscription read. I can see 2 parents, the woman being blonde, and wearing a sundress, with hairclips on her hair. The man had dark brown curly hair and was of medium build and he was wearing a collared shirt, and pants that were skintight. A little boy stood by next to his parents, smiling happily at the camera, blowing bubbles. The parents were holding hands, smiling incessantly like it could be their last day. They looked magical, a real perfect family. But, this has gotten me into a whirlpool. I don’t seem to know who they are, their faces constantly contorting in my dreams to produce something ambiguous, a monstrosity, never to be discovered. I see their faces scream out in pain, them clutching their faces, crying. The background seemed to have changed, with it being replaced from a grassy meadow to a cold, damp highway, with nowhere to go, and nothing to do, but to suffer in pain, unnoticed and never found. 

The house I currently reside in is nothing short of a dilapidated mess. The floorboards creak every time I step on it. The ceiling is always dripping as it goes, clunk, clunk, clunk onto the floor, and the doors screech like a parrot whenever I enter or leave my room. The lights flicker, constantly malfunctioning, leaving me in darkness for most of the day. There are no windows either, and a distant, repugnant smell of something decomposing is always there, like an infestation, climbing and clamoring into the inner walls of this establishment, deeming it theirs forever. There is a basement, but I don’t dare to go in there, as its dark hue fills me with trepidation from head to toe. It is an abandoned child, and I am its ruthless parent, leaving them over and over again, until they simply have nothing. No physical presence, no emotional connection. It is just a stranger with a life of its own, a life I know nothing about, and that fills me with nothing but ignorant bliss. Eventually, I would have to force a connection, and that could either make or break me, and I do not want to find out which one I could be. 

In short, curiosity kills the cat. 

You might have a burning question in your mind, and I hope my explanation solves this. 

I believe this is my punishment for asking questions. You see, you know nothing about me. I am the son of two wealthy parents. My dad is an award-winning film maker, and my mom is a doctor. This means that I have always been surrounded by the newest, latest technology, at the cost of forming a meaningful relationship with my parents. Everything in life has always been handed to me, so I formed quite an arrogant personality as a result. Screaming at fast food workers, never giving to the poor, bellowing my anger onto waiters at restaurants. I was never a forgiving man, rather the opposite. I realize now that although I had everything I could possibly have, there was always something personal and emotional that I couldn’t have, and that filled me with sorrow. 

I was able to pursue my passion as a graphic designer. I’d work late nights, drafting out designs until the sun came up, chugging multiple energy drinks. I had nothing to do but to aimlessly work on the latest product I had been assigned. I had friends, but they were all shallow colleagues whom I talked to once a day, never being invited out for drinks, or even having their phone numbers. Now I crave it. I wished I had talked to them more, then maybe I would’ve diverted my fate somehow. Maybe if I had responded with a meager “Hello” to them when they stumbled in from the result of their late-night drinking, or had said a few words to them in passing, maybe this wouldn’t have happened to me. Maybe the devil, or whatever it is, wouldn’t prey on me for being such a miserly, misanthropic weasel, bound to the chains of my own self. 

I need to retrace my steps to properly convey my dilemma. 

It was a Friday, the last day before a 2-day weekend, so of course everybody was relaxing, sailing through their work so they could leave early and drink their woes away, working like machines in their tiny little cubicles, producing drafts and determining their designs. I was tense. I was suffering from a creative block, meaning I couldn’t think about any new designs, and a deadline was fast approaching. My shirt clung to my chest, my hair was a mess, and I was hurriedly tapping on the desk, trying to think, think, think, before I would essentially miss the deadline and be deemed “lazy” by my boss. 

A colleague, who’s name has currently slipped my mind, approached me with a worried look on his chubby face. 

“Hey man, you alright? You look stressed.” 

I don’t respond to him. I don’t particularly like this guy, but he treats me much nicer than all the other weasels and impertinent people in this office. He’s the closest thing I had to a friend, if I have to say. Most of them usually come up to me to snoop in on my work, or to boast about their latest achievements. 

“I won 2 tickets to a circus show!” A lady had said to me, as an attempt to reach out to me. 

“The radio show said I could be on next week!” A man had once said to me in passing. 

“I won $25 on my lottery ticket today!” A woman, my cubicle neighbor, had said to me. 

Tch, pathetic. All they want to do is just boast, boast, boast. I came into work to work, not to hear about your latest quarrels and sorrows. Find somebody who cares. 

“Hey man, you alright?” The colleague’s words had enveloped my mind again, in a whirlpool, again and again. I couldn’t think of anything else but those words. 

I snap out of my daze just as the colleague was about to say another word. 

“Do you want to see my newest design?” he said, snapping his fingers into my face, enunciating every single word slowly, as if I was dumb. He said that in a sort of way that made me feel somewhat inclined to come, despite his impatient actions. 

“Sure.” I said quickly, in a somewhat annoyed tone to reflect my dismay at his actions. I wonder what pathetic design I was going to see next. A tree, a plant? 

I was at the colleague’s computer, curious to see what he had in store for me. 

“Okay, so, how this works is that there is a plant. You know what a plant is right? This plant is slowly dying, and then you drag the sun,” He drags the mouse over the plant on the screen, “to here. Are you listening?” I looked away from the computer, and saw two pairs of fully black eyes looking at me from outside the large, rectangular window. I locked eyes with it, and it flashed me a toothy grin, and then disappeared back into the unknown. I felt a new feeling envelop me from head to toe, and one that felt nothing short of horrible. I continue looking at the screen in hopes that I could forget what I just saw. 

“Anyway, the plant has multiple features on it that can help guide the user. It has a smiley face when it has adequate sun, and a sad face when it has no sun.” He continued, moving his body to face mine, “I think this could help teach people about the importance of taking care of the Earth and make them more aware about the ways to treat a plant. What do you think?” 

“Oh, yeah, it’s alright....” I said, trailing off on the last word. 

“Thanks, you can go now.” He stated in a monotone voice. He swiveled his body away to face the computer, leaving me to find my way back to my cubicle. 

I couldn’t focus on my work, as all I thought about was that thing, with its toothy, pearly whites shining back at me from the window. Was that even real? I would ponder all over it, thinking about it being a hallucination from the excess amounts of energy drinks that I had consumed, to it being just a mistake, how it couldn’t have been a figure with those qualities, rather the reflection of something in the office that I had spotted at the wrong time. Despite these thoughts, I chose to work on some website designs on autopilot, not caring about what I produced, only that I had produced something by the end of the day, due to my incredibly high standards. 

I left the office early that day, to everyone’s surprise. I started to aimlessly walk on the street, my shoes producing a click, clack, click sound every time I walked. There was a slight drizzle tapdancing on my head, making my perfectly gelled hair wet. It formed puddles on the ground, as I could feel the rain slowly soak up into my shoes as I walked into my untimely fate. After a few minutes of aimlessly walking, I stopped to check my reflection in a shop window, and was met with my little stalker. I ran, sprinting down the street until I was breathless, sweating, shaking. I was looking left, right, up and down, like a psychopath. I didn’t know what it wanted from me, and I didn’t know what to do to get rid of it. It was there, waiting for me. Waiting to get its prey. And I was its perfect target. 

I couldn’t sleep that night. Tossing, twisting, turning in bed, trying to get that image out of my head. I’d blink, and it would be in my reflection. Blink, and it would be in my office window. Blink, and the figure was suddenly near me, gripping my neck, choking me, pressing its incredibly long and sharp nails into my neck, lapping at the blood oozing out of me. Screaming at me in tongues with its disgusting, sticky mouth, gripping my neck even harder. I was petrified. My hands immediately went to my neck, grasping at it, trying to get rid of the hands that had clung itself onto my neck like it was a baby bird clinging to its mother. I tried to kick at it, but it seemed like it wasn’t affected, just pressing harder and harder onto my neck until I could see the light. I was about to become unconscious just as the monster was getting tired of holding my neck, seemingly uninterested from me not reacting to it. As a last resort, I screamed, asking it why it wanted to do this to me, and it just laughed at me. Laughed. I felt embarrassed, my cheeks flushing. It decided, just because I asked such a stupid, embarrassing, humorous question, to release me, and roughly shoved me away. It started to walk away, as I heard something squelch with every footstep it took. 

That was the last thing I remembered before I ended up here. Sitting here, wallowing over the past, not being able to help myself get out. I feel hopeless, that there’s nothing else to do here but sit and reflect on my actions, and whether I deserve it or not. This is my true punishment. A lifetime of being bound by harsh, unforgiving, terrifying chains, and this monster wants to violently shatter the safe harness that has held me for my entire life. 

I don’t know if I'm ready to face reality anymore.
