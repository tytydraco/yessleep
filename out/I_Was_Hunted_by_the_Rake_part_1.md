My name is Roxie Laney Anderson and I was hunted by the Rake. It all started when I was 12 at Camp Stillwater, a summer camp for canoeing, swimming, meeting new friends, and being hunted by a cryptid creature. I’ll start at the beginning, the beginning of my terror, the beginning of my trauma. The beginning of it all.

	

“I can’t wait!” Katie cried as we loaded our bags into her moms car, “And we’ll be the smartest ones there since we go camping all the time, right Rox?”

	

I didn’t respond, nerves already beginning to accumulate in my body.

	

“Roxie?” Katie asked, leaning her head so it was inches from my own. Her large, hazel eyes staring deep into my own. She was so pretty.

	

I blushed. “Back up Katie, I hear you!” I try to hide my sly smile, “yeah, we already know how to canoe and do everything but don’t be a show off!”

	

Katie stuck her tongue out at me and I scowled at her.

	

“Common girls,” Ms. Bailey, Katie’s mom, said, “Let's hit the road.”

	

Katie and I hopped into the backseat, sitting side by side. Katie could hardly contain her excitement, her legs shaking up and down in anticipation. I stared at her and she caught me.

	

“What are you staring at?” She teased and I shot my head down in embarrassment.

	

The drive was three hours of fun, but probably three hours of misery for Ms. Bailey. We played I spy, fought one another, told stories, and most of all, talked in excitement of the trip to come. Before we realized it, Ms. Bailey parked the car.

	

“And we’re here girls!” Ms. Baileys said, stretching in her seat.

	

“Let’s go!” Me and Katie cried before leaping out of the car.

	

I looked around at the dense forestation, trees surrounded a large, cabin-like building with trails stretching from the building like a spiderweb. A large statue of an owl stood near the building’s door. There was another mom, letting her daughter out of the car to our right. I looked at the girl, she was pretty, with long, black hair and dark brown eyes. I waved at her, but she just scoffed and looked the other way.



It didn’t look like she wanted to be here.

	

“Well hello there!” A man’s voice rang out and I jumped back in surprise.

	

“Haha, sorry, didn’t mean to startle you guys. I’m scoutmaster Matt and I’ll help you carry your bags inside.”

	

“Well hello Matt and that would be delightful” Ms. Bailey said with a smile.

	

“Thank you,” Katie muttered as he took her bag, seeing her mom side eye her.

	

“Of course, of course,” Matt said, “And you, young lady?”

	

“Thanks,” I said.

	

“And what are your names,” Matt asked as we walked towards the main building.

	

“I’m Katie,” Katie said, “only Roxie can call me Kate.”

	

Matt laughed, “I see, so you must be the honored Roxie.”

	

I nodded, he was nice, had curly brown hair with a mustache and soft, brown eyes.

	

“This way ladies,” Matt said.

	

He led us into the building which had a central room with a large carpet and chairs lined up in a circle around it. 

	

“Just in time to get started.” Matt said as a woman began to introduce herself.

	

“Hello campers!” The woman boomed, “My name is Sherly and I am the organizer of this camp but you can just call me Scoutmaster Sherly!”

	

I looked around at the sea of faces, the girl with long, dark hair was among them, talking to a blond girl.

	

Katie squeezed my arm, “Isn’t this exciting?” 

	

“Yeah,” I said nodding, but not fully paying attention.

	

We did ice breakers, played a card game called mafia, then went over rules before learning our bunkmates.

	

It was me, Katie, the dark-haired girl who I found out was Britney, and the blonde girl she was talking to, her name was Jess.

	

“I’m Jess and this is Britney,” Jess said.

	

“I can introduce myself,” Britney said with a scoff.

	

“This is Roxie, and I’m Katie.”

	

We entered our cabin that contained two bunk beds.

	

“I’m on top bunk,” Britney said.

	

“Britney always thinks she's above everyone else, it's fitting,” Jess laughed.

	

“Do you know her?” I questioned.

	

“Yeah, we’re only BFFs!” 

	

“Nah,” Britney said, “I just can’t get rid of her.

	

“Which bunk do you want?” Katie said looking up from the pamphlet they had given us.

	

“Either one,” Jess said.

	

“I was talking to Roxie,” said Katie.

	

Jess laughed.

	

“Can I sleep on the top?” I asked Katie.

	

“Sure.”

	

And with that, the beds were decided. Me on top with Katie below me, and the other two girls to our side.

	

A female scoutmaster named Josie entered our room. 

	

“Timeeee to eattttt!” She said, drawing out each word.

	

“The food’s gonna be delicious,” she continued, “Sloppy joes with extra sloppy.”

	

Josie rambled on and on.

	

“Man she can talk,” Britney whispered to me. I chuckled.

	

We entered the kitchen and grabbed our food before sitting down to eat next to two other girls.

	

“I'm Sarah.” Sarah said.

	

“And I’m Catherine,” said Catherine.

	

“Great, another redhead,” Britney said looking at me, then Catherine.

	

Catherine slumped a little.

	

“Roxie looks amazing with her red hair,” Katie snapped, “Much better than you.”

	

“Whatever you say,” Britney replied with an eye roll.

	

“You look amazing too, Catherine,” Jess complimented, “Don’t listen to this dufus Britney.”

	

Catherine looked back up and chuckled, “Thanks Jess.”

	

We argued and ate, Katie being overly protective of me as usual.



“I can’t believe that idiot,” Katie said, “your red hair is gorgeous.”

	

I blushed, “Thanks Katie, but she was only joking.”

	

We dropped off our dishes and headed towards the lake for our swimming lessons.

	

“Make sure not to go out past the lines,” Matt said, “Not past the lines, okay ladies.”

	

“He can’t stop me,” Britney challenged, I chuckled.

	

“Alright, and with that, have fun ladies!” Josie screamed to be heard as we all cheered and ran into the water.

	

I was the type to slowly inch into the water, getting used to the cold before going under, but Katie was the complete opposite.

	

“Come on Roxie, don’t be such a wuss!” Katie urged.

	

“Babyyy,” Britney mocked and Jess splashed her.

	

Catherine was slowly entering at my side.

	

“It’s okay,” Catherine said, “we can take our time.” and she put her arm on my shoulder with a weak smile.

	

We began to edge deeper and deeper, soft sand caressing my feet. Taking our time with each cold breath until-

	

I felt cold hands push behind me.

	

“In you go!” Sarah cried as she shoved me and Catherine into the water's depths.

	

I gasped at the iciness of the water, my body rushing with cold, but then relief. It was refreshing, my head tingled, my muscles relaxed, and I erupted back into open air.

	

“Hey,” I screamed a laugh spilling from my throat, but Britney splashed water at my face as I emerged, causing some to enter my lungs.

	

“Asshole!” Katie said splashing Britney back for me, Britney let out a witch’s cackle.

	

Catherine emerged behind me, her face red in embarrassment.

	

“Sarah!” she cried and Sarah jumped on her back, both of them falling back beneath the surface.

	

Jess laughed, teaming with Katie to splash Britney and I soon joined. We all smiled, swam, and fought, it was a perfect day.

	

But then something in the water caught my eye. As we swam deeper into the lake, a gray shape quickly swam by our side.	

	

“Did you see that?” I asked no one in particular.

	

“See what?” Catherine said, growing concern evident in her voice.

	

“What are you two redheads talking about?” Sarah joined our conversation.

	

“I saw a-”

	

But Britney screamed. 

	

My head snapped back to see Katie tossing seaweed at Britney’s face. Britney dove for her, tackling them both beneath the water.

	

Then I saw it again. A blur of gray, long and narrow, long enough to be my height, no, much longer. What fish could get that long, what fish could swim that fast?

	

“T-there’s something in the water….” I said.

	

“What? Where!” Catherine cried, her head snapping in every direction.

	

“There’s something in the water!” I repeated, this time loud enough for our whole group to hear.

	

Katie swam over to us.

	

“What’s wrong Roxie?” 

	

“She saw something in the water,” Sarah explained.

	

“M-maybe we should get out,” Catherine said, “get out of the water I mean.”



Britney rolled her eyes, “It’s just a fish you big baby.”



“Am not!” Catherine cried.



“It was huge though,” I explained, “like longer than I am tall”



“Yeah right,” Britney scoffed, “Roxie is just trying to scare us. Ooooo” She waved her hands to mock me.



“Rox wouldn’t lie,” Katie said, grabbing onto my arm, “Should we get out?”



“I-I’m not so sure.”



“We should get out,” Catherine said.



“Go ahead,” Britney said and splashed Catherine.



Jess splashed Britney back, “Don’t be such an ass!”



Britney stuck out her tongue.



“There it is!” I cried, pointing at the gray shape moving towards us.



“I-it's huge!” Sarah screamed, grabbing Catherine and swimming towards the shore.



We all took off, swimming towards the shore, the thing chasing behind us. What the hell was it?



I was behind the rest of the group, my head constantly spinning back to try and get a glimpse of whatever was on our trail. The white shape grew closer and closer and I began to swim faster, my breath barely having time to keep up with my body, my heart felt as if it were about to explode. I pushed harder and harder and harder until-



I felt a hand grab onto my ankle, a cold, slimy hand, and it pulled, pulled hard. 

	

I was yanked backwards and under the water’s surface, a scream barely escaping my mouth as water began to flow into my nostrils. I coughed under the water and kicked frantically, my breath already running out from my scream, but the hand would not let go.

	

I opened my eyes, and in the murky water, I saw a pale face with two lightbulbs for eyes as my body began to grow limp and my breath finally ran out.

	

I coughed and choked as Katie pulled me above the water's edge.

	

“Come on, Rox!” she screamed and I began to move, slowly edging towards the shore while coughing up a storm of seawater and bile. Scoutmaster Josie ran up to us and immediately threw a towel on me and grabbed me.

	

“You choking?” She half asked, half screamed.

	

I shook my head no as I let out another series of coughs. She laid me down and told me to rest for now as the rest of the campers continued to swim. I didn’t tell her what I saw, I couldn’t, I couldn’t even make myself believe that what I saw was real.

	

The girls huddled around me, Catherine looking on the verge of tears, Jess and Sarah’s eyes wide in worry, Katie waiting for an answer, even Britney had no sarcastic remark.

	

“What did you see?” Katie asked.

	

“I-I’m not so sure,” I started, “when I was pulled under-”

	

“Pulled under?” Catherine gasped.

	

“Yeah, I felt someone’s hands pull me under-”

	

“Another camper?” Jess started.

	

“I swear I’ll-” Katie began.

	

“No! It wasn’t a camper! When I opened my eyes I saw a pale face with glowing eyes!”

	

Britney sighed, “As if Roxie.”

	

I knew they wouldn’t believe me. A pale face? Glowing eyes? There is no animal like that.

	

“I believe you, Rox.” Katie said and my body flooded with relief.

	

“Of course your little girlfriend does,” Britney said.

	

“I believe her too!” Sarah let out. “We all saw that pale thing in the water!”

	

Catherine approached me, tears beginning to stream down her face.

	

“A-Are you okay Roxie,” She cried, hugging onto my arm, “how scary that must have been.”

	

“Such a baby,” Britney said.

	

“Hey, you leave Catherine alone!" Sarah shouted at her.

	

“What,” Britney said, “you can’t possibly believe that a pale mermaid monster grabbed Roxie.”

	

We all went silent.

	

“But something did happen,” Jess finally said, “and I believe in what my friend saw.”

	

“I believe in Roxie too,” Katie said, “and, even if she mistook the creature, something was there, so regardless; we all have to be careful from now on.”

	

We all nodded, all except Britney.

	

“Hmph, I don’t believe in monsters or ghosts but I guess I’m glad you’re okay Roxie.” Britney said, turning away, embarrassed to face me after finally showing compassion.

	

Catherine hugged me harder, “I’m also glad you’re okay.”

	

“Thanks Catherine,” I said, glad to have such wonderful friends already.

	

After swim time was over we headed inside for some nature lessons before going to eat dinner. We had spaghetti and meatballs for dinner with a variety of fruits and vegetables. Britney tossed me her carrots.

	

“Where’s the dessert,” she complained.

	

After some camp games it began to grow dark and we headed towards our bunks.

	

“I’ma go to the bathroom quick,” I said to our group.

	

“Want me to come with?” Katie offered.

	

“I’ll be okay,” I said.

	

“You sure? It’s getting dark.”



“I’ll be quick,” I said as I ran towards the outhouse.

	

It wasn’t getting dark, it was already dark. The trees hid secrets in their shadows, the stars sparkled dim light, the-



I heard a splash coming from the lake, a large splash, then the rustling of branches.



“Katie?” I said unsure, “hello, is anyone there?”



More rustling.



Fear began to grow in my body as I remembered the creature I had seen in the water.



“W-who’s there!” I called and something responded.



“W-who’s there!” it repeated my words, but it repeated them in some mimicry of my own voice. It sounded like my voice but off a little, a little lower, a little more garbled.



Then I saw it, two, glowing white eyes, like the headlights on a car. And I began to run.



My feet pounded against the soft floor, my heart aching as I ran towards the outhouse, towards safety, but something ran behind me, keeping pace.



I did not dare turn around, I did not dare look at whatever was chasing me, afraid of what I might see.



“Roxie.” Its voice was now demonic, far too low to be that of a camper playing a prank.



My hand reached the outhouse door and I yanked it open before slamming it behind me and latching its lock.



I could hear the shaking of the door handle, then hard pounding on the door.



“Let me in, let me in! Let me in!” It growled.



But I would not.



“You have to come out eventually,” it whispered with a chuckle.



Tears began to stream down my face as I fell hard onto the floor, my body beginning to shake.



“What’s going on,” said between sobs, “this can’t be happening.”



“This can’t be happening,” it mocked back in some parody of my own voice.



“What are you, please, what are you!” I cried and it’s voice rang in laughter.



Then, I saw long, spider-like fingers reaching from below the crack on the door. The creature’s laughter began to grow and grow in sync with my screams. I cried and cried reaching a fever point until I collapsed in exhaustion, falling into a deep, but restless sleep, full of nightmares.



I woke up to a knock on the door, sunlight peeking in through the small window in the outhouse and the crack under the door.



“Rox, is that you?” I heard a familiar voice.



“Katie?” I answered, wiping lingering tears from my eyes.



A nightmare, it must have been a nightmare.



I slowly cracked the door open, dreading what I might see, but it was just Katie, Katie in all her beautiful glory.



She jumped on me.



“You weren’t in here all night?” she cried, “Were you?”



“N-no I, I just woke up a bit early,” I lied, she didn’t believe me.



“Well anyway, the scoutmaster’s looking for us, it's almost time for breakfast.”

	

I headed back to our campsite to change and get ready before heading to breakfast with the girls.



“Where were you all night?” Jess asked, “you weren’t out monster hunting were you?”



I remembered the things pale face.



“Was not!” I cried, “I just came back from the bathroom late.”



“And went there so early,” Britney pressured.



“Mmhm!” I walked ahead, ignoring the girls’ gaze.



Katie caught up to me. 



“Did anything happen Rox?” She asked, staring intensely into me.



“N-nothing,” I lied, “I just might have fallen asleep in the bathroom for a little.



Katie’s nose wrinkled in disgust.



“Gross!” Britney overheard, “No wonder you smell like shi-”



“Knock it off Britney,” Jess punched her arm and the two began wrestling.



We ate our breakfast of bacon and eggs before heading back out to start our canoeing lessons.



Scoutmaster Matt gave us the whole shpeal of canoeing safety and how to always keep on your life jacket and what not.	



“Make sure your life vest stays on,” Scoutmaster Matt said, “If I catch anyone taking it off, your meat will be in the next batch of food!”



“Lameeeee,” Britney said, Katie rolled her eyes at the girl.



“Alright ladies!” Josie said, “I’ll put you in pairs then you can head out in your canoes.”



“We can’t pick our pairs?” Katie cried looking over at me.



“Nope, gotta meet someone new. Speaking of which, you two can be a pair.” She pointed at Katie and Catherine.



I was with Britney.



“That’s so stupid!” Katie complained, “I don’t need another red head in my life.”



“Thanks Katie,” I chuckled, “be nice to Catherine.”	



“And you got Britney! She’ll probably make you do all the rowing.”



“I’ll be fine Kate.”



“You won't, that girl’s an A-hole”



“I find her funny.”



Katie spun around with a hmph and went to get a canoe with Catherine.



“Let’s go Roxie,” Britney said, “we need to pick out the best canoe.



We headed into the water with ‘The best canoe’ and hopped in.



“Remember,” Matt yelled to be heard, “Do not go out past that small island over there.”



“Whatever,” Britney said, taking the front, “let's go.”



Britney rowed and I steered.



“You’re pretty good at this Roxie,” Britney said.



“Thanks, I’ve camped a lot with Kate growing up.”



We rowed further and further until we reached the island's edge.



“Let's keep going.” Britney said, a mischievous smile spreading across her face.



“Huh?” I questioned



“Let’s keep going Roxie,” Britney said, “there’s no scoutmaster to stop us.”



“But we can’t-”



Britney began to row, “You better steer us out of the way or we’re going to crash into the island!”



I directed the canoe parallel to the island, then we began to wrap around it.



“What do you think is on it?” Britney said, “should we take a look?”



“Definitely not!” I shouted.



“Oh don’t be such a coward,” Britney said, “pull us to the island.”



“We can’t-”



“Oh yes we can! Listen to me Roxie or I’ll tip this canoe over.” She finished those words with a shake of the canoe to show her sincerity.



“Don’t!” I cried.



“Then row us to the island.”



Begrudgingly, I obeyed, steering us to the island's edge.



“Let’s go,” Britney said.



“I’m not!” I cried.



“You’re not gonna let me go all alone are you? What if I get hurt?” She was impossible to rebuke.



I followed her out of the canoe and tied it to a nearby tree as we stepped foot on the island.



“See, nothing to worry about.” Britney said.



“Except becoming the next round of sloppy joes!”



There was no visible path on the island so we walked through the weeds and trees towards its center.



“What is that smell? Is that you Roxie?” Britney accused, covering her nose.



“It’s not!” I began to smell it too, a putrid smell, the smell of death.



“We should go,” I said, backing up.



“We just got here.” Britney whined, “lets just see what's causing that smell-”



“No way Brittney!” I cried, “I’m going back and I’ll leave without you if you don’t come with me!”



I was surprised at my own voice, I usually never took charge like this, but I was terrified.



“Okay, okay, if you’re such a wimp,” she replied.



“Am not!”



“Wait,” Britney’s voice grew serious, “I think I saw something.”



My eyes darted around the woods, searching for anything of interest. There was a flash of gray between the trees.



“S-something’s here,” I stammered.



“Let’s go back,” Britney placed her arm in front of me, as if to protect me. “walk calmly Roxie.”



I nodded and we began to back up, scanning the trees as we did. The thing was fast, impossibly fast. There was a flash of gray to our right, a gray blur that was hardly noticeable. Then to our left. Its footsteps were bipedal with a heavy weight to them.



“I-is it a person?” I stuttered, “It’s running on two feet!”



“I know,” Britney said, “I don’t know of any animal that’s bipedal other than a bear, and that is no bear.”



The thing circled behind us causing us to backtrack deeper into the island, everytime we got near the shore it would place itself between us and the water. It was herding us.



“What do we do Britney?” I whispered as if it could understand us.



“S-stay calm,” Britney answered, but her voice was growing uneasy.



We headed deeper and deeper into the island, hearing the scattering of leaves and branches from seemingly all around us.



“We’re gonna run Roxie,” Britney whispered to me, “when I give you the signal, follow me as fast as you can.”



But if we ran, it would chase us, what happened to staying calm?



“Okay,” I said, my voice barely audible.



We continued, Britney leading me towards a gathering of trees.



“Hunch over,” she cried, pushing my head down, “we run on three.”



I nodded.



“Three, two, one!”



We took off sprinting past tree after tree and I could hear footsteps behind us. The thing was crashing through the brush, not bothering to keep quiet at all.



“Over here!” Britney called, taking a sharp turn to the left. She ran into a small clearing and towards a small cave before I could object. I followed her inside the dark cave, crouching and hoping we had not been seen.



Britney pushed her finger to her mouth before taking me by the hand and leading me further into the cave.



“We’ll wait till it's gone then sprint to our canoe,” Britney said, but then we heard the sound of bare footsteps on rock. The steps echoing throughout the cave as it began to walk towards us. We hunkered down in the dark, my eyes growing wide and heart pounding so hard I thought the thing might hear it.



That is when it said, “Oh girls!” it whistled in a raspy voice that sounded as if dredged from the underworld.



Britney let out a soft sob, tears began to roll down my cheek.



“I know,” it said, “I know, I know, I know, I know!”



It repeated, its words growing angrier and angrier.



“I know you’re in here!” it screamed and Britney began to cry.



That is when I saw its silhouette, I couldn’t make out many details in the dark but I could see the silhouette of a tall man, naked and skinny. But then my brain began to process what I was seeing. 



No, not a man, that couldn’t be a man, I thought. Its ribs were protruding from its skin, its arms were far too long for its body and ended in long, sharp fingers that looked as though they were knives. Its feet were demonic, with four, spiked toes that looked like that of a dinosaur, and its eyes, oh God its eyes, they were like two, white, beaming lights, shining horribly in the dark.



Britney began to cry and scream, crying louder than you’d think given our situation, and soon, I began to join her. We were just two, frightened girls, huddling and shaking in the dark. Our sobs reached a climax as the creature began to laugh, inching slowly towards us. It was savoring this moment, savoring our fear.



“I want to go home!” Britney screamed, her arms tightened around me and I could feel them shaking in terror.



What was this thing? What was going on? I couldn’t understand it. My brain was grasping for answers but I could not find any rationale to our situation, all my presumptions about life and our world did not fit with what was happening now. A creature like this should be impossible.



But it was here.



The creature grew closer and closer, reaching out a long arm towards us and Britney’s screams only grew louder.



“Go away! Go away!” She cried, kicking her legs up at the thing. I was frozen in terror, my body trembling but unable to move.



Then, the creature did something impossible, it opened it’s mouth, then opened it wider, and wider, and wider, then it spoke. It spoke in Britney's voice.



“Go away! Go away!” it mimicked, its pale teeth almost glowing in the dark, before grabbing Britney by her shoulders, its mouth growing ever wider.



Britney did not fight back, she only continued to cry and scream, begging for the thing to let her go, but it didn’t. It lowered its open mouth around britneys head, wet saliva slapping onto her face, lowered further and further until its mouth completely covered her face.



Like a nutcracker, I thought at that moment.



“No, no….” Britney begged, her voice growing muffled. I sat there, still unable to move.



“Mom, I-I want to stay home, I-”



Crack



The sound will never leave my mind.



“AHHHHH!” my screams were so shrill that it could burst an eardrum. Piss began to roll down my leg as I crawled backwards, desperately trying to get away from that thing. The creature turned its head at me, a wide smile, filled with Britney's blood, covering its face. I screamed and kicked and spat, all of my nerves burning in terror as the creature began to reach its hand towards me and it grabbed my ankle.



“No! No!” I screamed over and over as the creature dragged my leg towards it, then it let go and let me crawl away again before dragging me towards it again.



It was toying with me!



Tears streamed down my face, blood began to soak into my clothing, Britney’s blood. I looked over at her headless body and gagged. Something like this could not be real, it had to be a dream!



The creature grabbed my leg once more before lifting it towards its open mouth. I could feel the heat surrounding my leg, wet saliva dripping onto soft skin. Its arm squeezed harder and harder around my leg, until I was sure it would break, then it lifted my leg and licked it with a long and purple tongue.



My body began to grow rigid, to freeze in fear. My eyes were wide open but my consciousness was hardly there. My feet stopped their frantic flailing and grew limp. I had given up, ready to let this creature see to my end. There was too much fear, too much confusion and terror that I could not go on. I could only wait, wait until the end.



That is when the creature's head snapped to the side.



“Britney, Roxie? Girls!” I heard a voice, scoutmaster Matt’s voice.



The creature's hand shot towards my mouth covering it before I had a chance to speak, but I did not even move an inch, I did not even struggle. This would be my end.



“Where are they,” Matt said, his footsteps growing further and further away.



That is when the creature’s mouth began to crack open, my eyes finally focussed, wondering what it was doing, but the creature looked surprised almost, as if it were not doing this itself.



And then it let out a scream, Britneys scream.



I could hear frantic footsteps and the creature could too, its head shot towards Britney’s limp body, its face filled with anger. Then it sprinted deeper into the cave, dragging me with it by my foot. But this time, I was not frozen.



I kicked and screamed with all my might as my head hit rock after rock on the cold floor. I would not let Britney’s help go to waste! I twisted and turned, but the creature was far too strong. Then, as I was being dragged, I grabbed onto a sharp rock and brought it down with all the force I could muster on the hand on my leg.



The creature let out a shrill scream before turning to look at me as I began to scramble away, away and towards the scoutmaster’s light. My lungs burned, tears filled my vision, and my body wouldn’t stop shaking, but my body was shaking, I was still alive!



“One day,” The creature said before taking off into the cave.



I screamed and cried, my fists hitting scoutmaster Matt in fear and frustration. He stood there, unsure of what to do, seeing me covered in blood, sweat, and piss.



“Britney!” I cried, “I-It killed Britney!” and his face went pale.



I led him towards her body and he immediately hurled onto the floor.



“Shit, holy fuck!” He did not even monitor his words, “what the fuck did this Roxie?”



I began to cry, lifting my head up and wailing, unable to do or say anything else.



I cried and shook in terror as he rowed me back to camp, I cried as scoutmaster Josie took me with wide eyes to the shower, and I cried as the scoutmasters called every parent, Britney’s parent.



Even though I cried my heart out, it was nothing compared to Britney’s Parents screams.



A bear attack, they had called it, telling me it was delusions brought on by fear when I told them of the monster.



What bear could decapitate a girl in one singular bite? I knew what I saw was real, the fear I felt, the despair, all of it was real.



“Britney….” I whispered, lying at home in bed. I remembered how funny she had been, how mischievous, and I remembered how she somehow caused the beast to scream, saving me.



I began to wail again.



Katie came over nearly everyday. Teary eyed and full of worry. She hugged me, she coddled me, she told me everything was going to be okay. But how could it be, how could I stay sane after experiencing something like this.



Then, the creature's final words echoed in my head again.



“One day,” it had said, one day it would come back to hunt me again.
