We’ve all been here at one point. Where we are too addicted to doomscrolling on Reddit, I could scroll for hours and never get bored, heck, one time I even scrolled up until 6 in the morning. But I think Reddit is really starting to affect me, it takes me away from my real life duties, like not being distracted at work or spending time with family. I also purchased a ton of books I wanted to read only for that dopamine boost in scrolling to distract me. I keep getting withdraws when not using Reddit.

One day, I wanted something to kill off my Reddit addiction, something to stop me from doomscrolling, so I called my friend, Rob, for a solution. 

That’s when Rob said this:

“You should delete your Reddit account.” He said over the phone

“Really? I don’t want to delete it!” I responded

“It’s really the only choice, delete your account and the app, and try to stay off of it.” 

I thought about it for some time, until I finally said yes.

“Thanks for your advice, Rob.” I said

“No problem, Henry, try to stay off the app!” 

I hung up the call, then I logged back into Reddit one final time, I went to my settings, pressed the “Delete account” button, and typed my username and password to confirm it.

But right before I confirmed it, I started to actually cry. I made so many memories here, the times I could doomscroll, my viral posts, it all came back to me. I couldn’t bring myself to delete my account. So I called Rob again for advice.

He responded by saying that maybe I could still use Reddit on the website, but I couldn’t create an account and set a screen time, so I agreed.

So I went back and finalized my account deletion process.

After hitting the button, it told me my account was deleted and I was logged out of it, then I deleted the app for good.

I was having some pretty tough withdraws on the first few days of not having Reddit, but after those first few days I actually started to enjoy my life more. I spent more time with my kids, wasn’t distracted at work, and instead of doomscrolling every night I was reading pages of books every night. Now of course, I did still spent some time on Reddit, but when I was in my midst of doomscrolling my screen time came and I stopped what I was doing and started to read a book to replace the stimulation I got from Reddit.

Later the next day I decided to treat my kids to a trip to a local amusement park, as they managed to ace an exam and I wanted to reward them, so we got into the car and drove to the park. We then bought our tickets and entered the park.

However, I saw someone I recognized, Rob. He was bringing his own child to the park with his wife as they wanted to enjoy the weekend together, I thanked him for helping break my Reddit addiction and he smiled. After that, he told me about a website which could help me completely stop using Reddit, where it would block Reddit and other social media sites. I was excited to finally be free from social media, so after going on a few rides we all were exhausted and went home. 

At home, I wanted to go take a nap, but I couldn’t sleep. So I decided to try out that website Rob recommended me, so I typed it in and loaded it. I originally thought the website had a link to download an extension or something like that that blocks social media sites, but instead I was greeted with a black screen.

“Weird” I thought to myself, but I shrugged it off as I assumed it was still loading.

But after waiting for a few minutes, I assumed the website was probably just a troll, and that Rob wanted to trick me. But right before I closed the tab, I saw a menu in the corner. I clicked on it.

It showed me a menu of every social media site, including Reddit. So I clicked on Reddit out of curiosity, and it had an AI woman read out things, it read out when an new account was created and the username, when a post or comment was made, every time someone upvoted or downvoted something, etc. But what really caught my attention was that it also said when someone deleted their account, but it was in a much louder, sinister voice. 

I then saw that I could click on different categories, so I clicked on deleted accounts and saw a full list of them, I was able to click on accounts and see their post history, like a Reddit archive site. But I made a grave mistake clicking on their profile picture, I only wanted to see their Reddit avatar up closer, as some of them were quite cool. But it brought me to a page which had their avatar, locked in a cage. It was then escorted to a table with saws on it. Then it showed them, screaming in pain as their arms and legs were sawed off, and after they were dead, they were painted in gray, and led to a room with walls colored in pink. Before being positioned to be facing the camera. As their profile picture was replaced by that gray avatar and the pink background like what a deleted Reddit account would show.

After that, it showed their username get wiped off, and replaced by [deleted]. Then their karma would get reset to 0.

I was quite disturbed by this, I checked other accounts and it showed the same process as the one I saw earlier. Despite my avatar probably not being important to me, I started crying about it. Of course that is dumb but safe to say my avatar wouldn’t be making it out alive.

I clicked on my account, as it was on the website. It showed my avatar screaming, but this time, it managed to break free and managed to break free, and escape. He then managed to disappear, but after that my computer turned off as well as the light, my power went out.

I was sitting there, in shock, unsure about what to do. “Was that avatar really gonna make me pay?” “What will happen to me?” As those thoughts started racing my head. I figured I should turn the lights back on first, I assumed it was the storms that just started that shut my power off, so I went down and activated my backup generator. At least that wouldn’t be a waste of money.

After that, I went back upstairs and went to bed. I didn’t know how long I slept for, but I do know that I woke up to the smell of pancakes. I got dressed and did my daily routine. Then I went downstairs for breakfast. 

“I made your favorite blueberry pancakes! Honey!” My wife said to me.

“Thanks!” I responded. I sat down and checked my phone for news updates, when my jaw dropped once I took a bite of the pancake.

“Breaking news” The news reporter said. “A strange, alien like creature is killing everyone!” He shouted, after that it went silent. And I could hear the screams in the background. He then immediately said the following in fear. “The alien has a blue skin color, with a top hat and black clothes, if you see this alien like creature please report him to local authorities!” The news reporter shouted. The video then ended.

I realized that the alien like creature was my Reddit avatar.

I was the one who started this, I was responsible for all of this. But I was also pissed at Rob for telling me to go to the site, so I called him.

“HENRY! HELP! THE KILLER THAT WAS MENTIONED IN THE NEWS THIS MORNING IS AT MY FRONT DOOR!” Rob shouted.

“WHY DID YOU TELL ME TO GO TO THAT SITE!” I shouted back at him, furious. 

“SORRY! I DIDN’T MEAN TO! I THOUGHT THE SITE’S NAME WOULD BLOCK ALL SOCIAL MEDIAS!” He responded back, I then heard his front door break, as he dropped his phone before I heard glass shattering. 

Then my Reddit avatar sent me a FaceTime request. I was skeptical to accept it, but I agreed to the FaceTime. 

“HENRY! YOU’RE GONNA PAY!” He shouted in an enthusiastic voice. Then he grabbed his knife and stabbed the phone, before the call ended.

Then I heard a knock on the door. I almost opened it before realized it could be my Reddit avatar. So I grabbed a kitchen knife just in case, before I saw it was Rob on the other side. I opened the door for him.  

“Look! It’s not safe to be in our city right now, we have to get out of here!” As Rob started shaking me. 

Then I saw the broadcast on the TV. I watched it and saw that my Reddit avatar was not only attacking the United States, but other countries as well. Paris? He’s already there, scaring off the crowd. India? Also there. Don’t forget Tokyo! Where the entire Japanese military was sent to fight him, but he unleashed a cloud of deadly smoke, wiping out the entire force sent to defeat him.

He was truly insane.

After that, I felt guilty. I pushed Rob aside and went to the police station to turn myself in, explaining the whole situation to them, and they quickly handcuffed me. I was then put in a jail cell, awaiting my trial. 

I spent the next few nights crying, wondering about how many people were dying every day, my family, until the day of my trial arrived. I was sent to the courtroom and was appointed a lawyer. It was safe to say we were losing the case, until suddenly my Reddit avatar charged into the courtroom, then the guards quickly came and shot him, but to no avail. Then they ran away, and I was the only one still standing. 

“Henry, look, I’ll spare you, and the killings if you continue to use Reddit” the avatar said, holding the knife

I had no choice but to accept. So I created a new account and looked back, only to see the avatar disappear. I was stunned and walked back home, as I was greeted by my family who heard me in their basement. Rob was also there and hugged me. They assumed I managed to be found not guilty at trial, and I pretended that I did. After that I went back to my bedroom, where I’m currently writing this. There have been no reported killings so far, but when I put my phone down before checking it again, the avatar was back. 

I turned Reddit back on and use it for some time, no murders when I check the news. I’m practically stuck using Reddit now. Please, help me.
