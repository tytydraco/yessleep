My friends and I take turns staying awake so the dreams don’t get us.


I don’t know if this is the right place to post this. I’ve never written anything like it before.

But if this has been happening to anyone else—I just want you to know, you’re not alone.
Because it’s here now. And we’re not ready.


It started showing up in voice chat. Game lobbies. Mostly late at night.
I play a lot of squad shooters—team-based stuff where everyone’s got a mic. Just kids like me. Trash talk, callouts, stupid jokes, clutch plays.

But a few months back, something shifted.

One kid said his buddy hadn’t talked in two weeks—still logged in, still landed kills, but wouldn’t speak. Another said he saw someone standing in his hallway at 3:17 a.m., but when he turned the lights on, no one was there.

Weird stuff. Glitches in real life.

Somebody in a match mentioned a thread they read—about a group of people way up north going through the same thing. That’s when I started paying attention.


I noticed something. I don’t know if it’s a rule or just a pattern. But it’s real.

If someone stays with you while you sleep—really stays with you—you don’t dream.
Not nearby. Not in the next room. I mean right there, in the room. Awake. Breathing. Watching.
Even just scrolling their phone or playing a video quietly—it keeps the dreams away.

So a few of us made a group. There’s five of us right now. We sleep in shifts at each other’s places.
Snacks. Caffeine. Horror movies. A shared notebook for weird stuff.
One of the guys brings his dog—she sometimes growls at corners, but nothing ever gets in when she’s there.

We don’t call it a club or anything. We’re just tired kids who don’t want to disappear.


But there’s another group now.

Kids who want to sleep.
They say they’re “joining the other team.”
They say the dreams show them what’s coming, and it’s better to be on the right side of it.

They talk different now. Not all the time—just when they think no one’s listening.
One of them told me the dreams aren’t bad. He said, “They’re the only thing that’s honest anymore.”

They’ve started sleeping in weird places. Empty garages. Abandoned houses. Alone.
They want to be seen—but not by us.


Last week, one of them asked to crash with us—just for one night. Said he wanted to “see how the other side lives.”
We let him. He laid in the corner and didn’t say a word. Just smiled.

In the morning, my friend said he’d heard whispering. Two voices. From both sides of the room.
When I looked over, the kid’s eyes were wide open. But he was breathing like he was still asleep.



A couple nights ago, during a match, someone’s mic flicked on. But none of us were talking.
There was just static. Then a voice I didn’t recognize came through:

> “Hold the line.”



That was it. Cut off. No name. No warning.
We all froze, staring at the respawn screen, no one saying a word.



I don’t know what this is. I don’t know if we’re safe.
But if you’ve seen this too—if you’ve been staying awake, or you’ve got friends watching over you—
then you’re not alone.

Some people online started calling us Watchers. I didn’t like it at first, but I get it now.
We’re not fighters. Not prophets. Just kids trying to remember what it feels like to stay human.

I’ve posted this in a few places now. Just in case others are out there.

And if you’ve heard the voice too—
we’re here to hold the line.
