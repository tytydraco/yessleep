I’m writing this in a panic as i don’t know what those things are planning, but i can see them staring at me and running through the woods.

Me and my wife wanted to have a relaxing vacation because my father recently passed in a drunk driving accident, we thought it would be nice to hide from the world, so we rented this bnb that’s in a secluded forest. It’s a dense forest, the dirt driveway is curvy and narrow, when we were driving down it for the first time it was quiet, there were no birds chirping, which was strange because its early spring, and was early in the morning. 

It’s not a big house, there’s a hall with a bedroom and a bathroom that leads into a combined kitchen in bathroom, the front door is a sturdy wooden door with 2 deadbolts, which was strange to me but now i know why. There’s a large sliding glass door in the kitchen with a motion sensor light and a beautiful view of the trees a couple yards away.

The first night we stayed here i was woken up by a loud gnawing noise coming from the kitchen. Half-asleep i walked into the kitchen and saw the motion light on the back porch flickering on, i got an instant cold chill and slowly walked over the the door, before i could look i heard something scurry off, i brushed it off as just a rodent or small animal that was trying to get in, then went back to bed. The morning after that i went outside to see what the animal was gnawing on and saw big stretch marks and chunks of wood on the porch beneath the scratches, i called my wife out to look and we both thought a small animal couldn’t do that.

the night after that, me and my wife were sitting in the kitchen, eating dinner that i had made. We had the windows open for a breeze in the house, as we were eating we both heard leaves crunching outside the window in the kitchen, it was slow but constant, we were both freaked out and i went outside to look at what it was, as i opened the sliding door we both heard a running sound and more crunching of leaves and were even more freaked, we both dismissed it as the same animal that caused the scratched, but were skeptical and wary, we locked the doors and went into our room, then went to sleep.

we were kinda scared to go outside at all today, we stayed on guard and any noise we heard coming from outside spooked us, but we didn’t say anything about it, like an unspoken agreement. at around 9, i went into the kitchen to get us water, when i saw the first pair of beady, dark orange eyes staring at me from the thicket. i called out for my wife and dropped the glasses of water. my wife came bolting into the kitchen, wondering what the noise was, i pointed out of the window at the eyes but when she went to look they were gone.

My wife, seeing how freaked out i was, knew something was wrong and took me into our room and closed all the curtains and windows and deadbolted the front door, it was dead silent, i saw my wife stand up and go to peak out the window in our room, i watched her eyes widen and her quietly counting out loud. 6. 

6 pairs of wide eyes staring at our cabin, my wife is sitting next to me breathing heavily and we can hear them moving in the forest, neither of us have had the courage to look out the window but i know there are more, so many more, their starting to make noise that i can only describe as a stomach growling when your hungry. its 2:37am right now, we’re going to try to leave once its bright out. i don’t know what those things want but i hope they leave us alone.
