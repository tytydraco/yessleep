I should have stopped last night. I should have pulled the plug and threw the set out. But I didn’t. I just sat there in front of it, the glass fractured like a dead eye, waiting for the clock to turn.

The TV isn’t whole anymore. It’s just an empty box with jagged shards hanging loose across the frame, a relic that should have been silent forever. But when the numbers flipped to 1:18, it came alive again. 

I felt it—the claw of panic that I thought had died in me. The cracks pulsed with pale light, spirals unfurling like roots through the glass. I told myself to just watch, to let it take me. But something in me still screamed no.

It wasn’t much. Just a flicker, a desperate spark, but it was there. My eyes went to the plug, to the sledgehammer I had left by the wall after the last time I tried to kill this thing. My body moved on instinct, snatching up the hammer like it was a weapon I could still trust.

I swung. The metal head came down against the broken glass, shards flying across the room like teeth spat from a mouth. The noise was deafening, a sharp crack that rattled my skull, and for a second I thought I’d done it. I thought I’d silenced it.

But the spirals didn’t break. They multiplied. The hammer fell again, again, again, but every strike only made them spread faster, as if I was giving them more surface to bloom across. The cracks in the wall turned with them, the floorboards groaning as black lines wormed outward in patient arcs.

I dropped the hammer. My hands were bleeding, the air freezing, my breath ripped from my lungs with every gasp. I staggered back, dizzy, the room shrinking under the weight of those curling marks. I knew then—I hadn’t hurt it. I’d fed it.

That’s when the voice came. Not booming, not thunder, just a low murmur in the space behind my ribs. It said my name again, soft as prayer, and then it laughed. A laugh that wasn’t cruel but knowing, like I had finally played my part in a script older than me.

It told me this was the proof I’d always asked for. That no matter what I broke, no matter how I screamed, the end was always written. That the fight was just decoration. And for the first time, I believed it. Not because I wanted to, but because my body couldn’t deny it anymore.

The house is quiet now except for the spirals. They’re pulsing across the walls, breathing like veins, humming in a rhythm that makes my bones ache. I can see the blackness gathering behind the screen again, not an image, not light—just depth, endless and patient.

I want to run, but there’s nowhere left to go. The walls are already swallowing themselves, the floor warping inward as if the whole house is folding toward that center. It’s waiting for me. And God help me, I don’t feel fear anymore. I feel recognition.

I’m standing now. My hand rests on the fractured frame, cold biting into my skin. The spirals glow warmly beneath, throbbing like a heart, and I know all I have to do is lean forward. Just one step. Just one act of surrender.

And maybe that’s right. Maybe this was where I was meant to go all along. Maybe this is what it means to finally stop carrying the weight, to stop resisting, to be known completely.

So here I go. Just one step. Just one more inch, just one breath, just one—
