For a little bit of background, my name is Kingston. This takes place about a good five years ago, when I was 19. I was struggling with financial problems, and my family members were either dying, distant, or just went no contact. I only have my brother now, but he isn’t apart of this story. I was sitting in my room, looking for jobs, as usual since I was in desperate need of one.

The hum of the computer fan filled the dimly lit room as I scrolled through job listings, desperation clawing at my chest with each passing minute. Unemployment had become a suffocating weight, crushing my dreams and draining my savings. But then, like a beacon of hope in the darkness, I stumbled upon an ad that seemed almost too good to be true. “Immediate Hire: $39 per hour, no experience necessary," the listing proclaimed in bold letters. My heart skipped a beat as I read the words, hope flickering to life within me like a flame in the darkness. It was the lifeline I had been searching for, a chance to escape the suffocating grip of financial ruin and reclaim control over my life. With trembling hands, I clicked on the listing and filled out the application, my fingers flying across the keyboard as I poured my hopes and dreams into the digital form. The questions were standard fare – name, contact information, employment history – but with each click of the mouse, the weight of my desperation grew heavier, a silent plea echoing in every keystroke.

I hit submit with a sense of trepidation, the weight of uncertainty pressing down on me like a leaden blanket. What if it was all a hoax? What if I had just wasted precious minutes of my dwindling time chasing after a dream that would never materialize? But as the minutes stretched into hours and the sun dipped below the horizon, an email appeared in my inbox, illuminating the darkness with its promise of possibility. "Congratulations!" it read, the words dancing across the screen like a beacon of hope. "You have been selected for an interview. Please report to the following address tomorrow evening for orientation."
Excitement surged through me like electricity, sparking a fire within my soul that had long lay dormant. Tomorrow evening couldn't come soon enough. For the first time in months, I allowed myself to believe that maybe, just maybe, my luck was finally about to change.

As the sun dipped below the horizon and darkness descended upon the city, I allowed myself to dream of a future filled with possibility. I just didn’t realize the job I had applied for would lead me down a path far darker and more sinister than I could have ever imagined.

As Alex handed me the sheet of paper, my fingers shook slightly with anticipation and dread. I unfolded it, revealing a long list of rules written in stark black ink. My eyes scanned the page, each rule sending a chill down my spine.

"Rule number one," I read aloud, my voice trembling slightly. "Survive until 6 AM." The words hung in the air, heavy with the weight of their implication.

"Rule number two: Monitor the cameras for any anomalies," I continued, my heart racing as I imagined the horrors that might appear on the screens before me.

"Rule number three: No leaving the basement until the shift ends," I read, feeling a sense of claustrophobia closing in around me at the thought of being trapped in this dark, oppressive space.

I glanced up at Alex, my eyes pleading for some reassurance, but his expression remained stoic and unreadable.

"Rule number four: At 2:25 AM, check under the bed for any entities," I read, a shiver running down my spine at the thought of what might lurk in the shadows beneath the bed.

"Rule number five: If you hear scratching at the door, do not open it," I continued, my voice growing hoarse with each word. The rules seemed to stretch on endlessly, each one more ominous than the last.

"Rule number six: At 4:45 AM, you may go to bed, but be sure to set an alarm for 5:55 AM to ensure you wake up in time," I read, relief flooding through me at the thought of a few precious moments of sleep before the night's end.

“Rule number seven: If you hear laughter echoing through the halls, do not investigate,” I continued, the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end as I imagined the sinister sound ringing in my ears. As I reached the end of reading rule number seven, a sense of unease settled in the pit of my stomach. "If you hear laughter echoing through the halls, do not investigate," the words echoed in my mind, sending a chill down my spine.

"Well, of course I won't investigate," I muttered under my breath, a nervous chuckle escaping my lips.

“Rule number eight: If you encounter a locked door, do not attempt to open it,” I read, my heart pounding in my chest at the thought of what might be lurking behind it.

“Rule number nine: If you see a figure standing in the shadows, do not make eye contact,” I continued, a shiver running down my spine at the thought of the invisible entity’s that surrounded me.

“Rule number ten: If you feel a sudden drop in temperature, seek shelter and stay warm,” I read, my breath breathing in the chill air as the temperature seemed to plummet around me.
