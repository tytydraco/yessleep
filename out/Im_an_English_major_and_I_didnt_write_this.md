 I know the title seems confusing but let me explain. We were told to produce a piece of literature that is horror which should relate to a character that we might have created in the past for a writing exercise, it's weird I know but I didn't write it and yet I woke up today to receive an email from my teacher who said she loved the unique take I had and well here it is:

*Why do I always write characters that are workaholics and in the spotlight? This was something I had never asked myself before but being an English major, Miss Samantha asked us to read through our own creations and find patterns. That was two months ago and ever since then I'm facing a dilemma, the dilemma of why are all of my characters so similar to each other. This was what I wrote on paper but I didn't mention one thing, why were they so similar to my messed-up version of success? A success I don't desire any more.*

*I know what you're thinking, everyone does that before they develop their own style, and all of us create characters that are essentially Mary Sue or based on ourselves or someone we look up to. I am aware but have we ever wondered why? We as writers can create completely new worlds but we can't create characters that we don't relate with.*

*Often times we say we have writer's block but what if the story's characters don't like the way we're writing their story? Often times we say that we suddenly had a wave of inspiration on what to do and we write and write and write.*

*What if the characters are the ones writing the stories? What if even now the realization that I have had is on purpose, to torment me and to torture me because I can't for the life of me reason as to why, why all of my characters are females with black hair and brown eyes? Why does their sister always kill them with poison? Poison that is essentially an allergic reaction?*

*Ever since the assignment was given, I had a lot of things happen and since I hate journaling, I just did it once per week. So, this is what happened:*

# Week 1: 

*A foul smell started coming from my working desk. (Could work for 4 hours)*

# Week 2: 

*Foul smell turned more foul. (Didn't sit at the working table)*

# Week 3: 

*The whole room smells disgusting. (Don't go there anymore)*

# Week 4: 

*I think the smell is beginning to leak. I smell it in the living room now.*

# Week 5: 

*I see things that are not there. Figures in the dark with long flowy hair. (I'm not hallucinating)*

# Week 6: 

*I can't close the light anymore, the dark scares me.*

# Week 7: 

*I'm feeling better now, I slept the whole day yesterday. I was just tired I guess. I finally went out to buy some stuff. I really need to write something else in this so here's what I'm going to buy*

* *Ice cream*
* *Keychain*
* *Iced coffee*
* *Lip balm*
* *Ladder*
* *Eggs*
* *Doorknob*
* *Hand towel*
* *Air freshener*
* *Notebook*
* *Napkin*
* *Apron*
* *Hand sanitizer*

*;)*

# Week 8: 

*I've started writing again. I just had to remove the source of the smell.*

*She's closer now, I feel her presence behind me.*

*She's getting bolder, the light doesn't bother her anymore.*

*I went out for a walk, when I came back my laptop was on and there was a water bottle,* [*that water bottle is not mine.*](https://imgur.com/a/cxkYzbq)

*She's standing behind me.*

*I blacked out, I don't know what happened. I woke up hoping it was a bad dream but the bottle is still there. One thing I didn't notice until I looked at the picture again is the two pens that I don't own, the panda paw and the cat pen and they're still there. There's something written in my journal, I didn't write it.*

Once upon a time, there lived two princesses. The princesses were polar opposites. One had blonde hair and one had black hair. The black hair princess was loved by all. She was always doing royal duties while the blonde hair princess would play.

One day an important fact was disclosed that the black hair princess would be the queen while the blonde hair princess would always remain a princess. The blonde hair princess was na√Øve, she killed the black hair princess out of spite but she didn't know was that she was adopted.

She killed the black hair princess by poisoning her with food that contained sunflower seeds, then she cut her up into pieces and stuffed her in the wall of her under construction house.

The black hair princess doesn't blame the blonde hair princess, she just wants to play with her like the old times but the blonde hair princess doesn't play with her.

She feels lonely in the walls, sometimes she can get out. She left her favourite items for her sister to use outside. She hopes her sister still likes her and she isn't afraid of the dark.

It's really dark here in the walls and I need a friend little sis, won't you join me?

...................................................................................................................................................................................

*I'm going to lock her somewhere else now, she's getting strong again.*

*She's got me.*

***I've got her.***

Today, when I went to write my WIP, there was a foul smell coming from the wall behind it. I'm not worried about that, I just hope Miss Samantha is dumb enough to not make the connection. She probably won't be able to and she won't have the time but I know you will and I promised Hannah I would get her new friends. And the only way to do that is to picture her in your mind.

For your sake, I hope you don't have an overactive imagination but for mine, I wish you do. But then again she doesn't need much, the hair is enough.

Sorry.
