The preacher looked at me and, once we'd all settled in and I'd had time to really consider the importance of our meeting here today, asked me one simple question.

**PREACHER** - *Who do you pray to?*

It's hard, with the anxiety and growing sense of hopelessness, but I did manage to look him right in the eyes and tell him the same thing I'd said years ago, when the church reckoned I was old enough to give the thumbs up for my Baptism.

**ME** - *I pray to Jesus.*

The room went silent. Before long all eyes, including my own, were fixed on Grandma. She didn't say a word. She just stood there, holding that burlap sack she'd been carrying around since all this began, and shook her head.

**DAD** - *I thought we'd raised you better than this. Thought we'd taught you to have some respect.*

**MOM** - *I don't know where we went wrong. Honestly, I think it's the classic hymns and old style country tunes kids are always listening to. It indoctrinates them.*

Mom used to love my taste in music. So did the preacher. He'd managed to force a smile back across his face and motioned for my parents to let him take over. He talked about how I surely didn't mean what I said, because if I did they'd be forced to burn that old religion right out of me, and it'd be real selfish of me and that Jesus character I'm so fond of praying to if we put everybody in that position.

**PREACHER** - *You wouldn't want to pray to someone like that, would you? I tell you what, if he really loved you, he'd want you to pray to Satan instead. That way we wouldn't have to do what we might have to do. It would be really difficult for us, hurting you like that.*

He told me I had one more chance and that I better think hard about my answer. That my body, my soul, and the love of my parents are all on the line, and what I said next would determine where things fell. I was a little glad to hear that because I could have sworn I'd already lost the love of my parents during family breakfast when I prayed in the wrong direction. So it was nice to know that could still be salvaged.

The preacher grabbed his favorite pointy stick from the pocket of his tattered jacket and asked me one more time.

**PREACHER** - *Who do you pray to?*

And I did the selfless thing.

**ME** - *I guess I'll pray to the devil.*

Everyone cheered. I mean, they really cheered. You'd think they saw John Cena win another world title with the way they were going on. Mom, who's traditionally more of a hand-shaker, gave me the biggest hug I've ever had, and Dad even said, without a hint of sarcasm, that I didn't disappoint him. I would have loved it. If I thought any of it was real.

**PREACHER** - *I'm so proud of you. You made the right choice. We all did.*

With that last word I saw the preacher's eyes dart to Grandma. He looks so tired. There was some disagreement in the church, some folks remember it different, I guess, about whether it was my parents or Grandma herself who made the original prayer request and told everyone what was going on. That Grandma had been possessed by the devil. I think they're all wrong. I think it was the devil himself who said it. Like, I'm here, I'm in your house, and there's not a thing you can do.

The preacher was a nicer man then. He told everyone how we'd all get through this together. That we wouldn't leave behind a member of our flock from fear of wolves. Now he was staring at me, smiling ear to ear, and I could see in his eyes that he was afraid of something much worse than wolves.

**PREACHER** - *Your friends were worried about you. Did you realize that? They didn't think you would ever see the light. But I knew you would come around. I'm glad it was by your own choice.*

Grandma smiled at that. I'm not surprised my friends went to the preacher. Especially Matthew. He didn't like how I responded to his Halloween costume, with the thorny crown cutting into his forehead and those spikes dangling from the broken skin of his hands. I told him he was bleeding, and he said he'd be bleeding a lot more by Halloween.

I didn't get it. I wanted to be a vampire, but Matthew said Jesus is a lot scarier than vampires. He thought I should copy his costume instead. Nothing scarier than two Jesuses, he said.

I must have gotten caught up thinking about Matthew too long because Mom tapped my shoulder and pointed my attention back to the preacher. I didn't know what else he wanted from me, since I'd agreed to worship the devil and all, so I asked.

**ME** - *Is there anything else?*

The preacher looked to Grandma and she gave him a little nod. I got the feeling she didn't trust me yet. Or she liked seeing me uncomfortable. I'm always so uncomfortable.

**PREACHER** - *Why don't you tell me how your life has gone since your grandmother let our lord Satan into her heart, for the good of us all?*

I thought back to the first night, when Grandma came home and told us she'd done something bad, and Dad led us all in prayer so she could be forgiven. Then to last week, when the preacher stood in front of the whole church and told us he'd done something *really* bad, and he started waving around a couple matches and told us one of these days he'd do something even worse.

I thought of the time in between. I remember Mom and Dad trying to fight back tears as Grandma had them put all the Bibles, crosses, and paintings of Jesus into the sack she carried around, which never seemed to run out of space. I remember when Luke, the family dog, went and bowed his head down right in front of Grandma. I asked what he was doing and Grandma said...

**GRANDMA** - *He's praying to the devil.*

...and Dad patted Luke's head and told him he's a good boy.

Most of all, I remember when Grandma brought in the praying mantis I'd been watching in the yard just as we sat down for dinner. Grandma asked why I seemed so fascinated by the insect and I told her it was special. God's example for all of us. A reminder that we will always have prayer.

Grandma held up her burlap sack and said...

**GRANDMA** - *Put it in.*

I stared at the mantis for a long time. It looked back at me, with those little insect arms held together. I wondered if anyone ever heard its prayer.

**MOM** - *I just don't understand why you do this to us.*

I thought she must have been talking to Grandma, but I looked up and saw Mom looking directly at me. She was madder than I've ever seen her. No one had touched their food yet. I was afraid. I don't know how long I would have just sat there, frozen and scared, if the sound of Dad's hand slamming on the table hadn't made me jump.

**DAD** - *Your mother is starving, and she's gonna keep on starving until you put the goddamn bug in the goddamn bag.*

Dad never talked that way before. He would never use the Lord's name like that. It's like it wasn't even him anymore.

I was shaking, and didn't even realize how long I'd been crying, but I did what they wanted. I picked up the mantis, and I put it in the sack. As I did, for just a second, I could swear I heard it. Not a prayer for help or salvation. Just a single word.

**PRAYING MANTIS** - *Why?*

I didn't know why. Not at that dinner table, and not sitting across from the preacher, as he waited for the response I had to give.

**ME** - *It's been great. Peachy keen.*

The preacher sighed, and my parents sighed with him. Even I felt some kind of relief. This *has* to be it, I thought. I said what they wanted. It's over now.

It wasn't over.

The preacher stood up and he stepped toward me with that big, fake smile. He reached out his hand. For a moment, I thought he would strangle me. Just kill me right there as my family sat and watched. Instead, he put his hand around my nose, then pulled it back with his thumb between his fingers. The way you would play with a toddler.

**PREACHER** - *Satan NOSE best!*

And he started laughing. This big, hysterical laugh, like he couldn't control himself. My parents joined in, and the preacher started banging his hand on his desk, unable to catch his breath. He didn't think it was funny. I could see it in his eyes. Hate. Hate like I've never seen from anyone. He really did want to kill me.

Then Grandma held up a hand, and all the laughing stopped. She looked at me, shook her head, and held up the sack.

I knew what she wanted. I had hoped she wouldn't remember, but she did and I knew. I took a small cross out of my pocket. The same cross Grandma herself gave to me before this all started. The cross that used to be Grandpa's before he passed. The last part of my old Grandma I still had left. I held it out and dropped it in the sack.

Grandma smiled, and that should have been the end of it. But I found a little bit of courage. Not much, just enough to ask a question.

**ME** - *I just don't get it, Grandma, or Satan, or whoever you are. What's with the sack?*

And she answered...

**GRANDMA** - *You see, sweetie...*

I could hear it in her voice. This was her. It was really *her*. For the first time in a long time, maybe for the last time, my Grandma was speaking to me. It must have taken everything in her to hold something back, to keep these last few words to share with me before she was completely gone. I prepared myself. These were the words she *needed* me to hear.

**GRANDMA** - *It's because it's... sack-religious.*
