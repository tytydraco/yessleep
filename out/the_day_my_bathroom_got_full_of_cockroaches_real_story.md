there are no demons in this story. no weird creatures, and even not danger. but if you dont like cockroaches, i dont recommend reading this story. i repeat what i said in the title: this story was real. completely, and its more like a disgusting experience rather than a scary experience.

it was a stormy night, my mom, my sister and me were on the lower floor, when my sister wanted to go to the bathroom. when she entered the bathroom, she saw the horror. the entire bathroom was full of cockroaches. on the wall, on the ceiling, and of course, on the floor.

i need to say, that bathroom was a comfortable place for cockroaches on rainy days, it was common to see one or two running around, but this... this had never happened before... 

me and my sister were freaked out. my mom left to search an insecticide in order to kill these bastards. when she came back, she throw a lot of insecticide.

we saw a short of my dad, there were cockroaches inside it. my mom, with a fast move, throwed it on the floor and all the cockroaches came outside. she took a sandal amd started killing one two three four five six and more cockroaches.

i dont remember if we helped to kill the cockroaches, but i think i got a little traumatized. i hope no one live what i live (except if you like cockroaches)

it was like a nightmare. i have no proves that happened, because i was a kid. but we reconstructed the bathroom, because we found the cause of the cockroaches coming to our bathroom. were the pipes. the pipes of our bathroom were not well-constructed, and the cockroaches toke advantage of it. our bathroom was not that big, like 4Ã—4 or less approximately. i only go to that bathroom only in emergency cases, but i always preffered the upper-floor bathroom, its bigger and we didnt found so much cockroaches. after that event, i didnt wanted to see more cockroaches on my life, but unfortunately, thats impossible.

i dont remember if my dad said something about it or not, but he never was scared of cockroaches, i dint understand him, anyway... 

i had a similar experience one time, when i came to the same bathroom, (i think this was before the bathroom got full of cockroaches) i decided to go to the bathroom, and i closed the door, but before tht, i had a bad sensation, like if i closed that door, i would live a bad experience, but i ignored it, and... 

a cockroache came from under the toilet. it ran after me, but the worst of all, is that i wasnt wearing anything on my foots, so the cockroache touched my foot over and over again, and all i could do, was lift myself up with a drawer there was in there, hoping that cockroache wont touch my foot anymore. i screamed and screamed, until my dad came mad to the bathroom. he opened and i jumped outside the bathroom. i explained him what happened, but instead of understanding, he told me it was just a cockroache and i was just exagerating...
