It's 3am and what happened to me can only be described as pure insanity, improbability and horror.

For context when I was a little boy I used to have this reoccurring sleep paralysis where I couldn't move, I was half awake and I was attacked by a monster. Haven't had such a dream ever since..

Now, maybe 3-4 years ago was the first time I ever discovered lucid dreaming. This period I sometimes passively tried to have a lucid dream, I only knew how to do the reality clues and knew what to expect.

It didn't work out at the time but a couple of years later I had maybe two 'lucid' dreams where during a dream I realized that I was sleeping, everything was foggy and I could move wherever I want, and I would wake up fully in 10-15 seconds..

Here comes the 'fun' part, the main story.

This night I was having a nightmare that was hyper realistic, you know when you fall asleep on your arm and can't move it? Well my nightmare was that I couldn't move parts of my body, be it my jaw, my face, my arms, hands..

The thing is I 'woke' up from this nightmare like 5 times 
just to have the same dream. This convinced me that I am actually parazlied. I don't know if I really woke up but probably did for real. I remember upon waking up that my hand was below my head so I thought that's the reason for the dream but it was repeating.

What also makes this dream so realistic is because it was all happening in my house, in the rooms I live..

As I was repeatedly having this paralysis I tried to check my phone in my dream to google my paralysis and upon reaching for it I 'woke' up (don't know for sure). Then I fell asleep in the same dream AGAIN.

Now I truly realized that this simply can't be real, I am dreaming, so my mind clicked thanks to those lucid dream yt videos and I tried to fly. I was successful and I was floating in my room..

(Just to clarify this dream was insanely realistic, I didn't have the dream fog that happens in a lucid dream, everything was crystal clear and super sharp but the walls started to feel wobbly)

I know from previous experience that this flying was the best way to wake up. After 10 seconds of flying I fell down and 'woke up' (probably not?) but I was instantly again in this room and I couldn't fly anymore no matter how hard I tried. I was also getting paralyzed again and everything was even x10 times more hyper realistic!

This time I was 100% sure that I was in reality and that I was actually parazlied, yes I was terrified. There is one thing that bugs me a lot and I can't forgive myself for it. I never used those reality check like pressing your hand and looking at your fingers. This truly disappoints me because I would've gained full control again, I could've  but I didn't think of it even when I was half aware because I am not into lucid dreaming like you guys...

And thank the Lord I actually woke up right there.

If I was actually doing reality check in person I could've maybe turned this nightmare into an epic lucid dream because I was in such a deep state but I couldn't.

Also maybe a couple of days ago I had a mini dream about not being able to move parts of my body, it may be related somewhat. I also truly believe that I was actually awake these 4-5 times, that is sleep paralysis most likely.

This whole experience happened in a an hour and a half irl..

And that's the whole story, if you are still here thank you. What do you think of this whole situation? It was not your typical paralysis but an infinite loop of suffering and there was no monster..
