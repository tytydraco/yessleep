If anyone reads this, it means the wall separating us has weakened enough for my message to post.

In my world, mirrors are not just reflections. They are doorways—incomplete ones, fractured across our two worlds like thin sheets of frozen water. Thanks to something in recent history though, we see something in them now, something not quite ours.

Most of the time, the barrier holds. But every ten years, during what we call the Change, the air shivers and light bends. The glass begins to pulse faintly, like it’s breathing. The reflections don’t match perfectly anymore. You see people you don’t recognize moving behind your own eyes.

For a few hours, the mirrors stop being mirrors. They become one-way windows. You can look through them into another version of Earth — yours, maybe — though no one’s ever proved which one it is. We’re told not to approach them, but everyone does. Curiosity always wins over fear. That’s how I found out they connect to you.

I set my old laptop on the desk and tilted it toward the mirror. The reflection didn’t follow. It slid, just slightly, out of sync—half a frame off. I reached toward it, and when the glass rippled, the laptop disappeared.

It didn’t fall. It didn’t fade. It simply wasn’t there anymore.
That’s how I know you’re real.

If you’re reading this, it means the message came through as I hoped. I managed to open it—your reflection of it, I think—and type it from my computer to the one posting this. The connection won’t last long; the barrier will close once the Change ends. I need to warn you about what’s happening on this side, before the Lamb returns. 



It calls itself the Lamb. That’s not the name we gave it. It placed the word directly into my mind, soft as a prayer, quiet as a heartbeat. Meek, it says. Gentle. But it is older than the universe. Patient. Infinite. And every ten years, it returns.

Everyone hears it. Everyone obeys. But nobody perceives it the same way. My father saw a figure of light, tall and robed, wings folded at its sides. My neighbor sees a swarm of insects forming a person. I see a thin human outline draped in shifting cloth, impossibly tall, and a face no one can comprehend.

The face—nobody can explain it. Some say it is blurred, a smear too soft for vision. Others say it is too detailed, a thousand impossible features shifting at once. When you look, pressure blooms behind your eyes, a memory trying to form but failing. You cannot describe it, but you cannot forget it. It follows you into dreams.

It does not destroy the world. Life continues. Trains run. Children attend school. Markets open. Governments operate. The clocks tick. And yet something is wrong. Streets bend subtly. Buildings lean. Faces shift. Words vanish overnight. And everyone obeys, because the Lamb whispers in their heads.

January 1st, 2000. The first Change. The sky split into iridescent glassy blue and yellow, tiles stretching like honeycomb across the horizon in a color wave. Satellites blacked out. Communications froze. And then the whisper began. It told us what to do, and we obeyed. The Directive appeared soon after, faceless, claiming to interpret the Lamb’s will. People called it New Jerusalem. Most believed. Who could resist what cannot be resisted?

My father dragged me to the services. I was eight. Outside, a man shouted, “God may have been our savior thousands of years ago, but what’s he done lately? He’s watched us suffer! I’d rather pray to the thing that can kill us!” My father struck him. Later, he admitted he had seen the Lamb differently—like a lion.

The instructions are subtle, pervasive, inescapable. Some follow blindly, rationalizing every small act. Others twist it into cults, carving hexagonal marks into their skin, chanting names we dare not speak aloud. A few try to resist, and find their own thoughts shifting, nudged, overwritten. We obey, and do not know why.

The world adapted in strange ways. War stopped, officially. Armies remain in barracks, navies in port. Yet tensions between nations are higher than ever. Borders stiffen. Diplomats grow taut. Minor disputes threaten everything, but the Lamb keeps the chaos from erupting. Humanity is trapped in a constant, simmering brinkmanship—obedient, yet terrified.

Since then, two more Changes. Each time, life resumes seamlessly. But reality thins. Shadows stretch. Children draw patterns older than writing. Reflections move strangely. The whisper touches every mind differently, yet the outcome is the same. The world obeys. And we pretend to forget.

I call it preparation. The Directive calls it alignment. The faithful call it ascension. Underground, the blasphemers call it devourer, and speak in secret of a hunger beneath its human shape. Everyone lives under instructions no one can refuse, but interprets them differently. Some see mercy. Some see annihilation. Some see a shepherd. Some see a predator.

I write here because the network here is monitored, but the mirrors might not be. They say the glass remembers light from both sides. I’ve angled mine toward an old monitor, and every keystroke flickers faintly on the reflection—symbols, then words. Maybe they’ll appear where you are.

Tomorrow, the sky will bloom again. Hexagons will stretch horizon to horizon. And the whisper will enter our minds once more. Human-shaped, towering, faceless, incomprehensible. No matter the form you see, it watches. You will obey. You will act. You will feel it within you.

If this reaches you, remember the name. When the mirrors ripple, do not look too long.

It calls itself gentle. But what kind of shepherd remakes the flock every ten years? What kind of lamb rewrites the world, whispers in every mind, and reshapes nations without bloodshed?

If the mirrors in your world start breathing—don’t look for your reflection. It’s trying to find you too.
