I'm not crazy. My team and I invented the first time machine. You'd probably never heard about it because it doesn't exist.

 

Sounds crazy, right? Let me explain....



I'm working at a government owned-lab that specializes in such unrealistic inventions. The breakthroughs we made sometimes appear in the news, but it would suffice to say that we are far more advanced in technology than what is portrayed in the media. Anyway, I was the lead researcher in a project that was assigned to find a way to reshape the future. After approximately 13 years of research, we finally managed to put together a machine that could send one man across time, albeit only up to 15 years beyond or back.



After we confirmed that this thing really could travel back in time and was possible to interact with people- I personally went back 12 hours and gave our pain-in-the-neck manager a nice punch in the nose, which made him show up today with a bandage- one of our researchers, a guy named Dylan, wanted to see the future 15 years from now, and hopped on before we could stop him.



He showed up 30 minutes later, his eyes wild, a drawn look on his features, with something akin to pure terror and disgust showing on his face. Dylan didn't even respond even when we asked him all kinds of questions on what happened, but ignored us and rushed straight out, muttering something all the while. One of the other researchers said he thought it sounded like, "It's finished. It's all finished," but thought it wasn't much to worry about-probably, he said, Dylan saw some new tech he didn't understand and was too shell-shocked.

  
Why....Why didn't I follow him? Why did I let myself be persuaded?

  
That night, I was the last to leave the office, having written a short draft of the report I would be submitting to my boss tomorrow. I made sure to leave out the part where my co-researcher traveled 15 years in the future, as the high-ups wouldn't approve of such behavior. I had finished and was turning off my laptop when there sounded a clunk in the back of the office. "Who's there?" I asked.

  
To my utter astonishment, Dylan came into view, holding what looked like a gun. "Dylan? W-What are you doing with that?"

  
He came up to me. "You're still here, Doc? Good. This'll make it easier."

  
"Put that gun down. What do you think you're doing with that here?" I asked, trying to sound more annoyed than scared.

  
"I've seen the future, doc. I've seen it, and it's all finished. We finished it, when we made that infernal thing. And I am going to set things right." he said, pointing to the time machine in the center of the lab, a wild but determined gleam in his eye.

  
"Calm down, man! You're talking nonsense!" I shouted, hoping the noise would alert security.

  
"Mad, do you think me, doc?" Dylan cried, stepping forward, raising the gun. "It was your fault-your f\*\*king fault all that mess happened- or will happen, 15 years from now! All your fault, and you're the one calling me mad?"

  
"Well take a look at yourself, shouting things no one can understand, blaming me for something you won't even bother to tell to us, and then say whether you haven't lost your marbles or not!" I shot back. "Whatever you saw, it addled your brains Dylan. You're suspended until further notice. Now get out of here!"

  
He raised his gun. "You'll understand, doc, if you'd seen what I saw." and without further ado, he pulled the trigger.

  
As I fell to the floor, the last thing I saw was Dylan boarding the time machine, a determined look on his face.

  
I'm writing this in the hospital. The doctors say I narrowly escaped dying, and that my wound was caused by an unidentified shooter.

  
But here's the thing- I tried telling them about Dylan, you see, but they insisted I was making things up due to trauma. I contacted my lab, but everyone on my team- including Dylan, apparently never worked there. Everything related to my research on time travel for the last 13 years, including the contacts of my project team members, has disappeared, as if they never existed. The lab informs me the time travel project was scrapped before it took off due to 'unexpected circumstances.' 

  
And when I, in sheer desperation, looked up my fellow researchers, they coincidentally were murdered 13 years ago, right before we started working on this time travel mission. According to the articles, the culprit vanished after the last murder, his final victim being a scientist named- you guessed it- Dylan. 

  
I'm still wondering. What did Dylan saw in the future that made him kill everyone-including himself-to ensure the project never began?
