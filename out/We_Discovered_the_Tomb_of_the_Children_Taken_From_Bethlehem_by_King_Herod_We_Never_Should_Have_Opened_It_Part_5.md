And so came the day that I was dreading. The day that Naeem had ultimately sacrificed his life to delay.

Having been lowered by the crane and descended the ladder into the cage at the base of the embankment, once again I looked upon that place. The wall of hands was no longer there, the only remains being the odd bits of rubble scattered about and being hauled by labourers away from the site. Several men worked on a large hammer drill that was currently boring into the plain stone that had been hidden behind the original marble. My ears reverberated with the deafening sound of the hammer. Several holes were already present throughout the rock, looking as though a colossal shootout had just taken place.

Mia and I stood together amongst the expedition crew chosen by Suffian to enter once the rock was compromised. It consisted of Myself, Mia, Suffian, Hamza and six of his personnel, and Milad with five of his Archaeologist team. We all watched in anticipation.

The sound coming from the drill began to change and I knew that it had once again penetrated through the rock. Yet, the stone stood strong. I felt a temporary relief. Suffian cursed and ordered the drillers to start another hole. The drill had only just begun to hammer into it when there was a loud CRACK. The drillers immediately dropped the tools and bolted towards us. The stone they had been working on began to collapse in on itself. There was a rumble as earth shifted and stones fell, quickly enveloping the place with a choking dust.

Despite the coming horrors we were to endure, in that moment I was more afraid with the knowledge that I’d be entering a cave that had just been revealed by an avalanche. In hindsight, I should have realised it would have been a mercy if the cave collapsed on us, giving us all swift ends.

I buried Mia’s face against my chest in an effort to shield her from the dust, and closed my eyes. For several minutes I stood in my own darkness until I began to hear several awe filled gasps. Mia freed herself and I opened my eyes.

Behind the recently made pile of settled rubble, stood a dark gaping cave. All I could see of its interior was the utter darkness that had last been seen by Salome herself, albeit with a child crying as it ran back inside. What happened to that child, and whether it would be waiting for us within that dark, made my stomach churn.

Suffian stepped forward, clapping his hands vigorously. It was the first and last time I’d ever see him with a smile on his face. “Well done!” he praised the drillers, slapping them on the back. He turned to address the gathered expeditioners. “Two years it has taken us to get to this point. It’s time to see what treasure lies within!” He gestured for us all to follow him, and with hesitant steps, Mia and I walked towards the tomb.

With all the rubble strewn in front of it, the only way we could enter was on our hands and knees. Suffian entered first, followed by Hamza, Milad, then us.

I helped Mia as we scraped our knees along the rubble and came to Milad’s side when we had crossed the threshold. He stood there, trembling violently as he stared into the dark depths of the cave, mumbling prayers in his native tongue. I shared his fear, and in line with Salome’s account, was expecting to be lifted into the air and thrown against the rock by invisible forces at any moment.

“Well, what are you waiting for, Hamza, light it up!” Suffian demanded.

I could hear Hamza fumble at his belt. He flicked on a torch that shone with a light that was dimmer than I expected.

But it was bright enough.

He pointed it into the void before us, revealing the first row of four small child sized sarcophagi. Mia threw her hand to her mouth and gasped, but I was too shocked to make a sound. They were exactly as I had pictured them in Salome’s account, with one slight difference. On the left most sarcophagus, I noticed a brief inscription written in Hebrew, something that Salome might have easily overlooked. I nudged Mia to see if she could translate it for me, but her attention was fixed on the wall next it. I squinted my eyes in an effort to see what had fixated her so.

 Now, I gasped. Etched into the wall above that inscribed sarcophagus, was a face.

An infant’s face, scrunched into a wail.

 It was so startling that I impulsively took a step back. The reason I had not noticed it right away was because it was formed out of varying features upon the rock wall itself. The blend of the varying colours of the rock, gave the face a rotting look. It was there, but it wasn’t there. A combination of fluke and intention.

I wrapped an arm around Mia’s trembling shoulder. “He looks like he’s in so much pain,” she said.

I pointed to the inscription on the sarcophagus. “What does it say?”

With great effort, Mia tore her gaze away from the face and read the inscription. She stifled a sob. “*We, the murdered.”*

I let out a long shaky breath and closed my eyes, hoping that when I opened them, I would be in a beach resort.

The light went out and then back on again. Once again it went out and I could hear Hamza cursing as he tapped the torch against his knee a few times. He turned it back on, yet the light remained as dim as the light from a candle.

“You stupid idiot!” Suffian snapped as he cuffed Hamza over the head. “You knew we were coming into a fucking cave and didn’t bring a good torch?”

Hamza stuttered. “But I charged it and tested it before we came down here. It should light this entire place up like it was day!”

Suffian turned to the rest of the crew who had all now entered. “Turn on your lights, dammit! What do you think this is, a walk in the park?”

But most of the newcomers were already adorned with head torches and hand-held ones, all having been turned on before they had even entered the tomb. But, like Hamza’s military grade device, theirs too shone with a dim light that was only strong enough to penetrate a few feet before them. Suffian was beside himself in anger, lashing out at them all for being so careless.

I knew his anger was unjustified. Something was evidently causing the dimness in the torches.

“Half of you with torches walk at the lead, the rest walk at the rear, keeping the light on us who don’t have,” Suffian ordered. The crew shuffled into their positions, and before long we began to delve deeper into the tomb.

With each row of four tiny sarcophagi we passed, Mia tightened her grip on my hand. She barely looked ahead, too fixated was her gaze upon the walls on either side.

It turned out that there were two faces on each row, one on each side, each showcasing a unique individual, varying in age from infant to young toddler. Unless you looked closely, the features would have remained hidden by the rock, which I’m sure had been the experience for the rest of the crew, for none, not even Suffian, pointed them out. Even Mia had been evaded of seeing the full scale of these faces. When we passed the fifth row, I noticed additional faces on both the roof and floor of each row. The same inscription - *we the murdered -* occurred on every left most sarcophagus. I understood the theme at once. They were the very faces of the murdered children occupying those sarcophagi. I kept this observation to myself, saving Mia from an unnecessary addition to her unease.

My small mercy would be only short lived.

We reached the 12th row, and it was here where the uneasiness began to evaporate under the intense heat of growing terror.

Salome had mentioned two variations of the remains within the catacombs that lined the walls along the furthest half of the tomb; One where the severed limbs were stacked tightly to fill in the space, the other where the severed heads were arranged in a chain, connected by a rotting severed arm that had been placed in the mouth of each head.

What we were looking at now, was far more disturbing than I could have ever imagined. Each catacomb slot was lined with the mummified heads of men who looked as though they had died maybe a year ago, not two millennia! Their faces were grey and shrivelled, yet, their blank eyes had somehow survived the test of time, looking like dried out pickled white onions. They seemed to stare at us with an expression of exasperation.

Above them, another inscription was scratched into the rock all over the place, and looking more like graffiti then anything formal.

I asked Mia for her translation.

She replied, “*We stole their lives, they steal our rest.”*

I shuddered.

The torch wielding crew at the head of our procession suddenly halted, all of them gasping and some even taking a step backward. Two of Milad’s Archaeologists turned and emptied their guts next to the small sarcophagi at their feet. Hamza pointed his torch towards what had prompted their gorge.

It shone upon the most horrifying thing I had ever seen.

Within the spaces between the four sarcophagi of the 13th row, four sentries stood, made entirely out of conjoined limbs. Three pairs of legs were somehow connected to, and holding up the shrivelled torso of what had once been a man. Instead of retaining its original arms, a forearm which was either its own or that from another body, had been shoved deep into both sockets below the shoulder. Where the head should have been, two full length arms protruded out from the neck. The elbows were bent to their extremity in the relaxed state of the dead, allowing the hands to dangle in roughly the same area where the mouth of the man who had once been that torso would have resided. To top it all off, the four sets of hands that protruded out of these four monstrosities, were wide open, a pose that no corpse should ever be able to make.

If this was not a clear warning for us to go no further, I didn’t know what else was.

Mia clung to me, and I held her, more so to comfort myself than anything else.

Several of the crew began to mutter prayers, Milad’s the loudest of them all, while others turned around and hurried out of that place, willing to take a chance at Suffian’s wrath than to go deeper into that pit of nightmares. Mia and I were about to join them, but when we turned around, Suffian was standing in our path. He was holding a torch that had belonged to a mutineer in one hand, in the other he held a gun.

“Don’t even think about it,” he snarled. He pushed the barrel against my forehead and forced me backwards. “We are getting to the end of this tomb where the treasure lies. This is but a deterrent of the ancients.”

I would have argued that such a deterrent was impossible to exist, but it would have achieved nought. Suffian’s delusion was incurable. I did the most logical thing when one has a gun to their head, and obeyed. Satisfied, Suffian pulled the gun away from me, and began to shoot blankly towards the entrance in which the mutineers were fleeing to.

“Cowards!” he shouted. “You will regret turning your back on our nation’s glory!”

The echoes of the gunshots sounded as though the bullets were ricocheting all over the place. When it finally died down, I was relieved that no cries of pain were accompanying it. I noticed the shocked expression on Hamza’s face, and hoped that he was finally realising how much of a madman he was working for. A madman that I could almost compare to the Herod that had been depicted in Salome’s account.

Out of the sixteen that had entered the tomb, only nine of us remained. All of the Archaeology team, Milad included, plus one of Hamza’s security personnel had fled.

We all stared at the eldritch sentries that stood in our path.

“Hamza, move one of them out of the way so we can get through,” Suffian demanded.

Hamza’s face was as white as a blank Word document, and for a long moment he merely stood there, staring at the thing in front of us. I was almost convinced that he was not going to fulfil the order and chance the trigger happy Suffian who was standing right behind him. But sense got the better of him and he stepped forward.

I felt Mia’s body tense up, and so did mine as we watched Hamza cautiously approach the abomination. He held his torch before him and when he was close enough, he jabbed the light end against the bare chest of the torso. The first jab was hesitant, but the second came with the force of a trained professional. Instead of the unnatural abomination coming to life and strangling him with its strange outstretched hands, it toppled over as any dead weight would when shifted off balance. It lay in a heap atop a sarcophagus.

“Good man,” Suffian called. “Lead the way please.”

And so, we past by the two sentries that remained standing on either side of us, and hesitantly continued into the depths of the cave.

During those few evenings after our lovemaking where we had learned so much about each other, Mia had boasted often on how much of an Agnostic she was, despite her Assyrian Christian upbringing. Much like my own thoughts, she could not decide which of the many religions that existed in the world was in fact the right one worthy of her full attention.

 It seemed that old habits truly did die hard in regards to Mia’s faith. As we walked past the final few rows of sarcophagi, she muttered prayer after prayer to the God of her childhood. I guess in my heart I was probably feeling the same urge.

I began to notice the air seemingly grow thicker about me. The hair on my body began to rise up, the same way it does when encountering static electricity. And then a humming sound gradually began to fill my ears. The best way I can describe it is similar to the sound a running fridge makes. But unlike a fridge where the sound is caused by a running motor, there was no logical explanation for the cause of that hum within the tomb. By the time we reached the solitary adult sized sarcophagus on the nineteenth row, the humming had become unbearable.

Everyone was wincing and putting their hands against their ears, which I quickly learned did nothing to stifle the sound. Mia’s eyes were squeezed shut and her face was twisted in agony as she dealt with it. I felt completely hopeless that there was little I could do for her. My only hope was that Suffian would give in to the noise and bail out of the tomb.

But that would not be the case.

Suffian’s face was pinched as he coped with the sound, making his natural scowl even more prominent. He crouched beside the large sarcophagus and ran a hand over the dull lid. He traced a finger along an inscription scratched upon the lid that matched the same informal graffiti look of all the others we had seen.

“What does it say?” Suffian called out to Mia, his voice raised to be heard over the humming.

With a great effort, Mia forced her eyes open and briefly read the inscription, before closing them again and breathing in hard through her teeth. “It says, *Eternal life be our gift to the king, where his madness will never know rest.”*

Despite the pain in my ears, I felt an icicle drive itself through my chest. I soaked in every particle of whatever material that sarcophagus had been made of, and could not for the life of me imagine someone living in there for the last two thousand years. It was impossible.

I thought of the outstretched hands on those four abominations and knew that the impossible had already well been achieved within this foul place.

The inscription didn’t seem to have the same effect on Suffian. He placed an ear against the top of the lid and embraced it like some long lost relative. “The final resting place of Herod the Great,” he muttered, lost in his own revelry. “This is truly a magnificent day.”

I did not share his enthusiasm. None of us did. By that point, I’m pretty sure he was the only one who actually believed he’d find something long dead in there.

Suffian attempted to pry the lid off with his bare hands, an effort with no reward. He motioned for Hamza and the rest of the security team to assist him. I watched as the seven men strained themselves to move the ancient stone.

“It’s no use, sir,” Hamza said, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow. “We need some sort of mechanical advantage-

“We are opening it now!!” Suffian roared, and once again they all heaved on the lid.

My heart jumped to my throat when I heard the hollow scraping sound of the lid moving a tiny fraction.

“Thats it!” Suffian called out, excitement far outweighing exhaustion. “Come on, open it up!”

The men continued to heave, and with each joined jolt, the lid slid a few millimetres. Now that it had been moved from the place it had been settled in for two thousand years, it seemed to get easier with every push. Suffian finally called the halt when the lid was opened enough. His eyes were wide with awe and wonder as he gazed at what lay within the sarcophagus. We all leaned in and peered over Suffian’s shoulder to see for ourselves.

Being a plain square shaped sarcophagus, there had been no indication of which side the occupants face would be. Instead of revealing the mummified face of an ancient King, we looked upon a pair of grey feet. Notice how I didn’t say *mummified feet?* That’s because, other than the skin being the colour of death, the feet looked as plump as any living foot I’ve seen.

Suffian knelt at the end of the sarcophagus and slowly put both his hands into the opening. He caressed the grey feet with an uncharacteristic tenderness as tears began to swell in his eyes. “The royal feet of a famous King.” He raised his head to the ceiling and shouted at the top of his lungs, “Praise be to Allah! He who guided me to this great find!”

As the echoes of his voice began to fade, a new noise began to fill the void. At first, I thought it was the humming sound intensifying. It rose and rose, until I was certain what it was.

 Hysterical screaming.

A sudden movement from within the sarcophagus caught my eye. Suffian instantly recoiled his hand as though a snake had just struck him. The joy on his face was swiftly replaced by pure horror.

The feet he had just been holding were now kicking frantically within the tiny space of the sarcophagus. The screaming was coming from within.

I grabbed Mia and took four good steps back, picking up one of the torches left by the men who had gone to open the lid and pointed it at the source of all the unnatural commotion. Suffian sat on the cold floor, frozen in place as he stared dumbstruck at the kicking feet. The headstrong and ever demanding composure of the politician had broken.

I considered this a perfect opportunity to flee, but despite Salome’s account proving more and more valid, morbid curiosity compelled me to stay and watch the events unfold. I should have thought of my lover, suffering through the agony of the humming, and growing pallid as she witnessed the unnatural turn of events play out.

**I’ll admit now that I’m glad I stayed and forced Mia to endure those horrors for longer. For if we had not, a vital piece of knowledge may never have been attained. It is that very knowledge that compels me to write this entire account; an account of which is specifically designed to be of aid to any who would classify themselves as part of the living. Such as yourself, dear reader.**

The kicking and screaming from what should have been a corpse, intensified, to the point that the kicks were made with such force that the lid upon the sarcophagus began to rattle and shake. The occupant within was able to do what had taken seven men to achieve. Slowly, the lid began to shift to one side, and a small strip began to open along the entire right-hand side of the sarcophagus.

 As soon as the gap was wide enough, eight blackened fingers with jagged fingernails poked through. The ancient tendons strained as they worked to push the lid further aside.

Of all the men present, only Hamza had enough clarity to withdraw his pistol and point it with a trembling hand towards the sarcophagus. The rest were as still as the four abominations had been, staring with mouths agape.

With a final effort, the hysterical corpse shoved the lid aside where it cracked in two on the floor. The screaming and kicking subsided and, to my relief, the sudden absence of the humming accompanied it.

Mia’s fingernails penetrated through my sleeves as we grasped each other in tense anticipation. 

There was a shuffling movement within the sarcophagus. Then, the occupant began to rise.

 It paused in a seated position. I was only granted the view of its side profile, but could see that its naked chest was rising and falling rapidly. Its face was more like the colour of its hands - a charcoal - and its white hair and beard hung about the place in a mess.

It turned its head to us.

What I saw, was neither dead, nor alive. The face was gaunt and had the definitive look of a typical Egyptian mummy, minus all the hair. But its eyes. They were the eyes of a living man! They darted about the place, wide with unknowable terror, and for a brief moment locked with my own. I did not see a monster, but a fellow human being, one who had endured the greatest of torments. My heart lurched for this man who *was,* according to Salome’s account, King Herod.

Suffian had begun to shuffle away from the sarcophagus, when Herod noticed the movement. Still in his panic-stricken state, Herod began to splutter out something in a language neither of us could understand. But by the tone alone, I knew he was pleading for help. Herod then crawled out of the sarcophagus, his naked half corpse-half living body collapsing on the floor beside it. I guess because Suffian was the closest, he began to crawl to him, continuing in his hysterical babbling. The speed in which Herod moved should not have been achievable by one who had been locked in a sarcophagus for two millennia.

It was Suffian’s turn to scream as Herod bore down on him. The Ancient king grabbed the politician by the shoulders and began to shake him like a doll, crying out hysterically into his face. Suffian tried to pry Herod off, but the intensity in the ancient King’s desperation made him as unmovable as a monolith.

**BANG! BANG! BANG!**

Three gunshots blasted, startling Mia and I with the sudden offence to our already strained ears. I turned to see Hamza, standing firm and pointing his gun at Herod and Suffian. There was a thin trickle of smoke wafting from the barrel.

Returning my gaze to the commotion near the sarcophagus, I saw three bleeding holes in Herod’s birdlike back. He continued to shake Suffian, but the intensity in his demeanour slowed substantially, until it stopped altogether. Suffian took advantage of the sudden lapse, tearing himself free and scrambled to his feet.

 The ancient King turned in the direction from whence the bullets came and looked upon Hamza with a puzzled expression. For the last time, I looked into Herod’s living eyes and no longer saw despair or agony in them. Rather, relief.

**BANG!**

A hole suddenly appeared between those ancient eyes. For a few seconds, Herod stared at what must have seemed to him a rather peculiar weapon. He then fell back.

And so passed Herod the Great. The academic world will forever refer to Josephus’ account of his death, that being as a result of gangrene and other intense illnesses he had suffered from throughout his old age. Few would ever know, nor believe, that it had come via a bullet to his head, two thousand years after that which history records. A swift and merciful end to two millennia worth of torment.

Before I had even processed what just happened, an explosive sound filled the tomb.
