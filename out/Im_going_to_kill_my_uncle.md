I don’t know why but last night, an angel talked to me.

It told me only two things.

The first was to kill my uncle. Not just normally, but in the most violent way I could imagine.

The second, that the world in all its glory was only meant for this moment, was only meant for me to kill my uncle.

Over the past few hours, I’ve debated if I’m going to follow through with it or not. I finally decided I was.

For who am I to disobey the word of god? My whole life I have been told to obey god, to not question, and to follow his plan. If this is his plan, then I must follow it.

I found an old cattle branding iron out in the shed, and I’ve decided to use that. Strangely enough, it’s in the shape of the initials “J” and “C”. I assume it’s for “Jesus Christ" as if it has been given to me from the heavens.

My uncle comes home from work late, after the rest of my family is asleep. I believe that will be the perfect time to kill him.

I’ll make a fire outside and put the branding iron in it while I wait for him. While the fire is burning, I’ll dig his grave. I’ll have to guess what size to make it, but if he doesn’t fit, I found a hand saw to cut him into smaller pieces.

Once I see his truck lights pull into the driveway, I’ll grab the iron and run into the house.

I’m not sure what will happen next if he’ll scream, or if he’ll know this was all a part of God's plan. Either way, I’ll stab the sizzling iron into his chest, continuing to push and push, until his tender flesh is blistered open and bleeding. Then when he is on the floor crying in pain, I’ll burn his mouth shut. Welding his lips together, so he can’t scream or make a fuss. I’ll continue to cover his body in the marks of the lord until he is no longer moving.

I’ll drag him out to his grave, where I’ll wrap his body in bible verses and then bury him.

I’ll say a prayer to calm his spirits and help guide him to the afterlife. He'll be welcomed to heaven with open arms. He'll be praised for being a sacrifice for the lord. Jesus will honor him for what he has done. He will be given a spot next to Peter, John, and Paul, a new apostle and prophet.

Once he's buried I'll run back inside, to clean up the blood and erase the smell of burning flesh. I believe that no one will find the body and that even if they did, they would understand. It was the word of god. I had to do it, and I had no other choice.

I'm going to kill him tomorrow night. If everything goes well, I'll follow up with a post.
