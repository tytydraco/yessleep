The nurse tells me I can see him, but that I’m not meant to get him too worked up about anything. He is recovering from a heart attack, after all.

It’s past midnight and the only thing I’ve consumed the whole day is six coffees. Memories of my morning drift between reality and fever dream. I look far from composed.

The nurse hesitates for a moment, but eventually she takes me across the hall. There’s another bed in his room, but it’s empty. The moment I see the old scientist, my hunger for answers tempers.

Back when he was my boss, Doctor Moss had a sort of regal authority about him. No matter what problems the research institute faced, the man was always a shining beacon of calm. Even during the staff picnics, when Doctor Moss ditched his bow tie and replaced it with an apron at the grill, he exuded dignity and poise.

Up until this morning I had never seen the man panic.

Sick, pale and looking his age, Doctor Moss looks like a soldier on the losing side of a war. He smiles as he recognizes me. An echo of my old mentor lingers in his words as we exchange pleasantries. Yet, the subject of the morning is inevitable. Soon enough, the age returns to Doctor Moss’s face.

I ask about the crate that was delivered to the facility this morning. I ask about how Doctor Moss knew what was inside of it. I ask about the horrid monstrosity that crawled from the crate.

‘Did you destroy the specimen?’ he asks, after a long consideration.

‘Incinerated it,’ I say, ‘Just like you asked.’

He lets out a long sigh. At first, I fear that I’ll have to ask my questions again, but eventually Doctor Moss starts to speak.

‘Nursultan Kamer, I met him at a sustainable agriculture symposium in Prague sometime in the late 90s. He was from one of those ex-Soviet countries like Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan but his English was remarkable. I had never been to his neck of the woods and the man was full of stories. Though we had to part ways, we exchanged addresses. I considered the man my friend.’

The old scientist’s eyes drift to the window. He sighs and searches for something in the glow of the streetlamps. He does not find it.

‘The man liked to talk, and he loved to write. The envelopes which I received looked ready to burst and came with such frequency that the postman started to ask questions. I did not mind. Kamer was a fantastic story teller and, back then, I considered him a friend.’

‘At first, he wrote me of the Soviet stories he didn’t manage to share back during our short time in Prague. After about a dozen letters, Kamer’s stories turned to those of travel. Parts of his family had emigrated to the United States long before the fall of the Soviets and he had decided to go visit them now that the iron curtain had rusted away. Being in the West, Kamer attended every symposium and conference that would have him. It’s during one of these meetings of scientific minds that Kamer met Professor Henry Willow.’

Another long sigh escapes the old man’s lips. He shakes his head as if he was trying to get rid of discomforting thoughts. ‘Professor Henry Willow.’ He enunciates each syllable of the name as if it were dripping with poison. ‘Kamer wrote about the man as if he was the messiah. He wrote of limitless fields of wheat, of the eradication of hunger or disease. Kamer wrote of science that could manipulate the raw nature of genetics. I must admit, Kamer’s long letters left me a rapturous audience. I suggested, and eventually insisted, that Kamer and Professor Willow come visit. Soon enough they did.’

The door to the hospital room opens and the nurse walks in. She enters with no discernable purpose. After milling around for a moment, she asks Doctor Moss if everything is okay. He says yes and waves her off. The nurse spares me a suspicious look, but eventually she leaves. The old scientist doesn’t speak until her footsteps die off in the hallway.

‘Kamer, Willow and me had dinner together. Italian place, closed down ages ago. When I first met Willow, he didn’t inspire much confidence. He was in his 40s, lanky and balding and barely uttered a word. Throughout the whole dinner he kept on taking notes in his little notebook. Now, note-taking is par for the course for scientific minds — you’ve seen my journals. Willow’s constant writing didn’t put me off too much. What I found curious, and I guess a bit disconcerting, was the nature of his notebook.’

‘It was covered in those Pokemans that the kids were so enamored with back in the day. Here you had a, presumably, genius scientist who was taking notes on stationary fit for a schoolchild. I know that truly gifted minds usually come in queer packages, but Willow’s notebook did instill some doubts about his scientific prowess in me. My doubts about Willow, however, did not last.’

‘Kamer spent most of the dinner telling stories and scarcely let me, or Willow for that matter, get a word in. As we finished off our meal though, he seemed to register my doubts about his scientific companion. With the air of a circus presenter, Kamer asked Professor Willow if he would be willing to provide a demonstration of his research.’

‘The lanky American put away his Pokeman notebook and looked around the restaurant for something. Finally, he settled on the pot of basil we had on our table. Wordlessly, he reached into his jacket and pulled out a little plastic bag of what looked like fine yellow sand. He took a small pinch of the material, barely enough to fit between his thumb and pointer, and dropped it into the potted plant.’

With another long sigh, Doctor Moss’s eyes close. ‘I’ve worked with plants my whole life,’ he says, resting his head. ‘Of course, I knew that there was plenty of things which I did not know. I had no illusions about being omnipotent about any realm of science. What I saw in that restaurant, however… I was certain it was a parlor trick. I was sure that Professor Willow was simply some charlatan who had tricked my friend into believing he was capable of great things. I refused to believe what I saw, yet, I could come up with no other feasible explanation.’

‘Mere seconds after Willow deposited that strange sand into the pot, it started to sprout. Right before my eyes, leaves of grass grew from the soil at an alarming rate. It took moments for the basil to be choked out by the grass.’

‘Before the grass could get long enough to catch the attention of the waiters or other patrons, Kamer produced a pocket knife from his coat and cut the grass down to size. “See? I told you our friend Professor Willow was capable of great things,” he said, depositing the loose grass in his pocket. “Are you not happy I made this introduction?”’

‘I was completely wordless. I had never seen anything grow so fast. Although much of the grass was now squashed up Kamer’s coat pocket, the remnants still continued to grow. Before I had a chance to formulate a coherent thought, Willow shut his Pokeman notebook.’

‘He said the basil pot was nothing compared to the true potential of his discoveries. With a fervor inappropriate for public dining, Willow ranted about the nature of genetics and plants and life. He rasped about how, if one knew where to look, the biology of any organism could be tamed and adapted. He didn’t ask. He demanded I take him up to the research facility. Professor Willow demanded I let him demonstrate how far his research had come.’

‘When I didn’t answer the man immediately, Professor Willow scoffed and went back to scribbling notes in his schoolboy notebook.’

‘Kamer, in a much more friendly way, suggested that maybe a drive up to the facility would be a nice way to finish off the evening. Without giving me time to answer, he started telling a story about a lab he worked in back in the USSR. Halfway through the story, Kamer stopped and started to wonder whether there might not be an empty garden plot at the facility.’

‘I said there was. I said I would be happy to see more of Professor Willow’s work.’

‘We paid for dinner and got in the car. Kamer continued to tell his story, but I could scarcely pay attention. I needed to focus on the road. I needed to focus on the road and steel myself for what was to come.’

His eyes open again. At first Doctor Moss stares at the ceiling, but eventually his eyes drift to my face. ‘Can you imagine where the grill is?’ That echo of my old mentor rises in his voice. ‘The little cement island in the courtyard.’

I nod. Just last month he was manning the grill at his retirement party. Just this morning we used the lighter fluid to set an abomination of science on fire.

‘We used to have a garden plot there back in the day. I had tried planting something exotic there that hadn’t taken root. The plot was free. Thomson worked security back then. He didn’t put up any argument to us going in after hours and he kept to himself.’

His eyes close again. With a deep breath, the machines he’s hooked up to change the rhythm of their beeping. Before I get up for the nurse, however, the sluggish tones return.

‘He only used a palmful. A single palmful and the grass sprung up so high that with a bit of wind it leaned on the roof. The sheer amount of plant matter, let alone the speed at which it grew, it left me completely stunned.’

‘As I looked at the grass sway above, nearly covering the moon, Kamer gave me a cigar. He spoke of how Willow’s research could be adjusted for different crops. He painted pictures of a world free of hunger, free or wars over resources. Kamer spoke of a science that could usher in a utopia.’

‘Willow did not smoke with us. He watched the grass with a furrowed brow and, occasionally, when a thought seized him, he scribbled it into his colorful notebook. It took me a long while before I was able to speak, but when I could, I asked how Willow had made such discoveries.’

‘Professor Willow, in something resembling a calm demeanor, explained to me that the instruction came to him in a dream. He said that these dreams revealed to him exactly what he was meant to do and that other people had been given instructions as well.’

‘His tone was much calmer than it was back in the restaurant, but that did not last for long. Willow’s speech soon turned into utter nonsense and he was screaming about the final century and heavenly mandates all while slapping the flimsy notebook to punctuate his points. His words were madness to me then. They’re madness to me now but…’

The machines quicken their beep again. Doctor Moss’s eyes open up again and he quietly, almost in a whisper, asks me for a glass of water.

Mercifully, there’s a sink in the room and I don’t have to go get a nurse. As I pour, however, there’s an uncontrollable tremor in my hand.

‘I’m sorry,’ he says, after I help him take a sip of water. ‘I didn’t mean to get you involved in all this. If you wouldn’t have called this morning… For two decades I didn’t hear from Kamer. I thought he had given up or retired or, perhaps, died. If I thought there was even a remote chance of…’

His voice trails off. I tell him it’s okay. I tell him he can finish telling me the story tomorrow.

‘No,’ he says. ‘You deserve to know. You deserve to know and I can’t carry this to the grave.’

His eyes shut, but he doesn’t speak. For a moment I consider getting off my chair and returning tomorrow. Doctor Moss, however, stops that thought short.

‘It was madness,’ he says, taking a deep breath. ‘All of Willow’s rambles were madness, but what followed was so much worse.’

‘A sound came out of the grass. It stopped Willow’s unhinged rant in its track. Suddenly, all he was interested in was the grass. Even Kamer leaned forward with unconcealed fascination.’

‘It was a sort of ‘*Mua*’ sound, something that could only be pronounced with human lips. It came from the grass. Something was babbling in the grass.’

The sound sent a chill down my spine. The creature that crawled out of the crate this morning. The same creature that me and Doctor Moss beat to death and set on fire. It made those exact sounds.

‘It didn’t look like the one we saw this morning,’ the old scientist says. ‘It was shaped like a person. Its lips were still huge and fat and its skin was covered in insect eyes and strange flowers, but it had arms and legs.’

‘The thing crawled out of the grass, babbled at me with its enflamed lips and then died.’

‘Willow noted another flurry of thoughts in his notebook. Kamer, on the other hand, was full of promise. He celebrated how the grass had managed to create a living, breathing creature. Sure, it died right on the spot, but there was research yet to be done. With a little funding, Willow’s technology could be adjusted for organisms that could survive past a couple breaths, for livestock, for more solutions to world hunger.’

‘Before Kamer could start to speak about the intricacies of funding and how my connections might help, I told the man to stop talking. I was filled with shock and awe and confusion, yet as I looked at that gray lifeless thing lying by my feet I was overwhelmed with disgust.’

‘Willow had created a living thing out of thin air just to watch it die. The breed of science he was interested in was nothing man should ever touch. I ordered both Kamer and Willow out of the facility. Thomson would call them a cab. I had no interest in letting the two men back into my car.’

‘I spent most of the night burning any evidence of Willow’s demented science and when the soil in the courtyard kept on sprouting grass I had it replaced with cement. All I kept from that night was a sample of one of the flowers and that was purely because I wanted to assure myself the whole night was not mere phantasm.’

‘Kamer never wrote to me again. A couple years after that night, however, I received a slim envelope with a letter written on Pokemen stationary. It was from Henry Willow. The message he had for me was curt, yet the entire letter was bunched up into a corner of the page as to not cover any of the creatures in the background.’

‘Willow and Kamer had found a safe refuge out East at the United People’s Institute of Science. The institute would help facilitate Willow’s research and its true potential could be reached. Willow would prove me wrong and engineer living creatures into existence. He would create life and prove me wrong. He would prove me wrong and when the *final century* came him and his beasts would rule the earth.’

‘Out of curiosity, I looked up this United People’s Institute of Science. It was an old Soviet research facility and there was sparse information about it. The only thing I could find out was that it got shut down in ’92.’

‘Maria, I still had so many questions but I so desperately wanted to forget. With the little I knew about the institute; I decided it was closed and that Willow was a madman destined to fail. I decided to let the whole affair out of my head and now…’

His words drift again. The machines he is hooked up to start to quicken their pace once more. I tell him it’s okay. I tell him we’re safe.

He shakes his head again.

‘And now we just have to hope we never see Professor Willow’s vision of the final century [fruition](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/comments/q2qjz1/%D2%93%D1%8B%D0%BB%D1%8B%D0%BC%D0%B8_%D2%9B%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%8B%D1%80%D2%93%D1%8B/.%E2%80%99).
