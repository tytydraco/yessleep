Whenever my upstairs neighbors are at their drunkest and making it impossible for me to focus on reading, I find myself spending the evening just staring out the window at the gas station across the street. I watch the cars come and go, bathed in the light of billboards and advertisements. Sometimes, I'd come up with little scenarios in my head about where they might be headed. I like to imagine that a few of them are drifters, just passing through—like my town is nothing but a quick pit stop for them and they'd be back on the open road before long. No responsibilities, no expectations, no concrete cages to suffocate you and keep participating in a system that you despise. Just you, the radio, and a sunset in your rearview. Freedom.

It began like any other shitty Monday. I woke up around 7 AM, sleepwalked through my usual morning routine, checked my social media and got ready for work. As I stepped out the door, however, something was immediately off. The hallway of my apartment complex looked different. The paint was peeling off the walls, and the floor was a mess—more than I was used to, anyway. It wasn’t just the occasional cigarette butt; it seriously looked like it hadn’t been swept in years, covered in a thick, powdery layer of dust. I was leaving literal bootprints behind as I made my way to the elevator. I opened the sliding door, only to discover a yawning pit, descending into darkness. It looked like the metal cables, or whatever the technical term for those is, had snapped, sending the elevator car plummeting down into the basement. Needless to say, it wasn’t like this the day before.

I turned to the stairs. They weren’t looking any better. Aside from the mess, the railing was barely hanging on by a thread, or a few rusty screws, in this case. Any weight on it would’ve probably sent it crashing all the way down to the lobby. The lights were out too—the only light came from the broken windows lining the outer wall. I remember putting my fist to my chest as pressure started to mount. More than anything, though, I was just confused. This place had the exact same layout as my complex, but at the same time, it looked like nobody had lived here for decades. I carefully made my way down to the ground floor, each step punctuated by the crunch of shattered glass. There were heaps of junk and construction debris all over the place. Had I slept through a terrorist attack or something? The building’s front door was hanging ajar, its lock broken, as if it had been kicked open from the inside. What awaited me beyond it was even more disconcerting.

Wherever I was, it definitely wasn’t home. I could say it looked abandoned, but that hardly captures how lifeless everything felt. It was like walking through a cemetery, with those familiar gray Soviet-style blocks towering over me like giant gravestones. They seemed a little too familiar, in fact, as I soon realized I was standing in the middle of an entire neighborhood made up of the exact same residential building—my building—copied and pasted over and over, separated by identical narrow streets. It was a maze of mind-numbing uniformity. Just trying to take it all in was causing my head to spin. The only semblance of normalcy was the morning sun breaking through the concrete canopy. But in this context, even it seemed off somehow—like I was an experiment and someone was shining a giant lightbulb down on me. A mix of emotions swirled inside me. There was the obvious fear, laced with a dash of morbid curiosity. Reaching the end of one street merely led to another, which itself branched off into two more. Everything looked so similar, and I didn’t want to wander too far, not sure if I’d be able to make my way back. I pulled my phone out of my pocket, only to find I had no signal, which I kind of expected. With nothing else to do, I decided to call out for help:

“Anyone out there!?” My voice reverberated off the brutalist structures, echoing through the empty city block.   
  
The silence, while it lasted, felt heavy, suffocating. I gave it another try:  
  
“Hello!? Anyone!?”  
  
After a few seconds, I finally got a response, but it wasn’t what I was hoping for. It came in the form of a sudden, loud and painful-sounding shriek. I just froze, one foot on the asphalt and the other on the uneven sidewalk. I slowly turned my head toward the source of the sound as it came again, this time even closer. Then, the figure of a naked young woman emerged from around a corner. I felt my throat contract as I got a good look at her.   
  
She was caked in filth from head to toe. There were random patches of her hair missing, as if forcibly pulled out, leaving only sparse strands clinging to her face. She was hunched over like some kind of ghoul, her crazed eyes darting around until they finally locked onto me. At that point, she let out another ear-piercing scream and charged straight for me, arms outstretched, grasping at the empty air between us. Adrenaline shot through my system. I turned on my heels and ran. The soles of my boots clacked against the pavement, closely tailed by the rapid patter of bare feet. I rushed back inside my building and yanked the heavy metal door shut, only to remember its broken lock. Luckily, my deranged pursuer didn’t seem to have the sense to pull on the handle; instead, she just crashed against the door and started banging away while I held it closed with all my strength. Eventually, the banging stopped and I heard muffled weeping, which grew progressively more distant until it faded away entirely. 

I anxiously loosened my grip and then, when no response came, hurried back upstairs. The barren hallways welcomed me back with indifference. I waded my way through the trash, knocking on each of my neighbors' doors as I passed. No one answered. I shouted in frustration, pleading for someone to help me or at least tell me what the fuck was happening. The panic in my chest was rising. I barged back into my apartment, only to be greeted by a sight that once more left me questioning my grasp on reality. Everything looked…normal. My dirty coffee mug was still in the sink, exactly as I had left it. Yesterday’s clothes were piled up in front of the washing machine, and the fridge was buzzing away in the background. I could even hear one of my neighbor’s dogs barking. Slowly, as if any sudden move could cause the illusion to shatter, I walked over to the nearest window, which showed the usual view of my street. People were going about their commutes, blissfully unaware of what I had just gone through. I looked down at my phone and, sure enough, I had both a signal and WIFI again. Unfortunately, my relief was short-lived.   
  
When I actually went to open the window, I wasn’t met by the expected cacophony of passersby or the waft of exhaust fumes. Rather, I was confronted by that same surreal, concrete hellscape that awaited me outside. The unvarying architecture stretched on indefinitely, dominating my entire view. Now on the verge of a mental breakdown, I firmly closed the window, and all of the familiar sights returned. It was as though the glass functioned as a one-way mirror into my former reality, giving me a front-row seat to watch as the world moved on without me.  
  
Of course, one of the first things I did was reach out for help. Once I finally convinced my brother that I wasn’t playing a prank on him, he got the spare keys from my landlord and came over to check on me, only to find an empty apartment. And I mean completely empty, like the day I first moved in, as if all my stuff had just vanished along with me. He even sent me photos of the exact spot where I was standing. It’s so bizarre to be occupying the same space as someone and not be able to see them there. It seems like this apartment is my only tether to the real world, the one you and I both share as I type this on my laptop, but that tether snaps whenever I step outside its four walls. In gamer terms, it’s kind of like my own little personal checkpoint.

Eventually, my brother had no choice but to start believing me, and to his credit, has been instrumental in me maintaining what little sanity I have left. That said, neither of us really know who to turn to. Who do you call in case of transdimensional displacement? The police? The government? They’d probably just lock him up in a padded cell if he tried to explain what was going on; maybe even accuse him of having a role to play in my disappearance. 

At first, I wasn't just sitting around waiting for a solution, either. Whenever the sun went down, I’d head out there and see how far I could explore. I waited until it was dark to make sure that the only other resident of this place, that crazy woman from earlier, didn’t catch me wandering the streets. I knew she was still lurking around because I could hear her crying somewhere in a distant alley, howling into the night like a lost dog. I honestly preferred it over the deafening silence. 

For a while, my excursions didn’t yield much. No matter how far I walked or which direction I took, it was all the same—the same forest of identical gray high-rises, surrounded by an equally identical network of roads and side paths that all felt like they looped back on themselves.  
  
Supply-wise, somehow I still have running water, but the leftover pizza in my fridge lasted me only about a week. That’s when I started to notice that I didn’t feel any more or less hungry than when I wake up each day. It’s like my body is stuck in some weird limbo; I don’t really need to eat or drink to stay alive here, which explains how the woman outside is still going, despite looking like she’d been stranded in this monotonous hell way longer than I have.  I wasn’t as relieved as you might think from that realization. From where I’m standing, it just confirms that we’re meant to stay here until we lose our minds, wherever “here” is.

And then, yesterday happened. I finally decided to just pick a direction and start walking, not stopping no matter what. If I lost my way back, so be it. As it turns out, there is an end to this maze, only it wasn’t the one I was hoping for. After maybe a good four hours of walking, the buildings and streets abruptly receded, giving way to a perfectly flat field of yellow grass stretching all the way to the horizon. No trees, no hills, nothing—just an endless plain that led nowhere. A literal ocean of grass. There was one single landmark that stood out: an old bus stop, like an island amidst the motionless grass. Seated on its bench was the naked woman, her narrow shoulders sagging, looking passively at her feet. With nothing left to lose, I crossed the threshold that marked the end of the cityscape. The grass was surprisingly rigid and firm to the touch. It actually took some effort to push it aside as I made my way through. There was no wind, not even the slightest breeze—only silence, as always. I plopped down next to the woman and glanced over at the electronic sign that shows how long you’ve got to wait for the next bus. With faint, barely visible characters, it displayed “998948798” minutes. The ridiculous number almost made me burst out laughing.

“You know, the longer you ignore it, the worse it gets.” the woman said with a voice that made my stomach churn. I honestly preferred it when she would just scream at me incoherently. She was right, though.  
  
“You the first one?” I asked, blankly staring at the ground. 

The woman let out a dry chuckle, which pretty much answered my question. There was no denying it anymore. I had hoped it was just some weird coincidence or that I was going crazy. But under all the grime and filth, she didn’t just look exactly like me; she *was* me.

“The last one begged me to kill her. I couldn’t bring myself to do it, so she did it herself—jumped right out her window.”

“And why haven’t you yet?” I asked, not really caring how callous I sounded. After all, I was basically talking to myself.   
  
She shrugged, and I nodded like her answer made complete sense. I looked back at the sign; at that giant number eroding away, yet barely making a difference. I thought about asking her what we were waiting for, but I already knew the answer—or really, the lack thereof. Not that it matters. Neither of us is going to stay sane long enough to see what’s at the end of it. Maybe some future version of me will, or maybe it’s just a glitchy timer that’ll reset once it reaches zero. I wouldn’t put it past this place. 

Please, whoever you are reading this, if you have any idea where I am and how to get out of here, contact me immediately. I’ll give you my brother’s phone number, my location, whatever you need; just please. I don’t want to die here.
