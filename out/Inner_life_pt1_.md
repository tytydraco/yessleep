They say there is no such this as living a perfect life’’. They are not completely wrong but Daksh of New Orleans might just disagree on that one. Moved to the United States with goals and ambition. Sure it took a little over 7 years but he got where he wanted to. 

Living a life that most people call a dream, Daksh couldn't be happier with his life. Got married to Lauren in 2020 just before the covid -19 pandemic.Fortunate as he was his whole life Lauren was due just before the government announced nationwide lockdown. With perfect weight and health ‘’Bhumika’’ was born on 20th of Feb 2020.

Daksh, being an operations executive for a media company, had a good authority and reputation around his workplace. While the majority of the families struggled during the lockdown. The Smiths were expecting a second blessing in 2021. As they enjoyed the whole of 2020 they increased their expectations in 2021.

14th Jan 2021, Mansi was conceived , little weaker than Bhumika but nothing to worry about.
With a perfect family and a decent life Daksh was over the moon with how his life turned out to be.

As a Liverpool fan he never missed any of their games. On 23rd March just after the international break, Daksh was excited to see Liverpool back in action. It was Liverpool v Chelsea.Kick off was at 1 am EST on a Monday morning.

Liverpool were leading by a goal to nil, thanks to Salah from the spot. During the halftime around 1.51 am Daksh noticed something wrong with the lamp beside the dining table. He didn’t bother much as his eyes were heavy and thought it was nothing. After the game he went to sleep around 3 am, got up around 8 to get ready for work and left around 8 30.
It was all going according to routine for him.

Kissed Lauren and Mansi a goodbye just before dropping off Bhumika at school. After a normal day at work he started to wrap up and got ready to head back home. Checked his cellphone while going to the car, he saw the most unusual thing and was shocked. He saw 8 missed calls from Lauren and 2 texts ‘’HOW CAN YOU BE SO IRRESPONSIBLE’’ ‘’YOU IDIOT’’ . 

Daksh rushed home driving through every red light he could. Saw Lauren furiously looking at him and she just asked him ‘’How can you do this?’’ ‘’What’s going on with you today?’’ 
Daksh, confused and curious, asked what had happened. Lauren said ‘’You forgot to pick up Bhumika from school today.’’ 

Daksh, stunned and confused, apologised to Lauren and said this will never happen again. 
Daksh was drowning deep down in guilt but he was confused as to why he forgot to pick her up in the first place. Being big on discipline and punctuality this was never expected by him. 
Thinking about what happened today he sat on the sofa with a much needed glass of wine and noticed something strange with the lamp, again. He decided to ignore it again as there were more important things to focus on.
The next day, followed pretty much the same routine he follows everyday. Played with Bhumika and Mansi just to assure them nothing of this sort will happen again and how much he loves them. Lauren on the other hand gave the cold shoulder to him as she was upset.

Got into work a little late as Bhumika’s teacher wanted to have a word with him after yesterday’s incident. He made sure it will never happen again. A regular Tuesday at work, this time Lauren called for a reminder for picking up Bhumika.As he picked up the phone Lauren said ‘’You didn’t forget today did you?’’. Daksh asked about what she was talking about. Lauren said ‘’ Our daughter at school’’ . Daksh , with his eyes wide open , forgot about Bhumika once again and was stunned. He told Lauren ‘’ Of course not i am on my way to the school.’’ He picked up Bhumika and dropped her off at home. 

He returned to work exhausted like never before. Took a long shower just before dinner. Being a diehard Liverpool fan he never missed a game. Lauren , being a good wife, also supported Liverpool and watched some of the games with him. Lauren was upset with him so she had no intention to watch the champions league game vs Bayern Munich tonight so she headed straight to bed after putting the kids to sleep. 

Lauren was in her bed reading her book, she saw Daksh getting ready to sleep. She was confused because he never missed Liverpool games. She knew something was up. She decided to confront him about it. She asked ‘’Isn’t Liverpool playing tonight in the UCl?’’
Daksh saw the date and time and realised that he is forgetting stuff and experiencing certain things for the first time in his life. 

He told Lauren he needed to talk. Lauren suggested they go to the sofa and poured a glass of wine for both of them. Daksh told Lauren about everything about his experiences in the past couple of days. Suddenly he noticed the lamp again. 

This time it was completely different.  He was able to see other things properly but when he turned to the lamp, he could only see a pixelated golden box and it was growing out of its pixels. He screamed and asked Lauren if she could see the same thing. Lauren said everything seems fine to her. 

Now all Daksh could see a golden light and hear sirens from all around. His heart rate was going down, all he could think of was his family. After a moment he passed out. After an unknown period of time he woke up in an ambulance surrounded by cops and one another person whom he did not know but the person was claiming to be his friend. Daksh , in agony, asked what was going on. 

The cops said to Daksh that he was attending a football game at anfield and was hit by a ball and was out for almost 3 hours. The person who claimed to be his friend asked him ‘’Are you okay Manav?’’ Daksh , scared and confused, asked who Manav was and asked the cops for his mobile phone. 

Cops looked at him and said ‘’Sir you need to calm down, you have a concussion’’ Daksh laid down holding his head and asked the cops again for his phone. The cops answered ‘’ Sir we suggest you to calm down and breath for a moment’’ 
The cops asked Ashutosh, who apparently was Daksh’s friend, to help calm him down. Daksh , still shellshocked, asked who Ashutosh was and where he was. The cops told him they were in the city of Liverpool and were heading to the Merseyside hospital. Daksh started panicking and was getting out of control.The doctor present in the ambulance gave him a sedative and made him unconscious. 

Soon they reached the hospital. Ashutosh finished all the paperwork at the hospital and headed straight to the general ward where the doctor had kept Daksh as he thought it was nothing more than a concussion. After an hour Daksh started to gain consciousness and Ashutosh smiled and said ‘’Look who’s up ‘’. Daksh , confused , asked Ashutosh who he was. Ashutosh replied with a gentle giggle of relief ‘’Haha very funny Manav. It seems everything is fine with your head’’. 

Daksh asked why Ashutosh kept calling him Manav. Ashutosh called the doctor as he felt something was wrong with Manav. Daksh couldn’t talk properly as he was on a high dosage of sedatives and was feeling very drowsy. The doctor came and checked and concluded that there is nothing to worry about and it was just a concussion.
