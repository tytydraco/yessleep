I always loved taking pictures of abandoned places. It was vacation and I decided to go to as many abandoned places as I could. I already visited three and it was amazing. They were An abandoned church, hospital and a swimmingpool. So for the fourth day I went to an abandoned factory. I saw some pictures of it on the dark website. It's easier to find buildings there than having to search for the once that are already well known. I actually only work with the dark website for these places. I am always very careful, check if the websites aren't dangerous and I never talk to anyone online. 

When I went into the building the air was different. There was way more oxygen than outside and there was this weird smell. It reminded me of burning metal, ozone and gun powder. It was a factory that was partly burned down so I wasn't very surprised of the smell. Like always I sended my location to my friends and parents and started exploring the place.

After looking around for a bit I heard some noises. I didn't think much of it thinking that it would be some animals or just the wind. But it still made me feel uncomfortable. I can't describe what it was. I just blamed it on my paranoia and shook the feeling off. I started taking some pictures of the wilderness that found a way in the building and when I checked them the images were completely black. Except for one. At fiest sight it looked normal but when you looked closer there was this big shadow that fell over the place. I already got nervous but than I heard the sound again. This time it was way harder than before. It sounded like a dog barking but it was incredibly sharp and it sounded like it was slowed down. Suddenly it stopped as fast as it came. I definitely did not feel safe so I grabbed my things and made my way out of there. 

But when I went outside of the building, I saw that it was already night. Which couldn't even be possible because I arrived there in the morning and only stayed here for only an hour. This wasn't the only strange thing though. There were no sounds, no chirping no wind, nothing. It was also weird that there were no stars in the sky and no clouds. I couldn't see a thing so I took my flashlight out of my bag. I looked around but I was to scared to move until that awful noise came back. Every few seconds it became louder and louder. Until the point when blood was coming out of my ears. I finally was able to run. But no matter where I went it followed me behind. Until the noise suddenly just stopped. I looked around searching for a way out of the woods but there wasn't enough light to see anything clearly. I wanted to keep moving until I saw something. 

It was around two meters long, it's skin was gray and rotting away. The only hair it had were just a couple of black strands that came out of it's head. It also had two black dots as eyes and no mouth. But you still could see it smiling trough the wrinkles that formed on his face.

Surprisingly enough it did nothing. It just stayed there, looking at me. After what felt like hours, my flight response finally kicked in and I ran as hard as I possibly could. But before I knew it I was back at the factory. Before I could gather my thoughts my stomach dropped when I heard that sound again. That horrid creature stood right behind me. I turned around, looked up at it's face and the smell from inside the building hit me again. It split it's face open in two and made a horrible noise. Everything went black. 

I opened my eyes and saw that I was in a hospital. I couldn't move at all. Next to me were my parents. When they saw that I was awake they started crying. Apparently I was in a terrible car accident and was in a coma for almost a year

Later I heard that the building I said I visited, never existed.
