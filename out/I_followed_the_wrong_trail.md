I stared at the gate blocking our way. Jayden joined me, he kicked the shiny yellow DNR gate in disgust. “Well now what? I thought you said this was an open trail”. 

It had been. I thought too myself, I had lived in this town for twenty years before going to college. In all that time there had never been gate on Rams Ridge Trail. Why would there be? No one traveled it.  Sometimes kids would brag that they walked up the trail a little ways but that was just dumb high school stuff. 

The door to my old suburban creaked open, Jayden and I’s friend Madison climbed out of the old lifted square body. 

“What’s with the gate?” she asked. Jayden shot me an annoyed look, and deservingly so, this whole trip was my idea. We had drove seven hours to check out the trail. “We’re not sure yet” he told her. 

Boyd, Madison’s cousin and the final member of our team joined us. He was the oldest of the group by a year even if he rarely acted like it. “What’s stopping us from going around it?” Boyd asked. 

I looked at the deep ditches carved into either side of the road. My suburban might have been able to traverse the drop but there was no way Jayden’s Subaru Impreza would. 

“Isn’t that illegal? Like what if someone saw us?” Madison asked. I glanced at Jayden “we do have some tools, I mean I checked thoroughly. It’s public land and it’s open to dispersed camping”. Jayden raised an eyebrow at me “are suggesting we cut the lock? That’s mighty bold Carter”. 

He was right, the thought of it made my stomach turn. I tended to follow rules pretty strictly. But we had come all the way from our university in Oregon to my home town in Arizona just to explore this trail. Giving up now would mean wasting our spring break. 

And it would mean looking like an idiot in front of Madison. 

How I wished I had listened to my gut. 

But I had done my research, we were allowed to be here. This gate must have been put up by someone trying to keep people off public land. I didn’t see any markings or signs that it was an official DNR gate. “Yeah, grab the grinder. I’ll have it open in a minute”. Jayden grinned, with whoop he ran to the back of the suburban. 

Madison gave me a disapproving look but didn’t say anything when Jayden returned with the cordless cut off tool. True to my word I had the chain off in no time at all. 

Madison and I climbed back into the suburban while Boyd and Jayden got into the Subaru. Rather than take the second captain chair in the front with me Madison choose to lie down on the middle bench. Being just 5’ foot 3” Madison could fit comfortably on the bench. 

I had removed the rear most bench to make room for supplies, Jayden’s Subaru was reliable and a good backup vehicle but it just didn’t have a lot of extra room. When we planned the trip we didn’t know how long it would take, we still didn’t so we had loaded the suburban in preparation for any scenario we might run into. 

Rams Ridge Trail had been around for as long as anyone could remember, yet to my knowledge not a single person had ever traveled the length of it. It lay just a few miles outside the town I grew up in, the sandy path led deep into the Arizona wilderness. Despite being untraveled the road was surprisingly clear of brush and rocks.

Putting the suburban in gear I pulled forward onto the forbidden path. Madison spoke up from the back “so what’s up with this place?” I adjusted the rearview mirror to where I could see her. She was still laying on the bench but had rolled onto her side her head propped up by her arm. Those big brown eyes caused my heart rate to involuntarily increase.

“Uh it’s just something that’s always been there, legends say it’s haunted. I’m not sure how the rumors got started”. She made a mock scared face “oh no, not ghosts!” I chuckled. Madison tossed her phone onto the floor “there goes cell service”. 

“I’m surprised you had it this long” I replied. Madison climbed between the front seats and happily plopped into the passenger seat. Propping her feet on the dash she looked over at me. “Let me get this straight, your town has mysterious trail leading into the desert and no one has bothered to check it out?” she had a doubtful look on her face. I shrugged “I can’t say no one has explored it, after all someone must have built it. But I don’t know of anyone that has or even anyone that claims to have done it”. 

Madison pondered my answer “but then where do the ghost stories come from?” I was silent, she had a point. “I guess I never thought about it”. 

The miles flew by as we cruised across the flat sand. Madison spoke up pulling me from my day dreams. “What?” I asked having completely missed her question. “Can I drive?” I looked at the road ahead, it was more of the same easily navigable smooth sand as far as I could see. “Yeah, why not?” 

We swapped positions, Madison practically bouncing with excitement put the old suburban into gear. After just a few minutes she was comfortably cruising along. When the sun began to set we decided to stop at a wide spot in the road. There was plenty of room to set up tents next to our vehicles. 

Later that evening as we sat around a small fire enjoying a couple adult beverages Jayden spoke up. “You know for all the hype this trail has been pretty tame”. Bodie nodded in agreement “yeah I was expecting some gnarly off roading, maybe a ghost town, something of interest”. 

“I’m ok with how it’s going, if it turns out to just be a week of hanging out and bombing through the sand that’s fine with me” said Madison. I was glad she was enjoying herself, Jayden and I had gone on a few adventures like this before but this was the first time Madison and Bodie had tagged along.

Jayden gulped the last of his whiskey before standing “well I’m gonna turn in for the night, you shacking up with me Carter?” I shook my head “nah I’ll use my cot”. Jayden nodded before ducking into his tent.

Jayden and I had brought a tent to share while Bodie and Madison each brought their own. With as tired as Bodie looked I expected him to head in for the night as well but he stayed by the fire. Madison threw a twig at Bodie “go to bed before you fall in the fire”. 

Bodie jerked his head up in surprise. “Nah I’m fine, I’ll stay up”. “Dude you’re falling asleep, I don’t need a babysitter”. Bodie looked between Madison and me, he stood and walked to his tent “what ever Madi”. 

Once Bodie’s tent fell silent I turned to Madison “what was that all about?” I asked. Madison pulled her feet up onto the log we were using as a seat and rested her chin on her knees. 

“Bodie can be a bit over protective. Don’t get me wrong, I love the guy but it’s like he forgets I’m an adult”. I sat there trying to think of what to say. Ignoring my silence Madison continued “my parents were not fans of this trip, they’ve never met you or Jayden and we’re hundreds of miles away. Bodie promised to look out for me and they relented”. 

“Bodie has nothing to worry about, it’s not like you’re up alone. I’m still here”. Madison turned to me an eyebrow raised “why do you think he’s was hanging out so late?” I was a bit surprised “because of me?” Madison nodded, a small smile on her face. “People aren’t blind Carter. They see the way you look at me, the way you always conveniently end up on my team, or in the same vehicle”. 

I was glad for the dim lighting, I was sure my face was red. “So you’re aware that I like you?” Madison kept staring into the fire “yeah”. My heart beat wildly “and..?” the silence stretched out. Finally Madison sighed “And I guess I don’t know how I feel, I like you and consider you one of my closest friends but I’m not sure if I want to push things any farther than that”. It was my turn to sit quietly, I placed a hand on her shoulder “that’s ok, if you want to keep things platonic that’s fine. If you decide you would like to be more than friends you know I’m up for that”. 

Madison leaned against me “thanks Carter, let’s just see how things play out. I’m going to bed now”. I stood with her “yeah we’ve got a lot of ground to cover tomorrow, I’ll see you in the morning”. Madison climbed into her tent while I unfolded my cot. It wasn’t long before I drifted off to sleep. 

I woke to the smell of coffee and bacon, Jayden and Bodie stood by the fire as Madison sat on the log from the previous night wrapped in a blanket. Jayden threw a breakfast burrito at me “good morning sleeping beauty, care to join the rest of us?” I got to my feet and attempted to stretch the stiffness out of my joints. 

“Morning people are mentally unstable” I commented as I dug into breakfast. Bodie dumped the remains of his coffee onto the fire “so what’s the plan?” I glanced at Jayden “I assumed we would follow the trail for two days, if we don’t come across anything we will have plenty of time to get back before the weekend”. Jayden covered what remained of the fire with sand “sounds good to me let’s get a move on”. 

Packing up camp went quickly, soon we were back on the trail. Madison sat in the back still huddled up in a blanket. I couldn’t blame her, the morning had been a lot chillier than expected. Before long the terrain began to change drastically, the trail followed a ravine on one side and a rock wall on the other. 

Our progress slowed but we still managed to cover a dozen miles in less than an hour. By mid day the trail had become narrow to the point I had one tire riding the edge of the ravine and the other side pushing bushes aside. Madison was in the passenger seat acting as my spotter. 

I was concentrating on navigating over a small rock slide when Madison tapped my arm. “What’s up? I asked. “Jayden stopped and he’s flashing his headlights at us”. I put the suburban in park, a hundred yards behind us sat Jayden’s Subaru its headlights flicking on and off. 

Forcing the door open against the stiff bushes I squeezed out. I held the door as Madison followed out my side. 

We walked back to where Jayden and Bodie sat, they were looking over the edge of the ravine. “What’s up?” I asked. Jayden pointed to the jagged snapped off brush “take a peek over the edge” he said. Walking to the edge I looked over, far down below I could make out what looked like an upside down truck resting among the boulders. 

“No way, someone poor bastard went over the edge”.  “It doesn’t look like it’s been there terribly long” said Bodie.  “We should check it out” commented Madison. “I don’t know about that, it’s a long ways down” I replied but Madison was already pulling off her hoodie and planning a route in her head. “Don’t be silly Carter, I’ve climbed cliffs three times that high. What if someone is trapped inside? We can’t just drive away”. 

Before anyone could argue Madison was climbing down the ravine, I knew she was excellent rock climber but this felt stupid. A glance at Bodie told me he felt the same way. Jayden slapped me on the back “come on man, don’t worry. This is the girl that free climbs brick buildings on campus for fun. She knows what’s she’s doing”. 

I nodded, Jayden was right. We couldn’t see Madison anymore but I could still hear her grunts as well as the occasional pebble clattering down the rock face. 

After what felt like a lifetime a metallic thud rang out, I could see Madison walking on the truck. She dropped out of view again as she climbed down beside it. 

My gut twisted, it was too quiet. Something was wrong. A scream pierced the air, a primal scream of pure fear echoed up from below. “Madison!” I yelled her name but there was no reply. 

Not willing to waste another moment I climbed over the edge, I was no rock climber but I couldn’t just stand there. My progress was painfully slow, I was less than ten feet below the top when I heard an electric whine. I looked up to see Jayden was using the winch on his Subaru to repel down the cliff. 

He quickly reached me, Bodie stood at the top with the winch remote in his hand. Jayden rapidly descended past me without pause, seeing that he would reach the bottom first I climbed back to the top. Just as I got back to my feet I heard Jayden yelling from below “up! Up! Up! Pull us up!” panic filled his voice. Bodie reversed the winch, it felt like it was moving painfully slow.

Finally Jayden and Madison appeared, Bodie and I grabbed them and pulled them up the last couple feet. Madison’s face was streaked with tears and Jayden’s eyes were wide with terror. 

“What the hell happened?” I demanded. Madison didn’t reply, she walked away from us before stopping to retch in the bushes. Jayden grabbed the front of my shirt and used it to pull himself up. “There’s a body man, there was a freaking body hanging out of the truck. It looked like he was halfway out of the window when it landed, the roof collapsed pinning him there. But something got him, something split his head in half like machete through a watermelon!” Jayden looked me dead in the eye “I don’t think Madison saw it but there was teeth marks on the edge of the skull. Like something was nibbling on him, sucking his brain out”. Jayden glanced at the edge his voice coming out as a barely audible whisper “something was moving down there”.

“Alright, we need to go back. We need to call the police” said Bodie. I nodded and Jayden jumped into his car. I heard it click multiple times, Jayden beat his head against the steering wheel. Opening the door he called out “the battery is dead, we ran the winch for too long without it running”. 

“I’ve got jumpers in my suburban” even as the words left my mouth I knew it wouldn’t work. There was no way to turn around and the cables were too short to reach from the front of my truck to Jayden’s car. 

Jayden climbed out of his car “ok everyone get in the suburban, we’ll keep going until we find a place we can turn around”. There was an urgency in his voice that got us all moving. Bodie helped Madison into the back, Jayden and I got into the front. I dropped it into gear and pulled ahead a bit faster than I should have. 

Bushes scraped the side of my suburban as I avoided the edge of the ravine, the panic radiating off Madison and Jayden was contagious and I found myself driving way too fast nearly sending is all to our deaths more than once. 

Still I pushed the old Chevy hard, it bounced and clawed it’s way up the now rocky incline. We crested the top of the final hill, I rolled to a stop. Spreading out in front of us was an endless labyrinth of canyons and ravines.

I put the truck in park and shut off the engine, the area was silent save for the heavy breathing of my companions. 

I turned to look back at Brodie, he cradled Madison’s head in his lap. Her tear streaked face broke my heart. I had never seen her so scared and broken. 

Jayden was first to break the silence “I think we should set up camp”. Madison shot up in surprise “are you crazy?” she demanded “you saw the same thing I did right? We need to get out of here!” 

Jayden nodded solemnly “yeah, and I want to get out of here as badly as you do. But we don’t have enough time before sunset to make it all the way back. That trail is bad enough in the day, I don’t want to try it at night. And I really don’t want to be trying to jump start my car above that body in the dark and then try to back it down the trail”. 

Madison laid her head back down on her cousin. Bodie placed a protective hand on her “I think you’re right Jayden, but let’s all sleep inside the suburban. It’ll be tight but I don’t feel like going out there”. 

No one else felt like going outside either, so we laid out our bags and stacked in four wide. I was on one side, Madison and Bodie were in the middle and Jayden on the far side. No one complained about the lack of dinner or cramped conditions. Despite the excitement earlier I felt myself drifting off rather quickly. 

I woke with a bit of a start, my eyes looking around the darkness trying to decipher what woke me up. I nearly jumped out of my skin when I saw Madison’s wide open eyes staring at me. 

I tried to slow my beating heart “dang Madison, you scared me” I whispered. Madison slowly blinked her eyes still locked in mine. “We aren’t getting out of here” she whispered in a low voice her gaze never breaking. 

I propped myself up the best I could without rocking the truck. “Of course we are, tomorrow at first light we’ll back track and…” Madison pressed a finger to my lips.

She leaned in close and whispered directly into my ear “I haven’t slept a wink Carter, I’ve been laying here watching them walk around us. We are going to die and they’re going to eat our brains”.

I leaned back slowly looking at Madison with horror, her eyes were bloodshot and wild looking. A shadow passed over us, I fought the urge to spin around. Instead a started to slowly roll over but Madison paced a hand on my cheek “don’t” she had tears spilling down her face again “please don’t, they like it when you look at them”. 

Madison buried her head in my chest and I held her as silent sobs shook her body. At some point I fell asleep again, I woke to sunlight peering through the windows. I looked around quickly locating everyone. Once I made sure we were all accounted for I relaxed some. 

The previous nights events felt like a bad dream. I hoped that’s all they were. I gently shook Madison, waking up she gave me a sleepy smile. For a brief moment I saw my friend once again, looking around her face filled with terror again. She threw off her sleeping bag and roughly kicked Bodie “hey guys, let’s get up and get out of here”.

Bodie grumbled angrily but choose to release his temper but violently stuffing sleeping bags back into their sacks. Jayden sat up, his shaggy hair nearly covering his eyes. Choosing to skip breakfast we set out once again. I found an intersection of canyons that was large enough to back into and turn the suburban around. 

I retraced our tracks from the day before at a much saner speed. Madison rode in the front with me, her feet on the seat and arms wrapped around her knees she scanned the road ahead vigilantly. For what I wasn’t sure but it seemed to bring her some comfort. 

Jayden sat in the far back deep in his own thoughts leaving just Bodie to talk to. Not having much in common we ended up driving in silence. 

I don’t know how we didn’t die the previous day, I carefully navigate the large vehicle over rocks and down ledges until around noon. Finally I spotted a little blue car ahead. “Hey guys we made it, there’s Jayden’s car”. 

Rather than the excitement that I expected the air in the suburban grew heavy with nervousness. Madison began to fidget with her hair while Jayden looked back and forth between the side windows.

Pulling up to the Subaru I pulled the hood latch and stepped out of the suburban. Bodie came around the other side with the jumper cables. I looked back at the suburban to see Jayden and Madison peering out the window at the abyss next to us. I made sure not to get close enough to the edge to see the crushed truck below. Even though I knew I wouldn’t be able to see the body I didn’t want to chance it. 

With the jumper cables hooked up Jayden’s Subaru came to life as Bodie turned the key. I slammed the hood shut and walked to the back of the suburban, opening the back door I threw the cables in. “Are you good to drive?” I asked him. 

Jayden nodded and climbed out “yeah I’m good, I’m ready to get out of here”. 

As I closed the back doors Jayden shoved into me hard, my face bounced off the metal and I felt a tooth break. I turned around pissed off and ready to fight. 

Jayden was looking up the road while clawing for the door handle blindly. A tall man was running towards us, no it wasn’t a man. It was humanoid but it was clearly not a human.

It was nude, it’s skin a pale tan and like that of a reptile. It’s head was nearly encompassed by two massive eyes that reflected darkly. It’s mouth was not overly large but it had many needle like teeth that were barred at us. It’s long arms ended in duel scythe like blades rather than hands. 

Just as the creature was about to leap on us Jayden abandoned his attempt at fleeing and spun around to face the hellish creature. Grabbing a stone Jayden swung at the thing, the rock bounced off its thick hide. The creature lashed out with one of its bladed arms splattering my face with my friends blood.

Jayden was thrown into me nearly knocking me to the ground, as I caught him a high pitched yell rang out. Madison charged past us with a camp shovel held high. She brought it down in the creatures head! The creature stumbled back, as it stepped closer to the edge Madison swung the shovel in an upward arc catching the creature under its jaw. 

It howled as it stumbled over the edge of the cliff. It managed to catch it’s self with a single bladed hand, Madison brought the shovel down in it’s head again causing it to lose it’s grip. I swear at that moment, standing there looking over the edge, shoulders squared and hair a mess Madison was the sexiest thing I had ever seen.

Suddenly Jayden began to scream in a way I had never heard a human scream before, his body started convulsing in my arms. Brodie shoved me aside and grabbed Jayden “grab it! We need to go!” Brodie yelled. 

Confused I looked to where Brodie was pointing, I couldn’t understand it at first. A couple feet away in the blood soaked sand lay most of an arm. I looked at Jayden and saw Brodie doing his best to tie a tourniquet around the stub that had once been Jayden’s right arm. It now ended a couple inches above his elbow. 

I staggered towards to the severed limb, it was disturbingly heavy. I nearly dropped it as it flopped in my hand. Brodie was screaming at Madison as he drug Jayden into the back of the suburban.

Madison had her back turned to the edge, the creature was behind her. It’s blade held high ready to decapitate her! Without thinking I threw the arm, it flew over Madison and slapped the creature in the face. It paused its attack just long enough for Madison to run to the suburban. 

I ran past the open drivers door ignoring Brodie’s increasingly panicked screams. I was not going to drive back to those canyons, somehow I knew if we went back we would never get out.

I jumped into the driver’s seat of the Subaru, I put it in reverse and dropped the clutch at full throttle. The car launched backwards towards the cliff, I rolled out just as it went over the edge. “Sorry Jayden” I murmured hoping Jayden would have the chance to be mad about his car when this was an over.

Getting to my knees I saw my suburban barreling towards me! I managed the grab the bull bar and throw myself onto the hood. Brodie was behind the wheel and he wasn’t slowing for anything. A glance behind the suburban was all I needed to know why. 

The creature was in fast pursuit, it howled with rage as it tried to keep pace. I clung to the roof rack as best I could. Brodie seemed to have the suburbans throttle to the floor with no intention if letting up.

My heart skipped a beat each time the big old truck grazed the cliff side or bounced dangerously close to the edge.

After what felt like ages Brodie slowed enough for me to climb in through the passenger window. Madison and I kept watch out the back windows while trying to tend to Jayden. Brodie kept up the fast pace even when we hit the sand that marked the beginning of the trail. 

I sighed in relief as the yellow gate that marked the start of our cursed journey came into sight. Someone had closed it again after we went through. Luckily it wasn’t chained shut because Brodie didn’t even slow down. 

After crashing through the gate Brodie pulled onto the asphalt and gave the old girl everything she had. We roared down the deserted road as the sun hung low in the sky.

Jayden was moaning incoherently, I kept pressure on his stub in an attempt to slow the bleeding. At some point the tourniquet Brodie had applied had come off and the bleeding had resumed. 

The hospital stay, the police interviews, they all blurred together. I couldn’t even tell you what  happened the first 24 hours we spent in town. 

Brodie is going to pull through, there’s a slight infection but the doctors are confident it’s not serious. 

Strangely the local police turned the investigation over to the park rangers. 

They interviewed each of us separately, I tried to tell them about the monster and the body in the truck but they just cut me off. “Listen kid” said the head ranger “that trail has stood empty for a very long time, we even put a gate up. What happened was self inflicted, I expect you to shut up about it and move on”. 

It didn't sit right with me, Madison later told me the body they saw had a ranger uniform. It didn’t take much digging to see the station had hired a new ranger from out of state a few months back. The website said he had been terminated a week ago. 

There’s something living at the end of the Rams Ridge Trail, maybe more than one. I know I won’t sleep easy until I’m out of this state.
