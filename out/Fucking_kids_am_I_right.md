Having a baby is terrifying enough without your next-door neighbor’s brutal murder.

They could at least have put everything in one body bag. The rumor is that they didn’t find the top half of him until the bottom half was already zipped up. So the crowd that had converged next door got to watch two separate gurneys roll Fred into an ambulance. 

The most horrifying part was seeing the paramedic vomit. They see the worst of the worst, so I can’t even begin to imagine what actually happened to Fred. 

That was enough for me. My wife was home with Oliver, who was scheduled to wake up from his nap and make green shit while I was changing him in about fifteen minutes. So I turned around to leave the looky-loos and police to their speculation.

That’s when I saw the scratches in the ground.

They were deep and long, like someone had taken a scythe to Bob’s yard. Periodic slashes almost looked like footsteps as they led to his fence.

The same fence that separated his yard from mine.

Nauseating fear crept through my chest and froze my diaphragm as I realized that the claw marks had sliced their way up to the top of the fence.

Just like something had walked up it. 

I sprinted to my front door, terrified that I wasn’t moving fast enough while simultaneously not wanting to see what I might find inside. 

“What’s wrong?” my wife asked as I burst through the door. I didn’t slow down as I took the steps two at a time to the second floor. As I wheeled around the landing, bones of the 110-year-old house creaking, I could see through the window where the claw marks had torn through my back lawn. They disappeared from my angle of view directly below Oliver's room.

I sprinted down the hall, skidding to a halt just in front of his doorway. For half a second, I balked: 

If something terrible was on the other side of this door, I was in the final good moment of my life. 

I held my breath and opened it. 

Oliver was sound asleep in his crib, completely whole. I belted a cry of relief and sank to the floor, trying to start my lungs again. 

I was so relieved that I didn’t notice it at first. 

I opened my eyes. I stood up.

His window was open. The claw marks traced down the wall, across the floor, and made a beeline directly to his crib.

That’s where they stopped.

Gag reflex and bladder ready to fire, I walked over to my sleeping son, hands shaking uncontrollably. I stopped right next to him, looking down, not wanting to believe what I was seeing.

*How?*

His tiny, razor-sharp fingernails were coated in crimson that dripped along his open palms, staining his fingers red. I wanted to tell myself that it was red paint.

It wasn’t red paint.

An oppressive copper smell swirled my thoughts as I stared at his slightly open, toothless mouth, covered in red from his eyes to his neck. A bloody snot bubble frothed from his nose, expanding and contracting with each breath.

That wasn’t the worst part, though.

No, the worst part was that between his fingers, dangling from an severed optic nerve, was Fred’s [eyeball](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).
