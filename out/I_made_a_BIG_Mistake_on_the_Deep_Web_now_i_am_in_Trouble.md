Since the news has been full of reports about this Sickness that has broken out, about  alleged monsters or weird Spiders running around and governments collapsing, I’ve been worried. 

So far, our country has been spared and supposedly nothing and nobody is crossing the border. But I don’t trust the suits. Sooner or later, everything will go down the drain here too. So I had a plan. Buy supplies, a few guns, ammunition and a small hut in the mountains. 

Then I couldn’t give a single „F“ what those spiders and the undead did to the fools here. I just needed a little cash. A few thousand should be enough. And thanks to a documentary on YouTube, I now know where to get it. I’m going to sell my Lady on the deep web. She was useless anyway. 

She couldn’t cook, she was no good in bed and she was always crying. She needed her daily thrashing with the belt so that she would finally shut up. The instructions on how to get into the dark web were pretty easy to understand. I only needed one day and I had access to the darkest corners of the internet. Even for a hardened guy like me, it was intense to see what was on offer on various sites. You could even order human flesh. For a whole lot of money of course. 

If you wanted to, you could even order a guy to come to your house and eat a part of you. A foot or an arm. What sick stuff. Thanks to the documentary, I already knew the name of the site I was looking for and quickly found it. Here you could now post your own auction. It was pretty simple, like on Ebay. You had to enter the exact measurements, gender, hair color and age of the person and then wait for offers. 

I came into the kitchen after posting the offer, because it was 6:01 pm. Time for dinner. I couldn’t believe that the food wasn’t on the table yet. The old lady was still in the kitchen. I was starting to get fed up. I went to her without saying anything. She was just about to come up with some excuse when I grabbed her hand and plunged it into the pot of boiling water and spaghetti. She screamed and moaned until I smacked her. Then I went out to get a burger. 

The pot and all the spaghetti were on the floor when I left and I really hoped for her sake that the mess would be cleaned up when I got home. And indeed, everything was tidy. I only saw that out of the corner of my eye, because I went straight to my study. I was overcome with curiosity to see if anyone had responded to my offer yet. I booted up my laptop and logged in. The latest bid immediately caught my eye. MisterPeace69 offered me 20 000 dollars for the old lady! That was crazy. Fortunately, I had the option of accepting the bid immediately instead of waiting for the auction to end. I was now 20 000 dollars richer, baby! 

In the checkout process, I wrote that I would like the money in cash and asked the buyer for a suitable drop-off location. I was told to come to a disused quarry about 50 Miles from here tomorrow evening at 10 PM. To be on the safe side, I looked at the route beforehand and saw that I could easily reach the quarry via remote country roads. That was perfect. 

When the time came the next evening, my adrenaline level rose dramatically. I’d done things that were against the law before, but nothing like this. Marie, that was the old lady’s name, didn’t suspect a thing. Without warning, I punched her in her pretty, young face and tied her up. To stop her screaming, I stuffed my worn underwear into her mouth. Then I heaved her onto the back of my old Ford Ranger and covered her with a tarpaulin. The journey was quiet, I didn’t even meet another Driver on the way. The quarry was also deserted and I drove slowly down the winding road. The others were over half an hour late. 

But what the hell? I’m happy to wait 30 minutes for 20 000 dollars. I was a little surprised that they only came in a small car. There was a guy with a hood at the wheel. A huge guy with a paper bag on his head squeezed out of the small car. He was wearing a sweater and something like a nurse’s costume underneath. 

I didn’t know if this was a sick game for him or if it was customary for people to dress up for these kinds of handovers. The muscle man came over to me and threw a doctor’s bag at my feet. He wore a Little Badge on his Nurse Outfit that had a Smiley Face on it and said „Team Peace“. I could see in the spotlight that the Bag was filled with bundles of money. My heart was pounding with joy. 

As the huge nurse didn’t say anything, I took off the tarpaulin and pointed at Marie, who seemed panicked. From the look of those guys, she should be too. Surprisingly gently, he grabbed her shoulder, ran over with her and took off her restraints. As I quickly got into my car and drove away, I could still see the woman sitting down in the back seat. Well, I wished her a lot of fun! Over the next few days, I started to buy my supplies. I was just about to pack all the tinned food into a box when there was a knock at the door. That made me a little uneasy. 

Normally there was never a knock on my door. Luckily, I had already got myself a Glock 29 ready for action, which I pulled out as I went to the door. I opened it and saw Marie lying in front of my door. There was no one else to be seen. At first I thought she was dead, but then I noticed that her chest was rising and falling. But her eyes. They seemed so fixed. 

I dragged the damn woman inside. We didn’t have any direct neighbors, but nobody had to notice. She didn’t make a sound. Somehow she was drugged. Damn. Our government and our legal system were still intact, so I couldn’t give her the chance to speak to anyone. Without much thought, I loaded her Butt into the big basement. I had no idea what to do with her. I don’t know why, but I put her some bread and a bottle of water. Maybe I was feeling guilty. I checked on her again the next day. She hadn’t touched the bread and water, but she was more alert now. She was sitting against the wall and eating something. As the light was broken, I had to get my flashlight. When the beam of light hit her, I saw that she had caught a rat and was eating it. 

She just bit into its back and ripped muscles, tendons and even parts of the spine out of the poor animal with her mouth. The blood was spurting. I couldn’t watch it, went back upstairs and locked the door again. Over the next two days, I thought about what I should do with her. Over and over again, I could only think of one solution. I had to end her. Even though I had repeatedly beaten, humiliated and perhaps tortured her over the last few years, I felt sorry for her now. Seeing what she had become made me feel guilty. And I didn’t need that right now. 

So I took my Glock and went down to the cellar with my flashlight. Her body would probably never be found. When the apocalypse breaks out here in the country in a few weeks, no one will have time to look for her. Poor thing. It smelled awful in the cellar. It must be the rotting rat. It was no longer in the place where Marie had been sitting before. 

Maybe she was hiding from me. There were a few water containers in the back corner. There was enough room for her behind them. I walked slowly and carefully to the crates and around them. I didn’t find Marie there. But parts of her. Her long blonde hair was everywhere, her teeth, blood and fingernails. What the hell had happened to her. 

When I heard the loud breathing behind me, I remembered something. That’s exactly how it started in the other places, like they Said in the news. Relatives changed, withdrew. At some point, a cocoon was found that was empty, because the spider was already on the hunt for prey. But there was no cocoon here. I slowly turned around and looked into her hungry, huge brown eyes. She was No Spider. 

She was something else. With her long snout, pointed teeth and powerful paws, she looked like a wolf. Her naked body was no longer as pretty as it used to be. She had that bristly black hair all over her. As quickly as I could, I raised my gun and fired, but she knocked it out of my hand with her paw. Then she grabbed me and bit my neck. Then she bit my face. I could smell her stinking breath as she tore my cheeks apart. She also tore my stomach and chest apart with her claws. I could even see my intestines. But then she stopped. As if it was some kind of instinct. 

She looked down at me and left the cellar. She was going to go hunting, I knew that now. I thought I was going to die now, but I didn’t. I was just changing. It hurt so much. As i am writing this, i start to hear the Voice of the man Inside My Head. So, be warned. These Creatures Are coming. And they come for you! I have to stop writing this now. I can feel im about to lose myself. May God help us all!
