I knew there would be repercussions when Kazuma Yokoyama was acquitted.

&#x200B;

With 17 charges of sexual assault and more than 8 current and former Idols from groups he represented set to testify against him along with several members of their familes and friends he should have been convicted! 

&#x200B;

He should have been.

&#x200B;

*He should have been.*

&#x200B;

But he wasn’t, and maybe I shouldn’t have been so naive to get my hopes up. Kazuma was bad, yes… but he was only one pig in the filthy, stinking pen that was Merrymaker Music. When the accusations had come out, they’d let him get flogged in public for his sins as if he were the worst of them, when really he was anything but. 

&#x200B;

Then - when 5 of the Idols who’d been willing to testify against him suddenly backed out and changed their stories, they ensured that all the accusations were quietly swept under the rug and the media suddenly changed its tune.

&#x200B;

Kazuma never raped those girls! Five of them event went back and said so and the three who didn’t were clearly just doing all of this to get back at poor Kazuma for some other perceived slight! It was all false accusations!

&#x200B;

When I went up on the stand, and told the jury about how Kazuma Yokoyama had groped me and other members of my group before a show two years prior, and how I *knew* he’d done even worse things to Risa… I was clearly lying! When Risa went up and told the jury in *sickening* detail of the times Kazuma had raped her… it was all just lies. That’s what the story became. It was all just lies.

&#x200B;

I knew testifying against Kazuma would be the end of my career, but I really didn’t care. Sure, I didn’t expect my testimony to be damning or everything, but I’d hoped that by standing up to him, others might come forward too. Every voice is just one voice, but if one doesn’t speak up, others won’t, right?

&#x200B;

I truly believed that…

&#x200B;

I truly believed that even if my testimony wasn’t what damned him, I could at least inspire others to stand up to him!

&#x200B;

So much for that idea.

&#x200B;

I won’t lie and say that I wasn’t disappointed in the outcome. I was. But I guess I took some solace in knowing that even if it cost me everything, I’d at least tried to stand for something… and honestly, being an Idol wasn’t worth it anyways. 

&#x200B;

Once upon a time, this life was my dream. I wanted to be a star! I wanted to be famous! I wanted to be an Idol, just like the ones I saw on TV! 

&#x200B;

Eventually, my parents signed me up with Merrymaker Music. They said they were launching a new group. ‘*Mischief Maids*’. It was meant to be more of a niche group, with a bit of a ‘*Halloween*’ vibe to it. I put in the work. For 10 to 14 hours a day, I put in the work.

&#x200B;

I learned to sing, I learned to dance, I learned how to move, how to talk, *who to be.*

&#x200B;

And I wasn’t the only one.

&#x200B;

Mischief Maids had 13 members. It *always* had 13 members. Unlucky 13. It was part of the gimmick. Most of them came and went. But Risa Mizuno and I joined up around the same time and we were just about the only original members left.

&#x200B;

Honestly - I think Risa was half the reason Mischief Maids enjoyed the success that it had. She always had a certain charisma to her. There was just this… radiance to her. You could never quite put your finger on it, but it was there. It was palpable. Maybe it was the way she smiled or the way she carried herself. Maybe it was just the fact that she could look effortlessly beautiful. A perfect Idol, a perfect doll with delicate porcelain features, an ever present smile and long, sleek black hair. Maybe it was none of these, and her allure simply came from the whispered history that followed in her wake.

&#x200B;

I’d heard the rumors, of course and I knew the story. Risa had already had a brief brush with fame before she’d become an Idol… or I suppose it might be better to call it infamy. I have a feeling that infamy was why Merrymaker had wanted her as part of Mischief Maids. Even if the story wasn’t true, it was *interesting.*

&#x200B;

Supposedly, sometime during her youth, Risa had been possessed by some kind of entity. According to the stories, things had gotten so bad that they’d taken her to a Shinto temple to try and banish whatever entity was inside of her.

&#x200B;

I’d heard the audio recording allegedly made during the evening of that ritual… the demonic screams and chanting in some language nobody could identify. A lot of people even claimed they heard Risa say the name of some archdemon during the ritual. Supposedly the very archdemon possessing her.

&#x200B;

*Izamono.*

&#x200B;

It was chilling… although Risa always insisted that the audio was fake. Not in public, but in private, whenever anyone asked about it she’d just laugh it off and say:

  *“Oh, that? Someone on the internet made that! It’s totally fake!”*

&#x200B;

Actually - according to her, her *‘posession’* was just some neurological condition she’d had when she was a child. Someone in her sleepy little hometown had made a sensationalist story out of it and the urban legend just grew from there until it finally evolved into another Japanese ghost story to terrify Americans on the internet. The only reason she didn’t publicly set the record straight was that it was good marketing.

&#x200B;

*Mischief Maids, the Idol Group with the girl who was actually possessed!*

&#x200B;

It drummed up some good publicity… far better than:

&#x200B;

*Mischief Maids, the Idol Group that turned on their producer!*

&#x200B;

But - after Kazuma’s trial that’s what we were.

&#x200B;

Like I said, I knew it was the end of my career. Risa knew it too. But honestly… neither of us had any regrets. 

&#x200B;

If nothing else, we’d given up everything to try and expose that pig and even if his disgusting pig friends had gotten him off the hook… in a way we were free of him. At least, we thought we were.

&#x200B;

I should have known there would be repercussions. But I never could have imagined they’d be so horrific…

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

  *“I understand we’ve had a falling out,”* He’d said to me over the phone. *“But I want to make amends, Hisako. We’ve had a good career together. Let’s not throw that away!”*

&#x200B;

He sounded so sincere… but when he spoke, all I could think about was the sour smell of his breath when he’d pushed me up against a wall and put his hands all over me.

 *“Hisako… don’t you look so fuckable tonight?”* He’d said.

&#x200B;

It’d been years since that had happened but I’ve never been able to forget those words… nor have I ever been able to forget the way he looked at Risa, as if she were nothing more than a piece of meat for him to salivate over. Still… he was offering me an olive branch. 

&#x200B;

Was I mistaken to try and accept it? My gut told me to say no. But even if he hadn’t uttered a single threat against me, I could still hear it behind his words. He didn’t need to say it out loud. The threat was still there.

&#x200B;

*‘Accept this, or I’ll take everything from you.’*

&#x200B;

I knew better than to accept. I knew better, but…

&#x200B;

  “What exactly did you have in mind?” I’d asked him.

  *“I’ve been planning a gathering. A dinner of sorts. A chance to… reconcile. I’ve invited Risa and the other girls who testified too, including the ones who backed out.”*

  “Why?”

&#x200B;

I had to at least ask, if for no other reason than to give him a chance to alleviate my suspicions. That was the compromise I made with myself.

&#x200B;

*“Look… despite what the agency said to the fans and the way this got spun to the media, you and I both know the truth, Hisako. I’m not so arrogant as to deny that. I know that what I’m offering doesn’t make amends… healing our relationship will take time. But I want to show you, all of you that despite the acquittal I am a changed man!”*

&#x200B;

That really did sound too good to be true… 

&#x200B;

But idiot that I was, I didn’t want to believe that. I wanted to believe that every word he said was sincere and that we really would just put all of this behind us… I wanted to believe that… and so like an idiot I ate out of his palm.

&#x200B;

I should have known better.

&#x200B;

*I should have known better than that.*

&#x200B;

Although even if I did… I couldn’t have imagined what he was really planning.

&#x200B;

 *“Risa’s already agreed to come… and it would be good to have you both there.”*

His mention of Risa’s name was what pushed me over the edge and made me agree. If she was willing to give him a chance after all he’d done, why shouldn’t I do the same. It never occurred to me that she probably hadn’t agreed to go out of a desire to forgive… but I wanted to lie to myself… and so lie to myself I did.

  “Alright… just tell me where and when,” I said and sealed my fate.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Standing in the penthouse Kazuma was hosting his little event in - I couldn’t help but feel like something was wrong here. Outside the window, I could see the lights of Tokyo shining vibrantly in the night and I could see my own face reflected in the glass. I could hear people in the main room of the penthouse mingling. Idols and socialites. Some of the latter were representatives of Merrymaker. Others were Americans that I didn’t recognize.

&#x200B;

I could hear music as some of the Idols performed. Girls from other groups, most of whom I knew by name only. Sato, Hinata, Yamada. They just performed small sets to please the crowd, although after they’d done their performance they didn’t seem to stick around long.

&#x200B;

I figured they were just leaving the moment they could and I couldn’t blame them either. This felt like a glorified handshake event… a publicity stunt that promised goodwill and otherwise meant nothing. My gut told me that I’d wasted my time in coming here but… well… now that I was there, I couldn’t help but put on my stage face.

&#x200B;

There was a part of me that hated this… standing here and acting like Hisako Miyauchi the Idol when I should be here as Hisako Miyauchi, a woman Kazuma had wronged! God this was all so fucking… lifeless…

&#x200B;

*This was all so fucking miserable.*

&#x200B;

“You couldn’t stand it either, huh?” A voice asked behind me, and I turned to see Risa standing in the hall behind me. She must have slipped away from the event. Like me, she was dressed in her *Mischief Maids* costume. Hers was distinct because of its spiderweb patterned nylons. 

  “No… not really,” I admitted. “I can’t imagine how hard this is on you, though…”

&#x200B;

Risa smiled sadly as she walked up beside me. She didn’t give me an answer. Behind her doll makeup and porcelain skin, I could see the utter despair on her face… her eyes which had once been so full of vibrant sparkling colors were now just dull and lifeless. 

  “I’d offer you a cigarette if I could,” I said.

  “It’s fine… I’m quitting smoking anyways.”

  “You are?”

  “Kazuma doesn’t like it…”

&#x200B;

I felt my stomach turn.

  “I would’ve thought you’d quit the business first…”

  “Would you?” She asked.

  “Up until now I wasn’t sure. But I’ve made up my mind… I should’ve known better than to accept that pig at his word… but I wanted to believe he was sincere. Now I know he wasn’t. This is all just part of the show… a big song and dance to push this whole controversy under the rug once and for all. I’m an idiot for even going along with it for as long as I have. So I’m done. Tomorrow I’m calling the studio and I’m getting out of my contract. I don’t care if I have to stand in the middle of Tokyo and make a scene. I don’t care if I never sing again. I’m done.” 

&#x200B;

Risa stared at me with a look that was hard to read.

  “So you’re really going to walk away?” She asked.

  “Yup. And you should too! Everything we’ve got... it’s not worth this.”

  “Maybe…” Risa said, although she didn’t sound so sure.

  “Not maybe, absolutely! We could probably make a clean break from all of this you know! No more Kazuma, no more Merrymaker. Just us doing what we wanted!”

&#x200B;

She cracked a small, sad smile but didn’t say much else.

  “Yeah, that would be nice,” She said. Although she said it as if it was nothing more than a pleasant fantasy.

&#x200B;

In the next room, I could hear the crowd applaud as the performer currently on stage, a girl by the name of Nanami Omori, finished her performance. Omori had been one of the ones who’d dropped out of testifying and as the crowd applauded her, I could hear the announcer address the crowd in English.

&#x200B;

***“Ladies and Gentlemen, Nanami Omori! What a show folks, what a show! If you appreciated it and have an appetite for more, make sure to find her and make sure she knows!”***

&#x200B;

Why they’d hired only an English announcer for this event was beyond me… let alone why they’d hired one so tediously annoying. *‘Jake the Marvelous Host’* as he’d called himself. His voice was like something out of a shitty cartoon and his efforts at speaking Japanese were borderline offensive. Still, I’d seen Kazuma speaking with him during the night…

&#x200B;

***“Folks, we’re gonna have a short intermission before sending out another round of food, and then we’re gonna continue with our next special guests… Risa Mizuno and Hisako Miyauchi from Mischief Maids!”***

&#x200B;

I rolled my eyes.

  “Guess we’re up next,” I said. “Finally… soon as we’re done, we can get out of here.”

 “Can we?” Risa asked.

  “I’m pretty sure we can. I haven’t seen the other girls who’ve performed around after they’ve finished. I’m thinking they’re leaving the moment they’re allowed to. Omori’s probably sprinting for the door as we speak.”

&#x200B;

And it was at that exact moment that I was proven right.

&#x200B;

Omori came through the door behind us quietly, and headed down the hall towards the bathroom. I figured she was going to change, and get hell out and I couldn’t blame her one bit. Risa watched her go, before looking over at me.

&#x200B;

  “I should probably use the bathroom before we go on stage…” She said, “How long have we got? Fifteen minutes?”

  “Give or take,” I said. “I’m gonna grab some more food for the road. I’ll see you in a minute?”

&#x200B;

Risa nodded, and followed Omori towards the bathroom while I went back to the main room. Almost on instinct, my smile returned as I put on my face. I greeted a few people who stopped to talk to me and shook their hands as I made my way over to the freshly restocked food table. They had brought out more of those tasty little steak bites they’d had earlier. The meat was juicy and a little sweet.

&#x200B;

I normally wouldn’t have gorged myself on them, but considering that I intended this to be my final performance as an Idol, I didn’t really give a damn if people saw me eating.

&#x200B;

  “Hisako! Enjoying the refreshments?”

&#x200B;

I paused to see Kazuma walking up to me and felt a quiet chill run through me at the sight of him. He was a somewhat awkward looking man, although it’s difficult to describe exactly how. Something about his face wasn’t quite right. It was almost as if it was too wide in the middle, and his eyes seemed simultaneously too large and too small. He had short, thick black hair, combed neatly to one side. Beside him was the man who been MCing the event so far. ‘*Jake the Marvelous Host.*’ He was an unimpressive man somewhere in his twenties to forties who looked like he barely ever left the house, with big square glasses, messy hair and a socially inept smile. He looked like a hikikomori… a shut in who contributed nothing to society save for angry blog posts about women who’d rejected him. ‘Marvelous’ was not a word I would have used to describe him. 

&#x200B;

  “I wanted to take a moment to introduce Jake Aberdeen! I’ve worked with him before, he’s always such a pleasure to have at events like this!”

Jake offered me a hand and in butchered Japanese attempted to say:

  *“Pleased to meet you Miyauchi-san!”*

I just spoke in English to make it easier for him. Just because I didn’t particularly care to meet him didn’t give me a valid excuse to be a complete asshole.

  “It’s nice to meet you too.”

&#x200B;

I shook his hand, as Kazuma took one of the steak bites.

  “Hisako is really something special,” He said, continuing our conversation in English. “I scouted her myself… she had such a look of innocence and beauty back then. Almost as much as Risa.”

  “Oh she’s just as intoxicating as Risa is!” Jake said. “I’d love to meet her too, tonight!”

  “Oh you shall, I was hoping to invite Risa for a drink after the show… perhaps you’d care to join us?” Kazuma looked over at me.

&#x200B;

I kept up my fake smile.

  “Of course!” I said, mostly because I couldn’t think up an excuse not to on the spot. 

  “Excellent! We’re looking forward to it!” Kazuma said, “Good luck up there!”

&#x200B;

With that, he and Jake were gone.

&#x200B;

I grabbed another steak bite for the road before getting a drink and making my way toward the stage area. I figured Risa would be along shortly and as expected, she didn’t disappoint. Only when she came back to the party, something was off…

&#x200B;

I could see it in her eyes and in the way she carried herself. Her body was stiffer than it had been before and she looked a shade paler.

  “Ready to go?” I asked, although my voice faltered a little.

&#x200B;

Risa didn’t need to tell me that she wasn’t ready. I could see it on her face. She looked like she was about to break down into tears.

  “Risa…?”

  “*We need to go… now…”* 

&#x200B;

I could hear the way her voice quaked. This wasn’t the same Risa I’d spoken to less than ten minutes ago. That Risa had been scared, but this Risa was *terrified.*

  “What? We’re on in a couple of minutes…”

  “I don’t care, Hisako we need to go right now! Please!”

&#x200B;

The look in her eyes… the silent pleading… This wasn’t like her. I’d known Risa for long enough to know *this wasn’t like her* and I wasn’t going to stand around and ask questions or insist that the show must go on. I’d already humored this event enough. I was done humoring it.

  “Alright, let’s go.”

&#x200B;

I didn’t argue with her. I just offered her my hand so we could leave together. She took it, and pulled me toward the door, away from the stage. I didn’t think anyone would notice us although from the corner of my eye I saw Kazuma watching from his seat. He wasn’t smiling. If anything his expression seemed almost… curious…

&#x200B;

Whatever was going through his head, I didn’t care. I let Risa pull me out into the hall and followed her toward the elevator.

&#x200B;

  “What’s going on?” I asked as soon as we were clear of the party. “You look like you just saw a ghost!”

  “Omori… they… they killed Omori…”

&#x200B;

The words hit me like a bullet. My feet suddenly felt like they were made of lead.

  “They… what?”

  “They killed Omori… I… I saw them… when she went to the bathroom to change, someone grabbed her… they didn’t see me… I saw them… I saw them taking her back to the kitchen and… oh God…”

&#x200B;

Risa’s voice trembled, she looked downright terrified… and I was struggling to comprehend the meaning of the words that had just come out of her mouth. I didn’t stop to ask questions though, not until we reached the elevator.

  “Are… are you sure?” I asked as she pressed the button. “Risa are you-”

  “They cut her throat, Hisako… they took her into the kitchen and they… they… there were other bodies too… other girls… Sato, Yamada, Hinata…”

&#x200B;

Those names sent a chill through me.

&#x200B;

The other girls who’d performed…

&#x200B;

Other girls who would have testified against Kazuma along myself and Risa… although they’d all backed out.

&#x200B;

  “W-what…?”

The things Risa was saying… they didn’t sound real. They *couldn’t* have been real!

  “They’re killing them… they’re… they’re… the food on the tables… they’re…”

Risa didn’t need to finish her sentence as her meaning dawned on me, accompanied by a vile twisting in my stomach.

&#x200B;

No…

&#x200B;

No, that wasn’t possible…

&#x200B;

The meat they’d set out, it couldn’t be… it couldn’t…

&#x200B;

The elevator door opened, but I could barely move. A single thought anchored me to the ground.

&#x200B;

Had I…

&#x200B;

Had I just eaten human flesh?

&#x200B;

*Had I just eaten another person?*

  “Hisako!”

&#x200B;

Risa tugged at my hand, pulling me into the elevator but not pulling me away from my thoughts. She took out her cell phone with a shaking hand, and dialed for a cab.

  “We need to leave…” She said quietly, “We need to get out of here… call the police… something…”

My head was still reeling, trying to process.

&#x200B;

The other girls had all disappeared after their performances… the girls who Kazuma had likely wanted to silence. Risa wouldn’t lie about what she’d seen… the horror in her eyes… the way she’d begged me to leave with her, she wouldn’t have made that story up just to get me to leave. She wouldn’t have.

&#x200B;

Which meant that I’d eaten people…

&#x200B;

*Oh God, I’d eaten people…* 

&#x200B;

*Oh God… they were going to kill us after our performance, weren’t they? They were going to feed us to the audience!*

&#x200B;

***What the fuck?***

&#x200B;

The elevator lurched to a sudden stop, and Risa and I froze.

*“Leaving so soon? You haven’t even had a chance to perform yet!”*

&#x200B;

Kazuma’s cold voice greeted us from a speaker somewhere in the elevator and I felt my blood turn to ice. Risa began to tremble, a look of utter hopelessness crossing her face.

*“The kitchen says you wandered in a little early, Risa… what a naughty girl you are, spoiling my surprise for you. You and Hisako were meant to be the main course, you know… the grand finale for tonights event.”*

&#x200B;

He wasn’t even hiding it…

&#x200B;

I could see tears filling Risa’s eyes, and I could almost imagine the twisted smile on Kazuma’s lips.

*“Oh don’t sob like that… it’s unattractive,”* He crooned. *“You hurt me, Risa… you both did. You stood in front of the world and dragged my good name through the mud… how am I supposed to react to that?”*

&#x200B;

The elevator began to move again, only this time it went up.

*“Thankfully… some associates of mine were willing to help me clean up this mess you’ve made. I thought this little event might be appropriate. Once upon a time, I made you everything you are. Now I am unmaking you and taking it all back.”*

“No..” Risa said, the tears streaming down her cheeks, “No… please…”

&#x200B;

I couldn’t utter a word. The impossible reality of this situation hadn’t hit me yet… I knew it was real but my brain hadn’t accepted it yet. The elevator moved back up, floors ticking away as we were returned to Kazuma’s penthouse.

&#x200B;

Risa took a step back as the doors opened and we were greeted by the smiling face of Kazuma Yokoyama.

  “It’s a shame… I really was hoping to see you perform one last time…” He said, as two men stepped out from behind him. They grabbed us, dragging us out of the elevator, kicking and screaming. Fighting to live.

&#x200B;

But we weren’t strong enough.

&#x200B;

  “Take them to the stage… the people still want a show, we’ll give them one!” Kazuma said. 

  “*No…*” Risa sobbed, “*No, don’t… please… please don’t…*”

&#x200B;

But her pleas fell on deaf ears. We were dragged, fighting all the way back to the party… back to the stage.

&#x200B;

The moment we entered the room, those inside applauded, cheering for us as if we’d come back for an encore. But no.

&#x200B;

They weren’t cheering to watch us perform. They were cheering to watch us die. And as we were dragged to the stage, Kazuma seemed to soak up their cheers and applause as if it was all for him.

&#x200B;

***“Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Risa Mizuno and Hisako Miyauchi from Mischief Maids!”*** Jake declared. ***“We may not hear them sing tonight, BUT WE’RE DEFINITELY GONNA HEAR THEM SCREAM!”***

&#x200B;

This had to be some kind of nightmare. This had to be a nightmare that I was going to wake up from soon… it had to be…

&#x200B;

I kept praying that it was. But when I saw the glint of a knife in Kazuma’s hands… I knew that this was it. This was the end of my life. And there at the end… I didn’t know how to feel. Not too long ago, I’d been proud that I’d tried to stand up to Kazuma at the trial. But kneeling on the stage, waiting to die… I didn’t feel an ounce of pride.

&#x200B;

If I could’ve taken it back… if I could’ve been a coward… I would have. I would’ve done it just so I could live.

  “You…” 

&#x200B;

Kazuma grabbed Risa by the hair, jerking her head back. I could hear her hyperventilating. I could see the terror in her tear filled eyes.

  “Everything I’ve done for you, my dear and you’ve treated me so harshly… you really do disappoint me… sweet Risa…”

&#x200B;

He ran his fingers through her hair, looking down at her with an almost melancholy expression.

  “I’ll miss you so dearly…”

  “No…” She said, uttering her final choked sob as Kazuma drew the knife across her throat.

&#x200B;

The sound she made.

&#x200B;

The sound…

&#x200B;

The sound…

&#x200B;

That… wet, strangled gasp… 

&#x200B;

The sight of her dark blood spilling out over her pale skin. The look in her eyes… the realization. I remember screaming as I watched him toss Risa to the ground. Her legs kicked and writhed. Her eyes bulged as she struggled to breathe, only to drown in her own blood.

&#x200B;

Kazuma looked down at her, a tranquil smile on his lips the whole time as she expired… and then his eyes settled on me. In the distance, I heard the crowd cheering. Applauding Risa’s death.

&#x200B;

I hated them.

&#x200B;

*I hated Kazuma.*

&#x200B;

But there was nothing I could do but stare at him, hating him with every fibre of my being.

&#x200B;

  “And Hisako…” He crooned. “You know if Risa hadn’t been more interesting, it would have been you at the front of Mischief Maids… I’d always thought you’d make a good replacement for her if I ever needed to get rid of her. A shame… I’ll need to find someone else.”

  “Fuck you…”

&#x200B;

As last words went, they weren’t especially Idol-like. But I think they made my point pretty clear.

Kazuma just laughed and seized me by the hair.

  “Maybe while you’re still warm…” He teased as he pressed the knife to my throat.

&#x200B;

This was it.

&#x200B;

I almost closed my eyes… but in the end I chose to look at him. I wanted him to see the hatred on my face. I wanted him to see it.

&#x200B;

I felt the cold metal against my neck and waited for the pain.

&#x200B;

But the pain never came.

&#x200B;

Instead, there was only screaming. 

&#x200B;

Kazuma turned, eyes narrowing as he looked over at Risa’s body. She writhed on the ground violently, screaming all the while as she did. Those screams.

&#x200B;

Those screams were almost as chilling as the nightmare I’d been living.

&#x200B;

And worse still, they sounded familiar.

&#x200B;

Risa had always sworn that the recording of her exorcism was fake… but the sounds coming out of her mouth sounded disturbingly like the sounds I’d heard on that recording. Kazuma remained frozen, as if he wasn’t sure what to think… and when Risa’s blood began to flow back into the wound in her neck, I saw him take a step back, eyes widening in fear.

&#x200B;

Risa’s wound closed as she let out one more shriek that barely sounded human. 

&#x200B;

Then…

&#x200B;

Silence.

&#x200B;

Kazuma stood still as a statue and the audience was quiet, staring at Risa’s body as she lay motionless on the ground. Then she was on her feet. It was all so… fluid… One moment she was on the ground, the next she was standing. But the way she stood… the way she carried herself, it wasn’t…

&#x200B;

It wasn’t Risa.

&#x200B;

Her hair seemed darker and her skin paler. She studied the crowd assembled before her. Blood still stained her mouth and ran down the front of her outfit… and after a moment her lips curled into a rictus grin that didn’t seem… natural. This looked less like a grin and more like a baring of teeth.

&#x200B;

Then she moved. With blinding speed, she moved, carrying both the grace of a dancer and the savagery of an animal. The first man she killed didn’t have time to react before she sank her teeth into his neck. 

&#x200B;

I heard screams of panic. I saw people struggle to get out of the way, but Risa was already on the move.

&#x200B;

She…

&#x200B;

She didn’t move like a human anymore.

&#x200B;

She didn’t even move like an animal.

&#x200B;

She moved in some… some mad dance, thrashing, ripping people limb from limb as if they were but paper. And as she destroyed them, Kazuma could do nothing but stand on the stage beside me and watch as flesh was rended from bone.

&#x200B;

I could see Jake, the Marvelous Host trying to run. He tried to get to the door, but didn’t make it far. Risa seemed to see him from the corner of her eye and just… just appeared in front of him. I watched as she reached out and just… just took him apart. Pried him open like a candy bar wrapper, causing flesh to split off of bone. Jake wasn’t even given the chance to scream. His look of terror and disbelief was frozen on his face as his top half was thrown onto a nearby table. I could still see life in his eyes, as if he hadn’t yet realized that he was dead and then it was gone.

&#x200B;

Beside me, Kazuma stumbled back, eyes wide at the carnage in front of him.

&#x200B;

He watched as Risa slaughtered all of them… every single person in that crowd. He watched as she tore them into strips of meat.

&#x200B;

*It took her minutes.*

&#x200B;

*Minutes.*

&#x200B;

I watched him stumble back, trying to will his body to run… and it seemed that as soon as he did, Risa noticed him. She barely even moved.

&#x200B;

I just… blinked…

&#x200B;

I blinked and she was right there in front of Kazuma, her hands drenched red with blood and her unblinking eyes settled on him. He held the knife in front of him, a meek defense in the face of this madness he could not comprehend… and Risa simply walked into it, letting him bury the knife in her heart without so much as flinching.

&#x200B;

Kazuma’s eyes widened. He let out a terrified croak as he looked at her, only barely able to ask the question on his mind.

  *“What…?”*

  ***“Izamono…”*** Risa replied.

I don’t think the word held meaning to him… but I understood it.

&#x200B;

*Izamono.*

&#x200B;

Those who believed Risa had been possessed in her youth knew that name well. It was the name she’d spoken during the ritual to drive the demon from her body. The name of the demon they said possessed her.

&#x200B;

Kazuma tried to utter one more word… but Risa did not grant him such a privilege. She reached out, seizing him by the throat and I watched as she… she pulled him apart, stripping the meat from his bones as if he’d been sitting in a slow cooker all day.

&#x200B;

Kazuma didn’t even get the chance to scream. 

&#x200B;

One moment, he was alive.

&#x200B;

The next… he was a pile of meat and bone she’d shredded with her bare hands. Risa… or the thing in Risa’s body stood over him. She stared down at him and for a moment, I saw a slight smile appear on her lips.

&#x200B;

Her head shifted slightly as her eyes fixated on me and I felt my heart stop in my chest.

  “Go, Hisako…”

&#x200B;

The voice she spoke in was her own and for a moment, I knew that it was Risa speaking to me… not whatever else was inside of her.

  “Risa…” I said softly, my voice trembling. I wanted to tell her to come with me but I couldn’t find the words.

  “Go…” She said again

&#x200B;

This time, I didn’t hold back.

&#x200B;

I ran.

No one stopped me.

No one was alive to.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

They say that Kazuma Yokoyama, along with just about everyone else who’d been at that penthouse died in a tragic fire. And while it’s true that there was a fire started that night… I know it’s not what killed Kazuma… or anyone else for that matter.

&#x200B;

No.

&#x200B;

Whoever started that fire did so to try and cover up the indescribable mess left by Risa’s… or… whatever was inside of Risa… *Izamono*, as it called itself. They wanted to erase the mountain of corpses she left behind. I suspect Merrymaker is to blame, although really I can’t blame them for trying to cover up what happened that night.

&#x200B;

What happened that night defies explanation and try as I might I still can’t fit all the pieces together. I know that Kazuma killed Risa that night… and I know that something inside her wouldn’t let her die. I’m not sure if it came out on its own, if she let it out or perhaps if some kind of bargain was struck. Only Risa could answer that. But I know that it saved her.

&#x200B;

It saved me.

&#x200B;

Mischief Maids has been put on a hiatus. Risa and I are no longer members.  I won’t miss it. 

&#x200B;

Actually… I don’t think anyone knows where Risa is.

&#x200B;

I personally haven’t heard from her and I’m not sure if I ever will again. I only know that she’s not dead. Despite everything… I take some comfort in that. And maybe someday, I’ll see her again.

&#x200B;

I hope I do.
