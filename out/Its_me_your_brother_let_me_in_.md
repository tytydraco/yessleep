I’ve posted pretty recently, talking about the home I grew up in, which was haunted. Living there, I experienced night terrors and nightmares, as well as reoccurring sleep paralysis (two total different beasts). However, I am going to share two of my nightmares on this post, some of the more scarier ones I have ever experienced.

The first one:
How it started - Myself, my mom, and my sister were downstairs talking… the sun was shining in through our living room window. My mom and sister told me they were going to go shopping and asked if I wanted to come, I responded no thank you. As soon as they left, it suddenly got pitch black outside. 

However, the inside of the house was pretty lit up from all the lights on. I looked at the large living room window (which for some reason had no screen on it), and realized how creepy it was to have open when it was so pitch black outside. The window leads to the side of our home which is secluded in its own area.

I go to shut the window when something suddenly makes it hard to push. That’s when I hear the terrifying/disgusting high pitched man’s voice. “It’s me, your brother, let me in.” I looked down to where the voice was coming from, and see a deformed white hand placed at the bottom of the window, holding it open. I knew of course it wasn’t my brother, even in my nightmare I knew he lived 8 hours away. 

I didn’t respond to the voice, I just kept pushing to close the window, against the impossibly strong hand. All the while the voice kept asking me to let it in, and ask why I’m scared, it’s just my brother. I finally got the window shut and quickly locked it. I ran upstairs as fast as I could and locked myself in my mom’s room, putting myself in a cradling position on the floor. While this was happening, I heard the sound of loud foot steps slowly coming up the staircase, and up to the room. I stared at the door, waiting for it to be pushed open. 

Suddenly, the footsteps stop right outside of the door and the door knob stars jiggling. Right as it was about to open, I woke up. I was sweating and could barely breathe. Horrible nightmare that has stuck with me for YEARS. Seriously, this nightmare happened in my teens and I’m in my 30’s now!

The second one:
I have to preface this one for it to make sense. Growing up, we lived in a poorer area and my mom was able to get my sister and I into a nicer school district, which was two towns away. During my 8th grade year, I essentially lived with my best friend (we’ll call her Naomi), and her mom & step dad. We’ll call her mom “Malia.” I was extremely close to Malia, and at the time, I had no idea what she was going through health wise. 

One night Malia allowed us to have our first co-ed sleep over with one exception, she had to sleep out in the living room with us. 

I remember sleeping when I suddenly woke up to Malia patting me awake. She then whispered to me and told me thank you for being such a good friend to her daughter, and she hopes I always look out for her. In hindsight, Malia was clearly drunk. She began to explain to me that she was a young mother, and Naomi’s father had raped her and was abusive towards her, and she hopes neither Naomi or myself ever have to experience that. 

All the while, I kept my eyes closed and pretended to still be asleep. Several weeks later, I had chosen to stay at my own house one Sunday night and upon going to school the next morning, Naomi wasn’t there. This might not sound odd, but trust me, it was. If either myself or Naomi were ever going to miss school, we immediately called each other and the other would stay home. 

I tried calling her hundreds of times, but got no answer. That’s when the office called me in, they told me they’re so sorry for my loss. This was a very small school, where everyone knew everyone’s family. I had no idea what they were talking about. I said what loss? I think they thought I was in some sort of denial. One of my other friends came up to me crying and gave me a hug. I asked again, what’s wrong?? She then explained Malia had passed away the night before. 

I was just frozen, in shock. This had to be a lie. No way? I called Naomi over and over, no answer. I go home so confused and in disbelief. I get a call from a random number, it was Naomi. She sounded extra cheery and said, “Hey, so sorry I couldn’t talk. I live with my dad now. What you heard about my mom is true. Don’t worry, I’m fine! You don’t need to call.” She hung up. That was it. No further explaining. 

Several nights later, I had a nightmare that I was downstairs when suddenly the walls started vibrating and our home phone upstairs starting ringing. I remember walking up the stairs while everything was still vibrating, and my mom’s room where the home phone was looked like static, I’m not sure how else to describe it. Almost slowly I walked to the house phone and the floor began vibrating, I got to the house phone and picked it up. “Hello?” I said. It was quiet for a moment, I could only hear static. 

Then I heard her. “(My name), it’s me. It’s me, Malia. I don’t have long, please, please listen. Tell Naomi I love her. Tell her don’t be sad. Tell her to move on. Please tell her.” I tried to respond, and where she was coming from sounded dark. She sounded like she was somewhere terrifying. I tried to continue talking and she said she had to go. I woke up. I wanted to tell Naomi about it, (I obviously wasn’t going to tell her about the scary aspect, just that her mom wanted me to pass a message. 

She said she doesn’t want to know, and please don’t share it. She was grieving. After the school year ended (this all happened in April), she moved to a different town and never talked to any one who knew her mom ever again. I tried reaching out to her years later, to explain her mom’s message, but she again told me to leave her alone and she wants that part of her life in the past. We all respond differently to loss, I get it. However, that dream has stuck with me. 

What’s a nightmare you can recall?
