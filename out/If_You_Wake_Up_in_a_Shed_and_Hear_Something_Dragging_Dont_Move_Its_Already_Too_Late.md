Part 1: [If You Wake Up and Hear Dripping, Don’t Look Up....](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q2zop2/if_you_wake_up_and_hear_dripping_dont_look_up/)

Blood was spreading across the floor, and I couldn’t decide if I should stay calm and figure out how to get out—or just dive straight into full-blown panic mode. Just as I leaned toward panic, the phone buzzed in my hand. And then… went black.

What?

I stared at the screen.

Nothing.

“No, no, no,” I whispered. “Was that it? One post and you’re done with me?”

Before I could shake it or threaten it with violence, Trust Issues doubled over beside me and started puking onto the concrete like his body was trying to evacuate the premises without him.

“Is that—?” he gagged.

“Yeah, it’s blood. Keep up, genius.” I yanked him upright just as a dragging sound echoed behind us. 

I turned towards the corner where the noise was coming from. SHIT

“We need to move,” I hissed, pulling him behind a massive pillar away from the blood pool.

“Move? I’m barely standing!” he whispered back, clutching his stomach.

“Congratulations,” I muttered, hauling him with me. “You’re standing and moving.”

We stumbled behind one of the massive pillars, barely glancing back. There wasn’t time to think—only hide. The dragging sound crept closer, each scrape sending a shiver straight up my spine.

Trust Issues was still retching, wobbling like a newborn deer that had already accepted it wasn’t surviving winter.

I peek around the pillar, just enough to catch a glimpse of the source of the dragging noise. It’s a person—or at least, I think it is. It’s the kind of sight you’d expect in a horror movie, right before the creepy music kicks in. Only, I don’t hear any music. 

“What the hell is that?” Mr. Trust Issues whispered, his voice shaking.

“Shut up,” I snapped with just the sound of my pulse pounding in my ears. I try to make as little noise as possible, but it’s hard when every creak of the floor and every gasp from Trust Issues sounds like a thunderclap in the silence. 

The shape is humanoid, but everything about it feels off. I see two ears, but the rest is a blur. A man? A woman? It’s hard to tell. They're wearing a bunny costume, but not the cute, fluffy kind. No, this is something else—more like lingerie, skintight, the kind of outfit that makes you feel like you've crossed into a nightmare rather than a party. It’s too much, too unsettling. The legs were too long. Too thin.

Not human.

The hair on my neck stood straight up. Is this what they call the Uncanny valley effect?

The thing it was dragging finally came into view.

A hogtied body, it was a female. “Oh god,” Trust Issues whispered. “Please tell me she’s alive.”

I didn’t answer.

Her limp body and the blood trail said enough.

Then, the figure stopped. His head snapped down to the bloody mess we’d left behind. That's when it suddenly dawned on me. The footprints on the floor? Real subtle. He whips his head toward us. My stomach drops as he turns, scanning the room with hawk-like precision. 

“Great,” I mutter. “He knows we’re here.”

But before I could think of a plan, Trust Issues shoves me.  And in all his glory, sprints for the other side like he’s got a gold medal to win. 

“What the—? You coward!” I hissed, scrambling to keep hidden.

The bunny man’s head whips toward the sound of his footsteps. Perfect. Just perfect. I’m dead. I make eye contact with the bunny man. He looks at me, and for a split second and I think maybe, just maybe, he’ll not notice me. Nope. Instead, he lets go of the rope and starts beelining towards me. Should I talk? Beg? Ask for a chance? If this isn’t human—if it’s a thing—maybe it understands deals.

That’s when it clicks.

*The sheep. Blood streaking the beams above. Symbols carved deep and deliberate. This wasn’t just violence.*

*It was a ritual.*

*To summon him. Or worse, to become him.*

But then, right when he’s six inches away from me, this man or creature does a full 90-degree turn, like he’s in some kind of action movie, and sprints straight toward Mr. Trust Issues instead.

What. The. Hell.

For a moment, my brain just shuts down because, seriously, why? I mean, I was literally *this close* to becoming his next victim, and then—bam!—he decides my so-called ally is the better target. What kind of twisted plot twist is this? Why did he change his mind? 

I don’t know what was more confusing—Trust Issues sprinting like his life depended on it or the fact that Trust Issues was actually running faster than I’ve ever seen anyone run in my life. I mean, props to him. Guess all those years of being paranoid finally paid off.

And as if all this wasn’t enough to throw me into a mental breakdown, the hogtied girl, who I had previously thought was dead, suddenly comes back to life and starts screaming like a banshee on a Gatorade overdose. 

So, naturally, I, being the upstanding citizen that I am (unlike someone), decide to make my way over to the girl. Now, I don’t know if I’ve mentioned this before, but I’m not exactly an expert in escape artistry. And freeing someone from ropes while they're screaming like they’ve been possessed by a circus clown is not exactly what I’d call an easy task. 

I looked around to find anything to cut the ropes, and that's when I spotted it. A nail. A huge one. Almost the size of my hand, sticking out of the pillar that was about to be my tomb a few seconds ago. I pluck it out and use it to slice through her ropes. As soon as the ropes were off her she fell still. “Hey… are you okay?” I whispered, turning her around. Her eyes were locked on me—unblinking, empty. Then, like some cracked carnival psychic had taken over her mouth, she spoke:

*"****Blood teaches the lepus to listen.***

***It does not see bodies.***

***It sees absence.***

***Where something was***

***and is no longer—***

***there it goes****"*

Then came a garbled stream of nonsense, syllables that made no sense but carried a weight of warning. Yeah… she’d completely lost it.

“What… what does that mean? Lepus?” I shake her, desperate for answers, but she doesn’t even look at me. She starts dragging herself toward the sheep.

Yeah. *That* sheep—the one whose body looked like it had been run through a blender. She reaches it and… eats. Not carefully, not even chewing. She’s shoving fistfuls into her mouth, devouring it like she hasn’t eaten in days. Maybe longer.

I hadn’t been puking before. That changed fast.

My stomach lurches violently. I double over, heaving onto the floor, each retch clawing at me from the inside out.

And just when I think it can’t get worse… I see him. Mr. Trust Issues. Sprinting toward me like it’s the final leg of an Olympic relay, every chaotic step driven by sheer panic.

“Move!” he shouts, his voice frantic, like he expects me to just part like the Red Sea.

I don’t budge. “What the hell are you doing?” I snap, trying to keep my voice steady. “Where’s Bunny Man?”

“Gone!” he pants, wide-eyed. “But he’s coming back. I swear, he was right behind me!”

Now, I knew this guy was being chased, but here’s the weird part: I couldn’t see Bunny Man anywhere behind him. It’s like the guy just vanished into thin air. The only light in this godforsaken shed is coming from a grimy window, casting enough moonlight to make everything look like it’s straight out of a noir film.

Still, I’m not sticking around to see if Bunny Man plans a grand reentrance. I bolt the other way—but of course, Mr. Trust Issues has legs made of pure muscle and zero sense. It’s like he won the genetic lottery, and I’m just a caffeinated squirrel trying to keep up. Short legs, bad timing—he’s like a wind-up toy with a head start, and I’m losing the race. In seconds, he’s already catching up to me, panic propelling every insane stride.

“Stop following me!” I yell, dodging a rusty tool bench.

“I thought—” he wheezes, glancing back at me. “I thought you were with him!”

I nearly trip over my own feet. “What?”

“You—you looked calm! Like you knew what was going on!”

I shot him a look so sharp it could cut steel. I mean, I knew this guy wasn’t exactly winning any IQ contests, but this? This is next-level stupidity. Did he honestly think he could just pull an excuse out of his ass and I’d go, "Oh, okay, cool, no worries, bro"

“You thought I was what? On his side? Oh, I see. Men will believe aliens built the pyramids before they believe a woman who says she didn’t kidnap them!”

His jaw works soundlessly like he’s trying to come up with a defense. 

But before he could even respond with his excuses, Bunny Man decides that now is the perfect time to make his dramatic entrance. And not from behind, like any normal killer would do, but right in front of us. He comes straight at us with a saw, I guess his little break wasn’t for tea but a quick trip to his murder tool shed.

“Run!” I shout, grabbing Mr. Trust Issues’ arm and yanking him backward.

Too late. He sprinted right into us, raising the saw dramatically, like he’d just been cast in a low-budget ’90s ninja movie, ready to slice us in one swift motion. But, lucky for me, my foot hits a slick patch of blood and I go down hard. The saw comes swinging, its teeth skimming so close to my head I feel the tug as it takes a chunk of my hair. Mr. Trust Issues, on the other hand? Not so lucky. Yep, that’s the end of our dear “ally.” Although, considering he betrayed me earlier, “ally” might be a bit generous.

Did he—did he really just get sliced in half by a saw? Yes.

Did I watch it happen? Also yes.

I faceplanted on the concrete. Maybe that’s what snapped my brain back into gear, because suddenly I remembered the insane woman’s words:

“***Blood teaches the lepus to listen.***

***It does not see bodies.***

***It sees absence.***

***Where something was***

***and is no longer—***

***there it goes***”

*It only kills if you run. Only if you run.*

Oh my God. How could I be such an idiot?

I stayed flat on the floor. Motionless. Heart hammering like a jackhammer in my chest. Nausea twisting my guts. I still had the iron nail. Still.

I turned.

I still had the iron nail from rescuing the woman. I turned toward Bunny Man—or Lepus, but Bunny Man sounded less terrifying.

He grabbed the upper half of Trust Issue's sawed-off body and tossed it aside like it was a ragdoll. And his eyes… they locked on mine.

I froze.

He charged.

I didn’t move. I couldn’t. I stayed flat. Motionless. Counting on her words.

He leaned closer. Closer. My leg—snatched.

No. No, no, no, no, no.

I was lifted upside down. Saw roaring. Inches from my face. Teeth glinting. Smell of blood and metal hitting me like a brick.

Instinct. Nail. Neck.

I jammed it in. Blood spurted everywhere. Animalistic shrieks tore through the shed.

I hit the ground again, face-first.

And then I was on my feet, snapping into action. I grabbed the discarded chainsaw. One swing. His head… gone.

Silence.

Well… almost.

All that cut through the silence was my ragged breathing and the metallic groan of the chainsaw, still running like it had a life of its own.

Then my phone buzzed. Battery is still a 100%.

It wants me to post. To Reddit.

I’ve been writing for over an hour now—through three mental breakdowns, two puke sessions, and enough panic to sho

Wait.

I just heard a ding. An elevator?

Maybe… maybe that’s it. A way out.

I… I don’t know if I can reach it. But I have to try.

Wish me luck.
