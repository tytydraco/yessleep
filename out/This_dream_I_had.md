I had this dream which I chose to write out in the form of a short story. The places are real but the people’s names have been changed. The people I meet in the dream aside from the strange man are all my childhood best friends. None of whom I have any contact with today. Anyone willing to share their interpretations can. But it haunted me.

I was forced out of the house without knowing why. No argument, no fire, no storm—just an unspoken rule that I could not stay. So I walked.

The streets stretched and rearranged themselves until I realized I was no longer where I’d begun. The air had the thin, brittle dryness of Colorado, and when I saw the familiar slope of the land, my stomach sank.

Highlands Ranch.

My feet carried me to Big Dry Creek Park, the place where childhood afternoons once disappeared into dirt and daylight. The ditch was there, though I didn’t look at it. Some things are better left unexamined.

Near the open field stood a piano—black, upright, absurdly pristine—its legs pressed into the dry grass as if it had grown there. A man sat at it, playing. The melody was simple, almost tender, but it pulled at something behind my ribs. Around him stood a small crowd, motionless, listening too closely.

One of them turned and saw me.

“Caleb,” he said, smiling wide. “Long time. Come join us.”

His voice carried the confidence of familiarity, but I didn’t know his face. Still, my feet betrayed me. I stepped into the circle.

“It’s been a while,” he continued, eyes never leaving mine. “I hope you’re doing well.”

“I’m not,” I said.

His smile deepened. “I know.”

He pointed past me.

A man approached—my age now, but unmistakable. “Luke,” the stranger said gently. “Go catch up.”

Luke grinned when he saw me, the way he used to. We laughed, exchanged pieces of our lives like old coins. The piano’s tempo crept faster. Without deciding to, we began to dance. Frantically.

Another friend joined us, then another, then another. Each arrival was met with chanting, our voices folding over each other, names shouted in rhythm with the keys.

“Marcus! Marcus!”

“Eli! Eli!”

The crowd grew. The music sharpened. The dance became something closer to a convulsion.

Then one of them—Eli, I think—froze and pointed into the distance.

“Look,” he said. “It’s Jonah.”

I turned, heart lifting. “Jonah!” I shouted. “Jonah!”

He heard me. He started toward us.

Halfway there, the light caught his face.

Something was terribly wrong.

His skin was gray, stretched too thin. Pale patches bloomed across his scalp where hair had fallen out in clumps. His eyes were sunken, frantic, already pleading.

The chanting swelled.

“Jonah! Jonah! Jonah!”

He broke.

Jonah screamed—a raw, animal sound—and bolted away from us, stumbling, sobbing, fleeing as if the ground itself were burning him. The music didn’t follow him. It didn’t need to.

I stopped dancing.

Luke leaned close, his voice flat. “He’s never been the same.”

The piano struck one final chord.

Silence.

The crowd dissolved like breath in cold air. Luke was gone. The park emptied. The sky felt suddenly much too close.

Only the stranger remained.

He was no longer standing.

He sat atop the piano now, legs dangling, fingers resting on the closed lid. He looked at me and smiled—but the smile pulled sideways, stretched, folded in on itself. His face warped, revealing something old and hungry beneath the shape of a man.

Now I understood.

He laughed.

And I woke up.
