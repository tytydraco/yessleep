My daughter is 22 now and I am so guilty for the way I treated her. Her dad left us when she was a baby, and as a young mom in her 20’s I didn’t want or have the ability to care for her the way I should have. 

I used to leave her in the living room at night time while she was a baby while I would have sex with men. I would smack her as a toddler and pull her hair. I let one of my ex boyfriends bring his dog over even tho she would get asthma attacks and break out in hives. She had to go to the hospital, but after I still let him come over with the dog because I wanted the company. I didn’t do anything when my other ex boyfriend grabbed her arm a few times. I would scream and yell at her at 2 years old and leave her in a dark hallway at night until she banged on the front door for her grandmother in fear. 

As she got older, I ended up treating her worse. I would pull her hair so hard, her head would have a lump. I would monitor how often she showered , and I would hide most of the food in my bedroom closet. I would yell and scream at her for sneaking food. I didn’t let her use any appliances. I wouldn’t let her shower whenever she pleased. And would only let her bathe for a few min. I let my mother buy her what she needed like bras. Soap. Personal items. I wasn’t made to be a mother. I neglected her. I let her have lice in her hair and didn’t help her. The bugs were crawling all over her face. I made her sleep and eat on the floor so she wouldn’t mess up the furniture. She would say how bad her back hurt but I didn’t care. 

I told her about my sex life. Shook my boobs and danced provocatively as a joke because I am a nymphomanic. She’s seen porn on my computer. Disgusting messages. I told her things I shouldn’t have. Like the number of sexual partners, what I did in college, dick sizes.  

She had a rabbit and I didn’t let her take it out of her cage. I have OCD and didn’t want it to make a mess everywhere. Over time, I wouldn’t let her put it in her room so I put the rabbit in a dark laundry room and removed the lamp so it sat in darkness 24:7. I didn’t want to pay for the light bill. She had to beg my mom to get it food. Then I killed it by accident because it was so dirty from its filth, I gave it a bath with a hose and it had a seizure and died. I didn’t know rabbits would die from being wet. I remember her screaming and yelling and I was too busy fighting with my boyfriend at the time. 

I would tell her disgusting things. Call her fat. Say she had a balloon face. A loser. Tell her “that’s why you have no friends at school “ “that’s why your dad left you” I also told her I wish I never fucked her dad. She was between 8-12. 


One time, when I was having a stressful day, she was always defiant. And put a chocolate bar in my thanksgiving turkey. I was so angry I took mayonnaise and shoved it in her face. Up her nose. Down her throat. Until she threw up and cried. She always had a sensitivity with mayonnaise since she was a toddler, and I would sometimes use it to threaten her as punishment. Now she eats like a child, and has a fear of foods. 

When she ended up cutting herself, I didn’t get her help. I didn’t let her see a doctor when she had strep throat , and she almost died of an asthma attack because I was too tired to be bothered in the middle of the night. I told her to call the ambulance herself. But then followed her to the hospital. 

I didn’t let her get a license or a permit or a bank account because I didn’t want to be responsible for her reckless behavior. 

She ended up getting sexually abused @ 14 by her music teacher who’s 23. She told me they just kissed. So I messaged him and told him to stop talking to her. He didn’t. And I found out recently it was way more than what she told me. I broke down in tears from the guilt. 

Once she was about 15-16 she was running away and drinking and I just gave up on her and counted the days until she was 18 so she wasn’t my responsibility anymore. She felt the same. 

I told her to go live with another family member when she was 17. All she did was smoke weed and not listen or follow my rules. I have heard from her maybe 3 times

I love my daughter. I feel guilty but she never wants to speak to me again. I thought since I never sexually abused her or beat her until she had bruises, it wasn’t abuse. I made mistakes. She now struggles with substance abuse issues. But Is a kind and empathetic person. She’d give the shirt off her back for anybody. She was just so hyper and bratty. And a hard kid. Maybe because of her ADHD. And I never wanted to be a mother.
