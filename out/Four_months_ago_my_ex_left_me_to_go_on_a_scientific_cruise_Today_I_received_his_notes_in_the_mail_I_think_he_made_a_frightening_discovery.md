The journal arrived on my doorstep in perfect condition. It was inside a beaten-up USPS envelope with no return address on it. I almost didn’t open it. All that was on it was my name, scribbled messily as if the writer had been in a hurry. No address, no stamps, no shipping label, nothing. The bottom left corner of the envelope was torn, as if someone had tried to take a bite out of it. 

I picked it up carefully, slightly grossed out by the condition of the envelope. I looked around, hoping to spot someone running away after leaving it on my porch, but saw nothing except for a group of pigeons that were picking at a spilled bag of Cheetos that the neighbor’s kid had dropped on the side of the road that afternoon. 

I took the envelope inside with me, shutting and locking the door behind me. I felt around the envelope, and could tell that there was a book inside it. Even more confused, I ripped open the package and looked inside to find a brown leather-bound journal. It looked new, but I could tell it had been opened and written in due to the way the cover bulged out slightly, probably caused by the writer creasing the spine and folding the pages over. 

I tossed the envelope in the trash and set the journal down on my kitchen table. There were no identifying details on the journal; no seal, writing, or anything engraved on the front or back covers. I untied the piece of string that held it shut and opened the journal to the first page. I recognized the writing immediately. It belonged to a recent ex of mine, Emil. 

We had broken up almost five months ago after being together for three years because he had decided to go on a year-long scientific cruise to study some bullshit in the ocean. I had never quite paid attention to the details, as I had been incredibly angry when he told me he was considering moving out of our shared home and postponing our engagement in order to live on a boat for a year. I wasn’t interested in hearing the details of the life that he was choosing over me. 

I stared at the journal entry, not reading it, just simply scanning over the familiar writing. I wondered why he would send me this. He had to have had this delivered to my house (I still lived in the house he had moved out of, as I couldn’t afford to move), but why? If we was back, why not show up himself to see me or tell me whatever he clearly wanted me to read in his journal?

I angrily shut the journal and stuck it in my junk drawer with all the loose batteries and random business cards and takeout menus I had collected over my time living here, slamming the drawer shut as the junk rattled inside. 

I wasn’t fully over Amir yet, and I was enraged that he had not only left me to live on a boat, but then had the nerve to send me his stupid journal instead of confronting me in person after his return. I wished I could send him a petty text or leave him an angry, drunk voicemail, but unfortunately, past me had made a good decision when she completely deleted his contact information, and I had quickly forgotten about it. As much as I tried to remember the phone number that I used to know by heart, I couldn’t. Did it end in 5634? Or was it 5635? Did he even have the same number anymore? He wouldn’t have been able to pay it anyway, and it wasn’t like he would have cell reception in the middle of the ocean. He had told me himself that he wouldn’t be able to contact me at all during his time at sea. On top of that, he had never been a big social media enjoyer, so there wasn’t even an online profile to stalk. 

An hour later, I found myself staring at the journal again. I had poured myself a glass of red wine and took a deep breath before opening it up again. 

*January 1, 2025*

*It’s a new year, and I didn’t celebrate it. I spent the holiday alone in Caleb’s basement while he went out to party with his boyfriend Omar. They had invited me to come with, but I declined. I don’t wish I had gone, but I do wish I hadn’t spent the night alone. Celeste and I would have made a huge meal and watched the ball drop on the TV before falling asleep in the living room together, just like we did every year. I don’t really want to think about that right now.* 

*I’m waiting for all the stuff to be put on the boat now. It’s huge; much bigger than I had expected, and there are ten other members on board. I’m the only one without any sailing experience. They can’t stop talking about all the things we’re going to experience at sea, and all the discoveries they hope to make. To be honest, I haven’t been paying attention to them. I just nod and agree with whatever they’re excited about, but I’m here to study something else.* 

*I’m here to prove the existence of a powerful being, one that is said to be trapped within the glaciers of the Antarctic Ocean. Of course, saying this to a bunch of scientists would get me laughed off the ship, so I’m hoping they won’t catch on to the fact that I know nothing about oceanography, or marine biology, or whatever else these people got their prestigious degrees in. Who am I kidding, though? They’ll probably have me all figured out by tomorrow morning. At least then it’ll be too late to kick me off the trip.* 

I stared at the page after I finished reading it, even angrier than I had been when Amir told me about his plan to live on a boat for a year. Not only did he leave me, but he left me to study something that didn’t even exist. 

I drank my entire glass of wine in three gulps and then flipped through some of the pages until I found another interesting entry. 

*January 3, 2025*

*Well, it took them longer than I thought to catch on to the fact that I was a fraud. They weren’t any less angry than I had imagined, though. A few of them complained; apparently, I had taken a spot from someone who actually deserved to be here. The atmosphere on the boat has gotten hostile, though we are almost at our location where we will anchor and stay for a few days.* 

*I’ve been getting nasty looks from everyone all day, and no one will speak to me. It’s alright though, once everyone gets busy, I’m sure they’ll forget about me. And besides, being left alone will allow me to submerge myself fully in my research.* 



I rolled my eyes as I stopped reading. It was laughable that he was referring to his belief in an urban legend as “research.” I skipped through a few more pages. 

*January 7, 2025*

*It’s started. Weird things are happening. One of the scientists on board, Freejan, they call him, tried to jump into the ocean. It took three guys to stop him, and even then, they got seriously injured. It got so bad that they finally spoke to me to ask for my help.* 

*We had to strap Freejan to a cot in a small room on the ship. He kept trying to escape for hours, groaning as he attempted to break free from his binds. I think this is proof of my theory. We must be close to it. It must be within a few miles of us.* 

*The guys that Freejan injured have been complaining, saying we should dock somewhere so they can figure out what happened to Freejan. One of them thinks he might have eaten something expired, but I don’t think any type of expired food does that. I haven’t said anything about my theory; I don’t want them to think I’ve gone insane and strap me down next to Freejan.* 

I took a sip of my wine. Amir’s writing on this page was messier, a bit harder to read. Every p looked like an o, and every g looked like a q. I could tell it was written in a hurry, like he didn’t want to forget a detail, or like he didn’t want to be caught writing. I scanned the next few pages. 

*January 9, 2025*

*Freejan died today. I think it was in the morning, just before sunrise. I was awake about an hour before that, I could hear him groaning and pulling against his restraints, causing the cot to bang and rattle on the ground, producing a rhythmic thudding noise throughout that area of the ship.* 

*Jacob found him when he went down to try and feed him breakfast. He hadn’t eaten or drank anything since the day he attempted to throw himself overboard, but he didn’t look dehydrated or malnourished at all. Maybe it hadn’t been long enough. I’m not sure how long it would take for someone to die of starvation and dehydration. Maybe it was exhaustion, though. He hadn’t stopped trying to free himself for even a second since we strapped him down.* 

*Someone put the body on ice and locked it in some sort of makeshift coffin. Apparently, we were prepared for something like this. No one seems to care that Freejan is dead. I know we’re all strangers to each other, but it seems callous. They all went right back to their work, as if there wasn’t a body decomposing on the ship somewhere.* 

*It’s the middle of the night now. That’s the only time I can write freely without worrying that someone will find me and get angry with me all over again. I swear I can still hear the thumping of Freejan trying to get out of the ropes.* 



*January 12, 2025*

*The influence is getting stronger. I’ve been having debilitating headaches, on and off, over the last twenty-four hours. Yesterday, Josie, one of the scientists on board, spent seven hours staring at the same point in the sea, unmoving. She didn’t react when they tried to move her away from the edge of the ship, or when they dragged her toward a chair so they could sit her down and speak to her.* 

*She didn’t talk back, didn’t even acknowledge that people kept coming up to her and talking to her, asking her things. The creepiest thing, and the thing that I don’t think anyone else noticed, was the fact that she didn’t blink. Not once. I watched her at one point, from a distance, while I ate my lunch. I stared at her as she stared out at something no one else could see, and I never saw her blink.* 

*After the seven hours, she simply turned around and walked to her sleeping area, and we didn’t see her again for the rest of the day. She was checked on periodically and seemed to be sleeping.* 

*I think we’re running out of time. We need to leave this area before things get worse, before the effect grows stronger. I’m almost sure that this thing is almost free. It gets stronger and bolder each passing day. It might have to due with the melting glaciers. The more they melt, the freer it gets.* 



*January 17, 2025*

*We were supposed to move two days ago, but someone sabotaged the ship. No one knows who it was, and everyone is claiming their innocence. Josie is the number one suspect now, and people seem to have forgotten that they were upset with me, which I suppose is a plus.* 

*We’ve tried calling for help, but there’s no one around to hear us. Even if there was, I don’t think that thing would let the help arrive. The waters around us have turned an unnatural shade of red, like we’re floating in a pool of blood. Some of the scientists have taken samples of the water to test them. We’re still waiting on some of the results.* 

*Some people claim the water smells metallic, like blood, while others claim it smells like burnt sugar. I can’t smell either of those things. What I smell is death.* 

*Everyone is avoiding Josie, but I don’t think she notices anymore. I’ve caught her looking over the side of the ship, down into the red-stained waters, her neck bent forward, her back slouched, and her hair falling over her face.* 

*I think she sees something, but I’m scared to ask her what it is.* 



*January 17, 2025 (continued)*

*Josie climbed up to the highest point on the ship and jumped. She took a running start before she leapt, jumping in the direction of the water. I heard gasps and turned when she had already taken off.* 

*We all watched in silence and confusion as she soared through the air. It felt like hours passed as she pushed through the sky before starting to fall downward.* 

*She miscalculated her jump and hit the side of the boat, her body making a sickening clanging sound as it hit the railing near the front. I watched as her body collided with the railing, immediately splattering it with blood as she flopped onto the deck, her head hitting it with a sickening crack that echoed throughout the boat. Someone screamed, someone else gagged. Others, including me, ran toward her body.* 

*Up close, there was a lot more blood. I watched it seep from her head. I could see that her body was contorted at an odd angle due to where it had hit the railing. Her blood dripped down the railing and onto the deck.* 

*Someone noted that she was still alive. And somehow, she was.* 

*Her eyes were looking around, as if she were confused as to what had just happened. No one said anything, and she started sputtering, blood spraying out of her mouth now. A few people backed up, and someone vomited over the side of the ship.* 

*Someone asked what we should do, but nobody answered. We did nothing, and we waited for her to die, but she wouldn’t.* 

*We waited until the sun set and the night turned cold, and she was still lying there, spitting up blood and gasping for air. It was terrible to listen to.* 

*Finally, CJ came out and grabbed her body harshly, tossing it over the side of the boat where it bounced off before splashing into the waters below.* 

*I helped him clean the blood off the deck as the others watched in silence. I could hear someone praying as she scrubbed the deck down, and I couldn’t help thinking about how that wasn’t going to help us.*



I wondered if Amir was lying. Maybe he had made all of this up and sent it to me because he regretted dumping me. Perhaps he was trying to create a sob story so that I would feel bad for him and take him back after reading about all the horrible things that he went through, all the things he was put through for giving me up. 

The worst part was that it would work. If this was his way of getting me to forgive him, of going back to the way things were before, it was working. Even though a big part of me was sure this was a lie, I knew that ultimately, that wouldn’t matter. 

Even if it was all lies, I couldn’t help but be freaked out by the contents of the journal. He seemed too… calm. Shouldn’t he have been more freaked out? I know I would have been. Still, I couldn’t stop picturing Josie’s body hitting the side of the boat and painfully bleeding out while everyone watched. What a truly terrible way to die. I wondered how long it had taken her to drown to death in the waters below. 

I wiped my sweaty palms on my pants and took a large sip of wine as I continued to flip through the journal pages. Some of them were painfully normal, listing what Amir had for breakfast, what he ate for lunch, and listing a random theory posed by one of the scientists on the boat.

Others were simply rants, his own ideas about this thing that he was so certain was lurking in the ocean, toying with them and attempting to pick them off one by one. It took a few entries before I found another interesting one: 

*January 23, 2025*

*From the boat, I see the coast,*

*But we will never reach it.*

*It’s in the air, it’s in our hair,* 

*And soon we’ll get to see it.*

*Jacob has been singing that all day long. We keep asking him what it is, why he’s singing it, and he claims he doesn’t know. He says he thinks it’s some type of nursery rhyme he might have heard as a child, says he spent a lot of time on boats, and his mom probably made it up, that he’s only remembering it now because he’s on a boat again.* 

*He doesn’t seem to be doing it on purpose. After he sings the short verse, he hums the tune over again until we stop him.* 

*Dum dee dum, dum dee dum,* 

*Da-dum, da-dum, dee, dum-dum*

*Dum dee dum, dum dee dum,* 

*Da-dum, da-dum, dee, dum-dum* 

*Over and over again. It’s starting to piss of CJ and Malik, specifically. They keep snapping at him, telling him to “shut the fuck up” and stop singing that “creepy ass song.” Jacob scoffs and apologizes, but minutes later, he’s doing it again.* 

*The three got into a heated argument a few minutes ago and split up, taking a break from their work. I can hear Jacob singing the song over and over, a few feet away. At night, it sounds a lot creepier.* 



*January 24, 2025*

*When I woke up this morning, there was commotion on the ship. Someone pointed to a coastline that was visible to the West of the boat.* 

*Someone else mentioned that there shouldn’t be a coastline, at least, not to the west, and that we hadn’t moved in days, and it hadn’t been there before.* 

*This led to an argument over whether or not anyone was still trying to radio for help, and someone claiming that they had made contact with someone last night, but we were still waiting for them to show up.* 

*I can see the coastline from the deck. It would take maybe an hour to get there. It looks like an island of sorts, not very big, with only one huge tree visible from the ship. It doesn’t seem like it would be a very good place to stop, as it doesn’t look like there would be anyone there to help us.* 

*The team is split about whether we should attempt to go or not. One man whose name I don’t remember states that he’s been working on fixing up the boats, that there was a slight issue with the engines that has almost been fixed. He says we can vote on it when he’s finished. Cj asked him why he hadn’t told us he was fixing up the ship sooner, and the man said he had tried, but we were all too busy fighting with each other to pay attention to him.* 

*I’m starting to realize that I didn’t learn everyone’s names. Maybe I should get on that.* 



*January 26, 2025*

*Malik tried to go fishing today and caught a two-headed fish. It became the topic of the day--- we are surrounded by scientists after all --- and nobody wanted to eat it anyway, so we spent the entire day staring at the mutated fish.* 

*I asked Malik what type of fish it was, and he said he didn’t know. I didn’t say that I thought he should know something like that, considering he was a marine biologist. He said it was unsettling and tossed it back overboard, where it floated, dead in the water.* 



*January 31, 2025*

*The ship got fixed. We were on the move for exactly 45 minutes before the engine failed again. We looked for the man who fixed it the first time, only he was nowhere to be found.* 

*We searched the entire boat. For hours. And we found nothing.* 

*There was collective confusion. We had all seen him, some of us had spoken to him, and we could all describe him exactly as we had seen him. And yet, he was gone, vanished into thin air. After some deliberation, we split up, each assigned to a different part of the boat*

*Dr. H and Miriam, who knew each other from a prior research project, excused themselves from the search, stating that they were still trying to figure out what had turned the surrounding waters red. They asked us to come back to them with any news if we found anything of substance.* 

*As I wandered through my assigned area of the ship, I realized something: there was an extra passenger. I flipped back to my very first entry to be one hundred percent sure, and I was. There was a total of eleven passengers on the ship on day one.*

*Amir (me)*

*Jacob*

*Josie (deceased)*

*CJ*

*Malik*

*Freejan (deceased)*

*Miriam*

*Dr. H*

*Trinn*

*Williams*

*Cooper*

*Eleven passengers, and none of them was the man we had seen earlier who had claimed to be fixing the engine. I ran back through the ship, looking for someone to tell.* 

*The first person I ran into was CJ, who attempted to blow me off until I listed all the names of the passengers to him. Then, he told me I was right, that man had not gotten on the boat with us, so where did he come from? And where had he gone?*

*We rounded everyone up again to tell them about my discovery. Just like with CJ, everyone thought I was crazy until I listed the names of all the passengers. Then, they suddenly realized that I was right; there had been an intruder on the boat, and he had somehow disappeared.* 

*Something is very wrong.*

*I’m starting to regret my choices. I’m sorry, Celeste. I should have stayed home. I should have married you instead.* 



I stared at the last sentence. I wanted to roll my eyes so badly. Of course he missed me after everything went to shit. That didn’t mean he truly missed me, though; he just wished he were anywhere else but on that boat. 

I flipped through the journal and realized that there were only three entries left. The rest of the journal was completely empty. 

The remaining journal entries had large gaps between them, and I could make very little sense of what was going on, as if Amir had been taking random notes down throughout the days without making sure they made any sense. 

*February 4, 2025*

*Blood is red is water. Thick and heavy.*

*Many mutant fish. More of them. Saw a shark. Wasn’t a shark.* 

*Dr. H and Miriam are bad. Figured out what was in water. Can’t tell us now. Notes say blood but they didn’t write them. Trinn and Cooper locked up in engine room. I can’t remember what they did. Forgot to write it down, but it was bad.* 

*It doesn’t want us to remember. Eleven people on the boat. Two dead, two locked up, two bad. Eleven people on the boat.* 

*Amir, Jacob,* *~~Josie~~**, CJ, Malik,* *~~Freejan~~**, Miriam, Dr. H, Trinn, Williams, Cooper.* 

*Amir, Jacob,* *~~Josie~~**, CJ, Malik,* *~~Freejan~~**, Miriam, Dr. H, Trinn, Williams, Cooper.* 

*Amir, Jacob,* *~~Josie~~**, CJ, Malik,* *~~Freejan~~**, Miriam, Dr. H, Trinn, Williams, Cooper.* 

*I need to write it all down.* 



*February 28, 2025*

*Dr. H and Miriam had to die. That’s what she said. I did it in the morning. She said it was morning but the sun doesn’t rise anymore. A good thing. So we don’t see the things in the waters. For protection.*

*Island getting closer. It moves too slow. She said it can’t go faster. Must be patient. She’s too deep in my head, sometimes I forget and I have her thoughts instead of my own. I keep getting confused. She’s tricking me. Must remember eleven people on the boat.* 

*Amir, Jacob,* *~~Josie~~**, CJ, Malik,* *~~Freejan~~**, Miriam, Dr. H, Trinn, Williams, Cooper.*

*Eleven, including me. Four dead now. Two locked up.*

*Amir, Jacob,* *~~Josie~~**, CJ, Malik,* *~~Freejan~~**,* *~~Miriam~~**,* *~~Dr. H~~**, Trinn, Williams, Cooper.* 

*Jacob won’t stop singing her favorite song.* 



*March 18, 2025*

*She says I can go home. She says she will let the sun rise again. I can’t trust her. But she’s so kind.* 

*Eleven people on the boat. Amir, Jacob,* *~~Josie~~**, CJ, Malik, Freejan,* *~~Miriam~~**,* *~~Dr. H~~**, Trinn,* *~~Williams~~**, Cooper.* 

*A trade. Freejan swims in circles in the water. Says he likes the cold. Can’t see him in the dark, only hear as he swims round and round, round and round.* 

*She gets in our heads. Sometimes I think I write but I don’t. Reading won’t make sense anymore. She’s getting out. Might be free.* 

*Sky lightened up a bit tonight. Land ahead. We will dock she said. We will get out. It’s dark again now.*

*No one is left on the boat.* 

*Eleven people on the boat.* 

*Two people on the boat.* 

*Her and me.* 

*I think I set her free.* 

*Someone set me free.* 

*Blood in the waters. Soon.*



I shut the journal. I took a deep breath, feeling my heart pounding in my chest. What had I just read? What had happened on that boat? I stood up, accidentally knocking over my wine glass, which shattered on the tile. I sighed, grabbing a broom and a dustpan to clean up the broken glass. 

Outside, was dark. The porch light was out. I needed to replace that soon. I made a mental note. Maybe I should write it down. I didn’t realize I had been sitting at the table reading for so long. 

I cleaned the glass up carefully, throwing it away. Mopped up the spilled wine. 

“Everything okay?”

My roommate stood in the entryway. I looked at him. I had forgotten his name, it was easy to forget. 

I nodded. “I just spilled some wine, sorry.”

He nodded and walked back down the dark hallway. 

I don’t think I had a roommate. When did he get here?

The entire house is dark now. I think the lightbulbs went out. I should buy new ones. I’ll write that down. 

What did Amir’s writing mean? 

My roommate is splashing in the bathtub upstairs. 

Can someone help me figure it out?
