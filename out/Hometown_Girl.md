Sandy Littman was someone I wanted to know even after I learned my own tastes. It was high school, 1998, and she was the most popular girl in my class. At 15 years old I wanted what everyone wanted, and everyone wanted Sandy. To be honest, I can’t recall whether her popularity was an outcome of that collective decision-making or if she was already stellar. Either way, she was very hot.  
  
We don’t talk like that anymore. I mean, it’s been over 30 years, so I don’t need to. Married and all that. But I had reason to think about Sandy recently, on a trip back home.  
  
I went back to my hometown a year ago. It looked the same as when I left it. I don’t have any reason to go back because my family had moved away. I got a job in a large city where skyscrapers go up and luxury apartments take up all the good real estate. Gentrification. No one would gentrify my hometown though. No money in it.  
  
The corner store had the same sign. The grocery store chain had changed but it was the same building. Post office was the same, updated their fleet though.  
  
Then there was the high school.  
  
Smack in the middle of town like a wart on a nose. I guess I don’t have that many bad memories. Bullied, sure. My friends? I guess I could call them that. We didn’t get up to much. They did together, more often. Maybe because I didn’t drink or smoke. I don’t like parties.  
  
Faded orange brick and peeling white paint on the metal window casings framed up my high school. Prim grass. Cut by the same groundskeeper, no doubt. What was his name?  
  
I walked by my high school when I visited, and took it in. Then I went to The Depot, the local café. It’s a Starbucks now, but it’s housed in one of these old buildings even a small town protects, and carved into the stone above the entrance were the words ‘The Depot’, like a cheap triumphal arch, immortal all the same.  
  
That’s when I saw her. Sandy Littman. Sitting at a table beside the single-pane glass sipping burnt coffee and reading a kindle.  
  
I don’t know if it was the grey light of the high-clouded day, or the generally depressing sense that a tiny town built for big-city traffic gives off because of its expansive and empty avenues and parking lots, but she looked like musty paper.  
  
That’s mean.  
  
She looked fine. Understand that I hadn’t been back in that town for three decades. Only so many memories stuck with me all these years. Sandy for sure buzzed between my synapses, and when I saw her, circuits of memories of her fame suddenly fired up, and in that same instant the weight of time and the nothingness of my hometown and staleness of what The Depot had become—a Starbucks of all things, even here in the middle of nowhere—it just shocked me. She seemed too normal and plain, and my memories didn’t match. Memories that flooded in were not memories at all but fantasies, some of which embarrassed me now, and I blushed. Standing there in that Starbucks, blushing.  
  
The roar of a passing semi jostled me from this little reverie—I don’t like loud noises. When my senses came into focus, I noticed Sandy staring at me.  
  
In my fantasies I’m the hero. Introversion begets extroversion in made up worlds. Sometimes, anyway. I never did work up the courage to talk to Sandy in reality. But we had plenty of adventures in my mind. Later I’d learn that she wasn’t my type, but then my type formed around what I knew to be within grasp. I am a lousy man.  
  
“Hey!” she shouted.   
  
Then she stood up! Set her coffee down and her e-reader and walked toward me! My adolescence bloomed and squirmed. As if her ‘hey’ had been directed at it, my nervous tick slid on stage with vigor. I was still rubbing my forearm a bit too rapidly when Sandy rolled up to a stop three feet or so from me.  
  
“I know you,” she said.  
  
“Hi.” I stopped rubbing my arm, but more nervousness was on deck, awaiting its turn to bat.  
  
“You’re… you’re from here!” she beamed. And for a moment she matched my recollection. Sandy Littman, I said breathlessly inside my own cranium.  
  
“Sandy,” I blurted.  
  
“Yeah! And you’re…”  
  
“…Roger! Um, sorry. Hearing is off,” I said, excusing my overly loud response.  
  
She stood there eyeing me, her mouth open, one elbow resting on the other arm across her chest. Only now did I notice her smock. A green barista smock. She must have been on break.  
  
“Roger! That’s right. Hmm. Did we, um…” she started. I noticed she was looking down at my belly, then my pants, at the crotch. Her eyes looked back up at me from that angle. “…ya know?”  
  
“Yes,” I said.  
  
Now, I know what you are thinking. This didn’t happen. I assure you, it did. Yes, I’m married. But this was Sandy Littman, and her plainness was nothing compared to how many years I had built her up—her type was absolutely mine in that very moment that she somehow sucked out my fantasy and made it real before my eyes, and me the hero. I know I’m a bastard. I already told you that.  
  
“Y-yes,” I said, clearing my throat.  
  
“Hmm.”  
  
“So, you uh,” I said, pointing at her smock.  
  
“Oh, yeah. Temporary. I’ve got things going on.”  
  
I nodded, and my hands found their pockets.  
  
“Listen,” she said. “I get off at 5. You stayin’ in town?”  
  
“Um, yeah,” I said.   
  
“Not many of the old gang show up around here. I told myself if it happened again, I’d make it a date.”  
  
The words melted my stubborn lying heart. Old gang, as if I was ever a part of that. A date, like so many fantastical premises I remembered. I was not sure who she thought I was, but I’d take the part.  
  
  
5pm came very slowly. I walked around. The town is only so many blocks long, and fewer wide. A lot of foreclosures beyond downtown. Did we do it? I smirked. I sure imagined it enough. Do it. That’s how we used to refer to the act. Do young people still do it?   
  
My wife’s face flashed across my vision when my phone alarm buzzed in my pocket. It’s 5.  
  
  
A bell above the door rang as Sandy came out of The Depot building, bundled in a spring sweater and a trapper hat, no more smock.   
  
“I’m free,” she announced. “So.”  
  
“So,” I said.  
  
“Well, let’s walk then.”  
  
Together we crossed the wide empty street. We went past the quiet or closed shopfronts, Starbucks being the only real action in town, it seemed. We turned a corner and were back on our old high school grounds. The groundskeeper was there, raking leaves—same guy, but very old. What was his name again?   
  
“Good times,” she said.  
  
“The best,” I lied, turning back to her.  
  
“So, I’ve been trying to place us.”  
  
“Oh?”  
  
“And you know, the more I think about it, I think we never did… you know.”  
  
I sucked my lips in and squinted off in front of us as we walked.  
  
“Ah ha,” she said. “Roger, I do remember you.”  
  
Heart chambers collapsed from the embarrassment, from instantaneously losing the part, from being stripped of the living fantasy. My brain tried to see plain Sandy now, but she was hot. Hot, that’s what we used to say about attractive people. Are young people still hot?  
  
I felt small fingers poke my stomach.  
  
“Don’t worry I won’t tell,” she said. I eyed her covertly, but she was looking right at me. Two grown adults in their forties. Maybe being so close to the high school we were trapped in some kind of childish aura that made us uncouth. She pulled me down toward her, cupped a hand between her mouth and my ear and whispered.  
  
“Let’s go to the old spot.”  
  
  
Did your childhood and adolescence have a ‘spot’, alternatively referred to as ‘the spot’, or ‘our spot’? In my hometown, which was flatter than a flat earther’s brain, we had a forest. In that forest there was a dried gulley where people hauled old furniture and the like. A little outdoor ad hoc youth center, where only the worst intentions frolicked.  
  
It’s where kids did adult things together.  
  
In our forties, it was the old spot. Sandy couldn’t know that I’d never been there before. I don’t like parties. It struck me now, looking back, that I’d never gone. Such a small town, nothing to do. But it’s true. That spot was the realm of the famous, insofar as the popular kids partied in infamy.  
  
A few blocks from school a field gave way to leafless deciduous trees. Sparse at first, but they got thick and became disorienting quickly.   
  
Sandy knew the way.   
  
The forest is absolute silence. Our feet rustling the dried leaves and breaking twigs on the march were foreign sounds. Strangely birdless. Not even scurrying chipmunks. Not even a hint of wind.  
  
Eventually, after 15 minutes walking in Sandy’s leafy wake, the flat earth sank and scarred, revealing the gulley, long since dried of whatever had formed it.  
  
“Isn’t it great?” she said, like an excited teenager.  
  
Dusk had crept up on us. Daylight was dark blue. A pair of bluish torn couches, soiled by years of weather, sat facing each other. Folding chairs falling apart, piles of clothes and ratty sleeping bags, plastic buckets and rusty oil drums, one of which had been halved and plopped in the estimated center of the space for a firepit. I didn’t notice Sandy taking off her clothes.  
  
She looked at me over her nude shoulder, as she had in so many false memories. Fantastic, I thought heatedly, embarrassed. My wife’s eyes, shut away in the back of my mind, fading with the fading light.  
  
We had sex on the spot’s dank furnishings, roiling in sweat over the nasty piles of cloth and clothing, blazed by fiery memories, or at least for me. The silence of the forest made our sounds ridiculous. I felt eyes all around me. My fantasy leapt out of my body and mind the moment I finished, and I was overcome with deep, mortal shame, accompanied by the chill of night air on my sweating, dirty back.  
  
Afterward, Sandy curled up on one of the couches under one of the scavenged sleeping bags without a word.  
  
Fitting. What I deserved. I put my clothes back on. They felt like another man’s. I too grabbed a rotting bag and sat in one of the lawn chairs wrapped in it, regretting everything.  
  
  
I was woken by a snapped branch. In such silence, breaking wood is sharp in your ears. It startled me, and I felt my chest beat.   
  
“Sandy?” I whispered into the dark.   
  
We hadn’t lit a fire despite plenty of kindling. I shivered. I could see my breath.  
  
Sandy’s clothes were still scattered where she’d discarded them. Her sleeping back was empty.  
  
“Sandy?”  
  
Another snap. I rose, reluctantly dropped my warm nasty sleeping bag on the chair and felt my way in the dark toward the noises.  
  
Crunching leaves under my socked foot, no shoe. Felt a thorn on the next step, winced.   
  
“Sandy?”  
  
Each whisper as I neared the noises in front me grew fainter, as if I did not want an answer. Who wants to be answered by a soupy darkness?  
  
I had followed the cut of the gulley until it broke open to reveal a calm glade into which sparse moonlight lit just enough to make out a lonely figure.  
  
Sandy stood facing away from me, naked in the twilight. Her nakedness made me bundle my arms across my chest. But she stood there, as motionless as an effigy.  
  
“Sandy?” I hissed.  
  
She turned toward me then. All fantasy and desire I had were suffocated in an instant, ripped out of me by the image of her. She looked thirsty and desperate. Her belly bulged as if her body was starving, her face drawn chalky alabaster. Her eyes dead but staring at me.  
  
“S-Sandy?” I could barely speak.  
  
She looked down and away from me, slowly, invitingly. I approached carefully, radially, keeping distance. I followed her gaze to the ground. Six or seven lumps, no bigger than a loaf of bread, were organized in a semi-circle around her, covered uniformly in grass.  
  
She looked up.  
  
“This is where I bury my children.”   
  
My body quaked with latent terror. I could not recall my wife’s face for comfort. Nor my son’s.  
  
“Roger,” she whispered. “I will bury our child h-here.”  
  
She gagged on the last word. I felt paralysis. Fear planted my socks in that grass so deeply that to move was to perish.  
  
A deep retch emerged from Sandy’s throat until what seemed like a blockage silenced her. Her eyes stared at me unyieldingly, fixing me in my socks, imploring me to watch this horror as it unfolded.  
  
For what happened next, I could not have imagined in fantasy or nightmare. Sandy opened her mouth, not breaking her gaze on mine. But her mouth kept opening beyond the jaw’s limit. It opened unnaturally, turning itself into a gaping orifice. I heard liquid squelching in her throat as she threw back her head. Her belly flattened, her neck bulged. Something was coming up.  
  
Just then a new figure appeared, having broken upon us through silence. It was the groundskeeper from my high school. I felt relieved until I noticed the shovel in his hand. He did not look in my eyes. He was even older than I thought: cataracts on his irises, hands so callused and dry they were like gloves. He’d been old in my adolescence, now he seemed ancient. What was his name?  
  
Soft gurgling sounds stole my attention back to Sandy, who murmured in discomfort. A tear broke from her eye.  
  
I felt myself take a backward step from this horror. And another. A thorn pierced my skin through the sock, but I didn’t even flinch. I slowly retreated from the glade, regaining the shelter of sparce deciduous trees, just as the groundskeeper began digging a new hole.  
  
Before I knew it, I was running away, full sprint. Bare branches slapped my face, thorns stabbed my feet, as if the forest castigated me for my transgression. You lousy bastard.  
  
The last thing I heard before blood-thumping adrenaline took over my ear canals, was the screaming cry of a newborn, before it was abruptly silenced.  
  
  
I know what you are thinking. This didn’t happen. I assure you, it did. I’m home now. I ran out of that forest, out of that town.   
  
I’m writing because like a lot of people my age I don’t often go on Facebook. Do young people use Facebook anymore? I logged on the other day when my wife went to drop my son off at preschool. I have a new friend request from Sandy Littman. Her profile picture is from high school, and I am ashamed to say it, but those fantasies are firing on all cylinders. Maybe I should visit again.
