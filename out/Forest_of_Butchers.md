I was part of a climbing troupe that wanted to scale this cliff that was supposed to be difficult for even the seasoned rock climber. We had our gear and the mood was upbeat, half the trip was in a hired bus and the other trekking through and amazing location. Everything thing about the trip was going on well and the group gelled really well together, we wanted to climb, and it was that simple. The weather was calm, and it was said to be the best time of the year to climb and any other time we would be either blow off by strong winds or snowed in.

The rock wall we were making our way to was located near one of the longest waterfalls, it wasn’t on record because it wasn’t like that the whole year. In winter the water froze and the water would just trickle down the rocks. We made it to the site and set up camp and started checking our gear, I am a seasoned climber so my gear is pre-checked before heading out but I still check again when at location just in case. Everything checked out save for a few missing pins and ropes, we were prepared for such short falls.

The leader Andrea said we will spend a day on the ground to make sure everything was accounted for and that the climb should be dry. The waterfall was an amazing sight to behold and the water was crystal clear. I took a ton of photos for my socials and also of the surrounding area. I really liked the place and thought about returning there if the climb went well. The rock face was smooth and difficult to map from where we stood and Andrea and his partner also commented that it was unusual to see such a seamless face. The night before the climb is when all hell broke loose, we were 12 people in the troupe, and I was the only one to make it out.

Something was watching us and I wasn’t the only one to notice this, others like Catherine also mentioned this. We tried to brush it off and anticipation jitters and other such feelings, I pretty much brushed it off completely. That night I was in my tent when I heard something walking about my tent, I felt like it was a very large person walking around looking at the camp. I did not call out but remained silent in hopes that this is one of the other climbers running a joke to scare everyone. The walking sound faded as the person walked away, I was bracing for a jump scare or something but nothing came.

I peeked out of my tent and saw that the place was completely quiet and everyone was either asleep or in the process of doing so. I was beginning to feel like there was something out there and I needed to check. I got out of my tent and walked the perimeter of the site with my torch and could not find anything. Feeling guilty of being scared so easily I got back into my tent and turned in for the night. It was maybe an hour or so later I heard the first scream and the sound of tearing fabric, I woke up and tried to figure out what was happening. The sounds of screams and shouts were coming from the other tents and I tried to get out to see what was happening, I heard voices of people laughing and other sounds of things being hammered. Looking out my tent I could not make out the what was happening other than the sounds so I lit my torch and aimed it at where the sounds were coming from.

What I saw had scarred me deeply, I saw two large men holding up one of the women who was with us. One was holding the hands and the other the legs and they were pulling her and with a sicking cracking and tearing sound pulled into to two. My hand shot up to my mouth and I held back the shout and I dropped the torch, I got out of my tent and ran to a tree. I wanted to climb up and hide from this carnage, there was another man who was beating a tent mercilessly with a trunk. They were too preoccupied to notice me but I knew I would suffer the same fate, I was trying to survive and I hated myself for not trying to protect my friends. Other tents were empty and I guessed that the others might have run so there was that sense of relief.

While climbing the tree I heard more screams but they were coming from the forest, it dawned on me that there could be more of these people. What the hell was happening, the tour guide told us that this was supposed to be a protected sanctuary. These forest people were not mentioned to us, I looked down from where I was on the tree and I could see that one of the men were now looking at my tent. He, or it, was looking for me.

Fear of being found kept me rooted to the tree as I remained completely quiet and still, the thing was walking around the other tents looking for more of the troupe. My torch light was giving me full display of the other thing that had squatted down to rip the remains of the woman and was eating the meat. I saw that it had the shape of a human but the head was larger and the body much more muscular, the hair on the body was thicker. It would have resembled an ape but this was more human shaped, the head was larger but in the sense that the crown was longer. I saw the face and it resembled human featured but the eyes were sunken. I could now smell the air, it smelt of rot, it sort of reminded me of the swamps I had once visited. The smell of dead vegetation mixed with rotting meat and human waste.

I watched the one looking closer to the tree I was on, look around more and sniff the air every now and again. It got closer to me but then heard something from the forest and ran in, I looked at the one who was beating a tent rip it open and began fishing out pieces and examine them. It found a piece it wanted and began biting down, my breathing was becoming shallow as my grip to the trunk I was on was tight and I had to loosen it slightly to breath better. I was beginning to feel nauseous and the smell was really making my stomach churn. I tried to keep from making any sound as the carnage from the continued. I started asking myself how I was overlooked and kept coming short on why but I was grateful to survive this long.

I heard of something approach my tree from the back and it was another one of those things holding something in its hand. To my horror it was holding the upper half of another member, he was ripped in half just like the woman. It stopped under the tree and began to sniff the air and I feared that I was next. Thankfully it lowered its head and continued to the campsite and tossed the remains to the one eating the woman. It sat down and started eating also, ripping pieces of meat from the remains and biting down.

The adrenaline finally wore off and I was losing consciousness, fatigue was finally taking over and I was looking the fight to stay awake. I tried not move until the things left but I knew sooner or later I was going to fall asleep and maybe fall from the hiding spot. A loud howl woke me and the things were immediately alert and looking around, they picked up whatever they could and ran from the camp. I thought it would be wolves from the sound but it could have been their signal to leave or something. Waiting for longer only delayed the inevitable sleep and I was soon asleep.

I woke later and it was daylight and found my self still on the trunk, I looked down at the camp and saw the carnage from last night. I waited for sometime before climbing down and saw the true extent of last nights massacre. This was ungodly in every form of butchery, the bodies of the torn man and woman were gone only leaving behind their inside and other viscera. I checked the beaten tent and saw the utter mangled body of the inhabitant, they were beyond recognition. I turned and ran, I did not care for anything and ran to the sanctuary offices or other camps. I could not think of anything but to survive now.
