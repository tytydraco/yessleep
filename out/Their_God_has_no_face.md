It’s storming right now, and I can’t sleep, I can never sleep during a thunderstorm. Even now, I have to stop my hands from shaking as I write this.

I’m in my bed right now, and my girlfriend is asleep next to me. My storm-related freak-out is nothing new to her. It’s so old hat, that’s she can just sleep through It now. 

The first handful of times that It happened around her, she would ask me what happened, and I would skate around her question. “You need to write It down, Even If you never show me” She’d say over and over again like a broken record. 

We’ll, She’d be happy to know that tonight Is the night that I’ve decided to dust off the journal she bought me that’s been sitting, unused in the night stand.

While the words have no problem flowing, I find myself, even now beginning to doubt what I Saw that night. Maybe by writing It all down, I’d be able to give those events some sort of legitimacy, outside my own rattled stream of consciousness.

My name is Adam Gray. I’m forty-two, and I spent the better part of my youth homeless. The how and why of said homelessness is another story for another time. What matters is one particularly stormy night twenty years ago. 

It was supposed to be one bitch of a thunderstorm, At least that’s what Big Joe said down at the Pizza shop. Big Joe was the Owner over at Luigi’s on fifth and Lenox.

I’d hang around there sometimes and shoot the shit with him. Best Pizza in the city. I know, because He’d always let me jet with the slices that were left baking under the lamp too long. Even a few hours sitting out the oven, that pizza was still fucking killer. 

That day he would close earlier than usual, though. Instead of the daily 8pm closing time, Big Joe would start shutting things down around five. 

We talked about the oncoming storm for a bit. Big Joe thought that the sudden storm had something to do with a planetary alignment that was going on.

“The universe is a crazy place” he chuckled with that thick Brooklyn accent of his. I heard once somewhere, that Big Joe wasn't from Brooklyn, he wasn't even Italian, He just talked like that to make the place feel more authentic. I never gave a shit, he was always nice to me. 

His rant about the alignment and celestial bodies would go on longer than his normal ones about politics, or even things that he’d seen on TV the night before. 

It Had something to do with Earth lining up with the milky way, and how It hadn't happened in like a thousand years or something.

To be honest, I tuned most of It out. I’d talk about mostly anything, but when the conversation jumps into horoscopes and superstitions, I’d start to tune out. Not anymore, though. 

“You got a place to keep dry tonight kid?” He’d ask. I lied and told him I did. I mean I wasn't entirely a lie. for a few weeks, I had been laying my head in this awesome abandoned building off of the fleet street.

After speaking for a few minutes more, Big Joe loaded me up with some pizza, only It was a box of the fresh stuff. “Something for the road,” he said as we parted ways. 

I could see the dark clouds gathering in the distance, as I cleared a few blocks on the way to my crash pad. As I turned a corner, I ran into an old bearded man nestled against the wall. He saw my box of pizza, and I could hear his stomach growling from where I was standing. 

“Think you could spare some of that?” The old man asked with low, gravely voice. For a moment, I considered telling me no, I could have eaten that pizza for a few days, but I figured what the hell.

His face lit up, as I opened the pizza box. His face lit up even more when I told him he could take more than one.

Before I walked off, the old man handed me something for as payment. I told him, no, but he insisted that I take the old quarter from him. I took the coin and slipped It in my pocket.

As I finally made It to my pad, I heard the first clap of thunder. The rain followed soon after.

The place was huge. I think It used to be a warehouse or something. Three separate floors, that for all intents and purposes were all mine. 

I had my set up in the far corner of the second floor. On the bottom floor, I had rigged the entrance with cans and glass bottles, so that If anyone decided to sneak in, I’d know within enough time If they were friend or foe.

The biggest thing about being homeless, next to the finding food, and the being broke part, Is setting a flag down in your own space. Most good spots got swarmed within a few days of being discovered. 

First, you’ve got one guy sleeping across from you, then ten. Eventually, the space becomes so packed, that whatever comfort It had was sucked up by all the bodies suddenly occupying It. 

At that time, It was nice to finally have a place that I was able to call home. If only for a short time.

It had rained once or twice before since I had been staying in the warehouse. Usually, the only thing I would have to worry about would be a few random leaks here and there. Always an easy fix whenever It would happen. 

I’d simply move wherever the hell It wasn't dripping at. An easy feat when You live inside of what’s basically an urban castle. Not that night, though. It was different than the storms that I’d hunkered down in the past.

While laying on my cot, I took a second look at the old man's quarter. After closer inspection, I could see that It wasn't a coin of any kind. It was more like a medallion.

The surface was engraved with strange markings that I had never seen before. It was silver, so I figured that I could pawn It later. 

When the rain fell, It fell hard. Harder than nature should be allowed to inflict on people. The wind howled, and the water slammed against the creaky tin roofing of the warehouse. There was no warning, no leaking to get me ready, just a loud crashing from above. 

The entire roof began to cave in under the sudden weight of the accumulated water. The resulting bucket fulls suddenly began to drench me, and my area on the second floor.

Grabbing what little I could, I stuffed It into my backpack and ran downstairs, trying to outrun the water that was now gathering around at a frightening speed.

I abandoned my castle and was now in the middle of a rain-soaked apocalypse. I had no Idea where I was going because I had nowhere to go. I bundled up and started slowly making my way through downtown.

The rain never let up, as my search went on for hours. Any and every spot that was even remotely dry was nabbed up by dozens of other homeless. They would all be huddled like those bats in those discovery channel shows. All squeezed together like a living quilt.

I had been in a situation like that before. One-half of the group smells like booze, and the other half smells like piss and shit. Never a good combination. I continued my search elsewhere.

The night had come just as fast as the rain, and I was just about ready to give up until I saw It sitting there Like a waterlogged mirage. 

It was lighthouse at sea. I had found what I thought was the answer to my prayers.

I thought that I knew the city like the back of my hand. The building that I saw, proved me wrong. It was a church, sitting in the center of an abandoned parking lot, an island surrounded by asphalt. 

The church looked like It had been abandoned for years, and built even longer ago. The two-story building was constructed entirely of molding, red brick. 

There was a deteriorating sign hoisted high up on a rusted pole that said Victory tabernacle church of Christ. The last two letters at the end of Christ had started to succumb to the forces of gravity, hanging lopsided from their original positions.

It took no time thinking It over on my part. I rushed to the front of the Church and went to the door. It was locked, but with a bit of force, I got the old thing to crack open wide enough for me to slip through.

The flashlight that was in my bag hadn't gotten soaked, so It was still able to do It’s job. The beam of light Illuminated the inside of the church. It wasn't anything special, or different than I had seen dozens of times before.

There was the usual seating arrangement, iconography, and pulpit. Surprisingly, the interior was in a lot better shape than the outside. At the time, the only thing that caught me off guard was the life-sized statue of Jesus standing near the pulpit.

The head had been taken off and placed back on upside down, placing his eyes where his chin should have been and vice versa. After staring at the deformed statue longer than I should, I noticed a flight of stairs in the corner of the room.

I followed the winding staircase up to the second floor. The upstairs looked like It had been converted into an attic or storage area. There were taped up boxes and furniture as far as the eyes could see.

I found a dusty couch and made myself at home. After setting my bag down, I climbed up onto the musty couch and curling up in the fetal position. It didn't take long for me to pass out from exhaustion.

When I finally woke up, I had no Idea how much time had passed since I passed out. It was still dark out, still raining. I stopped being concerned with the time once I started to hear sounds coming from the floor below.

I grabbed my backpack and slowly crept down the spiral staircase, stopping halfway and crouching so that I could get a decent view while still staying hidden.

The bottom floor was no longer empty, It was filled to near capacity with sitting people, all of them looked dirty and homeless. Their faces were illuminated by a few strategically placed lanterns, giving the room a flickering orange glow. 

There was now a man standing in the pulpit as well. He was bald, thin, and covered in an oversized rain coat. I could hear him speaking to the attentive crowd, only his words weren't coming out like they should have been. 

Everything that the man said sounded like phrases I could recognize, yet they seemed completely foreign.

The strange man would speak in broken, distorted chunks, then the audience would acknowledge whatever he said by responding in unison with the word “Nema”. 

“Nema”. Why did that word seem so familiar, why did that man’s speech sound slightly understandable? My insides seized up when I realized what was happening before my eyes. They weren't speaking in some foreign language, they were speaking backward. “Nema” was actually “Amen”.

The man continued his odd sermon, sounding more like a tape playing in reverse than a person. He was speaking so fast that I could only decipher a few of the words he was saying.

Black, pit, father, end. Even what I managed to make out sounded like gibberish. 

As I took a closer look, I noticed something that eluded me before. Everyone downstairs had the exact same symbol written on their foreheads. The symbol was drawn in dark marker, and resembled the letter D, with the letter S, turned sideways going through the middle. 

The man finished whatever It was he said, and the audience responded once again with the word “Nema”, followed by intense applause. Through the clapping, I could hear another noise, screaming.

A man was being dragged from the back of the room by two large, stocky members of the congregation.

The man they were dragging was thin and sickly, his long hair was matted together, and he wasn't wearing a shirt or shoes, Just a pair of tattered jeans.

As the two men held him down, It wasn't his screams of protest that captured my attention, It was the fact that the symbol written on his forehead was different than all the others.

His symbol looked like the letter C turned upside down, with a line going through the middle.

The sounds coming from the shirtless man were as chilling as they were loud. 

Suddenly The man in the pulpit began to chant a series of words over and over again, louder, and louder until the congregation also started chanting the words. “Live Dog Sah Emoc”,“Live Dog Sah Emoc”.

It took a few seconds to translate the chant, but when I did, I felt my blood freeze on the inside. They were saying “Evil God has come”. 

I felt the urge to run, but something kept me frozen in that position, something wanted me to see what happened next.

During the fifth round of chants, the shirtless stopped his screaming, as his body went totally limp. The chanting got faster, and faster. The two large men that were holding the shirtless man stepped back, as If to maintain a safe distance. 

“Live Dog Sah Emoc”, “Live Dog Sah Emoc”

The shirtless man’s back lifted up as blood sprayed upwards, at least five feats from his mouth before his eyes began rolling into the back of his head.

“Live Dog Sah Emoc”, “Live Dog Sah Emoc”

The shirtless man’s mouth opened, expanding wider, and wider with each passing second, eventually bypassing the physical limits of a human being. 

The strong smell of sulfur and ammonia hit my nose like an invisible sledgehammer. 

Two bloody fingers appeared, clawing their way out the side of the shirtless man’s mouth. a whole hand followed, then an arm. I watched in horror as a blood-covered figure crawled Its way out of a mouth that was, at that point the width of a car tire. 

The chanting stopped. All that could be heard was the rain battering against the outside of the building, along with the sickening sounds of bones crunching, and flesh churning. 

Thunder boomed as the final leg stepped out of what was left of the shirtless man. The figure stood on two legs like a person, somewhere in the sisix Foot range.

The blood It was drenched in made certain details impossible to make out. The body was flat chested, thin and elongated.

The most disturbing detail was that It had no face. Nothing was there, no eyes, no, mouth, no nose, just a concave space with one thick line stretching down the center. 

Even stranger was the lack of any defining sexual organs. No penis, no Vagina. The bottom half of the figure resembled a living Ken doll.

Everyone in the congregation bowed their heads. The man in the pulpit stepped down to quietly greet the figure, dropping his head to bow as well. 

The figure cocked It’s head to the side like a curious animal. I then watched as the blank face split open releasing dozens of sharp tendrils, that first ripped the pulpit man apart like flesh in a blender, then extended across the entire room. 

Skin was separated from the body, heads were decapitated. I couldn't take any more. But the worst part, the worst part of everything that was happening, the part that’s going to stay with me the most, was the silence. None of the people put up a fight, while that thing was slicing them to shreds. 

I forced my legs to move again, and scrambled back up the stairs, all the while hearing the sounds of slaughter going on below me. 

I couldn't find an exit, so I made one. I took a chair and tossed It through one of the windows. The rain blew into my face as I stood at the edge. With nothing but my adrenaline guiding me, I jumped out of that second level window onto the hard, wet ground below. 

I felt my left leg break on impact, I couldn't feel the pain, all I could think about was what was going on in the church that wasn't too far from my then present position. I laid there in the rain staring ahead for any indication of movement.

Then I saw It. The figure was standing across from me, on the other side of the church. Its blank face had closed back up. My heart felt like I was going to give out from the strain.

After what seemed like an eternity, the naked figure turned It’s head in the direction of my right hand. I was tightly clutching the old man's, medallion. I hadn't even realized that I’d reached in my pocket during the commotion.

It stared at me for anther minute, then, backed into the heavy downpour, disappearing from sight.

The next morning I woke up to sunny skies on a bus stop bench, blocks away from where the church was located. To this day, I don’t know If I dragged myself there or... I still don’t even know what “Or” is. 

My leg never healed right after that night. I still have to walk with a cane until this day because of It. It doesn't bother me. I would have cut off both legs to get out of that building.

I would check the newspapers religiously for any stories involving mass death inside of an abandoned church. Nothing was ever printed. 

Weeks later, I got the courage to go back to that church. It was gone. Not like It had been torn down, It was like It had never been there, to begin with, just an empty parking lot that had a coming soon sign for some new fast food shit hole. 

Things got better in the years after that. I got a job at Luigi’s washing dishes, I went back to school and got my degree. When big Joe retired, He gave me the place to run. I know It all seems like a fairy-tale story. Like big Joe said, 

“The universe is a crazy place”
