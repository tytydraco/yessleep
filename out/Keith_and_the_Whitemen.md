When i was 26 years old i began working at Trinity Facility as a psychiatrist. I had just moved to the town near by. I had this one patient who still haunts me in my dreams and ill never be able to get him out of my head. It was1983 and the nurses were showing me to my office. A nurse named Genevieve warned me about a certain patient by the name of Keith. Apparently he had just been sent here after killing a doctor at his old facility. I told her " ill be sure to keep my distance whenever i speak to him" to reassure her. My first paitent was a woman named Freya. She was a paranoid schizophrenia. She told me about all of her friends that hung out with her before she came here. All of their names, what they were and why she liked them. She began to talk to me about how some of them stay with her in her room. Her favourtie friend being Haylee. Haylee wasnt a human but an dog. Freya believed that haylee was her guarduan angel. I had to up her dosage of medication as it was clear the meds she was on wasnt working well enough to stop her hallucinations. 

It had been a few weeks and i had finally been assigned Mr Keith. I was told that i needed to go to his bedroom as he wasnt allowed to leave. When i entered i saw metal bars cutting the room in half, seperating him from me. He was staring out the window when i sat down. i had to call to him for him to turn around and acknowledge me. 

*Me: How are you doing today Keith?*

*Him: Im doing fine Dr.* 

*Me: Thats very good to hear, ive come to talk to you about why you are here.* 

*Him: Theres nothing to say, im here because they believe im a lunatic*

*Me: Who believe youre a lunatic?*

*Him: the shadow people! they sent me here because i was going to share their secrets and they thought i was bonkers!*

*Me: who are the whitemen keith*

*Him: ohhhh you dont wanna know them Dr. they arent nice people, if they were i wouldnt be stuck in this shithole.*

I paused. I was concerned about who these whitemen were and why he was so ademant they sent him here. He admitted himself to the hospital, no one sent him here. I decided to end our session not too long after our conversation as what he was saying was tsrating to freak me out. He did tell me the whitemen were ancient beings that come to use humans as a vessel. I assumed Keith was their vessel. I went home and did hours of research on who these Whitemen were and i was shocked about my new discoveries...

The whitemen were a group of 15 men all dresses in white suits. in 400 BC the White men went into the forest and procedeed to sacrifcie 17 human lives to their god, Muisis. The god of Death and Power. The white men drank all of their victims blood before all slitting their wrist and stepping into a fire. They also sacrificed themselves for their god. According to urban legend the whitemen return every 30 years to continue to sacrfice humans for their beloved God, Keith being the one who draws the humans in. I was sure that this was just a myth. a scary fairytale to tell children to behave or they will be sacrificed. that was until i saw them myself and became one of their sacrfices too..
