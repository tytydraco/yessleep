I'm sure most of you guys are familiar with the game one man hide and seek. . If you’re not, then here is a brief description of it. You find a doll for a demon to possess, and you play hide and seek with it, if you win then good for you but if you lose then it’s literally game over. I decided to try it out mainly because I was curious as to find out if it actually worked. I went to an antique store and bought a creepy-looking ragdoll because I didn’t want to use a doll I was emotionally attached to.

The ritual goes as follows: you have to replace the stuffing in the doll with rice, also you have to clip off a few pieces of your nails and place them inside. You then have to sow it shut with a red thread, also you have to fill the bathtub with water. You have to give the doll a name, so I chose the name Sam. I grabbed a pair of scissors from the kitchen drawer because I needed them in the ritual. It’s also important to note that you must always keep a cup of saltwater with you.When the clock stroke 3AM I said: “Charles is the first it, Charles is the first it, Charles is the first it.”. I didn’t use my real name because I didn’t want the demon to know what my name is, besides if something happened might as well send the bad luck to my enemy.

I hurried to the bathroom and placed the doll in the bathtub. I quickly turned off all the lights in the house and hid in the living room because that’s where the TV was. I turned the TV to static because if the demon was close, I would be able to tell by the TV static. I hid behind the couch with my cup of saltwater. I closed my eyes and counted to ten while my grip tightened firmly around the scissors. After I had finished counting to ten, I ran back to the bathroom with the scissors in my hand and said: “I have found you Sam.”, then I proceeded to stab the doll. I repeated this process three times before I said: “you are the next it.”.

I moved the doll out of the bathtub and onto the bathroom counter and hid behind the couch again. I waited for what felt like an hour. The TV suddenly started turning on and off on its own, that probably meant that the doll was close. I held my breath and started counting inside of me: “1,2,3,4” and so on to calm myself until the TV turned to static and nothing more happened. I waited a little longer with the scissors still in my hand. Nothing. I slowly peeked my head out to see if I could spot anything. But I didn’t.

Damn, had it actually worked? Like did I have an actual demon possessed doll playing hide and seek with me? That sounded awesome but at the same time I was terrified for my own life. I looked at the cup of saltwater sitting beside me and the scissors in my hand. If something happened, I knew how to finish the game and on top of that I had something to defend myself with, I was going to make it out alive. I listened carefully to try and hear the footsteps of the doll to pinpoint where it was and where it was headed. But I heard nothing. Nothing but total silence and my heart beating loud and fast in my chest.

I wondered what a demon actually looked like, if it looked like a creature with horns and a tail or if it looked completely different. As curious as I was, I had no intentions of finding out, I was happy in not knowing what it looked like. Suddenly, I heard what sounded like glass hitting the floor, and I knew right then and there that the ritual had worked. I pressed myself into the corner holding both the cup of saltwater and the scissors in my hands. I held my breath and started to count again. The TV started making weird noises and turning on and off again. For some reason it felt like the doll was nearer this time. I decided that enough was enough.

I poured half of the cup of saltwater in my mouth, and I bravely stepped out from my hiding place. There it was right on the other side of the couch. I poured the remaining saltwater on the doll and spitted the saltwater I had in my mouth on it. I said: “I win, I win, I win.”.That was supposed to end the ritual. The doll fell on the floor, “Bloody hell.” I blurted out. I cautiously poked the doll a few times, I had to be sure the demon had left.

When it still didn’t move, I picked it up and looked at my phone, the clock read: 05:15 am. “Fuck.” I thought to myself, the ritual wasn’t supposed to last for more than two hours. I lost track of time, “oh well, it’s only been 15 minutes I mean that can’t hurt, can it?” I thought. I walked over to the fireplace and started a fire. I threw the doll inside the fire and watched it burn. After a while I put out the fire and found the doll in ashes. I scooped the ashes into a box and got in my car. I drove to the woods far away from my home and buried the box by a tree I found there. After that I drove home, the ritual had worked, and I had successfully ended it.

I yawned feeling sleep creeping in on me. I went to bed and quickly fell asleep. When I awoke, I remember parts of my strange dream, I only remember the doll and a note stating: “game over.” I was probably scared from what had happened. I went about my day forgetting the strange dream.That night when I went to bed, I heard a knocking on my door. What in the world? Who could that be at this hour? I got up and went downstairs in my pajamas. I opened the door and found no one, “bloody kids” I said to myself and closed the door. I turned around and found a note on the floor, it read: “game over.” in red.  My heart stopped and my insides turned cold, I knew who it was. Suddenly, I felt someone poking me in my back…
