It all started a few years ago. My husband and I had just bought our very first house together after living four years in a small apartment. We had spent most of our relationship living in that cramped space, even before we got married. So, when my husband got a better job opportunity, we both knew that a house would be much better suited for us, especially if we wanted to start a family someday.  
  
We found this cute three-bedroom house just outside the city in a very nice little community. The house stood at the end of a street at the edge of the woods. It was a comfortable two-story house with all the bedrooms upstairs. It had a decent sized backyard with the woods just behind the picket fence that surrounded the house. My husband, of course, was in love with it. I, on the other hand, had a strange feeling about it. A feeling that told me that something was off about this place. But still, it was a lot better than the previous apartment that we had just left. Plus, we would have a lot of privacy.  
  
At first, I thought it was adorable, a wonderful home to start a family in. But as the weeks went on, I kept having this uneasy feeling about something. I couldn’t quite understand it, but I had this sensation that I wasn’t alone. I quickly brushed it off, thinking that it was just my imagination.  
  
Of course, not long after we moved in, I got pregnant. My husband and I were so happy when we found out. We immediately got to work on the baby’s room right next to ours, picking out all kinds of clothes and deciding whether or not to paint the walls or buy wallpaper. We were so excited about starting our new family. But on the days when my husband was at work, that feeling of not being alone came back, especially when I was in the baby’s room.  
  
Then one day, in my late second trimester, I was in the baby’s room painting the walls, deciding to go with pink after finding out it was a girl. I suddenly heard a noise. At first, I didn’t know what it was, but it sounded like a small thud. It startled me and listened intently for a long while, not sure if I made it up or not. But then I heard it again. It was quiet, but it was there, and it was coming from the closet. Cautiously, feeling my heart beating faster in my chest, I moved towards the closest. It was a double folded door tha t was quite large, enough for you to stand in and have your arms out. I didn’t know what I was going to find up there, but I was also afraid to find out. Slowly, I gripped both handles, my hands shaking terribly as I did so. Then, like a band aid, I jerked the doors open, expecting to see someone standing in there. Only to reveal nothing. It was completely empty. I was taken aback; I was sure I heard something.  
  
But then I heard the thud again, this time it was above me. I looked up at the only thing above me, a small square lid that led to the attic. Now my heart was pounding so hard that I thought it was going to burst. Now I know that something was up there. But I was no coward. I went down to the kitchen to grab a knife from the counter and returned to the attic door. Steeling my nerves, I climbed up the step ladder I was using before and pressed up against the lid. I opened the lid just enough to peer inside the attic but I couldn’t see anything. And I think that terrified me more than anything. The fact that I couldn’t see that clearly into the darkness, with the thought of something in there staring back at me, made my blood run cold. I held the knife tightly in my left hand, preparing for the worst. I scanned the area around me, but I still could see anything. I couldn’t hear anything either, it was so quiet.  
  
Suddenly, something jumped at my face from out of the darkness. I screamed loudly, losing my footing and collapsing onto the floor. I was in immense pain as I landed awkwardly on the ladder. It was at that moment that my husband, who had just arrived home from work early, ran up the stairs and into the room in a panic. He asked me what happened, but before I could explain, I heard skittering on the carpet floor. We both looked to see a tiny chipmunk running across the floor, trying to hide under whatever it could to find shelter. Seeing the little chipmunk running around and realizing that it was the one making all that noise before, I nearly burst out laughing at how ridiculous it all was, if it weren’t for the searing pain in my back from falling over. And just as my husband was trying to get the chipmunk out of the house, my thoughts then turned to my baby. Was my baby okay?  
  
I called out my husband’s name in a panic, just as he came rushing back into the room after finally getting the chipmunk out of the house, and he quickly helped me into that car and brought me to the hospital. Thankfully the baby was unharmed. Although I was going to have a bruised back for a good while, my husband and I were just relieved that our baby was okay.  
  
After leaving the hospital, we went straight home. But the moment we stepped through the door, that feeling of uneasiness returned. I tried ignoring it, thinking that it was just my anxiety over my pregnancy just messing with me.  
  
Later that night, I was laying in bed with my husband. It was getting close to midnight and I was trying to get some sleep. But for whatever reason, I just couldn’t. I was laying on my back with my eyes closed, feeling rather annoyed about not sleeping. But then, that same feeling of being watched returned. I opened my eyes, only to be greeted by the blinding darkness. I closed my eyes again and tried to shake the feeling away, hoping that it was just my imagination or sleep deprivation and overtiredness causing me to overthink.  
  
But then, I heard something. It was faint, but I could hear it clearly. There was something moving from outside the room, like something walking on the carpet. I opened my eyes once again, but I still couldn’t see anything, only the darkness that blanketed the room.  
  
I listened carefully, trying to pinpoint exactly where it was outside the bedroom. The sound of walking slowly grew louder, like it was getting closer. And that's when the dreaded truth hit me as I remembered; we never shut the bedroom door.  
  
It was now in the room, its footsteps getting closer. I looked around frantically, trying to see what or where it was. I wanted to turn my head towards it, but the fear in me prevented it. My heart was throbbing in my chest and I found it very difficult to breathe. I tried to keep myself calm, but I could still hear whatever it was getting closer.  
  
Suddenly, the footsteps stopped, and I could hear something else now: Breathing. I could hear it clearly. It’s right next to me, standing right at the edge of my bed. I looked at where the sound was coming from, but I still couldn’t see it. But I knew it was right next to me. I could feel its eyes on me, staring at me in the darkness. My heart was pounding and I could feel a cold sweat all over my body. I tried to move, but my body refused to move. I was paralyzed with fear.  
  
Its breathing was closer now, I could feel it right next to my ear. I could feel my tears rolling down my face as I tried to keep myself from crying. I didn’t want whatever it was to know I was awake and aware of it. I silently prayed to myself, hoping for it to go away. The next thing I felt was a long, skinny hand slowly pressed down on my stomach, followed by a low grunt entering my ear.  
  
I was finally able to get control of my body and let out a blood curdling scream as I sat up on the bed. My husband woke up and quickly turned on the lights, frantically asking what was wrong.  
  
I looked around the room for whatever that thing was, but there was nothing. The room was empty and the bedroom door was wide open. I began sobbing uncontrollably and my husband wrapped his arms around me, trying to calm me down. I told him everything that happened, even though saying it all aloud sounded crazy. My husband tried telling me that it was probably sleep paralysis. But I told him that it wasn’t. That I was wide awake for everything. He looked everywhere in the house, but he couldn’t find anything. When he came back I cried in his arms as he rubbed my back gently. I had never been so terrified in my whole life.  
  
Fortunately that was the last time something like that happened. I kept my bedroom door shut everynight and even bought myself a nightlight, as childish as it sounds. My husband thought so too, but supported me nonetheless. But whether he approved or not, I was never going to feel that helpless ever again. Although no incident happened after that night, that same feeling of being watched never left.  
  
As the weeks went by, I started feeling better about that night. The more I thought about it, the more I began to question whether or not it really was sleep paralysis. I did research on it and found that there were a few cases where sleep paralysis can increase during the second trimester. After a while, I came to the conclusion that maybe it was just sleep paralysis and I was just remembering it wrong. I started to feel better after that.  
  
A few months had passed and I finally gave birth to a healthy baby girl that we named Bella. I was so happy to have my family that I had nearly forgotten about that night entirely. Everything changed once the baby came home. I was so busy with her that the feeling of being watched was nearly forgotten as well. Even though she was a handful at times, I was grateful for the distraction.  
  
However, a few months later, things started getting weird again. We kept Bella in the nursery at night, with all doors open incase she needed me in the middle of the night, which was almost every night. She would always wake up around 2am most nights. She didn’t need to be fed or changed though. My husband and I just assumed she wanted attention because as soon as we picked her up, she went right back to sleep after a few minutes. This has been happening after the first month of her being home.  
  
One night I heard Bella crying. Same time around 2am, like clockwork. I was feeling extra tired and didn't really have the strength to climb out of bed just yet. But after a few minutes of hearing my daughter wailing from the nursery, I finally pushed myself out of bed. However, as soon as I stepped out of the room, my daughter suddenly stopped crying. I was slightly concerned by this and quickly rushed to the nursery. But once I got there, I saw her sound asleep in her crib. I was really confused by this, as she wouldn’t go back to sleep unless either my husband or I were holding her. But there she was, sound asleep, as if she hadn’t woken up at all. I was puzzled for sure, but seeing that Bella was perfectly fine made me feel relaxed and I headed back to bed. That was the last time she woke up in the middle of the night.  
  
A few years later, another strange occurrence happened. Bella was now four years old and had just started learning more and more about her imagination. She would always be in her room playing with her toys and chatting away while I cleaned the house. But then I got curious about what she was up to and decided to peek in on her while she was playing. I poked my head around the doorframe and saw her playing with her toys and chatting away to herself, just like she normally did. But what I found curious was that she was playing by the closet door that was now open. I thought this was strange because I was sure it was closed before and she didn’t know how to open the doors. I just shrugged it off though. Since there was nothing dangerous in there I thought it was fine.  
  
But then she looked up at the closet and began talking into it happily, as if she was actually talking to someone in there. I was very curious about her behavior, and continued to watch her further. But as Bella continued talking to her closet, all the memories of what had occured throughout our time living in this house came flooding back. Flashes of that night filled my mind as my heart began pounding in my chest and my body began to tremble. I remembered that horrible breathing against my face and the hand pressed against my stomach. I tried shaking these thoughts away, telling myself to remember that it was only a dream.  
  
My daughter then looked my way, giving me that same adorable smile that I loved so much. I didn’t want to worry her so I put on my best smile, hoping that she wouldn’t notice my anxiety, before entering the room and kneeling down beside her.  
  
“Hey, sweetie,” I said in a gentle voice.  
  
“Hi, Mommy!” she said happily.  
  
“Who were you just talking to just now?” Bella didn’t answer me right away as she returned her attention back to the doll in her hands.  
  
“Max!” she finally answered.  
  
“Max?” I asked. I certainly wasn’t expecting that name. “And who’s Max, sweetie?” Bella looked back at me with her usual smile.  
  
“Max is my friend,” she giggled. “He plays with me all the time.”  
  
“And where is Max?” Bella pointed up at the closet.  
  
“He lives in there.” I looked up at the closet, but there was nothing in there, save for a few clothes hanging up and the small toy bag on the floor.  
  
Seeing that nothing was in there, I looked back at my daughter, who was still smiling and playing with her doll. I was starting to get a little nervous, thinking that something else was going on. I had heard stories of children being able to see things that adults couldn’t. Was this one of those times?  
  
“Sweetie?” I asked, trying my best not to let my anxiety show. “What does Max look like?” Bella smiled even wider when she looked up at me.  
  
“He’s very tall. He’s dis big!” She tried raising her hands as high as she could. “He has long arms and a really big head.” My heart was beginning to pound even harder now. I was almost certain now that Bella was talking to something paranormal.  
  
I looked up into the closet, feeling really uneasy. Was there a ghost living inside my daughter’s closet? I stared up at the attic door on the ceiling, my imagination soon getting the better of me. My husband and I didn’t have that many things that needed to be stored away, so there was never any need to put anything up there. In all this time, ever since that chipmunk incident, I had never gone up there. The thought of something paranormal living up there, so close to my daughter, was too terrifying to think about.  
  
“But when he plays with me, he can turn into a little ball like this.” She then tucked her knees to her chest and began rolling around on the floor like a ball. Seeing my daughter do this, I immediately released a sigh of relief. I had never heard of ghosts doing that, even around children. With this in mind, I finally came to the conclusion that she had just made up an imaginary friend. I was relieved by this thought and smiled down at Bella.  
  
“Okay sweetie,” I said. “Mommy’s going to get started on dinner. You keep playing with Max, okay?”  
  
“Okay mommy!” I smiled again and patted her head before standing up to leave the room. As I made my way out, I almost laughed at myself for being so paranoid. Once I was down the stairs, I once again heard Bella laughing and chatting away in her room. I finally let myself chuckle at how ridiculous I was being before heading into the kitchen to get started on dinner.  
  
This went on for around a year. Bella would be up in her room most of the time playing with her imaginary friend by the closet. I would occasionally play with her, but most of the time she would say that she wanted to play with Max. One day I asked her why Max couldn’t come out to play with us, but she just brushed it off and said that she just wanted to play with him. I didn’t question it further and left the room, thinking it was just a toddler thing. But I had to admit, I was getting a little hurt that my daughter didn’t want to play with her mother anymore. But I decided to not push the matter and let her be her.  
  
Later that night, as I lay in bed, I felt it again. I woke up feeling a presence close by, staring at me. But just as I sat up in bed, that feeling was gone just quickly as it came. I turned on the light next to me, only to see an empty room once more. I rubbed my eyes tiredly, from both lack of sleep and annoyance. I chalked it up to my own imagination getting the best of me again. I looked out the door towards Bella’s room, thinking that she must have woken up in the middle of the night. I climbed out of bed to check up on her, but after seeing that she was still asleep, I went back to bed and fell right back to sleep, completely forgetting what had just happened.  
  
A couple days later, I was getting the table set up for dinner when my daughter came over to me, looking at the floor with sad eyes.  
  
“Mommy,” she said softly, “I’m sorry.” I was taken aback by her sudden apology.  
  
“What for sweetie?” She looked up at me with those sad green eyes.  
  
“Because I don’t play with mommy,” she said. “Max says I need to play with mommy more.” I was confused by this, but I could see that she was genuinely sad about it. I knelt down to give my poor baby a big hug.  
  
“It’s okay sweetie,” I said. I was moved by her maturity and awareness of how I was feeling. I guess her imaginary friend was a way for her to express how she was feeling. “How about we play together after dinner?” Bella’s eyes lit up and a huge smile appeared.  
  
“Okay mommy!” I giggled as I booped her nose, causing her to giggle as well. Then an idea came to mind.  
  
“How about I set another plate for Max?” I asked. “That way I can thank him for caring about me.” Bella’s smile grew wider.  
  
“Okay!” With that, she ran upstairs to her room. I smiled as she ran off and went to the kitchen to grab another plate for our ‘guest.’ I knew this was a little childish, but if it made my baby happy, then I was willing to play along. I also thought of this as another way to bond with my child. A couple minutes later, Bella came running back downstairs.  
  
“Is Max coming for dinner?” I asked, thinking that he was right next to her. But she shook her head.  
  
“No,” she answered. “Max doesn’t want to come out.” I looked curiously at her.  
  
“Why not?”  
  
“Because Max says that he doesn’t want to scare Mommy.” I was confused by this. How could he possibly scare me?  
  
“Oh I’m sure that he won’t scare me, sweetie.” But Bella shook her head.  
  
“I know. But Max still wont come down.”  
  
“Well then when can I meet Max?” Bella looked up towards the stairs before turning back to me.  
  
“He says that he’ll come out when he feels you’re both ready.” I gave up and put the extra plate back in the kitchen. To be honest I was kind of relieved. At least I didn’t have to pretend I was having a conversation with an imaginary friend. Soon my husband came home from work and we all sat down for a lovely dinner.  
  
As the days went by, Bella and I began to play in her room more often. I was a lot happier now that Bella wanted me around more rather than playing with her imaginary friend. I was beginning to think that she was growing out of this phase. She would still play with Max in her room from time to time, but she would always make time to play with me. Things were simpler now and were starting to feel normal. I couldn’t be happier.  
  
But then one day, everything changed.
