It was the itching that was the worst. A few days of non-stop itching. Then one morning it was a little thing growing on my back. Felt like a nipple, if a nipple was oozing pus and blood, and sent shooting pain up my body when I touched it. It sat right above the waist of my pants. I spent my whole day contorting myself into a pretzel to try to claw away at whatever was happening back there. I couldn’t help but squeeze it. It felt good to press my fingers together, feel the pain as the liquid threatened to blast through my skin. Feel the hard lump of whatever was under the surface, waiting to emerge. Every so often I'd feel a squish and a pop and my fingers would get slick and damp, come away with blood or a bit of yellow white pus, almost cream, and the itching would subside for a minute. And then the itching would start again. Eventually I got accustomed to the circular timing of it. Itch, scratch, itch, scratch, pop, gush, slick, relief, itch.  When I got home I looked at it in the mirror. Raised patch of skin, and maybe three centimeters across. And red, violently red. Crusted in blood and pus. Then I noticed something I wasn’t expecting. Hair, coarse dark hair. Ingrown hair, I thought, simple. Happened before, you yank it out, infection clears, Bob's your uncle. I got my tweezers and worked at it for a while, but I couldn’t get a good grasp. After an half hour of working this tiny metallic torture device all around the hole in my back, I gave up and asked a professional for help. 

I rapped on my neighbor’s door. “Tony?”

“Comin’ mate.”  

Tony was waking up from a nap.

“Tony, this is a, well it sucks, but I need your help.”

“What’s up?”

“‘I’ve got something stuck in my skin. I need you to help get it out.”

“Alright mate. Show us what you’ve got.”

I turned, lifted my shirt. 

“Wow. That’s…well I’d better get some gloves. Come on in.”

“Real sorry mate, I’ll owe you a sixer.”

“For this I’ll take it.” 

We’re in Tony’s bathroom, which is spotless. Tony’s a medic, which is why I knew he’d be bloke for the job. He’s got tweezers and gauze and fluids and I don’t know what else. 

“This is gonna hurt, I’ve got to get in there to excise any infectious tissue.”

“What you reckon it is? 

“If you’re lucky, just a blocked hair follicle. If not, screwworm maybe.” Tony smiled a mischievous smile. 

“Screwworm?”

“Yeah, the larvae burrow into wounds. Turn like screws to dig themselves in. Mean suckers, hurts like hell coming out. D’ya know, they can lay up to 500 eggs.”

“Not helping mate!”

“I think I got something.”

I watched as Tony used tweezers to yank on the hair. He pulled, and it opened, blood burst from the wound, splashing Tony’s mirror, sink, and the face shield he wore. 

“Nice! Look at that!”

Tony kept pulling, one slickly red strand of hair becoming two, then a dozen, then a handful of hair coming out of a ragged, open, bloody hole above my ass. He pulled and pulled until his sink was full of sopping wet blood drenched black hair. Then he started digging with a finger, and I started to scream. Eventually he pulled his hand out of the hole in back. 

He held something up in his fingers, studying it. “What in the world?”

Through clenched teeth I spat, “What is that?”

“We’ve got to get you to the hospital mate. This is something else. It’s a tooth. I pulled out a tooth.”

In the operating room, numbed from the spine down. My whole naked backside being worked on by a mess of doctors. One of ‘em asks, “were you born via IVF?” 

“No idea gov.”

“I mean, the only reason for this much organic material to occur at this site would have to be a chimera, right?”

Another one speaks up. “Would make sense wouldn’t it? It’s not like he ingested it.”

I try to turn to catch an eye. “What would make sense?”

A third says, “But fetal death almost always happens in utero, for it to have developed and grown this much. I would assume that he would have had tumorous growth.”

“Have you had tumors in your midsection before?”

“Not that I know of. Please tell me what’s going on?”

“I believe, and we’ll have to look into it. I think you must have absorbed a twin. A parasitic twin that’s been growing inside you for your whole life. A twin that burst out of you today like it was being born.”
