Have you ever had the feeling that you’re being watched, like eyes are prying into you, trying to dig their way deep into your soul? Because that’s how I’ve felt for the past two days. I don’t know what to do, or how I can make it stop. I’ve never posted on something like this before, but at this point I’m willing to try anything, I’m desperate for some advice.

I’ll take you back to the start, or what I assume to be the start of it all. 

I live a fairly ordinary life. I’m a 21 year old guy, living on his own in a bit of a rundown flat, commuting to work on the train everyday. This doesn’t leave me a lot of spare time for anything else, really, because my commute is an hour each way. My days consist of waking up at 6:30, getting dressed, walking to the train station, catching the train, walking to work, working, and then doing the same process in reverse. That’s it. I don’t really have any friends to hang out with, and I’m not exactly on the best terms with my family (for reasons I won’t go into here), so I sit on my own each evening, watching TV or playing video games. I keep myself to myself, and get on with my life.

Now, you may be thinking that my life sounds pretty miserable or boring, but to me, it’s perfect. I’ve always been a bit of a loner, so my daily routine suits me perfectly, and I’ve been living happily like this for the past year. 

That is, until a dream I had 3 nights ago.

Like all dreams, it didn’t have a beginning. I was simply there, no recollection of opening my eyes in this new place, or how I’d got there. I was standing in the middle of a large grassy field. I could feel the wind blowing gently on my face, and I ran my hand through the large grass strands that stretched up from the ground to meet me. I looked around, and realized I was alone. The field was empty, save for a lone tree, a few hundred feet away from me. I started to make my way over to it, not knowing why I was doing so, but just having the feeling that there was something there I needed to see. As I got closer, I could make out the faint shape of letters carved into the wood. From where I was standing, I couldn’t quite make out what they were, and so I decided to get closer for a better look.

And that’s when I felt it for the first time. Even in my dream, the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and a chill went down my spine. I could tell that I was no longer alone. Someone else was here, watching me. I span myself around, and caught the first glimpse of *them*. They were far away, so far away that all of their features were obscured by the distance. All I could make out was a featureless shadow, standing in the grass, watching me. I stood for what seemed like hours, just staring back at them, unsure of what to do. 

And then they started to run.

The figure lurched forwards with impossible speed, heading straight for me. Instinctively, I span back around and began to take off in the opposite direction, towards the tree. The words on the tree were becoming clearer, but I still couldn't make out what they were yet. As I ran through the grass, trying desperately not to trip on the uneven terrain, I glanced behind me to ascertain how much distance I had left between me and my pursuer.

Not much. 

It had impossible speed, coming at me like a steam train, closing the gap between us in a matter of seconds. It would only be a few more until it was on me. I began to panic and tried to pick up my pace, but as is the curse of most dreams, I was running at a snail's pace. My foot slipped, and I was sent crashing to the ground. I flipped over just in time to see my pursuer pouncing on top of me. I could see now that it was not the distance that had caused it to look featureless. It was featureless. Just a black hole of pure energy in the shape of a person. It brought its ‘hands’ up to my face, placing them on either side of my eyes. I began to cry and plead with it, begging it not to hurt me. It didn’t listen. Instead, it plunged it’s dark thumbs into my eye sockets, blocking my vision and causing me to scream out in pain.

And then I was awake, screaming still.

I scanned my room, looking for the creature, but I was alone.

“Fucking stupid nightmare.” I muttered to myself as I led back down, trying to slow my breathing and calm myself down. I managed to eventually get back to sleep, and awoke at 6:30 to my normal alarm buzzing next to me. I got up and began to get ready for work as normal, when my mind drifted back to my nightmare. I tried to think of the letters I had seen carved into the wood of the tree, but all I could remember were,

“Erom ecno niks ym no enihs”

There was still a lot more carved into it, but in my panic I couldn’t make out the rest. 

“Whatever,” I thought to myself.

I left my building and began my walk to the train station, the thoughts of my dream already beginning to fade from my memory, chalked up t o nothing more than a stupid dream caused by a scary video game or something. 

You’d be surprised by how quiet the streets are in a big town at 7am. No one trying to sell you things, no one bumping into you or pushing past, most of the time it’s just me and the road. Nice and quiet. It was the same on Thursday morning, but as I got closer to the train station, I began to get a familiar feeling. The hairs on the back of my neck began to stand up, and I felt a chill run down my spine. I turned around slowly, hoping to just see another commuter making their way to work behind me.

The street was still clear, with no sign of anyone else having been there other than me. I breathed a sigh of relief and shook my head, thinking that the previous night’s dream was just playing tricks on my mind. However, as I began to turn my head back in the direction I was traveling, my eyes caught a glimpse of someone, standing behind a lamppost. Only half of their body was visible, the other half hidden behind the metal pole. They were standing about 200 meters from me, so I couldn’t easily make out any of their features. All I could see was an eye, glistening in the reflection of the streetlight. Whoever it was was watching me, motionless. I stood for a moment, debating what to do.

I brought my hands up to my face and momentarily covered my eyes as I rubbed them. When I removed my hands once more, the figure was gone.

I let out a faint laugh, cursing myself for being so stupid as to believe someone was watching me. It was most likely just someone making their way to work, just like me. They had momentarily stopped to look at me, the only other person on the street, just as I had done to them. And then they had moved on, got on with their day, just as I had to do now as well.

The rest of the day went by as usual, with nothing out of the ordinary to report, that is, until I was on the way home. I got on the train home as I normally would, and we set off back towards my home town. There are a number of stops between where the train begins and where it ends, with the carriages steadily becoming quieter and quieter as the journey progresses. By the time it reaches the final stop, I am normally the only person left in the carriage, which I am more than okay with, as it means no one has to sit next to me.

As the train slowed to ready itself for the next station, I felt my hairs stand on end once more. I sighed at myself. 

“Not again” I thought, wishing that my brain would stop playing tricks on me. It was clearly hanging onto the dream more than I had thought, and was not letting not go any time soon. The train slowed to a halt, and the doors hissed open to allow any passengers to get off. It was a quiet station in the evening, and so the platform was deserted, save for the shape of a lone person standing at the far end of the platform. It had been raining, and so my window was covered in thin streams of water, obscuring the figure and making it seem as though they were a strange shape - almost as if you were looking at yourself in a funhouse mirror. Their body seemed twisted and deformed, no longer even resembling the shape of a human. The thought of it sent more chills down my spine, and as the doors hissed shut and the train pulled off, I silently thanked the gods that we weren’t delayed.

When I climbed into bed that night, I prayed that my brain wouldn’t force me to experience another one of its concoctions, and that I would just be able to forget the whole thing had ever happened. But my mind, once again, had other plans.

I was standing in the middle of a crowded street, streams of people passing around me. I glanced down and found that I was dressed in my work clothes, consisting of a shirt, tie and smart pants. I felt at the tie, and let it slip through my fingers. The silk felt so real. I looked back up to the street and found myself surrounded by staring faces. Everyone had stopped what they were doing and were staring at me, their mouths hanging slightly open in a look of shock and awe. And when I say everyone, I mean everyone. All those sat in coffee shops, in the flats above me, and in cars all stared at me through the glass of their windows, the same expressions resting on their faces. They were unmoving, unbreathing, unfeeling. All emission had drained from them, as though they were statues.

And then as one, they took a step closer. Faces squished against the windows as those inside the buildings tried to get closer, seemingly unaware there was something in the way. I began to panic as the space between me and the crowd lessened as they moved closer once more. They were a single organism, moving together as though the individual bodies were simply limbs controlled by one malevolent force. There was now only a meter between me and the nearest person, and this gap was closed before I was able to react. I felt hands grabbing at me, ripping my shirt, grasping my tie and pulling it, tightening it’s grip around my throat and cutting off my oxygen supply. 

“Please… stop!” I choked, pushing and shoving at the mass of bodies, desperate to get them away. I was met with a deafening reply, as every mouth began chanting the same thing. My memory of what they were saying is pretty hazy, but from what I can remember, it sounded something like,

“Uy ma e, em era uy”

The voices were dark, inhuman. I felt as though my eardrums would burst at the volume of the chanting, the vibrations reverberating through my body. I was being crushed from all sides, my clothes being ripped off, my skin being ripped at and scratched by unrelenting hands. I cried out in pain, and as with the previous night, I was awake, still screaming.

I looked at my hands and found that I was shaking. My ears were ringing, as though they had been exposed to a high volume in the night. I picked up my phone and checked the time - 5:47. 

“Screw it.” I thought to myself, there wasn’t a chance I was going back to sleep after that. I climbed out of bed and walked to my bathroom. I splashed cold water onto my face in an attempt to wake myself up and make me think rationally about the situation. All that had really happened was I had had a couple of bad dreams, and seen two people obscured by various things. That was it. Nothing unnatural about that. I breathed slower now, the rational side of my brain slowly beginning to take hold.

As I brought my head back up to look at myself in the mirror, I noticed a shadow standing in my shower, obscured by the shower curtain that had been pulled across. I gasped and my blood ran cold. I was frozen by fear as I stared into the reflection. Whoever was in the shower was facing the mirror as well, their shape clearly visible. They were unmoving, as still as a statue.

I slowly turned myself around to face the curtain, the shape of the intruder still visible. Tears began to form in my eyes as I reached out a hand. I grasped the fabric, and in one quick motion, yanked the curtain across to expose the figure.

It was empty. I let out an audible mix of relief and fear as I brought my shaking hands up to my head.

I went into work early that day.

I couldn’t really focus properly on what I was doing, my mind filled with thoughts of my follower. Whatever it was, it wasn’t a figment of my imagination. I had definitely seen a figure standing in my bathroom, watching me. It had been in my flat. Feet away from me.

I travelled home as usual, thankfully not having the feeling I was being watched at all. I stepped off the train onto the platform and followed the few others that had got off down the nearby stairs that led to the exit. The stairs lead down to a small tunnel under the station, lit by crappy lights that flicker occasionally. At the end of the tunnel is a corner where a set of stairs live, leading up to the entrance of the station. Next to this corner is a mirror, placed onto the wall near the ceiling, allowing you to see if anyone is about to turn the corner, preventing you from bumping into them. As I neared the corner, I glanced up at the mirror, and found that there was someone standing just round it. They were wearing a shirt that seemed to be two sizes too small for them and a tie that looked as though it was choking them. A mass of lumpy skin bulged through the gaps between the shirt’s buttons. I stopped in my tracks, just before the corner. I looked into the mirror closer, and even though they were hunched over, I could see that the person’s head was deformed, as though it was just piles of skin thrown together clumsily. I could hear it wheezing, as if the simple act of breathing was causing it immense pain. I could feel tears beginning to well in my eyes again as I felt my hairs stand on end once more.

“Shit, shit shit.” I whispered to myself, trying to hype myself up just enough to make the three steps to the turn. Every part of my body wanted to turn around and run in the opposite direction, but I resisted. I was startled by a shout from behind me, and turned around to see the cause, only to find a group of kids running down the steps, cheering and joking with each other. I turned back to face the mirror, and found that the figure was gone again. Just like in the morning. I took a few shaky steps forward and turned the corner, confirming that there was no one there.

And then last night, I had the worst dream yet.

I found myself standing back in my bathroom, brushing my teeth. I could taste the mint of the toothpaste as I brushed, spitting out the foam into the sink below. I brought my head back up and stared at myself in the mirror. I was met with a twisted, deformed version of myself, smiling maniacally at me. I stepped backwards, and he stepped forwards, his head protruding from the glass as though it were an open window. A crooked, broken hand reached up onto the frame, and in one smooth motion, the body slithered out pulling itself through. It flopped onto the sink, smacking its head onto the porcelain and causing it to bleed. I fell backwards as I retreated, stumbling into the bathtub. I sat and watched in horror as the being got to its feet, the bones cracking as it twisted it’s broken body around to face me. The mirror-me continued to smile as he began to move towards me. At this point, I was paralyzed with fear as he began the same chant as the previous night.

“Uy ma e, em era uy. Uy ma e, em era uy.”

“Please… please don’t hurt me!” I cried as the shaking, twisted hands reached out towards my face. I turned my face away from the creature and braced myself for the inevitable. 

When I opened them again, I was back in my bed. My breathing was heavy, and my head hurt. I groaned as I sat up. I raised my hand and rested it on my forehead, trying to nurse the pain. When I made contact with my skin, I found that I was covered in something sticky. I pulled my hand away and grabbed my phone, shining the torch onto my palm.

It was covered in blood.

I felt my forehead again and could feel a deep cut in the flesh. I winced in pain as I touched it, and realized that the wound was extremely fresh. I tried my best to clean the wound in the bathroom, and wrapped a bandage from my first aid kit around my head.

In the hallway outside my flat, the lights are controlled by a movement sensor. It’s pretty bad, and only stays on for a few seconds, even if you keep moving. As I walk back to my bedroom, I notice that the light is on outside. I walk up to the door, and double check the lock. The light goes off as I get nearer, but as I turn away from the door, I see it switch back on, the light glowing under the door. 

I move back into my bedroom, and open my laptop. That is where I am now, writing this, asking for help. I don’t know what to do, or how I can stop this. All I know is that whatever is following me, it’s getting closer, more confident. I know it is outside my door, the hair on the back of my neck is on end.
