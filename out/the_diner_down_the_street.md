around two decades ago, when i was small stood there a diner called “Mitzies Diner”. the diner had been there for years serving customers left and right. but this was no ordinary diner.

the diner was primarily staffed of just animatronics. these animatronics were mostly as the ‘furry friends down the street.

when i was little my parents couldn’t afford to go there often but we went for birthdays and special occasions but soon later the diner had shut down due to the animatronics had rusted and apparently no kid liked them anymore.

for the last couple years of being a teenager the place had been abandoned and the property had never been sold due to strange occurrences that happened to people who had tried to buy it.

last week for my 19th birthday i stayed with a friend in my home town. after i moved out, my parents had moved to colorado because they said they’ve always wanted to go.

while staying at my friend i noticed the untouched building  of mitzies still standing where i remember. i had been at the car at the time but still i could feel the pull to the building. like something had whispered to my brain that i needed to go inside.

later during the week my friend went to go have quality time with her boyfriend so i decided i would venture to the abandoned building of the place i once knew as the greatest place on earth.

upon arriving to the building, i soon realized that there was not much security around the building. maybe the building was considered useless or just not important enough to keep safe.

when i entered the building, it still had the warm welcoming feeling i had always felt when i arrived at mitzies. looking around already i could see figures all around.

it was dark and the only thing lighting up  room was the thin light coming from my phone. then suddenly on command the power turned on.

i jumped back in fear realizing that the furry friends i had know for so long had looked sad and rusted but still kept the molded smiles on their faces as the fabric on their metal skeletons slowly peeled off.

soon after i realized that the power had seemingly turned on by itself. i shrugged off the feeling of something watching me come into the building and just played off that power came on due to the motion sensors in the building.

i walked around a bit looking at all the animatronics. i could name them all off in my head. sally the sassy seal, gina the giant giraffe, greg the graying goat, and peter the practical penguin. through the diner there were mini server animatronics that had a tray in their hands at all times.

these animatronics stood in a line waiting to get their command to serve the meals to the right tables. the servers were also minor characters in this franchise.

toby turtle, ruby rabbit, and holly horse. i could hear some of them saying their catchphrases they would always say once in a while. phrases like “have a rocking day!” or “eat your food before i do! yum!!”. 

the main cast sat on a stage in the back of the diner. i walked over to see them. the closer i walked the more i could hear cracked or knocks coming from floors or walls or even from other rooms in the building. 

as soon as i got close enough to the band they started playing. this song i recognized as their main song. this song i had memorized by heart as a kid. the animatronics started to move as they sang this song but their voices were warped and sounded muffled.

after being sort of mesmerized by the singing creatures i started to look around at the other rooms. in one of the rooms i found an arcade. i had completely forgot about it due to me not playing them as a kid.

i was always short and i couldn’t reach some of the machines so i just gave up in total. while looking around in the arcade i saw tokens scattered on the floor along with some prizes which i thought was weird because as a kid why would someone leave the prizes in the building?

on some of the games they had signs that were taped on. most of them said out of order so i just left.

after i went out in was totally silent in the main room where the band was one playing just a second ago. the animatronics was completely quiet until the stage lit up once again.

but the friendly band i had once knew had not in fact started singing but instead started talking which is was they did in between songs.

i walked up to the stage to watch where they were saying. peter the penguin finally said “boys and girl i hope you’re having a rocking saturday! but it’d be better if you get out!”

i was taken a back by the words that just came out of the animatronics mouth which was different than the speakers that were on the stage.

just then the animatronics turned their flopping bodies to me. for just a second it looked like the animatronics had real eyes. the eyes were bloodshot and wide open.

the animatronics one by one started yelling get out in a higher pitch voice kind of like  kid would. “GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT” they started screaming at me. 

my stomach dropped hearing the word but i turned around to see a figure in the corner. it was long dark and i could feel the evil aura from across the room. i didn’t have time to thing before i saw the door swing open.

i booked it for the door seeing the ghosts of children running behind me using their e every to fight off the dark aura in the diner. i ran until i got back to my friends house and locked the door to the guest room. i huffed and slid  down the door as i though about what just happened. i had realized i never did research on the place.

i got out my laptop from off the desk and sat on the bed and looked up the reason why mitzies actually closed. after looking it up i found that randy sulkman, the owner of the diner had killed four children before the diner open and shoved their bodies in the animatronics. and with every new animatronic, he had killed another kid. 

in the end there ended up being 11 kids dead. peter, sally, gina, greg, ruby, toby, holly, billy, sonia, mario,and jean. after the cops had figured out what randy had did they were going to arrest him when they found him dead in his office, it looked it had been a murder but the death had still being undetermined.

thinking back i had realized that those kids had saved me from whatever randy could have done to me. later looking in my bag i had seen 11 plushies, one of each character.
