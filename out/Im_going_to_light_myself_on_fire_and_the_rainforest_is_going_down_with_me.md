Hi, all. I don’t usually post on Reddit, but I’m at my wit’s end and I don’t know what else to do. My eyes have crystals in them. Nobody else will believe me and the guilt has been driving me insane. I can’t think straight. I apologize for the rambling; I’ve never been one for telling stories, but if I don’t do this now, the truth about what really happened will never be told. I owe it to her to at least put this out somewhere. I’ve just been so ashamed. I’m sorry, Eve. I’m a real piece of shit and you deserved better. Now, I can only hope that we’ll all go down in flames.   
  
\--  
  
Five months ago, my girlfriend and I went on an anniversary trip to the Amazon rainforest. While we had only been together for a year, Eve was an incredibly sentimental person, taking great joy in planning and celebrating small anniversary events for each month that we’d been dating. The first month, she’d treated us to dinner at the museum where we’d had our first date. My salmon rolls were overpriced and stale, but when you’re lucky enough to be in the presence of the most stunning woman in the world, almost every moment is something to be savored. Speaking of our first date; it happened spontaneously the first time we met, which is not something I’d ever imagine myself saying. It was a particularly nasty winter that year, and I had some time to kill after work that day, so I took a long walk to an uptown art museum. With no real plan or initiative, I meandered my way through the exhibits, pausing to sketch anything that caught my eye, when I felt someone behind me tapping on my shoulder. I turned around and, wow. An angel. No, a literal angel tattoo on her right hand, tufted plumes of feathers radiating outward and snaking up her forearm. “I like your tat-” I tried to choke out before she repeated her question, “what’s your favorite piece from this period?” Huh? “You know…” she gestured towards the display case that I didn’t even realize I had been sketching. Perhaps pitying my social ineptitude, she picked up the conversation and explained her own personal interest in the complexities of mid 1800s glass production. Two hours later, we were holding hands in front of a medieval suit of armor and she gave me a peck on the cheek. Right then and there, I knew she was the one.   
  
We had both planned for the first year anniversary trip well in advance, spending months scraping together what little disposable income we had to purchase tickets to Ecuador. Growing up vicariously exploring the jungle through the lens of nature documentaries, it had been Eve’s dream to visit the Amazon rainforest and finally experience, in person, the beauty and perils in equal measure that she had been so enthralled with on the clunky beige computer of her childhood home. This fascination eventually manifested itself in the form of “piles upon piles of library books” and, later on, “midnight excursions down the great Wikipedia Rabbit Hole”. She was always so happy to share her love for the rainforest, dispensed through various tidbits of knowledge, hoping that it would rub off on me. “Hey,” she'd say, “did you know three-toed sloths are three times stronger than the average human? They’re also excellent swimmers. We’re lucky they’re so sl-ooooow,” and, “did you know there’s a little parasitic fish that swims up peoples’ urethras while they’re swimming in the Amazon river?” “Eeeew, Eve. How is that one a fun fact? That’s just gross.” “Yeah, but like, only people with junk, so we’d be okay,” …and so on. So while I wasn’t surprised when she’d asked, fists practically clenched with anticipation, if we could do this very special trip for a very special occasion, I’d initially been on the fence about the whole idea, leaning strongly towards the side of not encountering abnormally strong xenarthran mammals or creepy parasitic fish.   
  
For one, between our meager customer service salaries and the astronomical and still-somehow-rising prices of rent, saving up for such a trip would take nothing short of a Herculean effort. I was also something of a homebody who was more than content to remain in the familiar confines of the city. My only wilderness experience was that of a summer camping trip that my cousins and I went on in the Catskills when I was a little kid. I remember it being a wholly unpleasant slog, getting sick from licking hot chocolate powder straight from the bag and being devoured alive by mosquitoes. Knowing this, Eve had taken my dislike for the non-air-conditioned into consideration and proposed a sort of compromise. “Serenity Rainforest Villa,” the website boasted, “is an all-inclusive luxury retreat into the beautiful Amazon Rainforest of Ecuador. Explore the Amazon through engaging private tours with our world-class guides, and surround yourself with the comforts of your own fully-furnished cabin. We guarantee that you will have the experience of a lifetime.” Scrolling down, picture after picture of exuberant tourists filled the screen. Eve signaled for me to stop scrolling. “Look, Mina, I think that’s a saki monkey! Look how cute it is!”  
  
The enthusiasm on Eve’s face as we sifted through the site was infectious, and over the course of the next few days, I couldn’t help but let myself be convinced that this trip could be a good way for me to reconnect with the outdoors, and yes, the monkeys were admittedly very, very cute. Escaping the gray sludge of another unusually cold winter for an entire week was also an undeniable bonus. More than anything, though, I really wanted to make my girlfriend happy. I’d made a big show of grumbling and muttering about being coerced into something I had no say over in the first place, but she’d received her answer the next day in the form of a field guide book. Eve hugged me tight as I melted, a long hug that persisted all throughout the summer and fall. More days than not, we’d collapse from exhaustion once we got home after working extra shifts, but we both pushed on with fervor, knowing that it would all be worth it.   
  
And that’s how months of our quite literal blood, sweat, and tears lead us to a cheerful, nondescript green dock on the Amazon river. Our guide, Albert, was waiting for us next to the speedboat that would bring us to the resort. A chatty yet stoic man with a permanently furrowed brow, Albert was a father of two, spending half of his time as a tour guide, the other half as an English teacher, and the third half, he joked, parenting his children. He was from a small village nestled deep within the rainforest and grew up fishing alongside his brothers. A few times a month, he and his brothers would paddle their boat filled with their prized salt-preserved fish to a larger trading village to barter for other goods. Albert was particularly fond of books and had never failed to leave the post without one or two on every trip, purchased with his cut of the allowance. This was how he had taught himself English over the years.   
  
“You two chose a good time to come, it’s the wet season right now,” he explained as we glided over the muddy waves,” lots of people mistake the wet season for the rainy season, but the river is actually rising due to melting snow from the mountains. Organic debris gets swept in along the way, so keep your eyes out for manatees and pink river dolphins.” Eve’s eyes widened as she all but craned her head out of the window, making Albert laugh. “Here, we have an old myth about the pink river dolphins. Boto encantado, they come out of the water at night disguised as handsome men. They dance all night with the women in the villages, and take them to the underworld by the morning.” Eve remained silent, staring intently at the water. “The boat ride will take two more hours, and the other guests will have already arrived. You two should nap if you’re tired. By the time we get there, dinner will be ready.” Eve and I both took in as many sights as we could during the first hour of the boat ride, but a combination of several hours of restless plane rides and the gentle rocking motion of the waves eventually lulled us into a peaceful sleep.   
  
“...wake up, get excited, we’re here,” Albert’s voice drifted into our ears as he nudged the back of our seats, “we’re just in time for dinner, let’s go.” He steadied the boat against another little green dock as I rubbed the sleep from my eyes, finally taking in just how magnificent the place really was: four covered wooden walkways, each corresponding to a cardinal direction, balanced precariously on an intricate network of stilts, creating a sort of compass. At the farthest bounds of the compass, barely visible from my vantage point, private cabins nestled in the lush foliage. The center of the compass, distinctly established by the converging walkways, housed a circular courtyard and an absolutely enormous thatched hut that towered spectacularly over the trees. “This is the Big Lodge,” Albert announced, “used as the common and dining areas. Here, you can chat with the other guests between activities at all hours of the day. You have meal vouchers for two meals a day, to be eaten whenever you’d like before nine p.m. Breakfast is complimentary, but you have to get here early between six and eight a.m if you want any. Kitchen and upstairs staff area are off-limits. Got it?” We nodded, following him inside.   
  
While the outside had been hot and humid under the oppressive rainforest sun, the inside of the Big Lodge was an airy refuge that smelled of lemongrass and suntan lotion. String lights dangled from the ceiling, casting dancing specks of light onto a massive polished wooden table below. At the back of the room, a brick wall separated the public guest areas from the private kitchen. Just like our guide had said, the other guests, about a dozen of us total, had already taken their places at the table. Some of them nodded towards us in acknowledgement as we awkwardly shuffled into our seats, and Eve struck up a conversation with a couple to our right who I gradually came to know as Chiara, an energetic thirty-something vet tech with a sonorous laugh, and Matt, her husband, a quiet man with the bluest eyes I had ever seen, rarely caught without the huge camera strapped around his neck. “Matt loves that thing,” Chiara said, playfully punching him on the shoulder, “he got it last Christmas and hasn’t put it down since! It’s practically a part of him now.” Matt smiled sheepishly and snapped a picture of her in response.   
  
Shortly after we had taken our seats, a tall, professional-looking woman with an austere brunette bob strode confidently out of the industrial kitchen door to the head of the table. Dressed in an impeccably fitted white sheath dress, she looked out of place in the middle of the rainforest to the point of absurdity. “Hello, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of all of us here, I’d like to extend to you our warmest welcome to Serenity.” She paused, as if evaluating us for a moment. “My name is Amelia and I will be your events coordinator for the duration of your stay. Please, do not hesitate to ask me any questions or make any requests, anything at all to make your stay here perfect.” She grinned, flashing a mouthful of unsettlingly white teeth, “I know that presently, all of you must be starving. So first, before anything else, let’s eat.”   
  
I was no foodie; back at home, I would’ve probably taken a box of Kraft mac and cheese over just about anything, but the food we had that night might have been some of the best food that I ever had in my life. A tender cut of steak, seasoned with herbs whose names my mouth could not make the proper sounds for, practically melted upon hitting my tongue. Accompanying it was a side of vibrant orange rice, stewed in a rich tomato broth, and a small ramekin of creamy scalloped potatoes. Around us, the other guests murmured in approval. “Isn’t this amazing, Mina?” “I didn’t know food could taste this good,” I replied, and Eve reached for my hand under the table. “I’ll ask them the recipe,” I said, interlocking my fingers with hers, “I’ll ask them the recipe, and I’ll learn how to make this stuff, and we can eat it every day until we get tired of it or we run out of money…if you’d like that.” “Of course. I’d love that, Mina. I love you.”  
  
I love you. I love you. It echoed through my mind as we headed down the south walkway, scurrying past a disturbing amount of tarantulas that had begun to congregate under the soft beams of the overhead lights. I love you, I giddily thought as we drifted off to sleep in our cabin, just the two of us, serenaded by the rhythmic lullabies of millions of frogs and giant, neon-colored cicadas. When the sun began to rise, this nighttime song ebbed away, replaced by all manner of shrieks and trills and chatter of birds, and the whole canopy erupted into a cacophony of conversation. I could barely hear a thing. I was in a trance, I was floating. We’re really, actually here, and it’s not a dream. She’s happy, and we’re in love. And so, in this way, the first two days passed in a blissful daze. We woke up to the chorus of birds, began our ritual of fastidiously applying sunscreen and bug spray onto each other, and made our way up to the Big Lodge, where we ate breakfasts of pancakes and scrambled eggs with Chiara and Matt.  
  
After breakfast, Albert took us on walking and boat tours along the Amazon river, joined by his teenage son, Victor, a soft-spoken boy who acted as a lookout for animals of interest in the canopy. Time after time, he would point at something that we could not see. A toucan, perfectly camouflaged as a splotch of brown, perched on top of a tree. A flock of green parrots, from a distance near indistinguishable from the fruits that they ate, preparing to take flight. A family of spider monkeys, nimbly making their way through a maze of branches, undetected. And while at first we could not see them, eventually our eyes had learned to adjust. “When you see one, you see them all,” Victor said, and quickly, one spider monkey turned into a group of fifty, peering curiously down at us from the trees. When Eve spotted the macaw before Albert or Victor managed to, our little party broke out into a round of applause, and she positively beamed with pride.   
  
After the nature walks, we stopped by the dining area for short lunch breaks before continuing on with our afternoon activities. We went swimming in the murky, vaguely chthonic water of the aptly named blackwater section of the river. Eve did, at least. “It’s perfectly fine, I promise,” she said, twirling around in the water, attempting to coax me in, “I know it looks scary but it’s this color because of the tannins from the leaves that have fallen in.” I didn’t budge. “It’s good for your skin.” Hesitantly, I dipped my hand in, the water quickly swallowing up my fingertips. I couldn’t see anything past my submerged knuckles. Images of men who turned into dolphins, feeding on the bodies of their hapless victims filled my mind, and I imagined a hand, offering a dance, dragging me down into the darkness. I quickly yanked my hand out.   
  
“Hey! You guys, come here for a sec!” On the evening of the third day, Chiara waved us over as we stepped through the doors of Big Lodge for dinner. “Check this out,” she said, thrusting Matt’s camera towards us. “Our tour guide took us down to the giant lily pad pond today, right? It was nice, but then Matty saw something weird on one of the lily pads off in the distance. When he zoomed in, it turned out to be a vial and some sort of syringe just tossed aside there. And then a couple of yards past that, as we were walking by, we saw an open cage in the undergrowth.” “We thought the vial could have been filled with sedatives, for the catch and release of a large animal, “ Matt added, “Chiara’s betting on a panther. When we pointed it out to our guide, he kind of laughed and changed the subject. Which was strange but you guys have got to take a look at the cage.” Sure enough, the digital display had captured a pixelated yet unmistakable image of an unlabeled glass vial with a syringe. The next image was a much clearer shot of a large, reinforced steel cage. It was immediately obvious that this cage had been badly roughed up: several of the bars were bent in random areas, and a series of indents lined the horizontal beams. Eve shifted in her seat. “Are those…bite marks?” “Seems to be,” Chiara replied, “must have been one distressed panther.” Not wanting to make a fool of myself, I remained quiet, but when Matt next spoke, it was the only question on all of our minds. “...is a panther really strong enough to do that?” he asked, to no one in particular. The four of us sat through dinner in an uncomfortable silence.   
  
“I can’t sleep, Mina.” Eve’s shaky voice woke me from my slumber. I could feel her trembling beside me. “There’s voices coming from the Big Lodge, they’ve all been yelling. I’m scared.” “Shit, what time is it?” I blindly patted around. No sooner had my hand landed on my phone, a low rumble, followed by a deafening FWOOM, much like the blast of a cannon, resonated from the direction of the Big Lodge. The wooden walls of the cabin rocked violently. In my mind, I could imagine the trees outside cleaving in two. For a split second, all sounds of the forest ceased, before picking up with a redoubled frenzy. Eve whimpered, digging her nails into my arm, “what was that? Oh my god, what was that?” 3:22 a.m. The glow of my phone screen illuminated her face with a faint purple light. She was crying. “Hey, hey. It’s alright,” I cooed, taking her head in my arms. “It’s okay. I’m gonna go over there and take a look, okay? Just stay here, and don’t open the door for anyone until I get back.” Eve pressed her face into my chest. “I just want to make sure we’re safe. It’ll only take a few minutes, and I’ll leave the lights on so you don’t have to wait in the dark, alright? …aw, Eve, don’t cry.”   
  
I held her for a bit longer before prying myself from the warmth of the bed and slipping out the door. Whatever happened, it had not gone unnoticed by the other guests. Far off in the distance, I could see lights from some of the other cabins turning on and another guest groggily making their way towards the Big Lodge. 	  
  
The inside of the building had seen a flurry of activity. In the aftermath, the stately communal dinner table which previously stood in the center of the dining area, had been haphazardly pushed into a wall and was now lying on its side. Shattered shards of porcelain and silver cutlery had scattered everywhere. The air felt impossibly dense, and an acrid metallic smell had permeated the room. Muffled voices came wafting through the closed kitchen door. The loudest one came from Albert; I could recognize his distinct rasp. It sounded like he was berating the rest of the group. By then, some of the other guests had also arrived to check out the source of the commotion. We stood there in our tshirts and boxers and nightgowns, unsure of where to stand or what to say to each other, waiting. It was as if some unspoken rule had passed between us: no one should go knock on the kitchen door. And so we waited. A few minutes went by, and Amelia alone came out of the kitchen, wringing her hands. Despite it being well past three in the morning, her hair and makeup were pristine, and she donned a crisp white chef’s coat. She took a second to survey the scene and sighed.  
  
“I’m truly sorry. Please, accept our sincerest apologies for the disruption. Some unexpected circumstances arose, but rest assured, we have the situation fully under control. We don’t wish to trouble you further and it would bring me great relief if you could return to bed and find some sleep-” “I call bullshit,” muttered the guy next to me. Then, louder so Amelia could hear ,“can’t you tell us what exactly happened?” “Yeah,” another guy from the back chimed in, “it sounded like a rocket launcher had gone off in here, and I’m not going to ignore that and go back to sleep.” We nodded in agreement. Amelia’s lips pursed, contemplating her next move. “One moment,” she said, excusing herself before briskly walking back into the kitchen. More muffled voices. Arguing. Amelia came back out, thin frown lines creasing across her forehead. “Very well, then.”  
  
A panther. That’s what Amelia had told us, at least. Two of the chefs had been up, preparing pastries for the next day, when one of them noticed a figure slinking about in the darkened common area through the open kitchen door. Believing it to be a guest in search of a late night snack, the chef had gone out to offer them some food. When it dawned on him what the creature was, he had run into the table in a panic. The other chef, made aware of the dire situation at hand, had fired a signal flare in an attempt to scare off the animal. It had worked, though the sound had woken up the rest of the guides, who slept upstairs, and, more importantly to Amelia, the guests, who she didn’t want to freak out. Eve had been inconsolable after I returned with the news. “Signal flares don’t sound like that,” she’d repeated, over and over, “...do you think this has something to do with what they saw earlier at the pond?” “Well,” I’d replied, “when we see them tomor- today, Chiara will be happy to know that her panther theory was correct.” “No, I mean something else,” her voice trailed off, “...I, I want to go home.” I stroked her hair. “Eve, you know we can’t do that right now. And besides, we only have one more day here anyways. We both worked so hard for this, don’t you think we deserve to enjoy this last day?”   
  
Chira and Matt didn’t show up for breakfast. Eve eyed their empty spots at the table warily. Her pancakes, untouched, were beginning to congeal into a syrupy mess, but her gaze remained transfixed. I wasn’t particularly perturbed; they must have also been startled awake last night, and likely skipped breakfast in favor of sleeping in to catch up on some much-needed rest. Knowing that this would continue to bother Eve for some time, though, I excused myself to look for their tour guide, in hopes that he could offer some reassurance. “Ah, those two,” Javier coughed, waving at another guide passing by behind me, “they left a few hours after dinner last night. I believe one of them had an unpleasant stomach ache. Gave them some Tylenol but Amelia insisted that we take them to the nearest hospital just in case they needed antibiotics for something more serious. It’s a few hours from here by boat, so they should be back any minute now.” He suddenly straightened up. “You and your girlfriend don’t happen to have their contact information by any chance, do you?” “No, unfortunately, we don’t.” Javier slumped back into his seat.  
  
 “...so yeah. Hopefully they’ll be back soon,” I relayed to Eve. She managed a wan, tight-lipped smile, but said nothing. I watched as a fly landed onto the amber puddle of syrup on her plate, but she did not bother to shoo it away. She studied the insect, iridescent blue with a traffic cone orange head, lost in thought.   
  
Albert, Victor, and another couple greeted us at the dock after breakfast. It had taken much cajoling and a dumb joke or two, told at my expense, before Eve had finally allowed herself to cheer up, agreeing to end our trip on a high note. “Evelyn, Minerva. On the off chance that you haven’t gotten to acquaint yourselves earlier, I’d like to introduce you to Bryce and June. Bryce, June; this is Evelyn and Minerva.” “Please, call me Eve.” We exchanged pleasantries. “Due to the events of last night, Amelia has asked for us to travel in larger numbers for safety. It is unheard of for a panther to attack a group of this size, but if such a brave panther were to exist, there’s absolutely nothing in this forest that Victor and I, or any of us guides, for that matter, cannot deal with.” Albert winked.   
  
The rest of the day went by quickly and pleasantly. Albert had navigated the boat out to a flooded clearing, and we lazily drift past the submerged treetops, surreptitiously poking their heads out of the water like endless fields of bean sprouts. Blue morpho butterflies, bigger than my hand, fluttered past us in undulating patterns. Peals of nectar-sweet birdsong echoed from a distance. Eve closed her eyes, letting the fragrant breeze billow through her hair, incandescent locks of copper which had soaked up the warmth of the sun, creating a sort of halo of light around her. I wish we could have remained there in that perfect moment, a snapshot, preserved forever.   
  
“Tonight, we’re going on a special nighttime cruise.” The sun had begun to dip over the treeline, and the orchestra of frogs and insects had started warming up for their nightly performance. “This is a favorite amongst our guests,” Albert explained, switching on a bright flashlight from somewhere at the back of the boat. “We will look for nocturnal animals: caimans, boas, and birds.” “Birds?” “Yes, such as the black-crowned night heron. They have crystals in their eyes, tapetum lucidum, that reflect light and allow for them to see in the dark. Most nocturnal hunters do. That is how we will look for them: you will see the crystals appearing along the banks of the river, so pay close attention.”   
  
As the ray of flashlight danced back and forth along the river’s edge, several pairs of luminescent eyes blinked back at us. Bryce and June oohed and aahed from the bench behind us. It was just like in the movies. When I was a kid, I was obsessed with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I must have watched the movie upwards of twenty times, to the exasperation of my poor parents, and a scene that never failed to terrify me was the one in which Snow White gets chased down by the huntsman in the haunted forest. Gnarled branches grab at her arms and legs while the cruel, piercing bright eyes of owls and bats glare at her from behind every crack and crevice. Caught up in my memories and enchanted by a world that, up until a few days ago, was simply images on a screen to me, I did not initially notice that the forest had gone silent.   
  
Eve was pointing to the back of the boat, where Albert and Victor stood. She was shaking so hard that the boat swayed gently with her, creating ripples in the inky black water. Then, a word whispered so falteringly that I thought I’d misheard it: crystals. Bryce, possibly believing that he was being accused of something, cleared his throat indignantly, “what the-” I spun around, just in time to see Victor, only the mere silhouette of a man now, two glowing white dots where his face had once been, sinking his teeth into Byrce’s head. “That’s right,” Victor mumbled through a mouthful of flesh, spitting out something that clattered against the floor of the boat, “crystals.”   
  
I’m sorry. What happened afterwards is something that my mind has tried to erase. I mostly remember the ringing in my ears. Whether it came from June, or Eve, or myself, I do not recall, but the entire forest opened its hideous mouth and screamed. Now that Victor had made the first move, Albert crouched down on his haunches, eyes flashing in anticipation, eager to join the hunt. Before I had a chance to react, Eve, an indecipherable expression on her face, stood up from where she sat, placing herself between me and Albert. Paralyzed with fear, I could only watch helplessly; I was a statue, a stupid statue cemented to the bench of the boat as he lunged towards us, the thing that I’d so foolishly entrusted with our lives. Eve… Eve, the observant one who had a bad feeling the entire time, who tried her best to warn us, and me, the idiot who had gotten us both killed. I’m such a fuck up. I’m such a fuck- Eve kicked me. Hard. A direct impact to my stomach, forcing the air out of my lungs. Searing waves of pain shot across my abdomen as my body recoiled, spasming. I was too much in shock, choking, unable to find my voice to ask why. For she had saved me. Albert’s jagged yellow nails had only managed to slice the thin web of skin between my fingers before I plunged backwards into the water. She gazed down at me, tenderly, lovingly. Just like she always did when she’d braid my hair and we’d conjure up grand, fantastical plans for our future together. She didn’t look away, not even as Albert laughed and used those nails to slit her throat.  
  
A fisherman found me a few days later. I had been floating next to one of his nets, hysterically babbling about river dolphins. My skin was so severely macerated after days spent drifting in the water that some of it had sloughed off, leaving infected yellow sores all over my body. In broken Spanish, between hiccups, I’d managed to tell him that my girlfriend had been in the water with me, but she hadn’t made it out. “She kept telling me I had to leave, and that she’d miss me, but I didn’t want to leave her. It was so peaceful. Her wings were so beautiful. I begged to be with her for just a few more minutes.‘You really, really have to leave now,’ she was saying, and then her face turned into a dolphin, and she had all these rows of barbed wire teeth. She got mad and chased me to shore. She hates me I think, but we have to go find her.”   
  
The doctors tell me that this is a result of hypoxia; my oxygen starved brain hallucinating as it shut down. I was lucky to have made such a miraculous recovery, they say. Had I remained in the water for any longer, I would have likely met my end. They attribute all of the other things that I’d seen: the “facility” doubling as an innocuous tourist attraction in the middle of the Amazon rainforest was, in their professional opinion, a response to acute trauma. The “manufactured superhuman zombies” that killed my girlfriend along with all of the other tourists were merely stories that I had subconsciously created as a means to process grief. Something like that. I don’t give a shit as to what they have to say. I know what I saw.  
  
I quit my job. I stopped talking to my friends. Hell, I haven’t left my apartment in the five months since I’ve returned home. I no longer eat. I no longer sleep. The news reports describe it as a senselessly violent poacher attack: a band of poachers, witnessed engaging in criminal activity by a group of guests at a remote rainforest resort, indiscriminately slaughter said guests in an attempt to cover up their tracks. The rest of the guests, as well as the resort staff, have been taken hostage. I am the sole survivor, and my story is sold as one of resilience and triumph. I throw a vase at the television. I look up phrases like “Serenity Rainforest Villa”, “Amelia researcher Serenity Rainforest Villa”, “genetically modified creatures in the Amazon Rainforest” online. It’s an exercise in futility: Serenity Rainforest Villa has been scrubbed clean from the internet. For all anyone knows, it has never existed. At night, I stare for hours on end at myself in the mirror as my eyes shine white, reflecting the light from my monitor. On the screen is a picture of Eve and I, drunkenly laughing at the dollar pizza place down the block, not a care in the world.   
  
Whatever they’ve been working on, whatever they turned me into, they probably didn’t expect me to survive. I know they’re still out there, and more than anything, I hope that I’ll be ready. I’ll be booking a flight back to the rainforest, and when I get to where I need to be, I’m torching down the facility and taking the rest of these fuckers with me.
