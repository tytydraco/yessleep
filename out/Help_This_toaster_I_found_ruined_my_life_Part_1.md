February 13th, 2025 - I’m writing this in case something happens to me, at least some unfortunate soul will know what happened. Yesterday me and my friend Rover were playing on an abandoned plane, we loved searching for things forbidden to be searched, and had a love for aerial atrocities. While searching an abandoned plane we found this really cool toaster, it was made of gold and had eyes on its side for some weird reason.  It had the words “GLASHNOK” on it. Me and Rover didn’t know what it meant, god how naive we were. We shrugged and took it home because my mother needed a new toaster because we were poor. Being poor was not always easy growing up, we had no money, and as a result, had no food. I live in Wisconsin.  Funny thing about Wisconsin. Our state is actually known as “America’s Dairyland” for our prominent dairy industry. I do remember my mother always making toast in a toaster for us, because it was our favorite treat. Since dairy was so cheap here, mama could always afford a nice tall glass of milk to wash down the crunchy and satisfying taste of toast.  The toaster was blue and had red outlines, it had the words “hang in there” tattooed on its side with a funny little cat hanging on some rope. Yeah right, like I’d believed that. Whenever I was down I’d flip a penny. 



I used to have a boyfriend named Rover and he was awesome, except for when he’d hit me. I didn’t like that part.  I eventually broke up with him because he kept making mean jokes about my toaster, including calling it stupid and dumb. I kept being his friend because he asked me to so I accepted. Today I was watching “The Hub" when Rover came over, and I said “Hey Rover, you came over!” grinning from ear to ear. He said, “Yes I did, how’s things”. I said “Let’s play Gmod”. And he said “Ok fine but, did you bring the toaster, it’s super cool.” This answer unnerved me, he always was reluctant to play the video games I loved, to just give in wasn’t like him. I gave him the toaster to gaze at anyway, what's the worst that could happen? He threw a firecracker on the ground and ran away. I also noticed my toaster was taken. I knew I had to get revenge on my fallen sidekick and put on my jacket. That toaster was my best friend, if Rover had your best friend you would’ve done the same thing. 



 I knew I had to search for him, that toaster could be sold worth a fortune if it was old or part of some celebrity’s cabin, I needed to sell it for money. Not to mention Rover made the mistake of stealing my best friend.  I went to Rover’s trailer, it was at the edge of town,  I’ve never actually seen the inside of it. But determination built up. I went to his trailer. To put it lightly, the trailer wasn’t well kept. The grass was up to my knees in the front lawn, guess they don’t like mowing the lawn. The trailer was rusting and stained with mud and water damage. One of the windows was broken, it had been for many months.  Unfortunately they had a sign that said “No visitors” so I couldn’t get through. Feeling defeated, I went to go buy an egg. I wandered to the lonely gas station, called “The Lonely Gas Station”. Walking inside the AC hit me like a truck and I almost fell down. It’s been days since I’ve felt the cool breeze of the AC machine. The gas station never changed in years, its worn red and white paint more of a charm than a sign they should remodel, even though they definitely should. I picked up an egg and went to the dusty counter, but something was wrong. A silhouette of a piece of toast was walking. I screamed loud than I remembered I was in a store and quickly stopped the scream. The toast stopped moving and I wanted to scream again. The egg was 40 cents and I screamed at the price, but again, it was a crowded store. I was immediately banned from the store because I didn’t pay for the price of the egg, so much for that endeavour.



 Outside down on my luck I sat on the wet pavement, strange, it rained yesterday. I opened up my tiktok to look up toaster mythology. Apparently in 2021 an Italian man documented his monster hunting channel. I screamed loudly as I saw him enter the same wreck we did once before, he saw this…thing. I’ve never seen anything like it. It had a tall slender body with eyes at the tip of its fingers, with two big empty eye sacks at the front of its face. Its mouth always slack jawed. The more I looked the more real it felt, it didn’t feel like some sort of CGI, I could feel it staring at me through the screen.  Albino in nature, I saw this demon of the night shapeshift into the toaster I used to have. The Italian man took it home and promised to give us updates, but he never uploaded it again. 



Feeling defeated I stuffed the phone back into my pocket as a strange man walked up to me. He was frowning and had the eyes of a lost dog, wearing a fedora and Little Einsteins shirt on, he handed me a small letter addressed to me from “THE FOREST, Wisconsin”. It read: “I am your secret admirer and need you to come to THE FOREST, there you will find what you need”. I told the man “I don’t even know where that is, it’s not on google maps”. He pointed behind him, behind the gas station was a medium sized forest but it was strange since Google Maps never marked it as a location.  I swallowed hard and knew what I needed to do. I told him I didn’t want to go into “THE FOREST” because it sounds spooky. He explained I’d get 5 dollars out of it if I went, and with newfound determination I descended into the forest.



Walking through the forest I saw the sun peek its head through the trees. The smell of pine hit my nose and I smiled, this wasn’t the worst place to investigate.  I saw decaying trees and critters. The critters seemed to fight with each other for survival, god this world we live in. While watching the critters fight I realized something… I was falling and there was nothing I could do to stop it now. I screamed a blood curdling call as my face hit the earth. When I looked up I realized I tripped on a twig, who put that there? Strange, I thought. I brought out my backpack and sat on a log, the wood caressed my skin. I've always liked the woods. I flipped my penny, feeling hopeless, it landed on heads, “THUMMM”. It’s cold metallic body hit my hand and it landed on heads, Strange, I thought. I looked at a picture of me and my toaster having fun, I shed a tear as I reminisced about the simpler times. The picture had me in my red cape zooming around my room with my toaster, having a similar red cape in my arms. I got out a carton of milk, I thought better to drown my sorrows in a dairy treat. At least I could afford milk. While drinking milk I opened TikTok on my phone again, I continued my journey of learning penny tricks. While watching I spun the penny at great speed in my hand like a basketball. Look out MBA, here I come. 



I accidentally spun the penny too hard and it made a THUD noise on the ground. I went to go pick it up, but then…I felt it, a chill ran up my spine as next to the penny, a piece of bread lay lonesome. I could hear someone snicker behind me and arrows came raining down. I looked up and saw 5 masked men holding onto trees, it seemed like they all had shirts with a skull on it, and hockey masks like what you would see out of Friday the 13th. I screamed as loud as I could, picked up my backpack and ran in a random direction out of fear. I could hear the men shouting behind me as the wind started hitting my face, I could have sworn I saw the golden toaster out of the corner of my eye. I eventually stopped to catch my breath, I knew I should’ve joined track. I felt sweat dripping down my forehead as my heart started to steady, I could no longer hear their footsteps.  I needed to rest. There was a small cave on the side of the woods. It could see the water from yesterday still dripping at the top of the cave’s mouth. I prepared my sleeping bag and put down my picture of me and the toaster. This is where I’ll end the journal today, I’ll probably watch some Markiplier and drift to sleep. If any of you have any tips, please let me know.
