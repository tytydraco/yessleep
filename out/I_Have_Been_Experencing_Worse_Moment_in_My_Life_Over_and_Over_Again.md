I need help.



I don’t know if this post will be here for you tomorrow, but I know that I won’t be without your help. I need advice, as crazy as its seems. I am in a time loop. I have seen the same three hours over and over again to the point of becoming numb.



I need  some advice on getting my wife and I out of this. I know that many people come here to share their paranormal experiences and I never quite believed them but I’m desperate.



For context.



It all started when my wife put a positive pregnancy test on the table. The doctor’s said it was impossible for us to conceive naturally but here we were. She was cautiously optimistic and I was happy… But I wasn’t really. I didn’t know how to feel but I decided to keep these feelings to myself for now. 



A few days later she returned back from the doctor’s office and it was confirmed. The baby was 40 days old and then showed a picture of its little heart. She tells me it beats very slow like mine. My resting heart rate is 40 BPM.



At that moment it was beating way over 40 BPM. I didn’t know how to react so it played it off and the second I could I left for a walk. Nothing unusual, I often go for long walks to get my steps in. I broke down on the side of the road. I didn’t cry or anything but just felt so overwhelmed.



I contacted a friend. He was happy for me but when he found I wasn’t happy he tried some real talk. Said either man up or go get the milk. Maybe for someone else that may have been motivating but for me. I just wasn’t ready to hear it. It was nice to get it off my chest though, calming me down enough to head home.



Sometimes I pictured a happy future with my wife and kids and sometimes I pictured my dream of directing films being abandoned and stuck in a crappy customer service job. What if my child is born not so healthy, what if its twins? The stress ate me up inside.



I tried to talk to my wife about it but I couldn’t. I didn’t want to put this stress on her. She always wanted a child and too much stress could cause her to lose the body.  That guilt I couldn’t deal with.



That was the last day the sun rised.



I got a call from my wife asking for me to take an umbrella to her at the subway station. The streets were flooding and she needed my help.  Before I  could say anything the call cut because of the storm and at this point, I knew better than waste time trying to call her back at this point. 



With an umbrella in hand I walked out the front door into the endless storm that was my life. The wind pushed me back as I walked and the small street lamps flickered and shifted in the storm.

 

I then made my way to the stairs safely but quickly descended them. I didn’t wish to fall down these forty steps again. It's a painful waste of three hours. 



The streets were flooded with a brown muddy water that smelled like shit, probably from the sewers but I just walked through it. It was only ankle deep and I honestly didn’t care.



I was halfway there when the same security guard said “Hello”. Always the same intonation and reflection. 



I got sick of hearing it.



As I got closer my heart beat got louder in my ears. IThe intrusive thoughts always happen here. Like maybe I deserve this. For all the bad I have done in my life or the apathy I held to my own unborn child. I am only really being concerned about myself after all, right?



I made it.



Too late again, always late. No matter how fast I ran, sprint, or fast the cars I steal or beg to use I never make it.



My wife is dead, my unborn child is dead. Always hit by the same car with the same crowd of people taking photos as emergency sirens blair all around.



I have no hate left within my heart for the driver, or anything. I am too raw and maybe it’s better if I’m left to rot in this endless loop.



Though I beg of you, my wife and child don’t. I gave you as much details as I could though I am rushed and may have skipped over some things. If you ask me, I’ll tell you anything.



If you can save us, save us please.
