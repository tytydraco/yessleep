So, here's the start.
2 weeks ago I was with some friends of mine exploring an abandoned school. Us being teens we didn't care much, we just looking around, making jokes. Y'know, the usual thing.

One friend of mine, let's call "Dave". 
Dave said "Hey, guys, look in here!", he was down the hall, ahead of us.

Me and my other friends walked to him and looked in the room he had open and was looking in. He had a mischievous look on his face as he looked in.

I looked in along with my other friends and we saw one of those smart TVs the school uses these days. I knew what my friends were thinking and I let them do what they wanted.

My friends started throwing stuff at the TV and breaking it and smashing it with whatever they could find.

Down the hall I heard a distant scratching noise. By the confused look on my friends faces I knew they heard it to. We didn't think much of it, just thinking it was an animal.

I stepped out and looked down the hall, seeing nothing but darkness, I felt off though. Something about the darkness felt off.

Me and my friends left cause there wasn't anything left to do. As we stepped out of the school I felt a pair of eyes watching me. I couldn't see anything so I chalked it up to just the eerie school atmosphere getting to me.

In the silence Dave spoke up saying "hey, did you guys notice anything off about that place?".

My other friend we'll call John he said in reply "what do you mean? I didn't notice anything.".

Dave said "well I coulda swore the place got colder when we got to the gym.".

I didn't say anything cause I didn't know what to say. Dave was right, it was colder then it should be, we were in spring after all.

We got two blocks away from the school when I heard something behind us. I turn around and saw something. I could only just make out it's shape. It had a square top and a half rectangular shape on the bottom. I walked up to it and it was the smart TV from the school.

I looked at Dave and John and they seemed confused to, and our other friend was missing, Jamie was gone! yes he's the quiet type and likes to lack behind but we thought he was behind us. He should've been behind us.

Naturally Dave, John and I turned around and went back to the school. We needed to find Jamie, if he turned up dead it'd be our asses in prison.

When we walked back into the school something was off, it stank, like a skunk got it and over used its spray.

We looked too to bottom of that school but couldn't find Jamie anywhere. I went to the front doors with my friends but, the doors were missing.

My friends and I started to try to get out any way possible but, the windows were blacked out and wouldn't break. At this point we started panicking and didn't know what to do.

Dave started crying, John was doing everything possible to get out.

Whatever was going on, I didn't like it. 

This was 2 weeks ago. 

Me and John are the only ones left, Dave is missing, so as Jamie. Something is in here with us though, me and John made makeshift weapons for if we see it again.

It's huge, larger then anything I've seen, it fits in the school and somehow hides, it's impossibly large, it takes up the whole of the hallways when it shows up. It doesn't have teeth, or even a mouth.

I think it's what took Jamie and Dave, the tentacles of the creature are pink, has sharp ends, and its hunting us.

We had an encounter with it a couple nights(?) ago, I lost track of time. My clock on my phone stopped working, it's been stuck on 3:33PM for what I assume was the time we got stuck here. 

Anyways, were running out of food, the schools supplies don't restock, we started thinning out for a couple days. We have about a months worth of food left.

My phone woulda died awhile ago if the school didn't have power outlets. But the lights won't work. It's confusing.

If anyone has any words to help me and John out of here please help us. I don't know where we are. Last I know we were in Oregon but, I don't think we are anymore. Someone help us. 

I think it's hunting us.
