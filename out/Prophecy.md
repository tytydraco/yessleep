***\[Transcript Begins\]***

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** We’re recording, Mr. Oster.

&#x200B;

**Oster:** Just Bob, please…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Right… Bob. Why don’t we start from the beginning about what happened with Katie. Walk me through the story one more time.

&#x200B;

**Oster:** *\[Silence\]*

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Bob?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** You think I’m a monster, don’t you?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I’m just trying to understand what we uncovered on your property today, Bob. We found your daughter in the river behind your property… you have to understand why we’d regard that as suspicious, right?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** I do…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** So walk me through everything, please. Just one more time.

&#x200B;

**Oster:** You already know it was me… there’s no point in playing coy.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Was it you, Bob?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** *\[Silence\]*

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Bob, I need you to talk to me here.

&#x200B;

**Oster:** I had to do it. I had to get her to stop, somehow… I had to…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Had to get her to stop what, Bob?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** If you saw what I saw, you’d understand. Not just the drawings, those need context, but… the whole picture. If you saw it… you’d understand. It wasn’t just individual tragedies, it was all connected… she knew about them somehow, *she knew…*

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Bob, can you slow down! What drawings? What did your daughter know?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** You saw the drawings… you had to. You searched her room.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** What drawings specifically?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** The ones she kept on the wall above her desk. We bought her a corkboard two years ago… she always liked to draw. We figured she could put up her favorite drawings. Like a little art gallery, you know?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Sure…?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** And you saw the drawings she had up there, right?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I did, yes.

&#x200B;

**Oster:** Prophecies… all of them.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Prophecies…?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** It started off small… the first one was the coyote drawing… you saw it, right? The one of a coyote eating a dead cat. I remember when we saw that she’d put it up… I’d asked Katie why she’d drawn something so morbid. She said she didn’t know and I didn’t really question it at the time… kids draw weird shit. It’s just what they do. I didn’t think much of it… not until Mr. McCurry’s cat died. A coyote grabbed it while it was out. Ripped the damn thing to pieces… I was the one who found it… barely even recognized it when I did. Shame… Fritz was a good cat. We used to leave food out for him.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I see… and you assumed this was connected to your daughters drawing?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** Not at first, no. But there was more… not even a few weeks later. Another drawing.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** And what did this one depict?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** Two kids… floating under a river. They were dead… that much was clear from the drawing. She drew them dead… bloated… waterlogged… it was grotesque. Even she wouldn’t look at that one. And when I asked her about it, she said she didn’t know why she’d drawn it either. She seemed… she seemed genuinely upset, looking at it. Kept crying… eventually I just took it down, but there was a new one on the corkboard the next day. The same picture. She’d just redrawn it. She said she didn’t remember doing it, and asked me to take it down again. For some reason, she didn’t even want to touch it.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I see…

&#x200B;

**Oster:** You already know where this is going, don’t you?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** The drowning of Jim and James Pezzola…

&#x200B;

**Oster:** Yeah… figured you’d know about that…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I investigated that case. Poor kids were caught in an undertow… couldn’t get out.

&#x200B;

**Oster:** I read all about it… two days after Katie did her second drawing, the Pezzola boys passed away. Hell of a fucking coincidence…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Those were accidental drownings.

&#x200B;

**Oster:** Maybe they were, but Katie still knew about them somehow! She drew them days before they happened! Same with the cat, she drew that days before it happened! Now the cat? I could explain that away! The Pezzola boys? No… no, I couldn’t explain jack shit!

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** It never occurred to you that you were reading too much into these drawings?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** *I wasn’t!* She knew about these things in advance somehow! *She knew!* The Pezzola boys went to her school… she’d had them over at her birthday party. She knew them!

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** You’re positive these drawings appeared before the Pezzola boys passed away?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** I wouldn’t forget that. I wouldn’t forget that because I remember thinking about those pictures she drew when I heard the news. She knew! Somehow she knew… somehow she just… she knew.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Did you speak to Katie about these drawings, after the deaths?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** I did… I asked her how she’d known they were going to happen. She told me that someone had told her. When I asked her who’d said these things to her, she called it… she called it her *head voice…*

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Head voice?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** She described it as a voice that whispered things to her… she said it would whisper things, and those things would come true. Then she said she didn’t remember drawing either of the pictures she’d done of the Pezzola boys. She said they just… they just appeared.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** And did you believe that?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** No. The pictures were obviously hers. They looked like things she’d draw. The way she drew the people, the backgrounds. It was her… she was always good at drawing. She was starting to get her own little style. They were hers.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I see… and these odd drawings continued?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** Yes… but things did quiet down for a little while after the Pezzola boys died. She didn’t draw for a few months after that, and when she did finally start drawing again… it was normal. She was more or less back to her old self. She didn’t draw anything strange for about a year.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** But it eventually started again?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** Yes… it did… like I said, about a year later. This time I saw her make the drawing.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I see…

&#x200B;

**Oster:** She’d been in her room at the time, listening to this one J-Pop singer her friend had gotten her into. Um… Sakura Hayashi, I think? She was watching some YouTube video she’d done. I remember it because I recognized the song she was covering. *‘I Want The One I Can’t Have’* by The Smiths. It was because I recognized the song that I went into her room… and I saw her at her desk, drawing. She didn’t even notice me come in. She was just… laser focused on her drawing. I remember looking over her shoulder, curious to see what she was drawing… and I remember recognizing the face of my father on the paper.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Your father?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** Her grandfather. He was sitting at a table, his eyes bulging, his face purple… he looked like he was choking. There was food in front of him. Steak… he was…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** She drew her grandfather choking on a piece of steak?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** Yeah… she was still in the middle of drawing, but I tried to get her attention. Tried to stop her. She just… she just kept looking down at the paper. She didn’t even react to my efforts to stop her. She just kept trying to draw… Katie… she’d had seizures before, and we were always warned they could get worse, so at first I thought she was having a seizure! But the more I think back on it, the less I’m sure. She’s never… she’s never drawn anything during her seizures before. She usually just stares blankly, forgets where she is, sometimes she passes out… never this.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** She was prone to seizures?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** Yeah… always has been. Something about some damage to her brain, when she was a baby… Katie was… Katie was a twin. Kinda, a twin…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:**  I see… what happened to the other one?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** We couldn’t keep it… the other baby… they weren’t… they weren’t fully developed. He and Katie had sort of… merged, in the womb. There wasn’t even *much* of the other baby… just the head, attached to her head. It was barely even alive. It didn’t have its own organs, its brain was part of her brain… the doctors removed it, said she *should* grow up healthy, but could suffer some minor brain damage. Told us what to keep an eye out for. It was for the best… the other head it… it was grotesque… malformed… when she slept, it was awake. You could see the eyes looking around… see the mouth moving, opening, as if it was trying to cry… Doctors said that it would eventually impact her quality of life, so… so it was better to just… *\[pause\]* We always figured the seizures were from that… the doctors had said it was one of the long term side effects she could face.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I see… but you said she’d never had these seizures while drawing before, right?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** No. Never. And she just kept going even when I tried to stop her, just kept fighting to draw. Even when I ripped the paper away, she just kept doing it on her desk, until I took away her pencil. Then she just stared at me… blinking as if she wasn’t entirely sure where she was.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Right.

&#x200B;

**Oster:** I asked her what had just happened! Took her to the doctor to have her looked at. They ran tests… nothing. She said she didn’t remember what she’d been drawing. She just said she remembered her Head Voice had said something, and the next thing she knew I was ripping the pencil out of her hand.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** And which doctor did you take her to?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** Dr. Berger, our family physician. He ordered some scans, but they came back normal. You can ask him about the whole thing! He’s bound to have it all on file.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Dr. Berger… thank you. So this drawing she did, the drawing of her Grandfather… did the events she drew also come to pass?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** One week later…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Your father passed away?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** You can look it all up if you want. Hank Oster. Died two months ago. Choked to death at home, on a piece of steak. I’d been checking in on him a little more after she drew that picture… making sure he was alright. The old man was in good health, as always. I told him about Katie’s drawing, told him I was afraid…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** What did he say about that?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** He thought I was drunk or fucking around with him! Didn’t take it seriously, talked to me like I was fucking crazy!

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I have to ask Mr. Oster… do you have a history with alcohol?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** Yeah… a little… I started drinking more after my wife died. But I got help! Tried to tone it down! Tried to get my life back on track!

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** How heavily have you been drinking over the past year?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** I wasn’t fucking drunk, okay! Not when Katie drew those pictures, not when I talked to Dad! I was fucking sober!

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Mr. Oster… we found a considerable amount of alcohol in your house when we brought you in.

&#x200B;

**Oster:** I… I might’ve fallen off the wagon… but that was *after* Dad died, okay! AFTER, not before! I was *good* before he died! I had it under control! I just… after I found him… I… I needed…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** You found your father dead?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** Yeah… like I said, a week after Katie did her drawing. I said I’d been going by to check on him more, make sure he was doing okay. Warn him… one of the times I came over, I found him in the kitchen… he…

&#x200B;

*\[Silence\]*

&#x200B;

**Oster:** It was just like in Katie’s drawing… even the look on his face…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Mr. Oster… Bob… after your father died… how did your relationship with your daughter change?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** I don’t know I… I didn’t want to be around her… I don’t know if she caused this or what, but I… I couldn’t be around her. Not anymore.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** You were angry at her?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** I was scared! She’d predicted three peoples deaths! How the hell couldn’t I be scared! I don’t know if she’d caused it or if it was some sort of fucked up prophecy or… or what… I don’t know… I don’t know… how the fuck do you parent a child when you’re fucking terrified of her?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** So what was the boiling point?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** Yesterday… I… I… I’d been trying to forget. Trying to go back to the way things were. Trying to move on. Heard her in her room again, listening to music and drawing. I went to check in on her.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** And she was in her trance again?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** Yeah… she was. Sitting at her desk, listening to that singer she liked, drawing. She didn’t respond when I spoke to her. It all played out almost the same as it had before. I got closer, asked her what she wanted for dinner and that’s when I saw it… the new drawing.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** What was in the new drawing?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** Me. Dead inside of a crushed car… I knew it was me… she was… she was telling me how I was going to die. She was showing me… I begged her to change it. Begged her to do it differently, not to let me die this way. She didn’t respond. Even when I tried to stop her, she kept drawing.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** So you stopped her?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** Yes… yes, I did… but not like that… I didn’t… I didn’t hurt her, I took her pencil. Took the paper. Tried to wake her up from her trance.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** And did it work?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** No… she was still in her trance. Still looking at something far away. Didn’t even acknowledge me. Even when I tried to beg her to draw something else, she just stared… and then she spoke but the voice… it wasn’t right. It wasn’t the way my daughter usually spoke… it was so lifeless. The tone was all wrong.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** What did she say to you?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** She said: ‘*You can’t change it. Not now.*’ I still begged her to try… gave her the paper again, tried to *make* her draw something different but she still kept drawing my face… still kept drawing my… my death… she still kept… I couldn’t… I begged her to stop, I didn’t want to see… I didn’t want to die, I begged… I begged… and I…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** You hit her?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** I… I… I didn’t mean to… I just… I was panicking… I didn’t realize what I’d done until she was on the ground and she was bleeding and I… I didn’t mean to kill her… I didn’t… she was my daughter, she was my little girl… I didn’t mean to… it wasn’t… I didn’t… I…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** You saw she was dead, so you moved the body?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** I… I…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** You took the body to the river. Threw her in. Cleaned up the mess. Waited until nightfall… then called in a missing persons report.

&#x200B;

**Oster:** *\[Inaudible. Only sobbing is heard.\]*

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Is that what you did, Mr. Oster?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** I… I was afraid… I tried to draw over her image… tried to fix it… I… I’m sorry… I’m sorry… I’m sorry…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** How drunk were you at the time of the incident, Mr. Oster?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** I… I’d had a few… I wasn’t… I don’t know, I don’t…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** The officers on the scene noted you were heavily intoxicated.

&#x200B;

**Oster:** I… I drank more after… I… I wasn’t in my right mind… I wasn’t… I didn’t mean to kill her…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** You didn’t.

&#x200B;

**Oster:** I didn’t mean it! I didn’t mean to! I… I didn’t... I… I know what it looks like, I know they found the body… I know…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** We didn’t find a body, Mr. Oster.

&#x200B;

**Oster:** You… what? No… no, I heard that they’d found Katie… you said earlier…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Currently your daughter is resting in hospital. She’s severely concussed. Lost a lot of blood and has mild hypothermia, but she is alive.

&#x200B;

**Oster:** Oh… oh God… oh God… oh God…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Whatever your issues are, Mr. Oster… maybe you can take some solace in that. But you do understand the severity of your confession, correct?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** I… I…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Mr. Oster… as of now I’m placing you under arrest for the assault and attempted murder of Katie Oster. You have the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. Do you want to contact your lawyer?

&#x200B;

**Oster:** I… Katie’s alive…?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** That’s correct.

&#x200B;

**Oster:** I… I need to… I need to see her, I need to talk to her, I need to change this, I need to fix it, let me fix it, please, let me fix it!

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I’m afraid that’s out of the question, Mr. Oster. Hands behind your back, please.

&#x200B;

**Oster:** No… no, no, no, no… no, don’t do this, no… NO! NO! NO! LET ME TALK TO HER! LET ME TALK TO HER, PLEASE! I’M HER FATHER, LET ME TALK TO HER! LET ME… DON’T! PLEASE! I DON’T WANT TO… I DON’T… PLEASE… PLEASE…

&#x200B;

***\[Transcript Ends\]***

&#x200B;

*Notes: Mr. Oster was arrested and held in custody for the assault and attempted murder of his nine year old daughter, with further child abuse charges pending.*

&#x200B;

*Approximately three days later, while transferring Mr. Oster to a holding facility to await trial, his transport was involved in an accident. A wheel came off a truck, causing another car to crash. The transport Mr. Oster was in went off the road and into a ditch, rolling twice.*

&#x200B;

*The officers in the vehicle and the driver were both unharmed, however, Mr. Oster was killed during the accident. Cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma to the head, caused when he was thrown out of his seat while the vehicle rolled. Though first aid was performed on him, he died before paramedics could arrive.*

&#x200B;

*I didn’t used to be superstitious… nowadays, I don’t know what to think.*

*Anyways, you asked for any cases I found that seemed up your alley. I passed this one along. I can’t tell you what happened to Katie Oster and officially, I’d advise you not to look into it. What I do know is that she’s safe and has more or less recovered, and I’m going to choose to believe that’s a good thing. I’ll keep an eye out for anything else that’s on brand for you. In the meanwhile, keep out of trouble, Jane.*
