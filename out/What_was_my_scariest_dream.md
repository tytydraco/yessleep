**This happened last Friday, April 4th, 2025, from around 11 PM to a little past 2 AM.**

So, I am a student doing an internship abroad. The place I live is an apartment building housing students from my country who are also interning here. The building is quite old, but the rent is relatively cheap, it's clean, and very livable – I have no issues with it and I'm not scared at all. Besides, there are about 19 of us living in the building, and in my room, there are 2 other students. Back to Friday, April 4th, that day I had just wanted to sleep after chatting with friends in other rooms. As usual, before sleeping, I took some time to watch Netflix. Usually, I fall asleep on my own. The movie I was watching was a documentary about a psychopath titled: "Evil Genius" – it was the first episode if I'm not mistaken. When the first episode was nearing the middle, I suddenly felt sleepy. As usual, I turned off my phone, plugged it in to charge, and placed it next to my bed on the floor, then I went to sleep. The air was quite cold, around 17 degrees Celsius with the AC on, so I was under the blanket. Not long after, I woke up and saw a pair of pants hanging from the upper bunk bed above me. Our dorm uses bunk beds, and my position is on the lower bunk, with the right side next to the open space (the left side is against the wall). Oh yeah, a flashback before I fell asleep – I briefly thought about a documentary series called "House of Secrets" and I couldn't sleep after watching it before, but that was just a passing thought. Back to when I wanted to fix the pants hanging from the upper bunk, I briefly thought, "Damn, if that hanging thing is a ghost, it'd be scary," while laughing to myself. Then I tidied it up and went back to sleep... and this is where strange things started to happen:

First: I started to wake up again and saw a black shirt hanging in front of me/my feet. I reflexively went to fix it. Suddenly, my friend asked, "Aren't you asleep yet?" and I said, "Just fixing a shirt. I was the last one to go to sleep, by the way."

Second: I'm the type of person who can remember dreams quite accurately, especially strange, scary dreams, and dreams involving people I know. So, I remember about 10-30 percent of my dreams from 5-10 years ago, like the chronology, setting, etc. What was weird was that these dreams kept repeating that night, so many times that I woke up with a headache. When I woke up, suddenly my phone was still next to my head, with the documentary still playing and the sound on. How strange was that? Then I turned it off and went out to smoke, specifically to my friend's room because I could still hear many of my friends chatting in their room (coincidentally, when I left my friend's room to sleep, there were still some people who continued to talk and joke around). So I thought, "I'll go smoke." Suddenly, when I opened the door, I felt like I lost consciousness from my feet up to my upper body, and then I suddenly woke up back in my bed.

Third: After I woke up, the same thing happened again. My phone was still on. Then I started to feel weird, like I had already been about to go to my friend's room. But I didn't think much of it and quickly went to my friend's room to smoke again. And the same thing happened every time I tried to open the door – I felt like I lost consciousness from my feet to my head and suddenly woke up in the same condition. This happened repeatedly; I forgot how many times, but I remember it was more than 5 times.

Fourth: When I woke up, I was tired and decided to just go back to sleep and wait for the morning. Then suddenly, I dreamed all my previous dreams again. Some repeated events, others continued the events in certain dreams. Then I woke up again, and I couldn't move. And the black cloth hanging in front of my feet was there again. I panicked and tried to run, but when I opened the door, the result was the same – I was back in the same position: phone on, but now I was panting, and the black cloth was there. At this point, I thought this wasn't just a dream. I am a Muslim, not very devout, but I strongly believe in God. So I recited a prayer, hoping this strange thing would end. But it didn't.

Fifth: I woke up again in the same position. But now I could move, and I quickly ran to my friend's room. I could still hear them all laughing. I ran, and our rooms happened to be next to each other, and when I got there, suddenly their room became a room full of gacha machines (weird, right?) and it was daytime in that setting. The lights in the room were off, and twilight light was coming in from the balcony. Then I heard them on the second floor and quickly went downstairs, but the same thing happened again – I woke up back in my bed, but now something was different.

Sixth: When I woke up, I saw a new figure, tall, wearing a black robe, and now the cloth or clothing hanging there had a face. With my phone still on, playing the documentary, I couldn't move. I immediately tried to sleep again and closed my eyes, and I dreamed the same things again – some repeating, some continuing.

Seventh: I woke up again, and now both of them had faces, especially the one in the black robe. So, their position was at my feet. The black-faced cloth was hanging in front of my feet, and the standing figure was on my right side. I remember their faces very clearly: The hanging cloth had a face like a white person but with Middle Eastern features, a thin face, and looked to be in their 50s. It was just a head and torso, not even down to the waist, it seemed to be only chest-high, hanging from above. And the standing figure was a black person, with a completely bald head, wearing a very smooth black robe, like expensive silk, and was tall. I remember he seemed to be slightly bending down to look at me. Not long after, the standing figure laughed at me, speaking a language I had never heard before. And he was twisting the head of the hanging figure around. Suddenly, the hanging figure opened its eyes and slowly started laughing too. At that point, I gave up. Whatever happened, I was ready. Suddenly, while they were laughing, the standing figure reached out his hand towards me, saying in English, "Do you want to die?" while pointing his hand at my face. And don't forget, my phone was still on, showing that the series was at the very end... with the conclusion from the narrator followed by the outro song, and I remember the song was "Look What You Made Me Do" by Taylor Swift, which in the real series doesn't have an outro with that song for every episode. Then suddenly, the black figure's hand looked like it wanted to grab my neck, and I fell asleep and woke up again.

Eighth: I woke up, with my phone on the floor, and no clothes hanging. I was silent for a moment, wondering if I was still trapped. And I woke up in a position where I was on my hands and knees first, so I was face down, on my knees, and slowly stood up, making sure I wouldn't lose consciousness again. Then I could stand, and I was silent for a moment. And yeah, I woke up again, but this time panting, short of breath, sweating, and of course, panicked.

It was at this point that I finally realized it was over. I checked around and realized that it was impossible for clothes to be hanging in front of my feet because the side of the bed that wasn't against the wall was my right side, and the left, front, and back were all against the wall. So there couldn't be space in the front for clothes to hang from above. Then I looked at my phone, and it was still a little past 2 AM. I slowly went to my friend's place and didn't go back to sleep. Then I told them what happened. Some laughed, some were serious – well, we're university students, after all.

But what was strange was that I hadn't yet mentioned the black figure standing at my right foot. Suddenly, a senior of mine said that he had once seen a black figure enter my room before I moved in there. I reflexively went silent and ended my story, then continued smoking. After that, we went back to our respective rooms, and I had to wait for my roommates to pray the dawn prayer before I dared to sleep and could finally sleep. And in the end, nothing else happened. What do you guys think happened to me? And what is your worst dream?"
