Those three words hit me like a punch to the gut. This was the closest I had gotten to the truth, but it was as elusive as a laugh in the mist. I could not take anything Nichole said at face value. Her every action was a contradiction. Cloak and dagger meeting and she attacks me at the door. She wants to help and give me answers but holds me here at gunpoint. I felt stuck in an endless nightmare – the infuriating kind where a monster is chasing you, but you can’t force your legs to move fast enough. With a feeble, childish hope, I pinched myself to see if maybe it was all a dream. No luck. And that fucking hurt.

The silence in the room had gone on for too long. The air grew thick with unspoken words and bottled-up emotions. Nichole seemed to be lost for words.

Finally, I broke the silence.

“I didn’t escape.” It wasn’t a question. Nichole shook her head. “The thing…woman… that saved me then? Who was that?”

Nichole’s business-like façade broke. She looked everywhere but at me and finally let out a grunt of frustration. “I don’t know. I was never supposed to be part of this phase! There was never supposed to be a phase four. Or five! Everything just… got out of control. I asked questions way too late in the game. I objected to the use of unwitting civilians. So, they threatened my brother… and…and my mother.” The tears were coming in earnest now. A pang of empathy rushed through me, and I wanted so badly to go hug her before remembering this wasn’t my friend. This was never my friend. I watched her face crumple, her shoulders drawn forward as she tried to regain composure. She looked down at the hand still griping the gun and seemed surprised by its presence. She looked briefly back at me and hung her head. “I am sorry. I don’t expect you to forgive me. I would be astounded if you did,” she said as she made a show of putting the gun back in the holster at her side.

I didn’t relax at this. I felt even more on edge. Was this calculated? My nerves were fried – some raw, some totally numb. I couldn’t tell what I felt. I was drowning. Then I asked, “Why - WHY did they let me run that night? Why haven’t they caught up to me?” Her answer was a hollow, humorless laugh.

“They don’t want to catch you. They don’t need to. You’re like a dog in one of those invisible fences,” she said flatly. I had been running, hiding for NOTHING. Does a lab rat in a maze think it’s hiding from the giants that treat it so cruelly? I was pathetic. I had felt so many things during all of this, but this was the first time I actually felt hopeless, overwhelmingly defeated. Nichole trudged on, unaware of my mental upheaval.
“They don’t care how you spend your time as long as you aren’t poking around for answers. You being on the run meant you wouldn’t kick over any rocks. They are well beyond the bounds of sanctioned government work, and no one wants light shed on any of this. If you had stayed, playing detective with Mark, you would both be dead. I would be too, probably.”

“So, you what? Suddenly got religion? Heart grew three sizes? Why now? Why do you care now?” I asked, accusation dripping from each syllable.
“My…mother… died.” The words hung in the air like the last note played at a funeral. She opened her mouth but closed it again, unable to continue.
I could have said I was sorry for her loss. I could have offered platitudes and made a vain attempt to console her, but I could not traverse the bitter sea between us. The bridges had all burned. We sat saying nothing for several minutes. I jumped when she suddenly went on.

“It was a week ago. Heart attack according to the coroner’s report, but she was healthy. They did it … They… They did it because… I failed to follow orders.” The grief was powerful, it rolled off of her in waves and crashed into me unapologetically. “FUCK THEM! You were MY friend, too, damn it! It was built on lies, I know…But…The day to day…was still me, Liz.”

I wanted to believe her. I wanted to stop being alone. What were my options now? Keep running when no matter where I went, a tiny beeping dot betrayed my location? Go home? I had no home – just those four walls filled with tainted memories. Did I really care to live or die at this point? The truth was part of me wished for death – a clean, peaceful end. Just like falling asleep. I could truly rest, ready and rested for whatever happened after this life. So, if I trusted her, what was the worst thing that could happen? Dying? I let go of that particular fear, stood up slowly, deliberately. I sighed and looked her straight in the eyes. “Ok. Get this thing out of me.”

I could tell, no matter what she had hoped, she did not think I would let her help me (if she was truly helping). She sniffed, wiped her eyes with her fingertips and then her nose with the back of her sleeve. She was shaking more than I was, but she didn’t let it slow her down. She got to work, rushing over to a big, black, canvas bag stuffed in the corner of the room. She pulled out some equipment I didn’t recognize, I long scalpel like knife, a couple bottles of fluid, and a large white cloth from a thin blue plastic bag. She had a metal tray and placed her tools upon it and laid the tray on the bedside table. She looked at me, apprehensively, “I sterilized the bed as much as possible before you got here. The drape is as sterile as anything can be outside an O.R. But, Liz, I couldn’t get any kind of anesthesia. I have some topical spray that will numb you somewhat, but it won’t do much more than that. This…This is going to hurt. A lot. And you cannot move. It’s in the back of your neck, and I am not a surgeon. I only have a little field training in medicine. If you move when the knife or the extractor go in, it could hit your spine…”

The weight of the consequences still rocked me. Dead I could do, but paralyzed? Living AND immobile? I had to steel myself for this. I honestly did not know if I could take it. But I had to. This was my choice, and now it’s time to act. “Well,” I told her, my voice quavering, “If that happens, kill me. Please. Don’t let me go on like that.” And I climbed onto the bed, laying on my stomach. Her eyes were wide, mouth slightly open, as if she wasn’t quite sure she could make good on that. I pulled my hair up and away from the nape of my neck and she snapped out of it, refocusing on the job at hand.

“One last thing. Once this comes out, they are going to know, and they will be here in a matter of minutes. They only sent me out here to keep tabs on you. I wasn’t supposed to make contact. I have a support team less than an hour away. We will have maybe ten minutes to stitch you up and get the hell out of Dodge. I have a bottle of hydros in my bag if you need something for pain, but you can’t take anything until we are well away from here. Got it?” she explained. It was an even tone, but the panic crept in and I felt the urgency in her words.

“I got it. Do it.”
