When I told Stephen about my discovery, he moved faster than the wind. John Joe and I followed, the former asking persistent questions.

“What did the skull look like?”

I shrugged, “Like a skull,”

“Yeah, but human or animal?”

“Human. I don’t think Stephen would care if it was a sheep’s skull,”

“Oh, I would,” John Joe grinned, “Imagine that hanging on your wall,”

I raised an eyebrow, “You have a wall now?”

“Sometimes.”

Before I could dwell further on his cryptic words, we found Stephen, practically dancing over the morbid discovery.

“Hang on!” He cried out, motioning for us to stop, “Nobody take another step. There might be more bones under the dirt.”

I thought back to the supposed rocks I tripped over, and shivered. Peering closer, I saw that both eye sockets were fractured, its jaw open in a silent scream. There were three notches carved into the frontal bone. I felt the weight of such a discovery, and was genuinely happy for Stephen,

“I imagine this will get you some bragging rights at school?”

“Oh, you have no idea,” Stephen pulled out his phone, snapping pictures from every angle, “These are going straight to my professor when I get service.”

“Are you going to dig it up?”

“No! Are you crazy?” Stephen looked down at the skull, wagging his fingers,

“I’ll have to get a group out here.”

John Joe knelt in front of the skull, whistling as he did,

“What do you think was the cause of death?”

“It’s hard to tell in this state but see the teeth?”

The skull’s few remaining teeth were brown and cracked, looking more like wood chips than teeth.

“It looks like starvation. Or scurvy.”

He said it like a child declaring their favourite food.

After marking the site with rocks, and a spare pair of shoes, the trio turned back towards the campsite. Stephen chattered excitedly all the way back, John Joe listened while I trailed after them. Lost in my thoughts, I caught sight of that deep red again. I followed the movement of bush bobbing in the wind, following us.

John Joe had set up camp in the roofless cottage. The drystone walls were a meter thick, a cold, ancient hearth sat in the corner. The alcove painted black with a century of soot, flakes of turf crushed into the stone.

“It’s going to be cold,” I told him,

“The walls will block the wind,” he said like it was the most obvious thing in the world, “We’ll light a fire, and you brought your sleeping bag, didn’t you?”

I sighed, “Yes.”

The sun, still hidden by the grey clouds, began to set. The sky darkened with every passing moment.

“I’ll get the fire started,” John Joe announced, kneeling in front of the dead hearth.

I tossed wood towards him, hoping it wasn’t too damp to ignite. Stephen was busy trying to get service, alternating between typing and voice messages.

Soon, the fire was blazing, I didn’t realise I missed the heat until the cold left my bones. I held my hands in front of the flames, feeling my fingers tingle. The sky was now a dusky, dark colour, a few stars blinked down at me. John Joe was right, it was going to be a starry night. Over the wind battering the decrepit rocks, my ears pricked at something else. A scuff on the rocks, the kind only a shoe could make. Then, Stephen leapt over the low wall, plopping himself beside me.

He nudged me, “You alright?” I jumped, blinking at his sudden appearance,

“Yeah, why?”

“You’re quiet,”

I shrugged, not knowing how to answer,

“Just thinking.”

He gave me a look that I couldn’t place. Was he waiting for me to say something else?

Stephen nodded, “You ready for food?”

Without waiting for an answer, he rushed to his bag and pulled out two plastic packets,

“I brought ready to eat pasta,” he brandished them like a pack of cards.

“Oh…,” I sighed again, “You shouldn’t have.”

“I just need hot water, John Joe, you got a kettle?”

John Joe looked up from his fish gutting, knuckle deep in a trout, before handing over a tin kettle,

I quickly put a hand, “No need. I have my own stuff.”

He waited for me to pull out my own meal, and the way his face fell put a weight in my stomach.

“Is that it?” Stephen asked, I looked down at my packet of rich tea and ready-mix coffee,

“Yeah.”

He shook his head, “We’re here for three days, Niall,”

I sighed in irritation, “I’ll be fine.”

Stephen opened his mouth to say something else, but I interrupted by loudly opening the plastic packet. The biscuit turned to ash in my mouth, but with both men’s eyes on me, I forced down three. They sat like rocks in my stomach. I watched the others prepare their own food; John Joe speared his fish, dusted it in salt, and stuck it next to the fire. Stephen waited for his carbonara, shooting me looks I tried to ignore. The smell of both turned my stomach, I had to bury my nose in the steam of my coffee. It didn’t protect me from the sounds. Gnashing teeth, slurping, crunching, smacking lips. It was a miracle I didn’t bring the biscuits back up.

When everyone was fed and watered, bundled in our sleeping bags like fat caterpillars, we sat back in the soft grass, gazing up at the twinkling stars, with the wind and distant lapping of waves ready to lull us to sleep. But, of course, Stephen had to ruin it.

“Niall,” his voice broke the comfortable silence. His concerned tone made me groan internally,

“I don’t know how to bring this up,”

“Then don’t.”

“I have to,” he almost snapped,

“Why?” I propped up on one elbow, “Why do you always have to say something?”

Hurt flickered over his face, luckily, John Joe was there. He tapped Stephen’s shoulder, whispering something in his ear, while they both glanced at me. He shut up at John Joe’s words, for that, I was grateful.

“So…” John Joe said, trying to break the awkward silence,

“Stephen, do you have any ghost stories about this place?”

And, just like flipping a switch, Stephen went off.

“Well, not ghost stories, but the famine is scarier than anything I could come up with.” His gestures became more animated,

“Come on then,” John Joe patted his shoulder, “Regale us with some tales.”

Despite my earlier irritation, I couldn’t help leaning in to listen.

“Now,” Stephen began,

“As we all know, Ireland suffered terribly during the Famine, but islands like these were most affected. Think about it, they weren’t allowed to fish,”

“What? Why?”

“Exports, whatever food they had was taken from them to sell,” Stephen explained sadly, “That’s why the potato was so important. It was the only food that was truly theirs, and when that failed, they had nothing.”

“An already small, isolated community to have their only food source rot in the ground. It was like a cruel joke.” He shook his head, as if reliving an awful memory,

“Winter came and went, crops continued to fail, and the people grew hungrier. A type of hunger that settled in your bones like an ache.”

“Too soon, the waters were emptied of fish, all known game hunted, and some even turned to eating moss off rocks, which, according to my sources, gave them horrible rashes.” He just had to add in another fact.

“Every potato planted rotted in the ground like a corpse. Anyone caught stealing food was killed on the spot, didn’t matter if they were young or old. One of my sources tells of a landlord’s experience when he travelled through town to collect rent. First, he described the smell, he was surrounded by a sour smell, it hung thick in the air like decay. Second, was the sound.” His voice turned flat, as if reading off a page etched into his memory.

“Cries upon cries ripped through the air. A cacophony of despair. He saw little wretched creatures cowering by the side of the road, clinging to their mother, not realising she had already died. Wasted away.”

“He remarked how his tenants looked like they crawled out of their own graves. Moaning, shambling masses, nothing but bones and rags. That was what Ireland had been reduced to.” Stephen stopped, casting his head down, a show of respect for those that died. I listened, enthralled,

“Did anyone ever…you know…?”

I couldn’t say the word, “Like the Donner party?”

Stephen was quiet for a moment, his sharp inhale the only sign that he heard me,

“There are no recorded cases of it happening,” he took another slurp of noodles,

“But, there is always speculation.”

I looked at Stephen over the fire, the flames glinted off his red hair, making his head light up like a match.

“I remember reading somewhere that a young boy was once brought to court. He was just a tiny, shivering bundle of rags, what was his crime? They found him chewing on the leg of his deceased mother.”

His words hung in the air, the shared image in our heads killed any retort I had ready,

“Stranger still, that wasn’t the only one.”

“A man lost an ear in a fight and could only watch as his attacker swallowed it whole. Another story tells of a young girl that reduced her family to viscera-painting the cottage in blood. Apparently, a priest wanted to exorcise her.”

John Joe leaned forward, “Did he?”

Stephen shrugged, “I don’t know. The story ends with him getting his fingers bitten off.”

Stephen put down his food, suddenly looking sick,

“I mean, it’s understandable. When you’re pushed to the brink like that, anyone would succumb to their basic instincts. You try to seek comfort from your mother, but the only comfort she can give is her flesh.”

“Imagine the hunger that can force you to turn on your loved ones.”

The pensive silence from his final words was broken by John Joe slapping the ground with his hand,

“Is that who we found up there?” He jabbed a thumb at the looming cliff, “Someone’s leftovers?”

To my surprise, Stephen shook his head,

“It’s all just speculation, like I said, there’s no sources to prove it.”

“Well, why would there be?” I chimed in, “Who would document that?”

Stephen didn’t answer, just loudly slurped down his pasta juice. I watched as he chased it with a bread roll, then a chocolate bar.

“It’s getting late.” He announced, “We should get some sleep.”

John Joe had already curled up like a cat, while Stephen pulled out his book and a torch, his eyes dancing in the low light. I downed the last of my coffee, its warmth comforting as I gazed up at the night sky. The wind caressed the stones, whistling in some places. The rustling grass and turning pages became a background melody. As I lay there, the biscuits churning in my stomach, a knot of regret rose within me. I tried focusing on a singular star, breathing in deeply as I watched it blink. Like a child seeking comfort from a night light, soon, my eyes grew heavy. Despite sleep coming easy, it was not restful. I tossed and turned; my mind filled with unsettling images. Empty faces with hollow cheeks stared down at me, silently gnashing their teeth. In the dream I stared back, unable to tear my gaze away.

I think I woke up only once to total darkness. The fire had long since been snuffed out. The wind had a new bite to it. Shivering in my sleeping bag, l looked up, but the stars were gone. The night sky an endless pool of ink. I stared up into the void, and I could feel it staring back.
