I'm new to the On-Blog forums, but I'm making this blog post to document just what exactly I saw the other night. I haven't been able to rationalize anything. Not to the police, not to the detectives, not even to my own parents. I know I sound like I've just huffed something but I know what I saw out there.

I live in a small town called Riverbed in Norway, where I'm situated at the Overn Community College. Unlike most, this area has dorms, and usually it's just me and my roommate Jordan in our dorm. Jordan and I are actually great friends, we have been ever since elementary school when we met in 2nd grade. He and I loved doing everything together, especially exploring the shallow riverbeds and woods near our houses. But for a while between middle school to my sophomore year of college, we drifted apart to the point where we were almost unrecognizable to each other. We reconnected thankfully, but Jordan's been a little off since then. He used to be a very extroverted person, always loved socializing with all the other students, but nowadays he just sticks eerily close to me. I haven't brought it up to him because I was worried I came off as rude or that it wasn't that big of an issue.

A while after we reconnected, I got the idea to go camping together. I figured it would help us remember the past years when we would go out and explore, and he agreed to go with me. A week or two later, we had everything we needed and headed down to the Basalt Campgrounds. I didn't bring much, just some clothes, obvious hygiene stuff, food/snacks and some other small things for the couple of days we'd be staying there. Jordan insisted heavily that he'd bring his small hatchet that he had from a few years ago, which was a bit weird with how much he was pushing it onto me. Eventually I figured it would be useful for chopping any loose firewood we could find, so I reluctantly agreed to allow it. We decided to set up our campsite by the nearby river to see if we could fish anything up for dinner. As I was working on the tent by myself while Jordan said he'd be off by the river, I caught a glimpse of... what it was, at first, I wasn't sure. It looked tall and dark, almost as tall as the trees in the distance, and I could vaguely make out large skinny hands. But I blinked as I was processing it, and it was gone as quickly as it had come.

*'It's just your imagination, Marcus.'* I tried rationalizing to myself, looking back at where the figure was previously. I quickly realized it was just a weirdly formed tree as I squinted to get a better look. I breathed a sigh of relief, glad to have known it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. After a while, I got the tent set up, and heard Jordan's footsteps. It admittedly freaked me out for a second until I looked over and saw Jordan returned, with his hatchet and 2 large fish in his other hand.

"Catch anything good?" I asked him as he sat himself down on a broken stump, looking his way and checking out what he brought back.

"Sure did." He responded, wiping his brow from some of the sweat. "These things really put up a fight, but not as much as I expected. What's up with you though? You look a little... tense."

I hadn't realized I was tense until I relaxed my shoulders, offering out a sigh to calm myself. "It's nothing, it's just the woods. I haven't been out here in a while so I'm a little jumpy."

"You should go and rest. I'll take care of dinner tonight, already got more than enough fish to fry with just you here. But don't be out for long, you know I hate doing everything alone." Jordan said to me as he looked down at the fish he was holding. I offered up an awkward chuckle to him before I glanced up to the sky. I didn't even realize how late it was getting until I started to see the orange and yellow hues of the sunset above us. Even though I was a little hungry, I figured a little rest couldn't hurt me, I've been setting up this whole time anyways. Retreating into the new tent I had built for us, I decided to just lay on top of my sleeping bag, not feeling cold enough to hide in it, not yet at least. For some quiet moments, I listened to Jordan as he was smacking his hatchet against something hard, thinking he was just trying to get a fire started with the wood we had.

I didn't realize I had fallen asleep until I woke up. My eyes adjusted to the darkness of the tent... but I wasn't inside it anymore. The side of my face felt as grass tickled my cheek with my movement, sitting up to face where exactly I was. Peering around, I noticed I was surrounded by hundreds of trees, all in a fresh circle gathered before me. I was confused, but that was an understatement in itself. I sat myself up, propping myself onto my knees before I finally heard something shuffling in front of me. Narrowing my eyes in a squint to peer into the darkness, I saw it again. That figure. It was much closer to me now, but I couldn't make out all of its features just yet.

It was just as tall as I remembered, at least 15 feet. Where there were supposed to be legs, there was only a long, snake-like tail trailing behind it. And of course, it had those massive, lanky hands connected to even longer arms. I couldn't get the rest of its features into my sight, but I heard it speak to me.

***"He grinds his scythe, sharp enough to slice you. In the midst of night, dark enough to hide you."*** The thing growled at me, its teeth grinding with every word of its distorted voice. I was confused, what the hell was it talking about? I tried to speak back to it in a plead of an answer, but nothing came from my mouth. I tried again, but I was suddenly awoken when I felt something cold touch my forehead.

My eyes widened as I was panting heavily from the dream, waking up in a cold sweat. I almost sat up had it not been that I had spotted the hatchet lingering over my head. Jordan watched me quietly, an unnerving expression lacking any life on his face as he looked down at me, holding the hatchet just above my head as if to strike. I was almost going to scream in surprise... until I felt something cold drip onto my forehead. Reaching a hand up, I felt something wet underneath my fingers. And when I looked down into them, there was a crimson liquid coating them. Blood.

I looked back at Jordan, and quickly came to realize he wasn't moving, despite his stance above me. That's when I finally saw the blood dripping from his mouth, his head askew on a crudely made stand of supports from our own tent while the rest of his body was posed like a wooden model. I almost screamed when I witnessed what I saw, until I hear the clacking of teeth, and saw the creature looming just behind Jordan's corpse in the opening of the tent. Despite my fear of the monster, I wondered if... it hadn't come for me that night. I watched as it slithered away into the deep woods, leaving a trail of blood behind it as it hissed and cackled at its own carnage.

As I drove back to my college in the backseat of a patrol officer's car, the red and blue lights faded into the distance. Every sound became muffled, all except for the message I remembered from the beast: ***"He grinds his scythe, sharp enough to slice you. In the midst of night, dark enough to hide you."*** I did my best to explain to the police of what I had seen, but they thought I had something to do with it. Upon further investigation, they found the only things to have my DNA on it was my sleeping bag and nothing else, which ended up closing me out of the case. It made local news for a good month or two, and even though I felt afraid of that thing that night, I couldn't help but think that maybe it wasn't the creature I was supposed to be afraid of.

After all, why had it gone for Jordan and not me? Why had it warned me with such a vague omen at all? But the one thing that made me wonder the most, as I lay awake at night and type this out here, was this: What was Jordan planning on doing that night?
