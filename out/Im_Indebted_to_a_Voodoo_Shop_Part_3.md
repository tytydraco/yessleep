The time that elapsed between the next time King Creole called me was much less than the second time. He wasted only a day before calling me in the middle of a rare moment of spending time with my dad after he had finally gotten a day off. We had been holed up in the living room watching movies together when my phone began to vibrate in my pocket.  
  
“Son of a bitch,” I grumbled as I saw who was calling me. I held up a finger to my dad when he was about to ask who it was before I answered the phone and quickly stood up from the couch. “Yes?” I didn’t want to call him ‘sir’ in front of my dad since the last thing I wanted was to have him think that I had some kind of job on the side that he didn’t know about. I had also expected Creole to be still pissed at me after trying to buy the Jeff and Tom voodoo dolls. But he still sounded as cheery as ever.  
  
“Mace, darling! Sorry to interrupt your movie day with your dear ol’ dad.” Creole’s voice laughed through the mic, making my blood cold when he mentioned my dad. I glanced over at my dad as he was barely paying attention to the movie and was starting to doze off on the couch. “Y’all can finish your movie if you’d like, but as soon as you’re free I need you here at the shop. Something’s come up that requires your lovely picking skills. Don’t take too long, darling.” He chuckled before hanging up on me before I could even respond to him.   
  
I let out a pained groan into my hand as I shoved my phone back into my pocket. I walked back over to the couch and plopped myself down on it, not even stirring my dad who had fully conked out. It wasn’t even that I was upset at missing the movie since it was one that me and dad had watched plenty of times together. I was just annoyed and sad that I had to ‘work’ on the one day he had a day off.   
  
With the movie finishing up not long after I shook my dad awake. With a snort he shot up from the couch, probably thinking that he was late to work or something, before he reorientated himself to where he was.   
  
“Sorry, Daddy,” I told him, smiling at the confused and tired look on his face. “I’m going out for a bit, okay?” I told him as I quickly checked my pocket to ensure that I had my lockpick tools with me this time. I’d rather not have a repeat of having to run back home for them.   
  
“Oh, okay sweetheart,” my dad said with a bit of relief. I figured he just wanted more sleep, so I guess it worked out for the both of us that Creole needed me for some other horrible job. I hugged him and he made sure to give me one that succeeded in popping my back in several places. After he let me go I went over to the front door and started making my way down to the voodoo shop.   
  
The sun was beginning to set on the horizon which gave me some hope that this job would cause me less anxiety than the last two, but also scared me because it seemed like I was starting to get used to all this. The last thing that I wanted was to be getting used to this shit. I pushed all those thoughts to the back of my mind when I entered the shady part of town where the voodoo shop was located. As I rounded the corner down the street from where the voodoo shop was, my path was blocked by two guys I had known back in high school.   
  
“Mace?” Jacob, the taller of the two asked as he turned to look at me when he realized that I was standing awkwardly there. I wasn’t close to Jacob at school. He was known as the drug dealer and wannabe gang member. He had been expelled from the school just a few months before graduation and had apparently disappeared off the face of the Earth. And of all the places I could’ve run into him it had to be near the voodoo shop.   
  
“Hey,” I said, looking at the two guys before noticing the small zip-lock bag being passed between the two of them. “Sorry didn’t mean to interrupt your…business.” I cleared my throat as I tried to just walk past them. It wasn’t any of my business what these two guys did with their free time and money.   
  
“She a cop or something?” The mystery dude said and it was obvious that he was tweaking. Nothing about me screamed cop but in this dude's mind, I must have been the biggest narc in the city. I was just going to walk past them and leave them be, but the druggie reached out and grabbed me.   
  
“Get the fuck off me!” I shouted at him as I kicked him as hard as I could in the crotch. When my life is on the line fighting dirty is most definitely on the table. The junkie doubled over in pain and gagged with pain with how hard I had driven my shoe into his crotch. Jacob backed up from me after I did that and didn’t try to stop me from continuing on my way. I got only a few more steps forward before I felt a hand reach out and grab me. Before I could turn around to deal with whatever was grabbing me I also felt a sharp and intense pain in my neck.  
  
“You fucking cunt,” The junkie coughed out as I felt the pain increase in intensity and warm liquid began seeping into my shirt. I looked down at my right side and cried out in gargled pain as I looked down at the knife sticking into my neck and being twisted around by the junkie. “You are a fucking cop aren’t you?!” He screamed out as he pulled the knife out and stabbed it back into me.   
  
I tried to get away from him but his grip increased on me and I quickly felt my strength leaking out of me along with my blood. I could hear Jacob’s voice and he seemed to be distressed but I couldn’t tell what he was saying as the world began to spin and I felt increasingly lightheaded. And before I knew it I had somehow ended up on the sidewalk floor. I could hear screaming and fighting just near me, but my eyelids grew increasingly impossible to keep open and I struggled to be able to breathe. Just before I lost consciousness I felt like I was being lifted off of the floor. I thought that maybe I would be going to heaven after all.   
  
When I next woke up, I was inside the voodoo shop, inside King Creole’s office. I was sitting down on a plush upholstered chair and felt like I had just been run over by a steamroller. When I tried to move even a muscle I found it impossible to so much as move my pinkie.   
  
“Goodness! You’re awake already.” Creole’s voice frightened me for a second, as the silence was suddenly broken by it. He walked past me and sat down on a small stool that was in front of the chair I was sitting on. I have to admit he looked absolutely ridiculous sitting on that stool and it made me smile, and if I could I would’ve probably laughed.   
  
When I tried to open my mouth to speak only a horrible croaking sound came out. And that scared me more than anything else. The feeling of hearing your voice in your head and not matching what comes out of your mouth is terrifying.   
  
“I wouldn’t recommend talking at this moment, Mace my darling,” Creole told me as he was busy picking a few items off of his desk before swiveling on the stool back to face me. “That addict did quite a number on your throat.” He had needle and thread in his hand and I was apprehensive about letting him near me with those things, but it wasn’t like I had much choice in the matter. So I allowed him to sew my neck up, and to my surprise, he finished almost as quickly as he started.   
  
“My momma taught me how to sew real well.” He chuckled as he produced a long pair of scissors to cut the thread. “Now to help you recover your voice.” He held up a small bottle filled with a deep blue liquid in it. “Drink this in one gulp,” he told me as he handed the small item to me. I nodded and uncapped it, letting the small cork drop to his floor. But he didn’t seem to mind at all as I tipped my head back and allowed the viscous liquid to slide down my throat. It had no real taste at first but as more time passed it left a slight taste of citrus behind.   
  
“H-how do I sound?” I asked after a few seconds of letting the liquid settle. My voice had returned but it sounded very far away. Almost like the last hint of an echo. Creole nodded and carefully patted me on the head.   
  
“It’ll get stronger as time goes on. You’re lucky I got to you in time. Any later and I don’t think I would’ve been able to save you in this state.” He sounded sincere for the first time since I’d had the displeasure of first meeting him. And yet even after being in his debt, he had still saved my life.   
  
“What about…them?” I asked him, my voice still so quiet despite the fact I was trying to shout it out at him. Even Creole took a few moments to figure out what I was trying to say before that horrible smile I knew so well from him returned to his face.   
  
“Well, that horrible addict has been dealt with. But I’ve not yet decided what to do with Jacob.” He chuckled, standing up from the stool walking back over to his desk, and taking a seat behind it. While I was more than happy to hear that the person responsible for stabbing me had been dealt with, however horribly Creole may have done that. But in my mind, Jacob hadn’t done anything wrong but try and get by just like I was.   
  
“Is there…a way for you to spare him? I don’t feel like he deserves to be hurt,” I said as I slowly felt my strength returning to my body. It was enough to be able to sit up in the big comfy chair he had sat me down in. This seemed to catch Creole off-guard and he stared at me with his giant button eyes for a moment.   
  
“Hmm,” He humed in thought for a moment. “I suppose I can consider it.” He shrugged his shoulders as he leaned back in his chair. “But for now, you still have a job to do, darling,” he said with a smile and stood up from his chair excitedly. I was about to complain to him, mostly about the fact I had almost been murdered a few minutes ago. But I didn’t have any arguing points.   
  
“What is it this time?” I asked, startled at the slight increase in the volume of my voice. Creole kicked the stool out of the way and dangled a doll in front of me. It was a small puppet held up by strings and I noticed that he didn’t have one of those puppet controllers, the strings were coming out of his fingertips.   
  
“A couple came in here with their child today. And while their backs were turned, the kid took a voodoo doll off the shelf.” The little doll danced in front of me and it took me longer than I should’ve probably realized that the doll resembled the junkie to a frightening degree.   
  
“And you need me to get it back.” I finished his statement and he nodded excitedly. “Is it in the same neighborhood as the last two?” I asked, really just wanting to keep talking in the hope that by doing so my voice would return faster. To my surprise, he shook his hand and turned his gaze down to the puppet. Suddenly in the puppet’s little hands was a drawing.   
  
“This address should be more familiar to you,” he said with that creepy happy smile plastered on his face. I reached out and took the drawing from the puppet and when I did that, the strings retracted into his fingertips and he gripped the puppet tightly in his fist when it came up along with the strings.   
  
I shuddered at his sudden display of violence and looked down at the drawing. And to my shock, I was presented with an address that was in my neighborhood. I quickly looked back up at him and he stared down at me, his size causing me to cower deep into the comfy chair. I had gotten used to the routine of going to some stranger's neighborhood. But this was in my crib, and there was a chance that I knew these people.   
  
“It ain’t going to be a problem, is it my darling Mace?” He reached out and held my face in his gloved hand. I shook my head quickly and stood up quickly. All my strength returned just to get me away from him. Something told me that a dick kick wouldn’t do anything to him so it was better just to get as much distance between us as possible.   
  
“I-I’ll get right on it, sir,” I told him, stuffing the drawing which I hadn’t even paid attention to into my pocket. “R-right on it,” I repeated as I turned to leave his office. I walked past the basement door and was startled by the frantic banging that greeted me as I did so. I panted softly as I turned into the main shop and was again startled when I saw that Jacob was tied up with a gag stuffed into his mouth. He was sitting down in the register chair and he frantically screamed at me though it was nothing but muffled nonsense.   
  
“Don’t worry about him, Mace,” Creole told me as he suddenly appeared behind me and gripped my shoulder tightly. “I’ll take good care of him.” He laughed softly, a different tone from his normal cheery chuckles. This was a laugh that curdled my blood. Jacob’s eyes were wide with fear as he stared at me and he mumbled toward me. I shut my eyes as tightly as I could and simply ran toward the front door.   
  
I had my own problems to worry about. I couldn’t be worrying about Jacob. In truth, I didn’t want to end up like him, and maybe that’s why I ran away so quickly and so blindly.  I was already back in my neighborhood before I realized it and came back to reality. It only then occurred to me to check on the damage that had been done to me. I pulled my phone out and dared to point the selfie cam at my neck. I nearly burst out in tears at the sight of the gnarly stitching on my neck and throat.   
  
I quickly shoved my phone back into my pocket and did my best to pull my shirt up a bit to hide the horrible wound under it, though it didn’t do much but succeed in making me look more shifty. I pulled the drawing out of my pocket to double-check the address and only then looked down at the voodoo doll I was being sent to retrieve.   
  
It looked smaller than the others in the drawing. Creole had made the effort to make it smaller in the picture and it appeared to be a child wearing an outfit I’d describe as a 1950s aesthetic. I could only imagine what this poor kid was going to have unleashed on themselves. I sighed and hoped that I would get there before it was too late.   
  
I arrived at the home and was immediately glad that it wasn’t someone I knew. And by the looks of it, the parents were still at work as no car was in sight. Though there was the possibility of it being in the garage. What turned me off instantly though was the sight of a home defense advertisement on their front lawn. Meaning I only had a certain amount of time before their alarm went off. I was about to whisper a curse when I suddenly felt my pocket get significantly hotter. I quickly reached into my pocket and pulled out the drawing.   
  
To my surprise, it was on fire. But only on one side and that soon quickly ended. Smoke rose from the drawing and I was greeted by both a message and a code. ‘Figured you might need this, KC’ the message said. That feeling of being watched returned to me and the hair stood up on the back of my neck.   
  
I quickly reached into my pocket and pulled out my tools to get to work on this. The quicker this was over the quicker I could ask him to somehow cover up this scar on my neck. I reached the door and quickly got to work. I hated to admit it but the locks here in my neighborhood were nowhere near as good as the ones in the rich suburbs were. It was like picking a cheap padlock used on a bike because before I knew it the door was open, and I was quickly scrambling inside to input the code to deactivate the alarm.   
  
Once that was done, I quickly went about looking for the doll. If the kid had taken it, it was obvious to begin searching in their room. I walked past some family pictures and confirmed my thinking that the kid had been a girl. It would make sense for her to take a small doll that was seemingly made for little girls. Like a horrible haunted American girl doll. As I started up the stairs, I started hearing giggling and laughing. Not malicious or anything, the sounds of children playing.   
  
I arrived outside the girl’s room and did my best to try and peek in without being noticed. Two girls were sitting on the bed and giggling with each other. And one of them was wearing the same outfit as the voodoo doll. Which meant that I was too late. And I had no talisman to change the little girl back into a doll like I had done with the killer lumberjack. I had no idea what to do. Leaving the girls to play I quickly went into the other room across the hall which turned out to be a spare bedroom by the look of it. I silently closed the door behind me and quickly pulled my phone out to call Creole.   
  
The phone rang for an agonizing amount of time before he finally picked up. I wish he hadn’t because as soon as he did loud screaming came pouring out of the mic. It soon quickly subsided into gargles that resembled the ones that I had made when I had been stabbed in the neck.   
  
“Mace! To what do I owe the pleasure of your call?” Creole asked me as he struggled against something on his end. I was quickly regretting this call but if he wanted me to do something about this little girl I needed him to give me something.   
  
“Sir, the voodoo doll has become a little girl. And I don’t have a talisman to turn her back.” I told him quickly, keeping my already quiet voice down which was shockingly quiet. I swear to God I must have sounded like a mouse to him.   
  
“Ah, well that is unfortunate. I had hoped that you might be able to get to her before that happened. Lil’ Miss Sarah is quite the manipulator. Especially with fellow children.” He hummed into the receiver as he was thinking about something. I nervously tapped my foot on the carpeted floor and looked at the door separating me from the girls. And my eyes widened as I saw the door slowly close.   
  
“Sir…I think they might know I’m here.” I whispered into my phone. There was silence on his end and I looked down at my phone to see if he’d hung up on me. “Sir?” I asked with desperation in my voice. I started nervously pacing around the room waiting for him to answer me.   
  
“Get out of that house, Macedonia,” he told me in a serious tone. He didn’t have to tell me twice I was already heading for the door to get out of the room and out into the hallway. I opened the door and started making my way toward the stairs. Just before I could reach the first step I felt two pairs of small hands shove me down the stairs. My phone flew out of my hand as I came tumbling down to the first floor. The second time on one of these jobs I’d fallen down a flight of stairs.   
  
“Great job, Em!” A small southern voice shouted out. I groaned and rolled over on my back, quickly met by someone sitting on my chest and holding a knife to my neck. This was quickly turning into the worst day ever, almost on par with when I first met King Creole. When my vision finally focused on the tiny figure straddling my chest I saw that it was the living voodoo doll girl. She was wearing a small 50s-style dress with brown hair tied in pigtails, she looked almost like Shirley Temple. Although I don’t think she was in any mood to give me animal crackers.   
  
“W-what should we do now, Sarah?” a softer voice asked. Turning my head to the side, I saw standing behind us on the stairs was a little girl who also had pigtails. The voodoo doll who was named Sarah looked back at the little girl and then back down at me. A smile came across her face as she inched the knife close to my fresh stitches.   
  
“Call the police, Em. I’ll keep her here,” she ordered the other girl, who quickly scurried off to go and find a phone. I stared up at the little girl and could tell from the look on her face that she wasn’t a normal little girl if the fact that she was a living voodoo doll was any indication of that being the case.   
  
“You’re going back to the store.” I threatened her. She giggled and poked the tip of her knife into the gaps in the stitches of my neck. I shuddered and tried to remain perfectly still as she silently threatened me.   
  
“You’re stupid if you think he’s going to let you go after you complete his tasks.” She told me. She may have been a little girl but he had the mind of a deranged killer by the sound of her. I believed her of course, it was something I thought about often. What was going to stop him from turning me into a voodoo doll or something worse?   
  
“What choice do I have?” I asked her, wishing so badly I could simply just shove her off of me. But with how her knife was held at my throat one wrong move and I wouldn’t have Creole close by to save me a second time. The little girl looked down at me and then back up towards upstairs momentarily.   
  
“It’s been almost sixty years and so much has changed. But I do know one thing.” Sarah giggled maniacally as she looked back at me with a deranged look on her face. “I’m going to enjoy carving her like a pumpkin.” She motioned toward the upstairs. I clenched my fists and without even thinking decked the little girl in the face, sending her flying off of me. I acted quickly and started running toward the front door.   
  
I barely got a few feet before I was tackled to the floor. The one time the cops arrived on time and it had to be the time that I was running from them. I kicked and tried to get them off of me but I realized real quickly that that wasn’t going to get me anywhere and simply went limp. My first thought was how my Mom and Dad were going to react to this. As I was shoved into the police cruiser I glanced over to the front door where Sarah and Em were standing staring at me. And Sarah had her arm wrapped around Em and staring with a sadistic smile at me.   
  
When I arrived at the police station I was quickly booked and tossed into an interrogation room. I quickly sat in the corner of the room and curled up in a ball on my chair. All I could think about was how my parents were going to react to this. They had tried so hard to prevent me from going down this path and here I was, under arrest and probably about to be thrown into jail. How exactly could I tell them that I was working for a living voodoo doll, tracking down his escaped voodoo doll children? I sighed as I fumbled around with the handcuffs that were on my wrists to pass the time.   
  
When the door to the interrogation room opened three hours later, I expected the stereotypical overweight cop to be interrogating me. Instead, I was met by a uniformed cop who looked like he’d just seen the most horrendous things that had ever happened. He fumbled around with his keys before unlocking my handcuffs and helping me stand up.   
  
“I’m so sorry. We had no idea of knowing that you worked for Mr. Creole. If you had told us that we wouldn’t have even brought you here.” He was in an absolute panic. His words were going a million miles an hour and it took me a few seconds to process everything. I rubbed my wrists and he quickly exited the room and told me to follow him. The entire station was muttering to themselves as they saw me walk past them.   
  
“You guys know King Creole?” I asked the officer leading me toward the lobby of the station. He looked back at me and sighed as he held onto this bulletproof vest like every cop does.   
  
“We have…an understanding with him. He keeps crime low. We…stay out of his way,” he told me in shame. My mouth dropped at that revelation. It all made sense. How the murders in the house with the lumberjack doll were never investigated, why my ‘missing’ friends weren’t found. Why I was now suddenly being released without so much as a slap on the wrist. He had the police in his pocket.   
  
At the lobby of the station, I was met by a horrifying sight. I had expected Creole to be there to pick me up. But instead, it was Jacob. Or rather what had once been Jacob. His eyes had been replaced by buttons and he was as pale as Creole was. It looked like he had been cut straight down the middle and was being held together by stitches and metal staples. His mouth, unlike Creole’s, was sewn shut and tightly. He bowed down at me as if I was someone important or royalty.   
  
“I take it, this freak is with you?” the officer escorting me asked, to which I nodded and shuddered in fear. I hadn’t known Jacob very well. But to see someone I knew at all turned into one of Creole’s playthings again like Jess, had almost sent me into a full-blown panic attack.   
  
I was realsed into Jacob’s company and he opened the door for me to exit the station. And to my confusion and horror, we had somehow stepped out into the voodoo shop. I looked back at Jacob as he followed me through the door and silently motioned for me to go to the register. I hesitated at first before following his instructions. He went in the back, probably to get his new boss, and left me standing before the counter.   
  
“Mace!” Creole shouted excitedly, his entire body drenched in blood. I shuddered and stepped back as he took his place at the register picked up the template doll from the register and began tossing it up and down in his hand. “Quite the mess you caused. You left me to clean it up.” He teased me as he continued to toss the doll up and down.   
  
“I-I’m sorry, sir.” I apologized submissively, staring down at the floor like a child about to be scolded. “It just…all got out of hand.” That could be used to explain my current situation or my entire life since first breaking into this hellhole.   
  
“Apology accepted. It felt nice to step out of the shop for once,” he said as he stopped tossing the doll up and down and pointed with a bloodstained gloved finger toward the wall of voodoo dolls. I followed his gaze and saw that Sarah had been returned to voodoo doll form and was back on the wall, much higher up this time. “Unfortunately I didn’t get there in time to save poor Miss Emily.” He sighed sadly, his finger drifting down toward a doll just under Sarah,   
  
I covered my mouth in horror as I saw a doll that looked exactly like Emily under her. “What happened?” I asked him. He looked at me and held up his finger to his bloodstained face.   
  
“It’s better ya don’t know.” He hummed out. “Sarah was quite the little murderer back in the 50s. You wouldn’t believe the amount of trouble I had getting her to walk into my shop,” he said with a smile as he tossed the template doll back on the register and leaned in closer to me.   
  
“Even though you failed to get her back, I’ll still count this as your favor done.” He held up two fingers. “Two more to go.” I nodded and reached up to pick at my stitches, just wanting some way to relieve the mounting stress and anxiety building up inside of me.   
  
“Do you…have something to hide these?” I asked, pointing toward my wound. He looked at me and slapped the register table. I thought he was about to fly off the hinges and tear me apart or something, but instead, he looked shocked.   
  
“Dear me, where is my head at?! Of course, darling. One moment. Jacob my boy?” He snapped his fingers toward the now mute Jacob. He went rigid like a soldier at attention, ready to receive whatever order his new boss had for him. “Go into my office and fetch the ointment for lil’ Miss Macedonia here.” He ordered and Jacob dutifully nodded and walked back toward Creole’s office.   
  
I was left alone with him as Jacob went to get my ointment. He stared at me with his button eyes for an uncomfortable amount of time. When the banging started up again from the basement door I watched as his face contorted from his usual cheerily creepy smile to one of annoyance and rage. When Jacob finally returned with the ointment it wasn’t quick enough. I took it from him and was so happy that it came with instructions.   
  
I left the shop just as Creole stood up to go toward the basement. I applied the ointment as I walked along the sidewalk back toward my house. To my immense relief, I watched through my phone as the hideous scar and stitches disappeared before my eyes. I was left with a horrifying dilemma.   
  
When Creole was done with me, would he turn me into a voodoo doll? Or a mutilated living corpse like Jacob.
