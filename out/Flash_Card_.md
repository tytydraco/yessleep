I'm currently a freshman in college. I came home this past week for a funeral, but let's backtrack a little. My senior year in high school, I was in the library during study hall, doing some computer science work on the computer since my laptop at home didn't have JCreator on it. Anyways, this boy who was in my class sat next to me since those two computers were the only ones with JCreator. He was a really tall, very pale boy. He had long black hair that covered one of his eyes. He wore an Anti-Flag T-shirt, a ripped jean jacket, and Doc Martens. He never spoke to anyone in class, and I'd never seen him with anyone else, so I took a seat. He looked up at me like I committed murder.

 I quickly looked away and started rummaging through my bag as a distraction. With my head down, I heard him chuckle and then mumble. Of course, I froze with my head still down towards my bag. I just dismissed it as him talking to his computer, as code can be quite frustrating. I sat back up and quickly typed in my login details to break the awkwardness. I said, "She assigns too much homework; I can barely keep up." His gaze stayed locked on the computer screen. "You want the answers, don't you?" I left and said, "No thanks, I won't learn anything that way." Usually, I would have said yes, but I didn't want to see his evil stare again. It was like he was staring into my soul. He left again with a creepy laugh, so creepy that I had to close my eyes and cringe. I opened them and looked over to see he was gone. The strange thing was he left his flash drive. I waited about ten minutes to see if he would come back, but he didnâ€™t. Study hall ended at 1:00, and it was 12:50. I decided I'll take it and give it back to him tomorrow in computer science class. I threw it in a little box above my bed. Gotta admit, it was an awesome flash drive. It was a Swiss Army knife with the flash drive in the middle.

Here's the crazy part: after that, he never came to school again. He was notorious for being absent, so for the first month, no one batted an eye. However, May rolled around, and we were all getting ready to graduate. I had completely forgotten about the flash drive until two days ago when I came home. I needed one and remembered I still had that boy's. I scanned it with my Norton, and it said it was all safe. I was planning to delete all this stuff so I could put my PowerPoint for business class on it. Naturally, I started snooping through his files. The first thing I saw was a folder named "Computer Science." I opened it, and all the answers to every assignment were there. I thought, "Damn, maybe that's why he left it so I could copy off of him. Maybe because he knew he was never coming back."

I went back in. The second folder was "Music." I kind of had to open that one to see what he listened to. Surprisingly, it was not what I expected. There were only three songs: "Running on Empty" by Jackson Browne, "White Rabbit" by Jefferson Airplane, and "Helter Skelter" by The Beatles. I went back again. There was an untitled folder. Inside it was "AP Literature." There were a bunch of essays and various junk. There was one called "The Best Doc." I opened it, and it was merely a ten-page document of notebook pages filled entirely with his first and last name handwritten.

I went back again. This is where it gets weird. He had taken pictures of the emergency escape plan posters on the door in every classroom. There was a picture of a lit cigarette on the bathroom floor and another picture of some coins on the bathroom floor with a yellow post-it note next to it saying "CHUMP CHANGE" in all caps. Now, this is the weird part: there was a picture of me taken while I was reading a book in class. From the looks of it, it was my English class that he was not in. There was also a document titled "Rest in Peace to..." but it was empty when I opened it. I still have no idea if this was a joke or not. For all I know, he never showed up again because he realized that he lost his hard drive.
