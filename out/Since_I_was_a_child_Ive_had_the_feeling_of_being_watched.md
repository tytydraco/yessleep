Ever since I was a child I had the haunting feeling of being watched. It was a sickening feeling that continued to give me a sense of dread into adulthood. In the dead of night, any object in my room could have been a figure or a silhouette peering at me from a corner. “A trick of the mind”, id tell myself. Which, that’s what it was, just my mind playing with me. Convincing me that the shadows in my room were figures there to do unknown things to me.

What I wasn’t imaging was the feeling of the presence.

Paranoia. That’s what I told myself. Even if the images of figures watching me were just my descent to madness, something was there. Watching me while I was alone. On late nights, when the quiet of the night brings that deafening ring, id sit in fear. Waiting to see someone peering at me from any direction, but nothing was there. Nothing that is, besides the constant nagging feeling that something was in the air.

Eventually I would sleep with the lights on, a habit I’ve kept into my adult life. Besides my mind swearing that there were figures in my corners, I couldn’t help but feel as though having the lights off gave it an advantage to get closer to me. Id fear that in the dark, it could reach the edge of my bed, instead of being confined to the corners.

At an age too young to remember, I began to awake every night at the same time.

3:00 AM.

Whether it was to use the bathroom, or to readjust in bed, it was always the same time.

This time was always the most active id feel the presence. As if my instincts had woke me up due to some unseen force. Sometimes id wake up paralyzed with fear. Knowing that if I opened my eyes, something would be there. It would feel so close, almost as if it was hovering above me.

In these instances, I would simple remain motionless, eyes closed, until I hopefully drifted back to sleep.

Sometimes these instances would be sleep paralysis, in which my mind would manifest the presence in the most horrifying ways. As I said before, this was my decent into madness.

In my teen years it appeared to me. As I fell asleep on my parent’s couch, sitting upright while watching tv. I awoke unable to move, with the TV off, and dim light peering in from the kitchen. It began with a sense of dread, followed by the weight of hands on my shoulders. From the angle of the couch, the only way it could have done this was if it had been crawling down the wall. I could then feel cold smooth skin rub against the side of my face, as a grey skin appeared in my immediate peripheral vision. As the head traveled further down, I saw a mouth open of decayed teeth, as it pressed itself into my chest.

I awoke immediately, snapped to reality. The humming of electronics and the night noise through the window returning.

When I moved into my first apartment, it followed me, and it let me know.

One night, woken, paralyzed by fear. I felt it above me. Feet away from me. I laid awake; eyes closed. As I wished and prayed that sleep would take me, I felt its presence slowly floating lower towards me. I prayed, shaking, that this nightmare would be over, until I felt its weight gradually pressing into the bed behind me.

I shot out of bed and made my way across the room. Collapsing into a corner staring at where my bed was. There was nothing in sight, except the feeling that it was sitting on my bed looking directly at me. I could feel as though I was looking directly into its eyes.

I don’t know how long I stared in its direction, unable to move. Until I finally drifted back to sleep.

Over the next year I could always feel it at night. It existed in every shadow. As I cooked in my kitchen I could feel it in the next room, staying just out of sight sitting avoiding the light from the doorway. When I used the bathroom, and turned off the light I could feel it appear. Standing in the room I just was.

The next time I saw it, I woke in an instance of sleep paralysis. I remember it as I do dreams. With only bits and pieces, the images manifesting as if seeing them underwater. This time I did not keep my eyes closed. I had fallen asleep on my side. My arm hanging off the side of the bed. As I gradually opened my eyes, I could see a grey thing crouched next to me. Its hands on my arm licking my fingers.

I did not dart, I did not run, I laid still watching as it tasted my hand. The strangest part was that I could feel none of it. I could not feel its hands, or its disgusting tongue intertwining between my fingers. I drifted back to sleep.

It’s been another year, and I still feel it. As long as I keep the lights on, it keeps its distance. Standing just out of sight. I don’t feel in immediate danger, or that it has ever wanted to put me in danger. I’ve never felt hate or malice from it. As strange as that is. I don’t know what it wants, or why it is so interested in me. I’ve come to terms that it is there, and that it always will be.
