Exactly what the title says. I live in a small town. A nothing town you've probably never heard of- but more importantly... I can't exactly tell you where it is. 

I'm 20 years old. So I'm a legal adult and I'm allowed to leave this place. I want to. I've tried. But the furthest I've gotten is a ghost town just outside of ours. Which was fine- I tried again. But there's one in every other direction. I've been trying for two years now. 

Before you ask, yes I've tried GPS. I've tried Google maps. I've asked around. It's just Saintviews. That's what everyone calls it. And has called it since I was born. My mom and dad. My favourite algebra teacher who got me through high-school. My neighbors, friends. The homeless guy on the corner who I'm pretty sure used to be a police officer- a soldier or something like that. They all say the same thing 

"This is Saintviews. How's the college search going? Need references?"

"We're in Saintviews, dear, are you feeling okay? You look like you've got a temperature..."

"Saintviews. Why? Are you high or somethin'? You know thats my thing. You're the stable friend. It's the charm of our dynamic"

"Where else? Saintviews. Hey son? Could you spare any loose change?"

I'm stuck here. And I don't even know where, 'here', is. 

With the reality that I can't leave setting in- that might be stuck with my parents, the same people I've known my whole life, same neighbors, stores and parking-lots. There's a bitterness in accepting what I've kept in my periphery. 

I've seen a few posts on this site. Talking about strange stuff? This subreddit in particular. I'm just hoping anyone can help me leave this place. 

It all started with that cloud.

It was a Wednesday. And I had a date. He was cute, funny, and I was having a good time. He planned a picnic, right in the dog park near the Presbyterian church. He had a husky, Donny. That dog absolutely loved him and was beyond friendly. It drooled on my shoes while I was petting it. Looking up at me with mismatched eyes and a flapping tongue. 

I had a good time, we sat and ate. He made us sandwiches. I brought some fruit- grapes, apples, you name it. And the evening air was warm from the scorching midday sun. 

At some point, we laid down. Staring at the sky and making shapes of the floating clouds. Assigning meaning from their shade and speed. 

The conversation was existentialism at its finest. Meaning-of-life shit and, I'll be honest, I was falling for this man.

I'm not sure if he noticed it. But... there's one. A cloud- completely unassuming in its snow white fluff. Ofcourse I've never paid it any mind. It's plain, mundane. It's just... there. 

It doesn't shift with the rest. It doesn't fold in on itself, swirling it's shade with its herd. It remains unsullied. Completely pure, and visibly at home. 

I point it out. And he lets out a chuckle. 

"I'm not sure I'm creative enough to work with that one"

I laughed. Because what else do I do? 

The date went well. And I went home. 

The best way I can describe the feeling of that thing hovering in place is- do you know those "find the picture" games in the back of old magazines and newspapers? Children's books? Once you find whatever it is they asked for, the entire picture will never be the same. It makes less sense yet feels more complete. 

Or on a lesser note- when you learn a new word and suddenly see it everywhere? It's not out of nowhere- you just haven't had your eye out for it- until now. 

And fuck me- it triggered some weird domino affect. 

I wrote down how it all happened in my journal. Just to make sure I'm not losing it. And here are the entires.



Saturday- August 23

I work at a rundown Cafe. It's not much. But Mike- my manager is a sweetheart. And the customers all know me- small town and all. It's a nice gig. 

Just after leaving my shift- earlier today because it it's the weekend. A Saturday afternoon. At 3pm and the sun was just starting to show us mercy. 

I was mindlessly searching up strange occurrences with clouds. Aliens were the leading theory on random sites. But I can't say I believe in that stuff. Too far fetched. 

And as I scoffed at the ideas presented to me, I lifted my head. My eyes carelessly glancing at the playground I'm wandering passed. 

The kids... were staring. 

I don't think I had anything particularly interesting to earn all that attention. And kids are naturally curious afterall, for better or worse- but this was different. Whether sat at the base of a hot-to-the-touch, plastic slide. Or stood under the shade of that willow tree that whistles in the wind at night. About a dozen of them- just stood practically unblinking. 

Their precious eyes followed me as a stumbled in my pace. Their cheeks flushed with an odd excitement. 

I walked faster. 

... 

Wednesday- 27 August 

I haven't eaten in days. Why? Well everything tastes like metal. I know it sounds ridiculous but that's the best way to describe the taste. My moms stews. My dad's meatloaf. My cereal. The bread and coffee in the Cafe. All of it tastes metallic.

Stranger still- nobody else seems concerned. Nobody else seems to notice the taste.

Maybe it's just something wrong with me? But why do I have a hard time believing that?

Why don't I power through it? A mouth dripping with blood or filled with coins. Imagine eating that. 

I guess I'm just gritting my teeth through it.

Sunday- 31 August 

I forgot my umbrella. And it started raining. Backwards. I swear to God- it did. 

I was on my walk home. Still in my work uniform and in a filthy mood over the building clouds above me. They were dark with anticipation and I knew I wouldn't make it in time. The only day I decide to leave my umbrella- typical. 

Then the droplets seeped their way out of the tar on the roads. The grass on lawns. Rooftops of homes I've walked passed countless times. 

At first I didn't notice it. The way you don't immediately notice it when it starts raining the normal way. But then I felt a drop on the underside of my chin. My clothes getting wet in an order that felt like a million fingertips on the skin. 

I ran home. 

It poured. Is poured even the right word? 

I got home drenched. And my parents commented on the rain but, you guessed it, as if it was ordinary rainfall. 

I undressed, got into something warm and accepted my insanity. I'm the problem. 

Something is very very wrong with me. 

...

Saturday- 1 September. 

I'm not the problem. 

I have a few life long friends in this town. Or at least- had. 

They don't remember me. 

I can't retell the details of what happened. I'd like to keep some things private. But yeah- they don't remember me. 

I'm hoping it's a sick joke. I'd be pissed but I'd forgive them. Instead... I'm here, hunched over on my desk writing this. It's raining backwards outside... again.  Rivulets sliding up my window. And unless my friends are also a figment of my imagination, something is very wrong. 

And I'm scared.

...

Thursday- 6 September. 

That cloud's been there for 17 years. 

Turns out losing your friends. And your parents- (long story). All in under one week makes you sentimental. 

Renting a motel room for a night or two while while trying to contact more family members... most of them of them not responding, and some don't recognize my voice. 

Old photos become a refuge. And I can't even have that. 

That thing mocks me in the background of my polaroid with Matthew. Buck tooths, missing in our three year old grins. And a fluffy phantom, hovering just above the willow tree. 

Still white. Still unflinching. 

I don't know what to do.

...




So yeah. I'm on my bed. Typing this out. I had a good night's sleep and I'm calling in sick today because I need to figure this out. Does anyone have information regarding where I could be. What's happening. And why only I seem to be noticing?

Please help me
