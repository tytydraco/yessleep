My sister had just gone missing without a trace. The police were baffled, unable to determine what had happened or why she had vanished. All we found in her room was a note, written in bold red pen, with just two words: “Redcrow Road.” It was cryptic and unnerving. Searching online yielded no results for any road by that name, which only added to the mystery. Moreover, our house was equipped with security cameras, yet they hadn’t captured any footage of her leaving. The case quickly went cold, leaving us with more questions than answers.

Curiosity gnawed at me, haunting every step I took. One afternoon, on my way home from school, I spotted a weather-beaten street sign that read “Redcrow Road.” My heart skipped a beat. This mysterious road, absent from all maps and searches, suddenly materialized before me. With a mix of dread and determination, I ventured down the narrow, unpaved path.

The road wound through dense woodland until it led me to a solitary barn. In our rural area, such sights were not uncommon, but this barn felt different—ominous, almost foreboding. As I approached, an elderly farmer emerged from the shadows. His eyes were weathered, his face etched with lines of hardship.

“Can I help ya, son?” he asked gruffly, though his gaze was evasive.

“I’m looking for answers,” I replied, trying to keep my voice steady despite the churning uncertainty within me. “My sister… she went missing, and there’s this note…”

The farmer’s expression hardened briefly before softening into a feigned ignorance. “Sorry to hear ‘bout yer sister. Can’t say I know anythin’ ’bout that.”

But I saw through his facade. His unease betrayed him. Ignoring his attempts to brush me off, I circled around the barn, searching for any clue that might lead me to the truth. As I stepped inside, the heavy wooden door slammed shut behind me with a chilling finality.

I turned around, expecting to face the farmer, but instead, a gaunt figure greeted me—an old man with wild, unkempt hair and eyes that gleamed with madness. His breath reeked of decayed fish.

“You look lost, son,” he muttered, a sinister grin spreading across his cracked lips. “Let me help you find what you seek.”

Fear surged through me, and I recoiled, trying to back away. But his grip on my arm was vice-like, pulling me towards the barn’s exit. Panic rising, I screamed for help.

In a heartbeat, the farmer burst through the door, shotgun in hand. Without hesitation, he aimed and fired. The shot echoed deafeningly in the confined space. The old man stumbled back, a look of disbelief contorting his features before he collapsed to the ground, lifeless.

Shaking and trembling, I turned to the farmer, expecting relief but instead finding horror. Hanging from a hook on the barn wall was the severed head of my sister. Shock and grief mingled as realization dawned—the farmer was not my rescuer but a sinister participant in this macabre charade.

As he leveled the shotgun at me once more, his eyes cold and devoid of remorse, I knew then what my sister must have faced in her final moments. With tears streaming down my face, I braced myself for the inevitable as he cocked the gun, sealing my fate on that desolate stretch of Redcrow Road.
