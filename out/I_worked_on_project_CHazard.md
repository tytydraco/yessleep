Hello everyone. My name is Dr. Richard Stevenson. In the 70s, I worked on a secret government project known as project C-Hazard. 

Throughout the year or so that I worked on it, I produced 3 logs, describing the nature of the project, the goal, and the results. 

This will be the last thing I’ll ever write about it.




Log I


My name is Dr. Richard Stevenson. This is the first log documenting the project currently known as Project C-Hazard. It is the third of November, 1972, and the United States of America are in what is hopefully the end times of the Cold War against the Soviet Union. 

Earlier this year, a CIA researcher proposed a theoretical, hypereffective new type of weaponry that a soldier could carry completely in their mind. A ‘fact’ of sorts. A theoretical piece of knowledge so dangerous, and so devastating that anyone receiving that knowledge would see no way in which to continue on living. He referred to this type of weaponry as a ‘Cognitohazard’. The CIA researcher, a man named Dr. Steward Lennon, was a dear friend and earlier colleague of mine, so when the CIA approved the development of the Cognitohazard, he asked me to function as the team leader. I was 56 years of age, and I had been doing independent research in the field of cognitive psychology for over twenty years at that point, and so, intrigued by the idea, I accepted.

Over the following months, me and Dr. Lennon recruited a small, but highly knowledgeable and trustworthy group of specialists. The four doctors recruited were as follows: Dr. Dan Stallwart, highly experienced in the study of memory, Dr. Lisa Markusson, specialized within the field of neuroscience. Dr. Henrietta Goldenbaum, one of the country’s leading experts in the field of pandemics, and how diseases spread throughout a population, and Dr. Ray Dean, an expert on mnemonic devices and mental compression of information. 

With the team now set up, we reported to the CIA, who had decided that all six of us would need to go through mental conditioning if we were to undertake the development of this weapon. None of us had any protests here. If we are to develop an idea in which the knowledge of it is enough to kill a man, we all need iron wills. The details of the conditioning will not be disclosed here, but do know that it was a grueling few months of intensive training from morning to evening. The experience had most of us on the verge of quitting multiple times, though we all knew how the CIA would have looked upon that, and we were still all highly invested in the project, so we stayed.

The lab from which we were operating was no ordinary lab. There were no chemicals or anything along those lines, because the weapon would be mental. We had chalk, pens, blackboards and noteblocks , and that was about it. A little more morbidly, we also had access to a long line of death-row inmates on which we could ‘test’ whatever phrase or idea we would come up with. I was not keen on this at all, nor were most of the team, but Dr. Lennon had assured us that it was a necessity. We needed to figure out whether or not our weapon was working, and, as Dr. Lennon reminded us, they would all be killed anyway.

We got to work quickly, brainstorming all sorts of ideas and things that we ourselves found horrifying. Ideas of war, hells, infinite torment. Other such matters. But telling a person about the idea of hell is not going to make them want to take their own life. We needed to find a way to convince any given person, that if they were to continue on living, they would experience something so horrifying, so terrible, that it would be favorable for them to not spend a second more in this cruel world.

We considered making use of something along the lines of a modified Ludovico Technique. We needed a way to plant information deeply into the target, and that could certainly be done in this way. Dr. Goldenbaum, however, disagreed with this approach. “We need to construct a simple word or phrase. Otherwise, it will not be able to spread once inside Soviet borders.”

She made a good point. The modified Ludovico may be enough to convince a person to commit suicide, but we wanted the target to spread the cognitive weapon to those around them before dying. We needed a phrase. And so, the real work began. We knew what we needed to make, now we just needed to make it.




Log II


Over the course of the first four months of the research period, it became clear to us that there was no single phrase that alone could prompt an otherwise sane person to take their own life. Even if there was, we would not be able to make use of an English phrase, as this would grant many of the soviets immunity. This need for a Russian phrase served as a major road block. None of us knew Russian, and getting another person on board would not only be a massive security risk, but would also mean that that individual would need to go through months of training. 

Here, Dr. Dean chimed in. “What if we do not need the phrase to be in Russian?”. The rest of us looked at him, confused, but nonetheless intrigued. “You see, what if the language and meaning of the word isn’t what we should be focused on? If we could make a phrase that acted like a sort of seed in the unconscious. The target wouldn’t need to understand the phrase. They would spread it, wondering what it means, and then, over a few days, the seed in their unconscious mind would blossom into a horrid dread. They’ll never even know what it meant”.

While we all agreed that this idea was worth pursuing, I asked him, “What sort of phrase should it be then? If it’s too simple a sound, surely it would have been known by now, and if it’s too complicated, the target won’t be able to recall it, and therefore left unable to spread it”. “Good point” Dr. Dean agreed. “We need it to be short”.

We brainstormed for a few more days, and eventually, I realized something we hadn’t thought about yet. We could make it short, and instead, make it unique by using specific unusual pronunciation. It would almost be like putting someone into a partial trance.

From here, Dr. Markusson, the neurologist of the team, took over. We needed a specific short series of sounds to stimulate extreme rising dread in the brain over the course of a few days, and she knew the brain better than any of us. While working under this approach, it became clear that the phrase itself did not actually matter much. As long as it could be pronounced in a way so that it would layer itself in the target's unconscious, any phrase would work.

Eventually we found a phrase that had the elements needed for the specific pronunciation to create this suicide-inducing sense of dread. We chose a Latin phrase. “Infernos Aeternus Est”. Now, reading this phrase poses no danger unless the reader knows the hyperspecific way in which it is to be pronounced. This pronunciation is so strange, that there is next to no chance of figuring it out without hearing it. It was perfect.

We quickly went to test the phrase on the death-row inmates, and though I felt a natural sorrow seeing them die like that, seemingly from nothing, I must admit that there was a sort of satisfaction in it as well.


We had done it.




Log III


Shortly after the trials on the inmates, we informed the CIA. We told them that we had developed the weapon, and that our personal training had been sufficient to withstand it. As such, they started training a handful of special agents to withstand the Cognitohazard. Everything was on the right track, until one morning, when Dr. Markusson didn’t come in for work.

None of us had taken a single sick day at this point. We had been sick from time to time, of course, but the work had been too important, and too interesting, as well. Dr. Dean, who had been working alongside Dr. Markusson before the project, went to check on her. When he got back to the office, he told us of his discovery.

-

“Dr. Markusson lived in a suburban neighborhood along with her husband and their two children. I had been over multiple times before, and knew all members of the family by name. As I approached, the door had been locked, but an extra key was sticking out from the side of the ‘Welcome’ mat in front of the door.”

“I let myself in, announcing my presence as I entered, but there was no response. I hesitated to walk in further, as it felt like a gross overstepping of privacy, but something seemed highly odd about the whole situation, so I pressed on.”

“When I got to the bedroom of Dr. Markusson and her husband, I was horrified to find both of their corpses laying on the bed, clearly as a result of suicide by overdose. There were three empty bottles of oxycodone laying next to the bed.”

“I quickly made my way to their first child’s bedroom. A seventeen year old girl. I burst into the room, but she, too, was gone already. The artery on her left arm had been sliced all the way from top to bottom, the scissor still laying by the foot of the bed.”

“I called up the number the CIA had given us, while running to check on their eight year old son. His room was on the first floor of the house. I barged in, only to find the room empty, and the window open. The ground beneath was made up of hard stone tiles.”

“The CIA showed up in a black van in a matter of minutes and took me back here. I asked them how they were going to explain this apparent quadruple family suicide to the public, but they told me that that was not for me to worry about.”

-

We all sat there in silence for a few seconds. We had seen Dr. Markusson the day before, and she had seemed fine. It was clear to us that the family had been exposed to the Cognitohazard, but how? Had she told them?

Dr. Lennon suddenly got up. “I need to go check on my family”, he said. “What is it? Did you figure it out?” We all asked, confused. He cast us a horrified look whilst walking out the door. “Dr. Markusson told them” he said. “Dr. Markusson told her husband in her sleep.” 


We all hurried home, and we were all met by the same thing. 

-

It makes sense now. Dr. Markusson had told her husband while sleeptalking, and so, at some point during the following day, he must have mentioned the bizarre phrase to his kids. Then, upon finding her family dead, she crawled back into bed with her husband, and overdosed on the remaining oxycodone in a mix of grief and guilt.

The others met similar fates upon finding their families, and I almost did too. I am the only one left who still knows the pronunciation, and I shall make sure that it comes to the grave with me when I go.
