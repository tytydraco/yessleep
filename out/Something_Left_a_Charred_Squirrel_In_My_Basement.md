I’ve never been able to smell. Not once, my entire life. I’d been to multiple doctors when I was young about it. Some said it was something with my brain, but CT Scans & MRIs always came back without anything proving such. Some of them said it was something in my nose, a slightly misshapen bone, or something of that nature. But as usual, nothing came out of it. At some point, it just got too expensive for my parents, who already were quite busy sitting on the couch most of the day, to go to the doctors anymore over something that really wouldn’t affect me all too much. And, in all fairness, it really hasn’t. Never had to smell no fart nor a recently deceased skunk. I can still taste funnily enough, despite other people I know constantly saying things such as 

“You can’t taste because your nose receptors are connected to your taste ones!”

But I know I can taste it because I like chocolate milk more than normal milk. Though don’t be mistaken, it’s not all great. I will never smell the scent of a rose, nor smell the freshly baked pie, levitating towards it slowly, nor for me to ever smell the scent of a candle bought for me as a gift by some distant family member that doesn’t know about my condition. Sorry Aunt Rebecca, I really would love the gift if it was anything more than a fire hazard for me. So until recently, I never expected to experience any smell in my life. Yet, something changed.



A few years back I managed to save up enough money to fully move out on my own, with my black labrador, Jessie. It was a small house, only 1 story if you excluded the basement. The entrance door would always bang into the wall next to it when I opened it, but it was no big deal since no one really ever noticed the dent in the wall next to the door. The door opened to the kitchen, which was small. Had a countertop that would barely fit a watermelon, a stove that doubled as an oven, a fridge, and some pantries. I also bought a table that was large enough to house at least 6 guests for when they visited, but I rarely had anyone over except for my older brother, Brandon.



 He would occasionally visit when he or I needed help, or to just spend some time with his bro. He was a taller person, had glasses, a thin beard, and brown messy hair. Next to the kitchen was a long hallway that led to the bathroom, the guest room, and at the very end of the hall, my bedroom. My bed was small, dark purple sheets I got on sale at some thrift store a couple years back. On the other side of the kitchen was yet another hallway, but instead of being straight down like the first, it went sideways either way. One way was to the basement, which was a staircase that had a sudden 45 degree turn half-way through. The basement itself was a long room, I’d say it was about half the size of the house even. Near the end of the stairs was a door that led to a storage room, which was the other half of the house. The light switch was at the bottom of the stairs, so I could only see what was down there when I got to the bottom.



 I renovated it to be a nice living room like space, having a tv, a long leather couch that could recline individual segments, and a coffee table. Though this wasn’t really needed, since the other way the hall went was to the upstairs living room, which had a larger tv, more space, and 4 individual chairs. This room also had a glass back door, with shades and locks of course. It was a nice and cozy house, and Jessie loved it. He was a good boy, when I brought him out back so he could relieve himself he would never try to jump over the fences, or kill the baby bunnies in there like my dad’s dog, Elmer. Elmer was a fat pug might I add, so those bunnies were part of natural selection. But of course Jessie had his problems too, like all dogs. 



When he started barking at something, he would not stop until he had exhausted himself out, and when he had something in his mouth, he would growl at those who tried to take it from him, never would bite though. Other than that, he loved new people, would always jump up on them and try to lick their ears, learned behavior from Elmer. Life was routine. I worked as a mortician, since the smell of bodies never affected me other than making me smell like one according to others. It paid well, good enough to support my lifestyle. The sight of dead bodies, especially in the more gruesome cases, was sickening at first. Made me get plenty of nightmares, and lost me plenty of sleep. But eventually, I got used to seeing dead people nearly every day, and it was no longer a problem for me.



Recently, however, some strange things have happened. It was barely anything at first, small things that I thought were a byproduct of me working at a morgue. House centipedes started appearing in my basement. This was never uncommon in my house, but I mean I would find dozens of them hidden under a shirt I had left on the ground. They would skitter away into the storage room before I had time to squish any of the things. I knew they were good for some situations, since they apparently ate cockroaches and such, but this was too many for my liking. So, after finding almost 100 hiding under my chair, I decided to pack enough clothes for a week, brought dog food and some chew toys, and went to a hotel for a week whilst an exterminator company named ULTRA-EXTERMINATORS dealt with the issue.

“How long will it be?” I asked the receptionist on the phone.

“Well while I cannot say exactly how long it will take, most cases like this take around 4-5 days.” the woman responded, with an overly-cheerful tone that made me somewhat spiteful of her.



The hotel Jessie and I stayed at was quite decent, actually, but was way over-priced in my opinion. It was a small room, the red blankets on the bed strongly tucked in, to the point where I couldn’t get them out of the sides without falling on my ass. There was a small dirty bathroom connected to the room, near the end of the room. The towels, tub, nor toilet seat had been washed in what looked like years. I never used it, I would always use the one in the mini-restaurant at the bottom of the hotel instead.  There was a glass sliding door that led to a balcony that had a lake-side view. It was beautiful, in  all honesty. I could stare at it for hours, wouldn’t I get so bored staring at it. I do art in my spare time, so it made for a decent still life portrait that I would later throw away due to lack of space to keep it.

When I opened my suitcase so I could get out a robe or something else comfortable to sleep in, I was met by a surprise dozen or so house centipedes that had managed to use my luggage to escape certain death. Since I had nothing better to do, and many hours still remained of the day, I chased them all down for the next hour and a half until I was sure every single one was dead. I’m pretty sure Jessie actually managed to find and eat one. After a long day of doing next to nothing but driving and killing house centipedes, I walked over to the barely made bed that the hotel had left me, jumped onto it, laid down, and grabbed the remote next to me. It took me a bit to find something suitable on cable TV, but eventually I found a western movie marathon. I turned it on, and promptly passed out.



 When I awoke, the TV had seemingly turned off by itself. Rather I had done it while half asleep and didn’t remember, or Jessie had turned it off by accident. The lights of cars passing by and other buildings nearby barely were able to illuminate the room, the curtains blocking them. What did light up the room was the still on bathroom light, which I was damn sure I had turned off. For a good minute, I was afraid an intruder had broken in, somehow. But the entrance door was still locked, and there was no way onto the balcony unless someone could climb a flat 7 story brick wall. I slowly arose, grabbing the pen next to my bed, hoping that the pen would somehow threaten the intruder enough for him to leave, or defend me against whatever actual weapon he probably had on him. When I entered the bathroom, there was no human life in there except for me and the shit stains on the toilet seat. I made sure as well to double check every corner of that hotel room and its bathroom, but there was no one there. When I had finally settled down, I looked at the analog clock that glowed a faint red next to the bed I had chosen to sleep in. 4:02 AM, it said. It was late, I was tired and spooked. I wanted to sleep. I used what little energy and consciousness to walk to the bathroom to turn the light off. When I flipped the switch, nothing happened. The switch was broken, which meant even when I shut the bathroom door, there would be a faint glowing white light illuminating almost everything in the room through the cracks of the door. It wasn’t horrible, and I had slept through worse, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t still annoying. As I went to close the door, I looked at the ground of the bathroom, and saw another house centipede.



When I got home, and the place had been swept in and out by the ULTRA-EXTERMINATORs, I didn’t see another centipede after that.



“By the way, you gots black mold in your basement,” commented one of the employees on their way out. 



He was fat, looked around 40. He sported a brown beard, and brown hair, both were curly. I’d say his hairstyle was between a mohawk and a bowl cut.



“Don’t exterminators usually take care of mold?” I asked the guy, whose name tag read John



“Some do, not our company though. Plus, you only paid for the bugs” he responded



I’d actually never hired exterminators myself, nor been in a house that needed some before this, so I didn’t really know if he was bullshiting me or not. When I went into the basement, there wasn’t a spot of black mold to be found. But, when I entered the storage room next to it, it turns out the company moved much of the things in there, presumably to get all the centipede’s hiding spots. Under where many of the boxes used to be, were indeed splotches of black mold burned into the floor. I didn’t feel like going back to the hotel or spending even more money to get someone to clean it, so over the next few days, I pulled the carpet out and got as much black mold out as I could. The texture was disgusting, it felt like…black mold. But once it was all said and done, I decided while I was at it, I would also reorganize the storage room to be more neat. As it stood, everything was out of place, the Christmas tree was mixed with the Halloween decorations, and bicycles were stabbed with screwdrivers.



 After a while of reorganization and a hundred things I put aside for birthday and Christmas decorations later, I managed to find a few boxes full of sketch books, oil paintings, and sculptures. I decided to sit down and flip through the memories of my arts. I never did it as a profession, but I did occasionally take classes in school. I had become quite good at it, and even occasionally got paid to draw certain things for people in high school. Some of the commissions were still in my possession, one of a person’s pet, one of a couple sitting together, and so on. I also had most of my oil paintings I did for enjoyment when my childhood house lost power during storms. One was of the planet Saturn, lost in the infinite void of space. Another was the snowstorm that cut power to the house itself. I remember I sat outside while I drew it at night, and I got a bad fever for the next couple days. There was a dark blue overtaking the snow, the only illuminance being the light from the lantern next to me. The sky was pitch black, not the moon nor any star managing to bloom through.



 Then there was a painting I didn’t remember creating. Now, I always remember every time I draw something. Even in my early years, in my oldest sketchbooks, I could faintly remember drawing it or being proud of the finished product. But this painting…I didn’t make it. It couldn’t have been mine. The shapes were abstract, but the lighting was very real. It was of some white trapezoid, with black square holes in it occasionally. There were trees around it, red leaves and broken branches. The more I stared, the more I realized the trapezoid looked like the front of my house. The black squares were my windows, and within each and every window was black mold, except for my bedroom window. The sky was completely black. Not black like the winter painting, but complete darkness. I think whoever made the painting had to have had to buy some of that special dark paint that absorbs all light, I'd seen it on youtube once. The grass was all dead, and lying there in the grass was my body, my blood spilling out onto the yellowish dying grass. 



I began to panic. I searched through the rest of the bins, attempting to find any more paintings like this, with no success. A thought crossed my mind that this may have been Brandon’s doing, a bad prank last time he had left. After all, he was known for being a bit of an asshole occasionally when it came to doing things like pranks, but it couldn’t be. The lighting and details were too good for Brandon, hell, they were too good for even me. I searched my mind for even a hint of a memory that I had drawn this, that the memory simply slipped my mind, but nothing. Eventually, I convinced myself I probably did this one while drunk. How else could I have explained it? A person silently broke into my house and drew a detailed and abstract picture of me dead on my lawn and then just left? How silly of me! Plus, I had drawn drunk twice before, but not with as much detail and care as the painting had. But just because I maybe had made the thing did not mean I wanted to keep it around. I got off of my knees, held the painting high in the air, and brought it down to my kneecap, snapping it in half. After which I threw it in a garbage bag by the door of the storage room. 



After I'd say two hours later, I had finished tidying up the room. By the end, I can proudly say it looked slightly better than before. It was still a room with boxes, and a likely awful smell that I had no idea of, and nothing else. I grabbed the trash bags waiting for me at the door, and brought them outside. It was late at night, I could tell by the moon being in the middle of the sky. I had work the next morning at 6, so I frowned at the loss of sleep I already had ahead of me. It was cold for a fall night, the wind blowing unforgivingly and leaves occasionally hitting me. I went around to the side of my house, and threw them into the overflowing trash bin. Before I left, something fell out of one of the bags through a tear. I went to pick it up, and it was the painting I had discovered. This time, I noticed a detail I hadn’t seen before. One of the molds in the window was shaped like a person. At least I think it was a person? It had a long snout, a neck, and the body of a woman. It was strange, sure, but I chalked it up to pattern recognition where there wasn’t any real pattern. When I got back in the house, Jessie was at the top of the staircase. He was whimpering, his tail down, and his ears up.



“What’s wrong boy?” I asked the dog like it would give me an answer.



When all Jessie did was stare back at me with wide eyes for half a second, then immediately stare back at the basement, I thought there must have been an animal that got down there somehow. As I started to walk down, Jessie's whimpering turned into insistent crying, and barking. His feet started to move around like he was getting ready to jump into deep water, but didn’t have the courage to. When I got down there, I only saw the orange lamp illuminating the living room, and one of the basement windows was still open. Had I accidentally left it open while trying to get fresh air? Jessie’s barking was getting louder and more frequent now, occasionally I would hear him try and take the first step down stairs, only to retract his paw and cry like it had been stepped on. When I closed the window, I started searching for whatever critter had scampered down there to escape the cold autumn night. It was only 30 degrees out, and I couldn’t blame a raccoon for wanting out of that. Whatever had snuck down here, I was hoping to release back into the wild at the least. Maybe if it was friendly enough, I would let it stay.

  


 After a bit of searching, I looked under the chair and saw a small figure that wasn’t there before. I tried to use my phone’s flashlight to see it, but it still appeared to be covered in shadow, so I set my phone on the ground, next to me. Thinking this was the animal, I moved the chair off of it to see exactly what it was. But, even with the light of the lamp directly shining on it, I could barely tell what it was. I think it may have been a squirrel due to the long body and small size, but the completely hairless body made it hard to tell. It was charred like coal, stiff, and had curled up into a fetal position. It had no eyes, nails, tongue or lips. I knew it wasn’t there earlier that night because I had moved that chair that very same night earlier so I could get some bigger boxes out. Something brought this in. Something had burnt it.  Killt it. Deliberately hid it. And it got in my house. 

  


My heart was racing, a drumroll in my chest that stinged with each padded beat. My head was hot and the rest of my body was ice cold, as was my blood. Jessie’s barks seemed to get more frequent and louder now that I had uncovered this… desecration of a corpse. A sudden creek behind me echoed through the room, and Jessie went silent. I turned around myself in a frenzy, but only the lamp, the stairs, and the shadows in the room were there. I didn’t know what had left the squirrel in my basement, what it had done to it, but at the moment I didn’t care either. Faster than I ever did before, I ran upstairs, grabbed Jessie, and carried his  70 pound body to my room all in a matter of seconds. I threw Jessie onto my bedsheets, which were messy from a rough night’s sleep, and slammed the door shut behind me. I locked it swiftly, despite my hands shaking. I had to call the police, what else could I have done? I searched both of my pockets for my phone, but I only pulled out a quarter that had a cow skull and “Big Sky Country” engraved next to it on the tail's side. I scrambled around the room, checking each and every place I could have left it. Then it hit me; I had left it in the basement. It was down there, right next to the dead thing that stained my white carpet floor. It was down there with whoever, or whatever, had put the dead thing down there. 

  


I was too scared to leave my room, like when I was young and too afraid to go to the bathroom after I stayed up too late because the creature from my nightmares might get me. So, with nothing else to do, I shut all of my blinds, turned on the ceiling lights, and sat there in my bed. I never fell asleep, couldn’t even if I wanted to. Nearly the whole time me and Jessie stared at the door. He was growling, I sat there, unable to blink. I hadn’t turned on any lights outside of the one in my bedroom, so no indication of movements aside from sound, which was quiet. Not a cricket, or a late night passing car, nor anything else you might hear during the night’s ambience. By morning, light slid through the cracks of the closed curtains, and lights filled the rim of the doorway in front of me. I looked at the digital clock mounted on the side of my bed. In red, bold and bright it read ‘6:06 AM’. My eyes darted back to the door. Right at the bottom, were 2 shadows, barely a few inches apart. After staring at them for a few seconds, They both lifted, making the sounds of naked feet rising off of the wooden floor. They never came back down.

  


I opened the door gently, Jessie at my side. The door wide open, I stared. It was decently bright for 7, the sun and dimly lit blue sky seemingly crashing through the before haunting scenery. Not one unnatural light filled the scene before me save for the bedroom light. I walked around the house, cautiously, exploring each nook and cranny that a person could hide. I had thought of these places myself when bored, exploring where I would hide if some serial killer made a loud front door appearance. When I finished exploring the rest of my house, I went over and looked down the basement stairs. It gave me an uneasy feeling, like I wasn’t welcomed in my own home. Like the feeling you get when you wake up from a nightmare that felt too real. The lights were off. I didn’t do that. I knew someone was in, and very well could still be in my house. I wouldn’t risk going down there to grab my phone. I slowly walked back to my room, making sure to keep direct eye contact with the stairs the whole time.



“Jessie,” I called out towards my room. He decided to sit there the whole time instead of helping me search the house, which I wouldn’t blame him for, “You wanna go for a walk?” I turned around towards my room, facing the doorway which was where he now stood. His ears were perked but his tail wasn’t wagging, almost like he knew this was an escape attempt. It took me a moment to notice, but once I did, my heart just about stopped. Hand prints above my doorway. They were dirty, charcoal like. As an artist, I knew charcoal from dirt or any other black material. It had been smudged above the doorway on the wall and on the ceiling. I froze. I was almost unable to process what I was seeing. A bark from Jessie broke my trance, and I stared at him just as he stared at me, intently.



“Let’s go boy.” I said, and hastefully walked towards the front door. Jessie quickly followed, following me outside onto the front porch. It was still cold, the wind was still blowing, but less harshly now. I opened the back door of the car, and Jessie jumped in eager to leave. I looked back at the house one more time before leaving. My bedroom window curtains were now wide open. Charcoal prints stained the glass, pressed hard, as if trying to push through. I jumped into the front seat, started the car, and drove off.



I drove to Brandon's place, only around 40 minutes away. I told him everything that had happened, and he thought it was 'cool'. He always liked the paranormal, and he said he'd be "Ready to tackle it with me once I'm ready". He let me borrow his phone to call the police, and take care of some other things while I was at it. I decided to post this story to see if anyone has any knowledge on who, or what, could this have been. I'll try to update in the future, but for now, goodbye.
