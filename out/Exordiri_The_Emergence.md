**\[Tape begins recording – Jake’s story version 86\]**  


The spiral had begun again, everything was placed carefully this time, and the ***Tape Speaker*** was sure of it. The **presence** had been toying with them. Each time they believed that they had succeeded, they’d fall further into the nightmare. All the hope that once fuelled them was waning.

  
The tape is unwinding, unwound, and coating the area in useless non-potential. This space could become malleable on hope (the purest form) and only those who demonstrated this gift were able to transform the landscape. The area mimicked the landscape it shared its boundary with a m#u#t#i# -    
 

The road was deathly silent. The only sound was the splatter of snow, spreading its way across the windows. *Jake* couldn’t see more than a few meters ahead of him, the lights of the car just barely illuminating the path ahead. His only source of comfort was his stereo which had stopped working. He would admit that he didn’t need it but with the mini blizzard outside the car and the lack of company, Jake wished to hear anything even just the usual drivel of country songs that was polluting the stations at this hour.  
  
His mind wandered to his father. They hadn’t spoken in years, yet he was traveling a few hundred miles in hopes of repairing their fractured relationship, a short phone call that lasted no longer than 20 seconds. The message was clear:   
Come See Him.  


Jake could no longer recall what had happened to make him and his father disconnect but Jake was hopeful for the reunion. Jake never knew his mother she had left shortly after he was born and all he had was a tape she had made for him. His father had smashed the tape.  


A voice speaks, the words cold and distant, a different time. The darkness infests the space, coldness envelops them.  
*To bring upon #r#t#e#- - -*   


A couple of hours later, I’d arrive home, hopefully be able to stay the night not 100% on that one but I could crash somewhere. The bar – no no, I couldn’t fall into old habits, I promised Jean that I wouldn’t. Dad always had a habit of bringing my worst qualities out. So maybe a friends? – Again NO, what friends in this shitty small, inbred town. Okay it wasn’t technically inbred, but I haven’t heard anyone move there, if anything more people were leaving. Good, I think? My mind kept slipping; tiredness, hunger, and restlessness invaded my aching body.  I hoped there’d be a diner somewhere on this-.  
Suddenly a figure appeared in front of the car as if they had materialised from the very snow itself. Jake’s attempt to dodge the oncoming target was successful but the car had to hit some sort of target and the guard railing was the perfect striker. Metal met metal and Jake lost consciousness. This journey had ended suddenly…    


The body awoke; what was supposed to be buried in snow, a relic of a man who was on the verge of reuniting with his distant father now awakened on the floor of the underpass. This area defied the natural laws of the land, an underpass with numerous lights dotted on each wall as it ascended. Either entrance resulted in the same destination. This made sense in a city; everything looked the same in a concrete jungle. Who could fault you for getting confused? However, this was different as attempting to exit either side you’d face the mountain top.   


UGH is my first feeling/thought the second being why is sooo bright? I awoke to bright lights, the wind howling outside, and a pretty horrible headache. And to put how bad this headache was I honestly thought I had gone 3 rounds with Tyson. But wait where was I? I mean I should be in the car. Shit! The car! Where’s it? And how did I even end up here? My eyes were straining to focus as I felt the snow melt from my clothes. Had it been a dream? A fever? These questions didn’t matter as I took a minute to figure out where I was.   


I had managed to find myself in an underpass. How? I had no proof that I had been in a wreck besides my memory of it.   


Yes, I had hit the rail, and the car was going over the edge. Right? Then I blanked, my memories were becoming fuzzy now as if they were a word on the edge of my tongue. I feel weirdly incomplete would be my best description of it. I could only figure out that I was somewhere warm thankfully, and beside me was a cassette. A. Cassette. I pocketed it as no harm in taking what really was rubbish off the floor and I didn’t own a tape player and yet for the strangest reason it felt important to keep and if I couldn’t find a player for it, I could always drop it off with someone.  


Jake had hit the threshold, he’d soon realise that he had become marked, he became a player in the story directed by a person who would either be his saviour or downfall.  
The identity of the speaker was #\~#\~#\~\~#/.,  


Jake climbed out of the underpass and found himself in the town. He had made it but how? He had memories of the town and never once was there an underpass, he turned around to cement his belief and what was once a tunnel protecting him was nothing more than an empty road.

I finally made it back home hurray. The underpass was a figment in my mind, an itch that I felt compelled to keep scratching. I probably made it up or something, delusion to block out the memory, that was probable right? I mean who hasn’t done that? My clothes barely helped me fight the blizzard, though to give myself credit I was supposed to be driving home not walking for what must have been miles by now. Hyperbole to be fair but I was nearly there.   


I made it to the hotel, the lights of the sign had faded, a letter was blacked out. In the snow, I could barely see beyond lights, and getting pelted in the face by said snow. I had obviously lost my phone but even then, I felt like reality was gonna make my life even more unfair. I still had my wallet thankfully so I could hopefully purchase a room for the night. I stumbled through the door and chittering made my way to the reception. The hotel honestly hadn’t aged a day, I mean seriously the hotel had been preserved in some sci-fi time bubble.   


I had lived in this shithole after my eighteenth birthday which was probably better to forget.  


By now, the listener was aware of the intrusions in the tape, the voice was the same yet different. A different time? A different draft? Or maybe the entity had possessed the speaker. Jake's path was predetermined. Maybe, was it a guideline like what is going to happen, but the details aren’t definitive, Jake could alter the events ever so delicately.  


I approached the front desk and was greeted by an unfamiliar woman; Carmen was her name least that’s what her tag said, and she seemed in her late forties given the slightly grey hair and crow's feet. I attempted to speak when I got interrupted.  


“Mr. Davis, we’ve been missing our favourite guest”.  


Her tone was a matter of fact no warmth or feeling behind it. Jake wouldn’t notice this, truthfully Jake’s time in the town had made him oblivious to the weird and strange and he had met his fair share of strange folk as a teenager.  


“S-sorry? Carmen, is it? I don’t remember you sorry? Do we know each-other?”  


“It has been a couple of months since you last stayed with us, we appreciate your patronage”.  


“I’m sorry, there’s some mistake, I’ve not lived in this town for a decade at least. Do you mean my dad by any chance?”  


“Misremembering, are we? Have you been drinking lately, have you Jake? Sir?”  


I flashed red, anger to the purest degree and shame. I had started my spiral here drinking mainly which was a sore subject for me. Had I been that bad that I forget Carmen? She knew my name sure, but I had been sober for at least a few years at this point, I hadn’t stayed here since I was eighteen.  
I just kept quiet and moved to the elevator. This town had the habit of strange folk, I just wanted to sleep. Something felt off though, how, why did she know me? Did Dad do this as a present or something?   


The elevator chimed and stayed there as if hinting at the nightmare about meeting Jake; he pressed the button and waited as it ascended, as he was about to take the first steps to get out of the elevator he gasped at the sight before him as it was Euclidian abnature. What should have been his floor was the snowy mountain facing him, he had barely a second to react as the elevator pushed him out.  
I fell for what felt like days my brain stopped working and I braced myself for death for the second time. I landed somewhat gracefully in the snow. I was perplexed. How didn’t I die? My bones froze I was going to die in this snowhell. I grabbed at my pockets and found a light; I used it to try and navigate the blizzard surrounding me. There in the snow, a gun had somehow materialised from the blanket of cold, I reached for it and picked it up. Before I had a chance to even understand the action, I had taken - a figure made of snow appeared before me. It lacked features yet somehow underneath all the snow, I knew it was grinning at me. It chanted in a voice that lacked any human sounds, yet my mind somehow comprehended its message:  


“The mountain is alive”.
