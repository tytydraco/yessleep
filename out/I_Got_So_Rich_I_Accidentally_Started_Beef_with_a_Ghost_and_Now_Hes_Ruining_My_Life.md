You know, being disgustingly rich can get boring. You buy the cars, the yachts, the politicians—it all loses its charm. That’s when I got my idea: proving ghosts are real. I figured, if anyone was going to do it, why not me? So, I started buying up all the creepy, abandoned houses you see in horror movies. The ones where you think, Yeah, I’d never live there. Except I made it my mission to find people who would.

Here’s the trick: desperate people don’t ask questions. Rent a four-bedroom house for $50 a month? They’re practically tearing down the door to sign the lease. And here’s the genius part: none of them know they’re part of my experiment. They think they’ve just hit the jackpot. Meanwhile, I’ve wired every inch of those houses with hidden cameras, thermal sensors, EMF meters—basically every ghost-hunting gadget you see on TV, except mine actually work.

For months, nothing. Just tenants complaining about drafty windows and creaky floors. Yawn. And then I found The House.

It’s your classic horror setup: a Victorian with peeling wallpaper, a staircase that groans like it’s in pain, and a basement that smells like wet dirt and regret. I moved in my newest family—a sweet little couple with two kids and a third on the way. Perfect Guinea pigs. Things were normal for a few days. Then the reports started coming in.

“Weird stuff’s happening,” the dad said in an email. “Doors slamming, toys moving by themselves. My daughter says she saw a man in her closet, but there was no one there.”

Finally. A bite. I checked the cameras, expecting wind or a stray cat. Instead, I saw him.

Got it, let’s step it up. Here’s a revised version with better, more twisted pranks:

A shadowy figure, standing in the corner of their living room. At first, he didn’t do anything—just stood there like a creep. But then the pranks started. And this wasn’t your usual “boo, I’m a ghost” nonsense. This guy had a PhD in mind games. One night, he set every clock in the house to 3:33 a.m. The family woke up in a panic, thinking they’d overslept—except the sun hadn’t even risen.

Another time, he rearranged all their family photos, but with subtle changes: Mom’s eyes were closed in every picture. Dad looked slightly older. The kids were…missing. It was subtle enough that they second-guessed themselves—until their toddler asked, “Where did I go?”

Then came the pie prank. They’d left a fresh pie cooling on the counter. The next morning, it was still there—but sliced perfectly into eighths, with every single slice replaced by dirt. The pie tin was spotless.

But the crown jewel? He hacked their Alexa. Or, I mean, possessed it. At 2 a.m., the thing whispered, “Have you checked the basement?” in a voice none of them recognized. When they went to look, the basement lightbulb was unscrewed just enough to flicker. Sitting in the middle of the floor? A single fork. Not threatening, just…weird.

This ghost wasn’t just haunting them. He was breaking their brains. And I loved every second of it.

At first, watching the family unravel was chef’s kiss. But after a while, something shifted. They weren’t freaking out anymore. The pie incident? They just threw it away. The photo prank? “Must’ve been the kids,” they said. Even the Alexa whispering about the basement got a shrug. Turns out, when your rent is $50 a month, you’re willing to put up with a lot.

And that’s when the ghost got bored.

I noticed it when the cameras in the living room started glitching out. Static, weird angles, laughter. At first, I thought the tenants were messing with the setup. But when I checked the feed, there was me. My face. My bedroom. My ghost was flipping through my hidden camera network like it was cable TV. He even zoomed in on me sleeping, scrawling “BORED” in foggy letters on the lens.

Things escalated quickly after that.

One morning, I tried to withdraw some cash and found my entire bank account transferred to Boo Inc. The bank said it was “a legitimate business transaction” and wouldn’t reverse it. I had to cancel all my cards. The next day, my fridge was full of milk cartons with the label: Missing: Your Sanity. Clever.

Then, the pièce de résistance: my car. I went to the garage to find it covered in Post-Its. Thousands of them, each with a single word: “WHY.” Inside, the GPS was programmed to take me back to the haunted house.

That’s when I realized—I wasn’t just observing anymore. I was a player in the experiment now.

So, I did what any billionaire with a god complex would do: I fought back. I Googled “how to scare a ghost,” which, by the way, is a useless search term. I tried holy water, sage, even calling a priest, but the ghost just left mocking messages on my mirrors: “Nice try, Pope Junior.”

I had one last idea: if a ghost is giving me trouble, why not bring in something even worse? A demon. I scoured the internet for someone possessed. Found a guy in Jersey who swore he had a “long-term arrangement” with a demon named Valthor. Paid him $50,000 to show up and have a little chat with my prankster poltergeist.

When the demon guy arrived, he walked into the house and immediately froze. “Yeah, no,” he said. “Valthor doesn’t want any part of this.”

“What? Why not?”

The guy looked at me like I was crazy. “Because whatever’s in here… it’s laughing at him.”

I don’t know what’s worse: the fact that my ghost scared off a demon or the fact that I’m sitting here, plotting my next move, while the ghost left a sticky note on my desk that says, “Checkmate.”

I think I’ve created something I can’t control. But I can’t stop now. If I can get a ghost and a demon in the same room, I have to see what happens. For science. Or entertainment. Or because I’m an idiot. Probably all three.
