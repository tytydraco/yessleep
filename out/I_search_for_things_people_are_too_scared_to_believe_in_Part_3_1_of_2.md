“You and I have got a lot of work to do.” Echoed through my mind as I sat inside my new home. Cigarette in one hand, coffee in the other, just trying to get some semblance of normalcy. Even if it’s just for a day. After everything I witnessed and went through again, I needed a change. I sold my truck along with some other items and bought a decently sized van. I’ve been remodeling it for the last few months to make it a more viable and cheaper home. Especially if I wanted to continue my work.   
  
Speaking of work, I know I’ve been on a little bit of a hiatus and I’m sorry for that. I am alive though, so you can stop worrying. Ever since what went down in the town with Greg and Mark. I am still trying to wrap my head around it. The entity came into our world, fully came in… and I was the one that helped. But that’s not what bothers me the most. After he killed that creature, he reattached its head and put what looked like a seed in the mouth. It then looked at me and just vanished. What was the point of saying we have work to do if it was just going to leave? Ever since he crossed the threshold my night terrors have pretty much ceased. Very rarely do I have one and if I do it’s manageable. After shaking hands with it, I got a burn on my wrist in the shape of a hand. In my dreams, it's all black and the entity comes crawling out of it. But that's enough of that. Things are better and I wanted to share some things with you.  
I’ve been asked a couple of times to do so, and I thought now would be the best time to talk about previous cases. I’m on break in a national park that is just beautiful and have had ample time to sort through files. Moving kind of makes you go through your old things or find forgotten things. So, when I started rereading old cases I thought I should share them with you. A few are unsolved and some are still pending, but I thought talking about them would maybe shed some light. Hopefully, move towards solving one of them.   
  
The first case I have for you is “The Red Door.”   
Case Log: 04 Location: KS, Wichita.   
As I finished up an old case, I made my way through Wichita to see a couple of things there. I’m a sucker for sightseeing. After my first day there I was walking out of a coffee shop and saw a frantic man handing out fliers. He handed one to me and I kept walking thinking nothing of it. Finally, after coming to a crosswalk and having to wait, I examined it. There was a picture of a woman and a red door behind her. On the top of the page read. “Have you seen this woman?” and at the bottom it read “Have you seen this door in your dreams? If so, call…” Curiosity took over and I caught myself walking back towards the man. He seemed tired and disheveled. Like he hadn’t slept or cleaned himself for days. His clothes were wrinkled, and his hair was greasy. Noticing another passerby, he reached the fliers out to them, and they just swerved out of the way. Everyone acted as though he wasn’t there. He cried and fell to his knees then began talking to himself. No wonder no one took him seriously, I was probably the first to take the flier.   
I approached the man and squatted down beside him. “Here to call me crazy and shove me down some more?” He said, wiping away tears. “No, I’m here to ask you about your flier,” I replied, stretching out a hand to help pick him up. We sat down at a table and talked for over an hour about what all occurred. Apparently, he dream walked with his girlfriend to see this supposed red door. He said he was seeing it almost every night. The first couple of attempts didn’t work, but the fourth one did. When they finally saw it, she decided to go into it. Before he was able to follow, the door slammed, and he woke up in a pile of sweat. His girlfriend was nowhere to be seen. It was as though she vanished without a trace. He’s been looking for her ever since. Trying to see the door again but it’s been to no avail. Then nightmares began and he stopped sleeping. He wanted to dream walk with me, but I wasn’t able to help. Dream walking is a dangerous thing and I’ve been told too many times about the power of dreams. I gave him the information for Josh, a specialist I knew, and went on my way.   


A couple weeks later Josh called to talk to me about the case. He said he and the man began their dream walking session and came across the door. Josh knew what it was instantly. The man had lied and said he needed to find his inner spirit in order to trick Josh into doing it. The Red Door has been a dream phenomenon for a while, and it's always been said to avoid it. Josh tried to stop the man but he busted through the door and was gone. When Josh awoke the man was gone and he hasn’t been seen or heard from since.   
Case Log 04: The Red Door. Unsolved   
  
The next case was one that I received a lot of questions about. The wendigo, or at least that’s what I think it was.   
Case log 07: Clean Bones. Location: Black Hills, SD.  
I had no intention of stopping in Spearfish, SD. But when you need gas, you need gas. While filling my tank I noticed a flier up on a pole by the pump. Inspecting it, I noticed it was for a girl who had gone missing while camping. Underneath hers was another one for a guy who’d gone missing in the same conditions. I put two and two together and figured they must have been camping together. I took one of the number slips and gave it a call, setting up a time to speak with the parents.    
  
AUDIO TRANSCRIPT CASE LOG: 07: LOCATION: SD  
M. “You don’t mind that I record?”  
P: “Not at all, as long as it helps find our daughter and her friend.”  
M. “So what is it that you can tell me about the location they went to?”   
P: “As far as I know and what she told me, they were going to Iron Creek Trail. It’s a few miles past Bridal Veil Falls. You should see the bridge and a pull-off section. That’s one of the trails she frequented most. It is unmarked though, but she usually camped out just a few miles in. I’m scared though because this isn’t the first person to go missing around here. There have been three others. They had just found the shin bone of the first person missing a few days ago. Saying it was a wild animal or something. The thing is… the bone was completely clean. As though something was nibbling on it for days.”   
M: “Just the bone? And… you said it was completely clean?”   
P: “Clean except for a little chunk of flesh in a groove. Just enough to identify the person.”   
J: “Man was a convict, so he won't be missed.”   
P: “Joseph, that is a terrible thing to say. A life is a life no matter the sin. Sorry for his intrusion, but some people are saying it might be something… supernatural. Like a-”  
J: “Don’t go spouting off that horse shit. There’s nothing supernatural about it. I think the mans got enough information now. Go find our daughter and don’t come back til you do.”   
M: “Thank you for your time. I appreciate your info and I’ll be in touch.”

Five people missing from areas all around the Black Hills is going to be hard to pinpoint. At least I have an ok amount of information to go off of to find the fourth and fifth missing. First missing, deceased most likely with a whole leg bone showing up. That or some forged records happened. I went around the surrounding towns first to find info on the second and third missing. Couldn’t find anything on the second but the third was interesting. The sister of the second didn’t want an interview. She just told me her brother went missing around Barnes Canyon.   
  
On my second day investigating the third missing person was found in the middle of Cold Brook Canyon. At least, the rest of him was. Spanning in a quarter-mile radius was multiple bones picked clean and his head, right on the trail. As if someone wanted it to be found. I tried interviewing one of the rangers who were on the scene. They declined and told me to leave it to them. Of course, I’m not going to. But some more information would help. This leads me to the biggest worry I have. Either, the second body has yet to be found and has already been consumed. Or it’s the next dinner before the daughter and her friend. So, no more talking to people. Time to get my hiking boots on and have a little walk.   
  
While searching around the trail a sudden fear came over me. The fear of walking into the unknown and having no idea what you’re getting yourself into. Surprising right? Coming from a person who just started looking into the unknown. But this is a feeling that I’ll have to get used to.   
  
About three-quarters of a mile in I thought I saw someone standing behind a tree way off in the distance. The thing was, they didn’t have any distinguishing features. They looked like they were in a black morph suit. But it was getting dark and there was quite a bit of trees. So, against all better judgment, I began to make my way to them. A couple steps in I noticed a jacket on the ground. It was a little beat up and had some blood on it. Kneeling down to inspect it some more, I heard a voice call out to me. Turning around I noticed it was one of the rangers I tried talking to at the last crime scene.

C: “What are you doing out here?”  
M: “Oh… you know, just going for a little hike.”   
C: “Really? You just happen to be going for a little hike where two people went missing. One of them whose parents you talked to.”  
M: “I-”   
C: “I told you to stop investigating and leave it to us. But you gave me a feeling that you weren’t going to listen. So, I followed you, and well, it looks like I was right.”   
Silence goes over the recording as we are both standing there. Tension in the air rose and then died as soon as I slightly moved my arm and pointed to the jacket.   
C: “What’s that?”   
M: “The girls' jacket. Looks like your department did need my help.”   
C: \*Grunts\*” Whatever you say. We would’ve found it once we set the dogs loose.”   
M: “And when was that supposed to…” I cut myself off as I noticed a broken bloody branch about four feet away. The crunching of the leaves came through until I stopped and knelt down. “They went this way.”   
C: “How do you know?”   
M: “I used to do quite a bit of tracking when I hunted. Then it got a little better once I began looking into the things I was investigating. You’d be surprised how many people go missing… and what's really out there.”   
C: “You really believe in that nonsense? Cryptids, aliens, Nessie, and all that?”   
M: “Some of it, yes. Sometimes it's nothing but a psychopath or a cult. But other times there’s no other explanation.”   
U: “HELP, SOMEONE PLEASE. HELP!” The voice sounded different. It was too off, and it was even more apparent in the recording.   
C: “It came from this way. Move now!”   
M: “Wait! Stop, hold on just a second.” I grabbed his arm to make him stop.  
U: “HELP, SOMEONE PLEASE. HELP!”   
M: “What the fuck are you doing, they need our help.”   
P: “That sounded the exact same as the first time. Can’t you tell? It sounds off too. Just listen.”   
Silence filled the recording for about thirty seconds until it was broken.   
U: “HELP, SOMEONE PLEASE. HELP!”   
M: “See. It sounds the exact same. It's also coming from the south. The tracks are heading east. Something doesn’t want us going this way.”   
P: “I don’t believe you, you’re crazy, someone is out there and needs our help.”   
M: “Ok, listen, if they are that way the tracks will begin to head that way. So, let’s just keep following them until we come across something. Ok?”   
P: “Fuck. Fine, you better know what you’re doing cryptid hunter.”

I noted down that nickname in my mind in case I ever wanted to make business cards. Also, to have something to look forward to if I survive the upcoming interaction. After about fifteen more minutes of walking, we stumbled upon an alcove. Towards the end, an entrance to a cave could be barely seen. It was just about nightfall now, and the forest was getting a lot darker. Mark and I both looked at each other saying “You go first.” with our eyes. Finally getting enough courage I pulled a flare out of my bag and struck it. A bright incandescent red flooded over and illuminated the area around us before dying down a bit. “You do know I have a flashlight, right?” Mark said with a snarky tone. “I know, but this fills the whole area, not just a small beam. Also red is a lot less hard on the eyes than white light.” I replied entering the mouth of the cave. “Fair point.” He replied following behind.   
  
Walking through the cave felt as though we were walking through a portal to hell. The deep red light mixed with the small refractions in the cave wall felt almost otherworldly. As if we were traversing a place we weren’t supposed to be. After a few more minutes the smell of rot hit my nose like a freight train, almost making me gag. “What the fuck is that?” Mark said while gagging into his hand. “I don’t know, but it means we’re getting closer. I replied, dropping the flair and striking a new one. “I don’t think we should be here. This feels like an animal den. What if it comes ba-” Mark and I both stopped and stared in silence. On the ground, a few feet in front of us was a pile of dead bodies. Deer, coyotes, rabbits, and a mountain lion were all lying there slowly decaying. “Safe to say it’s not coming back, but… I’m more worried about whatever did this.” I said slowly walking around the pile. Mark just gagged and stayed silent until we hit a partially lit opening.   
  
The opening was massive, and a few dimly lit candles were strewn about. It was a much larger area than I had thought. We were only able to see a few feet in, and a couple of other spots, as the flare was dying down and the candles were afar. Dropping the flair and getting ready to strike a new one, Mark stomped it out and pushed me into a crack in the wall. Unable to say anything because of his hand over my mouth he quietly said “Shut the fuck up. I heard something.” With that the noise of claws scraping on rocks passed by. Standing there in the dark not knowing what to do, I heard a girl crying in the opening. It was unintelligible, just a lot of sobbing and half words.   
The sounds of something heavily breathing was coming through the opening now. Then came the sounds of what I could only guess were tendons and muscles being ripped. After that was done, we could hear what sounded like someone eating a pie with no hands and an open mouth. Except, this was not some normal pie. It was guttural sitting there listening to the chomping and chewing. Then a final snap and sucking sound ended the symphony of grotesque noises. The girl was crying louder now, asking and begging “Why.” Through sobs. Suddenly there was a scream followed by cracks and groans, and then a man spoke.

G: “Why are you doing this?”   
U: “Why? Simple. Hunger. Sleeping. Long… sleep. Need food.”  
G: “Where’s John? What did you do to my boyfriend?”  
\*A dragging noise followed by a loud wet thump, then the girl began screaming\*  
M: “That’s it, I can’t wait anymore. Hey! Over here motherfucker!”   
P: “No. Stop. God dammit.”

The man? Creature? turned around to see Mark and I at the entrance of the opening. He was barely visible, but you could tell it was scantily clothed and covered in blood. Striking a flair, the area lit up and the thing could be fully seen. Its face was bloody, and its jaw was slacked open with a piece of meat hanging out. The thing hissed at the flame and crouched down, almost in a lunging position. Mark began to move to the right, and I followed suit. Illuminating more of the area, we could see bones and torn clothes strewn about leading up to the girl. In front of her feet was the dead mutilated body of the boy she went with. At least what was left of him. “It’s going to be ok. We’re gonna get you out of here.” Mark said, crouching down by the girl. Her head was between her knees as she was sobbing inconsolably.   
  
The thing was too close for comfort, slowly crawling on all fours back and forth. Almost as though trying to figure out the best method of attack. It was growling and hissing, mainly keeping its eyes on the flair. “Mark, I could really use some help.” I said, trying to figure out a solution to this problem. I was ignored though, as he was still trying to calm the girl. The flares light was dimming, and the thing was becoming more confident now. Inching closer as the flame began shrinking. Putting two and two together I threw the flare at it right and grabbed another to strike. Surprisingly my throw was a lot more accurate than anticipated, hitting it in the face. What came next was the most horrific and guttural scream I have ever heard. It sounded as though a thousand mountain lions were screaming their last scream before death. I really pissed it off now.   
  
It lunged towards me no longer caring about the flare in my hand. Rage was the only thing fueling it now. Doing the only thing I could think of, I dove towards its feet as it lunged. My timing was not as precise as I thought and the feeling of razors cutting me shot across my back. Still rolling from my dive I noticed it slide and hit the side of the cave wall releasing another loud shriek. Then loud bangs began echoing as I noticed Mark unloading his handgun into the creature. It was distracted now, and I had to come up with a plan quickly. The flare was a few feet away and in its ever-dimming red light, I noticed a bottle of lighter fluid. It must've come from my backpack that had been ripped open from the thing's nails.  
  
Thinking quickly, I began fast crawling towards the bottle snatching it up before my attention was drawn away. Looking up I saw Mark backed away in an opening of the cave wall. The creature was hacking and slashing away at the wall trying to make its way closer to him. Letting out hellish screams and flinging rock debris all over. Gaining control of myself again, I quickly got up and ran towards the creature opening the bottle of lighter fluid. Gripping it as hard as I could, I began spraying the liquid in an X formation as though I were swinging a katana.   
  
The creature seemed to have taken notice of me the second I was done spraying it. The thing lunged at me, slashing its claws towards my torso as I fell back. I landed in something lukewarm and sticky. Confused as to what it was, I had to focus on the task at hand. The creature hovering over me. It was just watching me, cocking its head from side to side. As though it was meticulously figuring out the best way to dismember and eat me. Trying to crabwalk away I figured out what it was that I tripped on. It was the body of the girl's boyfriend, lying there lifeless, and as pale as a ghost. Even in the dimly lit area, I could see the fear that was frozen on his face.   
  
The creature was still standing there watching me breathing heavily in and out… in and out. Then, it finally took a step towards me as its jaw slacked open and drool began to pool out. I felt my hand touch something as the creature was going down on all fours. Grabbing it I heard Mark begin to scream and charge the creature with a pocketknife. An ill attempt though as the creature backhanded him, swatting him away like a fly. As much of a failure that was, it gave me enough time to figure out what was in my hand. It was one of my flares and an unlit one at that. Nervously I untwisted the cap and prepared myself mentally for what's to come. Striking it caused the monstrous head to snap towards me, sounding like a cacophony of bones cracking. It flung itself towards me as I threw the flair at it. Making it, and the flare connect midair.   
  
Time seemed to have slowed down as the creature's body ignited into a fiery inferno almost hitting me. The smell of death burned flesh and hair filled the air as the creature began frantically flinging itself around in hopes of putting out the fire. It was a futile attempt, the damage was already done. The thing fell to its knees letting out one final hellish screech before slumping to the ground. Lying there lifeless, slowly burning away until it will become nothing but ash and bones.   
  
Not much more can be said about the whole affair. I don’t want to bore you with a bunch more notes about what was in the cave. Mark, the girl, and I got out with minor injuries. I had a few slashes on my back and one on my chest. Mark had a dislocated shoulder and a minor concussion. Then the girl had only a couple of minor scratches and bruises. Multiple bodies and bones were found at the site but no more of the information was disclosed to me. Mark and I still keep in touch from time to time. He retired from being a ranger and the girl just got married this year, both Mark and I were invited. It was a beautiful ceremony and the whole affair of how we met was never brought up.
