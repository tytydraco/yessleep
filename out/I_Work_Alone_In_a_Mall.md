The first thing everyone needs to know is that my therapist is the only reason I'm doing this. Having a diagnosis for clinical depression means you get a therapist. Wasn't like I could afford it, I'd just gotten laid off. So when I found a job listing on LinkedIn for a night guard position at a mall, I took it. Totally not like I was forced to, *thanks Dr. Carter.* I needed a reason to get out of bed every day anyway, and I was a night owl as well. 

I got hired without an interview, which told me that they were desperate, and pulled up at around noon. Strangely, there was no one in the parking lot. It was fairly out in the sticks too, twenty or so miles out of the city. Nothing else was around. No buildings, just trees, and a road. What was even stranger was the guy who was to be my boss. An old man he was, heavy bags under his eyes, which were bug like and dark, his shoulders were slumped down, like he had held the weight of the world, and crumbled. 

He was holding a belt and clear plastic bag with a uniform. Looked to be around my size, like a Paul Blart lite. His voice was also strange, like a stone dragging against steel. "Hey there, you Anderson?" His eyes bored into mine as he asked the question, like he was trying to stare right into my soul, it felt like he was succeeding. 

"Yeah, you Brandon?" He nodded in response and grunted as he turned toward the towering building. Now that I was really looking at the mall itself, it looked strange, like a mix of different architectural styles. I recognized a few of them. Gothic, a few Athenian pillars were arranged out front. The fourth floor was a weird Roman style. There was a kind of Persian dome on the top. I assumed from the look of it it was made of stained glass.

Brandon groped for a ring of keys on his belt, arthritic fingers bulging slightly, and unlocked the front door. Why was the main door of a mall locked at noon on a Tuesday? "So, are there any other guards?" Brandon peered over his ice slope of a shoulder, his eyes fixed on mine as he answered bluntly.

"No." That was... somehow not as strange as I thought it would be. "Why not?" He pushed the door open and held it for me, before bustling ahead like a stickbug. "Only need one." I didn't mind the short answers, I wasn't in the mood to talk much anyway. I kept masking. Something Dr. Carter told me to stop doing. The guard office was on the second floor, it was a small room. There was a mini fridge, coffee brewer, a leather sofa, desk with many monitors on it, complete with a chair that swivels, and a sun bleached poster of a cat that said *"hang in there!"*

Brandon tossed the uniform at me, along with a belt and key ring. "Stay here till I get back, until then, do not turn on the monitors. Just change into the uniform." I raised my eyebrow at him and he shrugged me off, walking out of he office. After checking the room for cameras all around the room, to the point of sticking my fingers in the slits of the vent in the room. I changed as quickly as possible. I still felt like something was right behind me, watching me. The uniform didn't have a radio, and there wasn't any kind of pepper spray, but there was a small cross embroidered on the inside of the collar. I pulled my wallet, phone, and small baggie of pills from my pockets.

Downside of it not being socially acceptable to have a purse, and too lazy to deal with a bag anyway, I usually kept my antidepressants in a baggie. Felt a bit rebellious to keep it in a way that felt nefarious. One of the few things that wasn't drowned in the sea of depression. 

Right as I popped a pill, Brandon came back in, carrying another key ring. He stared as the bag disappeared into my pocket. "Those illicit?" His voice sounded both apprehensive and slightly hopeful. "Nope, antidepressants." He grunted again before tossing me the key ring he had. I looked down at it, there were tags attached to the keys, *B4*, *B5*, *B6*, all the way till *B9*. and a couple that said *maintenance, bathrooms,* and *emergency.* The emergency tag was bright red with yellow lettering. 

"The key ring I just gave you has keys to the elevators, employee bathrooms, and the five maintenance rooms across the buildings, all the maintenance rooms have breaker boxes that control the section's lights and appliances. As well as valves to the fire sprinkler system and the ventilation system. All the systems are closed off in case of failure. The emergency key goes into a lock at the end of the hallway on the ninth subfloor. Only use it for *emergencies,* life or death situations. The key ring I gave you at the entrance to the building has keys to all the other doors around the building."

He showed me around the building, the three food courts, departments, empty slots that were filled with couches and tables, where the vending machine with the best snacks is, all with the exception of the subfloors. Gave him the heeby Jeebies, he said. Strange coming from such a gruff man.

When we were walking through the last food court, there was a sudden screeching coming from the sandwich place, it was sharp and piercing, like the wail of a woman pitched upward until it was a continuous needle in my ears. There were crashes and additional screams coming from the kitchen behind it. When it stopped, I realized that Brandon was walking toward me from the little place. There was peanut butter on his sleeve.

On our way out he showed me one of the maintenance rooms. "Remember, in case something happens, or something fails, you'll have four other sectors where there's power and running water. Sometimes things make their way into the air vents, and you'll have to clear them. So you'll just hit these two buttons here and twist this knob..." 

He showed me how to clear the vents, when he did it, there was a thunderous thumping coming from the inside, which slowly got quieter. He also showed me how to read the gauges to tell how close the breakers were from failing. 

"There are some things you'll want to see, so keep the lights on, but there are also things you might not wanna see, in that case, turn as many light off as you can, in the event the breakers in the section you're in flip, and the lights go out, be careful. The things you don't wanna see won't get at ya, but the things you'd wanna see. Those can and will."

I did *not* like that warning. He was an old man, so it was possible that he was just being senile. But the fact that he appeared completely serious and present in the moment... unnerved me. 

On the way to the elevator that went to the subfloors, there was a faint pattering. All of a sudden Brandon covered my eyes with his swollen fingers, reaching for a nearby switch that plunged us into absolute darkness.

"What the he-!" I started out before it was bit off by Brandon clamping his hand tighter over my mouth, his raspy voice found it's whispered way to my ear, "Don't move, don't acknowledge." The moment the words left his lips, I felt *something* behind me. I could hear the meaty slap of bare flesh against the smooth concrete. I felt warm breath on my neck, but as i made to turn, I felt Brandon grip my arms tight.

Relenting, I stayed in place for what felt like an agonizingly long time, when we heard the scuttling fade away, the lights snapped back on, blinding me. "When you hear something like that running at you, you turn off the light if you can, if you can't, cover your eyes, curl up, and don't move. Understand?" I reluctantly nodded, letting the questions and accusations die in my dry throat.

We walked from the hallway to the front doors. The elevator forgotten. "See you Thursday, right? That's when my first shift is?" He stared at me, "Yep, it'll be a kind of evaluation, When your shift is over, I'll come to check it out, and if you pass. You'll start seeing more shifts. Lucky for you, since you're the only other employee, you'll be getting around fifty an hour. and with seven P.M to four A.M shifts every day of the work week, you'll be raking in the money."

He smiled at me, showing tea stained teeth, if I didn't know him any better I'd say he was a Brit. As I was leaving he called out, when I turned he adopted the air of a grave man. Somehow more grave than he was in the maintenance room. "And boy? When you get here Thursday, check the underside of the desk. There'll be something there that'll be useful for you." With that, I hopped into my car and planned to get up early tomorrow, even though I knew that I'd only end up getting out of bed at noon. Contemplating everything that happened today. *Damn it,* I thought as I drove away, *Dr. Carter isn't gonna like this.*
