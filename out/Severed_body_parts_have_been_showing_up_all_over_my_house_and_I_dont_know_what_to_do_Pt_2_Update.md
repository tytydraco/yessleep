I’m afraid this won’t be a very lengthy update, as I am tired and worried and somehow relieved? Unfortunately, since I’ve posted, nothing has gotten better. Actually, if you believe it.. things have gotten worse. If you never read my first post, none of this will make sense to you. I hate repeating myself but my life has turned into a recurring nightmare so what does it matter? The body parts are still coming. They won’t stop. I guess I left my story on quite a cliffhanger. Or whatever you wanna call it. This whole experience has been one ginormous cliffhanger so why not join the ride? I never know what’s going to happen next. I walk around my own home petrified of the next severed body part I will come across. 

Remember how I said it's gotten worse? Well, my storage unit.. I'm not sure how to even say this but, it's disappeared. The place I’ve been stashing the mystery body parts is GONE. Poof. Vanished. Yeah, trust me I know what you’re thinking. How can an entire storage unit just up and leave? Especially one with such content. For the person who left a comment on my post and recommended I get a freezer, thank you but I am fortunate to say I am one step ahead of you. Well, I guess I was. Trust me when I say I've gone over a million different ways to rid myself of these things. Throwing them off a high cliff into treacherous waters was my first thought and to be honest, I still like the idea. Or I did. That was probably where this train was heading. Loading up my beat-up car to take a semi-long drive to dumb them. My only real issues were 

1.) the possibility of being pulled over. How entirely f*cked would I be? At this point, it’s almost humorous. “Oh, nothing here officers, just extremely body-shaped bags are in my trunk and back seat while I drive over state borders. just your normal road trip, eh?” Or 
2.) Exactly how many trips would it take to drive 52.. ok now 56 body parts to a cliff. And then 
3.) Being seen unloading said body parts and dumping them into the ocean. It’s not like I’m a very lean and strong man. 

Sure I’m 6 feet tall but honestly that’s the only thing interesting about my stature. I am a skinny man. I’m not going to sugarcoat my inability to carry BODY PARTS. What has my life come to? I can’t believe I’m even typing this out right now. But see, maybe my problem has disappeared altogether. Let me tell you just what happened.

A few days out from my post I sat biting my nails waiting for just somebody to tell me what to do. I appreciate the camera recommendation but respectfully I don’t think you understand. I’ve set up cameras and every time they glitch out or just refuse to work at all. The only times I’ve gotten them to work I’ll find the.. I’m not sure exactly how to even say this. But I’d find it out of sight. Cameras can only reach so many places. They fail to reach unimaginable places. Places you wouldn’t even think of. Under my bed, the toilet, microwave, and the shower are just a few off the top of my head. I can’t afford to put a camera in every little place. I’m not sure anyone would. 

Anyway, after a lot of thinking, I thought I’d go to my storage unit and just really assess my situation. Try and see if there was a solution I'm just not thinking of. I only go there after dark. Once I’ve plastic wrapped the body parts and have them packed into whatever I use to carry them in. Sometimes it's big bins or sometimes it's in a roller suitcase. Stuff that I can easily carry. So I made the short drive to my storage unit. When I got there everything seemed normal. I put the code into the front gate, drove around to the place I’ve been coming to for almost this entire shit show, but my storage unit wasn’t there. 

I wasn’t crazy. I double, triple, quadruple f*cking checked. The numbers went 103,104,106,107…. And I'll give you a lucky guess at which one was mine. “Was” being the keyword. I went back and forth down the line thinking maybe I had accidentally made a mistake. I took my key and tried unlocking every door on the row, but NOTHING! I stood there for a long while wondering if maybe this was some miracle. That God had seen my struggles and heard my prayers. But I'm smarter than that. 56 body parts don’t just up and walk away. 

An entire storage unit doesn’t just up and walk away. I remember driving home in silence through the dark, back home. I slowly walked into my house expecting some kind of body part shrine in the corner of my living room. Let me just tell you with a full f*cking smile on my face that NO BODY PARTS were hidden anywhere. What a sentence but what a miracle. And it’s been like that for a full two days now. You’re probably thinking “Mr whatever your name is, wtf do you mean? You said that it’s gotten worse.” And to that I say I am terrified. 

Why on earth would I celebrate when everything has been so bad? All of my optimism is fake, my dear friends. There’s no possible way this is the end. But I will bask in this two-day streak of not having to deal with severed body parts. For now, I will swim in this beautiful ocean of freedom. Someone please tell me what to do.
