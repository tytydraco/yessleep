I never thought I'd be that person posting on Reddit about ghost stories or paranormal experiences. Hell, I used to roll my eyes at those posts. But here I am, hands shaking as I type this, desperately hoping someone out there can help me make sense of what's happening.

My name's Sarah. I'm 32, work as a graphic designer, and up until a year ago, I was happily married to the love of my life, Tom. We met in college - he spilled his entire tray of food on me in the cafeteria, and somehow that led to a first date. Eight years later, we were saying "I do" under an old oak tree in his parents' backyard.

Life was good, you know? We had our little house in the suburbs, our grumpy cat Mr. Whiskers, and plans to start trying for a baby. Then, last June, everything went to hell.

It was a Tuesday. I remember because we were supposed to have tacos for dinner - it was our little weekly tradition. Tom called around 5:30, saying he'd be home late. Some big project at work needed finishing. I was annoyed, I'll admit it. We'd been like ships passing in the night lately, both of us working too much.

"Don't wait up," he said. "I'll make it up to you this weekend, promise."

Those were the last words I ever heard him say.

At 11:42 PM (funny how your brain holds onto details like that), there was a knock at the door. Two police officers stood on our porch, their faces grim. Before they even opened their mouths, I knew. You always think you'll scream or faint when you get news like that. I just felt... numb.

Drunk driver. Head-on collision. Dead on impact.

The next few weeks passed in a blur of funeral arrangements, well-meaning casseroles from neighbors, and sleepless nights staring at Tom's side of the bed. I kept expecting to wake up and find out it was all a horrible dream.

But it wasn't. Tom was gone, and I was left trying to figure out how to live in a world without him.

For a year, I went through the motions. I went back to work. I fed Mr. Whiskers. I even started seeing a grief counselor. Slowly, painfully, I was learning how to be Sarah-without-Tom.

Then came the day that changed everything. Again.

It was the one-year anniversary of Tom's death. June 15th. I decided to visit his grave, like I'd been doing every month since the funeral. It was a beautiful summer day, warm but not too hot. The kind of day Tom would have loved.

I brought sunflowers - his favorite. As I approached his grave, I rehearsed in my head what I was going to say. It sounds silly, but I always felt like I was really talking to him when I visited.

But when I got to the grave, the words died in my throat. I blinked, sure I must be seeing things. I rubbed my eyes, but the image didn't change.

There, on Tom's tombstone, right below his name, was mine.

"Sarah Thompson, 1991 - "

The date of death was blank, but my name was there, clear as day. Carved into the stone as if it had always been there.

I dropped the flowers, my hands shaking. "What the hell?" I whispered, reaching out to touch the stone. It was real. The carving was there, under my fingertips.

I looked around wildly, half expecting to see someone jump out and yell "Gotcha!" But the cemetery was empty, silent except for the rustling of leaves in the wind.

I fumbled for my phone, nearly dropping it as I pulled it out of my pocket. With trembling fingers, I snapped a picture of the tombstone. Then another. And another.

"This can't be real," I muttered to myself. "This can't be happening."

But it was. And little did I know, it was only the beginning.

Writing this has brought it all back, and I need a minute to collect myself. But there's so much more to tell. God, I hope someone out there can help me make sense of this.

After I found my name on Tom's tombstone, I kind of lost it. I mean, wouldn't you? I remember sitting on the ground next to his grave, my brain trying to make sense of what I was seeing. I must have been there for hours, because when I finally snapped out of it, the sun was setting and my ass was numb from the cold ground.

I stumbled home in a daze, nearly getting into an accident when I ran a red light. As soon as I got in, I called Lisa, my best friend since high school.

"Sarah? What's wrong?" she asked as soon as she picked up. I guess my voice gave me away.

"Lisa, I... I need you to come over. Please. Something's happened."

She was at my door in fifteen minutes, still wearing her scrubs from the hospital. I showed her the pictures on my phone, my hands shaking so bad I nearly dropped it.

"Oh my God," she whispered, her eyes wide. "Sarah, this... this isn't possible."

"I know," I said, my voice cracking. "But it's there, Lisa. I touched it. It's real."

Lisa insisted on going to the cemetery with me the next day. When we arrived, my heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest. But as we approached Tom's grave, I saw Lisa's face pale.

"Sarah," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Your name... it's really there."

Hearing Lisa confirm it made it real in a way that even seeing it myself hadn't. This wasn't just in my head. It was actually happening.

We spent the next few hours calling everyone we could think of. The cemetery office (closed for the day), the company that made Tom's headstone (also closed), even the police (who basically told us that unless someone was actively trying to kill me, there wasn't much they could do).

Lisa offered to stay the night, but I told her I'd be okay. Big mistake.

As soon as she left, the apartment felt... different. Colder, somehow. Like all the warmth had been sucked out of it. I tried to distract myself by watching TV, but I couldn't focus. Every little noise made me jump.

Around midnight, I finally decided to try and get some sleep. I was exhausted, both physically and emotionally. But as I was brushing my teeth, I heard something that made my blood run cold.

Footsteps. Coming from the living room.

I froze, toothbrush halfway to my mouth. It couldn't be Mr. Whiskers - he was curled up on my bed. And I lived alone.

The footsteps got closer. Slow, heavy steps. Like someone was taking their time, knowing I had nowhere to run.

My heart was pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears. I looked around frantically for something, anything I could use as a weapon. I grabbed my hairdryer - not ideal, but better than nothing.

The footsteps stopped right outside the bathroom door. I held my breath, gripping the hairdryer so tight my knuckles turned white.

Then, I heard it. A voice. Soft, familiar, impossible.

"Sarah?"

It was Tom's voice.

I dropped the hairdryer, the crash echoing in the tiny bathroom. This couldn't be happening. Tom was dead. I'd watched them lower his coffin into the ground.

"Sarah, honey, are you okay?"

The door handle started to turn. I backed up until I hit the wall, a scream building in my throat.

The door swung open.

There was nobody there.

I stood there, shaking, for what felt like hours. Eventually, I managed to peek out into the hallway. Empty. The whole apartment was empty.

I didn't sleep that night. How could I? I sat on my bed, lights on, jumping at every little sound. When the sun finally came up, I felt like I'd aged ten years.

I called in sick to work and went straight to the cemetery. I had to see the tombstone again. Had to know if I'd imagined the whole thing.

But when I got there, my heart nearly stopped.

The tombstone was gone.

In its place was a freshly dug hole. An open grave.

I stumbled backward, my foot catching on something. I looked down and saw a shovel. A dirty, used shovel.

And there, stuck to the handle, was a note. In handwriting I knew better than my own.

"I'm coming home, Sarah. Wait for me."

I ran. I ran faster than I've ever run in my life. I didn't stop until I reached my car, fumbling with the keys, constantly looking over my shoulder.

As I drove away, I caught a glimpse of something in my rearview mirror. A figure, standing by Tom's empty grave. A figure with messy brown hair and familiar green eyes.

My hands shook as I called Lisa. "I need to stay with you," I blurted out as soon as she answered. "And I need to grab Mr. Whiskers from my apartment."

"Of course," Lisa said, concern evident in her voice. "Do you want me to come with you?"

I hesitated, then agreed. Having Lisa with me made me feel a little safer as I quickly packed a bag and coaxed a very unhappy Mr. Whiskers into his carrier.

The whole time, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching me from the shadows of my own home.

Now I'm at Lisa's place. I couldn't go back to my apartment. I didn't know what to do. I thought I was going crazy. But at least I had Mr. Whiskers curled up next to me, his familiar purring a small comfort in the midst of this nightmare.

Lisa suggested I try to get some sleep, but how could I? Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Tom's face - not as I remembered him, but as that ghastly figure by the grave.

"We'll figure this out," Lisa assured me, but I could see the worry in her eyes. She didn't understand what was happening any more than I did.

As I sat there, absently stroking Mr. Whiskers, I couldn't help but wonder: What was coming for me? And how long did I have before it arrived?

And the worst part? A small, terrible part of me wanted it to be real. Wanted Tom to really come back. Even if... even if he's not the same Tom I knew.

God, what was happening to me?

After I fled to Lisa's place, things got worse. So much worse.

That first night at Lisa's, I woke up screaming. In my dream, I was back in the cemetery. Tom was there, standing by his open grave. But he wasn't the Tom I remembered. His skin was pale, almost gray. His eyes... God, his eyes were empty. Black holes in his face.

He reached out to me, his fingers elongated and twisted like tree roots. "Sarah," he said, his voice a raspy whisper. "Why did you leave me?"

I jolted awake, drenched in sweat. Lisa came running in, worry etched on her face.

"Sarah? What's wrong?"

I opened my mouth to answer, but then I saw it. There, on Lisa's bedroom wall. Words, dripping down the wallpaper like fresh blood:

"I'M WAITING FOR YOU, SARAH."

I screamed. Lisa flicked on the lights, but as soon as they came on, the words vanished. Gone like they'd never been there.

Lisa thought I was losing it. Hell, I thought I was losing it. But I knew what I saw.

The next day, things got even stranger. We went to the police station to file a report about the missing tombstone. The officer looked at us like we were crazy.

"Ma'am," he said, tapping away at his computer, "according to our records, there's no Thomas Thompson buried at Oakwood Cemetery."

My jaw dropped. "What? No, that's impossible. I was just there! I've been visiting his grave for a year!"

The officer shrugged. "I'm sorry, but there's no record of it. Are you sure you have the right cemetery?"

We left the station more confused than ever. On the drive back to Lisa's, my phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number:

"You can't hide from me, Sarah. I'm coming for you."

I showed Lisa. She immediately turned the car around, heading back to the police station. But by the time we got there, the message had disappeared from my phone. Like it had never existed.

That night, I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Tom's face. Not the Tom I loved, but the... thing from my dream. I sat in Lisa's guest room, lights on, jumping at every little sound.

Around 3 AM, I heard it. Scratching. Coming from inside the walls. Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.

It got louder. More frantic. Like something was trying to claw its way out.

Then, a voice. Tom's voice, but wrong. Distorted. "Sarah... let me in, Sarah..."

I backed into the corner of the room, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest. The scratching got louder, and louder, and then...

The wall started to bulge.

I watched in horror as the wallpaper stretched and tore. A hand pushed through.

Gray, decayed, with long, twisted fingers.

I screamed. I screamed so loud I thought my throat would tear.

Lisa came running in, her eyes wide with panic. "Sarah, what's wrong? I heard—" She stopped mid-sentence, her gaze fixed on the wall. "Oh my God," she whispered.

The hand was still there, clawing at the air, trying to push through further. Lisa saw it too. She wasn't imagining it.

"Tom?" Lisa's voice was barely audible, a mix of fear and disbelief.

The moment his name left her lips, the hand retreated, sucked back into the wall like a video played in reverse. The wallpaper smoothed over, erasing any evidence of the tear.

Lisa fumbled for the light switch, her hands shaking. As soon as the room flooded with light, the bulging wall completely disappeared. It looked perfectly normal, like nothing had ever happened.

We stood there in stunned silence, both of us staring at the now-intact wall. Lisa turned to me, her face pale. "Sarah," she said slowly, "what the hell was that?"

"You... you saw it too?" I asked, my voice trembling.

She nodded, running a hand through her hair. "I saw... something. A hand. The wall moving. But now..." She gestured helplessly at the normal-looking wall.

"You believe me now?" I asked, a hint of desperation in my voice.

Lisa took a deep breath. "I... I don't know what I believe. But I know what I saw. And it wasn't normal."

We spent the rest of the night huddled together on the couch, jumping at every creak and groan of the house. When morning came, Lisa looked at me with bloodshot eyes.

"Maybe... maybe we should talk to someone about this," she suggested hesitantly. "A medium or a paranormal investigator or... I don't know. Someone who might understand what's happening."

I nodded, too exhausted to argue. But deep down, I knew. This wasn't something that could be explained away or exorcised. This was Tom, or whatever was left of him, trying to come back.

Yesterday, I went back to my apartment to grab some clothes. As soon as I walked in, I knew something was wrong. It was cold. So cold I could see my breath.

And the smell. God, the smell. Like wet earth and decay.

I ran to my bedroom, grabbed whatever I could fit in a bag. As I was about to leave, I saw it. On my bed. A single red rose.

And next to it, a note: "Till death do us part, remember?"

I don't know what to do anymore. I can't sleep. I can't eat. Every shadow looks like him. Every noise sounds like his voice.

And now... now I'm starting to wonder. What if... what if I should let him in? What if this is my fault? For trying to move on? For not waiting for him?

No. No, that's crazy talk. Right?

I'm losing my mind. I know I am. But I also know this is real. Tom is coming back. And I don't think I can stop him.

If anyone out there knows what's happening, please help me. Please. I don't know how much longer I can hold on.

I'll try to update again. If I can. If I'm still here. God help me.

EDIT:

Also, an update: This morning, I woke up to find wet footprints leading from the front door to my bedroom. They look like Tom's shoe size. I'm staying at a motel now. I don't know what to do. I loved Tom, I really did. But the thing trying to come back... I'm not sure it's really him [anymore](https://www.reddit.com/user/prodshebi/comments/1e5c94y/welcome_to_my_horror_story_universe/).
