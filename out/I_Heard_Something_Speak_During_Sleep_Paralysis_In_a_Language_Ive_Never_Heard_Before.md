I’ve dealt with sleep paralysis since my teens. By now, I’m familiar with the routine. The frozen body, the weight on my chest, the looming sense that I’m not alone. But there was one incident about two years ago that still unsettles me every time I think about it. It was different. **Something spoke to me, in a way I've never felt or experienced before.**

It started like most of my episodes. I was asleep in bed and became suddenly aware that I couldn't move. I was lying on my side, facing the far side of the room, with my back to the rest of the bed. But I *knew* something was next to me, I could *feel* it.

And then I saw it.

There was a **tall, thin, pitch-black figure** standing directly beside me. No facial features. No glowing eyes. Just a void in the shape of an eerily stretched person, darker than the darkness of the room itself. The curtains were slightly cracked, letting in a soft line of natural light from outside, but somehow that only made the figure more visible. It was as if the absence of light had taken on form and weight.

Then it **started speaking**.

The voice was deep, heavy and fast. The language? I can’t even begin to describe it. I’ve *never* heard anything like it. It wasn’t gibberish, either. It was fluent. Intentional. It had a rhythm. It seemed articulate, with chunky, harsh, intentional sounds that carried this electric like feel. Almost like the words were being *charged* with something, vibrating in the air around me. I felt as though this thing was giving me some sort of instructions. To what they could be, I have absolutely no idea.

I was frozen. In typical sleep paralysis style, I couldn't move an inch. I couldn’t whisper a scream. But despite the fear (and I was absolutely terrified) the strongest emotion running through me was **rage**. Pure fury. I wanted to *attack* it. To *hurt* it. Which is strange because in most paralysis episodes, I just feel fear or confusion. This time, I felt like I was ready to fight for my life.

The figure kept speaking. Fast, intentional and deep, until suddenly I heard as clear as day, a voice *in my head*. Not in the language the figure was speaking. A different, human like one. Neutral. Commanding. Almost like narration.

**“And now you can wake up.”**

And just like that, I jolted awake. Soaked in sweat, heart racing like I’d sprinted a mile. The room was empty. Silent. I was alone.

I’ve had other sleep paralysis episodes. I’ve seen other black figures. Sometimes tall, sometimes short. Once I even felt myself flying toward the ceiling, only to wake up just before impact. And I’ve been diagnosed with something called **Exploding Head Syndrome,** where I’ll shift from a dream straight into a sleep paralysis state with an intense, painful vibration that feels like my skull is about to burst. It hurts so much that I’m convinced I’m about to die, until I suddenly snap awake, crawling with pins and needles, the pain gone like it never happened.

I'm not saying this wasn't sleep paralysis, it had all the hallmarks of it. But this experience felt really weird. The speaking. The language. The sort of weird *message*. I've never experienced anything like it before or since. It's the one experience that has stuck with me.

Has anyone else experienced something like this before? What are your thoughts on this? Interested to see what others may think!
