I’ve always wanted to write stories; I just never had the motivation to. I’d always get halfway through and then run out of ideas, or just lose the drive to keep going. But this time, I’m going to finish one, because you can’t run out of ideas when what you’re writing about what actually happened to you.

Before I begin retelling my night, I first want to apologise to my sister, Hanna. I’m so sorry. The fact that I’m leaving you this way kills me, but I have to do it. I have to follow what I’m being told. I love you so much, Hanna. Mum and Dad would be so proud of the woman you’ve become.

And for the police, or anyone else reading this, I am not suicidal. I am not unhappy. I would never kill myself because I’m sad. I’ve never been happier, and my life is finally falling into place.

With that being said, here is the night I just had.

The dark grey clouds billowed through the sky as if they had somewhere urgent to be, so thick not even the moonlight could cut through them. The air outside carried that pungent smell of storm water, filling your lungs the moment you breathed in. Every gust of wind whistled past windows like a farmer calling his cattle, sharp and shrill against the silence between strikes. Then came the thunder, bone-shaking, booming across the city loud enough to give a person Vietnam flashbacks even if they’d never stepped foot in the country. The rumble lingered for seconds after, crawling through the walls and into your chest like something alive.

For the fourth time tonight, a flash tore through my room, bright enough to make me think it had permanently bleached the walls. My eyes shot open as if the heavens had just cracked wide above me, only for the darkness to slam back a second later. I grumbled, “I need some better curtains,” as if saying it would magically make them appear.

Dragging my arm out from under the pillow, pins and needles crept from my elbow to the tips of my fingers, every prick sharp enough to make me wince. I reached blindly across the bedside table for the water bottle I could just make out in the darkness. My hand skimmed over cold wood, my phone, plastic, then nothing. A second later, the bottle toppled to the ground, the little water inside sloshing far too loudly for how little was left. The sound gradually faded as it rolled further than it should have, as though the darkness itself had decided to claim it.

I thought about just leaving it there and falling back into my dreams, but my throat had other plans. It was dry and sore in that way only a restless sleep can cause, like I had spent the night inhaling every speck of dust in my room.

I groaned and mumbled a few half-awake profanities while dragging myself out of bed, every bone and joint screaming in protest as I stood. The coldness of the room wrapped around me, sending a shiver down my spine.

I turned to grab the cotton blanket that usually lay across the end of my bed, but no matter how much I felt around, I couldn’t find it. Shaking my head in frustration and at the cold, which somehow felt even colder the longer I stood there, I remembered my original goal: the water bottle.

A thin sliver of moonlight broke through the storm clouds, catching the bottle and lighting it up in the darkness. I glared at it like it had wronged me personally. Just as I bent down to grab it, a sharp tap hit the window behind me.

I spun around faster than I thought I was capable of, staring at the balcony door where the sound came from. My eyes struggled to adjust after staring into darkness for so long. The city lights glowed faintly beyond the glass. Then I saw her.

A woman. Standing there.

My heart dropped. My breath caught in my throat as I tried to scream, but only a pathetic squeak came out. I rubbed my eyes hard, praying I was seeing things, that it was just my tired brain messing with me. Slowly, I peeled my fists away from my face and looked again.

My fucking towel.

It hung from the clothesline, flapping in the wind, soaked and useless. For the second day in a row, I was stuck with the tiny towel my ex had left behind, the one barely bigger than my torso.

Taking a deep breath to calm my racing heart, I turned back toward the water bottle that had already stolen too much of my night. The moonlight had vanished behind the clouds again, leaving the room in complete darkness. I bent down blindly, and pain shot through my spine like a jolt of electricity.

“Fucking bricklaying!” I screamed. “I’m going to be bedridden by thirty!”

Grabbing my lower back, I reached out with my free hand to feel around for the bottle, but there was nothing. With a grunt, I slowly pulled myself upright and did what I should have done the moment I woke up.

I felt along the edge of my bedside table until I found the lamp switch. It flickered a few times, clearly protesting being used for what was probably only the second time since I moved here five years ago, before finally flashing to life.

The soft yellow light filled the room, and there it was.
The bottle of water.
Sitting exactly where I had left it.
The little water still inside, swaying from side to side.

Staring at the bottle, a single tear of pure terror slowly made its way down my cheek, reaching my chin before falling to the floor below me. The old, dry wood soaked it up instantly.

I swallowed hard, the lack of saliva burning my throat. With an unsteady hand, I reached out and grabbed the bottle, the water inside sloshing rapidly from the shake in my hand. I closed my eyes, wanting to leave this place behind, if only for a few seconds.

My mind drifted back to when I was younger, to the days when I’d have panic attacks over the smallest things. Getting seventy percent on a test, putting a dent in the wall, little things like that. I’d curl up into a ball, hyperventilating, shaking, crying. No one could calm me down. No one except my mum.

Her voice was so calming to me as a child. The voice of an angel, my father used to say. She would walk over, crouch down beside me, and rub my back, whispering that everything was going to be okay. She’d tell me to breathe, count to five and breathe in, then count to ten and breathe out. Warmth would wash over me, and every problem I had would fade away into the deep ocean of my mind, drifting further and further out of reach.

That’s where I go when I feel a panic attack coming on, back to those moments. With that, I opened my eyes, took a deep breath, and sat down, placing the bottle beside me.

I reached for my phone and turned it on, blinding myself in the process. The light from the screen overpowered my lamp twofold. Scrambling for the brightness bar, I dragged it from max to the lowest setting. My eyes slowly adjusted. Swiping up, I angled it toward my face, but the massive crack in the screen had other plans. Impatiently, I punched in my passcode, 436744, the name of my ex-girlfriend I still refuse to change.

Opening the voice notes app, I saw only one recording sitting there, a twenty-seven second message from my mum. I tapped it. Her voice alone made tears well in my eyes.

“Hey sweetheart. I know, I know, you don’t like me calling you that. Twenty-one or not, you’re still my little boy. Anyway, sorry I missed your call earlier. Your sister told me what happened, and I’m so gosh darn proud of you, sweetie. I knew you’d be able to get a place of your own. Your sister and I are so happy for you, and I have no doubt if your father were still with us, he would be too.”

Those words hit me like a sack of bricks. Tears flowed freely down my face.

“I promise I’ll come down to see what you’ve done with the place when I get back from France. I love you so much, peanut. I miss you and your sister so much.”

The beep ending the message was far louder than it had any right to be. It lingered in the room long after it stopped, humming in the silence. I shut my phone off and the moment the screen went dark, the tears broke free. I collapsed into myself and sobbed, shaking, unable to hold anything in anymore.

After what felt like hours of crying, I wiped the tears from my cheeks, dragging the back of my hand across my face until the last drop clung to my eyelid and finally fell. My sheets were damp beneath me, cold against my skin. I pushed myself upright, chest still rising and falling too fast, my heartbeat thudding like it was trying to punch its way out. I rose to my feet, dragging in a deep breath as I tried to steady the hammering in my chest.

Glancing toward the kitchen, my lamp cast a weak, sick-looking glow that barely reached the corner of the room, let alone the light switch on the wall. Shadows thickened in every gap the light could not touch. I grabbed the bottle from the table, and the moment my fingers closed around it, that same ice-cold dread came flowing back. I still couldn’t understand how it had moved on its own, or how it had moved so quietly.

I took a step toward the switch. Then another. The lamp behind me flickered again, each stutter plunging me into momentary darkness. The air felt heavier with every step, like the room was filling with smoke I couldn’t see.

Just as my fingertips brushed the wall, the lamp gave one final buzzing flicker and died with a soft pop.

The apartment dropped into pitch black.

A breath, not mine, expanded the darkness beside me.

I froze.

Very slowly, like my neck was rusted, I turned my head to the left. And there, in the narrow space where my front door met the bathroom, something waited.

A shape too tall to stand upright.
A shape that folded itself into the corner, spine bent, neck twisted, head nearly scraping the ceiling.

It wasn’t just a shadow. Shadows don’t breathe.
This one did.
Long, slow breaths that rattled like broken glass in a chest too big to be human.

Its face, or whatever passed for one, pointed straight at me. I couldn’t see eyes, but I felt them. Heavy. Burning. Full of some emotion I didn’t recognise but instantly feared.

My whole body locked. I wanted to scream, but the sound crawled back down my throat and died there.

Forcing my arm to move was like trying to swim through wet cement. Inch by inch, shaking violently, I dragged my hand toward the switch. The creature’s breathing quickened, a low rasping like something sharpening itself. My fingers brushed the plastic.

It leaned toward me.

I slammed my palm into the wall. The light snapped on with a crack.

The figure vanished instantly. No fade. No movement. Gone like it had never existed.

But the cold it left behind stayed pressed against my skin.

Not taking my eyes off the corner, I crept toward the fridge, every step slow and trembling, terrified that if I blinked, it would be standing there again.

As I reached the fridge, I finally took my eyes off the corner, though the image of that thing was still burned into my cornea. A note was stuck to the fridge with my Daffy Duck magnet.

“I’ve replaced all that junk food in here with some healthier things. Stop eating shit, you fat cunt. Love, Hanna.”

“Fucking bitch,” I laughed under my breath as I yanked the fridge open, only to see she was telling the truth. My chocolate, leftover KFC, pizza, and a few other things had all been replaced with healthy microwave meals, fruit, and vegetables.

Shaking my head, I grabbed the water jug sitting alone on the door. I expected a full jug of ice-cold water, but instead it was completely empty, the only water being the condensation dripping down the sides.

“How fucking hard is it to fill some water?” I yelled in frustration as I chucked the jug into the sink, all of the night’s events crashing down on me at once.

Begrudgingly, I stormed over to the tap and filled the now crumpled bottle with lukewarm water.

Finally lying back in my warm sheets, my throat now nourished by the water, only for it to be replaced by an agonising headache. “I cannot catch a break tonight,” I moaned, though hearing my own voice felt pointless. The pain felt alive behind my eye, like something had crawled from my ear canal to behind my eyes and was now trying its best to force them out of my skull. I did not get a moment of peace. Tossing and turning, I continued to try to fall back into the quiet bliss of sleep, but try as I might, nothing was working. Even though my eyes were heavy, I was wide awake now.

The next few minutes slipped away from me. One second, I was staring at my ceiling fan slowly circling above me, thinking to myself, That was probably the culprit of the cold air before. I closed my eyes, willing them to stay shut, but sleep still refused to come.

A cold breeze brushed across my skin, followed by a heavy, chilly pressure on my feet. Confused, I opened my eyes.

The bedroom ceiling was gone.
Instead, the booming city stretched out beneath me.

Drunk people stumbled along the footpath below, their voices carrying up in messy echoes. The faint bass from the nightclub across the street thumped through the air. For a moment, I just blinked once, twice, rapidly, but nothing changed. I was outside.

Somehow, without remembering a single step, I had fallen asleep and walked onto my balcony.

I’ve never sleepwalked a day in my life.

Luckily the heavy rain from earlier had eased, and a light drizzle had taken its place. The people below didn’t seem bothered by it at all. Far off in the distance, the looming storm clouds that had occupied the sky above me earlier were drifting away to disturb someone else’s sleep, silent flashes of lightning following behind them.

The city beyond my building cast a faint glow onto the low clouds above, staining them a soft orange-grey. Looking out over it all reminded me how lucky I was. My apartment might be small, but this view made up for every inch I didn’t have. It beat my sister’s place by a mile.

Me and Hanna used to sit out here with a slab of beers between us, talking shit and complaining about our lives. She’d tell me stories about the tiny town we both grew up in, the same town I couldn’t wait to escape from, but that she still seemed weirdly attached to. She always said,
“I don’t understand how you can go from a small town straight into living in the heart of Melbourne.”

This view was always my answer.

The atmosphere was electric. Every building was beautiful in its own way, and my favourite of all, the MCG, towered proudly to my left, demanding your attention no matter where you looked.

I wandered closer to the edge and leaned over the railing, expecting that familiar twist of dread in my gut. But instead, a strange calm washed over me.
Not comfort.
Not relief.
Something colder.

A chill shot down my spine, yet my body relaxed as if someone was easing their hands onto my shoulders. For a moment, it felt like the whole world had gone quiet, waiting.

That was when I heard it.

A voice.
Soft. Oddly familiar. Female. Close enough that it might as well have been whispered in my ear. I instinctively turned, expecting someone to be standing right behind me.

But there was no one.
Only the empty balcony and the return of the hum from the city far below.

The voice whispered again, gentle and melodic, but the words were wrong. They didn’t sound like English. They didn’t even sound like a language I could place. They slid into my ears like a harp played backwards, soothing in a way that made my skin crawl.

I couldn’t understand what she was saying.
Yet somehow, I knew exactly what she wanted.

She was telling me to sit on the railing.

My body moved before my mind could argue, my hands resting on the cold metal as I lifted myself up, settling onto the edge as if it were the most natural thing in the world, like I had done it hundreds of times.

Sitting on the railing, my legs dangled into the void below. A sudden gust of wind slammed into my left side, hard enough to almost knock me off balance and send me plummeting to my death.

But I didn’t feel fear.
Not even a flicker.

Instead, a wave of pure glee surged through me, so bright and overwhelming it almost hurt. I couldn’t remember ever feeling this happy. Not once in my entire life.

The joy her voice had planted in me was sharper, sweeter, stronger than anything I’d ever known. Even the thought of holding my own child one day couldn’t compare to the smile stretching across my face now, a smile so wide it felt unnatural, like it belonged to someone else.

Kicking my legs gently over the edge, I felt a strange lightness in them, almost childlike. The smile on my face wouldn’t leave; it sat there as if someone else had placed it on me and forgotten to take it back. I waited, patient and obedient, though I didn’t know why. Something inside me was quiet now, quiet in a way it had never been before.

Then I heard it again.
Her voice.

Only this time, it wasn’t just a voice drifting through the air. There was shape to it, form, presence.

A soft glow appeared in front of me, floating with a grace that didn’t disturb the wind. The light stretched, opened, unfolded, becoming a being that hovered just above the balcony rail. Its body was impossible to describe in a human way; it was soft and sharp at the same time, shifting like silk underwater. In the very center of it all, a massive, unblinking eye gazed into me. Not at me. Into me.

The eye didn’t frighten me.
The closeness didn’t frighten me.
Nothing did.

There was no fear left.
No panic.
No sense of danger.

Only that strange joy, warm but hollow, spreading through my chest.

It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen, though I couldn’t explain why. Its wings, six, maybe eight of them, fanned out on either side, each pair moving at a different rhythm, keeping it aloft with a breeze that washed over my skin. The air it stirred was perfect. Not cold, not warm, just exactly what I wanted, without ever knowing I wanted it.

For the first time, it spoke in words I could understand.

“Be not afraid, my child.”

Her voice sounded like every choir I had ever heard layered together, ancient and soft, echoing in a place deeper than my ears. The meaning soaked into me instantly, calming every muscle I didn’t even realise was tense.

Then her words slipped back into that other language, the one I couldn’t place, couldn’t decipher, yet somehow couldn’t ignore. It was gentle and distant, like a lullaby whispering from behind a wall, too soft to fully hear, too loud to fully block out.

I closed my eyes and let her voice pour over me, wrapping around my head, my shoulders, my whole body. It was comforting in the way a warm bath might be comforting after a long day, except there was something underneath it. Something hollow. Something off.

Then, suddenly, it stopped. Her voice cut out completely.

The silence that followed was unbearable. It pressed into my ears like pressure building before a storm, louder than any sound I’d heard that night.

I opened my eyes.

The balcony was gone.
The night air was gone.
She was gone.

I was sitting at my dining room table, my computer open in front of me, the screen glowing white. I had no memory of walking here. No footsteps, no movement, just the lingering warmth of her presence fading around my shoulders.

But I knew what I was supposed to do.

I had to spread what I’d felt.
This strange joy.
This impossible calm.

People deserved to feel it. To understand it. Her whispers echoed faintly in the back of my mind, guiding me. Not words, just tones, almost like breaths drawn too close to the ear. She was waiting outside again. Waiting for me to come back to her, to return to that warmth and that light.

She wanted others to hear her. To feel her.

Her voice filled the silence around me as I prepared to join her again beneath the glow of her wings, in the place where everything felt quiet and light and unreal. All I can hear are her angelic whispers.
