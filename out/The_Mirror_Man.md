Jasper Moreau is a man in his late thirties, an otherwise unremarkable figure who blends into crowds and leads a life that many might consider routine: a quiet office job, a modest apartment in a mid-range neighborhood, and a few close friends who mostly only see him at social gatherings. He’s the kind of person who could easily be forgotten in a room full of people, but there’s something unsettling about him that few can pinpoint.

Jasper’s real obsession is with mirrors. It started innocuously enough, as a curious habit—pulling strange faces in front of mirrors. A furrowed brow here, a dramatic sneer there. He thought it was funny at first, a way to amuse himself, but over time, the behavior became more compulsive. Jasper began spending hours in front of any reflective surface he could find—bathroom mirrors, storefront windows, even the polished chrome of a subway pole. Every time he caught his reflection, he would distort his face, as if trying to see something different, something hidden behind his normal appearance.

At first, he experimented with exaggerated expressions—grinning maniacally, pulling his eyelids wide, making faces that would make a child laugh. But soon, the faces grew darker. He started to notice a shift in his own reactions. Sometimes, he would stare at his reflection, deeply entranced by the distortions he was making. He wasn’t laughing anymore. The faces became unsettling, grotesque—an exercise in pushing the limits of what a human face could express. He found himself unable to look away, lost in the tension between his normal features and the contorted versions he could summon.

There was a sensation he couldn’t shake—a feeling that when he made these faces, he wasn’t just distorting his physical features. It was as if he were unraveling something about himself, a self that existed only in those brief, strange moments. He even started to feel that someone else might be looking back at him from the mirror—someone he couldn’t quite recognize, but whose expressions seemed to resonate with a deep sense of… truth. This person in the reflection, distorted and wild, seemed to know something about Jasper that he himself didn’t.

Over time, the obsession deepened. He would stop by the same mirror at different times of the day, testing how his reflection changed based on his mood—his face would look different if he was tired or anxious, or even after a long day of work. There was a feeling of power, and simultaneously, a sense of horror, in this ongoing exploration of his reflection. Jasper began to feel like his real self was slipping away, slowly replaced by these exaggerated faces. He wasn’t sure if he was starting to lose his identity or if he was discovering something darker within himself, something he had long buried beneath the monotony of his daily life.

The strange part? No one else seemed to notice. He was just another person lost in their own little world. His friends had stopped commenting on his odd behaviors, chalking them up to his quirks. Even his family dismissed the bizarre habit as something harmless, a childhood phase that had lingered too long into adulthood.

But Jasper was increasingly alone with his reflections. He would go home at night, close the curtains, and sit in front of the mirror in his bedroom, sometimes for hours, pulling faces, sometimes laughing at the absurdity, sometimes crying in a strange, emotional release that he couldn’t understand.

It’s as if, for Jasper, the mirror became a portal—a gateway into understanding who he truly was and a way to confront parts of himself he had never wanted to face. In his twisted experimentation with his own image, he thought he might be coming closer to a kind of truth. Yet, the more he stared, the more he feared what might eventually emerge from that dark reflection, what could happen if he pulled one face too many.

It’s a cold, dreary evening when Justin finds himself standing in front of a mirror in his small apartment. He’s been at it for hours—pulling faces, one after the other. His reflection is becoming an ever-evolving gallery of grotesque distortions: gaping, angry sneers, wild-eyed expressions of confusion, exaggerated smiles that crack and stretch unnaturally. With each new expression, he feels a mix of fascination and dread, as though the face in the mirror is no longer just his own. He’s no longer simply playing with his features; he’s pulling at something deeper.

Tonight, something feels different. There’s an intensity in the air, something heavier. The silence of the apartment seems to press in on him as he stands before the bathroom mirror, eyes wide, staring into his own face with growing tension.

Justin exhales slowly, a nervous energy creeping up his spine. He starts with the usual—a wide, mocking grin, then a grimace, followed by a fake pout. But none of them feel right tonight. Each expression seems more hollow than the last, and he can’t shake the feeling that he’s being watched.

The room seems to narrow around him. He suddenly feels trapped, caught between the image of himself in the glass and the flicker of discomfort growing in his gut. He stares harder at the reflection, searching for the right expression to satisfy whatever dark urge is driving him tonight. His own face—normally familiar, comforting even—starts to feel foreign.

Then, it happens.

Without thinking, his face contorts into something he’s never seen before, something new. His jaw drops impossibly wide, and his lips curl up at the edges in a sickening grin, one that stretches too far, too sharply, pulling at the skin around his mouth like it’s made of rubber. His eyes bulge unnaturally, not in surprise, but in a distorted exaggeration of terror. They are wild, frantic—like they’ve been frozen in the midst of an agonizing scream, but the scream never comes.

His face seems to tear itself apart, muscles twitching in ways that shouldn’t be possible. He can feel his cheeks quiver, his eyes watering, but he can’t stop—he’s locked into the reflection. It’s as if his skin is splitting, stretching thin over the raw, exposed horror beneath. The face in the mirror doesn’t just look grotesque; it looks wrong, like something other—not a human expression, but a raw, primal thing that shouldn’t exist.

For a split second, Justin feels as though his reflection is alive. His own body seems detached from the grotesque figure in the glass, as if the reflection is mocking him, pulling at the core of who he is. He’s no longer looking at himself, but something darker, more primal—something twisted and distorted.

He freezes. The seconds stretch out. He can’t look away, but now, he doesn’t want to.

Then, an unsettling thought creeps into his mind: What if this isn’t just a face? What if this is the real me? The thought sends a shiver down his spine.

The grotesque face in the mirror suddenly seems to move. It shifts slightly, as if responding to his thoughts. The grin widens just a little more. The eyes narrow, and for the briefest moment, Justin feels as though the reflection knows him better than he knows himself.

With a gasp, Justin steps back from the mirror, blinking rapidly as the image dissipates. His heart races. He rubs his eyes, trying to convince himself it was just a trick of the light, a distortion caused by his own tension.

But the image lingers. It’s still there, haunting the edges of his vision, like a shadow clinging to his thoughts.

For the first time, Justin feels a deep, unsettling fear—a fear of what he’s been unlocking with each new face he pulls, and where it might lead. What if, just maybe, there’s something inside him—something he’s been hiding—that even he hasn’t wanted to see?

The air in the apartment is suffocatingly thick, heavy with the weight of the moment. His pulse still races from the horrific reflection he just witnessed—the grotesque face, the unblinking stare that felt almost alive… And then the sickening realization that maybe it was him all along. His hands are shaking as he stands in front of the bathroom mirror, his breath shallow, his chest tight. The cracks of the distorted expression linger in his mind, as though they’ve carved themselves into his very being.

He looks at the mirror again, trying to process what he’s just seen, but the reflection that stares back at him feels alien. He doesn’t recognize the eyes, the jawline, the face. It feels as if the reflection is mocking him, as if it’s showing him something that was always hidden, something unspeakable inside him that he didn’t want to admit.

His hands curl into fists, and the frustration grows like a pressure cooker inside his chest. How could this happen? How could this one moment, this one disgusting face, shatter his sense of self?

He steps closer to the mirror, almost as if drawn to it, his eyes locked on his reflection, filled with an almost uncontrollable rage. His chest heaves with the struggle to keep his composure, but the tension is unbearable. Every inch of him feels wrong, every breath coming out jagged, every thought spiraling.

Why is it like this? He wonders. Why do I feel like I’m losing my mind?

He doesn’t know when it happens. One moment, he’s just staring, his eyes wide with growing anxiety and confusion. The next, he’s lunging forward, fist raised high, and then—the punch.

The impact is sudden, violent, a sharp crack as his fist collides with the glass. The mirror shatters instantly, the sharp, jagged edges of the glass splintering outward in a spiderweb of cracks, like a cascade of broken promises. Justin stumbles back as shards of glass fall to the ground, the sharp edges glinting in the dim light. His knuckles burn from the blow, the pain immediate, raw—but it feels good. It feels like a release. His reflection is gone, shattered into a thousand tiny pieces, and with it, the part of him that had been staring back at him so unsettlingly.

But even as the glass falls to the floor, Justin’s heart races faster. The satisfaction of breaking the mirror doesn’t last. He looks at his hand—blood trickling from the knuckles where the glass had cut him. The stinging sensation is oddly calming at first, but then it hits him: the mirror is gone, but the feeling lingers. The oppressive, suffocating feeling that something dark still watches him from the shards scattered across the floor.

He bends down, his fingers brushing over the broken glass, as if looking for something. For what? An answer? A sign? He doesn’t know. The pieces of the shattered mirror reflect not just his bloodied hand, but also his disheveled face, now fractured into multiple versions of himself—each one reflecting a piece of the chaos inside him.

For a moment, he’s motionless. His breath is shallow, uneven. The sense of release that the punch had promised is quickly evaporating, replaced by something else. The mirror’s destruction had been a violent way to rid himself of the face he’d seen—but now, it feels like he’s only left with fragments of himself, broken and scattered on the floor.

The voice in his head grows louder.

You thought destroying it would fix you? You thought breaking the mirror would make it go away?

He steps back, his chest heaving as the enormity of what he’s done begins to settle in. The blood on his hand, the shattered pieces of glass—all of it suddenly feels meaningless, futile.

The mirror was just the surface. What if the real crack, the real shattering, was inside him all along?
