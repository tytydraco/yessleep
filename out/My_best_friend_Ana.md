I remember being on school, I had no friends and was playing with my dog plushie I got for my 6th birthday, I was on first grade and still had 0 friends but then I turned my head around and I saw her, a small girl, chocolate brown eyes, jet black wavy hair tied in two tails and light skin that stood out those big dark circles she had under her eyes, she seemed weak and lost until my thoughts got interrupted by her annoying sweet but acute voice, "HI! I'm Ana, want to be friends?" I looked at her dumb-founded and I was going to answer until she grabbed me by my hand and walked me to the playground, ever since then we've been inseperable but I noticed something about her that made her different, she was dumb and that made me fear that she would hurt herself.

The exact same year, 2013, I discovered she suffered from bullying just like me, the girls cut our hair and she cried a lot, I didn't get why she cried, I've always wanted to have my hair short like that so I just let that slide, her pigtails were gone, what a relief I hated those black little things hanging from her head, because of the bullying we changed school so on 2017 she fell in love with some guy named Aven, I kind of hated Aven, he seemed so distant and he just heard her talk like the parrot she was, what an annoying girl, the next year Aven distanced from her and then a text arrived to her Hangouts account she got from our school, "It's from Aven! He finally texted" She screamed at my face really hyped up, I wanted to reply but noticed those eye bags she got and couldn't manage to let out any word out of my mouth, there was silence for a while until Ana started crying, "Lucy, he doesn't want to be my friend anymore!" she sobbed, I didn't really know what to do when someone cried so I just held her and stayed there.

 Ana still liked Aven and I noticed how her feelings were getting stronger instead of weaker, on 2019 we were already on 7th grade and she still liked Aven, we both had a group of friends in which we both felt comfortable, Nala, Adri, Xio and Saima, Ana often denied her feelings for Aven and Nala took interest in the topic and kept asking her about the problem they had last year, Nala told Ana that she would talk with Aven so they would be friends back, that was a big joke, Nala got into a relationship with Aven, that dirty little bastard, that was one of the few times I felt any symphaty for Ana so I tried to ruin Nala's social life.

I was still with Ana, after all she was my bestfriend whom I cherished from very little, we both grew up and in the pandemic I kind of lost contact with Ana but reconnected with her after it, she told me about her love life again, why is she always so interested about love? She told me about this guy named Charles, she loved him they were in a relationship and continued to be in one, but then Ana got close with Laffy.

Laffy is a nice brunette-haired guy who I also appreciate a lot, I saw Ana had some weird patterns that were some kind of sign for being sad but still ignored it as she didn't really talk or cry anymore, I guess I now was the forgotten shadow of her life. 

Laffy and Ana were so close that I didn't really think her boyfriend had any problem, I didn't know Charles at a 100% just knew his age and name, I would always be there when Ana talked about her feelings but it never happened during their relationship.

On February, after Valentine's Day I was practically laying in my bed and a text arrived "Lucy, please come to my house, right now." It was from Ana, I kind of got confused but just managed to get out of bed and walk to her home, mom greeted me and dad was nowhere to be seen as always, I walked up to her room and went to her with a delicate smile but I felt my arm get grabbed roughly that got me inside her room.

"What the f-, Ana, what's wrong with you?" I protested until I noticed tears streaming down her cheeks and then it hit me, I'm always there when she cries and I have to listen to her, she just tried to contact me when she feels bad I felt a wave of rage entering my body and heard her whine about her recent life "My boyfriend cheated on me, I know it was my fault and that I should've left him and never actually got into a relationship with him but I did and now I know I failed myself" I was feeling something on my fist.

"I left Laffy do all the support thing for me because I didn't really feel like I had to vent to you because I always feel lonely but I got him into a problem that caused my ex to cheat" I was completely angry and I yelled at her, I didn't care about her relationship and that all she did was hurt herself even tho she knew what was she doing, I pushed her causing her to scream back and a discussion started.

I felt my face hot and turning red until I finally raised my fist preparing to hit her, I hated her jet black hair, I hated those dumb pony tails she used to have, I hate her annoying voice, everything, why can't she be out of my life? 

The mirror broke.
