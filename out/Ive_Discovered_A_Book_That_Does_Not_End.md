Most of my life I have been considered a “Bookworm” by the people around me in my life. I have always loved reading ever since my 11th grade English teacher assigned us to read Blood Meridian by Cormack McCarthy. That novel opened my eyes not only to how powerful stories are and their impact on human emotion, but also the depravity of human beings and their unrelenting nature.



After an experience like that I was hooked, I would search through bookstores, libraries, garage and estate sales, wherever there was a book to be found I was at the foreground. Once I had exhausted all of those means to find new and exciting reads I turned to the internet. I have a fascination with banned and lost books, something about the mystery surrounding them excites me and makes me want to consume them.



About three months ago I came across a listing on some second hand book website for a novel titled Worlds History: From Beginning to End. This immediately piqued my interest because I noticed there was no author listed, which is not unusual when authors want to remain anonymous. What made it strange was that there was no publisher or identity of anybody that made this book. It was also very difficult to tell exactly what time period this book was from, the hard cover looked as if it was almost brand new as if it was just pulled off the printing press. The pages on the other hand looked as if they were made of papyrus, which hasn't been used to make books in centuries.



I figured I must have stumbled upon a piece of lost media that I could hopefully use to impress the other excentrics I know online. I messaged the lister immediately asking if it was still available for sale, they responded about ten minutes later with a location pin about 250 miles away from where I was. I asked if we could meet halfway, but they just sent the same pin. Knowing how these sellers usually are, they won’t budge when they have a meeting place set in stone.



Picking up the book was uneventful, I drove to the guy's place, parked right outside his modest middle class home in the suburbs. I sent him a message letting him know I was there, he sent it back saying the book was in the mailbox and I have to leave the money in there. Aside from feeling like I was buying weed in high school again I didn’t have any off feelings about the interaction.



When I got home it was nearly eleven thirty at night and I put the book on my nightstand then fell asleep.



Once I woke up the next morning the first thing I did was crack that book open and begin reading. The novel was not as long as I had imagined for a full history of the world, only about 800 pages from looking at it. The first chapter opened up on a singularity in a vastless space of emptiness seeking growth, over the next fifty pages it discussed the beginning of our universe through the big bang. The second chapter was around thirty pages and talked about how organisms began to attach themselves to Earth creating a multitude of different species.



After a few more chapters I learned about the dinosaurs, evolution of man, the stone ages and evolution of tools, developments in language, art, and culture. Now I was about six hundred pages in and we have not even broken into the first empires of the world. In the tenth chapter and about seven hundred and twenty pages into the book it finally began discussing the start of civilization in mesopotamia. Once I read through that I was nearly at the end of the novel with only an initial history of the world. I thought the book might be a part of a series, but since I couldn’t even find a trace of this book anywhere I doubt I’d find any others.



The “final” page of the novel was on page eight hundred and seventeen and ended with a chapter talking about the rise of the Babylonian empire. As I flipped the final page to see the back cover I was surprised to see a new page with a new chapter title on it “Persian and Roman Empires”. I was shocked that they would add just one page of another chapter at the end of the book, but I read it anyway. Once I flipped that page another one was there after it. I swear I did not see or feel another page of the other side of the one I had just read.



This kept going for the next eleven hours, every time I would flip a page a new one would be there in its place to continue the story. Although the book seemed to go on indefinitely, the size of the book never changed. After all that time I had made it to around the year nineteen ninety seven with the death of Princess Diana. It was nearly three in the morning at this point and I had to process to some degree what I was experiencing, so I did my best to go to sleep. All night I could not stop thinking about this seemingly unending book, was it an optical illusion, was I somehow miscounting the pages, I had to figure out what was going on.



I waited for the sun to rise before I began reading again. Every new chapter at this point spanned over one hundred pages each and only depicted about six months to a year of history at a time. After another nine hours of reading I made it to modern day. They were discussing various airplane crashes that happened in Washington D.C, Philadelphia, and Scottsdale. I read about the death of my favorite director David Lynch, and all the other major events that have happened so far this year.



I don’t know how a book can be published mere hours after these events were being discussed. I kept turning the pages and kept reading when I realized it had listed an event that happened yesterday. This is impossible since I bought the book two days ago, how could it possibly have an event in it that happened yesterday. With my curiosity piqued I kept reading.



The novel continued into how the rest of the year will play out. I figured whoever wrote it had a bountiful imagination to insert their own predictions into a book about world history. Once I wrapped up the twenty twenty five years I decided it was a good time to go to bed, so I did.



I must not have slept much in the last couple of days because I had slept through the entirety of the next one. I woke up thirty two hours later in my bed. I did my usual morning routine of going to the bathroom, brushing my teeth, shower, shave, make breakfast, and put on the news. I found out I slept through a whole day when I saw the date on the news.



The story they were showing was about a sex scandal that happened with a very prolific celebrity. I felt a sense of deja vu come over me because I felt like I had heard about that before. I figured maybe I dreamed it or maybe I saw an article minutes after the scandal dropped. I know that was wishful thinking because for the two days prior to my sleep the only media I consumed was that book.



I went to my nightstand and picked up the book, flipping to the end to find the chapter on this year. Just as I thought there was a page that discussed the very same celebrity in the same sex scandal with every single detail painfully accurate. The book even discussed details that were not presented in any news footage or article online. The book had a police evidence like description of the crime and gave way to information a regular civilian should not have access to.



I’ve been a Christian all my life and I believe that this book is divine. It has access to information that no person has any right to know, I wish I didn’t know it myself but it is the curse I've bestowed upon myself. Whether this book is from God or the Devil I do not know, but I wish I had the willpower to stop myself from reading after I found its prophecy.



Once I began reading for the rest of the decade, I became more and more frightened about what I was going to learn. In the year twenty twenty seven it said there was to be an event that altered the course of human history. This was the popularization of easily accessible bio weapons in underground markets. Many private terrorist organizations, drug cartels, and even individual criminals hoarded as much as they could to either threaten or dispose of individuals or large groups of people.



One of the first attacks used was on the White House, a disgruntled voter had gained access to a lung cancer synthetic. The attacker mailed thirty small samples on different days in envelopes that would carry the disease airbourne when opened. Six months later nearly half of the white house staff, including the president, were either infected or had passed away from lung cancer.



Other groups would have different tactics like in twenty twenty nine when a domestic terrorist organization took a crop duster filled with a synthetic HIV virus and flew it over San Francisco as a homophobic attack. Or in twenty thirty two when we see the largest death toll from any bio weapon ever made.



Russia began experimenting with a new synthetic disease that would almost immediately kill the person affected by it. They called it smert’ sverkhu and it was used to fill the heads of atomic missiles to eviscerate the remaining people who survived after bombs were dropped. Russia launched three missiles towards Ukraine, but had not tested the scale of their airborne illness. They hit three different cities in Ukraine and wiped out every person in each one, along with the rest of the country. Russia had not foreseen that the virus would spread so wide, wide enough to destroy every person in the southern region of both Belarus and Russia.



I became obsessed with this book, it encumbered every waking moment of my being. I learned all about the future that our world and universe has to offer. I had to keep reading to understand what will happen within my lifetime and beyond. I wish I had just put the book down.



Soon after Russia held an accidental extinction of a country, the entire world fell into an arms race to see who had the most powerful and destructive bio weapon. The three countries with the largest quantity and highest mortality rate were, going from third to first, Russia, America, and Ireland. Ireland posed a major threat to the rest of the world because it owned as many bio weapons as both America and Russia combined. The three countries entered into a stalemate to see who would act first.



America were the ones to send the official declaration of war after a high ranking official was assassinated by an individual who was a part of the Irish Radical Party. They dropped bombs filled with large amounts of radiation on top of Ireland’s government bases.



Little did they know that America’s declaration would also be its end. The bombs were targeted at where the highest concentration of Ireland’s bio weapons were to eliminate them from the arms race entirely. The outcome of that decision was a worldwide spread of almost every type of disease known to mankind. Even diseases that were thought to be extinct were being brought to the light of day, the black plague, smallpox, and even Guinea worm disease.



Millions were killed upon the initial destruction, followed by nearly the rest of the human population within the next twelve hours.



Months and years go by without anything eventful taking place, just small segments for each chapter discussing how the terrain of the world has changed and the various mutated creatures that rose because of it.



After about three years worth of text was there any event involving a human occurring. Roughly ten thousand people across the world had a bomb shelter built in their home for the purpose of a global disaster. These individuals were the first to come to the surface after years of no human involvement in their environment. Around eight thousand of those people died minutes after reaching the surface because the air still lingered with a multitude of plagues.



The other roughly two thousand people that saw the ones that left the shelter and never returned, so they assumed what was true in that the surface was still dangerous. Many of them died in their shelter years later or until they ran out of nutrients. Few also ventured to the surface later to make a life for themselves, but met the same fate as their predecessors.



The year twenty eighty nine was the last year that humans existed.



After that plant life and “animals” took over the world. Within the next fifteen years plant life grew rapidly due to their mutations from the viruses. Except instead of growing into a green oasis, it turned into a mix of deep crimson and brown plants that covered every surface it could latch onto. The “animals” that survived lurked around the Earth and became extremely aggressive towards each other. This caused all life on Earth besides botanical life to cease existence by the year twenty one forty.



Centuries of text flows by in roughly thirty pages.



One thing that never got mentioned even in passing in the novel was the presence of god, any god for that matter. No religion was discussed beyond the crusades and other religious endeavors that did not directly involve faith. This book that seemingly knows everything the world has to offer had no answers.



What would be the point of living a devout life free from sin when it won’t aid me in a peaceful afterlife.



I’ve decided with whatever life I have left I want to live it like Biff Tannen from Back to the Future part two. I do not want to think about any of the knowledge I have consumed beyond what will give me a financial or spiritual gain. I have no faith left in humanity. I will make the quickest buck that I can and before the major bombs drop. After that I’ll build the most comfortable bomb shelter with enough supplies and entertainment to last me through the end of my days.



This post is not a warning on what's to come, that much is inevitable. I simply cannot be the only person who carries the burden of knowing what I have learned.
