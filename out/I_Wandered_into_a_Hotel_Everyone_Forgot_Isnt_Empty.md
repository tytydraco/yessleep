I’ve never been much of a somebody. Just a normal dude who works with graphics, locked away in my room most days — dark, quiet, predictable. But on weekends, when work finally loosened its grip, I’d step outside for a walk, just to remind my legs they still existed.

That’s when I saw it.

At the far edge of town, half-forgotten by everyone but time itself, stood an abandoned hotel. The compound loomed like a silent sentinel, its gates frozen in rust, its grand entrance strangled by wild vines. Whatever glory it once had was long gone, swallowed by decades of neglect.

Cracks snaked across the walls like ancient maps, patches of green algae clinging stubbornly, souvenirs of countless rainy seasons. The paint, once vibrant, had long surrendered to the elements, leaving behind ghostly whispers of color. Windows gaped like blind eyes, glass shattered, frames sagging. The place had been left to rot, and yet it seemed to breathe, as if the silence itself held its breath.

Then I heard it.

A faint, rhythmic thrum. Music.

At first, I thought it was in my head — exhaustion, or the wind humming through broken glass. But no. The beat grew, alive, impossible. A party? Here?

My chest tightened with equal parts fear and curiosity. The rational part of me whispered to turn back. But curiosity — stubborn, reckless — flared. I pressed against the gate. It groaned open, metal shrieking through the quiet.

I stepped into the wild embrace of the overgrown grounds, the pulse guiding me deeper. The front of the hotel remained dark, silent except for the restless rustle of leaves. The music tugged me further, coming from somewhere hidden, where shadows stretched long and secrets lingered.

And then I saw it.

A kaleidoscope of light and sound burst from a forgotten corner. People swayed and spun beneath twinkling bulbs. Laughter rang, glasses clinked — alive in a place that should have been nothing but dust.

“Hey, let’s join the party!”

A familiar voice slipped out of the shadows. Solis. Then Luna. The sound of them here jarred me, and yet it felt… inevitable. Their presence was normal, as if I had been waiting for them all along. And that normality made my stomach twist tighter than any fear.

Of course they were here. Why wouldn’t they be?

The hotel itself was still a ruin. Windows broken, wood rotting. But the party continued as if nothing were amiss. Music throbbed, laughter echoed, and my friends seemed both comforting and wrong. Like stepping into a dream that refused to obey reason.

We plunged into the revelry. The bass rattled through me, my body moving before my mind caught up. Yet beneath it, a whisper tugged at me, low and insistent: *Wrong. This is wrong.*

It swelled, threading through the music, louder than the beat. My skin prickled with a desperate urge to leave, to slip out through the gate before this place swallowed me whole.

I shifted. Solis' hand closed around mine — gentle, but unyielding. Less friendship, more restraint.

“Look,” he said softly, eyes fixed on the hotel. “Isn’t it incredible?”

I followed his gaze — and froze.

The hotel was still a ruin. Yet woven among the decay were flashes of something else: polished marble, unbroken windows catching light, glints of gold trim. Half rot, half splendor. My mind wavered. I knew the truth — this place was dead. And yet…

It was magnificent.

The thought rooted itself in me, heavy and convincing. My lips moved before I could stop them.

“I suppose it is.”

The words surprised me, as if someone else had spoken. A sudden, absurd expectation took hold — the doors would swing open, staff smiling, and I would be welcomed inside.

“How much for an overnight?” I asked, startling myself.

“$1,” Solis said casually. “Deluxe room, aircon, breakfast, pool… and the party.”

I blinked. The price made no sense — a hotel that looked like this, crumbling and overgrown, shouldn’t have anyone running it, let alone charging $1 — and yet, I didn’t question it. I accepted it, as if agreeing was just the natural next step.

“Bit generous, eh?” he teased, a sly grin tugging at his lips.

“Sure,” I said, almost automatically. By saying it, I felt as though I’d just checked in — an invisible contract sealed by a word.

“And you two?” I asked, glancing at Solis and Luna.

They exchanged a look, certain and teasing. “We’ll be joining you,” Luna said softly. “All part of the holiday.”

I swallowed. The thought of us three, stepping further into this impossible place together, felt both comforting and wrong in a way I couldn’t name.

As we walked toward the front lawn, expecting the lobby to appear, my eyes drifted back to the gate I had come through — still in ruins, vines clawing up the iron grills.

Half-open, half-close, it hung like a silent witness to my intrusion earlier. For a fleeting moment, the wind twisted through the bars, like the gate whispered directly to me, "*Leave now. You have to leave now."*

I paused, caught between the crumbling gate and the glowing porch. My foot lifted toward the ruins. *Should I leave?* The thought pulsed sharply in my chest.

I glanced back at Solis and Luna. They stood on the porch, smiles warm and inviting, hands lightly resting on the railing. Friendly. Reassuring. Impossible.

And somehow, before I even decided, my steps carried me toward them.

We reached the porch together, the air shifting around us. I could still see the twisted vines, the rusted iron of the gate behind me — a half-forgotten warning — but the lobby door ahead gleamed, pristine and wide, as if it had always been waiting.

Solis gestured. Luna smiled. And together, we pushed it open.

The lobby swallowed us whole.

When we stepped into the lobby, staff appeared as if on cue — friendly receptionists with perfect smiles, guiding us past floors that gleamed as though freshly polished. My eyes drank in the hotel’s glory days, walls shining, lights sparkling, the space immaculate.

And yet my chest tightened. My heart still saw the cracks in the walls, the faint stains, the decay lurking beneath the surface. The lobby shimmered with impossible perfection, and I couldn’t tell if it was real… or if I was just losing my mind.

While I took in the lobby, Solis and Luna waved me over to the reception desk. The staff greeted us warmly, their smiles flawless, their movements precise, almost rehearsed. The receptionist explained the “$1 deluxe” as a special promotion — some excuse about a limited-time offer. My mind accepted it without hesitation. Somehow, it seemed plausible.

\---

We checked in.

The bellboy guided us down gleaming corridors to our room. I glanced around, taking in the simple décor — a vase here, a map pinned to the wall there. Solis and Luna skipped ahead, tossing their bags onto the beds, unpacking with a bright, effortless energy that made the space feel alive.

I lingered in the doorway, eyes tracing the familiar cracks, faded paint, and sagging ceiling. Shadows stretched a little too long. My chest tightened, but my brain whispered reassurances: everything was fine. Beds neatly made. Floors polished. Air crisp. Perfect.

And yet… something didn’t feel right.

\---

I lingered by the window, scanning the scenery beyond — trees swaying gently, mountains rolling in the distance. Almost, I forgot I was in ruins.

Below, the party pulsed on. Solis and Luna moved through the crowd, laughing, dancing, glowing as if nothing had ever been wrong. They looked so happy, so impossibly normal.

They waved at me from the porch, calling me back. I shook my head, preferring solitude. Introvert instincts, I told myself. They waved goodbye, smiling, and disappeared into the throng.

I decided to take a shower. Everything was… perfect. Hot and cold, just as I liked it. A moment of normalcy.

Then… something felt off.

Not a quake. Not a sound. Just… wrong.

The dresser wasn’t where it should be. The lamp sat at a slightly different angle. Even the air felt rearranged, like the room had exhaled while I blinked. The changes were so subtle they could’ve been my memory betraying me — but deep down, I knew they weren’t.

My eyes drifted to the floor plan on the wall. The map stared back at me, but it wasn’t the same as before. Corridors curled into places I didn’t remember. A door I could’ve sworn existed was gone. The whole layout seemed to breathe in quiet defiance of what I knew.

I stepped back, towel clutched in my hand, heart hammering.

Through the window, the party raged below — laughter, music, lights — all untouched, all oblivious.

A chill slid down my spine.

Panic devoured me. Sweat slicked my skin. I threw my clothes on, rushed to the door—  
and froze.

This wasn’t the hallway we’d come from.

My lips refused to move, but in my head I screamed. My chest clenched, mind racing. I whipped back to the map, desperate, tracing corridors, memorizing some path—any path—back to the lobby. Then I ran.

The lobby. The wide doors. I shoved them open, bracing for sunlight.  
Nothing. Night had fallen.

Still, I was out. I bolted toward the gate. Relief flickered—  
then vanished.

The gate was gone.

I spun in circles, frantic. *It was here. I know it was here.* But the fence stretched endless. No exit. No escape.

Solis. Luna. The party.

I stumbled back toward the music, breath ragged, until I found them in the crowd.  
I grabbed Luna’s shoulder, shaking. “The floor map changed! The hotel shifts!” I turned to Solis, voice cracking. “The gate is gone! The gate is gone!”

The words felt insane even as I said them.

And yet—no one else reacted. The party raged on. Laughter. Dancing. Glasses clinking. A world untouched.

I looked again. Solis and Luna stood smiling at me, gentle, calm.

“What’s wrong?” they asked, their smiles too steady.

“We have to get out of here,” I whispered, heart pounding.

Solis sipped his glass, "The wine tastes good tonight".

They only smiled wider. But comforting.

“Everything’s fine,” they said. “Besides… the party never ends.”

Then they ventured towards the party.

\---

As their words echoed in my head — “the party never ends” — a shiver crawled down my spine.

I couldn’t take it. I had to get out.

The gate was gone, but the fence still stood. *I’ll jump it. I don’t care if I break my legs. I just need out.*

I sprinted to the yard, grabbed the cold bars, and hauled myself up. My pulse roared in my ears. Almost there. Almost free.

I pushed off, leapt—

—and landed hard, knees jolting. The ground felt real, solid. A shaky breath escaped me. Relief. *I made it. I’m out.*

But then I lifted my head.

A familiar porch. The same wide doors.

The hotel.

\---

UPDATE:

I’m still here—in this hotel. Somehow, I stumbled across an old computer tucked away in the corner of a dusty room. Against all odds, it powered on. Even more bizarre—it connects to the internet. I don’t know how, and I don’t care to understand. All that matters is I can still reach you.

But listen carefully. I have one warning.

If you ever find yourself in an abandoned hotel, and you hear music playing from somewhere inside… **don’t follow it.**

For anyone still wondering about Solis and Luna—yes, your suspicions are correct. They’re the ones pulling the strings, controlling the time loop of day and night.

Take my advice seriously—please.
