Rodney and I were always really close, so of course, I was the first one to support him when he started one of his new "projects". We had spent our entire summer trying to figure out the details of the machine Rodney was trying to build. He wanted something that could scale shift a human, you put in a value, and it either expands or contracts you to that size. 

I was all ears. It would certainly be of our best interests for me to become way taller and get my Lady Dimitrescu cosplay to come to life. 

At first my friends Alice and Blair were skeptical that it could even be built. Rodney, however had full faith in us. We worked countless nights, taking out time whenever possible, sometimes in class, or at work. Slowly, an obsession had seeped into our veins and hardened into something permanent. We needed to build this; it was almost as though we were the ones destined to create something that people considered straight out of science fiction. 

After 3 years, we had finally built it. It was a large glass cylinder, hooked up to a thousand little machines on the outside, and a mainframe where you typed in the exact scale, and a button to press. 

We had spent months fighting on how we should ensure utmost safety, and reversibility. One thing all of us agreed on was double factor authorization. Someone on the outside would press the large button and the person inside would provide a signal. Only then the change would go through. But how was the person on the inside supposed to signal us? we could use a button, but what if they shrink and can't reach it? Maybe someone can help them up? But what if they can't put enough force on the button? what if someone gets too big and breaks it? So, after a lot of bickering we settled on one option that screamed novelty. We would blink thrice and the scanners inbuilt would notice this rapid flickering, scan the source of the disturbance, and if it is recorded as blinking, which it would if it scans any of our eyes that exists in its biometric database, it will count. If it is 3 blinks, rapid, one after the other, it takes that as authorization. 

After the machine was built, Blair was the first one to try it out. He wanted to shrink himself to half his height. We put in the data, and watched him go in. He winked at us from inside, and Rodney lifted up his hand, counted down from three, then two, then 1, and soon a flash of light blinded us, and stood on the other side of the glass Blair, but much smaller, now coming barely up to my shoulders. He squealed, and jumped, but the uncanny feeling made him decide to turn back.

Then I went in, asking to expand to 6 feet and 90kgs, from my 5 feet, 50 kg self. The light this time was not just blinding, it felt like I was being melted from the inside out, and the excruciating pain which lasted a few seconds felt like a lifetime. And of course it worked. The feeling was awkward, I could barely figure out how to adjust to the new height, and how to walk. So, I turned back. 

Then came Alice. Of course, Alice wanted to be different. She wanted to get to 63.5 mg exactly and be 2 inches tall. We weren't sure, but she insisted. She entered the cylinder, and once again the same countdown was done. The light this time lasted for a much shorter time. When it cleared up, We saw no trace of her. Rodney entered the cylinder, me closely behind. Then we saw it. A, shriveled, mass at the front of the cylinder. Rodney picked it up. It had a tiny slit, with a tiny tongue, unable to make any comprehensible words come out of it, clearly not used to the dimensions of the tongue. But unlike us, it hadn't scale shifted, no, it looked like a baby's leg, wrinkled pink skin covered the glob of fat, and thick follicles of hair protruded out of it. It had no ears, or nose, or hands or feet. Only a tiny mouth, and two tiny eyes. 

Blair was scared, and so was Rodney. This was not what we had expected at all. "let's just, let's just turn her back" Rodney said hastily. We didn't know if she could hear us, so we propped her up on a chair and showed the countdown, hoping she would understand. But when Rodney pressed the button, the familiar light didn't appear. Blair took over, trying to figure out the error, they tried again, nothing. Until, a weird feeling began flooding my veins. I walked inside, despite the boys screaming at me not to. I had a pit in my stomach. I lifted up the glob; its mouth shaped into a tiny circle to produce a helpless moan. Hands shaking, I lifted the fold of skin covering its eyes.  
  
 My suspicion was confirmed. It had no eyelids, and it was blind. Instead of eyes, 2, thin, white circular irises stared back at me. Where the pupil should've been, was the same, pink skin. She couldn't blink, she couldn't even see. 

We are unsure of what to do, we tried overriding the code, to enable external single factor authorization, but considering how tight we had made it, it seemed like a distant dream before we could get it to work. Alice, if I can even call it that, is lying in a small petri dish in the room. We don't know how she respires, but the periodic moans tell us she is alive. 

I can't imagine how she must feel.

At night I reassured Blair, who had dated her for two years. They broke up last year agreeing to be friends. I rubbed his back, lying through my teeth, when I said we would figure it out. Blair and Alice had done most of the coding for the authorization, so without alice, it would be a herculean task. Blair didnt say anything, just looked down at his feet. 

But seeing Blair feast on his potatoes at dinner, with a familiar outline of a glob in his pocket, biting back his grin, I can't help but wonder, if this was all on purpose...?
