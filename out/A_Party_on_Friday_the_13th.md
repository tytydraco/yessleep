  

Friday the Thirteenth. January. 2023. Every year I think they can’t make glasses out of the incoming year. And every year I’m proven wrong. 

We will be three years removed from one of the most devastating, soul-crushing, life-changing events in human history. Feels like it’s getting back to what once was, and what will ever be.

7-11. Approximately 12 miles from destination.

*Ding.*

The fluorescent light gives off an intimidating aura. No matter. Spirits are high, friends are waiting, and Takis are sitting on a shelf, to be destroyed. 

“Z, grab some dip too,” Shell says as we split up after entering the store. Her name is Michelle, but we’ve all called her Shell for as long as I can remember. 

I put a thumbs up as I walked down the aisle, hoping she’d see it. I was on a mission, and we could not waste precious time talking. We only had an hour before the party started. As my friends and I referred to Michelle as “Shell,” she, and the rest, referred to me as “Z.” My actual name is December. I know, I know. You probably don’t know too many Decembers. Besides the month. As a child though, I was the most active. Involved in everything from dance, volleyball, ballet, chess, drama, and competitive drinking (in my college years.)

I can’t remember exactly how the joke started, but I was referred to as having “Zazz.” I can’t disagree. So, my friends shortened it to “Z,” for short. And it stuck. 

My duty had been fulfilled, Takis, dip, and some more drinks. I meet Shell at about the same time, right at the counter. She had retrieved her part. Mission successful. 

I gave the clerk a closed mouth smile, exchanged pleasantries, and reached into my back pocket, retrieving my debit card. 

“Where you ladies headed, little girls’ night out in the city?” The 711 employee spoke. The smell of stale cigarettes became even stronger when her mouth opened. Gnarly yellow teeth and those off-putting stress lines surrounded her lips. Don’t get me wrong, she seemed very nice, but a little strange.

I looked at Shell briefly, before returning my attention to the clerk, who’s name tag said “Die.” I shook my head, cleared my eyes. “Diane.” Ok, that was weird.

I once again put that stressful closed mouth smile on. “Oh, he he no, well yes, well. Ok, take a deep breath Z. We ARE going to a party, but no, not in the city. “Yes, we’re going out, actually only a few miles away from here. We were both so happy to see a convenience store around. Thought it was all country out here.”

And with that, I started to pay for our food and prepared to say goodbye forever to this 711 and “Diane.” As she asked me if I wanted a receipt, I started to shake my head no.

“So where are you going?” she asked, head down, looking at the receipt printer. It took me a second. Kind of rude to just pry into my personal life. Again, I looked at Shell. Her face said, “I don’t know, grab your receipt, or don’t, and let’s go.” For some reason I told her.

“Umm..” I stumbled. “Well, we’re going to a friends house.” As I was speaking, I decided it probably wasn’t a good idea to say exactly where we were going. Not like she was going to follow us or anything, but why take that chance.

“It’s just a place in the woods, Miss. You actually have to go by the old Mill to get there.”

This ladies’ eyes widened slightly. I swear I could see a glossy sheen coat them. Along with a slight shake.   
 “If you’re going to drive by the mill.. flash your lights. As many times as you can, before you pass it.”

Shell accidentally let out a snort, and then quickly covered her mouth with both hands. I knew it was accidental when I saw her eyes.  

I gave her a look that said, “please don’t make this weird, lets just get out of here.” 

I kindly smiled at the clerk. I grabbed our purchases, while Shell was still holding her face and looking dumb. I gave her a slight push, meeting her eyes with mine. Eyebrows raised, as if to say “get to it.” Shell understood without saying anything and grabbed one of the bags. I reached for the remaining items on the counter, but before I could, a sinewy white hand grabbed my wrist with such force, it sent pain waves through my arm. I let out an automatic “HEY,” before being pulled down toward the counter. I was yanked down with such force that my chin almost struck it. I raised my eyes, now staring directly at Diane. She lowered herself behind her side of the counter to meet my eyeline. 

“I’m trying to help you,” this psycho said.

“Get off of-,” I tried spitting out before this apparent she-hulk in hiding wretched my wrist even harder.

“Flash… your… lights. When you get close… flash your lights before you get to the Mill.” And with that, she released her grip. I instinctively moved backward, getting away from this freak while also grabbing my wrist. That really, really hurt. I looked at Shell. Who knows what that whole thing just looked like to her.

“Let’s go,” I motioned toward the door. Shell didn’t say a word.

As we entered our vehicle, she finally opened her mouth, laughing in a sarcastic, yet realistic manner. After what I just went through, I couldn’t tell if she was laughing out of nervousness or what.  I could tell she was freaked out, as I was. After a few seconds I joined her in releasing a few cathartic laughs. 

“Holy shit Z, I’m sorry. Are you ok?” I took a moment. I looked at my wrist, red, but not broken or anything. I looked back at the 711. I didn’t see anyone behind the counter. I didn’t wait to see if psycho berry would come back.

“I’m fine. Throw the stuff in the back, we only have a few minutes’ drive to the party.”

Approaching the Old Mill. Approximately 4 minutes from destination.

The car ride from our “twilight zone,” appearance at the 711 has been silent. Shell mainly swiped up and down and left to right on her phone. I put SiriusXM channel 9 on. After nothing but silence, Shell almost blew my eardrums off.

“SHIT, Z! The Mill?! Did we pass it yet?”  
 “First off… ow,” as I rubbed my right ear sarcastically. “And no, we are close though, maybe a mile. The sign said the historic mill is coming up about 1 mile. That was about a mile ago.”

Shell’s eyes popped. “DUDE! Start flashing the lights!! Didn’t you hear what Die said?”   
 I laughed, not meaning to look at my still throbbing wrist. “I’m not going to take part in some country urban legend. You.. don’t believe that do you?” I looked at Shell with that last part. She wasn’t laughing. She wasn’t smiling. I couldn’t see one centimeter of white, her lips were closed too tight.

“Oh, here you go,” I said. “It’s the star of the night.” An old white building, presumably built around the early 1800’s was approaching on our right. Although it had been dark for some time (it is January, after all,) The old mill was eerily visible. Maybe it was the white paint being illuminated by the moon. Which was itself eerily full. I hope it’s not a full moon on top of all this tonight. The “mill,” part was a dark, evil circle pasted against the all-white ancient building. Where it used to churn, brining 100’s of 1000’s, perhaps millions, of gallons of water into the mill to help make.. whatever they made back then. Or perhaps it was just to create electricity. 

I shook my head. I realized I had kind of daydreamed in that half second upon seeing the mill. I looked at Shell. She was still waiting for an answer on flashing the lights.

“Here’s flashing my lights,” I said. With that I slowly extended my right arm. My left arm remained on the steering wheel. I closed my fist. As I gave a sly peak to Shell, my middle finger extended. Flipping the bird immediately broke the tension. Shell snorted, buried her head in her lap, then sat back, flipping her hair behind her. She extended both arms, and both middle fingers along with me.

“Oh, nice, always showing me u-“

“What’s wrong?” Shell said, I was just follow-

“Shh.” “A truck is coming up behind us.” I said quietly. Now all middle fingers were securely placed back in their holsters.

“So.. either let them pass or speed up,” Shell said with her trademark optimism.

“Have you seen any other cars on the road tonight? I haven’t. Just weird that’s all.” I diverted my focus from the road ahead of me, to the rear view, road ahead, rear view. I was hoping our destination was close, but the GPS just happened to lose signal. Not uncommon around here, but..

“He’s throwing his high beams on,” I said. Shell looked in her side mirror to confirm.   
 “Ohh… no… this isn’t..” She couldn’t continue her statement. 

The truck was now within a car length. Lights aggressively going from on to off, to brights, to off, and back on again. And then the horn started. I was immediately struck by some kind of “Texas Chainsaw,” vibe for some reason.

For whatever reason, I sped up. The truck kept pace. Shell was freaking out. I was freaking out.

“Dude, just pull over, let him go!” She pleaded with me. Again, for some reason I felt safer just moving forward. No doubt we missed our destination. I didn’t care. 

BANG

“Holy shit, he hit us!” Shell screamed.   
 “Yea, I’m aware, babe.” I said. Internally screaming but trying to save us from this absolute nutbag. Who knows what their intentions are. I hit the gas again, and again the truck followed suit. The brights were flashing so fast it seemed like a human could not be capable of doing that manually. Shell started crying. I literally put the accelerator to the floor. It didn’t do much. The vehicle behind us was going to rear end us again, and this time it won’t be so gentle.

…. Except it didn’t. All at once, the headlights following us became smaller.. and smaller. It had stopped and reversed. Quickly. Not knowing what in the hell to make of this, I violently pulled over, mashing the break with both feet. We skidded to a dangerous stop on the side of the road.

I looked at Shell, dust and dirt followed the car at our sudden stop.  
 “Do.. do you think this is because we didn’t flash ou-“

*Destination Arrived*

Shell and I both looked at my phone stuck to the dashboard. 

I looked outside. Sure enough. This was the party we had both been invited to. I think the other girls were invited too. Come to think of it, I forgot exactly who is hosting, just wanted to get out for the night. 

“Well… I guess we should just… go in then, yeah?” Shell said, with absolutely no confidence.   
 “Look,” I said. I grabbed an item from the back. “I’ll admit, that was all pretty freaking weird. But I’m not gonna let that ruin this. You with me, old girl?” I smiled at Shell, and it seemed to work. She smiled back. 

I pulled a seltzer off of one of the six packs we grabbed and ripped the tab off of the top. Clear sticky alcohol exploded onto both of us. When the moment cleared.. we both started dying laughing. 

“The uh.. reckless driving… probably shook these up a bit,” I said. And that just got us rolling again.

We made our way toward the front door. Totally normal looking house. Cars scattered about the lawn and driveway. Back to normal. Wishful thinking.

The door was open. Wide open. Only a faint yellow glow emanated from what looked like the dining room, about 20 or so feet away.

I looked at Shell. “What do you think this is, some kind of joke?” She said. “I kind of hear music… don’t you?” I stopped for a second, putting my arm out to also halt Shell. We both put our heads down, concentrating.

RIIIIIIIIIIIIING

We both jumped, now grasping each other without knowing. I’m surprised our skin is intact.   
 “Did you hear a phone?” I asked. She nodded. There was no follow up ring. As soon as we both moved…

RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING

Ok, what the.. 

“You should have just done it.” 

A whisper from behind us almost knocked us both to the ground in fear. Quickly turning around, we saw nothing. 

“Ok, I’ve seen enough horror stories to know when to get the F out,” I said. “Where are all the people, there’s like 20 cars outside,” Shell added.  
 “Who cares, I don’t want to find out the answer.” With that, I dropped the 711 bag, as did Shell. I grabbed her hand and started back toward the front door, which was now shut. I don’t remember either of us shutting it.

Something was written on the door. In red. A sickening feeling painted my entire body.  
 “Do.. do.. do you see that?” Shell said with a shaky voice.

I indeed saw it. Not wanting to admit it, we moved forward until the letters were readable. In big letters, spraypainted red, hopefully spray paint, was the following:

“You should have just followed the one rule… Happy Friday the 13th…”

And that’s when we noped the heck out. This is what I can remember from pure memory, I’m sure it was even worse. So, if you get invited to a shady party in the middle of the woods… maybe consider not going. Or, at the very least, flash your lights when you drive by the mill.
