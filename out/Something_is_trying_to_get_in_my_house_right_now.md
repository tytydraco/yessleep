Somethings trying to (actually) get indide my house right now

Animal trying to get in the window?

Not a creepypasta or anything like that but a bit creepy, theres legitimately sone kind of animal that wants in. 

Midnight right now, about two hours ago whilst i was playing a game and my wife was getting ready to sleep she started asking if i heard something and I said no. Later again she said she heard something and as its starting to storm outside and i looked over at the window (blinds down) i made out that the bushes outside were swaying heavily and decided it was them scraping against the window.

20 minutes go by, I stay up, wife goes to bed. I see a small black silhouette through the blinds and think my cat is sat on the sindowsil looking out, but its bobbing up and down slightly whilst i hear the noise again, so i think my cat is trying to climb the window or claw at the moving branches on the other side of the glass.

Then i see my cat, on the floor, staring up at the window with its tail tucked around itself. I move up to the window, no cat on the windowsil, through the blinds i see the vague silhouette of what couldve been some kind of canine to possibly a small bear - mostly just a silhouette with two pointed ears on top - slide down away from the window as i reach to pull the blind away. Ive seen all kinds of animals near my house, even beavers and a rattlesnake of some kind, so nothing would surprise me.

Trying to look out the window i see nothing as its a bush, its dark outside, and the light is on in the room im in. I move to go close a window in a room weve been repainting to make sure it cant come in through the screen, and as soon as i close that window i hear the scratching on the window in the living room again. Every time i go up to look it disappears. I might be going crazy or paranoid but i also swear i keep hearing a faint coughing from no particular direction. Maybe its a bark? No idea. Its not my wife and not my toddler. 

Side story, a few weeks back when we'd just moved in, my wife and I were having a movie night in the living room. We have a security system that should alert if any doors or windows open or even are smacked too hard, it was like 1 or 2 am. Earlier that night I went to make a snack and there was nothing. My back door is in my kitchen, theres a motion light, right? Kept noticing it was on all the time but nothing really happened. 1 am or so, i go into the kitchen to make some more popcorn, and just *inside* the back door, next to the litterbox, there are two... dollar store shelves. Like wireframe rack things youre meant to put on your counter top for your plates/silverware to dry. Just... inside the house, door unlocked  alarm never went off, neither me nor my wife bought those shelves. So this is the second kinda fuckin creepy thing with no explanation.

Its been hours now. Im expecting mostly a stray dog, but im also on the edge of town and dont want to open the door to find a blackbear that wants out of the rain. Still, it is tennessee, and weve all heard the dozens of appalachia folklore stories about monsters and shit, and i am right next to the woods, so its pretty creepy. I do have guns, though i sold most of the larger calibers off before recently moving, so ive got a 12 gauge with target loads that probably wont do jack shit, and a 9mm pistol that also probably wont do a lot if a bear decides it just wants me dead. Neither will probably do a lot if its a wendigo or some other crazy folklore shit, but at least if i die mysteriously this post'll be around for investigators, right?

Ive got no doubts about a bear's ability to get into a house if it decides it wants to, and apparently my deadbolt and alarm system didnt stop whoever the shit decided to 'give' us the shelves. (I keep hearing the scratching every 30 seconds or so as I write this post. I know *some* of them are the bush, probably most, but occasionally i look over and see the silhouette again. 

I could raise the blinds and keep them up to see it better but that... feels like a bad idea. My porch light apparently burnt out cause it wont turn on to let me see anything either. I *would* have a dog to be barking, but just before we moved here to Tennessee i was in colorado with the army, and a few months before the move he got bit by a snake in the yard and sadly didnt make it to the vet fast enough as he wasnt a particularly large dog. 

Jesus christ whatever it is just banged on the window loud. I know this reads like some generic horror story and i didnt mean for it to start sounding all ghost story-y but this is genuinely starting to freak me out. I wouldve hit post already but the automod said i hadnt hit 500 words yet. This is starting to genuinely fuck with me though, i hate that I cant just get a clear look at whatever the hell it is. Sorry for this probably reading very rambly, im genuinely just typing whatever comes to mind waiting for this thing to hopefully get bored and move on. Ill be responding to comments for a little while and anyone has anything theyd like to say.
