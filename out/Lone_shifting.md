I was told by a lot of people that I’m just crazy. Even to the point of getting admitted to a mental ward last month. But I know that I’m not crazy, Leo knows that I’m not crazy, I can't be crazy. That world is different from our own. Nobody will believe me.

My name is Stefan and I am 21 years old. I’m not sure why, but this feels like it’s important to say. Up until the beginning of last year, I have had no issues with anything in my life. I was considered neurotypical, I was of average intelligence, and I was basically a golden child.

But last year, something changed. My boyfriend, Leo, brought home this new thing he found at Dollar Tree. It looked to be some sort of gift box, and I thought it was just one of his “impulse purchases” that he occasionally brings home. And I was “correct, but this time it’s really cool”, and he asked if we could open it together.

When we sat down to open it, I got a better look at the tag. I still remember exactly what it said. “Twist the bow left once, and right twice before opening, or results could be unexpected”. I tried to tell Leo about it, but he wasn’t listening to me. He opened the box and nothing happened, which we kind of expected, truth be told.

Inside the box was a singular mega stuf Oreo cookie. It seemed to be completely normal by every definition that the word “normal” could have. It looked normal, it felt normal, and it smelled normal. So we were both a bit disappointed, but we decided to flip a coin for it. I won the flip and popped the cookie in my mouth.

It did not taste normal. It was nothing like I had ever tasted. It was bad, but it’s hard to describe exactly how bad it was. But instead of spitting it out, like anyone else would’ve, I felt the urge to finish eating.

As soon as I finished the cookie, I was alone. And not the normal alone, where you can find people to stop being alone, I was completely alone. I wasn’t even in my house anymore, although where I was definitely looked similar. I looked around “my house” for any sign of Leo, but he wasn’t anywhere to be found.

Around this point is when I realized that I was alone, but I didn’t really feel like I was. Something was telling me that I was being watched by… something… Something inhuman. 

And all of a sudden, I was back in my real house, in the center of the living room. Leo was just looking at me, a petrified expression on his face. I was just confused about the whole situation, so I asked what was wrong. What he said just raised more questions than it answered.

“You just phased through 3 walls”. That’s what he said to me. Millions of things were racing through my mind, and none of them were answers. I guess we just subconsciously decided that we were both just tired and we went to sleep. The next day, we both remembered everything. We sat down at the table with the box to talk about the night prior.

After about an hour of talking, I decided to schedule an appointment to talk to my therapist about it, and Leo brought the box back to the store to question anyone who might know anything about it.

But like I said, That was last year. Things are still strange, even though I seem to be pretty good at predicting when the shifting happens. But you guys have to know that I wouldn't be writing this if something didn't happen.

I don't remember what was happening, but in the middle of yesterday, I shifted. I was thinking, " Okay, yeah this is normal for me at this point. I'll just wait a few minutes without moving until I shift back. Leo will understand."

So I waited.

And waited.

And waited.

It had been at least 15 minutes and Nothing had changed. I was still in the weird smokey gray clone of my house. This was longer than I've ever been in that area. I eventually gave up on waiting and stood up from the table that Leo and I were eating dinner at and walked around a bit. This was the first time I had actually explored "my house?"

It was completely different. There were 3 floors, and no outside world. Like I said everything was a smoky gray color, but there was one exception, a bright blue lamp on a table. It was on the third floor, in a completely empty room. I didn't touch it because it honestly scares me.

It took a full day for me to shift back to my own reality. During that time, I was completely alone, but it didn't really feel like it. There was definitely *something* else there.

I'm gonna keep a journal of the next few days in case this happens again. 

Please, someone tell me what's happening to me. I don't want to live like this anymore
