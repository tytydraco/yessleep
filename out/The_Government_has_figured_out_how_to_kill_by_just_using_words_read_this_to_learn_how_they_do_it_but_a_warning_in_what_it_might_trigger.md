Fair warning, depending on who reads the following words, you could end up murdering or killing someone. Stop reading now if you don’t want to put yourself in that position. 

I work for the government, a three-letter agency that works under another agency and funded by another department that doesn’t really exist. 

Plausible deniability is the mantra around here. 

I was recruited out of college after graduating with both psychology and a computer coding degrees. The dual majors made me attractive to the dark-colored-suit wearing types with American flag pins on their lapels. 

Lots of folks with those two degrees ended up working at this agency, there are about a fifty of us here.

In the 1960s, before I got here, my group was at the forefront of word suggestions to trigger “sleeper agents” in becoming assassins. By using an immersive hypnotic state and mind-altering drugs, my agency was able to create a number of killers. Each set into motion by reading or hearing a series of words strung together in a phrase or sentence. 

To make sure these words were never encountered by accident by “sleeper agents”, the phrases were essentially a babble sentence, something like – “Horses don’t watch naked chimps drink lemonade on Thursday nights in July.” 

There’s no chance someone ever typed those words together before I just did. You get the point. The trigger sentence was not something you’d encounter unless someone wanted to put those words together for a reason.

The ”trigger words” would then release the agent to complete their assigned task. If you’re wondering if it works, let me just put the name Lee Harvey Oswald out there.

Over the years my agency perfected the use of “trigger words”, and who could be triggered. It used to be people the agency specifically recruited and put into play. Mostly former or current members of the American military.  

One of the edicts that the agency put to us the last decade was to widen their potential pool of agents, or assassins. Now to be clear, you need to re-think the word assassin. 

I’m not just talking about the killing of world leaders, but a multitude of murders that occur each year that serve a purpose – either politically, financially or socially.

As an example, a regular Joe or Jane, kills someone, or a number of someones, and this killing falls under a certain ideology. You’ve now created a political flashpoint that can serve a purpose.

A banking executive is murdered, and it appears to be one of those, “wrong place at the wrong time” crimes. But it wasn’t. If you dig a little deeper, you’d see that the new bank boss is more amenable to certain investments than the old boss was, which furthers a larger agenda.

You read about a random Judge killed, but trust me, it wasn’t random. It never is.

Are you starting to get the picture? You, your neighbor, wife or brother could be an assassin. All of you reading this could one day be called into service to help push forward someone’s dark strategy. 

But how you ask?

That’s where my dual degrees in psychology and computer engineering come into play. The internet created a whole new population of willing agents or what we like to call “open thought” candidates. 

The way it works is we insinuate ourselves into certain internet forums, Facebook groups, Reddit groups or chat rooms. We then post certain stories with specific  subliminal messages enbeded in them. By you “liking” or “up voting” the story, we now know you are an “open thought” candidate. Someone we can readily manipulate.

More stories are posted to these sites or chats that now pinpoint your susceptibility. We’ve figured out how to place a “mission” into these stories or chats. This part of the process is known as EPOC, “Engaging a Potential Open Candidate.”

You’ll then get spam emails, miss-sent texts and calls which will reinforce the mission. They won’t seem out of the ordinary since you always get these annoying calls and emails.

The people who open these emails, read these texts and answer the calls become our prime candidates. More reinforcement will happen through a series of links to YouTube channels, Tik-Tok videos or Facebook Broadcasts which are run by us, and contain more subliminal messages. 

After about three months, of this “engaging” you are now a programmable killer.

Think about it - How many news stories on a murderer have you seen where the friends and family of the killer use the term, “They just snapped.” Or “They were always so quiet, I would have never thought they’d do something like this.”  

You’re seeing my handiwork in motion.

I guess I should be ashamed, or worse, broken down with guilt and remorse. Writing this as some sort of act of contrition, a confession and apology for the carnage and pain I have created in the world. The horrors I have wrought. The senseless killings and deaths.

But I’m not feeling guilty at all. I feel proud, and the reason I’m writing this is because I want credit for creating a program that turns ordinary Americans into cold blooded killers. 

People talk about serial killers and how many people they’ve killed, I can tell you right now that I have killed more people than the top-ten serial killers combined, and all I had to do was type some words together.

Here’s where you should stop reading. Do not go past this point.

I’m going to reveal a trigger sentence, and if you are the one person who we’ve targeted as an “open thought” candidate for this mission, you will be officially triggered and compelled to kill.

There will be no fighting it. 

Your brain will click the elements into place and as thoughtless as you go about brushing your teeth, the same will happen with you completing your murder.

Last warning. 

I can’t emphasize enough how this will possibly set you on a course that will condemn you and your family to incessant hate, financial ruin, prison and possible death depending who you’ve been assigned to dispatch.

We like to use words like dispatch.

Here is the sentence you should not read or hear – “Helpless cats often climb towers that lead to planets with waterfalls.”

You’ve been triggered.
