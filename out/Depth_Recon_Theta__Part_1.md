*Iraq, Second Tour – Deep in the Hindu Kush, Near the Pakistan Border*

The wind bit sharp through the mountain pass, dry and cold as bone. Dust kicked up in small, nervous flurries around the six of us, knelt in a tight semicircle below a jagged cliff face. The target was a gaping hole in the rock—unnatural, too round, too dark. Supposed to be just another supply tunnel. Another crawlspace for smugglers and Taliban fighters to stash weapons, meds, or bodies.

But it didn’t feel right.

I crouched low behind a boulder, scanning the mouth of the tunnel through my binoculars. My ghillie hood fluttered in the wind like a half-dead crow. Next to me, Bill—Big Bill McCrae—shifted his weight with a quiet grunt. He stood six-foot-four, with a quiet strength like a bull resting before the storm. My spotter, my best mate, and the only bastard I trusted to watch my six.

“Still nothing,” I muttered. “No heat sigs, no tripwires, not a bloody echo from that thing.”

Bill didn’t answer at first. He just stared at the tunnel, jaw flexing. Then, softly: “Don’t like it, Jack. That thing’s wrong.”

Webb, our team leader— a Staff Sergeant —cursed under his breath, tapping at the side of his radio headset. “Still waiting on orders. Can’t sit on our arses much longer.”

Then the voice came through. Sharp, unmistakable, indifferent.

“Clear for entry, team. Get in there and find out what those Tali bastards are hauling through that tunnel.” —Captain McKellen, over comms.

Everyone froze. The wind died with the voice. The tunnel yawned wider somehow, darker than before.

Bill turned to me, eyes hard. “Don’t do it, mate. Sarge—seriously. Let me go. Or send the new lads. You feel that, yeah? Feels like standing on a landmine just to look at it.”

I hesitated. This wasn’t nerves. It was instinct—deep, primal. Something about that opening wasn’t natural. Could almost hear it… a hum? A pressure behind the eyes? Training screamed one thing; brass another.

I took a breath.

“Nah,” I said quietly. “I’ll go. I’m the smallest. Less weight, better mobility. Won’t be gone long.”

Handed my L115A3 to Bill, who took it like it was a coffin lid.

“Hold perimeter. Watch the ridge lines. If I’m not out in twenty, haul arse back to FOB and tell ‘em I got swallowed by a goat demon or some shit.”

Bill caught my wrist before I stood. “Don’t joke, brother. You go in there, you come back. Got it?”

I nodded once. No guarantees.

Stripped down to essentials— Dropped the outer shell, kept the front-plate carrier tight. Drew my sidearm, a Sig and checked the action with one hand, then holstered it. Two mags. Standard loadout. Not enough if this wasn’t just a smuggler’s crawlspace.

As I approached the entrance, the air seemed colder—not just outside but within my bones. I looked back once, offered a half-grin.

“Be back in time for brekkie, lads. Don’t nick my biscuits.”

The air had shifted since we set up the perimeter. The wind had dropped almost completely, and the usual mountain sounds—the birds, the rustling leaves—had faded like they’d been cut out. We all noticed it, but no one spoke. No need.

Bill stayed tight on my six, eyes locked on the tunnel’s yawning entrance like it might shift if we blinked. I trusted him more than anyone to watch my back, but even he looked tense.

Turner broke the silence, voice low but sharp. “Feels like the mountain’s holding its breath, waiting on something.”

Nash snorted, dry as ever. “Probably stinks to high heaven in there, from all the piss and shit lining the walls, where do you think they do it? Do they have toilets in this establishment?”

I smirked. That old habit—keep the mood light when your gut’s screaming something else. Learned that quick.

“I’ll let you know if I find one” I replied.

“Oh and check if they got any playboys in there, I heard these guys are fellow connoisseurs.” said Turner, his voice fading away as I moved towards the hole, a whisper away from the edge of oblivion.

Staff Sergeant Webb checked his radio and gave the nod. “Jack, you’re up. Stay sharp. This isn’t your typical smuggler’s crawlspace. Whatever’s in there, it’s not just dirt and rats.”

I swallowed the lump in my throat and forced down the tension with a steady breath. Every muscle was wound tight, ready, but the quiet… that quiet was a weight pressing deep.

I looked back at Bill. His jaw was clenched, eyes sharp as a hawk. “In and out, mate. We’ve got you.”

He nodded toward the ridge lines where Doyle and Hargreaves were posted. Turner and Nash covered the rear. Perfect textbook setup.

Except this wasn’t textbook.

I shrugged off the loose jacket, the ghillie snagging on jagged edges. The weight of the front plate settled steady on my chest. The Sig was solid in my grip, two magazines clipped tight to my belt.

I stepped forward.

The mountain seemed to lean in, the sunlight behind me dimming—the world beyond the entrance blurring and fading.

The rocks underfoot felt brittle, like the earth itself was holding back a breath.

I paused.

And stepped inside.

Darkness. Thick and absolute.

Only sounds were the scrape of boots on gravel, muffled by shadow.

My breath was loud in my ears. The radio was dead quiet.

The mountain had claimed the light.

I counted steps slow and steady, feeling the ground beneath me. My eyes strained, adjusting to nothing.

Shadows flickered and shifted, alive in the gloom.

Something moved.

My heart thudded hard.

Not from fear—more from the unnatural stillness, like the tunnel was watching, waiting.

Then, faint as a breath, a whisper pressed at the back of my neck.

I shook it off.

“Jack, status,” Webb’s voice cut through the earpiece.

“Inside,” I whispered. “Tunnel’s clear so far. No tripwires, no movement.”

“Copy. Keep pushing. We need eyes on what’s coming through.”

I pressed deeper. The walls closed in, rough and damp. The air smelled stale—wet earth, and something else. Something wrong.

My fingers brushed slick stone.

Another whisper—this one almost like a voice—hissed from the dark.

I froze.

“Jack?”

Bill’s voice, distant but steady. “You good, Sarge?”

“Yeah,” I forced out. “Just… something’s off.”

No response. No comfort.

The shadows thickened, tightening.

I blinked.

There—in the gloom, just beyond my torch’s edge—a shape. Flickering, shifting.

I gripped the pistol tighter, breathing shallow.

“Jack, report,” Webb pressed.

I swallowed hard. “I see something. Not moving like a person. Like… a shadow.”

Static crackled, then cleared.

“Don’t engage. Pull back if you can.”

I hesitated.

Instinct screamed retreat.

But retreat wasn’t on the cards.

Because something was watching.

Waiting.

And I knew—it was just getting started.
