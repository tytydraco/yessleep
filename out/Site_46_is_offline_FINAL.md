I slowly released the [knob](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11nc12i/site_46_is_offline_part_one/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), silently praying to every God imaginable that the thing didn't hear me as I backed away from the [door](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11pw96t/site_46_is_offline_part_two/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). This, however, was when said Gods decided I was on my own this time around because the next thing I know, the fucker shoots a tendril straight through the door -- which did I mention was *raw steel?!* When I saw this, I both lost control of my bladder and gunned it in the other direction.

What was worse was that there wasn't a back door out of the Chem Labs, either. That door, the steel door that was ripped away from the frame like it was a fuckin' LEGO piece, was the only one that led in or out of the room, save, I guess, for the tanks themselves leading to the maintenance tunnels again. Backed against the rear wall, the creature stomping straight for me, with each tendril mercilessly stabbing the floor, I eyed the tanks both reluctantly, yet desperately. I obviously didn't want to have to go back into the tunnels.

For one thing, I was already beginning to see more and more of what the guy was talking about with the claustrophobia element. More than this, though, going back into the tunnels meant running the all too likely risk of getting lost again, after finally managing to get lucky enough to stumble so close to where I needed to go. *I'm right here, and I can't even cross the finish line. Out-fucking-standing.*

The creature was right on top of me, only inches away from where I stood. It could've snatched me with one tentacle and it wouldn't have even had to reach its full extension to do so. So, knowing I was only seconds away from death (or worse), reflexes kicked in and I dove headfirst to the right of it right as it shot a tentacle that would've probably gorred me straight through the chest, had it connected. I managed to dodge its first strike and was surprisingly quick to recover to my feet and start running again. Unfortunately, this burst of luck also ran out almost immediately when another shot from a tentacle slashed my right ankle, sending me flying forward on my face from the momentum.

My vision exploded into clouds and stars and I knew right off the bat that my nose was busted all to shit, feeling the blood just flooding from it. My leg though was what hurt worst of all with how bad it was stinging. Imagine you were slashed with a shard of glass, right; then had a bunch of fire ants crawl into the gaping wound and just start biting the absolute shit out of you from inside your leg. That's what it felt like; a crawling, progressing pain.

This thing was relentless, too, wasting no time in wrapping another of its inky, slimy tendrils around my aching ankle and hurling me like the featherweight I apparently was to it back into the far wall. That time, I felt a couple bones crack like a glowstick on impact. The thing came stomping for me to finish me.

You know how when you're about to die, your adrenaline will kick in, even if there's no strength left in your body? You're right there, right on the Grim Reaper's doorstep and your hand's about to ring the doorbell, cause that's all you really *can* do at this point, only to then somehow find it in you to say "No, to Hell with this, I'm not going out like this, not yet"? An innate, primal part of you that keeps fighting, long after you have been battered beyond the point of weakness. "Survival instinct", to put it bluntly I guess. Whatever you call it, *that* kicked in maximum overdrive because the next thing I knew, I was dodging two simultaneous tendril strikes like I'd just taken the red pill before bolting once again for the exit.

My leg was on fire, but I couldn't have cared less. Actually, believe it or not, the pain barely registered to me at all above that of a little papercut. Nor did the thought that I might now be infected really cross my mind; not yet anyways. No, right then, none of that shit mattered worth a damn to me. All that mattered was getting the hell out of the Chem Labs and making it to the main office to turn the signal back on and get us out of this place.

Well, in that vein, I managed to make the next room and slam the door right in the creature's face, even managing to see the dent left in the door from the impact it made -- which I'll proudly admit made me smile a bit to see. Immediately after, though, the adrenaline that'd kept me going right up to that point decided my time was up and I was back to limping, barely even holding my ass upright at all. Thankfully, though, it appeared, for the moment that I could see at least, that it was the only one and from there, I knew it'd only be one more right turn down the hallway in front of me and it was a straight shot to the main office.

The challenge then was managing to get there without A, passing out before I could even make the damn bend, and/or B, mutating, thanks to the scuffle two seconds ago. I looked at my leg. The cut was diagonal, running the length of my ankle and I could see that, despite it being a quick strike, it was a deep cut, severing several layers of flesh. It ached and burned like nothing I could've even imagined before and I could even see a bright reddish pink ring forming around its circumference. Oddly, and alarmingly, it wasn't bleeding in spite of all of this.

*Fuck, that can ONLY mean the damn thing's inside me!* I began to imagine what was going to happen to me when and how the thing would awaken inside my body. Where would the tentacles come out from, huh? My back? My stomach, or maybe from out of my mouth like the one from earlier in the tunnels? I wondered if any part of me would still be conscious enough to even think while I was like that. What would I be feeling, if anything? I'll say right now that this thought has continuously given me fucking nightmares, particularly when applied to the others that *had* mutated and what *they* were possibly feeling.

*Get a grip, Rod.* I sighed and refocused. I couldn't lose my shit now. I had to keep going if there was any chance of getting out of this situation alive. Not only that, but if *any* of us were going to get out of here alive, I had to keep going. *Just... Get... To... The... Bend...*

My legs felt weaker and weaker with each step I took. Any second now, I was bound to fall on my face again and it wasn't likely I'd be getting back up again. Leastways not with *MY* legs, if you take my meaning. I managed to make it to the bend, where my knees buckled and I was forced to stop again and hold onto the wall for a moment to reorient myself. *Come on, not now... Not now...*

The main office was dead ahead. Hell, I could even see the goddamn control panel. I just had to get there, find the signal switch, get it up and running, and then I could activate the "Lockdown Line". I was so fucking close, I couldn't fuck it up here. Holding my breath, I began stumbling my way across the hallway toward the office, holding myself up along the wall. Each step saw more and more of my breath get stripped from me.

I want to say I was halfway down the hallway when my vision blurred out completely. Everything was just one giant fuzz cloud to me. I still kept going.

The air got heavier and heavier. I couldn't see and my lungs were filled with what I would've swore were bricks of lead. My arms and legs, both, were so weak. I still kept going.

My chest started to feel like something was stabbing it from the inside. Then it moved from my stomach to my back, trying to push out from there. I still kept going.

I struggled to keep my mouth closed when I felt the pressure worm up from my stomach and through my throat. *No, goddamn it! I can't lose out now! Have to get to the control panel... Have... To... Get...*

I stopped then when I felt the control panel. I was there. I'd made it.

*But I can't see a damn thing!*

I started feeling around the panel. The knobs, maybe buttons, all felt the exact same; round and with no real distinction. *Damn it, which one's the one for the signal?!*

Weakness took ahold of me fully and my legs finally gave out. I collapsed to the floor, where any remaining strength I had was all but used up in simply trying to hold myself together while my insides turned every which way, trying to burst out of me. Whatever this thing, this "Specimen X-12", was, was twisting my digestive tract like it was a balloon animal while simultaneously hammering the hell out of my rib cage. It was agonizing. I wasn't going to be able to hold on much longer, whether I wanted to or not.

*Can't let go...* I remember trying to reach back up to the control panel, trying to actually pick myself back up, only to have to retract in pain again from a spasm coming from directly in the center of my chest. *I can't do it. I'm not going to make it!*

The world was fading away from me. Feeling throughout my body was ebbing slowly away from me, piece by piece. My ears, which had already been reduced to little more than a slight ringing noise, now faded away too. "Specimen X-12" had me completely. In seconds -- Hell, *IF* even *that* \-- I'd be another one if these freaks crawling the facility, forever lost to life.

Then, with what hearing ability I had left, I heard it. A static buzz from the walkie rang from my pocket. I'll say right now that I was actually, deep down at least, shocked the damn thing was even operational after having to tread water like I did earlier. But what did that matter then, right? The damn thing worked and now, I *might* have *some* chance at calling for help again.

*There's still a chance to make it out of this!*

I wriggled the walkie out of my pocket; no easy thing to do when all of your joints and muscles are too focused on trying to keep an angry lifeform from bursting out of your body. Trying to hold onto it wasn't easy, either, but still, I managed to do it while holding the button down. "D-D-Daaah..." My words cut off, feeling the pressure rising in my throat again.

*"Holy smokes, Rod, you're alive! Thank God! Listen man, it's all gone to Hell. Those things got in the bunker. I got out, but everyone else's gone. They've been turned into one of 'em."*

He sounded winded as he spoke, and I could hear his footfalls pounding against the floor. *"Please tell me you've managed to make to the office and get the signal back online."* I mashed the button again. My mouth opened and a knot instantly tightened inside my throat. It was the feeling you get when you bite off more from a sandwich than you can chew at one time, and so the biggest part of it get's stuck; "indigestion", I guess, only throwing it back up, in my case, wasn't an option. I *had* to keep it down and inside.

"D-Daaaniel..." I groaned.

*"Rod, can you hear me? You still there, buddy?"*

"Daaniel... I'm in oooffice..."

*"Huh? You're where?"*

"Oooffice..." I hacked a wheezing cough after feeling the thing slug the shit out of my ribs again.

*"Rod, I can't hear a damn word you're saying, what's going on? Have you made it to the office yet?"*

My finger was shaking, about to slip away completely from the talk button. Pressure rose in my throat, far bigger this time. *Shit, no, not now!*

*"Rod, damn it, speak to--"* He trailed off, and I could hear the sounds of something clanking in the background. *Fuck, they've found him!*

As quick as I could, I mashed the talk button and screamed, "I'M IN THE OFFICE, HURRY!" Then the walkie dropped from my hands. From that moment forward, the only thing I could do with my body was to clutch my stomach and writhe in absolute agony. The "Specimen X-12" inside me was pissed off now, I could feel it from the way that the damn thing was slamming itself around both the front and back of me.

I couldn't see, couldn't hear, and I just barely had the ability to feel the ground beneath me. This was it. I'd made it this far, but now I was done for. The only hope I had now was that I'd hold out long enough so that when/if Daniel showed up, he'd be able to get the signal back and initiate the "Lockdown Line". He was the only hope now.

Because of my impairments, I lost track of how long it was, but I could remember feeling rough hands shaking me. I knew it had to be Daniel. He'd made it, and though I couldn't hear him, I could imagine him shouting, *"Rod! Rod, you okay, speak to me, man!"* I wanted to shout back at him, beg him to forget about me and hit the damn button, but I couldn't. My body was locked up tight; miraculously still held together, in spite of how bad a small part of me kind of wanted the pain to just end by letting the fucker out. I didn't though. I couldn't.

I guess whatever my face looked like to him must've screamed this message loud enough for me anyways because the next thing I knew, I could feel him release me, hopefully to turn his attention to the control panel.I couldn't see, couldn't hear, and I just barely had the ability to feel the ground beneath me.

There was nothing; nothing I could see, feel, hear, *taste*\-- nothing. I was gone. At least, that was what I kind of hoped for. Better than the alternative in this case.

With what happened next, I'm honestly not entirely sure. I don't know just how long I was gone. Being perfectly honest, I seriously thought I'd mutated already and that I was one of the creatures. I was still somewhat conscious, able to form thoughts inside my head and all, but that didn't necessarily mean I hadn't changed yet. Who was to say the others had actually died completely while infected?

Then however it happened; I actually woke up. When I did, I was greeted by blinding fluorescents, accompanied by the steady rhythm of an E.K.G. monitor. I could hear indistinct muttering around me, but was unable to understand any of it or see who was speaking because neither my vision nor hearing had readjusted yet. It was hours before I could see, hear, or feel again.

As I'd figured, I was in a hospital room similar to the medical treatment rooms back on Site 46, with the exception being that this particular area was far bigger and far more sterile looking than those back on the site. I remember shooting up in my bed, wondering what the hell happened to Daniel, only to have Daniel himself put his hand to my chest, saying, "Whoa, whoa there, "Bandit", we lost 'em."

I sat there, staring at him, almost hyperventilating for a solid two minutes at least before starting to relax again. "It's okay, pal, we made it, we're in the ICU ward at the hospital now."

"Wha-What happened?" I asked, still a bit winded.

"Well," he said, chuckling dryly, "Where to start..." He went on to tell me again that, at some point while I was gone, the quarantine area became compromised. When I asked how they could've gotten in, he told me something that not only sent my heart right back into a frenzy, but also confirmed my fears from earlier; that those things knew how to wait inside of people until the right time came. Apparently, in his case, lets just say the maintenance guy knew a hell of a lot more than he let on about "Them creatures we was talkin' about".

"I tried calling for you several times over the radio." he concluded.

"So did I." I replied. "It must've been the tunnels, they must've skewed the range of the signal."

"Maybe." He sighed and then added with another dry chuckle, "But we made it, didn't we?"

I sighed and replied, "Yeah... Yeah, I guess we did, didn't we?"

"How'd you get out of there, anyway? I mean, how'd you make it back into the main level?" I opened my mouth, and then paused. I truthfully knew neither how to explain, nor how to know he could be trusted. I know, I know, how could I *not* trust him, right? After all, I'd have been utterly fucked without him, plus he was the only one who'd been on top of the situation since it began. Even still, though, I knew what what I'd seen wasn't meant to be seen by anyone except the eggheads themselves that bred the damn things in the first place.

Obviously, I wasn't meaning to try and keep it all a secret forever, but at the same time, there and then were neither the right place or time for it. So instead, I told him I got lucky -- which wasn't even that much of a lie anyways. "Well, you almost *weren't* "Lucky." he remarked.

"Huh?" I asked.

"I thought for sure I'd lost you, too, Rod. The way you was rolling on the ground there, I thought you were about to go crazy on me, too."

"Oh, yeah..." I sighed. "Yeah, no, I almost did..." Then another thought struck me and I shot up again, feeling across my abdomen.

He smiled and said, "Easy there, bud, you're gonna be fine, Docs managed to get it out of ya." To this, I simply breathed a sigh of relief. I was going to be okay. Daniel even patted me on the shoulder and joked, "Ol' Iron Rod does it again. Neither crates nor critters can take him down!" I laughed at this. Good old "Steel Jockey Humor" at it's finest.

I remember spending the rest of that day in the hospital. I was discharged with a clean bill of health early the following morning. That same morning, I remember reading an email from the Monolith officials that more or less said that Site 46 was being shut down until further notice. In that email as well was a worker's comp form that dictated that I would be receiving $40,000 a month, about my average salary by the way, for at least the next 12 to 18 months or until it was determined that Site 46 would be opened again for me and/or who the hell ever else was left to come back to work.

*Right, like anyone would be willing to come back after that.*

God knows I never wanted to go back. In that vein then, I suppose this is somewhat a blessing in disguise, isn't it? If only it didn't come at the cost of so many people; innocent lives, just being sideswiped, forgotten. Call the incident whatever the hell they want, *I* was there goddamn it! *I* saw what happened to people just because they wanted to create some "magic cure" or whatever. *I* saw what happened to good men and women just so a bunch of jackoffs in lab coats could play hero. Not only that, but I have the documents still to prove it.

I'm ending this here. I've said my piece and I've told you all everything. Now I have to lay low for a while in case one of the officials see this. I will say that since then, in preparation for the time where I open their little Pandora's box to the world, I have changed both my name and address. I've lost contact with Daniel and anyone else I used to know as well. Now you know, and now maybe I can sleep a little easier, knowing that I won't ever have to hear those words again...
