I can still hear the echo of my scream as the hospital room fades into nothingness. The searing pain that racked my body dissolves into an oppressive cold. When I open my eyes, I’m no longer in my hospital bed but in a nightmarish realm that defies all comprehension—hell.

The landscape stretches out in a grotesque tableau of suffering. Shadows writhe and scream, their agony forming a symphony of despair. The air is thick with the stench of sulfur and decay. The ground beneath me is cracked, bleeding molten fire that twists and churns with a malevolent force. I know this place instantly—it's the very essence of eternal torment.

Figures are ensnared in a river of lava nearby, their cries mingling with the cruel laughter of demons who prowl among them. One demon, however, stands apart from the others. Tall and menacing, its eyes burn with a predatory fire. It locks its gaze onto me with a cold, unrelenting intensity.

Panic seizes me as I realize it’s not interested in the suffering souls around us but in me. My legs feel as though they are cemented to the ground, immobilized by an invisible force. The demon’s gaze pierces through me, and as it reaches out, I feel a searing agony that brands me with a pain that is both physical and spiritual.

In an instant, everything shifts. The oppressive heat, the ceaseless screams—all vanish. I’m back in the hospital, gasping for breath, my heart pounding with an intensity that threatens to overwhelm me. Nurses and doctors hover around me, their faces a mixture of shock and desperate relief.

"You were gone for a moment," one doctor says, wiping sweat from his brow. "We thought we lost you."

But the memory of hell clings to me, an inescapable shadow. As the days drag on, I try to convince myself it was a fevered hallucination, a trick of my fevered mind. Yet the mark on my arm—a livid, crimson stain—refuses to fade, a constant reminder of my descent into that abyss.

Strange things begin to happen. Shadows twist and shift unnaturally, whispers slither through empty spaces, and every glimmer of light seems to harbor the demon’s malevolent gaze. The sensation of being watched is a constant, gnawing dread that refuses to let go.

One night, as I lie in bed, the temperature plummets, and the air grows heavy with the familiar stench of sulfur. I turn my head slowly, dread pooling in my stomach, and there it is—the demon, standing at the foot of my bed. Its eyes burn with a cold, malevolent satisfaction.

I try to scream, but my voice is strangled in my throat. The demon’s presence is a suffocating force, a dark weight pressing down on me. I close my eyes, praying for the nightmare to end.

When I open them again, the room has transformed. The sterile hospital room has twisted into a grotesque parody of itself. The walls pulse with an unsettling rhythm, and the shadows that once lingered in corners now slither openly, merging with the eerie light of the flickering overhead bulbs.

The door to the room creaks open, revealing a corridor that seems to stretch infinitely, vanishing into a thick, swirling mist. I hear faint, distorted whispers echoing down the hall, their origins hidden in the shifting fog. The air is cold and stagnant, carrying with it the stench of sulfur.

A chill runs through me as I realize the room is shrinking, the walls closing in slowly, as if compressing me into the darkness. The temperature drops further, and the whispers grow louder, mingling with my own ragged breaths. The marks on my arm throb in unison with the pulsing walls, as if the room itself is reacting to the pain I endured.

The demon's eyes flash before me once more, this time not from the foot of my bed but from the deepening shadows, its gaze following me as the room contracts. The familiar sense of dread returns, accompanied by a new, unnerving sensation: the room is alive, its very structure infused with an intelligence that seems to feed off my fear.

As the walls close in tighter, I feel the pressure intensify, squeezing me into the center of this unnatural chamber. The whispers crescendo into a deafening roar, and just when it seems the darkness will consume me entirely, the lights flicker out completely.

In the pitch-black void, I hear the faintest sound—the unmistakable sound of a door closing, muffled and distant. The last thing I see before the darkness overtakes me is a fleeting glimpse of the demon’s eyes, now faintly glowing in the blackness, watching me as I am enveloped in the eerie silence.

The darkness is profound and absolute. In the absolute void, I am left with a chilling uncertainty. Am I trapped in this distorted reality forever? Is this hell merely a beginning, with the real torment yet to come? The final thought that lingers as consciousness slips away is a haunting one: the nightmare may have only just begun, and the future is a terrifying, unknowable abyss.

Abruptly, the darkness shatters. I am jolted awake, back in the hospital, surrounded by concerned faces. My heart pounds, and I gasp for breath as if emerging from an underwater nightmare. The room is sterile and familiar, but the mark on my arm still burns with an unsettling heat.

A nurse approaches, her face calm but with an edge of concern. "You were out for a moment," she says softly. "We almost lost you."

As the hospital room settles back into its mundane reality, I try to reassure myself that it was all just a haunting dream. But as I glance around, the familiar surroundings now seem strangely foreboding. The whispers I thought I heard are now silent, yet the echoes of the demon’s eyes haunt my vision.

I attempt to relax, but the oppressive sense of dread remains, a gnawing anxiety that refuses to fade. As I lie back, trying to calm my racing heart, I realize with growing terror that the cycle might not be over. The fear that the nightmare could begin anew lingers ominously, leaving me trapped in a chilling, endless loop of uncertainty.

It’s been weeks since I woke up in the hospital, and despite my best efforts to resume a normal life, the shadows of that nightmarish realm still haunt me. But as I write this, a new, unsettling event has occurred. While trying to put my thoughts in order, I noticed a subtle but unmistakable shift in my apartment’s atmosphere. The familiar, oppressive cold has returned, and the whispers are now louder, more insistent. The shadows in my room seem to have grown darker, more defined, as if they’re waiting for something.

The final straw came just moments ago. I went to check the lock on my door—something I’ve done a hundred times before—and found it ajar, though I’m certain I locked it. The hallway outside was empty, but I noticed a faint, acrid scent of sulfur lingering in the air, stronger than ever.

As I sit here, the cold draft grows more intense, and the whispers have become almost deafening. I feel a pressure, an overwhelming sense of something—or someone—drawing closer. My heart races, and every shadow seems to pulse with an unsettling energy. 

I’m paralyzed with fear, every movement out of the corners of my eyes fill me with dread. I need to know I am not going insane.. I need to know people out there can see this post.. I need to know I am not going to wake up back in that hospital room again.
