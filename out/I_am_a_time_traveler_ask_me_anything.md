Greetings,  
  
I'm not entirely sure how to say any of this. I know that it's likely no one will ever believe me. It wouldn't be the first time. But, we've done this before. Slightly different each time, with how my actions have consistently changed what will happen. But you know the expression; it's hard to predict anything, especially the future. Well, except for a completely expected outcome. History doesn't repeat, not even across different timelines, but it always rhymes.  
  
I guess you've heard about the recent Hamas attack in Israel and the subsequent bombing of Gaza. So many innocent lives lost. But, I can assure you that that is just the tip of the iceberg. The truth is that there is something else at play right now. And I'm guessing you'll figure that out in the coming months. Truly, the nightmare is coming.  
  
As stated before, this isn't the first time we've done this. At this point... maybe around 1200 times? Every time a similar pattern repeats. Global economic turmoil, the rise of authoritarianism, a genocide in the middle east, civil war in the United States, WW3, and finally, a nuclear exchange. As previously stated, these things never happen the same way, but the fact that they happen is a constant. The signs of the genocide portion is already starting to show. I can't tell if it will be the Palestinians this time or the Israelis by Iranian hands. Whatever the case, the next step is pretty black and white. There will be a civil war in the United States. There always is. The civil war will last until 2032 by my best estimation, but will be interrupted by WW3. And in 2036, total nuclear war.  
  
Yes, I am from the future. Or rather, a version of it. In my timeline, all these things came to pass by 2015 under the Trundle administration after President McCain was assassinated during a press conference in Egypt. The one the current president was slated to attend for Gaza asylum seekers. Had he attended, I wouldn't be talking to you right now. And who knows? I may have to undo something else tomorrow and none of this will have mattered. But what I do know is, telling you about this is the only way you got motivated to create the machine I rely on to move through time.  
  
It's kind of funny in a way. Part of this mission is to leave this message. You'd think I would have a template all made up by now. But things change so often that having a template is pointless. I'd just end up correcting all the information anyway. But I digress, I've never actually met you or learned your name. However, the fact you're reading this means I am in effect, participating in the temporal causality of my being in this situation. I dread to think about what happens if I simply stopped.  
  
Well, I do know, actually... Our last hope will be gone.  
  
If you have any questions, I'll do by best to answer them. Hopefully you're one of the people I respond to.  
  
Thank you,
