I don’t remember how long ago or exactly how old I was when this happened but I remember the moment clear as day. When I was younger living with my parents, every time my dad went on a work related trip me and my little sister would always sleep with my mom in my mom and dad’s bed. Before this experience I knew what a sleep paralysis was but never had one before and never had a full one since. 

I was sleeping in the middle with my mom to the left and my little sister on the right when I woke up. The lay out of the bed room was this big bed up against the wall but it didn’t touch the walls on either sides. And down to the left near your feet’s was the door in to the room. When I woke up I could look around but I couldn’t move. I could hear birds chirping outside as little night light shined through the window. As I looked around not knowing what was happening I looked over at the door. It all looked normal except the door had a plastic dog hatch on it. This door didn’t have a dog hatch nor did any of the doors in the house. As I looked at this dog hatch for what felt like minutes everything outside went quiet. I could see the little light that was coming through the hatch going dark. Then a long arm slowly comes in through the hatch. Then I could see a “person” crawling in through the hatch and disappearing at the end of the bed. That’s when my heart started to really pound. Then I see a head pop up with the rest of a tall body close to my feet. This extremely tall, pale and demonic looking woman stands up at the end of the bed with her head bending to the side so her head wouldn’t touch the ceiling. She only had on a white tank top with this kind of black ash coming off her body. 

I have never been so scared in my entire life and genuinely felt like I was gonna have a heart attack. I struggled to breathe when I noticed to the little I could see to my right another normal looking woman sitting on a chair in the corner looking at me. She had this very traditional Swedish clothing on her with flowers in her hair. She said in a very calm voice “Det är okej” meaning everything is alright in Swedish. I looked back at the tall woman at my feet when she started making her way on to the bed. She put her long arms next to my shoulders and I heard the bed springs expanding from her weight. Then her whole body came up on the bed and she was standing on all fours over me.

I was to scared to look her in the eyes and I’m glad I didn’t because if I saw her face I think I never would have been able to sleep again. So I just looked down at my feet with my heart beating fast. Her face was just centimeters from mine, breathing on me making this kind of the grudge type noises. Then I heard the springs of the bed starting to crack as she sunk into the bed on my sisters side whispering in my ear “Jag är alltid med dig” meaning I’m always with you. I just laid there staring at my feet absolutely scared to death not being able to move even when it was over. I couldn’t bring myself to turn to the right to see if the woman was still there. I couldn’t bring my self to wake up my mom, scared that the woman was still there and would hear me talking. I managed to turn my head to the left to see if my mom was there but I was so traumatized that I thought my mom was this woman that was standing over me so I turned my head slowly back to looking up at the ceiling. 

I have no idea how long I was awake after that but it felt like hours. I have never been that scared since in my entire life. I think that sleep paralysis is some kind of demonic event and not just your brain pulling a dick move on you. And if that really is true I don’t want to imagine what the words they told me really meant
