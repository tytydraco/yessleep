One night I was sleeping. In the dream I was in an unknown place, it was a typical place in my country, full of green mountains but it was night and in the distance you could see the cars stopping behind the mountains. Everything was silent. I and my family were camping in a cabin. Out of nowhere, my aunt had said to me with a serious face: "last night I saved you from a witch."

Right after that I woke up sweaty. I was head up, I turned my head and the door was open, and in the living room was my cousin watching television. I was alone in my room. I didn't even stop to think because I still hadn't moved any limbs of my body, only my head. But my mind decided not to give that much importance.

I lay there on my bed on my back, with a blank stare thinking about how weird that dream was. After saying that sentence, I felt as if my body was fading, as if I had fallen asleep but a part of my mind had remained awake and my eyes were also open.

I felt a small shiver run through my body, running through every part of my body from top to bottom. A very high-pitched but low sound began to sound, but every second it became louder, it is the same thing you hear when you cover your ears. I could only look at a completely random spot on the wall and I couldn't look away from there.

That high-pitched sound became much louder and was already becoming unbearable. My vision began to distort, my heart beat faster and faster although I was not afraid because that part of my mind was asleep, I only saw and felt what was happening with an empty gaze. The sound became so loud that it began to sound distorted, like a damaged speaker.

Then I began to feel as if a mysterious force was trying to take my soul. Again a chill, now bigger, ran through my body from head to toe, my heart beating faster than ever. Then I remembered that this can't be real, so I used the eye-up technique, that always worked to wake me up from dreams.

However, the only thing I managed to do was make the visual effect and the high-pitched sound decrease a little, so I decided to make it harder, but the same thing happened, it just decreased the sound. Once again a chill ran through my body and stayed there for a few seconds and that made me more afraid.

I felt like I was fighting death to not die, I believed that thing was trying to kill me. But after trying so much I finally managed to wake up. I was exhausted, I didn't know what the hell had just happened. I was still sleepy but it was more than obvious that I was not going to go back to sleep.

When I left my room, I felt that the whole house was different, I felt that something had changed and that I was disoriented. I went outside and I didn't recognize almost anything, I tried to see what had changed but I couldn't. When I came back into the house, after washing my face, my cat appeared and I got scared. And when I left the bathroom after going to pee, my cat appeared again and I got scared again. My nerves were upset, it was the second time it had happened to me.

Now I live in fear that it will happen to me again at some point.
