Let me start off by saying this post is real, this isn't made up. I didn't know where else I could share this story to, so I decided to post it here because I know this subreddit is where you post weird creepy shit.  
  
 So, to set the scene, me and my friends were 10-12 when this all happened. One of my friends, we'll call him Leon, told us about a weird campsite in the woods. Apparently there were claw marks on the trees there and it was really creepy, so we went out to find it. Leon didn't remember exactly where it was, but eventually after maybe 30 minutes of walking we found it. Obviously, Leon was making shit up and there weren't any claw marks on the trees, but it was still really creepy. There were DVD's everywhere but no DVD player, a shopping cart, a mattress, and a weird bag that smelled horrible. (No, it wasn't a corpse) And eventually we heard footsteps around us when we were all standing still. We heard a couple more, and I knew it wasn't my friends pranking us since I couldn't see their feet move around at all. We were already creeped out enough so we ran out and started climbing up a steep hill to get back to the city. I looked back at the campsite and saw a pair of boots that were not there before. I yelled at my friends something along the lines of "GUYS GO FASTER" and when we got to the surface, I told them about what I saw. We decided to tell our other friend about this, we'll call him Theo, and we decided to go back in a couple days.  
  
 The next thing we saw at the campsite terrified me to my core. We walked into the woods at around 4-5 PM, but because it was Winter, it got dark really fast, and it took an hour to get to the campsite, so by the time we arrived it was 6 PM and already dark out. It felt like the campsite was in a different place for some reason this time, but we found the campsite eventually. Probably just bad finding skills on our part. After looking through it, we found bottles around the area for some reason that weren't there before. Besides that, we didn't really find anything, so we decided to leave. That's when I looked behind me and swear I saw a shadow dash past the bushes. I yelled out "WE NEED TO LEAVE NOW" And so we ran up the hill again. My friend grabbed a flashlight out of my pocket and as a joke, started looking through the forest, yelling something that I don't remember. We looked at a tree next to the campsite and saw the outline of a person staring at us, unresponsive to us noticing him. None of us could make out any details, since as I said, we could only see his outline behind the tree, and we were already shitting our pants so we ran as fast as we could out of those woods. 

The second to last story I will tell is one where we went to the campsite in the morning, instead of at night. There's not much to say for this one, so I'll just jot down some things we heard/saw:  
A guy singing  
Footsteps running and walking around  
The thing I saw though was when I was throwing bottles at rocks, 3 to be exact and once I reached for the third one, it was gone. I looked behind the tree stump that was holding the bottles, and then I heard the sound of glass crashing. I shouted to my friends to "Fucking run!" as I ran to the hill again and we climbed out of there. Also, I forgot to mention we brought another one of our friends with us that time.

The finale story is what made us never go back.  
This was like 5-6 months after the events I just listed. It was probably 6 PM when we walked in, and it started raining halfway on our way to the campsite. Wanting to record what happened this time, I pulled out my phone and recorded the entire journey on our way to the campsite. (I lost the videos to time since this happened a somewhat long time ago) Nothing really happened most of the trip, besides a putrid smell that was in the air the entire time and us slipping a lot. But once we got to the campsite, we were so shocked for like 3 minutes we just stared at the thing we saw. We saw a deer with its head cut off, its body skinned, and the skin lying on a stump. You might be thinking "It was a wolf or wildlife" The only animals that live in that forest are deer. And it's not like we've never seen a dead deer before, we saw them quite a lot, but they were all either fully skeletons or intact, just dead. Nothing in the forest could have done this to a deer. Anyway, we screamed as loud as we could and sprinted all the way back to our house, and on our way to Theo's house, I swear I saw the outline of a man in the woods staring at us. Cliche, I know, but I swear I saw it. But yeah, that's about it. We were all way too scared to go there again, and I don't even know why we went again after what we saw the first 2 times.
