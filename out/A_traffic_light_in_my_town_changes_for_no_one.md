Growing up in the rural Midwest, it wasn’t uncommon to stumble across a traffic light that had lost power after a recent storm. Usually those lights got fixed or reset by the next day. But anyone who lives in the Midwest will tell you that they’ve seen some odd shit. I had a friend once describe multiple occurrences of “orbs of light,” just floating off in the distance, darting around and chasing cars. Of course I didn’t believe him, but I couldn’t help but wonder.

I remember that night like it was yesterday. I was driving back from the airport after a delayed flight that had me getting home around 1:00 AM. Hardly ideal. I was nearing my neighborhood when I rolled up to a set of traffic lights blinking yellow. Nothing out of the ordinary. Except as I was pressing the accelerator to drive off, my car suddenly stopped—like the brake pedal had slammed itself to the floor. The few lamps lining the road flickered, then shut off.

Pitch black.

I tried the engine again. Nothing. My headlights. Nothing. None of the electronics in my car were functioning. I fiddled with the knobs on my dashboard in vain. Still nothing.
A faint mist had begun to settle in. I only noticed when my windshield started to fog. I wiped at it out of instinct, but the fog was thicker than it should’ve been—like it was pushing in from outside. Unable to see, I exited the vehicle to investigate further.
The silence was so complete, it felt like I’d been swallowed whole. Not even the insects chirped. Just a dead, waiting quiet. That’s when I realized the traffic lights had **shut off.**

I froze.

Fear overtook my body—like a wave of subsonic terror had engulfed everything within a hundred-foot radius of the intersection. Like something had sunk its claws into the atmosphere.

I was alone.

There was nothing I could do. I couldn’t call anyone. I couldn’t drive. All I could do was maybe walk. After all, I was only a half mile or so from my house.
With exhaustion settling in, I figured I’d try restarting the car instead. I didn’t get a chance.

The intersection was suddenly illuminated by a shade of deep jade. Not the green of a regular signal—darker, too vivid, like molten glass. The lights running horizontal to me pierced the sky, their beams slicing through the fog like it wasn’t even there.

**Something had triggered the light.**

Not wanting to stick around and find out what, I sought shelter in my car. I didn’t dare touch the keys. I crouched behind the driver’s seat. It started as a low hum. Faint—like metal vibrating under tension.

It got louder.

Closer.

I couldn’t tell what it was.

Louder still.

It became more defined.

Every muscle in my body tensed, as if the noise contorted me—like it had fingers and knew exactly where to twist.

A scream hurtled toward the intersection.

It wasn’t human. Rusted metal dragged across a sharp blade. Grinding. *Shrieking.*

I shut my eyes and kept them clenched. Even with my hands over my ears, the noise was still deafening. The car shook. My keys rattled in the lifeless ignition chamber. The metal of the door creaked like something outside was pressing into it. 

It got louder and louder until—after what seemed like hours—it stopped.

I opened my eyes to a pale flashing illuminating the rear seats. I stepped out of the car. The lights had returned to what they were: flashing yellow; yield.

The mist had settled, making the road ahead visible. The lamps were dim once again. I reached for the door to my car. I got in and turned the keys.

Still nothing.

I began the walk home in the dark, silently contemplating what had just occurred. The road behind me remained empty. No cars. No wind. Only the wet crunch of my shoes in the gravel shoulder.

I returned the next morning to a chilling sight: my car sat in the middle of the road, lifeless—*not* at an intersection. There was no trace of traffic lights. No parallel road.

Just a car with an empty tank of gas.
