Good evening, all. Listen closely because this is the only context I will ever give--my job is at stake and this patient isn't worth losing my source of income. I work at a psych ward and not the good kind; real shady shit. We shift halls every other week and this week I met a real interesting lady. Obviously I am changing her name in case any of you lab coat fuckers are reading this on your lunch break, but she was nice and we struck a deal; I transcribe and post her diary so it's not lost, and she helps another patient get out...I can't do it without losing my job and even then I couldn't guarantee this patient's escape. I said it was shady and Sara--the name I will use for the patient I took the bribe with--has a better shot. I am just transcribing the words on the page, only changes I will be making is names of the patients. The doctors and actual facility deserves to be exposed. Now, I just got off work and I am already crashing so I will start on the first and only note for this cycle: 

February 14, 2025 - About my first day at the Arch Clinic

I am not well. Obviously. I am writing this from an insane asylum but that's not what I mean. Yeah, mentally, I wasn't doing great, but I need you to know  I was perfectly sane. The only mental disorder or condition I have ever been diagnosed or suspected of has been depression and that's the reason I am in here if you know what I mean. I am not insane. I know what I saw. 

I got in here six days ago and for the first few house, it was fine. Normal orientation stuff; they check you over for open wounds, make you strip down and change, take your shit, and put you on meds they think might fix you. I was put on a low sedative which still took me out for a couple of hours. I get tired fast and whatever the opposite of insomnia is, I probably have.  When I woke up however, there was a man in the doorway of my room. I shared it with another girl but the wards are not co-ed so it had to be a doctor or a nurse. The man was smiling and wearing a dark green casimire sweater. All the other doctors were in coats and all nurses wore scrubs. I asked who he was but he didn't answer immediately. With his entry into my room, he brought the scent of coffee and tarmac. I couldn't leave because he was in the doorway. Couldn't call for help because his out of place outfit made it seem like he had authority to wear what he wanted. All I could is sit in the corner and tense my body, preparing for every girl's worse fear. In his eyes was something else however. Instead of lust, he looked at me the same way an old grandmaster would look at a chessboard. He analyzed my every move in an instant it seemed, taking great pleasure in something he had done to so many before me. A shiver ran down my spine as from that point on, I felt the devil was standing in front of me. He shot me a smile and briskly walked towards me.   
"Good morning, Ms. Sara Bridger. How are you this fine evening?" His voice was deep and gravely, but not grating. He reached out his hand and as if I didn't have control over my own body, my hand met his in a handshake. His hands were callused and the handshake he gave me was cold and gone of any kind of life. 

"Who are you." I said, trying my hardest to seem in control of the situation.

"I am the head doctor here, and I will be helping with your recovery and re-entry into life." He said warmly. "You can call me Dr. Wool." 

Dr. Wool released my hand from his grip and quickly walked over to the sink in my room, scrubbing his hands vigorously before drenching in scorching water. As he walked his hands, he spoke.  
"I have heard so much about you Ms. Bridger. Is it true that you like to read?" 

"Who told you that? I haven't spoken to anyone yet." This was a lie, I had, but not about reading and I was also not about to let him interrogate me. 

The doctor completely ignored my question and instead asked another of his. "What's your favorite book?"

Seeing that I wasn't getting anywhere I stopped talking and just stared at him. He wore silver, circular glasses that seemed to not stay fully on the bridge of his nose. A deep but healed over scar distracted from his face however, and lead the eye to his neck. The scar was in a slashing motion over where his artery would be. I couldn't help myself. 

"What is that scar on your neck?" I blurted out, not taking my eyes off of the spot.

He turned off the sink and stared into my eyes. It felt like his was forcing my eyes open and putting his fist through. searching forcefully and desperately for something. "Your first night is always the hardest in the Arch."

He wasn't lying. After he left the room, the smell lingered. That coffee and tarmac scent invaded my nostrils until my head was burning with a migraine. I curled up into a ball at the edge of my bed and wished so deeply for the quilt in my apartment rather than the thin-as-paper medical blanket. The ticking of clock and the tapping of a cane rang above the usual screams and yells of the mental ward. Then came one final *tap* and my eyes jutted fully open. My lungs inhaled and inhaled and inhaled air, not stopping until I pushed on my stomach from the outside. The colors of the room I was in turned from off-white to a rainbow display, and then he appeared. Dr. Wool.   
"Doesn't feel to good does it?" The scar on his neck was growing, sinking deeper and expanding until it covered his face and snaked down his chest. The colors were melting from the walls and into the soles of Dr Wool's shoes. He had with him a wooden cane with a silver wolf as the tip. 

"You wanted to die, huh?" Dr Wool sneered. "Well you are in the right place. I will show you what death feels like."  I felt a burning sensation from my stomach, starting in the inside and working it's way out. It was as if my body was eating itself. I tried to call out for help but Dr Wool just laughed. "You didn't want help. You turned off your phone right before you did it, no one could reach you. Why is now different?"   
I looked down at my arms and saw as my veins turned from a blood to a red. They could warmer and warmer until they were as red as my blood was. Bubbles appeared on the inside of my skin and I felt a clawing sensation around my neck. 

"You were going to leave all of this behind." Dr Wool laughed. "You are diseased. Do you feel it?"

I cried out, sobbing from the unbearable amount of pain. My head felt underwater with all the emotion and overtime my senses were doing. Dr Wool put the end of his cane on my chin and forced my head up to face him.   
"Say it." He tutted. "'I am diseased.' You need a doctor, don't you?" 

The scar had consumed his face. Nothing was visible other than that wretched scar. Nothing but his pearly white teeth. Not wanting another second of the pain, I complied.

"I am diseased. Please doctor help." I screamed in agony. 

Doctor Wool's smile returned with a warm. He flipped over his cane so that silver wolf handle was staring me in the face. Then, as if he were talking a swing with a golf club, he brought it down on my neck. The jaw of the wolf connecting perfectly with my artery. 

  
When my eyes opened I was alone in a dark room. My roommate was nowhere to be found, nor was Dr. Wool. I grabbed my neck and was met with a stinging pain. That was still there but no signs of anything else happening was to be found. I looked down at my other arm to find a broken piece of glass in my hand. I was not crazy. The meds wouldn't give me that kind of episode. It was the first day, there was no way I was having hallucinations. Please. I know what I saw.
