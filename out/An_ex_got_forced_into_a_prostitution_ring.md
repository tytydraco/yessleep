Because this might be an ongoing life or death things or something I just made up, we will say that everything here is fictional.

Three months ago, I was online dating that girl, I liked her and she liked me, she had some mental issue but I was ready to help her and she was ready to get the help she needs. She sadly was not well off and had issue with her previous medical bills, I am quite a nice guy so I helped her by giving her money, there was an understanding that this was just me helping her and she will never have to pay it back, we had plan to move together anyway.

Fast forward a full month of dating, I was paying for quite a lot of her things (about 2.5kâ‚¬) but we hadn't meant yet, each weekend we were supposed to meet something came up. We had quite a fight around the 4th time she refused to meet as I was a bit eager to meet her but she was not comfortable to do so, at this point she decided to end everything. This triggered of course a very explosive reaction from myself as I said she used me and she was psychotic (in her defense she has mental issue which can be associated to that). Anyway I tried to give ourselves closure and I apologized before we said goodbye online, she unfriended me and I just marked that money as lost forever.

In the meantime I constructed another relationship with someone IRL and it is going very well, but now she suddenly contacted me back 3 days ago, begging for me to meet her. I was really surprised because in that story I felt like the one that lost the most so I wasn't expecting her to contact me back ever, especially after how I treated her online when she asked me to break up. Anyway I am very curious so I asked her about her life so far. That's where I learnt the most awful thing.

She quitted her low paying job, she got addicted to drug and she met another guy in the street which seemed nice like I was to her online and she accepted what he proposed. Fast forward a week, she was hospitalized, drugged, raped and was in debt because of him. Fast forward a week he made her quit her job and become a prostitute for him to pay off that hospital debt + some other expenses he made up. 

Of course I was very skeptical at first, this seems like a big lie which she made up for some reason but I knew her and she would never lie to me nor could not make something so elaborate. The issue is she is now a drug addict and doesn't see she is being used as a prostitute so when I told her she was a bit surprised. She was trying to do the right thing by paying that guy back and she had no other choice.

Against my better judgement (and my current gf advice), I went and meet her because I wanted some closure too, and sadly everything she told me is true. I managed to solve a few of her current issue but she is a drug addict and a prostitute now. My options are very limited because going through official channel will hurt her more and I can not help her financially nor can not host her at my home since I have a gf now.

In that story I sadly didn't do anything wrong but I feel bad because she lowered her guard when meeting that guy thinking she saw me in him (keep in mind I was the nicest to her, I got her shoes, food, paid bills, plays games and did video chat all the time), and now she ended up to a place where I wish no one will ever go. She lost her TV, her bed and her shoes she work so hard to get before we met. She live in a shitty room doing coke and xtc, and each night she go in the guy's car to some clients for her "work". She said she doesn't care anymore but when I saw her for the first time IRL (do mind we video chatted last 2 month ago before breaking up) she looked nothing like the sweet girl I liked. She was beaten, raped, tortured, kidnapped and almost stabbed. She "owe" lots of money to that guy and she "work" all nights now. She is broken beyond redemption and she can't seem to see she is being used. When we talked she was so happy to see me but she seemed dead inside, I was the only thing sparking some joy in her it seems.
