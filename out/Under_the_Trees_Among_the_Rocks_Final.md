The interview ended in a blur. I did my best to stay focused, but I couldn’t. Not on Claire or her questions, anyway. Once she had exhausted her questions, or her ability to ask them of me, it was all I could do to give her a warm handshake-turned-hug and thank her for having me before snatching my phone from the hoodie-wearing PA’s basket.



I barely saw the building, the stairs, or the sidewalk outside as I jabbed at my phone’s screen, filled with a yawning hunger for information. The most cursory online search turned up a dozen news articles from that year, starting in the summer, but of course, the search results showed the most recent one first. 



VIGIL HELD ON ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF ALBERTVILLE CHILDRENS’ DISAPPEARANCE



The thumbnail for the article showed a field of candles held by hands only dimly touched by their light. In front of them, a podium with two sets of parents. No children.



I kept scrolling, further and faster.



NO DEVELOPMENTS IN CASE OF MISSING ALBERTVILLE CHILDREN



Headlines blurred into one another as I tried to find the beginning of it all. Finally, I saw that the first article published on the subject was from the Albertville Herald. My hometown paper ran out of a tiny, cavelike office downtown, right next to a boutique that had always seemed to pass from the hands of one rich man’s wife to another. Not exactly a paragon of journalistic quality, but they were the closest to the case. And the headline was different from the others— strikingly so. 



TWO GAINES MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS MISSING, ONE INJURED FOLLOWING INCIDENT IN MCILRATH WOODS



For a moment, all I could think was that I never knew the woods we played in had a name. How did they pick a name for a big chunk of trees with a creek running through it? But it only took a moment for my mind to shake off the shock and focus on the important part: ONE INJURED. I clicked on the article.



People flowed around me as I paused at the entrance to the subway station. My phone service was bad down there, and I needed the article to load. 



The first thing that came through was the main image, the Albert County Hospital’s unimpressive facade side-by-side with a generic shot of trees, green-leafed and low-limbed. As text populated the page, I finally allowed the crowd to wash me along in its current, still never taking my eyes off my phone.



“Three children were reported missing this Friday evening, and by Sunday afternoon, search parties breathed a partial sigh of relief as one of those children was recovered. The young girl, who remains unnamed at this time, was found wandering McIlrath Woods, barefoot and covered in a substantial quantity of what appeared to be blood. Local search party members quickly alerted the girl’s parents, who were overjoyed to be reunited with their child but troubled by what they soon discovered to be significant injuries. Emergency medical personnel were on-site to provide aid, and the young lady was ultimately taken to the Albert County Hospital for treatment and observation. Her injuries at the time of her discovery included a large laceration to her head, a missing tooth, and multiple scrapes and abrasions to her hands, arms, and legs, along with damage done to her feet by walking barefoot through the woods and early signs of exposure. EMTs suspect a concussion, as the girl did not appear aware of her surroundings and could not answer basic questions. She did appear to recognize her parents, but she was unable to identify the date or share any information on the other two children, still missing.



‘We believe the children were playing in the woods after school let out for the summer,’ said Police Chief Michael Dunston. ‘From the looks of her, along with the state of her clothes and the blood we later found on some of the rocks down by the creek, it’s likely that she may have fallen into the water and sustained her injuries that way. She was in stable condition but taken to the hospital for further examination. Once she’s able to answer questions, we hope she’ll be able to shed some light on the whereabouts of her friends. In the meantime, the police department is putting together a team to search the creek. We’ve requested additional manpower from the sheriff’s department, the state police, and our colleagues in Pine Grove, whose recovery team will be dragging Lake Hunt, where the creek terminates, in case the two other children were carried by the current.” 



Chief Duston assured the Albertville community that every effort is being made to bring the two remaining missing children home to their families.”



Sleepwalking through the turnstiles and down the stairs down into the tunnel, I read and reread the article. I was barely aware of the other people on the platform as my hand snaked up to my hairline, feeling the bumpy scar that had stretched and paled almost into invisibility over the years. I didn’t need to look at my hands to know that, the heel of my right hand had a dark smudge that had never faded, thanks, I now knew, to some lingering trace of rock dust buried too deep to be extracted. And the missing tooth… Whatever I was beginning to remember of that day— of creeping into the creek, slipping, and falling— I didn’t remember losing a tooth. Still, I had passed out. It could’ve happened then. Without meaning to, I ran my tongue over my left eye tooth. I didn’t remember losing it, but it had been my last baby tooth, and it had grown in crooked.



Still feverish, I navigated back to the search page and scrolled through all the articles again, looking for any mention of a man. There had been a man, hadn’t there? Memories were washing back in, first just in silhouette, the barest shape of things, but in increasingly more detail as it percolated in the back of my mind. I remembered Mark and Beth— I remembered them so well, so achingly well now— and wanting to let them have a moment just the two of them. Going down to the creek to look for frogs but finding so many good skipping rocks. The high tide. The pain of falling and the warmth of my own blood on my shirt. 



But there was a man, too. A regular man, who looked like he had been picked up out of some office job and dropped into the woods. The bright green woods with dappled shadows and light glinting off the water, where he and his ironed slacks and dry leather shoes didn’t belong. In my memory, his presence there looked like a bad Photoshop job, where the editor hadn’t bothered to make the new element blend into his surroundings. But how trustworthy was my memory, when it had been blank for almost twenty years? It was coming back, but it was still watery and developing like a photo in a darkroom not yet ready to be hung up and viewed. 



The wind and noise of the approaching train pulled my attention for a moment, and I once again allowed the people around me to carry me forward. A woman with a stroller caught the back of my heel, and a man to my left offered a quick, steadying hand to my shoulder. I tried to flash him a grateful smile, but he was standing just a step behind my line of sight, only visible as a starched pinstriped shirt. Not that I was taking in the details of my surroundings anyway. Everyone on the platform was faceless— the people coming off the train, the people around me. They might have been warm, shiftless mannequins. 



Once inside, I found a car with a handful of open seats. I needed both of my hands to keep typing, keep searching. Returning to my phone, I swiped through the search page again, looking for anything related to the injured girl, to me. The first article had said I was concussed, that I hadn’t been able to tell them anything about Mark and Beth. But what about the days and weeks after that? Had I remembered something then that had since slipped away from me? 



It made some sense, I supposed, that the trauma of it all had messed with my memory, especially with all the change that came after. And maybe Claire was right about my parents wanting to protect me. They were old school, not big talkers, and if I had forgotten it all, maybe they were content to let me. Still, I couldn’t get away from the fact that I had spent almost a year in that town, haunted by the absence of my missing friends. Had I flinched when teachers skipped over their names in roll call? Had their parents come to the house to ask me what I knew, beg me to remember something, shake me by the shoulders with tears pooling in the hollows of their throats as they rasped their desperate questions into my blank face? Mark’s parents would have done that. Beth’s siblings, too, maybe. Had I spent a year dodging questioning looks in the grocery store and avoiding the eyes of Beth’s sisters in the mirror of the girls’ room between classes? A year of no answers and suspicion and pity and fear, and I had forgotten it all? 



Gritting my teeth, I focused back on my phone screen. Buried in the list of articles I’d sped past was just the headline I was looking for: GIRL INJURED IN MCILRATH WOODS REPORTS NO MEMORY OF DAYS SPENT MISSING, WHEREABOUTS OF OTHER CHILDREN. Terrified and thrilled, I clicked through, only to be met with a blank page informing me I had no service. 



Right. Shit.



“No service?” came a voice from my left, low but perfectly clear despite the rattle of the train. “It’s the worst.” 



I glanced over, feeling a little defensive— had this guy been reading over my shoulder?— before I recognized the clean lines of his shirt. The man who had steadied me on the platform. A few of us had come to this car in search of seats; he must’ve been just behind me again. “Yeah,” I said, weak but polite. “It sucks.”



He nodded at my phone. “Some pretty grisly stuff you’ve got there. Maybe some things are better left buried.”



I had lived in the city long enough to have a high tolerance for the audacity of strangers, but I was too raw to brush it off. Instead, I gave the man a long look. He was probably in his forties, with the smooth, generic look of a nine-to-fiver. His face held all the hallmarks of concern at the corners of his mouth and eyes, but his voice was neutral. Unlike most people on the train, he didn’t have his phone out, although one hand rested closed on his thigh like he was holding something small. At least his legs were held considerately close together and not spreading into my space, though one leg stretched out in front of him. His nice leather loafer was a tripping hazard waiting to happen.



“I’m sorry,” I said with no attempt at sincerity. “Do I know you?”



The man chuckled. “Of course. I’m a little hurt you don’t remember. Although I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised.” 



My heart jolted a little before realizing that he might’ve been a fan of the orchestra. Maybe he’d seen me in the paper, or at a concert. Thinking about it, there had been a hint of a drawl in his voice. What were the odds he knew me from back home, from school? Or maybe he was just a weirdo. Odds of that were, realistically, quite good. 



Still, I took a deep breath and tried to smile. His cologne was subtle and earthy, but in a way that seemed geared more towards realism than appeal. With the memories still building in my head, it was almost too much. “Sorry— I’m terrible with faces. Remind me?”



The stranger gave me a sardonic, knowing smile and clicked his tongue in mock reproof. “Luckily for you, I never forget a face. But then, I shouldn’t be so hard on you. Short-term amnesia, right? Sometimes, you can’t remember something because you never formed the memory in the first place. Especially if it gets knocked right out of you.” He winked and pretended to knock on the side of his head with his already fisted hand. 



I narrowed my eyes. What was this stranger’s deal? Of all the days for someone to mess with me on the subway, this was the worst one I could imagine. My patience rapidly running out, I said, “Right. Well, I think you must be mistaken. My memory is just fine, and I don’t know you.” I turned a fraction in my seat to indicate that I was done here, shifting my bag from my lap to the space between us for good measure. All I wanted, in the absence of more articles to read, was to unfocus my eyes and let my burgeoning memories play out with whatever new details they could supply.



His voice in my ear made my stomach freeze over. I hadn’t seen or felt him move— I could’ve sworn he hadn’t— but his voice was so close, so perfectly clear. “Oh, we know each other alright. We met under the trees, among the rocks. Across the water.”



My spine went rigid, and I didn’t look over my shoulder. “What did you say?”



“You heard me,” the stranger said, a little impatient now. “We made a trade. I think you forgot about it, but I haven’t. I never do. I made good on my end, and you have too. You still are.”



“What do you mean?” My voice was low and shaking, but I knew he could hear me. I could practically feel his eyes on me, his face looming behind me. I could hear the grin in his voice. “I’m not doing anything.”



A small puff of an exhale. “Of course you are. You can’t help it. And I’m not here to tell you you’re doing anything wrong. I just wanted you to know that you can’t stop it. Now that you know, I mean. You’ll want to, but you can’t.” 



Before I could speak, the train’s brakes squealed, the car rocking as it slowed. This was my stop, but I couldn’t move. 



“Here,” the stranger said. I heard a rustle as he touched my bag, but I couldn’t bring myself to stop him. “You keep these for now. Maybe if you understand, you won’t be so inclined to fight it.” 



The train doors hissed open and I stood, grabbing my bag and not looking at the stranger. Tears were pricking at my eyes, and I didn’t want him to see. He was just a crazy person, one of a hundred lunatics on the subway every day, whispering deranged nonsense to try and upset people.



As I strode away, heading for the far doors away from him, his voice called out behind me, still so clear. “Dry your tears, Mandy. It’s just like you said.” 



I ran out of the subway station. If the people around me minded, I didn’t hear them, and I didn’t slow until I reached my apartment building. Only when the glass doors closed behind me and the cool lobby carried my footsteps back like a comforting companion did I catch my breath, trying to slow my racing heart as I waited for the elevator. I focused on the details around me. The refined architecture of the building. The wide, shining floors. The unchipped gold detailing around the elevator call button, and the vase on the delicate table nearby. No one loitered in the empty space. Aside from the doorman, I was alone. 



The orchestra paid well. My building was beautiful. Whatever had happened today, or years ago, my life now was good. It was good. Wide and clean and full of lovely things, just like this building.



In my apartment, I threw my bag on my sleek, armless couch and went straight for the bathroom. I needed to wash my hands with an urgency I couldn’t justify, but washing wasn’t enough. Without thinking, I stooped to open the cabinet under the sink, looking for something stronger. Rubbing alcohol, maybe. Bleach. 



Among the cleaning supplies, I spotted a tall, clear bottle, mostly full of oatmeal-colored gel. I brushed it aside, not sure why I even still had dog shampoo. The terrier mix I’d scooped up off the street and called Annie had run away within a month. At least, I assumed she had; I’d never figured out how she’d gotten out of the apartment.



When my search proved fruitless, I settled for taking a shower. If nothing else, I could get the feel of the day off my body before I read anymore articles. Reading them didn’t feel quite so urgent now, but I couldn’t stop either. I needed to know.



I stretched out my shower as long as I could, dreading having to even look at my purse to retrieve my phone, but a shower could only last so long. Armed with a glass of wine, I approached my sofa as if a snake were coiled between its cushions and sat across from my bag. I felt a little pathetic as I took a deep breath, and a deeper gulp of wine; still, it wasn’t quite enough. The small black remote controls sat in their proper place, arrayed on a small silver tray on my coffee table, and I turned on my sound system, then the smart TV. A few clicks later, music filled the air, thinning the tension just enough. 



It was Vivaldi, the same recording my mother had had on tape when I was little, and I turned it down low, the way I had always done at bedtime. Finally, I allowed my gaze to roam over the room, taking in all the things I had carefully curated to suit my living room. Glass shelves held a framed diploma and trinkets I’d picked up when the orchestra traveled. My first bow rested in a shadow box, flanked by photos of landscapes and architecture, all artfully arranged into an asymmetrical but pleasing gallery. I was home, in my own space, surrounded by all the evidence of the things I had to be grateful for. I could do this.



My heart racing a fraction slower now, I reached for my bag, dipping my hand into the wide outer pocket where I always dropped my phone. 



Instead of glass or hard plastic, my fingertips brushed something rough. Confusion filled me, then alarm as I remembered the stranger dropping something into my purse. What the hell had he put in there? I pulled the pocket wide and peered in. The shapes inside were indistinct, but I could see my phone. I plucked it out, careful not to touch anything else.



Toggling the flashlight on, I pointed the light into my bag, onto the mystery objects. 



There were two of them, round, and just smaller than my fist. Rough, mottled gray, with small inclusions that glinted in the light.



Well, not hypodermic needles, at least. I still didn’t want to touch them.



Instead, I upended my bag. The main compartment hadn’t been zipped, so the entire contents spilled onto my sofa, sheet music sifting into a heap and lipstick rolling onto the floor. A bottle of water I’d forgotten about thumped onto the carpet but remained closed. I barely looked at any of it.



Sitting on smooth brown leather, inches from my knee, were two rocks. Perfectly flat. Bile rose in my throat. They didn’t look like anything special, but I had to know for sure. I grabbed them, one in each hand, and flipped them over. 



The bile in my throat threatened to spill out. One rock was unmarked except for a small, round spot near the center, its edges ragged and grasping. Like a single, perfect tear had fallen on it and left a stain. The other was smeared in blood. I traced the curves of the smudge, the little v-shaped wedges of negative space. A palm and five small, bloody fingers, stamped there before it had been hurled away.



As I traced the handprint, my fingernail snagged on a tiny divot in the surface of the stone, and I brought it closer to my face to examine it. The divot wasn’t just a chip— it was a deliberately engraved line. One of many, I saw, as I craned my head and strained my eyes. Tiny, jagged lines scratched out words on the bloody surface. 



Not words. Names.



Near the index finger: PATRICIA BARNES.



Between the middle and ring finger: ANNIE. 



Finally, at the base of the palm, two names: MARK BERGER. ELIZABETH HUGHES.



Eyes blurring and head heavy with disorientation, I snatched up the tear-rock and held it next to the other. More names. All ones I knew.



My first roommate at CASA who had gossiped with me at night. A pianist who had always shared a rehearsal room with me during exams. My downstairs neighbor from my old apartment building who had helped replace the batteries in my smoke detector and let me play with her cat. So many more.



They were all my friends. They were all of my friends. And they were all gone. They had moved away or taken new jobs. That’s what I’d assumed, or been told. Run away. Missing.



On some perverse instinct, I straightened and held the rocks over my face, like binoculars, or huge, mismatched eyes, and let the memories flow. I let the details fill.



*I guess it goes without saying that you’d be willing to give up your friends if it meant you could go to that school and make all your dreams come true.*



*I don’t want to leave Mark and Beth.*



*But you would. And it wouldn’t just be them, of course. It would be all of your friends.*



And there they were. Given up. Gone from my life, with only their names left behind. Maybe they had moved. Or taken other jobs. Or gotten out of the apartment. Maybe. But I doubted it.



As I lowered the rocks, I noticed a final name etched into the tear-stone. It hadn’t been there before. I knew it hadn’t.



CLAIRE BAINBRIDGE.



Both rocks fell from my hands as I leapt from the couch. Reflexively, I looked around, as if the stranger would be waiting for me in a shadowed corner or crouched under a table, but there was nothing and no one. Instead, all I saw were the souvenirs on my shelves, bought only for myself because I had no one to bring them back to. Framed photos of rolling hills and cathedrals, but no faces. There were no friends to crowd into clumsy group shots. My remote controls all lined up perfectly on my spotless coffee table, my unblemished sofa, all of it free of dog hair and unscratched by happy paws. Music echoed in the silence, the sound reverberating with nothing soft to dampen it.



I looked back to the rocks. Again, they looked like nothing so much as a giant pair of eyes, taking in me and everything around me. Examining everything I had received and documenting everything I had paid to get it. Asking, *was it worth it?*



As I sank back onto the cold, perfect leather cushion, I gasped out the sob building in my chest. I felt like a lottery winner that had spent all her money on things that seemed beautiful and impressive, only to look at an empty pantry and realize she was starving. 



I hadn’t known. How could I? I hadn’t known.



*It’ll be just like you said. You’ll make the trade. You already have.*



I had made the trade alright, and it had given me so much. Still I starved, surrounded by cold beauty and nothing of any real value. I starved, and if Claire’s name on that rock was any indication, I always would, without the comfort of dying.



The rocks still stared at me, unblinking, my blood and tears and all of my friends still asking, *Was it worth it?*
