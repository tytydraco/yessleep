When I was 13 years old, I encountered a man named Mr. Whispers. My younger brother Marcus was 5 and slept with as many lights on as he could because he was terrified of the dark. He had a nightlight, lamp, and flashlight that he could hold. We shared the same bedroom and although the light helped him sleep, it kept me awake for most of the night until I would sleep from exhaustion. Our room was small and the beds were lined along each wall in opposite directions. My wall was covered in basketball posters and superheroes and his wall was covered with paintings my mom had picked out since he hadn’t chosen anything to hang up there yet. 

When my brother turned 6, my mom made him get rid of every light except for the nightlight which meant that I could finally fall asleep normally. I knew how afraid my brother was, so I never fought back when it came to the lights so my mom had no idea that this problem even existed. 

For the first time since I could remember, the first night with the lights off, I fell asleep nearly instantly; almost as soon as my head hit the pillow. Marcus on the other hand, didn’t sleep for a second and woke me up multiple times, almost once an hour beginning at 3 AM. At one point, I screamed at him to leave me alone and before I fell asleep once more, I could hear him sobbing in his bed. 

The next night, Marcus couldn’t sleep and didn’t bother trying to wake me up. I just so happened to wake up without his help and thought I heard him whispering to himself or one of his stuffed animals. 

“Go to bed Marc,” I said quietly, “It’s okay,”

As I finished my sentence, I heard careful, quick footsteps and felt a wisp of wind pass by my bed. I sat up quickly, to try and see where my brother was going, but grabbed the covers and pulled them over his head. 

“Who were you talking to?” 

He didn’t answer, and I pulled my covers over my head in fear, hoping their warmth would protect me. I anxiously stayed awake the rest of the night. 

During breakfast, Marcus looked well rested and I had to find out who he was talking to. Without alerting my mom, I tried asking again but he refused to answer and his refreshed happiness turned to snappy anger. 

“Leave me alone!” he yelled, “You don’t care about me!”

He grabbed his stuffed tiger on the chair next to him and ran to his room. 

“What did you do to your brother?” My mom asked from the stove, annoyed.

“Nothing,” I replied, worrying about him.

She went and talked to my brother and he told her about when I yelled at him when he was scared; she took away my ability to go to the park after school for the week.  

That night, I heard whispering again, and rather than make noise and annoy Marcus, I quietly peeked from under my covers. I jumped when I saw an adult crouched next to my brother’s bed. They must have seen my bed move because once again, they quickly ran to the room’s exit. All I could see was his dark figure crouched and their body was too big to be my brother’s. The light from the nightlight lit their back as they left the room, revealing dark, tattered clothing. Once again, I tucked myself tightly under my covers and cowered in fear at the stranger in our room.  


I couldn’t hide my fear anymore. Without my brother finding out, I told my mom about the stranger lurking in our room. Naturally, because Marcus was “her baby” she didn’t believe me for a second and thought I was trying to get him in trouble. When my mom dropped us both off at school, I asked my brother who the whispering adult was, and, snapped at me once more.  
  
“Mr. Whispers takes care of me when I’m scared! Not like you”

He tried to push me away from him and ran into the school. Although Marcus and I never got along, I didn’t want him to hate me, I was just scared that some strange adult was in our room late at night. Who was Mr. Whispers? I needed to find out. 

All day during school I was busy making a plan; I was going to find out who this “Mr. Whispers” was. First I needed to sneak into my mom’s room and grab my brother’s old flashlight and a video camera that she bought the year prior. I needed something to record the man with for proof and the flashlight would make sure that he was clear. Then I needed something to stop him when he was leaving to try and prove to my mom that he was real. All I could think of was to get my Nerf gun and shoot him or to grab a bunch of sports equipment from outside and throw it.   
  
My mom’s room was a mess, there were clothes all over the place, jewelry and makeup scattered all over the bureau, and papers all over the floor by a filing cabinet. I trifled through the papers and opened the bottom drawer of the cabinet but there was no camera. I began searching all over the room, looking in every drawer and cabinet trying to find the camera but all I could find was an old digital camera; that was going to have to do. My brother’s old flashlight was sitting on top of the bedside table. I then went into the shed in the backyard of our house and only managed to find a deflated football and an old baseball. I gathered up all the materials and snuck them under my bed. I went about the rest of my day as normal but when bedtime came, I prepared.   
  
I turned the camera on and the battery was only at 25%; I had to make good use of what I had. My plans were progressively just falling apart and I was starting to get nervous. The flashlight was always packed with fresh batteries and the balls were tucked under my pillow, ready to throw. Marcus came into the room and without saying a word to me, he tucked himself into bed. I found myself dozing off as I waited for Mr. Whispers and eventually, I fell asleep by accident.   
  
I woke up when I heard a louder whispering than usual. In my groggy state, it seemed more aggressive and fast but when I peeked from under the covers, my brother seemed to be reacting the same as the last 2 times. Quickly, trying not to miss this opportunity, I turned the camera on, grabbed the flashlight, and popped out from under the comforter. I shined the light directly onto the man’s face and pressed the capture button as many times as I possibly could. The beam of light revealed the man, dressed in tattered and disgusting clothing; his face was also covered in a thick layer of much and his teeth were rotten and brown. The expression he wore was pure anger and I knew at that moment it was going to be something that stayed with me for the rest of my life. He stood beside my brother and ran from the room.   
  
When I saw him run, I broke free from my paparazzi mode and dropped the camera, reaching for the baseball. I threw it with all my might at the man’s head but missed and broke something in the hallway. Mr. Whispers continued running and headed straight down the stairs. My mom’s bedroom door opened and although I knew I would be in trouble, I was glad she heard the sound. I made my way hastily to the bedroom door and she saw me.  
  
“Thomas, what did you do this time?”

I suddenly realized I couldn’t speak and pointed down the stairs. Mr. Whispers was gone but the front door was wide open. 

That night, my mother finally believed me. The camera died as I was taking the pictures but when she plugged it in and saw the man, she finally understood. She gripped me and my brother tightly and called the police. Apologizing hundreds of times for not believing me, my mother was much nicer to Marcus and me from that day on. The police deduced that Mr. Whispers was a homeless man that somehow managed to get into our home without breaking in but they couldn’t deduce if he had a copy of the key or not because the door was unlocked when he left. Marcus started to go back to his normal self after a few days and I made sure to be way more protective over my little brother. I told him that I was sorry and that I would always have his back. 

I’m 33 now, and I recently asked my brother about the experience because it crossed my mind. Below is exactly what he told me. 

“For some reason, I remember so much about those few days. When I thought you didn’t care about me that first night, the next night, Mr. Whispers showed up and made me feel safe. I remember him telling me that he would always protect me but that I shouldn’t tell anyone else about him being there. The second night, he started telling me that I should hate you for betraying me and that you were a ‘bad boy’. The last night he made his way into our room, he promised that he was going to take me away forever and keep me in the safest place possible. Before he could tell me where you revealed him. I never really saw his face, just smelled his horrible odor. I’m not sure why this didn’t deter me, but when you shined the light on him, I lost all trust in him…it was horrifying.”
