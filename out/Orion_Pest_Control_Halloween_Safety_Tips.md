When it comes to Samhain, Orion takes great pains to keep the Neighbors from causing complete chaos in town. While some of our practices might be controversial, believe me, things would be far worse if we didn't follow through on observing them. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

My tips for staying safe from the Neighbors and other spooky things that could be lurking about on Halloween are fairly simple: follow traditions, and by that, I don't mean that yinz have to go as far as Orion does. Generally speaking, all you really have to do is participate in some typical Halloween fun. 

For starters, carve some pumpkins. You don't even have to be good at it. Any design will do. As you will see in a moment, they're not just decorations. And if you're planning to leave the house, make sure to wear a costume. It'll make it harder for less intelligent Neighbors to discriminate between who's human and who's not. The more of yourself that you conceal, the safer you'll be. 

Not the outgoing type? Hand out some candy. Even if you don't encounter anything unusual during the evening, the kids on your block will appreciate it. And *don't* be that person that hands out raisins. Not only are you at risk of having your house egged (which you would absolutely deserve, by the way), you never know if one of the trick-or-treaters is going to take it a little too personally. It's best to keep in mind that what you're handing out is an offering. 

In summary, all of the usual Halloween traditions aren't just for fun. They have ancient roots, all designed to protect us. Unfortunately, many people have forgotten that. Others were never warned to begin with, which is why I'm making a point to do it now. This way, everyone has time to prepare. 

So those are the steps I recommend for regular people to take. That brings me to the extra measures that Orion takes to keep our operating area safe. 

So, to start, here's a little linguistic fun fact: the word ‘bonfire’ is a combination of the words ‘bone’ and ‘fire.’ Many ancient celebrations involved the use of such fires to purify and protect against evil. For Samhain, in particular, it was believed that the flames would help the sun push back the darkness and cold of the upcoming winter. 

Here's where the ‘bone’ part of the bonfire comes in for us. Every year, one of the local farms will donate one of their cattle. To make things fair, each of the farms around the area rotates who is responsible for this donation each year. Because of that, sometimes the bones are provided by a sheep, sometimes it's a cow, though chickens and ducks seem to do the job as well. 

Our preferred spot to hold this bonfire is on a hill just outside of town that's devoid of any trees to lower the risk of brush fires.  The fire will be lit an hour before sunset and maintained until sunrise. When it comes to the sacrifice, we try to do it as humanely as possible. Once the deed has been done, the animal will then be placed onto the fire as an offering. 

I know, it sounds barbaric, but believe me, these animal's deaths are *not* in vain. They serve an extremely important purpose. 

There are some Neighbors that can only come out during Samhain. The bonfires that we maintain are the only things that can keep them at bay. 

Before we used the hill we do now, we were at another spot that was near the ‘burbs. But then one fateful year, someone on the HOA got a bug up their butt about us doing ‘Satanic rituals’ and called the police on us. To top it off, the HOA had also announced that they would not allow any ‘occult’ decorations, including skeletons, witches, and of all things, jack o’lanterns, much to the outrage of many residents. Quite a few homeowners flocked to party stores in droves to buy as many tacky decorations as they could in protest. 

Yeah. One of *those* HOAs. 

Because of that, our bonfire was cut short. Since I was still relatively new at the time, Victor put me in charge of starting another fire somewhere far away from the ‘burbs while he patrolled the area to see if *something* had emerged from the Mounds during this momentary distraction. 

That something was The Lady in White. 

About an hour after our initial bonfire was forcibly extinguished, Victor got a call from one of the suburbanites. 

“Hey, so, uhhhh, I just got chased by a- I don't know what to call it! A giant… demonic… pig thing! It's just outside my door and- *Oh my!* Oh my God!”

Once Victor asked the client where he was, the client gave him the address before finding somewhere in his house to hide. Victor went off to deal with it alone.  

Just outside of the client’s house stood a headless woman, dressed in opulent, lacey finery, hence why we call her The Lady. When we did more research on her garments, trying to determine where she could have come from, we discovered that she had been wearing a wedding dress that looked to be from the 1500s. We still aren't sure what the significance of that is. 

The Lady was accompanied by, of all things, a large black pig. Although, according to Victor's description, ‘large’ is an understatement. It was only a little bit shorter than the client's Toyota Corolla. Another notable feature was that the pig had no tail, though, given its size and temperament, the missing tail is the least worrisome thing about it. 

The pig had stood outside the client's front door, grunting as it sniffed aggressively with its nose pressed against the wood. It kept grating its hooves against the ground impatiently as if wondering why the door wouldn't magically open. 

Just as Victor withdrew his pistol, The Lady had turned towards him. Despite not having a head, he *knew* she could see him. Her hands were folded politely over her midsection, her posture stiff from centuries of propriety. At the same time, the pig's head suddenly snapped in Victor's direction, quickly forgetting about the client. It let out a guttural squeal as it charged, excited that it had found new, more readily accessible prey. 

Victor had taken a shot at the pig as he raced back towards the company truck. Unfortunately, he'd missed, so the pig was hot on his heels. The Lady, hands still folded, slowly glided after them, the skirts of her fine dress billowing in the wind as she took each step. 

Victor stumbled onto the porch of the house across the street, taking aim as he pounded on the door. It hadn't escaped his notice that the pair didn't appear to be able to get inside the other house. That most likely meant that they couldn't enter human dwellings without the homeowner's permission. Unfortunately for him, there were no lights on inside the house he'd chosen. Nobody came to answer the door. 

He'd thought he was completely fucked until he turned to see that the pig's pursuit had abruptly stopped. So had The Lady's. 

In his haste, the boss hadn't noticed that there was a row of jack o'lanterns sitting on the porch right by the steps, each face carved into goofy, lopsided smiles. The pig stared down at the family of pumpkins as the candles within danced. The Lady came to stand next to the massive animal, reaching one hand down to stroke its head. The pig grunted softly, then the ghastly pair turned back to patrol the street for any more souls unfortunate enough to be caught outside after dark. 

Victor had gotten incredibly lucky that he'd come across one of the households protesting the ban on ‘occult symbols.’ 

He'd waited until The Lady and her horrible pet had wandered further down the road, watching them, silently hoping that I'd get that bonfire started before they got to someone else (I promise, was going as fast as I could).  

His heart sank when he heard the whooping of two drunks walking home from a nearby Halloween party. Following the riotous noises were the shrieks of the monstrous black pig. 

In a moment of desperation, Victor picked up one of the smaller jack o'lanterns, tucking it under his arm as he rushed towards the commotion. It might seem silly, but at the time, it was his best defense. 

The drunks had gone from joyously hooting and hollering to screaming as The Lady's terrible companion charged them. Victor opened fire on the pig's large behind, managing to hit it just as it clamped its jaws around one of the drunk's forearms. The pig didn’t appear to notice as it began to shake him around in its jaws like a chew toy. All the poor man could do was wail as his friend tried in vain to pry the pig's jaws apart. 

The whole time, The Lady just watched, hands folded in a show of perfect manners. 

Victor held the jack o'lantern up at the pig. At the same time, I'd managed to get another fire going on the hill that would grow to become our usual Halloween bonfire spot. 

Victor had said that the pig suddenly released the man, its ears twitching. The Lady began to walk forward, heading towards the forest. The pig followed, blood dripping from its massive jaws. Victor waited until they disappeared into the treeline before rushing over to the drunks. 

The pig had broken the man's forearm so severely that the appendage was facing backwards. His shoulder had also been dislocated while being flailed around. As grotesque and painful as his injuries were, at least he got out with his life. By some miracle, he even managed to keep his arm, though I guess to this day, it still doesn't move properly. 

Suffice to say, that was a lesson the HOA only had to learn once. The ban was repealed that very week. After that particular Halloween, we haven't received any more complaints about the bonfires. And since we've been able to maintain said fires in peace, The Lady and her piggy haven't been spotted again. 

Trying to ban jack o'lanterns was stupid for a number of reasons, the biggest being that they're one of the most effective Neighbor repellants out there. However, what's interesting is that jack o'lanterns only seem to have this much power during the fall season. 
 
We've tested it before by carving pumpkins, turnips, and gourds during the months that are further away from Samhain. Through that, we've discovered that outside of the autumn season, the jack o'lanterns had no effect on the Neighbors whatsoever. We aren’t sure why this is.

If yinz have any more questions about safety during Samhain, don’t hesitate to ask. That’s what I’m here for.

When it comes to this year’s Halloween, I discussed the information the Huntress gave me with my coworkers the day after my first training session with her.

“I hate to say it, but it should probably be one of us,” I reasoned. “If not, they’re probably just going to pick some rando that doesn’t know how to deal with them.”

Without hesitation, Wes volunteered, “I got it.” 

He and I have partially discussed it outside of work, but figured it would be best to wait to really talk in depth about it with the others. This affected everyone, after all. 

“Do they seriously only just go after one person?” Reyna asked unsurely. “How do we know that they’re not going to try to take us all out in one fell swoop? That seems exactly like the kind of thing Psycho Mantis would get us on.”

“We don’t.” Victor replied solemnly. “It’s entirely possible that the Huntress could’ve conveniently left something like that out. Hunters aren’t exactly known for being upfront and honest.”

“And she said that telling Nessa all that stuff was risky, but she didn’t say *specifically* that Psycho Mantis was the reason for that, you know?” Reyna pointed out. “He could’ve put her up to it.”

That was something I hadn’t considered. This is precisely why I’ve been trying not to make deals with him alone anymore. 

Cerri, hand resting on her cheek at her desk, piped up, “So should we all stick together, then? Or is that more dangerous?”

Sighing thoughtfully, Victor said, “Until the scumbag comes back, let’s just operate under the assumption that it’s just one person. Wes, are you serious about this?” 

“Yeah, I'm serious about it.” Wes said with a humorless smile. “Fucker’s had it coming for a while.”

“I’m still so confused over the fact that you actually *want* to fight him.” Reyna balked at our coworker, eyes wide. 

“I’ve seen his type before. He's a run-of-the-mill abusive asshole,” Wes went on. “A powerful one, granted, but at their core, they're all the same. You get a guy like that angry, they make mistakes.”

My mind automatically went back to when Iolo had threatened to break my jaw. He’d been furious, sure, but he'd still had control over himself. Come to think of it, the only time he's ever seemed out of control was when I'd named him, and even then, it didn't take him long to recover. 

We discussed our options at length for nearly two hours. 

Our plan for Samhain was as follows: Cerri and Reyna would be in charge of the bonfire. They'd be able to watch each other's backs and ensure that it burned throughout the night. We didn't need any other nasty Neighbors like The Lady to make the night even more interesting than it was already bound to be. 

Operating under the assumption that the Hunt would only target one person, Wes seemed to be the best choice. That being said, we weren't going to abandon him to deal with a legion of Hunters all on his own. Victor would be there to help him out. Their goal was simply to survive until sunrise. Nice, right? 

That left the Dullahan as my primary responsibility. Once Reyna has the fire set up, she is going to be on standby in case I need back up. I hope it won't get to that point, but we’ll see what happens. 

There was just one problem with all of this: I had to get the mechanic to agree to it. At that point, the Huntress was still acting as my substitute teacher and she had yet to mention anything about him. 

I should've known that he'd find me when he was ready. 

Deirdre and I had our first date over the weekend. Our first real one, anyway. Call me a hopeless romantic, but I don't think having her sing to me in a river while fearing for my life counts. I'm not sure if taking her to meet my mom counts either. I'm a bit rusty when it comes to romance, as yinz can see. 

One of the bigger farms in the area is well-known for setting up corn mazes and hayrides. They've also got some of the best homemade apple cider that I've ever had in my life, and that's coming from someone that has no self-control when it comes to a delicious fall beverage. 

As far as their precautions go, they're highly diligent when it comes to appeasing their resident Auntie Rye; during the hayride season, she keeps to a sectioned off area that isn't open to the public. 

Ever wonder why those corn maze places always seem to have a portion of their fields closed off? That's why. When they tell you to stay out, just know that it's for your own good. Stay in the maze. Don't go exploring anywhere you aren't supposed to be. 

While you can occasionally catch glimpses of their Rye Aunt, she is content to keep to herself. According to Victor, this particular Auntie has resided in the field for almost ten years without incident. That just goes to show how responsible this farm is. 

At first, when I learned this fun little fact, corn mazes were almost ruined for me. Nowadays, it's just a part of life, like knowing that there could be bears on hiking trails or deer that could waltz out in front of your car. As long as you're aware of the potential dangers and know what to do if something goes wrong,
things should be alright. 

At first, my afternoon with Deirdre was a much-needed break from reality. For a few hours, there wasn't a Dullahan on the way or a deranged suitor plotting to serve an Orion employee up to a Celtic god for Samhain. It was just me watching Deirdre try her first candy apple. Her smile dazzling as we sat together on a hayride, admiring the rows and rows of corn surrounding us with our fingers interlaced. 

I won't bore yinz with any more details than that. Just wanted to paint a picture of a brief moment of peace in my life. 

But of course, all nice things must come to an end. 

I’d playfully tugged her into the corn maze with me, joking that I couldn't wait to get hopelessly lost with her. She giggled in a way that made my heart melt as she let me lead her inside the chasm between the looming stalks. 

At first, we got lost on purpose, just wanting to spend as much time together as possible. It was such a pleasantly crisp fall afternoon that neither of us was in a hurry for it to end. 

Deirdre noticed the crow’s shadow first. 

The shadow’s wings flapped towards its owner, which sat on the ground in one of the dead ends as if it had been waiting for us. It then took flight, landing on a corn stalk that led deeper into the field, looking at us expectantly. 

Deirdre and I glanced at each other, her hand gripping mine even tighter. *I guess the mechanic is ready to talk.* He picked a hell of a time, though. Wordlessly, we followed the crow deeper into the corn. I never let go of Deirdre’s hand, using my free one to push the corn stalks in front of us aside. 

Eventually, we came across a circular clearing in the corn. Sure enough, the mechanic was waiting for us, seated on the ground in front of a hay bale, leaning back comfortably against it. The crow fluttered over, resting on the hay just long enough for him to reach back to give it a quick scratch on the chin. After that quick moment of affection, it took to the skies once again. 

On the surface, Iolo looked much better than when I saw him last, but given that he’d appeared to be on death’s doorstep, that's not saying much. The color had returned to his cheeks. His eyes had regained that keen, bright glimmer that had momentarily been dulled after losing his wings. 

To my relief, he didn't have either of his instruments with him. It was wishful thinking that it meant that he was intending to behave himself. Granted, the bar when it comes to good behavior from Iolo is pretty low. 

If he was irritated to see Deirdre and I together, he concealed it as he greeted us with a mischievous smile. “I ain't interrupin’, am I?”

*You know exactly what you're doing, you prick.*

“Her life takes precedence.” Deirdre replied calmly before I could respond.

She let go of my hand, sitting on the other hay bale, eyes fixed on him sternly as she then said, “We will be holding you to what you said about being even, the influence of anesthesia be damned.”

He began to laugh, “Well, look at you, bein’ all tough!”

Deirdre has infinitely more patience than I do for not immediately getting enraged by the way he spoke to her. She simply let it slide. 

“We just want to get this all figured out before your king arrives.” I answered, trying not to get too angry on her behalf. “And without any tricks.”

He raised his eyebrows in bemusement, “Alrighty.”

Notice how he didn't make any promises about not trying to pull the wool over our eyes? Judging by the crinkle of Deirdre's brow, she definitely did, too. 

I joined her on the hay bale, trying not to be too obvious about scanning Iolo for signs of what could've happened with those seeds despite knowing that his ‘pretty boy disguise' would most likely conceal anything. 

He scrutinized me just as thoroughly, his eyes roving over every inch of me as he commented, “You were lookin’ pretty rough last time I saw you.”

“Better than you.” I replied without thinking, then immediately regretted it. 

Thankfully, he was in a decent mood, for the moment. He snorted, “Yeah, no shit.”

Deirdre, to her credit, tried to be nice, “It's… good that you all worked together. I hate to think how much worse it could've been had either party tried to take the witch on alone.”

He side-eyed her as if he’d forgotten that she was there and was irritated to be reminded. Even though her expression didn't change, I could tell that this had bothered her. 

Back to business, Iolo then asked, “I take it ya want your freedom?” 

He very subtly rolled his bad shoulder back against the hay bale to use it as an armrest. If he was in pain, it didn't show on his face. 

I dared to be direct with him, “I want to know once and for all that I can be done with my debt to you. And I want to discuss how Samhain is going to go.”

He chuckled, “Gettin’ right to the point! Alright. Go on ahead.”

I tried to think of a way I could bring up what the Huntress told me without ratting her out. He's not stupid. The Huntress was the one working with me for the past week. It was fairly obvious who would've been the one to offer up that information. It's possible that she could use the fulfillment of her debt to me as a defense, but knowing Iolo, that wasn't something to count on. 

Of course, as Reyna pointed out, her telling me all of that could've been his idea as well. But to what end? I don't know. I would think that would go against his goals, so I’m not entirely sold on that conspiracy theory. But in Reyna's defense and mine, it's hard not to overthink when it comes to dealing with him. 

For the Huntress' sake, I tried to be careful, “According to my research, the Hunt picks someone to act as their entertainment for the evening. Is it fair to assume that I was going to be the unlucky one?”

His eyes narrowed, a smirk playing his lips, “Your research told you all that, huh?” 

Technically, personal testimony counts as research. I hadn't lied to him. But I could tell he didn't buy it regardless. 

“You've been hunting me for a while,” I explained in an attempt to convince him. “And you said yourself that your king would probably take a liking to me. It's pretty clear what your end goal is.”

He still seemed skeptical, but thankfully, didn't push it. He admitted, “You were. ‘Til everything went tits up with that witch. So I gotta ask, why did you save me? I’ve been scratchin’ my head, tryin’ to figure out why ya didn't just let her finish the job. Woulda worked out a lot better for you.”

Deirdre’s lips pursed. I knew she felt the same way, but knew better than to say it right in front of him. 

“Because I didn't want you to die like that.” I responded honestly. 

Oddly enough, I think my response annoyed him, considering that he got sarcastic with me. 

“How altruistic of you, Fiona!” 

*What did he want me to say?* 

Deirdre gave my hand a gentle squeeze, sensing that he was getting under my skin. For a brief moment, his gaze darkened as he glanced at our clasped hands, but then the moment passed. Those eyes were fixed on my face once again.

“You're welcome, by the way.” I snapped. 

“Oh, I'm plenty grateful, Fiona,” The mechanic calmly replied. “If I weren't, I wouldn't be considerin' lettin’ you go right now.”

“If that happens, you’ll have to find someone to replace her, won't you?” Deirdre asked. 

“Yup. That's how it goes,” He said with a wicked grin, readjusting his shoulder again. “King can't get out much. Gotta show him a good time while he's here. It's a real shame, too. I was lookin’ forward to seein’ how you'd handle it.” 

“I’ve already found a replacement.” I offered, trying not to bristle at his words. “One of my coworkers.”

Eyebrows high, he snickered, “Some trouble at the office? Need me to take care of someone for ya?” 

“No.” I replied in the flattest tone I could manage, heart fluttering as my nerves began to kick up. “He volunteered.”

“He? Means either ol’ blue eyes or that new guy. Money’s on the new guy, though. For one, blue eyes is smarter than that. For another, I noticed the new guy tryin’ to look all big and scary at me the other day.”

For Wes’ sake, I hope he knows what he's getting into. Iolo had that same dark gleam in his eye that I'd noticed before he slaughtered those two aspiring monster hunters. 

On the bright side, at least that meant he wasn't going to shoot Orion’s plan down. 

His grin widened, “Gotta say though, Fiona. I'm surprised at you. Normally, you ain't the type to throw others under the bus.”

“I didn't throw him: he threw himself.” I retorted. 

“This how y’all treat your new employees? Trial by fire?” He clicked his tongue, clearly having fun being a pain in the ass. “Looks like I’m bein’ a bad influence on you!”

“You-”

“Let's not get sidetracked,” Deirdre cut in gently before I could argue further. “Do you agree that by shielding you from the witch in the gingerbread house that she has repaid her debt to you in full?”

Iolo looked her up and down, “Really tryin’ to cover all your bases, ain't ya?”

“Please answer the question.” She urged him politely. “And bear in mind, she and her colleagues even took the liberty of finding a replacement quarry for you, free of charge.”

“In a moment. Few things need clearin’ up first.”

“Such as?” I questioned. 

“I take it you're also wantin’ to be done with your training?”

“Actually, no.” I told him. “If you're willing to continue teaching, I'm willing to continue learning.”

As much as I hate to admit it, his sword lessons have helped. The incident with the Gray Man is evidence of that. I’d never had such an easy time taking one on before. And truthfully, I have a bad feeling that I’m going to need all the help I can get when it comes to the Dullahan as well as any other ‘visitors’ we may have in the future. 

Of course, I'd rather die than tell him that to his face. God, I'd never hear the end of it. (Oh, and horny jail inmates? Stop chewing on the bars of your enclosure. It's bad for your teeth.)

His eyebrows rose again, but this time, his demeanor wasn't mocking, “Fine by me.”

“So then you agree to the question I asked you before?” Deirdre confirmed, fully in lawyer mode. 

“I do.”

“Hold on,” I interjected. “Are you just going after one person or multiple?”

He redirected his attention back to me, “I got some appetizers lined up for him. But don't you worry. They're the worst types o’ humans. The types no one’ll miss. Ones that woulda ended up with us regardless.”

So that would buy us some time. It feels awful to think of other people that way, even if they are ‘the worst types,’ in his words, but at least now we know Wes will have some time once the sun sets before he has to start running. 

Deirdre then clarified, “So on the day that your king, the White Son of Mist arrives, you will lead him in a chase after the newly hired vampiric Orion employee. You will not seek out the Orion employee that you call Fiona on Samhain. Is this all understood?”

The asshole began to laugh, “Yeah, I'm understandin’ ya just fine, *caoineadh!*”

She gave him a withering stare, but continued, “And you will not inspire your king to seek her out either.”

“Well, ya see, I'm just a captain. I don't have any control over what my king does. If he just happens to find her on his own, there ain't shit I can do about it. But that bein’ said, *sure*. I won't do anything on that night to nudge him in her direction.”

Something about that sounded wrong. It was worded a little too specifically. 

I frowned, “Have you already ‘nudged him in my direction?’” 

His eyes slitted, “You know I've got eyes everywhere, Fiona. And all that the crows see, he sees. Those crows have seen you plenty. Enough that I know that the name you use around town is ‘Nessa.'”

That made my heart flutter. He never stopped looking for my name. Shit. 

He smirked before continuing, “Speakin’ of, should I be flattered or offended that ya gave me somethin’ different to call you?”

I didn't like that. Not one bit. I reassured myself that he still had no idea where my records were. I won't even say where they're hidden on the off chance a malicious party finds my account. I kind of figured that he’d never truly stopped searching, but it was something else entirely for him to say it out loud. 

But I needed to focus on more immediate threats. “So the king already knows about me?” 

“Now, don't get all scared. You ain't completely fucked just yet. As long as mosquito boy proves to be excitin’, that should draw the White Son of Mist’s focus. Least ‘til he has to return to Annwn. Better hope your boy is as tough as he thinks he is.”

“That's not very reassuring.” I retorted. 

His snicker added irritation to my growing anxiety, “Wasn't meant to be. But it's the best you can hope for.”

“Is that so?” Deirdre challenged. 

Even though his glare wasn't directed at me, I still felt scalded by it. His voice was all too calm as he said, “As a matter o’ fact, it is. Even if I could lie to my king, I wouldn't dare outta respect. Like I said, he already knows as well as you and I do that Fiona here is well worth the trouble. It ain't no secret I've been wantin’ her, but not so much to make me fuckin’ suicidal enough to try to get between ‘em, should the moment come up. Got any other stupid questions for me, *caoineadh?*”

Seeing the way her cheeks flushed instantly put me on the defensive, “Please don't talk to her like that.”

“Ya know, now that I’m thinkin’ about it, what stake do ya have in all this?” The mechanic went on, leaning forward, reminding me far too much of a cat about to pounce. “You’ve been there to save Fiona’s ass from the very beginnin’, now why is that? Love at first sight? Give me a fuckin’ break! She may fallin’ for your fairy princess act, but ya can't fool me.”

*What the hell is he talking about?*

“Is it so hard for you to believe that someone can be kind simply for kindness’ sake?” She argued, her voice soft. 

Iolo’s smile would've looked kind to someone who didn't know better, “I’ll bet you want to be able to lie even more than I do, *caoineadh.* That way, you could tell yourself that you're the gentle, kind-hearted person she thinks you are. I’d bet you'd lie to yourself ‘til the day you die.”

Was he just saying all of this out of jealousy? Or was there something else? *No.* Don't go there. He's just trying to sow seeds of distrust. 

But then Deirdre said with tears in her eyes, “I *try.*” 

His laugh made my blood boil, “I fuckin’ knew it!” 

“*That's enough!*” I shouted. 

With a sigh, Iolo rose from the ground. “As delightful as this was, I best get goin’. But just to make y’all happy, I’ll put it point blank: I hereby release the woman formerly known as Fiona Cassidy from her life debt. And come Calan Gaeaf, Samhain, Halloween, whatever-name-you-want, I’ll be directin’ the Hunt towards Orion's ‘lil bloodsucker. Hell, I’ll even be nice and let you off the hook for trainin’ tonight.”

The fucker then winked at me before telling me he'd see me the next day. 

As he turned, I shocked Deirdre by seizing her hagstone, holding it to my eye so that I could see for myself what damage had been done to him. I had just enough time before he disappeared to catch a glimpse of the prosthetic wings. 

What looked to be dark red branches grew from his back, extending from the same place where his natural wings had been. The branches imitated the shape of them flawlessly, the length and span exactly proportional to the two that remained. The membranes of those prosthetic wings, however, were completely transparent rather than bearing an iridescent sheen, save for the dark, veiny webbing interlaced throughout them. 

Once we were alone, my first thought was to check on Deirdre. He'd really laid into her. I kneeled in front of her, seeing plainly on her face that he'd clearly touched more than a few nerves. 

“I don't believe a word he said, you know?” I assured her. “You've never given me any reason to distrust you.”

Deirdre confessed to me then that he was right. That she's been trying not to hate Iolo or the Hunter that took the butcher, saying that she doesn't like the way it feels. How the loathing seemed as if it was eating at her heart. 

“I can't stand the way that hating them feels,” She muttered, eyes bright as she tried not to cry. “But I've watched him hurt and force his will upon you time and time again. I can't stand it. *Any* of it!”

So that's what that was about. 

She continued, shaking her head, “I just wish they'd leave you alone. That's it. Even if it meant doing something… My word. I shouldn't think that way.”

“I know how you feel,” I told her. “I know how it feels to want someone gone. It feels like swallowing acid.”

She agreed. 

“I know better than to try,” Deirdre muttered. “I know that getting rid of that Huntsman would do more harm than good. I just… I just wish he'd leave you alone.”

I tried to lighten the mood, “If it makes you feel any better, I think you trying to be nice to him made him die a little inside.” 

She chuckled through her tears, “Perhaps I could kill him with kindness.”

“Let's not let him ruin our date, okay?” I said, standing up, offering my hand to help her up. 

Once she'd calmed down a bit, we found our way back into the corn maze. The rest of our time together was peaceful. Hot apple cider helped. Hot apple cider fixes everything.

The last few days have been filled with preparations, despite Samhain still being a good two weeks out. However, given all that we're contending with, there's a part of me that wonders if we should've started prepping even earlier. 

On my end, I've done some homework on the Dullahan. While powerful, it has its weaknesses just like anything else. Precious metals such as gold seem to repel it, which is all well and good, except for the fact that I'm a bit broke. I did just have to buy a new-used vehicle, after all. I'll be checking thrift stores to see if someone managed to donate real gold by accident. 

My other, more risky idea is to try to get the Dullahan’s head away from it. Which… yeah. That’ll be fun. So let's hope that the gold idea pans out. 

As for the Dead Duo’s preparations, Victor mentioned that it would probably be best if they found somewhere to hole up that was far away from the rest of town. Deep in the countryside, there is an abandoned barn from a farm that burned down a while ago. To this day, no one is sure how the fire started. Considering that everyone got out alright despite it reducing the house to ashes, there are rumors of insurance fraud. But that's not important. What matters is that the barn is still intact and separated from any potential bystanders.

We hid the three extra hagstones Deirdre had found prior to our showdown with the Cookie Hag within the old barn as well as massive containers of salt. We picked spots that most animals wouldn't be able to reach, keeping these items close to each other so that Wes and Victor would be able to reach them with ease. 

Our hope is that with having the time to prepare, unlike most of the Wild Hunt’s victims, they'd be able to beat the odds. 

I kept an eye out for crows, now paranoid that we were being watched after that shit the mechanic said. I couldn't see any. Neither could anyone else. 

However, Reyna did notice an owl. 

It was a large animal. Its massive wings were covered in brown feathers. Its ear tufts stuck out proudly from its head like a pair of horns. The owl seemed especially focused on Wes, those orange eyes fixed on him while he and Cerri were busy with trying to reinforce one of the barn doors. 

Reyna apprehensively tried to approach the owl, “Uh… hi?”

It flew away. 

Okay. 

She and I shrugged at each other. It might've been just a regular old owl. We get them around these parts. But still, something was peculiar about it. However, her hagstone hadn't reacted to it. If it was atypical, it didn't mean us harm. 

On a lighter note, through a collective effort, we did manage to sucker Victor into letting us have a small Halloween party at the office, since the actual day of Samhain is going to be fraught with danger. 

I'd joked in the comments of one of my other posts about dressing up as Victor. I *absolutely* delivered. I'd found some blue contacts (they were awful), a dark wig that I thought looked like his hair color, and a bandana. I wore all of that with my typical Orion uniform, then that was that. 

To be clear, this isn't going to be my official Samhain disguise. I'll be donning a full mask for the big day. This was just to screw with the boss. 

Reyna absolutely lost her shit when she saw me. She couldn't even speak from laughing so hard. To be fair, I *did* look ridiculous. 

Cerri almost choked on her drink, sputtering, “Ten out of ten! No notes!”

Meanwhile, Wes' grin and eyes went huge as he called Victor into the room. 

I tried to keep a straight face long enough to imitate The Glare. But the moment I saw Victor’s reaction, my lips were twitching and my stomach hurt from trying to hold it in. 

Now face to face with the Dollar Tree version of himself, Victor was shaking his head, stifling a smile as he said, “You're so… You're… I don't know what you are, but you're *something!*”

I sobered, trying once again to fix my face into the look of annoyance that I'm so used to receiving from him, trying to mimic his voice, “I have a Vitamin D deficiency.”

“You're fired.”

“No, *you* are.”

By this point, Reyna regained the ability to talk, managing to get out, “This is ridiculous!”

As far as the real shit goes, we’re still not done preparing. We’ll be gathering more weapons as well as trying to ward off the barn as much as possible. In the meantime, I’ll be searching for gold pieces that won't cost an arm and a leg. 

I just hope it'll be enough.
