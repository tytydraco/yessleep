————————————————————————————


I suppose I owe you an explanation. The year was 1994, and I was only 27 years of age. I had recently moved to the small, quiet town of Oakfiekd from the hustle and bustle of LA. I settled in nicely. I managed to find a job with the Oakfield PD, and soon I was assigned to Homicide. I proved myself to have a knack for solving crime.

I found the first body, washed up on the bed of the river. Immediately I could tell that there were 3 gunshot wounds on the body.  In the lab I also noticed marks on the neck from apparent strangulation, as well as residue on the wrists and ankles where the victim had seemingly been duct taped to something. 

What was strange is that there were 2 sets of bite marks, 2 sets of fingerprints, and 2 separate hair samples. One set of bite marks was very clearly human, however the other set was not. It was very large, rounded, and the canine marks penetrated far deeper than a human jaw would. The fingerprints and hair samples had been identified as belonging to a man named Victor White. The other sets of prints and hair remained totally unidentified. 

The very next morning another body, a 17 year old male was found in the back of a 2000 Chevy Camaro. The body had been mauled to death, and at first myself and the forensics team figured it was by a bear or other large predator. But I soon noticed that the body had the exact same bite pattern as the first body. Not the human one, the other one. The one definitively not human. The strange thing about this one is that the prints, hair or anything else belonging to Victor were not found in the body. I figured that this one was likely an animal attack, but I also knew that someone, not something had placed the body in the trunk.

Later that night I went to the scene of the crime and found a set of prints all over the car. 2 sets, actually. One set was the boy’s, identified as Dylan Watson. The other set was Victor White’s. in my eyes this meant that something, some large animal had killed Dylan, and then Victor had shoved it in the trunk or something like that. The only prints I could find on the steering wheel, door handle, stuff like that was of Dylan’s, so that meant that Victor did not drive the car to or from the crime scene. 

3 days later we got him. Someone had caught him shoplifting razor blades, duct tape, and latex gloves from a hardware store, and called the police. During booking, I had printed him. They positively Identified as Victor. 

Myself, police chief Darryl Hoss, and the attorney Richard Miller were standing behind the one-way mirror glass. Victor was a tall man with short hair and a short beard. His eyes were an eerie yellow, and his skin was just… off. In fact, his whole body was off the closer I looked at it. His eyes were slightly off center, he had 4 fingers on one hand, his nose and lips were slightly crooked, and his skin looked real leathery. It made my skin crawl.

The officer inside was questioning him. 

“Do you know what you did?” the officer said.
 
Victor laughed in the creepiest way I could imagine.

“Victor, why did you do what you did?”

Victor stopped laughing and leaned in.

“Because, I have a little, bitty secret inside of me.”

He threw his head back and laughed maniacally again. The officer looked at the one-way glass and shook his head defeatedly.

“I will kill ALL OF YOU!” Victor screamed between laughing. 

I looked over at chief Hoss. 

“2 bodies, 2 savage attacks, doesn’t leave much room for doubt.” The chief said in his gravely voice.

“Captain this is textbook psychosis,” the attorney said. “Doesn’t excuse his actions, but…” 

The attorney trailed off.

“The guys a fucking looney,” I said in a hushed whisper. 

“If he’s found competent to stand trial, and that’s a big if, the jury might accept an insanity plea.” 

The attorney said in a hushed whisper. 

“There’s no way, I’m not gonna let this freak get off like that. Hell, if this damned state had the death penalty I’d push for that. If only.”

The attorney and the chief nodded in agreement. I looked at the captain with a stern look at my face. Inside the room Victor was still laughing.

“ the lawyer is going to do a psych evaluation, then he’s all your’s, Grant.”

I looked in the room, nodding.

Late that night I was driving home in my car. I was very tired from the long day, and as you probably know driving like that doesn’t usually end well. Figuring that I did not want to crash my car into a tree and explode, I decided to pull to the edge of the road next to the forest, lock the doors and turn off the engine, and try and sleep. 

I awoke to the sound of air hissing from outside the car. Immediately I got outside and checked. All four of my tires had been slashed open, but not by a knife. Around car were very faint footprints. The prints were probably about 16 inches long, with 4 toes on each foot. Sound familiar? I looked around the woods, scanning for anything. I noticed that it was completely quiet out. There were no crickets chirping, no birds, hell even the wind wasn’t blowing. I started breathing more as my heart pumped faster. 

I was whipping my head around, looking for anything I could find when my eyes caught something that made my stomach drop. Way out in the blackness of the forest, I saw 2 pairs of white dots that were unmistakably eyes. To my horror, they stood probably close to 7 feet off the ground. It just stood there, staring me down before it started walking towards me.

Immediately I leaped in my car and hid under the dash board. I was panicked now, and breathing so fast and so loud that I had to put my hand over my mouth to stop myself from making too much noise. The thing walked in circles outside around my car for close to 10 minutes. Then, I could hear its claws scratching against the side of the car. It was writing something. After it was finished with whatever it was doing, it just left. It galloped back into the forest, and soon the sounds of the wind, the bugs, and the birds came back.

I hid under the dashboard until well after the sun came up. At that point I cautiously got out. After seeing that there was nothing around, and that the morning birds were chirping I calmed down. That’s when I walked over to the side of my car, and once again my stomach dropped.

Whatever that thing was, it carved my full legal address into my car, as well as a smiley face. I called a tow, and explains to him that some teens had vandalized my car. I tried to remain calm. I did not have the money to move at all, so I invested in a guard dog, a nice big Belgian shepherd, and a shotgun. This was my experience with the events of June 1994, and I honest to god wish I never had them. I told the Oakfield PD that I was resigning effective immediately. As I write this, I have a growing feeling that that thing is still out there, and I can’t help but draw the connection to Victor White. Maybe it’s the lack of sleep, I don’t know. 

But I have a strong suspicion that it, or he, will be back.
