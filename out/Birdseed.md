My Memaw was a nurse.  She started in the Cadet Nurse Corps during WW2.  After the war, she became an RN and spent the next 12 years working at her local hospital, mostly on the cardiac floor, but other parts, too, if they needed her.  She loved her job, but something bad happened with one of the doctors she worked under and she saw no choice but to move on to elsewhere.  Her next job was at a long-term care facility (a nursing home, to the uninitiated), where she worked for a lot of years until her retirement.

My Papaw died before I was even thought of, so I never knew him outside of pictures and the stories my Momma told me.  Memaw didn't say much about him, but she never minded Momma talking about him.  A few years after he passed, Memaw met a lady who waitressed at her favorite restaurant, Clovie, and Memaw and Clovie lived together for the rest of Memaw's life.  Due to the times and it being the very Baptist South, everyone understood but still, they were "roommates".  They did very well and kept the little farm my Memaw and Papaw had bought in the family.  They were even able to hire farmhands so they could both focus mostly on their own careers.

Memaw had a lot of stories about strange goings on at the hospital and at the nursing home.  Even some she mentioned existed but said she'd never repeat.  I'd like to share one now that touched my heart a bit, so if you're looking for something terrifying, this'll probably be boring for you.

This one happened at the nursing home where she worked, and she was in her early 30s at the time.  They had a resident, a man named Thomas.  Thomas could talk but usually didn't.  He was a slow-moving man who liked to wheel himself around and be at least an hour early to any meal or activity.  He couldn't dress himself or tell you if he needed to pee or not, and she would laugh and tell about how she'd have to change his pants at least once per shift because she could never quite get his toileting schedule down and he had what she called "a five-gallon drum for a bladder".

And, as my Memaw always pointed out in this part of the story, the good die young.  Nellie was only 23 when a drunk driver hit her head-on as she was on her way home, having stopped off at the grocery store after her shift.  It was bad enough to be a closed-casket funeral.  But according to Memaw, Nellie wasn't REALLY gone.   first, their maintenance guys took on the birdfeeder responsibility, but after a few months, they decided they didn't have time and wouldn't be doing it anymore.  One of the nurse's aids that worked with Memaw, Nellie, decided she'd take up the cause, so anytime Thomas's bird feeders got low, she'd bring his bag of birdseed out and refill them.  Thomas would get a little down when he couldn't watch his birds at the feeders, so when Nellie took on the responsibility, everyone was glad to see him perk back up.

Nellie took this seriously, and never let those birdfeeders run out.  Memaw said she was a very sweet young woman and seemed to love nothing more than doing that little something extra to make the residents happy.  She was reliable, always a few minutes early to her shift, and always happy to help her residents and her co-workers.

But according to Memaw, Nellie wasn't *really* gone.

They asked around, even asked the night shift folks, whether or not anyone had filled it, but no one said took ownership.  At first, my Memaw thought someone just didn't want to speak up, perhaps thought they'd make the others mad for taking over Nellie's task so soon after her passing, but months and months went on in which the birdseed would disappear a little at a time from Thomas's room and reappear in the birdfeeders.  No one seemed to know who was doing it, and after a bit they all started to joke that it must be Nellie's spirit tending to Thomas's birdfeeders.   room and looked out his window, but returned to the nurses and said they were already full.

No one seemed to know who was doing it, and after a while, they all started to joke that it must be Nellie's spirit tending to Thomas's birdfeeders.

About eight months after Nellie's death, Thomas died from a severe case of being 99 years old.  His kids decided they'd donate the birdfeeders and leave them where they were, and they left the birdseed in his closet.  The feeders kept on getting filled, and still, no one would take the credit for it.  It wasn't long before a new resident moved into Thomas's room, and she enjoyed the birdfeeders outside the window, as well.  But without Thomas's kids constantly restocking the seed, the supply in the closet eventually ran out.

That's when the closet door started misbehaving.  The new resident would often complain that her closet door must be broken, because it would open and close on its own, sometimes really hard.  The staff had no trouble believing it, because it was a loud slamming.  Then a couple of housekeepers complained that anytime they hung the new resident's laundry in the closet, the door would slam shut again before they could close it themselves.  One said that she was just mopping on the other side of the room when the door threw itself open and then shut.  Before long, almost everyone working there had witnessed this closet door banging open or shut with no one's assistance.

They all seemed to find it interesting and novel at first, but before long everyone was pretty annoyed with it.  Memaw said a few of them went into the room and asked Nellie to please stop, and the reply was always the door slamming itself open or closed, sometimes in rapid succession.  They even called a preacher at one point to pray, but even he was met with only the slamming closet door.  They moved the new resident out of the room because she wasn't able to rest for that door.

Then one day, my Memaw and one of her fellow nurses were chatting about that closet door over their lunch and it occurred to them that the big change was the lack of birdseed in the closet to keep the feeders filled.  After work that day, Memaw stopped on her way home and bought a bag, and the next day she opened it up and put it in that closet.

Sure enough, the closet didn't open or close on its own and the birdfeeders would be filled.  As an experiment, they let the new bag run out and didn't replace it at first.  The closet door started back to misbehaving, and when they put a new bag of birdseed in, all was quiet.  From then on, they all took turns making sure the supply never ran out, and they never had to hear the slamming closet door again.  The feeders would be full and no one knew how, but any resident who lived in that room after always had two full feeders and birds outside their window.
