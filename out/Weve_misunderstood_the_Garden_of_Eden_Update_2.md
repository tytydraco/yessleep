I'll be honest, I don't know if I'm going to make it out of here. I want to, and I'm going to fight to make it out, but I'm so fucking tired.



I don't even know how long it's been. A few days maybe? My phone isn't even providing a date anymore, just a bunch of zeroes. I've been thinking hard about that snake, and I'm trying to tell myself to not trust it. I know what that snake probably means, but I'm getting desperate. Today almost fucking broke me.



I had been resting by a small pond, it was peaceful. Frogs sang Latin hymns in their croaks, and the birds cried in worship. I've been on guard the whole time I've been here, and this morning was the first time I actually let myself close my eyes and be at peace.



So, there I sat, eyes closed, listening to the music around me, when suddenly I heard more sounds. Sounds that I hate being familiar with. A lion’s roar, the ox’s bellow, the eagles cry, and that voice. The voice from my first day here.



*“Pen yishlach yado velakach gam me'etz hachayyim ve'achal vachai le'olam”*



But it was different now. Before it droned on like it was just reciting an order. Now, it almost sounds frantic. It groaned, a voice older than time, older than the stars. Frantic yes, yet magnificent, as if the cosmos itself had been compressed into these words. This command. This warning. I got up, half drowsy, and began to try walk away. I don't know why I thought it would work, but my idea was "if I don't draw attention, it won't notice me". Then again it bellowed.

  
*“Pen yishlach yado velakach gam me'etz hachayyim ve'achal vachai le'olam”*



I sprinted. I ran as fast as my legs could carry me, yet it seemed pointless. It seemed like it was equidistant to me, always the same distance. I could feel its eyes on me. Two eyes from a lion, two from an ox, two from an eagle, and two from a human. Its wings beat in tandem, the air moving to allow their flexing. Then I felt the heat again. Burning. The light shone so brightly it lit up the way ahead of me. The sword of flame, held by the Cherub.



Then I realised. God placed Cherubim with flaming swords. Cherubim, the plural of Cherub. This may not be the same creature from day one. I ran faster and harder, my muscles flared with the fires of hell, straining as I pushed them beyond their capabilities.



The voice grew distant, almost like the Cherub was slowing down. I didn't slow down though. I ran and ran until my lungs were spewing fire into my throat, burning it raw. After what felt like almost an hour, I slowed, gasping desperately for air. No heat, no air compressing to allow movement, nothing.



I sat down on the ground, the damp grass cooling me. I could smell something nearby, and it took me a minute to work it out, but then it hit me.

  
Salt water.



I've seen nothing but green fucking fields and trees the whole time I've been here. Any water has been streams and ponds. This was new. I began crawling my way to the source of the smell, the briny smell flooded my nose, luring me towards hope. But as I crawled I saw something shining in the brush ahead of me.



Black scales slithering across the earth in front of me. Scales, with gills lining it. This beast coiled into itself, yet stretched beyond my sight. Liquid fire seemed to drip out of a closed snout in the distance, its head licking out and touching me. A snakelike shape with lizardlike limbs, each strong yet graceful. Serrated growths jut out from its underbelly, barely visible as it rips the earth up in its wake. I see its eyes in the distance, glowing like the dawn. 



Instinctively, and idiotically, I grabbed a nearby stone and hurled it at the monstrosity, and the rock crumbles like oatmeal.



A deep groan rattled out from the writhing mass. 



Deep.



The depths. It was then I knew what I was seeing. Leviathan. The sea serpent that was the embodiment of primordial chaos and the depths.



I don’t mean to get all lecturer on you, but there’s a common misconception about the bible. God didn’t just create out of nothing. Genesis 1:1 is what’s called a temporal clause. “*When* God began to create the heavens and the earth, the earth was chaotic and void.” 



The spirit of God hovered over the depths.



These depths existed before God created, and in them lived the beast Leviathan. God had to defeat Leviathan for life to function. And it’s in my way.



I approached the beast, cautiously and slowly while cursing myself for throwing a rock at it. A low rumbling emanated from within the mass of darkness, almost like a cats purr got corrupted. I knew this thing wasn't evil. It was a force of nature. It slithered and crawled, moving yet stationary. The razor-like blades on its underbelly turned up the dirt and brought forth worms and all manner of insects. But I wasn't afraid. Leviathan is the depths, the ocean. It meant I was close to this new area.



It doesn't seem to mind my presence, and there hasn't been a sign of the Cherub for a few hours now. I think I'm going to wait here for a while. My sides still burn. But there is a few issues.



I can't feel my left arm. It's not a heart attack, it's almost like pins and needles. When I tap it I hear the sound but feel nothing. But I can feel my wrist, and the scar that's still absorbing light. The arm is also looking thin, almost like it's losing its extra tissue. My tendons are visible, and my veins are forming a bumpy maze through my skin. I don't know if it's irony or something else, but I prayed. I begged God for help, to heal my arm, but nothing. My mind goes back to the snake. Yes, it was probably talking about the tree of knowledge of good and evil, but there was another tree in the story.



The tree of life, and whoever eats its fruit will live forever. It's tempting, but something in me screams it's a bad idea. Once I've rested and properly caught my breath I'm going to keep trying to make my way to the salt water. If the sea really is ahead, maybe that’s freedom. Or maybe I’m walking into another beast.
