Ah yes clones, duplicates, doppelgangers or whatever you want to call it, 

Just like the Clones from Star Wars: Clone Wars, the Rick and Beth Clones from Rick and Morty, or the Spiderman Clones made by Doc Ock, and it's mind boggling science behind it which baffled scientists that it could be achievable if the technology is advanced enough to be able to duplicate cells in mere seconds, but what if at some point you start to realize if you are one.

Hi I'm Andrei (16m) and going to try to keep my personal life a bit classified to everyone reading this.

I live in a suburban neighborhood in East Asia, after the terrifying experience i had in 2016 when Hurricane Yolanda hit the country with strong winds and heavy rain which destroyed our house, but yeah i live in a middle class household, my school is just a 10 min drive away from where I live, i live with 2 of my youngest siblings, my mother is a breadwinner of the family and my father quit his job abroad and i take care of four dogs, some fish and birds. 

Ok enough chit chat and let's continue the story. At the beginning of September in 2022, i have been getting ignored and avoided by my classmates lately and i asked one of my friends,

"you guys weren't like this before what's wrong, did i do something wrong to offend you guys in any way?"

One of them said "you followed us again!", 

"what?"

"Yeah, we saw you following us again, you were walking at first then you started sprinting and when we turned around you vanished"

"But I immediately went home after the last class"

"We have pics and video evidence of you chasing us" 

When I looked at the photos and videos, i couldn't believe my eyes, it was me but the videos and photos were a bit blurry so i couldn't see it properly but still, it really is me, it was wearing the hoodie but it had no bag.

I was confused and shocked by what i saw, and my class president said that she already reported it to the principal and now I'm being asked to explain why I'd follow them again even though i wasn't there.

So there i went and i didn't expect my dad to show up, he had that look of confusion too, so i answered a few questions, gave them proof that i was at home playing games on my phone and what not, and they believed it, so she called our class president and told her everything and she apologized from what she said earlier and must have mistaken me for someone else that day. 

But deep inside i knew that she wouldn't accept what she heard so she still kept ignoring me and so did the rest of my classmates but good thing i still have friends from my class that believed i was innocent and one of them showed that i was online in a game at 4:30 pm. 

So i showed it to my classmates and they believed me, and so did my class president so they all forgave me from what happened and said that they must've seen someone else.

After that I kept on thinking on my way home "how was that possible, i was home by the time school was over, there's got to be an explanation for this?" 

But then just across the street right by the metal workshop, i saw a hooded figure with the same designs as my hoodie that i was wearing at the time, buying some metal sheets, as he looked in my direction i was surprised to see that it was me, the same face shape, the same scars on the right hand, and so i chased him and just as soon as he turned a corner he disappeared like thin air.

When i was at home i couldn't stop thinking about him, i didn't sleep that night, but as a highschool student it's basically normal for us students to sleep late and just like one, i got used to not sleeping early.

On the night of Feb 24 2023 after prom night, i tried to walk home when i was hit by a motorcyclist and was sent to the nearest hospital.

After a whole month of being in a coma i finally woke up to my parents sobbing and my siblings asleep on the chairs along with a bandaged right eye, they were both worried and scared that they thought that i was going to die.

Within those months i asked my parents for my phone and it was a good thing i put it in the left pocket of my bag before i left after prom, it was still in good condition.

On my phone it was spammed with quite a lot of messages from my classmates with again pics and videos of me being in a restaurant, in a park, but the most terrifying of it all was that they took a pics of me just sitting in my seat in class and some other photos of me outside of the school campus.

"What the hell is going on?"
