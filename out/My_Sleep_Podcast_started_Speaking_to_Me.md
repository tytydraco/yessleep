I've always had trouble sleeping, I tried every remedy and none of them really worked. After consulting my Therapist He recommended a sleep podcast that has done all his ex-patients wonders. He Flashed his Sharply white teeth that nearly illuminated his Black Tuxedo, He said to look up A podcast by the name of "As You Drift" Hosted by a charismatic narrator known by the name of Indy Davids. 

Later that Night I went online and found the Podcast and It started Beautifully, I could hear crickets, a pond, and soothing music, a voice started to talk. 

It was all the regular Sleep podcast things, "Let yourself feel one with the world" or "breath slowly at your own pace, I thought it was another failed Remedy at my sleepless nights, Until he told me to "let go."

I woke up 9 hours later and just in time for work feeling well rested for the first time in 20 years, It Was a Miracle! I couldn't believe that I drifted off just because of two simple words.

The rest of my day was business as usual, I got home and peeled off my shoes and hopped into bed being excited to go to sleep for the first time in so long. 

I loaded up the episode I left it on and I must have slept through a good 3 episodes as I was already on episode 4,  The same crickets chirped and the pond splashed with life, I heard Indy speak again..... but something was wrong, there was a voice behind his.

I chalked it up to being my phone Glitching again, $30 phones tend to do that but I can't complain. As I started to drift I heard him say "Get him, Now" And the crickets stopped chirping, The soothing music stopped as well and all I was left with was the creek flowing.

I heard what sounded like footsteps as I scrambled to pause the podcast. "What the fuck?!?" I screamed. Realizing it was very late I quickly shut up and rewound the podcast, There was The creek, The crickets, And the music.

The message that was left to me was Nowhere to be found, I must really be tired, Maybe it was a Nightmare. Whatever it was I had to ignore it, I have a busy day ahead of me.

I wake up as the Same time as yesterday, or at least I thought it was yesterday, because when I checked my phone it was 3 days later and I was starving, my mouth was dry and my neck was so sore. I had a total of 18 missed calls all from my work, threating to fire me if I didn't show up today and talking about how unprofessional this was.

Once I got to my work I tried to explain my story but no one would listen, They all acted like I was crazy and thought I was doing drugs because according to them I was, "Incredibly pale" I was forced to leave work early that day and they kept pushing me to go to a rehab even though I've never done drugs.

I went to bed as soon as I got home, I couldn't stand using my legs and my neck was throbbing, I couldn't breath easily and it felt as If I was buried under quicksand. I started drifting to sleep as my phone turned on, playing a familiar creek, crickets, and music.

I felt powerless to move, I fell asleep and began to experience nightmares, foreboding visions that echoed the fears of my day. I dreamt that thousands of cats were biting my neck with their sharp teeth biting through my veins, I couldn't scream.

I woke up immobilized, and I saw someone in the corner of my room. I was starving and blood was everywhere on my sheets. I ask the pitch black figure how long it's been and he holds up 8 fingers, flashing his bright white teeth, sharp edges emerged from the corners of his mouth, I couldn't tell if it was a smile or his teeth for a moment, until I saw the red wrapped around them.

He closed my blinds slowly and walked out fast enough for me not to notice anything besides his Black Tuxedo which of itself was very had to see. He started speaking to no one saying "make sure its 20 hours from now, I'm still hungry" he walked away as my phone came to life.

I heard the same voice from my phone, wrapped in whispers as it barely screeched out "you will start to feel heavy, your limbs will be stuck and you will feel as if your sinking, you are very tired"

The whispers grew louder, intertwining with the peaceful melodies and haunting my dreams. A growing sense of paranoia consumed mr as i wondered if my sleep was still my own, if this was a nightmare, or if this was really happening.

The line between reality and nightmare blurred, and I, who had once found solace in the sleep podcast now trembled at the mere act of listening. I was able to wake up enough to pause the podcast but can barely move, I'm typing this now with all my strength.

Please, do not let your mind Drift as mine has.
