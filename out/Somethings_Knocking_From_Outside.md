There's something outside and whatever it is knows I'm in here, typically when someone knocks on my window it's to get inside, my dorm is to the back entrance and often people forget their keys and I typically ignore them, especially now with it being so cold but it's too late for anyone to be out. This has happened every weekend since January and unfortunately every weekend my roommate leaves to go home because he has the fortune of living near his family. 


When I tried telling him he just thought it was some sort of hallucination or some other bullshit. I might be an insomniac but I'm not schizophrenic or paranoid, well maybe I WASN'T paranoid before this fucking thing kept knocking. The knocking always begins at 2AM and ends at 3 which if you're as unlucky as me then you're awake, hearing the person above you yell at their monitor. 


Jesus I didn't come here to bitch I came here to talk about this knocking. Then I again me talking about the damn thing is bitching isn’t it? Whatever. Anyway, I'm afraid to pull back my curtain it's a blackout and well it's dark so I can't see any silhouette or nothin' just sometimes when it stops knocking I can hear a low growl, It doesn't sound like any creature I can think of, one day I tried to research the growls of certain animals like coyotes or a mountain lion maybe a wolf. 


I don't even think wolves are in this part of Ohio. What the hell was I thinking? Just, looked it up, no, there isn’t. Christ.


It spoke, for a brief second, right as I was finishing the last paragraph, I heard it speak. I swear to God. I took a bit of a breather. And took a break.  It couldn't have spoken, the knocking has now resumed but I swear I thought (and I mean THOUGHT) it said "Enter" but spaced out like “En..Ter.” Out of all the words, why "Enter?" Is it cold? Was it telling me to enter? Enter what?  Does it want to come in? Or does it want me outside? 


Knock on someone else's goddamn window then, I’m not doing either of those fuck you demon.  But yeah I couldn't find an equivalent and now that I'm starting to hear things maybe I am paranoid, maybe I just need to sleep through this. It'll be gone before I wake up anyway. But I'm out of melatonin and meds, there's no chance I'm sleeping easy tonight, I'm gonna have to go in and fight my bed like usual. 


When I told my family about it they were just as dismissive, "Must just be your meds" or something along those lines. I haven't even gotten my refill for the past month because work refuses to put me on, if only I could see another 100+ dollar paycheck my life would be saved. Maybe I should record it. Maybe if I had proof, they'd actually believe me. But would they even care? Mom hardly believed the doctor when I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a kid.


 I did however talk to my friend who's also in college out back home. He's a bit of a nut and believes in the paranormal and folklore, and all of that, so I figured he had a good idea of what I might be up against. Our conversation went something like this: 


"Hey man," he let out a deep yawn, it was obvious that I had woken him up.


"What's up?"


 “Can’t sleep." 


"Guessing you're already outta your stuff so we'll breeze past that, is someone knocking in the background?" 


"That's what I called you about, there's something outside my window dude and it's starting to freak me out."


 "Could be a skinwalker." 


Typically he would try to shorten it because you're "not supposed to say the name of it" but I guess he was just too tired. Never believed that crap. 


 "It's not a “skinwalker” dude that's stupid." 


"You never know,  could be a spirit or something from the lake, that’s my guess at what you could be up against. I'll let you know if I find anything though."


 "Thanks man. I really mean it.” 


"No problem, just try and get some rest." 


That was last weekend, and I'm thinking tonight I'll just let him rest. He mentioned something about an exam today, well I guess now yesterday so he must be KO'd by now. I really am all alone here, no roommate, no friends, just the potential demon outside my window and the snow. Maybe I should've gotten baptized when I got the opportunity, maybe that would get rid of it. It's almost 3AM. Finally, I just want this nightmare to end.


 I'm going to open the fucking blinds. I can't fucking do it anymore, It is now 3:10 and it ALWAYS leaves at 3  ON. THE. DOT. And the bastard is still knocking as if it knows that I'm finally writing about it and now it wants my attention and ya'know what it will, I am too tired to be scared. 


It left, as soon as I grabbed the curtain and pulled it back I heard a scurrying and it was gone. 


I looked in the ground and I saw a long path that had been carved out in the snow, it looked no thicker than maybe two or three inches. It looked like a tail because when I was little I had a pet snake and I know well what a slither pattern looks like so that's not it, but in that case, then why doesn't it have feet or paws or whatever?  


I know it has something that can knock and I doubt it could've just been banging its head into the window. And it might fucking speak if I really did hear that whisper, so what was it? I took a closer look and I realized that the path kinda ends randomly right before it headed into the parking lot. 


I just want a break from it all, what I would do for all of this to be over, if it's back tomorrow I'll let y'all know. But for now I'm going to try and get to sleep before my alarm goes off.
