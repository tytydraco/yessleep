I have a narrated version on my YouTube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2oRPo8BqwM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2oRPo8BqwM)

This story actually happened and it was disturbing to find out that my house was haunted without me even knowing, but here goes:

I used to live in a one story house in the suburbs of California. To give you a sense of the place, as you walked in the front door and you’d immediately see the living room with a small couch and tv and to the right, the kitchen, with a long hallway connecting it to the rest of the house, as you make your way down the hall there was a bathroom on left and a room to the right that my brother slept in. Once you got to the end of the hall the path forked, to the left was my bedroom and to the right my parents bedroom. It was a small house, but a lot happened. When I was young I always had a fascination with the paranormal, with ghosts, with spirits and I would often stay up late watching horror movies from a very young age. I watched Nightmare on Elm Street and The Exorcist by the time I was in third grade. However to my disappointment, the 13 years I lived in that house I had never had any paranormal encounters although I would always try make them happen whether it was trying to communicate with spirits, with a “Hello, is anyone here in the room with me right now?” at 2:00 a.m. when everyone had gone to sleep. I also once played with a ouija board. However to no avail. I just accepted that this house was simply not haunted. 

Years later I'm in the car with my mom and my dad and my brother and we're driving somewhere and somehow we get on the topic of ghosts and my mom very casually says oh yeah our old house used to be haunted and I'm like what? how do I not know about this? she said yeah we didn’t want to tell you but when we used to live there there was this boy. This little boy that my mom remembers meeting on two occasions, the first she had gotten up late at night to go pee. Our bathroom was located at the end of the long hall and as she exited her room, she saw what look like a 10 year old boy of asian descent with a buzz cut standing right down the hall from her outside what used to be my brother’s bedroom. In utter fear but also fight or flight, fight took over and she told the boy to stay away from my kids, and like a fever dream the boy the was gone. 

The second occasion my mom was home alone one afternoon by herself. She was doing chores around the house, tidying some leftovers in the kitchen, got around to cleaning our small livingroom and made her way to our small yard which was connected to the living room and when she open the sliding door out to the yard, she saw the same little asian boy, sitting in a foldable chair that had been propped up by one of us in our yard. However she didn’t panic, she could sense he meant no harm, of course she was startled but not terrified. At this very moment, as my mom was telling this story, my dad interrupts wait a minute, asian, 10 or 12, about this tall, with a buzzcut… I’ve seen him before! 

My dad said he was renovating our garage which is connected to the yard one afternoon, fixing up the flooring and converting the extra space into an extra guest room. The garage has always been really cold, abnormally cold. I’ve never liked to spend time there, but quite a few tenants have stayed there since, mostly older single men who worked the night shift. Anyway my dad was renovating the room and got tired and decided to take a nap on the old two person couch that was in the garage. He fell asleep and remembered waking up terrified, in a cold sweat, as he saw this exact same boy walking away from him. Chills shot down my spine as I heard this confirmation from my dad. My parents have no incentive to make these things up and the fact that their stories reaffirmed each other, made me feel spooked but also a tad jealous of their paranormal experience.
