I live on the outskirts of a small town in the heart of the desert. The town center is a haphazard collection of semi decaying buildings and my nearest neighbor is over a mile away across the dried and barren landscape, but the isolation suits me. I’ve lived a comfortable, quiet life here for years. Until yesterday.  
  
While storms are typical for this time of year as we’re halfway through our “monsoon” season, nothing prepared me for the fury and intensity with which yesterday’s thunderstorm would hit. The dark clouds crested the distant mountains late in the afternoon and within an hour had stampeded across the desert valley and were churning overhead. The wind picked up, hurling sand, dried vegetation, and small rocks across the yard at my house. Then the rain started.  
  
Instead of a slow and building trickle of rain, the clouds seemed to split open and dump all their contents at once. The water pounded against the windows. A blinding flash of lightning briefly illuminated my house followed immediately by a deafening crack of thunder that rattled everything inside. I quickly checked to make sure all of the windows were secured and glanced outside.   
  
The flow of water rushing across the glass almost completely obscured the view through most of my windows, but I could see fairly well for at least a dozen yards. The amount of water this storm was letting loose was unprecedented, and my first glimpse of the backyard through the pouring rain revealed rapidly growing rivulets of water running across it as it gently sloped towards the valley floor.   
  
The storm raged on for a few hours before calming to a moderate rainfall. It was late evening when I checked out through the window again. My backyard had been transformed from the morning’s dry and desolate patch of earth to a veritable wetland as the rivulets of water had coalesced into a shallow stream that stretched as far as my limited visibility allowed. Dried brush and debris rushed by, caught up by the flow of water and I watched for a few moments, taking in the dramatic amount of water that was now flooding the valley. In all my years of desert living, I had never seen a storm bring so much rain.  
  
Soon I noticed something else in the shallow, flowing water. There were small disturbances along the surface in a handful of locations across the visible part of my yard. Less than a foot in diameter each, the water in these spots had started swirling around as if being pulled into a hole or subterranean passage, like water into a bathtub drain.   
  
In one of the small whirlpools closest to me two spindly objects slowly rose from the swirling water. They elongated until they reached a height of three feet and stopped, twitching back and forth in the rain. Another pair of objects emerged, stretching upwards and growing before bending sharply downward to touch their tips to the surface of the water. Yet another pair followed suit, growing and bending down to join in probing the water beneath the first, undulating pair. I realized what they were. Antennae and legs.  
  
The two pairs of legs found purchase and strained as a tan, shiny head, slick with water and sporting a savage set of jagged mandibles, was pulled from beneath the water. A long, segmented body covered with countless legs poured out behind it. All across the yard legs began erupting from the swirling water, pulling more monstrous, three foot long, centipede-like creatures from their desert burrows. Soon about a dozen of them scuttled about the yard on their long, articulated legs, antennae waving in the wind and jaws snapping with anticipation.  
  
There was a yelp from the front of the house and I ran to another window to see. More creatures were emerging from the water in the front yard and across the street in the empty desert. Five or six of them had found a coyote and I watched, horrified, as a mass of segmented bodies and multitude of legs engulfed the crying animal. The creatures’ legs held down their prey as jaws tore into it, pulling away chunks that quickly disappeared into hungry mouths. It only took a few minutes for them to completely strip away and devour all the flesh. Then they started on the bones, powerful jaws crunching and snapping.  
  
When there was nothing left of the coyote the creatures dispersed, clambering over desert brush and flipping over small rocks in the water, searching and hunting for their next meal. I saw one pluck a bird caught in the flowing water and devour it whole. Another climbed a small Joshua tree and pulled cicadas from the bark with its many legs. They were ravenous and efficient, leaving nothing unsearched or uneaten.  
  
Suddenly one of the creatures hit the window and I shrieked. The thing heard me and furiously bit at the window screen, cutting through it with its sharp mandibles as easily as scissors. It tore off pieces of the screen and started to scratch and bite vainly at the glass, the skittering of legs and clicking of jaws audible above the sound of the rain.  
  
I couldn’t watch anymore and dropped the blinds. I turned away only to see another clawing at the window across the room. Tears streamed down my face as I ran through the house closing blinds, trying to shut the monstrous things from view.  
  
There was a *thump* at the front door followed by a frenzied scratching as legs scoured the surface. The unseen attacker found the edge of the door and started to try and work its claw tipped legs through the small gap. There was a chewing noise as the jaws assisted in trying to burrow through the barrier keeping it from its next meal. I knew if they somehow found their way into the house there would be no escape, no hiding from them. I grabbed a hammer from the hall closet and desperately started smashing the claws creeping their way inside. The broken ends pulled themselves back through the door jam and retreated. Breathing heavily I backed away and sank to the floor in the center of the living room to keep watch.  
  
I sat there for hours, shaking and clutching the hammer to my chest with white knuckles. The sun went down and the storm continued. I didn't dare turn on any lights as I feared it would attract more attention from the monstrous things. As I sat in the darkness all I could hear was the pattering of rain on the roof and the scratching of the creatures outside.  
  
The rain stopped around midnight. The scratching continued for a few hours before it too lessened and finally ceased. At dawn I dared a peek outside through the blinds. In the morning light I was able to look out across the desert. The water had drained away during the night and the sparse desert vegetation was flattened as far as the eye could see.  
  
I grabbed my hammer and cautiously crept out into the hot desert morning. A thick silence hung in the air. There were no bird calls, no insect noises. Nothing moved and there wasn’t even a breath of wind in the air. I edged my way across the yard towards the spot where the first creature had emerged. To my surprise there wasn’t even a hole left over from last night, no trace of those horrid things. I carefully tried to use the end of the hammer to dig around, looking for the hole. The ground was as solid as ever with just a thin film of dust that had been loosened by the torrential downpour yesterday. The only evidence that the creatures had really been there was the lack of any wildlife whatsoever and the faint scratch marks on my windows and doors.  
  
I plan to move before the next monsoon season. I can’t live here knowing what dwells beneath the desert, waiting for the perfect storm to open a way to the surface. I don’t know what those creatures were, and I never want to come across them again. All I know is don’t pray for rain in the desert. You don’t know what the rain will bring.
