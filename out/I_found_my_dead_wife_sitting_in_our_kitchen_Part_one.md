She fell back in her chair with exaggerated animation, the effects of her latest glass of red wine. She laughed but I couldn't remember what about. All I could see then and there was her beautiful smile. The same smile I'd fallen in love with over a decade ago. I kneeled by her chair and kissed her soft lips.

"What's gotten into you, Steve?"

"I just love you is all."

"Oh right, love. Not those." She pointed at the 4 empty beer cans by my recliner.

"I don't even know how those got there." We kissed again.



She poured herself another glass. 

"Are you sure that's a good idea?

"Lighten up, we are celebrating!"

"That's true. Ah, what the hell." A sharp crack filled the air as I opened another beer. If only I'd known what a mistake that was. 



"You're still going to put your hail Satan mugs in the closet tomorrow right? she'll be here in a few days." 

"You agreed to take me how I am when you married me, you know."

"I did, but my mom didn't. You know how religious she is."

"Trust me, I know. I remember a time when neither of us cared, not just me."

"She's my mom, Annie, please?"

"Fine, I'll put all my "sacrilegious" decor away. If, and only if, you get that damn fridge out of your truck."

"you're the best! I'll do it first thing in the morning."



The fridge was not coming out of my truck in the morning, it was probably never coming out without professional help. I have no earthly idea how I got it in there in the first place. The dimensions just didn't work. There is no possible way to wiggle it in or out of the door frame. Forcing it in there was a costly mistake that had cost us for months. But when you win a free fridge in a giveaway you take it. 



"I'm serious about the fridge."

"Me too."

"Why did you even take it? Why would we need two fridges."

"We've been over this, because it was free."

"Well, we've certainly paid a price. I'll never understand why you didn't just put it in the bed of your truck. You know, the whole selling point of owning a fucking truck."

I hated when she brought up that point, it felt unfair.

"You know I hate when you bring that up."

"I know you do pookums, I only say it because I'm serious. We don't know how long my car will be in the shop and I don't want to keep sharing the truck when we could just ride together. What if there is an emergency? Hell forbid."

We made devil horns at each other, but mine were a little less enthusiastic than normal. I knew she was right.



Annie glanced at the rich mahogany of our antique grandfather clock. She let out a sigh.

"Let's get another beer in you!" She pulled the 12-pack effortlessly off the ground. "Looks like we need another box."

"I think I'm good anyways."

"Come on, let loose Steve. You used to get blackout drunk every weekend."

"When I was in my 20s, yeah."

She hurried to the kitchen.



"Here, you can shotgun this one."

"She tossed me a beer and handed me a pairing knife."

"I'll do it over the sink."

I got up from my chair tipsier than I thought I'd be. The alcohol and my poor iron intake proved a devious duo. I tripped almost immediately, plummeting myself forward. Annie ran to my aid, at the same time I instinctually put my arms up to catch myself. My left hand collided directly with her chest. We made the realization at the same time.



"You stabbed me."

The black handle stuck out of her breast, it didn't feel real. "Oh my God I'm so sorry, are you okay!?"

"I think so." She grabbed the handle and yanked it out, blood spurted from the cavity.

"Wait don't You are supposed to leave it in so you don't bleed out."

"Shit, you're right."

She stuck the knife back in the hole and screamed.

"Annie why the fuck would you do that!?"

"You said-. You said." She collapsed.



I scooped her up in my arms and rushed to the truck. I flung open the passenger side door and the fridge mocked me. I cursed it before laying her carefully in the bed.

"Whole selling point of a truck right? I'm taking you to a hospital."

"Wait, take me to Aleister."

That was a bad sign, Aleister didn't sound anything like "a hospital". I jumped in and took off. Hoping the adrenaline had sobered me enough to drive.



I thought about calling an ambulance, but we live way out of town. By the time an ambulance got to us and got her back to a hospital she'd be gone. The old engine sputtered in protest as my right foot pressed into the floor. It had been taking abuse like this for almost 10 years without issue.



The flash of my hazards fought defiantly against the oppressive dark. There were no streetlights out here, my headlights acted as the sole bastions of vision. Up ahead I saw a rise in the road, the bridge. I slammed the brakes but it wasn't enough. I hit the rise going far too fast. The truck's front end bounced off the ground, then its back end followed suit. 



I swerved from left to right before skidding to a halt. I left out onto the pavement. Annie was gone. I grabbed the flashlight from my glove box. The light crept about the empty road. "Annie!" I screamed into the night. My stomach sank as I pieced it together in my head. I shined the flashlight over the guard rail. The murky water below still rippled. 



It couldn't have been real. None of it could've been real. I fell back against cool metal. Short sharp breaths fought their way out of my mouth. I felt for my phone. I hadn't even brought it. Instead I dug in the glove box and pulled out a high powered flashlight.



The flashlight illuminated a path down the rocky slope to the water's edge. It was steep and jagged. I was making my way over when a deep thumping broke into the air. The rhythmic beat of loud bass.  A pontoon boat was coming through the passage. I could hear drunken yells coming from it.



I screamed at them to stop. I clicked the light at them in Morse code. They'd see my signal and know I needed help. 

"Something's wrong with your battery, bro!" The shout carried over the water, barely audible. The boat barreled ahead.

"You have to stop now!" I shouted so loud my voice started to break.

"Can't hear you, bro!"



The boat passed directly under me. A dull thud erupted over the lake as the boat buckled slightly. The drunken jeers faded away eventually, leaving me alone in the dark. I don't know how long I sat there trying to get enough nerve to shine the flashlight again.



I took a deep breath and clicked the button. In a fraction of a second, my world was crushed. The water had a deep crimson hue. I vomited hot foam all over the road. Just like that, my wife's life was over, and as was mine.  I didn't want to go on without her. Even if I did, no one would believe my story. I would easily be sentenced for murder. I decided to go home and sleep in our bed one last time. Just to make sure it wasn't all a dream. 



Thoughts raced through my head without bound. The drive back was a complete blur. I just remember being in the driveway. I unlocked the door and fell against the living room wall. Everything began to twist and spin. The mind isn't equipped to deal with situations like that. The blood splatters a concrete reminder of the truth. 



An obnoxious buzzing reverberated through stagnant air. Annie's phone on the end table. It was being bombarded by calls and texts. I leapt on the chance to distract myself. I picked up the phone. 27 missed calls. Text notifications littered her screen. 

"Where are you?"

"You are late."

"We planned this for weeks? Where are you?"

They all came from the same contact, "Aleister Abcott." There was no profile picture. Their text history only started in the last hour. Had she been deleting messages? That name, she said it before she passed out. Confusion overloaded the heavy weight already weighing on my mind. 



Then came the straw that broke the camel's back. The most haunting sentence I've ever heard. 

"We are out of toilet paper!" Annie spoke from the kitchen. A light flickered on inside me for a fleeting second before blowing out. Reality hit. I was going crazy. I knew for a fact we had toilet paper. Fear radiated through my spine into my limbs. I made my way into the kitchen.



"Annie?" She didn't respond. She just sat there with this blank look on her face. Her mouth was open slightly and her eyes were low. I snapped my fingers, clapped, nothing. She wouldn't acknowledge me at all. I put my hand on her shoulder, she felt real. 

"I'm not taking on more responsibility without getting a raise." She spoke without altering her gaze or expression.



"Annie, what is wrong with you?" 

I grabbed her face and stared into her eyes. They looked vacant. I wrapped her in a tight hug. "I'm so sorry, Annie." I wandered out into the living room and collapsed. There's no way that was Annie. I saw what happened to her. 



That night was the most exhausted I'd been in my entire life. The events drained me. I left a piece of my soul out on that bridge. I laid down and sank into the couch. I knew I wouldn't move again for a while. 



Though my body had resigned itself to sleep, my mind hadn't. Without an ounce of energy left, it sputtered and bucked. Sporadic thoughts. Fragments. And flashbacks sparked through my mind. I was stuck halfway between dream and reality. 



Three hard pounds jolted me awake. My heart pounded in my chest. I was sure it was the police. I'd seen them in my dreams. I moved as fast as I possibly could to the door. I didn't stop once, not even to change clothes. The anticipation was torturous. 



My whole body shook with the thud of my heart. My hand jittered as I turned the knob. I didn't see a badge. A cool breeze washed down my neck. I felt almost euphoric seeing the strange man in front of me. He was taller than I felt like he should be. Lanky and oddly proportioned. Dressed almost entirely in black. Something told me my relief was misguided. 



"Good morning!" His warm smile raised the hairs on my neck. 

"Hey, can I help you?"

"I sure hope so, sir. I'm looking for a woman named Annie, I believe she lives here."

"I'm her husband." 

"Oh! Isn't that lovely. I need to speak with her."

"She's at work, sorry."

"Hmm, that's strange. She told me she'd be off today." 

"I don't know what to tell you."

"You know, you could start by telling me whose blood is all over your shirt."



Panic filled my bones and instinct took control. I tried to slam the door, but it caught on his foot. He flung me and the door backward with surprising strength. He stepped inside the house and looked me up and down.



"What did you do!?"

"Get out of my house!"

"Or what?"

"I'll call the police."

"Yeah, I bet you'll call the fucking police. You think they won't ask you the same question I did?" He loomed over me. Annie's voice shattered the tension like glass.



"You gotta listen to this song." 

We both stared at each other with wide eyes. 

"What the fuck." He muttered as he shoved his way into the kitchen. I was in total shock. I couldn't believe he could hear her too.



"Annie, Are you, okay? Annie, Are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?" She didn't react. He ran a pale hand through his dark hair, then gave her a little shake. There was nothing. Panic was written legibly across his face.



"This is bad. Do you have any idea what you've done? Of course you fucking don't."

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"Listen, I need you to be totally honest with me. Did you kill your wife yesterday?" 

The question slammed into me, almost knocking me down. His eyes grew wide with shock. 

"You fucking did, don't tell me you dumped her body in Briggon Lake." 

"How did you-? How did you know that?"

"Why!? Why did you kill her!?"

"I didn't mean to! I swear I didn't. It was an accident."

"An accident?"



His spine bowed like a cats as he leaned over onto my counter. 

"That fucked up the ritual. So much work wasted."

"Wait, ritual? What are you talking about?"

"Answer a question for me and I'll answer one for you. Why Briggon Lake?" 

"What?"

"I mean why did you dump her in Briggon lake? If it were an accident why do that? More importantly why that lake in specific. Why not somewhere else? Why not bury her or set her on fire?"

"Please don't bring up any more strategies. I was taking her to the hospital and she fell out of the bed of my truck."

"You mean she fell out and just landed in the lake by chance?"

He started to laugh but it stuck in his throat. He looked as though he'd realized something.



"I answered your question, now tell me about the ritual. Actually, tell me what's wrong with her."

"We've been working with each other for weeks. We meticulously followed a strict set of steps. It was supposed to culminate last night, but someone fucked it up. Of course the dark Gods didn't protect her spirit, you probably didn't even ask them to!"

"Why was she doing this? How did you meet her?"

"She wanted more out of life I suppose, she was bored. She wanted to taste the other side and she'd do anything to make that happen."



"You said I ruined it, what exactly did I ruin? What was supposed to happen?"

"I was supposed to kill her, not you. Then I was supposed to recite a sacred invocation before descending her into Briggon Lake."

"You expect me to believe that my wife wanted you to kill her?"

"You fucking killed her! You disposed of her body! Yet she's sitting in your kitchen. How can you see that with your own eyes and still have the arrogance to think you understand anything at all? Your most fundamental ideas about the world should be coming apart." 



"Explain it, why would she want that?"

"Because she would have come back. Not how she is right now mind you, she'd have come back with power." 

I sat down and closed my eyes. I wanted to disappear. 



Aleister kneeled in front of Annie to meet her gaze. Within a few moments, his eyes became like hers. A light on with no one home. I blinked and he was standing. What little color there was on his face was gone now. Drops of sweat covered his brow.

"What is it?"

"She's in a bad place, somewhere I can't reach her."

"She's sitting right there."

"Only her husk. We have to bring her back."

"We? I don't want anything else to do with this. I just want this to be over." He was looming over me again before I saw him take a step.



"I don't care what you do or don't want. Your actions got you here. You completed the ritual even if you butchered it. That means you are required for fixing it. If you want your wife back you'll do what I say." 



The room started spinning again. This time I had a complete lapse in memory. When I caught my bearings, I was driving him down the road. 

"Where are we going?" He gave me a puzzled look.

"I told you, literally any gas station you can find."

"Any gas station?"

"Yes, in any city, of any country. Go to any gas station you can get yourself into."

"Why are you talking like that?"

"For fucks sake, because it's important to pay respects to the classics, Steven. Read up on the holder series sometime. It's inspired a lot of great work."



"I never told you my name."

"Oh! You didn't! Another of life's little mysteries I suppose! It's only fair I tell you mine then. It's-"

"Aleister Abcott? I know."

He grinned from ear to ear

"Well, Aren't you full of surprises?"

"This has to be some kind of nightmare."

"Ah cheer up now Steven! What reason could you have to be so bleak?"

I stared holes into him. "I don't know. Maybe a little part of it stems from me accidentally killing my wife. Then watching her get chopped up by a motorboat. Then there's the icing on the cake, I'm chauffeuring a deranged lunatic. Which I don't even remember agreeing to do by the way."



"A motorboat? Really? Actually, it doesn't matter. life is all about perspective!"

"Perspective?"

"Yes! even in a hopeless situation. Take genital warts for example. A Debbie Doom-Monger, such as yourself, may whine. Because of the warts on your nether. But me? I'll be fine. Because it's ribbed for her pleasure."

"That's just disgusting."

"That's just your perspective."

"I can't believe you were in contact with my wife."



I glanced out the rear-view mirror. The back window was blocked by something large in the truck bed, the fridge. Aleister was sitting in the passenger seat.

"How is my fridge back there?"

"Oh, I hope you don't mind. I just moved it somewhere it well, made sense to be."



I pulled into a 24/7 quick stop. "Will this work?"

"Yes, this will work."

"Why are we here?"

"We need to acquire three very specific artifacts if we are to save Annie. We are about to get the first one."

"It's here? At this gas station?"

"Well, yes and no. It's not here, but we can get to where it is from here."

"Right, of course we can. What is it?"

"A long time ago, there was a great traveling warrior. His sword work was subpar. He wasn't anything special with a bow. But when it came to defense, he was second to none. We are after his shield. It will protect our physical bodies as we traverse the other realms."

"You have got to be kidding. You expect me to just, believe that? To just go along with it no questions asked?"

"It's clear there will be plenty of questions asked. Now let's go."



I wasn't sure why I was still doing what he told me. I would've done anything anyone told me. Anything to keep my mind occupied. I had no fucking idea what I'd do if left to my own devices.



The gas station was small, with only two people in front of us in line. A slow-moving geriatric and a comparably slow-moving teenager who reeked of pot. 



"When we get to the counter, I need you to look at the clerk and say this. Word for word." "I seek his protection, for I have a long road ahead." "Say this quickly, and do not break eye contact. The clerk will stare back at you without speaking. Close your eyes and count to one hundred, then open them again."



"I have to stand there with my eyes closed for that long? Won't he ask me to leave?"

"You've seen this guy, he's clearly not in any hurry to progress the line."

"Why do I have to do this, why can't you do it?"

"You want me to tell you why you must be the one? With all these people around?"

"Alright fine. This is insane. What happens after that?"

"After that it's simple. Walk outside, there will be a shield lying in the dirt. Pick it up, then start down the road. Keep it in front of you, do not turn around. No matter what you hear, keep moving forward."

"What will happen if I turn around?"

"Don't even think about that, just don't do it."



Aleister tapped his foot while staring at the old man. Obnoxious beeping filled the room as the reader pleaded with him to remove his card. "Damn technology. What the hell is wrong with this thing?" The clerk stared a thousand yards past his customer. He'd checked out long ago. 



Another thirty seconds passed. The old man tried to make sense of the complicated instructions on the terminal. 

"Please remove card?" It just didn't make any sense. 

"For fucks sake! Get this guy in Congress!" Aleister shouted. 

The man whipped around with the fire of someone sixty years younger.  "I am in Congress! I have been for longer than you've been alive."

"I doubt that. Why don't you try removing the card? You loud-mouthed luddite." 

"Pshh, like that'll work." He shuffled back around with the lethargy of a man his exact age. He pulled the card free and his receipt promptly printed. The noise acted as a cue that snapped the clerk back into reality.

"Have a good day sir."

"You too, get that card machine fixed."



All eyes focused on him as he ambled up to the exit door. He grabbed the handle and yanked hard. He yanked again and again, ignoring the bright red letters reading "PUSH."

"Huh, damn doors broke too!" In that moment another person opened the door from the outside, allowing him to shuffle out.



We inched ever closer to the clerk. I wasn't sure what would happen when we finally got there. I didn't believe a word of what Aleister was saying. I didn't understand his game. He reminded me of one of those guys Annie and I would hang out with in our younger years. 



We were both pretty into the occult when we met. For me it was a phase, for her, I suppose it wasn't. During our time with seances and abandoned buildings, there was always an Aleister type. Some guy who was way too into his own bullshit. What would he do when his little ritual here failed him? Would he lose it and tell the police I killed her? Whatever happened, I'd have it coming.



"What the hell is taking so long?!" Aleister's voice startled the inebriated young man. 

"Sorry bro, I'm trying to remember what pump I'm parked at."

"There's only one car outside and it's on pump 4."

"Oh yeah! Pump 4, that makes total sense. Thanks, bro! Hey, can I get seven dollars on pump 4?"

"Sure, that'll be seven dollars and forty-two cents."

The man reached into his pocket and slammed three one-dollar bills on the counter. The clerk squinted at him for a few uncomfortable seconds of silence. 



"Oh yeah, this too." He reached into his other pocket and pulled out a five-dollar bill. The clerk handed him back fifty-eight cents without any haste at all, much to Aleister's dismay. 



The man who entered the store before was behind the counter now fooling with a computer. Finally, the last hindrance trotted outside. Before we could even get a step in, we were interrupted.



"Sorry guys, shift change. Register will be down for about 15 or 20 minutes."

"Are you kidding me? We were in line!"

"Shift change happens at the same time every day. 12 pm and 12 am."

"Ridiculous, we only need you for a few seconds just wait a bit."

The clerk squinted. Without making any sudden moves, he positioned a sign on the countertop. "This register is closed!"



Aleister couldn't believe what he was seeing. He opened his mouth clearly about to unleash a real tirade. I grabbed his arm. It felt as if there was only bone under his sleeve. 



"Hey man, listen. Maybe we should just leave. I think you're just trying to do this little ritual as a cope for what's going on. I don't want to see you lose it when it doesn't work."

His eyes bulged out of his head. His mouth hung agape. He stretched his neck forward slightly for a better look at my face.  

"You have got to be fucking with me." He opened his mouth again but paused. He looked around the room. "Why don't we talk outside." He marched to the door and held it open.



As soon as we got out of earshot he exploded.

"You killed your fucking wife! You don't get to think I'm crazy. We are here because of you." The words stung my skin. They forced me to feel something I'd been pushing to the back of my mind.

"I told you it was an accident."

"Oh look at me, I'm Steven. I murdered my wife but it was 3rd degree so it doesn't count!"

"Fuck you." I turned on my heels and walked towards my truck. "Find your own ride back."

"Wait! I shouldn't have said that. I just need you to understand something. What I told you is real. If you get in there and freak out it's going to be bad. Not just for you, but for everyone if it finds her."

I froze in my tracks. "If it finds her?"



He looked stunned. He'd given too much away. "Tell me what you're talking about right now or I walk away."

"Would you believe me if I did?"

The answer was almost certainly no. "Yes."

"I told you before, she's somewhere bad. What's sitting in your kitchen is just an empty vessel running on muscle memory, reciting tidbits of conversation she's said before. The woman that you know is lost in a vast void. Now either we find her, or something else does. Different things can happen depending on what that something may be."



What he was saying made me feel uneasy. Even if it was completely ridiculous. He paused then, maybe to let me respond or maybe to catch his breath. Before either could happen, the new clerk stuck his head out the door.

"Shift change is over."



I'd do what he said this once, then I was done. He'd realize how crazy he was, or he wouldn't. Either way, this was it. I stared into the bright blue eyes of the clerk.

"I seek his protection, for I have a long road ahead." Immediately I shut my eyes and started counting. I expected him to say something. I didn't hear anything at all. When I opened my eyes, I was somewhere else, alone. Bales of hay scattered all about. Feeding troughs lined the back walls. I was in a stable.



The sudden scenery overwhelmed my senses. I leaned against the wall and slid down its worn wooden surface. It was dark, only a few lanterns lit the room. I slammed my head against the timber. The structure protested, it felt unsteady. I didn't care. Being here meant I was forced to confront my own mind. Forced to decide then and there if I was crazy.



It all felt real. The dirt was coarse and clung to my fingers. Its earthy aroma reminded me of childhood. This wasn't delusion. I'm still not sure if that made me feel better or worse. A flicker towards the entrance caught my eye. Something reflected the lantern light.



A brass shield stuck out of loose dirt. I approached it, taken aback by its beauty. Somehow looking at it made me feel calmer. It made sense. I knew it was what I needed. My shoulders strained to keep it held in front of me.



Outside was a poorly lit road I couldn't see the end of. With outstretched arms, I started on my way. For a long time, there was no sound at all. I couldn't even hear my footsteps. Did my head make a thunk earlier when it hit the wood? I couldn't remember. I didn't dare speak. 



The road was packed tightly with trees on either side. The occasional lantern cast ever-twisting shadows along the ground. The darkness was pervasive. My muscles ached from being tense.

"Hey, Steven! Wait up!" 

Aleister, I never thought I'd be so happy to hear his voice. I wanted to escape the loneliness so badly I half turned around, before stopping abruptly. It had almost ended just like that. 



"What? You're giving me the silent treatment? Are you okay?"

I didn't say a word, I kept my pace. Dread encompassed me. I waited on the verge of panic for him to speak again. He didn't. The silence answered any doubts I had about whether it was him. I promised myself I'd keep moving forward. No matter what.



Memories flashed through my mind in vivid detail. I saw things I hadn't thought about in years. Something was inside my head, flipping through my pages. Studying.



"Steven! Turn around right now."

I swallowed a scream as my brain tried to register what it was hearing.

"Don't walk away from your mother. You've always been such a disrespectful child. Do you enjoy letting me down, Steven? You have no business being here. You wouldn't be if not for that blasphemous bitch you married. You couldn't just listen to me once in your miserable fucking life. I told you she was a bad influence. I'm just glad your father isn't here to see you."



Every lantern went out. There was no light anymore. Warm tears made me realize for the first time how cold it was.  My mind ran wild in the dark. Twisted visions of whatever was behind me manifested in all directions. I looked up to the sky but it was black. 



"Speaking of your father, do you know why I'm here talking to you and he isn't? It's because he's burning in hell." The pitch of her voice raised just a few octaves, barely noticeable. "Don't worry, after what you did you'll be seeing him yourself someday. Of course, he wanted nothing to do with you in life, but maybe when you've both had your flesh melted off and your intestines ripped out you'll finally have something in common!"



I wanted to turn around so badly, just to make it stop. I couldn't imagine what would be waiting for me if I did, my whole body shuddered at the thought. I gritted my teeth and kept walking. I held the shield closer as I prepared for another onslaught from whatever was pretending to be my mother. Nothing came.



My feet began to ache. It felt like I'd been walking for hours. Alone in complete darkness, mentally and physically drained. Thoughts of Annie kept me going. My love for her burned hot despite the frigid air. I needed to save her, I needed to walk out of here.



"Steve! Steve, it's me! Thank God you're here, I'm lost, Steve. You have to help me! Why won't you turn around? Have you been listening to Aleister? You can't trust him. He is behind all of this and wants you out of the way. Steve please, if you keep walking that way, you're going to die. Please trust me, Steve, I love you."



I dragged a fifty-pound weight behind every step. The other voices were off just a little, but everything about Annie's was perfect, down to her cadence. What if it was her? What if this is where her soul had gone? There was a part of me that wanted to turn around like it wanted to breathe. 



"Do you remember that night on the overlook? I told you everything. Everything I felt about life, the world, love, about you. I expected you to back away after that. I was so worried you'd think I was too much. Too broken. You didn't, you held me. You never walked away after all those years and all those fights. So why are you walking away from me now? When I need you the most?"



I bit my tongue until the taste of iron filled my mouth. One foot in front of the other and nothing else. I had to keep going. My body was running on fumes and it knew it. It knew it. I told myself I was close, and that I just needed to hold on a little longer. I prayed that was true.



"Who am I kidding, I know exactly why you're walking away. You're too scared to face me after what you did. You killed me, Steve." Her voice was too deep. "Look at me you damned coward. Look. At. Me!" She screamed so loud I almost dropped the shield to cover my ears.



"You know I was going to leave you? You must know. You're an idiot but even you had to have seen it coming. You bored me to death long before you stabbed me to death. Everyone you have ever loved has left you, Steven, why would I be the exception?



I'd given everything I had. I tried to break my silence, yelling into the dark. Nothing came out. Entirely depleted, I took one last step. I was back in the gas station.



"Steven you fucking did it! I didn't think you had it in you! We aren't doomed after all! You've even got the shield, Steven!"

I barged outside and basked in the daylight. I soaked in the sun I never thought I'd feel again. Aleister threw his big gulp cup on the ground, spilling slushy everywhere, before chasing after me.

"I can't do this. You sent me to hell."

"Not quite, but what matters is you crawled out. You can do this!"



On the other side of the street was a police officer. I marched towards him without thinking. I was pushed to my limit on that road. I needed it to be over, I needed this weight off my soul.

"Hey, where are you going?"

"I'm done with this."

Aleister abruptly broke off in another direction. I was set on my target.

"Excuse me, officer."

"Can I help you sir?"

"Yes you can arrest me, I killed my wife. I dumped her body in Briggon Lake. Her name is, her name was Annie Flenderson."



The cop stared at me eyes wide. 

"Take it easy pal."

He grabbed his radio. Before he could key it up, a tall man began whispering in his ear from behind. The cop's threatening posture melted away. He sank into the ground and wept in the petal position. Aleister stood over him, grinning.



"What did you say to him?"

"Trust me, you don't want to know."

"You're a fucking monster."

"Maybe, but maybe you wouldn't feel that way if you saw a real monster. If you saw what I was trying to prevent. You already got an artifact Steven, we are a third of the way done!"

"Get away from me." I walked fast towards my car. 

"Go home and think, check on Annie. Meet me here tomorrow. Oh! If she starts acting strange, know we are running out of time. Goodbye!"

I turned around to tell him I was never going to see him again. He was gone.



I got home and collapsed in my bed. I couldn't bring myself to face Annie just yet. I wished I had someone to tell about my day. Someone to confide in. But that person was lost. Her voice left my head and filled my ears as she began to speak.



"I just worry we've grown apart. Our lifestyles don't mesh well anymore." She sounded down. "Of course I still love him. I just don't know if that's enough." Her words tied my stomach into a knot. She was talking about me. I was hurt, but I wasn't surprised. Some unconscious part of me knew she felt this way.



"I need to take control of my own life. I need to do what I've always dreamt of doing, what we talked about as teenagers. I don't just want to be a housewife, I want to be a housewife with demonic abilities!" She tapered off. "Don't forget to grab milk at the store!" The memory had passed.



My knuckles turned white as I clenched my fist. Why didn't she tell me? I would accept her, and love her no matter what entity had dominion over her soul. I yearned so badly for her. I wanted to tell her it was all okay, and that we'd work through it. Having so much to say but no way to say it tore my heart out.



I swore that I'd bring her back by any means necessary. I didn't know if I could trust Aleister, but he was my best shot. My only shot. I had to try, I owed it to her. I looked down at the shield. It was different now. The once brilliant brass now a dull rust. Still, I held it close to my chest. I had to try.



My thoughts were dispersed unceremoniously as Annie began to scream. A deep guttural scream that perforated my eardrums. We were running out of time.
