I had been trying to lose weight for nearly 2 years now, dieting, meal plans, gym memberships, sweeping lifestyle changes, but I never seemed to change at all.  Until this morning, I checked my weight on the scale, and it no longer showed "ERROR" it actually showed a number, 195 kg. Admittedly, it's small, I still had a long way to go, but for the first time since I started, I felt like I was actually making progress.

    All week I was happily going through my routine, certain I was doing everything right. On the next Sunday, I weighed myself again, 191kg! I checked twice just to be sure, it seemed unreasonable, especially with the lack of any progress in 2 years, but I was too ecstatic to worry about any underlying health issues, what kind of person would be worried about this? "Oh woe is me! My champagne is too bubbly, my lobster is too buttery!"

   On week 3, 186kg. I can see my toes if I lean just a little bit forward, and during calesthetics, I can almost touch them.

Week 4: 180kg! I feel less winded going upstairs to my apartment, but I noticed the skin on my arms dangle a little more than usual. The awkward bulge of upper arm fat that drapes over my elbows isn't going away like I hoped, it's definitely not bluging as much, but it definitely droops a little lower.  I started doing more weight lifting and decreased my calorie deficit to try to fill the skin with muscle

Week 5: 173kg, it's insane, 7 kilos in one week? I didn't even think that was possible. I was happy until I looked in the mirror and saw I had the jowels of a bulldog. I'm not even 35 yet, and I have the face of a septuagenarian. My arms are drooping even lower too.

Week 6: 165kg. The weight lifting isn't working, I should've started to see a plateau as my muscles gain mass. I switch entirely to a weight lifting regimen, no more calorie deficit, time for carbo loading. My chin has swallowed my neck, making my head look like an angry thumb. And my arms and legs droop so much, I bet if I jumped out my window, I'd glide through the air like a fleshy flying squirrel.

Week 7: 154kg. I haven't weighed this much since puberty, but it's getting harder to move. I'm getting winded going up the stairs again, like I'm wearing weights on my arms, legs, and back. I can't see it, but I swear I feel skin dragging behind my heels when I walk, I hear it slide against the floor.  I scheduled a check up with my doctor next week, somethings definitely wrong.

Week 8: I can't see, I have to move the skin out of my eyes like a basset hound, especially when I look down, definitely 140-something.  I haven't been doing any of my workout regimen, but I haven't been eating much either, I keep biting my cheeks.

Week 9: I couldn't get to the hospital. I can't even get out of bed. Every time I try to move, I'm dragging 20 kilos of dead weight. I cant bring my hands to my face to get the skin out of my eyes. I worry my mouth and nostrils will get blocked by skin somehow, as I struggle to lift my head from my pillow, I still feel my hair against the fabric.  I try to rest on my elbows to lift my torso, but I feel them pinch my skin painfully, and I drop back down.  Then I decided maybe rolling will do the trick, I rock my body from left to right, and use the momentum to push my body off the bed.  I feel the movement, the impact on the floor, but my back still feels the bed, and I feel it stretch painfully around the edge of the mattress, pinching at the corner.  My hair caught in something on the bed frame, and pulled my face skin just tightly enough to be able to look around my room. I struggle to look over my shoulder to see a thick puddle of flesh sitting on my floor, with a gentle lump in the middle that I guess must be my left leg.  I feel my back moving against the fabric of my bed, and look up just in time for the tension to snap, and the mass of flesh on my bed fell off, right over my face.
