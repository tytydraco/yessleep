“Have you heard of the new and exciting craze, “The Gentleman’s Game”? Well if you haven’t, now’s the time to hop on board the coolest game to hit the market since games began hitting markets, whatever that means. Think of the best toy, optical illusion, and mind trick you’ve ever seen but it’s all one thing, if you can even imagine that. So hurry, they’ve announced this is the last batch, and I promise you don’t want to miss out!”


I nearly had the plug memorized by that point. Every other TikToker, YouTuber, and sponsored post was for this indefinite game, if “game” could even describe it. I couldn’t really make out what the game was about. Every ad just showed it in the box and used vague keywords to define it like “illusion” or “toy”. From what I could gather, it seemed to be a kind of magic trick that involved the player thinking something was there even when it wasn’t, as odd as that sounds. At least that’s all I could figure from the one or two shots of people actually using it. The whole thing struck me as weird. I can’t remember a physical game, let alone toy, being popular in the last decade. Aside from kids I just assumed everyone was into digital entertainment now. That’s the main reason it stuck out to me so much, why out of everything would this take off? So when I saw it again from some no-name influencer while I was scrolling, curiosity got the best of me and I threw down thirty bucks to see what all the hype was about. 

I have to say, when it came in, I could not fathom why this would cost thirty dollars. The box was pathetic, just a cheap wooden block, two light bulbs on a plastic socket, and a piece of paper with instructions. My wife wanted me to wait until she was home to play it together, but after looking at it I was sure either the game was a big joke I wasn’t privy to or I got scammed, either way, might as well get it over with now. The instructions were pretty bare bones but read as follows:

HEY THERE! ARE YOU READY TO MEET THE GENTLEMAN!!!
 
Follow these simple instructions to begin:

1.) Place your playhouse somewhere in an open room with lots of lighting (sunlight is the best light, so don’t be afraid to play outside!)

2.) Setup your stage lights on one side of the playhouse and make sure they’re a couple feet apart, both pointing towards the playhouse. 

3.) Sit down in between your stage lights (feel free to say “come on out, Mr. Gentleman” to really set the mood!)

4.) Wait a few moments & you’re ready to go!

Not only were the instructions annoying but they were also useless as I still had no idea how to play after I set *all* of this up. For one, the playhouse wasn’t even a playhouse, it was a series of lines made out of wood. It kinda looked like a few “X”s pushed in together, there was no mistaking it for a child’s “playhouse”. Also, what did the instructions even mean I’d be ready to go? Because it seemed more than likely I’d just be sitting on the other side of a now slightly brighter piece of wood. Regardless, I was too invested to not try it. 

After running extension cables from one side of the living room to the other, I finally had the world’s most disappointing thirty dollars fully assembled. I sat down and stared and to my amazement, nothing happened. By this point, the project was more amusing than frustrating and I found it more funny than disappointing. If it was a big joke, then they got me pretty good. I was determined to see this through so I disassembled my setup and reassembled it in the front yard after stealing enough cables from our Christmas decorations box to fit the length. Our front yard was clear and the sun was bright through clear skies so there was no way this wasn’t what the instructions meant. I turned on the light bulbs which did nothing in the sun’s midst and considered saying the phrase from the instructions out loud for comedic effect but after reading “come on out, Mr. Gentleman” in my head I thought that may be a bridge too far. To my bewilderment, nothing happened. My neighbor stepped out of his garage to pull his trash can back to the house and I suddenly realized how absurd this looks. I got scammed, or pranked, and it’s made all the worse by the half hour it took me to confirm it. 

As I stood up from the charade and considered ways to convince my wife this never happened, for a moment, something caught my eye. It was so faint I questioned if it had even happened, like a floater that passes over your pupil before you can react. I assumed it an affect of the light brought on by staring at two light bulbs in the middle of sunshine. I blinked hard and stared directly at the ground when sure enough, there it was again. After a few attempts I noticed something, the abnormality was coming from the same spot, the top left corner of my eye. After rubbing it I tilted my head up and it moved to the bottom left corner of my eye. It was then I realized that the speck was not in my eye, but instead, on the ground, namely, on the other side of the playhouse. I sat back down and stared at the culprit. The patch of grass was completely unassuming but as I blinked or squinted, something seemed off. I could see the difference appear for a moment before I lost it in the collage of grass and leaves. I waved my hand around it, nothing. I closed my eyes for a few seconds and it appeared when I opened them, but after a moment, nothing. So, I tried to hold my eyes shut for a full minute and when I opened them, the same fleck appeared, but this time it didn’t go away. 

It looked like a solid, dull gray line, only a few inches in length and lying across the ground. So subtle, it looked almost transparent. I waved my hand over the area and the line disappeared, but when I blinked again, it was back. I looked around the area of the playhouse, nothing. I examined the bulbs for some marking or mechanism that made them different than any other fluorescent bulb, but again, nothing. I stood up in order to step around to the area of effect but as soon as I got up, the line vanished once again. Perplexed, I reassumed my position between the bulbs and again, the line reappeared and this time it seemed even more opaque. I moved the playhouse and just as when I stood up, the line immediately disappeared, when it was sat back down, the line emerged. It was then that the truth became evident to me, I had purchased a makeshift magic eye poster. Similar to how an afterimage can be burned into your retinas by a bright light, my eyes in combination with the sun and shape of the playhouse have tricked my brain into seeing something that isn’t really there. At this point, annoyance outweighed humor. It’s one thing to fall for a joke, it’s another to get ripped off by a party trick. I swiped my hand across the ground on the other side of the playhouse in frustration when, for the first time, the line moved. 

After being moved, the line vanished. So, I shut my eyes and reset the line, repeated the process, and once again, the line moved as my hand moved. But when I reached to grab it, my hand simply passed through air. It was when I swiped my hand to the right and the line moved with it I realized whatever determined the line’s position was somewhere off to the side of the line itself. No matter the direction I flicked my hand, as long as I did it just off to the side of the line, the line moved with it. It was then that the pieces made sense. The translucence of the line, the lack of a physical form, the “true” shape being just off center, it became clear. I was looking at a shadow. 

Following the right edge of the line, I stared where the shadow’s owner should be, but wasn’t. However, after a long series of blinks and unblinks, something began to change. A slight glimmer stretched its way into a shine that stood about 5 inches tall. The shine grew to the sides and stretched itself across a frame it meticulously built minute by minute. If the shadow began as nothing more than a gray line, then this new thing was a white line erected in its own space, not along the ground, but from it. What was left when the stripes of light quit stretching was a series of bolts and flashes frozen in place. The figure resembled something like lightning in the shape of a man, pulsing and breathing as it grew a more solid form. Still so imperceptible that I could be convinced it never was, but too detailed to be a trick of the mind. I looked at it and realized I was face-to-face with the gentleman, as barely visible as he was. 

Any frustration I had became delight. Sure, I had seen a trick image before, but this was something else. I could tilt my head to one side and instead of the image moving with me, it held its place as if it belonged there. The mirage was as real as the space it occupied. I pulled out my phone to take a picture and then felt foolish as I remembered the camera has neither eyes nor brain to trick. This experience was just for me and that made it all the more special. Furthermore, its popularity and lack of video footage also became clear. With my phone, I searched for a moment to see if others who had played the game had as interesting a result as I. But, just as before I ordered the game, it was near impossible to find testimonies of those who bought it, just more advertisements. After several minutes I glanced back at my assembly and quickly dropped my phone. It seemed the show wasn’t over. 

The stripes of light I saw earlier were only the bones, as now new shapes and details were wrapping around what the form used to be. No taller, but the visage grew in thickness by wrapping new forms in and over itself. The thin strands became bulky and figured. The space once arguable as possessed was now undeniably claimed. The breadth of what could previously be speculated as legs, arms, and a trunk became the thighs, calves, forearms, shoulders, belly, and chest. The thing was still hollow, sure, but now resembled a hologram more than a trick of the light. While not as detailed as a man, the idol hid no secrets as to its intent. While perhaps more mannequin than human, what I was staring was undoubtedly the shape of a person. 

My moment of wonder transformed into a stint of confusion. Sure, an image can be imprinted on the eye, but this “image” was changing by the moment. The whole process might have taken place over many minutes of time but the evolution from beginning to end was apparent. If this had been some video or series of images I was staring at it may have made sense, but once again, this was two lightbulbs and a piece of wood. To see one thing is remarkable but to see many things as one thing is impossible. The mannequin, the “gentleman”, may have still been see-through but was growing more opaque by the minute. A spirit of unease crept over me and I was suddenly compelled to make sense of this circumstance immediately. I stood up and to my surprise, and dread, the gentleman was unmoved. 

While I didn’t think the complexity of the illusion made sense, I knew that a three dimensional form did not. No picture, regardless of where you think it should be, will remain there after removing your perspective. I shifted to the left and began to step around the vessel as its head, arms, and feet were as clear as the day we were both standing in. There was no more need for blinking and counting behind my eyelids, the figure was growing fingers and toes as I stared. I walked around to its back, watching detail morph from uncanny to natural. I took some relief in this moment that if nothing else, I couldn’t see its face from here. This reprieve gave me the courage to do what I should have done earlier, reach out and touch. I moved my hand towards the projection, 5 inches tall and empty as my reason, and quickly closed my hand around it. But of course, nothing was there.

Just as if I was reaching out in a dream and gripping while awake, or clutching for smoke, the figure disappeared the moment I seized it. I looked and the only proof it had ever been there was the still existent gray line across the grass, no doubt an afterimage left behind by my eyes impression. Aside from the shadow, the yard, as it always had been, was empty. I immediately felt stupid. Sure, it was a very impressive trick, but I always knew it to be a trick. What else could it have been? Maybe I didn’t understand the mechanism, but fear was a ridiculous response. Shame followed suit, as at this point I had spent atleast an hour sitting in my yard and had quite literally been afraid of a shadow. I hurriedly packed the playhouse and light bulbs into the box with the extension cords and Christmas decorations and was prepared to stick with my original plan of telling the Mrs. that the purchase was a scam. Admitting my fear seemed the more expensive option. When she got home, I had to quickly make explanations as to why we couldn’t try out the gentleman’s game. 

“Yeah, I mean I got it out of the box but I’m pretty sure we got scammed. It was just a cheap block and some other stuff, I don’t think it’s the real deal.”, I said, testing her belief. 

“You’re joking. Do you think we can get our money back?”, she responded, having no reason to think I was lying. 

“I sent one of those report things through the site but a lot of the time these stores are fronts anyway so I doubt we get anything substantial back.”

“Oh, I’m sorry babe, you seemed really excited to try it. I’ll order one from a real website after dinner.”

“Nah that’s ok, I appreciate it but I’m kinda over it now.” 

A conversation that should have ended there continued because something in my mind wasn’t sitting well. I couldn’t pin it down, but even if this was a magic trick the likes of which I’d never seen, one so good it scared me, something still stuck out to me. 

“Plus, I was reading some reviews from guys that bought them and they said all the game really does is make you see a silhouette for a few seconds and then its shadow gets imprinted onto the ground around it.”

“What?”, She asked, “Like, it builds a little figurine or something?”

“No like, it’s an optical illusion, it makes you see a little statue that’s not really there.”

A few moments later she responded, “Hmm, that’s weird, what kind of optical illusion would have a shadow?”

A question asked with innocence filled me with terror. If I was right, if the thing I saw was a mirage and nothing more, then why could the sun see it too? What thing invisible to cameras can still cast a shadow? And perhaps the worst thought that crossed my mind, why was the shadow there after the shape was gone?

As my wife went to grab something from the car, I made my way to the window facing the front yard, dreading the memory of a shadow shorter than my hand. As I made it to the viewpoint, I was relieved to realize the sun had already set. The sky was still a bright orange and the neighbors’ homes were clearly visible, but in that golden hour, the light was not specific enough to grant one shadow to any as all were encompassed by the oncoming night. Foolishly, I felt relieved. This of course didn’t solve anything, but not confronting whatever truth lay outside my front door put me at ease. I imagine these seconds to be the last seconds of comfort I will ever know. 

As I looked out the window, my bravado became horror. In our neighborhood, the street lights always turn on just before nightfall and I so happened to be staring out the window at that exact moment. When the sickly yellow glow of the streetlight next to my mailbox turned on, for an instance, I saw the gentleman. Earlier, this would have gone unnoticed, the gentleman was there one instant and gone the next. Had it been the original size, I probably would have never seen it. But in that moment, I had enough time to realize three things. 1.) The gentleman was facing the house now. Earlier today I had been facing both the house and the gentleman but now it has turned around 2.) While it was too fast to take detail, his figure had gone beyond human and into something unholy. It’s as if the skin and flesh that was at once growing never quit growing, and its features amalgamated into twists and points and growths. Any notion of transparency was gone, its form, while still pale and bright, was now as solid as stone. And 3.), perhaps the only thing I truly thought in the moment before I began typing was simply, “it must be taller than me now”. 

I screamed and backpedaled from the front of the house. When the streetlamp came on I saw it and I know it saw me. It vanished but it never left. I yelled and cried for my wife but as I ran to the garage something happened. Subtly, imperceptibly to most, the shadows in the hallway deepened. As I would move one direction, the shadows would let up where I had been and simultaneously grow in intensity in the direction of my next step. In the living room, where I am now, the lights are on but everywhere else is shrouded in darkness, I think that thing is waiting. I screamed for hours, I have called my wife over and over but I don’t think she’s coming and I miss her and don’t want to say it but I don’t think she turned the light on in the garage. 

I can’t call anyone. If I call family or the police they’ll come to help and at some point they’ll have to cross a shadow and I can’t do that to them. This is my fault and I don’t know what it wants or who it wants. I think it doesn’t like being seen and I think that’s the only reason I’m still typing this. Since I’ve sat here with my back to the wall, it’s circling through our house like a shark. I see shadows grow bright and dark as it stalks from room to room. I keep seeing its shape in my peripheral. The parts that touch the light are monstrous. Its leg stretches above the doorway and it peaks down at me, tempting me to look. I won’t, I won’t give it a reason, I don’t even know if it needs one. I don’t know if it can step into the light or if it just doesn’t want to. I don’t know if it knows I’m typing this or if it wants me to or if this is just its sick fun or what. I don’t know who will see this, I don’t know if it’ll help anyone, I hope it does, she’s gone and it should be for something. I’m going to wait for sunrise, then go for help. I think if I stay in the light I’ll make it. If you don’t hear from me, I’m wrong. I think I found out how to play the gentleman’s game, I just don’t think it’s a game meant for us.
