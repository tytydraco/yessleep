I've worked night maintenance at a hotel just outside Chicago for about six years now. It's a mid-tear place-free breakfast, bad coffee, weird carpet that hasn't been replaced since Bush was in office. Pretty boring job most nights. Fix a flickering light, help a drunk guest find their room, deal with the occasional overflowing toilet. That kind of thing. Anyway, this happened last Tuesday.



 It was around 2:30 in the morning when I got a call on my radio from Tina at the front desk. She sounded nervous, which was weird. Tina's new, but she's not easily rattled. "There's... someone in Room 313," she said. "Pacing. Talking to themselves. Kinda loud." I actually laughed. "Tina, there's no Room 313. We skip that number." "No," she said, "I know. I double-checked. The door says 313." I stopped laughing. See, I've walked that hallway a thousand times. There's 312, then 314. No 313. The schematics skip it. Superstition or whatever. So I tell her to stay put and i'll go check it out. I figured maybe a prank for some drunk peeled numbers off another door. I get to the third floor. Everything looks normal at first. But then I turn the corner, and there it is. Room 313. Same style as the others. Same generic door. Same brushed metal numbers, except... slightly crooked. Like someone stuck them on in a hurry. And I hear talking from the inside. Low, fast whispering. No pauses, no response, just one voice. 



I try the knob, it opens. The room looks... normal. At first. But something's off. The light's weird. The shadows are too long. The curtains are closed but light still bleeds through-gray light, not moonlight, not anything natural. And the walls? Wet. Not moldy. Wet. Like they were sweating. Then I see someone standing in the corner. They're facing the wall. Not moving. Their back is pale and bare, skin almost gray, shoulders hunched. Their hair is stringy and black, dripping like it's wet too. They're whispering one word, over and over: "Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop." I don't move. I don't want them to turn around. But they stop whispering. And then, slowly, they start to turn their head-not the whole way, just enough for one eye to peek at me. White. Wide. Too wide. The skin looks wrong. Pulled too tight, like it doesn't fit. I slammed the door and ran. Didn't even look back. 



When I got to the front desk, I told Tina to call the cops. I said someone was in the room. She just stared at me. "You said there's no Room 313." I told her to pull the security footage. She did. We watched me walk down the hall, past Room 312. Then-nothing. One second I'm there, next I'm gone. The footage glitches for just a second. No 313 on the tape. No door. Just a blank wall. We went up together. Sure enough-no 313. Just a wall between 312 and 314. 



Tina quit the next day. But I'm still here. Working nights. Watching the cameras. Two nights ago, at 2:59 AM, I saw something. Just for one frame. A door where there shouldn't be one. Room 313. It was back. And I think it was waiting for me. Door slightly open. Light flickering inside. And I swear to God... the shadow standing in the doorway looked just like me.
