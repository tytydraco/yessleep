I work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building I found a book that details the true story of the Salem witch trials. After reading it I found this story particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.

&#x200B;

My name is Jacob and I live with my huge family in Salem, New England. My grandmother was appointed Baronet of Salem before I was born and we had move here from farther south in New England. No one in our family would tell me who or why she was appointed, they would always say they would tell me when I was older.

I was 14 years old, and my little brother Robbie was 11. We used to have a brother named Levi, but he got eaten by wolves a few years back. Then we had our sister Kelly, she was 7. We used to have a sister named Kayla, but she got eaten by wolves a few months back. We also just had another sister, Mary. But the wolves got her a few days back. My mother Jackie and my father Rudolph were quite a pair. My father was like a rabid dog that my mother had on leash. That was my immediate family but it wasn't all the people under our roof.

On top of that we lived with The Baronet and my grandfather. And with my aunt Jill and her family. Her husband Randal and her 3 kids, Wynken, Blynken, and Nod. Wynken was 9, Blynken was 7 and Nod was their little baby girl. I hoped the wolves didn't get her like Mary. She had few kids who had gone missing as well, but I can't recall their names.

We all lived together in a gigantic house on the outskirts of Salem, New England. The Baronet was very wealthy. There was also a large farm around our home.

There was a New England Inquisition to deal with the witchcraft in our town, but they were inept and the joke of all the local covens. Witchcraft was rampant in these parts and everyone knew it. There were a few that clung to God and Jesus in the hopes of being saved but most worshiped occult things, and in Salem every Sunday was a black sabbath behind the scenes.

It had gotten so bad and so well known that William of Orange, king of England, Scotland and Ireland, had commissioned the Spanish Inquisition to come and investigate Salem. The grand Inquisitor of the new world was supposed to arrive today and take over operations for the New England Inquisition.

I awoke, laying flat on my back and knew immediately today was going to be special. I awoke Robbie and we headed downstairs for breakfast. Kelly, Wyken and Blynken were already at the kids table sipping cups of coffee.

"Finally decided to get up? Lazy bums." Kelly chirped.

We got some toast, eggs, bacon and coffee and sat down. As we ate we sat quiet, listening to the chatter from the adults table.

"You don't think the Spanish inquisition is any better than the New England one do you?" Jackie said to Jill with a scowl.

"Of course not. God is not here, our lord Samael is king in these parts. Have faith that he will protect us." Jill chided back with confidence.

Samael was a name I didn't here very often but I knew who it was. It was who everyone here worshiped secretly in church. On Sunday at midnight they always held a black mass to Samael. Only church higher ups and the invited were allowed to come to those though.

"Even if they are better" Jill continued. "Our roots are deep. We will survive any purge."

Just then the baronet come through the door. She was dressed in a flowing silk gown. "I'm the same age as my mother when she-" The baronet cut off mid sentence and stood there like a wounded bird.

Jill got up and went to her and hugged her. "The pain would have been great. But she is home now." She said sweetly and winked.

The Baronet held her for a second then went to the cellar and returned with some kind of pie. "I have dessert for anyone who wants some" and she went to work cutting up some limes. She then came and put a put a piece of pie in front of me and said "You just-" Cutting off. She stood there, bug eyed and grimacing making a pincer motion with her index and middle fingers.

I got a weird feeling. I secretly hoped the Spanish inquisition was actually competent, but I didn't expect much of them. Before I took a bite I looked down to see that the Baronet had sucked on the lime she put on my pie. I felt sick and instead of eating it I went and through it in the garbage. When I turned around my grandfather was standing there looking at me.

"Your grandmother loves you" I said with a goofy smile.

Before I could walk past him I heard my mother Jackie call to me "Take your brother and head to school". I got Robbie and we headed out the door.

The rest of the kids went too a different school, for younger, kids and Jackie and Jill would walk them there. Most kids my age had already dropped out to work on a farm, but since the Baronet was so rich I was still expected to go to school.

As me and Robbie walked he looked at me and I smiled. "We aren't going to school today." I said.

"Where are we going then?" he asked.

"Lets go to the harbor and see the inquisition arrive." I said. "We can go to school any day but the Spanish Inquisition doesn't arrive every day."

He was on board and we excitedly headed to the harbor. We grouped up with a bunch of my friends who were either dropping out of school or jigging. We headed to the top of a hill overlooking the sea and waited for ships.

Before too long we saw 3 ships on the horizon. As they approached we recognized two Spanish galleons and some kind of flagship. The three ships docked and we headed down too the docks to see what was happening. The 3 ships were full of armed inquisitors and horses. The Grand inquisitor wore full plate armor over red robes and was easily recognizable from his gold helmet. As he disembarked he heard some of the dock workers speak to him.

"So your the grand inquisitor huh? Well then whats your name?" the worker questioned.

"I have no name to you, accused." The inquisitor said coldly. "I am the wrath of Yahweh, and if you are innocent you have nothing to fear from me."

The dock worker went bug eyed and grimaced. "Well I guess even the noble Spanish have no manners then eh?"

The inquisitor smiled and said "Take me to the head of your so called inquisition. We have... Restructuring to do." he motioned and the other inquisitors pushed the workers aside as he walked past and headed for the barracks. He briefly made eye contact with me as he walked past.

Me and the other boys all headed for the barracks as well, the long way though, trying not to be spotted. The whole group of us came around through the woods and sat with our backs to the barracks walls. We wouldn't be spotted as long as we didn't look through the windows and we could hear everyone clearly.

The head of the New England inquisition, Delta, was barking orders and telling people to hide things. Then there was a loud thump as a door sounded like it was kicked in.

"You have no right to storm in here like that!" Delta cried "Where are your manners you Spanish cur?"

"So you are the one in charge here? What do you have to say for yourself? In the small amount of time I've been here I've seen more than 20 people who need to be tried. Just walking down the streets It seems as if every second person houses some demon or fallen angel." The grand Inquisitors voice boomed.

"How dare you speak of simple, honest country folk like that you cur-" Delta cut off and I heard his head hit the floor.

"Beelzebub" The grand inquisitor said plainly.

"Then our worst fears have been realized" one of the Spanish inquisitors stated.

"It would appear so. It really is Samael. Round up all the New England Inquisitors for questioning. We will cut out this treachery at its heart." The grand inquisitor spoke. He then paused for a second.

I felt my heart race. He knew we were here. Just then four inquisitors came around the side of the building. They tied us up and took us inside.

Once we were inside I saw the Grand Inquisitor standing there looking as smug as could be.

"So we have eavesdroppers do we? Take them to the dungeon. We will question them later."  The Grand Inquisitor smirked.

We were all taken to separate cells. I sat alone in the dark for a few hours before a Spanish inquisitor came and took me back to the surface. The grand Inquisitor was standing there looking out over Salem.

"Ah the boy I wished to see." He said reaffirmingly.

"Are you going to torture me?" I asked.

"No, torture is the tool of the heathen inquisitor. I simply ask that you speak. I will know if what you say is true or false though. And If you lie to me there will be consequences." he responded. "Now you are probably thinking 'Why is he talking to me?' but I've looked into you Jacob. You and your brother. Now your older so I'm going to speak to you first, but if you don't work with me, he is an option available to me."

"What do you want me to do?" I asked, dumbfounded.

"You see right before New England was plunged into an era of sorcery and treachery there was a woman who burst into flames at church. She was your great grandmother and I think she is still here. Calling the shots behind the scenes, serving the dark lord Samael. I am new to New England and will be needing a guide who knows Salem. I would Like for you to be that guide Jacob. Should you accept your brother will be free to leave. If not the offer shall be extended to him. What say you?"

I thought for a second then responded "I accept."

"Good. Then come here and see what your Grandmother, mother and aunt have been hiding inside the bodies of men." We walked around the side of a building and there were 10 heads of inquisitors all on steaks. They all had bizarre demonic looks on their faces. He motioned to Delta's head. "That is Beelzebub the demon of the unpardonable sin." He motioned to the next head. "The demon of treachery" he said. "This next one is fraud, then violence. Have you read Dante's Inferno boy? The demons are the same as the layers of hell. As inquisitors, its our job to bring the demons in people to the surface. These people were empty husks, with nothing but demons inside. Pity them not, for they stand before Yahweh. If any good still exists in them it will be rewarded." He then pulled a head out of a bag and put it on a steak as well, making 11. "And this face you see here my child is Samael."

I looked at it and it reminded me of my mother, aunt and the Baronet. I had seen that look upon the baronet's face only this morning. I had seen that face on each of them countless times throughout my life. My blood ran cold, I had never felt more scared before.

The Grand Inquisitor sensed my fear and spoke "Fear me not child for I sense your innocence. My name is Hugo and I am here to save god fearing, pious individuals like yourself. You are one of the few never invited to a black mass, and you have not given your body to Samael or his demon children. Come we have work to do."

We mounted his horse and headed for my home. Six inquisitors followed, all on horseback. As we rode through Salem everyone was looking at us. I noted that most of the faces were the same. They were all Samael.

We arrived at our family's home and Jackie and Jill were sitting in the grass having a picnic. Jackie looked at me with that bug eyed grimace I now recognized as Samael.

"Why aren't you at school?!" she screeched. Then she seemed to realize who I was with. She started making weird noises, like some kind of call.

The inquisitors and I dismounted and walked towards to Samaelian picnic. Just then I saw my father and Randal out of the corner of my eye. They had arrows knocked and ready to fire, and before I could speak both fired at Hugo. One of the Spanish inquisitors jumped in the way, giving his life to save Hugo. He fell to the ground with 2 arrows in his chest. Then quick as lightning all 5 inquisitors drew and returned fire. Putting an arrow in each leg of the two attackers. The fifth arrow was in my fathers foot. They both fell to ground yelling in pain.

Hugo looked at my mother, eyes glowing a heavenly white. You... no." He then looked to Jill. "You...?" He paused. Eyes dimming then shining all the more brightly. "Yes it is you. Dora Dunwood you are under arrest for witchcraft involving human sacrifice, corrupting the church, corrupting the minds and hearts of these settlers, and most of all , for giving Samael a foothold in our world! Seize her!"

The inquisitors grabbed Jackie and Jill and tied them together. Then the front door burst open. The Baronet stood there dressed in black with numerous hooded figures. She pulled up her hood and disappeared among them. Then they started filing out of the house.

Hugo grabbed me and threw me up on his horse before quickly mounting. Even I could tell we were grossly outnumbered, and we were out of there before they could fire upon us effectively. Thankfully we had managed to capture my mother and Jill.

As we rode back to the barracks I expected to see people, with Samael on there face. But there was no one on t he streets, Salem was more empty than I had ever seen it. As we neared the barracks I did see a group of people in an alley, all wearing black cloaks.

Once we arrived I noted that the sun was starting to set. We took our new prisoners inside and got ready to question them. Hugo wanted my help, he said I must on some level know their minds and it will help to bring Samael to the surface. I was to start the interrogation.

I walked into the room and Jackie, my mother looked at me with fake fear. "You've betrayed your family. How could you?" She said solemnly.

"I betrayed our family? What about Levi? What about Kayla? What about Mary? What about all the other children the wolves supposedly ate? Hugo told me you used them as human sacrifices in black magic rituals! How could you? You evil witch!" I vented, holding back tears.

She looked at me with that bug eyed look and grimaced. Samael had come right out. Hugo came out of the shadows and handed me a short sword.

"Pure, folded Damascus steel. That sword is worth more than 50 common swords. Consider it a gift." Hugo paused for a second. "I can sense that you know what needs to be done. There is nothing left inside of her. It is only Samael. I won't require that you kill her with that sword, but I think it would be best if you did it. If you do you will be a boy no longer, but a man of god. Willing to do his will before all else. In most circumstances killing your mother would allow Beelzebub to enter you. But you have resisted her all your life, you know how truly evil she is. She would have killed you painfully had I not arrived in time. Still, the choice is yours"

I held the sword. The blade glistening in the moonlight. I looked at my mother and saw Samael. There was no woman inside this empty husk any more. I held the sword to her neck and a rush of memories came back to me. My mother coming in like a giant wasp every time a girl showed interest in me, her coming in like a wasp every time I finally found something that brought me happiness, her coming in like a wasp every time I saw the beauty in the world. It was like she was attached to me, and used that to hurt me and siphon my life force. With 14 years of tormented memories going through my head my wrist flicked, lopping her head off. Samael stayed on her face as her head rolled across the floor.

I turned to Hugo crying. "What now? I feel as though in slaying the monster I have become just as evil!"

Hugo looked at me "Nonsense! Fall upon your knees boy and you shall be knighted."

I fell down upon both knees before Hugo. I heard him laugh.

"On one knee boy, I am Hugo the Grand Inquisitor, not lord Yahweh himself."

I put one leg up and felt a sword on my shoulder. "You have a small build, perhaps a rogue would be a better fit to you. " Hugo paused "You Jacob, are now anointed by the the Lord Yahweh the all mighty, who was, and is , and is to come. You are a boy, no longer, but an initiate of the Spanish Inquisition. Your role will be that of a rogue." Then I felt a heavenly light blast me from the spirit world. I felt super charged with grace and balance. He put the sword on my other shoulder and told me to rise. When I stood up I felt like a whole new person.

We walked down the hall towards Jill. Dozens of the convicted looked at us from cells, all bearing Samael's face.

When we came to Jill's cell she cackled. "This is my land inquisitor. I think you find that you are most unwelcome here."

Hugo pulled out a jar of water. "Come here Jacob." I looked towards him and he threw some water in my face.

"What was that for? I asked.

He looked at my slyly and threw some in Jill's face. She screamed and it burned her face like sulfuric acid.

Hugo smiled. "I got this from an Incan King in South America. They say that after Jesus rose from the dead he teleported to the new world. He preached to the ancient incans and blessed this one spring so that it would burn the wicked but not harm the righteous."

I was dumbfounded by this Inquisitor that had clearly taken a liking to me. Just then four Spanish Inquisitors came the door.

"Hugo sir, hundred of cloaked figures have surrounded the barracks. They are armed! They say they want their queen Jill back and they will kill us all if we don't return her." They relayed.

Hugo stood stoic for a moment then replied "We will not give in to cultists of Samael. We will fight to the last. " He looked to me. "Rogue tonight will be your initiation. Survive and you have a place at my side in the inquisition."

we left Jill in her cell and Hugo left with the other inquisitors. I was alone and I decided to fulfill my role as a rogue. I slipped int othe shadows and prowled silently to a window. It was a full moon and as I looked out I saw hundreds of cultists all wearing black cloaks.  I watched them for what felt like no time at all, and then a volley of arrows flew from the barracks. Cultists dropped to the ground grunting.

Then I heard the Baronet's voice. "Send in the Lilum."

The cultists stepped to the side and and some red cloaked ones walked towards the barracks. All the cultists in unison started chanting "Sam, Ael, Sam, Ael" . The red cloaked cultists then all started to scream in pain and fell to the ground writhing. Then giant wasp larva erupted from what exposed flesh they had and started devouring them.

I was shocked by the treachery I had just witnessed. I shuddered ass I realized what my fate woulds have been had the Spanish Inquisition not come. I watched the grubs eat and couldn't believe what I was seeing. They already seemed to have wings and stingers. They quickly seemed have eaten their fill and turned towards the inquisition. They made noises like crying babies as they flew towards the barracks.

I pushed against the wall next to the window and three of them flew through it. I swung my sword, cleaving the third in two pieces. The other two didn't notice me and buzzed around the dark room, looking for prey. I leapt from the shadows killing a second one. But the third saw me and flew into my left arm, digging his stinger in.

My arm went numb and hurt like nothing I had ever felt before. I quickly cut the beast in half and fell to the ground. Clutching my arm in agony. I heard the screams of Spanish Inquisitors fighting against the flying wasp larvae. My left arm was totally immobilized.

I scrambled back to the window and looked out. All the cultists stood motionless in the moonlight. Before moving like one being and all charging towards the barracks still chanting.

I moved into the shadows and crept towards the entrance. I heard the front door being hit with a battering ram before giving way. Then hundreds of footsteps. I stood in the dark waiting and a group of 4 cultists passed me.

I followed them silently and picked off one, then two, and then the third before being detected. The forth cultist turned to face me, sword drawn. I went for a horizontal slash and he blocked. Thankfully my sword went right through his, cutting him and the sword in half.

I jumped back into the shadows and readied myself to strike again. All over the barracks I could hear screams and the clashing of swords. Blood coated many walls as I crept around and observed the carnage. The wasp larvae appeared to be all dead as the buzzing had stopped.

I then crept upon a trio of cultists laying in wait for someone to pass. I snuck up behind them and slashed horizontally with all my might. They were unarmored and my sword cleaved the first two in half, digging into the third cultists spine. All three screamed, though the first two stopped quickly. The third ran away, torso dragging on the ground.

I crept back into the shadows and began my hunt a anew. Everywhere it seemed like the inquisition was butchering the cultists. The disciplined, trained and pious inquisitors were overpowering the treacherous, cultists. The cultists faith waned and they started to retreat back out into the moonlight. There were far fewer of them now, and the ones who were left looked like they were beaten, and just laid down in the grass.

Then a cultist came to the forefront and pulled down her hood. It was the Baronet. She cried to the cultists "Samael will come to deal with inquisition himself. The lord of all evil has come!" She screamed with Samael on her face.

Then I heard a buzzing, deep and bassy. I shivered in terror as it grew louder and louder. Until a black wasp the size of a large donkey landed next to the Baronet.

"Here thee people of Salem. It is I, your god, Samael. Though few of me have seen me in the flesh all of you have felt my presence. It is I who makes your crops grow like weeds. It is I who makes your animals taste the best. It is I who watch over you and safeguard you in this new, uncertain world. Many of you have died for me tonight, but now I ask the rest of you lay down your lives and rid the world of this ghastly inquisition." The wasp preached.

The cultists strength seemed renewed, and they started to stand up. But just then Hugo and three dozen inquisitors rode out the front door on horseback. They broke into three lines and headed towards the cultists. Hugo though rode towards the giant wasp, holding a brilliant lance.

Hugo screamed at the wasp "I have hunted you my entire life Samael. Through the darkest heart and minds I have searched only to find you waiting at the bottom of every glass. You now stand before me in the flesh and I want one thing from you. Single combat to the death. Yahweh has sent me to disembody you, and as long as he is with me I will not die to you!"

Samael laughed and it seemed to come from everywhere, not just the wasp. The wasp then flew into the air as Hugo charged towards it at full speed. Samael quickly flipped his body so his stinger was forward and they hit each other with a crash. Hugo's lance pierced Samael's abdomen as his stinger flew into Hugo's horse. The horse whinnied and fell to the ground, with Hugo leaping off of its back. Mid air he drew his sword and slashed, cutting off one of Samael's wings. Hugo hit the ground behind the wasp, rolling to his feet and turning around.

Samael screamed in anger and pain "David and Goliathed again?! Curse you Yahweh!!!" and he turned around to face Hugo.

I sprung from the window and into the shadows, sneaking as close to the fray as I could. But I would not intervene in their single combat.

Hugo quickly fired two arrows through each of the wasps compound eyes and It laughed "I don't need my eyes to see you." and it then charged at him as fast as a donkey. Hugo drew his long sword and charged as well. Samael jumped when they got close, thrusting his head high into the air and falling upon Hugo with both mandibles and stinger. Hugo thrust his Damascus steel sword right into Samael's mouth and it went right into his brain and out the back of his head, his arm went into the beasts mouth to his elbow. In Samael's final act he took off Hugo's arm with his mandibles and stung him, paralyzing him totally. The two fell to the ground in a heap.

I quickly noted than some of the building were on fire and went to one putting my sword into the fire. When It was white hot I went and cauterized Hugo's wound. Though he couldn't move he seemed pleased.

I stood looking around at the inquisitors rounding up the cultists like sheep. It seemed for a moment we had won. Then I noticed a large group of cultists exit the barracks. I followed behind them, discreetly, and realized that they had freed Jill. I heard Jill and the Baronet talking as I followed them back to our house.

The two I knew to be Jill and the Baronet went into the house while the others stood guard. I watched from the shadows, waiting for a my moment to strike. I stood in the shadows for what felt like ages, waiting for an opening, but one did not present itself.

Eventually the two cloaked figures emerged, one holding a large jar of what appeared to be blood and guts labeled "Mary" and the other held poor baby Nod. They were talking but I couldn't quite make out what they were saying.

Then I heard the galloping of horses as Hugo and a dozen inquisitors came around the bend. The cultists braced for the charge and I saw my opportunity. I had a clear line too the Baronet and sprung forward, stabbing her through the heart. Her hood fell back and Samael looked back at me. I pulled my sword out and expected her to fall to the ground. Instead she turned and threw the jar at Jill and Nod. It exploded in the air coating them in Mary's desecrated remains. The Baronet then turned to me and fell to the ground, dead.

Almost immediately I heard Nod cackle in the Baronet's voice, and then she yelled at me in a mocking tone "Thank you for this beautiful new body!"

I felt sick to my stomach and looked towards Jill. She cackled maniacally and then slowly rose into the air. "You'll never catch us" She yelled as she flew away faster then any horse could gallop. A couple oof the inquisitors fired but she was already out of range. The cultists scattered and ran into the shadows, their queen was safe.

Hugo came up to me on horseback and said sadly "Flying salve. I should have know. Its a full moon" He paused seemingly broken for a second. "Curse you Samael!" He screamed towards the north where she had flown. He dismounted and fell too his knees, praying.

I waited for a long time for him to stop but he seemed like he would right till morning. Tired of waiting I spoke "Are you ok?"

"We failed" he said plainly. "This was our one chance to banish Samael from this world forever. He will haunt future generations as he has us."

"But you killed him" I said.

"He was only disembodied. He will be back" he replied solemnly.

"What do we do then?" I asked.

"We do what we can. We will search the hill is the coming days for any large wasps that may be out there. We will burn the bodies of anyone found the be harboring wasp larvae. And we will set all those who remain on a path to the lord."

In the following days and weeks the inquisition did all the things Hugo said they would. The surviving people of the town all seemed like they had been awoken from a trance and overpowered whatever demons stilll remained in them. A few of them were unsalvageable and had to be burned alive, with the wasp harborers. A few manhawks were found of varying sizes. The smallest was the size of a crow, and the largest was the size of an albatross.

My family was never the same. My grandfather had always been kind of senile, but he had now totally lost it. He was technically in control of all of the Baronet's wealth until we found her will. She had left everything to Nod. We tore up the will and divided everything up among the remaining children. Both My father and Randal had been killed in the battle of the full moon.

While Robbie, Wynken and Blynken chose to stay and live in the big house in Salem. I elected to follow Hugo back to Spain to be trained as an inquisitor.

On our way voyage back we stopped in Louisiana and traveled to a monastery so that Hugo could commune with Yahweh. It is here that I write my story down, so that my contemporaries and future generations may have a true account of what went on that night in Salem, New England.
