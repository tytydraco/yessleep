“What if you went in there and killed them?”

“Huh?” I said, taking another drag.

Stanley smiled, “What if you went in there and killed them?”

“I mean,” I laughed, “I don’t know.”

We had stopped on a street a few blocks from the bar. Stanley said he needed a little break to smoke and recuperate himself. I told him that we’d hardly walked. He said he’d gotten fat after Thanksgiving and now Christmas. I leaned on the waist-high fence around the perimeter of a house and accepted a cigarette from him.

“No, no,” he said, “I mean it.”

“Mean what?”

“Kill them,” he nodded his head towards the front door of the house.

“But why?”

“Think about it,” he said. “A family all sleeping soundly in bed. A strange man walks in with a baseball bat. Starts knocking their heads in. It’d be fun.”

“Where would we even get a baseball bat?” I grinned.

“Oh, right here.”

He pulled out from behind his legs a bat and offered it to me. The streetlight glimmered off the round end of its batting side, causing me to squint for a moment. It was made of metal.

“I don’t know dude,” I said.

“Go on,” he said. “You know you want to.”

I took the bat. The metal weighed heavy in my hands. I looked it up and down. Stanley’s eyes bored into me. I moved the bat between my hands, playing for time before he’d continue with his proposition.

He took a long drag from his cigarette, “Look. The door’s already open for you.”

I looked to the house. The front door stood wide open. I took a step towards it, before retreating back.

“I can’t.”

“Why not?”

“I…”

My mind faltered. I couldn’t call to mind a reason I shouldn’t. All morality and personal accountability had managed to slip away and, for a moment, I could only conjure up the reasons I should.

“I don’t know.”

“Then do it.”

I looked back towards the door. Beyond it was an emptiness. I felt if I stepped foot into there I’d fall through it and never be able to return. Like swimming in space.

“I guess,” I said, taking a step forward.

“Yes,” Stanley said, “Walk through the door. Then up the stairs.”

I found myself standing on the top bannister. The place looked cozy. Pictures hung from the walls showing a family at various holiday destinations. Paris, London, Bangkok. I could trace the ageing of the youngest through childhood and into their teen years. I saw the braces they had put on and subsequently taken off. I saw the eldest man’s wrinkles form and hairline recede. The woman’s hair turning grey and then dark again.

A door slowly opened at the end of the hall. I didn’t feel alarmed. I could hear Stanley explain.

“Go there,” he said.

I entered the room. A bed sat at the other end. The streetlight filtered through the window and I could barely make out the figures. Their chests rose and fell with each breath. They seemed unperturbed by my presence.

“Approach them,” Stanley said, “and ready the bat.”

So I did. I stood over them, bat lifted over my shoulder. I could make out the faces of the figures in the bed looked exactly like the adults in the pictures.

“Strike them,” he said.

So I did.

His head popped like a balloon filled with water. The blood gushed onto the sheets. The other woke up and turned over. Too shocked to scream.

“Her too.”

When the job was done, I dropped the bat onto the floor. It made a clunk as it hit the hard wood. I wanted to feel disturbed in that moment, yet I felt at peace. I stared at their bodies. I could no longer tell if their faces fit the ones in the pictures.

“Come down.”

At the bottom of the stairs I found Stanley sitting on the sofa in the family’s living room. He patted the seat next to him. I sat.

“Too bad...”

“The leather’s ruined,” I finished.

“Exactly my thought.”

“Why did we do this?”

“We?” Stanley laughed. A wry, humourless laugh, “I didn’t do anything.”

Then it hit. The disturbed feeling. The feeling I had done something wrong. I dug my fingernails into the skin of my palm. I wanted it gone. I wanted the blood out of me.

My bedsheets were covered in sweat when I woke up. Thank god, I thought, thank god it wasn’t real. I pulled myself up and walked over to the mirror. Thankfully, I found no blood on my clothing. No fingernail scars on my palm. My hands were clean.

I arrived a few minutes late for work.

“Ah,” Stanley said as I entered the office, “what time do you call this?”

“I’m sorry dude,” I said. “Just had a bit of…”

“I’m fucking with you,” Stanley said. “What are you thinking about tonight?”

“We could just go to the old bar again. It’s a safe bet.”

“Hm, safe yeah, but it’s not fun is it? What if we hit that new place a few blocks over. Sandy’s, is it?”

“I guess, but I’d...”

“Great! I’ll meet you there at seven.”

He winked and walked off with his mug of coffee in hand.

I sat at my desk and turned on my monitor. For the next few hours I mindlessly scrolled before continuing with the project I’d started a few days before. Stanley handed it to me. Said I am the only person he trusts with such a task. We’d started at that company the same day. Both juniors. Now I had managed a middleweight position and Stanley made project lead.

Work finished at 5 but we clocked out 20 minutes earlier.

“Let it be our little secret,” Stanley would say every day.

There was a familiarity to the bar. It turned out we’d been there before. When it was known as The Copper instead of Sandy’s. Except the owners weren’t the only things that had been exchanged. The little sofas in the corner had been replaced by wooden stools and tables. The pool table in the corner ripped out to make room for more sitting space. A side of the room cleared for live music.

“The usual?” Stanley asked.

I nodded.

He ordered me a cider and himself a vodka and coke. I claimed a table near the window. I enjoyed watching people pass in the streets.

“We’ve been here before,” I said.

“No we haven’t,” Stanley said. “It’s new.”

“The branding and the design is. But the bar is the same. Pretty sure that’s the same bartender the last time we came too.”

He looked into his glass for a moment, thinking.

“I would remember a place like this,” he said.

“Not if you drunk too much.”

He laughed, “Good point.”

The night moved on. People walked in and out. I kept an eye to the door and an ear to my friend, watching the crowd as they shuffled through. Eventually, through some slip in the conversation, we ended up at my dating life.

“What about the girl by the bar,” Stanley said, conspicuously turned around on his seat to stare.

“No,” I said, “we’re not doing this tonight.”

“Come on dude,” he turned back, “you’ve got to get yourself out there. We’re almost 30.”

“You’re 32,” I said, “and I’m a year younger.”

“Really?”

I nodded.

“Anyway, this girl. She looks like your type. You should really give it a chance.”

“She’s like 19, Stan.”

He shrugged, “Never stopped me.”

I sighed, “What does stop you.”

“Oh you know I’m all tied up now.”

“Never stopped you before.”

“Yeah well, I love this girl. Truly. More than I’ve ever loved anyone before. I love her so much she’s the only girl I’ve never cheated on. That’s the truth.”

I giggled, “Yeah well, cheers to that.”

I took leave to visit the toilet. Stanley said he’d grab us another round. By the time I got back, he’d yet to return from the bar. I found him still there, chatting up the girl he pointed out earlier. I sighed and sat back down at our table. Sipping the little drink I had left in my glass, I looked out again to the people passing through.

“Mind if I sit here a moment?” said a young man standing over the table.

“Um, sure,” I said.

He shuffled into the bench and leaned on the table. He looked up to me and smiled. If you asked Stanley the first thing he noticed in a person he was attracted to, he’d tell you it was the butt or the breasts. His preferences oscillated each time we went out. But the first thing I notice is the face. The man before me had a dimple under his lips that accentuated his smile. His green eyes that looked into me and, with ease, sought through.

“I’ve been watching you,” he said. “And your friend. Been waiting for a chance to come over.”

“Okay.”

“I know you’ve been watching me too.”

“I guess.”

“I’ll make this short before he gets back,” he said, placing a small piece of paper on the table and sliding it over to me. “Call me.”

He winked, stood up and walked off.

I took the paper and slid it into my jacket pocket. Stanley reappeared a moment later holding two pint glasses filled to the brim.

“Who was that?” he said.

“That...was Jane’s nephew,” I said.

“Isn’t he off in college?”

“Guess he’s back for the holidays.”

Stanley shrugged.

I woke up the next morning quite hungover and remembering little of the rest of the night. I let out a sigh of relief to not find the man laying in the bed next to me, although a tinge of regret would soon rear its head. I nursed my hangover for a few hours. First laying in bed then reheating some leftover food and devouring a pot of coffee. Eventually, I knew I had to return to the bar to retrieve my car.

Deciding to save on some money and get some fresh air on a clear day, I walked. It would have only taken 20 minutes after all. I passed by the residential streets leading out from my apartment. Each house almost identical in its design. Uniform houses for uniform families.

I found myself caught out of breath halfway down a street. A weakness crept over me and I felt as though I’d pass out. I managed to catch my hand on the waist-high fences of one of the houses. A sharp pain spread throughout the palm of my hand. I snatched it away. A sharp and rather large splinter penetrated the skin. A small stream of blood flowed down to my fingers.

The fence looked otherwise clean and well sanded. How such a splinter managed its way into my palm I don’t know. I looked up to the house. The exterior looked familiar—and not in the way of the rest of the houses on every street. All the blinds in the window were closed and the drive lacked a car. However, the front door stood open. A dark emptiness beyond its border.

I remembered. The metal baseball bat I had been given; the door that stood open; the family pictures hung on the wall; the peaceful faces that slept; the sound of a skull being cracked; the sofa ruined by blood; my hands are unclean.

I pressed my finger down to stop the trickling blood.

“I didn’t do anything,” I said to the house.

I heard Stanley’s laugh in response.
