In November 2022, 
Since Im obviously way to inexperienced to go on a camping trip in the Ozark forest -
My mom, brother, fiancée, and I took a trip to Mountain View, Arkansas for my birthday (I really wanted to see the fall leaves- instead of the traditional boring ole Texas fall season) 

We get settled into the air b&b. Then around nightfall decided we wanted to get some wine + beer for my birthday.. come to find out it’s a dry county. 

My fiancée and I took the car and mapped out the next town over about an hour to the liquor store. My mom and brother stayed behind. 

The route we took had us take a dark road behind the Ozark forest. The moonlight hitting the trees against the road and no light pollution in sight! 
My fiancée (driving) decided to park the car and turn it off so we can experience the darkness and how it would feel when we go camping out in the Ozark forest. About 3 minutes later I tell him to turn on the car and decide it’s not for me- no matter how hard I convince myself lol it’s pretty spooky and yet gorgeous out. 
We are about 35 minutes into the drive and finally make it to the liquor store (1 hour) - creepy town at night tv in a stroller and the town looked like it was off of ‘silent hill’ or ‘land of a thousand corpses’ so quiet and very unfamiliar to me. 

We grab our drinks and get back in the car and I’m driving this time. 
About 25 minutes into the drive back we are literally losing our minds because the low fuel light came on and we had 0 cell phone reception. Freaking out about how to tell my mom and brother we are stranded! Shocker we are driving in the gas guzzling 4runner. 
We made it past the Ozark forest road and the roads start to look familiar again. 

We drove around a curve and what I saw.. I truly can’t make sense of. It drives me crazy. I could live with it and play the my mind played tricks on me etc. EXCEPT that my fiancée saw it to!!!!!

As we were driving around the curve we saw an old woman’s body with her head resting against the tree and her hand in front of it- in all white- face appeared all in white. Her body looked like it morphed with a tree as if she was camouflaged!! After I saw the figure- I KNEW I saw something and it wasn’t my mind. I asked my fiancée if he saw it too…. He said yes and I made him describe what he saw. I said he saw a lady in the forest against the tree. I decided to turn the car around and drive back around the curve and of course we didn’t see it again. Once we drove around x2 to see if we saw it again- the low fuel indicator dinged again reminding me we are nearly out of freaking gas!- I booked it to the gas station. 
Thanking god almighty himself that we finally made it to the Walmart gas station. When we got back to the air b&b I 100% didn’t feel like drinking then. I was ready to drive back home. 

1. I would’ve never thought to post this story here- however I can’t find anything online, maps, etc that could explain what we saw

I was thinking a paranormal ghost, witch? or something else? Anyone have any similar experiences in Arkansas?
