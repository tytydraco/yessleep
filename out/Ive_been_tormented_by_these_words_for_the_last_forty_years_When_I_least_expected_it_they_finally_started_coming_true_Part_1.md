*When Death approaches, it will not rise from the earth, nor will it be wearing a cloak or wielding a scythe. Death will arrive from a foreign land, bearing eyes like brilliant jades and hair the color of chestnuts, and it will broadcast only peace. In truth, it does not know what it delivers, but it will deliver it all the same. Little by little, step by step, it conjures Apocalypse.*

*A stranded Leviathan. Angel’s wings clipped. A curtain of night under a bejeweled sky. The demise of a king amidst a sweeping Tempest. Finally, an inferno, wrathful and pure, spreading from sea to sea, cleansing mankind from this world.*

*Listen closely, child: once the inferno ignites, there will be no halting Death’s steady march. Excavate its jades from their hallowed sockets, and their visions of Apocalypse will cease. Leave them be, and you will bear witness to the conflagration that devours humanity.*

*Tell no one what you heard here today.*

\------------------

What do you call a prophecy that is endlessly foretold but never actually comes true? Reminder after reminder after reminder, the words come, but they never bring anything else with them. Can you even call it a prophecy?

I was eleven when I first heard the prophecy detailed above. Received my first letter a few weeks later, recounting the words to me in harsh red ink. No explanation, no return address. The cryptic message was disconcerting and unexplainable, but manageably so. It started as something I could rationalize into submission, quelling the terror by convincing myself it was all some extremely odd prank. That initial letter was just the beginning, though.

Every avalanche has a first snowflake to fall, I guess.

Honestly, I couldn’t tell you how many times I’ve endured that series of words in that particular order over my lifetime. I’d probably ballpark the total to be hovering somewhere in the hundreds of thousands. That’s a conservative estimate, too. The damn thing has been like an infestation, each syllable a skittering termite gnawing through the folds of my brain, eating away the foundation, making my soul flimsy and brittle.

That said, I think it’s finally happening, and I’m afraid of what’s coming. I’m terrified about what I might do, and I’m equally terrified about what might happen if I do nothing. Thus, I’m posting documentation of it all online. I need opinions external to the situation to help guide me. Unbiased review that will ground my actions firmly in reality from here on out.

Though, if those words actually *do* predict a theoretical apocalypse, I suppose we’re all internal to the situation, you lot are just a bit farther away from the epicenter.

\------------------

If memory serves, the whispers followed the letters, and the calls followed the whispers. The reminders began small, but God did they escalate quickly.

About half-a-year after the first letter arrived, the whispers started. Whenever I was in a crowded space, like a subway car or a marketplace, delicate murmurs would curl into my ear. They had a sort of “surround sound” quality to them, warning me about the arrival of a green-eyed harbinger from every direction all at once, which made determining their point of origin basically impossible.

The calls were next. Anytime I was home alone, the phone would invariably ring. When I answered, a deep, robotic voice on the other end would begin subjecting me to those words.

I think I was fifteen when that initial call came through. Believing the droning, tinny speech had to be prerecorded, I said something like:

“*Hah. Hilarious, asshole,”* expecting that the person playing the recording would start talking over it, slinging an insult or two back in my direction.

But when I spoke, the voice immediately paused. Once a few seconds had passed, it simply resumed the prophecy where it left off, seemingly unbothered by the interruption. Stunned, I let the voice finish the entire thing, at which point it just started reciting the prophecy from the beginning again.

One time, I picked up the call but set the phone down on a nearby couch cushion instead of reflexively hanging up, figuring that inducing boredom in my tormentor was the only real counteroffensive at my disposal. When I returned to the phone, nearly three hours later, I found that the voice was *still* going. I couldn’t know for sure that they hadn’t taken a break in their oration while I wasn't listening, but it sure as hell felt like they’d go on forever if I gave them the forum to do so.

Not answering the phone was an option, but often it was just as stressful as answering, as the voice would just call non-stop until I picked up. Overtime, I grew incredibly apprehensive of the shrill chiming of our telephone. The sound alone caused electric panic to gallop down the length of my spine.

It was a lot for my young mind, and it only got worse as time went on.

Letters started coming in weekly, as opposed to monthly. The whispers made me anxious in public; the calls made anxious when I was alone. And despite the inescapable reminders, none of the prophecy came to pass. I began to wonder why my tormentors were putting so much effort into reminding me to be vigilant for signs of something that never seemed to actually happen. The inherent contradiction drove me up a fucking wall.

Not only that, but I found it nearly impossible to confide in anyone about the harassment. Somehow, the idea of disclosing what was happening to me generated substantially more fear and anxiety than the actual torment did. On days where I’m feeling level-headed, I attribute that to conditioning. The last line of the prophecy, the favorite instrument of my tormentors, was “*tell no one what you heard here today*”, after all. It would make sense that going against that deeply ingrained order may inspire an ill-defined but all-consuming terror to bloom within me.

On days where I’m feeling not so level-headed, however, I find my mind going elsewhere. With logic out the window, I flirt with some more ethereal explanations, the likes of curses, cosmic decrees, voodoo…you get the idea.

Even with all that, the situation was still manageable. Getting less manageable with each passing day, but I still felt like I had a handle on it. I could at least comprehend how this hyper-specific torment was possible. Imaging some weirdo getting his proverbial rocks off by reciting those godforsaken words at me in every way they could think of minimized the terror. Made it undeniably human.

Unfortunately, that rationalization could only stretch so far before it snapped.

One afternoon, I was lounging in the living room, catching up on my favorite sitcom. Television was where I found peace and refuge. It functioned as an intermediary between being truly alone and being submerged in a crowd, both places where those words liked to seethe and fester. My last bastion against the prophecy, glorious and impenetrable.

But when the show flicked on, there she was.

The abrupt premiere of a new character, one with chocolate-colored hair and mossy irises. An exchange student from across the Atlantic. In this family-friendly, strictly G-rated show, the cast of normally goofy characters *despised* the stranger. They acted repulsed by her in a way that I found deeply distressing, given the context. Called her names, ostracized her, gave her the cold shoulder, the works. As if that wasn’t enough, the episode’s narrative arc included all of the following: a bus crash, a dead bird, and a school blackout while fireworks lit up the heavens for the Fourth of July.

In other words: *A stranded Leviathan, an angel with clipped wings, and a curtain of night under a bejeweled sky.*

The exchange student didn’t return in the follow-up installment, which resulted in an episode-long celebration of her departure. From what I remember, throwaway dialogue heavily implied that the protagonist killed her off screen.

Bewilderment overpowered me as I stood slack-jawed in front of the TV. It just wasn’t possible. I prayed for it all to be the byproduct of some fucked-up fever dream, but if that’s the case, I’m still very much waiting to wake up.

From there, the prophecy was all avalanche and no snowflake.

Elaborate graffiti that depicted a green-eyed harbinger overlooking a lake of fire now appeared on my walk to school. If I changed my path, the graffiti would eventually crop up somewhere along the alternative route. Locker-fulls of prophecy lines scribbled on small shards of paper would regularly spill out of the compartment when I opened it like a looseleaf typhoon. On my grandmother’s deathbed, I swear I heard her mutter “*Little by little, step by step, it conjures Apocalypse”* under her breath. Of course, I was the only one with her at the time.

Let’s just say my early twenties were a struggle.

I never went to college, fearing that I would owe some explanation to my dorm mates for those intrusive words that I simply did not have. When my parents died, I became a bit of a recluse. Dark, lonely years that I’m happy to report did not last forever.

The human brain really is an amazing machine. Given enough time, it can adapt to any set of circumstances, no matter how utterly inane.

Eventually, I found myself progressively unbothered by the prophecy’s frequent incursions. It’s not like the parade of oddities was slowing down at the time, either. I can recall plenty of commercials, fortune cookies, and skywriting during my thirties that can attest to that fact. But I realized the words couldn’t hurt me in and of themselves, and the jade-eyed foreigner never materialized, so what was there to be afraid of? In the end, I had a life to live. I just decided to grow around the strangeness, like vines molding their expansion around a chain-link fence.

Moved to the coast for work in my mid-thirties, married my wife of now twenty years soon after. The reminders actually disappeared during that time. When they were finally gone, I hardly even noticed. Desensitization is a hell of a thing.

But something dawned on me before I started typing this up. An association that I should have made a long, long time ago.

The reminders only stopped once I returned to where I was infested with the prophecy in the first place.

And now, a green-eyed, brown-haired stranger has moved in next door, and I feel like something awful is coming.

——————-

Let me detail what I remember about meeting “The Seer” and hearing the prophecy for the first time.

I was eleven, and my family’s annual vacation to the coast had been decidedly uneventful up until that point. In fact, I really don’t harbor any vivid memories from those trips *other* than that chance five-minute encounter. Those three hundred seconds remain seared into my consciousness; each minute detail painstakingly cataloged for further scrutiny and review.

My recollection begins with me walking through the boardwalk arcade into a U-shaped room which housed all the pinball machines. It’s almost closing time, and there’s no one else around. I’m sauntering from machine to machine, drinking in the vibrant lights and colors, dragging my hand across their cold metal bodies as I go.

*“Care to hear your fortune, my child?”* a voice unexpectedly cooed.

Startled, I leap back. My head swivels wildly, trying to locate whoever just spoke, but the room is still completely empty. In the silence, however, I hear something else. The faint thrumming of a harp, emanating from a space obscured by the chassis of a massive pinball machine in the very back of the room.

Entranced by the airy melody, I cautiously pace forward.

Wedged in the corner, I see a tall, odd-looking crate with a narrow, brightly lit window at the top. The crate itself was unlike anything I’d seen before; shaped like a telephone box, but made of weathered, splintering wood like a coffin.

From behind the dusty plexiglass, someone or something repeats the question.

*“Care to hear your fortune, my child?”*

The voice is spilling from a disembodied face contained within a small, hollowed-out cubby, no bigger than a few square feet. Two miniature spotlights at the base of the compartment illuminate it. Crisp, gold typography above the window proclaims, “*Bear Witness to The Seer, Last of Her Kind*”. The face's skin is ivory colored and inconsistently textured. Smooth and silken areas contrast with rough, creased ones, creating a patchwork appearance, almost as if someone stitched the finished product together using many different models. There is no scalp, head or skull to speak of - just a sliver of a face, thin and floppy like deli meat. Two horizontal slits are present where eyes *should* be, but the eyes themselves are absent. Instead, sickly white light explodes through the orifices from below. Four slick black fishhooks curve around its closed lips - two under the top lip, two under the bottom lip. Right before it speaks, the mechanical barbs violently crook the mouth open. In response, the face stretches unnaturally, forming an oblong cavity that nearly runs the entire length of the compartment.

It seems to scream, but all that comes out is blinding light. I gaze into its dislocated jaw until I hear it recite those terrible words from the fathomless depths of its motionless mouth, and that’s where my memory ends.

\------------------

Ari, a young Icelandic man, has been here for almost a week now.

He’s pleasant enough. Quiet and reserved, keeps to himself for the most part.

Until today, I’d convinced myself his arrival was just a very unlucky coincidence. Something that was going to reopen scars, but nothing more damaging than that. However, I was sitting at the kitchen table having breakfast with Lucy this morning when Ari jogged by our dining-room window, waving to the both of us as he did.

My wife recoiled at the sight of him.

*“Everything okay, Lucy?”*

“*Yeah, I’m alright. Just some bad memories.”*

I felt my heart begin to thunder against the inside of my chest.

*“…how do you mean?”*

She threw me a weak smile, and then her eyes started darting around the room. Lucy picked at her fingernails, clearly fighting back a wave of anxiety.

*“Oh…it’s nothing, Meg. Really.”*

I needed to say it. Agony attempted to sew my lips shut, but in the end, I needed to know those words meant nothing to her.

For the first time in my life, I was the one reciting the prophecy.

“*When the end approaches, it will not rise from the earth, nor will it be wearing a cloak or wielding a scythe. Death will arrive from a foreign land, bearing eyes like brilliant jades…”*

As I spoke, I watched her pupils dilate and her features became swollen with dread.

*“How the fuck do* ***you*** *know those words?”*
