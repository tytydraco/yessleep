There was a little guy who used to live in my toilet. No lie. I don't know how he got there, I don't know much about him, really. One day, I sat myself down and went about my business. The next thing I knew, I heard a little grunt. Through the gap between my legs I saw him hanging from the underside of the porcelain rim--right where the little openings are for the water to enter the bowl from the tank. 

As if he had been waiting for me to start watching him, at that moment a long, silent tendril began to erupt from the crown of his bald, fleshy white head. Like those videos of plants growing in double speed. He has two downturned little eyes--basset hound droop. A sad customer. Maybe because of where he has to live. But he stared me down with those eyes as his head-stalk snaked its way into the tepid toilet water. 

It touched the surface, went farther in. Submerged. After some time, the little guy grunted again. It sounded to my ears like a cat when it gets comfortable and curls up. A chirping sigh, but with an edge. This wasn't a cat--it was a little guy, hanging on the inside of my toilet bowl. 

His head stalk turned green, like a litmus strip. Then it began a slow retraction. When it had fully returned to its sheath, I managed to collect myself enough to stutter out a word or two.

I said: "What... the fuck... are you?"

Then I jumped off the bowl and pulled up my pants--zipped, buttoned. My hand went unconsciously to the flush handle, but I stopped it before I washed the little guy away--at least... that's what I expected would happen. It made sense. But I soon noticed, upon further examination, that he didn't have any legs. He was... suctioned?... to the porcelain. 

Because of the color of his thin, veiny skin, he looked almost like a growth. An ulcer on the toilet itself--a skin tag. But porcelain can't grow skin tags... or ulcers, for that matter.

I didn't want to touch him, obviously. Why would I do that? He could have been infected with something--could have been an infection himself. My only course of action was to crouch there, ogling over the sulfurous odor of my prior movement. 

The little guy can't talk. He can only make those little grunts I described before. And dependent on the tone, they can indicate something good--or something very bad. I'd told him I needed to flush, and he didn't seem perturbed, so I pushed the paddle and watched anxiously while the water swirled the bowl, carrying the sunny hue down the drain. It was replaced clear, and the little guy remained. A little wet, but unmoved.

As one does, I returned to the bathroom multiple times that day, always checking to see if my little toilet friend was still there. Each time, he was. Each time, his head-stalk would slither down into my fluid and take a test. Green... green... green... always green. I guessed that was a good thing. Green is the universal color of good things. Green means "go," green is the color of things you're supposed to eat, but probably don't eat enough of, cause they're hard to make taste as good as things that are red and brown and yellow. 

At work, I never dared tell my colleagues about my little friend. They'd have me sent to HR, or carted off to the psych ward. I could show them a picture, I guess, but then there would be questions. *I placed it there,* or *I Photoshopped that.* If I brought them over to see him, then they'd call the police, or the military, or someone like that, and they'd use a chisel to scrape my little friend off the bowl into an evidence bag, and they'd carry him away to study in a lab under scalpels and hot doctor's lamps. 

No.

The only reason I'm writing this post now is because of events I will soon detail. Just know that before, when these events were in full swing, I felt a strong and inexplicable connection to the little guy in my toilet. He was not a threatening presence, but a protective one. A curious and exploratory visitor. All he would do, whenever I used the facilities, was erect his stalk and probe the waters. Nothing more, nothing less.

My mother visited me once, and needed to use the bathroom. I told her the plumbing was shot and needed repairing--the plumber was coming the day after and would have it sorted then. She asked to go anyway, but without flushing. I told her that was disgusting--there would be no stagnant piss in my house.

And what would the little guy think?

This would be a whole different person's liquid. A whole new profile of... whatever it was he was sensing with his head-stalk. It wouldn't be right to confuse him. 

So my mother had to go next door to Barbara and use her guest bathroom. Good. Then I found myself wondering if Barbara had her own little guy in *her* toilet. Maybe he looked the same as my little guy, or maybe his skin was a different color; maybe his eyes were less sad. 

I think it was around three months after my first encounter with the little guy. My bladder was calling, but I'd recently been having some pain in my pelvis and stomach. It was strange, and I'd wanted to wait some time before heading to the doctor. Maybe I was scared of what they would say. Since the start of that month, my little guy had turned up colors other than green--yellow, off-green, puke-green. But as a consequence of his being unable to speak, I could only hazard guesses as to what the change meant. Was I not eating enough vegetables?

That day, I got my answer.

I sat down and relaxed my insides. Things began to flow--slower than normal. And pain... so much pain. It came out red as Kool-aid, filled with chunks. And it was hot, too. Steaming. Boiling. I screamed out in agony and fear, praying for it to stop, but it wouldn't. I was bleeding out. All the blood in my body was being leaked; it would stop when I was dead and cold, frozen seated and stiff on the toilet for someone to find once the smell penetrated through the drywall. 

Eventually, it lessened to a trickle, and I felt faint. How much blood had I lost? The skin on my hands and bare legs was bone white. I could feel my heart thumping harder in my chest, trying to accommodate the sudden drop in flow. Then I started to cry. Hard and ugly. I put my aching head on my knees, and that offered me a glimpse at the little guy underneath me. He was shriveled up like a raisin.

Dead.

I cried harder. Everything seemed hopeless. 

That was four years ago. Now I'm in remission, but I still carry the fear that I might look down in the bowl one day and see him there. The little guy growing off the porcelain, with his head-stalk. It was a warning I didn't know how to interpret. But now... I do.

So if you see a little guy in *your* toilet, just remember what I'm telling you. Remember this story. Don't ignore the signs, or you'll end up like me.
