I knew one day I would have to tell this story. It took me a year to finally sit down and do it. I’ve been told that doing this could help me move on, but that’s not what this is for. I don’t expect to move on. The girl in 402 will always be with me. I’m telling this story, simply, because I have to.

 

I lived there for two years. It was a tiny little unit, tucked away on the very right of the fourth floor. Bachelor is almost generous. It was the kind of dingy place that never looks bright no matter how many lights you have on, but I liked it. I’m good with a small space, I enjoy not having that much to take care of. I could do without the bug problems, the leaks, the electrical problems, and the rotten smells that just sort of happen, but it is what it is.

 

There was a level of comfort, as well, to living on the fourth floor. Nobody robs a random fourth floor apartment unit. Nobody can peek into your window. It’s unlikely to get shot at… Yeah, I lived in one of those kinds of cities. You didn’t walk around at night if you could help it. You just didn’t.

 

I got accustomed to noise there. The cars, the sirens, the dogs barking, the shouting, the occasional echoing pop of a gunshot. It all becomes a whirling auditory soup. I learned to tune it out fairly quickly. In fact, I learned to tune out a lot of things.

 

I was in one of those periods of life that I think some people call “the grind” but really it’s more like being beaten into submission. Working to live, living to work – not living at all, just continuing to exist. All of this to say, I wasn’t very perceptive or sociable at this time. I was sleepwalking and daydreaming through life.

 

I’d say I could do my routine blindfolded except for the fact that I would stub my toe in the same spot on the coffee table 4 times a week at least. Funny how that works. I guess that was part of the routine too. But that’s what I mean about not being perceptive. The building could’ve caught fire and most days I probably wouldn’t have noticed until I actually went up in flames. I didn’t retain any faces I saw or names I heard. It was all just a blur, each day blending into the next. Until one night.

 

I got home from work like usual in the evening as the sun began to descend past the buildings. I couldn’t afford a car, but thankfully my work was close enough to walk to. The days were getting shorter now so my walks home became more brisk.

 

The apartment still smelled of dust and paint as they had finally sent someone to replace a moldy bit of wall the day before. I could still feel the sensation of dust collecting on my tongue when I opened my mouth and it getting sucked into my nose with every inhale. The smell of paint was strong, but infinitely better than some of the other smells.

 

I opened the window to attempt to ventilate the place, I emptied the bucket of rust coloured water collecting in the bathroom (they couldn’t be bothered to fix that as well), and I collapsed onto my bed. This was my ritual. After every work day, I would always take 10-15 minutes to just spread out on my bed like a cat and decompress from everything. But tonight, after about two minutes, I heard a noise.

 

This noise stood out from all the outdoor soup because it sounded a lot closer, and it sounded like a voice. A soft, feminine voice; making some kind of subtle moan or whimper. I froze in place. It startled me. It sounded SO close. Like it might be in the room. I didn’t move a muscle; I didn’t want to make a noise. I wanted to hear it again so I could tell where it was coming from. For a second I thought it might be coming from under my bed.

 

After a few seconds, the sound repeated. A faint, girly whimper. A bit louder than the last one. This time I could tell where it was coming from. It was behind me. Specifically, the other side of the wall behind my bed. That gave me some relief. It was my neighbor.

 

But then I was confused. I didn’t remember EVER hearing my neighbor making noise before. If I could suddenly hear a noise that soft, that mild, why couldn’t I hear anything before? Did I even have a neighbor before? Is this person new? I felt a rush of shame at just how detached I had become.

 

I reached back into my mind to try and recall any memories I had about my neighbor. I couldn’t find a single one. I remembered some people being on my floor, but I couldn’t remember ever seeing anyone enter or exit the door next to mine. I did, however, recall seeing people yesterday morning trying to move a couch up the stairs in the lobby. It was a fairly regular occurrence to see things like this. People rotated in and out of this place all the time. I suppose nobody else really wanted to stick around that long, and I can see why. But I guess that answers it. As peculiar as it is, I didn’t have a neighbor before - for two years - and now I do. And now they’re… whimpering? Why are they whimpering?

 

Slowly these sporadic whimpers become more defined sobs. A woman was crying. I didn’t know what to do. I just decided to be as quiet as possible and put on some headphones to let them have their privacy and spare myself from feeling any more awkward. It felt wrong to hear this, and I immediately felt bad for this person. I made sure to play some extra loud music.

 

About an hour later, I removed my headphones and the noises had stopped in the interim. I very briefly debated going over and telling them about how thin the walls apparently are, but I made the much easier decision to wait. Wait until they do something loud and not so private so I can use that as the excuse. Like the TV or something. I was weighing my options. But I couldn’t talk to them about THIS. I couldn’t say “Hey you were crying real loud over there.”

 

The rest of the night was quiet but I didn’t have the best sleep. This disturbance in the routine, and the thought of having to face this person at some point was giving me some anxiety. By the morning, however, the alarm kicked me back into the routine. I heard no noises from the neighbor, so life resumed.

 

I got back home from work that night, much later than usual because someone decided to no-show at work. Walking home in the dark made me paranoid and I hated days when this happened. When I got inside I was relieved, and the dust and paint were not nearly as oppressive to the senses this time. I did the window, the water bucket, and then collapsed on the bed like clockwork. What happened yesterday was still on my mind, so I made sure to be extra quiet when laying down. After a few seconds of silence, I was ready to try and remove the whole ordeal from my brain. Then I heard the voice.

 

I couldn’t make out the first word I heard from the other side of the wall, but I listened for the rest.

 

“It was a poetry book.” I heard in a muffled but distinctly feminine voice. Quieter than yesterday, I thought. She must be further away from the wall.

 

“I can’t remember exactly.”

 

“It always feels like we’re going somewhere.”

 

“Maybe that’s why we see them most at night.”

 

“I mixed up our glasses.”

 

There was a moderate gap of a few seconds between everything she said. Clearly, I was only hearing half of a conversation. Phone conversation most likely, or else the other person is just insanely quiet.

 

It was difficult to gauge her tone from how muffled the voice was, but there was a kind of melancholy in it. I wondered what was going on, and I kind of laughed at how random the phrases were. I thought about listening further but I stopped myself. It wasn’t my business. It’s not for me to hear. I once again thought about going over and letting her know about the noise, but it didn’t feel like a good time. I put on my headphones once again to try and enjoy the minimal amount of respite I had left in the day, and that was the end of it for that night.

 

The third night I got home on time. I was a bit surprised not to hear anything from her at first. I guessed that maybe she went to bed early or went out for the night. It was Friday after all, usually people do things on Friday nights. I still made sure to be quiet when near her wall just in case she was sleeping. I made a mental note to look up how much soundproofing panels cost. I probably should have thought of that earlier.

 

I got up from my 15 minute “work sucks” bed sprawling and headed over to my computer to do that important research, but – as I often did – I forgot my coffee table exists and I stubbed my toe. The heavy table shifted inches across the wooden floor and pain shot through me like a shockwave. I don’t remember which expletive left my mouth involuntarily that time, but it was definitely one of them. I was so annoyed. Every damn time. I could just move the table, why don’t I ever just move the fucking table?

 

“Are you okay?” My heart leapt in my chest. I physically jumped back on one leg. I thought she wasn’t home, and I forgot how close she could sound. It scared the shit out of me. She also spoke quite loudly, she probably assumed it would be harder to hear through the wall than it was.

 

“Oh. Yeah. I’m good. Sorry. I just stubbed my toe.” I responded back in a shaky voice.

 

 “Shit. That sucks.” I could hear a chuckle in her voice, she was clearly amused. Her volume decreased to match mine.

 

I laughed in return, “It happens ALL the time… So sorry to disturb you.”

 

“No no it’s fine, I’m just reading… You sure you’re good? That sounded violent.” She responded, sounding half-concerned and half-joking.

 

“Yeah, no, I’m alright. It sounded worse than it was. It’s a heavy table and… the walls here-“ I began to explain before she cut me off.

 

“They’re REALLY thin, huh?” She finished my thought and then continued, “I can hear you so well, that’s insane. I’m surprised I didn’t hear you before now.”

 

“Yeah I guess I’m quiet... And, well, I’m at work most of the day and get home late. So.” I didn’t like how awkward I sounded. I think I forgot how to have normal conversations.

 

“Has it been noisy for you? I’m sorry if it was, I didn’t know. I just moved in.” She sounded very kind, and friendly. I was taken aback by it a little bit.

 

“Oh, don’t be sorry and… Nothing much. I think I probably heard you talking on the phone a bit the other night. I didn’t listen in or anything, I put on my headphones.” I explained. I hoped she believed me about the headphones. It was the truth but, it’s hard to trust that sort of thing. I didn’t mention the crying, I didn’t want her to feel awkward or anything.

 

“Oh. Sorry about that...” She said. I detected a hint of confusion in her voice but I ignored it.

 

“It’s okay. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you earlier. I just didn’t know when it would be a good time and... It’s new to me too. I didn’t have a neighbor before, I don’t think.” As I spoke, I found it harder to rationalize why I hadn’t told her before now… I really should have.

 

“Really? How long have you been here?” She asked.

 

“Two years.”

 

“No one lived here before me for two years? Are you sure?” She was very perplexed.

 

“Well… Honestly, no, I’m not sure. I just never heard anyone before, and I never saw anyone before.” I probably sounded like a total recluse, but I was more interested in why she was so confused.

 

“Oh. That’s strange… I’m pretty sure there were people living here right before me, at least that’s what the guy said.” Her tone had shifted, and what she said sent a bit of a shiver down my spine. It didn’t make any sense. How could I not hear them, not once, when I can practically hear this woman breathing?

 

After a brief silence, she spoke again and returned to a more casual tone “Well… Maybe they weren’t around much. Maybe it was a second home or something. Anyways, sorry again about the noise. I’ll get some soundproofing stuff for my end right away.” I admired her positivity, and I didn’t feel any judgment from her for how strange I probably came across. It was really nice. And she had a point about it being a second home. That could be the case. I don’t know why they would have a second home in this shitty building but… What else could the explanation be?

 

“I’m Jane by the way. Nice to kind-of meet you.” She added in a chipper manner. While it was refreshing to have such a pleasant interaction, a small part of me worried about her. She was so carefree and optimistic – almost naïve. She must be new to the city. I wondered how long it would take before this place whittled away at her trust in humanity. The trust that she seemed to give to me so freely. The thought of her spirits being slowly crushed like mine made me sad.

 

“I’m Leigh. Nice to meet you too.” A small impulse told me not to give my name, but I decided to reciprocate her trust. “And yeah, I’ll soundproof my end too.”

 

“Have a good rest of your night. And be careful.” She said. I found that slightly ominous but then I remembered the toe thing.

 

“I will.” I chuckled. “Enjoy your book.”

 

That was my first conversation with the girl in 402. Over that weekend, we spent a lot of time getting acclimated to each others’ presence as we each waited to get our soundproofing. I expected it to be a lot more awkward than it was. I attribute all of that to her. She had a way of making everything seem fine, and almost playful. She would knock on the wall two times and say things like “about to vacuum, sorry” And “my bad” when she would make noise. I would follow her lead and do the same two knocks. It was kind of nice.

 

Out of the blue on Sunday, she knocked twice and said “You know… it’s weird. I don’t hear my neighbors on the other side at all. Only you.” We pondered over that a bit. She didn’t seem to sweat it much, but it WAS odd that it was only on one side. These odd things were beginning to stack up. Why just this wall? Why only now? I began to wonder if more odd things have been happening all along and I’m only starting to notice them now.

 

Monday night I got home to find my package had arrived. The soundproofing was here. It was a little bittersweet seeing it on my doorstep. I knocked twice and told her I got it. She confirmed that she got her’s too. She actually went out and physically bought it. I guess that speaks to the kind of people we are.

 

We both said we’d put it up right away. Both of us not wanting to continue to inconvenience each other any longer… But then that didn’t end up happening. Instead we just kept talking. I didn’t mean to, and I don’t think she did either, but we just kept finding more to say. The friendly small talk about the building and whatnot gave way to more meaningful conversation. We talked about how we got to where we were. We talked about where we wanted to go from here. I wound up sitting on the floor with my back to her wall and I could her hear words right behind my head as if we were back-to-back. Luckily the paint on that bit of wall was dry by now.

 

To her, this place was a fresh start. She didn’t go into detail, and I didn’t want to pry, but it was clear that this was some kind of escape from something. Maybe that’s why she was so upbeat, because she was able to escape a bad situation. Or maybe, she was just always this upbeat.

 

She told me that she was going to enroll in the college here, and that she was going to start an online shop, and work as a waitress on the side. Eventually she wanted to open a restaurant. She even told me where, and what the name and theme would be. She told me all these plans, all these wonderful things she wanted to do, all laid out step by step. I don’t know what was preventing her from doing them before, but it made me smile hearing how excited she was about them. Something about the conviction in her voice made me truly believe she could do it all.

 

Then she asked me about my plans. I froze up a bit. I didn’t have plans. I wish I did, I was envious of people who did, but I could never seem to figure it out. At some point I think I shut that part of me off entirely.

 

“This was as far as I got” is what I told her. We sat in silence for a bit after that.

 

“There’s still time.” she said softly, breaking the silence. I could feel in her voice a new level of comfort and safety. All guards were down on both sides. She knew what I needed to hear, and I knew somehow that those words meant more coming from her than they would anyone else. We simply got each other. In that moment, there was no wall.

 

Eventually we said goodnight, and agreed to put the panels up tomorrow. Those soft, comforting words rattled around in my brain all night long. They never really left.

 

I woke up early the next day, and I began putting them up before work. It was a bit sad at first, but it’s not like she was gone or anything. She was still right next door. We could just be friends normally now. I went to work excited about the idea.

 

On my way home, I decided that I would properly introduce myself face to face. Just to say hi. I felt confident enough in doing so by this point of knowing her. I got up to the door of 402, and after a brief hesitation, I did the two knocks.

 

About two minutes passed and there was no answer. I tried again. Still nothing. I was disappointed but not dejected. She must not be around. I’ll try again tomorrow, I thought.

 

When I got inside, I was immediately struck by how much quieter it was. All that constant city noise was getting absorbed by the panels. I didn’t even think about that. I wasn’t used to this kind of quiet. Now every small sound was large. I felt vulnerable. Like all the noise was a big comfy blanket I could hide under and now I’m exposed like a nerve. It would take some getting used to.

 

An hour passed in this utter dreary silence. I tried to brave it without distraction to try and acclimate as quickly as possible, but it was just too freaky, so I had to put on some music.

 

Not five seconds into the song, I heard “No way!” coming from the wall. It was her.

 

“Jane? You can still hear me??” I almost shouted in disbelief.

 

“Did you put your things up?” She responded; her voice was exactly as clear as before.

 

“Yeah! Did you?”

 

“I covered the whole wall!” She shouted.

 

“What the hell?” I was feeling mixed emotions. On one hand, it was nice to talk to her again. On the other hand… What the hell?

 

We were both utterly stumped by this. Neither of us could come up with an explanation or a solution. She offered to try and ask the super to come do something. I told her she could TRY.

 

Eventually we settled back down and accepted the situation.

 

“Well… Shit, I guess you’re here to stay.” She said.

 

“I guess I am.” I couldn’t tell if she was happy about this or annoyed. I couldn’t quite tell if I was either.

 

“Alright… I hope you like ABBA then.”

 

I hated ABBA. This was a nightmare.

 

We resumed our routine from the days before. It remained mildly inconvenient, while also being oddly comforting. That night we talked more, sat in the same spots on the floor as the night before. I don’t know why we chose to sit on the floor when both of our beds were right there, but it felt right. The discoloration of the new patch of paint on the wall marked the talking spot perfectly, and it felt a bit nostalgic. It’s not often you sit on the floor as an adult.

 

With all the excess noise being drowned out, it felt like she was even closer. I could literally hear her breathing. We talked a little bit about our upbringings, and we aren’t terribly different. Her dad sucked, my dad died. We all got fucked up somehow. The good news is, she informed me that I don’t snore loudly at night which is a huge relief.

 

I laid up in bed, after she had said goodnight. I still hadn’t acclimated to the silence, and now I had to bear it if I wanted to sleep. It wasn’t working. I was just awake with my thoughts, which is a place I usually hate being, but not so much tonight.

 

I thought about Jane, and I thought about the weirdness of this situation. As odd as it all was, it was at least interesting. By far the most interesting thing to happen to me since I moved here. I began having those middle of the night urges to google the principles of sound waves and how they travel. Or how often apartments are vacant for long periods of time. But I resisted, determined that if I laid here unmoving in the dark long enough, sleep would happen.

 

Briefly piercing the silence, I heard a mattress creak a few times and blankets shift. It sounded like she rolled over. Then back to nothing.

 

I checked the clock. 2 am. Maybe sleep was hopeless. I stared into the dark of my apartment so long I started seeing abstract shapes and folds fade in and out of the shadows and the walls seemed to wobble, as they are want to do. I was so tired.

 

I began to fade but then another mattress creak brought me back to lucidity. This one was different. It was a deeper creak, and singular, like one fluid motion. She sat up.

 

Without question, that was the sound... But that was the only sound. No creaks, no fidgeting, no swiping sounds of blankets moving while she slowly awoke. It was strange and abrupt. It could be that she had a nightmare, but there was no heavy breathing or gasping or any of that.

 

I waited to hear another sound, but it didn’t come. A half hour passed. I didn’t hear her get out of bed, I didn’t hear her lay back down. Was she just… sitting? My mind began to paint of picture of a woman sitting still in bed in the pitch black darkness and it unnerved me.

 

Maybe she did lay back down, just slowly and softly enough that I didn’t hear it, I thought. Maybe she had her book or something - she said she was reading the other day. Maybe she never sat up at all, and I mistook that sound for something else.

 

I didn’t hear anything else that night, and about an hour later I managed to get some sleep.

 

I wondered if I could bring this up to her. Would it be weird? Eventually I decided against it. I don’t want her thinking about me listening to her sleep. The situation is already a bit uncomfortable as it is when it comes to privacy. Plus, it was probably nothing.

 

The next night I got home and double knocked on the wall. She double knocked back. This was our new normal.

 

“Hey, never date a tennis player. You know why?” She said.

 

“Why’s that?” I responded through my grin as I dealt with the water bucket once again.

 

“Love means nothing to them.” She made sure to sound extra dramatic.

 

“That’s – wow. That’s tremendous.” I responded, bemused.

 

“I’m gonna hit you with one of those every day, I decided.” She said emphatically.

 

“Oh god.” I pretended to sound annoyed.

 

“That’s right. This is why I don’t have a boyfriend. They all run away. But you can’t run away.”

 

“I can move away.”

 

“No you can’t, you’re broke as shit just like me. If you could have, you would have by now.” She had a point.

 

“So deal with it. Here: what do you call a beehive with no exit?” She continued.

 

“No. No more. This is harassment. I weep for your future husband... When you bring a man over, I’m going to shout at him to run as fast as he can. I will just scream bloody murder until he leaves.”

 

“Un-BEE-LEAVE-able.”

 

“God damn it. I like that one.” I replied, I couldn’t lie.

 

“Also I’m never bringing a man over here, are you kidding? You hear enough as it is.” Again, she had a point.

 

We went about our business, and later that night we talked a bit more. These floor chats before bed we’d started having had become a highlight of my day and I began looking forward to them while I was at work.

 

A part of my brain was trying to recontextualize this into a romantic thing, but it really wasn’t that, and I didn’t want it to be. At least not right now. It was just… nice. It was nice having someone to talk to, who was easy to talk to, who made me laugh, and who I felt comfortable with. It was nice to feel genuinely connected to somebody after feeling disconnected for so long. It was nice to have a friend.

 

“Can I ask you something?” I inquired.

 

“Yeah.” She answered without hesitation.

 

“Why did you trust me, so early on?” I had this question for a while but I felt comfortable enough now to ask.

 

Jane paused for a moment before responding, “What makes you think I trusted you?”

 

I was a bit taken aback by her question. “Oh. Well, you were just so friendly and… open. I was just wondering… This is a seedy place and you don’t know me…”

 

She cut me off “I was friendly, yeah, but that’s… That’s how you have to be. That’s like ‘customer service voice’. I don’t want to anger the strange man living next to me, you know?”

 

That made a lot of sense, I didn’t think of it that way.

 

She continued, “But I trust you now.”

 

“Yeah?”

 

“Yeah. I think you’re a good guy. I think you probably won’t kill me… What about me, do you trust me?”

 

“I mean… I’m still not 100% convinced you exist to be honest. I’ve still never seen you. You didn’t answer your door when I tried to say hi so… You might just be a figment of my imagination. Who’s to say?” I joked, but a part of me thought that would actually explain things.

 

“Wait when was this?” She sounded surprised.

 

“Oh, after we put up the sound proofing. I was gonna say hi when I got home from work, but you didn’t answer.”

 

“Really? Damn. I didn’t hear you.” She responded, sounding legitimately disappointed.

 

“Well that’s a first.” I joked.

 

Jane chuckled, “I know, right?”

 

I sighed, “Alright I gotta try to get some sleep tonight. Last night was fucking awful.”

 

“Yeah? I slept like a baby last night, these soundproofing things rule.”

 

…She slept like a baby? The image in my head of her sitting up in her bed replayed and gave me chills once again. Clearly, I must be mistaken. I shook off the thought.

 

“Well I still need to get used to it… Goodnight Jane.”

 

“Hear you later, Leigh.” That corny son of a bitch. She was serious about doing those jokes every day, wasn’t she?

 

I heard her get up and make her way to bed. A few minutes later and her side fell quiet. I crawled into my bed and I once again stared into the dark. Sleep still wasn’t coming easy. I dreaded this, but this time it only took about an hour to fall asleep, of which I was grateful. The silence still unsettled me.

 

Suddenly I awoke, still in the darkness – even deeper now. I don’t know what woke me up, but when I checked the clock, it was 2 am. I wasn’t happy. I tried to fall back to sleep, and it was slowly working until… I heard it again. That same deep bed creak. That unmistakeable sound of someone sitting up. Now I was fully awake.

 

Minutes past and I heard nothing else. Same as before. Like she was just… sitting there. This time however, I just had to know. I was confused, concerned, and pretty creeped out. So I just leaned close to the wall and whispered:

 

“Jane?”

 

Nothing happened at first. But then I heard the bed very slowly begin to creak again. Agonizingly slow and subtle. It sounded like she was… turning. Or at least adjusting her position in some way. I heard what sounded like her hands touching the wall, splayed out far apart on either side of me and then… I heard her breathing.

 

I could only hear her breathe before when we were sitting back-to-back against the wall, so she must have been pressed right up against it. Her breathing sounded different this time, though. It sounded hollow, like she had a cold. I was petrified. The hair on the back of my neck was standing on end. What was she doing? Was she even awake? What must she look like right now?

 

I just stared at the wall. Imagining her on the other side, pressed up against it like some feral thing. Was this really happening? Am I just too tired and loopy to be able to tell? Maybe the creaking was her laying back down and she’s just breathing heavier than normal because she’s asleep. I wanted to rationalize this so badly.

 

I waited for something else to happen, some other sound… I waited hours… But nothing did, and I was too scared to say anything else. Was she still there? Was she pressed against the wall all night long? I tried to get a little bit of sleep. I managed maybe 45 minutes but it was not pleasant.

 

I couldn’t focus on work the next day. I was tired, and I was so creeped out by what happened. I couldn’t think of an explanation. But I knew there had to be one. There had to be something. I couldn’t get the image out of my head, and every time that image replayed, she looked a little bit less human. I pictured her smiling a grotesque toothy grin. I imagined her drooling, her eyes open as wide as saucers, her fingers long and bony caressing the wall. None of this was rooted in reality, I knew that, but I couldn’t help but think of it.

 

I got back home and this time I hesitated before doing my customary knocks on the wall, but I did, and she returned them - same as always.

 

“I was just thinking… Mankind has made a lot of great inventions.”

 

“Jane...”

 

“But the dry-erase board has to be the most remarkable.”

 

I laughed. I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to laugh at her jokes today, but I did. She’s still Jane. At least she seems to be. I was way overthinking.

 

“That one’s pretty good, I can’t lie.”

 

“You like it?” She asked, sounding proud of herself.

 

“I do... Hey I have to ask you something though.” I said, trying to remain at least somewhat casual.

 

“Shoot.”

 

“Do you… Sleepwalk?”

 

The other side went silent for a minute. “Um. No… Never in my life.” She responded, instantly sounding unnerved.

 

I fell silent too… I didn’t know how to explain. But she continued.

 

“That’s a scary ass question to ask out of nowhere. Did you hear something?”

 

“I heard… I don’t know exactly what I heard.”

 

“Stop. Don’t talk like that. Is this revenge for the corny jokes? I’ll stop the corny jokes. Don’t do this to me.” She pleaded in a half-joking manner.

 

“No, I promise I’m not messing with you - and it’s probably nothing. It’s just… You didn’t get up at all last night? Or the night before?”

 

“No, I did not get up at all. Please tell me what you heard.” She said firmly.

 

I told Jane everything that happened. I tried to be delicate, but also honest. I trusted that she didn’t know what was going on. That became evident to me by how freaked out she seemed. I know it sounded crazy, I just hope she didn’t think I was messing with her. It was difficult to tell from her tone.

 

Initially she wanted to debunk it all, saying that I must have heard something else – which I admitted could very well be true. Nevertheless, she told me she was going to stay with her sister for the night. Probably a good idea. She gave me her phone number and told me to call if anything happened. That put my mind at ease about whether or not she trusted me.

 

I told her to be safe, and she tried once again to reassure me that it was probably nothing, but I felt a sense of immense dread as soon as she left. Suddenly I really didn’t want to be alone here.

 

That night was the quietest of my life, and not in a good way. I thought about drowning it out by putting on some music or a movie, but nothing felt right.

 

I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to sleep that night, but eventually I managed. I ended up having a dream about a woman wearing a veil. through the veil I could vaguely make out three large black holes where her eyes and mouth should be. I couldn’t recall anything that happened in the dream… Only the image of that woman. I wondered if that was my subconscious way of trying to visualize Jane. I still didn’t know what she actually looked like so maybe my brain had trouble coming up with distinct features for her. Or maybe it was something else entirely.

 

It was still dark when I awoke from the dream. I felt a deep unease as I checked the time. 2 am, again. This time I wasn’t eager to fall back to sleep. I didn’t want to see the veiled woman again, so I stayed up a little while longer, attempting to ease my mind. I thought of every possible way to reassure myself. Eventually I began to fall into a façade of comfort, until…

 

Creak.

 

I went ice cold. No. This can’t be. I didn’t just hear that.

 

It was that same “sitting up” creak. But I heard Jane leave. Could she have come back late while I was sleeping? Maybe. But what if it isn’t her?

 

What if it was never her?

 

My mind raced. So many improbable scenarios played out in my mind. None of them were good. Was someone else in there with her the whole time and she didn’t know? Someone hiding away, only coming out when she’s sleeping? Was that creak her sitting up, or someone else sitting down? Do they watch her sleep?

 

All I knew for sure was that someone was on the other side of this wall. Because I could hear them breathing again.

 

I wanted to do something. I wanted to know for sure. But I was powerless. Calling out to it last time was the most horrific mistake of my life, I didn’t want to try that again. I wanted to call Jane but I was afraid of making a sound. Instead I just waited, and listened.

 

I was in a petrified daze. Hyperalert but also completely exhausted. My body wanted to shut down but my brain wouldn’t let me. It may have been minutes, or it may have been hours, I couldn’t tell. The image of the veiled woman kept reappearing in the back of my subconscious.

 

Eventually I decided to call Jane. If I heard a phone ring on the other side, then I would know. I typed the number in and hit call…

 

“The number you are trying to reach is not in service.” What? How could that be?

 

Suddenly, cutting through the silence was a sound I had become very familiar with, and yet was the one sound I was the least prepared for.

 

Knock Knock.
