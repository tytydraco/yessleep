So I know it’s been a while since my last upload. Truth is, what happened to Fred, what I did to Fred. It took a toll on me. I actually tried taking some time off from this god forsaken place, but my manager had other plans. Gotta be here for at least six months if I wanna use any PTO, or sick days, or personal days.

“Hotels always gotta have a body at the front desk.” She had told me.

What a load of bullshit. She should be the one to cover me since she’s the ‘Manager.’ The only thing she's managed since I got here was showing me the entryway.

Although it’s funny how much it feels like I’ve been working here a lot longer than the measly two months I have. Even though my checking account says otherwise. Maybe adjusting to this two week pay period would take a little longer than I had thought.

Not much has happened on the check in side of things. It’s been pretty dead as per usual, however I did find something you guys might enjoy reading.

A couple nights ago I decided to go rifling through the junk in the back office. I wasn’t looking for anything in particular, just trying to kill some time. I figured there would be at least one thing back there so I went looking in the old drawers and shelving.

I didn’t find much, save for dust bunnies and stale air. I continued to look until I finally opened a drawer with something inside of it. A small flash drive and a very old radio. I grabbed them thinking that they could give me a bit more entertainment than mindlessly doom scrolling like usually do.

I sat the radio down at the front desk and popped the flash drive inside my computer. It worked perfectly. A small file was on the computer screen labeled: Case Files of Dog Wood

Just reading the title of the file peaked that all too familiar feeling of curiosity inside me. I knew what lay inside would be a hell of a read right off the bat. So I clicked it to find three other files inside and a README.TXT file right at the top. Naturally I opened that one first. It read as follows:

Who I am does not matter. Who you are does not matter. How you got this flash drive does not matter. What does matter is the contents that lay within.

Within these files are various documents and pictures that I have gathered over the years. They are from many sources, most of which cannot be contacted through conventional means. Suffice to say I went through hell and back to get this information.

I have compiled these documents and pictures into case files of which you may read at your discretion. However, I must warn you. What is contained within these documents are mysteries you will never unsee. Once you have been exposed to them there is no going back. So I beg of you if your life isn’t already rather odd, just close this flash drive and put it back where you found it.

It ends there. I’m not gonna lie. I was a little taken aback by the ominous and rather serious tone of the author. However, that curiosity inside me flared up excitedly at the questions rushing through my mind.

Just what kind of cases were on this flash drive? Who was this mysterious author and why had he compiled his findings here? Why the hell was this in our back office?

So many questions and only one way to answer them. I closed the readme file and hovered my cursor over the first case file just below it. It was labeled: Grabe Road

Though I had yet to click open the files. Memories of the last time my curiosity had gotten the better of me circled inside my mind. Images of Fred, the blood, and his locket burned their way into my retinas as I looked at the file.

I wonder who I would hurt next if I opened these files and began to read. How would I take another life? Why was I so incessant on opening Pandora’s box yet again?

These were all questions to which I had no answer. Though, the need was still there. The need to peek behind the curtain. To see the clockworks and gaze upon the mystery. I just hoped it wouldn’t be as bad as last time.

I opened the file to find that it was composed of a rather large text file and a few jpegs. I opened the text file first and began to read a short preamble by our mysterious author. It reads as follows:

The following account and the pictures there after are not my own. They are of a lost resident of a small town in northern Indiana. These findings were given to me by a detective that resided in that town in the early 2010’s.

This detective had worked diligently on finding out more about the oddities of Grabe Road and about the town itself. Unfortunately, his other case files were either seized or lost. Even what I have compiled here is only a fraction of what actually lies within the origin case files. Those, like many others, are lost forever.

The preamble ends there and the actual story begins after. It reads as follows:

My name is Deacon Disantis and here lies between these pages are the first hand accounts of my son. These are the thoughts and actions he wrote down, before he went missing. I hope that in reading these pages someone would be able to decipher where he has gone. God help me, I miss him.

I first came to this town with my father, Deacon Disantis, about two months ago. He was a traveling photographer by trade and he had brought me along to continue my training under him.

We first arrived inside to take the photos of the inauguration of the town's mayor and the subsequent statement of the town proper. There was to be dance and drink and proper merriment. Along with the heavy compensation that came with our services.

We were even greeted with the would be mayor himself, Joseph Plinker. He ushered us off our stagecoach and personally showed us to our lodgings. After making sure they were to our liking he took my father about the town hall where the inauguration was to be held. To show him exactly where he wanted his picture to be taken. I was left to settle us in and make sure our equipment was ready for the event.

This took me all of an hour and I decided to go out and see what the town had to offer with my spare time. I made my way downstairs and into the hotel lobby where I saw a pretty looking girl working the front desk, I had noticed her upon our checking in.

“Hello, how are you doing this fine evening madam?” I said, as gentlemanly as I could.

“Just fine Mr. Disantis. How are y'all liking our fair town?” She said back with a smile.

“Well I was just going to find out. Got any ideas on what a fella like me might find interesting around here?” I asked.

“Well…” She put her finger to her lips and thought.

“You could try the local track down by the church. The boys down there like to race and make a fool of themselves doing it. Seems like you’d fit right in.” She laughed a bit as she said the last part.

“Well I hope that means you figure me a competent rider.” I said.

“About as competent as a three legged stool, and the ride just as comfortable.” She said.

“You should be so lucky to find out.” I shot back.

“Perhaps if you come back in good condition I’ll know you haven’t falling of your horse and I would concede you a competent man.”

“Competent enough for you to accompany me to the town assembly?” I asked.

“Perhaps.” She smiled.

I tipped my hat and turned away. Yet she called back to me.

“Nadine.” She said.

“Reed.” I answered back.

Upon leaving the hotel I could see that the town was at its most busy I think it had ever been. There were people in the streets setting up their wares for tomorrow evening's festivities. All wanting to look their best for the day their small town would finally be put on the map proper.

Not more than a few people recognized me from the stagecoach and new of my vocation. I was showered with request upon request to take photos of not only the shops, but of the families that owned them as well. It seemed the mayor wasn’t the only one who wanted to commemorate this day in history.

I took down their names and addresses as it were and told them we would be in town so long as the business kept up. Finally, I made my way off of the main street and ventured towards the church. I could hear the clanking of hooves and the shouts of young men the closer I got.

Once I crested the hill the events were in full sight and what a sight they were. There were at least 2 horses and 3 young men all in a bunch at the road in front of the church.

Two of the men, one with a hat and the other without, took up onto the saddle of their respective horses. They evened themselves up at the starting line, which was just a line drawn in the dirt, and after ensuring the men were even there was a three count and they were off.

Hooting and hollering accompanied by the steady beat of hooves to dirt as the men raced down the road. I made it to the group just as the man in the hat was coming back and slowing down. The man without the hat was far off behind him.

“Dang it, Vern! This horse is a bust! Why not put it outta it’s misery already!” The man without a hat shouted.

“Looks to me like the rider deserves the bullet. On account of you being a dolt!” The man wearing a hat shouted back, laughing.

The whole group shouted laughing and made fun of the man without a hat. He dismounted and gave the reins to another man with a beard.

“Oh no. It’s to the best of two. You’d better finish this one out.” The bearded man said.

“Gosh no! Ain’t you hear me? The damn animal don’t work right. I can’t finish with it.” The hatless man said.

“Then you forfeit the race and the pot you put into. Ain’t nothing wrong with that horse. You’re just cain’t ride!” The bearded man shot back.

“It’s busted! I tell ya the damn animals busted! You there. You’re that photographer from outta town aren’t ya?” The hatless man said, pointing to me.

“Yes sir, I am. Reed Disantis at your service.” I extended a hand to which he shook.

“I’m Melvin, this is Vern and Mack.” He pointed to the man wearing a hat and then to the bearded man respectively.

“Nice to make your acquaintance.” I said to the lot to which they returned the sentiment.

“Look here, can't you see this damn horse is broken?” Melvin said, bringing me in closer to inspect the animal.

“Aww, what the hell he know. He aint no rider. Just look at him.” Vern said, sizing me up and down.

“Well I really couldn’t tell unless I gave her a ride myself.” I said.

“Melvin you sneaky dog. If he saddles up on that horse its his race now. Would you let a stranger gamble with your own money?” Mack said.

“Aww what the hell. The damn things busted anyhow. Gone head and saddle up if you like Reed. Makes me no difference.” Melvin said waving his hands.

“Well it makes a difference to me. You wanna ride, you put into the pot. It’s a dollar to saddle up.” Mack said.

“Alright.” I said and took out a dollar bill and placed it into Mack’s hand.

He nodded to Melvin who gave me the reins. It was a bit funny getting up on such a big horse. The ones I rode back home were a bit smaller. I struggled a bit and the guys laughed as they watched me.

“Your moneys good as gone Melvin.” Vern said as he trotted up to the starting line.

I did the same although not as smooth as Vern did. We lined up at the starting line and I noticed Vern looking over at me. I returned his gaze to which he smiled, shook his head and spat on the ground. I only kept my head high and braced myself to start the race.

There was a three count and we were off. Now I wasn’t exactly the best rider around, but I wasn’t any slouched either. Though Vern did get the best of me from the start, I steadily gained speed after turning around and actually ended up passing him just before we made it past the finish line.

“Well I be damned!” Yelled Mack.

“Well I guess the horse wasn’t as busted as I thought!” Melvin shouted in excitement.

Vern only took his place at the starting line once again. Without a word I did the same. This would be the final race to win the pot. Vern looked over to me once again and I looked to him. This time he only nodded at me and I tipped my hat to him. Again Mack did the three count and again the sound of hooting and hollering and hooves on dirt filled the air.

Just like last time Vern shot out ahead of me, but this time I cought up to him before the turn. We were neck and neck on our way back when something peculiar happened. All of a sudden the light faded from the sky and it became dusk in an instant. As I rode on I was quickly overtaken by a fog so thick I could no longer see what was in front of me.

I looked back and could only just see the nose of Vern’s horse behind me. All of a sudden my horse got spooked and jumped high into the air. I just held on the best I could, but ended up falling off once we hit the ground. I opened my eyes and the sun was back just as it was before the race and Melvin was picking me up off the ground.

I looked at Melvin and his face was as white as a ghost. Mack was yelling to Vern frantically, but Vern just kept his eyes on me.

“W-what happened?” I asked.

“You disappeared Reed, completely. Vern was on his way gone too, till your horse fell outta the damn sky and you along with it.” Melvin said, still staring at me like I was a fish in a bowl.

“What? Can’t be.” I said.

“The hell was that Vern?! Where the hell did you guys go?!” Mack yelled.

“Don’t rightly know.” Vern said evenly.

“Well how’d the hell you almost disappear?” Mack asked.

“I don’t know.” Vern answered again.

“What the hell you mean you don’t know?!” Mack yelled again.

“Hop on Reed. Lets get that head looked at by the doc. Looks like it was a nasty spill you took.” Vern said.

I saddled up behind Vern and he began to trot back towards town. Mack and Melvin were left mouths still agape at what they had just witnessed. After a few minutes of riding Vern began to speak.

“I think it has something to do with speed.”

“What does?” I asked.

“Where we went. I think you gotta go fast to get there.”

“How’d you figure that?”

“Well you saw it didn’t you? The fog and the darkness.”

“Yeah, I did.”

“I see it every time I race on that particular road. Nowhere else. Except I’m the only one that does seem to see it. I think the others were just too damn slow, but you. You were even faster than me.”

“Why haven’t you told anyone then?” I asked.

“Who would believe me?”

“Yeah, I guess what we saw wasn’t exactly normal.”

“Where do you think we were going? In that fog I mean.”

“I don’t know. Not sure I want to find out either.”

“Hmmph.”

Vern dropped me off at the doctor's door without another word. He just nodded at me and rode on. I went in and got myself checked out. Thankfully, the fall wasn’t as serious as it had looked and I was given a few cigarettes for the stress and pain. I walked back to the hotel so transfixed on what had happened I plumb walked past Nadine at the front counter.

“Guess you weren’t such a good rider after all. On account of the dirt all over you.” She told me.

“Yeah, guess I was all talk this time around.” I said sheepishly.

“Well lucky for you we can walk to the town assembly. I’ll be ready by 5 tomorrow.” She smiled.

“It’s a date then.” I smiled back and walked back up to my room.

Father was already inside testing some of our equipment. He gave me a nod and asked about how I liked the town. I told him I had made a couple friends out by the church. Though I made no mention about the odd happenings there. I also told him I had a date with Nadine at the front desk.

He was proud of me for scaring up a date so quickly, but made sure I would have my eye on the ball and focus on my work when the time came for it. I assured him that I would and even gave him the ledger of businesses and families that requested our services. He was happy I was able to scare up more business. So much so he told me to have at the town for the rest of the night while he toiled away at our equipment.

I did end up deciding to help with the testing and things, before going off to bed. Honestly, I had enough of what this place had to offer for one night. I soon drifted off to sleep.

I was awakened by a cool breeze and the rustling of leaves in the wind. I opened my eyes and found myself in a sort of a clearing while it was still dark. I looked around for a bit, confused. Had my father played me for a fool and swept me up here in the night. That wasn’t really something he’d do, but I couldn’t find any other explanation.

I got up and took stock of my surroundings. There were trees all around me and I had no idea where the path to town may have been. So I decided to walk in the direction of where the trees parted slightly and grew less thick.

The darkness was oppressive as I traveled and I began to worry I wouldn’t be able to find my way back. A crackle of trees off in the distance heightened my awareness and I stood still in order to catch the sound on the wind again. Sure enough after a few moments I heard the sound once more.

Hearing it gave me pause for a reason I didn’t understand. There was something about that sound that made my hair stand on end. It sounded like someone was stepping on branches or maybe it was a group of people doing it.

Again I stood still, trying for the sound to touch my ears once more. Again I heard the crunching, it was coming closer now. Then clear as day I heard hard footsteps coming in my direction. It was no mistake that these belonged to a man and he was coming up on me fast.

I waited in silence for whoever it was to run into me or past me. It was amazing I didn’t hear the man slam into trees as he approached. I saw the man come up in front of me and snatched at him as he tried to run by. Immediatly he turned and pulled a knife on me. Our eyes met in recognition, it was Vern.

“What the hell are you doing here?” He asked.

“I-I’m not sure.” I said.

I could hear the crunches getting closer as we talked. Vern looked off in the direction of the sound and a look of worry and fear flashed onto his face.

“We gotta go now.” He said.

He didn’t give me a chance to get a word in as he sprinted off back into the direction he was originally headed in. I took off after him. However faster I was than him on a horse, Vern more than made up for on foot. It was a struggle to keep up with him as he weaved in and out of the trees and bushes.

I could hear that same crunching sound getting closer still as we ran. It felt like whatever was making that sound was gaining on me, nipping at my heels. Slower and slower I became as I ran. I was quickly running out of steam and I could barely see Vern anymore. The crunching sound was so loud at my back I thought I might be swallowed up whole by it.

My lungs burned and my legs quaked as I ran. Until finally, I was at my limit. I took what I thought was my last step before the thing chasing us caught me. Only to crash into Vern’s back making us both fall to the ground.

“What are you doing man? That things still behind us.”

“Nah, we’re good.” Vern said, getting back to his feet.

“I almost thought you didn’t make it.” Vern said.

“Where the hell are we and what the hell was that?” I asked.

“I don’t know and never want to find out what the hell that thing was. As for where we are. This don’t look any familiar to you Reed?” Vern asked.

I looked around and saw the church to our left. I could even make out the hoof marks of where we were racing and the start line too.

“How the hell did I get here?” I asked.

“I don’t know. This happens to me every night since I’ve been seeing that fog here while I rode. Every night I have to run. Every night I am chased by god knows what.” Vern spat on the ground.

I could see the fog slowly creeping in from the front of us as we spoke. The coolness in the air almost froze as the fog slowly cascaded over our shoes and began rising.

“Does that mean I will too?”

“Probably.” Vern said.

“How can we stop it then?”

“I think we have to go back down this road. It’s calling to me, I’m sure of it. Now it’s calling to you too.”

“I don’t want anything to do with this. I’ll leave this town and this road along with it.”

“Tried that. I still have to run every night. Still I am chased no matter how far away I get from this town. I’m getting tired, Reed. Every time I wake up here I run a little slower and I get tired a little quicker. I’m worried I won’t be able to outrun it one of these days and I don’t wanna know what will happen when whatever that is catches up to me.”

The way Vern spoke was so matter of fact you’d think he was talking about something simple as a game of baseball. Though, under his coolness I could hear the fear that dwelled within him. Because it was the same fear that I felt. The fog was just about at our chest now.

“We can go back tomorrow night, after the town assembly. I’ll meet you here and we can go and take a ride.” I said.

Vern only looked at me and nodded as the fog consumed us both. Then I awoke back in my bed with sweat pooled all around me.

Had that all just been a dream? Perhaps that fall I had was a bit more severe than I had initially thought. I wasn’t sure or more precisely I didn’t want to believe what I had just experienced was real. I laid back into my bed and tried to forget the contents of what just had transpired out of my head. I was unsuccessful.

Though I eventually fell back asleep because I was awakened by the jabbering of my father. He instructed me to get our equipment ready for the day of work ahead of us.

When we headed out the town was even more active than the day prior. We squeezed through to the town hall and took our pictures as instructed. After that we pretty much photographed everyone in the entire town. So many people wanted a photo taken. We made a mint that day and most likely would so for the following days we were in town, if the business kept up.

Finally, came the town assembly in which my father gave me the rest of the day off for my date with Nadine. I wore my best suit and came to the front desk where she stood waiting for me. She wore a very pretty blue gown and a veil that was a softer blue.

We drank and danced and had a grand time throughout the night. It was really a wonderful time. After the assembly was over I walked Nadine home and we scheduled another date for tomorrow. She planted a small kiss on my cheek before I left.

I had such a good time that I completely forgot about Vern and the road and that whole business. I had written it off as a dream and that was it. That is until I saw a lit lantern down by the church. Instantly I knew it was Vern waiting for me.

I looked at the hotel door. Inside was a warm bed and my father, most likely already fast asleep. There wasn’t any creature chasing me or fog or any odd roads that I needed to travel.

Then I looked down by the church. The lantern that illuminated that eerie road and Vern, who I couldn’t tell from this distance, but I could feel his eyes on me. Watching and waiting.

I looked further on out past the lantern's light and into a black infinity. Vern was right. That damn road was calling to me and I knew I had to answer.

So I leave these pages for you, father. In hopes that my trek into the unknown will be a safe one and my return home swift. If by any chance I do not return. I don’t want you to come looking for me. Please. Don’t.

I love you father.

It ends there. Followed by a few pictures taken seemingly on the day that this all happened.

There were a few of the various stalls and shops in the town. Followed by a couple of what I can only assume were Reed and his father. They looked happy. Finally, the last picture was of the town assembly. Many people stood under a huge banner with what I assume was the town’s name on it.

I’m not sure what to make of this story. I’m honestly left with more questions than answers. Maybe I could travel to this town one day and find out for myself. Maybe this is as far as my curiosity should go. Either way the suns just about up and it’s about time for me to clock out. I'll keep you guys updated on the next case file and anything new that pops up in the hotel.
