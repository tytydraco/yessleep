I was getting home from school the same time I always did. Ten til four. The school bus groaned behind me as it resumed its route. My arrival was greeted by our immaculate lawn and award winning garden. Nothing was out of place that day. Just like my family. Everything was always so neatly organized and catalogued. My dad was an accountant; my mother a librarian. And I was the athlete. 

Our home life was the definition of mundane. The unpredictable was accounted for, and mitigated by an optimal and efficient lifestyle. Bermuda grass, cut exactly to two-inches in height. Shoes off at the door. House shoes were mandatory. We even had several guest pairs that were regularly disinfected. Dinner by six o’clock sharp. Floss and brush after dinner. In bed by 11 p.m. on weekdays, and 12 a.m. on the weekends. Brush and mouthwash in the morning, and breakfast at 7.  

Thankfully my parents allowed me some agency in how my room operated. They accurately assessed that I was simply a hormonal juvenile male, so I was properly allotted a space where I could indulge in customary youthful pastimes. What I’m trying to say is, I was allowed to eat Doritos while I played Super Nintendo in my room. Of course, I would have to clean up regularly though, or “no baseball”. Sports were also considered an indulgence, but my parents still allowed me to participate. 

They understood the value that sports played in social development, as well as health maintenance. However, any notions of making it a career were severely discouraged. Attending my baseball games was simply a formality. Their presence signified they supported me, even if they had no interest in whether I hit the ball or not. They didn’t root or cheer; they waved and then got distracted watching anything other than me. But before you start to feel sorry for me, don’t. It didn’t bother me. My parents were weird quiet nerds that had more in common with automatons than Homo sapiens.

They cared in their own way, I suppose. At least my mom did, I think. She showed the most potential for being human. Perhaps that was her downfall.

I threw open the front door and was assaulted by an array of aromas. There was onion, and maybe garlic. Very typical. The canned peas were obvious, and whether you loved them or hated them, they were very distinct. There was also a bit of a smokey or slightly burnt-meat smell. Beef perhaps. Or maybe pork. But underneath it all, was a very bizarre odor. It was pungent, but it was hard to identify. The other smells masked it so perfectly, I almost thought I imagined it. It was like a phantom.

“Shoes off,” a voice called from the kitchen.

I was surprised to hear my father giving me the command. He wasn’t normally home on a Monday until 5:15. 

“Dad? What are you doing home so early?”

“I left early to make dinner,” he said, rounding the corner. He looked bizarre. He was always a bit detached, but now it was in an unhinged sort of way. His tie was loosened. One side of his collar stood up like alfalfa. And his usually well-groomed hair now hung down in his face, which was slick with perspiration. He wore a stained apron over his work suit, and his feet were bare.   

“It’s not even four yet, Dad?”

He stood there for a moment, almost like I hadn’t said anything at all. Then he sprang to life. 

“You’re absolutely right, but I wanted to do something special for you.”

“For me? Why?

He turned around heading back to the kitchen without saying a word. I followed him. He had the table set and ready to go. But it was only set for two. He just stood there staring at me blankly, almost like he was expecting something.  

“Alright, well I’m gonna work on some homework til mom gets home,” I said, slinging my bookbag back over my shoulder.

“Dinner is ready now.”

I turned back to look at him. He stared at me with such a serious intensity. I had never seen him like this before. But he was still calm. Unnervingly so. He hadn’t raised his voice, and there was no hint of anger on his face.

“Ok,” I said coolly, as I dropped my bag back to the ground.

I took a seat, and after a few seconds he sat in the chair across from me.

“Where’s mom?”

“She’s late,” he said, with such venom I couldn’t believe my ears. My parents rarely fought and when they did, it was so tame it was almost boring. The shock left me in silence. I then began to notice the food laid out before me. A big bowl of clumpy instant mashed potatoes, crested by a cold unmelted stick of butter. The peas were overcooked; dried out and shriveled up. But that was nothing compared to the main course. Several serving plates hosted many different varieties of mystery meats. Some of it was burnt while other bits were very rare. Bloody. None of the viscera looked appetizing, and compared to normal cuisine, it looked downright alien.

“What…what is this?

“Freshly butchered meat. Grass fed. None of that ultra-processed junk.”

He began loading up his plate with all sorts of different pieces of flesh and organs. He didn’t seem to be interested in the peas and mashed potatoes. I nearly threw up when I saw him drown his plate in a dark viscous fluid he called “gravy”.

“Dad…seriously, what is going on?”

He dropped his fork and knife instantly in annoyance. He looked down at his plate, and inhaled deeply. 

“Your mother is leaving us.”

I was stunned. I hadn’t seen this coming at all. I wouldn’t say my parents were in love, but they were pretty much two sides of the same coin. Their awkward and robotic behaviors functioned instep with one another, like they were coded to be together. 

“Really? You guys never fight. So, you’re getting a divorce then? Just like that?”

He picked his head up. Eyes closed, he rolled his head back and forth, shoulder to shoulder.

“We’re…figuring it out at the moment.” 

“This is—I wanna talk to her. Don’t I get a say in any of this?”

“She’s gone, Billy. She’s never coming back.”

Silence enveloped us. The kitchen clock ticked loudly and irreverently in the background. Each tick thundered maddeningly, as the seconds dragged on for what felt like an eternity.

My father grabbed up a handful of—what I assumed to be—sausages and tore into them like a rabid beast that hadn’t eaten in days. They popped and crunched as he chewed loudly, only stopping to spit out a few tiny bones here and there. I struggled to summon the fortitude necessary to keep my lunch from coming back up. Then—suddenly—there was a knock at the door. Knock-knock-knock. 

The carnivorous creature in front of me froze; juices from the meat running from the corners of his mouth and collecting on his chin. Drip-drop—knock-knock-knock. The banging on the door came again, but louder and with more vigor.

He stood straight up with a singular-fluid motion. His countenance vacant and his head locked onto the source of the disturbance. He moved purposefully towards his prey, as if nothing else existed. I sat quietly as I heard the hinges of the front door squeak, and strained my ears to hear who these interlopers might be.

I failed, and after a quick exchange of quiet garbled words, I heard the door close with force. My father returned immediately, and without a word. He continued where he left off.

“Who was it?”

He stopped chewing to spit out a bone, and behind gritted teeth he said, “Christians.”

My parents were both staunch atheists, and big fans of Richard Dawkins. However, they didn’t mind that I went to church with my friends. “Boys will be boys,” they would say dismissively. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not the most pious individual, but atheism—like my parents—just seemed so insipidly boring to me. At least my church youth group would take me to play laser tag.

“What did they want?”

“What?” he asked in agitation. His eyes shot up at me in quick anger. 

“Well, what did they want with us?”

He ignored me and went right back to stuffing his gullet. He stopped to chug a glass of cold milk, leaving greasy fingerprints all over the glass. He exhaled, thirst satisfactorily quenched. 

“A growing boy needs to eat his meat. Clean your plate or no baseball. Ever.”

I had reached my limit. This entire interaction had journeyed beyond the pale.

Knock-knock-knock.

Fists slammed hard against the wooden table—the impact rattling the glassware—and the chair shot out from under my father as he stood back up.

“Wait here,” he said icily. 

I heard my father open the door abruptly as he began to raise his voice, but it was cut off as the door slammed behind him. There it was again. That odor. Perhaps the door opening had created a draft which once again revealed that putrid and unmistakable odor. I rose to investigate it.

I exited the kitchen and began sniffing profusely; alternating between deep inhales and quick successions of whiffs. I followed my nose down the hall and to my parents’ room. I stopped outside the closed door and hesitated. My parents never had any rules about not going in their room. Its natural repellent originated from the boring nature of those who inhabited it. I was never compelled to explore it. And therefore, the door was always open—until now.

Without my consent, my hand began twisting the doorknob. I could feel my heartbeat in my ears. Pounding away. My stomach—which had already been through enough that day—roiled in nervous agony. The door gently retreated back into the room. I was not prepared for the smell that infiltrated my nose and pervaded all throughout my body. The gagging began reflexively. But lo, the final death blow had yet to be delivered. Until, I beheld the gaze of my dead mother’s head.

The pallid-waxy head rested upon a silver platter. It was offset by blood red candles. The eyes had been violently gouged out leaving score marks around the sockets. Her mouth hung open in a haunting expression. And upon her tongue sat two bloody eyeballs.

The thick chunky fluid, shot out of my mouth like a projectile. The carpet attempted to drink the sick, but it had already been engorged by blood. The red drink trailed off and then took shape into some sort of pentagram beneath the disembodied head. I say pentagram, but that is only because that is as close a description as I can come to. It was like a pentagram, but more intricate. Interwoven with other smaller symbols and runes. 

An arm shot out from behind me and slammed the door in front of me. I turned to face my father; our eyes only inches apart. Fresh blood trickled from his mouth.  

“Mother is resting!” he yelled into my face.

I ran as fast as I could to my room and slammed the door behind me. Heart still racing, I collapsed against the door, trying to formulate my next move. However, my mind was shattered into a million pieces and I failed to conjure the strength to rise from the heap I had made myself into.

I heard the coat closet slide open. I perked up and listened intently; holding my breath. The sound of bare feet slapping against the hardwood floor grew louder, and then were muffled by the berber of the hallway.

“Billy, why don’t you come out here and have a chat with Dad. Please, son?” he said calmly as ever, right outside my door.

I tried to reply but my voice failed me. Nothing came out. I’ve never felt so helpless in my life. The closest phenomenon I can relate it to is sleep paralysis. But there was no “dream demon”. Only the demon I had formally known as “dad”. 

“How about a game of catch with your old man?

My heart raced painfully in my chest, and my breathing was irregular. I think I may have been having a panic attack. 

“Maybe we can practice with the bat”

SMASH!

The force of the bat against the wooden door reverberated throughout my body. Splinters of wood rained down upon my head. 

I forced a desperate and hoarse scream from my lungs, “Help!” My voice cracked and it felt like I shredded my vocal cords. But it was barely audible. 

The bat hammered away at the door, increasing in speed all the time. Until a hand was pulling me by the hair. This is the end. *Oh dear God, please. I don’t want to die.* 

Just then—sirens echoed faintly in the distance. The hand that was in the process of scalping me went still. Then it vanished. I heard the sound of the garage door opening followed by the screeching of tires—peeling out of the driveway.

The sirens grew louder and louder until I heard them right outside. Then they stopped. I took a deep breath, got up, and ran to safety. In my mind I had imagined it was the police. However, it was an ambulance. The police were about ten minutes behind. 

It turns out the “Christians” at the door were a couple of Jehovah's Witnesses. The first time they had knocked they were doing their usual routine. My father had impassively rejected their attempt at conversation, and they had started to walk away when one of the men was overcome by an inexplicable thirst. However, the nearest vending machine—across the street—only accepted quarters. The man really wanted an ice cold Coke, but he only had cash. He turned back to see if my father might break a bill for him. That was a huge mistake—that ended up saving my life.

He knocked on the door again, and out came my father instantly hostile. The man had apologized and quickly tried to explain the situation—hoping to deescalate things. Well, that went tits-up as my father angrily screamed incoherently, then lunged at him. They rolled around on the ground for a few seconds, and the other man tried to intervene. When he attempted to pull my father off his friend, my dad—using his teeth—clamped down on the initial man’s nose and tore it off.

The other man cried out in shock and ran to get help from a neighbor. They called 911, and the first responders arrived on the scene shortly after. When the police got there, they had thought it was just a simple altercation that went nightmarishly wrong. Until they saw me standing outside the house, covered in wood splinters and vomit. Hair ripped to hell, and looking hysterical.

I ended up living with my grandparents after that. I was given a choice to either stay in school with my friends or transfer to a different school where no one knew who I was or what my father did. I ultimately chose my friends. I rather people whisper about me than not have any type of friend group or support. And as horrific as things had been that day, they actually got better. I’ve lived a fairly happy and healthy life since then. My grandparents are great people, and they’ve done everything they can for me. But he’s still out there. I think about it a lot. Especially when things are going really well, the thought will drift back into my mind—*where is he?*

Does he think of me? Is he even alive? Sometimes I wish he would come and find me. Not for revenge, or some sense of justice for my poor mother. But because I want to know why? Why did he do this to us? What was with the ritualistic crap in the bedroom. He’s not even religious. Or he wasn’t. Or maybe it's not really about religion. I don’t know. But the burning question of “why” has led me to chase the white rabbit down through the occult rabbithole.

I’ve been chasing shadows for a while, but I think I have finally found a cult that can help me. They claim to be Satanists or some type of demon worshippers. I’ve been assured they can help me to understand the ritual I saw being performed that day. They are actually very intrigued to meet me from the sounds of it. Tonight is my initiation ritual, although it's more like an infiltration. My pursuits are purely academic, I assure you. I just want answers. Wish me luck.
