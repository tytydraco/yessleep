Im a really introverted person so I mostly talk with people through text or to the ones I'm close with, so I wouldn't go outside and socialize a lot, but that didn't bother me one bit, even though my neighborhood was full of birds chirping, animal sounds, kids laughing while playing around and adults making conversations.

 I just wanted to enjoy myself with a hot cup of tea. As I was turning the oven on, I hear a loud sound that could make you rip your ears apart. I quickly look at my phone and see the next message

"ALERT, THIS IS NOT A DRILL! 

Lock yourselves inside of your homes and seek immediate shelter. Make sure you have enough food for a few days and wait for more updates"

I was confused and slightly annoyed since I get these all the time, for example a few months ago I got an alert saying there might be a murder in our area but shortly found out he wasn't even in our town and got the locations mixed up.

I tried to call my mother but she didn't respond. I started calling my dad, no sign.  I spammed their phones, their last online:  3 hours ago. Not to mention they lived like 90 km away from me. 

"I'm sure they're just busy"

I thought to myself, but couldn't help having fear. I closed the blinds and locked the front and back door, which were really strong since they were made of a really thick special type of wood. I just remembered the water burning on the oven, I rushed there and poured it in my cup making my tea. Not even a few sips in and my phone is ringing, it was my co-worker and distant friend, Dave. 

D: "Hey, Andrew. Did you get the alert too?"
A: "Yeah, why are you asking?"
D: "Because I got it too, and all my other co-workers and friends aren't answering"
A: "That's weird, my family isn't answering too"
D: "I'm sure it's just a drill. Don't worry too much, maybe they're busy? "
A: "Yeah, you're right. Hey, I have to go, I need to do something."
D: "Okay man, see you later"

I hung up. 

I listened carefully outside, not a single step, voice, cracking leaf, dog bark, bird, nothing, even when there used to be an alert they would mostly ignore it and go on with their day. I tried to convince myself it will be okay and I went to my bedroom. 

The day went as slow as a snail. I mostly stared at my ceiling, even with my phone, I couldn't keep myself entertained since no one could talk to me from "mysterious circumstances"
. 
I turned on the TV, thinking that could make me escape the long boredom I was trapped in. 

As I turned the TV on, the same ear ripping sound happened, but this time the message was on the TV screen

"ALERT, THIS IS NOT A DRILL! 

Lock yourselves inside of your homes and seek immediate shelter. Make sure you have enough food for a few days and wait for more updates"

I turned from bored to scared in a second. Whenever the apart would happen, it would never appear on my TV, so I knew something was wrong. I wanted to sleep it out and hope everything would get better, the problem is that I couldn't do it, the anxiety that something could happen kept me up for hours.

I decided to open the blinds for a bit, I really needed some sun and it was pretty early anyway. I opened them and the sun slapped me in the face, it felt really nice that I felt warm...for a second. When I looked at my neighbors house, Tom, my stomach turned upside down. 

There were around 10 mysterious creatures outside his house, forming a circle around it. When you started observing them more you could observe their disgusting and scary features of these monsters. They were tall, skinny and looked like they were skinned or ripped alive but at the same time they were dark like a shadow. You could see their bones because of how skinny they were. They had horns and horse feet and really long animal claws with that could easily rip someone to pieces in a second. What scared me the most was their eyes. Their skinless body or bloody animal nails didn't scare me as much as their pitch black orbits that looked like they were pushed inside their head by someone. They looked like they wanted to get out of their disgusting goat head but couldn't. It was so distressing and sickening I wanted to throw my insides up. 

I swear I froze for a few seconds. I closed the blinds before they would get a chance to see me, if they had that ability. Millions of scenarios went through my head by a minute. I couldn't move, I was too scared thinking that I was watched or one of those creatures were inside my house. I couldn't go insane, I haven't talked to anyone for 7 hours, no way I was hallucinating. 

I wanted to stop over thinking but I couldn't. Not even Dave could respond to my calls or messages and he was the last one who called me. I started walking around my house, creating more scenarios of what could happen. I think I did this for around 25 minutes. I started biting my nails till they started bleeding out cause of the stress. 

The suspense was eating me from the inside, I had to check if they were there again, I had to check if my mind made it up. I slowly walked up to my room and looked through the blinds. Apparently, nothing was there, but the door was bust open and had scratches. The front windows were broken. I made sure it was a figment of my imagination.. I shouldn't have checked a second time.. 

As I started rising my view for a second, to Tom's second floor window, I saw 2 big black orbits staring Into my soul with a wicked smile that was salivating like fucking dog. At that moment I realised they could see, they could see more than us. I couldn't look back, it was like it made me stare, like it wanted to steal my soul and mind. It was one of the creatures that was in front of the house. We kept staring at eachother for a few seconds until he turned around and ran away. My heart started pumping as I realized that it was coming to my house. 

I pulled the blinds back and rushed to the kitchen. I started hearing screeching and scratching on my door and windows. 

I started crying while I quickly put water into four 1 liter bottles and packed as much food as I could. I don't care if it was cold or hit it's expiring date, anything was fine at that point in time. Adrenaline rushed through my body and I wanted to scream for help, even if I knew no one would respond.

I started sweating and take fast breaths. I thought I would die that day, until... I remembered the day my father took me a shot gun for self protection when I was sixteen years old because I was home alone a lot. I took the box from the drawer and opened it, I never shot a gun or don't really know the name and type of them, I didn't even know how to load it bit I figured it out in the tenstion of the moment. I was lucky I found some munition next to the fire arm.

I took a kitchen knife just in case, because it made me feel safe, even though I knew that it couldn't help me since I would get tortured and my faith would be worse than death if I tried to use it. It.. Was there just in case.. 

I strapped the shot gun around me and took the big bags full of water and food from the kitchen. I made up a plan, I would stay inside my attic for a few days until I hear no more sounds and wait for more updates from the government. I didn't try to be quiet since I knew they were already looking for me. 

I did not look back and sprinted to the last floor of my house. I hear a loud bang behind me...

The creatures got inside my house. The worst was about to happen to me mentally.
