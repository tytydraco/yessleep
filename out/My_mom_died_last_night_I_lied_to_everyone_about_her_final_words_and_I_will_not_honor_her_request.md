“TAMMY? SHOUT IF YOU CAN HEAR ME! TAMMY!” Tim’s cries came blasting through the tent, harsher than an alarm clock.

I glanced at my phone. 6:10 AM. Typical. And on the *one* night I’d found a soft patch of dirt…

Still, it wasn’t all bad—maybe if I moved fast enough, there’d be time for a cheeky cigarette before Mom woke up? That way, we could skip the morning lecture.

I pulled on my gear and crawled outside.

“Everything okay Tim?” I asked when the big guy circled back toward the campsite.

“Have you seen Tammy?”

Waist-high foliage surrounding our encampment, an easy place to lose yourself. “Afraid not.”

“Shit.”

As he belted out a mega ‘TAMMMMMMMMMMMMYYYYYYYYYY’, birds in the surrounding trees took flight.

On the far side of the campfire’s charred remains, Ulrich’s head poked out of a fancy tent. “Tim my friend, what seems to be the issue?”

When he learned Tim’s better half was MIA, Ulrich said, “One moment, let me get ready.”

Our tour guide was my age, mid-twenties or thereabouts, and born in Berlin, although he’d lived on five continents before he was nine, which meant he had a half-dozen accents bled into one.

With an unlit cigarette between my lips, I hesitated. The previous night, Mom and I’s latest argument about my ‘filthy habit’ reached the point where we both spat raw sulphur, and her teary-eyed speech had been gnawing at me ever since. *One of these days* *those cancer sticks are gonna kill you, Darren. Then what am I supposed to do?*

Honestly, she made a good point. It’s not like I wanted to go out the same way Dad did, rasping into an oxygen mask.

I pocketed my lighter and ruffled the tent beside mine.

“What?”

“I’m making breakfast. Ask Mom if she wants a cup of tea.”

“Mom’s not here.”

Already my gut knew something was off. “Liz, what do you mean *she's not there*?”

“I mean she’s not here,” my sister said, carefully enunciating each word. Why’d she need to be such a brat all the time?

“Where is she then?”

“I dunno. You just woke me up.”

I approached Tim and Ulrich, who’d slid into a fiery debate. “Looks like my mom’s disappeared too.”

Ulrich muttered some German words I suspected might get you kicked out of church. “Before we jump to conclusions, lets give them a minute. Perhaps they just excused themselves to the bathroom.”

Yeah, that sounded about right. Roosters suffering from sleep disorders didn’t get up as early as those two. Any second now they’d shuffle along swapping tips about how they kept squirrels from digging up their potted plants.

As I ate a bowl of Cornflakes on a foldable chair beside the campfire, another member of our posse, Nancy, emerged from her tent.

“Have you seen Tammy?” Tim asked before she’d even finished stretching out.

“Morning to you too, hon.”

“She and Angela are missing. Any idea where they might have went?”

Nancy contemplated this. “Last night they were talking about how nice the sunrise would look from the top of that hill.” She pointed at a rocky mound out East, barely visible beyond the choking canopy. “Maybe they went for a picture?”

Tim swore.

Nancy—or Nance to her friends—was an American with long, black hair. Her phone background was a picture of her drinking champagne with her daughter at Everest basecamp, which they climbed to celebrate Nance’s fiftieth birthday. She attributed her incredible physical conditioning to decades of yoga and herbal tea.

Liz was the last to rouse herself from the dead. As usual.

“That’s it,” Tim said after everybody ate. “Enough faffing about, I’m gonna go find Tam.”

Ulrich said, “That is not such a good move, you might *also* get lost. I need you to leave the searching to me, otherwise—"

“What, are you gonna stop me?”

Tim, who stood a full head taller than everybody else, squared up to Ulrich. He was an ex-heavyweight boxer—even held a regional British title in the 90s—with a talent for pushing people’s buttons, and I knew if those two set off on an expedition, just them, tempers would soon flare.

I stepped between them and said, “I’ll come too.”

Ulrich nodded his reluctant approval. “Nancy, Liz, you wait here while—”

“Like hell,” Nancy cut in. “I've got eyes like a hawk. If the gals are out there, I’ll spot ‘em.”

“No. Somebody needs to remain in case they get close enough to call for help.”

“Why not go meditate,” Tim grumbled. “See if you can manifest the ladies finding their way back.”

Nancy forced a dry chuckle. “Say that again, Tim, and I’ll manifest sticking my foot so far up your ass you’ll be able to chew gum and give me a pedicure at the same time.”

Only after a brief debate did she agree to stay put, under protest.

Flinging my pack across my shoulders, I said to Liz, “We’ll be back soon. Don’t wander off. Understand?”

Cue the patented eyeroll. “Whatever.”

I bit down on a stern lecture. My sixteen-year-old sister had been trapped in a perpetual state of hormonal angst ever since she discovered the great outdoors didn’t come with complimentary Wi-fi. By the way she reacted to not having Instagram or TikTok, you’d think it was some creative method of new-age torture.

Liz had blonde hair and bright blue eyes. In the old days, adults stopped our mother on the street so they could fawn over little Lizzie while I stood off to the side, bored, jealous. Then afterwards, I’d sulk until Mom cheered me up by digging around inside her bag and finding a ‘surprise’ packet of Haribo for me.

Us three musketeers set off wading through ivy, nettles, and a sea of leaves. Ulrich led the charge cutting a trail with a large knife followed closely by Tim, who called out every fifth step or so. Even if the forest ambiance drowned out any cries for help, I hoped the red raincoat I bought Mom for Christmas would be easy to spot from afar.

The fresh earth tasted heavy on the cold air. Now and again, our chaperone crouched low, studied the uneven ground, and then explained what he’d found: trampled grass, misplaced nettles. These tracks tapered off as we marched deeper into the wooden maze, heads cocked forward.

A horrible image kept sliding into my brain: Mom laying face up under hairy ferns, her nostrils and eye sockets crawling with fat, juicy centipedes.

On the far side of a long mound, it almost sounded like a murmur issued from deep within the thick woods. I stopped, listened closely. As I squinted past the interlocking limbs of half-rotted trees, a woman’s voice dwindled and died. Was there a tiny red blob past all the unbroken green foliage? It could have been Mom. Could have been.

If so, she was standing statue-still. Watching. Waiting.

“MOM?” I shouted. The distant figure vanished amidst a shuffle of leaves.

My companions spun around, then, after I explained what I’d seen, agreed we should search the area.

A sweep of the region turned up three withered logs and a dead rat, picked clean by predators.

Unable to mask his irritation, Ulrich said, “Surely a trick of the shadows. Let’s keep moving.”

The disorientating forest pushed back against up intruders the whole way to the mound. Low, jagged spears kept threatening to gouge my throat, and we needed to take extra care not to get our feet tangled in roots, because you couldn’t see your own feet beneath the scratching bracken.

It wouldn’t have been possible to climb the long, grey rock in a straight line, so we zigzagged toward the summit where gnats hovered around our skulls, no doubt attracted by the sour sweat.

“Should we be panicking now?” Tim asked the outdoorsman in a snide tone.

“Not yet.” He grabbed a map from his pack, unfolded it.

Around Tim’s neck, a wedding ring hung from a chain. He fidgeted with it while, rather than smoke, I kept my hands busy by flicking my zippo lighter open and shut.

To the south hills rose above the canopy, grey-purple mountains beyond them. Funny how such a picturesque place could usher in such dread. By now, so far as the itinerary was concerned, we should have been en-route to the final leg of our journey—a log cabin at the foot of that mountainside.

Although I didn’t hear it, there must have heard a noise, because suddenly Tim said, “Tammy?”

He charged down the mound in a straight line, half-running half-falling.

“Shit, quick,” Ulrich said, as he folded the map into his pack.

The gauntlet of sweeping branches passed in a blur as we raced after Tim, who ignored our increasingly frustrated calls. He barrelled through a scattering of thornbushes, pushed back a jutting branch, and then got swallowed whole by the ferocious undergrowth.

A huge crash shot up just as Ulrich and I ducked under the bough, me first.

My booted foot almost plummeted straight into a narrow pit, roughly nine feet deep. I reeled away at the last second, my arms windmilling around in a futile attempt at staying upright, until a hand clamped tight around my chest.

The German reeled me to safety and held on until I steadied myself. “Thanks,” I rasped, still struggling for air. Damn cigarettes…

Tim was at the bottom of the gulch, his face streaked with soil and twigs and dead leaves. By some miracle he hadn’t broken any bones.

Ulrich said, “Tim my friend, remember what I said about sticking together?”

“Save it. I heard Tammy. C’mon we’re burning daylight, get me out of this fucking ditch.”

“Just one second, we’ll find a log to haul you out.”

Once we stepped outside earshot, Ulrich said to me, “Darren, I’m going to need your help. This is no longer a matter of salvaging the tour, but one of safety. Theres no more tracks, and we’ve already lost an entire morning. Now I’m going to do everything I can to find the ladies, but it’s better if I do it myself. If they don’t turn up by nightfall, we need to find a station and call for help, but I’m expecting Tim might object. Do you understand what I’m saying?”

Leave Mom out there, alone? She might have died of hypothermia. Or exposure. It would take a lifetime of spa weekends to make up for this betrayal.

From my anxious expression, Ulrich could no doubt tell this decision had me all torn up inside. “I know you must feel bad abandoning her, but it may be the best chance they have.”

“…Okay,” I said.

Using a branch thicker than an amputated forearm, we hauled Tim out of the hole with some difficulty.

“Let’s return to camp. Maybe Tammy and Angela are already there.”

“Fuck that,” Tim snapped. “I heard Tam.”

He shouted down all the way we asked him to listen then insisted we wander around listening for the others. We didn’t hear anything except the cries of tiny animals. Only after an hour did he cool off enough to listen to reason.

On the silent march back to camp, out of nowhere, a chill crawled along my spine. I felt the weight of hidden eyes crawling all over us. It was like standing in an art gallery getting tracked by the portraits mounted along the walls. Now and again, I’d whip my head around only to see branches shudder and exhale in the breeze.

At the campsite, Nancy and Liz were all questions. Ulrich explained what happened and then outlined the next steps.

An outraged Tim said, “So we’re just gonna move on?”

“If I can’t locate them by nightfall, yes. We’ll leave food, water, and instructions to stay put if they find their way here.”

“Wait, is Mom, like, *lost* lost?” Liz couldn’t keep the tremor from her voice.

I nodded.

“You’re fucking nuts if you think I’m leaving Tam.”

“Please,” Ulrich said. “It’s important we stick together.”

“You’re a fucking clown. And you,” the big guy jabbed a huge finger into my chest, hard. “You’re seriously okay with this?”

I sighed. “Look, we’ve already had one lucky escape. That fall could have snapped both our necks. And the more time we spend out there, the more likely it is Mom and Tammy get hurt.”

“Assuming they aren’t already,” Nancy added.

The ex-boxer cut a glance in her direction. “What?”

“I’m just saying, it would make sense. Say if one of them rolled an ankle, they’d get stranded, y’know?”

Fists clenched, Tim took a step toward her. “You think Tammy’s hurt?”

Nancy, not one to let anybody intimidate her, faced the tyrant head on. “I didn’t say that. But it's a possibility."

With that, everybody began shouting over one another. For days the group’s collective irritation had festered like an open wound; the claustrophobic environment made us all uneasy. Still, if not for the latest disaster, we might have posed for a group photo at the final leg of our journey—a cosy log cabin—and departed Facebook friends.

Not anymore.

In an attempt to curb the flaring emotions, I whistled for attention. “Tim, look, I don’t like this anymore than you, but we’ve gotta be realistic here. These rangers, they’ll have helicopters, sniffer dogs. Right Ulrich?”

“Correct.”

"So the sooner we reach civilization, the sooner a proper rescue operation can begin."

Tim glanced around at the anxious faces. “Fine.”

The afternoon passed in a whirlwind of chain-smoking and nervous pacing. Ulrich conducted another search, alone this time, while Nancy kept Liz distracted by guiding her through a yoga routine.

Had I really heard Mom earlier? Probably not. Maybe the forest played tricks on my mind. Or hell, maybe the trees themselves were whispering to each other, tactically giving away our position.

I shook away this idea and told myself the others might still arrive back at any moment, even though I knew it wasn’t true. You saw those gruesome stories on the news all the time. Back in England, people would read the headline MOTHER OF TWO MISSING and say: yep, she’s a goner alright.

At least the sense of being watched had dissolved. If something was lurking out there before, it’d gone off now.

At sundown Ulrich returned with a pile of twigs and rebuilt the campfire.

“Something the ladies might spot,” he said, as he doused the flames with a cannister of lighter fluid.

Quickly the dark crept in. Huddled by the fire, we watched Ulrich heat a lentil soup, which everybody gobbled up. Images of Mom stranded out there hugging her shivering knees into her chest whirled around in my mind’s eye.

After dinner, Ulrich stood and said, “First thing in the morning, we move West. If we really push our pace, we can reach the station by sundown, maybe sooner. We leave at dawn. Understood?”

A murmur of agreement went up from everybody except Tim.

“Tim, understood?”

He gave a faint nod.

“Then get some sleep.”

I was savouring one final cigarette when Liz walked up and said, “Are we really leaving Mom behind?” 

From the red, puffed out eyes, I could tell she’d been crying. Stupid, Darren. I’d been so concerned about Mom I dismissed Liz’s feelings. My own grief had been restrained by a protective instinct to ensure my baby sister survived.

At this point Mom would have offered up some comforting words. She had a real knack for putting people's minds at ease. Once, when I was seven, I came off my bike, went skidding across the pavement, and tore a gash out of my knee. Mom held me tight all the way to the emergency room, singing, *you are my sunshine, my only sunshine…*

I sighed. “If she doesn’t find her way back, yeah.”

“But why?” *Why? Because I said so, THAT’S why!* “Mom’s gotta be around here somewhere. What if she finds the campsite but we’re all gone?”

“What if she gets herself *more* lost?” I said, exhaling smoke through my nostrils.

“Well I’m not leaving. I’m gonna go find her.”

“Then you’ll be doing it alone,” I yelled, more forcefully than intended. “And enjoy spending the next few nights out here by yourself.”

Liz stomped off and crawled inside her tent. Damnit. 

Ironically, our mother intended the trip to act as a ‘family bonding’ experience. See Liz and I’s 9-year age gap meant we had zero in common and often went months without speaking, so what did dear mumsy do to foster some sense of sibling affinity? That’s right: drag her children halfway across the continent for an adventure trek. Despite the fact one kid hadn’t gone camping since he quit the scouts fifteen years earlier. And the other spent 23 hours a day glued to her phone.

Later, cocooned inside my bedroll, I couldn’t rest; couldn’t even lie still. What kind of son deserted his own mother anyway? And as if that wasn’t bad enough, our final conversation had been a pointless argument about my smoking…

“TAMMY!”

I sat bolt upright. There was an argument taking place outside. I pulled on my boots.

Along the campsite’s outer edge, Nancy was picking herself up from the tall grass.

“What happened?” a concerned Ulrich asked, as we all approached.

“Tim and I heard Tammy. I tried to make him wait, but the bastard pushed me over.”

Cue more angry German swearing. “You’re *certain* it was Tammy?”

She nodded. “Sounded real close, too.”

“Darren, I need your help.” Ulrich grabbed two flashlights from his pack and tossed one at me. A single glance at the pitch-black woods made my stomach fold itself in a knot.

To Nancy I said, “Will you stay here with Liz?”

“Yeah sure. I’ve gotta clean this up anyway.” There was a scratch along her forearm. She probed the cut, then grimaced. “When you find that moron, tell him he might wanna stay away.”

In the swimming gloom, our torch beams illuminated skeletal branches and shivering leaves as we called for the others. Harsh, jerky woodland breaths cut me right down to the bone, and sharp limbs threatened to decapitate us every five steps. It almost felt like bony hands were closing in around us from all angles, cutting off any hope of escape.

Every so often I glimpsed movement in my periphery vision, or thought I did, but it always vanished before my light trained on the spot. 

A faint murmur drifted toward us. Ulrich signalled a full stop. “Hello?” he called, his voice echoing off every branch in the vicinity. For a moment, the forest stopped shivering in its various joints. 

“Is someone there?” That was Tammy’s voice, muffled and indistinct.

“TAMMY!” I shouted, spinning in a wild frenzy. “WHERE ARE YOU?”

“…Hello?”

“This way,” Ulrich said.

I followed him over a boulder and through a nestle of ferns, and as I did, a tightness spread across my chest. In anticipation of a harsh coughing fit, I slowed down and choked out a feeble, “Ulrich, wait.”

As the gap between his and my torches widened, I kicked myself for not taking Mom’s suggestion about the nicotine patches.

Despite the burning in my throat, I pushed on until an exposed root caught my toe. The next thing I remember is lying flat along the cold, hard earth gulping down air. Already the thick darkness had swallowed Ulrich’s light. What direction even was the campsite? Impossible to tell.

Before my vision could stabilize, there came a burst of wild laughter. It was impossible to say which direction it came from.

My hand groped for the discarded torch. I scanned the beam across the dark, suffocating nowhere.

Still on the verge of that coughing fit, I cleared my throat and said, “Hello?”

The only sound was the blood pumping between my ears.

I fumbled along on my free hand and knees until I heard a buzzing, louder than traffic. As I felt my way along a blanket of pine needles, the earth became sticky, then rubbery. I flinched and angled the torch forward.

Uncovered by yellow light was a dead thing sprawled across exposed roots, all tattered flesh intermixed with blue-purple guts, badly twisted out of shape and crawling—absolutely crawling—with fat, noisy flies.

Amidst the gore lay a shiny metal object. With a trembling hand, I swept aside the droning swarm. And when I realized what lay at the foot of that crooked tree, a dry cramp seized my throat.

Just then, that sense of *presence* came crashing back as the insect cloud resettled. Unseen eyes were slithering all over me once again.

I scrambled to my feet, heart slamming against my chest. The torch illuminated a rustling thornbush roughly thirty yards ahead. Beyond it, shadows danced along warped, tumorous trunks. Whatever lay out there moved close to the ground.

“W-who’s there?” I cried.

A child’s high, anguished voice spoke from within the darkness. “Mommy, is that you?”

I took off running. I didn’t understand what I’d heard, only that my instincts screamed: it isn’t human, get away now!

With every step, the choking underbrush became tighter and tighter, constricting my movement. At any second I might have hit a dead end. Waves of black panic threatened to choke the life out of me.

But then a flickering, orange light appeared between a cluster of saplings, way out in front. I gritted my teeth, charged forward, and didn’t stop until I burst into the campfire’s warm glow.

Surprised by my sudden arrival, Nancy and Liz shrieked.

“Oh, it’s you,” Nance said. “What happened to your face? Where’s Ulrich?”

Ignoring her, I rushed over and grabbed our guide’s backpack and tore through it and grabbed a large hunting knife. I faced the ladies, blade in hand. But before I could catch my breath the forest vomited up an irate Tim, his raincoat covered in ragged holes. Moonlight glinted off the wedding ring around his neck.

He explained he couldn’t locate his wife, so he’d followed the ladies’ screams back. 

He took one look at the knife and said, “What’s your problem?”

All eyes settled on me, anticipating an answer I didn't want to give.

What should I have told them first—about the disembodied floating voice? The tattered corpse?

Or maybe how Tammy’s discarded [wedding ring was laying amongst a spool of fresh intestines…](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)
