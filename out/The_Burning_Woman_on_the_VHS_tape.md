My story The Burning Woman on the VHS Tape was recorded for the "Let me tell you a Scary Story" podcast :) [https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-165-the-girl-on-the-vhs-tape/id1547033101?i=1000721767958](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-165-the-girl-on-the-vhs-tape/id1547033101?i=1000721767958)



What I’m about to share has been eating at me for a few months, and I haven’t found a way to stop thinking about it. I don’t know if this is a true “unsolved mystery,” or just some coincidence that my brain has latched onto. But maybe someone here will recognize what I’m talking about. Or maybe someone knows more.

First, some background: my uncle Nicky (not his real name) died in 2019 from a heart attack. He was always a little…off. Not dangerous or anything, just kind of a creep. He never really had a stable job, bounced around from warehouse work to cab driving, did a stint at a used car dealership that got shut down. He lived in Stockton, California his whole life. Never married. Lived in a cluttered rental house with yellowing blinds and old paperbacks stacked everywhere. You get the picture.

When he died, I helped my mom clear out his place. We boxed up the books, donated most of the clothes, dumped the junk. At one point I opened a closet in the hallway and found a milk crate full of old VHS tapes. Most were unmarked or had things like “Raiders Game 1989” written on them. I kept a few out of curiosity, thinking it might be fun to see what he recorded back in the day. I didn’t even have a working VCR at the time, but I held onto the tapes.

Fast forward to this past spring. I bought an old VCR/DVD combo off eBay for twenty bucks. One rainy night, I hooked it up and started popping in tapes. First few were what you’d expect — random football games, sitcoms with old commercials, a few minutes of scrambled porn. Nothing weird.

Until one tape.

It was unmarked. Just a generic black Maxell VHS. I popped it in. No title screen, no static — it just started playing.

It was clearly shot from the passenger seat of a car. Nighttime. The camcorder quality was early ‘90s — grainy and washed in that orangey sodium streetlight glow. You could hear two guys talking.

Right away, I froze.

Because one of them — the one not holding the camera — had a voice I recognized.

It was Nicky.

His laugh, his stupid slangy way of talking, even the way he called the driver “bro.” It was him. I’d bet money on it. I know that voice.

He’s in the passenger seat, drinking something from a bottle in a brown bag. They’re just cruising through Stockton at night. The other guy — the one filming — never shows his face, but his voice is deeper, calmer. He mostly just asks questions. Like:

“You see her?”

“What do you think, Nicky?”

“Would she burn good?”

I remember that last one because it made my skin crawl.

They start cruising by women walking alone. Women of all types — younger, older, walking back from work or the corner store or maybe just out for a walk. Nicky makes gross comments. “Damn, look at her.” “Bet she smells good, huh?” Just nasty stuff.

At one point, they follow a woman walking down a poorly lit side street. She turns off into a small apartment complex and disappears from view. They circle the block twice. Nicky’s voice gets quieter. The driver says:

 

“You wanna talk to this one?”

“Nah man, she ain’t the type,” Nicky says. “Too much mouth.”

“Bet she screams real nice,” the cameraman says.

Then they both laugh.

This goes on for about 30 minutes. It’s hard to follow exactly where they are, but I recognize a few intersections from visits to my uncle’s neighborhood growing up. They’re mostly sticking around South Stockton. Filming women. Talking low. Whispering weird things.

Then, toward the end of the tape, they pull up alongside a woman standing at a bus stop. She’s wearing a light-colored jacket and jeans. Maybe in her 30s. Nicky rolls down his window.

“Hey, you good? You need a ride?”

She shakes her head.

“Come on, it’s cold. We’re headed that way.”

“No thanks,” she says, firm.

She walks away. They sit silently for a moment, then the camera zooms in on her as she walks.

The next cut is abrupt. The timestamp jumps forward, maybe an hour and 30 minutes. Now the car is parked. You can’t see much — the camera is pointed out the windshield, and there’s smoke in the air.

Something is on fire.

The cameraman zooms in on what looks like a small building — maybe a house or one of those four-unit complexes. Flames are coming out of the windows. Nicky’s not talking anymore.

Then something else.

A scream.

It’s faint, but it’s there — high-pitched and desperate. From inside the building.

The camera zooms in, shakily. The cameraman  laughs. Low and quiet at first, then louder. Then he says. 'Told you she'd burn good, Nicky.'

That’s when I hit stop.

I didn’t know what to do with myself. I just sat there with the remote in my hand, feeling cold and sick. I’ve watched true crime stuff for years, but this was different. This was real. This was my family.

I waited a few days before watching the rest. The tape cuts off a few minutes after the fire. No names are mentioned. No license plate is visible. Just that voice. That awful voice, laughing.

Here’s where it gets worse.

I started Googling. I looked up arsons in Stockton in the early ’90s. There were a few cases, but only one matched what I saw on the tape.

In 1990, a woman died in a house fire on Elm Street. Fire was ruled arson. She was 33. Lived alone. Neighbors said they saw a “dark-colored car” driving slowly past the house about 20 minutes before the fire started.

 

No one was ever arrested.

The case went cold.

That was the woman in the video. I’m sure of it.

I haven’t turned the tape in yet. I’m scared. What if they don’t believe me? What if they do? What if my uncle had something to do with this woman’s death?

And more than that — who was the man filming?

Nicky died of natural causes. But whoever was holding that camera — he might still be out there. He might have done this more than once.

And he’s never been caught.

If you’re reading this and you know anything about the 1990 Stockton arson… please say something.

Because someone out there has a voice like gravel and laughs at women burning to death. And he made a tape. And it ended up in my uncle’s house.

And I don’t know what to do next.
