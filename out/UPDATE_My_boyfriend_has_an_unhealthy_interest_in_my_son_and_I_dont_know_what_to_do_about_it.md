A few days ago, I wrote about my (33F) boyfriend’s (35M) bizarre behavior around my son (10M), whom I’m calling “Jordan” on this post. [I listed several unsettling things Darren (boyfriend) was doing with Jordan](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/128nq36/my_boyfriend_has_an_unhealthy_interest_in_my_son/), praying that it wasn’t as bad as I thought, and that things wouldn’t get any worse.

They got worse. 

I had resolved to cut things off with Darren; at this point, my biggest concern was whether he would accept a clean break and allow me to be alone in my own home with my son. It made the most sense to end things over the phone. 

For an entire day after the bedroom incident, he didn’t return my calls. 

That morning, I had gotten up at first light, clutching a remote control as my only weapon while I approached the other bedroom, where I’d left Darren passed out on the floor. Jordan was still asleep in my room. Placing a shaking hand on Jordan’s bedroom door, I pressed it open, not knowing whether Darren would be where I’d found him the night before.

He was gone. A chilly breeze fluttered through the open window; the place felt emptier than usual.

I started breathing again.

Throughout the day, I attempted to call Darren nineteen times. The last thirteen went straight to voicemail.

I thought that maybe the problem would take care of itself.
	  
I thought many hopeful things that ended up furthest from what I needed.

He knocked on the door at 7:13 p. m. I approached, but didn’t open it. 

“I know you’re there. I just want to talk, I promise.”

I told Jordan to go up to my room and wait on my bed before leaning against the frame, praying that Darren would go away. 

But he didn’t stop pleading. 

“I promise that I’ll leave without a fuss if I can just go into the hallway and talk for two minutes. Please, babe, it’s freezing out here.”

I closed my eyes. “You promise that you’ll leave after TWO minutes and stop bothering me forever?”

I prayed that he would live up to his word.

But as soon as I closed the door behind us, Darren wrapped his arms around my chest, pinning my elbows to my side. Heart racing, I opened my mouth to scream at Jordan to run away. 

And then I stopped myself. My apartment is on the third floor, and the only way out of my bedroom is the hallway that Darren was now dragging me through. 

Things were going to happen his way, whether I liked it or not.

I hadn’t realized how strong Darren was until my efforts to escape his grasp felt so powerless. A few seconds later, we were standing outside the door to my room.

“Either Jordan can see us struggling, or you can tell him to go to his room without a fight. *Choose*,” he hissed.

I forced my breath to be as steady as possible, surprised at how calm my voice sounded. “I’ll tell him to leave,” I whispered. 

He released me, and I cracked open the door. My heart fell through my stomach as the sliver of hallway light illuminated a tiny lump beneath my blanket; Jordan was growing up, but he was still naïve enough to believe that hiding under the covers could protect him from a world that wanted him to hurt. 

I prided myself on hiding my fear as I called him forward, gave him a kiss on his head after he ran toward me, and then sent him to his room. It’s a parent’s job to maximize a child’s delusion that life isn’t a sinking ship, taking everything we love one piece at a time. 

“I’ve done what you asked,” I hissed as I closed myself in the bedroom with Darren. “What do you-”

He cut off my sentence by clapping one hand over my mouth and dragging me to the bed. He kicked the door shut, plunging us into darkness. 

I fought. It’s a gut-punch to be controlled by someone so physically dominant; but I resisted so that Darren couldn’t subdue my mind in the same way that he was manipulating my body. 

It was so hard to breathe that I nearly passed out as he threw me onto the bed with him.

I closed my eyes.

And then – stillness. For several minutes, we waited in complete silence. That might seem like the perfect outcome, but nothing can compare to the misery of anticipating imminent terror and pain. Imagine staring at a pistol that was pointed at your stomach; how long could you quietly wait before losing your mind? 

I thought I was at the breaking point when something moved.

It was not Darren.

Footsteps came from the floor-to-ceiling curtains in the corner of my room. My insides turned to concrete as someone emerged from the shadows before moving to the window and squeaking it open. As Darren continued to force my silence, I listened while they slipped through the third-floor window and out into the night.

I wanted Darren to release my mouth for a different reason at this point; his hand was covering my face so aggressively that I was on the verge of passing out. 

“I know you’re scared shitless,” he whispered into my ear. “And I’m ready to start explaining, but you have to promise you’ll behave if I let you go. You need to realize that, if I release you, fighting back would be the worst possible decision. *Do you understand?*”

I balked.

“*Jordan doesn’t have time for you to wait.*”

I knew that Darren could feel me trembling.

I nodded as best I could against his hands.

“Good girl,” he breathed. For a moment, he did nothing.

Then he let me go. I gasped for air, head spinning, trying and failing to think of a course of action that wasn’t soul-crushingly terrible. 

So I turned on my ex-boyfriend. “Speak,” I spat.

His touch softened in the darkness. One of Darren’s many faults is that he knew how to be forceful, but couldn’t figure out gentleness. He took a deep breath. 

“I’m so sorry for so many things, Carol,” he sighed. “I wish I never had to lie to you.” He ran his fingers along my cheek, botching a cringe-worthy attempt at affection.

“Just tell me what it will take for me to *never* see you again,” I hissed. 

He sighed once more, longer this time. “I’m afraid I can’t do that, Carol. The Order would retaliate. They believe I’m still working for them, but I can’t maintain the ruse for long. It’s an enormous risk, and I’ll only be able to continue keeping Jordan safe if you do *exactly* as I say.”
