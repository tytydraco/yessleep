I never meant for anyone else to get dragged into this. If you’re reading this, I need you to believe every word. Last October, I bought an old cabin in the woods just outside Arkville, New York. It was cheap—too cheap—but I’d always dreamed of escaping the city and writing my first novel surrounded by nothing but pines and fog. The locals warned me about the “whispering woods,” but I laughed it off. Until the first night.

It started with the knocks. Three slow, deliberate raps on the door at exactly 2:17 AM. I’d wake with my heart in my throat, convinced rain had finally loosened the shutters. But the air was still, the moon a pale sliver outside my window. I checked the security camera footage the next morning: there was no one there. Just empty porch boards and the distant hoot of an owl.

The second night, I heard the laughter. It was soft at first, like children playing tag just beyond my field of vision. I threw on every light and peered through the cracked curtains, but saw nothing. I told myself it was the wind echoing off the abandoned mine shaft down the hill. That was my excuse—until I realized the laughter was coming from inside the house.

On night three, I found the message. Scrawled in what looked like dirt on the living-room window, three words that made blood freeze in my veins: “Help me find her.” My neighbor, old Mrs. Carmichael, had disappeared in these woods fifteen years ago. They found her journals scattered among the roots of a fallen beech, her final pages smeared with something dark and sticky. The police ruled it a suicide, but everyone in Arkville whispered about shadows that moved without light, voices calling travelers deeper into the trees.

I didn’t believe any of it—until the scratching started. Late that night, coming from the attic. My cabin had no attic. The sound was frantic, like nails tearing at plaster. I grabbed my phone and shone the flashlight up into the ceiling joists: empty. When I tore away a loose board, there was nothing but a spider’s nest and a chunk of old insulation. I’m not superstitious, but that night I slept with my shovel by the bed.

Night four, I lost my phone. One second it was on the bedside table, screen aglow; the next, gone. My heart hammered as I searched the room in the dark until I stubbed my toe on something soft and warm. It was my phone—face down in a puddle of muddy water, the screen cracked in a perfect circle. And beside it, a small, wet handprint. I don’t have children.

That same night, the voice came through the static of my radio—her voice. Faint but unmistakable: “Please… help me.” I jumped, slammed the radio off, but the pleading rose from the darkness, mingled with a low rustle, like dozens of leaves shifting at once. I threw on my coat and staggered outside to the porch, flashlight stabbing into the trees. The beam landed on two pinprick points of light, just beyond the treeline. They blinked, and vanished.

By dawn, I was certain I’d lost my mind. But the next morning, I found her journal wedged between the mattress and box spring. Pages dog-eared, written in Mrs. Carmichael’s neat cursive, describing exactly what I’d experienced—knocks at 2:17, laughter in the halls, a message on the window. The last entry ended mid-sentence: “The forest knows me now. I can’t—”

I ran. Packed a duffel bag, drove all the way to my brother’s place in Albany. I thought leaving would stop whatever had attached itself to me. But the echo followed: the tapping on the walls of my apartment at exactly 2:17 AM, the giggle drifting through the vents. I smashed my phone when the radio crackled her voice again. But there’s no escaping it. The whispering woods have found me, and they want her back.

I’m posting this because I don’t know what else to do. If you live near a place with stories like mine—old cabins, abandoned mines, people who vanished without a trace—stay the hell away. Because tonight, at 2:17 AM, they’ll come knocking, and you’ll swear the wind knows your name.
