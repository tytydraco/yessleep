I live in a small house, simple, cozy, filled with things that actually mean something to me. My plates, mugs, and bowls were all made by my mother before she died, the curtains belonged to my grandmother, and the paintings on the walls are from my sister and I. This is what I inherited it after my parents passed away two years ago.

I have to confess something, I have not seen my sister since their funeral. It was a stormy day, rain pouring in sheets and thunder shaking the windows hard enough to rattle the glass. Honestly, it felt dramatic in a way that matched them, since they always did everything together, even dying.

My sister Ana and I were very close growing up, but after her wedding five years ago, she just disappeared from my life. She showed up at the funeral, hugged me with cold arms, cried once, then left without a goodbye.

Today I finally decided I am going to her house. If she will not reach out, then I will, It has been two years since I last saw her, and I miss her, I miss having some sort of family around.

"Megan, what are you doing?" Charlie calls from the doorway, my boyfriend, kind of, honestly I do not know what we are. "Still planning on tormenting your sister? She clearly does not want anything to do with you."

That stings. He knows everything about my childhood and everything about Ana, even things I am not sure I told him. Maybe I said more than I meant to when we started seeing each other.

"Yes, Charlie, I am going to Ana’s house to see what is going on," I say while folding clothes on my bed just to keep my hands busy. "I will see you when I get back."

His face tightens into that expression he gets where I can never tell if he pities me, or if he thinks I am being pathetic. "I am not letting you go alone," he says, grabbing his keys. "I will wait in the car." At least he is a gentleman.

He is a good guy, he is honest, sometimes too honest. We met ten days after my parents’ funeral at a grief group I went once. He was there because his best friend died, her name was Megan too, and they knew each other for twenty years. After he met me, he stopped going, said he felt better now, but sometimes I wonder if he actually likes me, or if he just likes saying my name.

When we arrive at Ana’s house, I realize it is not a house at all. It is a mansion, a massive place tucked behind huge gates and perfect landscaping. I knew she married well, but this is ridiculous. Her husband was always quiet, polite, almost empty behind the eyes. I met him maybe three times, including the wedding. I always assumed he sold drugs or killed people for money, something like that. Also he never seemed to like us, my parents didn't take it super well the fact that she kind of left us when she got married but they kept life going. It makes me a little sad that she never invited our parents here. They would have loved to spend a day pretending to have a luxury life.

A tear streams down my face thinking about my parents. I miss them every single day.

I ring the bell. Nothing. I ring again. And again. Ten times. Still nothing. It is Sunday evening, there is no reason they would not be home.

I peek through the window, and I freeze. Ana is sitting on the couch. She is looking straight at me, not blinking, not moving, her face completely still. The kind of staring that goes right through your eyes and stops somewhere behind them. I can’t help but smile, because part of me is genuinely happy to see her.

I step closer to knock on the window, like she is a fish in an aquarium. "Charlie, look, she is here."

He comes beside me, and in the two seconds I look at him and then back at the glass, she is suddenly right there. Inches from the window. Her face pressed against it, her eyes wide and her mouth hanging open in a way that looks too heavy for her jaw to hold.

And before I can even move, she screams. A sound that vibrates through my bones, sharp enough to slice the air on my lungs.

I run closer to the car, my legs shaking so badly I barely make it. When I look back, Charlie is still standing near the window. Ana is gone.

"Charlie, lets get in the car, I am scared," I yell.

"I think she is more scared than you," he says. His voice shakes even though he tries to hide it. "She ran the moment I looked at her. We should ask a neighbor, someone must know what is going on."

I hate the idea. But I do not have another plan, and every inch of me is trembling but I still want to know what is going on. It's my sister after all.

Before we can pick a house, a girl approaches us. She looks young, stylish, maybe twenty-five, and painfully familiar. "Hi, what are you guys doing here?" she asks, looking between us and narrowing her eyes at me. I clearly look familiar to her too. "I saw you looking at the big house. What do you know about that place?"

Before I can answer, Charlie goes pale. I'm sensing something wrong and so is he, I can just feel it.

"What is that," he whispers, staring at the mansion window. "I saw her. It cannot be real."

The girl’s eyes widen. "Oh my god. It is happening already."

"Okay, too much," I say, trying not to vomit from fear. "Charlie, honey, who did you see? And you, who are you?"

Charlie puts his hands on his head like he is trying to hold something inside. "I saw Megan. My Megan." 

My stomach drops like a stone. "What..."

He reaches for my arm, but I move away from him instinctively.

The girl clears her throat. "Sorry. I’m Nina." She holds out her hand, and I shake it automatically. "I am here because my brother lives or lived in that mansion." She looks at the ground on the last words.

"Wait, Nina?" I say, shocked. "I'm Megan. Ana’s sister. I'm here to talk to her."

She freezes. Her jaw drops. "Oh my god. It has been years. You look different."

She is right. After my parents died, I lost weight, changed my wardrobe, my hair, my everything. I barely recognize myself. She looks really good too, very different, but with the same essence as the little girl I met when we were younger.

Charlie stops staring at the window long enough to look at us, and Nina blinks a few times before finally saying it.

"You said you are here to talk to Ana," She looks genuinely upset saying it "Megan, your sister is not alive."

Everything in me stops.

"She died five years ago," Nina says, her voice small. "Right after her wedding. Everyone knows. The casket was closed, nobody saw her body. Nobody wanted to. They even said that your family didn't attend the funeral because you guys were too sad."

My mouth dries out instantly. "That is impossible. She was at our parents' funeral. She cried on my shoulder. She held my hand." My lungs tighten painfully. Did my parents know this? Did they lie to me?

Nina shakes her head slowly. "That was not her."

Charlie is confused "And the woman I saw… she was not my Megan either. My Megan died five years ago as well. But the thing in that window looked like her, except wrong."

Cold emptiness spreads through my chest.

Nina steps closer. "My brother said this place is not normal. People show up in the house sometimes, people he recognizes, people who should not exist anymore. They stare. They do not blink. And if you get close, they scream like they want to tear your face off."

There is movement at the window. Slow, deliberate. A shape peeling itself forward from the darkness inside.

Not Ana or Megan, but something smiling. Smiling at us, seems almost happy with our confusion. The figure tilts its head. The glass fogs with its breath.

We do not move. Not for a long time. The thing in the window does not move either. It watches us. The air feels heavy and suffocating. I want to look away, but something tells me that if I break eye contact, it will appear right behind me.

"Meg," Charlie whispers, his voice trembling violently, "we need to go to the car. Right now. Please."

But the car feels far. Too far. Like the driveway stretched while we were talking. My legs feel hollow, weak, like they might fold under me.

Nina pulls my sleeve gently. "Listen to me. My brother said the house reacts when people try to leave. It does not like it when someone gets close to discovering what is inside. If we move too quickly, it will follow us."

"Follow us?" I repeat, my voice thin. "Nina, what do you mean follow us? You have a lot of explaining to do."

She looks at me then, really looks at me, and there is something awful in her eyes. Something like regret.

"This house is not haunted," she says. "It is hungry."

The word hungry hits something deep inside my stomach, something that makes my throat tighten like a fist is closing around it.

The figure in the window shifts slightly, its neck bending to the side in a slow, unnatural arc, like it is smelling us through the glass.

Charlie steps back and accidentally kicks a loose stone. The noise is small, but it echoes down the silent street like a scream.

The figure freezes, then it moves out of view.

I whisper, without meaning to, "Where did she go?"

No one answers.

Charlie turns and runs but he doesn't make it halfway.

The front gate slams shut on its own, the metal shaking so violently it rattles the ground. Charlie crashes into it so hard he knocks the air out of himself, sliding down to his knees.

"What the hell," he gasps. "What the actual hell!"

The lock on the gate clicks. Not like someone locked it, but like the metal itself decided we are not leaving.

Nina grabs the bars and yanks hard. "It trapped us. It trapped us outside on purpose. It wants us near the house."

My chest tightens so painfully I cannot breathe.

The front door creaks open, slowly, quietly, like it is inviting us.

"Megan, do not go near that door," Charlie says, pulling me back. "It wants you the most. It showed itself to you first. It screamed at you."

I want to listen. I want to run and cry and hide. But I cannot move because the front door is not empty anymore.

Ana stands there, but she is not right.

Her head hangs slightly forward, like her neck cannot support its weight. Her arms hang stiff at her sides, and her fingers curl and uncurl like she is practicing the movement. Her eyes shine too brightly, like wet glass.

She steps onto the porch one shaky step at a time, her body moving like someone is pulling her joints by strings.

“Megan,” she says, and her voice sounds like she is trying to remember how to speak.

I step back, my heel hitting the curb.

Ana smiles, or tries to. Her lips stretch too wide, showing all of her teeth at once.

“Welcome home,” she whispers.

Nina grips my wrist. “Do not listen to her. That is not your sister. She is gone. That thing is using her face.”

Charlie steps closer, pressing his arm around my waist protectively. His heartbeat is shaking through him. “Megan, look at me. Not at her. Look at me.”

But I can't.

Because Ana tilts her head upward, toward the second-floor window, like she is signaling something.

Then I hear heavy footsteps.

Something else is inside the house, something bigger, something that does not care about hiding.

A massive hand slams against the upstairs window. Fingers too long, too thin, pressing hard enough against the glass that it bends outward.

Charlie flinches, pulling me with him, trembling uncontrollably.

"It wants us together," Nina whispers. "It likes connections. My brother told me that before he disappeared. The house uses people who belong to each other."

My heart stops.

Ana takes another step down the porch. She is halfway to us now.

"Megan," she says, voice breaking in the middle like something tearing. "You left me here."

"I did not know," I croak. "I did not know anything that happened to you."

Ana’s smile twitches furrowing her brows. "You did not look for me."

Charlie steps in front of me again, breathing hard. "She is not your sister. I swear we have to find a way to leave."

The gate rattles again. Something drags across the metal from the outside.

We are now trapped between monsters.

Ana whispers "Let me show you something."

She opens her mouth wider than any human jaw should, wider and wider until the skin at the edges tears slightly.

And from inside the house behind her, something starts walking down the porch.

Something is coming down the porch behind Ana, something so heavy the wood groans under each step. The light above the door flickers, struggling to stay alive. My heart pounds against my ribs so hard it hurts. I feel Charlie's arm tighten around me, holding me in place like he is afraid the house will suck me forward if he loosens his grip even a little.

Nina steps closer, her voice shaking. "This is what my brother tried to warn me about. He said the house doesn't just show them. It keeps them. Uses them. Feeds on them. He said once you see what it shows you, it marks you. You belong to it."

"What happened to him?" I whisper. "Nina, what really happened to your brother?"

She looks at me, and for a moment her face folds in on itself, like she is fighting the urge to sob. "After Ana's death he came to visit the house they bought together. He said he saw someone in the window too. Someone he loved. Someone dead. And then he... changed. He stopped talking. He stopped eating. He said the house was calling him. One night he went inside, and the door locked behind him and I never saw him again."

"So you were with him, when he went missing" I say to Nina but before she can say something a loud crack echoes from the porch, and all three of us look up.

The thing behind Ana steps into the doorway. It fills the frame entirely.

Too tall to be human, too wide to fit through the door without bending in unnatural ways. Its skin is stretched thin across its bones, gray and tight, like it was dried and rehydrated wrong. Its face is wrong, blurred, like wet paint running on a canvas. Its eyes shine with a milky gloss, as if they were stolen from somewhere else, and it has so many teeth.

Ana moves aside to give it space, like she is welcoming it.

Charlie stumbles backward, dragging me with him. "No, no, no, no, Meg, we are not dying here. We are not. I will get you out. I promise."

His voice cracks at the last word, and it breaks something inside me. His voice is raw, terrified in a way he never allowed himself to be.

Ana steps down the last porch stair.

"Megan," she whispers, "come home."

Nina pulls at my arm. "If we run to the side gate, maybe we can climb. My brother tried it. He almost made it before it pulled him back. But maybe, maybe with all of us..."

The house makes a sound then.

A groaning, dragging, breathing moan that rises from the foundation itself. The ground vibrates beneath our feet. The windows shake. The grass seems to curl toward the porch, bending as if pulled by some invisible force.

Nina gasps "It knows we are trying to run."

Charlie’s hand slips from mine for half a second when the ground trembles, and that moment is all it takes.

Ana lunges.

She moves like her body is being thrown forward by something behind her. Her arms snap outward, fingers curled like claws. Charlie shoves me behind him so hard I lose my balance and fall onto the pavement.

He stands between me and Ana. Between me and the thing wearing her face.

"Take me," Charlie shouts. "Take me, not her."

"No!" I scream, scrambling to my feet. "Charlie please don't"

"Meg, you have a lot to live, I need to do something right. I need to save at least one Megan, you, my Megan" He does not look back. His shoulders square, his body trembling violently. "I mean it. Take me. I'll go inside. I'll do whatever you want. Just leave her alone."

The creature on the porch exhales, a long rasping sigh that sounds like rot escaping from lungs buried underground.

Ana reaches for him, her fingers stretch too far, too long, grabbing him by the shoulders. Charlie screams when her touch burns through his shirt and his skin bubbles up instantly, like acid. He tries to push her away, but she is strong. Too strong.

"Megan, run!" he screams. "Please! Run!"

The thing that was once behind Ana moves forward, leaning over her, its head lowering toward Charlie like it is smelling him.

He kicks and thrashes, his face twisted in agony, but Ana holds him like a mother holding a child, tightening her grip until he cannot move. His breath comes out in loud, wet sobs. His eyes search for me, full of terror, regret, and something like love.

"Megan," he whispers, "I'm sorry. I should have told you earlier. I loved you. I..."

His voice cuts off. It happened so fast.

The creature bends and swallows him.

Not with a mouth. But with a darkness that pours out of its face, wrapping around him like wet cloth. Charlie’s body sinks into it, like he is being folded into the creature's skin. His scream echoes, not from his mouth, but from inside the creature, echoing and echoing until it fades into silence as his last breath disappears inside the thing that uses my sister's face.

Nina lets out a sight, I completely forgot she is here, she seems weirdly quiet when we are not speaking to her directly.

I cannot breathe. I cannot move. I cannot think. My body goes numb, shaking uncontrollably. Oh my Charlie, I can't even process right.

Ana turns back toward me.

Without Charlie in her grasp, her arms dangle loosely again, twitching at the elbows. Her neck crooks sharply to the side, recovering from the scene. She smiles a soft smile loving one.

"Megan," she whispers, "you belong with us."

I grab Nina and we sprint along the fence. My legs burn, my lungs feel like they are ripping apart. The gate is shaking again, something banging on it from the outside, as if another creature is trying to get in.

Nina pulls me toward a side corner, where the rusted metal meets a stone wall. "We can climb here. We can..."

A hand bursts through the fence.

Not human but humanoid.

Gray looking, long-fingered, grabbing Nina by the throat.

She chokes, clawing at its grip as her feet lift off the ground. The creature behind the fence pulls her upward, her body dangling helplessly, her eyes wide with terror.

"Megan," she gasps, tears streaming down her face, "I'm sorry. I should have warned you sooner. I should have tired..."

Her neck snaps and she gets dragged upward, over the fence, into the darkness on the other side.

I collapse onto the grass.

The house door opens even wider on its own, and Ana steps into the yard. The large creature moves behind her, almost protectively, its huge hand resting on the doorframe, the same hand that took Nina away.

Ana walks toward me slowly.

I scoot backward until my back hits the cold metal of the locked gate.

Ana kneels in front of me, her face inches from mine.

"Megan," she whispers gently, "stop running. You know where you belong. Here with me. we can live the life we had when we were children."

I close my eyes unable to look at her as her cold fingers touch my cheek.

And the house breathes in and the air around us collapses inward, sucking leaves and dust toward the door like the world is being pulled into its lungs. My hair whips forward, my eyes sting, and Ana's cold fingers slide from my cheek down to my jaw like she is memorizing the shape of my face.

"Megan," she whispers, "come back inside. Please. I have been so lonely."

Her voice breaks on the last word, and for a moment, for the smallest, stupidest moment, I almost believe it. I almost believe my sister misses me. Wants me. Loves me.

But then the thing behind her shifts, rising fully out of the doorway.

Its limbs stretch to the porch railings, gripping them like a giant insect. Its head tilts backward, the blurred face pulling into a wide, impossible grin.

And the house exhales.

A hot, rancid wind hits my face, carrying the smell of dirt, rot, and something metallic, like rusted nails pulled out of wet wood.

"No," I breathe. "No. I don't want to die!"

I shove myself sideways, sliding in the wet grass, grabbing the fence post and pulling myself up. My knees burn. My palms scrape. My lungs scream. But I stand. Somehow, I stand.

Ana rises at me.

Her head twitches sharply, the crack so loud it echoes down the driveway. "Megan," she says, her voice thin, trembling, "do not leave me again. Please. Do not make me follow you like I followed mom and dad."

Our parents? Did they try to reach out and found the house?

She steps forward and the creature follows.

Every step it takes makes the earth tremble. The porch groans, the windows rattle, the entire frame of the mansion shivers in anticipation, like it is excited. Like it is starving.

I stumble backward along the fence, but there is nowhere to go. No gate. No corner. No break in the metal. Just endless railings and the cold breath of the house growing heavier, thicker, stickier, like fog made of hands.

The grass around my shoes shifts.

And I realize it too late.

Something beneath the soil presses up, lifting the dirt like something trying to crawl out. I scream and leap sideways, my foot catching on a root as long, gray fingers break through the ground, reaching for my ankle.

"No!" I cry, kicking free, stumbling so hard I nearly fall again.

Ana is closer now.

Her face trembles, shaking like something inside is trying to push out. Her eyes flicker, glaze, then refocus on me with a pleading softness that is somehow a thousand times worse than if she were a monster.

"I don't want to hurt you," she whispers but aggressively. "I just want you home. Come home. Come home, Megan."

"I don't belong here," I choke out, tears burning hot down my face.

Ana's lips twitch.

"Yes," she says, and her voice deepens with something not hers, "you do."

The creature behind her lunges.

Its arm shoots forward. I scream and dodge, falling sideways into the mud, scrambling backward so desperately that my nails rip.

The hand misses me by inches slamming into the ground, cracking the earth open like thin glass.

"Megan," Ana says again, but now her voice is wrong. Hungry. "Come. Home."

I crawl backward until my spine slams into the fence. The metal vibrates with something behind it, something pacing, waiting, almost eager.

I am trapped.

The creature steps down from the porch, its massive, blurry face tilting as if studying me. Its shoulders unhinge outward, stretching like wings that never finished growing.

Ana takes one last step, standing directly in front of me.

She kneels again, face inches from mine and she smiles. It's heartbreaking.

"Megan," she whispers, "they're gone. Mom, Dad... Charlie. Everyone leaves you. But I won't. I promise I will never leave you again."

My vision blurs with tears.

"I miss you," I sob. "I miss all of you."

She touches my cheek with cold, shaking fingers "Then come home."

The creature behind her opens its arms.

The house creaks again, sucking the air inward, pulling at my hair, my clothes, my breath. I feel myself sliding toward the porch, toward that giant, open hunger waiting for me.

I close my eyes "I love you, Ana," I whisper.

She blinks at my sentence, for a second it looks actually like Ana, my sister who I deeply regret not going after, the woman who taught me a lot about life, the woman who I didn't reach out for five years because I was too petty to be the fist one to reach out. Now I feel all of the regret.

Something warm drips onto my forehead, one of her tears "Sorry Megy, they are forcing.." she chokes and starts to put her hands on her own throat as if she was choking on a piece of meat as she is getting away from me, running towards the house. The last thing I hear is the door slamming shut.

Then everything goes black.

I wake up on my knees, the air is still, Silent and Dead.

The sky is gray, the world muted like someone turned the volume down on reality. I stand shakily, feeling the weight of the house behind me, heavy like a shadow pressed against my spine.

My body does not hurt, only my fingers, where once I had nails. I am not dead, but I do not feel alive either.

I turn slowly toward the mansion. It stands tall, still, its windows shining like they were recently clean.

Then, one window flickers on the second floor. The one where the creature first pressed its hand and a shape appears behind the glass. I know that silhouette. Broad shoulders, messy hair and head tilted slightly to the side.

It's him my Charlie.

His skin is pale, drained of everything warm, everything human. His jaw hangs slightly open, his eyes glossy and empty. He stares at me through the glass, not blinking, not moving just like Ana did. It makes bile rise in my throat, he lifts one hand and presses it against the glass.

His mouth stretches into a smile "Megan," he whispers.

Even through the closed window, I can hear it perfectly as if he was next to me.

"Come home."

I decide to take slow steps towards the car now the all of a sudden someone show up not just anyone, my mother, my very dead mother "Hi, what are you doing here?" she asks, looking at me "I saw you looking at the big house. What do you know about that place?"

I'm not falling for this bait ever again. She is not keeping me here so everything can start over.

I turn my back towards It and get in the car slowly. I can feel her looking at me as I drive away, I can feel all of them staring. But this is not my place, not my home, not my house.
