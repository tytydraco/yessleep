I don’t know how to start this, but I need to get it out before it gets worse. I'm just a dude who works at a warehouse and likes to game. Nothing weird about me, never believed in ghosts or any of that crap. But something’s happening, and I can’t shake it. It’s this… song. Yeah, a song. Sounds dumb, right? But it’s not. It’s in my head, and it’s not just a catchy tune—it’s doing something to me. To my life. I’m posting this here cause I don’t know where else to go. Maybe someone’s heard this thing before.

It started two weeks ago. I was scrolling YouTube late at night, you know, the usual rabbit hole of dumb videos. Found this weird clip, no thumbnail, just a black screen with the title “Listen Once.” No channel name, no comments, no likes, just… there. I clicked it cause I was bored. Big mistake. It was this melody, no lyrics, just a looping tune—kinda like a music box but off, like it was played on rusty strings. It wasn’t creepy at first, just… stuck with me. I hummed it after the video ended, couldn’t stop. Didn’t think much of it, closed my laptop, went to bed.

Next morning, it’s still in my head. Like, LOUD. I’m brushing my teeth, and I’m humming it without thinking. I try to listen to my usual playlist—metal, rap, whatever—to drown it out, but it’s like the tune weaves into every song. I’d hear Metallica, but underneath, that creepy melody was there, twisting the riffs. I got annoyed, figured it was just an earworm, you know? Like when “Baby Shark” gets stuck in your brain. But this felt… heavier.

By day three, shit got weird. I’m at work, moving boxes, and I notice I’m stacking them in a rhythm. The same rhythm as the tune. My coworker,  he’s like, “Yo, you good? You’re humming that creepy shit all day.” I laughed it off, but I didn’t even realize I was doing it. That night, I’m home, and my dog, Rusty, starts acting up. He’s whining, staring at me, like he’s freaked out. I’m humming again, and he bolts to the corner, tail tucked. I stop, and he calms down. I start again—by accident—and he loses it, barking like I’m a stranger. I shut up quick.

I tried to find the video again. Searched “Listen Once” on YouTube, Google, everywhere. Nothing. Like it never existed. I even checked my browser history—gone. That’s when I started feeling watched, you know? Like something was listening to ME hum the tune. I’d be in my apartment, alone, and hear this faint echo of it, like it was coming from the walls. I’d stop humming, and it’d stop too. But sometimes… it didn’t. One night, I woke up at 3 a.m., pitch black, and the tune was playing. Not in my head—out loud, from my living room. I grabbed my bat, crept out, but nothing was there. No phone, no speakers, just silence when I flipped the light on. My heart was pounding so hard I thought I’d pass out.

Things got worse. I started seeing stuff. Not like monsters or ghosts, but… patterns. The tune was changing things around me. I’d pour coffee, and the steam would swirl in the same rhythm as the melody. The clock in my kitchen—digital, mind you—started ticking in time with it. One night, I’m walking home from a bar, and the streetlights are flickering, matching the beat. I know it sounds crazy, but it’s like the world was syncing up with this damn song.

Then came the voices. Not clear ones, not like “hey , I’m a demon.” Just whispers, mixed into the tune, like they were part of it. I’d hear them when I was alone, saying stuff like “keep going” or “sing it.” I stopped humming after that, clamped my mouth shut, but the tune kept playing in my head, louder, like it was pissed I wouldn’t let it out. I tried earplugs, blasting music, even went to a doctor. He said it was stress, gave me pills. They didn’t do shit. The tune got so loud I couldn’t sleep. I’d lie there, feeling it pulse in my skull, like it was trying to crawl out.

Last week, it took over. I was at the warehouse, and I blacked out. Not like fainting, but like I wasn’t me. My colleaguesaid I was stacking boxes, humming that tune, but my eyes were… wrong. He said they were blank, like I was sleepwalking. I don’t remember any of it. When I “woke up,” I was standing in the break room, holding a box cutter, and Mike was yelling at me to snap out of it. There were scratches on my arms, deep ones, in a pattern that matched the tune’s rhythm. I didn’t do that. I swear I didn’t.

I stopped going to work after that. Locked myself in my apartment, unplugged everything, even taped over my laptop’s webcam. But the tune’s still here. Last night, I saw something in the mirror. Not my reflection—well, it was, but it wasn’t ME. My face was smiling, humming the tune, while I stood there, frozen, not making a sound. The reflection’s mouth moved, and I heard the melody come from it, clear as day. I smashed the mirror, cut my hand bad, but the blood on the floor… it pooled in shapes, like musical notes.

I don’t know what this thing is. It’s not just a song. It’s alive, and it’s using me. I can feel it digging deeper, like it’s rewriting who I am. I’m scared to sleep, scared to leave my place, scared to even think too loud. If I hum it again, I don’t know what’ll happen. Maybe it’ll take me completely. Maybe I’ll end up like that reflection, just a puppet for the tune.

If anyone’s heard this song, or seen that video, please, tell me. I need to know how to stop it. I’m posting this now cause I don’t know how much longer I can fight it. The tune’s playing as I type this, louder than ever, and my fingers are moving to its rhythm. I don’t want to sing. I don’t want to let it out. But it’s so hard to stop.
