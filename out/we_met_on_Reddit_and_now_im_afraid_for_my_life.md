I've (22F) spent the majority of my life alone, I was bullied in high school for being the dirty kid, i was never considered "pretty" by any standards so social media was my social outlet like millions of others , grateful i could be anonymous.

i had joined some groups for friendships and similar intrest of mine, gaming ,cats, anime. I had become friendly with another user that was active in both my friendship and gaming forum! we began DM'ing one evening over a comment that both of us had replied to with strong disagreement. I think it was love at first DM. It started to be a nightly routine innocently talking about common public opions and then divulged into deeper phylisophical discussions over hopes and dreams. with in a month it was becoming clear we should talk on the phone so phone numbers were exchanged. 

Over the next few months i spent every waking moment texting Todd and spending hours on the phone with him. he loved everything i did it was really true love. One Friday evening we were set to talk at 7pm as per our usual agreement,only this evening was to be our first video chat. I had delayed picture exchanges for safety reasons and to be frank i was afraid after he saw me he would cut ties. I couldnt stand that type of rejection. My Todd was really just to perfect for me. Reluctantly after dinner i had cleaned up my table and set up the laptop for our skype. this evening he was either going to decide he was ok with me or ghost me. Here went nothing. Id done my hair and makeup tried for the best lighting i could and started the call. When Todd answered i was swooning he was absolutly gorgeous. Dark hair dark eyes strong jaw. I was melting in my chair, the wonderful smile full of white beamin teeth could make the sun shine on a cloudy day. i felt butterflies in my stomache He was actually smiling at me , i could feel my face turn hot and red from ebaressment, there was no way this Adonis of man was going to want anything to do with this small town girl, but he did. He told me how i was as beutiful as i sounded on the phone, i was everything he dreamed of! it was definatly to good to be true, what was the catch here? did he want money? i actually had made a decent amount of money at my job but he really didnt know about my bank account status. 

Two months passed of our nightly skypes , he didnt ghost me like i had thought! then he asked me what i had been waiting to hear, he wanted to meet me!! could this really be happening to me? could i actually find the Romeo to my Juliette? if i had only listened to the horror stories others had posted about never meeting a stranger online i think my life would probably turned out differnt. I really know now what all those warnings were about, only you sit and think to yourself, Im not that stupid! Id never meet someone without knowing them, right? someone cant hide their true colors for 6 months and over video chat right?

im getting ahead of myself. When Todd asked me to meet i agreed ecstatically. As it turned out we were actually only a few states away from each other here in the US 4 hours by flight! amazing!!! We disscussed plans and details , he would fly here in one month and we would meet on neutral ground for dinner and if things went according to plan he would stay at a hotel for the week, if I became uncomfortable he would cancle his reservation and fly home. Imagine me the the chubby highschool walking target actually having what seemed to be the upper hand here! I agreed i would pick him up from the airport and drive us to the restaraunt, He said he would call around and make our reservations and handle all the planning. he wanted this to be stress free for me. 

the month seemed to drag by, our nightly skype turning into multiple calls throughout the day  planning and gushing about our big day! Part of me understood that meeting a stranger obviously comes with red flags so i opted to confess to my one and only bestfriend Tammy what had been going on. 

Id kept todd a secrect because well i knew she wouldnt approve. Tammy had lots of friends and just wouldnt understand where i was coming from. I was right she had alot to say on the matter but finally agreed she would acompany me on the ride to the airport to meet him and that i would continually check in throughout the date and then again in the morning.

our big day arrived and we meet. It was an absolute fairy tale happening right infront of my eyes, we went to dinner at the finest restaraunt in town ( he even insisted he pay), we went for a walk along the river holding hands all the way to the hotel entrance, we finished what was the perfect evening with the perfect first kiss, my first kiss! nothing was going to ruin my night as i floated home , I called Tammy to let her know i was alright and that he had been the perfect gentleman all evening. she was hesitant to congradulate me, she had the nerve to ask me if trusted this guy. Trust him? i was offended throwing it in her face she was jealous her husband had dumped her and in disbelif someone could actually like my ugly face. 

hindsight being 20/20 i wish id never hung up on her. I ran back to the hotel and up to the front desk , i asked for Todds room at the front desk and approached the door. he answered on the second knock dripping wet from his shower. his abs dripping with soap. I could smell the shampoo from the doorway . I was a virgin (lame i know) but for the first time in my life my labido was RAGING, He was suprised and seemingly happy to see me! i stepped in the door, heart pounding,and kissed him. the adrenaline rush was unreal, the fear and excitement was like none other , passioniatly he kissed me back and we lay on the bed he removed his towel and made passionate love to me right there, i was in an absolute tailspin of emotion and sensation. I spent the night with him making love again and again all the next day into Saturday night. I couldnt even fathom the thought of leaving him not for one second. I should have. 

Sunday morning I woke up alone in the hotel room. his bags were packed and the room was emptied of all his belongings , in a panic i got up and searched the bathroom and room for any hint of where he had gone. my heart was broken, he didnt love me like hed confessed last night , he was ghosting me. I went to pick up my cellphone but it was missing also, had he stolen my phone? or had i left it at home? i dressed and started sobbing. I had opened myself , my soul to this man and he had abandon me. I fought with my only friend over him, i left every instinct i had to meet him, i had given him my viginity, how absolutley gullible i must be . I knew deep down i could never be loved by a man and this had confirmed it, i was absolutley defeated. as i sat half clothed on the side of the bed the door to the room clicked open , I looked up suprised for a split second i thought it was Todd coming back and that id made a mistake! It was him , id misjudged him he had come back! Todd stood in the doorway with a strange look on his face, almost angry. 

"Lets go" was all he said, i didnt understand. "where?" i asked in excited wonderment

" I have a car waiting outside for us, ive planned a very special day !" I wiped my face and followed him down into the lobby where he led me to a dark colored van. It had an advertisement for a car rental company on the side, i truly wish id paid more attention so i could you dear reader, maybe help would come.

As youve probably guessed Todd wasnt who he claimed to be, and ive been taken to an entirely differnt area, deep into the woods, I am dependant on " todd" now to survive and now i couldnt even tell you where i am. why post this on some random sub your asking yourself? because Tammy if your out there, you were right.

shortly after i got in the van Todd punched me so hard i was knocked out for god knows how long when i woke up Todd began peeling off what was his face was actually a 3D printed mask of man named Todd who was actually active in my forums. "Todd" had stolen his identy and was using it to lure desperate women like me. I know cliche. It happens , i know i should have known better , after seeing his real face it was hideous and old, like it had seen some heavy city miles on it , he removed the fake caps of his yellowing cooked teeth, most were missing, he let out a grueling hillbilly laugh as he threw the van into gear. i lay screaming in the back of the van for what felt like days but was probably just hours, it was hot, i was sweating, my throat burned from screaming, Todd just laughed and turned up the radio. 

Like i said i have no idea where I am, i just know Todd is using me , well actually my body he wants a child to call his own and I guess i was the only one dumb enough to belive he actually was real. I spend most days locked in a cement basement with bed and bucket, some days he trusts me enough to go upstairs with him, i only see barred windows and trees out there. 

I know what your thinking. Call for help instead of posting this catfish story, where would i tell them to look for me? i have a laptop from the year 2000 and a wired connection. Besideds , Im far to pregnant to travel.
