On August 12, 2011, Burbank, California was the site of a truly heinous massacre that left 115 people dead and hundreds more injured. The nature of the attacks were particularly brutal, involving six napalm bombings at three distinct locations at 11:30 AM, 11:32 AM, 11:45 AM, two at 12:00 PM, and the final one at 12:07 PM.

The bombs were homemade devices filled with both black powder and a highly flammable petrochemical substance, both of which were placed in three-gallon plastic gas containers. Each one was placed in dense areas within each target to maximize the death toll. All three targets were devastated, but the Nickelodeon building received the greatest damage, with three fifths of the building destroyed. The buildings were rendered uninhabitable by the immense heat and force of the explosions, and while they have since been repaired and remodeled, the damaged portions have been sealed off and turned into memorials.

The bombings at the three locations were massive, brutal, and bloody, but what makes the events truly chilling was that each target was the site of a majority of televised entertainment for children and pre-teens. Specifically, they were the studios of arguably the three most influential kids networks in American history: Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney. Who perpetrated such an unspeakably vicious act against the childhoods of millions of children, and why? It was the final act in a vicious campaign that made August 12th one of the most hated days in popular media, and in the process also became one of the most famous unsolved mysteries in American history.

It all started on a sunny summer day in 2009 when three separate packages arrived on the doorsteps of the Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney studios. They were anonymous packages with no postmarks or return addresses. No one saw them being delivered, and each had only a simple note attached which read “I have created something I love. From me to you, Bad Mouse”. Strange, but the recipients decided to humor the packages anyway, thinking it was fanmail or something of the sort. When they were opened, they revealed several video tapes.

They all had titles hastily scribbled on, “Bad Mouse: Episode 1”, “Bad Mouse: Episode 2”, and so on. There were 13 in total, the last of which had an additional notation reading “This is the last”. As to the contents of the tapes, they contained what everyone assumed to be “Bad Mouse”, who was a mouse sock puppet, complete with two large ears, eyes, and buck teeth all clearly made with paper, but it had arms that were clearly stitched on in post and a cartoony tail that did not match the rest of the sock puppet.

All of the tapes were in black and white, and had very simple premises. In a high-pitched and nasally voice, Bad Mouse talked about numbers, the alphabet, animals, colors, and other really straightforward topics. They were only about four or five minutes long each, with no background music, title cards, or anything. Just Bad Mouse talking.

Nothing was too unusual or frightening about the “show”, so to speak. Clearly, it was done on a very low budget, but what exactly was the point of it? It surely would not entertain anyone over the age of three. Some dismissed it as some kind of stupid prank, while others joked that whoever delivered these tapes to the studios was banking on Bad Mouse being made into an actual show. Unfortunately, that was not how it worked, and after all the episodes were viewed and everyone got a good laugh at someone’s pitiful attempt at stardom, the episodes were all dismissed and promptly canned, though there were some who found Bad Mouse to be unsettling and creepy, but they would never bring that up in front of their colleagues.

That was supposed to be the end of it, but just one week later, more packages arrived, with the note now reading “From me to you, Bad Mouse”, the “I have something I love” being notably omitted. Inside the packages were 13 tapes, just like last time, and when everyone gathered to watch them, they were actually surprised. While each episode was about the same length as before, the show actually had color, plots, music, title cards, more sock puppet characters, and environments, though it was still clearly made on the smallest ounce of a budget.

The visuals and effects were shoddy at best, whoever was voicing Bad Mouse clearly voiced the other sock puppet characters, there was a strange hum of static in the background, and occasionally a loud beeping noise came from out of nowhere and bloodied the ears of all who heard it. Needless to say, it was not nearly enough to convince the executives to even fathom the idea of greenlighting it, and Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network all tossed the tapes into the garbage.

“Bad Mouse is getting desperate!” a Nickelodeon executive quipped after sipping his coffee.

Was that the end of it? Everyone thought so until another week had passed and three more packages just bearing the words “Bad Mouse” arrived at each studio, and all three went straight to the trash can. However, a curious Cartoon Network intern secretly fished their package out of the trash. He had heard of Bad Mouse’s depravity from his colleagues, and as an avid collector of lost and unknown media on the side, this would be absolutely perfect for him. He took the tapes home and immediately popped them into his old VCR.

Judging by the small increase in quality in the second round of packages, the intern assumed that whoever was behind Bad Mouse had finally learned their lesson, but each tape showed a disturbing clip of the same thing: no color, no plots, no music, no title cards, no other characters, and no environments…just Bad Mouse sitting motionless and staring straight at the camera. Every thirty seconds or so, the sock puppet would say the words “Getting desperate”, but only in syllables:

”Get…ting…des…per…ate”.

The intern did not scare too easily, and he did not think much of it other than it being pretty odd. Shrugging, he popped the tapes out of the old VCR, placed them with his other tapes and DVDs he had acquired throughout the years, and went to bed.

No more packages showed up after that. No more tapes. No more Bad Mouse. The whole ordeal seemed to be over…and it was. Until about a year later, when Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network’s channels were all hijacked.

By this point, everyone had basically forgotten about Bad Mouse. It was now just a fleeting memory of some desperate and depraved soul thinking they would make it big, something to bring up if you wanted to point and laugh. But the first signs of trouble were on Nickelodeon, specifically Nick Jr.

The characters Moose and Zee had in-between blocks where they provided information and education between shows. On the morning of July 12, 2010, a segment where Moose was supposed to teach the audience about names was hijacked by none other than Bad Mouse. In the middle of speaking, Moose went frozen and silent, the music cut out, and the screen glitched until Bad Mouse was there for the entire world to see.

The sock puppet just stared at the audience with text appearing beneath it. Whoever was hijacking Nick Jr’s broadcast seemed very immature, writing things such as “lol”, “d00d”, “haha i’m a mouse”, “i’m hungry”, “candy”, “i’m gonna go watch dora”, etc. It was childish and idiotic, but it was still unsettling for some.

The network executives were too embarrassed to simply power down the channel over what was definitely a stupid prank. They thought just slapping the technical difficulties screen on it would do the trick every time, but that did not stop Bad Mouse. For the next two weeks, all the shows on air were cut off and the broadcasts became a mess, with their schedules mixed up, characters being brought on in the middle of shows they had no business being in, and other messes.

Sometimes Bad Mouse would return, just spouting nonsense on screen like “lol”, “bobo”, “is attention”, “wat”, “bad”, “huh?”, “mouse”, “ya”, etc. It also began to bleed into the Disney Channel and Cartoon Network. Calls were made by angry parents and their confused children, and each channel promised to resolve the issues, but they never could. As aforementioned, the hijackings were very childish, and while all three channels were determined to solve the issues, in the grand scheme of things, no one took them that seriously. They came off as more annoying than anything.

Soon, the internet was filled with rumors and speculation. Everyone was curious about the problems their children’s channels were having. There were still people assuming it was just a very clever prank and was the work of people who had nothing better to do but get a rise out of these channels and their viewers.

Others had…darker theories, many of them poked and made fun of for being just as stupid as Bad Mouse itself, ranging from Bad Mouse being the work of a disgruntled employee, an artificial intelligence, a paranormal phenomenon, aliens, or some kind of supernatural or superhuman entity. In today’s world, we are all pretty cynical, and seem to disregard more dramatic notions because it does not align with our short-ordered view of reality.

Despite the many rumors, as July came to a close, things seemed to be getting better. By then, the executives at Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney had found a way to block out all the messaging and instead broadcast a continuous feed of static for the channels until they could figure out the issue. As a result, the hijackings had slowed down significantly.

By September 1st, there was no more messaging at all, so it seemed that Bad Mouse had simply moved on to other things. Everyone was relieved, but there was still the occasional hushed murmur that whoever was behind these hijackings would be back, because clearly, Bad Mouse seemed like a persistent weirdo. Some even went so far as to say that Bad Mouse would bring violence with it, which was laughed off as completely and utterly ridiculous.

How very wrong those people were.

For a long time, there was nothing, like before. All of it was the calm before the storm, and boy, did it storm. 2011 was coming and going with nothing unusual happening. SpongeBob cooked Krabby Patties, Mickey Mouse took us on adventures around his clubhouse, and The Amazing World of Gumball was premiering its first season to massive success. Even the once active internet forums were completely empty, with Bad Mouse just being touted as a fun, if bizarre, little piece of lost media that was stuck in the past. All was well until the summer arrived…

There were 13 hijackings in total. All three networks were affected. They were horrific, bizarre, terrifying, and utterly disturbing, and each one worse than the last. Each one lasted anywhere from 15 minutes to a full hour, depending on the severity. Beginning the same way, either flickering, frames repeating themselves, sound not syncing up, waving and jittering, or random pauses, something would always happen. Sometimes the screens would be replaced with deeply disturbing edits of whatever character was on screen, often making them appear angry at the audience.

Sometimes, the screen would fade into bloodied static for a few moments, then go right back to normal programming. Sometimes random images and videos would flash on the screen, such as a pictures of the White House on fire, footage of mice, someone walking outside at night, and random YouTube videos, but there was also disturbing imagery of people being tortured, mutilated, beheaded, people being shot at point-blank range, and even footage of horrific events throughout history, such as the Holocaust, Waco, the Oklahoma City bombing, etc. Sometimes, an extremely loud beeping sound would bloody the ears of all who heard it (not unlike what was head in the first Bad Mouse video tapes). Sometimes vague or threatening messages were displayed such as:

“i’m here”’

“is it getting desperate?”

“i hate you all”

“i have to get attention”

“i’m desperate!”

“you love me, but I don’t love you”

“bad mouse is getting desperate!”

“i’m going to show you the world”

“bad mouse is getting worse!”

“me me me me me me”

“attention”

Some even claimed to see images of Bad Mouse himself in the background of scenes of terror and bloodshed, though those were usually not very clear. Occasionally, a clip of Bad Mouse would be shown and then just disappear. All of this was absolutely chilling, especially considering it was shown to young children, but it was far from over. During a hijacking of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on the morning of July 25, a message from Bad Mouse claimed that August 12 would be “death day”. Everyone’s blood ran cold. What did Bad Mouse mean? No one could know, but the message was already out there, so everyone braced for the worst.

Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all in a panic. They cut all broadcasts, including off-air and live shows, and immediately called up their network technicians. To everyone’s horror, the technicians were unable to locate the origin of the hijackings. They could find no source, no one was even able to log in to the programming or mess with the technical equipment, and no technician was able to determine the cause. There was no foreign software or anything of the sort.

Security cameras showed no suspicious activity. Arguments ensued, fingers were pointed, hardworking employees were fired without warning, and the situation looked grimmer and grimmer. This was an all-out war, and no one knew why it was happening or how to stop it.

By August, the situation had spiraled out of control. It was no longer just a technical issue, but an outright attack on the three major children’s networks. The situation spiraled into full chaos, with Bad Mouse still unstoppable and the networks still in chaos. By now, all the technicians who were responsible for maintaining these networks and getting them up and running had been fired, leaving all the channel’s executives at a loss of what to do. All they could do was wait and see.

On August 12, the atmospheres at the three studios were tense. They made the conscious decision to stay open, not wishing to appear weak or stupid, and wanting to show Bad Mouse that they were not afraid of it. Their broadcasts of beloved children’s shows began as normal. For a while, everything actually seemed relatively normal. No hijackings happened yet, but just as everyone at the studios were beginning to think that they might be okay, the bombings happened, resulting in a massacre of unimaginable brutality, a tragedy of such a scale that the world would never be the same again.

The perpetrator behind Bad Mouse is a mystery. No suspects or leads were ever found. Clearly, they were a lunatic with an insane dream that they wanted to see realized, who wanted to make a big impact on the world. All three studios were devastated, and all children’s shows were canceled as a result. Cartoon Network, Disney, and Nickelodeon all closed for months after the incident and are still getting back on their feet today. As time went on, people began to wonder why the networks would never make a statement on the incident.

Many thought that maybe it would scare children away, but there’s more to it than that. Cartoon Network, Disney, and Nickelodeon executives were all interviewed by the press, but they were extremely vague, simply saying that they were still working on “a little something” to pay their respects to the victims and they never commented on Bad Mouse itself.

But the scars still exist. Bad Mouse is still burned into the minds of those who lived through it, and many are too afraid to talk about it or discuss the memories they have, but a few brave souls have come forward. The Nickelodeon intern, while unable to remember the specifics of what happened, still remembers the tapes he fished out of the trash can, but he swears he threw them out the moment he realized he had made a terrible mistake.

He was convinced that whoever was behind the tapes knew something, but after seeing how violent and desperate the hijackings were, he knew that the tapes had to be destroyed, and promptly did so.

No one knows who Bad Mouse really is, and no one ever will. People have wanted to know more about the perpetrator of such a heinous crime. Why was it targeting these studios? Why did it want to get kids’ shows off the air? Why did it care about attention? What does “getting desperate” mean? Why do all these images of Bad Mouse keep showing up all over the place?

For now, these questions will remain unanswered. All we know is that a disturbed and depraved mind exists somewhere in the world, and for that, the world is an ever scarier and darker place.
