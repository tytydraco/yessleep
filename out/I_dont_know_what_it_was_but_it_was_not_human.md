I slipped out of my clothes I wore on the plane ride and put on my comfy stitch pajamas. I sluggishly drifted over to my bed and tucked myself under my covers. As I began to fall asleep, I heard something from the other side of my room. I thought it was my overactive imagination beginning to stir as I became drowsy. A shadow crept its way across the length of my window followed by a long screech that felt as though it shook the entire house along with me. I squeezed my eyes closed tight hoping it was just the summer winds shaking a tree branch, but I knew it was real. I knew something was out there. 


I woke up sometime later to a sudden creak from what sounded like the old hardwood floors. I felt something lurk closer to me. I flipped over in my bed to face the presence thinking it was my mom or dad coming to check on me. It was odd. A “human” stood in front of me but I knew it was not human. The built up scream pressed hard against the back of my eyes. I choked down the scream, maybe it wouldn’t know I was here if I was silent. Something about it was off. It’s eyes were too shallow, its face was sunken in. It’s skin was too pale, like they’d never gone outside. I could see its long legs, that were human like, but at the knee, it bent the tiniest bit the wrong way. I saw its mouth, it curled into a sinister grin that reminded me of the joker. It crept closer as I tried to shut my eyes. “It’s a dream!” I told myself. It inched closer. It’s mouth opened to utter words. I saw it’s curly tongue stretch along it’s mouth. 


“Hello” It oozed out of its mouth. The voice was the same. Inhuman and human at the same time. It was dark and rich but there was a tip of bloodlust and anger. It sounded like black sludge dripping from a crispy apple. I tried to scream but I was too scared. I clasped my hands over my mouth and shoved my head under my pillow. 


I waited what felt like years with my head buried between the bed and my pillow. I could see a tiny crack of light seeping into my room. I gained the confidence to peak out of my pillow. It was gone. I could not move from my spot for hours. Even when my parents came to make sure I was okay I could not speak. I am not sure what it was, or why this sudden memory rushed back to me in full vivid color, but I do know what I saw was something that was not human. I am terrified that it never really left and is watching me from afar. I can sense something watching me. It’s presence was there, but I never saw it. Just like that night but much, much worse…
