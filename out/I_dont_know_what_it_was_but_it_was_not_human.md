It all started on June 15th 2012. I was 5. 

I slipped out of my clothes I wore on the plane ride and put on my comfy stitch pajamas. I sluggishly drifted over to my bed and tucked myself under my covers. As I began to fall asleep, I heard something from the other side of my room. I thought it was my overactive imagination beginning to stir as I became drowsy. A shadow crept its way across the length of my window, followed by a long screech that felt as though it shook the entire house along with me. I squeezed my eyes closed tight hoping it was just the summer winds shaking a tree branch, but I knew it was real. I knew something was out there. 


I woke up sometime later to a sudden creak from what sounded like the old hardwood floors. I felt something lurk closer to me. I flipped over in my bed to face the presence thinking it was my mom or dad coming to check on me. It was odd. A “human” stood in front of me but I knew it was not human. The built up scream pressed hard against the back of my eyes. I choked down the scream, maybe it wouldn’t know I was here if I was silent. Something about it was off. It’s eyes were too shallow, its face was sunken in. It’s skin was too pale, like they’d never gone outside. I could see its long legs, that were human like, but at the knee, it bent the tiniest bit the wrong way. I saw its mouth, it curled into a sinister grin that reminded me of the joker. It crept closer as I tried to shut my eyes. “It’s a dream!” I told myself. It inched closer. It’s mouth opened to utter words. I saw it’s curly tongue stretch along it’s mouth. 


“Hello” It oozed out of its mouth. The voice was the same. Inhuman and human at the same time. It was dark and rich but there was a tip of bloodlust and anger. It sounded like black sludge dripping from a crispy apple. I tried to scream but I was too scared. I clasped my hands over my mouth and shoved my head under my pillow. 


I waited what felt like years with my head buried between the bed and my pillow. I could see a tiny crack of light seeping into my room. I gained the confidence to peak out of my pillow. It was gone. I could not move from my spot for hours. Even when my parents came to make sure I was okay, I could not speak. 

After a few hours, I felt a sharp pain of hunger hit me. I knew I had to get up now. I convinced myself it was okay. It was gone now. I pushed myself out of bed and down the hall to the kitchen. I felt, while I was walking, that something was watching me. I could see black figures out of the corner of my eye. I held my arms close to myself and ran down the hall to the brightly lit kitchen. I finally ate enough food to last me days if I just stayed in my bed. I ran back, slipped into my bed again and wrapped myself up. Rule number 1, if you’re being stalked, they can’t get you under the covers.

I woke up later, it was pitch black out. I opened my eyes groggily and saw it. It was standing in the corner of the room, watching. Its neck was cocked like a dog hearing a loud noise. I stared at it, it seemed even more human. It’s face was less sunken in and its smile was less curled. But I knew it still wasn’t human. Its eyes were still dead and its skin was as pale as the moons glow. I couldn’t move, scream, nothing. I just sat there not knowing what to do. It quickly cocked its head back into a “normal” position and stepped closer to me. My room wasn’t that big. A 15x15 at best. It standing in the corner was only around 8 feet away from me. With its long legs, it took 4 steps to be right at the edge of my bed. This time it didn’t open its mouth to say hello. It just stood, staring. I couldn’t figure out anything by looking at its eyes. They were dead, nothing happening behind them. No calculating, no figuring out the best way to attack. I again decided to retreat to under my pillow and wait it out.

I slept the whole next day, when I woke up the sun was just setting. I decided not to get up. I wasn’t hungry. I sat in my bed hoping it didn’t come back tonight. I drifted back to sleep.

I woke again to a cracking noise. I looked up and again, it stood in the corner peering at me. Its neck was bent in strange ways and I could see its face. I think it realized I was awake now, since it bent its neck back into an upright position. I wanted to scream now. I didn’t know if it was “it” anymore. I looked too human. It’s eyes were the only thing that weren’t “alive” It began walking over to me. I could hear the shuffling of shoes on the floor. I could see its “human” mouth open, it still had the long curled tongue. I watched, for the third night, as it came close to my bed. This time was different though. I could feel it’s hot breath on my face. It spoke again. “Hello…” This time the voice was human. Really human. It had emotion. Emotions of anger. Rage. I could see it eyes widen and it’s smile curl again. “Come…With me.” It reached its hand out and waited for me. I touched it hand, my hands shaking. I touched its cold hands. I looked up and it smiled again, its lips were pursed. It let my hand go. And just as fast as I appeared, I watched it vanish. Memories of death rushed into my head. I could see bodies surrounding me. I shook my head to get the memories out. But they continued. I waited as the memories dissipated and I saw it. It was standing in the middle of the bodies. It held up a sign that read “Thank you. Now I can rest. I could not with these memories. Please. Stay safe. The memories will be passed to the next person you touch.” I was horrified. I just stayed in bed, not knowing what to do. 

Now, I’m 16. I have not touched another person in 11 years. My parents didn’t understand at first but they ended up leaving me be. I’d throw a tantrum anytime the tried to touch me. They think I don’t love them. I just don’t want this to be put onto someone else. I’m worried it will come back, not for me but for the person with the memories. As long as I don’t touch anyone, it’ll all be okay…I assume. I was too young to question what this was, but I was glad it was gone. To this day, I’m still not sure what it was, but it was not human.
