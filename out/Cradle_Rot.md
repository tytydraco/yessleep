I see him only at night.

At first, it was just glimpses– Flickering lights, soft thuds, little things going missing. Things that you didn't really notice right away. Not until you needed them, and they were just...gone.

Or when you realize that neither of your neighbors owned any pets that could make those running, thudding sounds.

He makes me feel small and uneasy.

Sometimes he just stares at me from the edge of the bed. Other times, I wake to the feeling of something grabbing at my feet.

Yet, Last night, he left me a gift for the first time in months.

A  box–Huge, wrapped in silky yellow fabric and tied with a teal ribbon around it before meeting at the top with a pink bow that stood tall and proud.

I didn't want to open it.

I really didn't.

Yet I felt so compelled. Before making a choice, my hands were already pulling at the teal ribbon and pink bow to get it off, lifting the lid to peer inside.

Only to find...Another box. This time it was smaller and a deeper blue, a soft pink ribbon wrapped around it snugly.

Again, I go for it, pulling at the ribbon so I can open the box and free what was inside. This time, instead of another box, small pieces of wrapped candies layered the bottom of the box with a crumpled note atop them.

"You always remember me when you’re sad.

That’s okay.

I remember you all the time."

As I reached in, my fingers brushed against the candies– They were sticky, like someone had sucked on them before wrapping them up again.

The paper crumpled under my touch, damp and warm, clinging to my skin as I picked it up.

The note itself was written in big, looping letters, almost childlike–some of the letters smudged, the ink running in places, like it had been held too long in sweaty hands.  It was like whoever wrote it was too excited to be careful.

The note slipped from my fingers, landing among the candies with a soft papery sigh.

It felt like an eternity. I just sat there, staring into the box. Feeling the weight of his words settle over me like a blanket I couldn't pull off.

The house felt colder somehow.

Heavier.

In the silence, I heard it. A soft crinkling of candy wrappers from somewhere deeper into the house.

I wasn't alone, was I?

I don't know if I ever truly was.

# Act 2: The Descent   

It had been months since I'd seen anyone really.

So when Becca texted– "Are you alive? Let's do coffee this week." –It felt like a hand reaching down into a dark well.

I said yes.

I don't know why I did.

We met at a little diner we used to haunt in college, back when life wasn't as stressful or paranoid.

Becca looked the same. Bright eyes, nervous energy, a purse full of receipts, and half-melted lip balm.

I must've looked a little bit different, her smile faltered the second she got a glimpse of me.

"You look..." She started, then seemed to think about her words, "Tired."

I shrugged at her comment and mumbled something about my job.

Small talk filled the first few minutes– work, weather, some story about her dog chewing through a bag of flour.

I nodded and smiled at the right places, but it was like chewing cotton balls that were stuck in my throat.

Finally, Becca leaned forward, her voice lowered.

"I was worried about you, you know.. You went totally dark. No texts, no calls. We thought..." She trailed off with a saddened look in her eyes.

*We thought you were dead*

She didn't have to say it, I could sense what she wanted to say from a mile away.

The coffee in my cup had gone cold.

I had wrapped my hands around it anyway, grounding myself in a small, simple discomfort.

"I think something's wrong with my house.." I told her.

The words slipped out before I could catch them. My throat felt dry and I wanted to cry.

Becca only blinked, "..Wrong how..?"

I spilled. I told her about the missing things, the noises at night. Even the gift box was left for me..

I didn't tell her everything– not about the sticky candies or the note– but enough so she understood.

Enough to even get her eyebrows to knit together in concern.

At first, I thought she believed me.

Relief flooded me so fast I almost cried right there on the spot. But then she said, carefully, mind you, like she was handling a wild animal:

"You know...after trauma, it's really common to have, like...weird perceptions. Disassociation. Manifesting things that aren't...*there*"

I stared at her.

"You've been alone a lot," she pressed on gently, "It messes with your brain. Makes you see patterns that don't exist..hear things. It's totally normal. You just need support. Therapy, maybe meds?" She smiled, like she had just solved the world's hardest problem.

Like this was a puzzle, and not my life unraveling at the seams.

The walls of the diner felt like they were pressing closer. My hands were shaking, so I jammed them together on top of the table.

Becca only reached out and patted my hand.

"It'll get better, you just have to want it to."



The diner door clanged shut behind me, but the noise barely registered. The cold air hit my face, I didn't even bother zipping up my jacket. Becca meant well, I knew that. She always did.

But her words–*Trauma response, therapy, meds*— Buzzed around my head like angry wasps.

I wanted to believe she was right.

I wanted to believe it was just my brain misfiring.

Grief, loneliness, confusion. Something I COULD fix, but deep down I knew better.  Something was there inside that house. MY house. You can't fix something that's already inside the walls or floorboards.

I barely made it home before I felt it– A shift.

That subtle wrongness in the air, like walking into a room when someone had been laughing one second, and now they're just staring at you with a blank expression. That dropping feeling of loneliness.

There was something waiting for me on my doorstep as I pulled up, something wrapped in cheap, glittery tissue paper and damp from the morning mist.

I picked it up and pushed aside the tissue paper; inside was a framed photo.

An old one at that– Becca and I, arms slung around each other, and we were smiling. It would have made me smile if it wasn't for the fact that her face was scribbled over with Sharpie as if she were just another void.

Below the picture fell another sloppily written note, the paper damp between my fingers.

*"I’m the reason you made it this far. Don’t forget that "*

The frame I held in my hands dropped and fell against the concrete, splintering and shattering the frame with a sharp ***pop*** .

From somewhere in the house, through the open door, I heard it. A soft rustle. The sticky *Pat-pat-Pat* of something small and heavy shifting in the unlit house.

Closer.

Waiting.

I picked up the broken frame and shoved it back into the box, leaving behind small shards of splintered wood and glass. I hurried into the house and shut the door behind me, slamming it closed and locking it immediately.

The house didn't feel safer, it felt smaller and...smelled sweeter like pure raw sugar was being boiled with a semi-sweet smell, but soon close to burning. The after smell hit , as if something was rotting behind the wall of sugar.

I sank to the couch, curling into myself and holding my breath until my lungs burned.

"*hushhhh, Hushhhhh, Don't fret over someone like Becca..*"And for the first time, I didn't argue. I just accepted it.

# Act 3: Surrender

The house feels different now.

Brighter somehow.

Warmer.

The walls that were once dull and cracked seemed to shimmer faintly– Like they've been scrubbed and freshly washed and shone with a candy-floss light.

I know it's not. real. I think I do at least, but sometimes the colors pulse when I blink too fast. Sometimes the floor feels too soft under my feet as if I'm stepping on layers of chewed-up gum.

But it's better than the emptiness. Better than the cold, quiet ache that used to sit heavy in my chest when I woke up feeling ready to jump in traffic or put glass in my morning breakfast.

Now? I wake up to the smell of sugar, sometimes burnt. Other times there's little gifts waiting for me–

A handful of chalky candy hearts were left on my pillow, or ribbons were tied to my door handles throughout the house.

Sometimes I hear humming around the house, the same broken tune repeating over and over and over.

At this point, it should scare me, at least, as it used to. Now, it's almost ....soothing.

I don't leave the house much anymore, the outside world feels too loud and bright. Every conversation is a jagged reminder that I'm not really part of it. Friends or family have reached out, it's an obvious sign that I'm not wanted.

At least here, the walls are soft, the lights are gentle. The little creature lingering amongst the house still has yet to reveal himself fully, but I don't mind. I know I'm not alone. Nor does he pressure me into anything.

He just waits.

Patiently and smiling.

Tonight there's something new waiting in the living room, I see it after emerging from my room with the same clothes I've been wearing for a few weeks now.

It's another box, it's bigger than the others– Waist high, wrapped in faded red fabric and tied with a thick, fraying rope instead of ribbon.

No card.

No message.

Seeing this, I feel a twinge of worry, as if I've driven away the only thing that was actively wanting to be my friend.

All that was there was a soft, almost hungry creaking sound coming from inside it.

I don't know why my hands are shaking, or why part of me wants to run.

Instead, I kneel down in front of the box, the ribbon sliding off in a slow, silken sigh.  The lid peels back with a soft pop of suction.

Inside is something Gentle and loving... like a warm hug from a mother.

A Stuffed Animal. A pink bear with stripey legs and arms of yellow, purple, and blue. a cream colored face like those rushton dolls from the 20s, an eyepatch on its left eye and a button eye on the right. It had little cute boots that were brown with golden buckles, it looked warm and inviting. As if I could sleep forever, finally.

I sigh and look him over, he's sewn from soft, faded fabrics and stitched together with thread that's fraying at the seams.

The sewn smile on his muzzle looks too tight, pulling the fabric of his face into something that looks like it's in pain.

When I touch him, he's warm. Not like a toy warmed by the sun– but a human body warm. Soft and slow, it felt as if it was breathing between my fingertips.

I hug it close and sigh.

I lift him above my head, the stitched paws dangle limply, head tilting to one side as if he's too tired to hold himself up.  Up close, I can see the seams better–Uneven, desperate stitches crisscrossing the fabric, like someone had to keep fixing him over and over.

He smells faintly of spun sugar and something else underneath–something metallic or sour.

I could drop him. Grip him tightly or see how much I can stretch his arms out before they rip with each popping seam.

The calls stopped first, then the knocks.

I don't know how long it's been since I last opened the door, but the light outside feels too sharp now. Too much.

In here it smells like spun sugar and caramel, something deeper, heavier, and souring slowly in the walls.

*He* says that's normal.

"Y*ou're just getting sweeter!*" He purrs in my ear when the headaches start, when the walls throb and shift in my vision.

# Act 4: The World Knocking

(Becca)

When the landlord called me, I knew it was bad.

I just didn't know how bad.

"Eviction notice," He grumbled over the phone, "Rent's months overdue. Place smells like shit and death. I'm not going back there. If you wanna check on your friend, then be my guest."

I didn't even hang up properly, just stayed on the phone like a dead fish before he clicked the phone, and the line went dead.

I just drove, the world feeling like a blur as I showed up.

The apartment building looks the same from the outside–cracked stucco, sagging flowerbeds, a million small pieces of neglect.

Going through the building and up to the second floor, the smell hit me.

It wasn't just a rotting smell; something sickly-sweet lingered underneath.

Like burnt candy and spoiled milk, thick enough to coat my tongue and make me gag. I covered my nose and mouth with my t-shirt, banging on the door until my hand was sore.

"Please," I begged and pressed my forehead against the door, "Please just let me in. We gotta talk!"

No answer.

Only a soft rustling from inside, like something shifting, something dragging itself across the floor.

Furrowing my eyebrows, I jiggled the doorknob. Locked...Of course.

The frame was old, at least, warped from years of cheap construction and cheaper repairs. I threw my shoulder into it once– twice–and the lock splintered with a cheap crack.

The door swung inward into a house of sickness.

The carpet squelched under my shoes, sticky dark patches soaked through with sugar and worse things. The walls were draped in faded curtains, sagging with moisture.

Every surface was littered with candy wrappers–melted, blackened, fused into the furniture like a wax sculpture.

And in the center of the living room, lying sprawled against the floorboards was...her.

Or what was left. Her skin was gone, peeled away cleanly, almost surgically. Leaving behind glistening red muscle shining in the dim light.

Her body was open–split and torn open down the middle from her breastbone to her navel, inside where her organs should have been, spilled treats. Candies and goodies, caramel ropes that glistened, licorice soaked with her fluids, and sugar pearls spilling out like a piñata.

I stumbled backwards, bile rising in my throat.

Tucked gently against her hollowed chest was a stuffed bear, candy-striped and stitched to look as if it were smiling.

He just sat there, slumped and empty, like a toy no one *needed* anymore.

I tried not to puke as I stared, bugs already eating away at her like a human buffet. Flies are already laying their eggs deep beneath the shredded muscle, white larvae wriggling in the crevices of her limp body.

—

I don't remember running down the stairs or hitting the sidewalk. Or even throwing up behind the dumpster in the alley of the apartments. The 911 call was a blur, though the blood smeared on my shoes made it look like I was a guilty suspect.

I just remember the air as I left, how sweet it still smelled and clinging to my clothes, even after i got outside.

The police arrived in a few cars, lights flashing and boots hitting the cement as they got out of the vehicles. It was midday, so the sun was still high in the sky, beating down upon the onlookers who were watching from behind the tape, and some even trying to get closer as cops shooed them away. No sirens blared, just the flashing lights that pulsed and made my eyes queasy. Soon, the ambulance arrived on the scene with flashing lights as paramedics rushed out of the truck. It felt like a blur or even dissociation as a paramedic came up to talk to me, wrapping something around me as I sat there on the curb, my hands shaking as I held the foil blanket closer.  I watched from the curb, shivering and rocking slightly while the sound of their radios blended into a single buzzing tone.

They broke through the apartment, hearing some gag in surprise before using their buzzing radios to call for backup.

One of the cops tried to talk with me after the paramedic did, his voice bouncing around in my head, and I tried focusing, but I couldn't register what he was saying exactly.

I sat there with the paramedics

"*overdose maybe..? Meth lab, or bath salts. Jesus...what a mess.*"

They didn't look at her like a victim, but a headline. A cautionary tale. They didn't see the melted wrappers or smell the rot under the sugar.

I don't even understand what happened in that apartment. Did they even know about what happened?

I looked towards the building doors, wide open like a gaping mouth. Cops moved in and out, and the coroner arrived on the scene. Some took photos, some just stood there with their hands over their faces, trying not to be sick. An investigator was bouncing around, asking questions, scribbling a few things down as he tried getting as much info as he could before he made his way towards me and handed me his card.

*“If you ever need anything to talk, kid, just call that number. We’ll figure this out.”* And with that he was gone before I could say another word.

With a sigh, I pressed my head against my hands, I caught bits and pieces of their conversation.

*"Jesus Christ...what the hell even is this?"*

*"sugared over...like some kind of–I don't even know. Ritual thing?"*

*"Wasn't there a few cases like this back in '66?"*

The older of the two cops grimaced, lighting a cigarette and popping it in his mouth with a deep inhale while his partner looked confused.

"*Which ones?*"

*"A couple of cases, ranging from kids to young adults…but they died similarly. No skin, I think, I remember readin' em"*

I pressed my forehead harder against the window, the glass cool against my skin, but not enough.

Nothing was enough to pull the smell out of my nostrils, the sticky feeling from my hands lingering.

The radio squawked again, voices overlapping, but all I heard was the old cop mutter something under his breath as he crushed the cigarette underneath his boot.

**BREAKING NEWS: GRUESOME DISCOVERY IN RUNDOWN APARTMENTS**

*"Police have concluded their investigation into a disturbing case at the Maplewood apartments earlier this week, where the body of 22-year-old Molly Tate was discovered in what authorities initially described as 'unusual and ritualistic circumstances'. The victim was found deceased in her home, surrounded by insects, candy that the police suspect as drugs, and other materials. Police reports cite extreme decomposition and mutilation, leading investigators to initially suspect drug-related psychosis or cult involvement."*

*"The unnamed witness, a long-time friend of the deceased, was taken into custody at the scene for questioning. Sources say inconsistencies in her statement and past behavioral concerns flagged her for further investigation. However, no formal charges have been filed at this time.*

*Authorities note a strange connection to several unsolved cases from the 1960s where victims were found under eerily similar circumstances–homes invaded internally and bodies skinned and mutilated. Police emphasize there is no ongoing threat to the public at this time, and the cause of death remains officially listed as 'undetermined'.*

*In other news, city officials remind residents that the Annual Harvest Festival is this weekend. Stay Safe and enjoy the festivities!"*

I turned off the TV, the apartment was quiet except for the soft, almost imperceptible sound of something crinkling under my bed.
