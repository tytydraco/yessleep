Everyone knows about Santa’s first pass: he gobbles up milk and cookies and leaves toys for good little girls and boys. But on the night of Christmas, Santa stops at Clearview a second time—and it never ends well.

Perhaps he has to let off some steam after all that hard work. Or perhaps there is a price to pay for the millions of gifts—and one unlucky resident of my little town has to pay it.

Reveling in the joy of the holiday, stuffed with food and often a little drunk, the residents of Clearview don’t pay much mind to the second advent of the jolly fat man. And unless you’ve done something *very naughty*, Santa will pass your house by, and the holidays will continue uninterrupted.

And while I never transgressed to the point of instigating a second visit from Mr. Claus, my friend did—and I was sleeping over at his house.

Jeremy was a good friend of mine through junior high and into the early years of high school. We played on the same tennis team, and often visited each other’s houses for endless hours of video gaming and movie marathons.

That Christmas, Jeremy got the brand new “Wii” and we were both eager to play it. So, after the Christmas festivities at my house died down, I walked over to Jeremy’s with my sleeping bag and pillow, and we got to it. We played for hours, burning through bags of chips and cans of soda, until finally, his mom told us it was time to go to bed.

It must have been around eleven.

I unrolled my sleeping bag beside his bed, and Jeremy turned out the lights.

We talked for a little while about the games we had played, and plans for starting up again first thing in the morning, until Jeremy struck a more serious tone.

“Hey Eliot… What kind of stuff do you think you need to do for Santa to visit on Christmas night?”

I turned over, trying to read his face in the darkness.

“I don’t know. I think the guy last year pushed an old lady down a flight of stairs.”

“Alright… cool.”

An uncomfortable silence settled over us.

“Why do you ask?”

Jeremy let out a long sigh.

“You remember the wasp prank?”

Everyone in Clearview remembered the wasp prank. Someone stuck a wasp nest in a jar and threw it through an open window at the High School. It would have been funny if not for the girl who had a serious allergy. She made it through, but only after a week in the hospital.

“That was you?” I asked.

“Yeah…”

“Oh.”

I wanted to say something encouraging, but a pit was forming in my stomach. Suddenly, I didn’t want to be in the same room as Jeremy on Christmas night.

Jeremy must have been less worried than I was, because he was snoring within minutes. I was wide awake, staring at the red numbers on his digital clock.

*11:35*

I had assured myself that nothing was going to happen. Surely someone had done something worse. My eyes were finally closed, my mind drifting when I heard them.

Sleigh bells.

They were faint, but I held my breath as they grew louder and louder. I sat up and scanned the room, wondering if I should make a run for it or hide somewhere. Jeremy still snored away on his bed. Should I wake him?

There was a light *thud* on the roof overhead, and the ringing stopped.

My heart was pounding. He was definitely here. Santa was coming.

I jumped to my feet. *Run*. I would run.

But turning to the door, I froze.

There in the open doorway stood Santa.

He looked just like he is portrayed in all the movies. White hair, white beard, red suit, white trim—but he was thinner than I’d expected.

I couldn’t make out his face in the darkness. But I could feel his eyes on me. They weighed me down like a lead blanket.

He raised his gloved hand and snapped his fingers. A string of multicolored Christmas lights wrapped around my body. I opened my mouth to scream, but a fuzzy stocking sprang from Santa’s suit and jammed itself halfway down my throat. I fell over, writhing… gagging.

But then another surprise.

The more I struggled against my restraints, the brighter the lights shone. And as they got brighter, they got hotter.

Soon, the dozens of colorful bulbs were burning blackened holes through my pajamas, searing into my skin. I forced myself to remain still, and the lights dimmed.

Santa picked me up with one hand and hung me from the curtain rod on the wall, giving me an unobstructed view of what happened next.

During the commotion, Jeremy had woken up. He sat bolt upright in bed, eyes wide, trembling.

Jeremy opened his mouth, but Santa covered it with his massive gloved hand.

In a flash, Santa had pinned Jeremy down on the bed. His left hand covered Jeremy’s entire face, muffling his screams, while his right hand reached for something on his belt.

The sting of lights binding me shone onto Santa’s face, revealing a wide grin behind his white beard and bloodshot eyes behind his silver spectacles. Those eyes... they were hungry.

Santa raised a large candy cane over his head and thrust it into Jeremy’s chest.

Jeremy writhed in pain as the red and white spiral sunk deeper into his flesh.

Santa bent over, tilting his head, and put his mouth around the other end of the candy cane. His shoulders rose and fell as he feverishly slurped from his festive straw. He lifted his head to take a breath, and blood ran down his beard.

Jeremy’s screams died down; his struggling ceased. The only movement I could see was the faint rise and fall of his chest as he labored to breathe.

I watched in horror, tears running down my face. I hadn’t even noticed the stocking had fallen out of my mouth.

Santa pulled his face away from the candy cane and wiped his beard with his sleeve. His breathing was heavy. He looked fatter.

As he twisted himself to take another drink, I found my voice.

“Santa, please…”

Santa froze for what felt like a lifetime.

And then he stood. Santa turned to face me, his bloody beard brushing against my pajamas.

Hie eyes were not what I expected for someone who was just moments ago sucking blood from a guy’s chest cavity. They were jolly. Warm.

“Merry Christmas, Eliot,” he said.

He reached over, extracted the candy cane from Jeremy’s chest and snapped his fingers. The lights binding me disappeared.

Without another word, Santa walked out of the room. The sound of sleigh bells started up again.

I screamed for help. Jeremy’s parents rushed in and called an ambulance. He was gaunt, pale and gasping for breath as they loaded him onto the stretcher. 

We were both taken to the hospital—my burns were, in the words of the doctor, “pretty bad.” But Jeremy was clinging to life.

But after a few pints of blood and a week in the hospital, he made it home. All he has left to show for his encounter with Santa is a big scar in the center of his chest. Once the wound was healed and the bandages were removed, Jeremy showed it to me.

If you squinted, it was kind of shaped like a wasp.
