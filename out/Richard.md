Ever since I was little, I’ve always had a love for astronomy. I loved going on night walks when the sky was clear just to gaze up at the stars. It’s something I do to this day, at least until recently. We discovered something that even as I type this, the thought of sends shivers down my spine. No, I’m not some rogue NASA scientist.

&#x200B;

Nor am I employed by or affiliated with any governmental body. I work instead for an entirely separate entity in the underground called Benevolent Integrated Guidance, otherwise known as BIG. Why they call themselves that, I’m not sure. Personally, it sounds like they’re tooting their own horn. Anyway, that’s not what this is about.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

To convey it properly, a good place to start would be the beginning. I was fresh out of college with years of study under my belt. Like most graduates, I was up to my eyeballs in debt and broke as hell. I was forced to work two different jobs over the next year. Rice and Ramen became my main diet staples.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Leisure time was practically non-existent. It was get up, work the morning at McDonald’s, work the night at Taco Bell, go home, go to bed, rinse, and repeat.  I’d gotten back from some especially grueling shifts. I winced at the pain in my feet and kicked my shoes off. A groan escaped my lips when I noticed the dish pile my roommates had left in the sink.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Knowing ignoring them wouldn’t make them clean, I got to work. Putting the last of them away and then turning on the washer, I headed for my room, too tired to whip up a meal. I cleared the clothes off my bed and flopped onto it. Although I wanted to do nothing except sleep, my brain had a bad habit of keeping me up. I rolled onto my side, staring at the degree on my nightstand which may as well have been toilet paper.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Every place I applied to wanted the one thing I couldn't have at the time, experience. Between that and trying to keep up with living expenses, I thought I would never get out of this rut. That was until one night when I finally had some downtime. I was checking my email to see if I got any application responses.  Usually, they’d be along the lines of

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Dear Kadun, we appreciate your enthusiasm for this position. However, after much consideration, we regret to inform you that we’ve decided that another applicant would be more qualified to work for us. We wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.*

*Kind regards- Yadda yadda, you know the drill.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Figuring that spending any more time on this would be a waste, I was about to close the tab and put on some music. That’s when I got a new notification that read simply:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Research Position**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, in addition to rejections, I’d also been getting my fair share of scam responses meant to fish for personal information. Based on the generic title alone, I was about to delete it and forget about it.  For some reason, though, something told me to check it out. Maybe it was the lack of sleep. Maybe I just wanted to humor myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Either way. I opened it to the following:

*Dear Kadun, we hope this message finds you well.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Right off the bat,  it had my attention. I omitted it above, but the message included my last name. My email only includes my first name so I didn’t know how whoever made the message got it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*We understand you are seeking employment and believe you are qualified for our opening position. If you wish to follow up on this offer, please respond.*

*-BIG*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I got straight to the point, asking what exactly the job entailed and how much they were offering. I wasn’t about to be an underpaid intern for some number cruncher. The next morning I got a response that was written by an actual person. I can’t include it since it contains a lot of personal information. The short of it is someone wanted to meet in person for an interview.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On the condition it would be somewhere public, I agreed.  The location we decided on was Waffle House since it was twenty-four hours.  My shifts already required me to wake up at about five to get ready and the day after I was rolling out of a bed at about four in the morning. The person I met with was a man named Emil. He seemed nice enough and shortly later, I was hired.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“When do you want me to start?”

“Now.”

“As in right now? I have two shifts today.”

“Not anymore.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He gave me a look that conveyed I would need to make a choice. Although I  was liked among my co-workers, at that point in my life, minimum wage wasn’t cutting it. Making my decision, Emil thanked me. Then he handed me a piece of paper with some coordinates on it and said he’d see me there at six. The drive took me to an isolated area deep in the forest.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The place in question appeared as what I can only describe as an abandoned warehouse. Red flags were going off in my head. I began to think this was all some elaborate plan to mug me. Then again, what did I have to lose? That’s how I came to work for BIG. My life has improved drastically since I was hired.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The pay between it and my old job is night and day. The hours are mostly consistent and shorter. I was able to get a place of my own. To top it all off, I no longer have to deal with surprise dirty dishes. All that goes well ends well, right?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That was the case until our discovery that I was the first to come across. I don’t know much about the technology we use except that it’s extremely advanced and unknown to the public or even people in government.  One of these is our telescope which we call the Planet Peeper. Again, I’m not sure who came up with that, but it’s not my job to question it. What is my job is to report what I found in the far reaches beyond our galaxy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Keep in mind, that the range of what the Planet Peeper can see goes far beyond anything that has been labeled by astronomists so far.  Last month, it was like any other night.  I sat at my desk, having just gotten a coffee and some strawberry Pop-Tarts from our vending machines. We rotated turns each month on where to focus the Planet Peeper. It was my turn this time.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Either we check on places we’ve observed to see if there are any new developments or we try to see if we can find any new areas worth studying.  I chose the latter. Watching the screen move,  I noticed something odd. It was on a small gap between two galaxies. Well, I say small, but in actuality, they would be billions of light-years apart.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We zoomed in on the gap and sure enough, we found something. Greeting us was a massive solar system composed of twelve different planets. At first, it was a cause for celebration. Then the largest planet disappeared off the screen. Although our technology is advanced it’s still technically experimental and prone to occasional glitches.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This wasn’t the case, however. An entire planet had somehow vanished before our very eyes and in its place were stars. Theories were buzzing about what could be the cause of this or how none of the other planets seemed to be disturbed. Someone suggested trying to locate where the stars emerged and seeing if we could trace back the origin. We tried it and discovered the smallest planet was drifting away.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The assumption was this was due to the gravity imbalance. Upon further inspection, we realized with astonishment that there was a massive rocket attached to it exporting an unknown fuel. The first sign of intelligent life in the cosmos and it was trying to get away. From what, we weren’t sure. Truthfully, we would’ve been better off not knowing something like that thing could or did exist in our universe.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Whenever the Planet Peeper detects something unusual, it will auto-snap the image for easier study. In this case, nothing could’ve prepared us for what came up on screen. Even now my hands are shaking as I type this.  What appeared was something long and cylindrical.  At its front appeared to be a sort of dome-like head. At its back were two conjoined spheres. Eyes covered it that could act independently of each other.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We were all too stunned for words. One of the eyes focused on the fleeing planet and the mass of it shifted to target it. As a last-ditch effort, some ships came from the planet and attempted to defend it.  They had weaponry any military on Earth could only dream of.  While their efforts were noble, it was fruitless.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The creature shrugged off the lasers they fired at it. Then retaliated by firing a stream of yellow acid from the top of its dome. Nothing was left of the ships. The thing began pulsing as its spheres twitched. A jet of white stars shot from it, destroying the planet entirely.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Not a word was said. Then we noticed it was moving. No, not moving, it was turning toward us. Panic surged through the room and we were scrambling to figure out how it was aware of us. The answer was radio signals.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Our computers are designed to auto-send a radio message in the direction of any area where something unique is detected.  Thankfully, we have a way to shut this down.  I was moving on instinct and my hand slammed down on the button, cutting off the signal. We waited as the thing stared at us with its single eye on its dome. Then it turned away from us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I imagine it’s akin to thinking you heard someone call your name. We didn’t come to work for a week just in case, but it seemed as if we were in the clear. Giving names to something tends to make them less frightening. Therefore, we’ve decided to call the thing we saw Richard. It was an out-of-a-hat thing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don’t know where Richard is now. I just hope it stays far away. We lucked out when we found it. That could easily change, though.  Governments have space programs sending out messages constantly. Even if the chances of Richard encountering us again are infinitesimal it’s not a risk I think we should take. It’s this that’s made me decide to post this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

No, I’m not going to be hunted down by the government or anything similar. This upload is a plea for us to put our differences aside and find a way to get the fuck off this planet. The aliens who tried to fight Richard lost even with their stronger tech. Maybe with enough time, we could surpass them, However, as it stands now and with the planet’s present condition, I believe escape is our best option.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As I said, the chances of a signal reaching Richard are small, but if it finds out about us it would mean oblivion. There would be nothing we could do to stop [it](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) from [coming.](https://www.threads.net/@rose_black2222)
