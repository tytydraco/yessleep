Some jerkwad stole my phone charger. I followed him with a friend for safety. We confronted him at an industrial kitchen inside an office building. The jerkwad and I yelled at each other. He eventually told us where we could find it, in the office section. My friend and I went into the office area, which seemed unused for the day. We took the charging cable. Suddenly we hear the full fury scream of a man, and a viscous-sounding dog starts barking. All my hair stands up. My friend sees where it's coming from, looks at me and says "Run."

We bolt back out the office section and to the exit. We hear the dog's claws scrabbling and footsteps slamming behind us as he starts to rant about us trespassing. I slam my body against the door bar and the door to get out without slowing down. Outside I instantly look for the corner of a building to go around to block our pursuer's line of sight. There are no buildings nearby, just a sparse forest across the road. We both keep our momentum and go that way, hoping if we put enough trees between us and them they'll lose us.

With only a few trees behind us, we hear the door we left through get kicked open before it ever closed itself with it's metal spring arm thing at the top. The man starts absolutely SCREAMING about torturing and killing us for trespassing. My legs are now burning, my throat is hot and dry, but I slam the ground with my feet even harder now. I MUST ESCAPE. We go farther into the trees, the dog's barking gets closer and closer. My friend veers away from me. The dog picks me. I smell it's musk. I hear it jump. It hits my back.

There is a television broadcast. A normal looking white man with dirty blond hair, with a crazy look in his eyes and like he's barely holding back pure rage explains with a smile and a quiet tone that he not only caught the trespasser, but he's going to wipe her memory and trick her into committing a new crime every day, and kill her for it in a new way every day.

I tumble as the dog bites through my skin and muscle in my arm. I hardly feel it from the adrenaline. I roll and get up, swinging my arm sending the dog flying. I keep running. It growls and barks loudly, coming closer again. I look over my shoulder to prepare for it's attack this time. I get a glimpse of my friend fighting with the enraged, normal white man in a dark trenchcoat, who is villain monologuing that this was all inevitable, and that he orchestrated us to come to the office so he could kill us for trespassing. The dog leaps at me. I wrap my arms around it's neck and jerk as hard as I can. I feel it's neck breaking. It howls. It slows down. I can't get through thick bushes to escape. The dog is still trying to bite me, I bat and kick at it which is enough to defend myself in it's weakened state. I look to my friend, he's losing the fight. I kick the dog hard in the head and run towards the fight.

I wake up with a jolt in a dark room, adrenaline in my blood. It's my bedroom. I can hear the wind blowing outside. I turn on lights and look around the mobile home to make sure I'm alone. My front door is unlocked. I lock it and close the windows and curtains. I check the time. Only 5:30am. I didn't sleep long enough because I have work later today, but I'm too scared to go back to sleep. I use the toilet. I realize my shirt smells like the dirty dog. Nobody I know owns a dog. I boot up my computer, and write this.
