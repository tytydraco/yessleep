I could taste and feel the dust, not only when it entered but with each cough too. I could see each individual speck lit up by the beam of light that shine through the circular window. I was in my great grandparents’ (my father’s side) attic. They had both recently passed (my great grandmother a heart attack and my great grandfather heartbreak), I was in search of some old photos they might’ve had of them to have for me and to give to some family members.

My great grandparents loved each other since they were kids. This love had followed them into their old age. They also loved family, they had always treated me and my cousins with nothing but pure kindness. They would go out of their way for us. She would always make the best chocolate chip cookies, we got the recipe after she died but even when following it exactly they didn’t taste as good as when she would make them. And while eating the freshly baked warm cookies we were joined by another warmth. That of our great grandfather. His rough voice from many years of smoking somehow smooth out when talking to us. Even more so when regaling stories. He would tell these long intricate stories of when he was a kid, people he met and places he’d gone. However, his favorite type of story to tell us was of family. He’d go on and on about his mother, and my great grandmother’s parents and family of days gone by. There was just one person he wouldn’t speak of. His own father, Isaiah. All he would say is his name and that he died in an accident while working.

Amidst old wooden trunks, boxes, and furniture all draped in dust. I had come across another old trunk. This one was covered by some old boxes of Christmas decorations that I accidentally knocked over. I opened the trunk and I had hit the jackpot. Inside where stacks of old photos bundled with twine, leaving an unsightly bend in them. I reached in to take them out somewhat akin to bank robbers with stacks of money. Below the photos where some old books. However, only one caught my eye. What seemed to be the oldest of the bunch, a leather bound book, the edge of the pages yellowed with age. Something, maybe the clear age or the lack of a name on the outside, drew me to it.

I decided to sit on an old rocking chair that was there (not before wiping the thing down). I opened the book flipped through some random pages. It was from the year 1857. The handwriting was neat yet faded. I couldn’t believe my eyes.
It was him. Not just of him. It was written by him. The journal of my great great grandfather Isaiah. On the first page I read it detailed the working conditions of the mine he was just moved to. He wrote that it was even further up north than the previous one that ran dry. He complained how it was “due for a collapse”. In fact he repeated this sentiment multiple times throughout these few pages I flicked through. Each time echoeing his frustration. As the days marched on by in the journal he began to complain more and more about the “dusk creepin in” and how the cold became sharp and painful. “Stabbing” his ears with each “howl of the chilling wind”. The penmanship slowly became shakier with each page nearing the middle of winter. In his last few entries that seemed to span over two weeks he said that they were just about finished for the day and where heading out when a deafening sound shook the mine’s mouth. The entrance collapsed. Rocks tumbled and crushed those he worked with. In front of him he saw those he deemed friends unwillingly depart him in a single moment. Leaving only mangled limbs in front of him.

The ink grew smudged and even shakier though still legible. 

He was in the dark, the echoes of his breathing and footsteps surrounded him. He was the only one left alive. “No longer do I hear the wailing of the wind against the opening of the mine” 
“It’s cold”
“It’s dark”
“I’m hungry”
These lines in the journal much like his own footsteps repeated. He wrote less frequently now. More of these same lines and much less of anything else. Two lines caught me off guard: “The dead are more fortunate than I” “At this time I can only think of my family and them.” “I wish I had never taken this job so far away from civilized folk”
The remainder of the journal are what can only be described as a descent into madness.
“It’s cold”
“It’s dark”
“I’m no longer hungry, I have eaten”
This lasted for about a day until it became:

“It’s cold”
“It’s dark”
“My hair is falling out”
“My nails still grow”
“I hunger more so now than ever”
There is no more writing and the pages are stained with what I do not know.
I have no clue of what to make of this. My great grandpa always said his father died the cave in. But from this journal it looks like he survived somehow. I’ll look into the mining company he worked for and at newspapers of the time. I’ll see if I could maybe turn anything worthwhile up.
