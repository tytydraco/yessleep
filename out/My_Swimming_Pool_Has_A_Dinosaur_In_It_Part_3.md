I've learned a lot about the town since I last posted.

 No major attacks since Rick. Well sort off-but we'll get to that. The morning after I woke up to a polite knock on the front door. I found an envelope slipped under with my name neatly written in blue ink.  I'm going to transcribe the whole flyer here now-it's wild stuff:           

 **"To our friends and neighbors in the township of Eustace"**

*"Last night our Friend Rick suffered a horrible injury-and the loss of a beloved family pet. While this is a tragedy and our hearts go out to his family at this time-we would be remiss if we didn't highlight this incident as why we have strict guidelines about how we engage with the wildlife.* 

*During the course of our investigation into last night's incident-it has been brought to our attention that Rick was improperly securing his bird feeder and filming the raptor pack. We shouldn't need to remind you all we have very strict polices about feeding the raptors specifically and VERY strict NDAs about recordings. We shouldn't need to remind you all-but last night suggests otherwise.*

 *Under normal circumstances these violations would be grounds for eviction proceedings but in light of this tragedy-we feel a lesson has been harshly learned. We'd also like to say we are posting new rules about securing your pets indoors during certain hours- and enacting a curfew of 8pm starting tonight. These rules are to ensure no more bite incidents occur-they are not punishments.* 

*Again, we would like to extend our thoughts and prayers to Rick's family at this time. We have been told he is stable and will be coming home in a few days. Please direct any notes of well wishes or gift baskets to his lovely wife Marla.* 

*The heatwave is expected to continue-so please, do not agitate our cretaceous neighbors any more than they already are. Be mindful, be kind, and above all be safe. Have a wonderful day."*        

**"From Head of the Eustace Township Commission"**

My blood boiled at this-it was so tasteless and impersonal. A man was mauled by a dinosaur and all Wayne could muster was a letter full of corpo speak? I tore it up and marched out the door-shielding my eyes from the melting rays of the sun. 

Across the way Tessa was standing in a bathrobe mumbling to herself as she crumpled the flyer in frustration.  An egg-shaped shadow loomed behind her, trying to usher her back inside. She brushed him off and yelled something to the effect of "Cowardly bastard." as she huffed back into their home. Lucas stuck his head out and saw me gawking. He gave a polite wave- a first for him-and retreated as well. 

I didn't know what I was thinking of doing, but it occurred to me that Marla had seen that flyer as well, and that was the last thing she needed. I stormed next door-hoping to intercept the letter. Their front porch was worn and well used- an old bench leaned against the tiled walls. I rang the doorbell, a harsh chime echoing through their home. I was met with silence, and in my hurried state I leaned over to the driveway and saw it was empty-save a police cruiser. 

Officer Sydney was watching me lose my mind-an oddly calm look on her face. She was wearing her blackout shades and sipping softly out of a styrofoam cop. She was sitting on the hood of her cruiser and patted next to her. I joined her, face flushing with beets as I stewed about the flyer. She pulled out a try with three other cups behind her.

"Want one?" she offered. I grabbed one and took a swig, almost immediately throwing up from the taste of baileys and decaf.

 "Bit early isn't it." I choked out.

"Nonsense. It's five o'clock somewhere and all that jazz." She took another sip of the spiked coffee. "You won't find her-she's parked at the county hospital till they give Rick the all clear." She explained. 

"Then what are you doing here?" I squared my face at her.

 "Waiting till they come back-to make sure they kept their mouth shut." She said grimly. "Ridiculous I know, they've lived here all their life. They know better-which is why I can't wrap my head around why he didn't mention they were coming up to his frigging backdoor." She complained.

 "Did you see that note, it's abhorrent." I sat next to her, the car jolting as I did.

"I delivered them-god forbid Wayne do any heavy lifting. Well more than he already does." She cracked. "There'll be grumbling and pouting-but it'll die down. Always does." She turned to me and anticipated my next question.

"Barton county has the highest number of reported disappearances in the state-both animal and people. Wayne likes to pretend otherwise but even here I get calls about pets snatched in the middle of the night or attempted break ins."

"Last week I got a call-few streets down. The Martinez family-said the daughter got up in the middle of the night and saw a monster scratching at the back door. Said she could see the handle jiggling-and these glowing orbs staring right at her. Didn't find the monster-just a couple loose feathers and scratch marks in the glass." She recalled, taking a longer sip. 

I felt the urge to join her on that one, didn't sting any less going down the second time. 

"Jesus." I muttered. 

"I don't think he's down here-if he was these things would have been wiped out ages ago." She admitted flippantly.

 "Even Lucile?" I tried to joke. She looked me dead in the eyes, I could feel the rage burning behind her shades.

"Every last one of them." She said. "These things are smarter than they let on. They know exactly what they're doing, and they aren't afraid of us. We've coddled them too much." She spat with disgust. 

  The heat sizzled overhead, and I began to fuse to the hood of the cruiser. In the distance a jeep pulled up in front of my place, and Laura stepped out wearing jorts and a flowery sun top. 

She scanned the yard and saw me sitting with Sydney, eyebrows raised. I cleared my throat and jumped off the car, half-drunk cup in hand and a little buzzed. 

"I better go say hi-uh thanks for the drink." I blurted out.

"Sure, sure. Tell your lady friend there if she doesn't move that thing off the curb by noon, I'm having it towed." She said with a pointed grin. I laughed as I walked away, but I got the feeling she wasn't kidding. 

I ran up and gave Laura a peck on the cheek and scooped her up, pretty much carrying her to the door. Her face flustered with surprise as she wrapped her arms around me. We had barely made it in the front door when we both collapsed on the floor in a giggling heap. 

Afterwards we relaxed on the couch, curtains drawn to protect the neighborhood decency. I had just sat back down after getting us both some water as she snuggled next to me, a content but curious look on her face.

"What brought that on-guilty conscience?" She teased and slapped my bald chest.

"What-oh no, no nothing like that I just- I'm really happy to see you." I said as I held her close. "It's been kind of-tense-to put it lightly." I explained. 

I told her all that happened in the short few days I had seen her, the mob, Wayne and his plumpness, and the raptor attack. By the end of it her curiosity and amusement were replaced by panic and worry, she cursed to herself as she began searching her pockets and mine.

"Jesus-I had no idea, I'm so sorry. Ugh come on I know I brought some." She mumbled.

"I thought you were gonna quit." I gently reminded.

"I thought you were going to ask me to move in." She retorted with a dagger in my ego. "A-ha." She said producing a half open pack of Newports from her cloths. I sighed and went to the kitchen for a lighter, Laura putting on my blue button down as she followed.

"Fair enough babe, just, outside-please the odor." I complained. She obliged and snatched the lighter from my hands. The mug gy air zoomed in like we were in an airlock as she opened the sliding door. She set her sights on the grazing Lucile as she sparked up and inhaled deeply. Lucile was doing laps in the pool-her long paddle of a tail like a mini motor engine.

 She seemed anxious, and I noticed there wasn't any new gore by the pool. The crate from last night lay in the yard-shattered and all that remained of its cargo was a pinkish hue. Laura studied the big lizard as she smoked, the gears in her head ever turning. Finally, she pointed a lit finger at her and spoke her mind. 

"She's hungry-but she's not hunting." She stated. Every few seconds she was glancing at the shed as she paced the pool. She let out a low whine, her teeth clattering together in a rapid snapping noise. Laura turned to me, a devilish look on face. "You haven't fed her yet?" 

"I was busying day drinking." I said as I took a swig of water, sobriety running at full capacity now. She rolled her eyes and used a free hand to drag me out into the swampy air. She dragged me over to the shed as Lucile slowed her pace, her interest piquing and her jaws watering. 

We picked out a box of salmon and a box of halibut. When we cracked open the containers-the stench flew out of them. Lucile cooed and dragged lumbering self out of the pool. She was eyeing Laura with an odd amount of suspicion, yet when she looked at me, I got this sense of-begrudging familiarity. 

 My feelings were confirmed when she trudged right up to me and plopped down-sitting like a guarding sphinx. Her gaze was polity locked on the crates. Laura circled around the crouching dino-a look of awe upon her. 

"I described her to Brian-he said "assuming I'm not pulling the other one-" she's a type of Spinosaurus. Fully amphibious, deadly stalker of the Cenomanian stage." She prattled. "Take a look at her sail here, the colors and patterns-not camouflage, too vibrant for that. Maybe to ward off larger predators, similar to frogs who have rainbow colored skin." She speculated aloud. 

"That would mean she's-venomous or something like that right?" I said, struggling to recall something from dozens of docs she's made me slog through. She smiled at me the way you smile at your dog when they tear up a chew toy. 

"Something like that. Have you hand fed her?" she asked, turning towards the halibut.

 "No, I like being alive." I said. She laughed at that.

"Sam, she weighs about three tons-if she wanted to, you'd be dead already." She reminded, taking a slimy fish head in hand. She outstretched her hand to Lucile's jaw-who was eyeing her out of the side of her emeralds. 

Before I could warn her, she snapped her jaws, and I heard Laura yelp as Lucile groaned and snatched the fish. She chewed it slowly, savoring the raw melty feeling of the meat-all while mad dogging my girlfriend. Lucile nudged her with her snout and made a move towards the crate. 

That's when Laura did the most batshit insane thing I have ever seen. 

She put on a scowl, raised her hand and gently smacked Lucile on the snout while making this *tsst* sound with her teeth. Lucile whined-clearly taken back by this affrontery. Laura wagged her soon to be chomped hand like she was scolding a child. 

"No-bad." she commanded in this deep voice. I was too stunned to speak, otherwise I would have tackled her and brought her back in. She reached down, maintaining direct eye contact with Lucile as she slammed her tail on the ground, a jet engine sounding off from her gullet. She grabbed another and slowly brought it towards the buzzsaw. 

She raised it above her head, and Lucile followed the piper. Laura inched the fish forward and uttered a booming but simple command; "Gentle." To my astonishment Lucile neatly picked the tip with her teeth and brought it away-quickly devouring it when she realized she was safely out of reach.  Laura grinned like a mad woman and reached down and patted her scaley skull like she was a golden retriever. 

"Thatta girl, good job." She cooed as she scratched. Lucile broke out in this crocodilian trance, eyes widening and lips parting into a sinister smile. I moved closer, taking in this bizarre sight. Laura caught me gawking and nudged toward the salmon. I was hesitant, flashes of the carnage of last night flowing through me.

 But I put aside my distrust and grabbed a mound of pink. Lucile regarded me, annoyance in her eyes. I stuck out my fist and she paused, unsure if she should just snatch it. Laura urged me on-and I held my breath and shakily uttered her command: "G-Gentle." 

She was less graceful with me, making a big show of opening her maw, her rancid tuna breath melting my eyebrows. She chomped down on a bit of pink and tugged it away from me in one swift motion. She turned her head away, though she nudged closer to me. My hand trembled as I reached towards her head. She froze midchew when I laid my hand down but let me pat her.

 Her hide felt cool to the touch, leathery but smooth. Like a fresh belt. Laura giggled as she watched me awkwardly pat the dinosaur, and to be honest I don't think Lucile was too thrilled either. 

 Laura knelt down and grabbed another one, a quick whistle leaving her lips. Lucile groaned and played along-content enough I suppose. I was scratching her scales, getting into it as she gently chomped on her fishy treats.

"This is amazing." I said Laura, sounding like a little kid. She smiled at me as she continued feeding. We spent the whole day with Lucile, feeding her fish and trying-and often failing-to teach her tricks. She did seem to get a kick out of following us around the yard with food in our hands. 

She stomped like a fussy puppy-catching the thrown meat like a party trick. We watched her graze in the pool-I listened to her go on and on about everything she had learned about Spinos in the short time she had been gone. I tried to pay attention to what she was saying, because she was so passionate about it, but my attention kept drafting. 

Does that make me a shitty boyfriend? 

After a while we grazed by the pool and watched a tired Lucile drift in peace.

 Laura sat next to me and rested her head on my shoulders. Lucile had her back to us-she was beginning her own ritual of sounding like a foghorn and staring at the trees. Laura took notice of that and stood up. I joined her and we walked back inside-though I wasn't sure what the rush was. When I brought it up, she looked at me like I was an idiot.

"We spent the whole day with Lucile, feeding her, getting her used to our presences. Why do you think we did that?" She asked. I shrugged in response. "God you're dense." She said-playfully but I could feel the frustration. 

"You're right, of course. You're always right." I admitted. "That's not a dig-I never meant it as one I just- I should listen to you more." I added quickly. Laura leaned into me and kissed me deeply, her lips soft to the touch with the lingering taste of berry Chapstick. 

"You should." She simply said. 

The rest of the night was the best sleep I had all week. I woke to find a softly snoring Laura still clinging to my side. It was nice actually-before all this I was sleeping on the couch in my own home. We always seemed to find something to bicker about-I suspect she wanted the queen memory foam to herself. Rays of humidity peeked in through drawn blinds. 

I wiggled out of Laura's grasp and opened them-blinding myself with the new Dawn. The sun was high in the baby blue sky that day-had to be at least Ten AM. In bed Laura groaned and rolled herself a cocoon. I chuckled and quietly left the room. I heard a knock from downstairs and opened the door to find Lucas.

 He forced a smile when he saw me-beads of sweat clinging to his brow like rock climbers on a summit. 

"Hey Sam-another uh, another hot one today huh?" He tried to chitchat. 

"Uh-y-yeah, probably another scorcher. Good day to just stay inside and let the AC do its thing." I responded, throwing him a life preserver. This was odd-to say the least. It had been a year living here, and this was the first conversation I'd had with Lucas that didn't open with "You left your trash in the middle of the curb again." He cleared his throat and looked past me, struggling to get to the point of his announced visit.

"Well, listen-about the other day, eh what ya did for Rick and his own-" he started.

"Oh- oh no that, come on it was nothing. I just happened to be there. Anyone else would have done the same, stupid thing." I interrupted. He wagged his burly claws at me, scoffing at my modesty.

"Nah it ain't nothing. It's certainly not something I thought you'd ever do. The wife was thinking-and-and me as well, we were wondering if you wanted to come over for a late lunch or something. Give ya a long overdue "welcome to the neighborhood." He rubbed the back of his neck like it owed him money. 

"Oh-uh sure, sure that sounds nice. I'll swing by in a couple hours, shoot for 3pm?" I suggested.

"Sure, sure sounds good. Bring your uh, lady friend there-" He moved anxiously and waved his hand at the jeep neatly tucked in the drive. "Tess would love to meet her." 

"Yeah, sure that-that all sounds lovely." I said. We both nodded in agreement and let our words mingle in the air as the birds squawked among our silence. It was eternal torture-and in that instant I regretted agreeing to the lunch. 

Finally, I cough and said, "Well I better go tell her, she's still sound asleep." trying to escape back into the comfort of my home. We did an awkward goodbye as I shut the door and watched him hurry back over across the street. 

Anyway, the time came, and we walked across the street. The sky was already starting to bleed orange as the mid-day sun hung low. The walk felt like a three weeklong hike as I dragged my feels against the asphalt. 

The house across the way was painted plum purple-but the grand porch was a stark white-clean room white. We knocked on the oak door-it boomed through the veins of the home. We were met with a muffled voice, and a few moments later the door opened. 

Standing in the doorway was a bubbly blonde woman with porcelain skin. She wore a tight blue shirt with matching pants. Her face twinkled in the waning day, a square shape with a long nose. She twitched it at us and batted her painted lashes as she stood in the door. From inside the sounds of a boiling oven and the scent of Italy wafted towards us. 

"Da?" The woman spoke with a thick accent, like she was shipped straight from Siberia.

"We're here for dinner." Laura piped up next to next to me. From the bowels of the house a shrill but pleasant voice called out. 

"In the kitchen! Yelena let them in-please and thank you." Tessa sang from inside. Yelena mumbled something in Russian under her breath then put on the fakest smile I had ever seen as she stepped aside. The inside of their home smelled like an oregano scented organ grinder. 

The walls were pearly pink with flowery trim at the top. On the wall were these beautiful landscape paintings of Tuscany. The front hall was narrow and led straight into the dining room. To our left was this staircase that smelt like mildew and fresh paint. 

From above we heard a fussing baby as Yelena ditched us and bolted upstairs. Around the corner in a den straight out of my parent's home videos Lucas sat in a bulky brown cigar reeking chair. He was watching golf and straightening out his toupee when he caught us staring. His eyes bugged and he broke out a huge grin.

 "Hey you guys made it. Here-" He patted a seat next to him. "Sam why don't you take a seat-Tess is just finishing up in the kitchen and could use some help." He hinted at Laura past me. She knocked me on the shoulders and pushed me into hell as she followed the aroma of ziti. 

As I sunk into the Leather couch- I could literally feel dragging me down-I heard Tess squeal as she embraced Laura and loudly brayed about how good it was to finally meet her. Laura matched that energy almost perfectly, and the two of them soon became like long lost sisters. 

Meanwhile Lucas was pretending to watch golf while gripping a frosty brew so hard I thought it would shatter in his hands. Time seemed to freeze in that den-as the mid-tier television flicked its grain at us. At times one of us would mutter an off-hand comment about the game like "Boy Roy is really off his game." or "Awe he nicked the grass." and the other would mutter in agreement.

 He offered me a beer at one point, and I practically chugged it down. It was a frothy swill with cheap labeling, but god help me it tasted like the fruit of the gods. From down the hall they chatted away, one of them yelled five minutes and I think we both sighed with relief.

The dining room was a classy set up. There was a furnished round table with a beautifully frilly table clothing clinging to it. In the center was a feast that would make Erysicthon blush. A beautiful lasagna cooked to perfection-so thick you could eat it like a seven-layer cake. 

There was salad, freshly tossed and mixed in with garden grown tomatoes and basil. Homemade garlic bread-which smelled divine. It was thin crust bread-so when you bit into it you really savored that garlicy crunch that came with it. Laura sat next to me with a cut slab of pasta brick on her diner plate. 

On the other side were Lucas and Tess-saddled up next to each other with their plates stacked high. Tess was as thin- metabolism was funny like that I suppose. In her bedazzled claws was a wine glass filled to the brim. Wasn't surprising, dead center in the table were two uncorked wine bottles. They looked like big clubs.

 In between the two couples was their babbling boy Lou. He was sat in a highchair with a pile of orange mush in front of him. He wore a little navy-blue cap on his head. Laura had been fawning over the kid since we got there-he was all smiles and smelt like fresh powder.

 The beginning of dinner was a quiet affair-when we had first sat down it was a parade of "oh this looks good" "My compliments to the chef." But it soon settled on polite chews and the clanging of silverware. 

Laura kicked me under the table-her subtle way of trying to get me to socialize. I looked up panic, it felt like all eyes were on me to get it going. 

"This-this is nice place you folks have here." I stuttered like an idiot. Our hosts nodded in polite agreement.

"It was Luc's parent's house originally. He inherited it when they passed." Tess confirmed. He nodded, a hint of a faint memory drawn on his face. 

"It really is a beautiful place; you guys must love coming up here." Laura chimed in. 

"Eh if you get past the pests sure." Lucas chuckled. "You enjoying the neighborhood yourself, been bout a year since you guys moved in eh?" Laura was taken back by the question, and all the color draining from my face betrayed me as well.

"Oh it's a-lovely neighborhood, but no I-don't live here. Just visiting." She dragged that "I" out something fierce. Tess raised her eyebrows but said nothing. Lucas got this confuzzled look on him."

Hold on now, ya been dating how long?"

"Uh coming up on three years now." I replied.

"Three and a half." Laura corrected. I quickly raised my own glass for a swig.

"And ya still ain't hitched?" Lucas was flabbergasted as I nearly choked on my wine. He scoffed as I heaved up grapes and collected myself. "Well, I guess I was right about you the first time-you are a moron." He brayed as silence was thrown over the table like a wet towel. The world slowed to a snail's pace-Laura gave me a side eye, clearly worried about how I'd react to that. I took a big gulp of courage and just smiled. 

"Yeah, no 100% a moron, got me pegged." It was slow but the table broke down into laughter. Under the table Laura put a reassuring hand on my knee, a thanks for being a good sport. From there the damn burst and hearty conversation flowed, it was like dinning with old friends. 

Tess and Lucas both loved to talk I learned. Lucas hailed from Jersey-big shocker there-and the pair were college sweethearts. He regaled us all with stories from his youth; how he and his summer buddies would dare each other to walk into the swamplands to find a feather or an eggshell. 

He said that little rite of passage was still going strong today, the other day he passed a group of local riffraff egging each other on. Tess said she was uneasy around the dinosaurs at first. "I mean they're these big, ugly reptiles you know?" She commented.

 She told how Lucas had brought her up here the first summer they got engaged. She woke up one morning to find a curious duck billed thing poking it's head in from the bedroom window. Her first instinct was to shriek and beat the creature with her pillow, but she gazed into its hazel peepers, and her heart melted. 

It was tall and bulky she had said- kept its four fingered hands close to its chest. The nostrils were huge, like you could stick your whole fist in them. It was sniffing the air around her and making this groaning noise that sounded like a sick deer. On its head was a singular fin, it's hide hearty and green like a budding lime. 

"I should have been scared, but it looked so-kind. I could tell; it was a gentle soul." She urged. Lucas made a sound at that, and she slapped him on the arm. After a few moments she reached her hand out, and jolly green gave a quick sniff and made a grimace. He soon left after that.

"-must not have liked my perfume or something because he just turned his nose and left." She sounded offended, even a decade later. Lucas took a big bite next to her, a weary but loving look on him. 

"She loves that story-like she's the frigging dinosaur whisperer." he cracked. Lou the baby cried out next to me as Laura and I nodded our heads to their banter. The kid stretched his arms out, hands clasping shut and blinking non-stop. Tess cooed at her son and scooped him up as he babbled something to the effect of "mama." 

"Someone's cranky." She sang. "And don't be mean-you love when I tell it." 

"Well, it's nice. Not like what happened later that week." Lucas made a big show at shivering, like he was horrified at the thought. Tess furrowed her brow.

"What happened-oh my god, that was the same week wasn't? Oh god how could I forget." She grimaced. Laura looked confused but something clicked for me, so I beat her to the punch.

"Wayne mentioned something offhand, hadn't had a bite around here in ten years." I gave a gaudy impression of the wheezing man that was met with applause.

 "Heh-don't mention his lard a-uh butt around here right now. Tess is still mighty ticked." Lucas warned.

"Oh, the audacity on that man-that letter he wrote."

"Sam showed me that, and then he has that cop stake him out to-what shake him down." Laura said, all appalled. Tess was quiet for a moment; she gave her husband a knowing glance. 

"Well, it all goes back to what happened. See ten years ago there was-eh cover Lou's ears hun-this major asshole who moved in a few blocks down." Lucas began as Tess sighed and singled Yelena to rescue their son's innocent ears. "And look I know I gave you a ration of shit for the rock all night and the garbage cans or whatever. But this guy was a major douche, major league to your minor." He rambled.

"I get the point." I said. Yelena was scooping Lou up and hurrying out of the room. I didn't see the point to be honest, you can swear in front of a one-year-old who's that hurting? Lucas went on with his tale.

"-he'd get into brawls at the tavern, come home with his tale between his legs and then get into screaming matches with his girlfriend. Big embarrassment for that poor girl-I tell you. There was one thing he treasured though. He had this garden in his backyard-loved to show it off to all the neighbors. Big boastful guy-said he grew the biggest flowers, the biggest carrots-" Lucas rolled his eyes.

 "Anyway, he was real proud. Didn't abide by any pests to linger back there-rabbits or, ya know something bigger than one. " He hinted. "One day-one of those big, elephant looking ones with a neck like a frigging palm tree-eh what are they called, what they eat?" He asked the table.

"Herbivores." Laura replied. Lucas snapped his fingers and winked at her, flashing her a big grin.

"Yeah them. It wanders out from the brush, rare beauty this thing they never come this far out. Probably starving the poor guy, it was a dry summer that year. It goes into his yard and starts eating his cabbage or whatever and ya know what this jackass does?" He let the question linger in the air like week old bait.  Then he slammed his hand down on the table in a quick swat.

"-He shot 'em POW-just like that right in the neck. He knew where his girlfriend kept her service weapon locked up, ya see." He casually dropped. "Poor thing starts bellowing, you can hear it all over town like a-mournful beached whale. Bastard doesn't have the decency to just finish it off so he calls the cops to come take care it off. Wayne was livid-was yelling at the deputies to haul his ass away in chains. That was the plan of course-but uh. . ." he trailed off, hesitation creeping into his boastful attitude.

 "-They got to him first." Tess finished for him in a haunting whisper. 

"Take it all with a grain of salt of course-it's all gossip." Lucas said as he leaned in to spill the tea. "But-well think about it, big animal dying in the wind, making that much noise. Attracts stuff. You could hear in the air-these shrieks and screams, followed by a couple more rounds shoot off. Then there was nothing, even the big one stopped making noise."

"When the cops finally arrived-they found the big one all torn into. Big gashes in a line-guts sprawled all over that garden he loved so much." There was a smug aura to his tone while Lucas spoke. 

"They found what was left of the asshole leaned up against the backdoor. There were shell casings and an empty next to him, along with blood and feathers. Something had sliced him up good-" He stood up, his chair squeaking against the floor. He grabbed a fork to illustrate his point. "-one long nail-sliced from neck-" he slowly slid the fork down his jugular and past his chest "-to his gut. He was hollow when they found him-a trail of meat leading right back into the marshlands." 

He finished his story and slowly sat back down. A pain in my thigh grew as Laura dug her nails into it. I took her hand as our masterful host took a faux bow as he sat back down. Tess was cheering him own, sarcasm dripping with her jeers.

"Well, you've succeeded in scaring the hell out of us, so thank you for that." I remarked.  

"Oh, think nothing of it. I shouldn't bring up that asshole's death like that anyway-it ain't fair to Sydney." He replied. "She's a good kid, cried for weeks over that prick." he shook his head.

"Drinks a bit too much." Tess mumbled as he shot her a look.

"Hey stifle that, like you wouldn't?" She was silent at that as Lucas turned his attention back to us. "They found bloody footprints inside the house-after they gutted him, they took a little stroll, can you believe that? Marcus wasn't well liked so nothing major came of it but Wayne brought in all these rules-no feeding and lock your doors chief among them. No one is as big of a hound bout those rules more than her." He said. 

He let that knowledge dance in the air a bit more, and I was floored honestly. 

"If they're so dangerous why doesn't someone step in and-you know. . ." I trailed off. Lucas took another swig and had an answer for that rearing to go. 

"Well in my dad's day they used to. Once a season-get a group together and cull the population-like deer with some bite heh. Got one of his old hunting trophies laying around in the garage I'll show ya sometime."

"Why'd they stop?" Tess waved her hand at Laura's question.

"People got in a huff, saying it was poaching and immoral and all that. Which for the nice ones sure-but the raptors?" and that ended that conversation. I'm positive there was more too it then that, but either they didn't know or didn't think it mattered. 

In any case it seemed like the raptors would be here to stay in Eustace. After Marcus' death they were seen as dangerous vermin, but they never seemed to attack. They would go up to houses and try to break in, but that was chalked up as pure curiosity more than anything. 

There were the rumors Sydney had spoken of-missing pets and vagrants vanishing into the wetlands. But of course, they were just rumors, probably cooked up by the township to dissuade people from going in there and bugging the dinos. 

Besides if they were really a threat, the government would have done something by now right? It sounded like they were trying to convince themselves that nothing was wrong, and I wanted to believe them. 

Never mind how much Wayne's dismissive attitude towards Rick's attack bothered them. 

Never mind how they kept even their second story windows locked up tight-despite how nice the midnight breeze would feel. 

Never mind even Lucas admitted the flock had never been this aggressive, and he had overheard of another possible attack across town. 

No, everything was fine-they'd tell us if it wasn't. 

The night winded down and the mountain of pasta crumbled as our bellies filled. Lou was making a fuss, and the exhausted looking maid brought him back in, softly bouncing him in his arms. Laura shot up and instantly offered to take him-cradling him in her arms like a natural. 

He calmed as she rocked him, and Tess gave her a tired look. The ladies left to go put away dishes as Lucas dragged me outside for cigars. The guy had real Cubans-as thick as a sausage and had that pure smoke smell to them. 

He led me out-pitch black out save for the dim porch light that flickered when he slid the door. He whipped out a lighter and made a few puffs-the orange ember glowing like an old jack-o-lantern. I lit mine up and nearly hacked up a lung but damn if that Earthy "twang" wasn't worth it. 

The pair of us listened to the crickets battle it out with the cicadas for most annoying sound as behind us-our SOs were laughing it up as dishes clattered. I turned back slightly and saw Laura with a huge smile, cradling that kid like he was her own. 

He looked conked out-his dopey hat covering his eyes. It was nice seeing her so happy after the weeks of tension we had. It made me realize that Lucas wasn't far off calling me an idiot. 

"Listen I'm sorry for busting your balls earlier-" Lucas began after a long puff. A haze of smoke twirled around his face as he spoke.

"Oh, not at all-probably deserved honestly." I protested but he held up a hand.

"Well not just that- I've been giving you a hard time all year and that wasn't fair-ya know it goes both ways." he smiled.

"I appreciate that. I'm sorry if I came off-" 

"Water under the bridge." he raised his cigar and butted it against mine. Ash fell to our feet like slow rain. "To new beginnings huh?" I agreed and he slapped me on the back; it felt good despite the throbbing sting.

 We stood out there as we finished our smokes, a few feet away from the porch. We stood in the edge of the light-the wild dark grasping at our toes. Despite the grating heat it was beautiful out-the lumbering trees and the loan calls of the marsh greeted us like old friends. I was going to say as much to Lucas, but I noticed he was squinting at something in the dark-hyper focusing on what lay past the shadows. 

"What-" I whispered but was met with a harsh *shhhh*. He pointed towards the tree line. I noticed then how dead silent it had become-like we had been placed in a vacuum. The only sound was the slight breaking of twigs as shapes came into focus.

 There were five of them, leering bipedal monsters that stood at about five feet-maybe six. I could make out the outline of faux wings and dazzling crests-their eyes a hollow beacon in the fog of the night. All but one had twin bulbs that looked like luminesce orbs. The pack approached us-and began to take shape in the absence of light. They made chittering sounds to each other, sharp barks like commands. 

The one-eyed raptor stood tall among his flock. His gaze was fixed solely on me-and I swear I could feel hatred coming off that thing in waves. They stalked closer, breaking off from a tight knit formation and easing into a deadly sei-circle. Panic began to set in-we were only a few feet away from safety, but I doubt that we could outrun them if it came to it.

 I took a small step back-Lucas following my lead. The standoff lasted an eternity, the pack encircling us with greedy precision. If Lucas was scared, he hid it well-his chest steady and his short knees sturdy. His gaze darted back and forth like ping pong balls as he looked at the pack. 

One-Eye leaned forward-and I could see fresh scars scabbed over its swollen bulb. It pursed its lips-an oddly human snarl forming and I could see those fishhook teeth jutting forward-hungry for the taste of man. Lucas grabbed my arm-a sign that it was time to book it.

 I don't know if it helped but we tossed what was left of our cigars at the snickering pack and turned tail. One Eye snapped at the others and they engaged-heads down as they sprinted gracefully towards us. In seconds they were on us-the gap almost non-existent. If we weren't right next to the sliding glass, I have no doubt you'd be reading my obituary instead.

 One of the left raptors pounced-its claws stretched out for the kill-and slammed its body into the sliding door as we slammed it. The door vibrated and a fracked formed where it hit. The raptor scrambled to its feet and hissed at us as it scurried back and forth. I brushed past a panting Lucas and the *click* of the lock rang out as the pack approached the back door. 

They cocked their head-not even acknowledging us but were dead focused on the locks. They pawed at the handle-and my blood froze as it moved ever so slightly. Lucas couldn't take his eyes off that crack-a long-jagged line that separated us from certain death. 

One-Eye chirped, and the pack slowly backed off and melted back into the dark. The only trace of them was their glowing pearls-fog lights that slowly faded into the brush.Lucas snapped back into reality as he rushed to draw the curtains. Before we could process what had happen a shrill voice called from behind and we jumped out of our skins."

What's a matter with you boys." Tess spat. She sounded annoyed till she saw the ghastly looks on us. Laura peaked out from behind her, calming Lou in her arms as he fussed. I opened my mouth to speak but no words could escape. Lucas but in with the save thankfully.

"Ah just-too much wine, heard a croc roaming ya know. Hey gang-it's getting late here, uh too dark out, why don't you kids crash on the couch." Lucas suggested. I nodded along like a dope as Tess began to protest. 

Laura handed off Lou to Tess, and our hosts disappeared to bicker as we settled down on the couch. We let the tv bask us in faded silver as we struggled to pass out. Laura had asked me point blank-why are we still here when it's a minute long walk across the way. I couldn't lie to her and judging by the panicked whispers we heard floating downstairs-neither could Lucas. 

Neither of us ended up sleeping, we just held each other close until daybreak. Our restless hosts walked us out and we promised to do this again sometime. Laura is in the shower now-I think she's still shaken up. 

As for me? I'm remembering what Sydney said. 

These things are smarter than they look-and they can clearly hold a grudge.

 Did you know crows can actually remember any instance of wrongdoing towards them. They can pick out the offender out of a group of people-years later even. Then swope in and peck them to death. 

The heat is getting worse-and the pack knows my face. I think I'll look into getting a gun after all- I'll update when I can. 

Hopefully Lucile will keep them at bay till this whole thing blows over.
