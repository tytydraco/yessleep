When I was 16 my grandpa came to visit me in our small New York apartment. It was unexpected because we didn’t get any notice even though before he sent us a message in our landline back then. If you’re wondering why he didn’t call us with a cellphone it’s because this was in 1984 if you even wondered why. 

 When he settled in he called me and my older sister, Mary, who was 19 at the time visiting us from college during winter break

 “Hey kids.” My grandpa told us. “I came to tell you a story that I’ve been hiding from everyone for far to long and I have to take it off my chest.” 

  I was intrigued even by the prospect of a story because all of my friends were on vacation and I was bored. I wish I could forget all about it because I think, no, it definitely messed me and will for the rest of my life. This is what he said. 

  Grandpas Story from his perspective as I remember it.
When I was about 20 the Great War broke out in Europe, Germany started there “Schlieffen plan.” and started to invade France on the west and Russia in the east. I was drafted  in the german armed forces in January of 1916 and I was in the Front lines in France. Then in July the Battle of the Somme started. It was a couple of months into the battle and to say our conditions were horrible would be a understatement. 

 One night in our horrible sleeping quarters while the soldiers who slept during the day were now fighting in the night. Our beds were kind of like a bunk bed and I was in the bottom bunk of the rickety bunk bed. Late into the night I woke up when I heard a noise like shuffling objects. I looked around while sitting up but couldn’t see anything in the dark room only being illuminated by the distant artillery explosions. I was just about to lay down again when I saw a glimpse of a figure rising up from the area the noise came from. The figure was I think about 8 feet tall but it looked shorter because it had to crouch down because the roof. A liquid was coming from its mouth. 

It was dark and all over its mouth. Just as I saw it I couldn’t. The artillery explosion faded and I was hoping another explosion would come so i could see it. I heard footsteps, they were heavy and deep. Another explosion came and the light showed the creature at my bunk looking at the top bunk staring at my bunk mate. I grabbed my lighter and flicked it so I could look at it better. The skin was dark grey with long claws with the same liquid all over them. Some dropped on my fingers through the top bunk and I finally noticed what it was, Blood. 

I heard crunching from the top of the bunk and small squeals. I already knew what must have been happening. It was eating him. 

I slowly started to grab my gun from my holster, I had to shoot it. I aimed at it and pulled the trigger. Right as the bullet discharged it ducked down , looked at me and vanished. I looked and saw a person from the bunk to the right where i shot and saw a person in the bunk fall off. I holstered it and closed my eyes. The other soldiers didn’t bat and eye as other gunshots were all outside. The body was found the next morning but they thought the wound was from something else. 

I looked at Mary and she looked at me but grandpa just sat there. He wasn’t breathing. He just died infront of us. The doctors said they didn’t know the reason it happened. 

 It’s been at least 40 years since he died and i never was able to tell him about what I saw 20 years later and how I loved him.

 But it will have to wait, I have to board everything up as it’s coming for me like every year since I visited that place.
