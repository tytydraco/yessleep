In that small, dim apartment,
the sound of rain blended with tortured screams,
a sinful dance to the rhythm of a melody only the demons of vengeance and retribution could play.
Heavy breaths. A racing heartbeat.

July 2, 1997 – 8:30 PM
Police sirens blared through the area.
Members of the forensics team moved in to collect evidence and fingerprints from the crime scene and send them to the lab.
Detectives began questioning those near the apartment at the time of the murder.

But wait—where is Linda?

Linda—the wife of the man whose body was found in pieces in the blood-soaked bathroom—stood in the corner of the living room. Her face pale, expressionless, eyes vacant as she stared blankly at the floor, disconnected from reality.

Detective Marcus approached to question her. As the last person to see the victim, she was naturally the prime suspect in this gruesome crime.

"When was the last time you saw the victim?"
"What was your relationship with your husband like in recent months?"

Question after question echoed from Detective Marcus, but Linda gave no response.
She seemed completely absent, like a body without a soul.
Could the shock of her husband's murder have sent her into this state?

It was Marcus’s first thought. He decided she had to be taken to the station immediately.
There, specialists in psychology and mental illness, Mr. and Mrs. Roger—the famous husband-and-wife team—were contacted. They quickly requested Linda be transferred to a psychiatric hospital, where they would examine her and try to get her to speak…
Maybe even confess.
Who knows?

July 10, 1997 – Psychiatric Hospital
Nearly a week had passed since the murder.
Linda had undergone multiple psychological evaluations and mental health tests, all supervised by the Rogers.
Still, no progress.
Linda remained unresponsive—utterly detached from reality.

Could it really be the trauma?

The doctors were baffled.
Since her arrival at the hospital, Linda hadn’t spoken a single word. She sat still, expressionless, her eyes empty. She hadn’t asked for a bite of food or even a drop of water.
Nurses had no choice but to feed her intravenously, hoping she'd regain some strength—
But nothing changed.

Police began to suspect Linda was faking insanity to avoid prosecution.
Especially since they hadn’t uncovered any solid evidence linking anyone else to the murder.
The only DNA at the scene belonged to the victim and his wife Linda—which made sense, since they lived together.
What didn’t make sense was the condition of the body:
It looked untouched, as though it had spontaneously exploded.
Even the murder weapon was missing, with no trace of it anywhere.

Let’s go back to the crime scene to understand how the body was discovered...

Crime Scene – The Couple’s Apartment, Bathroom
In that narrow bathroom, the walls and ceiling were splattered with blood.
Patrick’s body—or what was left of it—lay naked on the cold tiles.
His limbs were severed, flesh torn and scattered, as if ravaged by wild dogs.
His skull was completely crushed, his brain exploded.
A strange deep gash ran from his chest to his abdomen, spilling out his intestines.
Strangest of all—his liver had been entirely removed from his body…
And someone had taken a bite out of it.

Back at the Hospital – July 15, 1997
Detective Marcus stood outside Linda’s room.
Dr. Roger shared the latest developments—or rather, the lack thereof.
Linda’s condition hadn’t changed since the night of the murder.

But Dr. Roger’s description was unsettling:

"In our entire careers, my wife and I have worked with many trauma survivors. We’ve witnessed every kind of emotional response imaginable. But Linda… is something else.
She’s like a hollow shell—no soul inside, no mind directing her.
You almost wonder if she’s human at all.
She makes no sound—not even a whisper.
She sits frozen in that corner, day and night.
When the nurses or we enter to check on her, we find her in the exact same position.
It feels like we’re dealing with a corpse.
To be honest... she’s unnatural.
She’s terrifying."

July 20 – Police Headquarters
Detective Marcus invited the Rogers for a full discussion.
A man brutally murdered.
No killer, no weapon, no trace.
And the wife—a silent, pale figure, as if she'd risen from the dead.

Everyone was puzzled.
Everyone kept thinking.
Everyone was deeply disturbed.

July 30 – Psychiatric Hospital, Linda’s Room
A bloodcurdling scream echoed through the hallway.
A nurse stood frozen at the door, horrified by the gruesome scene.
There was a new corpse.
But it wasn’t Linda.
It was another woman.

The Rogers rushed into the room and were just as stunned.
A woman had been murdered in exactly the same manner as Patrick.
But this time, the walls were covered in strange symbols and messages—written, most likely, in her blood.

They called Detective Marcus immediately, and he arrived quickly with the forensics team.
He, too, was stunned by what he saw.

.
.
.
Linda had never been here.
She was beneath the floorboards of a filthy whore’s home.

That whore tried to run.
She thought she could escape.
It was my duty to return the favor—just like I did with Patrick, the traitor.
Traitors don’t deserve to live.
They had to be punished, tortured,
So Linda could finally rest.

.
.
.
If that wasn’t Linda all this time…
Then who—or what—was it?

Was the thing we were dealing with never human to begin with?
