My wife proposed to us to go to the opera house tonight. There was going to be a new performance. I agreed. I have never been to the opera before. Joining us, was one of my wife's coworkers, whom I had never seen before.

My wife said he loves classical music and it was his birthday. A night at the performance would be a perfect gift for him.

We picked up the man. I noticed he didn't talk much. We reached the huge building. The friend held the doors for us. I nodded. That was awkward!

We took our seats. The hosts brought us champagne. The colleague refused, saying he never drinks.

The performance began. I was fascinated by the songs and the skill of the singers.

At break time, we spoke and decided to go to a restaurant after the performance.

The hosts brought us leaflets with information about the songs and the composer who lived and worked during the 1700s.


The concert resumed. It was spectacular. I, without realizing it, looked into my wife's colleague's eyes. They looked alien. They looked as imbued with a strange power, and I shivered.

After the concert, we went to the restaurant. The waiters seemed to know our friend, for they brought him an unmarked bottle with a red liquid.


We examined the leaflets. The colleague and my wife talked. From what I heard, there were some errors. The friend explained the information about the composer's suicide was fake.

He only retired. The year he started to compose was also incorrect. The friend pointed out several inaccuracies.

I didn't dare interrupt the conversation, but the colleague said some crazy stuff. Like he had to sell his two horses when nobody used carriages anymore for transport. Or when he told us about the time he had to pawn his gramophone to feed his two poor neighbors.

He didn't order anything to eat. He just drank straight out of the bottle. The dinner was over. I couldn't resist and I asked him what happened to the composer.

The man explained he bought him a ticket to a ship to Africa, to start a new life in some colonies, but that his enemies reached him.

"What kind of enemies?" asked my wife.

"The same kind I belong to..." said the man. The composer was cornered and attacked. He was found dead. Then, we dropped off the colleague. He invited us to his place, but my wife refused.

Back home, I was still shivering. I did some research about the composer. Apparently, he committed suicide due to a high level of debt.

However, another theory states he was into the occult. He crossed paths with a dangerous clan of vampires. He planned to destroy them, but they... They got him first.

My wife told me vampires don't exist, that it's all BS, and I should be calm. But I don't know if I remember correctly, but the friend at one point got past a mirror. I never saw his reflection.

I might be wrong though. It might all be just a tale, but those conversations at the restaurant really startled me. I.. I will take a week off.

I hope to convince my wife to do the same thing and we will really have a great time together!
