It was a late September evening I was having a play date with my friend. We were watching movies but my friend wanted to go outside so we did. We had a lot of fun things in the backyard but when my friends mom asked if we could find our “stick pig” we wanted to find it. My friend didn’t want to go through the  long pathway so I did instead. I was walking normally until I saw a note saying “no running on the blue” I got scared a bit but continued to keep looking.

I was already fully through the pathway until I noticed another note saying “no playing on the blue” I couldn’t find the stick pig so I looked and saw a big blue cargo container . The skin was peeling away but as I walked towards it I got an unnerving feeling. My heart was pounding my brain was flooded with horrifying sounds. I ran towards it trying to be brave but ended up turning back and running for my life. When I got back to the house area I was less scared almost safe.

I went home but I couldn’t keep my mind off it what was so scary about it? A few days later my friend randomly disappeared I was sad but what I found in a letter haunted me. There was a letter to my name I opened it and it said “you will not talk about the evidence or your next”. I froze in horror what is happening to me, my life just got worse and worse over the days. It was almost like this blue doesn’t want me telling anything about it. 

The final day, I walked into my house it was metal inside there was dead bodies all around I exited my house and realized. Over the days my house was turning into the blue, and I searched up about it. One thing popped up “Orangine’s entity” so years ago a person named Orangeine made an entity that will build up around fear. Orangeine got scared by it that he tried to escape. Then he realized the only way to escape was to destroy it, he planted a bomb in it but it was too weak Orangeine failed and he died from the blast. 

I remembered my grandparents had a time bomb so I asked them for it. They were questionable at first but finally let me use it. When I walked to my house the door was the only thing not turning into a cargo container. But there I was setting it up to 10 seconds. I ran out the door just as it turned to cargo container my timer was counting down 5 .. 4.. 3.. ..2 .. 1 and boom. I went flying through the air almost like it was slow motion, the cargo container was blown up. I hit the ground so hard I must have passed out. I woke up in the hospital finding out I have a broken leg. I saw the news “cargo container house explodes” as I watched it I noticed something the container acted like it was in pain then I realized.
