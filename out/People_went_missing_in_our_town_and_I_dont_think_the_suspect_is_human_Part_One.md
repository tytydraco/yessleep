None of this makes any real sense. I know I’m not crazy or insane and my friends aren’t either, but I just have to get this out there. There needs to be some sort of account for all of this. The police have actually been doing all they can, but when it comes to a killer in a small town, seemingly snatching children and babies out of their respective bedrooms in the dead of night, the cops tend to do things “by the book” and keep everyone in the town calm and do their duties. They don’t sneak out of their homes in the middle of the night to find clues. They work under jurisdiction and law and want to come straight home to either be alone or to their families after a long grueling day, eat dinner then go to sleep.

Not kids like us and regular people just trying to do their thing in life. People who had their family members taken. This felt like a personal attack on the town specifically and me and my friends were out for blood. Sure, coming from a group of teenagers, that sounds ridiculous. Thing about that is… we weren't just some scrawny kids. I played football from middle school to the first two years of high school and we all enjoyed lifting weights and exercising in our pastime. The guys in my friend group could all easily strong arm our fathers like it was nobody's business.

When it first started one of the parents of a victim started accusing a certain student of “stalker” behavior and everyone started rumors about that. It fizzled out after the proof shown in later investigation efforts by the police, but that didn’t mean people were safe from paranoia. We swore to find this son of a bitch and justice would be served one way or another. We wouldn’t kill anybody or anything crazy like that, but the whole town was on edge and people were acting out. We had in our stupid teenage heads that we would make an example of the bastard and shit, maybe torture them for a while and get them to piss their pants while they regret everything they did. All while the cops were on their way. You know, like they do in the movies.

What were the cops going to do, lock *us* up? Big deal. We’d get bailed out by our parents. We weren’t scared of some serial killer after watching all of those Netflix shows, basically prepping us on what to look for and even have our own theories on what we would do if one of our classmates turned out to be a Dahmer.

We talked about setting up interviews for a few kids who we thought had the *ick* in them. We even had these weird “tests” we wanted to set up like an interrogation from the damn FBI in my friends garage we would always hang out in. Scary light and all. Looking back, I know it sounds silly and perhaps a little mischievous. But this? Oh my fucking god. We weren’t prepared for something like this and neither was anyone else.

In a situation like this, delicate matters become problematic for police dealing with the press, so they told my parents to be strict on keeping this quiet. But I’m not going to keep *everything* in the dark. Not after what happened. I won’t go into full detail about certain locations and all of that, but let me introduce myself and go from there. You can call me Jake, my three best friends Ryan, Anthony, Sara and their families play a role in all of this.

The summer last year was extremely hot and devastating in Florida. Our high school is by a fairly large swamp with some hidden trails in there and some days we would sneak on top of the school at night and look out at the forest and bright lights of the city in the distance. Florida is a really flat state, so if you’re elevated enough somewhere you can see pretty far, even if you don’t have binoculars. Despite our physique and good health, we were reckless and would have some smoke and drinks up there like a bunch of rebels. It was really fun, and I wouldn’t trade those moments for the world. We would sometimes spend hours up there contemplating life and staring at the stars. Mom, if you’re reading this… Sorry. I’m sure you already knew but, yeah.

One night, we were on our way to the park we would always hang out in. There’s a trail inside the swamp that later cuts through to a section of a chain link fence by our school in a small patch of vegetation. An unmistakable huge tree is by a part of the fence that has a weak spot by your feet and when you pull it, you can crawl under with some help. Once through, you’ll be in the soccer field behind the school, but we were still a little ways away from the tree.

I looked over to my friends and I noticed Sara was holding hands with Anthony. They’ve been dating for two years now and Anthony was about to move to a different county, so they were especially close and would often make Ryan and I consider that we might not see either of them as much as we did in the past. We all grew up together since we were basically babies and we just turned sixteen and seventeen. We didn’t even have our licenses yet.

It’s kind of lame how parents could take friends away from you because of a move or divorce. Anthony’s dad was caught cheating on his mom and she decided on taking him and his little brother to their grandparents until she can figure everything out and get situated again. The drive would be over an hour and gas prices are jacked. I looked up at the night sky and took a deep breath.

“Don’t fall on your ass!”

Ryan said as he stuck his foot out in front of my stride in an attempt to trip me. It *almost* worked but he did manage to make me stumble slightly.

“You dipshit. You’ve never been able to get me and you never will.” I remarked and gave him a shove. We both chuckled and I looked up at the stars again. Night time in the summers here are pretty crisp sometimes, but the freedom to wear some shorts and a tank top outside everyday is pretty nice when you think about it.

I looked over to the lovebirds and saw Anthony pull his cell phone out. He was getting a call and he answered the phone, so I decided to tune out from that and shove Ryan again then maybe try to trip him. After a failed attempt and a brief exchange, we all stopped dead in our tracks.

“He’s what?!” Anthony shouted. “Mom, he doesn’t even know how. He’s only four!” He said into the phone and my stomach churned.

“Alright, if you and dad are going out to look, I’m coming there right now.” He hung up and started to pace back and forth, running his hands through his hair with wide eyes. Sara was to the side staring at Anthony, she looked like she was choking on words.

“Dude, what the hell?” Ryan asked.

“My fuckin’ brother is missing! Somehow he got his window open and got out. They couldn't find him anywhere and called the police. I gotta go, you guys wanna come? I could really use your help right now.” Anthony cried out to us. “Absolutely. Let’s go. I’ll call my dad, you two do the same. Call your parents and tell ‘em what’s going on.” Ryan told me and Sara and I instinctively had it in my head to do so already.

Ryan got his dad and older brother to come pick us up in his Dodge Ram and we all piled in and went to Anthony's. My folks were sleeping when I called and I said I would let them know if there would be a search. They said they would put on a pot of coffee and wait for me to call back. They knew Ryan's dad would never let anything happen to us, so we waited for police to do their thing and there was, in fact, a search of the area for a total of six hours that night. It was already 10 PM when Anthony got the call from his mother, but the adrenaline and fear of what could have happened to Anthony's poor little brother kept us all going until almost dawn.

It was devastating hearing Anthony's moms cries for little Frank. Anthony would always show me pictures on his phone of him playing peek-a-boo and it was always so heartwarming to see my best friend take pride in his little brother.

“*Frankie, honey, Mommy is here, it's okay! You can come out now! No more hide and seek, no more peek-a-boo.”* His mother cried at one point and it pierced my chest like a toxic arrow. Who takes children in the middle of the night?

Monsters. That’s who.

A full day passes and not a single sign of Frankie. No clothing, no shoes or toys. Nothing. But that’s just another bulletin to the board of mysteries because the next morning two more children went missing within a few miles of each other. My news station reported to the people that no trace of DNA was ever reported from any suspects. That’s what the police released, anyways. We got the full scoop from concerned parents and word travels around here.

It wasn’t DNA or even the child's blood that was found in the rooms where the kids were taken. There were these little clumps of dirt littered around, as if either someone had muddy boots on. The police then determined if there was a shoe size, it was size eleven. Obviously male. All of our shoe sizes were ten and under so we knew automatically it had to be someone older or a tall kid at school. After that they only stated that the mud was being thoroughly analyzed, but without any kind of fingerprint or DNA samples like hair, it would be hard to determine a perpetrator. We never heard about anyone being brought in for questioning with a size eleven shoe or anything like that.

The families were in complete shambles and Anthony wasn’t the same. He would even write Sara off and she would call me worried. I’d do my best to be a good friend saying that all we can do is give him some space when he would need it and maybe send him cute texts or leave thoughtful voicemails when he wouldn’t answer. She would thank me while crying and it was all I could do to not break down myself.

No one is ever *really* prepared for something like this. No matter what stupid games and protocols we would make up; this was a raw understanding that family members were either going missing or *dying.* But this was when Ryan had the idea to set a spark in Anthony and even his parents. He called me up to get me and Sara and knock on their door to tell them about a plan they had going on.

Ryan is a bull headed, stubborn jackal but with a heart of pure gold. His mother died from cancer in 2009 and I think seeing how Anthony's mother was taking everything, maybe he wanted to try and make them feel better. The idea was he would go out in the middle of the night and do “reconnaissance” with his older brother. Bill, an off-duty Marine with the coolest dirt bike I’d ever seen. I fell on my ass when I tried riding it once, but I wanted to try again so badly.

I was hit with a surge of pride and the belief that we would find these children and get this bastard before something worse would happen, because Bill was like an older brother to all of us and never went back on his word. Although, this was probably just some form of comfort for them and in the back of my mind, this wouldn't really gain any results. I swallowed and shoved my thoughts down with the saliva I’d just sent to my gut.

Ryan and his brother told all the kids' families that they could come over any time and get food, rest and, I know this sounds pretty awful, but even adults who were willing could receive gun safety training if they wanted by Ryan's older brother. Only in the case that this is dragged on or the suspect is caught in the middle of the night inside of a home with a worse-case-scenario situation. We wanted to be prepared for *anything* but not in a manner where we seem malicious to the police.

You should have seen the mother of the other boy, not even counseling was helping. But I’ll tell you one thing; She had faith in our plan. I’m sure she was just desperately clinging to any kind of hope available at seeing her boy again.

If you don’t know anything about small towns in the south, families like to act above the law if we can and really band together. After the horrible events from various school shootings that have been on the rise, we will protect our families from danger at *any* cost.

Hate to say it, but the police can’t do everything 24/7. I know this seems roundabout with the whole gun thing, but it’s not like any of the kids had access to them. Bill would never let that happen in a million years. Besides, we aren’t the ones you should be worried about. My parents explained a lot to me at a young age because of what direction society has been going in recently, what family and bonds we have here are staying until it’s lights out for any of us and to stay strong until the bitter end. This is precisely why we took all of this so seriously.

Turns out, we didn’t have to go that route at all anymore though, because the next morning they figured out that some of the dirt from Frankie's room came from the swamp that was by our high school. Environmentalists and nature center workers were helping out on the case for some time and were able to determine that. So, naturally this opened up a whole new can of worms because if there was someone terrorizing kids and hiding out somewhere in the swamp, then it was time to search there as soon as humanly possible.

It wasn’t anything like the Everglades, but various trails and ways to traverse the swamps are present there. That doesn’t make it safe for anyone to be in regardless. Even if this creep had some old trailer out there or whatever hideout shack they made, there are more than likely to be gators, insects, giant birds and even reptiles that wouldn’t mind snacking on a small child. So with that in mind, and after another day's search that yielded no results, I had the idea to sneak out and do some of our own searching late at night and bring some weapons.

I decided to text Ryan before Anthony to see if he would be down first, since I already knew what Anthony’s answer would be.

*Hey dude. Wanna do some late night hunting? Got a baseball bat and a flashlight. I can sneak out right now my parents think I’m sleeping.*

It took him a total of thirty seconds to respond.

*get a squad together and meet me at the spot in 30 minutes*

He then sent me a picture of a pistol on his bed. “Idiot”, I thought. Ryan's older brother and dad *had* guns and it seems he was able to “borrow” a .45 for the night. I brought my backpack and stuck the bat inside and zipped it up to hold it in place. Our “spot” was a hill located just east of one of the entrances to the swamp. We had the thought that if some creep was camping out in some of the trails ends or some other hidden part of the swamp, then they had to have had some indication of where they would need to go when they went into hiding again like a make-shift post or whatever.

It was a stretch but we all agreed it was the most logical thing for a kidnapper to do if they were dumb enough to leave a trail in the rooms. We knew the police weren’t going to be able to do much when the freaks come out at night but we wanted to be on top of this bastard like flies on shit. Also, Anthony made it clear that he won’t rest until he knows what happened to his brother. Dead or alive. I shuddered when he first told me this in a text message.

So, I then called Anthony and asked him if we should maybe get James or Knox to come with us, two other guys from the football team who would throw parties often and hated what was going on. He decided on keeping the numbers minimal because Ryan was already bringing heat and I had a metal baseball bat. I chuckled over the phone and asked him what he was bringing. Anthony was really, really into anime and had some collectors ninja sword he brought with him that had a sheath he attached at the hip. It was so funny, but when I felt the tip it almost drew blood by mere contact.

We got to the spot on our bikes then set them up to a tree nearby under some cover. We then pondered on some ideas about if we wanted to be super stealthy or what approach we should take. All sorts of wildlife would be in there, but there was a public trail with some light fixtures and where we were heading to was man made at some point with no lighting. That’s where things like gators and large reptiles would be and we knew not to get too close to the water. As another few moments passed, we all got amped up to get this going.

“I bet that motherfuckers got some shack out there, trailer, all green and plants everywhere.” Ryan spat on the ground. “He’s lucky we aren’t killing him. I wanna bust a knee cap out and watch him scream.”

Anthony spoke up.

“He took my fucking brother. We need to find him and make him pay. I want to slice him across the chest, just once. We gotta tie him up too. I brought some ropes!” Anthony got a little loud and I put my hand on his shoulder.

“Look man, I want to crack the dude's skull too and I know emotions are at a high. But let’s channel that energy into when the time comes. Right now we gotta focus on how we’re going to even find the guy. Plus, there just might be some cops in there watching the place. You never know.”

Some of the words my friends were using brought me a sense of fear that if we went along with this then one of us might do something we’ll regret by getting swept up in the moment, and I wasn’t about to let that happen. I feel like I have always been the voice of reason in the friend group pretty often. After some silence, we decided on sticking to the trails for now and if anything looked suspicious or any openings with actual dirt and grass to walk on were present, then we would do a full search of the area and look out for any trails or spots that may have gone unnoticed.

Obviously, it was going to be much darker there than it was out in the open, but at least we had flashlights and after a while, we could gather a sense of the area from the full moon. Before this nightmare and when we would feel the vibe was right for it, sometimes we would go in the swamps' secret trails at ungodly hours and listen to podcasts or music on our phones speakers. We already had a good idea of the immediate area and even if this asshole saw the beam of our flashlights what are they *really* going to do? We would find them either way and hear them running or moving around no doubt. They would have to be real fucking sneaky to get away from us while we on alert and ready to pounce on the guy with weapons.

We got in the swamp at 10 PM and I checked my phone to see it was almost one in the morning. We hadn’t found any signs of a shack or trailer out there or even any kids clothes or anything suspicious. Nobody had really spoken unless we wanted to point something out, so I thought about telling them we should consider heading back.

As some intrusive thoughts began flooding my mind, I realized that we were also pretty exposed right now and maybe this could have been a really, really bad idea. Like maybe this guy was an ex Green Beret or some fucking assassin for the CIA that went bananas. My stomach began doing flips as I realized the situation we may be in. Despite our macho personalities and weapons, we were nothing up against a trained killer if that were the case.

“Hey, guys? I’m starting to get a bad feeling about this.” I said quietly as the nightlife outside echoed around us. The guttural swamp ambience was a reminder that we were in territory not meant for human beings. Things that we were hearing belong here. What the hell would a serial killer be doing out in the swamp and how could they even get to the kids without leaving a huge, messy trail all over?

“Oh buzz off with that right now. We are out here doing a job, and that job is simple. We find the bastard and get my brother and those kids to safety.” Anthony replied with anger in his voice. I understood where he was coming from, but the logical part of my brain kept screaming at me to turn back and leave this search to the police. We were putting ourselves at risk out here.

Something was off.

As I noticed this, the nightlife outside seemed to decrease in volume as we walked on. After about a full minute of walking then, it all suddenly stopped and we were only hearing the sounds of lapping water from somewhere in front of us. It was subtle, but present and it sounded like either an alligator slowly walking or some fish periodically jumping out of the water.

I aimed my flashlight at the noise but the only things in front of me were the man made trail and plant life. Trying to locate the water, I moved towards the edge of the path but could only see vegetation and dark green everywhere. Ryan seemed to catch on to what I was looking for and aimed his flashlight around my aim too.

“Yeah, what is that?” He said, moving closer to a section of tall grass that could be moved to expose more of the swamp. Anthony began to walk forward so Ryan and I trailed behind, ready for some wetness to occur as we sloshed our way through the muddy grass moving away from the path we were on previously.

“Be careful Anthony. We don’t know what that is.” I said with a stern tone. “We really should just turn around.”

“You can fucking go, but I’m not leaving my brother out here.” He said, coldly and I immediately felt guilty for even saying that but something felt so off about this situation.

“I don’t *want* to leave, but something is not adding up here. I think we should reconsider what we're about to do. What if that’s an animal and we are food now?” I said to him and Ryan chimed in.

“Anthony, I gotta agree man, we’ve been out here almost three hours. I’m worried my brother will get up to piss and check his gun or some shit. We should think this through again, nothing seems to be out here.”

We were now standing still in a somewhat open area and a clear view of the night sky. Stars illuminated the black blanket of space and the full moon shone brightly. Anthony took a deep breath.

“Fuck. Alright, fine. But first thing in the morn-”

***(SPLASH)***

The sound rang out and instantly Ryan dumped three rounds into whatever was in the water. Anthony screamed and I was about to reach for my bat but the commotion was overwhelming. After Ryan was done he fell on his ass and I pulled him up. I heard him whimper as something in the water was still churning. I got Ryan to his feet and pulled him towards me.

“Run!” I yelled and we all darted the hell out of there. We didn’t look back. We just kept running until we made it out of there and to our bikes.

“What the actual fuck was that? A big ass gator?” Anthony asked Ryan as we all rode side by side. He said he didn’t know what it was but he said it was huge. We all remained quiet and then agreed that whatever the hell was going on, it was out of our control right now and we should consider other options.

“Frankie.. My God, where are you?” Anthony asked the air as we continued riding. We all got home safely and texted one another when we were in our rooms for the night. I’m exhausted. signing off for now. I’ll be back tomorrow.
