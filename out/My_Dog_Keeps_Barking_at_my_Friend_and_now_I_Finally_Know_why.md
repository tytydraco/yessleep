 I’m not typically good at making new friends, I just never have been. Most of the time I hang out with my friend group. One day in Fourth grade, it was the first day I think? A new kid with short brown curls approached me, his name was Jack. He asked me if we could be friends, I typically dislike that question as I’m an introvert. Jack was really cute so I said yes, what a mistake I made.

  One fateful day, Jack asked me if we could hang out. I said sure and prayed that we would stay at his house, as I had three annoying brothers. He asked if he could come to my house, I sighed and said “Sounds Good!” It had been a couple months since I had met Jack, I had become “closer with him, I felt comfortable with him coming over.

  Once he got over, my dog just kept yapping, that was normal however as, the doorbell had just rung. I opened the door to find Jack, without seeing a bicycle or a car. My dog started barking and whining even louder, which is weird as, usually he loves people. We went up to my room and we hung out for 45 minutes. It was normal, until my dog came into my room and started barking again, I went to take him outside and he bit my hand really hard. I put him outside my room and shut the door.

 Jack left after that encounter as he was afraid if my dog. I went back to my room only to notice one of my belongings was missing, my favorite childhood stuffed animal. I thought I had just knocked it behind my bed and shrugged it off.

 The next day at school, my other friends were gone, I thought this was weird as, we had a very important test that day and they did not want to miss that day. I just sat with Jack, I looked away, and looked back to see him holding a teddy bear that looked very familiar to me.

 I told him that I had the same one, he looked around nervously and told me he needed to use the bathroom. Later when I got home, I had learned that all three of my friends, were all in horrible accidents but had survived. While I was going to visit my friends in the hospital, I had just remembered that Jacks stuffed animal was the same one that I had lost. And it all started to piece together.

 The next day, I confronted Jack about it, he told me “I took it because you’re the only person I need and love” i asked him what he meant and he said “I want to remember you.”  I told him he was creeping me out. He then started screaming he needed me and I ran away.

 I went home and began to watch the news, the main headline was “10 year old boy from Kentucky is found to be cause of three separate car crashes.” It showed a picture of Jack. It then said police were still on the lookout, later that night I was super tired of the crap that had been going on. I woke up later at 2:00 A.M. on the dot to my dog barking, barking at my closet.
