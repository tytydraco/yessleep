Ever since I can remember, I have been haunted by nightmares, some of which remain vivid nearly 20 years later. I became so accustomed to these nocturnal terrors that they felt more familiar and comforting than good dreams. The emotional emptiness that followed waking from a pleasant dream would linger for days, whereas the relief of escaping a nightmare provided an immediate and profound sense of relief. Talking to close friends and consulting professionals has yielded little insight. They often tell me that, while my experiences are unusual, they aren't significantly harmful. To some extent, they're right. However, the persistent question of why I endure these vivid and frequent night terrors troubles me more than the nightmarish ordeals themselves.

This situation has led to so many questions that I can't even answer, creating an imaginary itch I can't scratch. One of the major ones is how vivid these nightmares are, even though, when I am awake, I struggle to create the simplest shapes in my mind when I close my eyes. Additionally, what determines the type and location of these nightmares? Some occur in familiar places I visit almost every day, while others unfold in settings that are either fictional or bizarre creations of my amygdala and visual cortex.

Most of the fictional location have been present for multiple nightmare, but the one that has been represented the most is the old burning house. the first time i dreamed about this place was like this.

As soon as I cross the door, the house gives me an eerie but familiar sensation, yet I can't place any memory of being here. It's as if the familiarity comes from the future, as if I know I'm going to spend a lot of time in this house for various reasons. The empty house smells like old wood on a hot summer day, but the temperature inside feels like a regular fall day, it almost feel like the house knows how to please my senses. As i adventure more in the house the lack of decor and furniture unsettles me, but instead of leaving the sense estrange sense of tranquility I'm experiencing doesn't let me get out. My rational brain analyzes this numerous signs and its telling me that there is something wrong with this house, but as soon as i look into that one painting the thought completely goes away.

I get hypnotize by the small picture, and before i realize it, I'm just a foot away staring at it. The painting depicts a burning temple-like structure atop a mountain although it feel like I've been staring for hours the fire obscures the details of the building and the surroundings, stopping me to get more information out of it. After what feels like an eternity, I regain control of my body and start heading upstairs since there's nothing else to look at on the first floor. The staircase feels flimsy, and light enters from the windows, allowing me to see specks of dust lifting from the floor with each step I take.

Outside the windows, there's an old town, somewhere I think I've been before but distorted. Some buildings have been replaced by others, or there are more decayed versions of houses I recognize. Doubt and confusion start filling my mind as I can't understand where I am—a house that feels familiar but I've never been to, a town that I think I know but has changed.

The dread of not knowing if I'm experiencing some sort of amnesia or if I'm completely losing my mind makes me run towards the entry door as fast as I can. However, my legs don't respond to what my brain wants, and I trip and fall from the stairs, landing face-first.

When I try to get up, the first floor has changed—it's no longer empty. There's a deep purple armchair, a coffee table that still looks like the trunk of a tree, and a chimney under the painting. The painting has also changed—the temple isn't burning anymore; it's a beautiful place with red and black colors and gold statues that take your breath away. The way the mountain holds the structure almost feels magical, as if it's almost impossible for it to be standing. After analyzing the picture for a long time, the smell of chocolate pulls me away, and on the wooden trunk table, there is a mug filled with hot chocolate.

When I bend to pick up the coffee mug, I get a headache so strong that it almost knocks me down. The migraine makes me regain some of my senses, and all I can think about is trying to get out. But the pleasure, tranquility, and happiness that this house is giving me are extremely hard to resist. It feels like my mind is telling me that we need to get out, but my body just wants to stay. I know I'm in danger, but I'm not only trapped in the house; I'm trapped in my own body. As I try to move towards the door, I scream, "Just move!" while my eyes shed a couple of tears out of desperation.

My mind starts numbing, and my body reaches to get the chocolate like drink. The craving I feel is like I've been addicted to this substance, and I can't fight the urge to drink it. Once I do, I pass out and wake up on the couch.

As I sit on the purple arm chair, staring at the familiar yet unsettling surroundings of this house, a chilling realization creeps over me. The comfort I felt moments ago now feels like a trap, ensnaring me deeper into its grasp. Despite my desperate attempts to resist, I find myself drawn back to the painting. Slowly, it transforms back to the version I first saw—a scene of the temple engulfed in flames.

Suddenly, I feel the temperature rising inside the house. The air becomes thick with the acrid smell of smoke and burning flesh. I try to scream and move, but it's only in my mind. My body remains seated, drinking, oblivious to the agony as my flesh seems to melt away in the inferno.

Just as the pain becomes unbearable, I awaken.
