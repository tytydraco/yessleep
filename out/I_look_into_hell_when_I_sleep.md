I have the worst nightmares when I sleep. But the thing about them is unlike most dreams or nightmares people have, these don't fade from my memories. They sit in the back of my mind taunting me with the terrible truth of what lies after life. 

I must apologize if my accounts aren't what any would be able to believe...However I find it hard to believe most of the time as well. Though let me begin from when I remember the first one I had. I was eight years old on the first nightmare. I was just entering that deep state of sleep when I'd felt a warm breeze on my face. The World around me had this weird wavyness to it, you know like when you drink a strong alcohol and your vision gets watery. The buildings around me were a type of monochrome just small bits of recognizable color.

You know that moment before the storm when you're the most calm you've ever been? I felt that for several moments before growing the courage to take a few steps through this place. Walking down the road it was oddly silent not even my footsteps made any noise. The leaves that should've been crunching under the weight of each step. Looking around the grayish area I could spot little splotches of yellow, green, and red. But suddenly there was an odd amount of normal color. The tree on which the color radiated was blackened, almost an ebony type wood. It grew rapidly however growing from a sapling into a towering giant in the matter of a few moments. 

From the area around the tree, I could hear sounds. Grotesque almost it hit all at once and caused me a harsh pain in both my head and ears. Sounds of joy and pain. Sounds of klchilderen playing and birds singing, but with a type of distortion behind them. Not really sure what to make of it I'd stepped away from the tree back into the disarray of silence. Having made a note of this trees location, I continued to walk deeper into the gray space, the area beginning to look vaugly familiar it kind of reminded me of my home town. 

I had stopped walking when I found that there was one home in particular that held a solid singular color. A maroon house. From around the corner was that color filled distortion, "But the tree was at least a good half mile down the road." I thought to myself. "What is that?!" As I rounded the corner I saw a thing hunched over eating. The pool of red that surrounded the thing was alarming, it raised its head to the notion of my presence behind it. It raised its mangled head up and unfolding its neck it didn't even turn the disfigured face. 

The things neck was jointed at four spots starting at between its shoulders where youf expect your neck to start. From there it had to have a solid foot to the rest of its neck as it just bent its head up and down. At the original time of seeing it I hadn't even considered that it's front side was already facing me. But it's body was so warped and twisted, it's hard to imagine that there was even a body at all. But it raised to its feet and for the first time heard a noise other than my thoughts, it's mouth opened to an ear spliting scream. The blood and gore it had previously been consuming dripped and fell violently to its actions. 

In a moment of shock I stood there in fear as its body began to twist. From its chest,  its ribs jutted outward piercing through the flesh of its chest. It's arms stretched and entangled themselves around the legs of the corpse it had been feeding on. Swinging the woman's body in front of me, I saw it had been eating one of my classmates whom was fairly close to me. In a sharp tone of piercing metal on metal sounds its lips that were withered and torn began to move, as if it were trying to speak. 

It was shortly after it finished and pointed at me that I woke up screaming and sweating. My grandmother rushed to my room in the dead of 2:59am. Ever since then the dreams have become worse and more graphic but one thing hasn't changed.... I always wake up at 2:59am.
