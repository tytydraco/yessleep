I don’t have many childhood memories of my father, but I’ll never forget the time he took me to a rodeo. I was about eight years old, wide-eyed and overwhelmed, as if we’d stepped into another world. Cowboys on horseback, bulls snorting in their pens, clowns doing cartwheels, and the air filled with the sound of cheering crowds—it was chaos and magic all rolled into one.

The smells, though, were something else entirely. The sharp tang of manure, sweat, and beer mingled with the sweetness of fried food. It all made my head spin. I had my first funnel cake that day. That’s another thing I’ll never forget. The powdered sugar dusting my hands and face like snow. It was delicious—for about ten minutes. Then came the stomach cramps.

That’s how I ended up in one of the rodeo’s port-a-potties.

It was as disgusting as you’d imagine—maybe worse. The air inside was humid and foul, a combination of chemical sanitizer and things far less sanitary. And then there was me, explosively adding to the mix. Once, twice, three times. I tried to be quick. Honestly, I didn’t have much choice in the matter, but when I reached for toilet paper, I froze. There wasn’t any.

Panic set in fast. “Dad!” I yelled, my voice muffled by the plastic walls.

To his credit, my dad acted quickly. Without hesitation, he slid the only paper he had on hand through a crack in the door. It was a crisp and clean five-dollar bill.

At first, I just stared at it. Five whole dollars? My eight-year-old brain whirred with possibilities: a G.I. Joe action figure, so much candy, multiple comic books. A kid could buy a lot with that kind of money.

But then reality set in, and I sighed. Five dollars or no, I had no choice.

I’ve never appreciated—or depreciated—a five-dollar bill more. Figuratively, it was too much. Literally, it wasn’t enough. Ultimately, I made it suffice.

The humiliation of using it was one thing, but the mingled disgust, relief, and regret of letting it slip into the dark abyss below? That’s something else entirely.

And then I heard it.

A sound rising from the depths of the port-a-potty—bubbling, gurgling, like something thick and wet stirring far beneath me. I froze, my stomach a tight ball. It’s just the normal, gross noises of a place like this, I told myself, but then the sound… shifted.

“Thank you,” burbled from below me.

The voice was faint but unmistakable, a wet and gelatinous sound that sent a jolt up my spine and made my hair feel like it was standing up. Every nerve in my eight-year-old body was screaming at me to run, but I literally couldn’t move.

“Thank you,” the voice said again, clearer and closer this time. I felt a faint puff of air against my bare bottom with each word.

My legs finally obeyed, and I launched myself up from the seat, my pants and Superman Underroos tangled around my ankles. My knees wobbled, and my body contorted as I tried to simultaneously stand, pull up my pants, and stagger away, all while still keeping my eyes fixed on the opening behind me.

Then I saw it.

Something sloshing upward, bubbling up over the rim. Hands. Dozens of pairs of hands.

No, not hands exactly. They were too many, too long, and too thin, the fingers writhing like worms tipped with splintered nails. They clawed their way out of the darkness, one after another. Attached to bone-thin wrists, elbows, second set of elbows, all bent at impossible angles, folding and unfolding like a grotesque flesh tree. Each smeared limb was draped with loops and clumps of wet, stained, dissolving toilet paper, like a horrible kaleidoscopic mummy doing an interpretive hand dance.

One of the hands held the damp, curling, and now stained five-dollar bill up to my face. I could smell it and see Lincoln’s face—remarkably impartial, considering the circumstances—smeared slightly and quivering before my terrified eyes.

The hand pinched the bill delicately between a thumb and forefinger, the other fingers splayed out, like a disgusting parody of the okay symbol.

“More?” the voice gurgled, louder now. Closer. Its tone inquiring.

I screamed piercingly, yanking up my pants so hard that I hurt myself a little, and slammed my body against the port-a-potty door. My shaking hands pawed the latch, baffled by it. Behind me, I could hear hands—so many hands—squeaking, sliding, scratching, and scrabbling at the walls. The plastic walls around me groaned under the weight of something impossibly large, growing. Spreading. Pushing.

Finally, the latch gave way.

I sprawled in the dirt, tears streaming down my face, the sunlight blinding. My father was there instantly, pulling me up, his voice sharp and panicked.

“What happened? Are you okay? Stop messing around!”

I opened my mouth to answer, but nothing came out. I couldn’t speak, couldn’t even breathe. I pointed mutely and desperately at the port-a-potty. Behind him, the port-a-potty door hung open. Silent and empty. Its seat gaping open like a mouth forming a black “oh” of surprise.

It’s been forty years since that day. I’ve told myself and therapists a hundred different versions of what happened. I’ve convinced myself it was a hallucination, a fever dream brought on by bad funnel cake and a child’s overactive imagination. But deep down, I know I saw something impossible. Something horrible.

It changed me.

After the rodeo, I couldn’t use a public bathroom again. At first, my parents chalked it up to typical childhood quirks, but as I got older, it became a problem. Road trips were impossible. Overnight stays at friends’ houses were out of the question. College was a nightmare.

I spent years avoiding the topic, pretending it wasn’t a problem, but the truth is, I’m terrified of what I might hear—or see—if I let my pants, and guard, down.

So when I bought my house last year, the first thing I noticed was the bathrooms. Three of them. All white. All private. All mine. It felt like a sign, like maybe I’d finally found a place where I could feel safe.

But houses, like people, have their quirks.

The plumbing was the first thing to act up. Pipes knocking in the walls, toilets refusing to flush, a faint smell of sewage that lingered in the basement no matter how much I cleaned. The home inspector told me it was nothing to worry about—“old house, old pipes,” he said—but it got worse.

Three months ago, the sewer line backed up completely. The plumber came out, ran a camera down the line, and said I needed a complete replacement. $12,500 later, the problem seemed fixed.

At least, I thought it was.

It happened this morning. I had just flushed the toilet in the upstairs bathroom. The water swirled down, and for a moment, everything seemed fine.

But as I switched off the light and closed the bathroom door behind me, I heard it.

“Thank you,” drifted up from the rattling pipes, faint but unmistakable.

I froze, my hand still gripping the bathroom door handle. The words were wet, gurgling, bubbling up—exactly as I remembered. Through the door, I could smell sewage, and hear what sounded like water hitting the floor.

“More?” The voice gurgled wetly, much clearer now. I held onto the door handle—knuckles white—as though it were the only thing keeping me upright.

Behind the door, I heard what sounded like wet hands pawing, sliding, and scratching at the tile. Getting louder. Vibrating the wall. 

And the voice—loud, insistent. Demanding, “More!”
