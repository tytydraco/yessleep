I'm not a celebrity or a high-ranking person for someone to stalk me. Heck, I'm not even a social media person, but I do have an account actually though I barely use it. So what happened the past month terrified me, that just reminiscing about it send chills to me. I'm using my account to get this nightmare off my chest, and spread awareness also. If you've encountered the same events, know that you're not alone here.

It actually started back in August. I was reading a novel on my bed to spare time. It was 10:34 that night and the blackness of the night can't seem to tire my body down. Drinking coffee before bed wasn't a good idea, but the ambiance of the night needs a hot coffee to compliment it. For what seem like a long hour, enough time had passed already. And the evening breeze is getting slightly stronger, creating sounds of trees and branches shaking. This is the indication that I should sleep already. I stood up, make my way into the small drawer beside the window when a figure outside caught my eye. At first, I thought it was an animal but as I got closer to the window to examine it, it's certainly a person. It was standing just beside the tree, not near enough but also not far. A sudden chill electrified me. Seriously, the idea of someone standing outside your house looking at you at night is terrifying. The person was not moving but I'm certain that it was staring at me. I can't discern who it was as the shade of the tree is making it hard to look. So that night, I immediately cover the windows and went straight to bed. Checking who it was in the midst of the night is something I'm super terrified of. Maybe it was just one of the neighbors pulling a prank or something.

The next day, everything went normal. What happened that night still bothered me but not to an extent where it gets me so paranoid about. Then the night came. I wasn't doing my usual night routine because a distant friend of mine called. We talked about what kind of lives we are living since we graduated from college, since we haven't been connected for years. After an hour of endless stories, we bid our goodbyes and the call ended. It was 11:47 and I went to my room. As I was fixing my bed, the window tempted me to look from it. I was curious if the person was there and the dormant fear suddenly erupted within me. But I wanted to be assured. As my eyes scanned outside, I couldn't see the person standing beside the tree. A sudden relief washed me. Maybe it was a prank all along. I leaned back from the window to finally get to bed when my heart suddenly pounded as my eyes caught something familiar. I looked again, but this time, slowly. To my utter shock, the person was there but more closer. Closer enough to reveal that it is a man. At first glance, I couldn't see the man because my eyes were focused on the tree but little did I know, it gotten closer. He was standing next to my rose garden, just blankly staring at me. I immediately turn on the lights and ran to the living room out of terror. I just know, I never slept that night.

On the third day, the effects of being awake all night struck me. My movements were a little bit heavy but I still got to work. Then the night falls again, and the same nightmare began but more intense than the previous ones. The man was getting nearer each night because this time, he was right outside my window, just ten steps ahead from the rose garden. This time, the man was looking up, staring at me. He doesn't move, he's just there stagnantly staring, examining me. That was my last straw. With shaking fingers, I immediately dialed 911. The police was certainly coming and this hell would be over. After a long hour of waiting, they did came but the man was gone. The police searched the area but they couldn't find the man. But they did see a single pair of footsteps right on the position of the man that stood there. What's puzzling is that there's no other footsteps leading up to it because the ground around the single pair of footsteps was untouched. It's like the man magically appeared there and disappeared. The thought of it intensely terrified me. The police told me to watch out for any signs of the man appearing again and notify them.

On the fourth day, It was a day where I woke up in a different room. Yes, I did booked a hotel that night because I couldn't stay in that house any longer after what just had transpired. The mornings are my safe zone, so I go to my house to suit myself up for work. The single pair of footsteps still lingered and I couldn't stare at it for too long. The night came and I decided to stay at home, because I had to notify the police if the man showed up again for this to be over. I just had to bear my fear. My eyes were focused on the way to my room as I was walking, avoiding peeking at any sides. I slowly opened the door of my room, with my eyes till looking straight into the bed. When I entered, the intense fear was creeping upon me.

The bed.

The pictures on the wall.

The corner of the room.

And then, the window.

The fear instantly paralyzed me. Unable to move, even to run as my gaze was chained to what I saw in the window. The man was right in front of it, just the glass dividing us. I couldn't comprehend how the man was literally in front of my window as there's no roof or a platform that can make him stand there. The realization of it all layered my trembling body. He was floating. I didn't waste any second, I immediately got out of my room shaking, then ran towards the backdoor to escape the monstrosity. I hit the road and sweared to never come back again.

And still, to this present day, that moment still haunts me.
