Let me get this straight... I don't believe in ghosts or any kind of paranormal occurrences. However, only one event in my life has questioned my set beliefs. Back in 2013, when I was 6 years old, I had been going through some tough times. My mom and dad had gotten divorced the year before and I was constantly moving around from house to house, splitting my life into two. Anyways, when I moved into a new house with my mom, for some reason I was terrified of it. I constantly had horrifying nightmares in my mom's house which caused me to become afraid to fall to sleep most nights. With me thinking that was the worst has already happened, things, of course, only got worse.

One time, while being bored, I wondered into my little brothers room and found a rubber skeleton. Not knowing better, and being a mischievous child, I thought it was cool and stole it from him but I would soon regret that. I do remember keeping the skeleton for a while and playing with it before anything unusual happened. However, I was quick to notice when waking up, seeing the skeleton placed directly on my nightstand. I shook it off and continued on my day, but when waking up the next morning and knowing for sure that I didn't put the skeleton on my nightstand even though I found it there, I began to freak out.

Like I said before, I was in a pretty shaky state with my parents divorce and constantly having nightmares, so this was all the more scarier. My greatest fear was that if I would have fallen asleep with it on my nightstand it would crawl into my mouth and choke me or something (This was the imagination of 6 year old me), so I tried desperately to prevent it from doing so. I tried telling my mom about it and even demonstrated it to her, but miraculously, she didn't buy it. I tried hiding it in drawers in case it was my brother or my mom moving it closer, but it still got to my nightstand. Eventually, I resorted to just throwing it away in the garbage and it never came back since then.

I have no idea what could have caused this. After years of thought my mind is still blank on the topic. I had used to think I could have sleepwalked and set the skeleton down on my nightstand but I don't have a history of sleep walking at all. I would love to get theories or ideas from anyone commenting because like I had said before, this has remained a complete mystery for many years.

Here are some other details:

-The skeleton was about as large as an ice cream cone.

-I had hid it in drawers many nights ruling out my family moving it onto my nightstand.

-It didn't follow me when I went to my dad's.

-I don't have a history of sleep walking, so I don't think I got out of bed to retrieve the skeleton.
