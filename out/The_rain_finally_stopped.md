I’m not sure why my homeland became this way. Is it a curse? A spell casted on the residents of this tiny island by some wicked witch? Is it the result of God’s divine will? No one really knows. Everyone here has come to accept this life. 

A perpetual rain. An unceasing, despairing, foreboding rain that has the power to completely infest a being with sorrow.  Since the day it started raining, we’ve been held captive. 

“Bow to the great God above.” Is what the demented ones chant without respite, day in day out.

A few months after the rain began, people started losing control of their minds. Some pulled at their hair until there was none left to pull. Some ripped apart their own skin, wailing in agony, writhing in pain. They would only stop when they dropped dead. Some abandoned their children, husbands and wives, and drowned themselves in the lake. No explanations as to why. Just woke up one day and decided to end it all. Some went insane and wandered around the island screaming and whispering puzzling things. 

There is one thing all the demented folks have in common. They keep chanting the same thing. “Bow to the great God above.” They don’t sleep, they don’t eat. They lament.

The rain is evil. It’s always been evil. 

Our island wasn’t always this way you know? I still remember. I was 5 or 6. It was a beautiful sunny day. The sky was blue and the clouds looked like cotton. The chirping of the birds, the freshly bloomed flowers and the warm breeze covered the air like a warm hug. 

Sometimes when I lie in bed, unable to cope with the all-consuming grief given to us all by the rain, I close my eyes and let my mind travel back to the past. I could still feel the warmth of the freshly ploughed field as I ran across the soft dirt, chasing Luka, my puppy. He passed away soon after the rain began. 

The rain was slick. Greasy. It wasn’t normal, and we all knew it the moment it showered down on us. The disgusting fatty droplets of liquid would slide down our skin, slowly, almost as if it wanted us to squirm. It smelled odd. Unnatural. Pungent and earthy. Distinctly similar to rotten fruit. The “rain” drops were lukewarm. Even if it was in the middle of winter, the rain was always warm. It was repulsive. Unbearable. 



Or it used to be. 

It’s been about a decade since the first rain, and now, it’s the norm. It’s bearable. But it never really stops feeling vile. 

Life has been monotonous and weary since the rain began. Every day was the same. Until now. 

Today was different. 

As soon as I woke up, a sense of impending doom took over every cell in my body. It was unsettling. Years of living each day with the same soulless routine had become the standard. So to feel something different, to feel something so wildly different from sorrow, was odd.

Not even bothering to change out of my bed clothes, I stumbled out of my hut. 

It wasn’t raining anymore?

I looked around and saw the rest of the village folks standing still with their mouths agape. 

Their eyes were all white. An unnerving smile was plastered across all of their faces. They stood there, lifeless and rigid, almost as if they were propped up using a wooden stand. Women, children, men, even the cattle stood still. They were all staring at the sky.

I was afraid. I felt panic rise from the pit of my stomach. My head slowly tilted upwards. My whole body went limp. I didn’t want to look. I didn’t mean to look. 



But I saw.

It was beautiful.



A gargantuan, looming creature stood above. Jagged teeth stuck out of its pursed, reptilian lips. It was massive. I couldn’t even see it in it’s entirety.

An inhuman feeling of ecstasy coursed throughout my veins. 

Was it you all along? Was it ever really rain? Why did it take you so long to wake?

It doesn’t matter now, does it?

I too shall bow to the great God above.
