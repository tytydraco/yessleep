It all started when my little sister was born. I was just 5 at the time. Christmas morning, I bolted out of bed and dashed straight to the tree. Uncle Mike was there with his son, Kevin, who's a bit older than me. Mom and Dad were at the hospital; Mom was expecting my sis. Two presents under the tree—one big, one not so big. Kevin and I eyed each other and raced for the big one. I snagged it first, and I couldn't help but laugh at Kevin with the slightly smaller one. Mine was this huge box, wrapped up in red and green.  
  
Kevin cracked open his present; it was a Nintendo Game Boy. Those were all the rage back then, and Kevin was over the moon. He nudged me and said, "Open yours! C'mon, let's see it."  
  
I figured mine was even better, so I was pumped to rip it open. But just as I was about to, the phone rang. Uncle answered, and from the way he talked, we figured it was Dad from the hospital. After the call, he told me I had a new sister on the way—coming home the next morning with Mom and Dad. I was stoked. Ready to open the big box, but then I had this crazy idea: save it for when they all got back. So, I carried it to my room and put it on my bed. Kevin kept bugging me to open it, but I was dead set on waiting.  
  
That Christmas was a blast. Kevin and I had a ton of fun—cake, sweets, movies. We crashed together in my bed. Next morning, noise from downstairs woke me up. I found Dad, hugged him, and saw Mom on the couch with Aunt Maddie holding my baby sis. Exciting stuff. Then I remembered the present. Rushed to my room, jumped on the bed, but it was gone. Vanished. Looked everywhere, asked everyone. Dad said he'd get me a new one, but it wasn't the same. I didn't even know what was in it. I cried. Kevin felt bad and handed over his Game Boy, saying, "You can play with it."  
  
That's how it all kicked off. Every Christmas, I'd get a gift, enjoy it for the day, and wake up the next morning to find it gone. No one knew where they went. Tried hiding them, stayed up all night to catch the thief, but it never worked. Accepted it eventually. My sis had the same birthday as Christmas, so she got two presents. She'd share one with me, and I was cool with it. No matter what I did, my Christmas joy lasted just one day.  
  
Now, I'm 19, in college a few states away. Moved into a dorm this January. Yesterday was my first Christmas without the fam and my sis. Miss her. Woke up today, instinctively thinking my present would get swiped again. Then I remembered I'm not at home, and I didn't get any presents 'cause I'm in the dorm. Checked my phone and saw a big box in red and green on my desk. Shocked. Grabbed it, and the moment I touched it, memories flooded back. Same box as the first one swiped 14 years ago. No clue how it got here. Ripped it open, and there it was—a Larami Super Soaker water gun. No idea why, but I was so darn happy I cried.
