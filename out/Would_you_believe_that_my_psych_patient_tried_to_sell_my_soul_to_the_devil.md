In college, to make some cash and bolster my med school applications, I worked as a psych tech. “Psych tech” is a boring term for a bouncer in a psychiatric ward, and my sole job was keep mentally unstable patients from hurting or killing themselves or others. In this hospital, there were four units of the psych ward: two which held the most unstable people, one for the mildly insane ones, and one for unstable kids. Every shift, I’d arrive not knowing which unit I’d be assigned to, but each time I discovered I’d be babysitting in the Peds psych ward, I breathed more easily. Kids wouldn’t kill you. Kids were easy. Most were, until I met Juliana. 

Juliana was a teen, 13 or 14 maybe, but heavier than most large adults. You could not describe her as an attractive person. She was remarkably tall, had a long and unruly black hair and wore thick Coke bottles classes. She spoke only Spanish though we knew she was US born and raised in a 1st gen household. We guessed this was so she wouldn’t have to talk to any hospital employee much, most especially the small, ancient Polish pediatric psychiatrist, Dr. Worschach. 

And Juliana was an unholy pain. She moped around the unit, slowed by the effects of her antipsychotic meds, but often she’d unexpectedly explode with anger and violence, throwing her food tray at us or lunging at us with arts and crafts supplies. You might guess that she lost arts and crafts privileges early on in her lengthy stay, and you’d be right. 

I spoke a little Spanish so the charge nurse assigned me to the peds ward for most of my shifts while Juliana was admitted. And given the severity of her condition, Juliana and I spent many months together there.

Thad, another psych tech that also spoke Spanish, was usually assigned with me to work on the unit. Unlike me, he lost his patience with Juliana on day one. She was fun to tease, though we did so subtly, as playing outright pranks on her would have gotten us in a lot of trouble. Thad used these covert pranks to cope with her volatile behavior, and after a while, I found myself doing the same. Thad would love to say, “Time for beddie-bye!” every time she had an outburst, and the two of us would firmly escort her to the isolation room where she could “settle down“. She hated that room and would pound on the walls for hours until she fell asleep.

The daily routine with Juliana quickly became old. Most mornings went something like this:

Me: “Hi Juliana, how are you feeling today?”

Juliana: “Déjame irme o déjame morir.” (Let me leave or let me die.)

Me: “Um sorry but you can’t leave yet. The doctor says you’re not ready.”

Juliana: “Te quemas en el infierno.” (Burn in hell.)

Me: “Okey dokey, want to do a puzzle?”

Juliana: <launches a plate of imitation scrambled eggs and petrified turkey bacon at my face>

Me: “Time for the quiet room.”

I admit that Juliana’s antics were comical, but when I stopped to consider her situation, it was incredibly sad. Parents were allowed to visit their children admitted to the psych ward, and Juliana‘s mom hardly came during her months there. When her mom did visit, you could tell she was happy to have Juliana there as long as possible. Free childcare! The neglect from her mother was alarming, and after her mom would leave, Juliana would cry for hours on her flimsy twin bed.

As the weeks dragged by, I could sense that Juliana was getting more and more desperate. Her escape attempts became more frequent, and her medication seem to be doing nothing. I’m sure we both wondered if she would ever leave at all. Nothing I did seem to help her or get through to her. I’d sneak her candy or play her movies that I know she liked, even if it wasn’t her turn to choose, but over time, her apathy became more and more pervasive. She did seem to become less violent though, and after a couple months, sly mischievous looks replaced the cold murderous stares she would give me and Thad. This was extremely unnerving, as if she had some sort of nefarious plan to destroy us.

Enter Satan. 

Thad discovered her plan one day in October, about two months after Juliana had been admitted. Under the mattress of the isolation room, Thad found a note on orange construction paper, written in Spanish, and decorated with all sorts of Halloween icons. It had really cute flying bats with fangs, drawn at various angles, scattered around the margins. She threw in a few jack-o-lanterns, skulls, and I think a solid attempt at a black cat. These illustrations surrounded a precisely written prayer, in cursive, addressed to Lucifer, Son of the Morning. 

To the best of my recollection it read:

Oh Satan, please hear my pleading

Oh Devil, deliver me from this prison 

For my release, I will deliver unto you

The souls of Brandon (me) and Thad

And for the rest of my life I will serve thee

Oh Hear Me Satan! I beg thee!!

(Signed nicely by Juliana).


When Thad showed this to me, I laughed and shuttered at the same time. My first thoughts were how desperate she must be to get out of there, and how futile this letter would be in achieving that goal. It certainly wouldn’t help make her case for an early release by Dr. Worschach. Thad laughed non-stop that entire shift, and posted the little prayer in the nurses’ station for all to read. The nurses and other psych techs wouldn’t let it die either, and warned me with thick sarcasm that I’d better watch out.

I laughed a lot too that day, but my laughing stopped when I caught Juliana peering in through the shatter-resistant glass window that surrounded the nurses’ station, seeing all of us marvel at her desperate attempt to be free from the psych ward.

Surprisingly, Juliana’s demeanor seem to lighten the next day. In fact, she became almost pleasant. She took her meds, ate her food without throwing it, watched the Disney cartoons, and even had Dr. Worschach remarking how much improvement she was making. Ironically, her discharge from the hospital kept being delayed as the state had to figure out a custody solution for Juliana. Apparently her mother had disappeared.

Juliana wasn’t the only one who seemed different. Thad became unusually glum and ornery each time he came into work. He told me he hadn’t been sleeping well, and that he’d been having a lot of dental pain. The next week, Thad called out sick. My routine of hanging out with Thad and quietly messing with Juliana had changed, and it felt like I needed a change too.

A few more weeks went by and Thad still had not returned to work. Rumors spread that Thad had moved back in with his parents given his health condition. Turns out I hadn’t been feeling that healthy myself. Insidiously, my outlook on life was becoming bleak. The winter had seemed to drag on way longer than it was supposed to, and I felt frankly depressed and hopeless. I wasn’t motivated to try in my science prerequisites, and if I wasn’t working in the hospital, I was in my apartment playing video games or listening to Swedish death metal. 

The thought passed my mind more than once whether Juliana‘s prayer actually worked, but I quickly rationalized my sad state as a product of seasonal effective disorder or something similar. I even saw a psychiatrist myself and got on some antidepressants, but they didn’t seem to help much.

On one of those winter nights I had a dream about Juliana. She was sitting on a bench inside an ice rink, bundled in a red scarf and a red beanie. She was glowing, smiling, which seemed weird as I had never seen her smile before. I was glad for her, and she seemed happy, though her eyes looked at me as if telling me that I had no idea what was in store for me. 

I woke up from that dream feeling exhausted, and realized that I was late for my shift at the hospital. I ran into the bathroom to splash water on my face and almost shouted when I saw my reflection: the white sclera of my right eye was completely red. Not the red of pink eye, but that of blood. It didn’t hurt, but it freaked the hell out of me. I would find out later that day that it was a benign condition called a subconjunctival hemorrhage, but I looked straight out of a horror movie. That week I’d wear sunglasses constantly, even indoors. Surprisingly, my eye cleared up rather quickly. My mood however, did not clear up, and all I thought about was that dream, and of Juliana, and wanting to see her smile.

As Juliana‘s hospital admission approach three months, I began to feel desperate for her. Something had to give. I had considered dropping out of the semester and moving back home, but more powerfully was the urge to stay and keep working at the job, just to see Juliana get released. Every time I saw Dr. Worschach, I’d ask for updates, and this questioning turned to pleading for Juliana’s release. It just wasn’t right. 

The charge nurse must have noticed that I wasn’t handling things well, and thought it best that I minimize interactions with the patients. She knew I wasn’t sleeping much so she asked if I wanted to switch to the night shift. This seemed fine to me, and my college courses were in the morning so I could have the afternoon and evening to sleep before going back to work.

One particular night after the holidays, I found myself alone in the common area of the peds psych ward, leaning back in a chair against the wall and noticing I had lost track of time. Juliana was the only patient admitted on the peds unit then and I realized that I couldn’t hear her typical snoring. The light in the nurses’ station was dark and I suspected that the charge nurse was sleeping. 

Suddenly, there was a figure right before me, towering over me, and in an instant, I recognized Juliana. Though this wasn’t the Juliana I had come to know. She was smiling. More than that, she was radiant. No longer did I see an awkward obese teenager with a permanent scowl, but an adult, a beautiful woman, who looked with at me with that knowing smile. 

The task before me at that moment was so clear, so simple and so right. I stood up, held Juliana‘s hand, and walked her out of the common room. I led her down the white hallway, barely lit by blinking fluorescent lights, and badged open the metal security doors so I could escort her straight to the elevator. She continued to smile at me, confident, graceful, forgiving. I pressed the down button on the elevator, and as the doors opened, Thad stood there, emaciated, but smiling. He was missing a few teeth and looked awful, but it didn’t matter. His eyes lit up when he saw us, or Juliana rather, and he took her hand as he brought her gently into the elevator. They turned to me as I stood outside the elevator doors, the three of us, all smiling, and with elation and terrible sadness, I watched as the elevator doors shut. Juliana finally was free.

I never got my college degree. I was fired from that job the next day, but would’ve quit anyway. Since that time there is nothing that I feel, nothing that I do, and nothing I think about, except the one mission I have: find Juliana, make her happy, and do her bidding.

Juliana, if there is any chance in hell that you read this, please, PLEASE pray that I will find you.
