The sun had just risen, and my parents were about to unlock the door to my bedroom, after the fiasco last week, my parents wanted to make sure I didn’t get out at night. I walked toward a shelf to grab a toy and tripped on a block I’d left on the floor, ran forward, and banged my head on the wall. It made a little dent, and I could hear an echo, the wall was hollow. I got up and knocked on the wall a few more times, and each time I could hear the knock reverberate behind the wall.

Then I could hear the door unlocking, and I shifted away from the wall, I didn’t want anyone to know what I was doing, I don’t know why, it felt like another thing that I should keep secret. Maybe if there was something to be afraid of in the hollow then talking about it would make it more real. My mother stood at the door and informed me that breakfast was ready, I put on a pair of shorts and a shirt and walked to the table. The sun beamed through the window, brightening the table, highlighting the specks of dust that floated through the air. There was a bowl of cereal, and a banana waiting for me.

My mom sat on the other side of the table with a cup of coffee, my father, according to my mom, had gone out for the day. She walked to the kitchen and slammed her hands on the table “who’s ready for school today!” she shouted. I jumped in my seat a bit, milk from my cereal bowl spilled onto the tablecloth. I didn’t have any time to react. “I said – who’s ready for school today!” she shouted.

“I am” I said, my heart wasn’t in it, but I knew I didn’t really have an option. I really was a very well-behaved kid, thinking back on it, it’s a real wonder that I disobeyed my parents at all, but that glowing light – I wouldn’t feel a pull like that until much older, and sadder times. I finished my cereal, and my mom sucked down, I want to say her third, cup of coffee. She was shaking, ready to teach. “Eat your banana, you need nutrients!” she was now pacing back and forth, her eyes were wide, and she was clenching her teeth.

As soon as I finished my banana, my mom ran to the cupboard where she kept my school supplies, pulled them out, and dropped them in a heap onto the table. Notebooks, pencils, stray pieces of paper, activities, a couple of those children’s books with the cardboard pages. She picked up a book I hadn’t seen before, well it wasn’t a book, it was a college rule notebook that she’d taped a piece of paper to. On the paper was a little stick figure, with a big “X” over it, and in bold red letters, same color as the “X”, it read “Things Jeremy shouldn’t do”, if you haven’t made the leap, my name is Jerry. She pulled up a seat so that it was touching mine and opened to the first page of her “book”. “Do not go outside after dark!” in big bold letters, this was very important. There was the same stick figure, standing on a little beach, big tentacles were coming out of the water, in the middle of gesticulating wildly, as if to say “If you come on here, I am going to fuck your shit up, so bad” – message received.

“Can you read this for me, Jerry?” My mom asked.

“Do not go outside after dark,” I said.

“Okay, and why is that?” My mom asked.

“Because if I do the sea-witch will get me.”

“Correct, Jeremy, and if the sea-witch gets you she will carve up your skin with her talons, and she will chew on your bones. Nobody will ever find your body, and nobody will remember you were even born”

“Won’t you and dad remember me?”

“No, that’s part of it, when the sea-witch gets someone, everyone he knew gets their memory erased. It’s like that episode of the twilight zone…”

"The What?”

“Never mind, and don’t ask me about that again. Where was I?”

“You’ll get your memory erased?”

“Right, right. Everyone who ever knew you will forget that you existed, it’ll be like you were never here at all. Daddy will scratch his head and wonder why there are toys in the house, he’ll think ‘oh, there must be some reason we have children’s toys, but it’ll never come to him. And there you’ll be sitting in the stomach of a sea-witch, burning up in her stomach acid. And also, and this is important, that will never end. You will never know the sweet release of death.”

“I don’t want to die!” I started to tear up a bit, my mother leaned in closer, she wanted to drive this point home.

“Your soul will burn inside the stomach of the horrible sea-witch for all of eternity, as she glides around her sea cave, trapping other young boys.

“Will I at least have friends?”

“Yes, but you can’t talk to them, and they’re bodies are so grotesque that if you were to look upon them you would go insane. So, I wouldn’t recommend it.”

“Can we turn the page?”

“Yes sweetie, go ahead and turn the page.”

I opened the next page of the book, and there was another stick figure, and he was standing on a ladder leading into the ceiling, an attic. Another giant red “X” graced the page. “Do not go in the attic” it read.

“What does it say?” My mom quizzed.

“Do not go in the attic?” I said, looking away.

“That’s right, do not go in the attic.”

“Why?” I asked.

“Don’t go in the fucking attic, Jeremy!”

“I won’t”

“Don’t ever ask me about the attic. Don’t talk about the attic, don’t look at the attic, don’t even fucking think about the god damn attic, I swear to fuck, Jeremy, don’t go in the fucking attack” she was starting to scream now.

I got up from the chair and ran into the living room, I didn’t want any more of this book. My mom ran after me, picked me up and held me to her bosom. I could feel her tears on the back of my neck. She was sobbing and shaking “Don’t go in the attic Jeremy, promise you won’t go”

I was crying, she was crying, “I promise mommy, I won’t go in the attic.”

There was a knock at the door then, my mom put me down, wiped her eyes with her sleeve, and went to answer. She opened it and there was a kid standing there. He had messy blonde hair and wore a shirt with a monster truck on it that read “Grave Digger” in slimy green letters that popped just a little off the cotton. My mom just stood there; her eyes fixed on this strange kid.

The kid said something I couldn’t make out, it looked as if he were whispering, as if he had some clandestine information to share with my mother. My mother nodded, and then said, very curtly, “Why don’t come inside?”

The kid walked into the room, a smile on his face, he stared at me or through me, I’m not really sure. It was extremely uncomfortable. “Just wait there for a moment” My mom said. The kid didn’t say anything in return. My mother rummaged through a drawer and came back out into the living room with a dagger. A metal blade, and a gold handle sculpted to look like the head of a dragon. A large jewel was encrusted in the dragon’s eye. My mom lunged forward and stabbed the child in the eye. The child screamed. Blood ran down his cheeks, and tears down his other eye.

Before the child could react any more my mother stabbed him in the face again, and again, and again. Blood flying onto the carpet, my mother shaking, tears rolling down her face. The kid collapsed onto the ground. I looked at the kid, my body wouldn’t react, I truly was petrified. My mom looked at me, covered in blood, and said “Go to your room, class is over for today.”

I couldn’t move.

“Go to your fucking room Jeremy!”

I snapped out of it, but before I did, I could see the child’s lips moving, he was looking directly at me. “Go back in the water” he whispered. Then he stopped. I forced myself to walk and went back into my room. That night, I had to find a way to the ocean.
