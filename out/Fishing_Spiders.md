The night I arrived at my Uncle Jersey’s small, somewhat secluded house in the woods, I had expected my uncle to already be settling in for the evening. I was supposed to arrive at his home in the early afternoon with enough time to take his boat out on the miniature lake he had on his property. Well, he calls it a miniature lake. I think of it as a large pond, but my uncle likes to proudly refer to it as the Lac du Jersey. Whether that’s proper French or not, I couldn’t tell you, and I doubt my uncle’s knowledge on the subject surpasses my own, but there you go. Any way you approached the pond, you were liable to trip over a worn wooden post that bore the name, and my uncle had painted the moniker in bold, black letters on each of the floating docks along the pond’s edge.

Anyway, the drive to my uncle’s place was heavily delayed by the loss of all four of my beater’s tires. All I’m going to say about that is that the next time my best friend decides to renew his toxic relationship with my sister, I’m steering clear of the entire situation. By the time I reached my destination, the sun was down, the moon was up, and all I wanted to do was relax with a cold beer on the front porch swing. Maybe smoke a little of the devil’s lettuce while listening to my uncle talk about his latest exploits. But, to my surprise, my uncle appeared to be just getting back from spending time at the pond when I pulled up. I hurried out of the car to help him carry his fishing gear and supplies into the house.

Upon entering the house, I was greeted with another unexpected sight. On the little wooden stand next to the door sat a rolled-up newspaper and a handful of unopened letters, all addressed to Arizona Allstate. That’s my uncle’s legal name, but the only people who use it are government officials and bill collectors. See, my grandparents had decided from the start to name all of their children after the states in our great union. When my uncle was born, the 10^(th) out of 13 children, his parents had already picked out the name Arizona for him. However, when he popped out bearing a foul odor and a face not even a mother could love, the attending nurse had joked that he reminded her more of New Jersey than Arizona. Everyone called him Jersey ever since.

Now, the reason that it was unusual to see those things sitting on the stand was that it suggested a big change in my uncle’s routine. I knew that his usual thing was to go to the end of his drive early in the morning to pick up the previous day’s mail from his box, along with a newspaper that his nearest neighbor Esther was kind enough to drop off on her way back from town every weekday. She apparently worked the night shift at a diner that was popular with truckers and my uncle. Uncle Jersey said that he only visited that diner to see Esther, as the food there was lousy, but Esther was divine. I kind of thought she looked like an overweight, overused carnival fortune teller, but I’ve seen my uncle make scarier choices than that, so good for him.

Anyway, after picking up his mail and newspaper, he would go back to the house, drop his “worries” onto the wooden stand, and go get his fishing gear and supplies. These, he would carry down to the lake, where he would stage everything near whichever fishing spot he’d chosen for the day. Then he’d walk the perimeter of the lake, enjoying a scenic stroll before returning home to deal with his “worries” over breakfast. The fact that those papers were still sitting on the stand untouched suggested that he had never come back to the house after carrying his gear out to the pond, or that something big had disturbed his routine to the point of ignoring his “worries” for the whole day. Surely, he hadn’t just spent the entire day out at the lake without coming back to the house or anything, so maybe something exciting had happened.

So far, my uncle hadn’t properly acknowledged my presence, but he looked pretty worn out, so I just quietly followed him to the kitchen thinking that we’d talk once we put down our loads and sat down. Once we sat everything down on the kitchen table, however, Uncle Jersey immediately ran to the fridge and yanked it open hard enough to cause bottles of condiments to fall out of the door and crash to the floor. He started tearing into whatever containers and packages he could get his hands on and stuffing their contents into his mouth. From what I could see, he didn’t bother to chew the food and only closed his mouth long enough to swallow what was inside before stuffing more in.

“Uncle Jersey?” I said tentatively, almost unable to find my voice through the fear I felt for my uncle. When he continued shoveling food into his mouth as if he hadn’t heard me, I cleared my throat and yelled out, “Uncle Jersey!”

My uncle suddenly stopped and spun around to face me. Half of an old sandwich that had green stuff growing on it fell out of his open mouth as he stared at me in confusion. Then he shook his head and smiled at me in recognition. “Michigan, how long have you been here? I had thought I would see you at the lake earlier.” He was the only person in the world who ever called me by my middle name, my “state name.”

“Yeah, uh, I just got here. Long story.” I gestured toward him and the mess he was now standing in, at a loss for what to say. I finally settled on, “Are you okay, Uncle Jersey?”

“Hmm?” Scratching at the patchy stubble on his face, my uncle looked down at himself and the remains of his meal on the floor. “Well, shit,” he said dejectedly. Using his feet as makeshift brooms, he pushed the bulk of the garbage to the side of the fridge so that he could close the door. Then he shook a few loose pieces of food from his shoes and shuffled over to his storage room door. “Never mind the mess for now,” he said as he went into the storage room. After a moment, he came back out practically dragging a full gas can. “Give me a hand with this, will you?”

I hurried over to relieve my uncle of his burden, which really wasn’t any heavier than he should have been used to. I wondered what he had been up to all day that had made him so hungry and exhausted. There were so many questions I wanted to ask him at that moment, but the first one to come out of my mouth was, “What’s the gas can for?”

“Got an infestation of fishing spiders I need to deal with,” he responded, leading me towards the front of the house.

“What, with fire?” I asked incredulously. Now, I hate just about any kind of spiders you can come up with and I can think of nothing more satisfying than being able to just torch them all. Fishing spiders are large, brown, scary looking things that I’d rather not think of in large quantities. However, I didn’t think that frying them up was the usual way of handling an infestation.

Uncle Jersey stopped and turned to look at me with tired eyes. “Son, the gas is for the boat. I’m going to take her out first thing in the morning to get a better look at the spider situation. In the meantime, I’ve started a bonfire down by the lake and I figure we can cook up some hot dogs, drink a few beers, and just relax by the fire. How’s that sound to you?”

Honestly, it didn’t sound like the best idea, given how tired he looked and how strange this whole situation seemed. But, if he had already started a bonfire out there, I didn’t like the idea of leaving the fire unattended. For that reason, we had to go to the lake anyway, so we might as well relax for a while and talk about what was going on while we were at it. “Sounds good, Uncle Jersey,” I replied.

Without another word, my uncle turned and led us out of the house and down off the porch. He paused upon seeing my banged-up ride. “Hasn’t Big Bam Allstate seen fit to give his son a proper set of wheels yet?” he asked, chuckling and coughing in equal measures.

My dad Alabama, or Bam to his friends, was a small-time college football star turned car salesman extraordinaire. He owned several large, successful dealerships and made way more than enough to take care of his wife and eight kids. He was currently covering my entire college tuition, while I worked to cover room and board, food, and spending money. I was still driving the used car he got for me when I was 16. “Actually, I’m saving up to buy my own car,” I said. “I want to earn it so it can really be mine, you know? Besides, any new car wouldn’t survive my friends right now. This one is holding up well considering.”

“You’re a good boy, Mich. Always have been,” he said before breaking into a coughing fit. I placed a hand on his back to steady him as he leaned forward and continued to hack until he finally coughed up a wad of sticky phlegm. He straightened back up and used a handkerchief from his back pocket to wipe his mouth dry. “Sorry about that,” he wheezed. “Let’s get down to that fire so I can sit for a spell.”

Once we got to the lake, I saw that my uncle had set up a big bonfire close to one of the docks. I helped park him on a log in front of it and then went to the boathouse to grab a pack of hotdogs and some beer from the fridge he kept in there. I also grabbed a big bag of pretzels and a can of peanuts off a shelf. When I returned to the bonfire, my uncle was just recovering from another one of his coughing fits. I expressed my concerns about his health, but he just waved it off and told me to have a seat.

While we sat and cooked our dogs, my uncle kept me busy answering his questions about my life at school and about my friends, family, and romantic interests. I still had lots of questions I wanted to ask him, but I guess I got lulled into a sense of normalcy as we chatted and joked about things like we had always done since I was a young boy. The warmth, the smells of cooking over an open fire by the lake, the beer, and the comradery were enough to make the cares of the world wash away. That is until my uncle suddenly stood up, wincing in pain with his hand over his chest, but with an intense look of concentration in his eyes.

“Uncle Jersey! What is going on?” I yelled in confusion as I watched him pick up a handmade torch from beside the sitting log and light the end of it over the bonfire. Once again, he turned his tired, now focused eyes on me and sighed as he handed me the torch.

“All right, son. Follow me and I’ll tell you what you want to know,” he said. He picked up the gas can I’d left with him, having forgotten to take it to the boathouse when I went earlier. In hindsight, I think maybe my uncle made sure I was distracted enough not to think about taking it away to the boathouse. In any event, he lifted the gas can with both hands and kind of limp-waddled over to the nearby dock while I followed. As he stepped onto the wooden platform, he warned me not to come too close with my torch. I just stood there in shock as I watched him open up the gas can and start pouring its contents liberally over the dock.

“Earlier today,” my uncle explained as he splashed around the flammable liquid, “I came down to the lake to do my usual morning stroll around the perimeter. I wasn’t expecting any visitors or anything, but as I came around from the boathouse, I saw a skinny guy in a hoody standing on this dock holding a box. As I got closer, the guy upended the box, and I saw that he was dumping a crap load of spiders onto my dock. I about flipped my lid and yelled at the guy to get off my property or there would be hell to pay. Well, the guy took one look at me, dropped the box, pulled a box cutter out of his pocket, and charged right at me.”

Uncle Jersey paused to stare at the lake for a moment and catch his breath. Then he coughed a little and continued. “You know I don’t go anywhere without my lucky .45 holstered at the ready. I took aim and fired true, hit him right in the chest and he went down hard.”

“Holy crap! You shot somebody?” I looked around wildly, somehow expecting to see a body where there hadn’t been one when we’d walked over here. Another coughing fit drew my attention back to my uncle, who was now just cradling the gas can in his arms.

“Body’s long gone now,” he said, wiping his mouth on his sleeve and leaving behind a trail of thick mucus. “But, after I shot him, I went to check on the guy. I didn’t figure he was still amongst the living, but you ought to make sure, nevertheless. I went over, knelt by the body, and pulled the hood off of his face. God, I wish I had never done that. What I saw was so… was so horrible…”

Suddenly, my uncle doubled over in another fit of coughing before finally spewing forth scores of fat, black, eight-legged bodies. They tumbled over each other as they fell to the dock, and then quickly scrambled to the underside of the platform, disappearing almost as quickly as they had appeared. My uncle stood up straight again and looked at me with one eye. One of those spiders that had erupted from my uncle’s mouth now sat on one of his eyes, like a grotesque, pulsating eyepatch. “Sorry about that,” my uncle said as a vertical split opened in that spider’s back, revealing a bright green eye inside.

I screamed in horror at the thing, and then I screamed even more when I saw the green eyes of all its companions glittering at me from under the dock. My uncle at this point poured the remainder of the gas can’s contents over his own head and reached out a hand towards me. “Hand me that torch now, will you, son?” he said in a guttural voice that sounded like multiple voices speaking in unison. His body started to tremble, and his neck looked like it was growing wider.

“No!” I yelled as I took a few steps back. “Uncle Jersey, I’ll go get help…” My voice petered out as my uncle’s face abruptly split open along his cheeks. His bottom jaw was practically ripped free as something huge struggled to free itself from his body, using four of its long, black, spindly appendages to tear through his face. As I stared into my uncle’s shredded visage, eight luminous green eyes stared right back at me. I threw the torch. My ears nearly split from the alien screams that filled the air as everything went up in flames.

This all happened a few years ago. I could never tell anyone the truth about what happened, so the whole thing was written off as an unfortunate accident stemming from an unconventional way of getting rid of fishing spiders. I still miss my uncle terribly and try to honor his memory by keeping some of his traditions alive. I don’t do ponds or lakes anymore, though. And I don’t go near anything that even remotely reminds me of spiders. No amount of therapy will ever help me get over what I saw, especially since no one would ever believe my story. And I still worry to this day that even one of those things might have escaped the fire. Wherever my Uncle Jersey is now, I hope he knows that I will always think of him as a hero. He certainly was one that night at the Lac du Jersey.
