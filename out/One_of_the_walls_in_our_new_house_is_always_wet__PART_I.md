PART I - THE HOUSE

After my wife died, my daughter and I just *existed*. I had my job in the city, she had her schooling. Maintaining that routine seemed important for a time. Necessary even. But in the quiet moments, which were far too often and far too loud, it was like we were *drowning*.

Though we were lucky too, in many ways. We had lots of kind people who were trying to help us daily; neighbours who would bring us dinners and wine and cakes and pasta salads; family who often came to stay for weeks at a time, so that our apartment didn’t feel so hollow.

But the shadow of our grief seemed only to intensify with time. After a point, there was only the *hollowness*. The vacuum. Nothing seemed to fill it up.

I tried, though. To fill it. With drink. With *vice*.

Layla too. My daughter, my sorrow-filled angel. She began cutting herself.

Aged ten.

*Aged ten.*

“We need a change,” I smiled tearily, shaking the razor blades out of the matchbox beside her bed, once she'd told me where she’d hidden them.

Layla liked candles. She claimed that lamplight “kept her up”.

Leaning towards her in the candlelight, I kissed her on the temple, spilling tears into her hair as I promised that we’d start over. That we’d get out of the city. That things would change.

“I’m going to start looking for a new job,” I determined, as I blew out her candles. But while she drifted off to sleep, I sat there uncomfortably at the end of her bed, looking for jobs. Looking for places. Looking for houses.

“This one looks good,” I said, showing her a job listing the following morning over breakfast. It was for a job in the countryside; just run-of-the-mill office work with a bit of travel, nothing spectacular, but the pay was commensurate with what I was on now and, outside the city, living costs were consider considerably cheaper. Rent in particular.

Layla stared at me contemplatively as she lifted her toast out of the toaster. The sun was flooding in through the kitchen blind behind her, outlining her curly blonde hair with a glowing gold.

“Cool,” she smiled.

I smiled.

It was infectious.

I felt giddy. Light. Lighter than I had done in months.

*This was right,* I thought to myself. Yes, it would be a *big* change that would involve some compromises, but we wouldn't so far away that the people we cared about couldn't visit, or vice versa. I applied later that day, and within a few weeks had been interviewed. It’s embarrassing, but I nearly cried with relief when they offered me the job there and then, before we’d even finished the call. To mask my rising emotions, I bit my lip so hard during the last few minutes of the call that, as I stared at myself in the bathroom mirror afterwards, my face a picture of disbelief, I realised that my bottom lip had turned white. But I’d done it. *I’d got the job.*

The next few weeks passed by in a blur of emails and train station platforms and house viewings. Fitting them in around school and work was tricky, but thankfully, due to everything that had happened, everything that we’d been through, the people we needed - whether that be my boss or the staff at Layla’s school - just seemed happy to help in whatever way they could.

To that end, it felt like we were being buoyed along on a fatalistic wave of positivity; like there was light everywhere.

And I knew too that if Maria, my wife, was still with us in some way, she’d be watching us hop on and off these trains to the coast with a big smile on her face, happy that we were making plans; happy that we weren’t *just* surviving.

But then, in what felt like the blink of an eye, we were running out of time to find a place. The rental market in the town we were moving to was fierce - and with its proximity to the coast, anything that wasn’t taken off the market within a week or two almost instantly became a holiday let. It was just that time of year.

“We need to make a decision!” I stressed, as we left a little two-up, two-down a stone’s throw from the beach. Layla hadn’t liked it.

“It needs to feel like a home,” she said, a note of sorrow in her voice. Tears, like tepid water on ice, cracked the facade of impatience I was projecting.

“You’re right, you’re right,” I soothed, pulling her in close as we wandered back towards the taxi rank. Noticing my phone buzzing in my pocket, I rejected the call, knowing it would be the property agent warning us to take the place we’d just seen. After 10+ viewings, we were - embarrassingly - on first names with most of the local agents.

“Woah…check out that place,” Layla gasped, drifting away from me. She was staring at a beautiful old three-story townhouse, stood on its own small parcel of land between two other similar houses, its austere, wrought-iron gates fixed with a red and white “For Sale” sign.

“Daddy, can you imagine it?” Layla beamed.

I could imagine it. It was *beautiful*. A real picture postcard house.

Buying a property wasn’t even something I’d considered, but I wasn’t averse to the idea. It was the strange thing about where we lived now - we could never have afforded our pokey little three bed flat in the city, but this? Who knows. *Maybe…* I was expecting Maria’s life insurance to payout any day now too.

Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?

The viewing, once I’d arranged it, was kept very hush hush - primarily so that it would be a surprise for Layla. On our way over, I blindfolded her for the entire taxi ride, much to her amusement. Then, I walked her up the unkempt path with my hands over her eyes until, feeling suddenly self-conscious, I found myself glancing up and down the street, my senses telling me that someone was watching me. It was then that I noticed the old lady on the veranda of the house to the left, smiling at me vacantly as she rocked back and forth in her chair.

“Dad, you’re being weird!” Layla chuckled, snapping me back to reality.

“Okay chicken,” I laughed, “and…open your eyes!”

I took my hands away.

Layla took a deep breath.

“What are we doing here?” she mouthed.

“We’re…taking a look…” I smiled coyly.

Waiting for us on the doorstep was Paulie, the house’s agent, a rotund, blond man with a thick neck and a round, pink face. He was dressed all in blue bar the robin red tie around his thick neck, which dangled there like a broken, bloodied length of noose. In his right hand, he clutched a clipboard to his breast. In the other, he held a pale handkerchief and a bunch of keys, which jangled lightly as he dabbed his glistening brow.

“Afternoon both!” he grimaced. “Beautiful weather we’re having!”

I nodded.

“Paulie Toms,” he stated, juggling his clipboard under his armpit so that he could proffer a clammy handshake. “And you must be Layla! Your Dad has told me *all* about you…”

I hadn’t.

Layla smiled politely.

“Excellent, excellent - shall we head in?”

The house itself was a wonderful size. Five large bedrooms split across three floors, two of which were en suite. Downstairs, there was a vast open-plan kitchen-diner with surprisingly modern fittings, as well as two reception rooms, an office space that overlooked the garden and an ornate conservatory, filled with shelves of timeworn, sun-bleached books. Weirder still, it was only *just* outside our budget. It seemed too good to be true.

“I know what you’re going to ask…” Paulie, the agent, chimed in as I ran my finger across the dusty mantel in the dimly-lit lounge. The tall, sun-facing curtains were drawn.

“What’s that?”

“You’re going to ask the same two things everyone else does.”

I smiled in reply, formulating the first question in my head. Walking past Paulie, I noticed a patch of flaking paper on the wall along from the fireplace, where water - or more likely damp - was beading faintly. The first question I would ask formed itself quite quickly. It was, *How long has this place been on the market for?*

“You’re going to ask, how long it’s been listed for,” Paulie grinned at me, needling me with his beady eyes. “Am I right?!”

I couldn’t help but chuckle. “You’ve read my mind!”

“This isn’t my first rodeo!” he tittered. “Which means your second question is…”

“Why hasn’t it sold.”

*“Why hasn’t it sold…”* he repeated circumspectly, as though this was the million dollar question.

Upstairs, I could hear Layla running around exploratively.

“In answer to your first question, about six months. On average, we get an offer on it about once a week, the owner’s estate takes it off the market, all parties start doing the paperwork and then… *poof!”*

“Poof what?”

“Poof as in, we start answering your second question. Surveys happen. The surveys return some…*squiffy* issues, then the buyers pull out. That’s the long and short of it,” he finished.

“And those surveys,” I quiz, “the buyers don’t have to share that information with you, right? And you’re sure as sh-, *poopy*, not going to share it with me?!”

Here, Paulie stepped towards me and, as I had done moments earlier, he reached past me and began picking at the flaking paper on the wall, exposing some of the yellowing drywall beneath.

“I’m gonna be frank with you,” Paulie began earnestly, “for a couple of reasons - the first being that I work on commission. This place doesn’t sell, I don’t get paid. That’s part of it. And by that I mean, in this instance, it’s best if I’m honest with you, as maybe then you make an offer, warts and all, and we move forwards. Flipside, if you think I’m being dishonest with you, you probably *don’t* make an offer and you and your little girl hotfoot it out of here, headed back to the city for more reasons than the obvious.”

Here, Paulie leant in closer, almost conspiratorially so. The house seemed eerily still all of a sudden.

“What do you see?” he asked ambiguously.

I widened my eyes in confusion. “I… I see…” I stared around the high-ceilinged room nonplussed. “I see a…beautiful…old…house?”

Paulie clapped me on the shoulders, grinning at me like a bloodmoon. “Bingo!”

I felt weirdly relieved.

“This is an old house!” he crowed, gesturing enthusiastically. “What you and I see as period, characterful, antique, your average first-time buyer sees as problematic, red flags, *disease*. This,” he raved, scratching at the bit of damp on the wall, “is par for the course - a bit of damp, a bit of mustiness - the odd rattling pipe and missing roof tile - is to be expected in a property of this age and profile.”

It was odd, but I found myself nodding along, mostly in agreement.

“And what’s more - the owners, the estate, they want this place sold. They are,” he paused, inserting a wink here, “amenable to offers that are not, as they put it - their words not mine - *derisory*…”

“That’s interesting,” I added, aiming for sincerity. “Good to know. Thank you, Paulie. You’ve given me - us - lots to think about.”

“Absolutely,” Paulie agreed. “That’s the aim of the game!”

“Excellent. Right. Time to liaise with the boss,” I smiled, nodding at the ceiling. “Let me go see what she’s up to.”

“I’ll be here if you need,” Paulie replied, sliding his phone out of his jacket pocket and dabbing his brow as he parked himself on the ancient leather couch. “Any questions, just ask - take as long as you like!”

Climbing the stairs, I couldn’t help but appreciate his absolute *lack* of tact. He was right, in a lot of senses. Honesty was the best policy. It had won me over a little bit, just like this house had.

Strange, though. I flared my nostrils and inhaled deeply. For the fact there was a bit of damp in the lounge, and probably elsewhere, I couldn’t really smell any, which was probably a good sign.

Above me, through a circular window at the very apex of the house, the pale hues of midday spilled in along blooming shafts of chalky light, directing my way up the stairs as they turned gently towards the floor above, which was much more shadowy. It was there, at the top of the stairs, that I glimpsed a flicker of movement between the bannisters - a disappearing swish of cloth and ankle.

“Oi!” I joked. “Are you going to give me a tour?”

Silence.

“Layla?” I hollered. “Where are you?”

*“I’m on the second floor!”* she called back.

*Bullshit you are,* I thought to myself.

“You’re a bit old for hide-and-seek, aren’t you?” I chuckled, as I reached the top step. Scowling theatrically, I glanced around the first floor. It was an odd layout. Where I was stood, there was something not unlike a mezzanine surrounding the stairwell, with adjoining rooms and corridors jutting off in all directions. Several out-of-reach windows had their curtains drawn and most of the doors were closed, so there wasn’t a lot of light up here, except for that which filtered down in shafts from the circular skylight above.

Hearing the patter of footsteps to my left, I stalked off in that direction, doing my best to be quiet.

“You asked for it,” I whispered under my breath. At the end of the corridor that led to a big, en suite bedroom at the front of the house, I noticed its door was ajar. Treading quietly, I winced as I stepped in something wet on the runner, looking up in time to see Layla dash past the door; which wobbled lightly, as if caught in a faint breeze.

“Gotcha,” I smiled.

Gliding the last few steps on my tiptoes, I burst into the light, sparsely decorated room and shouted “Boo!” - only to find it empty.

*What the fuck?*

The room was bathed in a warm, copper-coloured light that was streaming in through the gaps in the pale curtains.

Then I saw her. Huddled beside the sheetless, mattress-topped bed, I could see a small sliver of undulating shoulder and a crop of dark hair.

I tiptoed towards her…

“BOO!” a voice behind me shrieked, Layla’s hands wrapping themselves around my waist as I jumped out my skin.

“What the-”

My heart was racing.

Arching my neck, I looked round the side of the bed, where there was nothing. Just a yellowed bedside table and some bare floorboards.

“I want to live here, Daddy,” Layla beamed, “I love it. Come see my room!”

“*Your* room?” I chuckled.

“Come see, come see!” she laughed excitedly, yanking at my hand before darting away.

Entering the shadowy corridor, I pulled the door to behind me, feeling the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end as I did so.

My socks were wet through somehow.

*“Dad!!”* Layla yelled. *“Come up!”*

I felt my cheeks flush with embarrassment and happiness as I climbed the winding stairs to the second floor, where Layla - my little ray of hope - was waiting.

And in that moment, putting an offer in seemed like the most obvious thing in the world to do.

So we did.

*And they accepted.*
