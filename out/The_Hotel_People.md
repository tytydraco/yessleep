“You need to be careful around hotel people.” My father warned my little brother Cayden and I. “Some of them are strangers, and others are just *strange*. They don’t all want what’s best for you, and just because they smile doesn’t mean that they’re your friend. Hey…are you kids even listening to me?”

We weren’t. Cayden and I pressed our faces against the glass wall of the elevator, watching the lobby disappear below. It was our first time staying in a big hotel like this, but it wouldn’t be the last–and only years later would I understand the horrific reason why.

My mother had always shown signs of borderline personality disorder, but recently she’d become a danger to herself–and to us. My father, a traveling consultant, was terrified that one day he’d come home to find that she’d gone on a four-day drinking binge and forgotten to feed us, or that she’d drowned my younger brother Cayden in the bathtub during a fit of rage.

He faced the agonizing choice of potentially losing us in a custody battle, or taking us with him on his travels.

At first, it felt like a vacation. We swam in the hyper-chlorinated pool until we were exhausted. We completed the coursework our school sent us in big puffy armchairs beside tinkling fountains and fake plants. At night we sipped vending-machine ginger ale while we surfed through hundreds of channels. When Cayden and I slipped off to sleep beneath our starched white sheets, the last sight we saw was usually our father, still hard at work in the soft glow of the hotel desk lamp, staring at his laptop with a hand on his chin..

Unsurprisingly, the routine got old fast. Once we’d played with all the equipment in the exercise room–once we’d snuck through the kitchens and laundries in the concrete guts of the hotel–there was very little to keep us entertained.

That was how we met *them.* The hotel people.

We mostly played on the second level of the building, which only held conference rooms, the breakfast area, a seating area, and storage. Since no conferences were in session, we pretty much had the place to ourselves–

But it was more than a little creepy.

The dim light that came through the blinds. The silent rows of chairs lined up to face a plastic stage. The vast empty rooms. The stuffy air that smelled of dust and cleaning supplies…

I was running down a hallway of closed doors looking for Cayden when the first one appeared:

*“Pardon me…but what are you doing?”* a voice behind me asked. I gasped and spun around. The speaker stood just a few feet away, although I couldn’t figure out how they’d managed to just *appear* in an empty hallway. Although they were about my height (I was eleven and short for my age), they didn’t *feel* like another kid on vacation. They were too still, whoever they were, and when I looked at them out of the corner of my eye, they didn’t look like a child at *all.*

“Ummm…just playing a game with my brother…” I stammered.

“Oh! *A game!* I *love* games!” their eyes lit up. “Tell me about it.”

“Well, it’s uh, basically like a mix between hide-and-seek and tag…”

“It would be *ever so* thrilling to play with you…” there was something hungry about the way they smiled. I hadn’t heard any footsteps of opening doors, but two more short figures stood behind the first, backlit by the shaded windows. I wondered if these were the *“hotel people”* my father had warned me about. I backed away.

“My dad’s waiting for me,” I replied quickly, “M-maybe another time.” They knew that  I was lying, and their laughter was like the rustle of insects’ wings. I yelled for Cayden, fearing the worst–what if *they*  found him first? Cayden was only eight, and he trusted everybody…

“Never fear\*…”\* the voice from behind me suddenly became so loud it seemed to shake the hallway. *“WE’LL BE WAITING.”*  I was running as hard as I could down the carpeted corridor, but it only seemed to get longer.

I threw open doors left and right. An empty ballroom filled with ghostlike cloth-covered tables. A janitor’s closet. Another conference room…

Something small and dark moved beneath the plastic chairs.

*“CAYDEN!”* I screeched. For a second, the shadowy shape hesitated. “It’s dad–we gotta go!” My little brother moved uncertainly into the light of the open doorway, shielding his eyes against its brightness. “There’s these ki–”

I spun around. The hallway was empty.

“What’s your *problem?!*” Cayden whined. “There’s nobody here! You’re just mad ‘cuz you couldn’t find me, huh? *You ruined the game!”* Cayden pretended to be mad, but I could tell by rugburn on his cheek that he’d fallen asleep in his hiding spot. I checked my plastic watch. It was almost six o’clock.

“C’mon, Cayden.” I sighed. “We gotta go get ready for dinner…”

The money that companies gave my father for dinner was enough to feed the three of us lunch and dinner–if we kept it cheap. In the Christmas-light glow of a gas-station taco truck with chorizo and onion dribbling down my chin, what I’d seen in the hotel felt like a dream. Some instinct warned me against telling my father about the strange encounter. *What if he got worried and kept us locked up in the room all day?* At eleven years old, I couldn’t imagine a worse fate.

Nevertheless, I breathed a sigh of relief when he told us that tomorrow, we’d be on our way to a new city–and a new hotel.

But the nightmare was just beginning.
