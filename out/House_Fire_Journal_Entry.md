Here's that journal entry by my pastor cousin you wanted me to post. The one acknowledging the housefire.

“Just tell me the truth, not looking for anything more,” I told him as I poured the can of gasoline around his restrained feet and the chair he sat on.

“This is madness! What are you doing!” He shouted at me in an unusually loud fashion, definitely an attempt to attract outside attention. Unfortunately for him, I spent the last day sound-proofing my basement. Not going to give him the satisfaction of playing the game, I let him continue, “If this is a prank, it's gone way too far!” It really hasn’t. I believe this is as tame as the stunts he's been pulling on me for the past week. I guess I let my emotions get to me because I spoke again.

“On the first day, I caught you reading every can of food I had.”

“You know I’m worried about my cholesterol!”

“On the second day, you were playing with a lighter, for hours on end.”

“I was trying to see if it needed more fuel!”

“On the next three days, the cameras saw you watching over our beds.” My words started tuning themselves as if I was singing.

“Sam, please! You know I sleepwalk! Let me go. I’m scared, Sam.” I am not going to fall for alligator tears, not again at least.

“On the sixth day! On the sixth!” I was smiling now, flicking my lighter in front of him. “On the sixth day, I watched you pull on your face like a mask. Suddenly, later that day, my wife, my faithful wife Donna, vanished into thin air.” Tears were streaming like Niagara off his face now.

“I know you're upset, Sam. But, please, let me go.”

“And on the seventh day, I killed you.”

“Stop this!”

“Oh you poor soul, if you even have a soul. You vile creature, today is the eighth day, I killed you yesterday.”

“What,” he said, voice muffled from his hand wiping fluids from his upper lip.

“That's right!” I’m quite proud of what happened next. It must have looked like a production from his perspective. All he saw was me marching up the steps beyond his view, and then his lifeless body thrown down the stairs like a loose bag of jell-o. “Oh my goodness gracious! What is this! Two of you! That can’t be possible.”

“I gave you plenty of chances to-” I cut him off by throwing one of the body’s shoes at his nose.

“Why do you keep coming back? You slimy-” He cut me off this time, with a screech comparable to a dog whistle. He promptly lifted his head towards the sky and regurgitated his interior from his skin as if pulling ground beef from a wet rubber sleeping bag. I would like to say I threw the lighter at him, but in my astonishment I had simply dropped it at his feet. The flames burst from the ground, swallowing the chair and his body. But, like a resurfaced whale, his fleshy interior rose above the flames before sliding across the ceiling away from me. His flame-engulfed skin drooped like a deflating balloon. The snake of red, soggy oatmeal slithered farther into the basement. 

With haste, I sprinted up the stairs, out the front door, and down the street. I watched as my house burned down. As a sigh of relief left my gut, a hand touched my shoulder.

“Lord have mercy Sam! Did I leave the burner on?! I only left for a few minutes!” He whimpered like a child who broke a window.
