I think it's about time I share my own experience with paranormal entities. Though it's not as intence as grandfather's encounters,it isn't very normal either.

I'm from West Bengal, India. I live in a town near Kolkata, although the incident took place in my grandparents village. This incident occurred in 2021, when I went to their place during vacations.

There is a local folk Lore about the man eating demons called Pishach(Ghouls) in our village. It is said that they live in graveyards and eat the flesh of dead humans who didn't live a righteous life. But sometimes they take form of a beautiful woman or a crying child to attract people at night and eat them alive. 

It's a pretty well known story, we have been hearing it since childhood. Though I personally didn't believe it. Jinns exist but they can't hurt humans in normal circumstances. 

One day I went to see a performance in a neighbouring village with my friend Arman.By the time the performance ended it was almost midnight. We started coming back home. On the way back we had to cross an old graveyard. It was one of the biggest paranormal hotspots in our village. We were talking about the performance the whole time until we reached the graveyard. Both of us became silent. We have crossed this road many times. But never this late at night.

Our body felt heavy as we crossed it. Every noise felt paranormal. Each step felt slower than the last. Suddenly we heard a faint noise. As we walked down the road the sound became louder and clearer. It was the cry of a child. Ofcourse! We just HAD to run into a ghoul! I felt like crying. I looked beside me. Arman was just as scared. The most terrifying thing is the fact that we heard it means it already knows about our presence. 

As we slowly went closer to the sound. We saw a child about 1-2 years old crying beside the road. We did not approach it. We didn't even directly look at it. As we walked by it my eyes started tearing up. Each and every cell in my body told me to RUN! I bearly managed to keep my sanity. I would have probably passed out if I was alone. As we went past it the crying became louder and louder. To the point I felt like my eardrum would burst. Once we were about 20 meters away from it, the crying stopped. I could not longer control my body. I ended up looking back. And... I saw nothing. It was gone. There wasn't any sign of it around.

I took a deep breath. My heart felt lighter. Arman looked at me. He was also relieved. But before we could say a single sentence we heard a demonic scream. It came from the graveyard. That was the last straw. We ran as fast as we could. I could feel my consciousness sliping away. We did not stop running until we reached our village. There were few people sitting beside a campfire playing cards. The moment we saw them I became unconscious. 

I wake up in my grandparents home. Arman had already woken up. He told them everything. I confermed his claims. We saw a Pishach. We really did. Some believed us and some didn't. I got an earful from my grandmother. Well it's been 4 years since that incident. We still talk about it when I go back to the village during vacations. I still wonder what would have happened if I had been alone at that time. Maybe I wouldn't be here telling you guys this incident. But one thing is for sure... I'm never using that road at night ever again.
