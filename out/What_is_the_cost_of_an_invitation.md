Once my friends and me decided to celebrate the end of the academic year. The last semester was tough and all of us were very happy when Gabriella has invited us to her family summer house. I was so amazed by the natural beauty that was surrounding our place for the next couple of days. The house was located right on the wide river’s bank, on the other shore you could see the lights of small village and total silence around, except croaking frogs and cricket chirping. As i was quite depressed lately, it was such a relief just to be there. 

It was only six of us there, Gabriella and her boyfriend Ulrich, our classmates Eliot and Sabrina, Sabrina’s brother Tyler and me. We didn’t really want to have a huge party, just to breath out after studying, swim and chill. 

It was already sunset when we finally got to the place. I could see what felt like the whole sky colored in all shades of pink and purple. Everything was quite, lights started to appear on the other side of the river. The house had two main outside areas – the pier leading to the river and small green playground with swings and fire pit. 

\-Okay guys come here just for a sec – Gabi called us – Please feel yourself like home. Everything is safe here, you can go swimming in the night or go for a walk, there are no any animals or insects that could be a threat. If we ran out of alcohol you can find it in the basement, your rooms are already prepared, Ulrich will show you them. Please be conscious about the rests of the food that you leave outside, we have many street cats here, I do not them to be hurt. Yeah, this is it, I think we can start the fire and eat something. 

\-Gabi, will you tell about the guests? 

\-Oh yes, almost forgot. So, for the whole weekend we are alone here. My family is travelling so no one will bother us. I ask you not invite anyone inside of the house. 

\-Are there many people leaving here to organize bigger party? – Eliot asked with hope. 

\-No, there are no many inhabitants in this village and mainly old folks. Just please I really ask you to be serious about it. No one except us should not be invited to the house. Okay? Tyler?

\-Got it! – shouted Tyler getting rid of his clothes to jump in the river. 

We followed Ulrich inside the house. All our bedrooms were at the second floor, that was quite nice. It kinds felt that it is just summer house: there were no many things around, all rooms have only beds and sometimes small closets. Not the case for studying or remote work. In the corridor between the rooms there was more storage space, but everything was hidden in the drawers. In one of the walls there was sheet, covering what could be recognized as photo frames, but I am not sure. 

Someone downstairs turned on the music (quite loud), Sabrina and Eliot ran by in the swimming suits. Our small party has begun. 

\*\*\*

Even though we didn’t really plan to have a party, exhaustion has hit us and we became quite drunk. By the moment I could escape to the pear everything became quite calm. Except for the moans from the basement… Eliot and Sabrina didn’t really care much, I guess. Gabi felt sick and Ulrich followed her to the bed. So I could finally enjoy the silence and calm water. 

\-Hi! My name is Amanda. Do you want to be friends? – I heard the kid’s voice behind my back. I turned around and saw a girl looking 6-7 years old. 

\-Hi! What are you doing here that late? It must be way far after midnight! – I was very surprised. 

\-I am looking for new friends. I watched you the whole evening, your friends are nice. Do you think they would like to play with me? 

\-Look, this is quite late, I assume your parents are frightened not being able to find you in your bed. Let’s walk you home. Where do you live?

\-I used to live here – said the girl pointing out at our temporal house. 

\-Okay, but where do you live now? 

\-I don’t have home now. 

This is when I have realized that my calm enjoyment the water is not happening soon. After several attempts to find out where her home is I have decided to go inside. Night started to be chilly and I was sure Gabi should have known girl’s parents. 

\-Okay, give me your hand, let’s go. 

We were on our way to the house, when we have heard the conversation in the yard. 

\-Look, it is private property, you really should leave, man. – Tyler sounded annoyed. He was quite high and couldn’t wait to rest. I have seen who he was talking to. An old man was sitting on a swig not paying attention at all.  – Oh, Stefanie, you also found a stranger! Now they can leave together. 

\-Calm down, Tyler. Excuse me, sir, do you know this little girl by any chance? – I asked, but immediately got an answer – she ran to the swig and set next to the old man, kissed him inn the right cheek. 

\-Okay nice, now you should leave. Both. – Tyler’s annoyance was growing. I can get it, he had an exam the same day and I can imagine didn’t sleep for quite a long time already. 

\-Don’t you think that may be we should offer them tea or at least a blanket? Night is not the warmest – whispered I. 

\-Oh no, Stef, I really want to sleep and I really want them to go. I do not see the reason to break Gabi’s rules. 

I watched him walking old man and girl outside the territory. Not the most pleasant to kick people out during the night, but to be fair, I also really wanted to sleep. 

Me and Tyler were sleeping in the same room. I was almost asleep and he just left the shower, when we have heard the shouting from the first floor. We rushed there. 

\-If you don’t leave right know I am calling the police! Do you hear me? I am calling the police! – Eliot was standing in his underwear only opposite to floor-to-ceiling window. I couldn’t understand whether he is angry or frightened. 

There was glare on the window so I didn’t notice the cause of his reaction from the beginning. Right opposite to Eliot, behind the window there was a man. He was standing calm. Not blinking, just staring at my friend. He was holding baseball bat and just watching at us.

\-Hey guys it is okay, don’t worry. – Ulrich went downstairs right after me – It is fine, he will go away soon. Don’t worry, we are totally safe here, there is no way he can get in. We can just go to sleep. 

\-Hey man what the fuck? He was there standing and watching me naked. Who is he? Some kind of local pervert? – Eliot was freaked out. 

\- Calm down, El. Let’s just go to sleep and that it okay? I swear it will be fine. 

After a while all of us just agreed to go. The guy outside looked creepy, but Ulrich have been here so many times, I would trust him. Who knows these places. And none of us had any energy to deal with it now. 

\*\*\*

\-Stef, Stef, wake up!

I opened my eyes and saw Sabrina’s frightened face.

\-Stef, I think I have made the mistake! She was so small alone, I thought something happened to her I didn’t want to wake everyone up I though maybe I just… - she started to cry. 

\-Wait, slow down. What happened? What did you do?

\-I went downstairs for glass of water. – Sabrina was sniffling – I saw the small girl outside, she was looking and me and I…. I ….

\-What did you do? – thoughts started to run in my head and the wave of fear covered me. 

\- I invited her in. 

I immediately woke up. We rushed downstairs. 

The room looked a bit different than before. There was much more light and it looked more lively somehow. In the middle of the room there was a big table and I have seen the family having dinner. Amanda and old man was there, I have also recognized the creepy guy sitting with his back to me. 

\-Oh our guests finally! Come here, please join us at the table. We have very nice dinner today. 

The horror was running inside of my veins. 

\-What did you do? – I have heard totally frightened voice of Gabi behind me.

We slowly went to the table. The shole family was starring at us silently with very wide smiles on their faces. We just quietly followed their invitation.

\-Sorry, we already started without you. – woman that looked like mother of the family looked at me taking the knife – What would you like? Breast or thigh? 

There was a huge long covered plate on the table. My mouth was so dry I couldn’t talk. Gabi was crying, Ulrich looked frightened. 

\-Are they your relatives? – whispered I. Gabi ignored my question, but started crying even more. 

\-Okay, I think the thigh will be tastier – said the women. 

At this moment I have realized there were no plated on the table. Each member of the family was just eating with their hands. 

The women opened the plate. My whole body was frozen. 

In the middle of the table our dinner was lying. Even the blood was everywhere and my eyes were full of tears I could recognize. 

Eliot. 

\*\*\*

I opened my eyes. 

\-Please stop the car!

I escaped the car and vomited. The scenery was amazing around and everyone was cheerful. 

\-Oh no Stef, we didn’t even start drinking! – Tyler jokes were stupid as fuck. 

\-I am sorry, I just had a nightmare. 

\-We almost there, let’s go. – Ulrich turned on ignition. 

We came to the house that I have just seen in my dream.

\-Hi dear! – a woman was rushing from the house towards Gabi. She kissed her in the cheek and looked at us – Please guys come inside, feel like you at home. 

It was a sunny day and we were quite tired. I was disturbed.

As soon as i crossed the threshold I have realized why. The girl from my dream was sitting in the couch. The woman was was greeting us was also from my dream. I have just realized that Eliot wasn’t with us in the car. I ran upstairs. There were many photos on the wall, all with the family that I have seen in my dream, with the same people who were downstairs. Am I going crazy?

\-Please relax and prepare for the dinner. I am sure it will be as good as yesterday. – said the women turning at mean with evil smile at her face. 

I looked at Gabi. Her eyes were full of tears. 

\-I told you never let them in – she whispered. 

\-We should leave immediately! – screamed I in horror. I ran to the door, but there was no handle there. I checked the windows – there wasn’t anything to open it. Gabi was shaking her head:

\-We were invited. And we received the invitation. There is no way out from here anymore. We can’t leave. I told you...

\-Dinner is an hour!
