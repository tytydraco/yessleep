I hate Christmas Eve. It’s a night I dread three hundred and sixty-four days out of the year. Not because I’m a grinch, far from it. Once upon a time, I reveled in the Christmas spirit. I’d marvel at the holiday decorations and bask in the warm glow of the season. As a kid I was a true believer, but that all changed when I turned nine.

That was the year I was determined to meet Santa. My plan was simple: camouflage myself under the tree and jump out to give him a hug when he brought me presents. I’d even baked him a special batch of cookies with cream cheese frosting and sleigh-shaped sprinkles.

On Christmas Eve I set my plan into action. After my parents went to sleep, I tip-toed to the living room. Reaching into the broom closet, I retrieved a decoy gift box. It was hollow and bottomless, with a small peephole. From the outside, it looked like a normal wrapped present, but it was my super secret hiding place. Heart fluttering with excitement, I nestled under the tree, placed the box over me, and lay in wait.

Inside the box, it was warm and toasty. I’d even set up a blanket and pillow to maximize comfort. It must have been too cozy because within thirty minutes I was fast asleep, waking hours later to the sound of a booming thud echoing from the fireplace.

It was dark and my eyes hadn’t adjusted yet, but I could make out the outline of a hulking figure crawling out of the flue. When they stood up, their head scraped against the ceiling. Whom I presumed to be Santa shuffled over to the warm milk my parents had left out on the counter. They snatched it up and finished it in a single swig.

As my eyes adjusted, I noticed a few strange things: Santa’s clothes were ragged, torn, and stained with fluids; his limbs were skeletal and bent in unusual directions; his trademark beard was unkempt and stained red.

“Still hungry?” What I assumed to be an elf hopped down from Santa’s shoulders. It didn’t look like the elves I’d seen on TV, most noticeably, fangs that dipped below its chin.

Santa grunted in response, nodding his massive head up and down. He licked his lips with ravenous intent.

“I smell a young child — somewhere around ten years old,” the elf began to sniff the air rapidly with his crooked nose, “Oh and he’s definitely chubby. Should be a juicy little morsel.”

The glow of the lights wrapped around the tree illuminated the wicked smile that crossed Santa’s face. Rows of razor-sharp teeth peeked behind his thin lips.

I was trembling with fear, my young mind struggling to process what I saw. My excitement had faded. All I wanted for Christmas was to remain unseen. Santa was not what I expected; he was a monster.

Despite his size, Santa moved in silence as he slipped up the stairs toward my room. The elf followed behind like a loyal dog. Floorboards creaked above as they searched fruitlessly. A few minutes later they returned.

Santa’s face was twisted in rage. His elf looked frightened, a fresh gash on his forehead.

“I promise we will find him. The scent is fresh, the boy is still here. He’s hiding from us. I’m sure of it.”

Plopping onto the couch, Santa extended his spindly legs. Bones audibly snapped as he flexed them. Letting out an exasperated groan, he straightened his red hat that was covered in grime.

The elf fell on all fours and inhaled deeply, pressing his nose to the floor. A sly grin crossed his face as he traversed the living room. Traveling in a large circle, he honed in on the tree.

I held my breath as he drew closer. Through the peephole, I could see his beady little eyes widening with excitement. It reminded me of a starving animal who’d just found a meal.

“Over here,” the elf called out, “the little bastard is hiding in the tree!”

Roaring with delight, Santa leaped onto his feet. Drips of saliva ran down his mouth. With shocking ease, he picked up the tree and began shaking it. Ornament and pine needles rained down onto the carpet. The star that adorned the top fell onto my box, creating a small tear.

Upon realizing he hadn’t found my hiding spot, Santa howled with rage. The elf shuffled away from his master. A pile of excrement fell from his rear end. “I swear he’s right around here. Maybe he’s in one of the —“

Before he could finish Santa clamped on his neck and lifted him off the ground. Fingers tipped with sharp nails curled around his neck. The elf squirmed helplessly.

“Klaus, don’t do this. We’ll find the boy. Give me a bit more time. The night is still young.” The wretched elf squealed pitifully.

Santa’s jaw quivered. As it slid from side to side, it widened to an enormous length. A putrid smell filled the air. In a single fluid motion, Santa shoved the elf into his gullet. The screams of agony were indescribable.

Blood poured down Santa’s already stained clothing. His red jacket became even redder. Letting out a satisfied burp, he pulled a femur from his mouth and used it to pick his teeth.

Unable to control myself, I let out a small cry. It was as quiet as a mouse, but as soon as it happened, Santa locked onto my box. His lips curled into a menacing frown.

Pushing aside the fallen tree, he peered down at my hiding place. I remained absolutely still, frozen with fear. Santa’s jaw chattered. His teeth grinding against one another. The sound sent shivers down my spine.

Rearing back his leg, Santa kicked the box with a powerful blow. It sent me flying, colliding with the wall. I spilled onto the floor sprawled on my back.

Santa towered over me. He peered down with wild eyes, fresh blood still flowing from his mouth. Seeing him clearly for the first time, he was more horrifying than I had even thought.

His face was dotted with scars and crude stitches. Steel blue eyes bulged outwards. A portly belly hung over his otherwise stick-thin frame. His skin was grey and emaciated, barely covering his bones.

I closed my eyes and counted to three, hoping this was a bad dream I could awake from — but no such relief came. This was real, all too real.

Bending down, Santa took a whiff of me. Pausing for a moment, a grotesque tongue unfurled from his mouth. Grabbing my left leg, he licked it furiously. The smell of death wafted from his mouth. His jaw began to quiver once again, widening as it had when he swallowed the elf.

I was helpless as he began dragging me into his mouth. My legs scraped against his teeth, and in a split second, I was halfway swallowed.

As this was happening, I caught a glint in the corner of my eye. The blinking Christmas lights were reflecting off the tree topper. The star of Bethlehem had never shone so bright. My arm extended as far I could reach and was barely able to grasp it. Screaming with unbridled emotions, I plunged the tip of the star into Santa’s neck.

Wailing like a banshee, Santa spit me out of his mouth. I tried to crawl away, but he stomped onto my left leg with his boot, pinning me in place. Face twisted in furious anger, Santa pulled the Star from his neck. A fountain of blood accompanied its removal.

Still wailing, Santa plucked from the ground like a ragdoll. His jaw widened again. I hovered over his pulsating mouth, gagging at the smell. Kicking and screaming, I was unable to stop my descent. As the saliva lapped against my head, a booming voice echoed from upstairs.

“Richard Sanderson Carver! You better not be doing what I think you’re doing,” my father yelled as he plodded down the stairs.

Upon hearing this, Santa dropped me to the ground. Hissing like a wounded cat, Santa fled towards the chimney. His body flattened and Santa disappeared into the fireplace — a puff of ash the only thing left in his wake.

The last thing I remember before blacking out was my father screaming “what have you done!” with a look of disapproval and worry.

Of course, no one believed the story I told the next day. After several months I stopped telling it all together, tired of the parade of hospitals and therapists I was sent to. Once I began to tell a different story, I was ‘cured’ and diagnosed with a bout of stress-induced mania. One therapist said certain children couldn’t handle the anticipation of opening presents, which could lead to temporary insanity. I wondered how many children diagnosed in the same manner had experienced the horrors of Santa.

The following Christmas Eve, I hid again. As well as the one after that, and the one after that, and so on and so forth. I’m almost thirty now, and I still hide — because he’s never stopped coming back.

Then, the best and worst thing happened to me. This year had my first child, just a month before the holidays. This week, I noticed a present I hadn’t placed under the tree. It was wrapped neatly with a crimson bow. I tore the present open. Inside, a blood-stained star with a letter sitting on top.

*“Ho, Ho, Ho. If Santa can’t have you, he’ll fly down the flue, and eat what’s brand new. Merry Christmas, from my stomach to you.”*
