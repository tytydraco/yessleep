Emily was so excited about her high school reunion. She spent the whole week leading up to it digging through old photos, reminiscing about friends, wondering who had changed the most.

It was a two-hour drive, so I expected her to check in, maybe send me a few pictures of old friends. But when I didn’t hear from her all night, I started to worry.

At 2 AM, she finally called.

She was crying.

“They didn’t recognize me,” she whispered.

I sat up in bed, instantly alert. “What do you mean?”

“They thought I was dead.”

She got home at dawn, pale and shaking.

I made her tea, sat her down, and tried to get the full story.

When she arrived at the reunion, she expected nostalgia, hugs, maybe some awkward small talk.

Instead, she got blank stares.

People whispered behind her back. Some avoided her completely.

Then, halfway through the night, an old friend—Sarah—finally approached her.

And the first thing she said was, “This isn’t funny.”

Emily laughed nervously. “What do you mean?”

Sarah’s face twisted in anger.

“You died, Emily.”

It wasn’t a joke.

Sarah pulled out her phone, scrolling through an old memorial page.

Emily’s face stared back at her.

A tribute post. Dozens of comments. Photos from her teenage years, classmates sharing memories.

A funeral date.

Everything.

Emily nearly fainted.

“I don’t understand,” she told Sarah. “I’m standing right here.”

Sarah backed away like she had seen a ghost.

“That’s not possible,” she whispered.

Emily showed them her driver’s license. Her ID. Pulled up her Facebook profile.

But her name, her records, everything from before the accident was gone.

One of the teachers even called Emily’s parents. They didn’t answer.

When she left the reunion, no one said goodbye.

They just watched her like she was something that shouldn’t exist.

We spent the whole morning researching.

The page was real. The comments were real. People had mourned her.

According to the internet, Emily Roberts died in a car accident when she was 18.

A hit-and-run.

She had no memory of this. Her family never mentioned it.

So we called them.

Her mother answered on the first ring.

Before Emily could say a word, her mother burst into tears.

“Sweetheart, please… stop calling us.”

Emily went pale. “Mom, what are you talking about?”

Her mother just sobbed.

“Whoever you are, please stop pretending to be my daughter.”

The line went dead.

I watched Emily break in front of me.

She wasn’t hysterical. She didn’t cry. She just stared ahead at nothing, like her mind couldn’t process what was happening.

I tried to tell her there had to be a mistake.

But I knew that wasn’t true.

Because I had started to notice something was wrong.

Her photos—old ones, from childhood—had vanished from my phone.

Her birth certificate was missing from our documents.

And when I went to look at our marriage license, my hands shaking—

Her name wasn’t on it.

There was just my signature.

A blank space where hers should have been.

Emily hasn’t spoken in hours.

She just sits on the couch, staring at nothing.

I don’t know what to do.

Because if my wife really isn’t Emily Roberts…

Then who the hell have I been married to for the past five years?
