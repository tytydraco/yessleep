Daniel was a finder, which was the most important job. Without Daniel, Group 5 would not survive in the wilderness. 

This is what Daniel told himself as he struggled through the underbrush, eyes keen for food to forage. His belt bag already held some wild green apples, small and more sour than sweet.

Group 5 had three people. Three hungry people. The finder, the mapper, and the killer. 

George the mapper had said there was a good fishing pond in this area. He hadn’t steered Daniel wrong yet. 

Mosquitoes buzzed in the finder’s ears. He sighed audibly, something he would never do in front of the others. They would undoubtedly quote Rule 3, **The lucky ones should never complain.** Daniel hated Rule 3.

After a while he finally found the pond. It was smaller than he expected. The finder rolled up his sleeves and took out a makeshift net, wading into the murky water.

As he was cornering a fat little fish he heard a whisper from the trees above him. He froze, heart pounding. He clutched the net nervously as he slowly looked up. 

An unlucky one. It was crouched in a branch, so covered in mud and leaves that it almost blended into the tree. The whites of its eyes were all that allowed Daniel to see it. 

He stood stock still, remembering Rule 1. **the lucky ones must never respond to an unlucky one.** No matter what it said, he couldn’t speak back to it. 

He was afraid to blink, lest it suddenly jump out, or worse, disappear. Then he wouldn’t know when it was watching him. 

This wasn’t Daniel’s first run in with an unlucky one. When he was little and still in training he had seen one, through a chain link fence. That one had been dirty too, with long knots of matted hair. 

It had kept asking two questions. “Do you speak English?” And “How many of you are there?” He had not forgotten his training then either, and simply stared back. He had gotten fruit as a reward for that. 

The unlucky one in the tree whispered again, this time loudly enough for Daniel to hear. “Are you alone?” 

He made a decision, then. He started to run, splashing out of the pond back in the direction he came from. He heard a grunt and the sound of foliage quickly moving behind him. *It’s following me.* 

Daniel ran faster, clutching the bag of apples like a lifeline. The fishing net he had dropped back at the pond.

He heard it speak again, right on his heels. The voice was hoarse and ragged, a shout this time. “Listen to me! We need your help! The survivors all need to come together. . .”

Daniel didn’t register the rest, he had finally spotted Group 5. George was crouched over a fire and Kate was emerging from the tent. 

He knew what to do, every lucky one had been taught the signal. He threw back his head and howled, still running as fast as his feet could carry him. 

Kate snapped into action, heading his way in a full sprint. He heard the unlucky one whimper behind him and stopped hearing sounds of pursuit. 

As Daniel and Kate crossed paths, he breathed a sigh of relief. She would deal with it now. 

It was ten minutes before he and George heard the telltale sound of a gunshot. 

“That one took a while.” George was drawing up a new map, his brow furrowed in concentration. 

“I think I lost my fishing net.” Daniel said absently. 

When Kate returned he would have to go and retrieve it. 

Without that net, he could not do his job, and his was the most important job. Without the finder, Group 5 would not survive in the wilderness.
