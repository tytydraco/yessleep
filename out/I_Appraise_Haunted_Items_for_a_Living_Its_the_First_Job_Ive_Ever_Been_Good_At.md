The sign outside **Obscura** was impossible to miss - a flickering relic of a carnival that never existed, neon buzzing and gold leaf peeling, letters twisting in a font that looked like it had been designed by someone in the middle of a fever dream. It read:

**BUY, SELL & TRADE YOUR HAUNTED ITEMS**

Around it, shadow and light picked out figures that shouldn’t have moved - a snake coiled around an ornate **B**, a demon’s face mid-laugh. All manner of cryptid motifs. The whole thing hummed faintly. Like a beehive you shouldn’t stand too close to.

The display window was different every week. This time it held a yellowed wedding gown, the lace at its hem stiff and brown-stained, as though the bride had walked through mud — or something thicker. Beside it, a baby carriage sat empty, rocking gently even though the summer air outside was dead still. A grandfather clock loomed over it all, pendulum swaying at a slow, deliberate pace that didn’t quite match the tick.

Inside, it was less a pawn shop and more an antique store that had stumbled out of a circus tent and decided to die in a strip club. Red velvet curtains sagged heavy with dust. Lamps shaped like swans and devils cast a sickly gold light across glass cases. Shelves bowed under the weight of porcelain dolls whose eyes seemed to follow you only in your peripheral vision, music boxes with cracked enamel faces, and oil paintings that seemed to hum when you weren’t looking directly.

The air was thick with something floral, the shop was adorned with vases full of flowers but even then, it was something intense, perfume was another smell and - if you breathed deep enough - something faintly metallic, like the inside of a cut.

Miss Mallory, the owner, dressed like the shop itself: fur coat heavy on her narrow shoulders, ash-blonde hair pinned up just so, jewelry clicking when she moved. She wasn’t always here, but lately she’d taken to hanging around more often. I figured the shop was just her current amusement. A stage, and she liked to see what wandered in.

Most customers came with stories. Sometimes they swore their things were haunted because it made for a better sale.

Someone had once come in with what you’re likely picturing a haunted doll looks like. While, I’ll admit, it was expertly revamped, it was just a doll made to trick. An excellent prop for a haunted house.

Sometimes items are brought in because they were old enough to *feel* haunted or look like they should be. Not every brass locket or faded camera had the goods.

There are times we don’t even buy items if the activity doesn’t seem substantial enough.

When we do, they usually go on the shelf with a price tag that dared the next buyer to take them home.

The real ones - the truly cursed things - were different. We don’t *actually* get a whole lot of those. But we got something like that today. I’ve been waiting for something like this to come up. Felt it would be pointless posting without an example.

Around three o’clock today, the bell over the door rattled as a man stepped inside. Fifties, maybe, but worn thin in a way that made guessing hard. His coat was frayed at the cuffs, his shoes uneven in their wear, and he carried a wooden box like he was afraid it might break, or bite.

He came straight to the counter without looking around.

“Sellin’?” I asked.

He nodded once, voice dry when he spoke. “Don’t want it. Don’t want to see it again.”

He placed a wooden jewelry box on the counter with surprising care. The lacquer was peeling, every inch carved with roses and cherubs.

“Family piece?” I asked.

His throat worked before he spoke. “My mother’s. She… she kept it locked. Always.” He paused. “I don’t open it anymore.”

“May I?”

A nod.

The clasp clicked under my thumb. Inside, faded red velvet, a handful of tarnished hooks, and an oval mirror set into the lid.

“Hang on.” I turned and called toward the side counter. “Jaque? Ballpark me.”

Jaque shuffled over, took one glance, and hummed low in his throat. “Mid-19th century. Wear’s consistent with age, wood’s in better condition than the hinges. Velvet’s faded, probably sun damage. If it weren’t for the corrosion on the clasp, I’d say eight hundred easy. With it…” He shrugged. “Six?”

I peered into the glass again.

And behind me — a man’s silhouette.

It didn’t move when I did. It hovered in place, fuzzy as smoke caught under glass.

That familiar prickle crawled over my skin, something low and electric humming in my chest.

“Seven hundred,” I said finally.

The man’s head snapped up. “That much?”

“Good craftsmanship,” I replied evenly. “And… I like the piece.”

He signed the papers like someone waking from a bad dream. As soon as the money touched his palm, he left - quickly.

I picked up the box, its weight warm in my hands, and headed toward the back. Passing the shop’s mirror wall, I caught a flicker - like someone moving just behind me. Too slow for a trick of the light, too fast to catch details.

I ignored it. Sometimes you *feel* someone walking behind you in here. You just… don’t turn around.

The beaded curtain swayed as I pushed through into the warmer, dustier backroom. The scent of Mallory’s perfume lingered like a signature. She was seated at the sorting table, a brass astrolabe in her hands, turning it slowly like there was some detail she was set on finding.

“Pretty piece,” she said when I set the box down.

“Mid-19th century,” I said. “Some damage, but it’ll clean up well.”

Her painted mouth curved. “And the seller?”

“Seemed eager to part with it. Didn’t ask questions.”

“Good.” She brushed a hand along the box’s carvings. “You’re getting better at finding the ones worth keeping.”

I shrugged like it didn’t matter, though I felt the warmth of the praise all the same.

When I moved to take it to the storage shelves, Mallory stopped me with a raised finger. “Hold on. Look.”

I was doing my best not to. The figure in the jewelry box’s mirror seemed oddly out of place - too still, too certain. If I didn’t focus, I didn’t have to register it.

But Miss Mallory’s gaze flicked to the reflection too, and her grin deepened as she pointed it out. “You’re ignoring it,” she said quietly, almost amused.

I shrugged, accustomed to that feeling by now - the sense of someone watching, walking just behind, always there but unseen. It was ever-present in the shop, after all.

It lessened when I left so I could handle it while here.

I turned to place the box on the storage shelves, but Miss Mallory’s hand shot out, steadying it.

“No,” she said softly, eyes gleaming. “This one comes with me.”

Her smile was sharp, satisfied. Like a collector claiming a prized gem.

I blinked, halfway through a protest, but she was already lifting the box and tucking it under her arm, the carvings pressing against her fur coat.

She reached into the drawer and pulled out a pastel candy - pale blue, fizzing slightly at the edges.

“Open,” she said, holding it just before my lips.

I did, without hesitation. I don’t know where the fuck she gets these candies but my god, they are *something else*. 

The sweet, sharp fizz blossomed on my tongue.

That was one of the best parts about working here. The recognition of a job well done.

She turned and left with the box, and I was left standing there, the buzzing in my chest settling into something steady.

Everywhere else, I’m cursed. Here though, that curse becomes a talent.
