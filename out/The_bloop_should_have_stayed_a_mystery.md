I was the marine biologist on the Nautilus, a deep-sea research vessel tasked with mapping a portion of the Pacific Ocean no one had ever studied before. Our mission wasn’t glamorous—count species, sample sediments, record environmental data. It was science at its driest. But when we picked up the Bloop, everything changed.
The Bloop, if you’ve never heard of it, is the loudest underwater sound ever recorded. NOAA first detected it in 1997. It was too organic to be tectonic activity, too loud to be anything alive—at least, anything we know about. Scientists have argued for decades, but no one agrees on its source.

Until we found it.

We were almost a month into the expedition when the hydrophone array picked up a sound so low and resonant it rattled our equipment. At first, we thought it was interference—static, maybe a fault in the system. But the more we listened, the more it became clear: it wasn’t random noise. It was a pattern. Rhythmic. Purposeful. Almost like… singing.

“Is that… the Bloop?” whispered Maya, our lead acoustician.

“It’s… close,” I replied, staring at the waveforms dancing on her monitor. “But it’s not the same. It’s deeper. Slower.”

“And it’s moving,” she added, her voice tight.

That was the part that chilled me. Whatever was producing the sound wasn’t stationary. It was traveling—westward, along the ocean floor. And it was massive. We estimated it was at least 150 miles away, but the vibrations still reverberated through the ship like distant thunder.

The Bloop wasn’t just a sound. It was a call.

We should have turned back. But curiosity is a cruel master, and our crew was no exception. The more we heard, the more obsessed we became. The sound grew louder every day, its patterns more intricate, more deliberate. It wasn’t random noise; it was communication.

We deployed an ROV—a remotely operated vehicle—to follow the source. It descended into the darkness, its floodlights slicing through the black like a knife. At first, all we saw was silt and jagged rock formations. Then the seafloor began to change.

The first thing we noticed were the structures. Stone pillars, impossibly smooth and geometric, jutting from the seabed like broken teeth. They were too precise to be natural—some ancient architecture swallowed by the ocean long ago. Glyphs covered their surfaces, looping patterns that seemed to writhe under the ROV’s lights.

“What is this place?” Maya whispered. No one answered. We were too transfixed.

The sound grew deafening as the ROV approached what looked like a fissure—a yawning chasm stretching into unfathomable black. The pillars grew denser here, forming a ring around the abyss like silent sentinels. The glyphs glowed faintly now, pulsing in time with the vibrations that rattled the ROV’s frame.

“Is that… movement?” the ROV pilot muttered, squinting at the feed.

Something was rising.

It came slowly at first, like smoke uncoiling from a fire. Tendrils of shadow poured from the fissure, twisting and writhing with impossible grace. They were too fluid to be solid, too dark to be natural. The ROV’s sensors went haywire, spitting out data that made no sense—impossible temperatures, gravitational anomalies, electromagnetic spikes.

And then we saw it.

The tendrils weren’t smoke. They were limbs. And the thing they belonged to was ancient beyond comprehension.

I can’t describe it fully. My mind won’t let me. It was vast—larger than any creature has a right to be. Its body was a mass of undulating darkness, studded with countless bioluminescent eyes that blinked in chaotic unison. Its form defied logic, shifting and folding in ways that made my head ache. And the sound—the song—was coming from it.

The Bloop wasn’t just a sound. It was its voice.

As the creature rose, the song intensified, resonating through our bodies, our bones. It wasn’t just sound anymore; it was thought. It pressed into my mind, filling it with images of endless oceans, sunken cities, and a time when this thing ruled the world above. 

It wasn’t angry, but it wasn’t benevolent, either. It felt indifferent, like a tidal wave or a black hole—an overwhelming force of nature that didn’t care about our existence but would crush us all the same if we got too close.

The crew stared at the monitors, frozen in silence. Then, the creature’s song changed. The low, resonant hum became sharper, faster. It wasn’t just broadcasting anymore—it was listening.

“Shut it down,” I said, my voice trembling. “Bring the ROV back. Now.”

The pilot fumbled with the controls, but the ROV wouldn’t respond. The feed stuttered, flickered, and then went dark.

“What’s happening?” Maya demanded, her voice shrill.

“The system’s fried,” the pilot stammered. “Something’s interfering—”

The ship lurched violently, throwing us against the walls. Alarms screamed as the hull groaned under sudden pressure.

“It’s pulling us!” the captain shouted from the bridge. “Something’s dragging us downward!”

I scrambled to a porthole, praying I wouldn’t see what I already knew was there. But outside, the darkness churned. The water was alive with those tendrils—vast, inky limbs wrapping around the ship, pulling us closer to the abyss.

The next few hours were chaos. The engines roared as we tried to fight the pull, but it was useless. One by one, the lights failed, leaving us in suffocating blackness. The song became unbearable, vibrating through every surface, crawling under our skin. It wasn’t just sound—it was meaning, ancient and incomprehensible, seeping into our minds like poison.

Some of the crew began to crack. Maya whispered to herself, repeating fragments of the glyphs we’d seen on the pillars. The captain locked himself in his quarters, screaming that he could see them—things moving in the shadows of the water. Others simply collapsed, their eyes glassy, their mouths open in silent prayer.

And then it spoke to me.

Not in words, but in images—flashes of a world long drowned, where this creature ruled. It showed me cities of impossible geometry, their spires reaching toward a sun that no longer existed. It showed me processions of things—its things—singing hymns in the deep, their voices melding into one terrible, endless note.

It showed me us. Humans. Fleeting, fragile. And it showed me what it would do when it rose again.

By the time we reached the fissure, there were only three of us still conscious—Maya, the pilot, and me. The rest of the crew was gone. Not dead—just gone. Their clothes were still there, their belongings untouched, but they had vanished without a trace.

We couldn’t move. The song pinned us in place, pressing down like the weight of the ocean itself. The ship creaked and groaned as the tendrils pulled it closer to the chasm, their movements slow, deliberate, inevitable.

Maya turned to me, her face pale and slack. “It wants us to know,” she said. Her voice was calm, detached, like she was in a trance. “It wants us to see.”

“No,” I said, though I wasn’t sure if I was arguing with her or myself. “We can’t—”

But it was too late. The ship tilted forward, and we were pulled into the abyss.

I don’t know how I survived. One moment, the ship was being dragged into the black; the next, I was floating on the surface, alone. The Nautilus was gone. The ocean was silent.

They found me three days later, drifting in an empty lifeboat. I told the rescue team I didn’t remember what happened, but that’s a lie. I remember everything. I remember the song, the tendrils, the way it looked at me through a thousand glowing eyes.

Most of all, I remember what it showed me before it let me go. It’s still down there, waiting. But it won’t wait forever.

The Bloop wasn’t a mystery, or a glitch, or an anomaly. It was a warning. And we didn’t listen.

Now it’s awake. And it’s hungry.

I can still hear it sometimes, in the dead of night, when everything is quiet. The song, faint and distant, like it’s calling out to me across the miles of water. I know what it wants. It didn’t let me go out of mercy—it let me go because I’m part of its plan.

It wants us to know. It wants us to see.

I haven’t told anyone the full truth about what I saw in the abyss. No one would believe me if I did. But I’ll say this: we’ve always thought the ocean was too vast, too deep, too unknowable. We assumed the creatures that lived in its darkest corners were mindless, primitive, alien.

We were wrong.

The ocean isn’t just alive—it’s aware. And the thing that sang to us from the depths isn’t a relic of the past. It’s the future, waiting for the right moment to rise.

I think it’s been waiting for us to grow curious enough, ambitious enough, to reach down and awaken it fully. All those years of sonar pings, deep-sea drilling, and endless exploration—we’ve been knocking on its door without even realizing. And now, the door is open.

I don’t know how long we have. It doesn’t care about time the way we do. It moves with the patience of the tides, an unstoppable force creeping closer to the shore. But I know it’s coming. It showed me.

Entire cities, swallowed by waves. Ships breaking apart like toys. A new empire rising from the deep, pulling humanity into its endless song. It’s not malicious, not in the way we understand. It’s just… inevitable.

I’ve thought about warning the world. Writing papers, giving interviews, showing them the fragments of glyphs burned into my memory. But what good would it do? No one would believe me. Even if they did, it wouldn’t stop what’s coming.

Because the Bloop isn’t just a sound. It’s a voice. And when it calls again, we’ll all hear it.

We’ll have no choice but to listen.

It’s already begun, hasn’t it? Rising tides, warming seas, strange currents that scientists scramble to explain away. They think it’s just the climate, but they don’t understand what’s really happening. The ocean is waking up, stretching its limbs, preparing for something we can’t stop.

I keep seeing the glyphs in my dreams. They twist and shift like living things, impossible to hold in my mind for long. But I know what they mean. They’re not just warnings—they’re instructions. A blueprint for something vast and terrible, something that will reshape the world when it comes.

Some nights, I hear the song again, clearer than ever. It starts as a hum, so low I can feel it in my chest before I hear it. Then it grows louder, rising until it feels like it’s coming from inside me. I cover my ears, but it doesn’t help. The song isn’t in the air; it’s in my head, vibrating through my bones.

And I know I’m not the only one hearing it.

I’ve seen the news—ships disappearing without explanation, fishing vessels returning with crews who refuse to speak about what they saw. And then there are the coastal towns reporting strange lights beneath the water, shapes moving where there shouldn’t be anything alive.

The Bloop wasn’t a one-time event. It was the first note in a symphony that’s just beginning.

The song reaches its crescendo in my dreams, but the waking world hasn’t let me go either. Last week, I got a call from NOAA—someone in their field division. They found bodies.

Well, parts of them.

“Dr. Callahan,” the voice on the phone had said, clinical but strained, like they were trying not to break down. “We’re asking for your assistance in identifying remains recovered off the Mariana Trench. The manifest for the Nautilus lists you as the only surviving crew member. We… believe these might belong to your colleagues.”

I tried to refuse, to hang up and run as far as I could from the memories. But they pressed, dangling some vague promise of closure. Closure. Like anything about this could ever close.

Two days later, I stood in a cold, sterile room in a NOAA lab, staring at steel tables draped in white sheets. The air smelled faintly of salt and chemicals, and the hum of fluorescent lights made my head ache.

“Are you ready?” the technician asked. She was young, her hands trembling as she reached for the first sheet.

I wasn’t ready, but I nodded.

She pulled the sheet back.
What lay beneath wasn’t human.

Not entirely, anyway.

I recognized the jacket first—standard issue for the Nautilus crew, with the embroidered patch bearing our mission insignia. The body wearing it, though, wasn’t Maya. Or at least, it wasn’t the Maya I remembered.

Her skin was bloated and pallid, crisscrossed with strange, jagged lines that almost looked like veins but glowed faintly under the harsh lights. Her eyes—those sharp, brilliant eyes I’d known—were gone, replaced by empty sockets filled with a dark, viscous substance that shimmered like oil. Her hands were fused, the fingers webbed together in a way that made my stomach churn.

“This one washed up on a reef near Guam,” the technician said, her voice barely above a whisper. “DNA confirmed her identity, but… well, as you can see, there’s been some anomalous degradation.”

“Degradation?” I croaked, my throat dry.

She hesitated, glancing at the other tables. “It gets worse.”

The next sheet revealed what was left of Captain Norwood. Or what had been made of him. His body was twisted, his spine curving unnaturally, his legs bent and shortened like they’d been reshaped for swimming. His mouth was stretched wide, impossibly so, the jaw unhinged as though in mid-scream. Rows of tiny, needle-like teeth lined his gums, far more than any human should have.

“What the hell is this?” I whispered, stepping back, the bile rising in my throat.

“It’s… something we’ve never seen,” the technician replied. “There’s evidence of deep tissue alteration—like their bodies were exposed to something that rewrote their biology.” She swallowed hard, looking as if she wanted to stop talking but couldn’t. “Some of the tissue samples are registering as… well, not human. Not even terrestrial.”

I couldn’t breathe. My mind flashed back to the abyss, to the way the tendrils had moved, to the images it had shown me of its things—the creatures that sang its hymns.

My crew hadn’t just died. They’d been claimed.

When the technician moved to the third table, I shook my head. “No more. I can’t—”

“Dr. Callahan,” she interrupted, her voice trembling. “This is the last one. But there’s something you need to see.”

Reluctantly, I nodded, my stomach churning. She pulled back the sheet.

It wasn’t a body.

It was a mass of something organic, like coral and flesh fused together, but pulsing faintly, as though alive. Pieces of the Nautilus were embedded in it—bits of hull plating, a shattered console, and, horrifyingly, fragments of human bone.

The technician pointed to the edge of the mass, where strange, looping glyphs were etched into the flesh itself. They glowed faintly, the same way the glyphs on the pillars in the abyss had glowed.

“What does it mean?” she asked, her voice barely a whisper.

I couldn’t answer. I couldn’t even look at her. All I could hear was the song, faint and far away, but growing louder with every beat of my heart.

When I left the lab, the technician handed me a file—a summary of what they’d found so far. I haven’t opened it. I don’t need to. I already know the truth.

The ocean doesn’t give back what it takes. Not really. It remakes them, shapes them into something new, something theirs.

The bodies they found were just warnings. The rest of my crew is still down there, beneath the waves, singing in the dark.

And one day, we’ll all join the song.
