 

I thought TV shows and movies were shot with actors on sets… but that hasn’t been the case for a long time. I wanna make this as concise as possible but I only know a part of the story so I’ll start a year ago. Specific movies and shows were altered to hide my identity and the current year.

I live in one of the largest cities in the world. We attract the best artists and many great shows and films were shot here. That’s why I’m here! One day, I’d like to get my horror film made but I like just being here. The script is near done. For now, I’m a  lowly package sorter for a delivery company.

I stand in the staircase a few minutes early for work and close my eyes opening the letter from the power company that was attached to my door this morning. Every tear of the envelope echoes up and down the stairwell for anyone to hear. The critical words shout at me from the page ‘overdue’, ‘shut-off’, ‘three days’, ‘unfortunately’. I walk two stories down to the incinerator, it’s supposed to only be for large items, but I was feeling defiant. I want to watch this letter burn.

I push open the door and immediately feel heat. There’s Emilie, another sorter like me, standing too close to the incinerator, her arm outstretched. She must be cooking that close! I approach her “Emilie, are you ok?”

She doesn’t turn around but says “I feel better now… I wish there was an easier way. If I jump out of a window, the nets will catch me. If I take too many pills, the system will notice that I’m not working and resuscitate me. I can’t do it anymore Billie. I’m so cold all the time. I’m hungry All. The. Time.” Her arm twists to take in the heat.

I’m late now, three people from the morning crew enter the area pushing a huge cart of junk. I turn to Emilie “You’re so funny! You’re gonna be a comedian! Everyone loves you! Maybe you could work at the Freedom Tower for a short-“

“The Freedom Tower!?” She scolds me “Once you put on that gray outfit and sign their contract, that’s it. Have you ever seen anyone make it out?” She turns halfway, to look at me, her arm still feeling the heat. “…Billie, if you keep working, they’re just gonna keep speeding up that hamster wheel”

She jumps into the furnace. I hear the worst scream imaginable. I know it will be ringing in my ears for the rest of my life like an audio scar. The morning team comes running behind me crying and confused.

Upstairs, in the staff break room there’s the usual bland pop music playing as we wait for the manager, I just call him the ‘slick prick’. Usually everyone is talking about their side hustle that’s gonna allow them to quit this hell hole. Some do podcasts, some do web design, Emilie was supposed to be a comedian… I can’t afford to leave so I’m here until they send me home. The slick prick we were all expecting walks in. He turns the music off with his phone and says “Thanks for waiting everyone, it looks like we had a whoopsy today. We are committed to correcting this and allowing everyone whatever they need. That’s why we’re proud to offer the people who witnessed it three whole hours paid in office to rest and pizza for everyone! We also wanted to announce how proud we are of you guys handling 50 packages per hour… that’s why we’re excited to rollout the new 55 box min! We know you got this!” He leaves while everyone is still staring at the ground confused.

Jeffrey, one of the people who saw the ‘whoopsy’ asks me “Billie, what did she say to you?”

Her scream is the first thing my mind recalls. I shut my eyes. Jeffrey says “Sorry Billie… I just thought-“

“It’s ok” I tell him. “She said she was tired… not much else”

Dwayne jumps in “What should we do for our break? We could watch a movie or something”

Jeffrey says “Sure, should we watch something funny to lighten the mood?”

Dwayne agrees “Sure, have you guys seen Cocaine Hangover Bear? It’s funny… could be good”

I saw that movie and while it is funny, it’s not what we need. He’s suggesting it because he liked it but he doesn’t realize it’s not for everyone… it’s not right for today “I think ‘Forrest Through The Trees’ is a better movie for today. It’s funny and deals with loss and grief but has a positive message that’s more accessible to our group”

The group nods in agreement. Even Dwayne agrees. After it’s over, we all feel better and are able to work. We even hit the new 55 box min.

After I clock out, my phone buzzes. I’m needed in the slick prick’s office. Perfect timing. I’m pretty hungry after all that work. I hope this is quick.

“Come on in buddy!” The slick prick waves me in. “I’ll get right to it…” he thinks for a moment “After every accident, people always want something; they want to go home, they want to sue, they want better equipment blah blah” his smile fades and what I know now to be seething jealousy replaces it.

He continues “Well you really impressed someone, you got the- the um, workers back on the floor after an accidental death in only a few hours. No lawsuits. No comps. So tomorrow, instead of work; you’ve been invited to serve food at an event with some great people”

“Um, ok…” I say “You said instead of work. Does it pay? I can’t afford to miss work” I don’t even know if I’ll have electricity when I get home.

He sits upright “Billie, you’re getting exposure! No, it doesn’t pay but you can eat free while you’re there” I see that jealousy splash on his face again as he says “That’s honestly all they told me about it. It’s tomorrow night, so think about it”

“I guess” I tell him. I just want to go home and find something to watch in the sea of infinite movies and content.

I have no food at home so I stop by the grocery store. It’s near the Freedom Tower, the underground tower where they cover your food, clothes, and living space while you work for them. It’s always on the back of my mind. It’s on the back of everyone’s mind. Getting too close to it, smells like some thick repugnant industrial chemical. I hate it but I hold my breath. Almost there, I hear the soothing classical music the store plays when I enter.

The store is kinda crowded for the after work rush. I know there’s a few bucks on my card so I only grab a couple ramen noodle and a soda. I’ll pay for the ramen first then the soda just in case.

Standing in line for a few minutes, gives me a chance to think over that ‘opportunity’ I was offered. If I miss a day of work, then my check will be short but maybe this is something. Maybe it’s a trap to force me into needing to go to the Freedom Tower.

“A dollar eighty nine sir” The checkout guy startles me. I hand him my card. Ten seconds later it still hasn’t gone through. *Oh no…* There’s a line behind me. The checkout guy holds his hand over the receipt printer getting increasingly annoyed.

The pleasant classical music stops. The checkout light begins blinking red. A robotic voice comes over the speaker “Card declined! Card declined! Please leave store! Do not attempt to take unpaid merchandise! Card declined! …”

“Your card was declined sir” the guy says handing me back my worthless card. I can deal with not eating but the feeling of having your card declined in a busy line is the worst thing I had ever experienced. I can’t even look at the other patrons, I doubt they could cover the two bucks and I wouldn’t want to pass on that shame to them.

These stores usually have a Freedom Tower kiosk somewhere. Maybe I could temporarily work there, and save up enough to shoot my script… maybe eat a little better. The table is easy to find. The guy hands me a pamphlet with a big grin “This is a great opportunity! Food covered! Clothes covered! All you do is work 40 hours for one year, just sign here!” The checkout line is still blaring the red light and “Card Declined!”.

Glass shatters somewhere in the store. We both look for the disturbance. A man wearing the familiar gray outfit darts around the aisles. He’s horribly skinny. His face is the most exaggerated look of poverty I’d seen. The thousand yard stare, self loathing, lack of dignity as he rips open a rotisserie chicken. At that moment I was kinda envious of him.

“Anyway…” the kiosk guy says and swivels the iPad around for me to sign. He grabs a plastic wrapped set of the gray outfit and places it on the table.

Then, I remember the free food at tomorrow’s event. What the hell, I text the slick prick that I’ll be there. He gives a thumbs up. I leave the kiosk without a word.

The next night high up in an office building, I’m handed a clip on bow tie, black vest and a tray of food just like a dozen others but my tray comes with a message on it ‘Recommend your best. Tonight is your tryout’

Walking the event handing out food, I can’t tell any of these formal clowns apart. A small group of classical musicians play some light music. I recognize a few choice movie score pieces. But the conversation does grab me. It’s some kind of movie discussion group. I catch parts of people’s discussion; One guys says “...When I recommended it, it was at less than a thousand views. It got a second season and a spin off. It touches on themes of hope, and courage-” another lady brags “...I’ve zeroed twice. Both times lead to an increase in production from the worker bees. They love a show about a hero who does the right thing. It gives them an excuse to keep their head down and work” The group chuckles. A guy responds “Oof, that’s great but, I’ve zeroed three times this year and one of my shows got Senator Mckay elected. The main character was just like the senator. People ate it up… All got at least three seasons” He proudly holds up three fingers.

I don’t know why I said it but standing there listening to them, I felt like one of them and said “That’s all very impressive, but once, years ago, I got my whole warehouse to watch the 80s version of Stephen King’s IT. The movie is a great blend of 80s and 90s styles, it was only really popular with kids at the time so adults now were ready, plus, the themes of growing up and dealing with bullies, racists, abusers was exactly what people needed. Then a couple years later, bam! Remake announced! It was amazing and it got a spin off show. I tell my friends you gotta stay ahead. You gotta read books, graphic novels and short stories too”

Most of them let out a friendly laugh. Except one guy, slick prick #2 I called him. A lady welcomes me into the chat and says “Oh, that was you! They love when we recommend an oldie… If you can get an oldie to come back, you must be good!” 

What I said was true but I don’t know if I actually sparked that movie’s comeback. The slick prick #2 says “What class Recommender are you?” with a snide look.

A dude interjects “Bruh, he’s clearly here serving food. He doesn’t have a cla-”

I spare him from saving me “Yea, I’m just here as a worker. I’d like to make a movie one day”

The slick prick #2 reacts “Hmmppphh. Well if you want to be a creator. You can’t be a recommender… Let’s see  your badge”

I show him and he scans it. He stares at his phone waiting when, suddenly his face drops. He looks upset and clears his throat trying to move on.

The lady who defended me earlier says “What came up?” Reluctantly, he shows her his phone. She smiles at me “Wow! You really were at the front of the IT remake. You were recommending the old one when it was getting less than a hundred clicks a week! What are you doing serving shrimp?” 

“I uh..” *Ting Ting* Someone has an announcement to make. The musicians stop playing. Everyone turns to face the speaker. An older lady with glasses and a shiny golden evening gown.

“I want to thank everyone for coming. You all have done a great job recommending this year. So far, you all have had ten zeros. That’s ten shows that were sitting at zero views that became number ones, you sparked that flame! Enjoy tonight, you’ve earned it”

The slick prick #2 had been nervously scrolling through something on his phone during the speech. Once it was over, two armed men approach him and take him away. He must’ve dropped his phone so I pick it up. It’s open on a spreadsheet called ‘Recommender Prime Report’ It’s just a list of movies and crap. I shouldn’t have but I forward the file to myself right as some goon with sunglasses grabs me.

“Sir… I’ll take that” My chest tightens and I know the fear was all over my face but the guy just toss the phone in a trash bin. “She would like to see you” he says to me.

I’m led away on an elevator. We travel down for an eternity. When I finally get off, the guy says to wait on the bench. The entire area is full of tiny glass rooms, each with a single person wearing a VR helmet connected to the ceiling. They’re all moving, dancing, fighting, walking. It’s endless like a maze with people in the walls who aren’t aware of my or each other’s existence. I sit down. After an hour, I open that spreadsheet.

All of the shows have zero views. I watch a trailer for a random one. Holy shit this looks good; it’s a sci-fi show about a dad who loses his kids in the multiverse, the show has underlying themes of abandonment, fatherhood, manhood and the imagery is grounded and surreal. I check out another… this one, a horror movie about a Voodoo Shaman from New Orleans brought back from the dead for vengeance… The premise is cool and the poster is solid but it looks kinda generic. I fall into a hole of adding shows to my list, hours pass and I don’t even remember why I’m there. I’m in heaven!

I’m startled by footsteps. I can’t tell which way they’re coming from so I quickly hide the spreadsheet. I see someone a few layers of glass away walking toward me. She rounds a corner and it’s the lady in the golden gown but she’s wearing all black and looking more tactical carrying a folder.

“Billie, you’ve got great taste in shows… I understand you write movies as well” She opens the folder… She has my script. 

“Um, yea I’d like to shoot it someday” She thumbs through it without acknowledging me.

“Mmhmm… I bet you have this whole thing pictured in your head. I bet you know all of the characters in full detail.” She closes the script “... but I bet you’re better at identifying greatness when you see it” She opens her phone and taps it a few times. My phone dings ‘Thanks for the payment of $731.25’ from the electric company. Without sorting a single box or flipping a burger she erases that boulder from my consciousness. I think of Emilie’s death. She points to an empty stall in the maze, with a VR helmet sitting ready “Billie, shows aren’t written, shot or edited anymore. They’re dreamed up here. Each one of these people here are creating something great… Or something not so great. You see, you can’t be both. You can try your hand at creating films, or you can be a Recommender for me… And I want someone like you, those people upstairs, it’s all data and numbers. They have no passion for the art. You could replace me one day. I’ve recommended shows that have started trends that toppled world leaders, I’ve whispered the names of movies to drunk people that started global franchises. You could have this power!”

“What happens if I choose my film and it doesn’t do well?” I ask.

She shrugs “You go back to sorting boxes…While it lasts. You’re good at that. You would last a few more rounds of the music”

I’ve always fantasized about being a famous creative but, I think the thing I really want is stability. I want to be warm and fed. Plus, I like recommending shows. 

“What’s your choice?”

I look her in the eyes “There’s this sci-fi show about a dad who loses his kids in the multiverse… You gotta check it out. It looks fantastic” She smiles.

The next year, when I return for the same annual recommender party, I stop by my old job. It’s a ghost town. The only person working is the original slick prick. He’s sorting boxes on the floor with a fleet of robots. He looks miserable. I don’t let him know I’m there. Everyone else is most likely dead or at the Freedom Tower. The entire entertainment industry is a hall of mirrors. Nothing is real.

Later that night, at the event, it feels a little smaller than last year. I see the elusive Recommender Prime, she tings her glass in the same way “Thanks for coming everyone! You all set records last year! That’s why I’m glad to announce a new minimum for next year. I want fifteen ‘zeros’! I know you can do it!”

It never ends.

I don’t have many skills but I can recommend you some good content.
