Hello. My name is Carmen. I am an avid paranormal researcher and lover of all things unknown, as I am sure a lot of you are too. Today, I bring you guys a story that I am extremely surprised hasn't been more thoroughly looked through and investigated. I am almost giddy to be the one to “break it”, I guess. I always wanted to find a corner of our world and bring it to the light and now is my chance to do it. 

I first heard of this, we’ll call it a “legend”, myth, etc for now, on a paranormal message board online. Its name is “Ouwtletesswor.com”. Yes, I don't know how to pronounce it either. It doesn't seem to resemble any word in any other language I could find and most of the users of it seemed to speak English.

The site itself was design very plainly, to put it blunt. The entire site has a weird lime green tint to it. Threads were blinding white against a pitch black background. I am honestly extremely surprised that the domain was still active with how run down the whole thing is.

 What is interesting about that site is how it provides complete anonymity to its users. Think 4chan for example. It archives the posts themselves and takes away any name tied to them.

Of course the added layer of secrecy caused a few share of clear hoaxes, failing args, and other assorted internet oddities that you would see in any online discussion about the strange. However, another interesting aspect of the site is how it has a “randomized page” feature where it, as the name suggests, randomly spits out a page, new or old, from the website to you.

Some of the posts it gave me were very, very old. Reaching as far back as 2004 in some cases. They made for a very interesting read, almost like mini-online time capsules. But none of the actual substance of the posts stood out to me. All too generic, all too explainable, and all too boring. Nothing that someone as experienced as I could really sink my teeth into. That was until I landed on the page titled “Mysterious Payphone In Nevada FOUND”.

The post had a large picture of a seemingly normal payphone with red trimmings out in the middle of a desert in presumingly Nevada. On the right of the picture read:

“Hello everyone. To all of those who doubted me, please direct your eyes to the truth!!! Here is a payphone found in perfect condition in The Middle of Nowhere, Nevada. No scratches. No dents. No smudges. It is in tip top shape. Typing and posting this now before I go in just to say that I TOLD YOU SO!”

I couldn't find any other previous threads that connected back to this one so we are lacking a bit of context on who exactly this user was rubbing his victory in the face of. 

The way this paragraph is phrased also makes it sound like he had potentially posted about finding, seeing, or at least hearing about this payphone before this thread which resulted in the poor feedback he is insulting in this post. Once again, I couldn't find anything like that. This thread is all I could pull together.

 Any chance of potentially finding an older instance of the payphone would be a waste of time. This original post is almost 13 years old. Anything else related to it would be swept up in the ever expanding sea that is the internet.

There were multiple users who responded to the original post. Some are asking questions and still a lot of people are doubting the original poster. Didn't seem like any of these insults phased the original poster as he didn't respond to any of them. Instead he responded to one specific reply:

“where in Nevada is this? I am there right now visiting family and I might take a little visit”

As a reminder, the original usernames of these users are long gone but for the sake of clarity, I'll assign them made up names. I'll call the original poster Red and the replier Blue.

Red responds: “I am not very familiar with the area, to be frank! I'm a forest boy, not a desert one!”

Blue: “what made you go all the way to Nevada? Did you just do this to find the payphone?”

Red: “Pretty much! I know that when I got something good, I gotta go get it!”

Blue: “so did you go in?”

Red: “Not yet :(“

Blue: “you said you were about to enter the payphone in your post lol are you scared?”

Red: “No I just wish to soak in my victory a little bit. Plus it is pretty late. I am back in my motel now!”

Blue: “ugh why can't anyone commit to their hoax for once”

Red responded very fast, only a couple of seconds after blue posted that when all the other replies happened after a few minutes: “THIS AINT NO HOAX. I just need some time alright. I will head there tomorrow and will post again on this very thread my findings.”

Blue: “see you then”

About 14 hours passed since that final reply and Red kept to his word. A new photo was posted onto the thread. A photo taken from inside the payphone’s glass box now. The camera was pointed away from the phone itself, instead facing the road a few feet in front of the payphone.

Red wrote to the right of the photo: “I am inside! Ask away, haters!”

Blue responded about 4 minutes after the news entry into the thread was posted: “you still have a lot more to prove. You said it was like some evil satanic shit right?”

Red: “I have got to say. It does feel very cramped in here!”

Blue: “you're inside a glass fucking box Jesus Christ what are we doing here”

Red: “Just teasing :) in all reality this feels almost ethereal. If you're in a space like this for a long time you start to run out of air right? Well it feels as fresh as the second I first walked in!”

Blue: “you said it was demonic though”

Red: “I said nothing of the sort. Carvadosnight did and I simply passed his word on. So far the only thing he seemed right about was where it was located.”

Couldn't dig anything up about this “Carvadosnight” guy but safe to assume that was the username of someone on the board. Seems to be the guy who first posted about the payphone. At least the first one to do it on this board.

Blue: “you believed so hard that carvadosnight was telling the truth about where it was but not all the satanic stuff he saw while inside? What makes you draw the line”

Red: “Cause I'm in here right now and I feel fine! I don't see nothing! I'm not weak at the knees or thinking about gutting myself!”

Blue: “why did he tell you specifically where it was?”

Red: “Didn’t. I just got lucky!”

Blue: “lol. what now then”

Red didn't respond in text, instead he just posted more photos from inside the payphone. 3 photos to be exact. Another one that was almost identical to the first photo he had posted earlier that day, then two more this time pointed at the red phone itself. There was no accompanying text with these photos. 

Something I have to note about these posts is that they were devoid of any other users interacting with it. No other replies could be found anywhere. From Red and Blue’s first interaction onward, the entire thread was empty of any life except for them.

This is what really got my investigative gears turning. Such an interesting situation with so very little eyes on it. A fascinating case laying dormant for 13 years suddenly landed on my doorstep.

Blue responded: “is it functional?”

Red: “I don't know who to call.”

Blue: “family?”

Red: “Don't really have too many of those”

Blue: “do you have the number of the motel?”

Red: “No.”

Blue: “try mine. Maybe then I could pinpoint how close I am to it lol”

Obviously, I'm not going to put this user’s number out there online although it is ironic that I take that caution since they had done the exact opposite of that. Be assured though that they did leave their number for everyone to see.

Red: “One moment!”

Blue: “ready when you are”

The thread went silent for a few minutes before Blue responded again.

Blue: “that is strange. It went through but I couldn't hear anything”

Red replied extremely fast once again: “I wasn't expecting you to be a girl. Kind of threw me off my feet.”

Blue: “ohhhh I see. So you did hear me though?”

Red: “Yep! Loud and clear!”

Blue: “good so it is nearby at least. Why don't you just tell me the motel you are staying at then and then the path you take to it?”

Red: “Told you I'm not familiar with the place.”

Blue: “you don't even know how you got to your motel? Like just the directions or anything?”

Red: “I took a cab, they brought me to one.”

Blue: “why take a cab when you have a car?”

Red: “What do you mean, sweetheart?”

Blue: “you drive out to the middle of the desert right? Why take a cab if you got a car?”

Red: “It's a rental. They sold them near the motel.”

Blue: “how did you get to Nevada then? Did you fly?”

Red: “Yes.”

Blue: “you can't even name like a city or something? Where did you land?”

Red again didn't respond in text, posting another image instead. A zoomed in picture of what appeared to be text written on the floor of the payphone. The text read “Diliges Aviam''. It was written in black ink in an almost rushed manner. The strokes were wobbly and uneven.

Red had typed to the side: “Do you happen to know what this means?”

Blue: “what the fuck? That's Latin”

Red: “Are you able to help?”

Blue: “I flunked Latin in highschool. Sorry”

Another picture of hastily scribbled words on the floor of the payphone was posted by Red, this time reading “MENDAX”. Blue took a moment to respond.

Blue: “sorry can't help you. That is very strange.”

Red: “Can you look up what they could mean?”

Blue: “I did. I'm getting nothing back. Bing sucks lol”

Red: “Are you calling me right now?”

Blue: “no? How the hell would I even do that lol”

Red: “Someone is. One moment.”

After 20 minutes, Red came back.

Red: “That was my mom. She died a few years ago. It was her. It sounded like her. Spoke like her. Knew things only my mom would know. Called me nicknames she gave me when I was young. It was her. We talked about how I was doing and how she was doing. She said she was in heaven and my dad was there and my sister and my grandmother. They said they were all there happy for me.”

Blue: “holy shit what?”

Red: “I am back home now.”

Blue: “where is the payphone?”

No response from Red.

Blue: “hello?”

No response again.

Blue: “just give me a general idea”

No response.

Blue: “hello?”

Nothing. Blue kept asking for the location for another 25 minutes before eventually giving up. Red never gave up the information Blue was asking for.

 5 days later, a new photo was posted by Blue. A picture of a payphone with red trimmings with not a single scratch, dent, or smudge on it. 

She typed to the right of the photo: “I found it. It took a long time but I found it. I used the few clues given in the previous photos. Visible mountain locations, nearest motels, road signs, etc, to pinpoint a general location and I searched everywhere for it. It took days but I am here. I don't know if anyone will even see this but I have to document it somehow. My curiosity got the best of me I guess.”

More photos followed. 5 of them. All from inside the payphone. A few seemed like her attempt at replicating the images Red had taken originally including the two that faced the street and the two of the phone almost as proof that she had in fact found the right spot. Not to convince others but more to convince herself that the legend was real and she was inside it. The last one was one taken of the floor.

In a text next to the photo of the floor she wrote: “There is nothing on the floor. That fucker must have put it there to freak me out or some shit. I should have known that he would choose something as generically scary as Latin to spook me. A goddamn waste of my time. I know he sure as shit didn't get a call from his dead mom. Waste of fucking time. His story stunk of bullshit and I fell for it. I should have fucking known.”

Then Blue would send out what was both her last text of the thread as well as the last text in the thread entirely.

It simply read: “I am getting a phone call.”

One last thing was posted to the thread, however. A photo posted by Red, 30 minutes after Blue sent her final message.

It was a photo that was seemingly taken from behind a rock as if the photographer was hiding itself. It was a bit difficult to determine details as the flash was on when the photo was taken giving the final product a slight vignette. Not to mention the setting Nevada sun cascading parts of the orange, dusty landscape in a shadow. The still image was shakey and blurry, like it was taken in a rush. 

What you can just barely make out in the middle of the photo, mostly obscured by the rock but just slightly visible, was a pale, white light being emitted from a large, rectangular, glass box. A womanly figure can be seen standing inside the payphone, holding the phone up to her ear, back facing away from the photographer.


That is where the thread ends.


I have my tickets to Nevada bought and my supplies packed. I was able to rope an old college buddy of mine into this investigation too. Although he doesn't share my perseverance or tenacity for finding the truth, he shares my curiosity. I am looking forward to getting to the bottom of this with all of you.

As far as I could find, this thread seems to be the only form of discussion about this payphone on the entire internet. The only people knowing about it being whoever carvadosnight, the original poster, the replier, and those few who viewed the original post 13 years ago were. All of them and me of course, as far as I know.

Which leads me to ask that if anyone knows anything about this payphone or lives in the Nevada area and may have some light to shine onto the mystery, please get in contact with me. You know how in movies reporters say they are about to get their "big break"? That's how I feel like right now. This is going to be my story.

I will update you all when we have visited and entered the “Mysterious Payphone in Nevada”.
