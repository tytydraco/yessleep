This post is going to sound like the ramblings of a crazed conspiracy theorist - the kind that everyone rolls their eyes at and pays no mind to. I’m going to ask you all for a difficult favor. Please hear me out first before writing me off as paranoid and insane. 

&#x200B;

You might be familiar with the airline SkyFly. For those that aren’t - SkyFly is an airline originating from Austin, Texas. It started out as a lesser known company, but within five years, it became one of the top dogs in the airline business. They’re also the worst. 

&#x200B;

If you thought United Airlines was bad for breaking guitars, or Delta Airlines for kicking passengers off of overbooked flights, you haven’t seen anything yet. SkyFly takes the cake. The CEO, Felix Thompson is a literal evil genius. He got away with first degree murder by masking it as negligent homicide. 

&#x200B;

Felix made it look like the oh so tragic death of Captain Gary Hurst was a result of cutting corners, instead of him being a specific target. I have proof of this. All you need to do is read the black box transcript from SkyFly Flight 49, which slammed into a field on May 29, 2013 due to a sudden mechanical failure. Captain Gary Hurst, Co-Captain Drew Baltimore, the four flight attendants, and all 250 passengers were killed on impact. There were no survivors. 

&#x200B;

SkyFly paid a good deal of money to keep that transcript discreet. You won’t find it on a Google search. You won’t find any news articles on it, either. This travesty was swept beneath the rug, and thoroughly stomped on to keep it there. What Felix did not anticipate, was for his own daughter to have enough of a conscience to betray him. 

&#x200B;

I’m leaking this transcript, because both customers and employees of SkyFly Airlines deserve to know the serious risk to their lives.

##Start of Transcript 

&#x200B;

**1549:49.3** [start of recording] 

&#x200B;

**1549:50 Captain:** Good morning everyone! Thank you for flying SkyFly Airlines! We expect to arrive in Boston, Massachusetts in six hours. 

&#x200B;

**1549:54.8** [sound of click]

&#x200B;

**1549:57.7 Co-Pilot:** I love the feeling of lifting off from the ground. It’s like in John Gillepsie’s poem: *“Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth, And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings…”*

&#x200B;

**1550:14 Captain:** Let’s hope this one stays in the air. 

&#x200B;

**1550:22 Co-Pilot:** What do you mean?

&#x200B;

**1550:25 Captain:** You don’t feel that rattling? 

&#x200B;

**1550:25 Co-Pilot:** Shit. We need to return to the airport to get it looked at. 

&#x200B;


**1550:27 Captain:** SkyFly Airlines Flight 49 calling into air traffic. 

&#x200B;

**1550:31 Air Traffic:** Flight 49? What’s the situation?

&#x200B;

**1550:32** [Sound of click]

&#x200B;

**1550:34 Captain:** We just took off and the plane is starting to rattle. The yoke feels stiff as well. Permission to return to the airport for an urgent landing? 

&#x200B;

**1550:35 Air Traffic:** [Captain], you have been flying for over fifteen years. You don’t need to make such a dramatic move over a little bit of turbulence. 

&#x200B;

**1550:37 Captain:** And as someone who has been flying for over fifteen years, I’m telling you that there’s something seriously wrong with this plane! 

&#x200B;

**1550: 38** [sound of clicking] 

&#x200B;

**1150:40 Air Traffic:** You don’t need to return to port! Just keep flying! If it gets worse in the next hour, then we can discuss an emergency landing!

&#x200B;

**1550:43 Captain:** Roger that! 

&#x200B;

**1550:44** [sound of click] 

&#x200B;

**1550:44.1 Captain:** What a dick… 

&#x200B;

**1550:45 Co-Pilot:** Are we going to be okay? 

&#x200B;

**1551:01 Captain:** We can only pray. 

&#x200B;


**1551:09.3 Captain:** To be fair, things have smoothened out. Maybe I was getting paranoid. 

&#x200B;

**1551:09.9 Co-Pilot:** Why *did* you have such an extreme reaction? 

&#x200B;

**1551:18.1 Captain:** I keep getting put in broken planes. The first time, a failure in the elevators had this plane tossing and turning. The second time, there was a sudden explosion in BOTH engines. The third time, the plane literally stalled for a second. Thankfully I was able to land before anyone got seriously hurt, but this is not a lucky streak that I want to press. 

&#x200B;


**1551:20.6 Co-Pilot:** Let’s try not to let the worst case scenario impede on our current flight. A little bit of turbulence isn’t going to hurt us. 

&#x200B;


**1551:36 Captain:** What happened to agreeing with me to land the plane immediately and get it looked at? 

&#x200B;

**1551:38 Co-Pilot:** Air traffic made a good point. 

&#x200B;


**1551:40** [the captain heaves a heavy sigh] 

&#x200B;

**1551:42** [sound of rattling] 

&#x200B;

**1551:50 Captain:** Shit! 

&#x200B;

**1551:58 Co-Pilot:** What was that??

&#x200B;


**1552:01 Captain:** I don’t know, but nothing good. 

&#x200B;

**1552:02** [sound of an electronic hissing]

&#x200B;


**1552:31 Plane Warning System:** Autopilot disabled. Autopilot disabled. Autopilot disabled. 

&#x200B;

**1552:41 Captain:** What did I fucking tell you? 

&#x200B;


**1552:51** [Sound of click]

&#x200B;

**1552:53 Captain:** Hold onto that controller like your life depends on it - because it does! 

&#x200B;

**1552:59 Captain:** SkyFly Airlines Flight 49 calling into air traffic. We have an emergency. 

&#x200B;

1553:03 **Air Traffic:** Flight 49? What’s the problem?

&#x200B;

**1553:08 Captain:** The plane is shaking like an earthquake, and autopilot has suddenly disabled itself. Permission to make an emergency landing?

&#x200B;

**1553:09 Air Traffic:** Just fly it manually! You know how to do that! 

&#x200B;

**1553:10 Captain:** Air traffic, I am telling you that this plane is going to fall apart before we get there! 

&#x200B;

**1553:11 Air Traffic:** Get a grip! Just keep flying manually! 

&#x200B;

**1553:15 Captain:** Roger that, asshole. 

&#x200B;


**1553:17 Captain:** Well, I suppose it’s good practice for flying manually. 

&#x200B;

**1553:19 Co-Pilot:** Is this safe? 

&#x200B;


**1553:21 Captain:** Not at all. But what choice do we have? 

&#x200B;

**1553:28 Co-Pilot:** If something else happens and air traffic denies the request to land, maybe we should just do it anyway. There are 250 lives at stake. 

&#x200B;

**1553:35 Captain:** That’s the plan. I’d land it now, but I’d catch too much shit for it. 

&#x200B;

**1553:37** [sound of violent shaking] 

&#x200B;

**1553:40 Captain:** WOAH!!

&#x200B;

**1553:46 Plane Warning System:** TERRAIN TERRAIN! PULL UP! TERRAIN TERRAIN! PULL UP! 

&#x200B;

**1553:47** [sound of frantic clicking] 

&#x200B;

**1553:48 Captain:** Oh, thank god. I’m not ready to meet my maker yet. 

&#x200B;

**1553:53 Captain:** SkyFly Airlines Flight 49 calling into air traffic. We have a serious emergency. 

&#x200B;

**1554:24 Air Traffic:** Flight 49? What’s the problem?

&#x200B;

**1554:26 Captain:** We temporarily  lost control of the aircraft. We NEED to land before it happens again!  

&#x200B;

**1554:32 Air Traffic:** [murmuring] I guess we don’t have a choice but to let you land… 

&#x200B;

**1554:33 Captain:** Don’t have a choice?? What the hell is that supposed to mean?? 

&#x200B;


**1554:35**  [sound of click] 

&#x200B;


**1554:37 Captain:** Oh shit! That was a scary pitch! I swear, it’s like these gears are covered in rust! 

&#x200B;


**1554:50 Captain:** Drew, why are you looking at me like that?  

&#x200B;


**1554:51 Co-Pilot:** Because I just realized that you’ve been put in broken planes for a reason… 

&#x200B;

**1554:53 Captain:** Air traffic control might be a dick, but they wouldn’t commit such an insane conspiracy with 250 other lives! 

&#x200B;

**1555:00 Co-Pilot:** I don’t think it’s a conspiracy. They just “don’t want to fix what isn’t broken.”

&#x200B;

**1555:00 Captain:** What…

&#x200B;

**1555:01 Co-Pilot:** I doubt these planes have had proper maintenance in a long time. Cutting corners is cheaper. If we make an emergency landing, SkyFly is going to have to pay to get the plane fixed. 

&#x200B;

**1555:06 Captain:** Why the hell would air traffic be involved in *that*? 

&#x200B;

**1555:16 Co-Pilot:** CEO’s know how to make friends. 

&#x200B;

**1555:18 Plane Warning System:** TERRAIN TERRAIN! PULL UP! TERRAIN TERRAIN! PULL UP! 

&#x200B;

**1555:19 Captain:** MAYDAY! MAYDAY! MAYDAY! 

&#x200B;

**1555:20 Co-Pilot:** [talking into black box] Melissa, baby, I love you so much. You’re the love of my life, okay? And it’s also okay if you move on and marry another man after me. I want you to be happy, okay? Don’t let this tragedy kill you too! 

&#x200B;

**1555:24 Captain:** IDIOT!! DON’T GIVE UP YET!! Yank on that yoke as hard as you can!! 

&#x200B;


**1555:25 Co-Pilot:** Roger that!

&#x200B;


**1555:30 Plane Warning System:** TERRAIN TERRAIN! PULL UP! TERRAIN TERRAIN! PULL UP! 

&#x200B;


**1555:31 Captain:** MAYDAY! MAYDAY! MAYDAY!

&#x200B;


**1555:32 Air Traffic:** Okay, Flight 49, you have permission to make an emergency landing. 

&#x200B;


**1555:38 Captain:** Let’s hope it’s not too late for that! 

&#x200B;


**1555: 39** [sound of explosion] 

&#x200B;

**1555:40 Captain:** Air traffic, we just lost control of the vertical stabilizer!

&#x200B;


**1555:41 Air Traffic:** Okay, what do you want to do? 

&#x200B;


**1555:43 Captain:** There’s nothing to be done at this point. We’re in an uncontrollable dive. 


&#x200B;

**1555:45 Co-Pilot** God have mercy on all of our souls… 


&#x200B;

**1555:47** [sound of impact] 

##End of transcript

SkyFly Flight 49 slammed full speed into an empty field in Dripping Springs, Texas. There were no survivors. Just as co-pilot Drew Baltimore said, CEO’s know how to make friends. A further investigation would reveal that the air traffic control workers heard in this black box recording were being paid $5k check bonuses to keep these broken planes in the air. 


&#x200B;


Maintenance crews gave the clearance for the planes’ safety checks, but never did any real examination into their condition. It was a conspiracy, to be sure. But like I said in the beginning of this post, it was never about saving money. If it were a matter of frugality, EVERY SkyFly pilot would have been in a broken plane. 

&#x200B;


**It was only Captain Gary Hurst that was assigned to these planes that were not suited for flight.** 

&#x200B;

Captain Gary was such a good pilot that he could land a broken plane without casualties. When one busted plane was forced to go out of commission due to a successful landing, they’d put him in another one. I know you’re thinking that I’m making reaches. After all, why would such a conspiracy involve 250 other innocent passengers, 4 flight attendants, and another co-pilot? 

&#x200B;

**Simple: When a CEO commits negligent homicide, they get a $2 million slap on the wrist, and can carry on with their lives. If a CEO commits 1st Degree murder, they risk life without parole.**

&#x200B;

CEO’s kill people everyday though human trafficking, exploitation of labor, negligent maintenance practices, and denying medical insurance to their employees. What’s 255 more in a simple plane crash? Captain Gary Hurst was *always* the target. The other innocent lives lost that day were simply a necessary collateral damage to get away with murder. I don’t know why my father wanted that man dead. I admit that I don’t have an explanation for a motive. 

&#x200B;


But only one pilot assigned to four consecutive broken planes?  That’s not a coincidence. ESPECIALLY when air traffic control was trying to keep him in the air every single time. 

&#x200B;

**If you’re a pilot still working for SkyFly, RESIGN ASAP before you become next. If you have a flight booked with SkyFly, cancel it immediately.** You could be the next target, or the next collateral damage to kill their target.
