CHAPTER ONE 
Arrival
I always imagined winter break would feel cinematic; soft snow, cozy sweaters, maybe a tasty mug of cocoa held with both hands like I was in a holiday commercial. And honestly? When I stepped out of the car in my faux‑fur coat and rhinestone earmuffs, the snow falling in perfect little flakes around me, it did feel cinematic.

If you ignored Rowan.

“Are you done posing?” he asked, slamming the trunk like it owed him money.

“I wasn’t posing,” I said, which was a lie. “I was appreciating the moment.”

He rolled his eyes so hard I thought they might pop out of his face. “Right.”

Classic Rowan. Always ready with a comment, always allergic to joy. But this trip was supposed to be different. A chance to reconnect, according to my mother, which meant she was tired of us “bickering” and wanted to outsource the problem to a cabin in the woods.

The cabin itself was cute in a rustic, “I hope the Wi‑Fi works” kind of way. Wooden beams, a porch dusted with snow, warm yellow light glowing through the windows. It looked like the kind of place influencers rented for aesthetic content, which I appreciated. If I was going to be emotionally tortured by my cousin for a week, at least the backdrop was nice.

Inside, the air smelled like pine and cinnamon. I immediately claimed the bigger bedroom.

“Obviously,” Rowan muttered.

“Obviously,” I echoed, tossing my bags onto the quilted bedspread. If he wanted the bigger room, he should’ve walked faster. Or been nicer. Or both.

For a few hours, things were almost… pleasant. We made cocoa. We played a board game. Rowan even laughed once, which felt like spotting a rare animal in the wild.

I let myself believe this trip might actually work.

Then the knocking started.

A soft, deliberate tap‑tap‑tap on the far wall.

I froze. “Did you hear that?”

Rowan didn’t look up from his phone. “Hear what?”

Tap‑tap‑tap.

“That.”

He shrugged. “Old cabin. Relax.”

Relax. Sure. Because nothing says “relax” like unexplained knocking in a remote forest.

But I let it go. I was determined to be normal. Calm. Unbothered. I wasn’t going to let a little noise ruin my perfect winter aesthetic.

Not yet.

The next morning, I woke to the smell of coffee and the sound of Rowan humming, which was suspicious on its own. He was standing at the stove, wearing the same hoodie he’d worn for three days straight, stirring a pot like he was auditioning for a cooking show he didn’t want to be on.

“Morning,” I said, rubbing my eyes.

“You look like a raccoon,” he said.

“Thank you,” I replied sweetly. “I try.”

We ate breakfast. A sloppy plate of eggs and corned beef hash, fresh from the can! We joked. We planned a hike later in the day. For a moment, I felt something I hadn’t felt in years: hope. Maybe we could fix things. Maybe we weren’t doomed to be the family’s favorite feud forever.

I got ready for our hike after breakfast. Pink boots, pink backpack, pink bear mace. Fashionable AND practical. Because of the snow we didn’t go too far but just enough to see the beautiful view from the cliff. The sun glowing off of the crystalized lake below. The trees painted with sheets of white snow. A few snide comments from Rowan, but nothing as bad as the usual torment he put me through. 

Growing up, Rowan always treated me cruelly. Whenever I’d tell on him or whenever any of our parents even saw what he put me through, it’d always be the same response… “Boys will be boys”. I hated that statement. It was just a way to excuse them being horrible. Once we got older he learned how to do more harm psychologically and emotionally so it wouldn’t be as noticeable. The worst part was, that, he was good at it. He knew what to say to really get under my skin like a parasite. My mother forced me to go on this trip hoping we could make amends. I’m hoping so, but I don’t have much left. 

That night, the knocking returned.

Tap‑tap‑tap.
Pause.
Tap.

I sat up in bed. “Rowan?”

No answer.

I stepped into the hallway. The cabin was silent except for the wind outside.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

This time, it came from the living room wall.

“Hello?” I whispered.

The knocking stopped.

I didn’t sleep the rest of the night.

Over the next two days, the cabin grew stranger.

A mug I left on the counter appeared on the floor.
A window I closed was suddenly open.
My reflection in the bathroom mirror seemed… delayed, just for a heartbeat.

I told Rowan.

He laughed. “You’re being dramatic.”

The words hit me like a slap. He’d said them my whole life. Whenever I cried, whenever I stood up for myself, whenever I tried to explain how his teasing actually hurt.

“You always make things up,” he added. “It’s exhausting.”

I swallowed the sting. “I’m not making anything up.”

“Sure,” he said, already walking away.

I hated how easily he could make me doubt myself.

That night, I dreamed of someone standing at the foot of my bed. When I woke, my bedroom door was open.

I was sure I’d closed it.

On the fourth night, I woke to a whisper.

“Lila…”

My eyes snapped open. The room was dark, the air cold.

“Rowan?” I whispered.

No answer.

I stepped into the hallway. The whisper came again; soft, coaxing, almost familiar.

“Lila…”

It drifted from the living room.

I followed it, heart pounding.

“Who’s there?”

Silence.

Then a shadow moved behind me.

I screamed.

Rowan burst out of his room. “What is wrong with you?!”

“There was - I heard - someone was here!”

He stared at me with a mix of annoyance and something else. Something like fear.

“You need to calm down,” he said. “Seriously.”

But I couldn’t. Not anymore.

The next morning, Rowan confronted me.

“You were in my room last night,” he said. “Standing over me.”

“What? No, I wasn’t!”

“I woke up and you were just… staring.”

My stomach dropped. “I don’t remember that.”

“Sure.” he said coldly. 

I went back to my room to try and relax and settle my confused and scared mind.

The day spiraled.

I kept losing time.
I’d blink and find myself in a different room.
I’d hear whispers that stopped when I turned my head.
I felt watched, even when I was alone.

By evening, the knocking had become pounding.

Rowan snapped. “I’m done. I’m leaving.”

“You can’t!” I cried. “The roads are iced over!”

“I don’t care. I’m not staying here with you like this.”

He shoved past me toward the door.

And then everything blurred.

A shout.
A slip.
A crash.
Snow swirling in the open doorway.
Silence.

When I came back to myself, Rowan was lying motionless outside, half‑buried in snow.

My breath fogged in the air.

“Oh,” I whispered. “Oh no.”

But even as I said it, something inside me felt… quiet. Peaceful.

Like the knocking had finally stopped.

CHAPTER TWO 
Aftermath
I didn’t cry right away.

People expect you to cry when something terrible happens, especially something “tragic,” which is the word everyone kept using, like they were all reading from the same script. But when I stood there in the snow, staring at Rowan’s still body, the cold biting through my coat, I didn’t feel anything.

Not shock.
Not horror.
Not grief.

Just… quiet.

Like someone had finally turned off a noise I didn’t realize had been blaring in the background.

But I knew how I was supposed to react, so I did. I screamed. I ran to him. I called for help with a trembling voice. I let the panic rise in my throat like a well‑rehearsed monologue.

And everyone believed me.

Why wouldn’t they? I’d always been good at performing.

The next few days blurred together; police questions, medical examiners, my mother’s frantic phone calls, Rowan’s mother’s sobbing. I floated through it all like I was underwater, watching the world move around me in slow motion.

I kept waiting for someone to look at me differently. To tilt their head and say, “Something’s off.”
But no one did.

They all saw what they wanted to see: a grieving cousin who had witnessed a terrible accident.

I didn’t correct them.

The funeral was small and cold, the kind of cold that seeped into your bones and made you feel hollow. I wore a black coat with a cinched waist and a tasteful veil. Understated, elegant, appropriately somber. People whispered that I looked “so composed,” which was apparently a compliment.

Rowan’s mother hugged me so tightly I could barely breathe. “He loved you, you know,” she said into my shoulder.

I nodded, because that was what she needed. But the truth was more complicated. Rowan loved me the way a cat loves a laser pointer… fascinated, annoyed, and always ready to pounce.

When the service ended, I stood by the car while my mother talked to relatives. Snowflakes landed on my gloves, melting instantly.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I froze.

It wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real. It was just the memory of the cabin, the echo of a sound that had followed me for days. I told myself that. I repeated it like a mantra.

But the tapping didn’t stop until I got in the car and shut the door.

Back home, everything felt too loud. The heater hummed. The refrigerator clicked. The house settled with little pops and creaks. Normal sounds, everyday sounds, but they all felt amplified, like the volume had been turned up without my permission.

My mother hovered constantly, offering tea, blankets, emotional support, and unsolicited advice. “You need rest,” she said. “You’ve been through so much.”

I nodded and smiled and let her fuss over me, because it was easier than explaining that I didn’t feel tired. I didn’t feel anything.

Not really.

At night, I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, waiting for sleep that never came. The house was quiet. My thoughts were not.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I sat up, heart pounding.

It wasn’t the walls.
It wasn’t the floor.
It wasn’t the wind.

It was inside my head. A memory, a rhythm, a pulse.

I pressed my palms to my temples. “Stop.”

The tapping stopped.

I lay back down, staring at the ceiling until morning.

A week after the funeral, my family insisted on a “healing dinner.” I didn’t want to go, but refusing would’ve caused more drama than attending, and I was too tired to deal with that.

The dining room was warm and bright, filled with the smell of roasted vegetables and the sound of forced cheer. My relatives talked in soft, sympathetic voices, like I was a fragile ornament that might shatter if someone spoke too loudly.

“How are you holding up, dear?” my aunt asked.

“You must be traumatized,” my uncle added.

My mother squeezed my hand. “She’s strong. She always has been.”

Rowan’s mother sat silently at the end of the table, eyes red, staring at her plate. I avoided looking at her for too long. Something about her grief felt too heavy, too real, too close.

I focused on my food instead, cutting my chicken into perfect little pieces.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

My fork hit the plate.

My mother looked up. “Sweetheart?”

I smiled. “Just thinking.”

After dinner, I slipped away to the bathroom and locked the door. I stared at my reflection in the mirror; flawless makeup, smooth hair, calm expression. I looked like someone who had everything under control.

But my eyes… my eyes looked tired. Not physically tired, but emotionally drained, like I’d been holding something heavy for too long.

I leaned closer to the mirror.

“Are you okay?” I whispered.

My reflection didn’t answer, obviously. But for a moment,  just a moment, it felt like she was studying me. Like she was waiting for me to admit something.

I turned away.

That night, I couldn’t sleep again. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, listening to the quiet hum of the house.

“You did what you had to,” a voice whispered.

I sat up, breath catching in my throat.

It wasn’t a ghost.
It wasn’t Rowan.
It wasn’t anything supernatural.

It was me.

A part of me I had never let speak before. A part that had been silenced by years of being told I was dramatic, too sensitive, too much.

A part that had finally snapped free in the snow.

“You don’t have to let them hurt you anymore,” the voice said.

I exhaled slowly. “I know.”

I wasn’t afraid of the voice.

I wasn’t fighting it.
I was listening.

And that was the part that scared me… or should have scared me.

But it didn’t.

Not at all.

CHAPTER THREE 
The House I Grew Up In
I didn’t plan on staying at my parents’ house for more than a few days, but somehow a few days turned into a week, and then two. My mother insisted it was “for the best,” which was her favorite phrase whenever she wanted me to do something I didn’t want to do.

“It’s just until you’re feeling more stable,” she said, smoothing my hair like I was a child. “You’ve been through so much.”

I didn’t argue. Arguing never worked in this house. It was like trying to shout into a snowstorm where the wind swallowed everything before it reached anyone’s ears.

Besides, I wasn’t sure what “stable” meant anymore.

My father barely acknowledged me when I came downstairs for breakfast the next morning. He sat at the head of the table, reading the news on his tablet, his coffee steaming beside him. He didn’t look up when I entered. He didn’t say good morning. He didn’t ask how I was doing.

He never did.

My mother fluttered around the kitchen like a nervous bird, placing a plate in front of me. “Eat something, sweetheart. You need your strength.”

My father turned a page on his tablet. “She needs routine,” he said, not looking at either of us. “Structure.”

My mother nodded quickly, as if he’d said something profound. “Yes, of course. Routine.”

I cut into my toast. “I’m fine.”

My father made a low noise, not quite a laugh, not quite a scoff. “You always say that.”

I didn’t respond. There was no point. He didn’t want an answer; he wanted the last word.

He always did.

Growing up, my father’s silence was the loudest thing in the house. He wasn’t cruel, exactly - just cold. Detached. Like he was observing us from behind glass. My mother tried to fill the space he left, but she was too soft, too apologetic, too afraid of upsetting him.

She apologized for everything.

If I cried, she apologized.
If I got upset, she apologized.
If I asked for attention, she apologized.
If my father ignored me, she apologized for him.

“Your father’s tired.”
“Your father’s stressed.”
“Your father doesn’t mean it.”
“Your father loves you in his own way.”

I used to believe her. I used to think love could look like silence, like distance, like a closed door.

Now I wasn’t so sure.

That afternoon, my mother asked if I wanted to help her decorate the living room for the holidays. I didn’t, but saying no would’ve led to a whole conversation about “healing activities,” so I agreed.

We hung garlands. We arranged candles. We placed a wreath on the mantle. My mother hummed softly, the same tune she always hummed when she was trying to pretend everything was fine.

“You know,” she said, adjusting a ribbon, “your father has been very worried about you.”

I almost laughed. “Really.”

“Yes,” she insisted. “He just… he doesn’t know how to show it.”

“He never has.”

She flinched, just slightly. “He tries.”

“No,” I said, more sharply than I intended. “He doesn’t.”

My mother’s eyes darted toward the hallway, as if my father might appear and scold her for letting me say such a thing. “Lila, please. He’s doing his best.”

I stared at her. “Is he?”

She didn’t answer.

She didn’t have to.

That night, I lay in my childhood bedroom, staring at the glow‑in‑the‑dark stars still stuck to the ceiling. I’d put them up when I was ten, convinced they made my room look magical. Now they just looked sad; little plastic lies pretending to be something bright.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I sat up.

It wasn’t the house.
It wasn’t the wind.
It wasn’t the cabin.

It was memory.

It was the sound of Rowan knocking on my bedroom door when we were kids, begging me to come play. It was the sound of him tapping his pencil during homework, driving me insane. It was the sound of him flicking my shoulder at family dinners, whispering jokes that made me laugh even when I didn’t want to.

It was the sound of him teasing me until I cried.
It was the sound of him apologizing afterward, awkward and insincere.
It was the sound of him growing sharper as we got older, learning exactly how to hurt me.

It was the sound of him falling in the snow.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I pressed my hands to my ears. “Stop.”

The tapping stopped.

But the quiet felt worse.

The next morning, my father finally acknowledged me. Sort of.

He stood in the doorway of the kitchen, arms crossed, watching me pour cereal. “Your mother says you’re not sleeping.”

I shrugged. “I’m fine.”

“You’re not,” he said, in that flat, matter‑of‑fact tone he used for everything. “You look exhausted.”

“Thanks.”

He ignored the sarcasm. “You need to get yourself under control.”

I froze. “Excuse me?”

“You’re letting this… situation consume you.”

“This situation?” I repeated. “You mean Rowan dying?”

He didn’t flinch. “Accidents happen.”

I stared at him, waiting for something; empathy, concern, anything. But his face was unreadable.

My mother rushed in, placing a hand on his arm. “She’s grieving,” she said quickly. “She needs time.”

“She needs discipline,” he said.

I set my bowl down. “I’m not a child.”

He looked at me then, really looked at me, and for a moment, I saw something in his eyes. Not anger. Not disappointment.

Fear.

It was gone in an instant.

“Get some rest,” he said, turning away. “You’re not yourself.”

But what if I was?

What if this was the most myself I had ever been?

That night, I dreamed of the cabin again. The snow. The cold. The open door. Rowan’s voice calling my name — not accusing, not angry, just… sad.

When I woke, my pillow was damp.

I wasn’t sure if I’d been crying or sweating.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I didn’t tell it to stop this time.

I just listened.

CHAPTER FOUR 
Cracks 
I woke up the next morning to the sound of my parents arguing downstairs, quietly, of course. They never fought loudly. Loud fights meant acknowledging something was wrong, and my parents were allergic to that.

I lay in bed, listening to the muffled voices drifting up through the floorboards.

“She’s not herself,” my father said, his voice low and clipped.

“She’s grieving,” my mother whispered back. “She needs support.”

“She needs discipline.”

There it was again. That word. Discipline. Like I was a misbehaving dog.

My mother’s voice trembled. “Please don’t start.”

“I’m not starting anything,” he said. “I’m stating facts.”

I stared at the ceiling, feeling the familiar tightness in my chest. This was the soundtrack of my childhood…  my mother pleading, my father dismissing, both of them pretending everything was fine as long as no one raised their voice.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I closed my eyes. “Not now.”

The tapping faded, but the tension didn’t.

When I came downstairs, my father was sitting at the table with his coffee, pretending to read the news. My mother stood at the stove, stirring oatmeal like it was the most important task in the world.

“Morning,” I said.

My mother turned, smiling too brightly. “Good morning, sweetheart. Did you sleep?”

“No.”

My father didn’t look up. “You should try harder.”

I blinked. “Try harder to sleep?”

“Yes.”

I waited for him to elaborate. He didn’t.

My mother shot him a warning look. “She’s doing her best.”

He set his tablet down with a sigh. “Her best isn’t enough right now.”

I felt something inside me tighten, like a thread pulled too taut. “What exactly do you want me to do?”

“Get control of yourself,” he said, as if it were the simplest thing in the world.

My mother stepped between us. “Please, both of you—”

“No,” I said, surprising myself. “Let him talk.”

My father’s eyes narrowed. “You’re being dramatic.”

There it was. The word that had shaped my entire life. Dramatic. The ultimate dismissal. The ultimate silencer.

I laughed, a sharp, humorless sound. “Of course I am.”

My mother flinched. “Lila—”

“No,” I said again. “I’m tired of pretending.”

My father stood up slowly, like he was preparing for a confrontation he thought he could win. “You’re tired? Your cousin is dead.”

The room went silent.

My mother’s hand flew to her mouth. “Please don’t—”

But he wasn’t finished.

“And instead of processing that like an adult, you’re making everything about yourself.”

I stared at him, stunned. Not because he said it, but because he meant it. He genuinely believed I was the problem. That I always had been.

Something cold settled in my chest.

“I’m not making anything about myself,” I said quietly. “I’m trying to survive.”

He scoffed. “You’re always trying to survive something.”

My mother stepped forward, voice trembling. “Please stop. She’s hurting.”

“She’s unstable, a spoiled, narcissistic little bitch!” he yelled.

I felt the air shift. My mother’s eyes widened, as if he’d crossed a line even she couldn’t ignore.

“Don’t call her that,” she whispered.

“Why not?” he asked. “It’s true.”

I didn’t realize I was shaking until my mother reached for my hand. I pulled away.

“I’m going for a walk,” I said.

My father shrugged. “Fine.”

My mother whispered, “Take a coat.”

I didn’t.

The cold hit me like a slap when I stepped outside, but I welcomed it. It felt honest. Clean. Nothing like the suffocating warmth of the house.

I walked down the street, past the neighbors’ holiday decorations, past the bare trees, past the places that used to feel familiar. My breath fogged in the air, each exhale a little cloud of proof that I was still here.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I stopped walking.

It wasn’t coming from the houses.
It wasn’t coming from the street.
It wasn’t coming from anywhere outside.

It was inside me.

A pulse.
A memory.
A reminder.

“You don’t have to let them hurt you,” the voice whispered.

I closed my eyes. “I know.”

“You don’t have to be small.”

“I know.”

“You don’t have to be quiet.”

My breath hitched. “I know.”

The voice softened, almost gentle. “Then stop pretending.”

I opened my eyes.

The world looked the same. Gray sky, quiet street, cold air,  but something inside me had shifted. A tiny crack widening. A truth I’d spent years avoiding finally pushing through.

I wasn’t the problem.

I never had been.

When I returned home, my mother was waiting in the foyer, wringing her hands.

“Sweetheart, please don’t be upset,” she said. “Your father didn’t mean—”

“Yes,” I said, brushing past her. “He did.”

She followed me into the living room. “He’s just… he’s scared.”

“Of what?” I asked. “Me?”

She hesitated. “Of losing control.”

I turned to her. “Of me losing control, or him losing control of me?”

She didn’t answer.

She didn’t have to.

That night, I lay in bed, staring at the glow‑in‑the‑dark stars again. They looked different now, not sad, but false. Like everything in this house. Like everything in my childhood.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I didn’t flinch.

I didn’t cover my ears.

I didn’t tell it to stop.

I just listened.

And for the first time, the tapping didn’t feel like a warning.

It felt like an invitation.

CHAPTER FIVE 
 Spreading 
I started waking up before dawn.

Not on purpose. My body just decided sleep was optional now. I’d open my eyes to the faint blue light creeping through the blinds, the house still and silent, the world outside frozen in place. It should’ve been peaceful.

It wasn’t.

It felt like the moment before something breaks.

I’d lie there, staring at the ceiling, listening to the quiet hum of the heater and the faint ticking of the hallway clock. Normal sounds. Familiar sounds. But they all felt… wrong. Too sharp. Too close.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

Sometimes it was soft, like fingertips on glass.
Sometimes it was louder, like knuckles on wood.
Sometimes it was inside my head, pulsing behind my eyes.

I didn’t tell my parents. They wouldn’t have understood.

Or worse, they would’ve pretended to.

My mother tried to keep things normal. She made breakfast every morning, humming the same nervous tune she always hummed when she was trying to hold the world together with sheer optimism.

“Eat something,” she’d say, placing a plate in front of me. “You need your strength.”

I’d pick at my food, pushing eggs around the plate until they looked like abstract art.

“You’re not eating,” she’d say, voice tight.

“I’m not hungry.”

“You need to try.”

“I said I’m not hungry.”

She’d flinch, like I’d slapped her. “Sweetheart, please don’t be upset.”

“I’m not upset.”

“You sound upset.”

I set my fork down. “Maybe I’m just tired of being managed.”

Her eyes filled with tears instantly, my mother’s superpower. “I’m only trying to help.”

I sighed. “I know.”

And I did know. She wasn’t the enemy. She was just… weak. Soft. A woman who had spent her entire life smoothing over cracks instead of fixing them.

But cracks don’t disappear.
They spread.

My father, on the other hand, didn’t bother pretending.

He watched me like I was a problem he needed to solve. A puzzle missing pieces. A malfunctioning appliance.

One morning, he cornered me in the hallway.

“You’re avoiding us,” he said.

“I’m taking space.”

“You don’t need space. You need stability.”

I laughed. “You mean control.”

His jaw tightened. “Your mother is worried.”

“She’s always worried.”

“She has reason to be.”

I crossed my arms. “Why? Because I’m not performing grief the way you want me to?”

His eyes narrowed. “You’re being dramatic.”

There it was again. The word that had shaped my entire life. The word that meant “stop feeling,” “stop talking,” “stop being inconvenient.”

I stepped closer. “Maybe I am dramatic. Maybe that’s who I am.”

He didn’t move. “It’s who you choose to be.”

“No,” I said quietly. “It’s who you made me.”

For a moment, just a moment… something flickered in his eyes. Not guilt. Not regret.

Fear.

Then it was gone.

“Get some rest,” he said, turning away. “You’re not thinking clearly.”

But I was.
Clearer than ever.

That afternoon, I found my mother crying in the laundry room. She wiped her eyes quickly when she saw me.

“Oh-hi, sweetheart. I’m fine.”

“You’re not.”

She forced a smile. “It’s just been a lot. For all of us.”

I leaned against the doorframe. “You don’t have to stay with him, you know.”

Her face crumpled. “Lila, please don’t start.”

“I’m not starting anything. I’m stating facts.”

“He’s your father.”

“And you’re my mother. Don’t you want more than this?”

She shook her head, tears spilling over. “I can’t leave. I wouldn’t know how.”

“You could learn.”

“I’m not strong like you.”

I almost laughed. Strong? Me? The girl who couldn’t sleep, who heard tapping in her skull, who felt like she was unraveling thread by thread?

But maybe she was right.
Maybe I was strong.
Just not in the way she meant.

She reached for my hand. “Please don’t be angry with him. He’s trying.”

“No,” I said softly. “He’s not.”

She looked away.

And I realized something then, something small but sharp, like a splinter under the skin.

My mother didn’t stay because she loved him.
She stayed because she was afraid of what would happen if she didn’t.

Fear was the glue holding this family together.

And I was starting to come unstuck.

That night, I couldn’t sit still. I paced my room, the glow‑in‑the‑dark stars watching me like tiny, judgmental eyes. I opened the window, letting the cold air bite at my skin. I closed it again. I sat on the bed. I stood up. I lay down. I stood up again.

Tap‑tap‑tap.

I pressed my palms to my temples. “Stop.”

The tapping didn’t stop.

It grew louder.

Faster.

Like a heartbeat.

Like footsteps.

Like someone knocking on a door that didn’t exist.

I squeezed my eyes shut. “Please.”

The tapping stopped.

And then a voice; soft, familiar, almost gentle whispered:

“You don’t belong here.”

My breath caught.

“You never did.”

I opened my eyes.

The room was empty.

But I wasn’t alone.

Not anymore.
