I was eighteen the last time I saw Pine Valley. Eleven years ago, I walked out of that cursed town with dirt under my fingernails and something heavy festering in my chest—something that never left. It didn’t matter how many miles I put between me and that place; the weight stayed. It lived inside me, pulsing like an echo I could never fully remember but could never quite forget either.

Now I was back, standing at the county line in a rented Jeep, watching fog roll across the cracked two-lane highway like smoke from a dying fire. The Pine Valley town sign leaned precariously to one side, paint peeling, bullet holes in the “E” and “Y” from some long-forgotten night of drunken vandalism. It still read:

WELCOME TO PINE VALLEY
Founded 1861 — Population: 3,812
Where the Pines Grow Tall and the Roots Grow Deep.

That last line made me sick. Roots growing deep. Yeah, no kidding.

I hadn’t come back for nostalgia or closure or some sentimental reconnection with my childhood. I’d come back for Evie.

My sister.

Evie was officially declared dead this year, even though they never found her body. She disappeared on the eve of her sixteenth birthday—just vanished from our house without a sound or struggle. No note. No signs of forced entry. One moment she was teasing me about my bad haircut, and the next she was gone. And the town just… moved on. The cops did the routine “we’re doing all we can” dance. Our neighbors left casseroles on the porch. Then silence. An entire community shifted their eyes and closed their mouths.

I remember the way our parents broke.

Dad stopped shaving. Stopped speaking. Eventually stopped going to work. He would just sit in Evie’s room in the dark and whisper things like, “We shouldn’t have stayed here. I knew something was wrong.”
Mom tried to keep us all together, but you can’t glue a family back with cold coffee and forced smiles. They moved away six months after Evie disappeared. We never talked about her again. Until last week.

The phone call was brief.
“They’re holding a memorial. In Pine Valley. For Evie.”
That was it.

No questions. No emotion. Just obligation.

But I couldn’t let it lie. Something about the timing—it was June. She disappeared in June. And they were doing this now?

I drove through town slowly, letting the memories cling to the edges of my vision like cobwebs. The diner still sat crooked on the corner of Main and Spruce, “Lou’s Pancakes” blinking weakly in red neon. The post office looked exactly the same. And above it all, the pines loomed like sentries—too tall, too quiet, stretching endlessly toward a sky that felt heavier than it used to.

Everything looked the same.

But it didn’t feel the same.

Grady still lived in town. He was my best friend growing up, the kind of kid who could find trouble like it owed him money. We were inseparable back then, always out past curfew, riding bikes with flashlights duct-taped to the handlebars, looking for haunted houses or weird cave entrances we were sure we’d find if we just looked hard enough. He was with me the night Evie disappeared. He was also the only person who never once said, “She probably just ran away.”

I pulled into his driveway, gravel crunching under the tires. His place was tucked behind a mechanic’s garage, rusted trucks lining the yard like forgotten carcasses. He came out before I could knock.

“Jesus,” he muttered, blinking at me like I was a ghost. “I thought you weren’t coming.”

“I thought the same thing,” I said, and we hugged like two men trying to hold onto something already slipping between their fingers.

⸻

Inside, the house was small but clean. A couch that had definitely been bought at a garage sale. A coffee table with deep gouges in the wood. Photos on the walls, most of them old and fading. Grady’s younger sister Lila stared out from one of them—her eyes big and bright, full of that impossible childhood light you only get before the world breaks something inside you. She disappeared a year before Evie did.

No one ever connected the dots.

No one wanted to.

⸻

We sat on the porch as the sun slipped behind the trees, drinking beer that tasted more like regret than anything else. I waited for Grady to bring it up, but he didn’t.

So I did.

“You remember the siren?” I asked. “In the woods?”

He stiffened immediately. Took a long sip from his can. “You’re not supposed to talk about that.”

“Who says?”

“The town.”

“You still play by their rules?”

He didn’t answer.

“I heard it the night Evie disappeared,” I continued. “You did too. We both heard it.”

Grady looked off into the trees. “I remember.”

“It wasn’t an animal. And it sure as hell wasn’t a storm warning.”

“I know.”

Silence stretched between us like a fault line.

Finally, he stood up and said, “Come inside. I want to show you something.”

⸻

He led me into his bedroom—nothing weird, just a mattress on the floor, clothes in a plastic tub, a cheap lamp. But under the bed, he pulled out a weathered notebook wrapped in plastic. He handed it to me without a word.

I opened it.

Inside were names.

Dozens of them. Maybe more. Written in neat, careful letters. Some had little notes next to them—dates, places, circumstances. But most were just first and last names.

And every single one was a kid.

All gone.

All “runaways” or “accidents” or “moved away suddenly.”

And next to almost every name… the same date: The first week of June.
Over and over.

My mouth went dry. My hands trembled.

Evie March. June 5, 2014.
Lila Duncan. June 6, 2013.
Cameron Burke. June 3, 2012.
And the list went back decades.

“How long have you been tracking this?” I asked, my voice barely more than a whisper.

“Since Lila,” Grady said. “They’ve been doing it for a long time.”

“Who?”

He looked me dead in the eyes.

“The town.”

End of Part one.
