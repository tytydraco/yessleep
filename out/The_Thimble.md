Heads up that this is a long story. I don't really know where to start, but I hope this all makes sense. It's still wrinkling my brain.   
.  
Before I get into it, some necessary backstory. I have neurofibromatosis type 2, or NF2 for short. Noncancerous growths (tumors) on the lining of my brain and spine. I have about half a dozen, mostly in my brain. In 2016 I had surgery to remove one and had a freak reaction that left me mute and paralyzed. Mentally I am all here but physically I have about as much movement as a department store mannequin, and because most people judge books by their covers they doubt the truth of this first fact. I am in a wheelchair. I can't leave the house without getting gawked at like I escaped the circus, and the majority of my friends and family dropped me like a hot potato. The medical community has barely tried to understand what happened to me and has been content to leave me as a mystery, a permanent question mark. Hearing loss is also a common symptom, so if you guessed that this cat was deaf, you would be correct.   
.  
Understandably I'm pretty depressed. I swap questionable memes with a friend and run a FB group with a few others, but other than that I don't interact with people much. I rarely even sit on the deck, preferring the black cave of my room to write on my computer. My mother - my only regular caregiver - dismisses my health claims, yet gets mad at me for reaching out to my doctors without first speaking to her. Doctor appointments are the only time I go out, which is when she tries to persuade me to take detours, which I always turn down. But recently after an appointment to go over an MRI and learn that my tumors hadn't grown in a year, I was feeling good enough that for once I agreed to a detour. I saw a sign advertising a garage sale and excitedly nodded at it, and my mother grinned as she turned down the street. Before my surgery, we used to go to garage sales all the time. We never bought anything - it was always baby clothes and exercise equipment - but it was always fun to look at other people's things and what they had once deemed important.   
.  
The house holding the garage sale wasn't anything special. It looked like it had been built in the forties but had been done over to look younger. Weeds burst through the pavement slabs of the driveway, covered with bed sheets and card tables laden with kitsch from the nineties. None of it was anything special as I expected, but a glint on a table caught my eye. A harder look told me it was a thimble. I wasn't an expert in antique sewing by any means, but I could tell it was old. I frantically looked between it and my mother to get her to notice it and pick it up. She did, turning it in the light. The dimples on it had been done by hand, and a simple wreath of flowers edged the bottom, but the loveliest detail was the set of cursive initials, L.D.R. I gave my mother another excited nod, hoping she understood that I wanted to buy it, and she put it in my lap as we ambled around the rest of the sale.   
.  
Nothing else interested us so we only brought the thimble up to the front of the lot. A man in his sixties, presumably the home owner, greeted us with a smile. When we produced our pending purchase though, it faltered. He took it from my mother's offering hand and turned it this way and that. His mouth moved in speech, but I couldn't guess what he said.   
.  
He must have spoken loud enough, because at his words a woman burst through the front door of the house behind him. She was in her nineties, clad in a nightgown and frail as a newborn foal. Her milky blue eyes were bright with emotion, fixing upon the thimble like it was some holy relic, until her eyes flicked to me. I'd grown used to be people staring at me, their eyes wordlessly asking "what the fuck" before deciding that I was a human interpretation of a footstool, but the look she gave me was something else. She was searching for something in me, that much I could tell, but my mother spoke up before I could figure out what, and the woman broke eye contact with me. My mother made yielding gestures as if to say never mind on the purchase, and I shook my head to second her motion. This seemed to placate the woman, albeit barely. The man, probably her son, placed the thimble in the claws of her hands, gripping her shoulders with consolation as he spoke to her. Eventually she calmed down and hobbled back inside, but not before casting me a final look. It could have been the appropriately timed breeze that drifted past, but I shivered.   
.  
As soon as the screen door shut behind her, the man started gushing apologies to my mother. She laughed and threw up hands as if to say "It's okay." I added nods of reassurance and hoped he understood. It was a gorgeous piece and I was a goblin and liked shiny things and wanted it, but it was clear that the thought of being separated from the trinket was beyond distressing, and I couldn't live with myself knowing that I had contributed to that.   
.  
The man's assent at last outweighing his remorse, my mother turned me and wheeled me back to the van, latching me in wordlessly. Though I knew she was content to leave the thimble with the woman, she looked distracted, lost in thought. Maybe she had seen an aunt at the end of her life experience something similar. I didn't ask and quite frankly didn't want to know.   
.  
She didn't have long to think. We lived about a half mile away, down a hill flanked by a path too narrow for a sidewalk. It was enough of a distance to make me forget about the woman and think about my MRI. Because conventional Western medicine had turned its back on me, I had little choice but to delve into the world of alternative medicine. I was a rational and science-fearing woman and was loathe to wander into the murkier waters of health maintenance, but I didn't look forward to a slow and painful death, so I stepped outside of my comfort zone and was rewarded for it. It was a delay to the inevitable, my tumors were likely still growing - albeit at a glacial speed, thank God - but for today I didn't fear them and what more they would take from me.   
.  
We turned down our driveway, the van rocking as we drove over lumpy pavement. It wasn't a long path, but long enough to dissuade trick or treaters come Halloween. Fir trees draped over the length of it, early autumn sun breaking through the boughs. The driveway in front of our house was gravel and bathed in afternoon light and my mother set me on it as she unloaded the van, leaving me to bask in its happy warmth. I looked around, breathing deeply of the air just barely too warm to call crisp, and gave my mother another frantic nod towards the driveway as she came to collect me. I loved the bad weather that the coming season promised, but I knew I was an idiot to go inside on such a nice day.   
.  
We were hit by a windstorm a few days before, leaving the asphalt covered in a maze of branches and pinecones that my mother wheeled me around. Juncos and chickadees flitted through the fence as we went, watching us pick our way through the twigs until we reached the mailbox at the end of the driveway. My mother gathered what filled the box, mostly junk mail and a Renton Reporter, before turning around and heading back to the house, until a glint of something in the driveway caught her eye.   
.  
It was a thimble.   
.  
I could all but hear her laugh as she came forward to collect it, saying it must have fallen in the folds of the blanket in my lap and fell out moments ago, but my heart began to race. The thimble had not left the garage sale. The man had placed it in what I assumed to be his mother's hands, it had stayed with her. There was no way it could be in our driveway. Maybe the woman dropped it here, I tried to tell myself. Yep, the ninety year old woman who could barely walk flew down the hill separating our houses, found our driveway by dumb luck, and placed the thimble down upon it. I had entirely too many brain cells to believe that, but I didn't fancy having a panic attack that would hit if I didn't, so I swallowed hard and gave my mother a reassuring nod. We got it by mistake, random chance. I was prone to ridiculous explanations, nothing weird had actually happened here. But as my mother placed the thimble in my lap and wheeled me back, I couldn't help but think I was right.   
.  
\-----  
.  
When we got back, my mother placed the thimble on the corner of the kitchen table and set me up in the living room in unintentional full view of the piece. It was so unassuming, such a simple little thing, but looking at it sent chills down my spine.   
.  
Some time later that day she told me she needed to run to the store quick. The place was about five minutes away and she was rarely gone for longer than an hour. I loved these trips because I was finally truly alone in the house, but for the first time in years I didn't want her to leave. "I have a weird feeling" wasn't going to be enough of a reason for her to stay though, so I smiled and nodded as she grabbed her shopping bags and headed out the door.   
.  
As she pulled out of the driveway and disappeared from sight, I focused on the cats curled up and sleeping in the sun. They were far from worried, so why should I be? Plume twisted to expose more of her belly to the sun when I felt a series of thuds reverberate through the floor. I jerked my head around, expecting to see a stack of magazines falling to the floor, but nothing. The thuds continued - they must have been coming from the kitchen, they were close - but I could see no movement to back up what I felt. It felt exactly like my brother shuffling through the kitchen to get a cup of coffee in the morning, but he was about 2,500 miles too far away for that to be a possibility. My pulse kicked up, my throat running dry as I frantically looked for moving shadows (as if that made things less scary?) but saw nothing. The thuds continued, and I was so distracted by trying to find their source that I practically shot out of my chair when I saw the front door crack open and my mother step inside laden with groceries. She laughed at my uneasy smile, and though I had plenty of things I wanted to tell her - something was in the kitchen, you just left how are you back already - I knew she would say I was imaging things, and not needing to feel any more crazy than I felt, I kept my mouth shut.   
.  
Nothing else happened the rest of the day and I was beginning to think I had made everything up and spooked myself. I suddenly felt like I hadn't slept in centuries as my mother wheeled me down the hall, and I was a zombie as she got me ready for bed. Sleep blessedly claimed me quickly and no dreams bothered me, but after a while a light flicked on and pulled me awake. I blinked in confusion, groggily looking around for some hint of the time. My mother would turn on the hall light to tell me she was walking down it, but she never pulled me from sleep without opening the curtains and slowly getting me ready for the day. I lifted my head to check the state of her bed, if the cats had claimed it in the moments she had been up, but seeing it made my heart stop.   
.  
She was still fast asleep.   
.  
Swallowing hard, I glanced at the clock beside me. 2:34, An hour that no one in this house had any business being awake at.   
.  
The hall light turned off as my heart began to thud painfully in my chest. Who switched it on to begin with? I couldn't imagine who but didn't want an answer; I knew I wouldn't like it. I jammed my eyes shut and somehow fell back asleep, but it was restless. In my regular moments of lucidity, I resolved to beg my mother to take the thimble back.   
.  
When the morning finally arrived it felt like it had somehow taken both five minutes and five millennia. My mother got me dressed, got me in my chair, yadda yadda. Plume stayed in the room to monitor me getting ready for the day, impatient to get to her self imposed job of leading us down the hall to the rest of the house. At last we followed her, turning down the hall to an array of cat toys. This wasn't unusual, Plume and her brother Captain often turned the space into a playground while we slept. We stopped to watch her saunter through the wreckage, giving occasional swats to toys she passed, but she became engrossed in something in particular.   
.  
It was a thimble.   
.  
The cats knocked it off the table and whacked it into the hall, I quickly told myself, but my heart began to race and my ears started to ring as Plume batted into the kitchen. I could barely see the thing, but could tell it was upright. They knocked it around and it just landed like that, I reasoned as my mother wheeled me through the hall, but the growing knot in my chest was impossible to ignore.   
.  
My mother set me up on my computer, and before she had a chance to retrieve the thimble, I said, "Take that thing back up the hill. We got it by mistake, you saw how upset that woman was when we tried to buy it." Maybe if we got rid of it then the activity would stop.   
.  
She scoffed and waved her hand, thinking that my request was ridiculous, but she could see how worked up I was and agreed to take it up in an hour or two.   
.  
Waiting was torture on a good day, but I was certain that several millennia had passed before my mother headed for the door. She asked if I wanted to come with, but I shook my head; I would only slow her down.   
.  
I tried to focus on the cats as they chased each other, but I glanced out the window too often to really know what they were doing.   
.  
After about a century, or rather twenty minutes, my mother returned to the house. Her face was emotionless as I watched her walk up to the door, and she said nothing when she stepped inside. She couldn't tell me anything better than it was gone and out of our lives for good, so why was she hesitating?   
.  
"Well?"  
.  
She continued as though she hadn't heard me, but confusion began to distort her face. After a few more moments of silence, she relented:   
.  
"She died."  
.  
Chills rolled down my spine. I had a million questions, but I waited for her to continue.   
.  
"Yesterday, about a half hour after we left. She had a massive heart attack." My mother busied herself with clutter on the table, lost in thought. My heart began to thud in my chest. So now not only was I supposed to believe that a ninety year old woman hobbled half a mile to randomly find our house, but now she had a time limit? I swallowed hard, keeping my eyes on my mother. Surely she had more to say. Surely she would disprove my crazy thoughts.   
.  
"Lenore Dolores Rothchild," she added. "Was 94. Her husband gave her the thimble about a year after they were married and he was killed in a car crash not long after that."  
.  
My heart stumbled and fell. Interesting information, but it gave absolutely no reason as to why I was being haunted by a thimble. I swallowed hard, looking at my mother with pleading eyes and wished she could sense my anguish and do something, but she merely turned to the wood stove to feed another log into it.   
.  
This was good, I told myself, firm enough that I couldn't believe any other option. The thimble was gone, that weird stuff wouldn't happen anymore and I could make up something new to worry about. This would just be a weird memory.   
.  
\---  
.  
Well, it's been a week and a half and things are still happening. Weird thuds in an empty house, lights turning on that my mother is nowhere near to. I haven't told her about stuff, by the way. She has been pretty dismissive about a lot of stuff in the past and I didn't want to repeat that anguish, so I've kept it all in. You're the first ones hearing about it. Don't know why I want to tell people so bad, it's probably just my brain tumors making me imagine stuff. That's what's scaring me the most, the possibility that none of this is real and I'm freaking out over nothing. If you read this far, can you do me one favor? Be more open to the idea of this stuff happening. I'm still trying to make sense of what happened to me, but something like this has unquestionably happened to someone else, and I bet they doubt what they have experienced and feel stupid for thinking it's true. A lack of understanding in multiple capacities has hurt me more than I can say, I beg you to try and see things differently for others.
