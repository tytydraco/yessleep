Hello all. My computer has just flickered on, the lights outside must be fucking with the power again. I'm typing this as fast as I can, so apologies for any misspellings. My hands are shaking. The fire went out hours ago and I'm too afraid to relight it, relight my humble beacon against the lights. Those goddamn lights.

The village of Nenana is a peaceful place. Less than 50 of us. We live out in the bushes, Central Alaska, north of any reasonable human, along the Sushana river. It's quiet here. We hunt, fish, work the forest for timber and keep to ourselves. Folks from Outside pass through often, pause, marvel at the little log houses and gawk as we go about our daily lives. I was born here. I was raised here. And from the looks of things, I will die here. I am a young man, 20 winters. I was raised by my grandparents after my father passed in a blizzard while hunting. I still remember his frozen body as it was dragged in the sled behind the snowmachine. I remember his face, blue-black like the crimson dark of night. I remember his eyes. I remember I watched as the crowd of people gathered, a lone drumbeat as the heartbeat of our community in this moment. I saw a raven fly. We gathered to lay him to rest, an affair that took up the space of a whole day and everyone's attention.

It started months ago. Or was it weeks? Hell, it might've been yesterday. First, Old Isaiah didn't stop in. I was working my incredibly boring job at our town's only gas station and general store. Sitting behind my desk I watched our people ebb and flow, tumbling through life like the river. Every day that man would come in. He shuffled with a slight limp, walking like a just born caribou calf. He lived on the edge of town, in a small run down cabin that had been left behind when some family moved Outside. I found comfort in his visits, in our silent exchanges as he purchased the same bag of coffee grounds and gave the same nod and mumble as I handed him his change. Then one day he didn't come. I waited, drumming my fingers on the countertop in time to the twangy country music on the radio. Zack Bryan, maybe? I always hated him. But the old feller didn't show. I brushed it off at first, maybe his shitbox pickup had finally quit on him. Maybe he simply didn't want coffee. Maybe he was out of money. I passed his absence off and continued my day. 0 customers. New record.

A few days passed. Still no Isaiah. No one said anything, but I started noticing it in the way folks looked over their shoulders. It was like a quiet breath had passed through the village, taking something with it.

Then the dogs started acting strange. My neighbor, a crusty old man named Jimbo with a beard that looked like frostbite, came in one morning—eyes wide, skin pale like he’d seen something deep. He said all three of his sled dogs had broken their leads and run off in the night. Just tore free, left the collars behind. "Tails tucked. Howlin’ like the spirits were on their asses." That’s what he said. I laughed it off, but there was something in his voice. He wasn’t joking. Jimbo don’t scare easy.

The air felt… wrong.

The lights started acting strange after that.

You hear stories, growing up here. How the northern lights are the spirits of the dead. That you should never whistle at them or wave, or they'll come down and take you with them. I always thought that was just stuff my grandma said to keep me from playing outside too late. But then one night, I looked up, and they were… pulsing. Not like normal. Not pretty or gentle. These ones twisted, seethed, like something alive. They weren’t green. They were red. Blood red, like an open wound across the sky.

And I swear to God, I heard something whisper my name.

That was the first time I dreamed of the thing. It stood just past the treeline behind my cabin. Seven feet tall. Blacker than shadow. Its arms were too long, and its eyes didn’t glow, they *swallowed* light. No face. No sound. Just... there. Watching. When I woke up, there were footprints in the snow. Big ones. Leading up to my window, then stopping.

I told myself it was a moose. A weird dream. Some dumb coincidence.

But I didn’t sleep the next night.

We’re Gwich’in here. At least, most of us. My family too, though we’ve got some Koyukon in our blood, way back. This land, it’s ours—not just because we live here, but because it remembers us. Our stories are written in the rivers, in the bones buried beneath the permafrost. The ancestors are supposed to watch over us. Guide us.

But lately it feels like they’ve turned their backs.

And then Isaiah’s cabin caught fire. No one saw it happen. Just smoke in the morning and ash by noon. No body found. No tracks. Just scorched earth and twisted timber. Folks said he probably left town. Took a lantern with him and knocked something over. But I know Isaiah. The man could barely walk. He wouldn't have gone anywhere.

After that, more people started disappearing. Not in crowds. Just one by one. Like the lights would reach a little lower each night, and someone would vanish.

No one talked about it. Not directly. But you could feel it—like the whole village was holding its breath. Doors locked earlier. Radios went silent. Everyone was *watching* the sky.

And I...

I started seeing things. Shapes. Movements in the trees. Reflections in the windows that weren’t mine. My own shadow stretching longer than it should. The lights got *inside*. Not the house. Inside *me*.

The elders used to talk about things—not to be spoken of after dark. Stories about creatures that live between worlds. The ones that come in winter, when the light hangs in the sky and the snow deadens all sound. My grandma used to say there were places the spirits never stopped walking, places too old and too quiet for us to understand. I never believed in those stories until now.

Old Annie, one of the last true matriarchs in the village, started talking nonsense. Said she saw something with bone antlers and a stitched mouth walking along the ridgeline. She said it wore the skins of people it took. She said it mimicked voices, calling from the woods in the tones of lost loved ones. A trickster spirit. A hunter.

We didn’t believe her.

She froze to death on her porch the next night. Sitting straight up, eyes open, mouth slack like she’d seen God and He’d walked past without noticing her.

After that, some of the Gwich’in packed up. Said they were heading Outside, or down to stay with relatives in some other village. The old ways said to leave when the spirits get thick in the air. When the dogs refuse to go outside, and the ravens stop circling. I wanted to go too. But something kept me here.

Or maybe I just didn’t want to bring it with me.

It’s hard to explain the way the lights look now. They don’t shimmer. They crawl. Like they’re made of something solid, reaching down from the heavens. You stare too long and your thoughts turn inside out. You start remembering things you never lived. Blood in the snow. Screams that don’t belong to anyone you know. You forget where you are.

One night I heard my dad’s voice outside the cabin. He’s been dead ten years.

“Open up, boy,” he said. Just like he used to when he’d get home from hunting. “It’s cold as a witch’s tit out here.”

I almost opened the door. Almost.

Then I saw the shadow pass the window.

It wasn’t him.

Now it’s just me. Everyone’s gone. Or dead. I don’t know anymore.

The general store’s empty. The generator blew two nights ago. The river’s frozen stiff. No snowmachines. No dogs. No one.

I’m holed up in the old garage cabin now. Mine was too close to the treeline. Too exposed. I’ve boarded the windows. I’ve blocked the chimney. I haven’t seen the stars in days—just the lights. Always the lights.

It stands outside now. I see it every night. Just past the tree line. Antlers scraped raw. Eyes like holes in the world. Waiting. Watching.

Sometimes I think it is the lights. Or that the lights are just the smoke it gives off. The radiation of its mind burning through the sky.

I don’t sleep anymore. I don’t eat much. I keep this computer warm in my sleeping bag just so I can write. Just so someone might know what happened here. Maybe if the next person reads this, they won’t make the same mistakes. Maybe they won’t whistle at the lights.

They never tell you that madness is gentle at first.

Just a flicker.

A whisper.

Then it opens its eyes.
