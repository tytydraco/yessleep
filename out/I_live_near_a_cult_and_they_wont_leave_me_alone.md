**The Hermit’s Log**


I’ve lived up in these woods for years, rarely coming down for supplies. I’d maybe check in with my remaining kin, just depending on how passive aggressive their messages were. For men like me, isolation is just practical. Loneliness isn’t as bad as people make it seem. It’s like a blanket, warm and comforting but can smother you all the same. I never was too fond of people, even before the war. Well, people never seemed too fond of me either. Kids thought I was dumb, adults thought I was strange, and hell even my parents found me too meek.

 I’ve always been big, but truth be told there wasn’t much that didn’t scare the bejesus out of me. Dad would often say “boy as big as you are for your age, you sure do nothing with it.” I’m sure dad loved me in his own way, but he’d get a bit carried away with how hard he teased me. At home, in public, holidays, birthdays, night, or day; dad always had a remark to say. He was the one who started calling me Kudzu, given the way I’d “creep around like the kudzu vine.” Before long the whole town started calling me Kudzu, even till this day the nickname has stuck. 

My only friend was Briar, our bull-headed hunting hound. Briar was supposedly a purebred bluetick coonhound, though dad always said he looked and acted “like a damn mutt.” Named for being a briar in dad’s side, it always seemed like I was the only one old Briar liked. 

Though I struggled to talk to people, I could talk to Briar for hours. He’d always listen, sitting by my side just staring off into the woods until I was done. He’d never interrupt or make cruel jokes, he understood what it was like to be a disappointment. Maybe that’s why dad despised him. Maybe he saw too much of his son in the dog or too much of his dog in his son, but he made me put Briar down. I begged and pleaded, I assured dad that Briar still had energy left in him. 

“No, Briar’s too old… Lived past his purpose, what is a hunting hound that can’t hunt? Give him dignity, boy.” Dad snarled, knowing damn well Briar wasn’t nearly as old or sickly as he made him out to be. I couldn’t pull the trigger, I just couldn’t. I stood there, shaking and crying to dad’s disgust. 

“God’s sake boy, can you do anything but mope around and eat? All you do is creep and eat, eat, eat! Just like the vine, Kudzu? Did I have a daughter after all? The goddamn Kudzu Queen, fat beauty of the south?”

CLICK!

I never really made friends after Briar, my only real escape was going deep into the woods to think. My grades were a train wreck and nothing actually gave me fulfillment, I had no purpose until the war… An evil, cruel purpose but a purpose none the less. The drums of war can change anyone, strong men can crack and timid men can grow vicious. While many men broke and suffered, I grew and by god I thrived. I was strong for once, a terror of the jungles. My aim was perfect… Biting through a man’s jugular came easier to me than small talk. Briar is far from the only innocent blood on my hands. I was different in the jungles, barely a man but I was alive. The thrill gave me life, it gave me purpose, and it gave me faith in a higher power. 

This was short lived, I was dragged back to the states when David finally fell Goliath, or well the media did. Pathetic, I would have fought for five lifetimes if given the chance, heaven and hell made one. Just like that, my purpose was stripped from me.  Like a pack of hungry coyotes, the guilt had begun to ravage what was left of me. Treated with nothing but contempt and hatred by civilians, I fled deep into my hometown’s forest. A poor replacement for the jungles, but it’s the closest thing that gives me an ounce of comfort and confidence. 

I have lived here ever since, in my new jungle and with a new Briar. Similarity is an unfulfilling poison. The new Briar is a dumb, useless mutt but truthfully I would have gone insane without him. I’m sure people whisper that my mind isn’t right behind my back, but I know the things I’ve seen are as real as day.  My property is deep within the woods, a small ramshackle cabin that’s about as inviting as a copperhead. 

I think all of its creaks and imperfections give it character, but I think most people assume it’s some crazy hillbilly’s shack. Miles away from the town, I lived without neighbors until that church was built all of those years ago. An odd place for a church that big, but I of all people can understand the allure of these woods. However, the scenery is not what brought these people down here. 

Originally, it was just the junkie pastor and his closest followers from god knows where, some rockstar fat cats probably running away from whatever scandal muddied their fame. It grew and it grew fast, before long that celebrity pastor had a firm grip on the town. Sinking whatever was left of his fortune into the construction of the Eternal Jubilee Church, it appears that pastor Lysander has increased his wealth tenfold. 

There’s always some service or event going on, without fail. Night or day, the church is never completely empty… Me and the congregation have lived in somewhat of a stalemate for a few years, as they’ve learned not to knock on my door anymore. I thought they were some type of mormons or scientologists at first, but from what I’ve heard and observed this is far from the truth. I don’t understand their religion and I’ve made it very clear that I don’t want to. This hasn’t stopped them from straying too close to my property, though. With a church that goddamn big, why they need to rustle around my property is beyond me.

I can be polite in my own way when dealing with unwanted visitors, but I draw the line at putting up some weird two pronged pole in front of my property. The warning shot I fired sent the message loud and clear, had them running back to their pastor with their damned emblem. I wouldn’t say I’m an aggressive man, but I will not tolerate trespassing and them fiddling with my property. I’m not exactly as faithful as I was, but I will be damned before I let no faith of mine be displayed in front of my home. 

I thought they finally got the message, until a few weeks back. Every other day, anytime between the hours of 2-4 in the morning, you can hear a group of people rustling around my home. I thought it could possibly be an animal, but it’s become increasingly apparent it’s people, multiple people. This drives the new Briar into a frenzy, though we can rarely actually catch them in the act. You can hear them all scatter off like rats when I come out onto the porch, in every different direction. Some may say I should go to the sheriff’s department, but trust me, I’m considered a shell-shocked loon up in the woods. They wouldn’t take me seriously, regardless, the church’s roots may run deeper than we know.

Being surrounded in the woods would scare almost any man, but I am no stranger to this. Of all the people they could choose to mess with, they made a very very terrible mistake. Maybe they’re trying to give me my purpose back, a true sign from god.

What they actually do out in the woods is a mystery to me, though I can imagine it’s anything but good. I will occasionally find evidence of their congregations scattered all across the woods: remains of bonfires, two-pronged symbols, and golden coins interestingly enough. Unsettling, but I hadn’t found actual proof that they were dangerous until recently. One morning Briar led me to a dead deer, a bull’s horn had been shoved right through its belly and a coin was placed in its mouth. It was a big buck too, I couldn’t imagine it would be easy to kill without a gun. Truly sick people, but it was impressive. 

I don’t know what they want from me or my land, but I’m no stupid deer to sacrifice. Part of me wanted to confront the pastor of the church, but I’d be a fool to enter the wolves’ den. They were always friendly enough when trying to convert me at my doorstep, but clearly we are past the pleasantries. 

Those damned poles were placed closer and closer to my property, they were actively getting closer each passing night.

One night, I decided to wait for them on my porch with a rifle. Around 3:30, I was about ready to call it quits when I heard something faint off in the distance. It was singing, these bastards were singing in the middle of the woods. So much for their hiding and sneaking about, I would punish their arrogance. Nobody mocks me in my jungle. Gun in hand, me and Briar ventured off into the darkness to put an end to this once and for all. The deeper we went, the light of a massive bonfire grew brighter and brighter. I don’t know exactly what I was expecting, but definitely not what I saw.

A circle of large wooden symbols surrounded an opening within the forest, a bull’s head was nailed to each in a sickening display. Around fifteen people, naked and bedecked in golden jewelry, danced wildly around the fire. Singing in some language I couldn’t recognize, they sounded beautiful and almost siren-like. Chief amongst the congregation, four men dressed in an ancient king’s robes stood tall, each bearing a bull’s horn in one hand and a golden two pronged scepter in the other. Pointing their scepters at a random member of the congregation, the cultist then happily plunged their forearm into the roaring fire. Graciously crying out in ecstatic pain, the cultist held out a scorched hand to the rest of the congregation. 

A man hiding his face behind a bull’s head placed a single golden coin in the cultist’s raw palm. A golden laurel crown was placed upon his brow and he began to sing. The rest of the congregation then turned on their fellow believer, brutally beating the coin-bearer as he cackled with glee. Vicious and unrelenting, the congregation didn’t stop until the coin-bearer was just a puddle of flesh and broken bones. They began to fight over his jewelry like a pack of wolves tearing into a carcass, leaving his body bruised and bare. The four leaders each placed a tender kiss on his bloody cheek before giving the rest of the cultist to the fire.

I faltered, I wish I could say I fired off a shot and made these freaks scatter off into the darkness. I just felt small, even smaller than I did as a child. I was just a kudzu vine, slowly creeping away. This was no jungle and this dog wasn’t Briar, the fire and noise must have scared him off since he was nowhere in sight. The old Briar would have stood his ground. He was a brave dog, everything that I wasn’t. The war was long over and my bravery with it. 

I turned tail and ran, directions be damned. Though branches and bushes riddled me in cuts and bruises, I ran deeper into the forest without looking back. I needed to get away, this is what people bring. They bring nothing but evil and mockery. I need to go deeper and further away from civilization. Leave everything behind.

From the darkness, I heard a familiar howl. Not the low growl of the new Briar, but the loud bawling bark of my childhood. An old bluetick coonhound focused its gaze upon me, its collar was of golden thorns and beneath it lie the bloodied carcass of a dog far bigger in size. Briar, it was Briar. I don’t know how to describe it, but there was something off about his form. He was exactly how I remembered him but also wrong at the same time, like a faded memory given life. 

Holding his golden chain, a curvaceous figure weaved itself elegantly between the trees. It resembled an attractive woman, supple and pale, with a cloak made of shimmering coins. It stood almost as tall as the trees with many gilded chains piercing its snow-white flesh. Its face was chiseled and masculine, with what looked like melted gold covering its eyes and the topside of its head.

The forest began to shift and change, I was back in the jungles in that instance. It was wrong but it felt right. My terror morphed into relief, I missed this feeling. I missed my purpose… I missed Briar…

“BEAR WITNESS…..”  it hissed.  Its voice was high and haunting but beautiful like a choir of angels and a nest of serpents intermingling in a blasphemous harmony. 

I don’t know if I was sobbing or laughing, but I held out my hand to pet my old friend. Briar, beginning to growl, clamped his sharp teeth onto my hand as the sounds of gunshots rang out into the distance. Just like that, I was back in the forest. Briar and his new owner were gone without a trace, I was alone in the darkness. Was it real? It had to be. New Briar’s corpse was still there, savagely ripped apart. Pain throbbed through my hand, revealing a bite mark and a golden coin in my palm.
