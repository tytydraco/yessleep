I started this job a few days ago. Remote security work—private land, recurring trespassers. The company’s private, and so is the property.

When I first got the offer, I was thrilled.

I live alone and had been saving up to buy a home for my fiancée and me. This felt like the big break I needed.

I went through orientation—a simple one-on-one with one of the instructors. Standard private security stuff. He explained a few things about the post: there’s no road access, so I’d be transported in via ATV. I’d be issued a satellite phone for emergencies and to stay in contact with the control center. He gave me some more details that don’t feel relevant right now, but most importantly, I received my start date and the location I’d be reporting to.

I had just over two weeks before deployment, so I spent that time purchasing supplies for my rotation, along with all necessary work equipment—ammunition, batteries, a backup radio, flashlights. The usual gear. I was excited but a little nervous, too.

Two weeks passed, and I reported to the designated location right on time. The paved road eventually gave way to a dirt path that led to a garage-like structure with its doors wide open. Two ATVs were parked just outside—one of them fitted with cargo racks.

Two guys in the same uniform as mine were waiting there, so I knew I was in the right place. I rolled up in my SUV, and they waved me into the garage. I parked and jumped out to greet them. They introduced themselves as Nathan and Jeff. Nathan looked to be about my age, maybe late twenties. Jeff was older—mid-forties, probably.

“How you doin’? Anon, right?” Jeff asked.

“Yessir, that’s me. Not doing too bad. How about yourself?”
“Good, good,” he said, nodding toward Nathan. 

“This is Nate. He’s my partner today—he’ll be driving your bags up with us.”

I shook Nathan’s hand. “Appreciate you,” I said.
He just smiled and nodded.

“You guys posted out here?” I asked.

“Oh, no, no,” Jeff said. “We just shuttle the guards up to the site and then head back. We’ll come get you again when your rotation’s up.”

“Ahh, gotcha. Gotcha,” I said.

“Let’s get the four-wheelers loaded up and we’ll get moving,” Jeff said.

We loaded my gear and began the ride into the forest. It took about an hour and forty-five minutes, give or take. I knew we’d arrived when we pulled up to a tall chain-link gate with several locks and an ID scanner mounted on a post beside it.

Nathan dismounted, unlocked the gate, and scanned his keycard. The red LED flashed green, and a loud click echoed from the locking mechanism. He pulled both sides of the gate open, we drove through, and he followed behind us, locking it again.

As we drove up a dirt trail, a clearing came into view. There was a small, single-story prefab house with a shed near the back. It looked like one of those temporary construction trailers. We pulled up in front, and they led me inside to show me around.

Honestly, I was pretty hyped. The place seemed relatively new—standard trailer-apartment setup, clean and functional. They showed me the workroom, which had six CCTV monitors mounted on the wall, labeled 1 through 6. A satellite phone sat neatly on the desk. There was another desk with a clipboard, paper, and pen.

“This is where you’ll be most of the time when you’re not out on the property,” Jeff said, handing me the satellite phone. “Keep this on you at all times—and I mean at all times. It’s the only way dispatch can talk to you out here. Cell service is almost nonexistent—though you might get lucky.”

He pulled open a drawer and retrieved a thick three-ring binder.

“Anything you see—on the cameras or while patrolling—needs to be reported on these forms,” he said.

“This is your post instructions. Spend your first night or two reading through it.”

“Sounds good to me,” I replied.

“Just follow the post orders to a T and you’ll do just fine. This is easy money,” he said.
I laughed. “Yeah, it definitely seems like a nice gig.”

But he didn’t laugh or smile. He just walked past me toward the front door. Then he handed me a key ring and led me outside to the shed. Inside was a John Deere Gator and a line of gas cans along the wall.

“Use the Gator to get around the property. You’ve got plenty of gas for the two weeks,” he said.

He locked the shed, and we returned to the ATVs, where Nathan had finished unloading my supplies. I shook both their hands and said goodbye. Jeff gave me a firm handshake before they rode off.

I began settling in—moving food to the kitchen, clothes to the bedroom, organizing my things. By the time I finished, it was about 5:30 and I was exhausted. I took a shower, then wandered out to the common area.

I knelt in front of the entertainment center and turned on the TV. No signal—just as expected. I opened a cabinet and found a stack of DVDs and an old player. I pulled them out, flipped through the titles for something to have on in the background while I read.

*Spaceballs.* That’ll work.

I popped in the disc, grabbed the remote, navigated to the menu, and hit Play. I dropped the remote on the stand and walked to the office to grab the post orders.

As I passed the camera feeds, I glanced at the screens. One showed a fork in a dirt trail. Another was aimed low to the ground near what looked like a small cave. One was mounted in a tree overlooking dense forest. Another pointed at the gate. One showed a tree line and a clearing.

The sixth camera read: **No Signal.**

I clicked a few buttons on the control panel, but nothing changed. I noted it on the clipboard, then took the binder and returned to the living room to read.

The post orders began with typical company policies—history, dress code, etc. But once I got to the actual site instructions, I started paying attention.

I was to start my day around 7:30, shortly after sunrise, and conduct an initial patrol to check for issues from the night before. After that, I was expected to patrol every two hours until sundown. Just before sundown, I was to check the entry gate. I was required to be armed at all times while outside.

At sundown, I was to return to the house and monitor the cameras for two hours, after which I could go about my night—checking the cameras periodically. There was also a section detailing when to use the radio and what qualified as an emergency.

I closed the binder and tossed it aside. I’d had my fill of work for the day. I watched the movie for a bit, grabbed a snack from the kitchen, and checked the cameras again—nothing unusual.

I stayed up another hour or so, checking the cameras a few more times. I was lying in bed, just starting to drift off, when the floodlights outside tripped. My heart dropped.

I jumped up, grabbed my handgun, and moved to the window. I yanked the blinds open—and saw a few deer wandering in the clearing. Relief hit me like a wave. I put the gun away and returned to bed.

That night, I dreamt about the Mega Maid scene from *Spaceballs.*

The next day was quiet again. I woke up around 6:30 like before, went through my usual routine, and stepped outside just as the sunlight started to push through the trees. I did my patrols as scheduled, checked the cameras, filled out the logs, and made sure everything was in order. Still couldn’t locate the sixth camera, but I wasn’t too concerned. The terrain around some parts of the property was a bit rougher—thick brush, uneven ground—it’s possible it was just tucked somewhere out of sight.

By the time I wrapped up the evening patrol and logged it, I was getting used to the rhythm of this place. Two weeks here, two weeks home. Isolated, yeah, but peaceful in its own way. I even started finding comfort in the silence.

The following day was the same, right up until my late afternoon patrol. I was cutting across a path near the edge of the treeline—somewhere between the gate camera and the clearing—when something caught my eye just off the trail. It looked like a chunk of metal, half-buried in the dirt. I figured it might’ve been some junk from the ATV or one of the sheds, so I stepped off the trail to check it out.

It wasn’t junk.

It was a piece of curved metal, about the size of a dinner plate. At first, I thought it was steel. I flipped it over and saw markings—etched lines or characters in a pattern that didn’t make any sense. I filled out a report, and logged it in the incident binder. I left the object where I found it, marked the approximate location on property, and flagged the area with some orange tape from my kit. Just in case.

That night, I watched *The Crow* on DVD and tried to laugh it off. Found weird junk in the woods, big deal. Maybe this used to be a testing site, or someone dumped scrap metal years ago. Not my job to figure that out.

I didn’t sleep well.

The night was quiet. Too still. Too thick. No wind, no bugs, no distant animal sounds. Just silence so complete it pressed against my ears.

I finally drifted off around 2 AM.

The next day, I was more alert. Not paranoid—just...aware. I did a more thorough patrol, even checked the flagged spot again. The object was still there, untouched. No tracks, no signs anyone had come by. The sixth camera still wasn’t turning up either, but I didn’t let it bother me. I stuck to the routine. That’s what you do in this kind of work—stick to the routine.

That night I stayed up later than usual, checking the camera feeds more often. Nothing moved out of place, no more strange knocks. I should’ve felt reassured.

But I didn’t.

That night passed slow. I went to bed around midnight but couldn’t really sleep. I kept thinking about the metal disc I had found.

Sometime after 12 AM, I must’ve drifted off. I remember dreaming about the forest, standing in the middle of it without knowing how I’d gotten there. I was trying to walk, but the trees kept shifting around me.

**At 3:12 AM I woke up.**

There were footsteps outside. Slow ones. Steady. Crunching lightly over the grass. I sat up, heart immediately thudding in my chest, straining to hear if it was animals again. But these weren’t random rustlings or trotting hooves. These were deliberate. Human. Booted.

The footsteps went around the trailer. Once. Then again. Each full circuit took maybe 45 seconds.

I moved to the window, heart pounding, and peeled the blinds just enough to see. Floodlights illuminated the clearing. No one.

I checked every window I could get to. Living room, office, bathroom.
Nothing.
And still—the footsteps continued.
**Circling.**

At that point, I threw on my jacket, grabbed my handgun, and stepped outside. The night was freezing. Still. I stood on the porch listening.
**Silence.**

No movement. No sound.
I did a full perimeter check. I even opened the shed.
**Nothing.**

And then, like it had been waiting for me to give up, the moment I stepped back into the house…

**The footsteps started again.**

I stood motionless just inside the door.
There it was. A full rotation. Around the trailer.
Once.
Twice.
Three times.

And then—they started climbing.

Not stairs. Not a ladder.
Just… the sound of footfalls, heavy and slow, as if someone was calmly walking up the outer wall.

Not scrambling. Not slipping.
Just stepping.

Foot after foot, until the sound reached the roof.

**They began pacing then. Back and forth. From one end of the roof to the other.**

I stared up at the ceiling, unable to move, not sure if I should call dispatch.

This continued for exactly **33 minutes.**
I know because I sat in the in the office and watched the clock.

Back and forth.
Back and forth.

No speaking. No whispering. No banging.
**Just walking.**

It stopped at **3:59 a.m.**

No footsteps down.
No sound of anything leaving the roof.
Just… silence.

And when I finally stepped outside after sunrise, the roof was empty.

No footprints. No scuff marks. No sign that anyone had been outside.

I haven’t told dispatch anything.
What would I even say? That someone walked around the trailer for half an hour and then—what—walked up the wall and just vanished?

They’d either laugh or start writing up a psych eval.

And the worst part is, I don’t even know what I saw. Or heard. I didn’t see anyone. It was just footsteps. Footsteps on a roof that no one can reach. I keep trying to rationalize it. Maybe an animal. Maybe the wind. Maybe the roof is settling.

But then I remember the sound—those calm, steady steps—and my stomach turns. I don’t know if I can do 9 more days out here alone. I will update in a few days.
