One of my best friends told me a story recently. We hadn't seen each other in years. Yet, when I saw him at my brother's wedding, we got on like no time had passed at all. I'll refer to him as Jay.

  
I don't remember much about Jay's friend, or where he said they new each other from. What's important is that he was from out of town. He came to visit for a few days, and shortly after he left, Jay received a phone call. It was his friend. He was hysterical, rambling incoherently. All that Jay could make out was that he had stopped somewhere on the side of the road. Jay took off as soon as the call ended.

  
He found his friend's truck a few miles down the highway with the engine cut. As his own headlights illuminated the tailgate, I'm sure he felt some sense of foreboding. I imagine it clung to him like the chilled air as he approached the driver side door and pulled it open. I would have been shocked myself if I had found the seat vacant. Even more so if I had found Jay in the fetal position on the back seat, just as he had found his friend.

  
He told me he couldn't get much out of him. Through the terrified sobs and hyperventilation all he heard was "The light."

  
Eventually Jay got his friend to calm down. If I remember right, he left the next morning without any further word. I can't say I blame him, I still hate driving the roads out here at night. I don't blame Jay for his restraint in pressing his friend either. Because as he had stepped away from the vehicle he realized where he was. He looked past the roof of that truck and straight into the panes of The White House on the Hill.

  
That was what brought up the subject initially. I told him I was writing these posts as a way to process things, and asked about an experience I had recently remembered. He told me back when we were teenagers that place gave him the creeps, especially after the event in question. I'm not sure why I had never brought it up before. I had remembered the birds, the sense of exposure from the windows and what happened to Pepper. Maybe I simply didn't want to seem like a coward? Maybe I didn't want to resurrect the activity through acknowledgement? Either way, every time I hung out with Jay, I was glad that *I* wasn't the one living there anymore.

  
What I'd asked him about was a night like any other in our teenage years: Jay, my cousin Lee and I were playing around in forge mode on Halo 3 for most of the afternoon and emptying the pantry. We ended up outside after the boredom set in and decided to do some open air "camping". Lee and I figured "why not?" since we were going to be sleeping on the floor anyway.

  
We set up between the thorn bush and fence so that there was no view of the House. It was a full moon that night, and the stars all shone without any fluorescent attrition. My eyes were ringed with exhaustion, yet my mind was awake to the conversations we held. Pointless comparisons of video game characters, preferences in women, friendly jabs and shallow philosophy.

  
Eventually Lee told us he needed to relieve himself and reluctantly crawled from his sleeping bag. After his business was done he crept back to where we were, far more careful and silent than when he had left.

  
"Hey guys," he whispered, crouching, "come check this out real quick."

  
I looked toward the shadow shaped like Jay, imagining our eyes had met. As silently as we could we rose out of our own nylon cocoons, and followed my cousin. W e rounded an oak, stepping heel-toe into the blue from the black shade of the canopy. We were on the threshold of an open area near the road. The House's eyeshine peeked through the trunks at our backs. In unison we had stopped, our attention drawn to where my cousin pointed with a pale finger. We shared wide eyed looks, visages revealed by silver moonlight. 



There was a silhouette on the fence line. A shape like a man's shadow, lifted from the earth and given depth. Yet there were no differing shades to offer definition, only a harsh outline set against the midnight landscape. As it stood in profile I could faintly see the jaw rise and fall. The head seemed upturned - in what I imagined as reverence - to the moon.

  
"Hey!" I challenged with false bravado. "Are you-"

  
I trailed off. The cool, midnight breeze had ended abruptly, disappeared, just as the figure had. My muscles locked me in place as I worked through the confusion. I hadn't turned my head, hadn't batted an eye, and it was gone before I could finish a sentence.

  
Then the footfalls came.

  
The three of us turned and ran. With shocking celerity the rhythm overtook us. Each step had audible weight, and promised I was a heartbeat closer to capture. Just as suddenly though, the silence lifted. We had made it to the door, and the crickets and katydids played their night song. Lee and I had no problem sleeping on the floor.

  
This memory, as with all of the others, tumbled like a glass bead through my mind. Waiting for the thread of recollection to be drawn through its cloud, and to bind those like it together with a knot of scrutiny. This wasn't the last time I would hear that approach. Nor was it the first time I would see that shape.

  
When I was eight everything had happened: Pepper had gone with the birds, I was terrified of windows. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't even close my eyes in the dark. I needed my mother to stay with me on the couch because I was terrified of my room. Yet, as soon as she left for her own, I would wake up.

  
We had an old sectional, angled just right. If I laid near the T.V. it blocked the window I feared with its bulk. However, I faced the empty half of our living room. A blue vacuum of hardwood and drywall. Blue as that night in my teens.

  
My heart was already pounding. My eyes flitting to every shadow. My mind, molding those black pockets into creatures. There was no movement, no sound, just that familiar sensation. Only, now it was on the wrong side of the window.

  
I could feel them, but there were no eyes, and what they reflected was not light. It was hatred. As pure as the innocence I had lost to fear. Here was a shade free from its planar prison, with no origin carved from luminescence or anchor in flesh. Just a man shaped hole in empty space.

  
And as I stared into the abyss of its being, i was encased in the ice of terror. My eyes dried as time sped by, the room lightened, then a golden line of sun crept across the ceiling. The shadow stood undeterred however. Impossibly still, even as illuminated particles danced like pulp and settled down toward it. Then, just before contact, it skittered past the couch on all fours and in perfect silence.

  
I currently sit where it fled. I lay awake at night now with fear. The peace in this place feels like a facade. A cloak concealing an ethereal dagger.
