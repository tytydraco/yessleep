I awoke to the sound of my alarm clock blaring. Rubbing my eyes, I reluctantly dragged myself out of bed. It was the beginning of summer, and I had decided to visit Settler's Peak, a small town in Northern California. The Northwest had the most beautiful scenery. As I gazed out the window of this three-story Tudor home, I could see the green fields teeming with life. I was in town for a few weeks, visiting my buddy Nick for his 21st birthday. Nick and I were the best of friends when we were little, but in the eighth grade, he and his family moved away here, and I hadn’t seen him since.  
  
Truthfully, I was here on an independent journalism project. My fourth semester at Saint Joseph’s University had ended, and I’d thought it’d be a good idea to get some extra curricular writing done over the summer. Settler’s Peak had always possessed an air of mystery, as it had become the subject of dark rumors and unsettling stories. Reddit and 4 Chan had endless threads about a supposed cult known as The Paradise Children, that reportedly operated out of Settler’s Peak.   
  
The Paradise Children were rumored to be a modern day Illuminati. According to the internet, they worship the Abrahamic demon, Aamon, the prince of Wrath, often appearing to people in the form of a wolf. It’s also been said that they’re a small, select group of the wealthy elite. Reddit and 4 Chan forums chattered about the rituals and blood sacrifices they make in order to gain wealth and power. Some people say they eat babies or sacrifice virgins or some other cliché cult bullshit. Some claim that powerful government officials are members of The Paradise Children.   
  
Former President Barack Obama was seen near Settler’s Peak in 2010, which didn’t really help the Anti-Christ allegations that he was facing from far-right conservatives. His PR team claimed that he was stopping by small towns on his way to the UN Summit in Los Angeles, but the conspiracy theorists were not convinced.    
  
With Nick being here, I had a place to stay while I did my research and intrigued by the possibility of being the first person to write a tell-all about the cult, I couldn't resist the temptation to visit Settler’s Peak and unravel the mysteries of the cult myself.  
  
As I walked down the stairs, a voice called out to me.  
  
“You want breakfast?” It was Nick. “I’m making some.”  
  
“It’s your birthday you goober,” I replied. “I should be making you breakfast.”  
  
“Hey, don’t make it a big deal. I hate my birthday anyway.”  
  
Nick made me an egg omelet with four kinds of cheese, peppers, onions, bacon, and chorizo. On the side, two slices of sourdough toast and an assorted fruit bowl.  
  
“Damn dude,” I said, as I savored the delicious flavor of the meal Nick had crafted for me. “You tryna get me to fuck you or something?”  
  
Nick laughed.  
  
“Is it good?” He inquired.  
  
“Yeah. It’s fuckin incredible. Where’d you learn how to cook like this?”  
“I shit you not… TikTok.”  
  
“Get the fuck outta here.”   
  
“Nah man, for real. Whenever I see food videos on my for you page, I bookmark them and practice recreating the recipe.”  
  
“Welp, you’ve mastered this one.” I proclaimed as I placed my napkin on the now cleared plate. “Fuckin’ amazing job, dude.”  
  
“I appreciate that.” Nick started to clear the table. “So, I do have to apologize. I have to head into the restaurant today, unfortunately. Are you good on your own?”  
  
“Yeah man, no worries. It sucks that you have to work on your birthday. But yeah, no I’ll be good. I was actually gonna head into town and do some investigating.”  
  
“Investigating?” Nick asked.  
  
“Yeah. I’m doing some independent journalism over the summer and I’m working on a little project. I’m sure you’ve heard of—”  
  
“The Paradise Children?” Nick stopped me mid-sentence. “Yeah, that’s all I ever hear about from tourists that come here every year on their way to Lake Almanor.”   
  
“So… as a Settler’s Peak resident, what are your thoughts? Do you think they’re real?”  
  
“Dude… no,” Nick said as he laughed at the thought. “I honestly feel like that cult rumor was manufactured by the town to bring in more tourists.”  
  
“That definitely could be the case, but… you never know.” I grabbed my hoodie as I began getting ready to head out into town. “Oh, by the way, where’s your dad? I wanted to tell him thank you for letting me stay here.”  
  
“He’s in Ibiza for some stupid shareholders’ meeting. I don’t know why rich people always go to Ibiza, it’s so corny.”  
  
“Dude… you’re rich people.”  
  
“I know… But none of that money is mine. Me and my dad aren’t really on the best terms. He lets me live here but… None of the money he has, he gives to me.”  
  
“I’m sorry to hear that bro, I’m here if you wanna talk about it.”  
  
“I appreciate it.” Nick said as he patted me on the back.  
  
“Have a good day at work. And oh, yeah. Happy birthday!”  
  
As I wandered through the streets of Settler's Peak, I admired the homey, welcoming vibe of the downtown area. Life’s pace was much slower here compared to life in Philly. I’ve been to similar small towns like this: Phoenicia in New York, Bucks County in Pennsylvania, Tidewater in Oregon… but this place… something about it just felt like home. People happily greeted each other in the street. Cars were few and far in between. All of the shops and restaurants and gas stations and the like were small and locally owned.    
  
A sign above a cozy little coffee shop read “Elsa’s Cafe and Roastery”. Intrigued by the beautiful interior of the shop and my need for caffeine, I walked inside.   
  
“Hi! What can I get for you?” A delicate voice inquired. Behind the front counter, stood the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes on. She was young, probably in her mid twenties, had long, blonde hair, green eyes, and a slender frame. She exuded warmth and positivity and I was captivated by her presence. Her name tag read, “Elsa.”  
  
“Can I get a large, iced blonde americano with an extra shot?”  
  
“Absolutely! Anything else?”  
  
“No, thanks! That’ll be it.”  
  
“Okay… that’ll be two dollars and fifty cents.”  
  
“Really? That’s it?”   
  
“I mean, if you want, I can charge you more. Totally up to you though.” Elsa said jokingly. I chuckled, a smile outstretched across my face.  
  
“It’s just— I’m so used to paying like six dollars every time I get coffee.”  
  
“Oh? Where ya from?”  
  
“Philly.”  
  
A voice behind me called out.  
  
“Hey buddy, do you mind flirting with her AFTER we have our orders taken?” I turned around, not noticing a considerable line had formed behind me.  
  
“Hey Anna, can you take over the register for me? I’m gonna go on my break,” Elsa said as she motioned for the barista with the dyed blue hair. “Come on, let’s sit and talk.”  
  
Elsa brought me over to a table by the corner window of the cafe.  
  
“My name’s Adam by the way.”  
  
“I’m Elsa, very nice to meet you.” Elsa took a sip of her own coffee, her eyes sparkling in the reflection of the sun.   
  
“Elsa, like… Elsa’s Cafe and Roastery? That Elsa?”   
  
“Yup, that’s me!”  
  
“You have a lovely cafe.”  
  
“Thank you, love! So… Philly, huh? What are you doing all the way out here?”  
  
“Oh, well I’m actually a journalism student at Saint Joseph’s University.”  
  
“I see, I see. And you’ve come here to do a piece on the notorious Paradise Children cult.”   
  
“So you know about them?”  
  
“We DO have the internet here. And every summer, when tourists come, that’s all I ever hear about.”  
  
“It gets tiring I imagine.”  
  
“Nah, not really. It’s kind of hilarious to be honest. Plus, it gets business booming in the summer.” I finished my Americano as I locked eyes with Elsa.  
  
“Listen… umm… look you’re really pretty,” I said as I felt my heart race and my cheeks glow red. Elsa smiled. “Are you free, later tonight? I’d love to take you out to dinner.”  
  
“I’d love that, but— I, am taking YOU, out. I do know the place better, of course.”  
  
“Sounds like a plan.” Elsa and I exchanged phone numbers, and I headed out to do some more investigating.   
  
All the locals were super friendly… at least… in comparison to the locals in Philly. I approached anyone and everyone, looking for more information on The Paradise Children. Almost all of the people laughed when I mentioned the cult, most of them writing them off as nothing more than some urban legend. After spending hours trying to gather information on the cult, I was back to where I started — square one.   
  
It was getting late, and I figured I better start getting ready for my date with Elsa. Before I headed home, I made a quick stop at “Settler’s Peak Diner”, the restaurant that Nick cooked at. When I arrived, I was greeted by a waitress, a short, older woman named Diana.  
  
“Can I help you?” Diana asked. Nick and I locked eyes as I peered through the kitchen.  
  
“Uh, yes. Can you tell the line cook with the big ass forehead to come say hi to his friend.” I said in jest. Nick heard my comment, which made him smile.  
  
“Nick, someone’s here to see you!” Diana called out. Nick and I headed out to the back of the restaurant to chat for a bit.  
  
“Happy birthday, buddy.” I said, as I reached into a bag and pulled out a mini-birthday cake for Nick.   
  
“Aww, no way! You didn’t have to do this man.”  
  
“I hope you still like red velvet. I remember that was your favorite cake when we were kids.”  
  
“You remember when we bought a big ass red velvet cake with the money I stole from my dad’s wallet?”   
  
“Yeah, and when we got back to your house, you fuckin’ dropped it on that new polar bear carpet your stepmom bought. Wasn’t that shit like five thousand dollars?”  
  
“Yeah. Yeah it was. She was gonna kill me dude,” We laughed as we reminisced our childhood memories. “Those were much simpler times… Sometimes, I just… I really wish I could get outta here.”  
  
“Oh dude, guess what?”  
  
“What?”  
  
“I have a date tonight.”  
  
“I love that you’re going to get laid on my birthday while I’m here making shitty diner food for old people.”  
  
“I thought you said you hated your birthday anyways.”  
  
“I’m just fuckin’ around man. Who’re you going on a date with?”  
  
“Elsa. The girl that owns the cafe.”  
  
“Very nice, man! Very nice! She’s a sweetheart and she’s absolutely gorgeous.”  
  
“Oh shit, I gotta get ready for that actually. See you at the house later?”  
  
“Where else would I be but here and home?” Nick headed back into the restaurant, as I journeyed back to the West family estate. After showering, and getting changed into clean clothes, I headed back into town to meet with Elsa. I arrived at our designated meeting spot, the courtyard of the Settler’s Peak Downtown Library, to find that Elsa had arrived there first. She was seated at a bench underneath a streetlamp.  
  
“Oh my god, I hope I didn’t keep you waiting.”  
  
“No, not at all!” Elsa said. “I only got here a few minutes ago.”  
  
“Shall we?” For the next few hours, I had the time of my life with the most amazing girl. Elsa showed me around town, pointing out various spots in the town from her childhood that she held dear. She told me stories about when she was a kid, how she got into coffee, how she opened her cafe. Her dreams, her visions, her goals. We had a picnic by a lake, and under the lighting of the moon and the stillness of the night, her deep green eyes looked even more beautiful. As our night came to an end, I walked her back to her car, near the courtyard of the library.  
  
“I had a really fun time with you tonight,” Elsa stated. “If you have time before you leave for home, we should definitely hang out again.”  
  
“I’d like that.” Our eyes met. We inched closer to each other. My heart raced. I think… I think she’s going to kiss me.  
  
Her car window shattered. A masked man in all black stood menacingly next to her car. He stood firm, making eye contact with me.   
  
“Hey!” I called out angrily. “Get the fuck away from her car!”   
  
Suddenly, a black, unmarked van pulled up right next to us. Three more masked men, wearing all black, exited the vehicle. I tried to create distance between the two of us, and the four of them, as I motioned for Elsa to get behind me.  
  
“If someone’s getting kidnapped tonight, it’s not going to be you,” I whispered to Elsa. “I want you to run.”  
  
“I am not leaving you.”  
  
“Elsa, I really like you, but you just met me today. Please, do the smart thing and run. I’m going to distract them long enough for you to get away. Go to the police station, immediately.”   
  
“Good point.” The men closed in, and I threw a jab at the man closest to my left, breaking his nose. Elsa made a break for her car and drove off, as I tried to fight off our attackers. I landed blows on some of the men as they tried to restrain me, but eventually, I grew tired, and they were able to subdue me to the ground. They put a black bag over my head and threw me into their van. The last sound I heard before going unconscious was the screeching of rubber as it collided against the pavement.   
  
I don’t remember much in between. Not the specifics. I was in and out. But I do… I do remember… the pain.  
  
I faded in and out of consciousness, but I remembered seeing men in black robes… their faces covered by a wolf mask, a singular tear etched underneath where the wolf’s left eye was. A wolf mask… a wolf…   
  
The Paradise Children.   
  
At the start of this trip, I set out to find The Paradise Children… but… they found me.  
  
I still couldn’t tell where I was… I was in… some sort of cave? Or a dungeon? I don’t know what it was… but… we were underground, I think.  
  
“Worry about the girl later,” A deep, distorted voice bellowed. “If I don’t do this now, I’m going to be stuck in this shit hole for the rest of my life.”  
  
I blacked out again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I awoke.   
  
It was night time still, and I was tied to a tree, overlooking… yes, this was Lake Almanor. The moon shined bright, illuminating the lake and forest below it. The gentle breeze that flowed through my hair was oddly calming, given the circumstances.  
  
“Hey,” A voice next to me said. It was… it was Nick. “It’s beautiful isn’t it?” He stared out into the abyss, admiring the beauty of the nature around us.  
  
“N— Nick?” I said, still in a daze.  
  
“You know… it really does pain me to do this.”  
  
“Why? Why me?” I pleaded.  
  
“Because you were the perfect opportunity,” Nick explained. “The sacrifice Aamon requires must take place on a man’s 21st birthday, when the moon is clear and visible, before the clock strikes midnight. I’m sorry bud, but… this was destiny.”  
  
“What… what the fuck Nick? I’m your best friend.”  
  
“Was. Was my best friend, Adam. Let’s face it. You didn’t even really come here for my birthday. You came here to write a story about The Paradise Children.” Nick chuckled. “It’s ironic… Now, you have insiders’ insight… too bad you won’t be able to write about it.”   
  
“You’re — you’re sacrificing me for— for what?”  
  
“Money. Fame. Success. Maybe all three? I don’t wanna work at some backwoods diner in the middle of nowhere forever, Adam.”   
  
The breeze flowed through my hair again, as a chilling silence cascaded across the valley.  
  
“Goodbye. Old friend.”   
  
I felt a sharp pain as an elongated blade swiftly pierced through my heart. I could feel my heart beating slower… and slower… and slower… as I started to lose blood… as I… started to fade away… I looked over at Nick, the moonlight glistening on his tears. His lip quivering with regret.   
  
In the end, I guess… I guess I got what I wanted. The secrets of the Paradise Children… I did end up uncovering.   
  
Maybe some secrets… are better off left [secrets.](https://youtu.be/3fPLcL6LRiE)
