Last night i had a very vivid, very **disturbing dream**. i need someone to say this too so here we go;  
(some context. my parents are divorced. not on good terms at all. both hate eachother. my grandfather owns a 12-guage. and i am into airsoft.)  

i remember my brother finding out some way to figure out my search history, specifically what "porn" type i was looking at. he found this on the back of a box located at dollar tree, titled something like "Ball Park" it was a hamburger on the front of the bag. upon purchasing the bag you would for whatever reason get access to a database in which you can look up things about people. not sure why.  

i wanted to get him back, and expose him. brotherly love i suppose. so my mother agreed to help me with this. we told my brother we would go to a store and buy airsoft guns. i went too.  
my mother bought both of us airsoft guns and we put them together in the shop, not sure why.. they had some sort of creepy back room for people to put them together.  

we both went in seperate rooms, there being two, i took one and my brother and mom took the other.  
i vividly remember eating cookies that were in a jar above a cabinet mounted to the wall.  
few mins later we finished the gun, some paintball kid walked in and asked to see it, being younger than me. after that breif interaction we decided to all leave the store.  
and for whatever reason, DIDNT get the snack from dollar tree. im not sure how it happened but i ended up at my grandmothers house. 

we were all talking about john wick and telling stories. I look out a window and see 3 armed men in full black approaching the house. i tell everyone, them being skeptical for a second, before me yelling at them.  
my grandpa immediatly went to his room and grabbed his shotgun. a 12-guage. i followed with him, having the same idea.  

im not sure where my grandma went. my grandpa went outside the door, in which the intruders were. outside it was pitch black.  

everyone in the room of my grandmas house was gone. i remember hearing gunshots from a rifle and a single shot from a shotgun. i then went down to the door leading outside. immediately as i walked out it switched from the outdoors of my grandmas house to my dads house. it was day now.  

i go over to the garage, in which a stove was placed down conviently with my dead grandpa lying over it, blood spilling from a gunshot wound to his skull. his shotgun lie dormant right next to him on the floor. blood was spilling out of him, i walk over to my childhood playplace, my mother was hanging, decapitated from a rope as she was swinging in the wind. im not sure where my brother was.  

my grandmothers disfigured body lie on the concrete. face down. with one bullet wound to her head and 7 stab wounds to her chest. i see my dad inside after going in and tell him everyone is dead. he denies it, laughing it off before going outside to see the dead bodies of my family members. 

thats when i woke up.  

I have been dealing with trauma relating to emotional abuse from my father recently. anyone have any idea what this may mean? I remember a deep feeling of loss and horror. **i am not a psychopath. this has disturbed me all day.**
