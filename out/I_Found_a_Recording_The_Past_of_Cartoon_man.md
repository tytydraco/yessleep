I don’t even know if anyone will believe this, but I have to get it out before it drives me insane.

My friend Jack went missing a few weeks ago. No warning. No note. Just… gone. The police found nothing. His room was untouched, except for the TV. It was still on, looping some weird cartoon I’d never seen before *The Adventures with Cartoon Man*.

A few days after Jack disappeared, I was helping clean out an old storage unit he used to hang around. Behind boxes of junk and broken VHS tapes, I found a small metal case. One word was scratched into it:

“For the Curious.”

Inside was a reel labeled *Mr. H*.

I shouldn’t have played it. But I did.

The voice on the tape was calm. Too calm. Like someone explaining how to fix a clock instead of confessing something horrible. He said his name was Mr. H, and that he had created Cartoon Man.

At first, I thought it was just some unhinged artist talking nonsense.

Then he said this:

“Cartoon Man wasn’t alive at first. He was just a character. Rubber limbs. White gloves. A wide smile. I designed him to be eternal. But audiences moved on. Ratings dropped. Cartoon Man was forgotten. That was the problem. He looked alive, but there was nothing inside him. So I decided to fix him. I needed a soul.”

My stomach tightened.

“There was a boy. An orphan. He loved the show when no one else did. He believed. I took him. I didn’t kill him. Death would ruin the process. I kept him alive beneath the studio, in a cage. Light was rare. Food was irregular. I taught him obedience. I forced him to smile. Tubes, mirrors, restraints… I corrected him until he couldn’t resist. Eventually, he smiled naturally. That was ‘pre-animation.’ That was the soul I needed.”

I froze. My hands shook.

“I fed his essence into the animation. Every episode. Every bounce. Every joke. The door. The banging. The choices. None of it was fictional. It was instruction. But cartoons end when the projector stops. I wanted him to exist beyond the frames. So I performed a ritual. Something beyond the natural. And the boy’s soul merged with the character.”

I had to pause the tape. I thought I might throw up.

“But the soul was angry. He remembered the cage. He remembered the neglect. He remembered being forgotten. His smile is forced. But underneath, rage simmers. Every bounce, every motion, every question he asks… he’s remembering what it felt like to die alone. He’s the boy the world abandoned. And now… he cannot be ignored.”

The tape ended with a warning:

“If you find the show: do not turn it off. Do not lie. Do not forget him. Because forgetting him is what killed him.”

The tape clicked off. Silence. I wished that was the end.

I promise you this is true—every single night since I listened to that recording, I hear it.

Whispering.

*“Jack… Jack…”*

Then a door starts banging. Hard. Over and over. And beneath it… screaming. Not cartoon screaming. Real screaming. Like someone trapped and begging to be let out.

I don’t even live near Jack’s house.

I burned the tape. I destroyed the reel. But it doesn’t matter.

Because last night, right before the banging stopped, I heard something else.

A cheerful voice, warped and broken, like it was coming through static and old film at the same time, saying:

**D̷o̷n̷’̷t̷ f̷o̷r̷g̷e̷t̷ h̷i̷m̷,̷ M̷i̷k̷e̷**

I don’t know how much longer I can stay here. I don’t know if anyone will believe this. But he’s watching.

He remembers.

And he doesn’t forgive.
