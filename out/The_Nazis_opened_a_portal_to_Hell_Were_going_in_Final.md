“How the fuck do we get out of here now?” Pitt asked, still gasping for air as we all looked at each other. Vera just shook her head, looking to me as Marcus checked his bag, looking at the guns and explosives inside to prepare. I looked in my tac bag as well, pulling out a small paper that had a crude map Selene had drawn when she first arrived at the Collective.

“Looks like we’re almost to the living quarters now. We’ll look there for any communication equipment so we can send a message back home. Until we get rid of that thing though, there’s not going to be a way for help to come get us.” I said, looking to each of them in turn. Pitt was gritting his teeth as Marcus inspected guns, holding up an AR and loading in a mag that he had a piece of tape on marked ‘Holy Shit’. I looked to Vera with my next question, “We close the portal, does that get rid of the one up there?”

“Theoretically, yes.” She replied, hesitating for a moment, “But we should realistically prepare for every ounce of shit possible to hit the fan. The only information we have on Hellgate infestations is so outdated that we can’t be sure what the hell will happen. Hell, the last time one was opened they ended up just carpeting the entire area with blessed bombs and hoping for the best. That was almost… seventy years ago, I think. They didn’t even wait for the portal to close before the bombs started to fall.”

“Great, so this is even more of a suicide mission than what we signed up for. Fan-fucking-tastic.” Marcus said, handing around more guns with crosses marked on the barrels. “Considering half our ammo is in that flaming pile outside, y’all better make every damned shot count.” 

He handed one to Selene, a small pistol with one of the specially marked mags, before hesitating a moment and looking at me. I just nodded. From what she had told us on the plane, she was trustworthy, but first… I had to ask, “Did you know that thing would be up there?”

“No,” She shook her head. “When I left everything was contained to the fourth and fifth sub-levels. It’s advanced quickly.”

She pointed to the staircase ahead of us, descending into a dimly lit tunnel. A few feet in the dark concrete of the bunker began to look different. It began to bulge, like tumors were growing from the solid wall and becoming flesh. I could see veins creeping through it, something pumping and causing the walls themselves to pulsate with red and black fluid just under the gnarled surface. 

“Corruption…” Vera whispered, walking a little closer to get a good look. I followed, trying to stop her from getting too close before realizing it was no use, she was too inquisitive about what we were seeing. Leave it to the occultist to find a hallway of cancerous flesh and be fascinated instead of disgusted. She raised a hand to it before stopping herself. 

“You guys ever seen a lash egg?” Pitt remarked, looking almost sick as he gazed at the strange substance all over the walls. “Grew up on a farm, went to crack an egg from the coops for breakfast one morning and… well, it came out looking like that. God, I can still smell how awful it was.”

We shook it off, gathering our wits and making our next move down the hallway. Everyone was careful not to touch the walls, fearing that it may send some kind of alert to whatever denizens were lurking below. God knows the last thing we need is them to know we’re already in here, assuming they weren’t already alerted by the crash above. Actually…

“Did nobody hear the crash? Where the hell is everyone?” I asked, looking back at Selene as she simply shrugged.

“There weren’t many of us left after the portal opened. Not many normal people, anyways. A lot of us were relegated to the upper levels while the workers stayed below. Some said that the gate began to affect them, their minds becoming more corrupted as their exposure to Hell grew. I don’t know, I tried to avoid going anywhere near the gate after… after they took her.” She answered.

“Hard to imagine you can corrupt Nazis beyond their default…” Marcus said under his breath, getting a laugh out of Pitt. I shushed him as Selene grunted, moving further down the hallway.

The smell hit me like a ten ton truck full of rotten eggs. The worst stench of sulfur I’ve ever gotten in a full frontal blast, with an added undertone of rotting flesh to really just top off the awful scent sundae that was coming from the other end of the hall. Dull lights hung from the ceiling, leaving us unsure of what may be waiting for us. I pulled up a cloth mask around my neck, desperately hoping it would stop the smell from permeating my nose, making my eyes water as it overwhelmed every sense. Pitt started retching nearby, leaning over near the wall and puking his guts out as the others bravely tried to soldier on. 

“Jesus, that’s awful.” Vera said, covering her nose with her hand while keeping the other on her gun, pointed forward. 

“Only going to get worse,” I muttered. We continued to walk in silence, trying our best to overcome the intense smell and stay alert as shadows played on the flesh-filled walls. I swear they were moving. Pulsating like there was a pulse running through them. All I could feel was disgust. Two decades in the Collective and this was by far one of the grossest things I’ve seen throughout my career, which was… well, the bar was really fucking high.

“Just keep moving and keep your eyes open.” Selene said, now beginning to really come out of her shell. She had the gun at the ready, pointed forward like she was going to shoot the first damn thing she saw in here. Couldn’t really blame her after everything she told us, but I had my worries that she might go a little too trigger happy.

There was movement ahead, not from the living walls but something moving through them. We heard heavy footsteps tapping along the concrete floor when suddenly a person turned the corner ahead, coming right into our line of sight. At least, he was human at one time, I think. His face was bloody, with both eyes missing from pits of gore where they should have been. Despite the missing vision, it seemed to see us, stopping as it turned the corner and sizing us up for a moment before opening its mouth to let out an inhuman screech that was subsequently cut short by a bullet fired from Selene’s gun. It entered clean through one of the empty eye-holes, a spray of blood signaling the exit wound from the back as it splattered the wall behind him, blending in to the exposed flesh beyond. 

“So much for the stealth option.” Marcus muttered, following it up with a creative string of curses I’ll likely never hear again in my lifetime. We all decided to rush forward at the same time as the clattering of footsteps began to make their way from down the hall, rushing towards the source before they could overwhelm us. 

Turning the corner was a momentary mindfuck. Instead of another hallway or stairs as we expected it was a massive cavern, a clanging metal pathway leading precariously through a dark pit that looked to be filled with fire somewhere hundreds of feet below. The same flesh colored walls lined everything, but there was no telling where the end was way down under us. The path was… well, to say I didn’t trust it was an understatement. It was creaky from our first step, and looked like the slightest bit of weight would cause it to fall wildly into the pits of flame below. 

Any worried I had about the integrity of the walk were immediately thrown out of the window as I saw no less than four people coming across from a crevice in the other side of the cavern. They were rushing along the walkway towards us, eyes missing from their skulls just like the one back there, sharp teeth bared and covered in blood as each let out a loud, discordant scream to alert the others. We began to fire off shots, hitting the lead right in the head and causing him to tumble back into the others, knocking one of them over the railing. His body ragdolled down into the pit below, and I swear it looks like the flames came up to meet him. 

“Run through!” I shouted to the others, taking point and charging ahead. It only took moments to make contact with one, but rather than waste ammo, I crouched down, pushing up with my shoulder to throw him over the railing and into the fire. The second one grabbed onto me, trying to push me over the rails after his comrades. It was stupidly strong, more than any human should be, and I could feel its hands beginning to crush my neck as it wrapped them around, my feet starting to lose contact with the walkway underneath as it pulled me up. The worst part though was its breath, hot with the smell of rotting flesh right in my face. I could see from this close that the empty eyes were well on their way to rotting, maggots crawling around inside and feasting on the necrotic flesh within. Just as I felt myself starting to lean over the railing, a knife went through the head from Marcus and Pitt began puling me back onto the walkway. We quickly pushed the now-piled bodies through the bottom rails into the fire, and kept moving towards the crevice. 

When we finally hit the other side everyone almost collapsed, Pitt practically kissing the ground below as more creaks reminded us of how close we were to being up in flames behind us. 

“What the fuck was that? I thought this place was a bunker?” Pitt was gasping from the ground nearby. 

“Hellgates don’t just let demons through, they change the geography of everything as they spread.” Vera said. She shook her head, letting out a deep sigh, “Expect much worse the further in we get. We’re basically in hell already.”

“Fantastic…” Marcus grunted, holstering his knife and pulling a light machine gun from his tac bag, loading another magazine marked as Holy into it. “Glad I brought more fucking firepower then.”

“We’re gonna need it,” I said, nodding to him, “Thanks for the assist back there.”

“I’ll bill you when we get out of here.” He grunted back. 

“We’re all billing Ronald double after this bullshit.” Vera snorted. 

“A-fuckin’-men to that, sister.” Pitt said, standing once more and moving forward.

“Alright, onwards and downwards, folks.” I began to lead the way, heading down the sloping path through the crevice. The walls of flesh all around us were pulsating more strongly now, like they were getting more energy the closer we were to the center. Lights began to dim as we went though, so we had to eventually turn our own flashlights on which made the place even more eerie.

“So why can’t you just close the gate from here if the corruption has made it this far?” Pitt asked Vera as we kept moving.

“You think dealing with demons is that easy?” She scoffed, holding her gun steady in front of her, dust floating through the beam of her flashlight. “You can only close a door at the same point it’s opened from. Otherwise you risk blowing the entire thing even wider and damning even more people. You want to try that?”

“You could have just said it wouldn’t work and I would’ve believed you, y’know.” He mumbled back, taking it a little personally. The tunnel was only getting darker, walls of flesh fading from a deep crimson to black now, but still pulsating as we went on. A loud roar echoed through the tunnel, causing all of us to stop in our tracks. 

“The fuck is it this time?” Marcus asked, holding his gun steady, finger on the trigger.

“Probably not friendly.” Pitt mumbled angrily under his breath. We waited for a moment, prepared to see some kind of terror, but were relieved when nothing came into view. Another low rumble echoed through the tunnel, bouncing off the fleshy walls, but we still didn’t see anything. 

“Keep moving.” I said, trying to keep my voice low so as not to alert anything that might be listening up ahead. We moved on, steady, silent, straining to hear any noise that may alert us to new dangers in this hellscape. 

Another roar erupted through the tunnel, but this time from behind us. We all turned, unsure of how anything could get there, but sure as the hell we were standing in, a massive beast was charging at us from the direction we had come from. It was huge, reptilian scales jutting from its skin as it came screaming down the hallway on all four limbs, massive horns tilted down and ready to gore anyone that it was able to catch. We all began to run, throwing caution to the wind regarding anything that may be ahead, only wishing to not get caught by this thing, now gnashing teeth as it gained ground on us rapidly. 

Light from up ahead told us we were almost out, though whether that was a good thing was yet to be seen. Upon exiting the tunnel, we realized it was a frying pan and fire situation, and the fire was fucking everywhere. There wasn’t even a cavern anymore. We had seemingly stepped through the front door right into Hell itself, with an open sky before us, flames spouting from the ground all around, and rocky formations all over the place. Everyone dove to the side, getting away from the tunnel entrance as the demon burst through, letting out a loud roar as it skidded to a halt on the rock, bellowing to the sky above and alerting every goddamn thing in earshot that we had arrived. All five of us got to our feet, aiming guns at it and preparing to fire.

It’s blazing eyes looked to each of us in turn, almost daring us to shoot at it, Pitt was the first to open fire, a bullet glancing off one of the massive horns as it opened its mouth wide and pounced, jumping right on him. I heard him scream as sharp fangs tore into his shoulder, biting deep before rearing its head back, splashing blood all over and reveling as it soaked its chin. Pitt screamed again, raising his gun through the pain and emptying a full clip into the demon from point blank. This only served to make it mad though, and it lowered open jaws once more, chomping down on Pitt’s head and tearing it off in one clean bite, a massive spray of blood going everywhere.

“NO!” Marcus screamed, pulling the trigger on his gun as the rest of us did the same, aiming for whatever open flesh we could on the creature. Shots only pinged off the scales with no use as the demon looked at us, Pitt’s head staring vacantly from between its massive teeth, a scream of horror ringing silently from his mouth. 

“Sitzen!” A voice came from the distance, booming across the hellscape. The demon obeyed almost immediately, like a damned dog hearing its master. It kept Pitt’s head in its jaws for a moment before the voice came again, “Guter Junge. Speisen.”

With the last command it crunched down, popping Pitt’s eyes from his disembodied head and causing more blood to gush from its lips. It swallowed, a look of satisfaction on its face. From the flames nearby a man emerged, dressed in an old Nazi officer’s uniform, hair cut neatly and slicked back with small glasses near the tip of his nose. He smiled at us as he stepped out onto the rocks nearby, motioning for the demon to go away. It began to slink back into the tunnel, a low grumble emanating from its throat as it licked its lips, staring us all down one by one while it passed.

“Selene, you did not alert me that you were back, miene liebe. I see your mission was successful?” He said, looking directly at her. She only looked at him, stone faced as she walked over.

“I told them we couldn’t trust a fuckin’ Nazi…” Marcus spat in their direction. The officer simply smiled, looking at Selene as she now stood by him. 

“Where is my daughter?” She asked.

“Safe with her father, of course. Though, she’s become quite accustomed to her new lifestyle…” He said, gesturing off into the distance. “He’s been waiting for you.”

“Selene,” I said, keeping my voice steady, “You’re going to die along with everyone else in here, you understand that?”

“I welcome it.” She said in return, stone faced.

“Americans. Always so self-assured…” The man smiled, chuckling to himself, “Now, let us not keep the Fuhrer waiting any longer. He’s very hungry.” 

He turned, walking to the edge of the rocky cliff we were standing on and looking to the fires below. With a wave of his hand, stone began shifting, rising on air to meet him and form a pathway to walk on. I noticed faint blue light forming around his hand, swirling to connect with the levitating rocks as he controlled them with some form of magic. Selene followed, turning from us with one last glare.

“Come, now.” He shouted at us. How he just expected us to follow him was… very cocky. Especially considering we still had weapons in hand and weren’t going to go without a fight. I fired off a shot, hitting him right in the shoulder from behind. He didn’t even move, simply turning back to face us with a sigh, “Fine, we will do this the hard way. Guards!” 

Four massive, winged demons suddenly flew up from below the cliff side, wings beating hot air towards us as they descended to our level. Marcus fired off two shots, but they bounced off the scales with next to no problem. One of Vera’s ended up hitting one right through the leathery membrane of its wing, punching a small hole in it that caused the demon to howl in anger. It started to swipe before the officer gave it a new command, causing it to simply pick her up and squeeze her in one of its massive hands. The others followed suit, one grabbing Marcus before another reached for me. I tried firing at its head, but my first shot missed, the second barely grazing one of the horns before I felt massive, scaled claws wrapping around my body. Immediately, it squeezed, and I felt my breath rush from me as I fought for air. 

“Onward,” Officer said, moving along the levitating rock path once more. The demons holding us took off, massive wings beating hot air into our faces that made it hard to breathe. As we passed over the rocky cliff, I could see what lay below, and it made me dread what our fate may be even if we made it out of here alive.

Miles and miles of pits full of fire and bodies, not dead, but writhing in agony. From my birds-eye view I could see that they were still alive, in whatever sense of that word that could mean down here, at least. They were crawling over each other, some screaming in pain, others rocking in the fetal position. Every single one looked burnt, singed beyond recognition as more demons down below wandered amongst them, torturing at their leisure. Big ones with wings like the ones holding us, massive four legged beasts like the one that killed Pitt, and even more that were just imps, small little things that looked like damned toddlers wandering among the burning bodies, poking at some with long staffs and giggling as they screamed in pain. I saw a couple of them gathered around one body, flaying off burnt flesh from the sinew underneath, the person it belonged to staring up at the clouded sky with vacant eyes, mouth open in a perpetual scream begging for its afterlife to end, begging for relief, as they simply peeled more skin away. Even as it came off, I could see new skin growing over it that they just targeted again, laughing madly while they brought as much pain as possible to the tortured souls below.

Worse than the images below me was the smell, a mix of burning, rotting flesh and the worst stench of sulfur I had ever had the misfortune of inhaling. I felt like I was going to choke even as the demon was squeezing the damned life out of me, hard claws pressed into my rib cage, jostling me with every beat of its wings. After a few minutes, or hell, it could have been hours, I think I lost consciousness once or twice from the restricted airflow, we touched down on another rocky formation, the Officer and Selene standing at the ready before a massive, stone throne situated in the middle.

The demons let us down, all three of us gasping for air as we fell to the stone ground beneath. As we looked up, we could see a body sitting on the throne nearby, though most of its head was… missing. The right side of the face was relatively fine, but the left side was blown out, like a gunshot had gone right through it and taken out a lot of that side of the skull on top, complete with a missing left eye and brain matter falling out of the gaping hole. As we watched the body stood, moving closer to us as it inspected.

“Gifts for you, Mein Fuhrer.” The officer bowed, stepping back and sweeping a hand towards us in presentation. It hit me then that this was him. Hitler, the goddamn architect of one of the worst atrocities in human history, standing before us in the pits of hell. 

His right eye shone with fire as he looked us over, inspecting each of us one by one as the demons pulled us to our feet. When he got to Vera he put a hand on her face, caressing her cheek gently before moving on, poking Marcus in the belly as he looked at him. 

“We needed four for the King.” He muttered, looking to the officer. 

“Yes, Mein Fuhrer. Unfortunately one of them was killed during the descent from the surface. However, we do have her.” He pointed to Selene now, who suddenly turned from stone faced to anger.

“No! You promised me, SWORE TO ME, that if I brought the last sacrifices my daughter and I could go free!” She began to shout, raising a hand to slap Hitler before a great roar sprang up from the fiery pits below. Hitler began to laugh.

“Oh, I swore to you?” He grinned, sinew exposed in the left side of his face, fragments of bone and teeth meshed into the skin. “I have sworn to only one since I have been here.”

The ground beneath us trembled, shaking as something moved. It only took moments to see it as it lumbered into view from the distance. A demon, larger than the others and towering high above the rocks we were standing on, stepped forward in the distance. It only took minutes for its great strides to reach us, eyes burning with millions of smaller flames and a great maw that could swallow entire buildings whole if it so wished. The scales on it were massive, creator than anything I had ever seen. The sheer size of it almost made me want to shut my brain off for fear of what it could mean.

“Behold, the Great Defiler! The Lord of Flies! He who will bring about our Fourth Reich on Earth!” Hitler screamed, bowing before the massive demon. As he did, it began to speak.

“Have you honored your part of this bargain?” God, it felt like the voice was inside my head even though it was shaking the entire ground around me. I looked down, trying to get my balance as dizziness began to set in, noticing lines drawn on the ground in a massive circle before the stone throne. 

“The remaining sacrifices are here, my lord.” Hitler said, still in a deep bow, daring not to look at the hulking demon before him. The Great Beast began to shrink down as he spoke, and my eyes barely believed it as he eventually stepped down onto the stone ground alongside us, an incredibly handsome man with flowing blonde hair, almost glowing with radiant light as he stood before the feeble former ruler of the Third Reich. Hitler spoke again, “Have you already partaken of the virgin I gave you, lord?”

“She was… adequate.” Satan answered, looking us all over now before turning his eyes to Selene. “This is her mother?”

“Indeed, my lord. This whore is the last of the sacrifices.” He replied. 

“You son of a bitch!” Selene shouted, raising the gun that was still holstered at her side and firing off a shot at Satan. The bullet glanced off his skin like it was made of fucking titanium, with barely a reaction from him. He moved towards her, total calm on his face as he looked her from top to bottom.

Vera nudged me then, nodding to the ground we were standing on. I realized there were marks etched in the stone, formed into a massive circle of runes. The focal point of the Hellgate.

“We need blood to activate it,” She mouthed, taking care that none of the Nazis were looking. Satan was busy staring Selene down, now caressing a hand from her cheek down to her chest, staring at her with hunger.

“Your child was delightful, will you live up to that same feeling?” He asked, putting his mouth to her neck and taking a bite, drawing a slight bit of blood before leaning back and licking his lips, savoring it. 

I had half a hope that some of the blood would drop to the ground and let us activate the circle, but I knew it would take more than that. I slowly slid a knife from my belt, trying to be discreet about it, but the officer saw me, shouting to the demons around us.

“Nein! Stop them, take their weapons and hold them down until the Great Lord is ready!” Officer shouted, motioning for the demons still standing off to the side to take hold of us. Suddenly I was shoved to the ground from behind, the massive, scaly claws pushing us down into the rocky surface hard, almost squeezing the air from my lungs once more. 

“Now, what is it you desire from me in return for these sacrifices?” Satan asked Hitler.

“I desire the earth, my lord. To reign for a millenia as the Fourth Reich!” He said, kneeling in front of him and bowing his head. “I will prepare the world for your coming reign, soak the oceans with the blood of those who are impure, create great cities in your honor for the demons to rule! I will do whatever you ask of me, all I ask is for a sliver of power to do it with!”

“Hmph. So be it.” Satan answered, waving him off without a care. Selene just stood there, looking to the ground, eyes welling with tears.

“Where is my daughter?” She asked.

“Are you not listening? Your daughter is dead. I used her for my own pleasure then devoured her.” Satan said, barely glancing back at her as he walked off. Selene only let out a choked sob, collapsing to the ground on her knees. Pressed to the floor, Vera and I were facing each other. I noticed her whispering something under her breath, but it took a minute to figure out what.

Latin. She was chanting the rites to close the Hellgate that was right beneath our feet, hoping that blood would spill on the circle from anywhere and complete the ritual. She just stared at me as she chanted, nodding briefly for me to do whatever I needed to in order to finish out our job. I nodded back, mind racing as I tried to figure out the best way to spill any kind of blood I could on the circle before the idea hit me.

Deep breath in, can’t hesitate now, Harker. Open wide, stick your tongue out, and bite down hard, you’ve been through worse pain. It’s much harder than I expected it to be, but after a couple of hard bites and working through the pain, I managed to get through it. For good measure I sucked in my cheek and bit it too, getting a good amount of blood flowing that I then spat out onto the ground nearby. Vera kept chanting, a faint glow beginning to emanate from the circle as she grew louder. The Officer noticed first, shouting for someone to stop her, but it was too late.

Satan only looked at us as Hitler began to screech curses left and right, looking around for a weapon to try and kill Vera with. He stomped over, desperately attempting to curb stomp her but was too late. As the Hellgate began to close, reality began to warp around us, driving the demons away while they screamed into the air, hot air beating from their wings. I stood, punching him in the injured side of his face and feeling his jawbone scrape my knuckles as Vera continued her ritual, the circle glowing ever brighter. Marcus stood, reaching for the pistol on the ground nearby that had been dropped, and fired off a shot at the Officer to keep him at bay. Satan smiled, looking me in the eyes as blood dripped from my mouth. Goddamn, it hurt, but I’ve got to say it’s not the worst thing that could have happened during all of this.

“You simply delay the inevitable. My reign will soon come, with or without these… stooges.” He said, looking at Hitler now.

“No! Kill them, my liege! I have honored our bargain, why would you let them get away?” Hitler screamed, rushing at Satan now. The Dark Lord raised a hand, flicking his wrist and sending the Fuhrer flying off into the fiery pits below. “I will see you soon, I’m sure of it.”

Reality crumbled around us, the fiery pits fading into nothingness as the rocky ground phased in and out before finally being replaced by solid concrete. Halogen bulbs flickered above suddenly, cold air replacing the hot, sulfur-fumed atmosphere around us as we were suddenly in the depths of the bunker. 

Selene and the Officer were in the room with us. She was collapsed, sobbing in grief as the Officer stared forward, Marcus holding a gun to his head. He put his hands up, trying to motion in surrender.

“Still got those explosives?” I ask Marcus, though it comes out garbled thanks to how mangled my mouth is now. He nodded, tilting his head towards the tac bag still on the ground nearby. I opened it, grabbing out a few blocks of C4, setting them up strategically around the room as the Officer began to cry, begging for his life. When the last one was set, I grabbed the detonator, arming it with a loud beep.

“Please, I can be of use. Spare me, bring me to your commanders, I will tell them all I know!” Officer was pleading, blubbering with fear while we went about our work. Vera and Marcus walked to the doorway, peering up the stairs to ensure there was nothing there. Selene just sat on the ground, staring at the Officer with hatred in her eyes. I threw her a knife.

“We’re not letting you out of here alive, but I don’t care what you do after we’re gone.” I said.

The Officer jumped at the knife on the ground, but didn’t make it before Marcus fired off a shot, hitting him in the kneecap. One more round went off, hitting him in the opposite knee for good measure.

“That’s for Pitt.” He spat on the Officer before walking out of the room. Selene only looked at me before gently picking the knife off the ground, holding it up to see the edge shine in the light. Vera and I walked out, closing the door behind us as the Officer began to scream.

We made the walk back to the surface, reaching the cold, frozen wasteland and to our surprise, the now extinguished wreckage of our plane. We huddled inside it for shelter from the elements before pressing the button on the detonator, a loud explosions shaking the ground beneath us as the small building, the only sign that there was anything below the surface here, began to smoke and catch fire.

Hours passed sitting in the wreckage before a plane flew over, Vera and Marcus went outside, waving them down and firing off flares to get their attention, as if they were needed with the smoking pile of debris still burning deep under the ground. After it landed, a pilot and a couple of agents greeted us, running forward and bringing us onto the plane, explaining that they had a tracker on it in case of an emergency like this. 

We’re heading back to the Collective for debrief now, though I can’t say I’m eager to do much talking. I’m definitely putting in for vacation time after this. Maybe I’ll see if Vera wants to join me. I would say we’ve earned it, at the very [least](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/o6cnNlvvc4).
