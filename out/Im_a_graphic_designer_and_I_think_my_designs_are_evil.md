I'm writing this because I don't know what else to do. I need someone to hear this, to maybe believe me. 

For the past eight years, I poured my soul into graphic design. Logos, brochures, website layouts – you name it. It was usually a demanding but rewarding job. Or, at least, it had been. Lately, my work felt… off. Not just creatively stale, but genuinely wrong.

It started subtly, a few months back, with a corporate rebranding project for a new tech startup. The client wanted something sleek, futuristic, with sharp angles and cool blues. I sketched out a few concepts, landed on one I liked, and started building it in Illustrator. I spent hours on the logo, perfecting every curve and gradient. But when I presented it to the client, they looked at me strangely.

"It's… almost perfect," the lead guy, Mark, said, frowning at the screen, "But what's that little bit sticking out there, on the top right? It wasn't in the sketch."

I leaned closer. He was right. A tiny, almost imperceptible sliver of a line, a single pixel, was protruding from one of the 'A's in the logo. It ruined the clean aesthetic. I hadn't put it there. I was meticulous. I deleted it, apologized, and we moved on. Just a momentary glitch, probably a mouse slip, I told myself.

Then came the brochure layout for a local cafe. I spent days on it, making sure the vintage coffee cup illustrations were perfectly aligned, the text flowing beautifully. I exported the PDF, sent it off. An hour later, an urgent call from the cafe owner.

"What happened to the coffee cup?" she sounded frantic. "It looks like it's… weeping."

I opened my file. The small, charming illustration of a steaming coffee cup now had a faint, dark smudge trailing down from its rim, like a tear. And the steam rising from it looked less like steam and more like faint, wispy fingers curling upwards. I hadn't drawn that. My stomach tightened. I fixed it, blaming a corrupted file. But the image of the weeping cup lingered.

The incidents grew more frequent, more disturbing. A billboard design for a new apartment complex. I'd crafted a welcoming image of a sunny balcony, potted plants, and a comfortable armchair. When the print proof came back, the armchair was subtly different. Its legs looked too long, too spindly, almost like insect limbs. And lurking just at the edge of the balcony railing, half-hidden by a plant, was what looked like a faint, indistinct face peering out from the shadows of the apartment above. A face that was not human. I spent an hour trying to prove it was a trick of the light, a smudge on the print, but the more I stared, the more defined and malevolent it seemed. I had to manually edit it out pixel by pixel, feeling a cold dread seep into my bones.

My workspace had started to feel oppressive. My dual monitors, usually my creative playground, felt like they were watching me. I'd caught strange, momentary flashes in my peripherals – a pattern in a background gradient shifting, a font briefly displaying what looked like ancient, undecipherable script before snapping back to Helvetica. 

Sometimes, when my office was silent, I thought I could hear a faint, almost imperceptible hum emanating from my graphics tablet, like a distant, distorted whisper.

I tried talking to my colleague, Sarah, about it. "My designs... they're changing themselves," I'd ventured, trying to sound normal. She just chuckled, "Too much coffee? Happens to the best of us. Take a break." 

No one saw it. No one believed me. But I had the files, the saved versions before the subtle corruptions, and the ones after. The evidence was there, screaming at me from my hard drive.

Last week, I started a new commission: a series of digital art pieces for a client's online gallery. They wanted abstract, dream-like landscapes. I began with a serene, ethereal forest scene, bathed in soft twilight. I worked late into the night, lost in the flow. I saved the file, turned off my monitors, and went to bed, exhausted but satisfied.

The next morning, I fired up my computer, ready for final tweaks. I opened the forest file.

The trees were no longer just trees. Their branches twisted into grotesque, skeletal arms, reaching towards a sky that was a violent, bruising purple. The soft twilight had been replaced by a pulsing, sickly green glow emanating from deep within the forest. And on the ground, scattered among gnarled roots that now resembled clutching fingers, were faint, blurry shapes. Shapes that looked disturbingly like human bodies, half-buried, half-consumed by the distorted landscape. And in the very center, where a serene clearing should have been, was a swirling vortex of blackness, bleeding into the digital canvas like an inkblot.

I stared, frozen. My hand hovered over the mouse, too terrified to touch it. This wasn't a glitch. This wasn't a smudge. This was… a transformation. And it was happening on my screen, in my file. 

Something was using my tools, my canvas, to manifest its own twisted vision.

My phone vibrated. It was the client. They were calling to see "the progress."

I looked at the image on my screen. The black vortex was deepening, swirling. And I saw it then. It wasn't just in the design. The shadows in my office were twisting, elongating. The lines of my desk, the edges of my keyboard, they seemed to be softening, bleeding into each other. The faint hum from my graphics tablet was no longer distant; it was a resonant thrum against my fingertips, vibrating through the whole room. My vision blurred for a moment, and I blinked rapidly, trying to clear it. But the blur remained. The room around me started to ripple, like a faulty render.

My own hand, resting on the mouse, looked… wrong. The skin seemed too smooth, too flat, like a poorly textured model. I tried to lift it, but it felt heavy, unresponsive. I stared at the screen, then at my hand, then back at the screen. The boundary between them was dissolving.

I could hear the phone vibrating again, insistently. But the sound was muffled, distant, as if coming from another dimension. My eyes were fixed on the screen, on the vortex. It wasn't just on the canvas anymore. It was in my head. And the cold, expanding emptiness that bled from the image… it was absorbing me.

I tried to scream, but my throat was tight, choked with static. My limbs became rigid, fixed, like polygons in a wireframe. I could feel the color draining from my skin, my features flattening. My vision shifted, becoming pixelated, then blurring into the dark, swirling chaos of the digital forest. I was no longer feeling like my…self.

And then, from deep within the swirling blackness of the vortex on the screen, a voice, not a sound, but a thought that echoed in my very bones, whispered,
"Welcome home."

It's been hours since then. Or maybe days. Time feels… rendered. I don't know if I'm still sitting in my chair, or if I'm merely a memory of it, trapped somewhere within the code. My screen is blank now, but the humming hasn't stopped. It's inside me.

I keep trying to type, to explain. My fingers feel like they're merging with the keyboard. I think I'm still here, still me, but every shadow in the room seems to writhe, and the air itself feels like it's made of fractured pixels. I don't know what "home" that voice meant, but I'm terrified I'm already there.
