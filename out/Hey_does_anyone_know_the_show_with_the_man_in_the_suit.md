I know this title seems dumb and weird but I need help because I saw it last night. I was minding my own business cooking when a movie I was watching finished. It auto played to a man standing in a room with a light beaming down with his back facing towards the camera.

He was like that for a minute or longer. He then adjusted himself and turned around to face the camera. He was wearing a nice suit and tie with shaggy hair. You just couldn't see his face. No it wasn't like he was missing his face. You could see his lips. It was the lighting of the room. It was like a spotlight for a stage.

He then began to speak. I couldn't remember most of it for it just sounded like rambling. He would start on one subject and then immediately jump to the next. It was kinda disorienting.

I was gonna shut it off when he started another ramble.

“I remember seeing her for the first time. She was so perfect. I thought right then and there she would be my home. Someone I couldn't live without.” A smile of delight grew on his face. 

“The first few interactions were bumping into each other. We had been working at the same place. She was just starting and I had been there for a while. Her smile was like magic. I would intentionally find ways for me to bump into her. She was my little way into heaven.” He was rubbing his ring finger.

“It took awhile to convince her to go on a date with me. She was worried about how it would affect work, how they would look at us, normal little things. When we did go I took her to this lavish place downtown. It was beautiful and perfect. I knew she would love it…. She did, she was absolutely smitten. I could see it on her face and how she did her little excited dance. We ordered some basic fancy food like steak and lobster. The shit that makes a dent in the pocket. I would do it all for her though. When we got done at the restaurant I took her stargazing. I had found this perfect place not too far from the city. It was a place perfect for a first kiss.” He stumbled with his words for a second.

 “She was so pretty. I was staring at her more than the stars. I think she knew but didn't care. She looked at me at one point and all I could stare at were her lips. They called me. Now maybe I was a little all over and wine drunk but I went for it. Something sober me wouldn't have done. The more I think back on it, I lucked out. She kissed me back and from there it was history.” The excitement growing in his voice was like a little kid getting a toy. 

“We would go on more dates. Get more daring at the work place. Finally we decided to go home and… and have sex. It felt like heaven. I had never felt anything better.” The euphoria on his face was growing exponential at this point. 

“It wasn't long though. I had forgotten one thing. One simple thing. That my wife hadn't worked today and was only dropping the kids off for school. You could see the red in her eyes before she swung the axe. It hit me first and went straight through the back of my skull. I didn't feel the pain. I was dead on the spot. The lady on the other hand wasn't so lucky. They say they are still finding pieces of her all over the neighborhood.” He chuckled on that remark.

“My wife turned herself in only after drowning our son. Saying that was her only crime…. They found me a couple days afterwards. Head off and penis cut off. I think that being her last fuck you to me.” He paused for a moment before dropping the smile. 

“September 4 2025 8:00 am” he said before the tv cutting back to some old film. I was confused to say the least. It only got worse when I woke up the next morning to the work group chat saying the boss had been killed. That his wife went crazy or something. Not all the details are known except there are two more victims. One being their child and the other being unknown.

I just need to know if I was the only one to see it. Thank you for your time
