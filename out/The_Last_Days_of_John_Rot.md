**DAY 1**

“Dr. Reinhardt?”  I looked up from my book to find my assistant standing in the doorway.

“Come on in, Carlos.”  Carlos stepped into my office, gently closing the door behind him.

“You have a new patient to evaluate,” he said, leaning on my desk.  He looked nervous, like there was something he wasn’t telling me.  I closed the book and set it aside.  

“Who is it?”  I didn’t spend a lot of time outside of the psychiatric ward, so unless I spoke to my coworkers on the surgical floors, I didn’t pay much attention to new patients that didn’t require psychiatric care.  Carlos swallowed hard, his fingers tapping on the dark wood of the desk.

“He’s a John Doe, got brought in a few days ago after he robbed a grocery store.  Employees noticed he was severely malnourished for someone his size and had an intense odor of mildew about him.  The police couldn’t fingerprint him, and he doesn’t have any forms of ID.”  I was confused.  

“So why am I being called in?”  Carlos ended up sitting down.

“It’s how he acts that’s concerning people.  He’s been refusing all food intake, hasn’t allowed us to give him a sponge bath, and he keeps saying he hears singing..”  I stroked my chin in thought.  

“Okay.  I’ll do an intake interview.”  I stood up, grabbing the clipboard with intake forms I usually used when evaluating new patients.  “Anything else I should know?”  Carlos scratched the back of his neck.

“Just…be careful, all right?  He’s not violent, but I have a weird feeling about this guy.”  I nodded, leaving my office and heading towards the elevator.  

My new patient was in a room on the far corner of the medical ward, the curtains drawn and the glass doors pulled shut.  On my way there, I stopped to talk to a couple of nurses to see if I could get some insight on this man.

“Oh, you mean John Rot?” said the younger nurse, her chewing gum squelching as she spoke.  “Total weirdo.  He just sits and stares out the window, or at the wall.  And he stinks.”  The older nurse, a longtime coworker of mine named Claire, nudged her, shooting her a warning glare.  

“Excuse me, did you call him ‘John Rot’?” I asked.

“It’s something that the younger staff started,” said Claire, rolling her eyes.  “You know how they talk.”  I frowned.

“I do, but that doesn’t make it any less unprofessional.”  I folded my arms, directing my next words at the younger nurse.  “In this hospital, we have a duty of care to our patients, physically and mentally.  How would you feel if you were severely ill and the nurse who was supposed to be taking care of you started calling you names?”  The younger nurse looked down at the floor.

“I wouldn’t like it very much,” she admitted after a long silence.  

“That’s what I thought.  Let’s keep the name-calling to a minimum of zero, shall we?  This man is our patient, and deserves the same respect we extend to every patron of this hospital.  Understood?”

“Yes, Doctor.”

I noticed the sickly smell of mold when I entered the hospital room.  I nearly gagged, but managed to suppress the urge.  I was a good psychiatrist, after all, and that meant I took the greatest care of my patients’ mental health, no matter what their physical ailments were.

The man sitting in the bed looked relatively normal:  tall and broad, with slicked-back blond hair, empty blue eyes, and a strong jaw.  But Carlos had been right; he was very emaciated, and his hulking frame made that all the more obvious.  He shifted his gaze from the window to me, a wan smile crossing his face.  There seemed to be strange patches of white on the lower parts of his face and down his neck, disappearing into the neckline of his hospital gown.

“Good afternoon, I’m Dr. Reinhardt,” I began, stepping into the room and closing the door.  The man nodded in acknowledgement, never taking his eyes off me.  “So, I’m noticing on your chart here that you didn’t have any forms of ID when you were brought here.  Do you have a name you would prefer I address you by?”  The man took in a deep, shuddering breath, before he began to speak in a deep, rumbling voice.  

“Soon I will have no need of such things as names,” he said, folding his hands in front of him.  The movement sent a long plastic tube swaying above him; he’d evidently been placed on an IV drip.  “But, if it will make things more simple for you, ‘John Doe’ will suit me well enough.”  I scribbled down a couple of notes.  

“Very well, John.  Now, I’d like to ask you a few questions regarding how you ended up here.  The initial reports state you were found in a grocery store, attempting to shoplift a cart full of organic mushrooms, is that correct?”

“They needed to be liberated,” John said.  “The mushrooms belong in the ground.”  

“Interesting,” I muttered.  “Why do you think they needed to be liberated?”  

“The earth is their home.  It is not right that they should be taken from it to fill the bellies of man and beast.”  He looked down at his hands.  “Can you hear them, Doctor?  Can you hear the song of the fungus?  It calls for its children with many voices.”  I continued to take notes.

The conversation didn’t last much longer after that.  John appeared to go into a catatonic state and would not respond to any more questions or outside stimuli.  Later that day, his transfer to the psychiatric ward was approved, and I planned to continue the interview the next day.  

**DAY 2**

John was in a much different mood the second day.  When I entered his hospital room, he was alert, flipping through a magazine one of the nurses must have brought him.  

“How are we feeling today, John?” I asked, lightly knocking on the door to announce my presence.  He looked up, his smile broader than yesterday and a light in his eyes that hadn’t been there before.  

“Not so bad…tired though.  And my head’s all foggy.”  I pulled a chair up next to the bed and sat down.  “I like the view better in here than my old room.  The trees are pretty this time of year.”

“They are,” I agreed.  “John, do you remember our conversation from yesterday?”  His brow furrowed.  

“Not really.”  He reached up and scratched at his jaw, and I noticed with barely-suppressed alarm that his fingertips were completely gray and shriveled, almost like a corpse.  “I remember you coming into the room, but I don’t remember what you asked me, or what I said.”  I wrote *memory issues??* on my clipboard.  He sighed.  “I’m not crazy,” he added after a moment, drawing his knees up to his chest.  The greyish flesh seemed to extend to his legs as well.  I reached over and patted his arm.  

“And I believe that.  But I need to know exactly what’s going on so we can get you well again.”  I set my clipboard down for a moment.  As a medical professional, I believed that sometimes connecting with your patient meant putting down the clipboard and just talking to them as a person.  “So you’re telling me your memory is a little spotty.  That’s okay.  For now, let’s just focus on what you *do* remember.  Can you tell me what you were doing, let’s say, last week?”  John bit his lip in thought, remaining silent for a few moments.  

“I have…I had a job,” he said after a while.  “I can’t remember what I did, but I did have one.  I worked alone…at my house?  Do I have a house?  I can’t remember if I have a house or not.”  He scratched his jaw again, sending little flakes of the white substance fluttering down onto the hospital blanket.  I made a note to ask one of my colleagues about it later.  “Allergy test.”

“Pardon?”  He looked up at me, eyes lighting up.  

“I do remember something!  I had an allergy test two months ago.  You know the kind, the real comprehensive one that tests for fifty different things?”  I did know what he was talking about, but he seemed to have gotten into a rhythm of talking, so I didn’t interrupt him.  “They take these little plastic things with allergen compounds on them and jab them into your back, then they make you wait fifteen minutes to see if you get a rash or something.  Whatever spot gets the most red or has a welt, that’s what you’re allergic to.” 

He shook his head.  “I’ve got thick skin, Doc.  So the scratch test didn’t give very good results.  So they had to go on to the intradermal test.  Do you know what that is?  They take these little syringes with the allergens and stick ‘em just under your skin.  Hurt like hell.  I about cried, once or twice.  The mold ones hurt the worst…they really gotta come up with a better way of doing those tests.”  

Now I had something to go on.  My colleague Dr. Leitner was a brilliant allergist and a good friend of mine, so he was naturally the first choice to consult about John’s allergy test results.  This would also have the added benefit of giving me John’s legal name.   

“That’s good, that’s very good,” I said.  “And was that when your memory issues began?”

“I think so.  The next thing I remember is going home and going to bed.  I felt like crap.  Next day, I go to make some breakfast.  Normally I have a kind of stir-fry with scrambled eggs, some green onions, sausage, a little cheese…and mushrooms.  I really like those mini Portobello mushrooms…or I did.  But that day, I couldn’t bring myself to eat them.  I’ve been eating that breakfast for years, but that day…”  He ran a hand through his hair.  “I couldn’t even look at them without feeling like I was gonna hurl.”

“What did you do with the mushrooms?” I asked.  John gave me a sheepish smile.  

“I took the whole plate of food and buried it in the backyard.  Still not sure why I did that.  Felt like I was…I dunno.  Apologizing for something.”  

“Interesting.  What else can you remember?”

“Not much, I’m afraid.  The days and nights have begun to blur together like watercolor on a wet canvas.”  The room was beginning to darken as the sun began to set behind the hills.  I moved to turn on the bedside lamp, but John stopped me.  “Please, leave it off,” he said, the light in his eyes beginning to dim a little.  “I prefer to be in the dark.”

It must have been a trick of the light, but I could have sworn as I left the room that the white patch on his face had spread.

**DAY 3**

The next day, I drove over to Dr. Leitner’s office on the other end of town.  He and I had gone to medical school together, though we had eventually gone our separate ways in fields of study.  In fact, this was the first time I had seen him personally in a number of years, apart from a couple medical conferences and when he was a guest at my wedding.

“Hi, I'd like to speak to Dr. Leitner, please,” I said to the pretty young lady at the front desk.

“Do you have an appointment?” she asked, eyeing me up and down.

“No, I'm not a patient here.  He's an old friend, I wanted to consult him about one of my own patients.”  The receptionist chewed on the end of her pen for a moment.

“What's your name?”

“Peter Reinhardt.”  She picked up the phone.  

“Dr. Leitner?  Sorry to bother you, but there's a Peter Reinhardt here to see you?  Mhm.  Yes.  Okay, I'll send him back.”  She put down the phone and smiled at me.  “Just down the hall to your left.”  I thanked her and went on my way.

Hans Leitner didn't look much different than he had when I saw him last.  His hair was slightly greyer, and there was a bit less of it than there used to be, but he still kept the same twinkle in his eye and the same spry gait he'd had in medical school.  When he saw me, he got up from his desk and clasped my hand.

“Peter, my friend, how are you?  It's been far too long.”  After a bit of small talk, I brought the conversation around to John Doe.

“I was wondering if you could look up some records for me.  See, I have this patient I took on two days ago.”  I gave him a brief description of the aforementioned circumstances, including the strange patches of white powdery substance and the greying flesh. “One of the few things he remembers is having an allergy test done within the last two months.  I mean, the man doesn't even remember his own name.”  Hans listened intently before pulling open a file cabinet.  

“I can’t guarantee I'll be able to find the record without a name, but I will do my best,” he said, flicking through the files.  “Within the last two months…that would be July 20th through August 5th…hmm.”  He pulled out a folder and flipped it open.  “Is this him?” he asked, handing me the enclosed photo.  A healthy doppelganger of my patient stared back at me, confident and smiling.  

“That's him!  He certainly doesn't look like that now, though.  What did his test results show?”  Hans thumbed through the small stack of papers.

“Mild allergies to a few pollens and grasses, as well as a moderate seafood allergy, though not enough to cause anaphylaxis.”

“What about mold?” 

“Hmm…no, no allergies to mold.  These tests aren't completely infallible, but they are very thorough.  What's significant about the mold?”

“He keeps talking about ‘hearing the mushrooms sing’ and how he's going to join the fungus underground.”  Hans tilted his head.

“I see.  Most peculiar.”  He raised an eyebrow at the stack of papers.  “Ah, yes.  I remember this man now; his name is Joseph Dolarhyde.  I performed the test myself.  He was generally good-natured, even during the intradermal portion, and let me tell you, having twenty syringes stuck into each arm is not pleasant, to put it lightly.”  He scanned the paper.  “They weren’t exactly atypical results; for all intents and purposes, Mr. Dolarhyde is near perfect health, as long as he avoids going on frequent hayrides.  No wife or children, no family in the area…”  He trailed off.  

“Hans?  What are you thinking?” I asked.  He had that old look on his face, the one that told me he was about to propose yet another ridiculous escapade that would’ve landed us in hot water with the dean if we were still in school.  He looked up at me, gesturing to something on the paper.  

“I’ve just found his billing address,” he said, a glint in his eye.  “What do you say to a little road trip?”

**DAY 4**

Hans and I met up outside a cafe in town, where we indulged in a light breakfast before making the hour-long drive to Joseph Dolarhyde’s home.  It was the kind of house I could see myself living in once I retired; one story, a decent-sized porch for sitting, a ways back from the road, single-car garage.  Definitely the type of house a mid-thirties bachelor would be comfortable in.

“Nice house,” I remarked as we parked in front of the garage.  Hans grunted in agreement.  

When we entered the house, we were both slammed in the face with the pervasive odor of rot.  Both of us held our sleeves over our noses as we hunted around for a light switch.  Evidently Joseph had been keeping up on his electric bills, as the lights came on with no trouble.  

“Smells like something died in here,” Hans remarked, coughing a little.  We split up to look around; while Hans made his way toward where the bedroom was assumed to be, I entered the kitchen, only to reel back in horror.  

“What the hell!”  The kitchen island was covered in gore.  Dried blood, bones, sundry organs, all of it splayed out in an almost artistic arrangement, and it took several moments of looking at the mess to figure out it had once been a deer.  I took a closer look, noticing movement among the entrails.  With bile quickly rising in my stomach, I realized that the little white spots swimming in the deer’s dismantled carcass weren’t tricks of my vision.

They were maggots.  I decided to stop looking at the deer.  Instead, I opened the fridge to find a sight that was no less disturbing.  All the food in the fridge had molded, thick layers of greyish-green and white fuzz draped over everything.  I pulled the neckline of my shirt over my nose.  As I stepped back, I noticed the fridge was pulled out from the wall a few inches.  Unplugged.

“Peter?” I heard Hans call from the back.  

“In the kitchen!”  I soon heard footsteps approaching.  Hans grimaced at the sight of the deer.

“You’re going to want to see this.  Last door on the right, but do not go in.  Just look from the doorway.  We shouldn’t be in this house.”  I wrinkled my nose, heading down the hallway to see what Hans was talking about.

I smelled it before I saw it.  It smelled like a high school boys’ locker room mixed with a manure-filled swamp, and when I poked my head into the bedroom, I could see why.  The bed, a simple mattress on the floor, was covered in mildew, in shades ranging from white to brown, and a large wet spot in the middle.  Looking up to the ceiling, I noticed a large rectangular hole in the ceiling, with water slowly condensing on the pipes and dripping down.  My brow furrowed.  How could anyone live like this?  Especially someone seemingly as well-adjusted as Joseph Dolarhyde?  I shook my head, heading back to the kitchen and Hans.

“They will likely want to condemn this place,” Hans remarked, hands in his pockets as he studied the walls.  “We should go outside.  The building is crawling with black mold and who knows how many other types of mold.”  We stepped into the backyard, finding a veritable sea of mushrooms of various species.  *“Mein Gott,”* said Hans, treading gingerly to avoid stepping on the rampant fungi.  

“How much do you want to bet none of these are edible?” I asked, half-joking.  Hans rolled his eyes.

“I’m an allergist, not a damn Rockefeller.”

We left Joseph Dolarhyde’s house with more questions than answers.

“Thanks for your help, Hans.  This might help restore his memory…”  Hans shook my hand as we stood next to our cars.  

“Anything for an old friend,” he said, smiling.  “I must insist you visit me more often.  I miss our talks.”

**DAY 5**

The next morning, I entered the psychiatric ward as usual, only to find Joseph's room empty.  Confused, I flagged down a nurse.

“Excuse me, where is the patient who was in 317?”  The nurse looked over at the room with unease.

“John Doe?  He was moved down to Infectious Diseases late last night.”

“Why, what happened?”  The nurse shuddered.

“When we went to check on him last night…his face.  Oh, God, his face, it was horrible–”

“What *happened?”* I demanded, coming very close to taking her by the shoulders and shaking her.  

“Half of his face rotted overnight.  We tried to clean it up, but the mold just kept coming back.”  The nurse was crying now.  “The worst part was, he didn't even scream.  It's like he can't feel anything.”  I probably should have stayed with the nurse to calm her down, but I was too preoccupied with the state of my patient to think of much else.

I'd never been down to the Infectious Diseases ward before.  It was a dark and cavernous place, with doctors roaming from patient to patient enclosed in plastic bubbles, their sterile suits crinkling as they moved.

After negotiating with the presiding physician and getting strapped into some PPE of my own, I was led to my patient.  He was sitting up in bed, the lamp in his cubicle covered with a cloth to keep the light dimmed.  

“Hello, John,” I said, trying not to retch at the sight before me.  Half of his face had indeed eroded away, a black fuzzy substance covering the left side of it.  I could see the white sheen of his teeth through the hole in his cheek.  His remaining eye fixed on me.

“Doctor,” he said, and there was an odd note to his voice.  I couldn't put my finger on it.  “You did not come to visit us yesterday.  We were… concerned.”  His mouth twitched into a smile, and I could see thin white lines piercing through his gums and the inside of his cheeks, what was left of them.

“I may have made a breakthrough in your case, John,” I said.  “My friend Dr. Leitner runs the clinic you visited.  He performed your allergy test personally.”  I pulled out the copy of the photo Hans had given me.  “Your name is Joseph Dolarhyde.”  He stared at me, unblinking.

“No,” he said finally.  “That may have been our name once, but it no longer belongs to us.  As we said upon our first meeting, we shall soon have no need of names.  Where we are going, the many are one.”  He paused, tilting his head, the motion sending a few of his teeth cascading from his jaw onto the blanket.  He didn't seem to notice.  “But, we know names are important to you.  If you must have one for us…the name the nurses above called us will suffice.  John Rot.  It has a nice ring to it, no?”

“Who is this ‘us’ you keep referring to?” I asked, getting increasingly unsettled.  

“The network,” he said.  “The conglomeration of roots.  Mother Mycelium and her children.  We are the ones you try to bleach and burn.”  I shivered.

“Are you in any pain?”  He laughed then, a cold, hollow sound with no emotion in it.

“Do you care for us, Doctor?  Or do you care for the body we inhabit?  Why are you here?”  I couldn't answer.

“Did you kill that deer?” I asked.

“It was dead when we found it.  We do not kill.  Only consume.”

Later, I conferred with the doctors who had made the decision to move him down to the Infectious Diseases ward.  They told me that they had done an MRI before moving him.

His central nervous system was almost completely overtaken by thin, almost microscopic threads of mycelium.

The doctors told me there was no way they could operate.

One way or another, Joseph Dolarhyde was going to die.

And there was nothing I could do.

**DAY 6**

Joseph was worse today.  Or, I should say John was worse today.  

Most of his face was gone.  I don't even know how he was still speaking, or how he could maintain eye contact with slim, delicate black trumpet mushrooms growing from the sockets.  The mold had spread from his body to cover the bed and the floor in a soft, foul-smelling carpet.  

“You came back,” he said when I approached the cubicle.  

“It's my job,” I answered.  He lay back on his bed, fingers twitching lightly.  

“The body we inhabit wishes to speak to you,” he said.  “It wishes to bid you… farewell.”  There was a brief shudder and cracking of bone before he turned his head and spoke again.

“Doc…?”  I was holding back tears at this point, cursing my helplessness.  “I can't…I can't see you.  It hurts to… breathe.  Where…am I?”  He continued to wheeze heavily for a few moments more.  “Doc?  You there?”  

“I-i'm here, Joseph.”  He smiled as best he could.  “I'm sorry.”  

“Don't…be.  Thanks for…trying.”  He took a long, rattling breath in, then exhaled.

“Is he…is he gone?” I asked after a long silence.  He spoke again, this time in a chorus of a thousand whispers.

“He has become one with Mother Mycelium.  As will you, one day.  There is room for all in the song of the spore.”  John sat up, his head twisting to follow me as I circled the cubicle.  “Your long struggle…your attempts to purge us…if we required emotion, we would be amused.”

“Why?” I asked.  “It wasn't his time.  He could have lived longer if you would have left him alone!”  I wasn't just sad, I was angry.  But how can you be angry at something that doesn't understand anger?

“And you think that should be your choice to make?”  John's face twisted into a smirk.  “We are ancient, Doctor, as old as the stars themselves.  We are the foundations of the earth, and we consume the earth.”  I clenched my fists, as much in defiance as in despair.  For a moment, I could almost pretend.  As long as I kept him talking, I could pretend I could still save him.

“I will find a way to stop you.  I swear it.”  

“Stop us?”  He laughed, his head tilting back so far it almost snapped off his neck, before he suddenly got off the bed, coming up to the thick plastic partition and placing a hand on it.  Black tendrils spread out from the point of contact.  “You misunderstand us, Doctor.  You fight so hard against the decay, thinking it is your undoing.  But our consumption is not a conquest.”  His expression became almost sympathetic.  “It is a kindness.  A rescue.  Are you not yet weary of the pain?”  I started to walk away, feeling like I needed to get out of this damn protective gear before it choked me.  “You will cease to breathe one day, Doctor.  Then you too will join the children of the spore in the song of Mother Mycelium.”

“Stop talking!” I called over my shoulder.  He was silent for a moment before calling out to me again.

“You cannot kill us in a way that matters.  When all life is put to silence, the song of Mother Mycelium will fill the empty earth.  And we will rejoice in the dark, together.  You will see it, one day.”

**DAY 7**

I went to visit John in his cubicle earlier today.  All I found when I got there was a large patch of yellow mushrooms growing out of his hospital bed.  I called over one of the ward's doctors, and he went in to take samples of the mushrooms for analysis.

When he cut them with a scalpel, they bled.  

The hospital sent me home for a few days to recover from the ordeal.

I've started getting a really bad cough, and my fingertips are stained black.

I think I need to get my allergies tested.

The week-old salmon in my fridge is starting to sing to me.
