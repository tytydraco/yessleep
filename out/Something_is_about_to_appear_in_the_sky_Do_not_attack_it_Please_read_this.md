Don’t panic. Don’t attack. I’m writing this in an attempt to break the loop. Let me explain.

Before it all went to hell, I was a soldier. Special forces. The kind of guy the government sends when diplomacy’s off the table. I didn’t believe in gods or aliens. Just objectives.

Then the sky broke open.

A ship—impossibly massive, black as void—entered orbit. Silent. No broadcast. No warning. Just a presence. Like something ancient had woken up.

They didn’t speak. They didn’t negotiate. They just acted. Major cities blinked out of existence, defense grids disabled, entire governments decapitated within hours.

People called them the Anunnaki.

They said the name came from ancient times—Sumerian gods who descended from the heavens. Gave humanity knowledge, built empires, and promised they’d return. Some said they created us.

That’s when we were called in for Operation Tempus.

You see, time travel wasn’t science fiction anymore. For decades, our brightest minds had been experimenting with temporal anomalies found in certain deep-earth quantum pockets—places where time didn’t move quite right. They were unstable, barely understood, but the war forced their hand.

The plan was simple: go back 2,000 years, seed early civilizations with science, knowledge, and strategy. Make humanity strong enough to stand a chance when the Anunnaki came.

So we did it.

We didn’t just hand out technology. We taught them how to build it. How to think. How to question the world around them. In Egypt, we showed scribes how to track the stars and measure time. In Europe, we taught blacksmiths the secrets of alloying iron. In Rome, we trained engineers and generals, seeding the idea of causality. We weren’t gods we were teachers.

After decades, we were supposed to die in the past but the portal reopened.

We came home.

But nothing had changed.

No advanced cities. No space fleets. No global unity. Just Earth lightly cleaner, slightly quieter. Like we’d never left.

We thought the mission had failed.

We needed to know why. So we started digging—searching for traces of what we’d done. And in the sands of Iraq, we found a buried chamber—one not found in any archaeological record.

Inside were stone walls covered in carvings. Winged beings. Helmets. Symbols. Weapons that looked far too familiar.

One figure had *my face*. Scar and all.

Another wore our mission patch.

We stood there, staring at ancient stone that remembered us better than history did.

We didn’t say it out loud. But deep down, we all felt it.

We *suspected*.

But we didn’t want to believe it.

So we did the only thing we could to protect Earth.

By our calculations, the Anunnaki would arrive in Earth orbit in about a month. So we started building our own ship—using what we had learned from the original attack, reverse-engineering what we could from the Anunnaki's tech and tactics.

Not to conquer. To defend.

We thought: maybe this time, we could stop the invasion before it began.

So we launched.

And the second we entered orbit, Earth retaliated.

They saw us and panicked.

Multiple nuclear missiles were launched.

We shot them down. But the debris fell back to Earth, causing massive damage to cities below.

And in that moment—watching the sky light up with fire, feeling the Earth recoil from us in fear—we understood.

There are no ancient gods.

No returning race.

There is no *them*.

There’s only *us*.

The conquerors weren’t aliens.

History didn’t repeat itself.

It looped.

And maybe peace doesn’t come from liberation.

Maybe it comes from control.

We’re not here to destroy Earth.

We’re here to guide it toward a better future.

And someone else will try to stop us.

They’ll fail.

Just like we did.
