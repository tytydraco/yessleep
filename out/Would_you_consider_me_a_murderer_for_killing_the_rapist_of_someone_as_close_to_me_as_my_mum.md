I figured it would be a good idea to get this off my chest because it has been hunting me my entire life. Every time I go to sleep, I think about it and, when I close my eyes, I feel like it is happening again. Suicide, and believe me when I say that the idea of dying feels right, but I know I don't have the courage to do it, especially because I've been in the hospital for almost five months following an unsuccessful attempt to end it.

The story begins in 2017, when I was a young child, 14 years old. My parents were going through a divorce at the time, and they ultimately split up for a while. After the divorce, my mum made the decision to return to her own country and dwell at my grandma's house, and my dad went missing. I begged her to let me stay at my auntie instead of going, but I lied and I did not. I went to stay with my 30-year-old cousin at the time. Before he moved out and got married, my cousin and I grew up as siblings in the same household because his father abandoned him when he was my age. 


I was aware that my cousin at the time was a drug dealer and a part of the mafia and that my father at the time had cut off touch with him because of this, but I was okay with it. But what i wasn't aware of is that my cousin somehow fucked up and the mafia was after him. So one of the night i was sleeping and that took place round 3 am they broke in and put a gun to my cousin head if he doesn't give them a certain amount of money, which my cousin then replies with " give me a week" the popular phrase that you say when you know your fucked. They both agreed on that.

They attacked the house a week later at exactly 2 am, but no one broke in. Instead, they threw rocks and shit at the glasses, and that's when my cousin realised he had to flee before they came after his ass. After this seen of horror he started packing my stuff then he told his wife that he will drop me off at my uncle's house before travelling to another city, which I won't name to avoid being recognised. In the end, he loaded everything into his wife's car and instructed her to travel to that particular city, where he would then meet her. He went to drop me off at my uncle's, which was about a 40-minute drive away, after making sure she had left. While we were in route, his wife called us, yelling, "HELP ME, HELP ME, THEY'RE IN THE HOUSE!" 


My cousin then slammed the break halfway down the main road and he picks his phone and yells " if you do something to her i will kill you Mark" but instantly we heard a screaming noise coming from her and the phone call was cut off straight after that, I saw my cousin shatter at this moment. We then started driving back to his house hoping that we would get a call from her but every time we rang her it was the automated message. I still recall that ride since it was the quietest and loudest one I've ever been on. Quite to the point where i can hear my heart pounding. I was scared for my life don't know if it was because of the way my cousin was driving or because of the call or because we were are about to face a gang. 

As soon as we reached the house. He busted into his house with a gun whilst he told me to stay in the car hiding but i ran inside the house with a bat hoping to help my cousin. We found nothing there but blood and bullets everywhere, we then decided to check the cameras and thats where we found out that she had gone back to grab some money she had left there but, regrettably, the cowards had raped her. They shot the cameras soon as they did what they did so we didn't know if she was alive. We thought they killed her at this point. 

My cousin then calls the cops and informs them that his wife went missing. And for two days they were looking for her till they found her car flipped on the side of a road where she bled to death. My cousin was broken in pieces. I lived with him one of the saddest months till my dad came back after being off the chart. I went back to live with my dad and thats where i thought every thing is back to normal till i decide to go visit my cousin again. 

Nothing really unusual happened on that day until we went into town for dinner. As he parked outside a restaurant to get some dinner and snacks for us, I waited for him in the car. At that point, I observed him engaging in physical contact with a person near the car, and I also witnessed my cousin being stabbed twice in the stomach. Up until I recognised the man, I was shitting myself. I could tell from the camera footage at the house that it was the same man who had sexually assaulted his wife. I hurriedly grabbed my cousin's gun from the glove compartment of the car, went up to the man, and fired three times, missing the first two but hitting him in the left side of the chest, where I knew the man was dead because the bullet had certainly reached his heart.

My cousin was lying on the ground in a pool of blood, trying to stifle some words, when I ran over to him. I assisted him in going up while covering his wounds, then I sat him in the passenger seat and sped off to the hospital. I contacted my uncle, who came running to the hospital to remove the car and thoroughly clean the inside. Nobody has ever known what transpired up to this point, and neither my cousin nor I have ever been accused of anything. The vehicle he was driving at the time was a rental that wasn't in his name. 

I still question whether or not I will ever be forgiven by God, even though I am aware that killing someone is a serious sin. I beg Jesus to forgive my sins since I won't forgive myself for what I've done till the day i die.
