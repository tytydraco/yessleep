As a wife, I often engaged in casual conversations with my friends, who were also wives, about the ups and downs of married life.

It wasn't solely positive or negative; every aspect had its own blend of good and bad. However, sharing the less favorable aspects of marriage with my fellow wife helped maintain the strength of my own marriage while relieving stress from my mind.

At one point, I confided in my best friend Amelia about my husband Randy.

Over the course of our four-year marriage, he had undergone significant positive changes, for which I should have been grateful. Yet, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.

"What? Your husband has become more romantic, sweeter, and more attentive, and you suspect him because of that? Many women would desire such qualities in their husbands, in case you didn't notice," Amelia responded, with a hint of humor in her voice.

"Or... could it be that you suspect his change in behavior is because he's hiding something, like an affair?" she whispered to me.

"No, no. I mean, I did suspect that at one point, but there were no signs of anything like that," I replied, sipping my coffee. "That's not what I meant."

"I mean, physically, he looked the same down to the smallest details: the birthmark, the scars from his college days, even the way he spoke. But deep down, I felt like he wasn't the man I married five years ago," I explained.

"How so?" Amelia asked. "I don't know, Ames. I just feel it."

"When did you start feeling this way?" she inquired again.

I paused for a moment, gazing at the ceiling of my house, trying to recollect my memories.

"About three years ago," I responded.

It was true. Three years ago, I sensed something different about him. He seemed slightly uncomfortable, as if he wasn't accustomed to certain things he used to be experienced with. However, as time went by, things appeared to return to normal. Nothing else struck me as peculiar, aside from the occasional uneasy feeling.

I did try to confront him about his apparent change, which resulted in a heated argument. However, none of our arguments provided evidence to support my suspicions. Perhaps I was overreacting, but I asked him about our shared moments, even the smallest details that only we knew.

Surprisingly, he answered everything flawlessly.

Despite his successful efforts to prove himself, I still felt uneasy. With each passing day, my uneasiness grew stronger, fueling my thoughts.

Apart from my uneasy gut feeling, he transformed into an ideal spouse rather than the opposite.

You could call me ungrateful or anything, but as much as I wished for a perfect partner, I have come this far to realize that there is no such thing as a perfect partner.

Then, one fateful day, I received the answer I dreaded.

It was early morning when my husband left for the office, and I bid him farewell with a kiss at the door. A few hours later, there was an abrupt knock on my door, followed by police officers presenting a search warrant for my house.

"What? What is this about? I haven't done anything," I exclaimed frantically.

"We are looking for your husband," the detective informed me. "But he's still at the office," I responded, my heart racing at the detective's unsettling reply.

"No, not that one," the detective clarified.

‘Not that one?’ What the hell is that supposed to mean??

They instructed me to sit and wait on the couch while they combed through the house. Horror struck me when I witnessed some of the officers emerging from the basement, carrying a body bag in their hands.

"Wait, what? A body bag? Is there a dead body in the house? Who is it?" I stammered in panic and horror.

"We have confirmed it. It's your husband," the detective announced.

I was shocked. It felt like my heart had stopped for a brief moment.

"No, that can't be. He's still at the office. I saw it with my own eyes when he left the house and got into his car earlier this morning," I pleaded once again with the detective.

The detective beckoned me closer. "He was well-preserved, due to mummification, so it's safe for you to see and verify," the detective explained as he unzipped the body bag, revealing the lifeless face of Randy, my husband.

"Have you ever felt that something was off about your husband lately?" the detective asked me when I finally managed to gather myself.

"Well, to be honest, yes. But whenever I confronted him with personal questions, he always had the right answers," I explained.

"He was an expert. It seems he diligently followed your every move before deciding to assume your husband's identity. He studied your husband's scars, learned to mimic his speech and gait—everything. This man is a deranged stalker. It's nearly impossible to distinguish the two apart, except for your intuition," the detective revealed.

I sank back onto the couch, burying my face in my hands. I had no idea how to react or what steps to take next.

"I wonder how long he has been impersonating my husband," I mumbled.

"Based on our medical examiner's findings and our investigation, we can roughly estimate the duration," the detective informed me, pausing for a moment.

"I'm sorry, ma'am, but did you perhaps live with your husband before you got married?" he asked politely, sitting next to me on the couch.

"No," I replied. "I moved in with him after we got married."

"Regarding the questions you asked during your confrontation, when did the events related to those questions occur?" the detective inquired.

I stared at the detective, consumed by disappointment and anger at myself. I was certain my face turned crimson with embarrassment.

"Oh... dear God..." I murmured as I forcefully slapped my own face with both hands.

"Ma'am?" the detective tried to console me.

"Three years..." I responded. "It all started three years ago with those events. No wonder..."

Suddenly, the detective reached into his pocket and pulled out a vibrating cell phone.

"Yes, Detective Roberts speaking," he answered the call. After listening for a moment, he ended the call with disappointment evident in his face and voice.

"Great," he muttered.

"What is it?" I asked.

"The other half of my team was rushing to your husband's office at the same time I rushed here. We were attempting to apprehend him," he explained. "My team just reported that he isn't in the office. It appears we were too late," he continued.

"Only God knows where he'll be and who he'll transform into next."
