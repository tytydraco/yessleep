I love working in healthcare. But I also hate working in healthcare. And that only makes sense if you have worked in healthcare. You know, all these moments of gratitude and being able to help less fortunate humans. But then there’s these super entitled rude patients who think it’s cool to yell at you and verbally abuse you. "How much longer is the wait? Why is this taking so goddamn long? And why did the person whose arm got cut off go in before me who just has a sore throat?" And very often, people will flip tables and kick over chairs in the waiting area out of frustration about the long wait times. Or come into the emergency room for things they could see their GP for. And then yellingly complain about the long wait times. My mom thinks my job is turning me into a grouchy negative person who hates everything. "Melissa, that job is not for you. I don’t know why you took it." Did I tell you that my name is Melissa? Well, now you know. Whatever, I’m going off topic.

Today I started my morning shift in the ER like I do every day. I was in a blah mood. Not really feeling anything. I just got settled at my desk, fixed myself a coffee and started my desk computer when my coworker Jason walked in. "Heyyyyy Melissa! Good to see you. How’s it going?"

"Eh… it’s going", I said as I took a big slurp of my coffee. Jason laughed. "Normally when people say that, it means they attempted suicide that morning!" I let out brief, a one-syllable cynical laugh. "Well I’m not one of the patients that need to come in here. Could be worse. I could be shoving a power drill up my arse and then saying I can’t get it out. Like that poor dude who came in yesterday. Or that lady who complained that her pills were too big and got stuck in her throat and it turned out they were suppositories." Jason grinned briefly, then he wiped sweat off his forehead. "Jesus, it sure is hot in here. We need air conditioning in this hospital..." I nodded briefly, as I shuffled through some paperwork. "… you know... to keep the vegetables fresh and in good state", Jason added while grinning bigger. The longer you work in healthcare, the darker your humor and your coffee get. And sometimes, a few dark jokes are necessary to get through a day of seeing so many unwell people for 10 hours a day. And the vegetable joke was actually one of the most benign jokes me crack on a daily basis. I agreed, it sure was pretty hot for a mid-late September day. Anyway, we didn’t have much more time to chat because the first patients came in and Jason had to go help a guy who fainted in the lobby.

My shift went pretty normal for an average day, I was just about to get myself new coffee when this man walked through the door and toward my reception desk. As always, I smile and wait for him to come up to me. “Hi. How can I help you?” The man, an older guy (maybe 50) with big wrinkles on his forehead, put both his hands on my desk. He wore a burgundy-colored suit, a red shirt underneath and brown patent-leather shoes. His hair was yellow-blond, very sleek, and a little longer over his ears, and he had very bright, blue eyes. He didn't look sick at all, except that his skin appeared very yellow.  “I... I am not feeling well”, he said with a quivery voice. His voice was a tenor and scratchy. “I need help urgently.” “What’s wrong?”, I asked. “I got prescribed this...” he slided a small pack of pills towards me and I saw that those were strong antibiotics. “I took them, and it got worse. My ear hurts so bad. I can’t hear on it anymore. *And I feel like they are coming after me.”*

The last sentence, his voice suddenly sounded extremely deep and serious & not quivery at all. I was not surprised. As an ER receptionist, I have pretty much seen and heard it all. So I don’t get phased easily by patients saying weird stuff mid-conversation. From grown adult men shoving drills up their butts over pledges who put plastic bags over their heads and then sprayed pepper spray into during hazing it to people who severed each other’s arms off with chainsaws, I have heard it all. But this man took the cake after the next sentence he added. “*I... I have done it. I am responsible for it. I made them all disappear. And my list is still long.*” I was still not surprised by that either. I am used to patients casually confessing to murders and crimes. I just listened to him totally unphased. Like I said, I’ve seen and heard it all. But his next sentence made me go WTF.

Suddenly he stared at me with a blank, zoned-out stare. Like a killer in a horror movie would look when they’re about to kill someome. His eyes looked like he was very mad at me and he was going to shoot me. “\*You are next. I know where you live, Melissa Windwell. I know. Just know, I know. I know everything you did. And I’ll make sure EVERYONE knows. And I know where your brother Travis is. Hoh-hoh-hohhhh.”\*What the...? How does this man know my name? and how does he know where I live, and my brother's name? Travis ran away 5 years ago and we never saw him again. We still don't even know where he went and whether he's still alive. So, what the hell? I raise my eyebrows and before I can say anything, suddenly this man leans towards me to the point where he almost lays down on my desk.His breath stank hideously – like a mix of sulfur, coffee and unbrushed teeth. His voice now sounds very deep and aggressive and scratchy. “*ahhhhh. Now I will send you to -*” and then his eyes suddenly rolled up, to the point his pupils were gone and I could only see the white. He then wiggled a little and dropped on the floor like a wet sack. His throat made sounds like a monster in a horror movie. Then he heaved and puked a thick, black, foul-smelling liquid. I called for two colleagues to come and help him, and 5 minutes later he was in an exam room with the doc.

\----------------------------------------------------

“Melissa, you’re overreacting. I’m sure it was nothing. That man was just having a bad med reaction or a little psychosis. It often happens as a result of those antibiotics. Sam said so too. It is a common side effect.” (Sam is the ER doc.)

“But how the heck did he know my name and where I live?! And Travis?!?! You cannot tell me that was the meds!”

“Melissa. Please. I tell you, you’re just seeing things. You probably just need a break, or a day off. Yeah. Go home, go to sleep, and get some rest. Tomorrow the world will be pretty again.”

“Jason, I am not dumb. I’ve been doing this job for months. I know exactly when something is not right.”

Jason put his hand on my forehead, but I dodged my head away. “Jason, what’s this about? I don’t have a fever!”

He looked really concerned now and his voice sounded very soft, as opposed to his usual quirky, grinny and energetic behavior. “yeeeh, you should probably rest for the day. Ok? I’ll take over the reception for you. Yeeeah. it's all going to be fiiiiiiiiine."

“And stop talking to me like I’m some three day old newborn on rittalin!”

“Look. I’m trying to help. Has it ever occurred to you that the man knew your name because of your nametag?”

Of course. I should have thought about that. But then again, that voice of the man sounded so evil and serious. I just CAN’T overlook that. That's not just an average psychosis patient. I've never seen this man in my life, And why would he threaten me like that? And how on earth did he know about Travis? I just hope Travis is alive somewhere. All I know is he jumped out of his office window at work and ran towards the ocean and was never seen or heard from again. Jason continued. "That was an ordinary innocent old man who had a bad reaction to his meds. No more and no less. Now, forget it.He did nothing to you and he will not. " and then he got up and went back into the hospital lobby.

Anyway. I'm typing this from my phone, my break is almost over, I have to go back to my desk in a bit. So I have to stop here. But I'm pretty sure I just saw Jason try to frantically wipe away some black liquid from his lunch desk before he left the break room. And for some reason, it oddly stinks of sulfur in here and it's 10 times hotter than it was this morning. But this weird old man won't get out of my head. How would the man know about my brother? And what does he want from me?
