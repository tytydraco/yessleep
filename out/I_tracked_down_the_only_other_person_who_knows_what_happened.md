Finding Clay took years.

Nine of them, to be exact.

The cops said Kenny fell through a rotten floor in a condemned building. Said the stairs gave out and that we panicked. That was the story they wrote down. We never corrected it. Some truths aren’t made for paper.

After that night, they split us up. Clay was gone first. I stayed long enough to learn how to pack without looking back. Every new home felt like a waiting room.

I worked my way through quiet jobs, half-pay checks, and apartments that smelled like old paint. The guilt never left. It just changed shapes. Sometimes it was a sound in my dreams; sometimes it was silence in the middle of a crowded bus.

When I finally started searching for him, it wasn’t about friendship or reunion. It was survival. His name barely showed up online — no social media, no address, just a mechanic shop in Indiana with C. Hill listed under staff. Same birthday. Same look in the grainy photo.

It was only one state away. I left that night.

The town felt like it had given up a long time ago. Brick buildings sagged inward. Storefronts stared back empty. His shop sat on the edge of it all — a low concrete box surrounded by dead cars.

The front desk guy looked up from his magazine. “You need something fixed?”

“I’m looking for Clay Hill,” I said.

He hesitated. “You family?”

“Old friend.”

He pointed toward the garage bay. “He’s back there.” 

Clay came out wiping grease from his hands. The sight of me stopped him cold. His face drained of everything but confusion and something close to anger.

“Jesus,” he muttered. “Isaac?”

“Yeah.”

He stood there a second too long, then turned and walked toward the back lot. “Not here,” he said.

I followed him outside. The air smelled like rust and cold metal. He lit a cigarette, shaking a little, though it might’ve been the wind.

“You shouldn’t be here,” he said.

“I had to find you.”

“Why?” His voice cracked halfway through the word. “What the hell do you want from me?”

“I just… needed to see you. I needed to know you were still alive.”

He let out a hard laugh that didn’t sound like him. “Alive. Yeah. Barely. You showing up here—” He rubbed a hand over his face. “It’s like you dragged that night out of the grave.”

“I never buried it.”

“Then that’s your problem,” he said. “I buried it and I’m trying to keep it there.”

“I can’t,” I said. “Every night I see him falling. Every night it happens again. Don’t tell me you don’t think about it too.”

Clay stared off past the junk cars, eyes glassy. “You think this is easy for me? I wake up sweating, gasping, sometimes hearing him. But I learned to shut it out. You should’ve too.”

“It doesn’t stay shut out forever.”

He flicked the cigarette into the gravel. “What do you want from me, Isaac?”

“I’m going back,” I said quietly. “To the building.”

He froze. His jaw worked like he was trying to chew the words before spitting them out. “You’re out of your goddamn mind.”

“Maybe. But I can’t move on until I do.”

“And you want me to what? Tag along? Relive every fucking second of that night?”

“I want you to stop pretending we didn’t leave him there,” I said. My voice cracked on the last word.

He looked at me like he hated me for saying it — but hated himself more for knowing it was true.

“Get out,” he whispered.

“Clay—”

“Get out before I make you.”

I did. I checked into a motel off the highway. The kind with carpets that hum when you walk and curtains that smell like mildew. I couldn’t sleep. The heater made noises like someone breathing through the wall.

The next day was endless. I walked circles around the town, trying not to think about how quiet it was. I bought gas-station coffee that tasted like burnt dust and sat in the car until it went cold.

That night, rain came down hard. I sat by the window and watched the neon from the vacancy sign smear across the glass. I thought about how he looked when I said Kenny’s name — like a wound reopening.

When my phone buzzed, it didn’t feel real.

“Fine. Ill fucking go.”

No punctuation. No explanation. Just that.

The next morning he was outside the shop when I pulled up. His duffel sat by his boots, and his eyes were red like he hadn’t slept either.

“If I’m doing this,” he said, “it’s not for you. It’s for him. And when it’s done, we don’t talk again.”

“That’s fine,” I said. “As long as we do it.”

He nodded once, slow, then climbed in the passenger seat.

We didn’t speak for miles. The radio stayed off. Snow was starting to fall again — the same thick, heavy kind from that night.

We stopped for gas outside Joliet. The station lights buzzed like insects. Clay went inside to grab food, and I sat on the curb beside the car, writing this.

Nine years later, and I’m still chasing the bottom of those stairs.

I don’t know what’s going to happen next, but I do know one thing.

This could very well be a one way trip.
