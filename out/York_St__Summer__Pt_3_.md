Honestly this feels like therapy just walking back through the experience. I’ve since moved in with my gf in a house that feels “quiet” and “calm”. Sitting outside now it’s a lot easier to process through everything. 

After the experiences I had with seeing the girl and then my mom tell me that she had heard the little girl running up and down the hallway laughing and trying to get her attention the house felt open to more activity. 

The summer in Denver is warmer than most people think and this house had no air conditioning. Even with fans it was easy to climb up to 80 inside with even the best fan set up. This was honestly my first step for my debunking, I thought I was having some type of fever/heat induced experience. I bought several “swamp cooler” style fans and while I felt comfortable temp wise it didn’t help. My next thought was carbon monoxide and/or black mold. I became obsessed with trying to find out why I was hearing, seeing, and feeling things. Nothing helped. 

The summer was a cluster of experiences, I honestly can’t recall each one in order because it was easily weekly, sometimes almost a daily feeling. The main feeling was what I could only describe as “static energy” I tried to explain it to people like standing next to one of those electrical towers. It wasn’t audible, but I could feel it walking in the hallway, in my bedroom, and the kitchen steps down to the basement. I’ll list off the things in the best order I can:

1. The basement steps: 

A) they were old and creaky and initially I would think it was the house settling, and to a degree that was the case however there were two very specific instances that was not the case. One night I was brushing my teeth and heard my cats pingpong ball bouncing in the kitchen and down the steps, this happened three times. A steady bounce-bounce-bounce on the tile floors and then hit off the wall leading down the steps bounce down one stair and hit the door to the back yard. After the third time I called out to my cat to knock it off. I remember so vividly sticking my head out the door and looking into the kitchen. And there was my cat, not in the kitchen but laying in my daighter’s room, in a very cat pose of not giving a fuck. There was no way she could have made it over there and lounged in the time I heard the last ball bounce down. 

B) I was working from home and had my computer set up in my dining room. Again in shotgun fashion the house basically was a straight line from the back door to the front door. My desk was set up in a way that I could look out the front window of the living room to my back room. I was on a teams call with an employee and heard footsteps running up and down the back stairs, to the point where I had to tell my employee to give me a second. I leaned back and told the cat to knock it off and looked back at the screen when my face went white and I did a a double take down the stairs. When I had looked back at the screen I had noticed my cat, again in a very casual pose sitting on the couch in the main room. I had told my employees about it and when this particular one experienced it with me I felt really validated. The steps were clear, they were audible but quick and playful. If it wasn’t a cat it was something small and curious. 

2) listening - it’s harder to describe this one but I’ll try. As more things happened I started talking about it more. Generally on the phone or on teams calls. If I was in my room, the hall way, or kitchen, and started to talk about the little girl I could “feel her” around me. What this felt like was a quieting of surrounding noises. If you can think about the sensation when you faint, the noise kind of muting to a quiet ringing, almost like tunnel hearing instead of tunnel vision. That’s was a trigger for me. The next sensation would be classic goosebumps, and then kind of like an inner radar where I’d just see a part of the room in my head. A lot of times it was the hallway. I’d just have this feeling of “hey look here”. All three of those would intensify and I would have to intentionally say no and walk away to break out of it. 

3 - the medium
Reading back I don’t think I’m doing justice to just how constant the feelings and little sounds were. I only slept with headphones there. Nothing ever felt evil, I just couldn’t keep up with the constant movement and energy. I needed to sleep, and things were too curious with me. It got to the point where I’d pretty regularly feel a little tug here or pressure there on my bed. I stopped letting my cat stay in my room to try and debunk that and it persisted. I told my mom about all of this and she, for my bday, told me about her friend who was a medium. Even with all my personal experience I had serious doubts about this all. I made sure to not give him any info prior to and told my mom to do the same. 

When I showed up to his house we sat down and did a tarot reading, a little cleanse and then dowsing rods. This was when my inner skeptic kicked in. Here I was holding two rods apparently communing with the dead. Nothing happened, I held them in my hands and asked a few questions and they limply moved but nothing of consequence. I remember him asking me to ask a general question about anything. I paused and asked if I should leave my house. The rods didn’t move but he looked at me and said “I want to talk about your house, there’s a girl there isn’t there?” I nodded and said “yea my daughter” and he smirked “no you have seen a little girl, she likes a bedroom, a hall way, and stairs. Very playful” I remember putting the dowsing rods down and just asked “what does she look like to you?” At this point I was trying to see if it was a tell I was giving off or something to make all of this make sense “she’s not from now, I see her in like a homemade type of sun dress, she’s probably close in age to your daughter, flowers I see flowers”. I was lost in the vision of the girl he was describing to perfection “she likes to play at night doesn’t she? You have balls she throws for you or a pet? She’s not evil, she just likes having nice people there. And…she isn’t the only one there”.

Honestly whether I had fully understood it or not I was at terms with the little girl I had seen but there was something else in the house, something older/bigger. At times the movement I had heard, and the energy I had felt was different. Heavier and not as playful. I really didn’t like hearing him say that. 

He told me that the girl was someone to talk to, basically talk to her like a parent if I was over her playing and needed a quiet space. But as I told him what I experienced with feeling the tunnel hearing, the inner “vision” of where people were, he told me to be careful. It sounded like I was “sensitive” and that thinking was one thing, but talking directly to something, allowing them in could lease to attachment. 

It was a long drive back home. 

Two nights later I was laying in my bed and heard books on my shelf being flipped through. At first thought I chalked it up to the fan. After about five minutes of the noise I turned off the fan. It kept going, like someone perusing through the books. I sat up quickly 2-3 times flashing my phones flashlight to try and catch something. Nothing. After one more attempt I turned off the flashlight and sat in my bed and said “I need to go to bed and I need it to be quiet in here, please go to bed” all the sensations hit me, the quiet noise, the goosebumps, seeing where she was….and then it was quiet and stayed quiet…I said thank you and fell asleep
