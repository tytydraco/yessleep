A few days ago, I found some old photos I took back when I was in med school, back in 2004. Wow. Has it really been that long? Five years since that night... and it still haunts me every single day.

Today, I work as a photographer at an ad agency in São Paulo. But back then, I was just a dissatisfied 19-year-old medical student. I had no idea what was about to happen on that trip.

My parents were right not to let me go the first time. I should’ve listened. I should’ve known better. But here we are.

My friends and I had been planning a trip to São Thomé das Letras, in Minas Gerais, for the whole semester. It was the first time we’d ever traveled together — a getaway before everything changed. We were all med students at FMABC, but I already knew the course wasn’t for me. I was going to drop out that semester… I just hadn’t told anyone yet. I figured this trip would be the best — or worst — moment to break the news.

As I was going over how to tell them, Matheus was driving peacefully down the road. João and Rebeca were practically making out in the back seat — gross. Good thing I was too anxious to care. Pedro, poor guy, just buried himself in pillows and blankets. Honestly, I should’ve done the same.

Matheus kept telling me to sleep, but I loved watching the road during car rides. After ten long hours, we finally arrived. I was sure nothing could go wrong.

I was wrong…

The view was breathtaking. I had this urge to burn through all the film in my camera just photographing the landscapes.

It took us another fifteen minutes to find the farmhouse we’d rented. It was tucked away in the mountains — old, but well maintained. That’s when things started to feel… off.

I know what you're thinking: she's imagining things. That's exactly what I thought, too. But the second I walked in, I felt a terrible sensation, like the house had been used for something... horrible.

I went straight to the room where I’d be staying and started unpacking. That’s when I noticed the film compartment on my camera was open. The whole roll was ruined. Perfect.

We went into town, grabbed lunch, and I stopped by an antique shop nearby. It was charming in a dusty, witchy way. I only bought a new roll of film, but at the register I noticed this small guidebook titled: **“Shadows of São Thomé: A Guide to Haunted Places.”** I grabbed a copy and slipped it into my bag.

As soon as I left the store, I started flipping through the pages. It listed spots like the São Thomé Cave, the Pyramid, and other strange sites. I was so focused on readingI, that I didn’t even notice Matheus sneaking up behind me.

“What are you reading?” he asked. “Jesus, Matheus, you scared me!” I said, laughing. “Just a guidebook for haunted places in town.” “You planning on visiting them?” “Please. You know I’m a coward. But I *might* lie and tell people I did.” “Oh wow, look at you — professional liar,” he said, grinning.

I stuffed the guide into my backpack and followed him to the car. “Before we go to the butterfly valley,” he said, “I want you to take this map. Read it *only* when you’re inside the car. Don’t say anything until we get there.” “What? Why?” “You’ll see.”

I unfolded the map. In big letters, it read: **“Want to discover these places with me?”**

There were little marks on all the tourist spots. I couldn’t help but smile.

When we got to Butterfly Valley, it was even more beautiful than I imagined. I was wearing my bikini under my clothes, but ended up too distracted to swim. The scenery was just too stunning.

Near the waterfall, I spotted a forested area. I figured my friends wouldn’t even notice I was gone for a few minutes — so I went in.

And honestly? It *was* prettier than the waterfall. The light filtering through the trees, the thick green all around. Peaceful. Almost too peaceful.

Until I saw it.

A doll’s head. Dirty. Abandoned. Just… sitting there. Surrounded by rusty objects — like old tools or maybe junk. But the placement was oddly perfect, like someone had arranged it. I took a photo. I mean, it *looked* incredible through the lens.

As I walked further, I started seeing even weirder things. Strange symbols carved into tree bark, objects hung on branches like some sort of ritual. Creepy — but also kinda beautiful in a haunting way. So I kept taking pictures. Who knows, maybe I’d end up solving a local mystery or something.

By the time I made it back, most of the afternoon had passed. João and Rebeca wanted to visit the São Thomé cave, so they left. The rest of us stayed at the house.

I used the time to explore.

The farmhouse was huge — and part of it hadn’t been opened in years. I remembered seeing a floor plan left on the living room table, and it looked like there was a wing we hadn’t touched. No one had said it was off-limits, so… why not?

I went to southern side of the house, found a wooden door with an old lock. In the kitchen drawer, I’d noticed a bunch of antique keys. One of them had to work.

And it did.

I inserted the key, twisted it — and *click.* The door creaked open, releasing a thick cloud of dust. I probably should’ve taken an allergy pill first.

Inside, it was like stepping back in time. Vintage furniture, old photos on the walls, a cracked leather couch. There was a dresser directly across from the sofa — covered in black-and-white photos of a family. Kids, adults, frozen in time.

Then I heard it. A loud *thud* against the window.

My first thought? Pedro or Matheus trying to scare me.

But when I looked… It was a bird. Tiny. Dying. A smear of blood on the glass.

I went outside to check on it, expecting a small wound. But the amount of blood…

It was way too much.

Then something shifted. My knees went weak. I felt lightheaded, dizzy.

I turned my gaze back to the window — and that’s when I saw her.

An old woman.

Inside the house.

Watching me from behind the glass.

I screamed — but when I looked again, she was gone.

I rushed back inside, slammed the door shut, locked it, and tossed the key back in the kitchen drawer. My heart was pounding, my hands shaking.

Maybe it was nothing. A trick of the light. Or maybe I was already starting to lose it.

I laid down for a bit to calm myself, but when I drifted off… I had the worst dream.

There was a cold breeze, then a freezing touch — and her voice. Whispering my name.

**“Sophia…”**

I opened my eyes in the dream, and there she was. The same old woman I’d seen at the window. But this time, she was pointing. Behind her, just outside the glass, stood another woman.

Tall. Unnaturally thin. Almost skeletal. She was wrapped in layers of heavy fabric, a gray veil covering most of her face. Only her eyes were visible — deep, sunken, lifeless eyes.

I woke up gasping. Heart racing. Just a nightmare. At least… that’s what I told myself.

I got dressed. Low-rise jeans, a KISS t-shirt, black Converse. My hair had completely lost its straightening, so it hung in messy waves around my face. The dream still clung to me, but I tried to shake it off.

Outside, the others were drinking and talking. We were joking about classes next semester — which professors sucked, who was probably going to fail pharmacology again. The moment felt… normal.

That’s when João, in all his genius, had *the* brilliant idea:

“Let’s play the Truth or Death!.”

Rebeca blinked. “What’s that?”

“You’ve never played the Truth or Death?” João teased. “Did you even have a childhood?”

“It’s like… truth or dare, but with a ghost,” he grinned.

“Seriously?” I said. “We tried that in ninth grade — the cup only moved because Pedro was blowing on it.”

“It was plastic!” Pedro defended himself. “That doesn’t count!”

João reached into his backpack. “Well, guess what? I *still* have the board you made in ninth grade.”

“You *kept* that thing?” I asked, genuinely shocked.

He held it up — a piece of cardboard, full of letters and weird magazine clippings. Just like I remembered.

“Let’s do this,” Pedro said.

We moved to the darkest room in the house and lit candles around the board. Each of us placed a finger on an upside-down glass in the center. João led the chant:

**“Spirit of the game, tell us what to do. Truth or dare — we’re ready to die.”**

The bottle started spinning. Hard.

And then it stopped.

Right on Pedro.

“Go on, Pedro,” João said. “Truth or dare?”

Pedro rolled his eyes. “Truth.”

The glass slid across the board, letter by letter:

**Y-O-U-S-T-A-R-T-E-D-A-G-A-I-N**

“What the hell?” I asked, my voice already tense. “You started again…” I read aloud, confused. Then I turned to Pedro. “Wait—are you smoking weed again?”

Pedro looked caught. “It was just once, okay? It’s not a big deal…”

The bottle spun again. It landed on Matheus.

“Truth,” Matheus said confidently.

It moved again:

**S-H-E-I-S-M-I-N-E**

Matheus frowned. “She is mine? What’s that supposed to mean?”

The glass started spinning again — and this time, it pointed to me.

“Truth,” I said, despite the tightness in my chest.

The letters spelled:

**D-O-Y-O-U-A-C-C-E-P-T**

“Accept what?” I asked.

João’s voice was sharp now. “Whatever it is, Sophia, say no.”

“…No,” I said, firmly.

The bottle spun fast — violently. It landed on Rebeca.

“I don’t want to do this,” she said, backing away.

“Come on, Beca, it’s just one question,” João said.

“I said no, João! I’m going to my room.” She stood and left.

Then the bottle moved again — slowly — pointing to João himself.

“Well, since everyone’s being a bunch of babies, I’ll go with dare,” he smirked.

The glass moved, one slow letter at a time:

**L-O-O-K-I-N-T-H-E-M-I-R-R-O-R-A-N-D-S-A-Y-T-H-R-E-E-T-I-M-E-S—“I-A-C-C-E-P-T-M-Y-D-E-A-T-H.”**

We all stared at him.

“Fine,” João said, trying to sound brave. We followed him to the bathroom.

He stood in front of the mirror, sweat already forming at his temples. Took a deep breath.

“I accept my death.” Pause.

“I accept my death.” Another breath.

“I accept my death.”

The room was silent except for the candles flickering behind us.

João was pale. Shaking. But still alive.

“Should we stop the game now?” Matheus asked.

“No way,” João said, still trying to act tough. “Now it’s getting good.”

We all returned to the table. The bottle spun again — and pointed to me.

“Dare,” I said, trying to hide the knot forming in my stomach.

The glass spelled it out:

**G-O-I-N-T-O-T-H-E-F-O-R-E-S-T-A-N-D-T-A-K-E-A-P-H-O-T-O**

“Seriously? That’s the dare?” I laughed nervously. “Could’ve been worse.”

“Just be careful, Sophia,” Matheus said, looking worried.

“I’ll be fine,” I replied, forcing a smile.

I grabbed my camera and stepped into the woods.

The first thing I realized? I’d forgotten the damn flashlight.

I could barely see a thing. My only light came from the moon and the occasional crack of a branch underfoot. The sound of my footsteps on dry leaves echoed through the dark.

With every step, the anxiety crept in deeper. My breath. My heartbeat. The silence.

*“Come on, Sophia, just take the damn photo and get out,”* I thought.

So I stopped, lifted my camera, and took the shot.

The flash lit up the forest for a split second — and that’s when I saw it.

A figure. Tall. Black. I couldn’t see its face. I didn’t wait to try.

I ran.

When I made it back to the house, the yard was empty. No one was outside.

Weird. They had to be inside, right?

“Guys? I’m back! Come see the photo, you jerks!” I shouted.

Pedro’s voice called out from inside, laughing. “Aww, look who didn’t get eaten!”

“I told them you’d chicken out,” João said, smirking.

“Oh, and we made a bet,” Pedro added. “Matheus already picked his share of your camera equipment.”

“Hilarious,” I muttered, rolling my eyes.

Then I noticed something strange.

My glasses. Sitting on the table in the living room.

“Why are my glasses here?” I asked.

“You left them,” João replied.

“No, I didn’t,” I snapped. “I wasn’t even in this room earlier.”

“Ohhh, I get it,” he laughed. “You’re making excuses because there’s no photo.”

“There *is* a photo, idiot,” I said, flipping the camera screen toward him. “Look.”

They stared at the image for longer than I expected. Too long.

“What?” I asked.

“You don’t see it?” Pedro said, voice low. “Look closer…”

I turned the screen toward me — and my stomach dropped.

There was a shadow. A figure. In the woods. The *same* one I saw.

Dark. Tall. Watching.

And now… it was in the picture.

I sat down, heart racing. The air in the room felt heavier. Thicker.

One thing was certain: **We weren’t alone.**

We sat there in silence, staring at the photo.

I couldn’t stop looking at that shape in the trees. It hadn’t been there when I took the picture. I *would’ve seen it.*

But there it was. And the worst part? It was *real.*

“We should stop,” Matheus said.

“No way!” João shouted. “Now it’s just getting interesting!”

The bottle spun again — this time, landing on Pedro.

“Well, everyone’s doing dares now,” he said. “Let’s go.”

The board spelled it out, slow and deliberate:

**C-H-O-O-S-E-S-O-M-E-O-N-E-T-O-L-E-A-V-E-T-H-E-G-A-M-E**

Pedro hesitated. Then pointed. “João.”

“What? Why me?” João whined. “Just because I’m making this fun?”

“You’re out,” Pedro said.

João stood, muttering, “Fine. At least I’ve got a hot girlfriend waiting for me.”

“Bye, crybaby,” Pedro joked.

“I guess we’re done then,” Matheus said.

“Yeah… we should stop,” I agreed.

Pedro shrugged. “Up to you guys.”

João was already halfway down the hall, and the rest of us gathered our hands over the board for the closing phrase:

**“The ties are undone. The will fulfilled. The board now rests... until called again.”**

We blew out the candles and turned the lights back on.

I went to develop the photos — the bathroom was the darkest place in the house. I taped up the window, set up the trays, and got to work.

Matheus poked his head in. “What are you doing, Sopinha?”

“Revealing a few shots.”

“Can I see?”

“Sure.”

He sat beside me as I carefully rocked the paper in the tray. He was watching me closely — a little too closely.

“Why are you looking at me like that?” I asked.

“Maybe because this is the last calm moment we’ll ever have.”

I froze.

He wasn’t smiling. His voice was soft. Honest.

“You always say the weirdest things,” I said, pretending to focus on the photo.

“I just… never know if there’s going to be a next time,” he whispered.

His eyes had something I hadn’t seen the entire trip. Not fear. Urgency.

“Matheus…”

But before I could finish, his lips brushed mine. His hands on my waist. Mine around his neck. He rested his forehead against mine, smiling faintly.

“I don’t know if it’s fear… or just you,” he said. “But my heart’s beating like crazy.”

I smiled, almost forgetting where we were.

Until the photo in the tray finished developing.

And I froze.

Matheus noticed my face. “What is it?”

I held the image closer to the red light. “This photo… I took it during the dare. In the forest.”

It was blurry — but you could see the dirt path, the trees… and a shadow.

I grabbed the next photo. And the next.

Each one showed the same forest trail. And in every shot… the shadow was closer.

“Matheus…” I whispered, “I don’t think the game ended.”

We stood there, staring at the photos in complete silence.

In every single one, the dark figure moved just a little bit closer — frame by frame, like it knew it was being watched.

We ran out of the bathroom, clutching the photos, and searched the house for Pedro.

“You said the phrase,” Pedro said when we told him. “The game ended. It *has* to be over.”

“Then why is it showing me this?” I asked, holding the prints out. “Why would it reveal that if we were safe?”

Something felt wrong. Heavy.

We went back to the board.

And there it was — the bottle. Still in the center.

Still pointing at something.

When we looked closer, our blood ran cold.

There was writing on the table now.

**Written in blood.**

Letter by letter, it spelled:

**T-H-E-G-A-M-E-C-O-N-T-I-N-U-E-S**

We screamed for Pedro, and ran into the forest — calling out for him.

After several minutes of shouting, he finally appeared, confused and breathless.

“What the hell’s going on?”

“The game isn’t over,” Matheus said, trying to stay calm. “We need João. Only he knows how to end it properly.”

We raced back to the house and ran to the room where João and Rebeca had gone earlier.

We knocked. No answer.

“João!” I yelled, pounding on the door.

Nothing.

Matheus didn’t wait. “If they cared about privacy, they’d answer.” He kicked the door open.

And what we saw…

I’ll never forget.

Rebeca was lying on the bed — topless, her neck slit open, blood soaking the sheets.

I turned and saw João.

Hanging from the door by a knife through his chest. His blood dripping onto the floor, slow and rhythmic.

I screamed. Loud. Broken.

We backed out into the hall, stumbling over ourselves.

That’s when I did what we *should’ve* done from the start.

I grabbed the board.

And I ripped it to pieces.

Then I lit a match.

“Sophia, what are you doing?” Matheus asked, panicked.

“What we should’ve done *before it killed anyone*,” I said, tossing the pieces into a metal bin and setting them on fire.

“There. It’s done,” I whispered, turning away.

“…Sophia,” Pedro said behind me.

“What now?” I asked.

He pointed.

The board — the one I’d just burned — was back on the floor.

**Untouched. Intact.**

The bottle moved on its own.

Back to me.

**As if it was calling me.**

“*How the hell do we end this?*” I yelled.

The board answered:

**C-O-L-L-E-C-T-I-V-E-D-A-R-E**

“What does that mean?” Matheus asked.

**Y-E-S-O-R-N-O**

“…Yes,” we all said at once.

The board replied:

**F-I-N-D-T-H-E-B-O-X. S-O-P-H-I-A’S-P-H-O-T-O-S-H-O-W-M-O-R-E-T-H-A-N-M-E-M-O-R-I-E-S. L-O-O-K-A-T-T-H-E-R-E-F-L-E-C-T-I-O-N-S-A-N-D-T-H-E-B-A-C-K-G-R-O-U-N-D.**

We rushed back to the bathroom and started developing the rest of the film.

As the images slowly surfaced under the red light, our hands trembled.

One photo showed the path I had walked during the dare — the same twisted trees, the same broken branches.

But this time, in the background…

A dark figure. Back turned. Pointing toward something.

In the lower corner of the photo, something new appeared. Words. Letters that hadn’t been there before.

**“Go back to where you buried your fear.”**

We stared at each other.

Pedro whispered, “What the hell does that mean?”

But I knew.

We all knew.

There was a place near the woods — past a dead, twisted tree — where the ground felt… disturbed. I hadn’t thought much of it at the time. But now…

We grabbed a flashlight and went outside. The rain had started again, light but cold, falling in sharp needles.

Near the tree, the soil looked freshly turned, like someone had recently dug there and covered it back up.

Pedro ran to grab a shovel we’d seen earlier on the house porch.

He started digging.

None of us spoke.

Then — *clank.*

He hit something.

It was a wooden box, old and worn, carved with strange symbols. There was a rusted iron padlock keeping it shut.

I brushed away the dirt with my hands, and my heart dropped.

Burned into the top of the box, barely visible beneath the mud, were the words:

**“DO NOT OPEN THIS BOX — UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.”**

We carried it back to the house. Our hands were shaking.

The board was waiting for us. The bottle moved again.

**O-P-E-N-I-T**

“What do we do now?” I asked, my voice dry.

“We *don’t* open it,” Pedro said immediately. “That’s obvious.”

“Are you insane?” I snapped. “What if that makes it worse?”

“Not following the rules already got João and Rebeca killed,” he shot back.

“Or maybe *following* them is what’s doing this!” I yelled.

“Matheus?” I turned to him.

But he wasn’t inside anymore.

He was standing outside in the rain.

We ran out.

“Matheus, what’s wrong?” I asked, stepping onto the porch.

He didn’t answer at first. Just lifted his hand into the air.

Raindrops slid over his skin — but not like water.

His palm was red. **Thick. Sticky.**

Blood.

“It’s raining blood,” he said.

That’s when Pedro dropped to the floor, screaming.

“AHHHH! Get them off me!”

“What?! What’s happening?!”

“They’re crawling all over me — spiders! They’re *in* me!”

“There’s nothing on you, Pedro!” I said, trying to hold him still. “There’s nothing there!”

He thrashed violently, knocking over furniture. His body was convulsing from pure fear.

I turned to the board.

The glass moved on its own again, spelling:

**B-U-R-N-W-H-A-T-Y-O-U-L-O-V-E-M-O-S-T**

“What is this?” I asked. “Some kind of curse?”

Matheus didn’t hesitate. He grabbed a metal trash can and set fire to a bundle of old papers and wood.

“What are you doing?” I asked, my voice cracking.

“Burning what we love. I’m going to get my lab coat,” he said, stepping back into the rain — the *bloody* rain.

I stood frozen for a moment.

Then I turned toward my camera.

My chest tightened.

That camera had been with me through everything. I’d spent all my savings on it. It was part of me. But I knew.

It had to go.

Matheus came back in, soaked in blood-red rain.

His eyes were the only part of him still clear — wide and alert, fixed on me.

“Are you really going to burn your camera?” he asked quietly.

I nodded. “We don’t have a choice. It’s us or them.”

He gave a sad smile. “You’re right.”

He tossed his lab coat into the flames. I could tell it hurt. It was the one his mother gave him when he got into med school.

“She’s gonna have to make me a new one when I graduate,” he said, trying to joke — but his voice cracked.

I looked at my camera one last time, hands trembling.

Then I dropped it into the fire.

It landed on top of the coat, sparks dancing around it like fireflies.

Pedro was still shaking on the floor, whispering things we couldn’t understand. I remembered something — a chain he always wore. It had two rings on it.

Mádisson Silva. His ex. He never got over her.

I yanked the necklace from his neck and threw the rings into the fire, too.

And finally, Matheus and I we threwin the board and the bottle.

The flames roared.

And then… silence.

The rain stopped.

Pedro… stopped.

He looked up, his eyes finally clear.

“It’s over?” he asked.

We didn’t answer. We just stood there, stunned.

Everything was still. Like the house itself was holding its breath.

Later that night, once the flames were out and our hearts had slowed, we called the police.

Of course, they didn’t believe us.

The murders were real, yes. But the board? The box? The blood rain?

To them, we were just traumatized students, caught in some backwoods tragedy.

Time passed.

Five years.

Matheus and Pedro finished med school.

I dropped out and started a new life in photography. Got a job at an ad agency in São Paulo.

Matheus and I got engaged.

We tried to move on.

Tried to forget.

But you’re reading this because I *couldn’t.*

Because it never *really* ended.

A few weeks ago, Pedro died in a car accident.

At least, that’s what the police said.

But I started dreaming about the forest again. About the woman in the veil.

I could hear her whispering my name again.

I knew then… we didn’t close the door.

We just left it cracked open.

So Matheus and I went back to São Thomé last weekend.

And what we found… I wish I’d never seen it.

If you’ve made it this far, maybe you still think this is just a story.

It’s not.

None of it was fiction. Not the game. Not the deaths. Not what I’ve become.

For a long time, I ran. I pretended to be normal. Pretended it was trauma, something we imagined. A shared psychosis.

But the truth is: **You don’t escape something that chose you before you were even born.**

Matheus tried. God knows he did.

And I loved him. I still do.

But love isn’t always enough to hold someone back from the other side of the mirror.





Last weekend, when we returned to São Thomé, I saw it again.

Not the house. Not the board.

**Her.**

Standing at the top of the Witch’s Rock.

Laughing.

Her laugh was like glass breaking.

Matheus called out to me, but it was already too late. I could feel the pull. The call. It wasn’t a voice — it was something deeper, something *inside* me.

Something that had always been there.

When I looked at Matheus one last time, I saw it in his eyes.

Not love. Not fear.

**Recognition.**

He knew.

He knew I wasn’t just Sophia anymore.

So if one day you find yourself in São Thomé…

If you hear laughter echoing from the mountain…

**Don’t stop. Don’t look. Don’t follow it.**

Erase the path. Pretend you heard nothing.

Because some doors, once opened, never close again.

And me?

**I was the key.**

— Sophia
