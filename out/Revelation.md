My girlfriend and I were fighting. She had ripped out my soul during a lovemaking session and then started gaslighting me about it. 

“Promise me you will never leave me” she had said to me days before stealing my soul. I wish I hadn't made that promise.

One evening while I was facetiming her and getting gaslit I heard a voice in my head.

The voice was an angel who claimed to be my wife from heaven. She told me to get in my car and sit there with the car idling while I prayed.

I listened to her, and fell in trance while I sat there praying. When I opened my eyes I was in a different city, parked in a parking lot by a stream.

I sat in my car and saw a couple fighting on the grass near me. I couldn’t make out the words but they were making quite a commotion. The woman's arms flailed wildly while she screamed and she hit the man. Her wedding ring left a gash on his face. 

She then screamed so loud I could hear her through the window “Fuck you Jimmy!” She then took off her wedding ring and threw it in the stream. She ran back to her red ferrari and got in and drove away. The man ran to his vintage corvette stingray and chased after her.

I got out of my car and ran for the stream. I looked around for a few minutes and found the ring. It had a huge diamond on it and was engraved with the name Clara, my girlfriend's name.


I ran back to my car and got in and began praying. I was scared and opened my eyes early, but after a few tries I got back home.


When I got back I pondered whether to ask Clara to marry me. This had to be a sign to do  that right? I would do it, I would ask her to marry me.

I went over to Clara’s apartment and knocked on the door. She giggled as I entered, clearly anticipating something else.

“I’m a succubus!” she professed.

“That's not what I want to talk about!” I said calmly. “Though I do appreciate you saying that and not telling me that I need to go to therapy like when I normally bring the soul stealing up. Why don’t you give my soul back to me now that you are admitting to your crime?”

Clara looked around the room frantically. “It’s in my soul jar, I’ll get it later. What did you want anyway? You said you had something important you wanted to talk about.”

I smiled and got down on one knee “Clara will you marry me?” I took out the ring and held it out.

She looked at me, then to the ring and then laughed “You want me to marry you? Don’t be ridiculous, we've known each other for less than 6 months! I don’t know you that well, and you definitely don’t know me that well. We haven't even had the poly talk yet.”

I looked at her and shuddered. She had mentioned polyamory as a joke once but I didn’t think she was serious. I looked around the room in a daze, then pocketed the ring and got up.


“If that’s how you're going to be then just forget it! I don’t want to marry you if it’s going to be an open relationship.” I said hysterically.

She looked at me with her innocent face. “Well that’s what I want so you can just fuck off”

I left after that and by the time I remembered about my soul she had blocked me on everything.

I sold the ring to a pawn shop in a stupor and got 8500$ for it.


A few days later she called me again asking if the ring was real. Apparently she had thought it was fake and was reconsidering. I thought about telling her I sold it, but just decided to gaslight her like she did to me. 

“Yeah it was fake, you gold digger. If it was real you really could have made off like a bandit if you took it before you ran though, like god.”  I joked.

“That's not funny!” She yowled. “What did you do with it? If you sold it where?”

I took her to the pawn shop the next day and we saw it there for sale. 13,999 was its list price, 4 karats.

Clara accepted we weren’t getting it back and said she would give my soul back to me on her birthday.

While I was running out the clock to her birthday she couldn’t seem to decide if she was dating me or not. It hurt me knowing that she would lead me on then flip flop like a fish and leave me on read. She liked to jerk my chain and it got unbearable after a while.

As Clara’s birthday neared I felt something truly despicable in the air. Like my death or an insurmountable amount of suffering. Clara was playing innocent and saying she wasn’t sleeping around, but I knew her word was worth basically nothing. I could just feel something awful coming after her birthday and thought she planned to ritually sacrifice my soul.

One rainy night when I just couldn’t take anymore of Clara’s gaslighting I decided to end my own life in an effort to reclaim my soul.

I raced down the highway as fast as my car could go and when my tired popped I slid into the guard rail. The car spun in a 360 as I fishtailed. Before I knew it I was driving again without any headlights. 

I pulled over and asked God why. “How could you make me play this out? Why wouldn’t you let me hit the reset switch?” I screamed.

I calmed down afterwards and heard a voice in my head. ‘I’d have let you die right there if you were a normal person, but you are a changeling! In order to get your wings you must at least live until the sentencing.’ Yahweh responded.

I didn’t know what he meant but did the best I could with what I had. I had collision insurance and it paid out the value of the car. While I was looking for one Clara’s birthday came and we met at the club like she said.

When I got there all her friends were there and I Saw her for all of 2 minutes before she disappeared.

I left when I realised she wasn’t coming back and later heard she went to Vegas.

She didn’t give my soul back either and a few days later it tried to return to me, failing to reach my body before being shattered into dust and mixed with nasty dirt.

After that I felt disgusting and inhuman. Doing anything became a total drag and I just felt like a gross presence in the spirit world. I wondered what I had done to deserve such a treatment from someone who had said they loved me everyday up until taking my soul. Maybe she was just a succubus? 

A few weeks later I was taking a silly training course in between jobs when Clara returned from vegas.

I refused to talk with her and didn’t want anymore of her black magic.

Most of the time the training course was rather dull but once a week they made us present something interesting to the class. This week Jaqueline had hit the nail on the head. She had found a map of all these underground tunnels connecting to Walmart on the internet and had it shown on the projector.

The teachers looked around frantically and got her to stop. I overheard them talking later and the teacher told her “If you talk about the tunnels they kill you. Don’t talk about the tunnels. Especially since you work at Walmart. One night Jaqueline might just disappear down one of those tunnels if they catch wind that you’re talking. “

The teacher stopped talking and turned and looked at me through the doorway. “Now that’s pretty rude, isn’t it!” She scolded.

A few days later when we were in class we heard a commotion coming from above us. It sounded like quite a struggle. I heard what almost sounded like silenced gunshots and then it went quiet.

I looked around the room and everyone looked worried. 

I then heard Yahweh’s voice in my head. ‘There might be some secret tunnels that connect to this building as well.’

The class was excused shortly after. And most people didn’t really show up after that, Myself included.

I went a few more days towards the end of the program and they usually let us leave early. Nothing was ever really said but I knew the teachers were in on whatever happened. There were low income apartments above us. Someone had clearly gotten on the wrong side of some kind of secret society.

As Christmas neared Clara started upping the anti with all kinds of promises, saying she would help me clean my soul and put it back together, saying she was done being poly, all the stuff I wanted to hear.

“If you let me back in I promise it will be alright” she said.

She was messaging me, and with the sore state of my soul I just could not bring myself to accept her apology, even though Yahweh told me it was my way out. For the first time I blocked her, and when I did something terrifying happened.


I was transported to a courtroom. I sat in the gallery with 15 other people. At the front of the courtroom sat Yahweh, the gold dragon, the Judge. To his left was Nibiru, the black dragon, the executioner.

“Bring in the accused!” Yahweh roared.

A red dragon was carted in and dumped in a heap on the ground. He had multiple electric tethers around him that jolted him if he tried to move.

A 6 winged angel was brought in wearing handcuffs.

One by one the 15 people around me were called up to the front of the room. Yahweh told each one in turn that they had blasphemed the holy spirit, and because of that the red dragon had influenced their futures. One by one Yahweh recounted a damning future to each of the people around me.

At the end he called me up. “You changeling, one who tried to escape this. This is the point you must reach.”

He recounted a damning future to me where Clara lied about what had happened and made everyone come after me. Yahweh said the whole town where I lived was going to try and kill me once Clara sicked them on me.

He sent me to the back of the room in a hysterical fit. 

Once I was seated Yahweh addressed all 16 of us. “Saren, the devil, the red dragon, has caused this gruesome fate for you all and that is why you are the jury to decide his death sentence. The jury will now begin deliberation.”

We didn’t even go to another room, we just talked for a few minutes and then came to a unanimous decision, death.

Yahweh was pleased. He took a wand knife out from under his seat and looked at Saren “This is the wand knife. I told you if you didn’t turn back I’d end up using it on you eventually, didn’t I? What you planned to do to me, to my wife. It wasn’t for love of her, but only to kill us both by severing us. The ship I’d have let you get away with, but what you planned to do to my wife, after what you already did to yours. You can not be allowed to reincarnate. The sentence is; death by wand knifing.”

Yahweh then looked at the 6 winged Angel, Satan. “This is not your doing, you will be given a painless death and then reloaded from an earlier point. You were the victim when Samiaza turned against us and you are the victim here. The sentence is; death by burning. Then your consciousness will be loaded from when you were still pure.”

Yahweh closed his book and before I appeared back in my bedroom, I heard the black dragon cackle.



I sat back in my bedroom wondering if I should unblock Clara. I looked at the clock and though I had been in the courtroom for hours, not a second had passed.


That had been the most terrifying experience of my life and I couldn’t believe how damned I felt. Yahweh himself had said that horrible future he had shown me was unchangeable. He had said that since I was a changeling I needed to do this to get my wings? What was he talking about?

I searched my mind for other mentions of changelings and recalled a month prior when some greys had appeared around me.

“I don’t envy you down there, changeling.” One of them said 

“We wish we could come down there and help you, but there is a prime directive you know. We are not allowed to interfere with doomed worlds or we’d go down there and blast Lima for you.” another said.

“Goodnight young changeling, we must return to our home. We are heading back into stasis.” another said with a yawn.

And that was the last I heard of them. I was thinking as I scrolled on my phone and noticed a news article about Oumuamua, apparently the first interstellar object. The article said it was an asteroid shaped like a cigar but I thought it must have been the grey’s ship.



The whole situation freaked me out and I do not know what to do. I had a terrible future and no way out.
