There are things you can live with. And then there’s what I did. I did something I could live with.

I was working overnights at a wildlife rehabilitation center on the edge of a national forest. I’m not going to say which one—some of you will try to find it, and trust me, **you don’t want to go looking**.

We mostly got raccoons, opossums, injured birds. Nothing dramatic. That night, the lights in the hallway flickered around 2:35 AM. I remember the exact time because I had just made a fresh cup of coffee, and the flickering made me spill some on my wrist. Slightly scalding the sensitive flesh. I was swearing and wiping it off when I heard the front buzzer go off.

Which was weird. Because we don’t get walk-ins; not this late at night anyways. We don’t even have a public-facing entrance. The park itself is tucked away so that the animals aren’t disturbed by the loud passing traffic.

I checked the monitor. Static. Just static.

I buzzed open the gate anyway. I don’t know why. Maybe I wanted it to be something different. I’d been bored for weeks, and loneliness warps the part of your brain that’s supposed to scream **“don’t do it, dumbass.”**

The man who came in wasn’t... right. He was awkwardly tall…  too tall for the doorway, even had to duck to get in. His coat looked like it was soaked in river mud, and he smelled like ozone and iron. Like a thunderstorm that got lost and found its way inside a dead thing. It was truly something awful.

“I have a delivery,” he said.

I blinked. “This is a wildlife rehab facility.”

“It was wounded,” he said. “You fix the wounded.”

He handed me a crate. I don’t remember saying yes, but I took it. His fingers were too long, and they lingered on the box when I pulled it away. Like he didn’t want to let go.

When I looked down, I swear the crate *shifted*. Something inside it *moved*. I heard a scraping noise, that sounded like claws dragging against wood.

He left without a word. I didn’t hear the door open, but he was gone anyway.

I should’ve left it alone. I should’ve called animal control or burned it or thrown it in the river. But I opened it.

Inside was a creature I can’t fully describe. It looked half-formed, like it had been stitched together from things that didn’t belong together. A deer’s face, but with long, mashing teeth. Human-like hands where one would expect his paws to be. Empty, black eyes that **blinked sideways**.

It was whimpering. It sounded like a child.

I didn’t have a choice.

I fed it.

I kept it in the back room. It grew fast. Too fast. And it learned my face. It began to *smile* when it saw me.

But that wasn’t the worst part.

The worst part was the dreams. Dreams of places that weren’t places—of **trees that bled**, of **moons that whispered**, of **my own voice speaking languages I’ve never known**.

Last week, it spoke my name out loud, clear as anything. Its voice was ethereal and haunting—a sound that most people would cringe or cower at just out of instinct.

Then it said, “Now you’ll carry me.”

And I am.

It lives in me now. In my head, my bones, my breath. I don’t sleep. I don’t eat. It feeds on regret and **it’s always full.**

I didn’t have a choice. That’s what I tell myself every night before I shut off the lights and feel it stretch inside me.

But you do. If you ever see a man at your door with a box...

**Don’t take it.**
