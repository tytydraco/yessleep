Liam, I wouldn’t have thought that this needed to be said, but I guess I was wrong.

When you hear sharp scratching – the sound of claws on metal – coming from the inside of a vent, you do not, and, *I cannot stress this enough*, you do not open aforementioned vent and stick your head into that small, dark space to investigate.

If you hadn't, maybe we wouldn't have found most of your body laying in a congealed pool of blood one morning. We don’t even know where the rest of you *is*.

Well, I think I might know, but I can’t bear to think about right now.

*Goddamnit*, Liam.

After he’d first been moved into the new building, Liam, my work buddy, told me over lunch about a sound he was hearing in his new temporary office that freaked him out. It sounded like there was something moving around in the vent.

“If you listen long enough, it actually sounds like a someone’s speaking.” He’d stared at me with such sincerity, and seemed a bit embarrassed to even bring it up, but there was something else there, too. Fear?

“What are they saying?”

“I crank up my music and try not to find out”, he smiled sheepishly.

I work in IT, and my coworkers have been acting strange ever since they moved to a new building.

Some of my coworkers, Liam included, were moved out of their old building, Building 1, for reasons we were assured ‘had nothing to do with asbestos’.

From the first day they moved to Building 4, things started to go wrong. The old fluorescent light bulbs shattered the moment they were turned on, showering Liam’s boss, Dan, in glass and dust, probably a bit of mercury too. But, once they were replaced, within a couple of days, they started to have different issues – an electrician came out and found that the wires had been chewed through.

Our company owns four buildings in the area, but the biggest one, Building 4, hadn’t been used in all the years I’d worked there. I’d always thought it’d been a waste to own a such large building and never use it – especially with the recent news about budget cuts and rumors about downsizing. It was a good sized building in a prime location, I wondered why they never used it, or at least sold it. Knowing what I know now, well, it’s starting to make sense.

They moved half the accounting team, and few seemingly randomly selected others into Building 4 after Building 1 was deemed unusable, and shoved all its other inhabitants in the other two. No offense to Liam – I mean, he wasn’t the fastest worker, as they noted on his performance review, but he was a perfectionist and he did great work – but it almost seemed like they moved the lowest performers there. I thought that was strange, why not move everyone from Building 1 into 4, rather than having several of us to a desk, shoulder to shoulder in the other two? They moved just fifteen people into that huge building and just the 6th floor – it didn’t make sense.

Liam and I would meet up for lunch every day, so he had told me how much his new building freaked him out, but even then, I still wasn’t prepared the first time I stepped inside – it scared the ever-living shit out of me.

The font entry was poorly lit, as if the sunlight had taken one look through the grime coated windows and decided that it’d rather not come in, thank you.

Even when you’re the only one in the elevator and only press the ‘6’ button, it stops on every. Single. Floor.

The doors will open slowly and jerkily, revealing unlit lobbies and silhouettes of toppled desks. The floors are mostly bathed in darkness because all the windows are taped over with something that only allowed a weak and grungy yellow light through.

After seconds that feel like an eternity each time, the doors will slowly close. It’s just long enough to *almost* give your eyes time to fully adjust. Sometimes you could almost swear you saw something crawling towards you purposefully in the darkness before the doors closed. Almost.

Sometimes I wondered if one day the doors would open and something would be right on the other side, waiting.

Staring out into the abandoned floors’ empty spaces while the doors open, an invitation to who knows what, always feels wrong –  even the times when you *don’t* feel the distinct sensation of being silently observed by something. It always makes my skin crawl.

Allie, one of Liam’s coworkers, told me how one time, while the doors were briefly open on the 5th floor – she could’ve sworn she felt the elevator move – that slight sinking that would typically indicate the added weight of an additional passenger, but there was no one there but her.

I chalked that up to her having an overactive imagination – it was the only way I could force myself into that elevator again, and I’d never risk taking the stairs.

Never.

Not after what happened to Ruth.

As much as I hated the place, I had to make plenty of trips over, it seemed like they were always having technical issues.

>*From: Dan*  
>  
>*Subject: My Computer is broken!*  
>  
>*Body: Kitty. I am so sorry, but my computer is having issues again. Thank you in advance for your help.*

I was on my third (yes, third) trip to see Dan in a week about his computer when he too mentioned the noises from the vent in his own office. Dan was a nice guy, the kind that brought his team cupcakes for their birthday and asked about your spouse or kids. They’d been ‘gently’ encouraging him to retire since he’d accumulated quite the salary over the years, but he loved his job and genuinely cared about his work and team over the money.

He’d claimed to come in to discover his computer pushed onto the floor, for the second time (the first time was your run of the mill issue). This time, however, ‘issues’ was a bit of an understatement – it had not only been thrown forcefully onto the floor, but there was this shiny black tar-like substance leaking out of it. I knew Dan wouldn’t sabotage his own computer. He hated change and despite his refusal to use our cloud storage, he was a meticulous record keeper. There’s no way he’d intentionally lose his work –  he seemed to be genuinely distraught.

“I’m sorry Kitty, but it wasn’t my fault!” He was borderline hysterical – his eyes, which were ringed with dark circles – pleaded with me to believe him.

“Its fine”, I said absentmindedly, as I searched for anything salvageable.

“But it really *wasn’t* me! It was the Night Manager! He doesn’t like that we brought the computers here.”

That was enough to make me look up, “Night Manager?”

“Yes, yes. He tells me I’m not managing my team efficiently and that the lights and sounds bore into him like parasites into soft flesh.”

If his statement wasn’t enough to unnerve me (and it was, by the way), the way his eyes flickered nervously to the vent above his chair – which at that moment, was above my head – while he spoke certainly did the trick. I thought I saw something up there, the glint of light reflecting off eyes, but told myself that I needed to read less horror stories.

It seemed like everyone in that building was having trouble. I made a trip out later that day to swing by Keisha’s desk. She had been out on an extended sick leave and just came back, so she was anxious to catch up on her work.

She told me that she’d lost internet access. I found that the cable had just been disconnected from the port under her desk, I figured she’d accidentally knocked it loose without realizing – but as I tried to plug it in, I realized it was… stuffed with something; clogged up… somehow. I eventually managed to get enough of whatever was in there out that I could pull. I kept pulling and pulling until I’d yanked several feet of something out of it, it honestly reminded me of when I helped my mom snake her drain that one time, and the feel of it against my bare hands was nauseating. I kept pulling but never got to the end to it. I decided to just use the open port for the empty cube next to hers but while I was down *there*, I could see deep, gouge like scratch marks on the underside of the desk.

I stopped by to grab lunch with Liam. He was blaring music so loudly that it hurt my ears even from 10 feet away – I had no clue how he could even focus.

“Sorry”, he turned the music off. “They keep getting louder”

“Who?”

He nodded upwards at the vent, then looked at me, embarrassed.

My trips to Building 4 became more and more frequent. More people had damaged computers, destroyed phones, shattered monitors – it was getting out of hand.

I got one particularly odd email from Dan that he must have sent from his phone.

>*From: Dan*  
>  
>*Subject: broekn*  
>  
>*Body: ktye im sorry but compter is broekn again dont know how to fix it, we ate having issue with the screen it goes dark but my eyes hurt it gets so dark I cant see I cant see cantsee*

I drove over, to find him sitting without the lights on in his office, staring into a dark monitor. His eyes looked sunken, as if they were receding backwards into his skull. The same liquid that had been in his broken PC dripped down from the vent onto his hair and shirt.

If he noticed, he didn’t seem to care or mind.

He’d unplugged everything, but was typing away frantically as if he were working. Despite me talking to him, it took awhile for him to realize I was even there.

Not long after, things started to get more out of hand. Liam told me that Dan was making him nervous. He used to be a nice and pretty laid back guy, but he was acting strangely, becoming harder on everyone and reacted with uncharacteristic anger to even the smallest transgression. He’d stand in their office doorway or just mere feet away behind the staff in cubicles, just watching and literally breathing down their necks.

He became insistent that they work longer and longer hours, staying far after the sun had set.

The day Liam didn’t show for lunch or text that he was running late, I figured I’d head over and see how he was doing.

His office door had been closed when I found him, and I could still hear his playlist going. It was barely audible over the scratching. Instead of his usual playlist of Dio, Anthrax, and Pink Floyd, a low and droning whisper filled the room. I only realized it wasn’t coming from his speakers when I saw that everything in his office had been unplugged.

I screamed when I found him.

Dan was in the office next to him and walked in but seemed unfazed by Liam’s body, or the smears of blood on the Inside of the open vent that went as far as I could see until disappearing into the darkness. Dan smiled at me in what I’d thought was an awkward attempt at comfort, but looking back was closer to the bared teeth of a predator.

Maybe if I’d thought about it more when I noticed how Dan’s teeth and lips were crimson at the time, if I caught on sooner, at least some of the others would still be alive.

After what had happened to Liam, I was hesitant to go back to Building 4. It had already freaked me out before but afterwards it had become the subject of many of my nightmares.

I tried to avoid going back, but I kept getting emails from his from phone from Dan.

>*From: Dan*  
>  
>*Subject: ned help*  
>  
>*Body: needhelp plse come*

&#x200B;

>*From: Dan*  
>  
>*Subject: Do I let himin?*  
>  
>*Body: do lethim in?*

&#x200B;

>*From: Dan*  
>  
>*Subject: Having an issue*  
>  
>*Body: Hello Katherine, I’m having an issue with my computer, please stop by.*

I tried to get more information, but he never replied or answered the phone. So, I took a few deep breaths, and headed over.

The lights were off again, and the building seemed empty, but smelled awful.

“Hello?”

“Katherine.”

The voice was raspy and drug my name out into three long and slow syllables, it cut through the thick silence like shards of glass.

“You’ve been ignoring his emails, Katherine.” I heard steps off to my side, “That’s not very professional of you.”

I swiveled.

Dan was standing in the darkness a few feet away, the pale light leaked in and illuminated his face. Black dripped from the corners of eyes and nose, but there was something else, a spatter of dried blood covered his shirt and the entire lower half of his face.

“They weren’t working hard enough.” he whispered, barely audible.

“Dan, where is everyone?”

“He let me in.” He smiled at me, I could make out a dark maroon staining his teeth.

I looked around, squinting in the near-dark but definitely could tell all the desks were vacant, although I could make out several slumped forms on the ground.

I sprinted back to the elevator, but to my surprise, he never followed me. He just laughed, coughing up a black foam.

That was the last time I ever saw him – well, except for the time I could’ve sworn he was on the 5th floor, peeking out of a vacant office with a smile, just beyond the reach of light from the elevator.

Our company said Dan went crazy, took himself out and everyone in the building out with him – why else would they find every other person in Building 4 torn apart, without any evidence of anyone else ever coming or going?

They pinned Liam’s death on him, too.

I think Building 4 might be where my company sends people to make them disappear. I mean, it’s cheaper than severance pay.

Why would I have such a crazy thought? Because I told my manager, Syed, that I was concerned there something else was behind what happened. He actually believed me since he too had made a few trips out to Building 4, and told his boss, too. I think his boss was also concerned, but in a different way than we were.

And Syed and I, we both got moved to Building 4. They gave him Dan’s old office.

He lasted a little longer than Dan did before he lost it, but that doesn’t help me much now.

I did call for help, but right now, I am holed up in an office, with Syed screaming bloody murder and trying to claw his way in through the wooden door.

It’s *almost* enough to drown out the cacophony of scratches and the whispered invitations coming from the vent, saying that there’s something back there that I really need to see.
