I recently moved to a small town after accepting a job offer. It was a quick move and hence I didn’t have time to find a proper apartment, taking the cheapest room I could find.

An old woman named Lynn was renting out her upstairs bedroom: $200 a month, cheap. “Quiet. Furnished. No pets. No smoking. No guests.” Sounds good.

When I arrived, she opened the door before I knocked, like she had been waiting, which is kinda odd. Her skin was paper-thin and pale, her eyes milky gray like cataracts had swallowed them whole. She looked blind, but she never missed a movement. She didn’t say much. Just smiled and handed me a house key that was already warm in her hand.

Right before I went upstairs, she said one thing softly, like an afterthought:
"Don’t cover the mirror. It doesn’t like that.” 

The room was plain. Wooden floors, one window facing the woods…and The Mirror. It was very tall, bolted directly to the wall facing the bed. The frame was deep black, the glass itself wasn’t reflective like a normal mirror; It was murky and smoky, like the image was coming through a screen door..and it was cold. The air near the mirror was always somehow colder.

I stared at it for too long. I remember that. At some point, my reflection blinked before I did.
On the first night, I woke up at 3:13AM. No noise. No movement. Just… awake. The air was heavy, hard to breathe. I rolled over, half-asleep, and glanced at the mirror. My reflection was already facing me.

Smiling.

On the second night, I covered the mirror with a sheet, going against Lynn’s words. I woke up to the sound of breathing that wasn’t mine; Shallow, shaky, wet. The sheet was gone. It was folded, neatly placed at the foot of the bed. And the mirror? It was clean. Spotless, no dust. No fingerprints. Except one: 

One perfect handprint, from the inside. Fingers too long, thin, bent slightly wrong, like they didn’t have bones in them.

I started sleeping with the light on after that.
Didn’t help.

I started filming it to prove to myself something was wrong. I left my phone propped up overnight, camera pointed at the glass.

Six hours of static. Nothing.

Except at 3:13AM.

For exactly one second, the video clears. There’s something standing in the mirror.

A woman.

Hair covering her face. Head bent at an unnatural angle. Fingers splayed against the glass. Mouth open like she’s screaming, but there’s no sound. Not even from the footage.
And behind her, in the reflection, is me sleeping, but I never moved.

When I checked the mirror again that morning, there was a crack in the glass.

Thin, spidering, as if something inside was pushing trying to get through.

I tried leaving. Lynn stood in the doorway, didn’t stop me. She just smiled with that same dead, brittle smile and said 
“If it’s taken to you, it wouldn’t let you go that far” 

She was right. 

I drove for ten minutes taking the main road out of town. No matter how far I went, I ended up back on her street. Same turn, same faded stop sign, same crooked mailbox. The signal on my phone always dropped to zero bars, GPS stopped working. The time on my dashboard glitched, frozen at 3:13.

I even tried walking, but the path kept looping. My footsteps kept syncing up with another set that didn’t belong to me, one step behind, slower, wet.

I came back to grab my things but the house was empty.

Lynn was gone, no trace, as if no one ever lived here.

Except for the mirror, still bolted to the wall.
But now, it’s different.

There’s no reflection anymore. Just an empty room, until you look long enough.

You will start to see her, the woman in the mirror.

She stands too still. Her skin is gray like rot. Her hair hangs like drowned weeds. When you blink, she’s closer. Sometimes her hands twitch, Sometimes the crack grows. 

Last night, for the first time, she spoke. I didn’t hear it out loud, I heard it inside my head, like a whisper made of nails dragging down glass.

”You looked too long”
”Now I see you” 

I left, renting a motel an hour away. Different mirror. New place.

I haven’t slept, because the mirror here…it’s not mine.

Tonight at 3:13AM, I saw a crack running down the glass.

And a fingerprint.

From the inside.

If you’re reading this, don’t look too long. Don’t cover your mirror. Don’t blink, and if your reflection ever moves before you,

You’re not alone anymore.
