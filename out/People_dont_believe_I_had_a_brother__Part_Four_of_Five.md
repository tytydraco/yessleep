[ Part Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jc634l/people_dont_believe_i_had_a_brother_part_three/)

\*\*\*\*

“Good morning, Stephen.  I’m Dr. Smalls.”  She was true to her name—a diminutive, older woman who had to hop slightly to get settled into the chair opposite me.  This was some kind of interview or therapy room in the hospital, slightly less cold and clinical than some parts I’d seen, but in an artificial way that was no more inviting or comfortable.  A soothing sea of pastel blue walls surrounded a reinforced door on one side and a small red panic button on the other.  The doctor sat watching me expectantly and I felt a flicker of irritation that I forced back down.  I’d made the mistake of telling the truth to the psychiatrist, and that had landed me in here.  Now it was time to stick to the plan and get back out.  Calm, reasonable, cooperative and full of bullshit.

 

“Hey, Dr. Smalls.  It’s good to meet you.”

 

She gave me a smiling nod and jotted something down.  “So, I see you got checked in yesterday afternoon for observation.  A therapist you were seeing had some concerns about some things you said.  Is that right?”

 

I felt my jaw flex slightly as I returned her nod, and I forced a small laugh to cover it.  “Yeah, I feel embarrassed about that.  I don’t blame him for getting a bit freaked out, and I should have been more honest with him.”

 

She raised an eyebrow.  “You weren’t being honest?”

 

Trying to look sheepish, I lowered my gaze and gave a small shrug.  “In part I was, but…the things I was telling him…the bizarre stuff where my parents turned into monsters and killed and ate my brother?  Obviously that didn’t really happen.  But it was a very real dream I had.”  I glanced up and she was paying close attention, so I went on.  “Growing up…well, I’m still not very comfortable talking about it, but our parents were very abusive to my brother Mark and me.  Very abusive.  We made it through it, thank God, but I still have a lot of guilt and anger and anxiety about it all.”

 

Dr. Smalls frowned slightly.  “I see.  Well, I’m very sorry to hear that, Stephen.  That must have been very hard to go through.  For you both to go through.”

 

To my surprise, I felt real tears coming to my eyes.  “It was a lot worse for Mark.  And he was younger.  The baby.  I was supposed to protect him, and I feel like I failed him.”

 

She jotted something else down.  “So does Mark still have problems from all of this too?” 

 

Swallowing, I forced myself to take a deep breath as I pushed away thoughts of him staring at me as the thing that had been our mother consumed him.  “Um, yeah.  I’m sure he does.  But we don’t talk about it much.”  This next part was important, so I forced myself to focus and believe the lie as I said it.  She needed to believe me on all of it, and especially this.  “But back about six or seven months ago he started talking about going around them again.  Missing them or something.”  I shook my head.  “I was against it, of course.  I remember more of how they were, and people like that don’t change.”

 

Dr. Smalls made a small grunting noise of affirmation and gestured for me to go on.

 

“After he went a few times, I stopped hearing from him.  I haven’t heard from him since, which is really unusual.  We’re really close.”  I sniffed back more tears.  “He’s my best friend.”  Rubbing my eyes, I slumped back in the chair.  The lies felt hot and dirty on my tongue, like vomit I needed to spew out before it made me sicker.  “It brought back the anxiety really bad.  I started wondering if they had turned him against me, or worse, if they had maybe done something to him.  I started having strange, terrible dreams.”  I looked up and met her eyes.  “Including a version of the one I told my therapist.  I had to let it out, and it seemed easier telling that than the truth.”

 

The doctor let out a small sigh.  “I understand, Stephen.  There’s no one way to handle pain and trauma like that.  I'm so sorry you’ve gone through all that.”  She glanced back down at her pad and then back up at me.  “It’s very understandable why you refused to see your parents’ this afternoon.  They’ve been notified, and while they may still stop by to ask questions, please know that everything going on in your case is confidential and you will not have to have contact with them.”

 

I sucked in a relieved lungful of air.  “Thank you, doctor.  That means a lot. And…I’m sorry for the trouble I’ve caused.”

 

She waved away my words.  “Not at all.  That’s what we’re here for.”

 

“So when can I get back out?  I have responsibilities at work, and…”  I hooked my thumb at the panic button on the wall,  “Well, being here is kind of nerve-wracking.”

 

Dr. Smalls glanced at the button and then smiled at me.  “I understand.  We try to make it comfortable, but it’s still intimidating at first.  And don’t take the button personally.  All of the interview and meeting rooms have them, just in case.”  Glancing back down at her notes, she tapped the paper with her pen.  “Unfortunately, we have to keep you for the full 72 hours—there are some cases—like yours—where I’d be inclined to release you early, but the hospital asks us to do the full observation once ordered for liability reasons.  So that puts you getting out around…4pm day after tomorrow.”

 

I grimaced.  “No way of getting out before then?”

 

She shook her head.  “I’m afraid not.  But it won’t be bad.  You’re welcome to stay in your room or go out into the public activity areas during the day and early evening hours.  And I’ll come talk to you again before you go home.  Unless you have more you’d like to tell me now, of course.”

 

Giving her a smile I didn’t feel, I nodded.  “No, but I appreciate it.  Glad to come clean about what was really going on too.”

 

The doctor hopped out of the chair and patted my arm as she passed by.  “Sometimes confession really is good for the soul.”

 

\*\*\*\*

 

That evening was quiet.  I stayed in my room, and while I hated being confined, the idea of a barrier between me and my parents was a huge relief.  I’d spent hours trying to think of what to do once I got out, but was no closer to any real answer.

 

What if they were just waiting outside the hospital, waiting to scoop me up?  Or maybe not.  They could just as easily get when I got back home.  Other than running—like truly running away and abandoning my life and identity—what hope did I have of actually stopping them?  But then again, what choice did I have?

 

I didn’t sleep well that night, and was still fitfully dozing mid-morning when Dr. Smalls opened my door and stepped inside.  Her cheerful demeanor from the day before was gone, replaced with a concerned frown.  She asked if she could come in and speak with me, and sitting up on the edge of my bed, I told her sure.  

 

Rubbing a hand through my hair, I offered her an uncertain smile.  “Is something wrong?”

 

Sitting in a guest chair on the other side of the room, she cleared her throat as she gave a small nod.  “It seems that way, yes, though maybe it’s just a misunderstanding.”

 

I frowned.  “Misunderstanding about what?”

 

“Well, you told me and everyone else about your younger brother, Mark, correct?”

 

“Um, yeah.  Of course I did.”

 

“And you actually spent a great deal of your time with your therapist talking about Mark as well?”

 

“Look, what is this…”

 

She raised a hand.  “Please, just answer me.”

 

Letting out a breath, I nodded.  “Yes.  I’ve talked about Mark a lot.”

 

“Mark, your biological brother, who you grew up with and is your best friend?”

 

I felt myself starting to get irritated and pushed it back down.  “Yes, that’s the one.”

 

Dr. Smalls nodded.  “Sorry, I just wanted to make sure I was clear.”  Smoothing her pants leg, she kept her tone measured as she continued.  “Stephen, I did not meet your parents yesterday.  But I did review some notes put into the system from the front desk when they arrived.  They apparently said that you have delusions and they’d like to see you transferred to a facility closer to their home.”  When I started to protest she raised her hand again.  “Don’t worry, unless something changes, you are still getting out at 72 hours, and they don’t decide such things.  If that was all that had been said, I’d have thought they were just trying to get access to you or delegitimize any accounts of abuse you might be sharing.  But then they told the woman working the front desk something else.”

 

I stared at her.  “What?”

 

Dr. Smalls looked up at me again.  “That you don’t have a brother, Mark or otherwise.  That you never have.”

 

“What the fuck are you talking about?”

 

She shook her head.  “Not me.  Them.  Again, I put very little stock in a stranger’s word, especially with what you told me yesterday about them.  So I spent a couple of hours this morning trying to prove they were lying.  Your psychiatrist took detailed notes from your sessions, and you have spent a great deal of time talking about Mark.  Where he lived, where he went to school, all kinds of past and present details that should be verifiable.”

 

I smiled.  “Good.  Thank God.  Thank you so much for taking the…”

 

Dr. Smalls gave another small shake of her head, her eyes sad.  “Stephen, I can’t find any trace of him.”

 

My tongue began to shrivel in my mouth.  “That…that’s not possible.”

 

“Was your brother born in the same county as you?”

 

I nodded.  “Um, yeah.  He was.”

 

She returned my nod.  “I guessed that might be the case.  I can find your birth certificate, not his.  I contacted his college.  I had to push a bit, but I got them to check enrollment going back four years.  No sign of him there.  Our auxiliary office has access to a people search database.  They use it to find relatives of patients and early debt-collection mainly, but it is surprisingly thorough.  It can find most people if they’ve ever held a job, rented an apartment or been in school.  Not just them, but other people they’re connected or related to.  I asked them to run Mark an hour ago.  And what do you think they found?”  She let out a sigh.  “No sign of him at all.”

 

My mind was going in a hundred directions as she spoke.  “Was she in on this?  Or being controlled, maybe?  Anything was possible, but I didn’t feel the sense of wrongness that my parents gave off.  It seemed like she was being honest, and was honestly concerned that I was lying or crazy.  So what, did they wipe his records or something?  I didn’t see how that was possible, but how could I rule it out with everything I’d seen?  If only…

 

“Dana.”

 

Dr. Small stopped and frowned at me.  “Who?”

 

I waved my hand.  “It’s…okay, so growing up, when Mark was in junior high, everybody was getting girlfriends and boyfriends.  It was like a thing, okay?  So him and this girl in his class, Dana, started “dating”, which really just meant they hung out awkwardly during breaks and after school a bit.  Then some of his friends started making fun of them, so he ghosted her.  Avoided her for like two months.  I didn’t even know most of it was going on until I came home from college one weekend and saw this sad girl sitting outside our house.

 

“She told me that her name was Dana and she’d been hanging out with Mark for awhile, but then he stopped talking to her.  That it was okay if he didn’t want to go steady or whatever, but she really wanted to still be his friend and hang out, if that was okay with him.  It could have come off as weird or something, but she was nice about it, not creepy.  He was just being a jerk and not listening to her.”  I gave a sad laugh.  “It was about the only time I was ever disappointed in him.  So I took her number.  Memorized it and promised he would call and give her a chance to clear the air and let them start being friends again.”  I shrugged.  “I did, and he did.  Ever since she’s been one of his closest friends.” 

 

Dr. Smalls stared at me for a moment and then pulled out her cell phone.  “Do you still remember the number?”

 

I nodded.  “I do.”

 

\*\*\*\*

 

“Hello, is this Dana?  Hi, Dana.  This may sound strange, but I’m actually calling you to verify some information.  My name is Dr. Smalls and I have a young man who is a patient of mine named Stephen who remembers you.  More importantly, he says his brother Mark is one of your closest friends since junior high.  I think you two even called yourselves dating for a bit back then.”

 

I can see Dr. Smalls face droop and then harden as she listens to the woman on the other end of the line.  “I see.  And you are certain?  I see.  Well, thank you very much for your time.”  When she ended the call, I already knew what she had heard.

 

“She doesn’t remember him at all, does she?”

 

Smalls shook her head.  “She does not.  She says the only Marks she knows is her cousin in New York and the landlord for her building.”  Her tone grew cooler.  “And she did not appear to be lying.”

 

I nodded bleakly.  “Okay.  Um, I don’t…I don’t know then.  Maybe I can think of some other way to prove it, but if they can erase him from Dana’s mind, why is the next thing going to work?  I just…”  I felt myself growing close to tears.  “They just keep taking him.”

 

Dr. Smalls leaned forward, her expression sympathetic.  “Stephen, just because your involuntary committal will likely be up tomorrow afternoon…that doesn’t mean you can’t stay voluntarily.  You seem like a great guy who is having a really hard time, and we’d be happy to help you through it.”

 

Staring at her, I felt like I was teetering on the edge between giving in or screaming at her.  Instead, I just shook my head.  “I’m…I’m just tired.  Sorry I wasted your time.”

 

She nodded.  “I’ll let you get some rest.  And if you want to talk again, I’ll be around this afternoon.”

 

\*\*\*\*

 

I spent the next few hours turning everything over in my head.  I wasn’t crazy.  I didn’t believe that.  I hadn’t invented a whole life in my head where everything was the same, even Dana’s number, but with a fake brother plugged into it.  But arguing things like that wouldn’t convince anyone of anything, because my parents, or whatever they were, had eaten Mark and erased him from the world.

 

And they wanted to do the same to me.

 

I suddenly sat up in bed, wiping at my cheeks as I got up and went to the door.  Outside I saw Gertie trundling along with the first of the lunch carts.  “Gertie!  Miss Gertie!”

 

She looked up with an affable smile.  “Yes?  Do you need something?”

 

I nodded, heart hammering in my chest as I returned her smile.  “I do, if you don’t mind.  Can you get Dr. Smalls a message for me?”

 

She frowned and then gave a nod.  “Sure, young man.  What is it?”

 

“Tell her I’ve changed my mind.  If she can get them here in the morning, I’d really like for my parents to come for a [visit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Verastahl/).”
