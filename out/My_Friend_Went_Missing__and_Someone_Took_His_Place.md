Look, I know this is going to sound crazy. Absolutely fucking crazy. Even as I write this out, the words in front of my eyes read as crazy. I still can’t believe this. But I have to get it out.

My parents don’t believe me. I had to stop bringing this up because I heard them whispering a few weeks ago that they were “worried about my mental health”. I think they wanted to send me away for “help”, so I stopped talking about it to them. My friends think it’s a joke. And the police are basically on my parents side thinking I need help.
But I swear to you – this is real.

~~~

It started with a simple night out. The two of us and our group of friends went to a shitty little dive bar that sits at the edge of town. The bartender there doesn’t care all that much about fake IDs, letting us weasel ourselves in to enjoy our night. Just a couple drinks and enjoy some music from the classic old jukebox, that was the plan.

Everything was fine.

We were having so much fun. Drinks around the table, dancing to the music. Laughing and singing (although we didn’t really know the words, but hey – when you’re starting to have a blurred vision, matching words to lyrics don’t exactly matter at that point).

Evan smokes and while a couple of our mutual friends do as well, he took his smoke break at a different time. The others weren’t ready, they were enjoying a song, swaying in their seats and chattering loudly. It was cold that night and I didn’t exactly feel like standing outside while he took a good ole’ fifteen to twenty minutes to smoke. So Evan went outside alone.

There was so many people in the bar. In and out. There were groups outside, blabbering loudly. One even got in a fight with each other – over what, I don’t know and I don’t care. A drunken mess is what I’m sure of. But there were so many eyes, so many people.

And yet – Evan still disappeared. No one could say they saw him step out the door. No one could say they saw him step into the door. Apparently I’m the only one who had seen him leave the bar.

Everyone admits that Evan had obviously left, because he wasn’t seen after that.

For an entire fucking week.

I loved Evan. He was my best friend. We told each other everything.

I met Evan in Kindergarten. I was the shy new girl, having just moved to town in the middle of the year. All the other kids had their best friends who they played with and shared secrets with. Evan walked right up to me and shared his juice box to make sure I felt welcomed and from then, we were attached at the hips. Our mother’s used to joke with each other that we’d end up married one day. Joke was on them, because in high school when I got my first girlfriend it was only because Evan pushed me to ask her out, knowing exactly what I wanted before even I really did.

It was miserable without Evan around. I would look around every corner, check my phone every five minutes to see if he had texted or I missed his call by accident. I even found myself multiple times going to the clubhouse we built in the woods behind town. Our own little secret place. We built it the summer before sixth grade and promised that we would never tell anyone else that it existed.

That alone is why I’m here. Yes, I’m telling you about the clubouse, but it doesn’t matter anymore.
Like I said – Evan was gone for an entire fucking week.

I don’t know where he went, what he did, or who he was with. He won’t tell me shit still. I still check my phone for texts and missed calls, because when he returned it’s like our friendship has never existed. At least, not to the extent that it has for all these years.
He showed back up in the same shirt he had been at the bar in. It reeked of beer and body odor, as if the entire week he was gone he hadn’t showered. His arm had been cut and bandaged, but he wouldn’t tell me what happened.

Evan and I always shared everything. But now he’s not sharing anything.

That’s not Evan. Not the one I know anyway.
I know it sounds crazy. And you’re probably thinking he ended up drunk off his ass in a ditch somewhere or holed up at some chic’s apartment or whatever and just doesn’t want to tell me, but I don’t think so. This is what I believe in my heart.

When we were kids, Evan and I would meet on holiday break nights at the abandoned playground on the other side of town. No one ever knew we met there under the guise of the moon. We played on the old teeter-totter and swung in the old swings.
The playground still sits there. The metal of the swing set and the teeter-totter, and the slide are slowly rotting. I’ve been going there at night lately, unable to stop myself, trying to relive those memories.

I texted Evan the second day he was back. Want to meet at eleven tonight? The old hangout?

He answered, where is that again?

We started going to that playground when we were in fourth grade. Evan’s big brother showed it to us one night and told us that only the “cool kids” knew about it. We felt so special learning about it. It was our little secret.

I never gave Evan an answer about that. We spent nine years going to that playground in the night. How could he just… forget about it? How could he not know what I meant?

We never go to the clubhouse at night. I’d never ask for that. The woods are dangerous here at night, you see. But that’s a different story for a different time.

Evan didn’t know where our hangout was for eleven at night? That isn’t right. That’s not a thing with Evan. Evan has never forgotten where we hang out or meet up. Evan is the punctual one. He’s the one who remembers all our birthdays and makes sure I take a bottle of water with me to work every day just so I don’t hydrate by drinking coffee only. He’s the one who keeps everything straight, not me. I can barely even function to get to work at six in the morning Monday through Friday for fuck’s sake. Evan though is like a goddamn superhero. Always up by four in the morning, doing his routine and out the door by five forty-five.

Well, he was a superhero anyway.

He sleeps until noon now and it up all hours of the night doing god knows what. We’re roommates – did I mention that? So I hear him every night, walking around, talking to himself. Talking to himself. Evan doesn’t talk to himself. He never did.

Last night I left my room to see what he was doing. There was just so much noise going on. Dishes clattering, a couple shattering, and the nonstop walking. Its like he’s restless now. He won’t sit still for more than five minutes at a time, always getting up and moving around the apartment. Or just about anywhere we go or are.

Like yesterday for example, when we went to visit his parents, he did not once sit down. Just kept walking around the house. I peeked a few times and caught him studying the family photos, a lot of which I’m in (and he vice versa with my families photos). It was like he didn’t remember them. He even asked his mother about a beach trip we all took mine and Evan’s junior year of highschool. Just said he that for whatever reason, he convinced himself the picture had been different. Then he laughed about it.

This clipped sort of sound. His laugh was short, like it was forced and his smile most definitely didn’t reach his eyes. I can’t believe I actually wrote that though. I always thought it was a book thing, saying that smiles “don’t reach the eyes”. But it actually happened. When Evan smiles or laughs, the corners of his mouth curves upward but his eyes are blank, void of all emotion. Its so unnerving. The twinkle that used to sparkle in those blue eyes doesn’t exist anymore.

His mother was confused for a moment when Evan asked that question. But I think she’s just happy to have her son back, because she was smiling a moment later as if just brushing it off and deciding it didn’t matter. Maybe it was a momentary lapse in memory, I think she had decided. Of course she would. Evan’s mom is one of the sweetest women I’ve ever met. And Evan is her baby. Of course she wouldn’t want to even begin to think about something else being wrong with him. In her mind, she almost lost him. He came back. That should be enough, especially for a mother.

But I know. Oh, I know.

I know in the way that Evan no longer adds emojis to his texts. I know in the way that he sits at the table, staring at his food and claims to have eaten earlier in the day, but I know better as I’m with him most of the time and he doesn’t eat other hours of the day either. I know in the way that sometimes in the very early hours of morning when I get up to take a piss, Evan is just sitting there staring at the tv. Staring, not watching. Because these early hours he usually has the tv off, just a black screen with his reflection staring back at him. And me behind him.

In those instances I catch his reflection staring back, his eyes are darker than ever before and he never smiles. He just stared, unblinking.

I tried to bring it up one more, pretending it was some weird thing in passing. But Evan only looked at me in question and then laughed that short, choppy laugh that doesn’t belong to him.

His laugh is deep and throaty and makes my chest sort of hurt when he laughs because of how contagious it is. This new laugh of his though? It makes me sad instead of wanting to smile or laugh. And that makes me even sadder. I miss Evan’s laugh the most of everything else.

Nobody believes me. I tell them what I’ve noticed and they all laugh or shrug it off, rolling their eyes.
I tell them about the odd texts and the way Evan just doesn’t remember things and his laugh too. I try to tell them anyway, but nobody believes me.
I went to the police again when Evan was gone for another twenty-four hours. But it wasn’t long enough and he came back before – why would he stay gone again?

He was sitting in front of the television turned off when I got up in the middle of the night again the next night. Scared the hell out of me and I quite literally pissed my pants because of him. He didn’t even blink, let alone look at me. He didn’t say a damn thing to me.

When I asked him about it the next morning, he acted like I was the crazy one.

Then he told me: “I wasn’t gone, Dollie.”

He wasn’t gone? Yes he was! I’m not a fucking idiot. I didn’t imagine that shit. I know damn well I didn’t. So I pressed about the entire week he was gone. I got the same response; “I wasn’t gone, Dollie.”
He wasn’t gone? How the fuck was he not gone?
When we went to my mother’s for dinner that night, I brought it up at dinner. She was as confused as I was, but for a much different reason. Mom didn’t know what I was talking about. Said Evan had never been gone.

I brought up the whole week he was gone and when I reminded her when it had happened, she reprimanded me for talking so poorly about well – Evan’s misfortunes.

His… misfortunes. What misfortunes? Mom got mad when I questioned it.

Evan has been acting even weirder around me since that dinner. I catch him staring a lot. When he realizes that I’ve caught him, he looks away so quickly and goes about his business. He doesn’t blink. I swear he doesn’t fucking blink. I never see him blink. I’m sure you’re just going to say that I don’t catch it. But I know what I see and what I don’t see.

He just stares.

I keep asking about that week and those twenty-four hours, but Evan won’t tell me. He ignores me or just up and leaves when I bring it up.

It’s killing me he’s keeping secrets from me. Whatever this is, I’m sure I can handle it. As long as it means that my best friend comes back to me, I can handle whatever.

I tried telling him that too. Begged him to understand that whatever it is that’s going on, I can help him. I want to help him so badly. But he won’t tell me. He won’t accept my help. That’s not my Evan. My Evan would accept my help. I know he would.

That little boy who approached the shy little girl would never diss help offered.

I asked him this morning if he’d like to go to the clubhouse.

He asked me where it was. I’m not entirely sure he was paying full attention to me when I asked because a moment after he looked at me sharply and then stammered – fucking stammered (Evan doesn’t stammer) that he’s too buy today. Too busy? No, I get that, I really do. But its like he’s starting to realize that I’ve been picking at the things that Evan should know. And whoever – whatever – this is that is playing the role of Evan has now decided to to jump hoops in order to avoid having to admit he doesn’t know a damn thing about my best friend.

But I know better.

I know better.

I waited until Evan left earlier. I pretended to drop the topic when he said he was too busy and planted my butt on the couch, watching some mindless sitcom that was on tv. I wasn’t really interested in it, just waited for Evan to leave. Because if he was so damn busy, then he’d have to leave if I wasn’t. Just to make sure that I couldn’t start asking him to go somewhere he didn’t know with me.

It worked.

After he was gone, I snuck into his room. I had to know, find something so people would believe me. So that way no one would think I was crazy and want to send me away. I needed something to make people listen. To make the fucking police listen.
You have to understand I wasn’t trying to be a snoop. I’m an only child. Evan is the brother I never got. He is everything to me. I’d do anything for him.

And… well… I did. I did do anything for him.
The clubhouse is more then just a place we go to hangout. We didn’t just build it in the woods randomly on a whim. My backyard has a couple giant trees we could’ve built it in so easily. Our parents remind us of that all the time. They like to joke we were being rebellious when we chose to put it in the woods, away from all prying eyes. (They know we built one, but have never been able to find it.)

We built it to keep our biggest secret.
There are three things only Evan and I know about.

1) The playground
2) The clubhouse
3) The girl I killed in high school

She’s buried at the base of the tree the clubhouse is built on. We take flowers every time we visit, every time we go to the clubhouse.

Well, we did.

I realized that one week it’s going to get hard putting flowers on two graves that are miles apart from now on. Maybe just different days I suppose.
I didn’t mean to. I truly didn’t. It just… it just happened.

He reminded me.

Because in his room… it was just so very different. He’s taken the bed out. In its place is a pile of dirt. Literal fucking dirt. I think he sleeps on it or something, I don’t fucking know. But there’s no bed so where else does he sleep?

He changed his curtains to black out ones, not even an ounce of sun can get through them, shut tight against the world as if desperate to ensure to block it all out. And it… reeks.

I know the stench too well.

Smoldering in the dark is the rancid smell of death.
I know for sure it isn’t Evan now.

Because when I left his room, I left the apartment and came to the playground. I’ve never been here in the daytime before. I can see the rust eating through the metal. One of the swings dangles by one chain by now. The seesaw sits untouched, grass rising above it, nearly hiding it. But beneath the slide the mound of dirt is there.

Except… it’s disturbed. Opened up like someone crawled up from beneath.

But I know I left him beneath there.

I didn’t mean to. You have to believe me. He’s my best friend, my brother. I just got so angry. I don’t even really remember why – I was drunk. But I was angry and I smashed the bottle over his head.

I didn’t mean to.

Evan would understand. He’s always understood me. He’s the only one who ever has.

But I don’t think this thing wearing his face will understand very well.

I know because he’s staring at me right now from across the playground. In that unblinking, unmoving way that he does.
