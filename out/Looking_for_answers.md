Day 1

I am at a loss. Maybe if I could sleep, things would be clearer. Hopefully sharing this will help clear my mind. 


Three weeks ago, almost to the day, my wife went missing. As an aspiring author, she tends to take long excursions to find a muse. Normally she’s gone for a couple of hours, but when she didn’t come back that night I got worried. The next morning I called local PD and the craziness began.
Aside from the normal questions (friends, family, favorite local places, is this out of the ordinary, etc.), they seemed to focus on my involvement. After all, Law and Order taught us all that it’s always the husband. I can’t say I blame them, we weren’t perfect. Occasionally we would argue, but what couple doesn’t. When they were particularly aggressive, she would go for a walk to calm down. She felt at home in nature and I would hide in the shop. I guess the hammers and saws didn’t make me look any less suspicious. I helped the officers look through her personal effects like her closet and laptop. Her phone was gone but everything she did was synced to her cloud. 


I knew that she liked to jot down her thoughts in audio logs, but PD seemed to ignore them. There are so many from her years of writing. The days before she disappeared seem to be especially frequent. An initial listen seems that she thought this was her masterpiece. She thinks this’ll finally get her published and all of our money issues will be gone. I feel guilty but I always had the same hope. I told her that I would do everything I could to support her, but there are only so many hours I can clock in a week. 


After word got out, my boss put me on indefinite leave with a heavy suggestion to see someone. I’ve never been one for therapy, but maybe getting to talk someone will be good. I’ve heard that journaling can help with anxiety so I thought I would start this and hopefully I can at least placebo myself better. We’ll see what the therapist says. 



Day 4
I met with the therapist yesterday, dude was a quack. Maybe that’s my upbringing but therapy is for the crazies that didn’t love their mothers, or maybe loved them too much. He did tell me that the journaling was a good idea, so I guess you’re stuck with me. Still no word. The police keep telling me to keep my spirits up, but everyone knows the first 48 exists for a reason. No signs, no weird card charges, nothing. The nights are the hardest. Man wasn’t made to go from having someone next to them forever to an empty bed overnight. I’ve started playing her audio logs to fill the void. It’s nice to hear her voice and the way her mind works. I’ve never seen this side of her, she always said I never paid enough attention to her. Now that she’s gone, all I can think is how nice it would be to hear her ramble about her newest story. 


I had never noticed, how good she was at coming up with ideas. I always knew she liked mythology and fantasy but never had the time to read anymore into it. Or maybe I didn’t want to make the time. The way she describes it all makes it feel so real. I could almost believe that the smoky mountains we called home were the Irish forest full of fairies and elves.
