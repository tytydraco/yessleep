The northwoods winters have always been quiet. The wide stretches of pines and hemlocks combined with a couple feet of snow meant that almost no sound traveled through the air. Still, even in the dead of winter, some sounds could always be made out. The wind whistling through the trees, the scuffling of creatures who had not gone to sleep for the winter, the occasional howl from a distant wolf, all sounds that could be picked out amongst the silence. Somehow there was always some sort of noise. Yet, the forests of my land made none. 



The silence is somehow more deafening than any bustling city or crowded suburb. I find myself straining my ears, desperate for noise… but there is none. Only silence.



Nothing dares to make a peep while the fawns are stalking.  



I live alone in a cabin in the northwoods of Wisconsin. Just a small wooden cabin with ten acres of wilderness surrounding it, untouched for generations. This land has been in my family since my great great grandparents immigrated here from Germany. It has never been logged or altered in any way, as my family preferred to use it for game hunting. The pelts and furs of the various wildlife species that roamed our property kept my family alive for two centuries. 



To this day, it is still used for that same purpose. Ducks, rabbits, pheasants, and quail all end up on my table every year. However, the deer on my property are the best of the bunch. My land produced some of the biggest bucks and does this side of the Mississippi. I sell the meat to local restaurants and the pelts and antlers online. I also keep chickens and have a small vegetable garden whose products I sell at the farmers market during the warmer months. I have made a good life for myself up here… but that life is no more. 



It started off small a couple years back. I noticed a lot of the deer I spotted on my property starting to look a little sickly. They were skinny and often seemed disoriented. Sometimes they would just wander in circles in forest clearings, wheezing in distress. Even weirder, I began finding a lot of the deer in the lake.  



I couldn’t understand it at first. What could possibly be dragging them into the lake and drowning them? No big aquatic predators existed like that this far north. No way in hell. 



It wasn’t until I personally witnessed a buck walk straight into the lake and drown itself that the mystery was finally solved.



The final straw came when the hunting season came around. I was sitting up in my stand one morning and watched as a doe stumbled out into the clearing. I raised my bow and took aim, but stopped before I fired. 



God, she looked just awful. She was practically a walking skeleton. There wasn’t a single ounce of fat on her whole body. She was foaming at the mouth and barely able to stand, her knees wobbling beneath her. Looking at her then, I bet a slight breeze could have knocked her to her side. I was so distracted by her grotesque form that it took me a while to realize that…



She was looking right at me. 



She stared straight at the tip of the arrow I was pointing at her heart, and did nothing. It's almost as if she couldn’t register that she was in danger. 



Or, she just didn’t care. 



We stayed like that for a while. Just staring at each other. Eventually, I lowered my bow. I couldn’t bring myself to shoot her, she was just too pitiful. Looking into her eyes, I could have sworn I saw disappointment cross her gaze. There were a couple more moments of silence between us before she suddenly dropped to the ground.



She was dead. 



It was at this point I knew I needed to call someone to help me figure this out. I normally hate having other people on my property, let alone the government, but I had no choice. I called the DNR and they sent someone to take some samples of the doe. 



If you are familiar with deer, then you may have recognized the signs of the now well known chronic wasting disease, or CWD. 



Chronic wasting disease is a contagious, always-fatal brain disease affecting animals in the cervid family. CWD is a prion disease, meaning that bacteria and viruses play no role in the infection. Prions are proteins and healthy prions are found lining the cells of healthy animals and humans. However, a disease like CWD causes those prions to warp. It starts off with just one prion, but it slowly spreads throughout the entirety of the cervids body over time. Sometimes, it can take over two years for the disease to finally kill off the deer. In the meantime, they will be afflicted with symptoms such as emaciation, excessive salivation, lack of muscle coordination, difficulty in swallowing, excessive thirst, and excessive urination.



The excessive thirst drives them to water, but they often struggle to drink. They will dunk their entire head into rivers or ponds because it is the only way they can get any water into their mouths. This often results in them accidentally drowning themselves, hence why I found so many drowned deer in my lake. 



These prions can be spread by 1v1 contact or be transmitted into the environment—such as soil, food, and water—through feces, urine, and other bodily fluids of an unhealthy deer. CWD can spread to deer if they ingest these unhealthy CWD prions from their environment. These prions can live in the environment for years at a time. This makes managing the disease incredibly difficult, if not near impossible. 



Once it has spread, there is no going back. 



I was given the go ahead by the DNR to kill any infected deer on my property on sight, whether it was during hunting season or not. I tried my best to rid my land of the infection, but it was no use. Things only seemed to get worse. 



A couple years passed and it looked like my land was almost barren of deer. The last season I had was pitiful. The only thing I shot was one scrawny, diseased doe who’s meat or pelt would be no use to anyone. I was distraught, but there was nothing I could do. 



The infection had won. 



I had just about given up ever having healthy deer on my property. That was… until spring came. 



The snow had just started melting outside. The birds were beginning to arrive in droves from their vacation south and lit up the forest with their song. I was happy that the long winter had finally ended, but I couldn’t help but feel down. 



Usually, my land was alive with the arrival of new fawns at this time. Big healthy does would wander my property, trailing one or two beautiful baby fawns with them. The promise of the next generation soothed something in my heart. If I saw fawns, it meant my land was fertile and my livelihood would continue. 



That contentment had not entered my heart in some years. 



As I gazed depressingly out my window, something caught my eye. A doe. She was scrawny and exhausted looking, much like all the other deer I had seen these past years, but behind her trailed… a surprise. 



A big, beautiful baby fawn followed her. It seemed perfectly healthy. It was plump, clean, and happy as could be. It trotted happily after its mom, not seeming in the slightest bit bothered by her deteriorating state. 



I couldn’t believe it. 



How is this possible? I had not had healthy fawns in years. On the rare chance a fawn was born, it would always die before summer's end. Either taken by disease or starved because their mother died before they could be weaned. 



At the time, I figured that the fawn would only remain healthy for a little while. Eventually, the ruin of my land would take its life too. Except… it didn’t. Not only that, but it wasn’t the only healthy fawn to be found. 



By the time the summer ended, I had at least a dozen happy, healthy fawns. All of which were led by a scrawny, diseased doe who looks at those she was seconds away from her painful end. 



I couldn't understand it. How were they so healthy? It should be impossible. Their mothers certainly couldn’t be producing enough milk to sustain them. Even if they could, the milk would be diseased, The fawns should be infected by this point and starting their decline. 



Yet, they weren’t. 



At the time this made me happy. I disregarded any nagging concern with halfhearted excuses. Maybe the mothers weren’t as sick as I thought, or maybe the fawns were immune to the disease somehow. If I had been paying closer attention, maybe I would have seen the signs sooner. 



The first time I sensed something may have been off with the fawns was around the time hunting season came around. Last year my hunt was pitiful, as previously mentioned. This year though, I had the slightest glimmer of hope that I may be able to kill something worthwhile. 



I never even made it to my stand though, as I was stopped in my tracks by a grisly discovery. Well, stopped in my tracks might not be the best choice of words. I mean, I literally tripped over the damn thing.



While trekking to my stand in the dark of the morning, I tripped over a large, warm body. As I fell forward, my hands landed on something warm, fuzzy, and… wet. I yelped in surprise as I fell, getting up as quickly as possible once the fuzzy texture hit my hands. As I was trying to regain my footing, the most horrid stench hit my nose. It was so bad it almost caused me to stumble back to the ground again. I managed to keep my composure and took a couple steps back to get a look at the creature. 



Below me was one of the most grotesque sites I had ever seen. 



It was a doe. Not just a doe, but one of the does I saw with a fawn earlier in the year.

Daisy.

I recognized her by a distinct notch in her ear that none of the other deer on my property had. She was dead, as to be expected. However, the manner in which it died was of major question. The poor thing was eviscerated. It was gutted from tip to tail, its organs spilled out and rotting all over the ground. Small chunks of its flesh were missing all over its body. Looking closer, it was obvious that the flesh was ripped away with sharp teeth. Obviously something had been eating it. The does eyes were missing as well, cleanly scooped out leaving only hollow black holes. 



Usually this wouldn’t be of much concern, as there are wolves and coyotes in these parts. Both of which could easily take down a small, sickly deer. Plus, the missing eyes could have been pecked out by crows or other scavenging birds, who often like to go for the soft parts first. 



But something wasn’t right.



The cut that gutted the doe was too clean. No wolf or coyote could do that. Plus, when I examined the eyes more closely, I could not find any trace of the eyeball at all. Normally if birds peck out the eyes, at least some eye goop is left behind. Also, why was so much of the deer left behind? A predator would not leave all these organs uneaten to rot. As I looked closer, I could see that the liver remained there. It was rotted, completely useless now, but present.



That was very confusing. The liver is the prized organ of any kill, always one of the first things to be eaten. No competent predator would leave it untouched. Also, where were all the scavengers? It was getting quite late in the year, normally every opportunistic predator or omnivore in the area would be swarming this kill. 



Yet it remained mostly untouched, except for the missing chunks of flesh and the hollowed out eyes.



It was almost as if whatever killed this deer didn’t understand what it should be doing with it. It knew it wanted to kill, it knew it wanted to eat, but it didn’t know how to do it most efficiently or what parts were most nutritious. 



The more I looked at the doe, the more uneasy I felt. I had seen hundreds of dead animals before, but something about this one felt… off.



It felt like I was breaking some sort of unspoken rule coming near this kill. It felt like something I wasn’t supposed to see.



I didn’t go to my stand that morning. Instead, I returned home, too unnerved to continue my hunt. I made sure to take some pictures of the deer to have on record. The only other explanation I had for such a strange kill was a possible poacher. If someone was killing on my land without my knowledge, it is important that I keep a record of it. Yet, something inside me couldn’t buy that explanation, as much as I wanted too. 



Something just wasn’t right.



I spent the rest of that week worrying about the doe and what killed her. What worried me even more so though was the fact that her fawn was nowhere to be seen. Eventually, I worked up the courage to return to the site of the kill to search the area, looking for the fawn, but I never found it. Even more strange, the doe seemed to still be relatively untouched, if not a tad more decomposed. No scavengers dared to go near her, for reasons that were unclear to me then. 



The situation continued to worsen as winter settled over the land. I found more dead does. All of them killed in a very similar manner to the first. All of their fawns were missing as well, nowhere to be found.



Over time, the smell of rotting corpses began to be carried on the wind, desecrating the sanctity of my land further. I kept waiting for scavengers to come and clean the corpses out, but none ever did. For whatever reason, no creature on earth seemed to want to touch those does. 



The final straw was when I woke up one morning to find a dead doe right outside my window one morning. I could handle them when they were out of sight, but I couldn’t watch a deer corpse start to rot right outside my door. If the scavengers were not going to deal with this problem, then I would. 



I spent the whole day traveling around my property, picking up doe corpses and loading them into the back of my ATV. There was a large sinkhole located at the edge of my property. I dumped each corpse into the hole and filled it over with leftover dirt from my garden projects. Throughout the whole process, I felt a distinct feeling of wrongness. 



A horrible feeling hovered over me, as though every muscle and neuron in my body was screaming at me to stop. It felt as though I were doing something horribly wrong that would be paid for later in full. I couldn’t understand the feeling then, but I understand it now. 



Finally, I returned home and collapsed onto my couch, exhausted. My body ached horribly and my nerves were wracked beyond repair. I began to sob, all of the fear and the sorrow of the last couple years overtaking me in an instant. I cried like that for a long while, unable to pull myself together.



A million questions flooded my mind: What was killing my does? What happened to their fawns? Why was my land so devastated by this disease? What did I do to deserve this?



Eventually, the tears seemed to slow and the thoughts began to quiet. I was left with a feeling of numb emptiness. In that deadened state, I took idle notice that it had begun to snow outside. I checked the weather and was notified that a big blizzard was on the way. 



I guess I was in for a long night. 



I decided that a hot shower was in order, as I was still stained with deer blood from the day's events. Plus, maybe the hot water could wash off the remaining anxiety from the day. I tossed my clothes, as they were beyond saving, and jumped into the shower. I felt myself begin to relax as the hot water ran over my body and soaked into my skin. 



I took my sweet time in the shower, making sure to wash every inch of the diseased blood off me. It was only after I got out of the shower and was beginning to dry my hair that I became aware of a soft noise coming from outside. It sounded like an animal cry.



I threw on my robe and started to walk towards my front door. As I got closer to the door, the sound became clearer. It was bleating. Not only that… but it was the bleating of a…



No, that's not possible.



I quickly rushed to the door and threw it open to reveal…



A fawn. 



Holy shit, a fawn. 



I was overtaken with joy. One of the fawns survived! I couldn’t believe it, these little guys were resilient!



It stood silently in the snow, not moving at all. It stared at me with its round, curious eyes, examining me for a moment. As it stared at me, I stared right back. However, the more I looked at it… the more uneasy I felt.



It just… didn’t look right.



It was much larger than it was in the spring, but still not the size of a full grown deer. It retained its spots, marking its young age, but they were beginning to fade. Its legs and neck seemed to be disproportionately long compared to what they should be. It was very scrawny, its bones jutting out underneath its fur. Looking harder, faint patches of missing fur could be made out amongst the pelt. Dark strains matted the pelt as well, although the dark of night and thick snowfall made it difficult to determine what the stains were. 



As I continued to examine the fawn, more small bodies emerged from the shadows. I was taken aback. By the time they had all come into the light, there were about twelve in total. All of them looked similar to the first, gangly with missing patches of fur and dark stains covering various parts of their body. 



At first I felt sad. I assumed the disease must have gotten to them too and I was wrong about them being immune. But then…



The first of the fawns began to screech.



The sound was deafening, I screamed out in agony as I covered my ears. The other fawns began to join in and the noise became unbearable. I felt a wetness begin to cover my hands and I quickly retreated inside, unable to stand the sound any longer. I locked the door and looked down at my hands to see they were covered in blood. I ran to the mirror and checked my ears. As I suspected, they were bleeding heavily.



Those fucking things burst my eardrums. 



My head ached horribly and I couldn’t hear anything except ringing. I quickly scrambled to my closet and pulled out my rifle I used occasionally during deer season. I preferred to hunt with a bow, but nothing short of a firearm seemed appropriate at this moment. 



Through the ringing in my ears I heard a soft bleating outside the large a-frame window that covered the south side of my house. My heart dropped into my stomach. They weren’t done with me yet. 



I crept to the window to see all the fawns had migrated to the light. They also looked up at me, standing perfectly in unison with a sort of triangle like formation. The lead fawn, the one I saw first outside my door, stood closest to the window, at the tip of the triangle. 



It stepped forward, further into the light. I let out a small gasp, stepping back in shock, as I finally got to see the thing clearly for the first time. 



Its legs and neck were unproportionally long as previously mentioned, except now I could see that the disproportions were even worse. The missing patches of fur I couldn’t quite make out earlier were now clear as day. It was obvious that parts of the fawn were rotting, as chunks of its flesh were missing throughout its pelt, leaving maggot infested wounds in its place.



Its hooves were all wrong, malformed to create three razor sharp cutting tools that resembled wolf claws. Its bony appearance was worse in the light, as it became obvious that bones of its knees were actually protruding out from under its skin, creating sharp daggers. Blood trails stained the fur from which the bones broke the skin. If it hurt, the fawn showed no indication. 



It was then that I noticed the thing was baring its fangs.



Yes, fucking fangs. 



Its mouth was full of canine-like teeth, stained with the blood of whatever it had previously killed. Looking at its mouth, the images of the missing chunks of flesh from the does flashed through my mind. I began to feel sick to my stomach. 



I guess I know what was killing the does now. 



Its eyes had also rolled into the back of its head, the whites showing prominently in contrast to the blood that seeped from its eye sockets. 



Whatever the unholy creature that sat before me was, it was not a fawn. No, it was something else. Something warped either by the infection of its mother or the unholy workings of another world.



It took all my strength to not shoot through my window. I wanted to blow the things off just so I didn’t have to look at it any more. But I couldn’t risk allowing those things an opening into my house. There were twelve of them after all, and only one of me. 



I don’t think I could kill them fast enough.



I spent the entire night huddled in a corner of my house, silently sobbing while clutching my rifle. Through the pounding headache and the ringing, I could hear the sounds of screeching outside my walls. They were communicating, trying to find a way in. 



If I hadn’t locked up to prepare for the storm earlier in the night, I would probably be dead now.



But, luckily for me, the fawns failed in their mission. 



The morning came, bringing an end to the storm and the return of cell service. I called an ambulance, claiming I accidentally fired my gun while cleaning it and burst my eardrums. I don’t know why I lied. Maybe it was because I didn’t think they would believe me, or maybe I was in shock. 



Or maybe I was just being selfish in that I was terrified telling others meant they would destroy the land I have come to love so much. Even if it was nothing but an unholy graveyard now. 



Right before they loaded me into the ambulance though, I was greeted with the sight of a severed eyeless doe head sitting on my front porch. Looking closely, it was obvious the doe had a notch in her ear. Looks like Daisy had come back to haunt me again. 



The message was clear:



You tainted our kill. You are no longer welcome here. Leave. 



So that's what I did. The second I got out of the hospital I took an uber to the nearest airport and flew to South Carolina. 



I am staying with my sister now. I didn’t tell her what happened, just that I missed my family and needed a fresh start. I am trying to start my new life here now. The property up north remains untouched and unsold. I can only pray that whatever curse or disease brought those demons to my land stays within the confines of its borders. 



Maybe, just maybe, if they are left to their own devices… if their kills aren't desecrated by human hands…



This will also just turn out to be a bad dream.



If not… I suggest to all readers to maybe stay away from the northwoods for a little while. I don’t know how much longer they will be safe.
