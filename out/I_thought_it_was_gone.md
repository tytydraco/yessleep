The first time I encountered the creature was two years ago, only a couple of months after I had finished college.

It was a normal night like any other. I had just finished my shift at the grocery store and was getting ready to watch a movie and relax. I was making popcorn and heard a strange sound. The sound was similar to a cat scratching on a wooden door. The noise was faint and stopped after a few seconds. I had thought nothing of it and assumed it was just an animal outside or a tree scraping against a window. The night continued as normal but something strange happened after I went to bed. I was laying down scrolling through social media, when I heard footsteps from my attic. The footsteps sounded frantic like something was trying to get out. I must admit this freaked me out, but after me rationalizing the situation for a bit, I concurred that it was just a bat or a mouse that somehow got in my attic. I decided I would call an exterminator in the morning.

I hadn't heard anything strange in the days that followed this, until about half a week later. I had the day off and decided to go to the grocery store. I got back a half  hour later and saw something strange to say the least. A bag of chips was open and spilled onto the floor. I remembered the animal that I thought was in the attic, and decided to stop procrastinating and call an exterminator. When the exterminator came, I told him all about the noises and the chip bag that was eaten despite me never opening it. He said it was probably a racoon or a possum and said he would check out the attic. The exterminator was in the attic for what felt like forever When he finally did come out, he had a confused expression on his face. I asked him if he found anything up there and he said there was nothing in there. I thanked him and he left, but I was left confused on how any of this was happening. That was, until the next night.

The next night I had went to bed and fell asleep. At around 2:00 am, I was woken up by the sound of those familiar footsteps and claw marks. I had made up my mind, I was going to go into the attic and find whatever was up there. I remembered the exterminator telling me that it may be a racoon or possum, and I decided to bring a pistol just in case it was rabid. I took a flashlight from my closet and headed upstairs.      I climbed up the ladder into the attic and clicked on my flashlight. I waved it around the room and froze in terror to what I saw. In the middle of the room, was a tall pale humanoid creature with dark beady eyes and a small nose. It had gray hair all over it's body and had long fingernails. It's eyes looked bloodshot and it's lips were dry. It was freakishly skinny and it's bones were almost visible through it's frail skin. It looked me in the eyes and broke my window and rushed into the forest by my back yard. I immediately took out my phone and called the police. The police came shortly and saw my broken attic window covered in blood. They took the blood and  after some testing they found out it was a close match to being human. The police searched the woods, but with no footprints or any other evidence, the decided to stop the case.

Like I said, that was two years ago. I am still shook from the experience, but have since recovered from the shock. I still live in that house, and have thought about the possibility of the creature coming back. But little did I know that that would happen. 

Yesterday night, I was in bed and heard a deep breathing. I woke up and looked around my room until I noticed what was in my doorway. The creature had returned and is somewhere in my house.
