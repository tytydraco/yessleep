1944, Tajikistan, USSR. Only one year remained until the end of World War II. In the village where my great-grandfather lived, 70% of the men were at the front. My great-grandfather served from 1941 to 1943 and returned to the village after being wounded. He was 34 at that time. Many families were left without men, and women became the heads of households, working tirelessly to provide for their children. The children often went unsupervised, sometimes falling asleep alone at home or with their grandmothers.

Great-grandfather worked to support a family of 13: his parents, his wife, five children, two unmarried sisters, and a neighbor woman with two children, whose husband was also at the front. Previously, the neighbor had lived with an elderly man, her father-in-law, but he passed away at the age of 95 at the end of August

In early September, the body of an eight-year-old girl was found next to a garbage dump. Deep bite marks resembling animal bite marks were found on her body. Parts of the girl's arms and stomach were bitten off. Residents were horrified and assumed that this was the work of a predator - a wolf or a rabid dog. A week later, another body with bite marks was found, a five-year-old boy. The whole village was shocked. People began to get dogs for protection, women left their children with neighbors when they went to work, and boys 10-12 years old armed themselves with knives and sharpened sticks to find dangerous animals.

One evening, one of the boys heard the cries of sheep coming from a neighboring house. Going inside, he saw a wolf biting the throat of a ram. The boy fought with the wolf and killed it, but he sustained serious injuries in the process. Unfortunately, he died a week later in the rural hospital from his wounds. The villagers mourned the boy and settled down, believing that the danger had passed.

One Thursday, my great-grandfather came home early due to a high fever and went to bed. At that time, many people were working in factories, mills, and fields until late at night. My great-grandfather was shivering, so my great-grandmother, his wife, gave him some herbal tincture and tucked him into bed. He felt a bit better and fell asleep.

He woke up feeling a heavy weight on his stomach. Opening his eyes, he saw an old man in white clothing with a long beard sitting on his stomach. The old man's eyes were hidden. My great-grandfather began to gasp, trying to push him away, but he couldn’t move.

"Take the knife," said the old man. "Take the knife, save my granddaughter. Get uuuuuup and take the kniiiiiife!!!!!!" the old man shouted, and my great-grandfather suddenly jumped out of bed. He realized that no one was around, He lifted his shirt and saw redness on his abdomen where the old man had been sitting and it took him a moment to understand who it was.

He grabbed his large army knife and headed toward the neighbor’s house. As he approached her gate, he saw a short figure emerging from the house into the darkness. Getting closer, my great-grandfather noticed that the figure was carrying a small girl from the neighbor. The figure was cradling her and moving away; the girl was deeply asleep.

Still not fully recovered from the fever and sleep, my great-grandfather was slow to understand what was happening. In a daze, with the knife in hand, he slowly followed the mysterious figure. The barking of dogs from neighboring houses could be heard, but no one came out to see what was happening.

The stranger carried the girl farther from the houses, toward a small garden, and entered its shadow. My great-grandfather cautiously followed him.

Entering the garden, my great-grandfather saw the stranger crouched down, holding the girl with her dress lifted and her mouth covered by his hand. The man bared his teeth and leaned in, preparing to bite her stomach. My great-grandfather reacted immediately: he threw the knife at the stranger, and the man cried out in pain as the knife struck his left shoulder blade. The girl woke up and screamed in terror, seeing the dark silhouette above her.

My great-grandfather ran up, pulled the knife out of the stranger’s back, and, after punching the man in the face, threw him to the ground. The stranger writhed in pain on the ground. My great-grandfather picked up the girl, holding her tightly, and, grabbing the stranger by the collar with his right hand while holding the girl with his left, dragged him out of the garden toward the lit street. The barking of dogs echoed throughout the village, drawing the attention of the residents. Some came out to see what was happening and saw my great-grandfather carrying the girl and dragging someone. Approaching the crowd, he threw the stranger to the ground. Everyone was shocked by the sight.

The stranger turned out to be a frail old man in worn clothing with long nails, almost a third of the length of his index finger. He had a dirty, long beard and a face wrinkled like a raisin. His eyes were round and red, resembling those of a rabid dog. The old man was writhing in pain, and his open mouth revealed his teeth—calcified and pointed.

My great-grandfather recounted everything that had happened, and in their anger, the townspeople began to beat the stranger. Men, women, and even children struck him with their hands, kicked him, and some beat him with sticks and shovels. The crowd grew larger, and everyone joined in the beating. By the time they finished, the stranger’s face was unrecognizable. He was covered in blood, with a smashed face and an eye hanging out of its socket, muttering something in an unintelligible language. Despite his injuries, he tried to get up, mumbling in a language no one understood, until the final blow from the back of a shovel struck his temple, and he fell to the ground.

Unfortunately, what happened next and who the old man was, my great-grandfather did not tell to my father, from whom I heard this story. However, from one of the village neighbors, I later learned that the old man was from a neighboring village and was very ancient. Rumor had it that he was 127 years old.
