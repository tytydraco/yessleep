When I was nine, me and my little sister were staying with our grandmother outside Farmington, Maine. Her house sat at the end of a long dirt road surrounded by thick woods that went on forever. She always told us not to go too far past the creek, said we might get lost. As kids we didn’t think much of it. We were bored, and the woods were our playground.

It was late one evening, close to dusk. The sun was low and the trees threw long shadows across the ground. The air was still, heavy, and the light had that deep orange glow that makes the woods feel smaller, tighter. We were farther from the house than we were supposed to be, sitting near a patch of ferns by the dry creek bed. You could barely see the house light through the trees.

We were past the creek, playing with sticks and throwing rocks into the water when the woods went silent. Not quiet, silent. It was like everything stopped breathing. No wind, no birds, no insects. The air itself felt wrong, like it was waiting for something.

Anna looked up first. “Where’d everything go?” she asked.

Before I could answer, we heard movement from up the hill. It was fast, it came bounding across the woods snapping twigs and breaking branches. It almost sounded like a horse galloping. Then it stopped. Then we heard breathing. Not close, but heavy. Like something was sniffing.

I thought it might be a deer or maybe a bear, so we stayed still in fear. The sound stopped when we did. Then it started again, closer this time.

Through the trees, I saw something pale moving low to the ground. It wasn’t shaped right. Its limbs were long, thin, its back was covered in thick grey hair, hunched like it was folding itself in half. It looked like a hairless dog, but much bigger, almost the size of a horse. It stopped every few steps and tilted its head, listening. That’s when I noticed, it wasn’t looking. Its eyes didn’t focus. It was blind, or close to it. Its eyes were sunken and glazed over. It was hunting by sound. Of course I didn’t realize this in the moment.

Anna whispered my name, and it turned toward us. It didn’t move for a second, then it started sniffing again, louder this time. The sound made my stomach twist.

I motioned her to stay quiet with my finger over my lips, not to move, but she was scared. She took a step back, and her heel hit a dry branch. The crack was small but sharp. That was all it took.

The thing’s head snapped toward her, and it lunged forward. It didn’t run, it crawled, fast, its hands hitting the dirt in bursts, elbows bending the wrong way. It was on her before I could even move. She screamed once. The sound stopped halfway through as the it wrapped around her and bounded into the trees, they both disappeared in seconds.

I ran past the creek towards the house, I didn’t think, didn’t look back, just ran toward the light of the house. I heard the sound of it moving through the forest far behind me, moving through the leaves, quick but uneven. Then the silence broke. The crickets started again, the wind came back, and the woods sounded alive like nothing happened.

When I reached the yard, I turned and looked back. There was nothing there. No movement. No sound.

Grandma came out onto the porch when she heard me yelling. She asked where Anna was. I couldn’t answer. The sheriff came later that night. Search teams went into the woods for days, they found her shoe near the creek but nothing else. No tracks, no blood. Nothing.

They said she probably got lost, maybe an animal took her. But I know what I saw. I remember its skin, gray and smooth like wet clay. I remember how it listened.

When my grandma died, I went back to the house one last time before selling it. The place was smaller than I remembered. I walked past the overgrown yard and through the trees to the edge of the creek.

I stood for a long time, waiting. The woods stayed alive, humming with wind and insects. I haven’t heard the silence since, but people in the mountains still talk about it. Deep in Appalachia and the far up Northeast. How sometimes, the woods go still for no reason. And when they do, no one sticks around to find out why.
