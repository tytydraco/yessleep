Hey everyone — I’m actually using voice-to-text in my car as I drive down the highway headed home. Or at least what should be home. Tonight has been a confusing, jumbled, terrifying mess that I’m still trying to piece together, and I’m terrified of what the next few days may bring. I’m here to try and compose my thoughts and get this story out so that maybe — someone out there — will believe what I have to say.

My wife left yesterday for Los Angeles. We live in Fort Myers, Florida, in a not-so-great part of town, but in a nice little four-bedroom home built in 2012. I wouldn’t say our house is haunted or anything like that — we’ve never experienced any strange phenomena or creepy encounters. My wife, Brianna, and my daughter, Raelynn, moved here in 2022. Brianna quickly got a job working for a cancer foundation out of Colorado and frequently takes trips to various cancer conferences where doctors give speeches and her group sells merchandise to raise awareness and money for research.

Yesterday she left for one such trip and isn’t scheduled to be back until Tuesday. It was just me and my 7-year-old daughter, Raelynn, for the weekend. I’ve been unemployed for about a year now, but thankfully my wife’s employment covers our necessities and bills. So I’ve had ample time to spend with our daughter.

Tonight started like any other night with the two of us alone. We sat on the couch watching a movie — her choice was the 2005 remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory starring Johnny Depp. I don’t know why she chose it, and I suppose it’s not important to the story, but regardless, she was enthralled. We sat on the couch with the curtains pulled shut and a bowl of popcorn between us, and simply watched.

She giggled from time to time or pointed out obvious scenes, and I smiled and brushed her hair while scrolling through my phone. My wife and I had been texting throughout the evening — she let me know they made it to the hotel okay and showed me pictures of the fancy dinner her boss treated her to before they went back to the hotel for the night. The conference was set to start the next morning. Everything felt normal.

Toward the last twenty minutes of the movie, I could tell my daughter was getting tired. She yawned, rubbed her eyes, stretched, then laid her head on my lap and started to fumble with her stuffed Pokémon, having trouble staying asleep. I continued scrolling through my phone until my wife called — obviously to wish our daughter goodnight. I answered and we talked briefly before she asked to speak with Raelynn.

I woke Raelynn and gave her the phone. They talked just briefly; I could hear my wife wishing her goodnight and singing a lullaby over the phone, blowing kisses into the speaker and telling her she loved her. After the call ended, I asked our daughter to go brush her teeth. She complied as usual, and I slowly followed her to tuck her in.

I sat on the edge of her bed while I heard her brush her teeth in the bathroom — her cheap electric toothbrush buzzing as she hummed a song from the movie. After she finished, she skipped into the bedroom and jumped into my lap, giving me a big hug like she always does. Tonight was going exactly like any other night. I tucked her into bed and laid next to her, preparing to rub her back until she fell asleep — when something very, very strange and unexpected happened.

I know this sounds ridiculous, and the people I’ve told so far think I’m going insane or hiding something, but I swear to you I’m not. My wife’s voice called out from the living room. It was crisp and clear and loud, yet almost robotic — like her voice had been recorded and someone simply pressed play. She called out, smooth and loud, “Sweetheart, Mommy’s home — come give me a hug!”

Immediately the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I shot out of that bed faster than a speeding bullet. I instinctively grabbed my daughter’s arm and held on tight while I looked at the closed door. I called back, “Hello? Babe, is that you? I thought you were in LA?” For a moment there was no response, and then it was like someone pressed rewind on the tape and pressed play again: “Sweetheart, Mommy’s home — come give me a hug!”

The tone and cadence were exactly the same as the first time, which unnerved me even more. It was unmistakably my wife’s voice — I swear with every fiber of my being it sounded like her — but it wasn’t. I gripped my daughter’s arm tighter as she shot out of bed and whispered, “Momma?”

I looked at her and shook my head. “That’s not Mama. Stay here,” I whispered, before slowly getting up and creeping to my daughter’s bedroom door. I pressed my ear to the door and just as I did, the voice played again: “Sweetheart, Mommy’s home — come give me a hug!” It sounded louder this time and almost more insistent, but still the same.

My daughter was getting antsy, unsure why I wasn’t letting her go see her mother. She clearly didn’t understand the unnatural sound of her voice and how little sense any of this made.

I fumbled for my phone in my pocket to call my wife and see what was happening, and as I went to unlock it my hands shook and I dropped it on the floor. It landed face down so I couldn’t see the screen in the darkness. I bent down to look for it, and while I did, my daughter took that opportunity to rush past me to see her mom.

She opened the door and turned to me: “Mama’s back early — I’m going to go give her a hug!” Then she ran completely carefree into the darkness. I scrambled to my feet and chased after her as the sound played again from the living room: “Sweetheart, Mommy’s home — come give m—” What I’m about to tell you is even more terrifying than hearing the voice play so loudly in the living room. The very instant my daughter disappeared around the hallway corner and into the living room, the sound stopped mid-sentence — as though someone pressed stop on the recording. Everything went silent. Far too silent.

All I could hear, if I strained, was the quiet tick-tick of the kitchen clock and my own heavy breathing. I rounded the corner as quickly as I could, tripped over my own feet, but picked myself up and burst into the living room. The room was pitch black and silent. Even the night lights plugged into the walls weren’t illuminating. It was a thick, black darkness my eyes couldn’t pierce despite being somewhat adjusted.

“Raelynn,” I called out as loudly and as commanding as I could. “Raelynn, where are you, sweetheart?” Only silence answered. I sprinted to the other side of the room and flicked on the light and scanned the area. Everything looked normal: Raelynn’s blanket was still strewn on the floor where she left it after the movie, the TV remote lay on the couch cushion where I had left it, and the other remote for controlling sound sat on the end table. My nightly cup of coffee still sat half-drunk on the end table. Everything was exactly as we’d left it — but there was no one there. No trace of anyone besides myself.

Panic set in and I ran through the house screaming my daughter’s name at the top of my lungs. I checked every room — the office, the guest bedroom, my master bedroom, all three bathrooms, the garage. I even pulled down the attic ladder (it was stuck from months of disuse, but I ripped it down anyway) and clamored up, turning on lights and screaming her name again. There was no response anywhere. I checked all the doors and windows — all were securely locked from the inside. I tore open cabinets in the pantry, the refrigerator, and plastic totes thinking maybe she’d hidden somewhere or was playing some kind of game — but there was nothing. I’d just made a massive mess of my home and sat down on the couch too confused to cry or be truly afraid. How can a 7-year-old girl just vanish into thin air? She had to be here. There was nowhere else she could possibly be, right?

At the time I was afraid to call the police because I didn’t even know what to tell them. What am I supposed to say? My daughter was whisked away by the disembodied voice of my wife who’s currently in Los Angeles on a business trip? I’d be arrested on the spot. I sat on that couch for what felt like an eternity, contemplating, before I saw a figure run past the front window.

Without even thinking I bolted up, ran to the front door, tore it open, and ran outside, screaming her name again and again: “Raelynn! Raelynn! RAELYNN!!!” A figure stepped out from behind our front rose bush — a neighbor boy who had apparently been peeking in our front window. He looked pale as a ghost and absolutely terrified. My face dropped as I saw him, clearly filled with disappointment.

“Hi. I’m so sorry, sir. I didn’t mean to intrude. I just heard something on my walk with my dog and I thought — well, I mean, I don’t know. I just thought I would check and see?” He stammered. I got down to his level and asked calmly, “Son, what did you see?” He shook his head, unsure of what he’d seen or scared to talk about it. “I don’t really… well, I’m not really sure,” he said. He looked a mix of confused and terrified.

I asked him again to tell me. “Well, I heard a woman’s voice, but it sounded like a robot or something. And then in the window I saw a little girl run into the room, but then — it’s like I don’t really know how to explain this.” He paused. “The room was dark, you know, but my eyes were adjusted, and yet when she came into your front room it’s like the darkness turned off a light and got darker.” He was having trouble explaining what he’d seen but he was clearly shaken. “And then I don’t know — the sound stopped suddenly, and then I heard you running around bashing and tearing things up and screaming, and I just got scared and froze up.”

I thanked him and sent him home before retreating back into my house. I didn’t really know what to do after that, so I got in my car and drove around the neighborhood with my head out the window like a dog, yelling my daughter’s name for over an hour. I’m still afraid to call the police. I just don’t know what to do. This whole thing doesn’t make any sense — even saying it here sounds so stupid.

My wife is calling me now and I don’t know what to say. I have to go. I’ll try to make an update if there’s anything worth saying.
