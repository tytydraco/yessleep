I live in a old farmstead with my family. 

*Tuesday, 2089. * It was 10:34 PM. I lied in my best restlessly. My eyes were wide open staring at the ceiling fan. I was drowsy and tired. I tried to close my eyes but something bothered me. I snapped out of my daydream and looked over at my snoring husband. I managed to close my eyes and fall asleep by 11:21 PM.

*Wednesday, 2089* I went to go wake up my daughter, Elaina for school. I walked up our creaky stairs and opened her door. She wasn’t in her bed.

I panicked, I looked around for her and shouted a couple times “Elaina! This isn’t funny!” I got no response. I ran down our creaky stairs, went to grab my cellphone and I dialed 911. “911, what’s your emergency?”, “My daughter is missing. I went to wake her up and she wasn’t in bed or the house.” 

*2 days later, Friday, 2089* My husband and I went on a hike to get our daughter’s disappearance off of our minds. We walked across a bridge, than we were in the forest. “What’s that?” I asked. We walked closer to the tree. 

MISSING PERSONS: ELAINA GRACE

“That’s our daughter.” Alex said. The thought of her not being here confused me. I slowly drifted off to a nostalgic memory. Me, Elaina and Alex were at the supermarket. The workers were lousy that day.

“Rose!” Alex tapped me.

I snapped out of my memories. “Rose.. what are those things coming towards us?” Alex asked. I could tell he was nervous. “I-I’m not sure.”

People walked towards us. Turns out it was the police. We got in their car. One twitched. The cop bit the driver. “What the hell?!” Alex screamed. The car swerved and the two cops were trying to bite us.

Me and Alex ran home as fast as we could. We locked our doors and turned on the TV. 

*TV: BREAKING NEWS, crazy people said to be aggressively attacking people. Scientists say this is some sort of virus. I have Dr. Trile with us now.

“Our scientists are mostly all professionals , except for one. We recently hired a college student that seemed smart and into science and history. In the lab, we have been working on a cure for cancer. One day, we needed our college student to add some stuff to it and try it on our test subject. Due to security footage, he did as he was told. He tried it on the test subject. Somehow, overnight our test subject broke out and bit the newest scientist. The virus began to spread around the lab and we believe it broke out of the lab, and is now a deadly outbreak. Many people are saying “zombies”.*

“Zombies aren’t real.” I scoffed.

Suddenly, there was banging on our door. 

BREAKING NEWS, Family of 3 missing since 12/7/2089. Many described them as “The perfect family.” Many believe that the government released a virus in their city, and only their city. Military are being sent in along with many police to discover this “virus.” The military and police have been missing since, and last seen in Rose’s household. We sent 1 professional police officer to investigate their disappearance. The professional went missing, but managed to find Rose’s journal.

The journal reads, “everyone that comes here, stays here.”

Many believe their family had a dark secret they never shared to the public.
