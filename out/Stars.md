My name is Liam. One of my most vivid memories from childhood is a walking trip to a local university when I was five and a half years old. It was late July; summer was nearing its end. It was my final summer before I was to start kindergarten. Only one more month. I was scared to go.

I’d been spending most of my summer days at my aunt’s house with my younger brother, while my parents worked. Her house was just around the corner from the university. You couldn’t see it directly from the house, but if you walked about four houses east to the end of the block and looked south, there it was, at the end of the crossroad five or six blocks down.

It was a small Quaker university (or, at least, it was founded as one about a hundred years prior), mostly consisting of a single large tower building, but with a few smaller satellite buildings scattered around the feet of the larger one. The central tower of the university had an interesting look. It was constructed from red bricks and capped in slate blue, with elaborate arched windows trimmed in pale limestone. Almost deliberately archaic.

It looked like a castle from a fairy story.

My aunt had a son and a daughter, my older cousins. She was going into fifth grade, I think. He would have been about twelve; going into seventh grade. They had been attending summer school, or some sort of afternoon summer program (nobody remembers the exact details) hosted by the university, and the day in my memory was their last day to attend. They were going to eat lunch and then have a little celebration, and they could invite a couple of friends.

My aunt thought it might be fun for me and my brother to go with them that afternoon. I could see, or at least get some idea, of what a classroom looked like, how a grown-up school worked. Maybe I wouldn’t be as scared to go to kindergarten afterward. We agreed.

It’s funny how much our perception of time changes over the years. As a five-and-a-half-year-old, my cousins practically seemed like adults to me. Even the idea of being as old as they were seemed so far-off and unattainable.

We—my younger brother, my two older cousins, and I—left the house in a jaunty mood around noon and trekked on foot over to the big tower building so that we could make it to the cafeteria for lunch at 12:30.

I remember the cafeteria room. Folded, unused beige school-cafeteria tables standing upright in their holds along the walls. Two long tables unfolded and laid out for maybe a couple dozen children. The grey-green, almost olive-green floor tile overlain with those greyish speckled-streak patterns you see in tiles sometimes. The large-brick walls painted pale brown.  The lovely natural lighting—strips of bright midday sunlight slanting through enormous, tall windows with partially-closed blinds, lighting up specks of dust in the air like fairy magic, in a room that was otherwise pleasantly shaded. An enchanting mix of light and shade that really did seem to soothe me.

At some point the younger of my cousins had brought us all some boxes of chocolate milk on a tray. I remember her reassuring me that I’d like going to school, because I’d get to drink chocolate milk every day for lunch. I think it actually did make me feel better.  

I remember nothing of the actual ‘celebration’, other than that at some point it involved a tour of the tower. At a certain point we were given a little bit of time to explore.

Somewhere on the sixth floor, there was a small corner exhibit about early renaissance navigation in the Americas and the West Indies. I remember, very clearly, two things in that exhibit. One was a reproduction of the Erdapfel, an Earth globe created in 1491, the year before Columbus’ voyage into the Caribbean. I can’t remember if I was old enough to understand its significance at the time, but looking back on the memory when I was older, it gave me the creeps. The Erdapfel was a well-produced, definitive piece of cartography, probably made with quite a bit of confidence...and two entire continents were simply *not there.* Only vast, dark ocean in their place.

The other thing I remember clearly was a section of the floor painted with the stars and constellations of the night sky, as seen from the northern hemisphere. I recognized the North Star and the Big Dipper. I remember looking at it for a very long time. So long that everyone around me must have wandered off, because eventually I was alone, wandering the space of the exhibit, eyes fixed on the stars in the floor.

The constellation map must have really only been a few feet long, giving way after a short distance to some dingy black formica tiles flecked with white spots, but I don’t think my five-and-a-half-year-old brain clocked that the stars had ended. I thought as I stepped on the tiles that I’d simply wandered farther into deep space, where no one on Earth could see or had ever been. As I followed the pathway of the tiles I began to obsess over the specks, trying to find my own patterns and faces in them. No pattern ever fully congealed…I felt like I was trying to recognize whisps of shapes under a thousand feet of dark water. I was a lost explorer in an ocean under strange stars, far away from anything I knew.

After a few minutes I came to a door, offset from the others, with a painted-over handle that looked like it hadn’t been used in years. There was a name set into a dusty metal slide mount in the wall beside the door; a former professor who was no longer there. Transferred to another university, or retired, or dead, perhaps; I never found out. I don’t recall anything about the name, other than that it was female. The door was unlocked. I went inside; I guess I thought I’d find more stars.

The interior of the room was unattended, and dirtier than the other rooms. And it was small, smaller than any of the classrooms I’d seen. There were no stars; the floor was made of old, dark wood. It looked like an office. There was a desk, shelves, books. Only one thing seemed out of place: squatting in the center of the room was an old tripod and a dilapidated camera, covered with dust. It probably didn’t work anymore. I turned to face where it was pointing.

Suspended on the wall in front of it was a worn, unframed photograph. It was glued to an old piece of green construction paper. On the photograph was my face, five and a half years old, gazing back at me. Frozen. Contorted in agony. In the background of the photograph I could make out the features of this same room.

An unseen hand drove something that looked like a long screwdriver through my ear into my head.

There was a small window on the opposite wall, covered by a dirty white curtain except for one sliver from which a thin ray of pale light shot diagonally through the room and back out into the formica-tiled hallway. The light wouldn’t go near the photograph.  

I don’t remember how I actually felt, seeing that image; I just remember staring at it for a moment, very confused, and then turning back in silence out of the room to go find my cousins and my brother again.

When I found them, I said nothing about what I’d seen. We were back at my aunt’s house by two o’ clock. I played in the backyard, I probably watched TV. I did normal things.

At what must have been about 3:15 that afternoon, I was sitting on the floor in the brown-carpeted den at the back of the house, alone. I don’t remember what I was doing; probably watching something about animals that no one else wanted to watch.  On one side of me, I could see the vague shape of my brother through the screen and glass doors that opened to the backyard, doing something or other by the back shed. On the other side of me was the entryway into the thin stretch of ‘dining room’, which was little more than a painted-white booth set into the wall under a long window, leading into the kitchen in the middle of the house.

I could hear someone rooting around in the kitchen in the cabinet under the sink.

I got up and wandered slowly that way, wondering about the noise. Sun from the side window bathed the dining room in light so bright it made my cheeks hot, but the kitchen was shaded, cool and blue, the curtains drawn shut. I was glad to be there. I crested the corner to see who was making the noise under the sink, and hunched between the wide-open doors was a woman I had never seen before. Her sleeves were rolled up past her elbows and she was reaching down through a hole in the floor that was larger than she was.

I could see nothing but black down there. She looked like she was searching for something, or she’d found something and was trying to reach it.

When she noticed I was looking at her, she pulled her hands out, sat up, and smiled.

‘Hello, little lost explorer,’ she’d said affably. I asked her who she was.

She told me that she’d found some new stars for me; that she knew how much I liked them. If I wanted, I could take them home and hang them on my wall. I could eat them up and keep them in my heart until they were ready to shine. She beckoned into the black hole. I held my breath and leaned in closer to see where she was pointing.

All I remember next was my entire world going black, and then waking up in a hospital bed.

My aunt told me that I had gotten into a plastic tub of nickel-sized drain-cleaning tablets under the sink, the ones with the blue-and-white speckled patterns, and eaten a handful of them. She had come in from gardening outside around 3:25 to find me convulsing on the floor.

I didn’t die. (Obviously.) Somehow, I was extremely fortunate and none of the caustic foam welling up from my esophagus spilled over into my lungs. I’d also horked up most of the pills before they’d even made it past my mouth, before they could do much damage. The burning in my mouth and esophagus was agonizing for a few weeks, and inconvenient for a few months, but ultimately I recovered. I still have scarring on my esophageal lining and the back of my throat, and occasional bouts of pain where it feels like my entire throat is a giant canker sore and I can only eat liquid foods for a week or two. But for the most part, that afternoon is just a memory.

When I asked about it years later, everyone who was with me that day told me they had no idea what to make of what happened. When I came home from the university, I’d seemed completely normal; I’d eaten a snack, I’d played with the other kids, I’d rambled on in excitement over a show about animals that I wanted to record for later, as I often did. Less than two hours later my aunt had come into the kitchen to find me nearly dead on the floor after swallowing half a tub of cleaning tablets. No one had been aware of anything wrong with me other than that I had been scared to go to kindergarten, which most kids my age were.  

I myself can’t offer any opinion about what happened, because I can’t recall a single thing about my life before that afternoon. Not even fragments. Not even the morning of that day.

It isn’t *that* unusual to have your first memory at five and a half, certainly not enough to have concerned anyone else, but it has always bothered me. Most people can recall at least a few fragments from as far back as two or three, and most people have at least somewhat detailed memories as early as four. Yet my sense of self seems to have awakened instantly, and all at once, the precise moment that the pale red and blue university tower around the corner from my aunt’s house came into view at noon on that hot, sunny day in late July, a month before I started kindergarten.  As if the tower itself had summoned me into sentience as I currently experience it.  

My brother joked once that the pills might’ve given me brain damage. It’s a morbidly amusing thought, but it doesn’t really make sense. My memory ever since has been perfectly fine, and the hospital reports from that afternoon said nothing about any damage to my brain; just to my mouth and esophageal lining.

I’ve never been able to escape the feeling that something from before that afternoon was deliberately carved out of me. I think back to that replica of the Erdapfel. Back to the unsettled feeling that still comes over me when I think about it, seeing the Americas, my home, simply *missing* from the world. I think back to the photograph….

But, oddly enough, this isn’t a story about childhood trauma. Not exactly. I remember from that point forward going into kindergarten with a sense of hope and confidence that I hadn’t had before; it was as if I had shown some resilience or spirit in the ordeal with the tablets which had convinced someone, or something, that my existence was worth continuing. Like I’d passed a test. From that afternoon onward, I had—complications from eating the cleaning tablets notwithstanding—a perfectly normal and happy childhood. I never saw or even dreamed about the woman under the sink ever again.

My only wisp of a connection to anything about my life before that afternoon is a recurring dream I had when I was…probably six or seven. Maybe eight.  

In the dream, I was much younger: preschool. Well…it’s complicated. I never experienced the dream directly as my preschool self, but as an unseen older child, observing my younger self as if I were watching him in a movie. We stood in my front yard, on a clear hot night near the end of September. The porch lamp cast us in a pale yellow-orange. Cicadas trilled their very last songs; the last of the June bugs thudded dumbly against the porch walls. Another boy, one of my friends in preschool, stood with us. He was leaving, and we would never see him again. His mom had to go somewhere.  

My younger self made up his mind to fashion some sort of doll or likeness of the boy, out of what I don’t know, and he would do it so well that nobody would be able to tell the difference. When he finished, he realized the body would be too heavy to take with him to school, so the following Monday he decided he would just carry the head. I followed him.

His decision was unpopular. Classmates complained again and again that the teeth would clack and grind when the head moved. It seemed to produce a slow but endless supply of moist matter that seeped out to the surface from some bottomless pit inside of it. Everyone complained about the smell. The teachers complained when they had to pause their activities several times a day to send his classmates to the bathroom to throw up. They complained every time they had to sweep away the tiny brown sesame seed-like eggs that would fly out of its ‘hair’ like popped popcorn onto the floor. Parents complained that they would never get the smell out of their children’s clothing.

My younger self took offense to the complaints, responding with anger. He would defend his ‘friend’ as if the boy were really there, still whole and one in the same with the doll. As if the other children, the parents, and even the teachers were bullying the boy.  

This seemed to continue for months, for all the sense of time I had in a dream.

That is all I remember. I must have been no older than eight when the dream stopped, and I’ve never had it since.

Many, many years later—about four years ago as I write this—I was cleaning out my grandmother’s attic after her death. I happened to empty out the contents of a big box of old papers that I think my grandmother had originally been storing for my mother, and at the very bottom was a small collection of journal entries and outpatient records, from a year that I would have been preschool-aged. I don’t think either my mother or my grandmother had intended to preserve any of them; they seemed to have just been buried inadvertently under piles of other paper junk over the years, until they were forgotten about.

I was in them.

My parents had been taking me to a child psychologist because of a bit of obsessive behavior that had begun to concern them. I had a stuffed animal, and apparently it was true that I’d kept it because it reminded me of a boy I’d been close friends with in preschool. His mother had worked at the university. Something had happened regarding the mother, and he moved away. The stuffed animal was a pale blue rabbit hugging a bright yellow crescent moon, but at the time I didn’t understand the difference between the moon and the stars, so I’d kept calling the crescent moon a “star”.

After the boy left, I had kept the stuffed animal for about a year, until it was reeking and falling apart. I took it everywhere with me. At some point it had fallen into the trash, and some trash water had soaked into it and made it moldy, but I absolutely refused to let anyone throw it away. I screamed bloody murder any time anyone suggested washing it, too, because I was afraid it would fall apart. I would become violently inconsolable at the idea of parting with it or letting anyone do anything to it.

It was all behavior that, though on the extreme side, was not especially unheard of for a toddler, even an older one. I was only truly stricken—or, least, confused—by one thing. It was a small bit from the only surviving part of an interview transcript between me and the child psychologist, near the end of a series of counseling sessions. The psychologist asked me a question that had probably been asked a thousand times before: how long was I going to keep carrying the stuffed animal around?

This time, I had taken a few moments to think about my answer. Then, reluctantly, I said that I didn’t know…I was afraid to stop, until I had permission to do so.

Permission from whom?

Again, I didn’t answer for a long time until, gathering the courage to speak the words aloud, I said that not only did I have no idea, I didn’t even know if I would recognize permission when I got it. I wasn’t even sure if I was meant to stop. The only thing I was sure of was that I couldn’t stop without “permission”.

There was a bit more back and forth, in which my demeanor seemed to change drastically for the worse and my answers were less forthcoming, until finally, I said:

“I hope I do get to stop soon.” A pause. “I really hate having to look at it.”

The transcript ended. Or, at least, nothing further was preserved in the box.  

I spent the rest of that day searching every box of papers in the attic for more information, but found nothing. Nothing other than a conviction as strong as ever that something about my life before age five and a half had been carved out of my memory. By whom, or by what, I had no idea. Whenever I asked anyone who might know more, they wouldn’t say anything. Maybe they didn’t know any more.

Maybe it doesn’t matter, and it’s better not to know.
