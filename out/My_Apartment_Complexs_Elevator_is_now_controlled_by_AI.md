I think it’s fair to say that we all have seen some pretty fast advancements in artificial intelligence. Enough so that’s it’s getting scary. There’s the worry of it taking over things that humans can do. Like driving cars, making music, and even recently I have seen it make videos using pictures of real life people. But oddly enough that’s not the experience I had today.

I live in a fairly newer apartment development. The rent is a bit pricey but I have a good paying job and wanted a nicer place with good security. I live alone on the twelfth floor of the building. 

One day after work, I was going home like any other day and stepped into the elevator and reached to push the button for my floor. But noticed all the buttons were gone and there was a screen in its place. It wasn’t there this morning so they must have installed it while I was at work. 

Some words pop up onto the screen, “Which floor would you like to go to? Please give your request verbally.” An automated human like voice-kinda like siri, asked me.

“Uh, the twelfth floor.”

“Going up.” It says, and the doors shut and I begin my ascent. 

Thinking nothing more of it, I scroll on social media for the duration of the elevator ride. But then the machine speaks to me again.

“How was your day Jeremy?” 

How the hell did this thing know my name? Disturbed that’s exactly what I asked it.

“Facial recognition software in my system allows me to identify all my tenants.” It pauses, “How was your day?”

“Um fine I guess.” I look at the screen for an indicator of what floor I’m on so I can stop having this weird conversation with the elevator.

“That’s great to hear Jeremy. You have now arrived to the eleventh floor. Enjoy the rest of your day.” The door opens but I don’t step out.

“I live on the twelfth floor. This isn’t my floor.” I tell it.

It load a response, “No Jeremy, you live on the eleventh floor.” Was this thing really gaslighting me?

“No I don’t. Now take me up a floor.” I was beginning to get irritated with the machine. What was so wrong with the regular elevator system that they felt the need to replace it with this garbage?

“Did you just call my system garbage?” It asked me and my heart raced. I didn’t say anything.

“N-no. I didn’t. Please just take me to my floor…please.” I had no recollection of saying anything out loud. Was this thing able to read thoughts?

“You are at your floor, please step off the elevator.”

Frustrated I said, “Just take me to the lobby. I’ll take the stairs. I don’t have time for this shit.”

It was silent for a few moments and then the computer said, “Very well. I’ll go faster since you don’t have time.”

“What-“

Suddenly the door shuts and the elevator plummets down. My heart leaps to my throat and I don’t have anything to hold onto. My body is off the ground and I’m practically floating. I try to scream but I can’t get any air into my lungs. Soon, the elevator crashes to a hault and I’m surged to the floor. I land on my back knocking the air out of my body. The bell chimes and doors open. I stay on the floor scared to move.

“You have arrived at the lobby. Please exit the elevator and have a wonderful day.”

I’m never taking that elevator again.
