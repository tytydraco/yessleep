It doesn’t really matter how I did it, right?

Honestly, I think you could use pretty much any mirror you have lying around, as long as you know the correct procedures.

Only, even if you knew, even if you ever found out, how I did what I did... please, don’t follow my lead.

I think there’s a price to be paid for everything in this world, and I’m afraid it has come due for me. There’s a high possibility I won’t be able to contact anyone again, but it’s a risk I’m willing to take.

One, I have to, if I’m being honest.

This whole thing started eight years ago.

Shit, I only now realized how long it’s been...

Maddie disappeared in the spring of 2017, and our lives just... fell apart.

That first night, when we had to admit to ourselves that she wasn’t simply wandering around out there but that something had happened, was the worst of my life.

Neither my partner nor I slept at all that following week, either driving along the roads we knew she had taken or waiting by the phone for a call from the police or maybe the person who took her.

But we got nothing. No clue, no trace, no ray of hope.

It was as if she had been swallowed by the earth.

With every passing day and no new clues, I felt this abyss inside me growing more and more.

I know my partner felt the same way. I could see it, yet I couldn’t do anything about it either.

We weren’t a team anymore, no. It was like this crack had formed with Maddie’s disappearance, both of us blaming ourselves while neither was able to give the other comfort.

It was a really dark time.

And after months had passed, we just... gave up.

I couldn’t stand living in our house anymore and threw myself first into work, then into alcohol, then finally into finding a way to find out what had really happened.

No longer able to live with myself, I let madness consume me. Completely.

It took me years and pretty much every penny I ever made before I stumbled upon something.

At that point, I think my family stopped being scared for me and started being scared of me. I had called maybe twice a year, but every time it descended into ramblings and crying...

No, I don’t blame them at all for not wanting anything to do with me anymore.

I don’t think anyone should... You don’t either, right?

But, in my madness, I found it.

A way to see her again.

Maybe, I thought back then, even contact her, wherever she was.

I had to beg and plead with my family and friends for enough money to begin my experiment, and in the end, they finally relented, even if it was just to get me off their doorsteps.

Yeah, I noticed the look in their eyes. All of them.

Each and every one stared at me like some wild and possibly dangerous animal, but I didn’t care then and don’t care now.

I got the materials, got the mirror, put it on the table in this small and dirty apartment, and began the ritual.

All in all, it took me around three hours before I finally felt it working, and for the first time, I actually looked into hell.

It wasn’t Maddie I saw, no, but an old woman, sitting on a dark floor.

She was crying, screaming, I think.

It’s hard to say, without sound, but I saw her mouth opening, her eyes going wide as she sat there, clawing at the floor, while the darkness around her seemed to move.

Cold sweat was running down my back as I watched for what felt like an eternity.

She couldn’t see me; that much was clear as well.

Her eyes were darting from side to side, looking for help, yet never finding any.

The shadows were coming closer and closer.

I lost my concentration after a few minutes, and the mirror stopped working.

What I had seen just then freaked me out, of course, but it also gave me hope.

I had proof it worked.

Now, I only needed to find out if I could look at specific people.

My grandpa, who had died over a decade ago, seemed like the logical choice.

I took a short break, then looked once more, repeating my grandpa’s name over and over again in my mind.

And this time, as the mirror turned into a window, I saw him.

A frail old man, standing by what probably had once been a cinder-block wall.

I could see him scratching it with his nails.

Deep grooves marked the stones, while dark blood was running down and staining the floor.

I screamed his name at the top of my lungs, but he didn’t turn or look at me.

His hands kept working, scratching, bleeding...

As planned beforehand, I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight, then shone it directly into the mirror.

The darkness of the place got pushed back, even if only for a little bit, and in that split second, my grandpa’s face finally turned.

I saw his eyes, wide with terror, staring back at me through the light.

Tears were streaming down his face and the shadows around him started moving.

In the cone of light, I could see the hands reaching out to him and... to me.

Something grabbed the frame of the mirror from the other side, pushing it up, and I fell back with my chair, breaking the connection.

My heart was racing completely out of control as I rolled over and stood up again, only daring to look at the mirror on the table from the side.

It was still moving, almost vibrating, while the clouds seemed to dissipate in its reflective surface, and the ceiling of the small and dirty apartment came back into view.

I think that was the point when I realized it. The mirror had been turned into a window, and it could be opened, at least from one side.

As much as this realization terrified me, it also gave me hope.

I reset the table and mirror, then concentrated on Maddie.

A part of me was still hoping I wouldn’t be able to find her. That she was alive, somewhere out there, waiting to be rescued...

But I knew it deep down already. Had known it for almost eight years.

And as I looked into the mirror and watched the surface turn black, then dark grey, I caught a glimpse of her.

Maddie.

She looked exactly the same as the day she had disappeared; only this time, as I saw her, she was crying.

Running.

Silently screaming.

My heart broke, and I called out to her as she raced by, looking over her shoulder at something I couldn’t see, chasing her.

She couldn’t hear me either.

But I touched the surface of the mirror and felt it for the first time. This coldness shot up through my fingers as ripples formed and my skin prickled.

I could feel them sinking in, at least a tiny bit, but the shadows moved again as soon as I disturbed the window, and I had to jump back to quickly break the connection.

Since then, this apartment feels different, but I don’t care.

I can see things moving in the corner of my eyes.

Maybe I’ve marked myself, cursed myself, or made myself a target...

It doesn’t matter to me.

I’ve sent an email to my parents and siblings, apologizing for my behavior these past few years.

Then, I sent one to my partner, forgiving them and myself for everything we could, should, or would have done differently.

I felt it was important to clear the air, or at least try one last time...

That email also contains my address right now, so they can find the book that will tell them how to set up the mirror.

It’s also why I’m posting this here. Maybe I want someone not involved to read my words... to understand why I have to do it...

After seeing her, scared and running, I know I can’t step back anymore.

I will look for Maddie; I will climb into the mirror, and I fear I won’t be able to come out again.

If my partner ever finds this place, I’m not sure if I want them to try and look her up as well... but it’s their choice to make, not mine.

What I can say for sure is this:

If they managed to use the technique to set up the mirror and look for Maddie, they won’t find her alone at least.

I promise I will be with her from now on. Running beside her. Protecting her, as I failed to do while she was still alive.

Maybe it’s the madness talking, but I think I prefer hell at her side to the hell I’ve been living in these past few years...

Then again, I don’t know what will happen.

But... My time has come.

Wish me [luck.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Haunted_Tales_Pod/comments/1lhyev2/need_more_horror_in_your_life_haunted_tales_has/)
