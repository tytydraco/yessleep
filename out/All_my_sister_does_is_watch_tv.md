Like in the title, All my sister does is watch tv. I really need to find a way to help my sister, or won't want to be near her anymore.

My sister was a very active person, if she even stayed in one place for more than 30 seconds she would get really annoyed, but for the past month all she would do is sit on the couch and watch tv, she wouldn't even get up to eat, that's why I had to feed her every single day.

All of this started because I let her into the house, I let her stay with me. She didn't ask, but I felt horrible just knowing that she only had a bed to sleep in, no money, no food, drink etc, so I let her stay with me.

For the first couple of days, she was fine, no weird smells, nothing. But I just hated the fact that all she did was sit and watch tv, she didn't get up, even to eat, even to shower, she wouldn't even talk to me.

Next few weeks was when the smell started to happen, I woke up one morning, and smelled this terrible stench, smelled of death, something rotting, as you guessed it, it was coming from my sister.

When the smell started, I could see sores popping up from my sister's skin. I suggested that we go see a doctor, but my sister stayed mute, so I decided not to think too much about it.

Almost a month has gone by since I took my sister In, but those sores on her cheek stink so much, they're literally everywhere, on her face, on her arms, legs, everywhere and yet when I try to help her she says nothing!

Tbh, I'm starting to get used to the smell, I like it, the smell of something rotting, home, my sister is the only family I have, her scent is unique, and smells like home.

But then at the sametime, my sister would like to be put back to bed, I'm a pretty tiny woman, and I can't really pick humans up, and plus she's got those sores all over her, I don't wanna get too close, I don't want to get infected.

I feed her by using a tube, I quickly put the tube in her mouth, and take a few steps back, and feed her through the tube, which I guess you could call a feeding pipe.

But anyways, yesterday I invited our parents over, I was so excited to see mom and dad and I hope my sister was too.

But when my parents arrived, they immediately acknowledged the smell, and then when I showed them the reason why it smells so bad, they called me crazy, psychopath, and all that other hurtful stuff.

My parents are bad parents. A month ago, my sister was asleep peacefully in her bed, but all of a sudden my parents moved her bed to a cemetery. Everyone gathered around, they put my sister in the ground.

2 days later, I dug her up, and insisted that she stay with me, those sores all over her, I think are just rots..
