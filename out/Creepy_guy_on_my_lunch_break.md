This is a real interact I had happen to me a few days ago and I don't know exactly know what to do about it. No crime was committed, but it threw me for a loop. I'm posting my experience here just to share.

For context, I (M22) work for a Car Auction House. We are a large property that stores thousands of vehicles and prepares to sell them in an auction on behalf of dealerships that partner with us. We also have customers coming in to inspect cars before bidding. Being a car guy myself, I understand why. If you're gonna bid money on it, you at least wanna know the state its in. The property is located in a small town and just off a major road and is boxed in by a shopping outlet and woods. Electrical fences topped with barbed wire surround the property. A few years back, a group of thieves came in through the woods and stole a couple of Mercedes. Safe to say no one can just climb over the fence. Only way in is the main building entrance, the vehicle entrance/exit gate, and vehicle drop off gate. 

For my specific job, the company gives me a vehicle to drive around in on the property. I also have a company phone, phone chargers, jumper cables, and a radio. I bring snacks for myself, a book, or watch Netflix and YouTube for when the day is slow. So for most of my day, I'm sitting in a barely running Chevy Malibu, driving around, sending emails on my work phone, and locating vehicles. A decent little office space on wheels where no one bothers me.

This happened to me on my one hour lunch break. If you're like me, you know that daily life and routines can steal time from your sleep. So I fix this by getting any naps in when I can. I'm sure I'm not the only one who takes 10 to 15 minutes to eat, and then 30 minutes to nap. I took my time to drive up to the punch out machine in the main building and clocked out for lunch. I drove over to a little corner of the property to have my lunch in peace. I parked my car, and manual locked the driver side and passanger side doors. I'm a bit paranoid. After I eat my lunch I throw the seat back, turn the AC on low, set an alarm and close my eyes to take a nap.

I don't go into a full sleep ever, it's more of the in between of deep sleep and being fully awake. I noticed the sound of faint tapping on my window. When I opened my eyes, nothing was there so I went back to sleep. I'm not sure how much time when by, but I swore my heart nearly exploded when I heard the attempt of my car door being opened. I shot up and looked to see a middle aged man starring at me. His eyes were wide but his face didn't show any expression like being surprised or startled. He was just looking at me. I cracked the window a little bit, "Can I help you?". 

After I spoke, his hand left the door handle, and he placed his fingers in the opening of the window. He leaned in closer to peek his eyes through and level them with my face. His behavior was unnerving. It felt like he was trying to get as close as possible to me. In a voice that sounded like broken English he said, "jump please sir". I knew what he was asking for but I wasn't going to give it to him. Not just because he freaked me out, but I also didn't want to step out of the car. I'm not a small guy. I'm 6ft and 180lbs of muscle. I've boxed, and taken mix martial arts. I can handle myself, but this guy gave me the creeps. Kind of like how freaked out you get when a bug is too close to your face. His slowed and focused movements reminded me of a predator about to catch it's prey. 

I looked at the clock and saw I still had 20 minutes of my break before I had to drive to clock back in. "Uhh, I'm on my lunch break right now. I get off in 20 minutes. If you stay by your vehicle, I could get someone to help you afterwards." His eyes stayed fixed on me and then his mouth did...something. I don't know how to describe it but, it moved in a way I'd didn't know it could. Have you ever had a muscle spasm? Your arm or leg muscles twitch in a rapid manor. That's what his lower jaw did. It just twitched.

He stared at me for a few more seconds, through it felt like an hour passed. He pulled his hand back, letting his fingers that were hooked inside the window slide up and out. He stood up and turned back around to start walking away. I assumed he went to go right back to whatever car he was looking to buy, but I watched him walk all the way back to the main building. I think he just left the property. 

Come to think of it, I don't know if he was a customer or not. Usually customers come in and are holding like a paper list for the cars they want to check out. This guy had nothing in his hands. The way he walked was robotic. His arms were kept at his side, and he didn't sway when he walked. No shoulder movement. Just one leg forward, then the next. I don't think I even saw him blink the entire time I was faced to face with him.

Creepiest thing I've ever seen at work. I don't know who he is and I haven't seen him since.
