I’ve always been obsessed with abandoned places. Decaying structures, shattered windows, peeling paint—they speak of stories lost to time. That’s how I ended up in Pripyat, Ukraine, the ghost city frozen in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster. I told my friends I was going as a "dark tourist." They told me I was crazy.

I went anyway.

I booked a private tour, but when I arrived in Kyiv, my guide backed out. Said his wife was sick. Maybe she was. Maybe he was just another local who didn't mess with Pripyat after dark. I shrugged and went solo. I had GPS, a Geiger counter, extra batteries, water, and a GoPro.

On the first day, Pripyat was exactly what I’d imagined—haunting, beautiful, and terrifying. The Ferris wheel towered like a skeleton over rusted bumper cars. I wandered through crumbling schoolrooms, nature claiming chalk-covered floors. I even found old toys scattered in one corner.

But something was wrong.

The further I went from the city’s edge, the quieter it became. Not just quiet—empty. The birds stopped singing. Even my Geiger counter started acting funny. The static hiss would spike randomly, then fall silent. At one point, it beeped wildly for several seconds before abruptly shutting off.

I should’ve left then.

Instead, I pressed deeper. I wanted photos of the hospital—the one where the firefighters’ gear was discarded after the reactor explosion. That was the goal. That was the trophy.

I found it by dusk.

The entrance was half-buried in debris, and I had to crouch through a broken side door. The air felt heavier there. My flashlight beam danced over rusted beds, shattered vials, and collapsed ceiling panels. I made my way down a corridor, and that’s when I heard it.

A whisper.

I froze.

It wasn’t the wind. There was no wind in that hospital. The air was still and stale. But I swear I heard a whisper. Male. Desperate.

"Pomogite..." Help me.

I called out, even though every cell in my body screamed not to. “Hello? Is someone here?”

Silence.

I turned to leave. That’s when I saw the shadow.

It was at the end of the hallway. Tall. Human-like. But… wrong. It moved unnaturally, twitching as if flickering through bad reception. My flashlight hit it, and it vanished.

I ran.

I don’t remember how I got out of the building, only that I was sprinting down cracked streets under a dead sky. When I looked back, the hospital door was closed. I hadn’t closed it.

I didn’t stop running until I reached my car. I drove until I hit a main road. I slept in the back seat until sunrise, too shaken to move.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had followed me.

Back in Kyiv, I noticed things. My phone would unlock itself. I’d wake up with scratches down my back. I caught glimpses of someone standing in doorways—someone tall. Twitching. I moved hotels. It followed. On the flight home, a baby screamed the entire trip, her eyes locked on me the whole time.

Now I’m home, weeks later. But something came back with me.

I see it in reflections. In dreams. In the corners of my vision when I try to sleep.

I went to Pripyat chasing ghosts.

But one found me instead.

And it won’t let go.
