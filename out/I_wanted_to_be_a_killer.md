My name is Rowan gray and I want to tell you a story, 
when I was a little child around 9 years old I was stupid and innocent like for an example i used to think things like raining means clouds are crying, not really this because i knew the process of raining, I did not really have friends then, my stupidity and Innocence continued till I became 13 years old and when I became 15, I used to think that is this really me the same child that used to be so stupid and innocent? 

I didn't have access to internet untill 13 and after this I learnt many things from internet, like anime,gaming, some fun YouTubers who I loved to watch, creativity,funny videos,PORN,NUDITY, GORE,ABOUT SERIAL KILLERS ETC.

I was crazy about these things and I also loved to collect information and telling it to others, at school I had like 4 friends 2 out of four weren't that much good but 1 out of those 2 was the worst, I hated him the most, when we first met he was such a good friend but slowly it seemed he was so jealous of me and then at one point I was feeling his jealousy a little he also used to humiliate me Infront is little brother and others.

Also at my own home, my parents used to fought a lot sometimes but after fighting (of words) they used to become normal again, i hated this so much, at one point I was feeling that I won't even feel sadness if one of them dies.

Anyways, I was a little obsessed with bloody and gory things, I used to watch gore videos like this on a website name blood.com and not only human but animal gore also was available on that website, I also loved to read the biographies of serial killers like, Jeffery Dahmer and John Wayne Gacy and Ted Bundy etc.

I used to think what if I became a psychopath? what will happen to me, what will I do? but then I ignored it that no I can't become a serial killer because it's not right to kill people.

but after my parents continued to fight and keep becoming normal ruined my brain and I didn't know how to process that like they used to fight one day and the other day they were normal then again and again and AGAIN.

one night everyone was sleeping, I was thinking about doing something that I wanted to do for a long time, I picked up a sharp edged cleaver and went to the room of my parents, I stared at them for a bit but suddenly our electricity was turned off because of a short circuit, I ran to my room as quickly and sneaky as possible. 

And then I went to sleep, the next day I woke up and after having breakfast I started thinking about what I tried to do last nightz I was ashamed of it and never wanted to do it again.

I was 17 when that incident occured, and my birthday was also coming at October 17 so I was excited for it and I was also happy that my parents didn't fought for a long time. When the day I was born means my birthday came, I decorated the house and did the things that a birthday boy should do at his birthday I was so excited for the party that was going to happen at that night. 

I invited my that jealous friend too and those also who were good to me, when the cake was about to cut that friend of mine started insulting and humiliating me and he even insulted the cake that my father bought, before the cake was about to cut he already manipulated guests that me and my family are bad people by saying some shit stuff about us, and then when cake was about to cut and I was about to blow the candles he started shouting that my father is a scammer and he scams people to make money and then he spit on my cake, the guests after listening what he said were already going and that shit also left after ruining everything and guess what my parents started fighting as usual. 

I was so sad about today but also very angry, tomorrow I went to school and after school that friend and I met each other and he started abusing and humiliating me again Infront of others, I started beating him and biting him but then his friends threw me away and started beating me, they broke my left arm and broke my 4 teeth and also my nose.

when I came home my parents saw this I told them what happened and even the names of those who did this to me but when my father heard name John Warner he froze and said to me that he is the son of my boss and we can't do anything.

after listening this I went to my room and started crying, but then I decided to do something, at the dinner time my father called me for dinner when we were having dinner my father keep telling that I should apologize to his son and his boss, suddenly my father and mother started feeling that something is stuck in their neck and something was not letting them breathe.

I stood up and started laughing at them while they were in pure terror and looking at me and I told them I poisoned them and then they DIED.

After their death I buried their bodies in my garden and then I was feeling normal and relived like nothing happened.

 I murdered my parents and then I started planning on a revenge on my friend. i went to the house of my friends parents and sneaker in their room and because his father wasn't their so it was the best opportunity for me, I killer his mother by putting pressure on her neck by my hand and when she tried to scream I put a dirty clothe in her mouth and I killed her. 

when his father came and saw me besides the body of his wife, he froze.

after 10 seconds when he realized what happened he ran towards me with a knife but I already knew what to do so I shot in his head with my pistol.

then I went to the room of his sibling who was also sleeping, I came close to him and I woke him up and I started beating him because I was feeling pleasure from doing that, then I cut his hand off carefully so he won't lose much blood and then I broke his neck and he died.

when I checked the room of his parents again so I saw that his mother is still alive, I hit her in the head and she passed out and when she woke up I showed her the pictures of her husband and her little son. when she cried and screamed I felt pleasure.
 
After that I took a saw and started cutting her legs and then she passed out, but she woke up again and I was surprised how strong she is but I started cutting her legs even more quickly and this time she screamed so loud that my eardrum was about to rip.
and then she died.

after doing this I went to my home and sent pictures of this to my friend.

the next day police arrested me and I was sentenced to death
my last wish is to write this story and send this to my all friends and specially that one who humiliated me on my birthday, today I will be executed and now I can have peace.
