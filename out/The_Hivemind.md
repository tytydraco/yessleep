One day while going through my family's things that we really just keep in my grandpa's old study, I stumbled across what seemed to be study papers that my grandpa had wrote years back. These papers describe things I- well... it's not possible for these to be true, the papers I mean, they detail things such as the Amazon, and growth patterns, and maps covered with foliage in different spots. These didn't really belong with the others because... well they where relatively normal with the forrests around the world and climate. Yknow sundries among dust. 

Some background might help someone remember these theories. When we still lived in Houston among friends and family we got news that a relative of ours, Dr John La Von Rose, had passed. John, or as he made even family announce him as Dr John Rose was a shut in after the... Corpus Christi incident where he broke down over the gulf "not looking how I remembered" he said. Sad as this breakdown was we loved him still, but from a distance. When the bane of his mind eventually would take over we weren't shocked... he just wasn't himself, not fully anyway. After the news of his passing while in his bed as peacefully as he was brought into the world, we where told to look over his belongings in Munich, Germany. My friend you told me to tell you the truth, and I do when I say a ferry ride from Texas, my home and all I ever knew to Munich was long it was. The ride was torture at best, but we had to bring the truck so the thought is there. While drifting along the ocean i did realize how vastly void of vegetation the ocean really is... strikes me as exposed and quite honestly i hated it, as if some tentacle was gonna come and bring me down into the depths where i can prove that Chtulu is definitely at rest. Those beasts... nothing but a devilshly good story i like as much as the next guy. When we finally disembarked at the port of Munich we decided best to head to the house immediately.

Driving our old farm truck of an F-150 there, i did realize how in touch with it's surroundings Munich was, it was beautiful how the needle of these cottages pierces through the gardens and trees planted around, as though they're communicating with eachother in harmony. Pulling into the drive however was a contrast to this beautiful town, for John's Study was an eyesore. My family thought about his very presence in this way, any room quiet or loud the man would still boast about his findings in seed development and mutations in nature, and as if that wasn't a bore i wished to drown out with booze the man reeked of cheap wine and just a foul smell because he thought "they" would get him and find him in a shower. Man was insane.

So here I am now, the grandson of the narcissistic and personally acclaimed Dr John La Von Rose digging through his files trying to find out what might be fact or some cosmic horror thrill straight from his sick mind. Looking through files a piece took my attention and grabbed it by the throat. This piece was called "The Hivemind of Plai-Terra" I think it was a theory he made in his prime, 80's maybe early 90's when he had his episode. Taking it with me in my case, I decided to meet up with my dear Girlfriend Bailey at a local caf√© we found on John's calendar. He frequented there, and when I walked in I chatted with the lady behind the bar. She was a lady maybe about as young as us and was drained, but kind " Hi there"

"Hi, welcome in what can I get you?"

"Just two espressos, black with a touch of cinnamon"

"Oh! That reminds me of a regular we had... really is sad, heard he passed recently he was a really kind, but confused old man"

"Yeah, I know him. John Rose right? I'm his grandson Loren, and this is my Girlfriend Bailey"

"Well it's nice to meet you guys, sorry about your loss he was a good soul"

"...With a hint of crazy maybe..."

Bailey kicked me, and I mouthed her "what?" And she just gave me that look...

"Hey come on, your just like him and your not crazy. Heck thats his favorite spot on the bar"

Having to wait a minute, and staying with our coffee too I pull out that folder, The Hivemind theory one.

"Oh? What's that babe?"

"Nothing much, just looking at how sick he really was. Its called..."

Had to hide my lack of care from Bailey, I love her but she's like a hound dog of emotion.

"...The Hivemind of Plai-Terra"

"Oooo sounds Sci-fi"

"Yeah true, can't argue that. Who knows maybe he thought he was Lovecraft" I remarked "Oh be nice, he was still your grandpa after all. Quit being a cold and miserable dick"

She is right, I should ease up a bit, I mean I've wanted to visit Germany for some time now I wouldn't wanna spoil a whole country just from an old loon i'm related to. Though I think loon is a bit nice, and the first few pages are a red herring. They boldly claim:


"The scariest thing of our society is that of when we achieve higher technology and what we see as understanding, is seen as, to many an arrogant way of going about washing our hands. We seem to know "more" with our high technological goodies, but in fact we have even less of an open mind as the generation before, and them before. To most things nonhuman in nature, we are but an ignorant speck in the dot of space, naive to what may lie on even our own planet; crossing multiple things and set equations that we don't seem to think outside of the equations, or the boxes, because we know we're right where many others could also be: Arrogance
The not knowing or wanting to try something that would be an uncanny mixture or touch, because it would be seen as dull and useless as the shades of black and white of the world in 1983: Ignorance

To see in the teachings of a crazy man to prove how wrong we really are, how arrogant and ignorant he was until he realized he had unspoken and unimaginably created a thing; a Living, breathing society inside that of a living being's mind through its multiple hosts like a PC, or computer room. He had been arrogant in his ways, thinking he was best until his study would come to something along the lines of a sudden extermination long due realizing the vastness of our Naive nature to the void of night.

The man that was known to me as a personality passerby, someone you know you won't forget off of sheer memory alone. I was sitting in this extravagant yet simple and small foyer of a chic restaurant where I heard a conversation from a man with the thought of how his lawn had reacted primitively to the crimson splat of an unfortunate animal lost. O how he swore the lawn was alive, how it spored with life and pulsed of thought, the impossible was seen as the disturbed possible in which logic defies the walls of the world. Seemingly desperate in his way to neutralize the impurity upon our world, for it is only different any other time but of now, now he feared for the life in which we literally looked down upon had complete control over the dwelling in which his pedigreed family lived on for generations, with the taste of blood it seemed as he put it "more or less tasted of the fruit of the forbidden tree still embedded deep within us, from the first sin unto the world these plants now understand the world they share in the O so twisted way an ill person seems to look onto the world. The plants will be our third riech to the battle of the grasses"

Ha, okay Grandpa I'll bite, your arrogance is clear, but really an invasion of plants? They've been here you just never saw them. This is rock bottom though

"The lord of plants is restless."

We finished our shots after a nice time chatting, then decided to head home for now. When we got home I went straight to my grandpa's study yet again, and after skimming that paper I'm digging for the second part... none of his paper would make sense if it was real. It's impossible. They've never not been here...?
