Two weeks ago, my phone rang while I sat on the couch passing time by watching another boring Netflix show trending in the United States. As my eyes remained on the screen, I felt a buzz on my lap coming from my phone. It was my mother calling. I slid my finger across the bottom of the screen, my ears met suddenly by violent sobs. I raised the phone to my ear and through the feeling of panic asked my mother what was going on. Through heart-wrenching sobs, my mother managed to tell me that my father had died of a sudden heart attack just hours earlier. I entered a state of immediate shock. My phone slipped from my hand and landed on the carpet beneath my feet. I sat in silence for a few moments before reaching down with a shaky hand to grab the phone.

I tried to muster the strength to console my distressed mother, but the revelation of my father's death had silenced the portion of my brain responsible for coherent speech. Before I could say anything my mother told me a friend was at the door and she needed to let her in. I managed to squeeze in a feeble "I love you" before the call ended and I was thrust into a painful silence.

I had never been super close with my father, and I wouldn't call the relationship we had textbook either. We never threw a football on the front lawn, never took father-son bonding trips, and never had common interests. Regardless of our relationship, my father did everything he could to provide for our family. He never hit my mother or me, seldom drank in excess, and provided all we needed. I blame part of our lack of a legitimate relationship on his work, and the time it demanded of him.

During my childhood, my father was always coming and going, and seldom was he home on the weekends. He had started and grown a successful lumber and trucking logistics business, which by no means was an easy feat. It had taken him over ten years to deem his business successful, but he did reach that milestone. However, eight of those ten years were the first eight years of my childhood, so my mother and I suffered as a byproduct of his overwhelming success. I don't blame him though, and am thankful for the life he gave me through his hard work.

The age gap between my mother and father also contributed to our distant relationship. My father was twenty years older than my mother. They met when he was thirty eight and she was eighteen. I recall the shock I felt when I understood the concept of age and in turn the gap in their relationship. In their defense the society they got married in was much more relaxed than the society we live in today. This age gap meant that when I was born my father was forty one and my mother was twenty one. By the time I was ten, my father was fity one and my mother was thirty one. There were many things my father and I couldn't connect on due to the age difference, but I still saw him as a good man and a hard working father.

I was surprised by the numbness that coursed through me as I sat on the couch, the brief conversation I had with my mother still lingering on the forefront of my mind. I though the news of my father's passing would hit me harder, but the distant relationship I had with him only allowed me to feel so much. I hadn't seen my father or mother in over a year, having left home to pursue a job opportunity in the land of opportunity, also known as Texas. I had gotten a job working for a company owned by an eccentric billionaire, known for recently buying the "little" social media company whose logo in the past was a bird. This job kept me grounded in Texas, and for the first year I worked there, time off was something I longed for daily. My schedule was in the hands of my superiors which left me with no say in the matter. This forced me to adapt to life alone, and before long I thought little of home and my parents still living there.

Coming back from a sudden daze, I managed to get off the couch, my body still reeling from shock. The floor was cold on my feet and I walked to the kitchen, heading to the fridge to scour for food. After a few minutes of searching, I managed to force down some leftovers from a failed date the night before, the food lacking the distinct flavor I remembered from the previous night. Mentally and physically exhausted, I checked in early for the night well aware of the painful process soon to unfold. With my eyes closed, and my mind reaching autopilot, the emotional toll that comes with death hit me, regret for the distance I had placed between my parents and myself settled in as I tried my best to fade into sleep.

My struggles over the next week were frequent and intense. I would catch myself angry at coming to this place, angry at not having called my dad more often, angry that I didn't get the chance to build an actual relationship with him. Life felt unfair, and I wished the bad hand I'd been dealt could be folded. It was almost too much trying to balance work and the death of my father, but the anguish my mother was experiencing propelled me through the funeral planning, and into my seat on a plane headed for home.

After reaching our plane's cruising altitude, I leaned back in my chair and drifted into a light sleep. The shudders of wheels touching down on the tarmac broke my sleep as I sat up and realized we had landed in Seattle Washington. The airport was empty, with a few travelers sitting at restaurants or booking it to their gate. A driver was waiting for me outside the baggage claim, and as I approached he signaled for my bags, grabbing them and gently placing them into his trunk.

My childhood home was forty five minutes from the airport, which forced me to try and make small talk with my driver. I'd never been good at it, but to my surprise, we managed to keep the level of awkwardness to a minimum. He extended his condolences to me and proceeded to tell me that he had only just started working for our family but had grown found of my father rather quickly. He mentioned how kind he was, and how well my father had treated him. This story, told to me by a stranger, made it seem like he had more of a relationship with my father than I did, his very own son. It hurt to think of how little I knew about my father, but as he lay in a mortuary somewhere, the time to reconcile with him was far gone.

My driver brought the car to a stop outside a large wrought iron fence, adorned with my family's insignia, a bronze hedgehog. Reaching out the window, he clicked a small red button attached to a black box. There was a loud *CREAK* as the fence swung open on its hinges, unlocking the inner sanctum that was my childhood home.

My mother was the first thing I saw when I stepped out of the car and faced the front of the house. She was crying, her arms wrapped around her torso, as she often placed them there to provide a sense of comfort. A tinge of sorrow struck my heart, her feeble figure cowering under loss and grief. With a heavy heart, I strode towards my mother and embraced her in a firm hug. She began to cry harder, shaking between my arms, and soon my tears flowed as well.

Our hug lasted longer than I thought it would, before my driver grabbed the bags and brought them inside. I followed my mom into the vast living room, plopping down on the couch that sat positioned in front of the fire. The house was beautiful. It felt like a playground, created and made to be fit for a king. As a child with my father seldom around, I would wander the vast expanse of this place, my imagination taking hold of me. One morning I would be in Egypt, ruling as wise benevolent Pharaoh, and then later that same day i would be in a rocket ship headed for the moon. There were a million things to do in this house, and for someone with a grand imagination, there were endless ways to pass the time.

I reminisced on those days, the joy I felt no longer within my heart. I enjoyed the fire, and the peace of the room. The couch I sat on had the perfect mixture of firm and soft, which brought me to a state of relaxation, the fatigue from travel setting in.

A brief moment passed before my mother's voice drew me back to the confines of the living room.

"Aaron honey, your room is ready upstairs. If you want to go lay down there dinner will be served in an hour. How are you feeling?"

"I can't explain, I'm not sure. I miss my father, but you know that our relationship was strained. Something is missing, I feel the hole, but I thought I would be hurting more than I am."

"I understand." she replied her eyes straying towards the flames of the fire. "I know the relationship with your father was distant. It hurt to see how little you two interacted, I wish I would have tried harder to push your father to build that relationship with you. I'm sorry Aaron".

Keeping my tone light I replied, "Yeah I know, something was *always* more important than me."

I felt anger boiling up inside me, this house in all its glory and the success my father so dearly craved were two of the many things more important to him than me. I was left on the back burner, forgotten and neglected. The look on my mother's face before she spoke, made it clear that she saw the anger I harbored towards him.

"I know you are angry, and you deserve to feel that way. Just promise me you'll respect his legacy, and let the bygones be bygones on the day of the funeral. Can you do that for me?"

I caught a tinge of sorrow in her voice, and felt bad for letting my anger show. To ease her pain I replied "I promise, I won't let anything I'm feeling show."

However, as the words left my mouth, I felt as if that might be difficult to do. There was a storm inside of me, always had been, but the death of my father had progressed that storm to a hurricane. I was cracking around the edges, once more falling into the never-ending cycle of self-pity and detrimental thoughts.

My mother left the living room, and after the fire became uncomfortably warm, I headed up the large wooden stairs banking right down the hall at the top headed straight for my childhood bedroom. As I opened the door, I felt a wave of nostalgia. It looked the same as I remember, the light blue walls always brought me comfort whenever I would see them. Even now, ten years since I had last lived in this room, I felt that familiar sense of comfort.

Proceeding to unpack the few belongings I brought with me, my emotions swirled through my head like a churning river. I felt unease, which was a strange emotion to have. I was a fairly confident person, but being back here where I had been alone for so many years made me feel like a child again. I felt my mind wander as I emptied the designer bag my parents had sent me as a birthday gift years ago when I first moved out. Memories of my childhood were projected into my mind's eye like a projector in a theater, drawing me into the inner recesses of my mind.

Our house had a private chef, and the meal he had prepared for my mother and me was fettuccine alfredo. Italian food held a special place in my heart, my love for it has grown significantly after our family trip to Rome. Dinner was silent, apart from the occasional conversation about my job, or what I’ve been up to since I moved away from the area. It was obvious my mother was struggling, but I didn’t know how I could help her. I wasn’t Victor Frankenstein, and couldn’t bring my father back to life, but maybe over time, I could help her heal. 

The rest of the evening passed as exhaustion took hold of me. I made my way upstairs and crawled into bed, the memory foam mattress supporting my body, dragging me away from reality and into the realm of dreams. The melodic chirping of birds adjacent to my ear roused me with ease, as the first rays of sun came through the window and lit up my face. I was feeling stable this morning, the emotional spit I had the other night had come and gone. The floor was cold against the bottom of my feet as I meandered around my room, attempting to replicate the morning routine I had at home. *Jeans and a gray Nike t-shirt would have to do for an outfit* I thought briefly as I reached into my closet. I care far too little about what I wear and often don’t even think before I dress. I just don’t understand the importance of making everything I wear match, why waste time doing that when I can grab a generic t-shirt and some jeans and call it a day? 

Dressed and ready to down a cup of coffee, I pulled open my bedroom door and let the smell of breakfast wafting through the house guide me into the kitchen. Bacon, eggs, pancakes, and sausage lay spread out across the kitchen table. My mom was already in her usual seat, reading a newspaper, though in reality, she was merely glancing at it. 

"Morning Aaron, how'd the night of sleep treat you?" she said placing the newspaper next to the plate infront of her.

"Honestly mom, I slept better than I thought I would. Woke up feeling refreshed and emotionally a lot better." I replied, as I sat myself down in the chair cross from her. "How about you?"

"Sleep?" she said a half scoff in her voice. "I haven't slept in days. Too much going on in my head."

Her eyes were glossy, the lack of sleep visible in the dark bags collecting beneath her eyes.

"It was just so unexpected you know? One second your father and I were laughing and enjoying ourselves, and the next he was dead on the bathroom floor. It doesn't feel fair, why me? Why him?"

I hesitated unsure of what to say. Tears filled my mother's eyes as she reached for her coffee with a shaky hand. My mom was struggling to cope with loss, and I was no better help to her than she was to herself.

"I wish I could help, I do. But sadly there isn't a quick fix to this. It's gonna take time mom, you just need to hold in there. Okay?"

"You're right. I'll see if I can get some of those sleep pills prescribed to me. That should do the trick."

The half-hearted tone in her voice wasn't helping to boost my confidence. I reached for the food laid out on the table in front of me, and filled my plate. Looking back at my mother, I paused before saying. 

"Be careful with those pills, they are only a temporary solution to a much bigger problem. I know from experience." 

"I won't use them for long honey, I promise. I just need to get through the funeral. That whole process is going to take a lot out of me." 

I nodded in response and continued to eat my food. While I chewed, I thought about what the funeral might be like, my mind seeing hundreds of people there, all coming to pay their respects. I continued to think, the comfort of a wandering mind relaxing the tense muscles of my body. My mom stood up from the table and said she would be in the garden if I need her. I gave her a simple "okay", and continued to let my mind take me away. 

After a while, I stood up from my chair and stretched, loosening the stiff joints I carried every morning when I woke up. Dropping my plate in the sink, I headed upstairs to check some emails and ensure I was up to date with work. I wanted to step away from the job when I was here fully, but I also knew that letting things pile up would lead to stress when I arrived home. There were ten emails I had to respond to, and though I didn’t feel like opening them, I clicked on the first one and began to type. 

I hit send on the last email, which was for my boss before I closed the laptop and slid it back into my bag. It was late morning, and I wasn’t sure what I needed to do today. Many things would need to get done within the next few weeks but one thing at a time, right? I ignored the load of things I needed to do with my mother and instead opted to spend a few hours in my father’s study, a place I had visited only once before. 

His study was in the back portion of the house, hidden away by two large oak doors that were always locked and required a key to open. I had tried many times as a kid to search the house for the key, the mystery of what lay behind those doors was my motivation, but I never found what I was looking for. However, on my thirteenth birthday, my father took me upstairs and brought me into his study. It was stunning. Large wooden shelves overflowed with books, and warm soothing light lit the space.

It was by far the biggest room in the house, and the most luxurious. The floors were wooden and glossy as if no one had ever walked on them before. The memories of my first time in his study flooded back to me as I approached the wooden doors I had just seen in my head. To my surprise, the door handle turned and the large wooden doors opened this room shrouded in secret. 

The study looked the same as the last time I visited it. I had seen the same magnificent floors, tall shelves, and lush seats only once before, but their familiarity brought about an intense sense of comfort. I aimlessly wandered around the room, intrigued by everything that had been put on display. There were so many trinkets, decorations, sculptures, paintings, and books. There were hundreds of them. Everywhere I looked there were books, and I couldn’t even begin to imagine how much they had cost to purchase. As I perused the shelves reading the titles on the spines, I stopped abruptly in front of a small red book that read, *Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.* 

*Reindeer? Why does my father have a book about Rudolph the Reindeer?* I laughed out loud at the image of my father sitting in one of the room's elegant chairs, the small red book resting in his hands. He was always a serious man, and children’s stories were the last thing I thought he would have enjoyed reading, but to each their own I guess. I left my spot in front of the book and headed toward the back of the room where my father’s large Mahogany desk occupied the vast space in front of the back windows. 

The desk had countless drawers lining its frame, each previously locked but now open for inspection. There weren’t any interesting items in the first few drawers I dug through, but as I opened the bottom drawer I noticed sheets of newspaper faded with age. The first sheet I grabbed was dated *April 11, 1968,* and on the front page was a picture of my dad, holding a plague that read *Washington State’s Most Successful Businessman*. Seeing my dad young, his features bright and bursting with life felt strange. I only knew him as the reserved, quiet, and serious old man posing as my father while this man here looked energetic, excited, and powerful. The article beneath the photo was a piece on my father's success and how he had managed to grow not one, but two businesses to worth over eight figures. I scanned it briefly before sliding it back into the first spot in the drawer and reached for a sheet in the middle of the bunch. I immediately noticed that the headline had nothing to do with my father or his success, but instead reminded me of something you’d see in a true crime junkies collection. In large bold letters, almost jumping from the page, I read the following message.

***The Reindeer Ripper Claims his Fifth Victim!*** 

*The Reindeer Ripper, who the hell is that?* My eyes quickly darted to the text beneath, detailing the discovery of yet another victim, whose untimely death came at the hands of this sadistic killer. From what I gathered, in the 1970s there had been a serial killer preying upon women in the Seattle area, predominantly targeting women whose occupation required them to spend their nights awaiting “company”. 

His MO had come from the way law enforcement found the victims, their bodies positioned in different ways, each with a large red dot on the tip of their nose. This red dot, upon further investigation had been deemed as their blood, and almost resembled a crude attempt at recreating the famous red nose of Rudolph. This connection was what had gotten the mystery killer his name, and the reporter writing the article had done a good job of painting the brutal picture left behind by the killer. 

I flipped the page over to look at the back but all I saw was another short article written about my father, and his “booming industry”.  As I read through this article, I noticed a section from the local police thanking my father for his “generous donations and involvement with the first responders. Without hesitation, I dropped the sheet back into his spot and kicked the drawer shut. My body sank into the chair behind the desk as I pulled out my phone and opened google to see what information there was on this Reindeer Ripper. 

Within a few searches, I had found a wiki page dedicated to this *Reindeer Ripper*. The page was short and didn't seem to have too much information on this obscure and elusive killer. I understood that ten murders had been linked to his actions, but the actual number was still unknown. He was active for a ten year period, killing one victim every year around the same time. Winter was his go to season, likely do to the cold since Washington winters forced everyone in doors. His M.O. which led to his name, was a distinct red dot on the victims nose, turning it red like the fictional character Rudolph we all loved as kids and this macabre connection to childhood memories, and brutal murder brought a shiver down my spin.

I opened and scrolled through a few more articles hoping there was some information on who this killer might have been. Article after article repeated the same information. Then out of nowhere I struck gold. At the bottom of an article was a hyperlink titled, Click Here for More Information. Opening the link sent me to a Reddit post within a community titled Unsolved Murders and Mysteries, and the sheer amount of traction this post had gotten intrigued me. Many different threads were happening simultaneously in the comments beneath the initial post, discussing motives, actual number of victims, and possible suspects.  

The original post outlined information found within declassified police documents, highlighting the profile developed by a special Serial Killer Task Force. A direct quote from the head of the Task Force read “White male, 5’10 - 6’0 feet tall, wealthy/prominent figure, knowledge of police protocol, single with the ability to disappear flawlessly.” I finished reading the documents, and though I had some images now of what the killer might have looked like, my itch to start the rabbit hole only grew in its power. 

I had originally planned to wander outside and look for my mother who was likely in her Garden, but the hidden newspapers describing a phantom killer drew me into the recesses of the vast study. I closed the bottom drawer of my father’s desk, and leaned back in his elegant leather chair letting myself take a moment to think. 

After processing the strange discovery I had made, I stood up from the chair and pushed it back into its resting place under the desk. The wheels on the chair made a slight squeak as it came to rest back in its original position. Heading towards the doors I had entered from, I stopped to glance once more at the small red book on the shelf. The name of the killer and the book about Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer gave me an uneasy feeling as I approached the shelf. And that's when I noticed something I hadn't before. The book seemed far more worn than any of the other countless books lining the massive shelves. Its edges were faded and torn, and gave the impression that this book had been read and held often. 

My fingers clasped themselves around the edge of the book, and as I pulled it off the shelf, the empty space left behind exposed a small red button built into the wooden shelf.  It took me a few moments to understand what I was looking at, but I didn’t need to be a rocket scientist to see that this button led to a place well hidden by the intentions of my father. A single low *CLICK* pierced the silent dimenor of the room as my finger pushed the button into the grooves of the shelf. Like a scene out of a murder mystery movie, a small section of the shelf slowly swung outwards revealing a long dark corridor untouched and practically calling me into its depths. 

The walls of the corridor were smooth and made from concrete. A slight smell hung in the air as I walked deeper into the darkness. The light from the opening I had entered through was beginning to fade, and my vision was limited, which forced  me to wave my arms in front of me. I walked slowly cautious of my surroundings, on occasion turning back to see the light spilling onto the entrance of this passageway. 

As the thought of *How much farther does this go?* crossed my mind, my hands touched a smooth surface in front of where I stood. Feeling it over, I came upon a handle realizing in the moment, that this was a door. I tried the handle and to my surprise, the cold steel moved and with little effort I pulled the door open. 

The space behind the door was hidden by the dark, and instinctively I reached for the wall next to the door frame in hopes of locating a switch. My fingers brushed past thin hard plastic, and as I flipped the switch, a small bulb embedded into the concrete ceiling lit the space I now peered into. The room was far smaller than what I had first expected. Along the walls were large metal shelves with boxes, lots and lots of boxes. In the corner was a monitor with a VHS player wired into it. Expecting dust to coat everything, I lifted my shirt over my face creating a rudimentary mask, memories of the virus from 2020 and the mask mandate suddenly coming to the forefront of my mind. Shaking the thoughts, I stepped into the middle of the room and turned to face the shelf on my left. 

The boxes were placed neatly, their arrangement seemed random but also calculated. I reached for the lid of the first box and lifted it, looking down to see an empty space, except for a single VHS tape with a small piece of paper taped to the front of it. With the tape out of the box and in my hands it’s age could be felt by the fragile nature of it. Then with my interest growing, I read the note which had the name “Brianna” printed on it in big bold letters. I had the urge to walk over to the VHS player and insert the tape but something else wanted me to continue exploring the boxes before I saw the content of the first tape. 

The second box’s contents were practically identical to the first, a single VHS tape sat at the bottom, but as I read the note, I realized the difference. This time there was a different name on the note. “Jamie” I read on the note, and as I set the VHS tape down,  a sense of unease washed over me. The search through box after box yielded the same results. A single VHS tape and a name, different each time. After what felt like only five minutes, but was closer to thirty minutes I had emptied all the boxes. There were around thirty tapes now sitting next to the VHS player. I hadn’t set them there neatly and had just thrown them down as I dug through the boxes in a frenzy. 

Turning to face the tapes, I picked one up at random, and stood with it in front of the monitor. The name on this tape was “Clarissa” and as I went to slide it into the vhs player I stopped. Something deep down was begging me not to open this unnerving version of Pandora’s Box. However, there wasn’t going to be anything stopping me now from figuring out what significance this hidden room and the collection of tapes held. Lowering the tape into the slot, I watched as the tape slid into the player and disappeared from sight. The monitor remained blank as I waited for the tape to register, my neck beginning to go cold with sweat. 

A static sound filled the small room as the monitor came to life and the beginning of the tape appeared on the screen. The first thing I saw was a small dark room, lit only by the light coming from the camera. Dirt lined the floor and walls, and in the middle of the room only slightly visible was an old box spring mattress. The static continued in the background as the tape played, until a low whimper broke the silence. A man, average height with a black ski mask and suit on entered the frame dragging behind him a young woman.

I gasped and backed away from the monitor. Frozen by fear, I watched as the man tossed the woman onto the mattress and moved to place the camera closer to the scene of action. With the camera closer to the woman, I could now make out bruises, cuts, and two very swollen eyes on the woman who lay in a fetal position on the mattress. A few minutes passed as the camera stayed trained on the woman, no discernable movement coming from her. Then faintly I heard the familiar tune of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. The sound, at first faint, was growing louder and more pronounced as the man now drew closer to the camera. I watched in horror as the man entered the frame, carrying with him a rusted ax with a wooden handle and a cassette player that blared the familiar tune. The woman’s screams continued to echo through the mic on the camera, mixing with the innocent tune coming from the cassette player. In one fluid motion I watched the man raise the ax far above his head, and before its glistening blade could make impact with the woman cowering beneath it, I snapped out of my terrified trance and slammed my finger into the vhs player's eject button. The tape slid out of the box under the monitor and sat there waiting for me to pick it up. 

Frozen in place, I stared down at the vhs tape and the monitor resting atop the player. My heart raced as sweat dripped down my neck and into the shirt I wore. *What did I just witness?* I thought as my mind attempted to produce an explanation as to what I had just found. The music, the woman screaming, the man's laughter, and the image of the ax raised above the woman were etched into my mind. I looked around me at the stack of tapes, realization hitting me like a freight train. Each of these tapes had the story of a woman, captured, held against her will, and then killed. All to feed the hunger of a sick man. That sick man, the one who murdered innocent people was my father. No matter how I tried to rationalize the inevitable, I knew the truth had exposed itself. I had stumbled upon the trophies of the Reindeer Killer, and not knowing it at first, had in turn exposed the darkest secret my father or this family had ever held. 

I felt the sudden urge to let out a scream. Not out of fear, though I did feel that, but out of anger. I was betrayed, lied to, and also raised by a man who had killed at least thirty women, maybe more. A guttural roar left my lips as I swept my arm across the table in front of me, sending the monitor, vhs player, and pile of tapes crashing to the floor. The secrets of a man I once called my father now lay on the floor in front of me as I stared down at them through blurred eyes. Tears were streaming down my face, and heavy sobs rocked my torso. I turned toward the door behind me and sauntered out of the room, not caring to flick off the light. Now in the hallway, I turned around once more, looking at the contents of the room and the tapes laying all over the floor. This was the last time I was going to walk down this hall and enter that room, I was finished and the hatred I had felt for my father only grew as I exited the hall and walked back into his study. 

The passage was still open between the bookshelves it had been hidden behind. I stood now facing it, unsure as to what I should do next. I had the urge, an uncontrollable urge, to go tell my mother. Tell her everything, withholding no details surrounding the story I had just uncovered. But as I processed the emotions I was feeling, I knew that exposing her to this truth would only harm her and could even kill her. She was fragile my mother, reeling from grief and despair, all alone in this massive house built by the money of a vicious serial killer. Pushing the bookshelf back into place, I covered the passageway hiding it again from the minds of the innocent. With the little red book back in place, I exited the study and without thinking found myself in bed, staring at the ceiling. 

*I won’t tell my mother, she can’t know. This would be too much for her* I thought as my eyes remained fixed on the tall ceiling of my childhood bedroom. *How did this ever happen, was my father always this evil? Did my mother know?* The thoughts continued to eb and flow through my brain, as I felt tears forming again. I was never going to call that man my father ever again, his name and legacy didn’t deserve to be honored, nor should a funeral be held in his name. But no matter how much I wanted to expose him and let the world know how evil he was, I knew that it would bring about no good. Like the saying goes, *some secrets are best kept hidden*. 

The last few articles of clothing I had brought with me on this trip were stuffed into the bag on my bed, its contents disorganized and far from folded. I had woken from a nap about an hour earlier in a cold sweat, nausea was crossing through me. I realized that this house, my room, and the beauty built by my fathers fortune was all too much for me. I wouldn’t be attending his funeral, wouldn’t be giving my mother much of an explanation, and wouldn’t be staying here another night. So as I zipped up my bag and threw it over my shoulder, my time in this home came to a close. I planned to never come here again, knowing who my father was would be too much for me to handle. I had produced my own fate, and let my curiosity get the best of me. I knew now why my father never wanted us in his study, and if you had told me this was the reason why I would have said you were sick and needed help. But here I was the product of a killer destined to hours, months, and years of therapy. 

The trip back to home to Texas was a blur. Between exhaustion, the pain of packing up and leaving my mother alone, and the fear that she might find what lies in the study was enough of a combination to put me in a catatonic state. To be honest the first few weeks back on the job were just as much of a blur, and I  didn’t feel myself coming out of it till I began my therapy. I have been in therapy now for over two months, and this account and story of the truth were the suggestion of my therapist. I didn’t want to address it, afraid that by doing that I would be making the memories far more real than they already felt. 

However, here I am writing these last few sentences. Will I ever be okay? I can’t say for sure. But I know that I no longer have a father alive and I no longer have a father in my mind. The man who I found hidden behind the walls of the study couldn’t have been the man that raised me, and as I let this truth out for the world to see, I hope that this can be a warning to those who think they know everything about the loved ones around them. ***Keep a wary eye, and know that people, even those you love and cherise, can be evil and twisted, truly capable of anything.***
