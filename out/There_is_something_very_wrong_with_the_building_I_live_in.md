Okay, so this will sound stupid. I think I should say that right away. Save some poor souls from reading. For those that are bored enough or curious enough, here's the deal, straight to the point: I think that part of the building I live in is deliberately closed off. I also think there are people there.



Before you start to judge me, I'd like to say that I'm not delusional, on drugs, or terminally stupid. That's my self assessment. Yours might vary, but let's start with the clean sheet, and you can form your opinion as you read on. I think that is a fair deal.



So, about the building. First, it's not old at all. It was built barely 11 years ago, in a part of the city that's been rapidly expanding for a few decades now. Nobody died while it was erected (yes, I checked), no older houses were torn down in the process (I checked that as well), and there are no native burial mounds or toxic landfills 'round these parts. Ghosts would presumably need more time to move in and start haunting, so that's out of question too. What we have is modern seven stories high building, in a rough shape of a semi-circle. Straight part is facing towards the boulevard; circular towards a common park area. There are 11 apartments per floor, numbered as if someone started to build a hotel and then changed their mind - first floor apartments are all hundreds, second floor two hundreds, and so on. When I moved in, maybe one fifth of all apartments had someone living in them. I don't think it's much different now. That means you get to know people quickly. It also means quiet and peace most of the time, and no que for the elevator. Well, elevators. There are two of them. 



Elevators. If I were observant, that should have been my first clue. Everyone uses the elevator on the left. One on the right exists, but I have never seen anyone get in or get out of it. There are no buttons on it, and at first I figured it must be for the 'exclusive' part of the building, you know, one of those where you need a special keycard that you touch to the panel and elevator authenticates you via some it bullshit. Doors part, you step in, and it takes you to your amazing apartment, just like in the movies. Well, it doesn't do that. How do I know? I put a frigging wireless camera and recorded that elevator for days. No one came in or came out of it. Funny thing is, elevator still moved up and down. I know. Going through the pain of getting a wireless camera, installing it in the dead of the night, masking it so it looks like yet another light fixture... that doesn't give much credence to my assertion about not being crazy. In my defense, I'd call that perseverance, willingness to go a step further, ingenuity. And apparently I have a problem with sticking to a clear timeline, since the elevator issue comes up later in the story. My mind wanders. I'm sorry. 



It started with whispers. Month, or maybe two passed since I've moved in. By then, everything was set up, and I was building a nice, comfortable, mind numbing routine. I work remotely, for a company in a completely different time zone, so most days I'm up until 4 or 5am. At first, I used to leave my TV on, but I found it distracting and started to work without it blaring in the background. That's when I first heard the whispers. I think it was around 3am, but I'm not really sure anymore.



I distinctly heard two voices whispering, a woman and a man. My first reaction was annoyance, thinking I forgot to turn off my TV. I turned towards it, and became aware of two things at the same time. TV screen was black, and whispers were coming from somewhere behind me.

I got goosebumps. 

Without moving, I tried to focus and listen. I couldn't make out a single word. Just a flow of conversation, two conspirators exchanging information, hurried at one time; slow and stuttering at other. It reminded me of dry fingers dragging across pieces of paper, and I swear that for a moment I actually felt that on my fingertips. I turned around, not without a great deal of effort to stay calm, and the sound stopped. I felt physical relief. Took a breath. Became aware of how fast my heart was beating. I even tried a laugh, as if it was funny how easily I allowed myself to be spooked. It came out feeble and fake.

I didn't do any more work that night. Before I went to bed, I settled on a theory that what I heard were people in the apartment next to mine. Yes, it was strange to hear them whisper, since the walls were solid and I never heard them before; but it was probably just a quirk of ventilation or something along those lines. I said all those lies to myself and managed to fall asleep.



Which is what I should be doing right now, when I think of it. There are parts of night that I do not want to go through awake these days. I'll write more soon, and maybe I'll ramble less, god willing.
