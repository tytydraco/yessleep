My dad has always been of and odd dad to me, he never really was present for most of my life and anytime I saw him, he looked lifeless.

But one day I got a call from my dad saying that it was best for me to not come over to his house for the week. Since my parents are split they made a parenting plan for days and holidays to see me.

I had thought little of this call since I thought my dad was drunk or something, but this call was different. He sounded very shaken up and couldn't keep his words straight.

I tried asking him if he was ok and needed help but he kept repeating the words "Don't come Giselle" I was terrified but with what little words I could form, I told him I wouldn't come.

After that he hung up, and I called my mom and told her of the strange call from my dad and understandably she was shaken up by it too.

A couple of days passed by and I decided to call my dad and ask if he was ok, but when I called him it went straight to voicemail. I called him another 2 times to just get voicemail everytime.

I decided to drive to his house which was 20 minutes from where my mom lived, when I got there I knocked on the door and saw that my dad was inside with a gun in hand watching the window.

I was scared when I saw him bolt to the door with his gun tuned aimed at me, he noticed it was me and had told me it wasn't safe while grabbing me and pulling me inside.

He told me that I needed to leave and never come back to see him since it could be bad if I show up.

When I asked him what was going on and why he had a gun he would just change the subject back to how unsafe it was in the house.

Just then he had accepted that I wasn't going and decided to head to the kitchen drawer and grab something, what i saw him grab is a piece of paper that said quote

"If you dont give us our shit back, we will kill your kids without a second thought Andrew."

(Andrew being my dads name) when he showed me that I felt a cold breeze hit my body, the whole room had gone quiet.

Just as I had finished accepting the contents of the note, my dad heard a car pull up into my dads small hand built "Shop" and one of his friends jumps out and starts unloading a bunch of tools and other small stuff.

My dad panicked and ran down to the shop and told his friend to fuck off but his friend was oddly insistent on staying and unloading the tools.

As my dad started arguing with his friend, I saw a bright red Honda pull into the shop and from my view I saw a tall man step out of the car with 2 other men and they started unloading rounds at my dad and his friend. 

I took cover without a second thought and I decided to head to my dad's room to get away from the windows in the living room (which overlooked the driveway and the "shop")

When I got into the room I was going to call the cops or my mom or hell anyone to get my out of that house but I had realized 

My phone is in my car and my dad has his..
