(Names have naturally been altered to equivalents for my protection, though I'm not sure what good it'll do at this point.)   
  
Do you ever think about what the versions of you in other universes might be doing? I do. When I woke up after experimenting with drugs to my roommate shaking me and crying, “Don’t die,” repeatedly, I thought about a universe in which I didn’t. When the car on the way to my honeymoon lost control, hit the up-mountain side of the road, and flipped over, I crawled out of the window, thinking about a universe in which we hit the down-mountain side. When I stayed at a remote cabin in the woods to go skiing with an online friend, and we had a great time, I thought about a universe in which I’d experienced a much darker ski trip.

I rarely think about the other universes, though. The universes in which Judah didn’t kill himself. The universes in which my marriage didn’t fail. The universes in which I was born with a brain that made and processed all its neurotransmitters properly and in the correct amounts. 

In real life, I like to hear about other people’s good fortune when I’m at my lowest. It makes me feel good to know that, even if my own life is worthless, others have found meaning and happiness. 

To think about other versions of myself experiencing the same, though, is just depressing to me. I prefer to focus on the fact that this universe is one in which I’ve managed to get this far rather than focus on the fact that it’s one in which ‘getting this far’ is something that must be managed rather than a natural result of existing.

I thought about this when I woke up because it was a nicer thought than the pounding hangover attempting to send me back to oblivion, and because it’s what Corey and I spoke about on the Uber back from the bar to his apartment for a one-night stand.

He’d walked into the bar after I’d already been there, reading my book and sipping my way through their menu of martinis for more than an hour. Like me, he had very long, graying brown hair tied back into a braid, brown eyes, and casual clothes. We could probably pass for twins. I noticed him less for this, though, and more because he said his name to the bartender. It was mine. Or, my nickname anyway. In another universe, I was born the boy my parents thought I would be, and my name was Corey rather than the hastily-scrambled-for Corinne.

The bar wasn’t too busy, but enough that the seat next to me was one of the only ones available at the counter. He sat next to me, glanced at my book, and said, “Oh, I’ve read that. How’re you liking it?”

I looked at him skeptically. I’m well aware how niche my interests are and the likelihood that a random stranger would have even heard of the book, let alone have read it. “It’s okay,” I said with a small shrug. “The plot’s not bad.”

He snorted. “Sure, but the author’s insistence on repeatedly bringing up the main character’s age is uncomfortable at best.” 

I’d stared at him in shock. He really had read it. (And, thankfully, had the same opinion of the age thing.) Suddenly, I was far more interested in the conversation. Enough that I was still talking to him two hours later, drunk and buzzing pleasantly as the world spun around me. He invited me back to his apartment, and I agreed without a second thought. That was not, I’m afraid, because I was drunk or because I greatly trusted that he wasn’t a serial killer. It’s just that I have nothing I’m living for, so it didn’t matter to me one way or another. 

I couldn’t have picked better, though, as far as the sex went. I’ve never been a fan of sex. It’s not bad, I suppose, but… well… It’s messy and sweaty, and watching paint dry would be more stimulating (and probably also a great deal less stressful). But with Corey, it was like he was in my head, reading every thought, every fantasy I’d ever had, and tailoring the experience to me. Not just technique, although that seemed good too, but kinks. Even though he’d been generically nice when we were talking, when it came to the bedroom, he spoke with a perfect blend of praise and degradation. If sex were usually even *half* as good, I’d be more willing to take part. 

It made me wonder about the common perception that a considerate partner should try to ensure their partner enjoys themself. I’d assumed, given how miserable the entire experience was, that it was a misunderstanding. After all, I’d always thought that people who cared if I orgasmed were the worst because it just meant extending the experience and making it a million times more stressful, but… Maybe that wasn’t the norm. 

My stomach rumbled, my intestines warning me that they were unhappy with me. They never were, but drinking certainly didn’t help. Neither did coffee, so I naturally only managed to drag myself out of bed because I caught a whiff of it. 

I looked around the room blearily. I vaguely remembered Corey’s alarm going off at some ungodly hour. He’d told me he had to go to work, but that I could sleep in, so I did. Was that okay? Now that I was properly awake, I worried that it’d been one of those things you say to be polite but don’t mean. Maybe I was supposed to turn him down and make my way back home at that point. 

Well, it didn’t matter, since that wasn’t what I’d done. I wasn’t likely to see him again anyway. I remember thinking. 

He had random empty shelves along the walls, and it took me a moment to realize I was looking at shelves designed for cats. My heart warmed. It was good to see someone who took proper care of their cats. Not that I always managed, so I couldn’t talk, but still. Good. 

I stumbled into the bathroom and stopped, surprised. Atop a neatly folded towel and washcloth sat an unopened toothbrush and sample sizes of toothpaste, face wash, and deodorant (all, coincidentally, the brands I used). On the closed toilet seat were my similarly neatly-folded clothes, and when I picked them up to get dressed, they smelled clean instead of like the smoke that’d filled the bar. Honestly, it felt like a bit much, but it was also really nice. Maybe I'd hit the jackpot with this guy, a nice little bit of karma to start the weekend with. Or maybe one-night stand etiquette was just better than I’d expected.

I brushed my teeth and examined myself in the mirror. I didn't look too obviously hungover, even if my insides still felt queasy. Getting dressed slowly, trying not to think about the way my head pounded, I heard a clatter on the floor. I blinked, frowned, and fetched a bottle out from where it had rolled behind the toilet. Oh. He'd even included a bottle of Ibuprofen. Jeezus. This guy was too good. 

Or maybe my standards were just too low? Who knew. I'd thought my ex was nice, only for literal strangers to tell me after the divorce lines like ‘good on you getting out’ as though I’d initiated the proceedings rather than having them plopped in my lap one morning. Maybe I was the weird one, and women everywhere expected this type of service as a matter of course.

I shuffled into the kitchen, not quite expecting anything, but by now kind of half-hoping to find another considerate surprise (no matter that I told myself not to get greedy). At the very least, it'd be nice if the faintly lingering aroma of coffee resulted in a Mr. Coffee with half a pot left in it.  

I got better.

A mug of coffee with a small cup of milk sat on a tiny warmer. Beside it was a bottle of one of my favorite flavors of creamer in a bucket of ice. I didn’t always use creamer, and with the way my stomach felt this morning, I decided it’d be a poor idea, but it was nice that he’d offered. Wanting to repay even a hint of Corey’s consideration, I put the creamer into the fridge, taking the opportunity to snoop inside. There wasn’t much. It looked the way my fridge typically looked when I’d recently moved and hadn’t gotten around to collecting condiments and sauces and fermenting leftovers. I set the creamer in the door. The only things accompanying it were chicken and a handful of herbs and veggies. I poked into the cupboards and laughed. It looked like he liked Indian food too and had purchased just enough to make one or two meals. I closed the cupboards and returned to the coffee. 

As I picked up the mug, I smiled at the note that rested next to it, complete with small stick-figure artistry that waved up at me and a phone number.

*I had a great time last night. I hope you don't feel too sick this morning after how much you drank. Feel free to take your time going home, and use whatever you need.*   
*<3 Corey*

Well.

I realized that I was smiling somewhat giddily, but who could blame me? What insanely nice guy was this? I’d rate him at maybe a seven or eight out of ten on the conventional attractiveness scale, so it wasn’t like he was so unfortunate he’d have needed to develop exceptional aftercare to keep a girl. (For the record, I can pull a decent seven out of ten too, if I try hard, but I don’t. In other words, he was reaching down with me and had even less reason to put forth so much effort.) 

Quite frankly, I was starting to feel that this guy was too good to be true. Was he a drug dealer? Was he a serial killer who'd had a change of heart for some reason? Was he secretly into kids and just using drunk girls at bars as a cover? 

I set down the mug and then paused, frowning slightly. Small world indeed. I had this same quirky coffee mug at home. My mom'd gotten it for me from who-knew-where. If he shopped on the same websites as her, maybe there was something wrong with him after all, I thought with satisfaction at finally discovering a flaw, no matter how minor.

I picked up the mug again and wandered into the living room. It was strange. This apartment was my dream home. I'd always hated the idea of living in a big house, one of the reasons my marriage had failed. As much as being a housewife had appealed to me, it was hard to enjoy housewife-ing in a house I didn't like. This apartment, large but ultimately still an apartment, nice but unassuming, was my ideal. The colors were the same I'd have chosen if I'd been designing my own home. Every room I’d been in so far had a cat tower that led to shelves winding throughout the room. The walls were decorated with soothing abstracts that nicely suited my unused degree in East Asian Languages and Cultures. It was perfect.

A small sliver of unease curled through my stomach. I was one of those pessimistic paranoids who couldn't feel comfortable when things were too good.

I sat on the couch (firm, the way I like furniture) and turned on the TV, idly noting that he had many of the same games as me, along with several that I'd wanted to try. The TV turned on to Netflix, and anime, The Great British Baking Show, and Nailed It! were all among the suggestions. Our conversation the night before came back to me. Maybe I had slept with a parallel universe male version of me. I felt distinctly awkward now. The coffee began to taste sour in my mouth. I set the mug down on a coaster and frowned at the screen before turning it off again. I stood and walked to the cabinets under the TV.

Light novels, fantasy, horror, How to Draw... Every topic I normally bought was present and accounted for there. I turned to the bookcases on the walls, and found true crime sprinkled amidst references, chemistry, and engineering. That's right. He'd mentioned doing something in one of those fields, hadn't he? I couldn't remember exactly which, but at the very least, I had no interest in engineering. The unease settled ever so slightly.

Still though... I wandered around the house, and the absolute perfection of it made me bite my lip and wonder whether I should consider this a good thing or not. It was also clean. I mean, yes, that’s fine, but it was weird. The kitchen sink shone, no hard-water marks lined the shower walls, the grout between tiles was perfectly white, and the closets were mostly empty.

It was like someone had come and started living in a model house. 

A thought struck me. This entire time, I hadn’t seen hide nor hair of the cat that must live here. That it could be hiding was perfectly reasonable, but the utter lack of fur lining the surfaces? That was stranger. No amount of obsessive cleaning could get rid of that entirely.

Then I reached the sole room with a closed door.

Ideally, I thought, a guest should not enter closed doors. Certainly, that held for a guest who was, after all, nothing more than a one-night stand.

I opened it anyway and froze.

A lab. And not just a lab, but one that studied, as far as I could tell from a glance, me. The walls were covered in hundreds - thousands? - of pictures of me, all identical in size and all spaced perfectly evenly to form a white lattice-work of negative space framing them. I took a step in, feeling faint, and turned to look at the pictures closest to the door. On one side were pictures of a child me. On the other side were pictures of me as I was now, including several from the night before. There was no rhyme or reason to the subject matter other than that they all contained me. 

Some were of me eating, lovely candid photos that gave me a third chin, and others were pornographic images of me having sex with my partner’s form blurred to leave me the sole focus of the photo. There were close-ups of what I could only assume were my body parts, given the context, and far-away shots of crowds of blurry figures in which I alone stood out. Some were flattering. Most were not. There was my sixth-grade Halloween costume, which I’d mourned not having taken a picture of, and there was my seventh-grade ‘costume,’ which never needed to see the light of day.

Counters lined the walls, and personal effects dotted them. Some I recognized, while others were unfamiliar. I saw my neon green spandex shorts from elementary school and my first handmade cosplay, but also random pairs of jeans and underwear whose origin I could only guess at (though I don’t think it’d be strange to guess that they’d been mine at some point as well). 

It wasn’t only clothes, though. I picked up one of the stuffed animals. It was Pinky, my old stuffed bear. I’d thrown him out after the cat threw up on him, but here he was, pristine once more.

And here was Blankey, the ratty yellow blanket from my childhood that I'd played long, nonsensical imagination games with. And there was Emily, a pink, stuffed cat with a bell in her tail and an ugly, squished face.

What. The. Hell.

As if that wasn’t weird enough, there were rows of lab tables with drawers underneath and cabinets on top, and all were filled with labeled containers. I examined them with a faint sense of horror. Hair was present in disquieting quantities offset only by the even greater disturbance of finding a small collection of *eyelashes.* Then there were cases of slides, like you might find in a chemistry lab, labeled things like 'saliva' and 'urine' and 'arousal fluid,’ each additionally containing the time and location of collection. There were probably thousands of slides, so feel free to assume how far back these collections went.

I explored further, filled with sick fascination now, moving on from the question of why and on to *how.* He hadn’t looked any older than me. Was this a multi-generational obsession? I shuddered at the thought. And what kind of spy gadgets did you need to get some of these pictures? It seemed incredible that I had never once even suspected that someone was observing me, given how thorough that observation seemed to have been.

“Sometimes, data collection for official replacement procedures infects us with a kind of obsession.” I spun around. There stood Corey, leaning against the wall, smiling softly. He didn't look like someone who'd just been caught out as a total psychopath. “It’s a known, quantifiable risk. Standard procedure indicates that one so infected should report it immediately and be reassigned. Recovery takes several months, but all costs are covered by the government. I have no excuse for my failure to report this infection.” 

What did that even mean? I swallowed hard. "H-how?" I asked, gesturing vaguely.

“The usual methods.”

The answer meant nothing to me. What *did* mean something was his position right next to the room’s only exit. With no means of escape, I turned away from him, dazed, and continued my perusal of his collection. I found a binder full of Pokémon cards. I flipped through the pages absently as I tried to *think.* "You stole these from my backpack in the YMCA."

*Now* he blushed, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly. "Yeah, sorry. The early phases of infection include a marked loss of control and improper collection procedures. Don’t worry. I’ve long since passed that stage."

I found a carefully reconstructed Horsea card. It looked like it’d been torn apart, crumpled, and soaked in water. “This is…” There was no way. 

“That may have been the start,” he said casually. “When that boy chewed up and spat out your card, I remember thinking your tears were lovely, which was a distinctly abnormal observation. I retrieved it and attempted to manually restore it, which was also abnormal. Ordinarily, ruined items are regenerated if we deem them important enough to retain.”

I remembered the incident. Bullying me had been a sort of fad for a while in elementary school, with a few of the boys going to ever greater lengths to show off how hard they could make me cry. I’d admittedly probably been annoying with my over-the-top love of Pokémon. Having my favorite card destroyed in such a disgusting way, shortly followed by my cards all disappearing from my backpack, had cured me of that love. I shook my head and closed the binder.

“Who are you?” I asked. 

“Your replacement,” he said. It still made no sense. How could this man possibly replace me? Sure, we had the same height, build, and coloring, but I was very much a woman, while he looked distinctly male. No one would ever confuse us with each other.

I glanced at the door. It seemed both close and also impossibly far away. "Now what?" I asked without much hope. I still didn't get the sense he planned on murdering me, but I doubted I had the kind of sense that would warn me of that in the first place. Not if I'd gone home with my very own stalker.

"Anything you want. You can ignore this, ignore me. But I'd like it if you'd stay." He finally moved away from the door. He approached me carefully and caressed my cheek. "I'll give you everything you need. Everything you want. I'll fulfill every desire you've ever had, even the ones you think you shouldn't have."

The right answer was, of course, to get myself the hell out of there and on a beeline to the police. That would be the mentally stable, sane answer. The answer I'd give right away if I had any form of self-esteem.

But... Even if it was creepy and stalkery and interspersed with words I didn’t understand the context of, no one had ever cared about me like this before. “Can I have some time to think about it?” I asked. 

Amazingly, he agreed. He sent me home to my tiny alimony-funded apartment with his number and a deadline. I suppose, considering how skilled he is at observing me, he doesn’t need to worry that I’ll run. I don’t even know how he’s doing it, so how could I possibly escape? 

I don’t know that I believe his offer. It isn’t lost on me that the photos of me were chronological, and they ended at the door. There was very little room for more pictures, which likely meant there wouldn’t *be* more pictures. It’s hard not to make assumptions about what that means for my longevity. On the other hand, though, what would be the point of the offer if there weren’t some hope of survival?

And did I want to survive anyway? That room. That weird lab-turned-shrine… It showed everything about me, and there was nothing unique or special about the person it was dedicated to. Maybe he couldn’t replace me literally, but just about anyone could replace my role in the world for all the impact I have on it.

So here I am. He gave me a week to think, and I’ve spent the last few nights tossing and turning, debating the answer to this question. Do I ignore him and find out what results, or do I accept him? 

...

I think… I want to accept.

And maybe one day, I’ll spend time thinking about the universes in which I made a different choice.
