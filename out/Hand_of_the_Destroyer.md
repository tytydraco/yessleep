My knuckles were throbbing.  They were red and crusty.

“So, you just attacked this guy for no reason, huh?”  Officer Bailey asked.

If there was a reason, I had no clue what it could be.  I didn’t remember attacking anyone.

“Doesn’t make sense,” Bailey continued.  “From what everyone says, the kid was minding his own business, polite, totally unaware of what was about to happen to him.”

Bailey reached down and opened up a yellow folder.  He pulled out several photographs and laid them on the table.

Blood.  A lotta blood.  And underneath was the mashed up face of a man.  Red and pulpy.  I could see a single blue eye staring up at me.  It looked frightened.

“Is he…” I started to ask, then hesitated before the last word.

“Dead?”  Officer Bailey answered, finishing my sentence for me.  “What do you think?”

I didn’t know what to think.  I only remembered hearing the name, “Kyle Anderson.”  After that, everything was blank.

“Murder, that’s what this is.”  Bailey said, poking a finger at the pictures.  “You beat Kyle to death, crushed his windpipe with your bare hands.  What I can’t figure out is why.”

“He’s a goddamn animal,” said the cop standing in the corner of the interrogation room.  Thompson was his name.  Tall, lean, well-dressed, sipping coffee from a styrofoam cup.

“Maybe Kyle did something to set you off?”  Bailey cut back in.  “You know, figured you’d teach the kid a lesson, but you didn’t realize your own strength.”

“Do you think you’re tough?”  Thompson added, his voice tinged with contempt.

I certainly didn’t see myself that way.  Sure, I’d been in a couple of fights in high school.  “Slapping contests,” would be a more accurate description of those.  I might have been a little rough around the edges, but I wouldn’t describe myself as tough.  Never in a million years could I envision myself assaulting a random stranger while waiting in line at the cellphone store.

And yet, there were witnesses.  Lots of them, and they all pointed the finger at me.

A faint buzzing noise came from Thompson's direction.  He reached into his pocket and pulled out a phone.  Thompon’s angular face lit up as he touched the screen.

“We’ve got quite a case against you.”  Bailey said, drawing my attention back to him.  “All we want to know now is why you did it?  Why on Earth did you attack Mr. Anderson?”

What could I say?  I had no answer.  Even if I did, I never got the chance to offer one.

Thompson stuffed his phone back into his pocket, walked over to the door, turned and said, “Bailey.”

In an instant everything flashed white.  I felt myself suddenly lurch forward.

The interview room was gone.  So were the cops.  I was floating through a cloudy void, swirling with every color in the rainbow.  It was beautiful and sickening at the same time.  Intense pressure bore down on my body as I rocketed through the endless expanse.

A chorus of indistinct whispers rose up around me, talking over each other all at once.  Occasionally I thought I could make out a word here and there.  “Go,” I heard once.  “Under,” another voice said.  Other words, including, “severed, blood, reunited,” and, “complete,” hissed in my head.  The rest was gibberish.

Before I could make sense of what was happening, the clouds in front of me parted, opening up to reveal a gaping red chasm.  It was immense, stretching from one end of the horizon to the other.

The whispers exploded into a cacophony of static.  It was as though someone had cranked the volume knob in my head all the way to maximum.  Pain shot through my eardrums, cascading violently into my temples.  My vision blurred.

Then the voices stopped.  The pain subsided.  I was able to make out something moving beyond the opening.  It was dark and immense, studded with bony protrusions the size of skyscrapers.

“A hand,” I realized.  I was looking at an enormous black hand with six fingers, curled inward to form a fist.

Slowly they started to unfurl, revealing a titanic fanged mouth in the palm of the hand.  A wave of intense heat poured out of it, washing over my body.  My flesh boiled.  Blisters bubbled up on every inch of my exposed skin.  I screamed and writhed, all while plummeting into the depths of that horrific maw.

A flash of white filled my vision.  Pain tore through my stomach, followed by something stinging my shoulder.  I was running.  I knew this because I could feel my feet violently thrust into the pavement.  That’s when I realized I was outside, on the street.

A loud, “crack,” cut through the air.  Something whizzed past my head.  It sparked as it collided with a nearby brick wall.

“Holy shit,” I shouted.  Someone was shooting at me.

I turned to look over my shoulder.  There was Thompson, gun drawn.  I ducked into a nearby alley just as I heard another loud bang fill the air.

Thoughts raced through my mind.  Where was I?  What was I doing?  How did I escape from the police station?  And why was I in so much pain?

Only then did it dawn on me that I had been shot, twice, once in the stomach and once in the shoulder.

A brick facade rose up in front of me, hemmed in on either side by two buildings.  It was a dead end, I realized.  I was trapped.

“Nowhere left to run,” I heard Thompson say.

He turned to see the barrel of a gun pointed right at me.  A cruel smile stretched across Thompson’s face.

“I saw it the moment they brought you into the station,” he said.  “The others couldn’t see it, of course.  Poor old Bailey didn’t see it.  But I did.”

I had no idea what Thompson was talking about.

“Listen,” I stammered, “I don't know what's going on.  I don’t know where I am, or how I…”

“Bang!”  I felt something tear into my abdomen, causing a spasm of pain to ripple throughout my body.  I looked down to see a trickle of red ooze out of my stomach.

“Jesus Christ,” I thought.  “He shot me!”

Instinctively, I put my hand over the bullet hole.  I could feel blood well up underneath it.  Then I felt something else.  Something in the palm of my hand was moving.  It darted in and out, then writhed around in slow, circular motions over the surface of the wound.

I pulled my hand back.  Nestled in the middle of my palm was a little mouth, lined with sharp teeth.  A meaty tongue slithered out of it, lapping up my blood.

“What the fuck,” I muttered to myself.

“You’ve got the Hand.”  Thompson told me.  “Like I said, I recognized it as soon as I saw you.”

The area around the mouth started to turn black, quickly spreading over my entire hand.  The discoloration formed into a thick, spiky resin.  Vicious looking claws sprouted from the tips of my fingers, all six of them.

“Looks like you can see it now too,”  Thompson said.

I looked up and saw Thompson put his gun back in its holster.  The cop seemed remarkably relaxed in the face of all the weird shit going on.  I certainly couldn’t say the same.  I was too shocked to be scared, too confused to make sense out of anything, really.  The only thing I felt was revulsion.

“I believe you,” Thompson cut in, “when you say you don’t know what’s going on.  Clearly you’re new to this.”

As Thompson spoke, he reached up and loosened his tie.  Then he undid the top button of his collar.

“You’ve got the Hand, you see.”  Thompson continued.  “The Hand of the Destroyer.  Kyle Anderson, remember him?  He had the Whisper, the Whisper of the Hidden One.”

He stopped talking and cleared his throat.  A deep, guttural hiss rose up in Thompson’s chest.  It reminded me of how a crocodile sounds when it bellows.  Nothing about it was remotely human.

Thompson spoke again, only this time his voice was slimy and wet.  “Kyle tried to use the whisper on you back at the cellphone shop,” Thompson said.  “Figured he could quietly pick you off without anyone noticing.”

A burning sensation traveled through my arm, coming to rest in the palm of my hand.  The feeling of revulsion was replaced with hunger, and rage.  The pain from my gunshot wounds faded to a dull roar.

“But the Destroyer is tough to kill,”  Thomson rasped out.  “And so are you.”

Thompson’s throat was pulsating.  Something was wiggling around inside of it, trying to force its way out.

“Then again,” he gurgled.  “So am I.”

I felt my fingers tighten into a fist.  “Danger,” a voice told me.  “Get ready.”  Even if I didn’t understand what was happening, clearly my hand did.

Thompson’s neck was grotesquely swollen.  When he spoke, I spotted a disgusting mass of green issue bubbling up in Thompson’s mouth.

“Hand of the Destroyer,” he said.  “Whisper of the Hidden One.”

Thompson paused for a second, then hissed, “Tongue of the Worm.”

Several long tendrils shot out of Thompson’s throat.  They unfurled into a sickening bouquet of moist tongues.  Each one bore a set of tiny, curved fangs.  They hissed and snarled, snapping as Thompson slowly walked toward me.

One of the tongues lashed out at my face.  I tilted my head just in time to dodge it, but another tongue managed to latch onto my torso, sinking its teeth in.  I reached around with my mutated hand and grabbed the tendril.  I felt the mouth in my palm take a bite.  The tendril let go, allowing me to pull it away from my body.

More and more of Thompson’s tongues found their mark, though.  They coiled around me, tearing away chunks of my flesh bit by bit.  One slithered into the wound in my abdomen.  I could feel it dig around inside my guts.

If I didn’t act soon, Thompson was going to rip me to pieces.  But what could I do?  All I had was a tiny little mouth in the palm of my hand.

It was then that I felt the heat inside of my body swell.  With it came a burst of pure malice, a kind of hatred that was deeper and more abiding than anything I had experienced before.  I didn’t just want to kill Thompson, I wanted to annihilate him.

I caught one of the tongues in my hand and twisted.  At the same time my palm bit down hard.  It went all the way through, severing the tongue completely.

Thompson let out a muffled yelp, then reeled backward.  His mouthful of tongues squirmed wildly.  The tendril burrowing through my abdomen retracted.  Black, tar-like liquid poured from the opening it left behind.  As soon as the liquid hit the ground it ignited in a bright, yellow flash.

“Fuckin’ a,” I thought.  “My blood is flammable!”

That realization horrified, excited, and disgusted me all at once.  It also gave me an idea.  I placed my palm against my stomach.  I could feel the mouth inside lick up the slime gushing from my wound.  Instinct told me when it had eaten enough.  Then I stretched out my arm, opened my fist, and let it rip.

The Hand vomited a steady stream of tar all over Thompson.  Instantly it burst into flame, unleashing a cloud of smoke and cinders.  The tongues curled up and withered under the heat.  Thompson thrashed feebly, trying in vain to put the fire out.

Seeing so much suffering and terror filled me with joy.  I reveled in the carnage, savoring the smell of charred flesh filling the air.

“Go,” I heard a voice say.  I couldn’t tell where it was coming from at first.  Then I felt my hand moving.

“Go under,” the voice growled.

It was coming from my hand, I realized.  I turned my wrist.  The mouth in my palm grinned up at him.

“That which is severed is still bound by blood,” it said.  “Reunite what was undone.”

Bursts of heat escaped from the mouth as it spoke, causing the air around it to ripple.  I felt every word reverberate throughout my body.  Whatever possessed me ran much deeper than just my hand.

“Make him complete,” the mouth said.  The mention of “him” filled me with dread, though I didn't know why.

A loud crash drew my attention back to the alley.  I spotted something green and lanky scurry up a nearby fire escape, disappearing as it pulled itself over the top of the building.

I turned my head back to where Thompson was a minute ago.  In his place rested a pile of smoldering sludge.  Another sting of satisfaction struck me at the sight of my enemy’s remains.  But then I spotted a trail of mucus stretching out from underneath the pile.  It led to the building with the fire escape.

“The Destroyer is tough to kill,”  Thompson had said earlier.  “Then again, so am I.”

The malice, the rage, the spiteful sadism left me all at once.  My hand felt lighter.  I looked at it.  The mouth, the claws, the sixth finger, they had all vanished.  So had the injuries caused by Thompson’s attack.  Even the bullet wounds were gone.  As far as I could tell, I was healthy and back to normal.

My clothes were a mess though, ripped to shreds and stained with a variety of different fluids.  That feeling of revulsion returned.  There was something inside of me, something powerful and cruel.  I was nearly overwhelmed by its malice.  The Hand granted me unnatural abilities, but it also threatened to subsume me.

My encounter with Thompson, the Tongue of Worm, was already a blur in my mind.  It all seemed so impossible, so far-fetched.  My memory was fading, I realized, just like it had with Kyle Anderson.  Pretty soon I would have no idea where I was or how I got there.

I needed to remember though.  So much damage had already been done.  I was wanted for murder, and now I was on the run from the cops, one of whom was secretly a monster in disguise.  If I forgot everything that had happened I’d be back to square one, clueless and hunted, running for my life without knowing why.

“Go,” I heard a voice echo in my mind.  “Make him whole again.”

I felt grounded all of a sudden, my thoughts crystallized.  The memory of my encounter with Thompson came back into focus.  Clearly, whatever evil was inside me had a vested interest in keeping me clear-headed.  I needed the Hand and the Hand needed me, at least for the time being.

If I wanted to make it through this, I would have to, “go under.”  I’d have to find what was severed and reunite it.  I would have to find a way to, “make him whole,” whatever the hell that meant.

“Him,” just the thought of that word sent a shiver down my spine.  “Hand of the Destroyer,” Thompson had called me.  But who or what was the Destroyer, and why had it chosen me to be its Hand?

I needed answers.
