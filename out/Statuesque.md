Late last year, I started seeing a statue. Yes, a statue. It looks like one you see at art museums. It’s completely white and shiny. It has no torso, it’s just a chest with a head. The man who is etched into the marble has thick, straight eyebrows to match his equally thick, curly hair. It always looks like he’s in a state of concentration. He has a wide neck to go along with his burly chest that is completely nude. In any other context I would have absolutely marveled over this work of art.

He won’t stop following me.

In early December of last year my alarm had woken me up from a decent night’s sleep when I saw the quick image of a head and chest from the corner of my eye. I immediately whipped my head in the direction of which l saw the sharp flash of white but there was absolutely nothing there. I remember blinking my eyes slowly open and shut to make my groggy mind more awake, thinking it was just a dream that followed me into the real world.

I had to get ready for school so as I got back home from my swimming club I had forgotten the entire thing already. It wasn’t until I was filling up a glass of water that I saw him again. I had leaned against the island in my kitchen, my eyes still sensitive and my body sore from that day’s practice when he appeared in my line of view a few feet away from me. He was closer to the stairs leading to my room than from where I was located on the island. I rubbed my eyelids so harshly that I could see spots and stars for a few seconds after I opened them again. I had also painfully flinched against the thick concrete of the kitchen island and my back had the evidence of a large bruise from the intensity of the scratch from the rough concrete for weeks after. 

When I opened my eyes again, he was gone. My heart was beating at a rapid pace from the shock of seeing something so out of place. Although our house has things that cheaper homes don’t, my family absolutely does not collect perfectly sculpted marble statues.

It didn’t make sense for him to be there even if we did because he wasn’t balanced on anything. It was as if he was just floating there, like he had found a pocket of gravity that worked enough for him to watch me. What could I believe then? Was I experiencing psychosis? I don’t remember hearing about or seeing it running in my family, but then again, taboo subjects like that are not often spoken about in fear of bad reputation. I had to brush it off again. It's such a strange thing to experience that I had to.

I got ready to wash the chlorine from my body in a confused state, my heart feeling like it had gained ten extra pounds. There was an electric course running through me that I just wanted to slow down with a nice, hot shower.

I remember the feeling I got when I was washing the shampoo from my hair. The feeling that I was not alone at that moment. I didn’t want to open my eyes, I wanted to pretend that there was an endless amount of shampoo flowing down my face, leaving me unable to open them until it all washed down the drain.

“You’re being ridiculous.” I had thought to myself then. “You are being absolutely ridiculous.”

I didn’t see him when I finally had the courage to loosen the grip of my eyelids from the safety of my bottom lashes, but not because he wasn’t there. No. It was because I was facing the showerhead.

If I thought my two previous encounters were a strange dream or a trick of imagination, this was a haunting nightmare. He was peeking through my shower curtain, his face the same as before. The furrow in his concentrated eyebrow had no distinction between pleasure and curiosity.

I had finally screamed. He disappeared as I backed up against the wall and even though the shower had suddenly turned into the end of a mouse trap, I couldn’t bring myself to free myself from the cold and wet wall that was grounding me from slipping through the shower drain. I somehow, after much time had passed, finished my wash.

I was exhausted then, even more so than before. My eyes had felt like I had spent an extra five hours more than the usual one in my school’s swimming pool. I was slowly dragging my feet to my room, procrastinating in turning the handle in hopes that he wouldn’t be on the other side of the door.

The turn of my knob was an adrenaline rush in of itself, but the checking of every corner in my relatively small room felt like the peak of being on a looping roller coaster. He wasn’t there after double checking every inch of my square space, but even as I changed into my regular clothes I was quickly darting my head in every direction after I had placed each item of clothing on myself. The sudden shout of my mom announcing that dinner was ready was a gunshot to the ear. I didn’t even hear her coming home in my apprehensive state.

I wanted to ask my mom then if there was any sort of mental illness that ran in the family, but how does one even begin to bring that topic up? Was I supposed to do it after I asked her to pass the salt? I must’ve been obvious because she did ask me if I was feeling alright, and unfortunately I had decided to push it away and make an excuse that I had been stressing over homework.

Even after I had tucked myself into bed I would occasionally look behind me or flash a light towards the door. It seemed like three times was the charm for the day, and only the moonlight was a comforting blanket after the most confusing day of my life.

Oh how I wish the glowing rays of the moon followed me every minute, but as you can see that I am writing to you now, it was only the test run to the start of a tormenting game that I was the sole player of.

I don’t remember what I dreamt of that day, it was probably just a black screen of peace, but when I first opened my eyes from the sound of my alarm ringing, he was there again. He wasn’t a sudden flash of white, he was directly in front of me. If I had slept any closer to the edge of my bed, we could’ve been touching noses. I didn’t have it in me to react physically, but my breath halted in my throat and my bones suddenly tightened into an iron grip in my body. Again, he didn’t do a single thing but stare. I gathered my clothes after the initial fright and as I turned to see if he was still there, he was laying on my bed. His look of permanent concentration was slowly starting to piss me off. I decided to finish my routine in my closet. At least then, even if he did follow me there, I couldn’t see him.

This lasted the entire school day. He would position himself in front of me as I tried to focus on whatever teacher was trying to do their job. Most of the time though, my gaze would focus on the clock in every classroom. You don’t realize how quickly time can pass if the only thing you see is the slim line underneath each clock hand that is assisting it to every destination on that small circle.

He is unnecessarily cruel. He never lays a finger on me or inches closer than my nose, he just stares in contempt. He judges me like he has any right to.
I didn’t want him to get under my skin and I didn’t want to admit defeat. I never did ask my mom if anything like this ran in the family, for better or for worse. I just suffered in silence.

“No. You’re not suffering. This isn’t a big deal. You are over exaggerating. This is nothing.”

I would repeat this to myself whenever he popped in as I was showering or changing. I didn’t even need to check behind me to make sure he was there after a couple of weeks.

Just when I thought I had finally convinced myself that I was used to it, when I could finally attempt to ignore that face from the corner of my vision, he shifted on the first day of Christmas break.

I’m not ashamed to admit that when he was pointing at me with the sudden appearance of a torso, I shrieked. His eyes had grown widely, the sculpted pupil nearly jumping out of his head with the force of which he was viewing me. The finger accused in my direction was thick and the palm connected to it was manly and veiny. It only took me a few minutes after my initial shock to understand why he was so mad at me.

I was getting used to him. No. I was getting over him. And by God, he refused to let me move on.

“What is wrong with you?” I screamed. I didn’t care if I looked unreasonable to anyone who could walk in. As far as I was concerned, the only unreasonable person in the room with me was made out of marble.

“Just leave me alone!” I refused to cry. He could get me to change in my closet, he could get me to check around every corner I was approaching, and he could get my grades to drop because I couldn’t switch to any desk without him being there. He could do all that, but he couldn’t see me cry.

He didn’t stop that act until I resumed my swim practice. It took the entire two weekends of overblown festivity and the first half of Monday for him to appear as his normal self when I had changed into my usual loose shirt and shorts after swim class. The smooth chest and furrowed eyebrows were a strange comfort that quickly turned into a tight knot in my stomach.
I was getting used to him, just not the same way as before.

I quit the swim team shortly after that.

“You weren’t a valuable asset. You weren’t the captain. It’ll be a lot less work. You could go home sooner. It’s not because of him.”

My mom eventually noticed that I hadn’t been doing average in school like before, in fact after the whole ordeal started my highest grade was a B minus. Honestly, I was quite proud of myself for that with all things considered.

She was angry at me, which I guess is fair. She took away my phone, saying that it was a mistake giving it to me in the first place. She would give it back when I put in more effort in my schoolwork. I was supposed to be going to college soon, what am I thinking?

Not once did she ask what was wrong.

You never did tell her about him.

But not once?

I stormed into my room after. This is unfair. I’m a good person, right? If I was, would this be happening to me? It’s not fair, I haven’t done anything wrong. 

“You asshole.” I said under my breath. What was he going to do about it?

Turns out, his way of punishing me for foul language is to take form as a rotting corpse. He was a full man now, but his internal organs were spilling onto my bedroom floor. There was blood secreting from his eyes and ears slowly. His mouth was agape like he was shocked by my vulgarity. The marble block that allowed him to balance had his hands thrown against his feet.

He finally made me cry. Actually, what he got was a long round of guttural screams and sobs. What he got was me hugging myself on the floor, repeatedly asking myself what I did to deserve this. What he got was a lonely puddle of what was once a teenage girl. I imagine he was satisfied.

Not once did anyone ask.

You’ll have to get over him.

I remember contemplating, “Why should I even try? When I had done so before, he showed me how much it wouldn’t work.”

After sitting against my bed frame for an indiscernible amount of time, his blood pooling into my toes, I thought one thing.

“What other choice do I have?”

Admittedly, it took a lot. Notice how I’m writing this in the middle of the year. Some days, I would slip back into the comforting ticking of the clock, hoping that it would never catch up to its destination. Sometimes I would do absolutely nothing but lay on my carpet floor because he had taken up space on my bed. I would pretend that I was floating through the stars and that where I was, statues didn’t exist. Blood and guts and marble are only a concept on Earth.

Most days, I would find the strength to stare back at him. I would blur my eyes and I would inch closer. I would talk to him and I would sing to him. I never got the strength to change in front of him, though. That is a big regret I have.

One day, he wasn’t on my bed, and the sigh of relief I let out was the knob to my tears. I had forgotten all about how my bed sheets formed comfortably around me. The next day, he came back, but that was fine. His biggest mistake was letting me have one night of familiarity.

One day, I pushed his head aside to fill in a question during math class. The loud screech from the friction of his sliced chest against my desk made me wince, but I had to finish the question. The next week, I applied to colleges.

Sometimes I wish he hurt me physically. I know it’s a strange thing to want, but if I had proof then maybe somebody would notice. Even if they didn’t, I could blame everything on them. It’s odd, isn’t it? The comforting point of a finger to anyone but yourself or the person hurting you.

Eventually he slowly started disappearing from my life. I would head back home from school and I wouldn’t peek around corners. I would finally get an A on one of my papers after what felt like a century of studying. I would finally get my phone back and get an apology from my mom for not helping me more. I would forgive.

Last month was my 18th birthday. After the initial congratulations ended and the questions on if I felt any different subsided, I blew out the candles on my cake. His head and bare chest were sitting on the other side after the small wave of smoke disappeared into the air. I cut a slice for myself, and then I offered him one after.

He hasn’t shown up since.
