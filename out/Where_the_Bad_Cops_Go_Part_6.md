From April to May, we had to move to the old fire station. The Tomskog Fire Department had long since been dismantled, being absorbed into St. Cloud and the surrounding area – leaving their old station available. It’d been used a handful of times as a sort of community space, but there was limited use for an old fire station. It didn’t take long to set up shop though, and with the folks from the DUC helping us out we got the resources we needed.

With Charlie on sick leave, I had to stay on radio duty for the foreseeable future. As we were running short on manpower, I was solely responsible for running the dispatch during the evening shift. We moved off the secure channels though – just in case I wasn’t around for a call or two.

I’m not gonna say those few weeks weren’t eventful, but they were eventful in a way that didn’t directly affect me. There was some sort of operation to shut down a turbine, for example, that seemed to have dire implications.

 

My days weren’t that eventful. I took calls, redirected our various units to check them out (or not), and made sure to take note of anything out of the ordinary. I also acted as a sort of info hub for the DUC, who checked with me every now and then to see if something unusual happened. A couple of people called in about spotting Patrick and his crossbow a couple of times, but he hadn’t hunted anyone since the Rosemills, so we just assured the callers and hung up.

But there was that one call that would change my time in Tomskog – permanently.

I was on my way home after an evening shift, clocking out just after 10pm. I was dragging myself to my car, sipping the last few drops of a forest-fire-tasting americano. Apparently getting a decent coffee machine wasn’t high on the DUC list of priorities. I heard a strange noise and stopped, only to realize it was my phone. My personal one. It hadn’t rung in so long that I’d forgotten my custom ring tone – Stayin’ Alive, by the Bee Gees.

I didn’t recognize the number. I figured it might be someone from work who needed me for an extra shift.

I answered.

 

“Please don’t hang up.”

That was the first thing they said to me. It sounded like a man – nervous, if anything. I stayed quiet, giving the stranger a chance to say his piece.

“You’re the new girl, aren’t you?” he continued. “At the station?”

“Who is this?”

“My name’s Adam,” he said. “I’m looking for my daughter.”

“I’m sure we can help you,” I said. “But I need you to call during office hours, and not to my private phone.”

“It’s not like that,” he sighed. “I’ve talked to the sheriff countless times, but he’s not doing anything. But I believe you can.”

“This is sketchy, Adam. Why would I be able to help when the sheriff can’t?”

“Because you’re still here to protect and serve.”

I stopped in front of my car, rolling my eyes. The taste of burnt coffee stained the roof of my mouth.

“I just need a few minutes of your time,” Adam continued. “You’ll get a free lunch.”

 

It was the first bribe I’d ever accepted. The next day, I met Adam for lunch at the one downtown café Tomskog offered. They had little blue sunflowers in every window, and they all had that strange illusion where it looked like they turned towards you no matter the angle you looked at.

Adam was in his early 50’s, with thinning blond hair and a beer belly that poked the edge of the table. He had these naturally sad facial features, like his face had slightly melted. I couldn’t imagine him smiling, other than sarcastically. He got out of his seat, shook my hand, and asked for my order. I wanted a sandwich and a latte, and he was off like a bullet.

When we sat down to eat, he scooched a little closer and lowered his voice.

“Thank you for meeting me,” he said. “I’m sorry if I startled you.”

“I’m still not sure if I can help,” I said. “But I’m sorry about your daughter.”

He pulled out a small photo. A young woman with a black pixie-like haircut and black eyeliner.

“Her name’s Elizabeth,” he said. “Or Ellie. Elle to some.”

“She’s pretty,” I smiled. “But I haven’t seen her.”

“I know, I know,” he nodded. “But I think you can help me find her.”

 

We finished our lunches. As people walked by, Adam would lower his voice and look over his shoulder. I could tell he wasn’t comfortable being out in public. I’d seen strange people in Tomskog before, and there were a lot of them, so this wasn’t out of the ordinary; but something about Adam seemed more genuine. He was weird for a *reason*.

“I don’t know how much they’ve told you,” he said. “Have Hatchet been around?”

“Hatchet?” I scoffed. “The pharma people?”

“So no. You got any inoculations? Any shots?”

“What, like, tetanus?”

“You really are new, huh?”

He attempted a grin, but it came of as a tired squint.

“Look,” he continued. “I’ll tell you everything I know. But you gotta promise to help me.”

“I can’t promise you anything,” I said. “I don’t know this girl.”

“Just promise you’ll try. Please.”

Looking across the table, there was no way I could say no. I had a soft spot for people asking nicely, and Adam seemed like an honest guy. At least genuine enough to know when to reach out of his comfort zone.

“Alright. I’ll try.”

 

I followed Adam to his car and sat down in his passenger seat. We exchanged numbers, and he took out a notebook. He had detailed notes about everything related to his daughter, along with names, dates, witness testimonies, and a handful of other details. I got a brief look at his glove compartment when he got his reading glasses. There were a handful of other notebooks in there as well.

Elizabeth had survived a fall from a great height. She’d broken her legs and cracked her pelvis but had managed to make it to a nearby road. They’d found her next to Frog Lake. How she’d managed to fall from such a great height, only to end up in the lake, was a mystery in and of itself. But that wasn’t all – she was exhibiting some unusual symptoms.

By the time Adam got to the hospital, she’d been quarantined. Early reports indicated something called SORE, but that changed when a new doctor made a second diagnosis. Elizabeth was to be taken to a special clinic upstate, but Adam was never given any details. Three days later, he was told she died from respiratory failure.

“I’m sorry to hear that,” I said. “So why do you believe she’s still around?”

“That first diagnosis,” Adam tapped his head. “SORE. That’s never mentioned again.”

“Maybe they made a mistake.”

“If they did, why do they refuse to tell me what it is?”

He flipped a couple of pages, turning to a section labeled ‘SORE’.

 

Sudden Onset Rest Event - SORE. According to Adam’s notes, it was a strange condition that could trigger within 72 hours of exposure, and often when a victim submits to rest.

“There have only been a handful of mentions of this,” Adam continued. “One is at a prison. Corporate-sponsored. They get this all the time. The other was an explosion of cases in, uh… Juniper, West Virginia.”

“Not seeing much of a connection here, Adam.”

“There’s like… six branches of… you know what? Never mind. I’m getting off track. Here.”

Grabbing another notebook, he handed it to me. He turned a couple of pages and tapped the page.

“There has never been a resolved case of SORE. Check the numbers if you want.”

“It’s just names.”

“Dozens. All diagnosed, none of them released. They contract this thing and disappear.”

“So it’s fatal.”

“No, fatality means closure. There’re no record of anyone dying from it either. They die from something else, or they just…”

Adam popped his hands, making a poof noise. He looked at me as if expecting some kind of conclusion. I shook my head at him.

“Take this home”, Adam sighed. “I got copies. Just look it over.”

“Alright,” I nodded. “Thanks for lunch.”

“Yeah.”

 

I looked it over later that night, when my job lulled to a halt. I didn’t understand what this had to do with me, or the Tomskog PD, but if I could put this paranoid man’s thoughts to rest, that’d be a win in my book.

A stray thought blew through my mind. There was an incident in West Virginia where plenty of folks had come down with SORE. I vaguely recalled Nick mentioning Tomskog PD being called there once in response to a ‘geological event’. The dates lined up. Checking the records, I could confirm that yes – the same event that Nick and the others were called out for resulted in one of the largest outbreaks of SORE that they’d ever seen. It couldn’t be a coincidence.

SORE was a Tomskog thing, much like the other strange things happening here. Someone had to know something. But chances were that, if no one had told Adam by now, it was for a reason. Either way, I was curious.

 

There was a lot of info in those notebooks. Something about SORE being an “accelerant” rather than an infection in and of itself, and how it didn’t introduce anything new or foreign to the human system. Records of strange behaviors, such as people drinking rainwater and throwing up white globs of parasites. And violence – endless witness statements about violence, cannibalism, and cult-like gatherings.

Some of that stuff sent shivers down my spine. There were links to online forums where people talked about their experiences. They never say it was SORE outright, but the dates and locations lined up. Some of this stuff had been around since the 70’s, maybe earlier.

I knew it was a bad idea to get involved. I’d been an idiot before, and it got me in trouble with Nick and the whole station. But I figured maybe just this once, I could help a grieving father and do some real good. So I texted him.

“Alright,” I wrote. “What do you need?”

 

It was just little things at first. Some names, dates, and locations. Mostly things to corroborate his suspicions about Tomskog PD and their involvement with certain events. Then there were pictures. Mostly picture of people involved in said events. Nothing harmful, just confirmation of things that Adam had already figured out. It was all to build an idea of what usually happened to folks with SORE, as a way to point at  what might’ve happened to Elizabeth.

It all pointed to this company called Hatchet Pharmaceuticals. They were the final red thread in every case. Doctors associated with Hatchet would make a new diagnosis and the patient would disappear. Either the records would abruptly end, or they’d die from something unrelated. It’s like they had a list of “top 10 most common excuses” and just repeated the list over and over. There was even a pattern to it.

But that’s as far as we could get. After a week going over the records, the names, the dates… it all ended with Hatchet. And not even I could open the kind of corporate records that these people held behind closed doors.

 

After that, things got quiet. Adam didn’t know where to go from there, and I didn’t have anything more to give him. My job was business as usual, and there were no major events going down. Yes, I heard a handful of strangeness every now and then, but there were no “all hands on deck” kinda deals. Then, one night, I got a call from Adam.

I met him on a park bench overlooking Frog Lake. It was late, and a cold wind was coming in from the north; bringing a faint smell of pine from the woods. Most of the gravel-filled snow slush had made way to early spring flowers. Even a couple of budding sunflowers, but it was too early to tell what color they were. I could warrant a guess though.

Adam had brought along a little bag that he held in his arms. He looked tired – more tired than usual. He turned to me with a sigh.

 

“I don’t think we’re gonna get much further,” he said. “Thanks for trying though.”

“Hope I could help.”

“You did,” he nodded. “You really did. Thank you. But, uh…”

He adjusted his seat a little, clutching the bag.

“If you got a new lead, can I count on you to follow it?”

“Yeah,” I said. “Yeah, I’m here.”

“Even if I’m not?”

I turned to him with a questioning look. He pulled out a water bottle from his pack, rolling it between his hands.

“I’ll do what I can,” I said. “I mean… I don’t like people disappearing any more than you do.”

 

Adam nodded and took a swig from his water bottle. He cringed a little and handed me a slip of paper.

“Meet me here tomorrow,” he said. “And bring a friend. Someone you trust.”

“What for?”

“A Hail Mary, courtesy of mister Digman.”

Adam knowingly tapped the side of his bottle, got up from his seat, and wandered off. He gave me a final wave, calling back to me.

“See you tomorrow.”

 

I texted Nick three times about it. He got the address, and I tried to underline just how important it was. I got no response. I thought about texting Charlie, but I wasn’t sure she’d have my back the same way Nick did. Also, she was still on sick leave. The thought crossed my mind that I might just cut the crap and talk to the sheriff directly, but I got the impression that he might be involved to a level that might just cause me some trouble if I didn’t play my cards right.

So I said to hell with it and went by myself. I’d have Adam, and maybe that’d be enough. Let the chips fall where they may.

 

The address that Adam’d given me was his house. He lived in alone in a two-bedroom one-story house at the west end of town, not too far from Frog Lake. I got there just after my shift. Still no answer from Nick. I’d texted Adam a couple of times too, just to see what this was really about. I’d been getting a bad feeling about it all day, so I brought my service weapon.

I knocked on his door and waited patiently. After about a minute, I knocked again, looking around. I noticed there was something stuck to the bottom of the door. The corner of a slip of paper. I pulled it out.

‘Door’s open. Go on in,’ it said.

I took out my gun, just in case. I opened the door to a pitch-black hallway. I felt around for the light switch, flipped it, and relaxed my shoulders. It was empty.

 

I got in and closed the doors behind me, making sure nothing was following me. This whole ordeal had started to feel like a spy movie. Like I was some kind of double agent working behind the scenes. I know that wasn’t the case – I was just getting involved with a cold case. That’s all. At least that’s what I kept telling myself.

I noticed another note on the kitchen counter, along with a bottle of wine. It had a nice little blue ribbon tied to it.

‘Make sure I’m secure and call it in. Then you got a trail to follow. Some wine for your trouble.’

 

It was nice wine, but I let it rest on the counter. I looked over the note again.

Adam, what the hell did you do?

 

It was quiet as a grave. I rounded the corner to the bedroom, expecting something horrifying, but… it was nothing. Just a knocked-over chair and an open window. Looking a little closer, I could tell something was off. There were a pair of handcuffs on the floor, ripped open. The chair was broken in three different places. The window hadn’t been unlocked; someone had broken it from the inside and climbed out. There were tracks in the sleet.

Looking back at the scene, I was starting to piece a couple of things together. There was an empty water bottle on the nightstand; the same one Adam’d drunk from the previous night.

A trail to follow. Making sure he was secure. Broken handcuffs.

The idiot had infected himself with something and wanted me to call it in, so I could follow what happened to him. That was his way for me to get an idea of what happened to Elizabeth, and maybe, help her. That’s why he’d asked the day prior.

Except he fucked up. He was on the loose, doing God knows what, and now I was the only one who knew about it.

 

There was a knock on the front door.

I rushed to get it, forgetting to look through the peep hole. I opened it just as Nick raised his hand for a second knock.

“This better be important, rook,” he said. “I got work in the morning.”

“I may have fucked up.”

He adjusted his pink sunglasses, looking past me.

“You got Adam in there?” he asked. “Still looking for his girl, huh?”

“You know him?”

“Rook, I know everyone.”

 

I sat Nick down by the kitchen wine and explained it all to Nick. I told him how Adam and I had talked, how I’d looked into a couple of cases, and how Adam had come up with a plan on his own. I told him I was suspicious, that maybe Adam had infected himself with something. Possibly SORE, the thing he’d talked about. That made Nick perk up.

“SORE? How the fuck did he get a hold of that?”

“I think Digman got it for him.”

“Jesus Ace-of-Base-loving Christ, if that’s… you sure? He got SORE?”

Nick got out of his seat, holding his hands up like everything was a land mine waiting to go off.

“No, that’s… you got no idea,” he continued. “We had to spray down like a hundred cars who was even *suspected* of having caught a *whiff* of that thing. If we got a real SORE case on the loose, that’s…”

Nick pulled out his gun. I followed his lead.

“The DUC catches a scent of this, we’re dead,” he continued. “That ain’t no joke.”

“Alright.”

“Alright?”

“Yeah,” I nodded. “Alright.”

 

There were some tracks outside the bedroom window, heading southward. We followed them past the Frog Lake trail, and into the woods. The snow-slush was clear enough, but we’d figured out where he was heading by then. Adam was going for the police station. Maybe he didn’t know it’d burned down, or maybe he wasn’t thinking clearly. As we made our way through the pine woods, I turned to Nick. He’d taken off his pink sunglasses – an obvious giveaway that he was nervous as all hell.

“So you know about this stuff?” I asked.

“Kinda,” he admitted. “When they called us in for the outbreak in West Virginia, we were given some outlines.”

He held up a hand, counting off on his fingers.

“First, it was airborne. Second, it triggers if you rest within 72 hours. Third, if and when it triggers, there’s no telling what’ll happen.”

“You seen it though?”

Nick didn’t know what to say. He struggled to find the words, leaning his head to and fro.

“I guess I did.”

 

He explained that there was a sort of unspoken partnership between Hatchet Pharmaceuticals and the DUC. Hatchet had the best, if not the only, facility that could house people with SORE. They had experts who knew how to study it, and they had people who knew how to diagnose it.

“But some things you can just tell,” Nick explained. “You can see it from a mile away. Like, most infected people stop to stare at the sky.”

“Creepy.”

“It’s even creeper when you know why.”

I raised an eyebrow at that. Nick rolled his eyes.

“I talked to a Hatchet guy. He said they are sort of programmed to look in the direction of the source of infection, like a… magnetic thing. Sort of like a… migrating bird.”

“Wait, so the source of… up? They look up?”

“It’s somewhere up, yeah.”

“Up,” I scoffed. “That’s fucked.”

 

As we rounded a small hill, we could see the charred ruins of the old police station. Nick and I stopped for a second. We’d lost the tracks some time ago, but there was no doubt in my mind that this was the place. It’d been a straight line.

“If the DUC hears about a case like this, we’re done,” Nick said. “They can’t know.”

“Then this has been for nothing, Nick.”

“I’m telling you – if they hear about it, we’re *done*. They’ll comb through this guy’s entire life, and you’ll pop up. He’ll be put in a box somewhere, and you’ll join him. Then I’ll join him. And then we’re just one big happy meal for some sick Hatchet experimental shit in God-knows-where Fucklahoma together.”

He grabbed my collar and looked me in the eye.

“If he’s infected, no one can ever know. No one. Please.”

I nodded, and Nick let go. I didn’t like it, but this was the guy I chose to trust.

 

We made our way to the burnt-out police station. It didn’t take long for us to pick up more tracks. They were circling the building, as if looking for something. Nick suggested we split up to cover both sides, but I put my foot down. We were sticking together, and that’s that.

Rounding the corner to the back of the building, you could see the sleet  bump up a bit where the old fire door lay flat on the ground. Just a couple of feet ahead, we saw the tracks dip southward. Giving them a wide berth, we stepped sideways, keeping our hands on our weapons.

And there he was.

 

It was Adam, just as I’d seen him the day prior. He had a cut around his left wrist; probably from struggling his way out of those handcuffs. He didn’t look any different physically, but his mannerisms seemed… unusual. He was just standing there, wet all the way up to his knees, staring at the sky.

“You sure he’s infected?” Nick asked. “I ain’t putting down an innocent man.”

“How can we be sure?”

“I don’t know,” Nick admitted. “This shit’s above my pay grade.”

He raised his firearm at Adam, and I followed his lead.

“Hey!” Nick called out. “If you understand me, say something!”

 

Adam turned to us, not lowering his head. I could see the corner of his eyes, as he stared unblinkingly with childlike wonder up at the sky. Tomskog is one of few places where you can still see the stars at night, but in that moment, I sort of wished I couldn’t.

“I need you to speak!” Nick repeated. “Say something!”

Adam took a careful step our way, leaning his head back further. His mouth opened wide, peeling back his lips. And still, he was perfectly balanced and upright. It’s as if his head didn’t even matter.

“Last chance.”

Nothing. Not a glimmer of recognition.

 

Nick looked at me, and I nodded. There was nothing we could do. It was the end of the line.

And the gun went off.

 

Adam dropped to the ground. Nick took another shot for good measure and holstered his weapon. He was breathing like he’d ran a marathon. I had to snap him out of it before he fell into a panic.

“We need bags,” I said. “Lighter fluid. Duct tape. Maybe… maybe a hacksaw. I don’t know.”

“What?”

“If we don’t want the DUC or Hatchet or whoever to know about this, this has to go away.”

Nick nodded, looking back and forth between me and Adam. He tapped me on the shoulder and ran off to get his car, leaving me with the dead body.

 

The moment he was gone, I broke down. It felt like I’d swallowed a block of ice, turning my blood cold. I shivered. I took out one of my gloves to bite down on, because my teeth wouldn’t stop chattering. I wanted to pinch my eyes closed and cry, but I forced them open. I forced myself to look. I had to convince myself this was for the best. If it hadn’t been, then Patrick would’ve put a crossbow bolt in me by now. Maybe.

Adam was lying face up, still staring at the sky. I could count the stars reflected in his eyes. Dying from a gunshot to the head is like putting the body on pause; it doesn’t look like it’s done moving. It just immediately stops what it’s doing, as if ready to go again at any second.

So when he started moving, I barely noticed it.

 

It took my eyes a moment to adjust to what I was seeing. Adam’s head rolled; his eyes looked for me. They weren’t focusing, but they were looking my way. Something convulsed its way up his throat. I could count its throbbing movements.

Little white strands rolled out of the corner of his mouth. Like thick hair. Just a couple inches long. They retracted, then rolled out again. It repeated this a couple of times, growing a little longer every time.

It was like a hand, trying to crawl. Like something was using Adam like a snail’s shell.

 

There was a little pop as a couple of buttons opened on Adam’s bloodstained shirt. A couple more strands of white had erupted from his belly button. He was an outie. Fuck, how I hate that I know that detail. It’s burned into my mind.

I aimed my gun at his head, setting off two more shots, followed by a third shot to the chest. I paused, breathed, and took aim at the neck.

As my finger reached the trigger, something burned my hand. A string of three feet long white strands of white had shot out, digging into my skin. It felt like getting strangled with gasoline-soaked dental floss; this bright painful burn.

 

I took my gun in my left hand and pulled back. At first, I couldn’t lose the strands and ended up pulling Adam along like a dog on a leash. On my second attempt, the strands came loose, curling back up into his head; leaving these blue and yellow burn marks on my hand. I backed away, raising my gun for another round, but I couldn’t get the fingers in my right hand to move like I wanted them to. There was some sort of paralytic effect going on, and I could feel it spreading through my arm.

Aiming with my left hand, and trying to block out the pain, I took aim at his neck. Then he moved. And not just a little pull, but a proper full-body jerking motion. He rolled backwards, slowly, letting his head move every which way with full abandon; dragging it through the sleet and gravel. He got up on his knees, letting his head roll back to once again look at the stars.

I fired. I fired every bullet I had, tearing out his left tendon, his shoulder, his neck, and part of his eye. There was no way he could survive it, and yet; there he was. Standing up like it was the most natural thing in the world; only limping slightly from the torn fiber in his foot.

I tried to reload, but I dropped my magazine. I wasn’t used to doing it with just one hand. By the time I got it, Adam had turned my way. As I raised my gun towards him, he burst into a sprint.

 

I rounded the corner to the burned-out station. I could taste the ashes, despite my dry mouth. Part of me just wanted to keep running, thinking there was no way I couldn’t outrun a guy with a torn foot. Then again, it didn’t seem to slow him down; it just changed the way he hobbled. He was fast as hell, almost tripping over himself; using his body weight to go faster in an ever-falling motion.

Something was burning in my leg. Whatever had attached to my hand earlier had done a number on me, and I was feeling something all the way down in my leg. Maybe I was the one with a disadvantage?

In the moment, I wasn’t thinking that clearly. This was a matter of seconds. I decided to take my chances indoors. Sure, the roof had collapsed, but the locker room and the sheriff’s office were solid enough. So when Adam came charging around the corner, I rolled my way inside a window, letting my thick jacket absorb the crunch of shattered glass on the floor.

 

I plopped down on the floor, but I couldn’t get back up. My right leg wasn’t working. It didn’t contract. I crawled my way across the floor, but as soon as Adam’s shape popped up in the window, I didn’t hesitate. I put six shots in him. It didn’t even slow him down. Long strands of white shot out from a bullet wound in his neck in a web across the walls. It pulled his body inside the building, almost reluctantly.

His body flopped onto the floor unceremoniously as the strands contracted. I propped myself up against the opposing wall, firing every damn bullet I had. The pops echoed against the bare concrete walls, ringing my inner ear with every shake. My hands were stained with ash and sleet, but I could barely feel the cold.

With the final click of my gun, Adam was still standing. What remained of his head still leaned back. White strands poked out of every corner of his body, searching blindly for something to grasp. Something like me.

 

I couldn’t get up. My leg was done. My right arm, too. My breathing was shallow. My heart was pounding, but I could barely feel it. There was just this pumping feeling in my left arm, but nothing in my chest. My trigger finger retracted with every beat of my heart, but there was nothing but empty clicking left.

The white strands found the steel tip of my right boot. They curled across the surface, but found nothing to grasp. They retracted, aiming higher. A couple of them found the edge of my boot, and the warmth of my leg. I should’ve felt a burn, as I saw another blue and yellow discoloration form on my skin, but there was nothing. The strands retracted a third time, now knowing full and well exactly where I was.

I closed my eyes, and covered my face with my left hand; leaving my empty gun on the floor.

 

Then, another shot rang out. Not a pistol this time, but a shotgun.

I opened an eye to spot Nick in the window. He’d blown a hole the size of a fist through Adam’s shoulder blade. Click-click, then another shot. Adam’s body collapsed face-first next to me, the white strands struggling to shelter themselves.

He climbed in through the window, emptying every slug he had into that body. Using my left hand and leaning against the wall, I managed to get up. I had to jump on one leg, and almost slipped on a handful of debris, but I made my way across the room. Joining Nick, I looked back, only to see the floor around Adam sprawling with these long white ringworm-looking things.

“Can… can you make it to the car?” Adam asked.

“I think so.”

“You… you go ahead. I got this.”

 

By the time I’d made it back to Nick’s car, there was a fire coming from the building. It was a pretty solid cover-up; a fire in a burnt-out building? No one would think to look twice.

Nick helped me into the passenger seat, excused himself, and stepped outside to throw up. He kept mouthing ‘oh my God’ over and over, banging his hand against the hood of the car. It took him a solid five minutes or so before he collapsed into the driver’s seat. He looked over at me. I didn’t know what to say. We just sat there for a minute.

“I’m sorry,” I said. “I didn’t know who to call.”

“No, it’s okay,” he said. “You’d be dead if you didn’t.”

“Probably, yeah.”

We just looked at each other for a moment, trying to let those words sink in. This wasn’t empty platitudes. I’d actually be dead.

 

“We gotta keep you up for 72 hours,” Nick said. “You should be good after that.”

“I’m infected?”

“Yeah. I might be too.”

He revealed a spot on his neck. A bloodstain from the shotgun blast.

“Might be nothing. I dunno. But we don’t wanna risk it.”

“Alright, yeah.”

I tried to close the car door, but my right hand still wasn’t working. Nick leaned over and closed it for me, giving me a pat on the shoulder.

“We’re gonna be okay,” he said. “If we just keep our mouths shut, we’ll be okay.”

“Sorry I got you into this,” I sighed. “Really.”

“You don’t get to do that,” Nick snapped back. “Not this time. If I’d told you about this shit earlier, maybe I could’ve-”

 

We calmed down, taking another deep breath. Well, as deep as my lungs permitted. There were no words, so I just raised my left hand at him.
