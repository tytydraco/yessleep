When I say that the attic at my parents’ house was messy, it might just be the greatest understatement I’ve ever made. For as long as I can remember, it’s been chock full of junk. You could barely make it two feet without running into a pile of boxes or some other random crap…which is why it was so strange to find it in the condition I did.



After my parents passed away in an accident, I resolved to go through that entire attic, no matter how long it would take. It took a while to gather the courage to actually go up there, but eventually I managed to push past the fear I felt. Looking back, I’m not exactly sure *why* I was afraid. Afraid of being reprimanded? Afraid of finding something I shouldn’t? I don’t know, maybe I was just creeped out by the atmosphere. The house felt depressingly empty, after all.



Anyway, when the day finally came that I stopped procrastinating on it, I took a deep breath and opened the door to the attic. It was really just a closet-like opening that led to a flight of stairs up into the main attic area, which, for whatever reason, made my anxiety surface. There was a faint layer of dust on the doorknob that dissipated as I turned it.



The first thing that hit me was the smell. A cloud of dust from who knows where assaulted my nose, and I bent over coughing for a good half minute. Even once I caught my breath, the faint smell of old wood penetrated my nose, and I tried to take small breaths to avoid that scent filling my lungs. Standing at the bottom of the attic stairs, I gazed up into the eaves, which were thankfully bright enough to see because of the two windows, one on either side of the attic. Steadying myself yet again, I headed upstairs.



You might be wondering, as I did, just how much of my parents' junk was lying around the place.



None. 



No boxes, no old board games or papers or suitcases or whatever else had been up there. The only thing in the entire attic was a small, vintage TV set sitting in the center of the room. It looked to be from the 70s or 80s, though I’m probably too young to be able to accurately tell. Its only notable features were a grey screen covering most of its surface, and a few innocuous-looking dials and buttons to the side.



I looked around the attic for about a minute, wondering what had happened. The last time I had been at my parents’ house was around a week before their death, and I remember the attic being completely full. Did they hire someone to move everything out just days before the accident? 



As this question bounced around in my mind, I turned my attention to the TV sitting curiously in the middle of the now-empty space. Sitting in front of it to get a better look, I could feel the hard wood scrape against my legs, and silently cursed my parents for never getting this area renovated. Anyway, the TV just…sat there. I didn’t really know how to operate it, so I set myself to turning the dials and pressing the buttons randomly.



After several minutes . . . nothing. Just a blank screen, and my disappointed reflection staring back at me. I sat there staring at the screen, not even sure what I was waiting for. Just…*something*. 



With a sigh, I moved to get up and head downstairs for a drink. That’s when it started up.



The screen was still blank, but I could hear the faint buzz of static. It sounded like it was trying to tune itself like an old radio, and I swear there were brief snippets of someone’s voice interlaced with the static. This went on for several minutes before an image started to come into view. It was faint at first, only coming into focus after I gently tapped the top of the TV a few times. The lines of static grey faded into color. 



I’m not sure what I expected, but the image that appeared was rather…normal, at least at first glance. It was a house in the middle of a grass field, with a detail-less, dark periwinkle sky in the background. There was something about the image that wormed its way into the primal, fearful part of my brain. It was so. . .simplistic. The house was just a rectangle, with two or three smaller rectangles representing windows, and a simple triangle roof.



And then a line of text appeared on the bottom of the screen in bold, yellow letters:



*Do you remember your home?*



I stared blankly at the TV for several moments, not really sure what to make of it. It wasn’t talking about me, that would be crazy. I only ever lived in my parent’s house as a kid.



While in the middle of that train of thought, the image of the house faded back into grey, and another image presented itself. It showed a picture of a small room, barely illuminated except for a dim bulb hanging from the ceiling. Inside the conical beam of light cast from the bulb, I could make out what looked like a dentist’s chair. It was hard to tell, but it looked like there were restraints attached to each arm of the chair, and there was a table to the side with needles and other instruments on it.



This time, the text read: *Wow, look at all the work they did!*



Next came a close-up of some kind of chamber, filled with a bubbly, dark liquid. Inside, barely visible behind the darkness, was a small, jellyfish-like blob that almost looked like…*flesh*. Variously colored tubes and wires surrounded the thing, and for some reason, it almost reminded me of a baby in a mother’s womb. I tried to push the image from my head as the accompanying text appeared on screen:



*Ahh, becoming human. Those were the days. . .*



Before I had time to process the things I was seeing, the fourth and final image faded in, this time with bits of static still flitting in and out, even once the picture came fully into focus.



It was a picture of a woman, maybe in her late 20s or early 30s, dressed in a white lab coat that hung down past her knees. She was smiling a quiet, toothless smile, and holding a small container of some kind.



Those details themselves were enough to unnerve me, but it was the thing *inside* the container that sent bile into my throat.



I’m not really sure how to describe it, aside from the fact that it looked like a human fetus sitting in a pool of the same substance that filled the chamber in the previous image. Except it wasn’t so much a fetus as it was a jumbled, fleshy gunk that reminded me more of a Rorsharch test than of a baby. Small, primitive hands reached upward toward the woman, and trails of sludge coated its skin. In the few seconds that image was on screen, I picked out several other figures in what looked like lab coats, though the lighting was still dim. And then the text came through:



*Aww, you were so cute back then.*



Reading that text is what broke me out of my trance. As the image hovered on screen for several seconds longer, I realized something. 



The woman in the picture was my *mother*. She looked different, her hair a darker color and her demeanor more reserved than I remember, but there was no mistaking her face. I knew that freckle on her neck, and her hazel eyes staring right at me through the camera made me shiver.



I didn’t wait for the next image, if there even was one. Numbly, I brought the TV downstairs and shattered it into pieces, using a nearby kitchen knife and a woodcutting axe from the garage.



I’m sitting in bed right now, trying and failing to process everything. The pieces of the broken television set are strewn about the living room a floor away, but the sense of unease that gripped me, ever since the static first started, haven’t gone away. Call me paranoid, but I double checked that every door and window in the house is locked and the blinds are all closed.



What did that TV show me? Do I even want to know?
