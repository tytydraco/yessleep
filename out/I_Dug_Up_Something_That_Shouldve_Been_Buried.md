My car rumbled to a stop on the dirt road, its headlights cutting through the thick night air. The site loomed ahead—no towering excavation pits, no scattered artifacts—just a house. A simple, ordinary house standing alone under the pale moonlight. *It didn’t belong here*. *None of us did*.

Men in black suits moved with urgency, nobody ever spoke but they understood each other. For some reason, the scene felt more like a cover-up than a dig. One of the men—tall, slim, pale—approached me. A friend, or at least someone I felt like I knew. He led me inside.

As I walked closer , the doorway felt eerily recognizable. The living room was empty, except for the concrete structure in the center and a few men standing near it  musing something unrecognizable. It wasn’t a coffin, but it felt like one—too short for a person, too solid for a mere foundation. They wasted no time. Heavy pickaxes swung down, their brutal force rattling through the floor. The deafening clang of metal striking metal was too much for my ears to bear, yet no one else flinched. As the sound sharpened, an intrusive thought took root—an axe striking a head, the sickening chorus of something moaning in agony. My stomach twisted. I turned away, repulsed, yet the sensation remained, crawling up my spine. The impact wasn’t just force—it carried something unnatural, a whisper through my bones: *"This isn’t right."*

After several blows, as the final strike landed, the structure’s foundation gave way, and the whole thing was dragged aside, exposing loose, dry sand beneath.

Then came the smell.

*Rot. Thick, putrid, almost tangible in the air*. My stomach clenched as nausea washed over me, and I covered my mouth. The others did the same. But just as suddenly as it had hit us, the smell… disappeared. It didn’t fade or disperse—it simply \*vanished.\* The air was clear again. Too clear. As if it had never been there at all.

I turned to my friend. His face mirrored my unease. But there was no time to question it—the work had to continue. We pulled on gloves and began digging. My fingers scraped against something firm, and my body stiffened. Not soft. Not hard. Somewhere in between.

*Flesh.*

My hands refused to move. My breaths turned shallow. My friend noticed the hesitation and hurriedly brushed away the remaining sand.

*A baby.*

Not skeletal. Not rotten or decomposed. \*\*Whole\*\*. Its pale, yellowish skin looked almost… fresh.

I reached for it before I could think. With the baby held against me on one hand, I start—without meaning to— unbutton my shirt. It should have been difficult. My hands should have trembled. But they didn’t. The buttons came undone effortlessly, one after the other, as if I had done this before. *As if I knew how to do this.*

I pressed the baby to my chest. My arms moved without thought, without resistance. The act was almost unconscious, as if something deeper than instinct compelled me. My breath shallow yet steady, *I tried to feed it*, not questioning why, not hesitating. It felt natural. It felt inevitable.

The others around me froze in shock and disbelief, watching me do this and waiting for something to happen. But nothing did. I held the baby against me for some minutes hoping that it would finally let me nourish it.

Gasps filled the room. Someone grabbed my shoulder and yanked me back.

*“They’re coming!”* my friend’s voice was sharp, frantic. I barely registered his words. I barely registered anything. My body felt foreign. Distant. Like it wasn’t mine anymore and the air felt strangely familiar.

The baby *slipped* from my arms, hitting the floor with a sickening, muffled thud.

And then—

*I woke up.*

My chest heaved, my sheets damp with sweat. The darkness of my room pressed down on me, the familiar outline of my bed, my walls, my door bringing no comfort. I tried to sit up—but I couldn’t move. My arms, my legs—paralyzed. My mouth refused to open. My breathing was short, ragged. I could still hear the night around me. Insects outside, the occasional rustle of leaves. But I couldn’t respond. Couldn’t call out.

The air felt very unnatural... thick, heavy, charged with something unseen. It felt just like my dream. My brain tried to dismiss the sensation, to rationalize it—but then, the smell hit me. Rot. Pungent, putrid, clinging to my throat. I swallowed hard, my stomach twisting. I looked around searching for something, anything—until they landed on the mirror across from the side of my bed. My reflection stared back, wide-eyed and breathless. My shirt—unbuttoned. My breath hitched, my pulse thundered in my ears. 

*Something was still here.*

Minutes passed—or maybe seconds, maybe hours—before the weight lifted. I was set free by someone or something that shouldn't be here. My limbs were mine again. I stood upright, stumbling out of bed and into the kitchen, gripping the counter as I gulped down a glass of water. My heartbeat hammered in my ears, but the dream was already fading, slipping through my fingers like sand.

And then—

Realization hit.

The house in my dream wasn’t some random site. The room wasn’t just any room.

It was \*my\* home and that room was \*my\* room.

The coffin-like structure—the thing we had spent the night breaking open—

was \*my\* bed.

And whatever had been buried underneath…

had been there all along.
