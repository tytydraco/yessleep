I used to work with a guy named Gilroy.  At the time he was assistant manager at the same electronics store that I did tech support and customer service, and over the three years  I was there we got to be good friends.  He was a few years older than me, but it didn’t feel that way most of the time.  He had zero ambition, was very laid back, and overall made a job out of doing as little work as possible.

When I graduated college I moved on, but he was still there, and at the time I’d have said he’d work there until he retired or died.   The pay was shit, but it was easy and low-key most of the time, particularly if you knew how to game the system like Gilroy did.  I didn’t really think about him for the next few years, but then I went on a trip with my then girlfriend.

Her family was super-loaded and had a condo at some big resort in the Caribbean.  One of these places with a hotel, condos, a golf course, five pools and like eight restaurants.  I wasn’t paying for any of it, but the prices still made me want to vomit every time we got drinks or a meal.  But anyway, that’s not the main point.

No, the main point is that one day I’m hanging out at one of the many pools trying to take a nap when I feel someone next to my ear.

“Whassup, bro?”

I jerk upright, letting out a startled yelp as I look at the guy standing next to me, laughing his ass off.

“What the fuck…Gilroy?”

**** 

I spent the next few minutes shooting the shit with him—it was the kind of awkward, grasping conversation you have with someone that you are happy to see but don’t really know that well.  We were work friends, after all, and while Gilroy was a good hang during my shift, he wasn’t someone I really knew or understood outside of that setting.

Still, gaps in my Gilroy knowledge aside, seeing him in such an expensive and ritzy locale was kind of like seeing a fish riding by on a bicycle.  I mean I was out of place but…no, I was wrong.  I was out of place, because I was insecure and felt like these people’s money and perceived passive aggressive snobbery made them superior.  

But Gilroy?  He was just as chill as when he was hanging out in the back of the store, eating gas station nachos and telling me about these European horror movies he was pirating.  And no one was looking at him weird, and when attendants came by to ask if we needed anything, it was pretty obvious that they knew him and liked him (or at least his tips) well enough.

We did that vague circle of small talk for a few minutes, but I could already feel it starting to wind down.  I’d wanted to ask it from the start, but I’d held off at first because it sounded rude in my head.  But my curiosity won out in the end.  Gilroy was in the middle of telling me about the karaoke they had on Wednesdays at the beach bar when I cut in.

“Gil, um, like how are you here, man?”  I glanced around, leaning in conspiratorally.  “I mean, I can’t afford this place—it’s my girlfriend’s family.  But like, did you win the lottery or something?”

I was worried he’d be offended, but instead he threw back his head and cawed laughter.  Pushing his long, wispy hair out of his face, he grinned at me.  “Nah, man.  I got a plan.  Everybody needs one, and brother I finally got one.”

I frowned at him.  “A plan?  A plan for what?”

He chuckled as he gestured around us.  “For this, for everything.  A life plan, a business plan.”

“Like you started a business?”

He shrugged.  “Kind of, but not really.  More like I provide a needed service for lucrative renumeration.”

Oh God.  He’s a fucking drug dealer.  Probably dealing pot and shrooms to rich old people at the resort.

His face broke into a grin.  “And no, I’m not a drug dealer.”  He waggled his eyebrows.  “Not anymore.”

I was going to ask more, but just then my girlfriend came up.  I awkwardly introduced her to Gilroy, and he was personable as always, telling her what a great guy I was before heading off.  As he started walking away, he looked back and told me he’d try to hit me up again before we left.  At the time I thought it was just one of those things you say—a polite lie to say you’d like to see someone again without any real intention of doing so.

But two days later, Gilroy called me at the condo.  This was the day before we left, and if he’d called two hours earlier or later I might been busy or not even gotten the call.  As it was, I was free and a little bored, so when he invited me to his room at the main hotel, I took him up on it.

Thirty minutes later I was walking into a large suite in the main hotel, and again I felt a sense of disorienting awe at Gilroy’s newfound station in life.  How much did this place cost a night?  And how long had he been staying there?  I asked the second question and he gave a vague shrug.

“Um, I don’t know.  Maybe like three weeks?  I stayed here before a few months back for like a month, but I think I’ll be here longer this time.”

I stared at him.  “Um, dude, like how?  I mean, I get you have a new business and all, but you can afford to vacation like this?”

Gil laughed and waggled his hand.  “I mean it is kind of a vacation, but it’s also my business.”  He reached into his shirt and pulled free a neck chain.  On the end of the chain was a long, narrow box.  It was fairly flat, but why was he wearing it under his shirt?  

He opened the box and took out a pen.  “So this little guy, well, he’s very special.”  Gil was twirling the pen slightly in the air as he spoke, his theatricality making it seem more like a magic wand than a cheap-looking clickable ink pen.

“Ok.  How is it special?”

Gilroy held up his hand.  “We’ll get to that.  Damn, dude.  Don’t rush me.  You’re going to ruin the moment.”

I laughed nervously.  “Oh, sorry. Go ahead.”

Apparently satisfied, he nodded and went on.  “So my stepdaddy sent this to me from Thailand.  He…well, he was married to my mom when she died, and after that he moved to Thailand and became some kind of salesman or something.  I dunno.  He wasn’t a bad guy, but I hadn’t heard from him in like, what?  Twenty years?  And then he mails me a package out of the blue.  Got a ton of stamps on the outside and on the inside is a note and this pen.”

“Okay.  What did the note say?”

“Basically just that he was sorry for bailing on me, that he didn’t have a lot of regrets but he wished he’d been a better father for me.  Said he’d made his fortune with the pen and that now it was time for me to make mine.”

I snickered slightly.  “What does it do?  Print money?”

Gilroy’s smile was strange.  “Actually kinda.  In a way.”  He waved his hand.  “But anyway, the last part of the note was just instructions.  Oh, I forgot, at the top of the note it said in big letters to not touch the pen until I’d read the note.  Then the instructions at the bottom were like:  to use the pen, just click it once.  BUT, make sure you are alone in a locked place that you can get things out of without people seeing.”  He gave another laugh.  “It sounded sketch as fuck, but it’s a pen, right?  So I wasn’t too worried.”

His expression grew more serious as he let out a small sigh.  “Still, I did listen to the note.  I went home, locked the door, waited until almost midnight.  After putting down the blinds in my living room, I went ahead and clicked the pen.”

I realized I was leaning forward on the sofa I was sitting on.  “And?”

Gilroy stood up and beckoned for me to follow him.  “Come in here and I’ll show you.”

He lead me into a massive master bathroom with a huge sunken tub on the far end.  He went up the two steps to the edge of the tub and was leaning over it with the pen when he paused and looked back at me.

“Dude, when I click this, you’re going to want to freak out.  You cannot freak out, okay?”

I frowned at him.  “Why am I going to freak out?”

He shook his head.  “It’s better to just show you.  But I need to know you are going to be cool.  You going to be cool?”

I didn’t know what kind of dumb shit joke this was, but I was starting to get irritated.  Rolling my eyes, I gave a shrug. “Yeah, yeah.  I’ll be cool.”

Gilroy squinted at me for a moment before turning back to the pen.

And then he clicked it.

The next instant, I heard a thud as a large shape appeared out of thin air and landed in the bottom of the tub.  My heart was already pounding in my chest, and I was already having to fight a powerful urge to run out of the room.  “What the fuck…what the fuck is that?”

Gilroy grinned and waved me closer.  “Come see for yourself.”

“I…I don’t think I…”

It was his turn to roll his eyes.  “Don’t be a puss.  Get over here and look.”

My legs felt loose as I edged a few steps closer.  Close enough that I could see there was a naked man laying in the bottom of the tub.

“Jesus Christ.”

Gilroy raised a finger.  “No, though I thank you for the compliment.”

I tore my eyes from the body back to him.  “Is he dead?”

“Oh yeah.  Super dead.  I mean he’s very freshly dead, but super dead.”

Looking back in the tub, I realized the body wasn’t the only thing in there.  The man was surrounded by mounds of ice.

“What the fuck is this?  Where did he come from?”

“The pen, dude.  I told you.  The pen.”

My mouth felt like I’d been eating sand.  “That’s fucking impossible.”

Gilroy gestured to the tub.  “And yet here this handsome fucker is.”

“W-who is he?”

He let out a short laugh.  “That’s the best fucking part.”

Leaning down, he grabbed the man’s shoulder and pulled him up enough that I could see the profile of the man’s face.  I recognized it right away.

Gilroy was beaming as he let go and the body slumped back into the ice.  Meanwhile, my stomach was trying to swallow my lungs.  I felt like shouting, but when my voice came out, it was barely a hoarse whisper.

“What the fuck is this?”

His grin got wider as he reached forward and grabbed my shoulder, giving it a shake.  “It’s fucking me, dude.  It’s fucking [me](https://www.reddit.com/r/Verastahl/). "
