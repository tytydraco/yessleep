Hello everyone...never thought I would do this, but I need to talk. I need someone to know what i know , even if they won't believe me.

I'm a normal guy, just like everyone else . My life is very ordinary: work, then home, maybe a bit too much solitude. The only thing that gives me a sense of comfort or escape from this monotony is the sky. Ever since I was a child, I've loved looking at the stars. It's a strange feeling, looking at things millions of light-years away, things our ancestors saw, and perhaps generations long after us will see. It makes you feel incredibly small, but also part of something immensely larger.

About a year ago, I decided to take this interest to another level. I saved up and bought a telescope. Not exactly professional grade, but a decent one. It magnifies the view and lets me see more details on the moon, nearby planets, and sometimes distant star clusters or faint nebulae if the sky is clear. Most nights, I go up to our building's rooftop, as far away from the street noise and city lights as I can manage. I sit there for hours, in the quiet of the night, the sound of the cool breeze, just focused on the telescope's eyepiece. The whole world disappears, leaving only me and the tiny point of light I'm observing.

Many nights passed in the same routine. I'd align the telescope to a specific region of the sky and just contemplate. Sometimes I'd look at Jupiter and its faint rings, other times at Mars with its distinct red hue, and often I'd just get lost in the endless sea of stars. I used to feel a strange peace, a peace I couldn't find anywhere else.

Until one night, about two months ago. That night changed everything.

I was on the rooftop as usual. The weather was nice, the sky relatively clear. I had an eyepiece attached that gave me a slightly wider field of view, wanting to scan an area dense with stars. As I slowly moved the telescope, I noticed something odd. A point of light, like an ordinary star, but... it wasn't stationary.

At first, I thought maybe my hand had shaken, or perhaps it was a very distant aircraft. I focused harder. No, not an airplane. Airplanes follow straight or gently curved paths, and they have blinking lights. This was a steady point of light, just like a star, but it was moving. And it wasn't moving like the satellites we sometimes see crossing the sky at a constant speed in a straight line. No, this thing was moving in a way that was... impossible.

It was making sharp, acute angles, stopping abruptly, then shooting off in another direction at high speed, only to slow down again and trace something like... a strange geometric shape. Initially, I thought I might be hallucinating, maybe my eyes were strained from focusing too long. I pulled my eye away from the eyepiece, looked up at the sky directly. Of course, I saw nothing but the familiar, fixed stars. I returned to the telescope, aimed it at the same region. There it was! Still there, still moving in that same crazy manner.

My heart started beating faster. What was this? A spy satellite? But what kind of satellite performs these kinds of aerobatics? A drone? What drone could reach that altitude and appear like a star? My mind raced, searching for any logical explanation, anything to hold onto. I found nothing.

I kept tracking it with my eye and the telescope for about an hour. It was tracing bizarre shapes in a small patch of the sky. Complex patterns, like intersecting lines, curves, and sharp angles, then suddenly it would vanish or move so fast I'd lose it.

I came down from the rooftop feeling a mixture of shock, anxiety, and intense curiosity. I didn't know what I had just seen. I spent the whole night thinking. Could it be a rare optical phenomenon? A specific light reflection? A problem with the telescope itself? But the telescope worked perfectly fine with all the other stars and planets. And this phenomenon was very specific, localized to that single point.

The next day, I went up to the rooftop a bit earlier, before the time I'd seen the phenomenon. I was tense, expectant. Same area of the sky, same telescope settings. And indeed, at roughly the same time, it appeared again. The same point of light, the same impossible movements. This time, I was more focused. I tried to follow its path meticulously. It was tracing the exact same shapes I had seen the night before! Not similar shapes, no, precisely the same ones! The same angles, the same pauses, the same speeds.

This is where it went beyond coincidence or natural phenomena, or even a conventional satellite. Something tracing the same complex pattern every night, in the same spot, at the same time? This wasn't natural. This was... intentional.

A faint sense of dread started creeping into me. The idea of "aliens" or "UFOs" had always been just science fiction and movies to me. I never seriously considered it. But what I was seeing had no earthly explanation I could logically arrive at. If it wasn't aliens in a craft... then what?

The third night, I went up armed with a notebook and pen. I started observing the point as it moved, trying my best to sketch the path it was taking. It was incredibly difficult; the movement was fast, the shapes complex, and my hand wasn't steady enough. But I was determined. I drew jagged lines, dots, angles, trying to capture any part of this pattern. Every night, I went up and drew. Every night, the same movements repeated with the same meticulous precision.

I began comparing the drawings from different nights. The same sequence, the same strange geometric figures. It wasn't just movement anymore; it felt more like a message being written across the sky. But a message from whom? And why? And what did it mean?

The first week passed like this. I became obsessed. My work started to suffer, my sleep dwindled. During the day, I'd think about what I saw at night, and at night, I was perched on the rooftop, fixated on that moving point of light. I started feeling utterly alone in the world, holding a secret nobody knew, and nobody would likely believe if I told them.

I considered telling a friend once. We were sitting at a café, and I was very hesitant. Finally, I vaguely hinted that I was seeing strange things in the sky with my telescope. He looked at me and said, "Man, you must be seeing things, maybe it's just a plane or a satellite and you're making a big deal out of it." I tried to explain that the movement wasn't normal, that it repeated, but he just laughed and said, "Alright man, next time film it and show us."

The idea of filming it had occurred to me, of course. I tried recording with my phone camera through the telescope eyepiece. But the image came out extremely shaky and unclear, and the point of light was so small it barely showed up as a pixel or two moving erratically in the video. There was no solid physical proof I could present. I went back to the notebook and pen.

Every night, I added a new piece to the drawing, like assembling a large, complex puzzle. I started noticing that these shapes weren't just random lines. There was repetition, a certain symmetry. Like a strange visual language. I would stare at these drawings for hours, trying to understand them. Was it a map? Chemical symbols? The design for some machine?

Time passed, and I still didn't understand anything. The feeling of helplessness grew. I was witnessing something happening right before my eyes every night, something that could potentially be the most important discovery in human history, and I couldn't comprehend it or report it to anyone convincingly. The fear began to evolve. It wasn't just fear of the unknown anymore; it became fear of what this message might actually be saying. If it was a message, who was sending it with such power that it barely appeared as a moving star? And what level of importance or danger would warrant such an effort?

I started searching online for anything similar. Amateur astronomy forums, conspiracy theory websites, anything. I found no description matching what I was seeing. Everything was either mundane sightings of satellites or planes, or clearly fabricated videos. What I was seeing was different. It was real, persistent, and terrifyingly organized.

Over time, the drawing in my notebook started to take shape. I now had a complete sequence of the movements the point made over about an hour and a half each night. An incredibly complex drawing, filled with minute details. I'd look at it, feeling like the key was right in front of me, but I couldn't find the door.

One night, as I was looking at the drawing, comparing it to the previous night's to ensure accuracy, I noticed something. In a specific part of the drawing, there seemed to be... a certain ratio that repeated between the lengths of particular lines and specific angles. A mathematical ratio. Something like the Golden Ratio, perhaps, but much more complex.

I thought to myself, "Wait a minute... what if these aren't visual symbols in the traditional sense? What if they're... equations? What if it's the language of mathematics?"

They call mathematics the language of the universe. Maybe whoever is sending this message knows that the only way to communicate with any other civilization, regardless of their language or form, is through mathematical constants and logic.

This idea sent a shiver down my spine. If this was math, then I needed someone who understood highly complex mathematics to decipher it. My education is average; my highest level of math was in high school. But this idea opened a new door.

I began focusing on the drawing from a mathematical perspective. Looking for numerical patterns, for known constants like Pi (π) or Euler's number (e). It was like trying to crack an impossible code. I spent days and nights trying to apply the simple math I knew, searching online for advanced mathematical concepts that might relate to these shapes. Chaos Theory, Fractal Geometry – things I'd never even heard of before.

I felt like a blind person feeling their way through a dark maze. Every time I felt I was getting close to something, I'd hit a dead end. But I didn't give up. The feeling that the answer was near, that this message had meaning, was stronger than any frustration.

To avoid suspicion or questions about the source of these shapes, I started using a tactic. I joined specialized math forums online, presenting small fragments of the drawing as "abstract mathematical problems" or "geometric puzzles" I was trying to solve as a hobby. I framed them in a context completely removed from astronomy or anything unusual.

The reactions were mixed. Many people said they were just meaningless scribbles with no clear mathematical significance. Others tried to find patterns but arrived at illogical conclusions. However, a small minority, likely academics or people deeply versed in pure mathematics, were intrigued by the complexity and symmetry in these shapes. They began discussing hypotheses, talking about the possibility that they represented a specific type of complex mathematical function or an unconventional mathematical system.

I followed these discussions eagerly, gathering any information, any thread that might lead me somewhere. I started understanding new terminology, learning about branches of mathematics I didn't know existed. And I began applying these ideas to the complete drawing I possessed.

Slowly, gradually, the picture began to clear. It wasn't just a single equation; it was a series of interconnected mathematical equations and concepts, layered on top of each other. Each part of the drawing represented a variable, a constant, or a specific calculation. It was a purely mathematical language, completely abstract, devoid of any form of spoken or written language we know.

I spent several more weeks on this painstaking work. Connecting the parts, trying to find the logic governing the sequence. It felt like solving the hardest equation of my life. And the closer I got to the solution, the more the fear inside me grew. Because I started sensing the nature of the message. It wasn't a message of welcome, nor a map to a cosmic treasure, nor the design for a devastating weapon. It carried a sense of urgency... and of pain.

Until I reached the crucial moment. After long nights of sleeplessness, concentration, and calculations (aided by online tools and the discussions on the specialized forums I interacted with very cautiously), I managed to piece it all together. I was able to "translate" this mathematical message into a concept that we humans could grasp.

The result... was simpler and more horrifying than anything I could have possibly imagined.

The message wasn't coming from a spacecraft orbiting this star. Nor from a civilization living on a planet orbiting it.

The message was coming from the star itself.

I don't understand how, and I don't know if this is scientifically possible or not. Can stars possess consciousness? Can they be living beings in a way completely different from our understanding of life? I don't know, and that's not the important part right now. What matters is the content of the message.

All those complex geometric shapes and impossible movements, when translated from the abstract, universal language of mathematics, conveyed one simple, terrifying meaning – a meaning understandable to any living being anywhere in the universe that might have reached a certain level of understanding of the fundamental laws of physics and mathematics.

The equations described a specific physical state... a state of rapid, unexpected internal collapse. A state of imminent stellar death.

And the final message, the culmination of all these movements, was the mathematical equivalent of a simple phrase composed of two core concepts:

"Help request."
"Imminent end / Death."

Or simply, in human terms:

"Help us. We are dying."

I sat there, staring at the notebook, at the final equation, frozen in place. Unable to move, unable to think. The coldness I felt in that moment wasn't from the rooftop air; it came from the depths of the cosmos itself.

A dying star. A conscious star, or at least one capable of communication somehow, sending a distress call across the vast expanse of space. A plea written in the language of mathematics so that anyone might understand it.

And that someone... was me. An ordinary young man sitting on a rooftop in a distant country, with a modest telescope. I was the one who cracked the code. I was the one who heard the scream.

A scream that had been traveling for how many light-years to reach here? Tens? Hundreds? Thousands? Millions? Where exactly is this star? Is it even still there, or is this just an echo of a voice that died long, long ago?

And what could I possibly do? Who am I to help a dying star? What help could I offer? Even if I knew its exact location, even if I notified every space agency in the world, what would they do? Send a spaceship that would take millions of years to arrive? And if it arrived, what could it possibly do?

The sense of absolute helplessness was crushing. The feeling of cosmic loneliness became deeper, more terrifying. We aren't just small in this universe; we are also frighteningly powerless. We hear the cries for help from our cosmic neighbors, and we can do absolutely nothing.

That night, after deciphering the code, I went back up to the rooftop. I pointed the telescope at the same spot. The point of light was still there. Still tracing the same complex geometric shapes in the cold silence of space. Still sending the same desperate message.

"Help us. We are dying."

This time, I wasn't looking at it with curiosity or fear of the unknown. I was looking at it with profound sadness, and a terrible sense of guilt. I knew. I understood. And I could do nothing.

The sky, where I used to find peace and escape, had transformed for me into a vast graveyard filled with stars dying in silence, or screaming pleas for help that no one hears, or those who hear cannot answer.

Every night now, I go up to the rooftop. Not to enjoy the stars, but because... I honestly don't know why. Maybe to bear witness. Maybe so that this scream doesn't just echo into the void completely alone. I sit and watch this point as it draws its message of death, knowing that a real star, a massive entity perhaps the size of our sun or larger, is collapsing and crying for help somewhere far away in the darkness.

The biggest problem is that a realization like this changes everything. How can I go back to living my ordinary life knowing what I know? How can I care about trivial problems of work, money, and relationships, when I know that beings the size of stars are pleading for help in the universe around us?


I still go up to the rooftop every night. And the point of light still traces the same pattern. The same equation. The same scream.

"Help us. We are dying."

And I don't know what to do. And I don't know if there's anyone else, anywhere else in this universe, seeing the same message, and feeling the same helplessness that I feel right now.

Just the thought that this message might be traced across the skies of other planets, before the eyes of other beings, each one standing alone, as helpless as I am... that thought makes me want to scream.

But I hold it in. And I just keep watching in silence. Maybe that's all I can do.
