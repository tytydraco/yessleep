[Part One ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1cr15zf/why_our_local_police_stopped_using_facebook/)

  
There are dozens of cases like Joseph’s all across J.A County. 



A woman who left her home walking to work and never walked back. Her name was Anna Hearth. The only hint to her disappearance is that strange activity was found on her Facebook profile. We believed it indicated a pattern, or more precisely a method of selecting victims. Though despite all of them being active quite regularly on Facebook and living in J.A county nothing else links these victims together.



As far as I and the rest of J.A County’s finest have pieced together this all started a month ago with the first victim, Carl Hauster. His front door was left wide open leaving his 6 year old daughter home alone. Luckily, she was found unharmed by her mother only a few hours later.



To be honest, we are nowhere closer to solving this case than we were when it started and that was made painfully clear recently.



I was sitting at the desk twiddling my thumbs watching the clock drag on. At that time,  I always hated sitting at a desk being away from any possible action. It’s not that common that a sleepy little place like J.A County has a kidnapping endemic. Though someone has to watch the place, and those someones are myself, Cynthia Bell, and Justin Gomez.



Cynthia is an older cranky woman. It wouldn’t surprise me if she was the first woman cop ever. Justin was chill though, a recent transfer from somewhere I forgot. I think North Carolina. 



“Ring-Ding”.



The  familiar sound came from the computer across from Justin. I only saw the side off his face but he looked ill.



“You alright?” I asked him but he didn’t respond.



“You good?”



“...”



“Eh..” I went over to his desk. The JA County Police Facebook page was open with a message on bottom right. A single photo of an office space with a laptop on top of a desk with different stickers on it and pictures frames turned away from the camera. It looked fairly innocent.



Justin stood up,” I need to make a call.” He said as he left.



I took a second look. The name of the user was Joseph Ryder.



“Joseph Ryder” I repeated just for myself to hear.  “That’s a sick joke.”



Justin had walked back into the room. “I need to go, she isn’t answering.”



“Who?”



“My Wife, that’s her home office.”



I didn’t know what to say.



“Ring-Ding!”



I turned back to the computer, the same photo but the window was now shattered with blood dripping from the broken glass.



“I’ll call it in” Justin walked off while I only got static on my radio. “Wait, I’ll come with you.” I said as he ran out the door.



“Cynthia! See if you can reach anybody on your radio.” I said running after Justin.



“What’s going on?” she asked.



“Justin’s wife.”



After going out the front door I saw Justin in his car and went around the side.



“I told Cynthia to radio it in”



He turned the key but the car didn’t start. He tried again but it stalled. “Damn it!” He said, throwing his fist onto the steering wheel. “Do you have a signal?” He asked. I tried to call anyone but they all dropped one after another while Justin worked the radio. There was no luck on either front.



“Fuck” he stormed outta the car. “I’m gonna run till I see a car.” 



“Wait, let me see if Cynthia can lend her car” he kept jogging forward till he suddenly stopped dead in his tracks. “John?”



A pale looking man started shambling towards us from the woods. He  wore a blue police uniform full of rips and dragged a bum leg behind him.  I wouldn’t have recognized him if Justin didn’t say his name.



“You alright man?” The second the words left my mouth his head jolted up and let off an ear ripping screech before bursting into a full sprint at me. I reached for my gun but heard two shots pop off and John fell to the ground. 



“We need to go inside,” were words I made out through the buzzing and ringing in my ears.



“You saw his face? That shit ain’t normal. He was gonna… We need to go. Now.” He said, shaking me out of my trance.



Dozens of people started stumbling out of the woodwork all looking very similar to John. pale almost pure white husks of themselves with dead beady eyes. Dozens of them.  I wasted no time getting back inside and moving the desks to barricade the door with Justin.



“What the hell you guys doing?!” Cynthia asked.



“Somethings not right,” I said.



“That’s a fucking understatement!” Justin said.” Help us bar the windows and the back door”



“Jesus,” She said, doing the cross with her hands.



The Husks started banging down trying to force their way inside and then almost simultaneously the room filled with a fury of familiar rings and dings.  Almost hypnotized, I went over to look and saw the Ja County Police Facebook page was drowning in messages. Random images that weren’t loading, voice messages, and nonsensical text but then the page refreshed.



“ A live stream” I said out loud.



“Stop looking at that and help us!” Justin said.



I started hyperventilating.. “We’re being broadcasted”



“What?” Justin came up and said“ Where are they recording from?” As if the camera heard us, the perspective of the live stream shifted sporadically. 



Cynthia's scream brought us back to the moment. Three of them managed to crawl through a busted window and Justin didn’t miss a beat popping a shell into each one of them. I was deaf for a moment, but when my ears readjusted I wished they hadn’t. All the Husks outside started screeching and throwing themselves against every opening.



“Hurry, cover the window with the cabinet. Justin said, sprinting down the hall.



Despite her shock and being an older woman Cynthia seemed more put together than myself. I had to keep reminding myself to move and to breathe.



Justin had opened the weapon locker and pulled out rifles and ammunition. “ We need to force our way out of here and get help.



Cynthia racked a rifle and didn’t say a word.



“Ye..Yeah.” I stammered out. 



They looked at each other and then back to me. “ Pull yourself together, it’s now or never.”



Before a word left my mouth every light in the station blacked out. The screeching had stopped, but in its place was a low hum. It grew louder as the seconds passed. It felt like something I may have heard before but can’t explain the tune.



A sloping sound hit the floor behind us. I almost tripped over Justin or  Cynthia backing away from it. I wasn’t sure who. I was too focused on the slithering sound it made across the floor as the tune grew louder “Where is it?”



“What?” Justin asked.



“You don’t hear that?”



“Hear what?” Cynthia asked.



A blaring static sound rattled out from the computer before a woman came onto the screen. She had a bloody gash across her face with a chunk missing from her neck.



 “Mi Vida Bomboncito?”



I didn’t understand what she said at that moment but I saw Justin’s face in the light from the monitor. He was visibly shaking before crying out in Spanish. I couldn’t catch what he said but his eyes were full of tears. 



The lights came back on and Justin’s eyes remained fixed to the screen. “Justin?” He didn’t react.



“Cynthia?” She wasn’t with us.

“Cynthia?!” I called out.



Gun fire boomed from the restroom down the hall. I burst in shakily handling my gun. Several gunshots were fired into a mirror and Cynthia stood only a few feet away holding the rifle with shards of glass embedded in hands, and arms.



“Leave.” Cythnia said.



“What?”



“Leave!” she said pointing the rifle at me.



“Hey, calm down it’s me” 



“LEAVE!  Charles.”



“Charles?” She racked the rifle and I ran.  I didn’t know who Charles was and I didn’t want to.



“Justin. We need to leave.” His eyes remained  fixed to the black screen. I pulled his arm and he didn’t move.  



“Ring-Ding”.



A voice message from a user whose name was just a string of text. I don’t know why but I clicked play, the voice..The voice was my mom.



“Alan, I missed you. Why don’t you visit me anymore?”



“Ring-Ding”.



“Alan, why won’t you talk to me?”



“Answer me!”



“Now!”. She screamed ”This is why you’re nobody and nothing just like your father.”



My anger boiled over, not at her words but at the very idea of someone using my dead mother’s voice to hurt me.



I grabbed the computer ready to slam it to the ground when… 



I couldn’t breathe, there was a white hot pain on the side of my waist. “You shot me?” I said to Justin before blacking out. 



I woke up a few days later in a hospital room all alone. I had a dulling aching pain on the side of my waist.



I found out later that Justin called 911 and got me and Cynthia to the hospital. Cynthia was sedated and held on another floor while Justin was answering questions to the state police.

I was questioned but I didn’t know what to tell them but the truth. I thought they wouldn’t believe me but they seemed more willing to listen than I originally expected. I in turn, asked for the truth, 



“What happened to everyone else?”



Every police officer not in the station that day is still missing. The state police issued a warning that J.A County and several nearby counties should refrain from Facebook unless absolutely necessary. The details as to why they need to do this are being kept hush hush. 



It’s just a warning without much or any context.



It won’t really help anyone.



This is why I made these posts. To be a warning, to share the stories of those who went missing and to find the truth.



However terrifying it might be.
