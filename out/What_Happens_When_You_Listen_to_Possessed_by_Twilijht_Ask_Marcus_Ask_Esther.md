Marcus wasn’t the type to get caught up in anything strange. He was practical, focused. His taste in music was whatever came on the radio or what his friends sent him, but he didn’t seek much else. That was until he stumbled upon Possessed by Twilijht. It came up in his feed—just a recommendation. Something about the cover art piqued his curiosity. He clicked. Listened.

At first, he thought it was just another weird track. The kind you listen to once, shrug at, and move on. But something about the sound—the way it twisted and warped as it played—stuck with him. He wasn’t one to go down the rabbit hole of dark music, but this? It was different.

The first time he played it on his headphones, he felt a shift in the air. He didn’t tell anyone about it. He didn’t even acknowledge it to himself. But he couldn’t stop listening. It was a strange pull—almost magnetic. Something about the song felt like it was calling him. Calling to him, but not the Marcus he knew.

He played it in the car the next day. Played it at work. Even played it as he walked through the grocery store, music thrumming through his ears. He started isolating himself, tuning out conversations, just letting the track guide him through the day. His coworkers noticed. His friends, too. He was quieter, more withdrawn. But he just shrugged it off. It was just a song. Right?

Then things started to get strange. It wasn’t just the music anymore. It was what came with it. His thoughts began to feel out of place, like they weren’t his own. He kept hearing things in the song—things behind the sounds. Whispers, static, vibrations, frequencies that didn’t belong. He thought he was imagining it, but it was persistent. Constant.

Marcus stopped eating regular meals. Said the song fed him in ways food couldn’t. He stopped replying to texts, answering calls, or leaving his apartment. His roommates were concerned, but when they tried to confront him, he didn’t respond. He wouldn’t even look at them. He just played the track—louder now, with the bass thumping so hard it rattled the walls.

One night, his cousin knocked on his door. No answer. So he slipped a note under it. When Marcus finally opened the door, his eyes were different. There was something vacant there, like he wasn’t really looking at anything. Just through it. His cousin asked if everything was okay, but Marcus didn’t speak. He just handed him the note that read: “7.” Nothing else.

Days passed, and his behavior grew more erratic. His whole life was reduced to the song, the 7, and the shadows in his apartment. He wrote strange things on scraps of paper—numbers, symbols, fragments of sentences. His walls were covered with them. The more he scribbled, the more obsessed he became. His friends and family gave up on trying to reach him.

Marcus stopped talking altogether. He began pacing in circles, humming softly under his breath. His apartment—now a shrine to Possessed by Twilijht—became a place no one dared to visit. The music played in a loop, an endless cycle. His phone was silent. He never left.

The only thing anyone ever heard from him again was a voicemail left on his cousin’s phone. All it said was: “I’m not here. But I’m here. The song’s in me now. And it’s showing me how to move through the walls. 7 is the answer.”

That was weeks ago. Now, people only talk about Marcus in whispers. Some say he’s still locked in his apartment, but they don’t know for sure. His phone is off. His social media dormant. His family keeps quiet. But there’s a strange energy around his place. Like it’s waiting for something.

They say the song never left. That it found him instead.
