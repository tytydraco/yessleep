It appeared one day many moons ago. A blot in our sky; a harsh black that stained the soft blue. A strange orb that seemed to warp and absorb the light around it, like a miniature black hole. It hung above the lower clouds, but below the atmospheric clouds, and remained so, so still. It hovered in place, perpetually, hanging directly above us. There was always a brief period of time around midday in which the sun would pass over the orb, casting our small town into complete shadow, in a somewhat faux-eclipse. Conspiracies ran rampant as to what this visitor was - some subscribed to aliens, some to some covert military operation, some to some divine intervention. None of that mattered, at the end of it all.

No theory would have saved us.

We hoped this would at least give us national coverage, bring some attention to our small town and up our tourism at least. We might as well make the most of this unknown entity haunting our skies to imburse our profits, our council thought. When we reached out, instead of being met with news crews flocking en masse to us, we were met with men in black suits offering hush money to our mayor. An announcement was made to ignore what we had dubbed ‘The Observer’, and carry on life as usual. There was an outcry, of course, but the hush money helped recoup our dwindling little town -  helped revitalize our declining economy. People needed the jobs; needed the money. We just had to accept The Observer as a part of our lives. 

Ever-present. Ever-looming. Ever-*watching*.

As the days turned to weeks, and weeks into months, most people had silently accepted The Observer’s gaze. A silent anxiety that had burrowed into the back of everybody’s brain, a dread that a collective pact had been signed to repress. For the greater of our society, after all. Yet some could not sign that pact. Some studied in secret, examining through telescopes, sending drones as high as they could in an attempt to get close to The Observer; some revolted against the masses’ and councils’ chosen ignorance; some went mad with conspiracy, and were either left to fester in their homes or took to streets to preach their perceived truths. Particularly disruptive individuals, usually of the latter two groups, were taken away by the same men in black that had made a deal with our council, never to be seen again. Long-time residents that were once functioning, normal people that were driven to rebellion or insanity, and they were made an example of. It was clear that there were two choices: be complacent, and carry on as usual, or disappear. Soon, it was discovered that our small town had been completely wiped off any satellite navigation software, replaced by a blurry mosaic in the green countryside. It was clear that the people higher up, the people pulling all the strings, did not want anyone to know what was going on in our town, or about The Observer. It was upon this realization people started to leave. Every single one of them were paid their very own hush money by our council, no doubt funded by the men in black, to sign a confidentiality form. The consequences of breaking its terms, obviously, meant disappearing. Some people tried to leave without accepting the money and signing the form in an attempt to get the word out to the rest of the world - they were unsuccessful, and, seeing as we never received the help we so desperately needed, were promptly made to disappear soon after escaping. 

A year would pass. Our town had become wholly disconnected from the rest of the world, our only glimpses of the rest of humanity came from the repeating programs on TV - none of which were more recent than when The Observer first appeared. We were being contained. Information about The Observer was being contained. We were lab rats, guinea pigs, subjected to The Observer’s gaze, and forced to seclude and comply just because this unknowable entity had chosen to grace our small town. It was unfair. 

But what was there to do?

Resistance was pointless. That much had been made clear to us. And so we lived in our little bubble, pretending to live normal lives. Pretending that the TV didn’t just show the same news broadcast as yesterday. Pretending that the council truly had its residents’ best interests at heart. Pretending that The Observer didn’t seem to inch closer, day by day.

We had become robots, programmed to the same routine every day. It was as if everybody was entranced. A stupor induced by numbing repetition and forced ignorance. Even a single moment of clarity could result in all the bottled up emotion to erupt, and so we collectively pushed it all down to keep functioning as a society. That’s not to say some people didn’t break. They did. So many did. So many people tried to break us free, but they were all met with the men in black suits, and were never seen again. Some self-isolated, growing mad in the confines of their homes. Some, unable to bear it all, seeing no light at the end of the tunnel, took their own lives. And we had no choice but to just carry on. Our community had become a shell of its former self, spurred on by the tribal instinct to keep our society running, no matter how arbitrary our existences had been made. We are human. We had to keep the cogs turning, even if the cogs were detached from the machine.

The black blot in the sky seemed to get bigger. The shadow it cast encompassed more and more of our town. The Observer was getting closer. And closer.

And closer. 

The days grew darker as the shadow it cast got larger. Its true, gargantuan scale becoming more real and more terrifying every day. We could pretend no longer. We could not ignore it once our sky had turned to ebon mass and sunlight could seldom reach us. People were scared. People panicked. Yet, when they had tried to leave, they found themselves barricaded in. The entire surrounding woods around our town had been restricted by electrical wire, and men in black, unmarked riot gear. We were met with force at our attempts at escape.

We had been forced into a fate we did not want, since the very beginning.

It hung directly above us. Hovering roughly 100 feet above our town’s tallest building, the mayoral building. It remained dormant a few more days, unmoving. We could make it the finer details of its texture now. It was somewhat glossy, its surface looking like imperfectly smelted metal, its sheen pulsating and writhing in the light - yet oily, like it was coated in a substance that refracted light and gave it color that flickered on its otherwise entirely black surface. Through its center, however, a seam ran, ridged inwards, only visible as the darkness in between had no luster nor texture, suggesting only shadow. It was said that it looked like a closed eyelid.

It was all too apt of an observation.

A morning drowned in shadow, like every recent morning. We could only gaze at The Observer in speculation as we tried to simply exist as normal people, but even that luxury would be ripped from us on that day. Everything would be taken away. We would never know normality again, or have the potential for it. What happened that day, changed reality. Broke it. There was never any normal when such a thing had the potential to exist. I shall retell what happened that day, and you shall find it all too vivid. All too real. After it all, what I saw had burned itself into my retinas. Into my very brain.

Its eyelid yawned open, accompanied by a rumbling akin to the very earth splitting open.

From it emerged light. So much light. Our town that had been shadowed for so long now bathed in boundless light. Every color ever perceptible to the human eye spilled from the cracked open eye of The Observer. Colors danced and swirled in the very air, streaming from its retinas. It all looked like what could be described as an infinite, boundless aurora. To say it was awe inducing would be reductive. No sight could come close. Until we would look up.

After years, we would lock eyes with The Observer. Its gaze finally meeting ours. 

There no was no white of the eye. Instead, a sea of swirling colors flowed endlessly, churning in a manner non-euclidean and defying dimension - every color somehow existing all at once. Warm yet cold, harmonious yet discordant, familiar yet alien. In it I saw the endless birth of the universe, ever-expanding and infinite. I saw planets dying, suns exploding, and galaxies crumbling. I saw visions of the past, present, and future. I saw time that ran parallel to ours. I had become acutely aware of every atom in my body. I could feel as though I could control them to my own will, as if I could restructure my very being. I could feel as though I had gained the knowledge to reshape every single being to my design. A profound understanding of all things real and unreal. As I gazed into the depths of knowledge perceivable and unperceivable, my gaze drew closer to the center of it all. The masses of color that coalesced at a single focal point right in the middle of its eye. A gaping abyss. A black hole. The vivid visions had ceased and been replaced by complete emptiness. Void. Absolute nothing. I felt everything all at once before, now I felt the true *absolute* absence of *anything*. Yet from the darkness, a voice raptured from its depths in a manner that sounded almost human. It sounded like a cacophony of sound familiar to the human brain, like an amalgamation of known sounds and language known to our race. It was akin to a broken radio, some sense could be made of the garbled sound, until it attuned itself to me, and made itself a voice that could speak to me and only me. The voice of my mother. A voice I hadn’t heard in many, many years. It spoke to me. Slowly, but reassuringly, in her usual comforting tone.

“Little sunshine… Let go… Take my hand… Join me… *Us*… Happy… *Together….”*

From the abyss, my mother’s hand extended out to me. I reached out to grab it. Our fingertips almost met, but pangs of reality shot back through me. I saw my hand reaching out into the boundless chasm of The Observer’s iris. And nothing more. I was able to reject The Observer’s influence, somehow. Yet my eyes could not escape its gaze, no matter how hard I tried to pull away. Some magnetic force drew my eyes toward it, as if it was forcing me to bear it. I could feel its fury coursing through me. Its rage. It was going to make me suffer for not succumbing to its influence. I could feel my retinas burning with a heat indescribable, like a soldering iron forced in the stars had been pressed into them. I tried so hard to close my eyes, but it wasn’t good enough. I could hear every single person in the town at once, their voices screaming at me through some psychic connection. Their cries of resistance. Then, their willingness to submit. I saw visions of familiar faces, their eyes swirling with color and an abyssal iris at its center. I fought, and fought, and fought. I mustered some control over my nervous system once more, and inched my eyelids closer together, brain on the verge of melting. It took everything I had to make the final push.

I closed my eyes.

In an instant, everything snapped back to reality. No more voices. No more burning. I fell to the ground and stared directly at it, tears and blood streaming from my eyes. So long as I didn’t look up, The Observer could not influence me. And so I stared at the ground, and stayed there, unmoving. I could only hear The Observer’s rumbling, and beneath it the shuffling of its now dominated thralls. The thralls that were once my townspeople.

Eventually, it left. Along with everyone else. I was left the sole inhabitant of the town. The town that no longer exists. A town that had been scrubbed clean off of the history books. And now, everywhere I look, I see visions of cosmic ruin overlapped with reality. Flames of every color, every intensity enveloping everything. I glimpsed the truth of all that is real and unreal, and have been subjected to sensation unknown to any other man during that time that seemed so brief yet so long when I locked eyes with The Observer. I can never return to normalcy. That does not exist for me. And so I stay in my childhood home, in the town I had always known, writing this.

The memoir of The Observer’s sole survivor.

Now, many years after that fateful day, I exist among the rest of you. You may think me a simple blind old man, but I am not blind. I see more than you could ever imagine. I see beyond our reality, and the reality beyond that. I wear the shades to hide my eyes. The eyes that swirl with colors incomprehensible. The eyes that contain an abyss at its center. The eyes of The Observer.
