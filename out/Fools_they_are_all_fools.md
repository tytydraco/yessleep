Expect this to be  a very condescending post, I don't give a shit about your emotions and I don't give a shit about their feelings as well.

Who would have know that I would fit so perfectly in society, people really are dumber than expected, it is so easy to fit in society and many people will believe in you if you show a bit of kindness and will present themselves to you only to be the victims of my knife afterwards.

Oh, I have enjoyed watching their faces as they beg for my mercy, fools, they beg a person without mercy in his heart for mercy and it is absolutely hilarious. The look on their faces and their cries make me sleep so peacefully at night.

I remember that fool Randall Briggs, the fucker  who used to bully me that got an injury that crippled him for life at the age of 26. I never forgave the fool and I am happy to see his football career go to an early end, he's gotten out of shape and his wife pushes him around on a wheelchair but deep inside, I still don't feel satisfied with what happened to Randall and I wanted to inflict pain on him myself.

I never really got the chance and I never got the chance to see him at work because his crippled ass stays at home being a useless piece of shit and his wife is forced to work her ass off to feed her useless husband, Sheila Briggs. She was the girl who peaked at high school and she still looks pretty nowadays. She's chordial towards me and acts properly as a school teacher but I always wondered how the hell does she stay with that useless fuck when I have more money than that vegetable.

But the perfect opportunity arrived, I saw them walking down the pavement at 10:00 o'clock and I just had the best idea, hitting two birds with one stone is an offer I cannot refuse, so I put ketamine on the drinks I bought from McDonald's originally intended for my consumption and I will offer those to them instead.

I pushed on the pedal and quickly caught up to them and I stopped. I lowered my windows and called out to them in a gentle voice, "hey Sheila, it's dark out here, mind if I offer your guys a ride home?" I asked and the bitch was happy to take the offer, "hey Randall, long time no see", I greeted the vegetable and smiled at him. "Hop along" I said to Sheila and I got out of my car to help get Randall and his wheelchair in my car.

"Thank you Simon, you really are a good person" said Sheila, "it's no problem and I'm just helping my friends" I nodded, I looked at Randall and I see remorse in his eyes and that I can sense that he feels sorry for himself and wants to ask for my forgiveness but I don't forgive shits like him and I will end him on my own terms.

"You guys must be thirsty and hungry for walking in the night" I said, feigning concern.
"Yeah, we can't wait to get home and eat our dinner" Sheila replied, "I still have a big mac and a chicken sandwich here and three drinks, why don't you guys eat it while we're on our way" I offered kindly. Sheila refused but I insisted and she gave in, she took the food and drinks and they both ate. 

They clearly are starving and each ate the food they received, of course, they didn't forget to thank me and that was nice but I didn't think that they will like what I will do to them. They both drank the drinks I gave them and almost immediately they started to feel the side effects.

I'm outside of a warehouse right now and they're inside of my car unconscious, I will post about what I did to them later so catch ya later.
