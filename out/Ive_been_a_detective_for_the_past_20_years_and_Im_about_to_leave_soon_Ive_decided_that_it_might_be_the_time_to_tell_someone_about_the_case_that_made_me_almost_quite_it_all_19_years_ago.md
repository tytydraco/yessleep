It was February 2005 and I was a starting detective. my career hasn’t exactly taken off to say the least. I mean sure I had a couple good cases but nothing to big to make me a name.
well that was until that day. I was called into my Sergeant office, if I’m being honest I was sure he is going to fire me and tell me my service is no longer needed. but to my surprise he called me because he had a case for me. at first I was ecstatic of the thought, but that soon died down after I heard the details. “A missing teenage girl? really sir?” I asked him, I didn’t meant to be rude but I expected something more big and important than just a missing person case, let alone a teenager. 
sometimes I wish I just turned around and left the room when he told me that or would have take me off the case after my reaction, but it didn’t happened and I was sent to a small town in the middle of nowhere.

when I got to Blackfelid my gut told me I should turn around and not look back, but yet again like that idiot I am I stayed and started my job. when I got to the girl house I was met with her hysterical parents, a couple name Betty and Joe. they looked nice enough even with all the drama that was floating around. the girl which I learned was named Emily was 16 years old. apparently that morning when Betty went to wake her up she wasn’t in her bed nor the house, and after further looking and a few phone calls I showed up. 
that was all the information I could have gotten out of Joe at least, Betty was no use between the crying and the screaming while Joe was busy holding her tight. 

after getting what I could from him I decided to go inside Emily’s room to see what I could find. her room looked fairly normal at first glance. she had a queen size bed at the far left of the room and a writing table in front of it. she also had a black closet in front of the door. over all like I said a normal room. I looked  inside drawers and the closet, under and up the bed and in every possible place but found nothing. from what it seemed Emily was a normal girl with no much to hide. after that I started to think about places she might gone to and people she knew. with the help of Joe and Betty I’ve made a list of all this places and people giving that they well.. we’re her parents? they are the ones that suppose to know her best, but still talking to them I felt something off. 

after we gathered the list I was on my way. the first place I went to was a small dinner named: “the old lady”. it looked relatively normal like your everyday dinner, busy tables full with people on their lunch break and old folks that probably didn’t have to much to do so they spend their days in that place. I asked around to see if people knew Emily here and sure enough they did. she was regular, coming in everyday at exactly 03:47pm according to the staff. unfortunately she didn’t came in that day and non of them saw her. so much for a great start. 

after I left I decided to go to and see some of Emily’s friends, the first one I met was a girl named Sasha, she was also 16 and looked like a nice girl in all. the moment I told her that Emily is missing she jumped in to action asking all kind of questions, she looked like she worried about her friend and her fate. I asked her the usual questions:
 “did she acted different lately? when you last saw her? she mentioned anything unusual? where do you think she might have went?” Sasha answered on every question I had almost perfectly, so much that you would have thought that our conversation was by script. now remembering all of that I wish I was more suspicious, that I investigated harder, but no. I was stupid and thought I’m better than this and just wanted to be over this. 

after leaving Sasha I didn’t have much, she said that everything was normal and this wasn’t like Emily. yeah right I thought. 
they are never like that.

later I went and met several more friends of Emily, all giving me pretty much the same answers but in different fonts.
I was about to give up on that road while still having one more friend to interview. I decided f this I’m gonna still question her because honestly why not? I’ve already spent a lot of time here.
I don’t know if this was the best or worst decision I’ve ever had.

the last friend was named Kim, when I met her I immediately knew something was wrong with her. I also knew that what ever she has to tell me is going to be different from what the others said. while the others I met at their houses I met Kim in a public park not far from Emily’s house. when I met her she looked very nervous, looking around all the time almost like expecting someone to jump behind her. 
I’ve asked her all the questions I asked the others and she answered the same answers like them. 
I was annoyed to say the least. those girls knew something and wouldn’t tell me what it was. I didn’t get it. Emily was their friend, they didn’t want to help us find her? we’re they a part of this? I wanted to believe they aren’t but they made it very hard.

as I was finishing and leaving Kim called me and grabbed my shoulder, I turned around and saw that she looked very nervous even more than before. she told me that she will tell me what she actually knows. I was skeptical but still stayed and listened. 
she told me about a club named: “the yacht”, a very popular place among the teenagers in Blackfelid apparently. she told me about how Emily and her friends used to go their almost every night to party and get wasted until the early hours of the morning. 
I found it a bit worrying but not to much because a lot of teenagers  go and sneak out to party. god knows I did. 
but before I could say anything she continued, she told me about a guy that Emily met there named Caleb. he was 23 and worked there as a bartender, him and Emily has been dating for months apparently with no one knowing except from their friends. they were also having a lot of troubles, always fighting and having arguments, breaking up and making up all the time. than she told me the part that really got to me, he was hitting her. all the time. and they knew and did absolutely nothing. but this wasn’t over because than she told me that the night before Emily came knocking on her door at 2am after he beat the crap out of her. she didn’t have where to go and knew that her parents would be very mad for the all ordeal so she ended up there. after a lot of crying and talking she decided to leave him for good. then she said she was going home and they will talk in the morning. and here we are.
something told me Emily didn’t make it to the morning.

after Kim told me all of that I thanked her and was about to leave when she asked me if I think Emily is ok, the truth was that I didn’t but I couldn’t say that so I just said that I’ll try my best to find her and was headed to the club. 
by this point it was around 11pm and I was exhausted and just wanted to sleep in my bed in the city but I couldn’t. I still had a job that had to be done and something in me knew that whatever I’m going to find isn’t going to be pretty to say the least. 
as I came to the club I took a good look of the building, it looked old and rusty and like it haven’t been used for years, even though that every aim of my body told me to not go in I still did. 
as I walked in I found it very weird and suspicious that they weren’t any security in the entrance nor anybody for that matter. how can it be that a very popular club didn’t have a basic thing like that? even the shittiest clubs had security. 
inside the place was empty and looked deserted, as I walked around I saw that there is one person at the bar, Caleb. 
he looked like a pretty normal guy, fit and tall and definitely had good hair but not my cup of tea, I could see why younger girls would be attracted to him.

I walked over and sat at the bar, he didn’t noticed me at first but after a moment he did and said: “hey men the club is closed for the night.” I just acted surprised and defeated as I answered: “really dude? I can really use a drink right now after the day that I had.” he looked like he think for a moment and then he poured me a shot of vodka. bingo.
as I was drinking I suddenly heard a young woman voice behind me saying: “babe when you are going to be done?” the voice was oddly familiar. I turned around and to my shock I saw Sasha, she saw me too and said something but before I realized what she said I was hit by something in the face. before I knew it I was on the floor fighting with someone that I soon realized was Caleb. we were hitting each other’s like our life depended on it which I guess was true on some level. at some point I was on top of him and couldn’t hold back and just screamed at him: “WHERE DID YOU PUT HER BODY YOU SICK BASTARD? WHAT SHE EVER DID TO YOU!?” and than he punched me in the face and I blacked out.

when I woke up two days later in the hospital I was told I had severe concussion that put me in a temporary come. I was also told what happened in those two days while I was out. apparently the police was called and was actually at the scene when I screamed at Caleb and was knocked out. they took me to the hospital and Caleb for questioning giving they heard me. to my other shock he didn’t deny anything and answered all of the questions they asked. he told them about how he followed Emily that night to Kim’s house and realized he was screwed so he waited until she left to her car and knocked her out. I won’t go to the details but let’s just say it was a quick and painless death.
than he said how he immediately regretted it so he went and confessed to Sasha which was in a relationship with him. than she helped him getting rid of the body by throwing it inside a dump not far from the town, thinking they will never be caught. she was also stupid enough to brag about it with her friends that were more than willing to save this secret. except from Kim that the guilt was eating her. 
soon after Caleb was convicted with first degree murder and a life sentence. Sasha and the rest except from Kim were giving each 30 years in prison for being accomplished in crime. Kim was giving 2 years on probation that she aced through with no problem. I was out of work for a while due to the injury but was giving a batch of honor and became a well known detective.
the story was a big deal back than and still some what remembered even today all this years later.
I still keep in contact with Kim, she got married a few years back and recently had a beautiful daughter that she named Emily. 

as I’m leaving my position today after 20 years and many different cases I can say that this case still will be the most sad and tragic and yet some what of terrifying that I’ve handled.
