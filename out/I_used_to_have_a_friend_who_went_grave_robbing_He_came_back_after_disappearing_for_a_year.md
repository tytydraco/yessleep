If you're not familiar with everything that happened last year, you could catch up on my previous [entries.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/yuewqd/i_have_a_friend_who_goes_grave_robbing_and_he/)

Honestly, this feels so weird. Writing here again. I never expected I'd have anything else to update, and yet, here I am. I thought things would go back to normal, but I was wrong.

It started with this weird dream I had. I usually forget my dreams, but I could recall this one almost perfectly, even now. It wasn't the only dream I'd had about Theo, but it was the one that really stuck with me. And I'll tell you why.

I was back in my old house, the one where it all happened. In the kitchen, making some tea. Midnight. Outside, pitch black. It was so dark I couldn't make out anything - it was as if someone hung a black curtain over the window. I heart the kettle wheezing, so I took it off the stove, but the high pitch noise continued. I looked around, but the room did not give out anything strange. Then the noise stopped.

'Hey.'

His voice was so crisp, so close, that it startled me. I looked around again, yet saw no one. Just my empty kitchen and the long hallway.

'I can't see you.'

'I'm out the window.'

The kettle in my hand felt so heavy, that I could barely hold it. I wanted to put it on the table, but something stopped me and I remained still, clutching it. I slowly looked up, at the window, but again, the scenery was swallowed by this indescribable darkness.

'I can't see you.'

'Turn off the light.'

Staring out the window, I suddenly felt vulnerable. I felt on display for whoever - or whatever - was out there, unable to look back at them. Like prey.

I backed away and, without glancing away from the window, reached for the light switch, then flicked it off. The room drowned in darkness, and I clutched the kettle tighter, fear creeping up my spine. I had my back to the hallway. What if someone was there?

As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, the outside of the window started coming back to life. I could make out outlines and shadows, and someone, standing really close to the glass.

'Is that you? What are you doing there? Didn't you die?' I mumbled.

'I did. I need to tell you something, but I can't come inside.'

'Why?'

'You need to come outside. I'll be waiting for you at the door.'

His silhouette then disappeared from the window, and I was left alone. I turned the light back on, but that didn't comfort me. My heart was pounding, and my head, spinning. I had this sense of impending doom, this need to get out, but, somehow, I felt that staying inside the house was the safest.

That's when I heard the knock, coming from my front door, across the long, dark hallway.

The same knock that had pierced the silence, that one night.

Against my wishes, I found myself standing in front of the door.

'Theo?'

'Dan? I need your help. Can I come in?'

'No, you can't. I can't... allow you here. Not anymore. Not after what happened the last time.'

'It's not the same. I just need you to let me in, or come out. Just come out, please.'

I was so tempted to look through the peephole. I could hear Theo on the other side, breathing. He was waiting.

'What do you want to tell me?'

'You need to come outside. Don't look through the peephole, Dan.'

'Why not?'

'Trust me.'

I stared at the kettle in my hand. For some reason, I still hadn't put it down. I was beginning to feel dizzy from the anxiety, so I positioned my eye in front of the peephole, trying to make out something in the darkness.

I only saw a lighter spot, greyish, moving up and down, really close to the door. I finally understood it was a face, long and bony, but, as much as I tried to look at the eyes, by brain was blocking them out.

'Theo, is that you?'

'You shouldn't have looked.'

It *looked* like Theo, but not quite. *If only I could see the eyes, I'd know for sure.* I thought.

'What do you want?'

'For you to wake up and lock your door.'

My heart stopped beating. 'What? My door is locked. My door is locked. My door is locked...'

'Not that one. The bathroom door.'

Confusion swept over me. I felt lightheaded, my chest suddenly hollow, and the kettle, incredibly heavy.

'Theo...'

My breaths were sharp and I was sweating. Shaking, I looked inside the heavy kettle.

Right there stood my own beating heart.

The terror pierced through my slumber and woke me up. I scanned the room, desperate, panicked, but didn't notice anything. Just a white line below the bathroom door, indicating the light was on.

I turned to my wife, still sleeping. 'Paula? Paula.'

'... yeah?'

'Did you leave the bathroom light on?'

'No. I don't go to the bathroom during the night. You know that.' She mumbled, pulling the blanket over her head.

I slowly stood up from the bed and stepped towards the bathroom door. I placed my hand on the doorknob.

The house was silent and dark. I could only hear my wife's quiet breathing and a few cars passing outside. And, yet, placing my ear on the wood, I became certain that someone else was on the other side of the door. Twisting the doorknob, I pushed the door open, only to reveal nothing. The bathroom was empty, but the window was open. Had I left it open like that?

Outside, the darkness outlined vaguely some branches, swaying in the wind. I stared blankly, not knowing what to do. Eventually, I closed the door and turned off the light. I laid back in bed, but sleep refused to come, so I watched TV until sunrise.

That was a few nights ago, and since then I can't shake off the feeling of being watched.

Yesterday I was out in the back yard, on the phone with some coworker. At some point, they asked me if everything was alright, because I had fallen silent.

How could I explain to them that I was staring at what I'd calculated to be the bathroom window? How could I tell them that I was in denial? Because I refused to accept not one tree in my backyard could have reached it with its branches, no matter how hard the wind blew? That whatever movement I'd seen that night was not what I thought it was?

I haven't felt so scared in a long time. My wife and my son don't understand why I threw out the kettle and bought a new one, or why I insisted we install locks on all the doors of the house, including the basement door.

I feel like I need to prepare for something, but I don't know what it is.
