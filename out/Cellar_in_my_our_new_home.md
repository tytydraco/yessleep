So I've never posted on reddit, ever. We recently moved into a new home, a MASSIVE house, I've converted it from Meters to feet and acres, the house is around 6495ftÂ² and the yard itself is around 4 acres, and this is in town, unsual size for a single yard.4 Bedroom house, 1 room with a trap door cellar, need a keen eye to spot the cellar door. 1 big kitchen with an extra part as the wash up area, 2 bathrooms and a very big living room.

 Now take note that in my country, South Africa, cellars are very, and I mean VERY uncommon, as are basements. Now, we decided out of curiosity one night to head down into the cellar, there is an old photo of a child, no more than 3 years old, taped dead centre on the cellar floor, a broken mirror around it with dead rats, a ton of old photos, and old letters that are illegible (old style handwriting and they're torn a lot because the cellar is super humid). 

The dates are from oldest to newest between 1889 on the photos and the letters are 1907, hand written, we moved them into a cupboard just outside the cellar trap door, I wanted to make a kind of a man cave down there but now I'm terrified.

 Also note that these actions were on Tuesday night the 28th of January 2025, it is now 01 Feb Saturday 00:20 AM, and weird stuff started happening over the past few days, the alarm system sends messages to my phone when activated and immediately reports wich zones have been triggered when set off, and it's the room with the cellar, 2 nights in a row, always around 3AM, now I went there to show a friend over video call, and the ceiling fan was running, and that made me uneasy, because we have AC in all the rooms, why would that be on?

 My gf says she wouldn't use it either, I'm 21 she's 18, we live alone. This is getting super long I know, but as I was standing there about to leave I saw the curtain pull away, like a gust was blowing, but it wasn't waving in the wind. It pulled to a direction, stayed there for a good 15 seconds, and dropped back into place, I observed this ordeal for a good 5 minutes, then went to close the open window, wich was closed already.

 I left the room and I'm now in our main bedroom typing this, waiting for the alarm to be triggered again. We invited friends over tonight and we had a BBQ here, we moved in last saturday, the 25th, and we wanted to celebrate the first week, as we were traversing around the house, he stepped on a loose plank in a doorway, by the room across the one with the cellar, we have wood floors.

 It's an extremely old house, and I lifted up 2 more floorboards, and it revealed another hidden onderground room, wich I have yet to discover the entrance to, but in this room there is a bunch of super old rope, and wire coils, rusted up, and a sh#tload of charcoal lining the floorboards, and the room's floor. I have no idea what's going on, and I have no idea what to do, I'm nowhere near family, not even remotely, and I feel super uneasy. Reddit, should I get a priest out? 

P.S this is really the truth. No over the top paranormal activity or something, small things that are actively happening as I'm typing this... No lies, I am growing a big fear of the cellar, I feel it's sinister, but I've never had supernatural interactions ever, as said I don't even believe that ghosts and stuff can realistically exist.
