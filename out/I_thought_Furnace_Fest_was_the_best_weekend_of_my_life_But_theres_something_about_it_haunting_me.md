Furnace Fest 2023 is all wrapped. From September 22-24, thousands gathered at the Sloss Furnace grounds in Birmingham, Alabama for three days of hardcore, emo and punk bands, loads of nostalgia, reunions of bands that hadn't played in a decade or more, and a meeting of friends from all over. It was a truly incredible time and I could spend hours raving about my favorite sets and moments from it. But that's not what this is about.

As soon as I entered the grounds Friday morning and wandered around the booths while waiting for noon when the first bands would start I noticed someone unusual. A middle aged man was standing off to the side under a bridge. He was wearing a black suit and tie. Now it goes without saying that is not something you commonly see at a music fest, nor is it the most comfortable thing to be wearing outside in the 80+F weather we had. And upon closer inspection this appeared to be like a rather expensive Italian suit....not something you'd want to be wearing here with all of the dust and in throngs of sweaty people. He didn't appear to have a wrist band on either, although maybe it was just covered by his cuff of the suit. But then the strangest thing I noticed...I couldn't see any shoes. Instead his pants just ran long and and the ends of them were on the ground....not even the toes of shoes sticking out from underneath.

But I just thought "whatever" and walked back to the core of the fest grounds and to a tent to order a drink.

The first couple bands I saw were insane, especially No Cure, a local one that despite being nowhere near as well known as the rest absolutely riled up the crowd and got a truly crazy mosh pit and stage diving going. I was already thinking "oh yeah this is going to be amazing" and was thrilled.

But then came With Blood Comes Cleansing. They were a Christian deathcore band from the latter half of the 00s, and was playing their first show in 13 years. I wasn't exactly a huge fan, but it seemed like a can't miss set. And indeed it was very good. The crowd was into it, the pit was going crazy, I was a bit in the back because this wasn't one of the main bands I came for, but I was still enjoying it. And then I noticed the main in the suit off to the side and behind me also watching.

And...he didn't look happy. He stood there with his arms crossed, his suit somehow without any stains, and a scowl on his face. Also no one standing nearby him as crowded as the place was.

Then about midway through their set the WBCC vocalist after a song gave a typical speech thanking everyone for coming out and how much it means to them so many people cared so much to see them here. And then also said that they started the band to give the message that there is a God and that he loves each and every person in that crowd very deeply and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. And the crowd all cheered including me.

But I glanced back and saw the man still there. He didn't cheer...and in fact looked furious. His skin was actually a bit of an odd red tint almost...like he got sunburned all over. And I swear...it's almost like his eyes were lighting up in fire. They looked red from the distance. And I just saw pure anger in him at that. A bit weird....why even see their set?

Later in the set the pit increased in size and people swarmed to the back, thus pushing me back as well....and near the man. And then I could see why people stayed away from him....it got hotter and hotter the closer I got to him. Like the guy was just radiating heat. Later I backed away...but things were weird.

After the set I tried to forget the strange thing that occurred and mostly did. I was into the other bands and enjoying myself. Walls of Jericho and Hopesfall had amazing sets, and MxPx was a great cap to the night. I had completely forgotten about the man in the suit.

Then came Saturday. I walked up to the gates very stoked again. After all today I would be seeing one of my favorite bands Thursday playing all of their album "War All The Time". And I got in early because an awesome band Foreign Hands was opening at noon, and indeed they rocked indeed. I was enjoying myself until Zao played.

Nothing wrong with Zao...they were incredible....but midway through their set I saw him again. The man in the suit off the side. The suit looked the same...so he either had it dry cleaned overnight or had a multiple one. Still no shoes. And a look of sheer rage on his face. This guy seemed to not like Christian bands...but he was showing up to their set specifically, dressed in a suit. Something was off here.

Luckily the next couple bands made me forget him again...until HolyName started. This was Tommy Green, formerly of Sleeping Giant and xDEATHSTARx's new band, and a personal friend of my pastor back home and her husband. In fact, he had presided over their wedding. So I had to catch half of their set (only half was possible because midway through Thursday started and I was not missing a minute of that.)

Being Tommy Green and how openly Christian this band was, he started out mentioning it was first show, and then saying he was going to pray and said if you were OK with it you could pray with him. So most of the crowd bowed their heads and closed their eyes and a lot raised their hands. I did too....but just before that I noticed the main in the suit off to the side. I tried to forget about him while we prayed, but I opened my eyes a bit before the end and couldn't resist glancing at him.

He wasn't praying needless to say. His arms were crossed, his head up, his eyes open...his skin with that weird very deep sunburn look, and his eyes almost inflamed again. Then their set started, and though I tried to ignore him and focus on the awesome set and the amazing pit, every time I saw him in a glance it was sheer rage.

There was one exception. A bit into the set Tommy mentioned one of his friends from the band Beloved couldn't be here today because he's a youth pastor, and one of the girls in her youth group's brother was recently murdered. He was asked to preside over the funeral, which was today. And he suggested we all pray for that family again.

I noticed while he spoke on that the man in the suit had a smirk on his face. For the first time all fest, he looked happy and pleased. But after we prayed for that family I glanced at him again, he seemed pretty annoyed.

I rushed over to Thursday later and had the time of my life, and kept it going until Turnstile closed that night. Again at the end I was so beaming the man in the suit was a low priority.

I only had one run in with him on Sunday, before the As Cities Burn set. This time I found myself too close to him at the beginning, same guy, same suit, no visible shoes. This was just too weird. But as the crowd shifted I found myself too close to him...and the heat overwhelmed me again. And then he grabbed my wrist.

It felt like my wrist was against a hot stove. And I was upset and worried, Furnace Fest is such a supportive and great community things like groping from guys are quite rare, it's never happened to me before. I struggled and pulled my wrist away and ran around the back of the crowd to a completely different spot to watch the set.

I never saw him for the rest of the fest, and was able to enjoy myself. By the time Monday came he had slipped my mind mostly. I just focused on my flights back home, and sharing photos, stories, and talking about the incredible weekend I just had. I felt like shit on Tuesday...the old "festival flu" at it again, along with my fatigue and achiness, but it was worth it.

Until today when I glanced at my wrist where he had grabbed me. I noticed a bit of a burn mark...but not like a typical one when you have your skin against a hot object. It seems to be forming in a shape...and now it's clear, it's some sort of upside down pentagram. There's a Satanic symbol on my wrist where I was grabbed.

I'm now just posting this because I don't even know what else to do.
