It was a peaceful afternoon and sun is at peak of lightness and no clouds, straight from a movie scene. I sat on the ground, helping younger students with their karate training. The sun was warm, the air calm. Everything felt normal.

Then, suddenly, a loud scream broke the silence.

We all turned to look. A short distance away, a group of students stood frozen in fear. At first, I didn’t understand what was happening. Then, I saw them.

Bears.

A group of them had appeared out of nowhere. In the middle of the chaos, a tiny bear cub lay lifeless on the ground. A snake, now dead, was curled up near it. The mother bear let out a deep, heart-wrenching roar. It had lost its baby.

For a moment, we didn’t move. We weren’t the ones who hurt the cub, but the bears didn’t know that. They only saw us standing there. And then, without warning, they charged straight at us.

“Run!” someone shouted.

And just like that, everyone scattered. My body locked up for a second. My mind screamed at me to move, but fear held me in place. Then, when I finally snapped out of it, I realized something terrible—

I was the only one left behind.

Panic shot through me like fire. I turned and ran as fast as I could. My heart was pounding. The ground felt like it was shaking beneath my feet as the bears chased us down. I could hear their heavy footsteps, their angry growls getting louder.

The outer gate!

I saw it up ahead. If I could just reach it, I might escape. But then—

A huge bear stepped in front of me.

I skidded to a stop, my breath stuck in my throat. My way out was blocked. I turned to look behind me. The other bears were still coming. There was no escape.

Trapped.

For a moment, my body froze again. My brain raced for a solution, but there was no time to think.

And then—an idea flashed in my mind.

A crazy, reckless idea. The kind you only see in movies.

Instead of running away, I ran toward the bear.

Everything around me disappeared. All I could hear was my own heartbeat. My legs moved on their own, pushing forward as fast as they could. The bear charged too. My mind screamed—this is it!

At the last second, just like in an action scene, I dodged to the side.

Darkness.

And then—I woke up.

My chest was rising and falling like I had just run a marathon. My hands were shaking. But something felt strange. Even though I was awake, I couldn’t open my eyes. My body refused to move.

I forced myself to breathe slowly. In. Out. In. Out.

After what felt like forever, I finally calmed down. My eyes opened. I was safe in my room. The night was quiet, as if nothing had ever happened.

And after all that? I simply turned over and went back to sleep.

I keep thinking-how crazy can dreams be?
