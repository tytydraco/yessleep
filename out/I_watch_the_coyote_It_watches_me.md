My name is Melanie. I’m twenty three years old and I’m clinically depressed. Not pulling for sympathy here or anything, just stating a fact. I couldn’t tell you when it started and I don’t think it’ll ever end. I’ve mourned a lot in my twenty three years and I’d like to think it shaped me into the shell of a human I am today. My daily functions are toggled like that of a sim’s. Going through the motions and doing only the things I know are essential to my survival, though, I’m not really sure what my purpose here is. They say grief gets better with time. That one day, it won’t hurt as much. That’s bullshit. The feelings of grief come and go like waves lapping the shore. It begs the question, if it always comes back does it ever really leave? 

I’d been to two funerals before age twelve. Both distant relatives that I hadn’t seen since I was a toddler. Their passing, specifically, didn’t thwart me much. However, the process of a funeral, an open casket, my little feet padding closer to a dead body, it was as if my consciousness began there. Where some saw a celebration of a life well lived, I saw the black and unforgiving maw of death through the eyes of a child. 

It’s safe to say I wasn’t the same. Anxiety taunted me at night and I spent four years sleeping on the floor in my parent’s bedroom. My mom was my comfort and my dad was my protector. As long as they were by my side, I’d be okay. 

“Shelia is getting a horse?!” My ten year old self exclaimed. I’d been lost in the rain droplets on the car window, choosing a particularly supple drop with my index finger. I traced it as it raced down the window towards the finish line, worthy opponents on all sides. But my focus on my champion was snapped by my parents speaking in hushed tones. I heard Shelia, my mom’s friend. And I heard horse. 

“No, Mel, not a horse.” My dad replied in tangent, earning a look from my mother I’d only seen before I was scolded. My parents locked eyes at the red light, seeming to have some sort of telepathic conversation with their eyes. They did that a lot. My mom sighed then, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Shelia is getting a divorce.” 

“What’s a divorce?” I asked. I’d never heard the word before. I was an only child at the time with two doting parents so, can you blame me?

“A divorce is when a husband and a wife, well, stop being husband and wife. They break up, essentially, and go their separate ways.” My mom explained, her words ringing in my ears as panic increased in my naive heart.  

“You and dad won’t get a divorce right?” I asked, the words spilling frantically from me. It never occurred to me that this was something plausible. Shelia’s daughter, my friend Megan, must’ve been going through the worst of times. 

“Sweetheart no, your mother and I are very much in love. It’s true love, in fact. You know nothing can stop true love.” My dad reassured me and my mom smiled. I was at ease. My dad was the king, my mom the queen, and I their one and only princess. My life was perfect. Divorce wouldn’t tear my family apart and with them by my side, I’d be okay. 

How stupid of me. Two years later I’m seated on the couch with my mom, our dog curled up in between us. My dad, seated on the loveseat in front of me, is offering up platitudes and reassurances. I hear what he’s saying and it registers in my mind…but it’s like watching the news during a tragedy. The reporters spill information out and the tv drones on but you become awash in some dreadful emotion that tugs you down like a swift current. You can drown while sitting perfectly still in your own home. 

“I’ll still be there for your cross country meets and band concerts.” 

It hadn’t even been a full twenty four hours since my mom found out, and my dad was already slipping from me the way the sun dips behind the clouds. I wanted to shout at him, scream at him, curse his name, and maybe even slap him. But I simply said, “Okay,” while glancing down at my hands, my torn up nail beds. 

I’ll spare you the gory details as much as possible, but it’s bleak. My dad had cheated on my mom with my children’s minister at church. A kind woman I’d come to trust over the years, as I’d frequented that church since I was a baby. The coming months were messy. My dad found new living arrangements. I tried to put on an excited face for him and his new house but all I felt was dread. Then, a few weeks later, the big one happened. What could be worse than adultery, impending divorce, and separating households you might ask? A pregnancy. My forty two year old mom was unexpectedly pregnant. The pregnancy itself was nothing short of miraculous. My mom shouldn’t have been able to have anymore children. She’d had some procedures, emergency cyst removal, and was down a whole fallopian tube. So somehow, in the midst of our shared anguish, my mom and I had to navigate uncharted territory entirely. 

Little did I know, at the time, my baby sister would be our salvation. She arrived early, like I had, entering this world with a round head, a button nose, and a shock of strawberry blonde hair. She breathed life back into me and my mom. Our days were busier and there wasn’t time to focus on the bleak, melancholy of it all. At thirteen, I held my infant sister in my arms, teary-eyed with my cousins at my side. At twenty three, I’m watching her run towards me off the school bus. 

“You’re in pajamas again.” She says, sidestepping me to reach for the doorknob. 

“Astute.” I reply and follow her into the house. Our routine hardly changes. I wake up around noon, wait for her to come home, she gets a snack and goes to read or watch tv, and I just…exist. Sometimes, I’ll remember to eat. Sometimes I’ll listen to a podcast while doing laundry, creepy stories droning through my headphones, sometimes I’ll draw. Or, most days, I crawl back into bed and lie still until my mom gets home. When she does, we’ll talk for roughly twenty minutes and I’ll revert back to my room and glide under the covers once more. Like I said, you can drown while staying perfectly still in your own home. I’ve lost a lot that I will never get back. My grandparents on my mom’s side, to old age. My grandpa on my dad’s, to cancer. My cousin, to suicide. My baby, to miscarriage. My dad, to another family. 

When you don’t see someone for a while, you start to forget their face. In my mind, it’s like in anime, where an unimportant character you won’t see again is talking and the top half of their face is blackened out, the animators not even bothering to draw any detail above the mouth. You’ll forget smile lines, forehead wrinkles, tattoos, things like that. If enough time passes, even their voice is lost on you. 

The house is dark now. I stand in the kitchen absentmindedly filling my cup with ice, then water. It’s snowing, in Tennessee, our one snowfall of the year. It collects and piles on the grass outside and if I stand close enough to the glass back door, I’ll feel the cold air on the other side of it. The house is quiet and empty. My mother and sister are on a trip with my sister’s cheer squad. I stayed behind, I don’t do well on trips anymore. 

When you float through life aimlessly you aren’t as privy to things. My focus is never wholly on anything in particular, and what a more alert person might pick up on, drifts past me like a winter wind. 

My corgi is on high alert, snapping me out of a daze. Her ears flatten against her head, her little body standing at attention by the back door. A low growl emanates from her. 

“Dude, hush.” I tell her. She’d bark at a leaf if the wind stirred it. Another low growl escapes her and she stands stock still. I sit down on the couch with a sigh, drape my blanket over my legs, pick up my ipad and stylus and resume my drawing. I begin to shade my sketch, losing myself in the process and droning out all other thought but my art. After a while, I glance at the stove clock, half an hour has passed. And my corgi is still standing at attention by the back door. “Come here Winnie.” I call to her, patting the couch. Usually, that sequence incites a rush of paws and fur into my lap and an excited pup in my arms. Not now, not this time. Her pointed ears flatten again and she whines, not a growl, but a whimper. The dim lamp light beside me flickers and the bulb hums and buzzes before the light it gives off dies out entirely. I move from the couch and scoop Winnie up in my arms, glancing over my shoulder to the yard beyond the glass. I live in a sprawling neighborhood, with homes so close together you could throw a rock and hit at least a few in one go. My neighbors all conveniently have fenced in yards, with six foot gaps in between them on all sides. We could afford our house, not the fencing. Animals traipse to and fro in our yard often. My large neighborhood is bordered by thick, dense woods. It’s not uncommon for me to spy a rabbit or two during the spring, or a doe and her fawn on the outskirts of the running trail in front of the neighborhood. So when I see an animalistic silhouette, I’m not alarmed. 

“Geez dude, it’s just a-“ I flick on the backyard light. It only casts a little light into the space, illuminating sparkling snow and Winnie’s paw prints. The light falls just short of whatever is out there but it’s unmistakable to me now. Glowing eyes peer into the glass door set above a hewn snout. Dark lines of the animal’s slender silhouette reveal perked up ears, gangly body, and a puffy tail. A coyote, not uncommon for these parts, I’m just grateful I hadn’t decided to let Winnie out for a bathroom break. “It’s just a coyote.” I tell her as she wriggles in my arms. “It can’t hurt you in here.” I tell her again, opting to take her upstairs to my room, lest the coyote provoke her malice once more. 

After an hour, Winnie tires herself out in my bed, splayed out with her back legs in the air, sound asleep. By this point, it’s around eleven pm and I’m far from tired. I make my way downstairs and fiddle with the lamp. The bulb isn’t just burnt out, I realize, it’s completely blackened from top to bottom. I head to fetch a replacement from the bin in our garage, passing the kitchen and the glass door to my backyard as I go. I stiffen, sort of halted in that middle space of my home. I turn my head, that deep innate fear that I’m being watched isn’t easily ignored. A dark blanket of unease falls over me like a billow of snow that glides off the roof when it begins to melt. I cast my gaze through the glass door and see the coyote, its position unchanged, save for the fact that it was now seated on its haunches and staring directly into my home. 

“What the fuck?” 

I should preface, I am google’s strongest soldier. After retrieving a new bulb from the garage, and locking eyes with the ever present coyote as I pass through the kitchen, I tap away at the keys and in a moment I’m presented with a more logical explanation. Coyotes are opportunistic hunters that often prey on small animals, including small house pets. Winnie had seen the coyote and it had seen her. Surely, with the snow we’ve had for a solid week, prey is scarce. You won’t get my dog, fucker. 

I fall back into my comfortable pattern of drawing until my fingers go numb-thanks carpel tunnel syndrome-long into the night. Around two am, I call it, my eyes growing weary and exhausted. My phone buzzes on the coffee table. I answer.

“Hey Mel.” 

“Andre. Hi, how’s work?” My voice wavers slightly. That unease I felt before, I couldn’t shake, even now. 

“What’s wrong Mel? You sound sad.” 

“I’m not sad I’m just…scared I guess.” I answer, biting away at my cuticles, phone pressed to my ear propped up by my shoulder. “Hold on, let me put you on speaker.” I tell him. 

“Why are you scared, love?” His voice reassures me. Just his comforting tone alone is enough to make me shake off the anxiety. 

“I saw this coyote in the backyard. Well, Winnie saw it first.” I divulge. 

“Did she give it hell?” 

“You know she did. She didn’t scare it off, though. Her sausage body isn’t very intimidating.” I say, chuckling. I feel like I can breathe easier. “Just, being home alone for the weekend has me a little spooked, I guess.” 

“It’s okay. I’m here.” Andre reassures me. “And right when I clock out I’ll drive over and stay with you so you won’t be alone okay?” 

“Okay.” 

“I’m off at 4.” 

“I hate that they have you on graveyard shift now.”

“I know babe, but I need the money. I gotta go now or my boss will be on my ass. Just hang tight okay? Only a few more hours. I love you.” 

“I love you.” The line beeps and I set down my phone, wrapped in Andre’s hoodie, my restless mind at bay. 

The coyote is closer. 

I don’t know when it moved but it did. It’s only a few paces from the concrete slab outside the glass door, staring at me with wide, wet eyes, orange beady pearls that seem to slice through my gut. I’d only stepped into the kitchen to flick the house lights off…

I blink and it’s closer, right up against the glass. Its breath fogs up the window. For a moment, it does nothing, just silently huffs misty exhales. I watch the coyote, it watches me. I stare in abject horror as it leans its head back then bangs its forehead against the glass. Then again. And again. And again. The glass door now bloodied, I dart upstairs, slamming my room door shut behind me and sliding down the wood. My chest heaves, my paled skin breaking out in a cold sweat. What the fuck was that? My heart hammers in my chest with a ferocity so intense, it threatens to leap out. 

“Melly? Can I sleep in your room?” A voice softly begs behind my door. Lyla? It can’t be…she’s in Gatlinburg. I glance down at the hallway light leaking through the gap in between the door and the carpet. Sure enough, I see Lyla’s feet there, her penguin pajama pants at her ankles. I don’t have time to question it. There are times I could’ve been kinder to her, despite the fog in my head. I should say yes to sister sleepovers more often. I shouldn’t sleep the day away after she gets home from school. I should play with her in the snow more. She’s had nightmares before, calling out my name, screaming for me or my mom to help her. I don’t know when her and my mom got home, or why my mom never called to tell me, but that doesn’t matter right now. I open the door, ready to receive my sister with open arms and comfort her…but there’s nothing. She’s not there. 

“What-Lyla?” I pant, my voice rattling in my throat as I call out her name. Then my voice echoes back to me from the gap where the stairs are. 

“What-Lyla?” 

Fight, flight, or freeze is a funny thing. Before I know it, I’m tugging on a thick carhartt jacket over Andre’s hoodie, stepping into boots in my pajama pants and flying down the stairs. 

“Melly. I’m scared.” I hear her voice but I can’t see her. The glass door is open, just wide enough for a nine year old to slip out. The blood, it’s gone. The coyote, it’s gone. 

“Melly!! Melly help!!” Her voice is beckoning me from outside. I run through the back door, slamming it shut in my wake, enough to rattle the glass panes. I hear barking as I run, wild yelping and screeching. I follow Lyla’s voice, her wails, with each crunching step of my boots against snow. I have to find her, I will find her. I find purpose in this, at least. I’ll save my sister and I’ll be her protector, like my dad was to me. But I’ll never leave her side, not like him. 

I run until I’m at the edge of the forest. There’s no noise here. No chirping, no chittering, no barking, no Lyla.

Then, the forest explodes in a chorus of wails so loud I have to cover my ears, buckling to my knees in the snow. Harsh screeching and yelping all amalgamating into a violent, deafening melody. It slowly dies down and I hear a baby crying. An infant’s colicky cry. Then, a voice like a whisper begins pinging to my right ear, then my left. 

“Run.”

“Run.” 

“Run!” 

It’s odd, it propels me forwards, shaking off the snow clinging to my knees as I stand, how it sounds like my dad cheering me on at a cross country meet the day I hit my pr. I’d almost forgotten his voice. A sickly sweet scent fills my nostrils, causing me to gag.

“Melly!!!” Another scream. “Melly help!!!” I press on, deeper into the dense tree-line, thick snow crunching beneath my boots. “Lyla?! Where are you?!” I call out in sheer desperation, eyes darting between the dark trees, fervently searching for my sister. All is quiet, save for a single wail, this time it sounds like the call of a loon. Awoo-ooo… 

I nearly crumble to my knees but I press on, tears gliding down my cheeks and my neck with no abandon.

“It’s okay. I’m here.” His voice is soft and comforting, yet utterly monotone, no inflictions, nothing. I stop dead in my tracks. No, no, it’s not possible. Andre is at work, he is at work and I know this because he called me on his break. 

“Andre?” My head is on a swivel, but I’m utterly alone in the dense woods. 

“I’m here.” His voice calls from the left. I take a step towards it as fog rolls in, clouding the space. The moon in its grace, gives me a little light. About twelve feet away, I see a silhouette poking out from behind a tree, the outline of a man. A sigh of relief escapes me.  Andre. “I’m here,come here.” As I get closer, my eyes are pouring tears, the cold bites, threatening to freeze them against my cheeks. 

“Andre! You have to help me! Something took Lyla I-“ 
My mind is a muddled mess but I stop, as something primal and intrinsically prey-like in me, sends a flash of warning through my senses. His hand curls around the bark of the tree with long, gangly fingers. Half of his head pokes out from behind the tree. I can’t make out his face, just the outline, but he’s tall…too tall…and his arm that reaches across the bark and strokes the tree downward is bone thin. I back up a step. 

“I’m here Mel.” His voice calls out to me, not originating from the thing in front of me, but behind me. I swivel and nothing’s there. When I turn, whatever that thing is has vanished. The forest goes silent and all I can hear is the beating of my own, frantic heart. 

That’s when I hear it, another loon call. Awoo-ooo. 

“Melly!!” 

“Lyla!!!” 

“Lyla where are you-“ Long tendril fingers clasp over my mouth. I catch a glimpse of something fleshy and crimson with sagging tendons, veins, and red, bloodied skin pulled tightly to bone. Towering and utterly human in shape, but…inside out. 

Strange. There’s a gash in me and it’s pulling, pulling, pulling at something it shouldn’t. Oh…my intestines. I fall flat, a vhs tape in fallen snow, spilling its film in a tangled mess. 

Awooo-oooo… 

I smell the rot, the thick stench of my own gore. If I could just get home to Lyla I could’ve been more for her. Could she smell the rot all these years, my hollowed out shell? There is nothing left of me to love. Liar, liar, liar, I couldn’t crawl home even if I wanted to. My guts are spilled and splayed out of the cavernous tear in my stomach. I draw short breaths. I’m afraid. I’m sorry mom. I’m sorry Andre. I’m so sorry Lyla. If I hadn’t bowed my head to this illness my whole life, I could have been a better big sister…I could have been…I learn…I learn to die as I bleed out in the snow.
