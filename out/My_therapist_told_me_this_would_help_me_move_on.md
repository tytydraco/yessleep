I don't know how else to start this, except, to be honest, my therapist asked me to do this as an assignment. It's hell getting a good therapist in the first place these days, and it's expensive, so I'm gonna get my money's worth as best I can and do this.

I think it was about two weeks before Halloween. Sorry, I guess I should give you all some background first. I live out in a rural backwoods town. I don't just mean off the highway in a backwoods town; I mean, I live a few miles into the woods. I got the house after my grandfather died. When I asked for it, everyone was thrilled that they didn't have to try selling a place that could have been a horror movie set. It's actually a pretty nice house, and it would have sold for a decent price, if you could have sold it at all, so it was agreed that I would pay some rent to my dad and aunt for a few years before I officially owned it, then I got two other roommates, and at that point the rent was practically nothing. I work in the post office and within viewing distance of my house is a lake.

Anyway, it was about two weeks before Halloween last year. I was working late at the post office that night. The day had been mostly normal. I just worked in the back, processing the endless packages. There were the normal ones, ones that rattled ominously when you moved them, small ones that were heavier than they should have been, and ones with glass in them that you had to be real careful with. Just a regular day really. But, near the end of my shift, a package came in that smelled. I don't mean it had a residual house smell or something reasonable like that; it stunk. Something in it was rotting. When we get packages like that, much to our dismay, we have to check them, and by we, I mean always me. I put on some gloves and a face mask, and I opened it up. I tell you what, man, those seconds when the boxcutter is gliding across the tape are tense. We all hear the horror stories of dead animals or feces or literal bioweapons being unboxed. It could have been anything. I pushed through and opened the box.

At first, I really thought it was a pile of feces, but upon further inspection, I realized it was a rotten chocolate cake. I picked up a card beside it.

"To Mike, I know this is your favorite, so I thought I'd send you one. Your grandfather-" 

The note trailed off into incoherent thoughts and requests for Mike to call, and it ended with:

"Grandma loves you!"

I sighed. It was just a poor old woman who didn't understand she couldn't mail a cake across the country, but still, I had to dispose of it properly, file the paperwork, and mail the card. It took about an extra hour before I could clock out and go home.

I said goodbye to all my favorite coworkers and headed out. The drive home in my cold car was nice. I took the highway until my turn-off came. Then, I took 20 different turns on the backroads until I was home. I walked in, and my first roommate, Nasco, and his girlfriend were there, as usual. They were eating some brownies they'd baked while they were watching some anime. I lingered for a moment, waiting for them to offer me a brownie, but they just ignored me.

I went upstairs to my room, threw my clothes off, and flopped into my chair. I booted up my PC and ran some games with my online friends for a couple of hours while I ate whatever bag of chips was beside my desk that night. They were a little pissed I had to get on later, and therefore we had to stay up longer to get our regular two hours in, but we had fun. It was a good day. I worked out in the morning, I went to work, and I socialized. That's all I really wanted out of the day. I was throwing my clothes off to slip into bed when a light illuminated my room from my window. It was clearly a car; it shone in a straight line and moved quickly across my ceiling before disappearing. But it was at an angle that it couldn't have been someone pulling into our yard; that window was facing the lake. 

The lake beside our house wasn't really widely known, and honestly, I should just call it a large pond. It's a fishing spot or swimming hole for the few who know about it and can bother to come out this far into the woods to see it, so it was not out of the realm of reason for someone to be down there, but this was 11pm on a cold fall night. I climbed up onto my bed to look out my window. I saw two balls of light that looked like they were coming from a van, I could tell there were some guys down there, and I could tell they were working on something. But I could barely even see all of this. Our house is mostly obscured by the trees. Come to think of it, those guys down there probably didn't even know our house was there. We were up a hill behind a bunch of trees. The moon was out, but you could still have not noticed it.

I got one of those feelings that told me that I should just go to bed and ignore whatever was happening down there, but my curiosity got the better of me. I thought that it'd be good to get some fresh air and take out the trash anyway. I grabbed my binoculars, threw on some sweatpants and a coat, and walked downstairs. The lights under my roommate's doors were off, and there was no one in the kitchen; I was the only one up, and that only made me more excited. It was almost like an adventure, and to a bored post office worker, that was just perfect. Looking back, I'm actually glad I was the only one up. That no one went out with me or anything. I guess it would have been nice to have someone else take up this burden, but I can't really want any of this to happen to someone else. 

When you walk out into the woods, normally, there is so much happening, so many little things, that the air is full of sounds, and nothing can quite stop moving. But that night, everything was silent and still. The only way I can describe it is that when a lot is happening around you, your attention is taken from you, and you don't notice the little things. Here, it was like the lack of action was giving me attention; it was heightening everything. It was crisp and cold outside; there was no wind, I couldn't hear any animals or bugs or anything, and the moon was full and bright. 

The whole scene made me pause on the doorstep for a second, but still, I made my way down the rickety wooden stairs and over to my trash can. As I was lowering the trash bag down into the can, I heard voices coming from across the bank of the lake. I slowly walked over to the tree line and raised the binoculars to my eyes.

I focused them in and saw that it actually was a van, and there were three men. I recognized them instantly. I went to high school with them, but now they looked terrible. They were clearly junkies these days. The eyes were sallow, the skin was pale and marked all over, and their clothes were ratty and loose. But what bothered me was the large black trash bag on the ground in front of them; it was moving. 

I tried to pull my phone out to call the police, but I just felt empty pockets. I didn't remember to bring my phone. I was about to turn around to go grab it when I saw one of them, a guy named Walton, or Walt, pull out a revolver. At that moment, I felt like it had already happened, and I was just watching it over again, but still, when he lowered the sights down to the bag and when the sound of the gun firing blew in all directions, I could barely stand it. 

I got myself farther behind the tree I was hiding behind to make sure they didn't see me. I had to remember to breathe. When I settled down enough to get my hands to stop shaking so much, I looked through the binoculars again. The bag was no longer moving, and Walt and the other two guys, Martin and John, were just looking at it. But finally, Walt snapped out of it and smacked the other guys back to reality. They all picked up the bag, waddled it over to the bank, and threw it in. I guess it had some other weight inside of it. It sank immediately. Then they shuffled back to their van quickly and peeled out of there. 

After I finally got myself to lower the binoculars, I realized I was still shaking. I think I've watched over a hundred horror movies and blown heads off a million enemies in video games, and I think that would have given me some buffer against seeing stuff like this in real life. Maybe it did, but I was still freaked out, and I could only just get myself to turn around and go back up to the house. Halfway across the yard, I realized the sounds of the night were slowly returning, and my mind started working again. I suddenly became scared that I'd see the van try and pull up into my yard while I was out in the open. I ran up the groaning stairs and fumbled with the door before I slammed it shut and locked myself inside. I looked out the windows, still shaking for something like fifteen minutes. Nothing ever came. I've thought about it a lot, and I really do think they didn't know my house was there at that point. They really thought they'd picked a perfect place to throw a body and have no one find it.

I got back to my room, and along the way, I was a little surprised to see that I was still the only one awake. But after I thought about it, even with a revolver firing off on a quiet night, it was something like 300 yards away, down a hill, while they were asleep with all the windows closed. They probably didn't even stir in bed when it happened. When I closed the door, I immediately picked up my phone. I was about to dial 911 when I had a sudden thought. I couldn't just make this an anonymous tip; if I called this in, they would bring me in for a statement. They'd be able to match the tracks to Walt's van, but they'd almost certainly want me to testify in court against them. I thought I could've even ended up as a suspect. I lowered the phone and sat down on the end of my bed. 

I felt terrible, but by the end of thirty minutes, I decided I was just going to let it go. I know it would have been better for the family, but I didn't want to get involved, and she was already dead. Things were actually going well for me at that time. It was a selfish decision, but I just made sure my door was locked, promised myself I'd buy a gun this week, and went to bed.

I tried to anyway; it's not like you can just sleep after that. But during the night, something strange happened. The lights started glowing. I don't mean they came on fully; I mean they just sort of halfway came on before going dark again. My ceiling lights did this, then my closet light, and finally, even my computer screen. But everything was off, none of the switches were moved, and my computer never actually came on.

This went on for about an hour before, finally, every light source in my room started to glow just slightly. When it was each bulb individually, they were brighter, but when it was all of them, you could barely even tell there was a difference between them being on or off. Then everything flickered, and it stopped. I didn't know what to make of it. I'd just watched someone be murdered, and now my lights were coming on of their own accord. I spent another hour frozen in bed before I finally passed out of exhaustion.

I don't normally have dreams, but that night, I had a very odd dream; it wasn't scary or anything yet. It was just a bright white background with a dark figure that looked just slightly humanoid, but I must've only had the dream at the end of my sleep. My alarm blared through and woke me up just a few moments after the figure came into view. That's all that really happened, and though it was memorable, I didn't think anything of it. I had other things on my mind, and I was pretty happy I didn't have a nightmare about anything that happened last night.

After I turned my alarm off, I just sat up in bed for a while. I looked over at my phone and really thought hard about my decision. Finally, I decided that the police could probably trace anonymous calls, and if I did manage to leave a completely anonymous tip like a letter or something, they'd just look up the hill and see my house, and I'd be brought in for questioning anyway. I'd end up as a suspect, and so would my roommates, and they would probably need my testimony to affirm that Martin and John were there alongside Walt. There was no way to report this without getting involved, and I still just didn't want that. Much in the same way you ignore a homeless man or ignore requests for charity funds, I just started moving on.

I didn't go to work out that morning. Naturally, I just wasn't in the mood, but overall, I just had the same sort of day. I got up, made some breakfast, and just watched TV before work. I wanted to go out and look at the lake, just to see the same spot from last night, but I forced myself not to. Finally, I left the house and got over to my car, all while pushing myself not to even look in the lake's direction.

Work was the same, really. Someone asked me why I was so quiet that day, but I just brushed them off and kept working. No rotten packages came, just more of the usual ones. The whole shift was more of a haze. Honestly, it's been so long, and it just wasn't important in the context of everything else; I guess something wild could have happened that workday, and I just can't remember it. 

I made the drive home and picked up some fast food from a Mega Meaties on the way. I made all the backwoods turns and parked my car on the lawn like normal. But when I got out and started walking towards the door, not facing the lake, I noticed the leaves in the corner of the yard rustling. It was in the opposite direction of the wind, and when I looked, I couldn't see a squirrel or anything that had caused it. Then the leaves kept rustling, but they were coming closer. The way they moved to the side seemed like the way leaves would move if someone were running across the yard. It all happened so fast I didn't know what to do. Whatever force was moving the leaves collided with me, but I couldn't feel it physically. I felt 10 degrees colder in a second, and I went deaf for a moment before everything went back to normal, aside from a slight ringing in my ear. 

I think that seeing the murder and the lights flashing the night before was extremely alarming, but I still didn't really feel like I was in any danger. The murder hadn't involved me, and the lights could've been an electricity issue. But after the leaves in the yard, I was seriously scared that something was happening. Still, there didn't seem to be much more that I could do. I just looked around to make sure it wasn't going to happen again, and I made my way back up inside. My roommate and his girlfriend were on the couch, and my other roommate, Pac, was making ramen in the kitchen. I just yelled out my regular:

"Heyo!"

To everyone and ran up the stairs to my room. As soon as I entered the room, I realized it was colder there. It wasn't quite the whole 10-degree colder feeling I'd gotten earlier, but still, it was noticeably colder in my room than it should have been. I don't have an extra fan or anything like that. 

It didn't really take much thought. Weird stuff was happening, and I didn't want to be alone. As weird as it looked to my roommates after I had just blown by them and ran upstairs, I came back down the steps and ate my fast food downstairs. I remember that they seemed to tell that something was wrong with me, but I just blew off their questions and watched whatever anime they had on from the dinner table while I ate. 

While I was just starting to eat, though, one of the lights that was off started glowing, like they had last night. I quickly looked at everyone else in the room. They didn't say anything. I even asked them if they could notice it. They just gave me another concerned look and told me no. I've never brought it up with them since everything happened, and Pac doesn't live here anymore, so I can't ask him. I guess they never saw anything I saw. The fact that I was the only one who could see what was happening definitely freaked me out more, but even still, I was glad I wasn't the only one there.

But finally, they all left me alone. Pac finished making his ramen and went up to his room. Nasco's girlfriend went to the bedroom, I think she was annoyed at me for interrupting their TV time, even though it was my house, and Nasco had to follow her. I don't remember exactly what he said while he was leaving, but it was pretty close to this.

"Alright, well, I think we're going to stay in the bedroom for the rest of the night. That's cool, right?"

"Oh um, yeah man that's all good."

He picked up on my nervous tone. 

"I can, uh, leave this TV on if you want?"

"Yeah, that sounds good, man. Thanks."

He nodded at me, still looking a bit concerned, and left me there. Alone.

It all happened pretty soon after Nasco left. I was finishing my fries when the lights started again. This time, it was all of them. First, the ones that were off started glowing, but quickly, they became as bright as the lights that were already on, and then they all started glowing even brighter than what was possible for them. I thought they would all burst, but they just kept getting brighter and brighter. The TV started flickering, and I realized I was slowly getting more and more deaf again, like outside. The TV was flickering back and forth between the anime it was on originally and an image. Finally, the flickering stopped on the image. It was me. It was me sitting at the table at that exact moment, looking at the TV as if someone were taking video from the middle of the living room. The lights became almost blinding, and I had gone completely deaf. I got up out of my chair to try to run outside, but it was so bright I couldn't see where I was going, and I fell over one of the other chairs. The lights finally did become blinding, and I just clasped my hands over my eyes, waiting for it all to be over.

But, slowly, I started to hear again, and the lights were starting to die down. I didn't hear the same sounds as before, though. It sounded like wind, strong, powerful wind, and when the lights got to the point where I could open my eyes again, I realized everything around me had changed. The floors were worn before, but now they looked a thousand years older. When I looked up from the floor, I saw that everything was dilapidated, if it was even there at all. The kitchen was almost empty, save for the stove. But I don't remember really how bad the rest of the house looked because the next place I turned my head to was the living room. There, standing up in the middle of it, was a black trash bag. I shoved myself back up and ran for the door. 

When I swung it open, I just stared out in horror. The landscape had changed from the deep southern woods at night to a barren and desolate wasteland where nothing grew. It was just hills and mountains of dirt. The moon and the sun were both out, and they were both red. Roaming all over this landscape were skeletons, burning skeletons that walked upright, and as soon as I opened the door, they all turned toward me. The air was no longer just filled with the wind; it was now filled with their otherworldly screams as they all ran towards my door. I shut it quickly and turned back towards the trash bag in my living room. I knew it was the one from last night. It was shaking, and it had turned to face me. It was terrifying, but I chose it over whatever was happening outside.

"I'm sorry!"

I cried out. The bag started shaking even more, and finally, I heard a strained voice cry out in reply.

"HELP ME!!!"

As soon as the plea ended, everything suddenly went back to normal.

I was deaf again for a moment, but the sound of the TV came back through soon after. The house was no longer dilapidated, and when I looked out the living room window, I didn't see any wasteland; I just saw the trees in the moonlight. I didn't move for a while, but finally, I turned around and tried cracking the door open. No wasteland, just more woods.

I remember being in a state of shock over everything that had happened. I didn't want to walk into the living room; that's where the bag had been. I didn't want to go upstairs into my room; the lights had been flickering there the previous night. I didn't want to go outside; it looked fine out there, but I couldn't be sure of anything at that point. I just went into the kitchen and stood myself up against the stove. 

My therapist told me this was all hallucinations from extreme stress and guilt. I just agree with her. It's all so impossible that her explanation has to be correct, but it was all so vivid and real when it happened. Anyway, I'm getting tired. I can tell I already feel better having written this all out, and I want to thank all of you for reading this, but unfortunately, I'm not done. I'll have to post a part two, maybe a part three, but for now, goodbye.
