Please don’t let his name confuse you, he isn’t a good in any means.

Some people confuse him as the hat man since he looks the same, but I can very much assure you that he is NOT the same. 
The hat man is often seen as a neutral spirit, sometimes protective and warning people of danger. But the Warding Man? You are in danger if you see him.

There’s very little information about him, but this is all that I know.

1. He is very tall and always wears a hat with long brims.

2. He will only come inside if you let him in. DO NOT LET HIM IN. It’s too late for you if you do.

3. If he begins to target you….pray that he goes away and keep salt in your pocket in an emergency. He doesn’t like salt, but it won’t rid him entirely, he will still fight back.

4. He starts at night or at dusk. Sometimes he has a flashlight apparently and can be mistaken as a sadistic human. He’ll stand outside your window, and shine the flashlight inside, looking for just a glimpse of you. Even if it’s as small as your shadow, he’ll pursue it he sees you. 
Please, for your safety, DO NOT LOOK OUTSIDE. No matter how tempting it is to see him, do not be seen by the light. Close the curtains, lay in your floor and don’t move and pray he leaves quickly. He may be there for a while, he is smart.

5. If he decides to continue pursuing, you’re in for an awful time. 
He’ll begin standing just outside your window or your doors whether the front door, side door, or back door clear as day. I beg you once again to not look at him. Don’t look behind you or even share a passing glance at him. He is not there. I repeat he IS NOT THERE. If you look at him, he becomes more determined and he WILL find a way inside. Wear a blindfold or board up the windows and doors if you have to.

6. He will try knocking to get you to let him inside. He will knock twice. A little weird, but he knocks on the doors or windows twice, I’m not sure why. Either way, do not open the windows or doors. Not even ti let in fresh air. If you have any pets, you can’t let them out either. He’ll come inside. You can’t outsmart him.

7. If you haven’t let him in yet, that’s great, but it’s not over. 
He’ll cause you to hallucinate. If you live with other people, you’ll see them enter rooms but the coke out of a completely different room and they’ll have no recollection of doing so. You’ll try walking out of a room but then suddenly be back in the room you just left as if you never walked out in the first place.
You’ll see shadows similar to him in the corner of your eye or flashes of shadows in front of you. You’ll hear scratches and growls, clattering, walking, dark humming or breathing. You’ll think he’s inside. Anything to cause you to open the window or door.
Remember, he isn’t inside unless you opened a door or window. He makes you feel like your going insane so you can let him in.

8. if you fell for it and opened the door to leave, I’m sorry. You can’t escape him no matter how far you run. You’re his now. He will make go you insane. You’ll never know what’s reality or what’s a hallucination anymore. You’ll be convinced so harshly that people may not be real that you’ll start taking drastic measures as far a killing. If he gets close to you, you can throw salt at him to deter him for just a few hours, but it will never get rid of him. It will just prolong your inevitable fate. He’s in your head and no one will believe you. He’ll wait and play with you until he  kills you or if you just do the job for him, but don’t expect to go to heaven. Your soul is his, there is no saving bo matter the God you worship or the prayer you pray. You lost.

9. You’ll know you passed it you survived without opening the door or window for 2 days. TWO DAYS. I’m not sure what his connection is with the number 2, but that’s just how it works with him. You’ll know it’s over when you feel oddly peaceful, there’s no more knocking and of course, no more hallucinations. The safest option is to wait until 6am on the THIRD day just to be safe.

Please be cautious, beware of the Warding Man.

Thank you for listening, but I have to go. Someone keeps knocking at my door, I think it’s the mailman or something.
