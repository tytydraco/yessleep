***TAPE BEGINS: 07/12/97 – 11:43 PM***

*(The recording starts with a shaky video feed. The camera is handheld, the viewfinder flickering. The person behind the camera—later identified as Daniel Mercer—speaks in a low, slightly nervous tone.)*

"Alright. Uh… I’m about twenty miles off Route 16, just outside Ashwood Forest. Set up camp maybe an hour ago. It’s just me out here. No service, no radio. Just… quiet."

*(He pans the camera, showing the campsite. A small tent, a fire pit, the surrounding trees. The darkness beyond the fire’s glow is deep, unnatural. The trees almost seem too close together.)*

"It’s weird. The forest is too quiet. No birds, no wind. Just my breathing and this damn camera."

*(He turns the camera back to himself, forcing a smile.)*

"I came here to get away for a while. Just me and nature. So far, it’s… fine. I guess."

*(Static interrupts the feed for a second. A brief, flickering distortion. When the video returns, Mercer is sitting by the fire, staring past the camera.)*

"I swear I saw something move out there."





***TAPE: 07/13/97 – 2:18 AM***

(The video is now handheld, shaky. The fire has burned down to embers. Mercer whispers into the camera.)

"I woke up because I felt something… watching me. Thought it was an animal at first. But then I saw the light."

*(He turns the camera toward the trees. There, in the distance, a faint glow pulses behind the thin fabric of a tent. A second tent. But Mercer is alone.)*

"That wasn’t there before."

*(The camera zooms in. The light flickers. A shadow moves behind the fabric.)*

"Someone’s in there."

*(He swallows hard. The sound of his breathing is sharp, uneven. He grips the camera tighter.)*

"I—I should call out, right? Ask who they are? But… I can’t."

*(A long pause. Then, barely above a whisper:)*

"I don’t think they want me to know they’re here."

*(The camera shakes as he pulls the tent’s zipper up, enclosing himself inside. The feed cuts to static.)*





***TAPE: 07/13/97 – 7:42 AM***

*(The recording resumes with Mercer stepping outside. The second tent is gone. No sign it was ever there.)*

*(His voice is strained, panicked.)*

"Okay. Alright. Maybe I was dreaming. Maybe it was a trick of the light. But… I don’t think so."

*(He pans the camera over the ground where the tent had been. No footprints. No disturbed dirt. Nothing.)*

"I’m leaving. Packing up and getting the hell out of here. This place is wrong."

*(As he turns the camera back toward his own tent, a distortion flickers across the screen. A shape. Human-like. Watching from the tree line. But Mercer doesn’t seem to notice.)*





***TAPE: 07/13/97 – 9:57 AM***

*(The camera is now mounted on Mercer’s dashboard. The road stretches ahead, empty.)*

"I don’t remember falling asleep last night. I don’t remember dreaming. But I woke up feeling… different. Like something crawled into my head and stayed there."

*(He grips the wheel, knuckles white.)*

"The car won’t start. I don’t know why. Battery’s fine. Gas tank’s full. It just—"

*(The audio distorts. A whispering sound bleeds through the speakers.)*

"What the hell was that?"

*(Mercer turns the camera to the rearview mirror. In the reflection, past the back windshield—standing in the road, half-hidden by the trees—is a figure. Motionless. Staring.)*

*(He spins in his seat. The road is empty.)*

*(The whispering grows louder.)*

*(The tape cuts to static.)*





***TAPE: 07/14/97 – 12:06 AM***

*(The camera feed is unstable. Mercer is back at the campsite, his face pale, eyes sunken. His voice is hollow.)*

"I walked for miles. Should’ve found the main road. Should’ve seen another car. But the forest just… kept going."

*(He laughs, short and humorless.)*

"I came back here because I had to. There’s nowhere else to go."

*(The camera flickers. In the background, behind Mercer, the second tent is back. The light inside pulses, slow and rhythmic, like breathing.)*

"I don’t want to look. I can’t look. But I can feel it watching me."

*(A long pause. Then:)*

"I think it’s waiting for me to open it."

*(The tape cuts to black.)*





***TAPE: 07/14/97 – 3:33 AM***

*(The video is shaky. Mercer is standing in front of the second tent. His breath is ragged.)*

"I have to know."

*(His hands tremble as he reaches for the zipper. The whispering rises. The air distorts around him. The moment he unzips the tent—)*

*(The feed is overwhelmed by static. Screeching audio. A burst of flickering images: Mercer’s face twisted in horror. The trees bending at impossible angles. A figure stepping out of the tent—tall, wrong, its face a smear of shifting darkness. The whispering becomes a roar. The video tears.)*

*(Then, silence.)*





***LAST RECORDED ENTRY: UNKNOWN TIME***

*(The final recording is in complete darkness. Heavy breathing. Mercer’s voice is barely a whisper.)*

"I can’t move. I don’t know where I am. Everything is wrong."

*(A long pause. Then, with absolute certainty:)*

"I was never supposed to leave."

*(A sharp inhale. The whispering returns, deafening. The tape abruptly ends.)*
