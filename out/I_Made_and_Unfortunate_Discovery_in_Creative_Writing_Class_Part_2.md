My next battery of tests was mostly focused on the physical. Could I change her appearance? Could I give her proficiency in a physical skill I wasn’t good at? And more importantly, could I erase traits that previously existed?

​

“Allison has blue hair, she’s good at juggling because she thought it looked fun as a child and practised a lot”

​

I erased the line about her greeting as well.

​

The next day, when I arrived at my spot, Allison was already there. Her hair was blue, and it was uneven, like she had hastily dyed it. I guess I couldn’t change too much.

​

I sat down next to her, unsure of what to say. I wasn’t used to being the one who approached others.

​

“Hey, what are you doing?”I asked.

​

“Homework, what’s up, Jeff?”

​

“Nothing much. I was just wondering why your hair is blue.”

​

“Ah, that. I lost a bet with a friend.”

​

“At least it’s not permanent,” I replied.

​

I had a question I wanted to ask her, but it seemed awkward to ask now. I read my notes this morning and found that something was off with what I remembered.

​

“When did we first meet?” I asked. I had mentioned in my notes that I had a memory of Allison being my childhood friend, but when I thought about it, I couldn’t remember such a thing. I knew it happened, I had written it down, but no matter how hard I grasped for the memory, I couldn’t seem to find it.

​

“I dunno, like the day before yesterday? Sorry, Jeff, can you hold off on the questions for a bit? I have to finish this project.” Allison didn’t look at me, instead focusing on her computer.

​

I assented and started on my own work. Half thinking about biology and half about how I was able to erase changes I made, not just make them.

​

We sat in silence for an hour before Allison stretched her arms and declared she had finished her report.

​

“So, Mr Question Asker, I am ready to be asked questions.”

​

I felt a twinge of embarrassment. I supposed that I did seem to only ask Allison questions, but this was the first time she had voiced any sort of annoyance at it.

​

“Oh, I heard from one of your friends that you can juggle pretty well. Can you show me?”

​

Allison seemed to perk up at this question,” Can I ever. Nobody has asked me to juggle in ages. Here, give me some mechanical pencils.”

​

I handed her my pencils and watched in amazement as she juggled what seemed to be an impossible number of mechanical pencils.

​

Allison stopped juggling before saying,” Impressive, right? I got really into it as a kid. Kind of a useless skill though. Any more questions?”

​

“Give me a moment,”I replied as I pulled up Allison’s sheet and wrote “Allison is four feet tall” and then asked,” Actually, how tall are you?”

​

“Fiv- four foot even,”she answered.

​

“Really? You look like you’re more like five four.”

​

“No, look, see, I’m only four feet tall,” Allison got out of her chair and stood up.

​

She wasn’t standing correctly, her back was hunched, and her knees were slightly bent, so she appeared shorter than she actually was.

“Stand up straight, you’re all hunched over,” I remarked.

​

“What do you mean? This is how I always stand,” she seemed genuinely convinced that she was standing perfectly normally.

​

I got up out of my own seat and tried pulling her shoulders up.

​

She screamed, and screamed and screamed. I immediately took my hands off of her, but she wouldn’t stop. She just kept screaming and screaming. People walking glared at me, a few even stopped to see if she was all right. She couldn’t answer them; she just kept screaming.

​

Eventually, she crumpled to the ground, curled herself into a ball and started loudly sobbing. I crouched down next to her, trying to get her to calm down, but she wouldn’t listen. There was a ring of people around us now, and I could feel their gazes burning into me. It took everything I had not to break through them and run away. I got Allison to take my hand, and she stood up in that same hunched-over manner. The crowd of people dispersed.

​

I led Allison back to her seat and waited for her to calm down. She was babbling about how she couldn’t break it. When it seemed like she wouldn’t calm down, I erased the note about her height from the sheet, and she seemed to visibly relax.

​

“Sorry about that, Jeff. I had this really bad feeling come over me.” Allison was looking directly ahead; she seemed incredibly spaced out.

​

“It’s fine. I have to leave now. See you tomorrow,” I put my things in my backpack. Wondering if I should pry into whatever “break it” meant, but I decided against it. I didn’t want those eyes on me again.

​

Before I could leave, Allison grabbed my arm. I looked at her, and she said,” Please don’t try to make me break the rules again.” She looked like she was about to burst into tears again. I mutely nodded at her and headed back to my dorm.

​

Whatever this power was, it could mess with your brain, but it couldn’t change physical reality. That’s what I gleaned from Allison’s statement, but I still had some lingering doubts. The ways it messed with reality seemed too different to me.

​

Then an idea struck me: what if the two methods weren’t so different? What if it had forced a memory into Allison’s head about some past that required her to stand like that? Memories couldn’t be destroyed or created instantly; maybe in that last moment before the memory was fully wiped, she managed to get out some final plea. I thought about trying it on myself, but ultimately couldn’t go through with it.

​

The next week, I avoided Allison like the plague. Every time I thought of her, I could feel the gazes of the passersby when they saw me holding her as she screamed.

​

“What the fuck is wrong with you?”

​

“What did you do to her?”

​

“You don’t even look worried, what a piece of shit”

​

They didn’t say these words aloud, but I could hear them echoing through my head. I was used to being looked at poorly; it didn’t bother me. But to be looked at as if I was actively doing something bad, to be condemned by my peers as a villain, I hadn’t experienced it before, and it was eating away at me.

​

I couldn’t take it anymore. I deleted the character sheet of Allison and decided that I would just go back to my old way of writing. I still avoided the spot she used to frequent, but curiosity got the better of me one day. I went to the old spot, but she wasn’t there. I felt a bit uneasy but decided that it was fine. I went back the next day, and she still wasn’t there.

​

With a foreboding feeling, I opened up Allison’s Instagram. She hadn’t posted in weeks. I checked all of her pages, and all were the same. I opened her following list and found her sister. I hoped she would accept my statement that I was just Allison’s friend without a second thought, and as I hoped this, I sent her a message.

​

“Hey, I’m a friend of Emily’s, and she hasn’t been around for a while. Is she okay?”

​

I waited the rest of the day hoping for an answer. Eventually, I got one; it was a screenshot of a Facebook post from Emily’s mom.

​

“I really didn’t want to make this post, but I don’t think we will be able to afford the medical bills without your support. Emily is my daughter, and she is a bright, intelligent girl who loves birds and soccer. Last week, Emily had some sort of accident while she was away at college and lost everything. She cannot walk, she cannot eat, she cannot talk. Emily spends all day lying down, staring up at the ceiling. The doctors are unsure why she is like this, and her prognosis is poor. My family is unable to take care of her as she cannot do anything by herself anymore, so we have placed her in a home.” The message continued, but I stopped reading.

​

I could feel the staring even harder than ever. No one was around, but I could still feel it. Why hadn’t she gone back to being Emily? What did I do? I didn’t do anything wrong. Stop looking at me like that. Maybe I fucked around a bit, but I never hurt her, I never meant to hurt her. I wasn’t the problem; they were the problem. They accused me without knowing anything.

​

For the first time, I wished Jason were here. He wouldn’t look at me like that. He wouldn’t blame me even a little bit. Jason, with his never-ending kindness, would forgive me. For the first time, I didn’t feel disgusted or annoyed when thinking about receiving his grace.

​

An idea wormed its way into my head. I tried to ignore it; I had gotten into this situation by using this strange power granted to me. The solution was not to use it on an even greater scale than I had before.

​

“Wouldn’t this be the best for the greater good?” a voice asked me.

​

I knew somewhere within myself that the answer was no, but the more I thought about it, the more it seemed like the perfect solution. Aren’t the vast majority of people out there inferior to him? Isn’t that why I hated him, because he was too perfect? If everyone who stared at me that day became Jason, wouldn’t it be a net positive for the world? If they became him, wouldn’t I finally be free of this gaze that seems fixed to me at all times?

​

The answer to all of these questions was a firm yes.

​

I tried to remember the faces of those staring at me that day, but all I could see were their eyes. It didn’t matter; if I saw their faces, I would certainly remember if they were the ones.

​

I spent a long time aimlessly walking around campus. I saw so many of them, so so many. As I walked around, more people stared at me. Did they know something? Were they condemning me in their head? I added them to the list. It didn’t matter if they were there that day; they were wrong. They needed to be fixed.

​

I had been avoiding class for a while, and when I finally attended after an extended absence, they stared at me with that accusatory gaze. Even the professors were accusing me in their heads. Everyone in every single class was wrong.

​

By the time I finished finding them, my list was 258 people long. I took pictures so I could picture them in my head when I wrote, and I found their names. Every single one of them. I knew them all.

​

I didn’t want to mess this up. I wrote down all of their names on a separate piece of paper. Underneath that, I wrote the same thing two hundred and fifty-eight times, “is mentally Jason.”

​

I lost track of time; I could have been writing for hours or days for all I knew. My hand was cramped, but I had one last piece of paper. I wrote “Emily” at the top of the page and then wrote the same statement as the rest. I stumbled my way to my bed and fell asleep.

​

When I woke up that morning, I had a text. I hadn’t woken up to a text in quite some time. It was Jason, he was in town, and he wanted to meet up the next day. I accepted his invitation with no hesitation.

​

I walked around campus with a new sense of confidence. There were far fewer people than usual, and those who were there didn’t bother looking up from their phones. I sat in my normal spot; there was no sense of unease. I was free from the stares, thinking about Emily made me feel relieved. I had undone my mistake; she was not only okay, she was better now.



I didn’t get to sit down for very long before a throng of people surrounded me. I recognized them.

​

“Hey, Jeff, what’s up?”they all said in unison.

​

This sense of sudden unity sent a wave of confusion through the crowd. They all looked at the person next to them with the same confused look.

​

“Yo, why are you copying me?” they all said to the person they were looking at. All their faces shifted to one of annoyance mixed with fear at the same moment.

​

“Do I know you?” I asked. I shouldn’t know them; they should just have Jason’s personality.

​

“Aw, come on, I thought we had something. I can’t believe you forgot. Well, I guess that’s something you would do,” they all explained.

​

My head felt like it was splitting apart when they all spoke. Two hundred versions of the same memory flooded into my head.

​

One day, Victoria invited me over to her house. It was only remarkable because I was the only one there, and we had only hung out alone once or twice. I sat on the couch in Ethan’s stupidly perfect house and played some shooting game I was terrible at. Of course, Adrian was good enough that even with me dragging him down, he still easily carried us to victory.

​

“Hey, Jeff, I think I like you,” Saeyoung said while taking down an enemy sniper.

​

“Well, you insist on dragging me places, so I assumed so,” I responded. I was in the middle of a firefight and losing badly.

​

“No, I mean like, like like you know?”

​

“Oh,” I was taken out by a sniper I didn’t even know existed,”why?”

​

“Don’t like, get mad at me. You left your notebook in class one day, and I kind of read it. You’re really prickly, you give off this vibe that screams ‘don’t talk to me’ but I dunno something about your writing helped me understand you, I think.”

​

“I see. You know I hate you, right?”

​

“Yeah. I know. Still, you’re meaner to me than you are to anyone else; it’s actually kind of cute, you know. I guess I like that you think about me more than anyone else. I wish I were as good at English as you; you’d probably have no issue expressing what I’m trying to say.”

​

I finally found Alex’s flaw. It wasn’t that Emma was gay; it was that Isabel had fallen in love with someone like me.

​

A new match started, and Ethan asked,”So do you want to go out?”

​

Did I want to date the man I hated most? Not particularly. I didn’t feel too strongly one way or the other, actually. I had never really thought about being in a relationship. At some point, I just assumed it was something I would never get to experience. I didn’t really care that Charlotte was a guy; my own sexuality was something I had never paid much attention to.

​

There wasn’t much reason to reject Tony; Elijah would just keep being my friend like always. I could break David’s heart, a part of me wanted to, but really, Mia would bounce back from it perfectly like always. Accepting would be advantageous; the life experiences I was lacking would be bountiful, which would doubtlessly help my writing.

​

Weighing the pros and cons in my head, I said,” Sure.”

​

“I thought for sure you would say no.”

​

“Why even ask then?”

​

“Don’t know until you try.”

​

The two of us continued playing the game for some time before I asked,” So what does ‘going out’ entail exactly?”

​

“Just doing the same things as usual except, like, gayly I think.”

​

I inadvertently laughed at Theo’s attempt at a joke.

​

I lay my head down on the desk as two hundred memories flooded into my brain. I felt sad, like I was losing something precious to me. Why was I sad? I hated Ellie. Why was Travis even here? I had told Jake explicitly not to follow me to this school.

​

“Jake”, that name felt close to the reason I felt sad. I tried to force the new memories, continuing to flood into my head, out and focus on the name. Jake, Jake, it wasn’t right, but I couldn’t find the correct name.

​

I felt my phone buzz and picked it up. It was Jason confirming the time and location for tomorrow. Jason, Jason, why did that name sound so familiar? I couldn’t find the significance; whatever it was, it had been buried under the weight of the new memories.

​

I kept repeating that name, Jason, Jason, Jason to myself while I pushed myself through the crowd, who kept asking me if I was ok. I pulled out my phone and just kept writing the name in a blank note. When I got to my room, I lay down on my bed. I couldn’t stop thinking of that name; if I stopped, I would forget it. I muttered his name while I wrote down instructions for tomorrow. I needed to see him for some reason. I didn’t want to forget.

​

I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, thinking about the name. Who did it belong to? I said the name, but no face was brought to mind. I felt hatred and loss and a strange, warm feeling when I thought about the name. Jason, who are you?

​

I was woken from my half-asleep trance by the sound of hundreds of hands knocking. Some knocked on the door, some knocked on the wall; it produced a sound that made it feel like the world was about to end.

​

“Jeff, are you okay?” a cacophony of voices asked.

​

“Go away,” I shouted angrily. Why on Earth was Rose standing in front of my dorm?

​

“I’m just worried, you know,” they responded.

​

“GO AWAY,” I screamed. I didn’t want to deal with Cody right now; I wasn’t in the mood. My head hurt so much, screaming just made it worse.

​

“Ok, ok. Just text me if you need something,” they responded, and I heard a low rumble as they shuffled away.

​

What was I thinking about? It was important. I opened my phone and saw a name. Jason, was it important? I had written it down hundreds, if not thousands, of times. It must have been important, I wouldn’t have done that if it wasn’t. Jason, I thought of the name and felt a vague sense of importance. Did I know a Jason? It looked like I was planning on meeting a Jason tomorrow. I thought about the name for the rest of the night. Why did I write that name down so many times?

​

I woke up in the morning, and my head hurt. My head hurt and I was confused. Where was I? It took a second to remember I was in my college dorm. I opened my phone. I had instructions for myself. I was to go to a coffee shop not far from my dorm. To meet some guy.

​

I thought about ignoring it, but I had explicitly ordered myself to go no matter what I felt like. When did I write this? It must have been yesterday, thinking about yesterday made my head hurt more.

​

I got dressed and complied with my past instructions. I figured there must be some reason I wrote it down. I was early, so I sat down and slowly drank some water. I wished I had taken Tylenol; the light made my head hurt even more.

​

I could feel people in the shop staring at me. A familiar sense of unease crept over me. I hated this feeling; hadn’t I taken care of this?

​

This thought gave me pause. Did I do something? It had something to do with…Emily? That couldn’t be right, Emily was my ex-girlfriend, I hadn’t seen her in forever or wait, was it Jessica? Thinking about it made my head ache so much that tears formed in the corner of my eyes. I decided it was best to just think of nothing while I waited.

​

I was spaced out when someone sat in front of me. When I looked at his face, the haze of my memories cleared up slightly, and my headache eased a bit. Jason, it was him. I needed to ask him something; who knew how long this clarity of mind would last? I opened the camera on my phone and hit record before sticking it in my pocket. Maybe listening to his voice would help clear my head in the future.

​

“Jason, I need to hear your feedback on the story I am writing right now,” I started.

​

“Hey, Jeff. Straight to the point as always. I’m happy to listen, you usually don’t share these things before finishing,” he replied.

​

“So, I have this main character. And when she writes a character based on another person, that person changes their personality into that of the character.”

​

“Sounds like your type of story. What’s the reason you need my feedback?”

​

“Well, the thing is, she doesn’t realize it until she bases a character on her friend. When she realizes this, she has all these questions and tests them on her friend. Like, can she make the character have another person’s knowledge and such?” I continued.

​

“Interesting,” he commented.

​

“And then one time she tests something, and her friend very publicly has a breakdown, and all these people come and stare at them. She feels really disgusted when all these people stare at her like she did something wrong. She ends up deleting the character sheet she has for her friend, and her friend becomes essentially a vegetable. Like the friend can’t do anything by herself.”

​

“That’s sadder than what you usually write.”

​

“The thing is, the girl still feels like people think it’s her fault that happened. Everyone knows she did it, but they won’t say anything to her. They just stare. Then she has this thought that if her friend were here, she would understand that the girl had just made a huge mistake, and if the friend were here, she would forgive the friend. So the girl changes all the people who stare at her into her friend,” I finished my summary.

​

“So are you confused about where to go from here? It feels pretty complete now, but I’ve never been much of a writer.”

​

“I just want to know, what do you think of the girl’s actions? Would you forgive her?”

​

Jason pondered this question for a moment, eyebrows furrowing in concentration before rendering his verdict,” She’s pretty irredeemable. Like, I am assuming her friend doesn’t know she’s running these tests. I can maybe forgive the incident with erasing the character sheet; she didn’t know her friend would turn out like that. Still, changing someone’s personality like that is fucked.”

​

I clenched my fists. I wasn’t expecting this answer.

​

Jason continued,” But the thing that really makes her the worst to me is that she clearly feels guilty about it all, but all she can think of is ways to get rid of her guilt. Like, she never even tried writing her friend back, right? She just jumped to the first solution that made her feel better. I’m not even touching the part where she robs a bunch more people of their autonomy.”

​

“So you don’t think she’s justified in any way?”

​

“Hell no.”

​

“You’ve forgiven me for a lot of dumb shit over the years.”

​

“Yeah, well, that didn’t hurt anyone else but the two of us. This has transcended the realm of stupid mistakes. She knew what she was doing and just kept pushing. She never even felt bad until others saw her with her mistake. She’s not just unforgivable, she’s a monster.”

​

“I see,” I had stopped looking at his face long ago. I was staring at the table now.

​

“That’s just my take, though. I’m sure other people could read it differently.”

​

“I don’t care about their opinions,” I replied quietly.



The conversation continued on for a while. I was only half listening. Jason thinks I am irredeemable, unforgivable, a monster. I wanted to say that he was wrong, but he couldn’t be, could he? He was perfect. If he said I was a monster, then I was. That’s all there was to it.

​

It’s been several days since then. I keep listening to that recording. I don’t know who the other voice is, but his scathing review of the actions of the main character I described to him won’t leave me. It hurts. It hurts in a way I am not used to.

​

The horde of people with names I seem to know comes by daily, although as time goes on, there are fewer and fewer of them. I can’t even pretend to be concerned about them; thinking about them makes my head hurt, and I am grateful that the thunderous chorus of knocking has quieted.

​

In these past few days, only one solution has presented itself to me. I am the problem; I need to go away. The method is simple, I’ll fling myself from my window. The problem is that I want to send this document to the other voice in the recording, but I can’t find the correct name. I think of it, and so many names pop into my head.

​

After failing to find the correct name, I decided that I would just send it to every single person that came to mind when I thought of the voice. I just hope it makes it to the correct person. I want them to read this and come to a judgment that can only be reached by knowing me intimately. Selfishly, I am hoping they decide to forgive me, but I hear those words again and again, and I know that’s just wishful thinking.

​

Before I sign off, I want to tell you. Isabell, Taylor, Jason, Braydon, whoever you really are, I’m sorry. I’m sorry, and I think that with whatever tiny part of me that is a normal human and not a monster, I probably did love you.
