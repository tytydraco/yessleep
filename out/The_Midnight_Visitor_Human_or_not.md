This incident dates back to the late 1980s when my father, having completed high school, moved from his village to a semi-urban area in the same state for higher studies. He lived in his cousin's house, who was also pursuing the same course. They were very close, and their daily routine was well established.

In the house, they had a dog named Jolly. Every night, it was my father's responsibility to open the terrace gates around 10-11 PM, allowing Jolly to roam outside for a while. Jolly would walk around the terrace, and once he was ready to come back inside, he would bark, signaling my father to close the door. This became a routine that both my father and the dog followed religiously.

One interesting thing about their household was the contrast in schedules between my father and his cousin. His cousin was a morning person, always waking up early, while my father was more of a night owl. Around 1 or 2 AM, my father would often find his cousin in the kitchen, drinking water from the fridge. It happened so frequently that it became a normal occurrence, and this routine carried on for over a year.

One evening, after dinner, my father opened the terrace gates as usual so Jolly could go outside. But that night, something strange happened—Jolly refused to step onto the terrace. Instead, the dog barked aggressively at my father, almost as if warning him. This was completely out of character for Jolly, who had never hesitated to go out before. The dog seemed terrified, eventually retreating into another room, where he continued to whine and cry throughout the night. It took hours before he finally fell asleep, leaving my father feeling unsettled.

Later that night, around 1 AM, my father followed his usual routine and went to the kitchen for a glass of water. As expected, he saw his cousin standing at the fridge, drinking water. My father approached him from behind, placed a hand on his shoulder, and casually asked, "What’s wrong with Jolly tonight? He refused to go out."

There was no response. Thinking his cousin might not have heard him, my father asked again, "Jolly is sleeping in your room, right?" Still, there was no reply. At this point, my father felt a little strange but assumed his cousin wasn’t in the mood to talk, so he shrugged it off and returned to his room to sleep.

The next morning, my father woke up at 6 AM, which was unusual for him. He specifically woke early because he knew his cousin would be awake, and he wanted to ask him about the previous night. When he walked into his cousin’s room, he asked why he hadn’t responded in the kitchen earlier. To his surprise, his cousin replied that he hadn’t woken up at all during the night and had slept straight through from dinner until morning.

Confused, my father insisted, "You were drinking water at 1 AM. You were even wearing the same clothes!" But his cousin firmly denied it, repeating that he hadn’t gotten out of bed all night. A chill ran down my father’s spine as he realized something was very wrong.

Suddenly, it hit him—he had forgotten to close the terrace gates after Jolly refused to go out. Panicking, he rushed to check the terrace. To his shock, the gates were closed, but not from the inside. They had been locked from the outside.

At that moment, it dawned on the entire household that something unexplainable had entered the house through the terrace during the night. My father had distinctly seen the gates open until about 1:30 or 2 AM, but by morning, they were shut from the outside. It was clear that whatever had roamed the house for hours wasn’t human.

The family was shaken, and my father, in particular, was left with the chilling memory of the silent figure in the kitchen that night—someone, or something, that wasn’t his cousin.
