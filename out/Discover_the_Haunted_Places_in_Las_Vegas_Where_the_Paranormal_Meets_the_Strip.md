However, beneath the glitz and glamour of the Strip, a darker side of Sin City awaits. The following is a guide to some of the most haunted places in Las Vegas, where you might just encounter a ghost or two.

**1. The Flamingo Las Vegas**

**5. The Palazzo Resort Hotel Casino**

The Palazzo, a luxury resort and casino, is relatively new compared to other haunted locations, but it is built on the site of the old Sands Hotel, which has its own ghost stories. The Sands was a significant part of Las Vegas history and had a reputation for paranormal activity. When The Palazzo was constructed, it seemingly inherited some of these lingering spirits. Visitors have reported unexplained noises and feelings of being watched, particularly in the areas where the old Sands once stood.

**6. The Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino**

The Westgate, formerly known as the International Hotel, was once home to Elvis Presley’s Las Vegas performances. Some believe that the King’s spirit might still linger in the hotel. Guests and staff have reported sightings of a figure resembling Elvis, as well as unexplained sounds and disturbances in the areas where he performed. The hotel’s connection to Presley adds a unique dimension to its ghostly reputation.
