Gray went to bat for me hard after everything that happened. I don’t know if it was because he really did believe in me, or if it was just the Partner Code that he talked about, but either way I was grateful.

 

Whitley’s house turned up little. The wide brimmed hat sat on a shelf in his front closet. The chalice was nowhere to be found. Another thing that was conspicuous in its absence was a computer.

 

Everyone we spoke to who knew Whitley said he didn’t do computers, or social media. He didn’t even own a smart phone. So that left one big, fat, glaring hole in all of this. Who made the videos?

 

I didn’t have much time to stew on that with the mess of other shit on my plate now. I just wanted this day to end. Thankfully, after many hours, it did.

 

Gray drove me to my car at the end of the night. Still parked where I left it. I walked briskly over to it, not keen to spend an extra moment near these woods.

 

“Cole.” Gray called after me.

 

“Yeah?”

 

“You okay?”

 

“I’m good. Don’t you start worrying about me now, old man.”

 

Gray laughed. “Oh okay, she gives me hell for calling her ‘kid’ but then she calls me ‘old man’, I see how it is. And for the record, I’m 45, so knock that shit off.”

 

I laughed in return. “Alright. I’m fine, middle-aged man.”

 

“Hey I’ll take that. That’s actually pretty fuckin’ optimistic.”

 

“Good point, you ain’t making 90. Not the way you eat.”

 

“Oh god no. But hey, hate all you want, chicks dig the dad bods.”

 

“Oh for fuck’s sake, goodnight Gray.”

 

“They do! I’m not sayin’ I understand it, but it’s a fact.”

 

“Stop speaking. See you tomorrow.”

 

“Yeah, yeah, whatever. Hey get some sleep alright? Get your granny sleep, I don’t want no more walking corpse as a partner.”

 

I threw him a silent and half hearted thumbs up as I got in my car and drove off.

 

I didn’t want to go home yet though. I knew what would be waiting for me when I did. I knew I would take one look at that board on my wall and I would get back to work. I wasn’t ready for that. I needed to decompress.

 

It took me a few wrong turns, but eventually I found my way back to 914’s Pizza.

 

The place was empty this time of night, but I saw Benji behind the counter, half heartedly mopping. His eyes perked up when he saw me.

 

“Hey! Wally’s partner! Daria, right?” He said, cheerfully.

 

“Hey Benji.” I greeted.

 

“What can I set you up with?”

 

“Another pepperoni slice would be good.”

 

“Ha. You liked it huh?”

 

“It was pretty great, I can’t lie.”

 

“Yeah that’s all Big Obi. Never let Wally change the recipe, Wally never let me change it either.”

 

“Well if it works, it works.”

 

“There ya go. If it works, it works... One pep, comin’ right up.”

 

I slumped into a booth and let out a very long exhale. I was glad I came here. For a brief moment in time, I didn’t have to be me. I didn’t have to carry all the shit that came with the decisions I had made. I could just be any other girl. I could just be no one.

 

A few minutes passed as I daydreamed about anything other than work. The things I wanted to do once this was over. Funnily, they always seemed to be the same things, and there always seemed to be something in the way. Thankfully Benji arrived with the pizza before I could truly wallow in all that.

 

“You alright? Long night?” He asked.

 

“Oh man...” I remarked, chuckling and shaking my head.

 

“Ah shit, eh?” He answered, reading my non response. “Well hey, I’m not doin’ anything, you want some company?”

 

I thought about it for a moment. Weighing what I needed more. Peace and quiet was easier, but a friendly face was better. Being alone with my thoughts right now was ugly.

 

“Sure. That’d be nice.” I answered.

 

Benji sat across from me. Beyond the smell of pizza, I could smell a bit of weed wafting off of him. I didn’t mind it.

 

“So how is big man?” He asked.

 

“He’s... he’s Gray.”

 

Benji let out a short laugh. “Yeah he is... He grows on you though.”

 

I nodded. “He’s not so bad... Are you from New York too?”

 

“Oh, no, I’m from here. Wally was already working here when I met him. He kinda took me under his wing after Obi and all that happened.”

 

“Right, that makes sense... Can I ask you something else?”

 

“Yeah, go for it.”

 

“Do you have a website?”

 

Benji rolled his eyes “Oh that son of a bitch. He told you about the website?”

 

“He mentioned it, yeah.”

 

“He makes fun of me all the damn time for that website. It’s a hobby, it’s not even anything. I didn’t even make it, I took it over from my dad.”

 

“What is it about?” I asked.

 

“It’s just talking about all the, like, unsolved stuff and haunted places and whatever else that goes on in the eastern provinces. Because you never see it talked about, we’re so under the radar over here, but there’s so much good shit... You should give it a look, honestly. It’s super informative, I cite all my sources. I got it all: The Goatman of Pleasant Peak, The Willow Bay Fog, The Lady of White Point Bridge, The Bakersfield Cross, Hawthorn Woods, The Curse of Ashbrooke House, you name it.”

 

“Wow... I haven’t heard of any of those.”

 

“Really!? Oh my god, you gotta. If you’re gonna live here, you gotta know at least some of this stuff. The Elegy Murders? The Lockeport Lighthouse? No?”

 

“Not a clue... But I’ll tell you one thing. Once this case I’m on is all over, you’re gonna have one hell of an addition.”

 

Benji’s eyed widened and he leaned forward in his seat. “Really?”

 

“You know I can’t tell you anything... But it’s weird, is all I’m saying.”

 

“Shit... Well be careful out there, my friend.” He said, his tone turning to one of extreme caution.

 

I decided to test him. “You don’t actually believe in... all that, do you?”

 

“I mean... It’s tricky.” He answered. “A lot of it, probably not but... All it takes is for one of them to be real. That changes how you look at everything else.”

 

“And you know one of them is real?”

 

“...Yes.”

 

The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. I didn’t intend for the conversation to go this way. I guess I couldn’t escape it anywhere. He was right, though. All it takes is for one to be real, and I knew this one was real.

 

Benji eventually steered the conversation to a lighter note, for which I was grateful. I’m not sure I could’ve managed it myself. I was jealous of how effortlessly upbeat he was. He and Harmony were similar in that regard. It turns out that in his case a lot of it was due to a terrifying mixture of weed and caffeine. Maybe I ought to try that.

 

He actually tried to sell me some pot brownies on the down low before I left. He tried to sell weed to a fucking cop. I couldn’t believe it. I bought four.

 

I arrived back to my dark and sad apartment. The stacks of boxes and cork board taunting me as I entered. I was reluctant to get back to work. Part of my brain fought against it, but it had no chance.

 

I sat at my laptop and opened up a browser. I didn’t care to check on my own account. That experiment was over as far as I was concerned.

 

The first thing I wanted to look at was the Candle Caine game... Who else played it? Where did it come from? I found around two dozen videos of people attempting it. Not that many, all things considered. I had overestimated its popularity. Most people didn’t get any results, and a few very obviously faked it for clicks.

 

As for the origin, it was hard to determine. They all just said they heard about it, either from a friend or online. None of their accounts seemed suspicious, and none of them seemed to know anything more. But the curious thing... Harmony’s account followed almost all of them.

 

Whitley said the game was for her, I wondered if Candle Caine was what he meant, and now this confirmed it. Whoever created it and sent it out intended for Harmony to find it and play it. A fake viral trend targeting one girl, but why her? And could I believe that Whitley, the 60 year old priest who didn’t own a smart phone, set all this up?

 

More was happening here. She was chosen for something. Raised like cattle to fulfill some purpose, but what? I had to dig deeper. There had to be more to this.

 

After relentless Googling leading me nowhere, I decided to type in Benji’s website. Maritime Mysteries. After all, Harmony wasn’t the only strange incident in this town.

 

The site was practically archaic. Web 1.0 table-based set up at its nostalgic best, full of clip art and word art and clashing colors. It felt wrong to see it without the boxy gray Windows 98 U.I. around it. I expected to see phrases like ‘cyberspace’ and ‘web surfing’ and ‘the net’. Made sense that Benji’s father was the original owner. I guess Benji never felt the desire to update it.

 

My mission, beyond admiring the charm of a bygone era, was simple enough. Drop some keywords in, and see if anything even remotely like this has happened here before. Maybe then I could suss out a method to the madness.

 

I went broad at first. I thought about the constant missing eye reoccurrences. I searched “eye” and, unsurprisingly, it turned up several results. Most of them, a mere innocuous word usage in the body of the article. “Keep an eye on blank” et cetera. There were a few mentions of eye gouging. One serial killer had a motto of surgical eye removal, in addition to organ removal and some weird shit about plants. Nothing that would indicate a connection, however.

 

I tried something more specific, “left eye” – this yielded no results. Neither did “Chalice” or “Hat Man.”

 

But I knew the words I really wanted to write. If there was anything to this, then these words would be there. “Candle Caine.”

 

One article popped up, but curiously, the words Candle Caine did not appear together in it. Instead, multiple separate instances of Candle and Caine. The article was titled “The Church of the Father.”

 

I was not a religious person, but I still did not like the sound of that. A sliver of trepidation crept through me, but I stuffed it down and clicked on the article.

 

“Over 50% of residents in Nova Scotia practice Christianity.” The article began. “Mr. Caine used to be one of them. He was raised in a strict, religious household in the early 1960s and attended church regularly. That was, until his parents divorced when he was at the young age of six and his father moved to a different province. Some say it was the divorce that did it - the first domino that began to knock them all down. Some say it was just mental illness. Others, however, believe it was something more sinister.”

 

An interesting start. Mr. Caine... Could he be our Candle Caine? I hastily continued on.

 

“Nevertheless, Caine would allegedly begin sleepwalking and speaking to an imaginary friend shortly thereafter. A man he would call “Father.” Initially his mother believed this to be a coping mechanism for the estrangement of his real father, but Caine would always insist that his imaginary Father was different. His behavior would change over time too, becoming cold and distant. He would throw tantrums and screaming fits any time he would be taken to church. Caine’s mother sought the help of many professionals, but his behavior only persisted and worsened by the day. Violent outbursts became the norm. By the age of 16 he had renounced his Christianity entirely, pledging himself only to the “Father.” He would adorn his room and his school books in pentagrams and other strange satanic imagery. By the age of 25, he had officially opened his own congregation. By the age of 31, he had his own compound in Springhill and dozens of loyal followers.”

 

I took a long breath and rubbed my face. I hated the sound of this. With every new piece of information it became clearer that this was somehow our guy.

 

“Despite using common Satanist imagery in their teachings and rituals, it would be incorrect to characterize The Church of the Father as such, as they refused to ever put a name to the being they worshipped. Nor did they describe its physical traits. No horns, no hooves, just The Father. One former member would say in an interview in 1996 that The Father had no form at all. She would say “The Father is a thought. The Father is a dream. The Father lives in the wax of the melting candle.””

 

I shuddered at the mention of candles, even though I knew it was coming. Surely everyone thought at the time that these were just the ramblings of a mad, brainwashed woman. But I knew it was more than that.

 

“Comparing it to other cults, The Church of The Father was unremarkable in size or duration, lasting only around 6 years at the compound until reports reached police of mysterious deaths in the community. Upon investigating, the bodies of three young women were found inside an unused silo, their flesh severely burned and melted off by heavy amounts of molten wax. While their fates were initially deemed to be part of some kind of grotesque ritualistic sacrifice, Mr. Caine himself would only ever describe them as “attempts.” Caine would take his own life while evading police custody in 1995, and his body was placed in an unmarked grave. The cult would quietly disband thereafter.”

 

I could only think of my dream. The one where everything was on fire and my body melted into wax. In the dream I felt no pain, but I don’t imagine I could say the same for those poor girls.

 

Was this what was happening? Was Whitley carrying on the work of a 30 year old cult? The word ‘attempts’ stuck out and made my skin crawl. Attempts at what? If those girls were attempts, then what does that make Harmony? Hell, what does that make me?

 

My leg was restlessly bouncing for god knows how long, I fidgeted with my nails until they were red and raw. I knew I had to snap out of it, but I didn’t want to go to bed. I wasn’t ready for what my mind would conjure up in my sleep. I chose a third option and drew myself a hot bath. It was the only way to be sure that I could relax and that I wouldn’t be tempted by my work.

 

The water was nearly scalding and it was perfect. I wanted to burn away all the pain. I leaned my head back and surrendered to it. It felt like melting, but a good kind of melting.

 

I chuckled as I took in all the bruises and scrapes all over me for the first time. All that work to get this body and here I was, fucking it up... I probably wouldn’t be thirst trapping any time soon.

 

I probably could’ve fallen asleep in that bath. I had found myself a small pocket of peace, despite all the insanity rapping at the door of my brain. I held it at bay, the water was my bubble, and my consciousness was waning. But then I heard a crash.

 

Somewhere outside the bathroom, something fell, and a loud clattering followed. It sounded like someone dropping an open box of cereal, or emptying the beads off of a bunch of Mardi Gras necklaces. I jumped out of the bath, spilling a puddle of water on the tiles. I wrapped a towel around me tightly and slowly inched towards the door.

 

“Shit.” I muttered to myself silently in frustration. I didn’t think to bring my gun in here. It was still sitting at my desk on the opposite side of the bedroom.

 

I steadied myself and opened the bathroom door a crack. I couldn’t see too well as my eyes struggled to adjust to the darkness, but I was fairly sure I didn’t see anyone out there, so I cautiously opened the door the rest of the way and stepped out.

 

I took three long, slow steps out into the dark bedroom, then an agonizing, sharp, stabbing pain shot through my foot and I instantly fell backwards on my ass. Confusion gave way to grim realization. Now I knew what fell. My giant tube of thumbtacks.

 

I pulled my foot up to take a look at it, and saw the glistening little circle of metal sticking right into the arch. With my thumb and index finger I yanked it out, letting out a short and involuntary grunt of pain as I did. It hurt like hell. So much worse than any Lego or toy car I had ever stepped on as a kid.

 

I slowly scrambled back to my feet, making sure to only put weight on my left foot. I surveyed the room as my eyes successfully adjusted. They were everywhere. Hundreds, all over the floor.

 

I did leave my window open, and there was a breeze coming in, but was the tube THAT close to the edge of my desk? Could it really have just fallen by itself? I was skeptical and I remained on alert, but first thing was first, I had to get these tacks off of my floor.

 

I shuffled my feet slowly without ever lifting them, and began pushing the tacks into a more manageable pile in the center. It wasn’t easy to corral them all, and I still felt the pinch of a few as they awkwardly slid and caught on the uneven floorboards, but I was managing.

 

I reached the foot of my bed and swept underneath it with my good foot. Surprisingly, and thankfully, there weren’t many tacks under there that I could feel. I made a mental note to move the bed later.

 

I turned back towards the ever-growing pile to continue my irritating work... until I felt a hand violently clasp around my left ankle. The nails dug into my skin. My adrenaline spiked and time seemed to slow. I was living everyone’s nightmare. Someone was under my bed. The hand jerked my foot backwards, either attempting to pull me under, or just make me fall on my face.

 

I steadied myself with my right foot and, with every bit of force I had, kicked my left foot in multiple directions. I tried slamming the hand upwards into the hard wooden footboard. After a few violent tries, the grip released. In my panic and desperation, I attempted a big leap over the pile of tacks in front of me. Only I undershot it. My foot slammed down with the weight of my entire body into the prickly mass. Instantly an incalculable amount of punctures. It felt like a thousand frostbites, but as uncomfortably invasive as a surgery.

 

My balance faltered as I was overcome with pain. The metal in my foot, in that moment, became an ice skate. I lost all traction and fell forward, fortunately past the larger pile, but I still hit plenty as I smacked the ground. I felt new punctures directly in my kneecaps, and more than a few in my forearms as I used them to brace my fall. The ones hitting bone hurt exponentially more.

 

I screamed in agony. My body couldn’t stop shaking. I didn’t want to move a muscle out of fear of more tacks sticking their way into my skin. My only lifeline was my towel, which was just thick enough to cushion my torso from deeper stabs.

 

I crawled up to one knee, then quickly got my second knee under me, but I could already hear heavy footsteps skulking behind. I had no time to react before that same hand ruthlessly grabbed a fistful of my hair, yanking me down and dropping me on my back. My head whiplashed off the ground. I instantly knew I was concussed. It ached so much I almost didn’t notice the fresh tacks in the back of my skull.

 

I finally saw him, but his identity remained hidden behind a crude, plaster goat mask. He was dressed head to toe in black, with a black hood and gloves. I got no details, except for his blue eyes.

 

I instinctively flipped over on my stomach, but then he was straddling me. His hands plunged into my hair again. I was staring at the pile of tacks now inches from my face, and I felt him begin to push my head towards them.

 

I planted my hands down in the tacks and attempted to pushed back, but he was too strong and I was in too much pain. My face got closer and closer, the metal spikes nearly touched my eyes. I flailed and I writhed, but it was no use. I did the only thing I could do. I closed my eyes.

 

They slid in one by one, so agonizingly slow. My nose and eyebrows took the first ones. It was even worse than falling on them. I stopped pushing back, I lost all my fight and I wanted it to at least be quick. My head slammed into the hardwood floor and picked up a dozen more tacks with it. My cheeks, my lips, my chin, all pinned up and peeled back like a butterfly in a picture frame. I couldn’t distinguish where they all were anymore. It was a blur. But he wasn’t done. He slammed my head on the floor over and over. It all went numb after the fourth time. I let my body go completely limp.

 

I felt him climb off of me, and I heard his footsteps move towards my desk. Then the swiping sound of him picking up my gun.

 

This was it. If I had anything left inside of me to fight, this was the last chance I would have to find it.

 

I knew one thing, just one. Those big, heavy boots of his must have picked up a lot of tacks. Meaning he was on ice skates just like I was.

 

I put everything I had into one kick, right at his foot. Sure enough, it slid and he lost his balance. I then grabbed a handful of the tacks and hurled them haphazardly at his face. He put his free arm up and turned his head away. I used that moment to coil myself around his gun brandishing arm and attempt to pry it free. His grip was strong and he tried to wrench me back, so I opened my mouth and brought my teeth down hard on his thumb. The coppery taste of his blood filled my mouth as I grinded and gnashed. I heard him scream in pain and eventually he slightly relinquished his grip on the gun.

 

I wrestled it from him the rest of the way and wasted no time pointing it back at him, getting a shot off at his head. The bullet grazed either his temple or his ear and he ran. I got a few more shots off but my aim was abysmal. He got away. I couldn’t give chase. I couldn’t do much of anything. That final burst was all I had.

 

I pulled my limp body across the ground to my desk and grabbed my phone. I felt myself losing consciousness so I had to act fast. I called Gray.

 

“Yo.” He answered.

 

“Get the fuck... over here...” I managed to squeeze out between long breaths.

 

“Cole? Shit! What happened? Are you alri-”

 

I dropped the phone and slumped over to my side. My eyes rolled back and I passed out.

 

I knew I was dreaming immediately. I found myself sitting on an old wooden bench on a sandy beach, gazing out at the sunset. It was so beautiful. I felt no pain, only a calm breeze. Maybe this wasn’t a dream, I thought. Maybe I was dead.

 

“It would’ve been nice.” A soft and familiar voice spoke from my left. I turned and saw Harmony sitting right beside me. Not a ghoulish or demonic visage; just her as she used to be. As she should be. She didn’t look away from the water.

 

“What would?” I asked.

 

“If we ever got to meet... Really meet.”

 

“Yeah... I think I would have liked that.” I agreed. “You seemed nice... The real you. Before all this.”

 

“I’m still here... I’m not gone.”

 

“Where are you then?”

 

“On this beach. I’m always here.”

 

“But this isn’t real. This is just my dream.”

 

“It’s not your dream, it’s mine. I left it to you, in my eye.”

 

I struggled with the abstract absurdity of that statement, despite the fact that it was most likely the honest truth.

 

“I think I’m just crazy...” I replied.

 

“Everything is crazy. Who cares if you are too?”

 

I chuckled. “I care... I have to find you... I have to solve this.”

 

“No... You’ve done too much... You’ve hurt too much... I don’t want to hurt you anymore. Maybe you can just let me go. I’m okay here, on the beach, behind your eye.”

 

“I can’t do that.” I answered plainly and honestly. It was beyond choice. I couldn’t stop if I tried.

 

“Why haven’t you unpacked?” Harmony asked, changing the subject.

 

“What?” I stammered.

 

“All those boxes in your apartment... Why haven’t you opened them?”

 

“I... I haven’t had the time.” I reasoned.

 

“You’ve had the time. And you still have time. But you’ll regret it if you take too long.”

 

“What are you talking about?”

 

“You exist in that new place, but you’re not living in it. You haven’t made it yours. You did this for a fresh start. You did this to be happy, but you’re not letting yourself be.” Harmony paused and sighed. “I’m sorry... I really do think we could’ve been friends... Maybe I could’ve been your person.”

 

“My person?”

 

“I gave you my eye to see me, but I see you too. I’m not the only one who’s half alive.”

 

I grimaced. “I don’t care about that. That doesn’t matter. I’m supposed to save you. That’s my job. That’s my only job right now.”

 

“I care.” She cut me off. “I would have cared. You need someone. You don’t have anyone. And I would’ve loved to be your someone... I would have pushed you on the dance floor whether you liked it or not.”

 

“Yeah, I don’t really dance...” I said, my hands absent-mindedly fidgeting.

 

“Yes you do. You dreamed of it. You dreamed of getting out there, being free, being yourself, and dancing. You thought you’d stop being afraid once you were fully you, but you’re still afraid.”

 

“You saw my dreams too? Is nothing private?” I asked playfully, trying to curb the uncomfortable feelings being dug up.

 

“No. I didn’t have to.”

 

I shook my head and chuckled again, “You’re talking to me like you’re not the one going through hell.”

 

“Well, I’d say we both are...” She responded. “And you’re all I have right now. Just you and this beach.”

 

“So does that make me YOUR person?” I jested.

 

Harmony smiled, but then her expression turned to sorrow. “I’m so sorry. I’m sorry I did this to you. I never meant for it to hurt so much. I just wanted someone to see what was happening and to find me, but I almost got you killed.”

 

It took her saying that for my mind to truly set. I clenched my jaw. “No you didn’t. It’s my job. I chose this. This is mine and mine alone... And I will still try to save you.”

 

“I don’t know...”

 

“I will. I will save you.” I stated with a steely determination. “And after I do, maybe I’ll let you take me dancing.”

 

I tried to sound confident, but I’m sure I got a little red.

 

Harmony laughed, finally turning away from the water to look at me. Something about that smile in the sunset made my breath falter. She brushed her hair aside and simply said, “It’s a date.”

 

“Cole!” I heard an echoed shout from so far in the distance. I didn’t want to leave this place, but I felt myself being pulled away.

 

“Wait...” Harmony said, her eyes glazed over in sudden fear. “Something happened...”

 

“What? What happened?” I asked.

 

“Cole!” The shouting came far closer and the dream began to fade. I tried desperately to remember all the details of this moment as I was being ripped from it. I wanted to stay, and I needed to remember. The intense, throbbing pain returned.

 

“No. Oh god no.” Tears began streaming down Harmony’s face.

 

“What is it!?” I yelled, but my tether to that place broke. Everything went to black. It was gone. Her expression was seared into my memory. I had hoped that it would be her smile, but instead it was her terror. For what? I had no idea.

 

I could only manage to force open one of my eyes. When I did, I saw Gray standing over me, his face drenched in its own horror.

 

“Holy shit you’re not dead, thank god. Listen, I got paramedics coming, you’re gonna be okay.” Gray said frantically.

 

“I... I saw...” I tried to articulate a sentence but I was overwhelmed with fatigue and agony.

 

“You saw? Did you see who did this to you?”

 

“He wore a mask... He was tall... and thin...”

 

“Okay. It’s okay. Don’t speak, just relax. Here, let me get you on the bed at least.” He said before hooking one arm around my back and the other under my knees. I screamed in pain as he hoisted me up. Every single movement, a painful reminder of the metal pins in my flesh.

 

“Shit. Sorry.” He exclaimed. “Do you want – let me get you a shirt or something. They’ll probably take it off when they pick all that shit outta you but still, I know what it’s like having a neighbour accidentally see too much of you. It’s fuckin’ awkward forever, you gotta move buildings and...” Apparently rambling was one of Gray’s coping mechanisms.

 

Gray rummaged through my closet to find a shirt. I only had about eight unpacked. “The hell is ‘Bullet Club’? Do I have to worry about you? Like, what’s next, a Punisher shirt?”

 

I let out an involuntary and pained snicker. “Shut up.”

 

“Oh well, it’s the biggest one here, it’ll cover all your stuff.” Gray handed me the shirt. “Do you need me to...?

 

“I got it. Thanks. Just look away.”

 

Gray did as I asked. I dropped my pin filled towel and slowly put the shirt on. It was a nearly impossible task. The metal shifting under my skin was unbearable and my hands had very little strength.

 

Gray got a call and he picked it up. I took the time to begin pulling some of the tacks out of my fingers.

 

“What? Yeah, no, I was driving. There was an emergency, I couldn’t pick up. What’s going on?” Gray muttered into the phone.

 

Now that I had some of my fingers free, I moved my hand to my closed eye. Sure enough there was a tack lodged in my top eyelid. I couldn’t even feel it amongst the rest. The skin tugged as I pulled it, but eventually it released and I could open my now bloody eye.

 

“What?” Gray exclaimed in a breathy tone I could only describe as utter dread. “What the fuck are you talking about?”

 

I looked up at him as he began to pace around the room.

 

“No... No that’s... Fuck... Okay... I’m with Cole right now, she... Yeah, I’ll be there, just give me some time, alright?”

 

Gray hung up the phone, then put his head in his hands.

 

“What was that?” I asked.

 

Gray dropped his hands and tried to play it off. “Don’t... Don’t worry about it right now. We just gotta get you taken care of first.”

 

“No. What happened?” I insisted.

 

“Cole...”

 

“What happened? Fucking tell me.”

 

Gray clicked his tongue and grimaced. “Evelyn is dead.”
