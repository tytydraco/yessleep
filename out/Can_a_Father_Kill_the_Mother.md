She was like a nightmare chasing me…  
She never stopped talking, until her voice became a punishment—hell itself tormenting me.  
I hated her voice deeply, yet every night I wished to hear it scream or cry.  
I hated seeing her, hated looking at her, but I longed to watch her suffer… even to death.  
So I wanted to kill her. I tried many times, and each time I failed.  
In the end, I couldn’t kill her. My mother… I couldn’t kill her myself.  
But I found a way to get rid of her without touching her.

I began to wonder: can a father kill the mother?  
I asked myself that question hundreds of times while staring at my father and smiling.  
My father, who was so gentle, smiling and kissing her forehead, crowning her like a queen.  
The question seemed ridiculous at first… how could this loving man kill?  
More precisely, how could he kill her?  
But there had to be a way.  
What could drive a father to destroy his family and kill the love of his life?  
What reason could pull him from light and throw him into the depths of darkness?  
Is it betrayal? Hatred? Rage? I don’t know.  
So let’s try them all…

I began my plan, with demons dancing in my head.  
I would make him angry with her, make him discover her betrayal, then hate her, then kill her.  
My dear mother… she must die.  
There is no other option for her. She must die.

On Thursday, I decided to begin.  
I bought a new number under the name “Ahmad,” and used a photo of a strange man.  
At midnight, when everyone was asleep, I took my mother’s phone and saved the number.  
I started sending obscene messages about love and lust and more.  
I spent over an hour sending messages from both sides, as if my mother was the one replying.  
Then I deleted the conversation from her phone, and erased the number.  
I kept doing this for a full week.  
Every day, I took my mother’s phone and sent many messages about various things.

And this was the final day.  
I sent the last message from my mother’s phone to the number, saying:  
“Let’s kill my husband and run away together.”  
The other number replied:  
“Okay, today I’ll break his car, and tomorrow I’ll sneak into your house and kill him, then we’ll run away together.”

I felt pleasure and madness, laughing with joy.  
I saved the number in my mother’s phone under the name “My Love,” and didn’t delete the messages—just hid the conversation.  
Tomorrow, the fun would begin…

I left the house at 3 AM and started smashing my father’s car windows.  
In the morning, I woke up late—after my family—to avoid suspicion.  
I walked into the living room; the atmosphere was tense. My father was angry, my siblings were scared, and my mother was nervous.  
I asked many questions: “What happened? Who did this?”  
My father looked at me and said: “Was it you? Did you fight with someone?”  
I replied stupidly: “What are you talking about?”  
He answered angrily: “My car is broken.”

I pretended to be shocked, and the day passed with my father still angry.  
In the evening, I sighed with relief after finishing the AI-generated photos.  
Obscene pictures of my mother with that strange man.  
I smiled wickedly, took my phone, saved my father’s number, and sent him the photo from the new number.  
I waited half an hour… until I heard screaming from my house.  
I laughed, and sent a video of all the messages from both the man’s number and my mother’s.  
I ignored the many messages my father sent—they were insults, threats, and jealousy.  
The screaming outside grew louder, so I turned off my phone, removed the SIM card, and walked out pretending to be shocked.

I saw my father hitting my mother violently and screaming, while my siblings cried in fear.  
I approached him, trying to pull him away from her and asked what was going on.  
My mother was crying and swearing she hadn’t done anything.  
My father stood there, terrifying, and yelled at me, telling me everything that happened.  
I tried to defend my mother slyly, saying: “Maybe the man is lying. Check her phone—you won’t find anything.”  
My mother agreed, and indeed, he took her phone and started searching.  
Until he reached the hidden folder… opened it, and found the man’s number.  
He sat quietly, reading the last messages.  
It was the calm before the storm.

My mother didn’t stop crying, and her condition was pitiful.  
My younger siblings approached her, crying.  
As for my father, once he finished reading and was convinced she had betrayed him and planned to kill him, he exploded with rage.  
He started hitting her violently, more and more, until he pushed her hard and her head hit the glass table, which shattered as she fell to the ground.  
My mother was drenched in blood, bleeding, and on the verge of death.  
But he kept kicking her in the stomach… until she died.

He stopped hitting her when he heard the screams and cries of my siblings.  
He knelt beside her, touched her face and pulse, shaking her and calling her to wake up.  
Minutes passed… then he began crying and screaming, realizing she was truly dead.  
My siblings ran outside crying, and I stood there staring at my mother’s corpse.  
My feelings were conflicted… strangely, I felt pain in my chest.  
But that didn’t mean I wasn’t happy she was dead.  
I was smiling inside as I watched my father cry and hold her like a fool, screaming and begging her to come back to life.

Finally… my plan succeeded.  
I silently admired my victory, feeling joy and another feeling I still don’t understand.  
The father killed the mother. What I had wished for happened.  
The father destroyed his family, killed his wife and beloved.  
I don’t know… was it he who destroyed her? Or me? Or both of us?

I approached my mother’s corpse. She was beautiful despite everything that had happened to her.  
I smiled at her with a strange tenderness… as if I were seeing her for the first time, as if hatred had turned into something else I couldn’t understand.  
I had only hated her… and hated her… and hated her more.  
Then I cried.  
I cried over her corpse.  
I don’t know… was I pretending? Or did I truly cry?

My mother died.  
My father was imprisoned.  
My siblings were placed in an orphanage—I couldn’t care for them.  
And I remained alone…

I ruined my mother’s reputation.  
Then I killed her.  
Then I buried her.  
Then I cried at her funeral…

I don’t know if I’m human… or if I’ve become a demon?.

This is my story.
