“James” I whisper as I run my hands across the wall, finding my way through the dark hallway

“James, this isn’t funny my dad will kill you if I’m not home by 10!” I yell out wondering how I was convinced to explore some dumb old school 

“I promise you if you don’t come out now we’re done!” I scream hoping my empty threats will drag him out of wherever he’s hiding 

Tracing the wall I feel my foot hit something heavy bending down I scan my hand over the object and feel something odd, moving my hand up I feel…

“JAMES!” I scream stumbling back when I hear a slight scraping sound coming closer down the hall

Frantically I pick myself up and start sprinting towards the stairs or at least where I think the stairs are crashing into every object in my way when I hear the scraping start to pick up.

Sprinting so hard my legs feel like they’re about to collapse I eventually feel the floor disappear from beneath me, crashing down the first half of stairs I hear a crack as I feel something dripping down my hand as I scream in pain

Rubbing my hand gently across my arm I feel something poking out and realize it’s bone 

Picking myself up with one good arm I grab the railing and limp down the stairs as the scraping gets closer and closer and what sounds like laughter starts to ensue

With the luck of moonlight from the collapse corner of the building I see a door, quickly and quietly I try and sneak myself inside hoping to find a place to hide 

After hitting desk after desk I eventually find the teachers and hide underneath

*crash* I hear what sounds like a door being kicked open
About 30 seconds later I hear another and another until my door eventually crashes open, I cover my mouth as I almost began to squeal in fear as I hear desk after desk being thrown across the room, when eventually he gets to the last desk… my desk, I jump out and kick the table into him knocking him over as I try to sprint past him resulting in a slash to my back 

Screaming I stumble forwards still racing my way towards the door, pushing through the pain I slam it behind me as I try to remember where the crack in the wall we came in from is when I hear him start laughing again

With no time to think I run to the only door still closed and see stairs, quickly but as safely as possible I waddle down the stairs into what appears to be a boiler room, tracing my hands back across the wall I feel a switch 
*click,click* a small lightbulb in this huge room turns on providing a sliver of light 

Seeing some tape near a valve I grab it and wrap my arm the best I can, hoping it would help a little and grab a broken desk leg when I hear him kick open the stairway door saying singsongy  “come out princess, I promise to make it quick, ahh who am I kidding you damn near broke my arm missy, you wait till I find you” he says in a deep southern accent doing that manic laugh again

Step after step I impatiently wait as I finally hear him step where I’ve been waiting, through the pain I swing the pole as hard as I could where I assumed his head was
*crack*
He stumbles as I keep swinging over and over adrenaline deafening the pain with each hit, as he grabs his what I can now see is a machete and slashes me across my side, screaming in pain I swing and swing until he let go of the machete, the pole starting to bend I drop it picking up the machete with my good arm and swing and swing until I’m certain he won’t get back up

Now keeling over from exhaustion I feel the adrenaline dying down as I begin to feel my arm more then ever, wiping the blood off my face I realize it’s not mine as I limp up the stairs and find the way out only inches away, cursing myself I limp my way across the street and knock on the first door I saw and that’s when my memory starts to fade 

“We’ll yes Jocelyn, that’s when the neighbor opens the door and saw a women drenched in blood passed out on their porch” the man in a cop uniform says handing me a tissue to wipe away the tears I didn’t know I was shedding 

“We’ll, we will need you for some more questioning so don’t leave Jacksonville, get better” he says leaving the hospital bed as I lean back and drift asleep.
