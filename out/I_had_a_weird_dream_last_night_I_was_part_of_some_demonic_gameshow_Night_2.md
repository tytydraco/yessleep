I had another dream, I just woke up from it and I’m starting to think that this isn’t just a dream. 
I didn’t have the same dream, but a continuation and that demon remembered everything that happened from the last one. I have heard of dreams continuing where they left off before, but it was just so real…and that demon, Razaroth, the way he keeps acting just doesn’t sit well with me. Here is what happened.

HELLO ONE AND ALL AND WELCOME TO RAZAROTH’S GAME!! 

Let’s welcome Susan, this week’s returning contestant. The crowd erupted into applause as I was thrust upon the stage once again. Behind me emerged the host in a different outfit than the last time. He was wearing a sparkling blood red spandex suit with a dark tattered cape. “Hello my lovely ghosts and ghouls and welcome to this week’s episode of Razaroth’s Game! Tonight we have a special night planned for you since Susan here managed to make it to round 2! Isn’t that just so exciting?” The crowd on cue responded in kind. 


Whether from my second quizzical look or just because he wanted to talk about it, he continued on. “Oh like my special duds for this week's episode? Are you jealous? I bet you are. Maybe when you are in charge of my show you can dress up as you want.” I just sheepishly shook my head in response. “Listen, this is the first time in awhile that a contestant has given us a show. Consider this a thank you for giving it your all to beat my game” 

“What exactly is the point of your game?” The first thing I said this entire time. “Have you learned nothing from our last round? I keep telling you that you ask too many questions and I won’t know which one to answer.” A sly smile creeped up on his face. “Fine, then can you answer any of my  questions?” To this his smile only grew “Oh of course I can answer your questions dear.” Realizing my mistake I shut my mouth and waited for him to continue his twisted game. He waved his hand and a giant board appeared before us.It was completely blank, but it looked like a checkerboard. A single button slowly rose up in front of me. “Alright everyone, you know it you love it, it’s PRESS THAT BUTTON” The audience all yelled in unison. “You simply need to press the button Susan, that’s all.”

Steeling my nerves I did just that. The board whirled to life and all the tiles started to fill in. Loss, Trypophobia, Death, Water and so many more start to appear on the board. “It’s fear’s again?” I asked slowly, turning to the host. “ A soft chuckle emanated from his throat. I guess I got my answer. Looking back at the board only one tile was lit up. The light was moving from tile to tile. The next time I pressed this button it would land on a single fear just like the last time, but it seems like I can maybe time this one. I waited awhile watching for any form of a pattern. After what felt like hours I think I found my pattern. One, two, three, I pressed the button. The lit up tile changed in color for the first time. What was blue before, now turned red and was whirling around the board. The pattern didn’t matter. 

I should have known better, but I had to believe that I had some semblance of power in this. Slowly the tile came to a halt. Dysmorphia. “Oh, that’s a fun one. I don’t remember the last time we had that.” The host was behind me with his head at my shoulder. I didn’t hear him at all and I jumped to the side. Before I could even say a word I was transported once again inside that dark room. The walls collapsed and hundreds and mirrors started rising up out of the ground to form a maze. At the start was a ticket booth with Azaroth swinging a cane. “Come one, come all to the hall mirror maze. Make it to the other side and you win. Simple right?” I walked up and took a look in and saw myself in the first mirror. Looking back was me, nothing out of the ordinary. Except did I have that huge pimple on me before. Looking back at me was a giant mound on my check. I touched my face and I could feel it.

Curious more than fearful I looked further on in the maze. This time however It wasn’t something as small as a pimple a giant rash started forming across my arm. Bubbling up from the shoulder and down to the fingers, water blisters forming one after the other in a sea of undulating bubbles. Shocked I jumped back but when I looked at my arm nothing was there. I touched my face and the pimple was gone. “Oh looks like our contestant already figured out how this works. That’s no fun. Why don’t we amp up the changes each time.” His smile growing exceedingly large as he said this. “Amp up the changes? Aren’t they already at a more than decent pace.?” I thought to myself and didn’t dare say out loud incase things would get worse again.

I got myself back up on my feet and started once again at the start of the maze. Looking at myself in the reflection my facial features seemed off. Like they were moving. I looked like a different version of myself. That’s when I had an idea. What if I just close my eyes and run through this? Who cares what changes happen if I can’t see them? So I started walking with my hands out in front of me until I felt a wall and followed the wall for as long as I could. I will continue this until I reach the end and that’s when I couldn’t find any more walls. I opened my eyes and I was in the front of the maze with Azaroth sitting in the ticket booth once again. A sly look on his face as my brilliant idea shattered into a million pieces. 

“Fuck” The word slipped out of my mouth before I could realize. “You’re a clever one, but you can’t just ignore the maze. You need to actually participate in it.” Ignoring him I walked forward into the maze and the first mirror did the same as the time. With a deep breath I walked further in. Sores started forming on my thighs, forming into slits that dripped blood. I didn’t feel any pain though, so I kept walking forward. My face changed again, my hair was thinning and I seemed weaker. I kept walking forward, until I felt something in my chest moving. Looking in the mirror my breasts were growing and shrinking rapidly. Looking down a stifled scream came out. My skin was morphing and combining together back and forth. Pulling one way, then the other. Pustulous blobs of flesh moving to and fro as they combine, separate and combine again. Spewing, pulsing and bubbling all the while. 

“I need this to be over. This has to be over. I have to keep going.” I muttered under my breath trying not to cry. Shakingly walking forward. What can be worse than this? My body continued to change as I walked in the maze. My legs started to move faster, and faster until I was running through the maze. Crying at all the atrocities I was seeing, until thump. I hit my face on one of the mirrors. It was the last mirror before the end and all I could see was me. Except I was a child. Hating what I saw, my tears went from sadness to a rage as I punched the mirror in front of me. 
Blood pooling around my fingers as the glass cut into each one in various points. Looking back at me was no longer my childhood self but me. The real me. My hair, an absolute mess, clothes disheveled, and my hand bleeding. 

I walked out of the maze to an eruption of fanfare. “Susan has done it again everyone!! She has cleared the second round!” As that was being said I was transported back to the set of the game. Looking out at the audience though some of them seemed disappointed that I made it. I thought that they wanted me to beat this game? However before I was able to ponder this much more the host appeared behind me once more. “Two rounds in a row. You’re getting quite good at this. I wonder if you can make it past the final round?” “Yeah, me too” I said just wanting this to be over. Azaroth looked down at me this time with a look of disappointment on his face. “Are you not enjoying my game? Are you not having fun? It takes a lot out of me to bring you back here every night and keep you here for hours on end.”

”What” is all I could muster before I woke up. My alarm blaring, for 7 hours. Azaroth’s words echoing in my head “Are you not enjoying my game? Are you not having fun? It takes a lot out of me to bring you back here every night and keep you here for hours on end.” I’m starting to think he isn’t lying. My hand is still bleeding and covered in glass.
