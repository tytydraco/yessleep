Suddenly, in that moment, I was a bystander. I was viewing the scene as if I was a security camera in the corner. I saw my body, tucked in the blankets as the creature on the floor crawled around, creeping under the bed and into the closet. I could hear the door open and close although the doors never moved. I knew none of it was real, logically. I could not move, just lay there as tears fell down my cheeks in a silent cry that ended when I'd finally fall asleep. The Hat Man, or the Man with the hat, or whatever name you'll give him, was suspended in the air in the corner of my room watchingme. The only things visible were his pure white eyes, striking in the darkness. He watched as the creature with too many eyes and long, spindly, clawed hands pulled up the blankets up and around my chin. Something that also didn't happen in reality, as my collarbone was still cold. I took measured breaths, trying not to make any noise. 

Let me rewind a little, not much as Im sure, somehow, that this happened within the confines of half an hour. Believe me when i say that this is true, im not sure what happened ghag night, not completely. Ive done some research on google, even asking my Brother (who is much older than me) if he had any clue and sleep paralysis and nightime hallucinations are the only logical explanations, but i dont know. This felt all too real.

I knew the time. It was 2 am. I know this because I had stayed up on my phone for most of the night, due to seeing the man in the corner from the edge of my peripheral vision, all the meanwhile and not being able to put my phone down. Im an insomniac, so staying up late wasnt new to me, but the man was. My parents had came in and made me do it, I hadn't seen much point in sleep but I could try. The second I had gotten rid of that light source they struck. At first I wanted my back to the wall, that way I could watch the Hat Man and make sure he never left his spot, but then the fingers reached up my back, running fingers down my spine. I moved to sleeping on my back, where I did not dare to open my eyes. The Hat man did not moved but other came and thats when I shifted to watching like an outsider to my own body. 

I dont know how I fell asleep that night, and yet I did. Ever since then sleeping has been harder then usual. I have to remind myself there is nothing under the bed, or in the closet, or in the corner of the room. It's a struggle to not have some kind of nightlight in the room. I told a friend and we both laughed it off, but I'm scared. That was the most scared I've ever felt in my waking --or dreaming-- life. My childhood nightmares, the ones I had previously said were the most horyfiing thing I've ever witnessed had nothing on that night. I had never feared these kinds of monsters before, only ever tangible threats, but now...

I can still feel it sometimes, when Im trying to fall asleep. That gentle caress, soft but unsettling in a way that i will never recover.
