By the time we arrived, it was already late in the afternoon and the sun began to descend. The wall of fog came into view once again, and Em went forth without hesitation. Even though I had been there before, I underestimated how dense the fog would be. It felt different this time. Different time of year? Maybe that was it.

 

Em and I had to hold hands as we trudged through it, afraid we would disappear if we strayed more than a few feet away from each other. We tied a lot of ribbons as we went along.

 

The further we walked, the more the ground began to sink and squelch beneath our feet. I didn’t remember it being like this before, though we didn’t get this far in last time. Our feet quickly got soaked and covered in mud and moss. We had to lift our legs higher and higher as we stepped. It didn’t take long to realize we were wading into a bog. I told Em we had to leave, that it was too dangerous to be out here. Em got the idea in her head that this is what happened to Heather, that she ran out here and got stuck in the bog. Em was even more determined now to keep searching, but I screamed at her to stop.

 

“Em! Look around! We shouldn’t be here! We’re not prepared for this! Please, let’s just go back.”

 

“No! Lila, I can’t leave her out here like this! What if she’s alive? What if she needs our help?”

 

“I know but we don’t know what the fuck we’re doing! We could get lost! We could sink! We could die out here! Heather wouldn’t want this. Let’s just go back. Let’s get equipment and bring some more people and we can do this properly.”

 

“Lila…”

 

“Please. Please listen to me. I can’t lose you too, okay?”

 

Without another word, Em lowered her head and nodded. We turned around and started heading back the way we came.

 

At least, I thought we did. Things were unfamiliar as we walked. We couldn’t find the ribbons we tied on the way in. The fog only seemed to get denser, as did the vegetation. Fear and desperation were looming and creeping in slowly as time continued to pass without progress being made.

 

The irrational part of my mind went back to Black Eyed Susan. The killer in the wilderness who takes young girls. I knew Black Eyed Susan was long dead, but it didn’t stop the fear. Then my mind went to the scarecrow… Someone put it there all those years ago. But who, and why? This just felt like a place we shouldn’t be. I could read the same feeling on Em’s face.

 

The flora was rich and bountiful now. If everything wasn’t so hazy and grey, this place might look almost enchanted. Everything here was allowed to grow and die and grow again unbothered. What began as a scent of dead water slowly gave way to a floral fragrance. Like a grandmothers’ perfume, but way too much of it. It didn’t replace the smell of the dead water, it merely sat on top of it, creating a layered smell of flowers and death. It was nauseating. My head began throbbing.

 

We carried on, moving as straight as possible. It had to end somewhere, but we were getting tired and the sun was getting low. It wasn’t just physical fatigue, but mental too. My head continued to throb and I began seeing spots. My tired eyes began to make shapes out of the fog. I started thinking I was seeing things. Figures, exactly like the scarecrow. Standing on the edge of perception, staring at us. But they would be gone just as quick as they arrived. I tried to ignore it. Just my mind filling in the blanks with the memories of my dread. The knots on the trees played tricks on me too, almost looking like faces until I got close.

 

It got quieter as night fell. Much quieter. It began to look and feel like death, like we were ferrying ourselves to the underworld, even though the trees and flowers remained vital and healthy. In fact, it was odd how beautiful they looked. The picturesque flowers contrasted with the muddy, mossy, slimy mulch; and the stark desaturation of the fog. We were getting really scared now. The bog didn’t seem to want to end.

 

Em complained about her toes going numb, and I didn’t even notice that mine did too. The wet ground was so cold now, and our feet were completely waterlogged. That pins and needles sensation crept up from my toes to my ankles.

 

The figures didn’t stop appearing. Arms always outstretched, looking like little fuzzy crucifixes. It got harder and harder to pretend they were a trick of the eyes. I wondered if Em could see them too. One quick glance over to her and the expression on her face told me… She could. But it didn’t make sense. Why would there be scarecrows in a bog? Why this many? Why were they always so far away? I would’ve thought we would approach one at some point. Move past one. Even get remotely close to one, but they were always the same distance. Always on the edge of perception, no matter where we were.

 

They would have to be moving, but I never saw them move… I shook the thought from my head. I was just scaring myself. It had to be my imagination. It had to be. I couldn’t let myself go down this road. I had to focus on the task at hand. I had to focus on the reality of the situation.

 

I took a wrong step and my entire right leg sank into the dense muddy quicksand. I screamed, and I heard that scream echo through the trees. Normally, I don’t think I would have screamed, but the sensation disturbed me. It didn’t feel like my leg sank. It felt like it was pulled. Like a hand clasped around it and violently yanked me down. But I dismissed it quickly. It only felt like that because of how quickly I sank and how dense the mud was. My mind was playing more tricks on me. There was no other explanation. Em pulled me out, and we carried on.

 

Eventually the ground got more solid beneath our feet. It was a huge relief. Finally, it felt like we made progress, and we could rest our legs a little bit. Em collapsed on the solid grass, and I followed. She began to laugh a shaky, uneasy laugh that I had never heard from her before. Somewhere between a laugh and a cry. She was so scared; it was the only response her body gave her. I instinctively pulled her into an embrace. As much for my benefit as her’s. Her fingers dug into my back, refusing to let me go, and we stayed like that for a while.

 

“I’m sorry.” she said shakily, breaking the silence. “I’m sorry I made you come here. I totally fucked us.”

 

I was taken aback, I had never heard her swear before. I offered her as much reassurance as I could, but I was soon distracted by what I saw on the trees.

 

I wanted to see our ribbons, but instead I saw symbols carved into the wood. The most common one being an inverted triangle with a line through the bottom. I didn’t know what that meant at the time, but it scared the hell out of me nonetheless.

 

This didn’t look like a place that any human had touched, we were so much further inside than last time, and yet clearly someone had been here. Maybe it was Black Eyed Susan, I thought. Maybe this was where he hid, all those years ago.

 

“Look at all this.” I told Em while pointing at the trees, but when I looked back at her, she was standing and her eyes were as big as saucers. Her gaze was fixed upon something else. I turned my eyes to face whatever she was looking at… But I didn’t see anything. Just a big hawthorn tree off in the distance in a clearing, partially obscured by the fog.

 

“What is it?” I asked, squinting, trying to see what had her so transfixed.

 

“Do you see it?” She said, her voice shakier than I’ve ever heard before.

 

“Do I see what? Where? In the tree?”

 

“There’s something...” Her voice shrank to a whisper and she repeated her words. “There’s something...”

 

I looked back at the tree. I looked at the leaves. The branches. The trunk. I looked over it again and again. All I saw was a tree.

 

“Where? In the tree? What does it… look like?” I asked, trying desperately to understand though a part of me was afraid of the answer.

 

“It’s not IN the tree, it IS the tree. Something’s… wrong with it.” Em responded, not really clearing anything up for me.

 

I squinted and looked as hard as I could. Em was right, there was something a bit… off… But I couldn’t put my finger on it. It looked perfectly normal but there was just something uncanny about it. Were we just going insane?

 

“I mean… I guess it does look a little… I don’t know…” I said, unable to describe my thoughts. Then I shrugged and turned back to Em.

 

Em slowly turned to look at me, but as she did, I saw her eyes shift and look behind my right shoulder. Then they widened. She gasped. I saw a look of horror on her face the level of which I had never seen on anyone before.

 

I didn’t have a chance to look behind me. Em grabbed my hand and exploded into a full sprint away from the tree and through a small gap in the flora. My legs fumbled and I struggled to keep up, but she practically dragged me. Her grip on my hand was tight and unrelenting. Branches and twigs scratched and scraped my skin to ribbons, but I couldn’t feel it. We ran for what felt like miles. My legs screamed in pain and my chest heaved, but the adrenaline carried us both.

 

“What was it!?” I yelled over and over, but she didn’t answer. She just kept running.

 

We reached the sinking area of the bog again, but Em didn’t care. She trudged through like the devil itself were on our tail and I followed as best as I could. I got the chance to look behind me, but I saw nothing.

 

Then it happened… I got stuck. My leg went down awkwardly and my other leg sank behind it into the freezing cold muck. I felt the hand sensation on my legs again; but then a sharp, cold, stabbing pain. It felt like frostbite, but also something close to an… actual bite.

 

Em immediately wrapped her arms around me and pulled, screaming as she gave it everything she had. She didn’t get far, only succeeding in squeezing the remaining air out of my lungs. She tried again and again. Between each attempt, she looked behind me with unknowable fear and panic etched all over her face. She expected to see something.

 

I heard a twig break in the distance… So distinctly similar to the sound that sent us running years ago. Em panicked even more than she already was. She reached her hands into the muck, hoping to pull me up from underneath somehow. I saw her expression change to one of confusion.

 

She began to pull, but not on me. She found something else, something solid. As she moved it, I could feel it wrapped around me like vines, or tentacles. She pulled and pulled and then I heard a snap. Em fell backwards and some of the tension around me released. I felt a current under the mud where the snap was. Like a small hose lightly spraying underwater. It helped dislodge me, whatever it was. A few bubbles formed at the top.

 

I didn’t care to investigate, I simply pulled myself out with Em’s help and we stumbled back into a run. The bog thankfully came to an end and it was a forest once again. I saw in the distance, our saving grace. One of our ribbons. Then another. We followed them and just like that… We were out. We reached the end of the fog. The end of our nightmare. Way off in the distance, down the hill, we saw Lightbody Ranch. Past that: the faint, comforting glimmer of the lights of civilization.

 

Her parents were furious looking at the state of us when we hobbled back, well after nightfall. They put their foot down. No more searches. We didn’t object.

 

Em never really told me what she saw. Whether at the tree, or behind me. She said she didn’t know, then guessed that it must have been an animal. I wonder who she was trying to convince. I looked up the symbols I saw on the trees. It appeared to be the alchemic symbol for “Earth” which didn’t answer a whole lot.

 

We were both worn out… By this nightmarish night, but also by the entirety of the last few months. It was hard to see Em give up. She never gave up on anything or anyone, but after so long of not finding a single lead, and then potentially almost dying, it was time to call it quits. So that’s where we left it. All we could do now was pick up the pieces and try to carry on. Slowly but surely, we did.

 

The next year, Em graduated high school with honors and got herself into a fancy university on the other side of the country. I didn’t have a hope in hell of getting in there too, so… that was it. I didn’t want to lose her, but what could I do? No way was I going to let her not take that opportunity. We said our goodbyes, and then she was gone. I made sure to save my tears for later, and there were a lot of them.

 

I did tell her I loved her before she went, the way I wish I could’ve told Heather. As those words left my mouth for the last time, I knew she would never fully realize how much they meant. I wished that at some point I got the chance to tell her how much. But she was gone now, and I was on my own.

 

I’d like to say Em and I kept in touch. We did for a little while, but it fizzled out quickly. We weren’t made to interact like that - in text, behind a screen. That wasn’t us. It felt almost disrespectful to our friendship to reduce it to that. We agreed we would rather just meet back up someday and catch up on everything we missed. But time flew by and, for one reason or another, that didn’t happen. We had our own lives. It was just too hard to make it work. So that was it for Em and I. That was it for the Hell Sisters.

 

I found my way into city life not long after Em left. Got a job. Figured it out… Got a culinary degree of all things. The first year or so was rough. I would lie awake at night thinking about the bog, about Heather, about that weird tree – but through therapy and Melatonin it passed. The next few years were easier. Now that I was in the city, dating was a lot more feasible for me. It’s not like my preferences were a huge secret back in Willow Bay, but it was a little hushed. If I was too gay around Em’s father for example, I feel like he might have burned me at the stake or something. Nevertheless, I was getting laid now and that helped tremendously.

 

It’s hard to believe that nine years passed since the night at the bog. It was a distant traumatic memory. A crazy little story to tell friends. A classic, spooky “time I almost died” tale.

 

I thought that was all it was ever gonna be. I thought my time in Willow Bay was over. I thought I would never really get answers… I definitely never thought that I would hear the name Black Eyed Susan again. But then I got a phone call.
