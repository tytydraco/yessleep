“Have you ever wondered where you came from? 

Have you ever listened to His hum?

Have you ever wondered how life began?

Have you ever put faith in His plan?”


This was the beginning of a poem my mother wrote many years ago. She called it, “The Mystery of Life.” Every line asked a question, and every line had a rhyme. 

What none of the lines had, however, was an answer.

She was obsessed with life. Specifically, she was engrossed in the grand mystery of how we came to be. 

Were we created?

Were we a cosmic accident? 

Or are we just a simulation being run on an old computer?

It turns out, none of those were correct. At least, not completely. Because the truth was far, far more horrifying than any theory the human mind could conjure.


Part I

I‘ve made the decision to write down our family’s experiences after much deliberation; and even now, I’m not sure this information should be shared. The idea of anyone undergoing such a revelation turns my stomach.

Please…if even a tiny part of you feels inclined to choose blissful ignorance and stop reading, listen to it. Because once you choose to go down the cosmic rabbit hole, there’s no going back.

You can’t just…forget the truth.

Regardless, I can’t sit idly by and not share the truth. If you consider yourself a courageous person who can shoulder such a burden, then I invite you to grab some tea, sit in a comfortable chair, and read on. This is going to be a lot.

Right. Now that that’s all said, let’s begin.

The first encounter my family had with the spiritual realm happened when I was around eleven years old, in the middle of summer. Back then, it was just me, my sister Amy, and my parents, Mary and Joel Carpenter.

Both of my parents were caring, thoughtful, and strong providers. They loved me and Amy  more than themselves, and made sure to raise us as best they could.

My family was essentially the traditional American household; the kind of family you’d see eating dinner in a commercial, laughing and joking around.

But there came a day when that changed. Not all at once, but this day marked the beginning of when everything went wrong.
I was eleven years old, having trouble falling asleep. I remember clutching my stuffed animals tightly, tossing and turning in my racecar bed. 

And as I peered out of my window…I saw a star. It shined brilliantly, far greater than all the others. I remember it being shaped like a traditional star, with five points around it.

It didn’t look real. It’s borderline impossible to explain through text; if only I snapped a picture of it.
It looked like…static. Like it didn’t belong in the sky.
Everything around the star curved into it, as if the surrounding matter couldn’t stabilize. Like the universe was experiencing some sort of cosmic glitch.

It was mesmerizing. So mesmerizing, I almost ignored the blood curdling shriek of my mother. 

Terrified, and snapped out of my hypnotic trance, I hopped out of bed and made my way into the hallway. Amy was awake too; she was fourteen at the time, and much braver than I was. She told me to go back to bed, and that everything was alright.

I asked her where the scream came from, and she told me that mom had a nightmare, and that dad was comforting her. I asked if I could see mom, but Amy just urged me back to my room.

I really wish I listened to Amy. I wish I went back to my bed and drifted off to sleep; but that’s not what I did.
Instead, I cried and protested against Amy’s gentle urging, begging to see mom. At the time, I wasn’t used to hearing my mother scream, and it frightened me. 
Unfortunately, I soon came to accept her miserable wails as a common occurrence growing up.

I shoved Amy out of the way and sprinted down the stairs and into my parent’s bedroom. I saw my father hunched over the bed, clutching my mother’s hand in his. His face was drained of all color, as pale as a ghost.

My mother was covered by the bedsheets; I couldn’t catch a glimpse of her, but I could hear her panting and wheezing, as if she was out of breath.

“Dad? Is mom okay?” I asked. Dad’s eyes darted down toward me, a look of pure, unadulterated terror on his face. 
It was the kind of look that made my stomach drop. What could possibly be making my brave, strong, and resolute father as scared as a child?

“Isaac.” He whispered sternly, his eyes trained on me. 

“Go back to your room. Now.”

“But mom…she had a nightmare! Is she ok?” I asked again. My dad’s lower lip quivered, and for a split second his vision darted to the corner of the room, then back to me.

“Isaac…please. I need you and your sister to go to sleep. Please.” He pleaded again. Confused, I began to turn my head to check the corner where my dad briefly glanced.
But before I could see what was there, my dad grabbed my head and turned it back to face him. His eyes were wide, his palms sweating, as he mouthed the word “no”.

Because, although I never turned to look at it, there was something standing in the corner of the bedroom that night. Something that I’m forever grateful I never saw.

Tears in my eyes, I obeyed, and retreated back up the stairs. Amy was waiting for me at the top, and although her expression was stoic, I knew she was trying to hold it together for my sake.

I went to bed, although I barely got any sleep that night. And when morning finally came, I tried to convince myself that what happened last night was just a very vivid nightmare.

And for a moment, I believed myself. Because as I sat at the table for breakfast, Amy was unusually chipper, happily eating away at a blueberry pancake. 
My dad sat in his favorite rocking chair, sipping some warm coffee while reading the paper.
And I could hear my mother in the other room doing laundry.

“Good morning, champ! What’re your plans for today?” My dad asked; the same question he always asked me. 
With a smile and a shrug, I mumbled something about hanging out with some friends. My dad nodded, made one of his infamously bad jokes, and then returned to his paper.

I then joined Amy at the table.

“Hey, where’s mine?” I asked, gesturing to her pancake. She sneered at me, pulling the plate closer to her.

“Sorry, last one. And I’m not sharing.” She said with a mouthful of pancake and syrup.

I rolled my eyes.

“Mooom, Amy won’t let me have breakfast! I’m gonna starve!” I whined. I could hear my mom’s laughter from the laundry room, but something about it sounded…funny. Like it was strained.

I glanced at my sister, and then my dad. Come to think of it, I noticed that they seemed a little tense. Like they were trying to ignore…something.

It wasn’t until my mom walked into the kitchen that I understood what that something was. As she approached the table, she handed me a box of pop tarts. 

“Sorry buddy, the toaster’s not working. You might have to eat them cold.” She said, patting me on the head. But cold pop tarts were the least of my worries…because as I looked at my mother, who was clearly trying to wear a brave face…

I saw that she was very, very pregnant.
