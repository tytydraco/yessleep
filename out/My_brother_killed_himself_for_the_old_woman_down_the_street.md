CHAPTER ONE

 

My brother killed himself a couple of days ago. The old lady down the street made him do it. I don’t even know where to start, the past few days have been so bizarre, I can hardly comprehend it myself. I’ll do my best to get it all down in a way that makes sense.

 

It all started 19 years ago. My brother was born when I was 3 years old. Originally my parents were expecting twins, but one of them didn’t survive the birth. It wasn’t until many years later when I finally learned the full story behind what happened that day. My brother, the one that lived, was a normal, healthy baby boy. His twin on the other hand never had a chance.  
  


By looking at the body of my still-born infant brother, you would never had guessed something was wrong, it would have been all too easy for a passerby to think he was simply sleeping. His body was fully developed and showed no obvious signs of disfigurement, in fact he would have likely been just as healthy as my brother if he had been born with a heart.

 

No one could explain it, doctors had never seen anything like it before or since. A fully developed infant with every organ in place aside from the heart. It wasn’t underdeveloped or disfigured, it just simply was not there. There was an empty space on the left side of his chest where it should’ve been.

 

I personally think my brother was able to understand the loss of his twin. It was as though he sensed deep down that he was missing someone who was supposed to be there with him. Jimmy was always a troubled kid, he kept to himself and stayed quiet most of the time. When we would have family gatherings or birthday parties he always sat alone, trying to hide himself in the corner of the room.

 

Since I was 3 years older than him, we never really saw each other in school, only occasionally crossing paths in the halls during my senior year of high school. He was always by himself; I never saw him with any friends. At least none that he talked about or had over to the house. While I was concerned with chasing girls and going to parties, he seemed to prefer staying in his room alone.

 

He drew a lot, and he was actually pretty talented, but the shit that he drew was so weird. The art he made when he was secluded in his dark room was the first sign I noticed that there may have really been something wrong with him. His drawings were full of what seemed to me like demonic imagery. Scenes of hell fire and eternal torment filled his old, tattered sketch book. He drew pictures of demons ripping out peoples’ organs as they hung crucified on upside down crosses, people being burned alive, as well as scenes of people hanging by nooses attached to large, old trees. I’ll admit, for a while I was scared to be in the same room as him.

 

What little contact I had with him was completely severed when I left the state for college. I moved to the opposite side of the country and was busy putting myself through school by working full time as a bartender. Looking back on it now, that’s a lousy excuse for drifting so far away from my family back home, but I could have never predicted my brother would have done something like this. Or maybe I should have known, had some sort of older brother sixth sense. I’ve made plenty of mistakes in my life, not being there for my brother will always be my biggest.

 

Last summer I had taken a week off work to make my annual trip back home. I didn’t manage to make the trip often. I grew up in southwest Pennsylvania and now live and go to school in Oregon, so making the cross-country trek is often expensive and time consuming. Money and time are two commodities I don’t have an abundance of.

 

I landed in Pittsburgh in the early afternoon. The sun was high in the sky, making the air hot and humid as I walked out of the terminal. My mom picked me up, after our hello hug and putting my luggage in her car we then made the hour-long drive back home together. For privacy issues I will leave out the name of my hometown, it is a small community in SW Pennsylvania, and I don’t want to bring any unwanted attention the people who call it their home through this story. Me and my mom passed the time with small talk, I told her how work and school were going, and she filled me in on everything I missed while I was gone.

 

It was later that day, after we had finally made it to my parents’ house, where I saw my brother for the first time in over a year. He looked horrible, pale blotchy skin stretched over his gaunt body, the bags under his eyes were so pronounced it looked as though he had been punched in the face. He was never one for caring about his appearance, known for going days without showering or changing clothes, but I had never seen him look so ragged. He looked tired. Haunted.

 

We had an awkward family dinner that night, after which my brother slinked back up the stairs, returning to the solitude of his dark room. I helped my mom clean up the kitchen, then I went out to sit on the porch with my dad. We drank a couple beers together, catching up on what has happened throughout the last year. We talked for some time before I finally felt confident enough to bring up my brother.

 

“What’s wrong with Jimmy? He looks like shit.”

 

My dad pinched the bridge of his nose between his fingers while exhaling a long, labored breath. Finally, after collecting his thoughts, he answered.

 

“I don’t know son. I wish I did. It seems like the only time he leaves the house now is to go help that old woman down the street.”

 

“What old woman?”

 

“You know the one, she’s been here Jimmy’s whole life. A couple houses down.” My dad pointed down the street towards one of the older houses on the block. It had worn out, faded paint and an unkempt front yard.

“I don’t really remember her.”

 

“She seems to be the only thing that can get your brother out of his room. I don’t understand their relationship, but at least she gets him out of the house from time to time.”

 

I searched for a response but came up blank. We had never really been good at discussing problems as a family, certainly not ones that pertained to Jimmy. We have that good old fashioned Midwest family dynamic where we shove our problems deep down inside us and we don’t talk about them to anyone. Instead of expressing our emotions in a healthy manner we go hunting to blow off some steam, the poor ducks and bucks receive the brunt of our troubles.

 

The conversation left off there and we spent the rest of the night talking about easier topics. My mom joined us as we watched the sky turn from a pale blue into a muddled collage of light oranges and deep reds. The sun took it’s time sinking below the midsummer sky, allowing us to bask in the mosaic painting it created. We finished off our drinks as the last rays of color and light faded into the pale darkness of twilight.

 

My parents and I cleaned up the porch and went inside. It wasn’t long before they called it a night and I was left alone in the dark living room. I couldn’t sleep due to the time change from the Westcoast; the clock may have read 10 PM but my body was telling me it was only 7 PM. I turned on the standing lamp in the corner of the room so I could sit in the old armchair and read my book. That’s when I first heard the chanting.

 

The sound was faint, hardly discernable over the old window ac unit attempting to cool down the warm evening air. I almost didn’t notice it as first, but it was just loud enough to catch. The pulsating voices made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Slowly I got up from the chair, listening keenly as I tracked the noise.

 

I made my way upstairs, trying to avoid creaking the old wood that made up the steps, a task that was impossible. Upon reaching the landing of the second floor I could clearly discern the origin of the rhythmic chants. They were coming from the room directly in front of me, Jimmy’s room. The sounds were just quiet enough that my parents were sure not to hear it over the fan they had running in their room as they slept. I likely only heard them myself because I was sitting directly below the room they were being played in.

 

I quietly crept over to Jimmy’s door, putting my ear against it and listening closely. Now that I was so close to the source, I could clearly make out the swinging tempo of the haunting melody. The voices were foreign, maybe German, could’ve been Russian. An unsettling feeling came over me and the tones played on. I couldn’t say why but hearing it made my stomach knot up. It was as if my body was telling me this was something I shouldn’t have been listening to.

 

I moved at what felt like a sloth’s pace as I reached for the doorknob, cracking the door open as slowly and silently as I could, terrified of getting caught. Inside my brother’s room I finally saw the source of the music, if you could call it music. On a tv mounted against the far wall a video was being played. Unknown figures cloaked dark crimson robes stood stock-still, their heads bowed as they encircled a strange shrine. Towering over the worshipping crowd was a statue I had never seen before. It took the shape of a circle within a square within a triangle within another circle. My brother sat below the tv at his old desk, vehemently scribbling away at his notebook.

 

I was transfixed in confusion and fear. I watched for a moment longer before I lost my nerve and closed the door. I made my way back downstairs quietly, trying not to disturb the now eerie silence of the old house. I went outside where the air was still warm and muggy despite the sun being gone from the sky. A slight breeze flowed through the moonlit street like a stream of water through a mountain valley.

 

Leaning against the rail, I pulled my pack of cigarettes from my pocket and lit one. As I smoked, I tried to rationalize what I had seen. My best guess was that my brother had been watching a very strange video as a form of motivation for his art, this was the easiest idea for me to stomach at the time.

 

The week that followed was no less strange then my first night had been. My brother carried with him an aura of mysteriousness as he moved through the house. I distinctly remember being more uncomfortable around him throughout those 7 days than I had been in sometime. Every night as I tried to sleep, I heard strange noises from his room. It wasn’t always chanting, some nights it was as if he was building something in his room. There would be the sound of scraping, as if something heavy was being dragged across the wooden floor, followed by quiet banging. Despite my attempts at ignoring the quiet chaos coming from my brother’s room, it was a long week with little rest.

 

Sunday came and I was back at the airport. I said goodbye to my parents and flew to Oregon. Back in the rat race of adult life, I quickly forgot about the strange happenings back home. I went about my business, going to work, going on countless failed tinder dates, hanging out with my buddies staying out far too late, drinking far too much. Summer came and went. The onset of autumn was ushered in by the trees turning beautiful shades of orange and red. Scattered amongst the darkness of the evergreen pines and firs the PNW is most known for, you could see splotches of vibrant color. I was back in school for another year and continued to put my family life on the back burner, until I got the call from my mom.

 

My brother had died, he killed himself.

 

I’ll save you the gory details, how he did it is not the point of this story. The suicide isn’t what confused me, as sad as it was that my brother had ended his own life, looking back on the little time he did have I could understand why he did it. The location in which his body was found however, that didn’t make any sense to me.

 

He was discovered earlier that morning by a young woman from the neighborhood, she had been out for a morning run in the woods when she saw his body. By the time emergency services arrived he had long been dead, nothing could have been done for him.

 

I landed in Pittsburgh late; the sky was dark, and the air was cold. This time I rented a car of my own, I couldn’t muster up the nerve to ask my parents to pick me up given what they were dealing with. By the time I made it home it was well past midnight. The scene outside was somber, the house almost entirely dark and the neighborhood deathly quiet. Somewhere across the street a twig snapped causing me to nearly jump out of my skin, I turned to find the source, but the dark street seemed abandoned in the cold light of the streetlamps. It took me a moment to catch my breath, turning back to the house I looked to the living room window. There was a warm orange glow emanating from behind the white lace curtains pulled tight against the glass.

 

I walked up the old, warped boards of the front porch and quietly unlocked the door. Inside, my dad was sitting upright on the couch nursing a glass of whiskey, my mother was asleep laying across his lap. The light was coming from the standing lamp behind the old armchair. I closed the door softly, causing my dad to turn. He looked tired. He silently nodded to me as I walked into the room, I went over to the old chair and sat down, desperately searching for something to say.

 

“I’m so sorry dad, is there anything you need from me right now?” It was weak, but it was all I could come up with.

 

My dad smiled kindly at me. “No, you being here with us is enough. Me and your mom are going to get some sleep now, there’s food and drinks in the fridge. We’ll see you in the morning.”

 

My dad gently shook mom awake; she groaned as she opened her eyes, slowly sitting up and stretching, she took a moment to acknowledge my presence in the room.

 

“Thank you for being here.” She said, smiling at me.

 

“Of course, mom, let me know if there is anything you need.” I wished I could say something worth saying, all I managed to conjure were halfhearted offers to help. Nothing could help them right now; nothing could help two parents with the loss of a child. A parent burying their child went against the laws of the universe, and nothing could correct it.

 

“Honey, we should get some rest now.” My dad said. Together they stood and stumbled their way upstairs, leaving me alone in the glow of the lamp light.

 

The house felt quiet and still, almost empty, as though a piece of it were missing. I suppose in a way, that was true. Tonight, there would be no chanting.          

 

CHAPTER TWO

 

I awoke with a start, my heart racing from a bad dream, the content of which had already begun disappearing from my mind like a thin layer of fog with the first rays of sun. I didn’t know where I was, my internal clock was still on west coast time, and I had barely slept for four hours. I groggily sat up on the couch where I had fallen asleep. The lamp in the corner was still on although it was now being overpowered by the harsh sunlight coming through the window. I checked the time on my phone, it was 8:30 AM.

 

My body ached and I soon came to regret not making the short trek upstairs to my old bed before I had fallen asleep. I cracked my back and stretched the best I could as I stood up and stumbled my way into the kitchen. My hands worked independent from my tired mind; muscle memory built from many early mornings going to school after a long shift the night prior. I quickly started a pot of coffee for my parents.



Grabbing my travel bag from the floor, I made my way upstairs. I took my time in the shower, washing off the previous day’s travel. I always felt particularly gross after sitting in an airplane for a prolonged period of time. After a long, hot shower, I put on fresh clothes and made my way downstairs. My parents were sitting at the table together drinking coffee.

 

“Thank you for making a pot.” My mom said smiling feebly at me.

 

“Of course, would you guys like some breakfast too? I can cook something up for you guys.” I responded.

 

“That’s ok, everyone seems to think the solution to your son dying to suicide is to make you casseroles and quiches, we have plenty of food.” My dad replied, in a different time it may have come across as a joke, but there was no humor in him now as he said it.

 

“Ok. Do you guys need my help with anything today?” I asked. My mom looked at my dad waiting for him to answer for the pair of them. He took another sip of coffee before speaking.

 

“Well, someone has to go pick up Jimmy’s ashes. We’ve decided to just do a memorial for him. I don’t think he’d want a proper funeral.” My dad said.

 

“I can go pick them up, just send me the address.” I replied.

 

“Thank you.”

 

I sat down at the table with them, we spent the rest of the morning silently eating quiche that one of the neighbors had brought over. After breakfast, I did the dishes then left to drive to the funeral home in town.

The funeral home was beautiful, an old gothic building with four large pillars in the front, two on either side of the entrance. There was white siding with black trim and big stained-glass windows on either side of the dark mahogany door.

 

As I walked up the path from the road, I was able to make out the scenes imprinted on the windows. The left window contained depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus, his body hanging solemnly on the cross, contrasted by a deep red background. The window on the right depicted his resurrection. He was standing outside of his tomb, hands outstretched towards the sky, surrounded by his followers, this scene was laid on a bright blue background.

 

The second window felt out of place to me, none of the bodies here will ever get a second chance the way Jesus did. No matter how much good they did in life or what god they worshiped, this funeral home was their final stop before being laid to rest. Death was the ultimate equalizer.

 

I walked into the building, finding myself in a reception area. There were cheap metal chairs set against both the left and right walls and a large desk directly in front of the entrance about 15 feet from the door. I wondered how often people sat in these chairs, waiting to collect the remains of their lost loved ones. The room smelled of lavender and formaldehyde, a strange combination that made me uneasy. The air fresheners were working overtime, but they still could not overcome the smell of death and preservation of the corpses. Must be a hard job working there.

 

On top of the white desk was a shiny gold bell with a sign under it that read *Ring for Service*, I walked up and struck it, causing it to omit a high pitched, *Ding!* The sound reverberated strangely through the cold, empty halls. A few minutes went by without answer, I was about to ring again when I heard shuffling coming up the hallway towards me.

 

A door opened down the hall and an old man stepped out. He wore grey slacks and suspenders that went over a white collared shirt. He had stark white hair, much brighter than the shirt he wore, and piercing blue eyes that were veiled by silver rimmed glasses. He moved gracefully despite his aged appearance.

 

“Hello sir, how may I help you?” He asked as he reached the desk. He smiled at me, but it was void of any warmth. I found it hard to blame a man that worked with dead bodies for a living for lacking real emotion.

 

“I’m here to pick up my brother’s ashes. Jimmy Reynolds.”

 

“Ah yes, Mr. Reynolds. Well now I will just need to see some ID and I have a form for you to fill out while I run back and get the urn for you.”

 

“Here’s my license.” After studying my ID for a moment, he gave it back and handed me a clipboard with a form and a pen. Without a further word he turned and left down the hallway, going through a door into a hidden room. I stayed and filled out the form.

 

Within two minutes the man was back with a silver urn in his hands, he set it on the desk, and I handed him the clipboard. He read through it, ensuring I had answered everything correctly before putting it down and smiling his cold smile at me again.

 

“Very good sir, how will you be paying today?”

 

“Credit.” I replied. It hadn’t even crossed my mind that I would have to pay anything, I guess everyone had to make their way in this world. He pulled out a card reader and I tapped without even looking at the price, that would be a problem for another day.

 

“Ok, you are all set.”

 

“Thank you.” I picked up my brothers remains and began walking towards the door.

 

“Oh and Mr. Reynolds.” I turned, my hand on the doorknob, he was still smiling creepily. “We here at Wellers Family Funeral Home are very sorry for your loss.”

 

“Thank you, Mr. Weller. Have a nice day.” With that I turned and left. What a weird fucking guy he was I thought to myself as I got back in my car.

 

I placed my brother’s urn in the passenger seat and put the seatbelt over it for safety. I was overcome with a strange mix of emotions as I drove home with his ashes. I felt sadness, guilt, and a strange feeling of relief. Maybe this act had spared him from the cruel world he never could manage to find his place in, I would never know truly how he felt in those last few moments. Really, I would never truly know how he felt his entire life. I find it best not to judge the dead.

 

CHAPTER THREE

 

The memorial that night was weird. Jimmy never had any friends so everyone that came was a friend of my parents, they all muddled about in an awkward silence, offering their halfhearted condolences to my mom and dad, who sat in the living room looking up at the mantel where we had placed the urn beside a picture of Jimmy. He wasn’t smiling in the picture; I don’t remember a time I ever did see him smile.

 

After about an hour of watching uncomfortable people making small talk with each other in my parents’ small living room, I decided to get some air. I went outside, lit up a cigarette and just started walking. I walked through the deserted streets in a trance like state, silently smoking alone, unconscious of where I was going.

I “awoke” to find myself in the dark woods. The towering trees on either side of me seemed to be consuming all the ambient light and sound. It felt like I had stepped into another world, a desolate world where there was little hope to be found. It made me sad to think this is the last world my brother had experienced.

 

I had no intention of going to the spot where my brother had taken his life, but here I was. The site was easy enough to find, the caution tape was still up. I found that strange, but I figured the police force was small, maybe they just hadn’t gotten around to cleaning up the scene yet. Maybe they had forgotten about my brother all together at this point. Regardless, I ducked under the tape to investigate.

 

I had no clue what I thought I was looking for, but I felt sure I would know it when I found it. I used my phone as a flashlight so I could see the ground in front of me. There were no signs of a struggle from what I could tell, just a normal forest floor, then I saw it.

 

Thin lines carved into the hard dirt floor. Thin enough to barely be visible but they were deep, it seemed as though someone had taken a fixed blade knife and carved them. I had to clear a few leaves from the area before I could fully make out the symbol, but I knew I was looking at the exact spot where my brother had passed away. It was the same symbol that had been on Jimmy’s tv that night I snuck a peek into his room. I still had no idea what it meant, but I took a picture this time so I could look it up later.

 

I had seen enough, coming to my senses, I hurried out of the forest back towards civilization. From down the street I could see my parents’ driveway had emptied. I guessed that during my foray into the woods all the guests had grown tired and decided to go home. I didn’t blame them.

 

The street was dark on the cold moonless night, lit only by the sparse streetlamps that were scattered every few blocks along the sidewalks. The only sound to be heard was the rustling of dead leaves being blown across the ground by the chilly autumn wind. It was at this point I wished I had brought a coat.

 

I had almost reached my parents’ house when a flash of light off to my left side captured my attention. In the upstairs window of a neighbor’s house, I saw an old woman. In the darkness it took me a moment to realize what she was doing. She was staring at me, unmoving, unblinking. Watching me. Not knowing what to do, I gave her a polite wave before turning and going back to the safety of my parents’ house. As I walked away, the hair on the back of my neck stood up, I knew she was still watching me.

 

I spent a long, restless night in bed. My mind raced with questions. Who was the old lady? What was the symbol I keep seeing? Why had my brother taken his own life? I had a feeling that something was going on beneath the surface on the past week’s bizarre events, something more sinister than the simple suicide of a lonely kid.

 

It was around 3 AM that I gave up on the notion of sleep and decided to do some research. According to my deep dive on the internet the symbol depicted the philosopher’s stone. The stone has the power to create an elixir of life and turn metal into gold. Old alchemists sought to create this stone, they believed it was possible, if only they could discover the recipe. Obviously, no one was ever successful in creating it, but there are still believers, people that think it can be done. I was under the impression that was just made up by JK Rowling.

 

The sun rose slowly outside of my window, illuminating my room with the bright light of a new day. After my research I had managed to doze off for a couple hours, my body still ached from exhaustion, but my mind was running on overdrive, and I knew I would be afforded no more rest. My plan was to talk to the old lady, she had to know something.

 

I left the house without any food or coffee and made a B line straight down the street. The yard looked as though it hadn’t had any upkeep for some time, the grass had grown tall and unkempt, aside from the landscaping it looked like any other old single-family home. The siding was a faded dark green with black trim. The windows were all covered with black curtains, making it impossible to see through them. There was a large plant spreading vines over the left side of the structure. I quickly made my way up the steps, not wanting to pause, fearing I would lose my nerve if I gave myself a moment of reflection. My knock was answered quickly, too quickly, as if she had been expecting my arrival.

 

“Hello?” The old woman said as she opened the door and peered out at me. She had a croaky old voice, the type that makes someone sound as if they had spent their whole life smoking and screaming at the top of their lungs. I couldn’t place her age, but she had to at least be in her 80’s.

 

“Hi ma’am, sorry to bother you so early. I'm Jimmy’s brother, from down the street. I’m sure you heard what happened to him. I was hoping to come in and talk to you if you have a moment.”

 

The woman took a moment to think about my proposition, she looked past me towards my house, then back to me. “I just put a kettle on.” She said as she turned and walked into the house. She didn’t explicitly invite me in, but she had left the door open, I took this as a sign and followed. The coat closet was immediately on my right, I was in the living room, ahead of me on the right side there was a staircase leading up. A wall separated the downstairs floor into two, from the sound coming from the other room I guessed it was the kitchen.

 

Everything was dark wood, the drapes on the windows were a black lace. There was a large Victorian couch covered in deep red fabric that looked like blood. Old furniture and plants dominated most of the floor space, it looked like a post-apocalyptic scene where nature had crept back into man-made buildings to take over once again. The room may as well have been a forest.          

The woman had many large bookcases lining the walls all filled with leatherbound copies of strange books. Some in languages I couldn’t read or recognize. They had titles such as “Modern Day Magic” and “Conversations with the Dead”. Horror books? Informational texts?

 

I cautiously made my way into the living room and sat on the couch. The woman came in from the kitchen and sat across from me on an old black rocking chair, between us was a small wooden coffee table.

 

“So, what do you want?” The woman spoke while leaning back in her chair. She sounded impatient, not necessarily upset, but I got the feeling she wanted me out of her house. She pulled a pack of cigarettes off the coffee table and lit one up. She burned a hole through me with her gaze as she smoked.

 

“How long have you lived here?” I asked.

 

The woman pondered the question a moment, taking a hit of her cigarette as she scoured her mind for an answer. “Must be 19 years now.”

 

“How long did you know my brother?”

 

“In a sense, forever.” Her face seemed devoid of any emotion.

 

“What do you mean?” I’m sure I wore my confusion openly as I spoke, my question caused a smile to flash across the woman’s face, although it was gone as quick as it had come.

 

“In the sense that I moved in just after he was born. I may not be the most sociable woman, but I do know what happens in my neighborhood. If you’re curious as to how long he had been helping me, only for the last few years.”

 

“What kinds of things did he help you with?”

 

“Oh, just stuff around the house. I don’t get around as well as I used to. He would help me clean, do the yard work, things of that nature. He was a very nice boy.”

 

“When is the last time you saw him?” She was about to answer when the kettle on the stove went off.



“The tea is ready; do you take cream and sugar?” She said getting up slowly out of her chair. She was already shambling her way to the kitchen before I responded.

 

“Just sugar is fine, thank you.” In her absence I started to really take in the room around me. It was strange, shelves filled with weird books and trinkets the woman had procured throughout her life, the whole place seemed to be shrouded in a dark undertone, as if the natural light of the sun couldn’t infiltrate the black lace that covered the windows. It gave me the chills; it did not feel like a home. The thick foliage of plants around me made it oddly humid, I began to feel claustrophobic.

 

“It is a shame what happened to your brother.” I jumped; the old woman stood in front of me with a tray in her hands. She moved surprisingly quiet for a woman of her age. “His life was much too short. I supposed one cannot expect to live forever can we. That is until someone discovers the secret to everlasting life of course.” She stared at me, a cold unwavering stare, as she set down the tray on the table between us. Slowly, she resumed her place in the chair across from me.

 

“Thank you, it’s been a hard time for my family.” I leaned forward and picked my cup of tea.

 

“It’s earl grey, I hope you like it.”

 

 I took a small sip of the tea.

 

“it’s very good thank you.” I smiled, she continued to stare blankly back at me. I had a strange sense about this woman. My stomach plunged as she stared at me, it felt as though I had been walking down the stairs in the darkness and missed a step.

 

“I’m sorry to have bothered you this morning”

 

“It’s ok, I don’t get many visitors. Always happy to see a fresh face.” She let out a breath and adjusted her gaze to the wall above my head, I felt relieved to finally be free of her harsh stare.

 

“Well, it was very nice talking to you, I better get going though I’m sure my parents need me. Thank you for the tea.” I set the cup down back on the tray and stood up.

 

“Goodbye now dear.” She did not waiver.

 

My gut was telling me she knew something, had the answers I was seeking. I was sure I could find something out if I could get a chance to look around her house.

 

 

CHAPTER FOUR

 

Patience was the name of the game. I sat on the porch watching, waiting, refusing to move in fear of losing the only chance I may get. It was 2:30 PM when the woman’s front door finally opened. She hobbled her way down the few stairs of her front porch, leaning heavily on the railing. Upon reaching the sidewalk she turned right and began walking, moving much easier on flat ground. I continued to watch until she had turned the corner of the block.

 

I estimated her pace would give me at least 20 minutes before she completed a lap all the way around. Once I was sure she was out of sight I got up and quickly made my way across the street. I snuck up on to the porch and tried the front door, it opened.

 

I started in the living room, quickly scanning the bookshelves, looking for something to grab my attention. The items and books displayed on the shelves were odd but nothing in the room jumped out at me. For the sake of time, I decided to continue moving.

 

There was nothing more to be seen downstairs. The kitchen offered only cast-iron pans and old recipe books scattered around the counter and stove top. There was a large tea kettle sitting on a cork hot pad near the sink. After a quick scan I turned and made my way up the stairs.

 

The master bedroom did not look like it had anything of interest, just an old four-poster bed and a large dresser. The second bedroom I found to be full of old cardboard boxes, the dust suggested they had been there some time. The third room had more bookshelves and a large desk, I decided this was the place to start.



The bookshelves offered nothing once more, aside from the assortment of strange old texts and animal bones. I turned to the desk; it was a large dark wood construction with three drawers on either side of a cutout meant for an office chair. Most of the drawers were filled with a random assortment of supplies you would expect in a desk. Papers, notebooks, pens and pencils. I had almost given up hope when I slid open the bottom right drawer.

 

The space inside contained a folded garment, it was made from a heavy, deep crimson material. Taking it out revealed a robe much like the ones I had seen on my brothers tv. I stared in awe, my gut feeling seemed to be panning out. Snapping to, I put the robe aside and looked back to the drawer. There was a yellowed piece of paper sitting at the bottom. Large cursive letters were scribbled across it.

 

The brother born to the heartless will uncover the key.

 

Time was up, I knew the woman would be back anytime. I folded the robe and returned it to its spot. Gently, I folded up the paper and made my way downstairs. I had almost made it to the front door when I heard someone shuffling on the porch. Thinking on my feet, I spun around and went out of the sliding glass door in the back of the kitchen. I heard the front door shut just as I hit the grass outside.

 

With my heart pounding, I leapt over the fence and hurried back across the street. I didn’t stop moving until I was in the relative safety of my bedroom. Sitting in a chair in my old room, I read the paper I had stolen, trying to make any sense of it.



Born to the heartless. At first, I took it to mean heartless parents, but it said brother born to the heartless. Was the newborn heartless, or the brother? It took me too long for me to put it together. Looking back, it makes sense, brother born to the heartless.

 

I was so young when my brother was born, and my parents never liked to talk about what had happened. I had all but forgotten about my other brother, the stillborn child, born without a heart. Jimmy. Jimmy was the answer, it had to be. But what key did he uncover?

 

I was in search of a key, or at least that’s what I thought I was looking for. Regardless I found myself in my dead brother’s room, rummaging through all his earthly belongings. I found plenty of horror books and disturbing drawings but there was not a key in sight. I searched through every drawer and combed every shelf in the room. All I had left was the closet.

 

It was on the floor, you couldn’t see it when the clothes were in the way, but when you pushed everything to the side it was right there, as if on display. A rudimentary statue, clearly homemade. There, sitting on the floor of my brother’s closet, was his very own shrine to the Philosopher’s Stone.

 

There was wax all around the base of it where ceremonial candles had been burned down. There were also offerings, a few coins scattered in front of the wooden figure. There were bones, small ones, from a rat I presumed.



I knew my brother was different, I knew he had problems, but I honestly don’t know what to make of everything I have discovered. I sat on the floor, staring at the shrine, trying to formulate some idea of what was going on. I turned my head, another attempt of scanning the room for clues. From my new vantage point on the floor, I could see a composition book sitting underneath the bed. I crawled over and fished it out, my brother’s name was written on the front in sharpie.

 

This all brings us to now. My parents left a while ago, my dad’s attempt to get my mom out of the house and reinstate some semblance of normalcy in her life. I’ve been alone in my room, reading my brother’s notes. There is a lot in the notebook that I don’t understand, a lot of references to lost gods and old schools of thought, but after many hours of reading I think I’ve managed to piece together the story.



The Children of the Sun. That’s what they call themselves. It is a group of believers; they think the Philosopher’s Stone is more than an ancient myth and they are set on bringing it to fruition. Apparently, it began centuries ago in South America, but a sect of followers came up north during the early colonization of Pennsylvania in search of religious freedom. They worship a sun god named Huītzilōpōchtli. I looked him up and he seems to be a deity of Aztec origin. The deity of the sun and sacrifice.

 

The cult, that’s really what they are, believes that by sacrificing the right person to this god they can obtain the secret ingredient to manifest the Philosopher’s Stone. They believe it is the blood of a prophesized sacrifice. My brother. Ancient cult scripture states that the chosen one will be born a twin to a brother with no heart.

 

My brother’s writing creates a clear picture of a lost kid who got taken advantage of by an evil, manipulative person. Him and the old woman talked more than she led on, that’s where most of this information seems to be coming from. My brother wrote that she moved to the neighborhood shortly after he was born, after she heard about the circumstances of his birth. I guess they were planning it for some time. There are entries in his journal going back years.

 

I almost feel as though my brother left this for someone to find, he wrote it in a way that makes me feel he wanted this story to be told. That’s partly why I wrote this, to share what he had to say. I also wrote it because this may be the last time I get to share my story.

 

It is dark now, the sun set some time ago. My parents haven’t returned, their car isn’t in the driveway. I am all alone in the dark house, I have the paper I took from the woman on my desk. I figured she’d find out I took it eventually. I don’t know if I’ll get a chance to update this, but at least someone will know the truth of what has happened here.

 

The house is silent, but I can hear the faint creaking of the old stairs.
