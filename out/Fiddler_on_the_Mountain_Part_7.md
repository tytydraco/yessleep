**Chapter 7: Escapism**

There are three types of men who become priests. The first are those searching for power. Second are men whom truly believe. Lastly there are the men who are running away. Father Alexander Gomez was the latter. On the morning of 19 September 1937 the twenty six Gomez was now an orphan with his birth right a pile of smoldering ashes. According to medical records in Joe Murphy’s rejected initial report; Gomez had several slashes on his arm and legs with a mild case of smoke inhalation

A psychological assessment would later diagnose Alexander with dissociative amnesia and derealization disorder. Several times requesting to talk to his parents and friends he had witnessed die. Furthermore he would give several fantastical recollections of the events. The records of these interviews where kept confidential and ultimately destroyed in April 1938. Including an interview with Joe Murphy submitted to the provincial government

Under the supervision of state assigned psychologists and the approval of his last remaining relative Maeve Jefferson; Alexander Gomez was institutionalized for mental illness from 1938 to 1940. During this period he was held under observation at a Catholic ward known as St. Michael's. There Alex would slowly begin to rebuild himself as Father Gomez. Below are notes from his attending physician, James Hale

*“The Gomez boy arrived today. He appears to be extremely troubled. However there are moments of clarity were he comes to his senses. But these are often short and followed by episodes of depression. Fortunately his expenses will be covered by the state and a large inheritance from the estate of his late parents. We have the time and necessary resources to assist him”* ***James Hale notes June 3rd 1938***

*“I and Alex had a good session today. He abandoned the contradictory delusions that his parents are alive and that they were consumed by his late friend Peter O’Keefe. He has finally accepted what happened and we can start moving forward*\*\*\*” James Hale notes July 13th 1938\*\*\*\*”\*

*“Alex has taken to the bible. He keeps a copy of it on him at all times. While it is indicative of obsession, I’ve allowed it as he requires a new mechanism of self-identification. He lost his source of employment, family, support group and sense of self. The good book is a worthy alternative.*  *I will be requesting he starts assisting Father Comstock during Sunday service”* ***James Hale notes August 23th 1938***

*“Alex had a relapse today. However he showed symptoms of capgras delusion* *not dissociative amnesia. I was awoken in the middle of the night by the nurses to come to assist them restrain him. Alex was screaming and praying with a copy of the bible. He claimed that the Peter O’Keefe in the fire of 1937 was an impostor; a demon wearing the face of the man. When I tried to calm him down he screamed that the eyes are the windows of the soul. We sedated him and I have placed him under supervision until further notice” ”* ***James Hale notes November 19th 1938***

*“It’s been six weeks since Alex was put back into the general population. He appears to have stabilized and making improvements on all fronts. Father Comstock has asked for Alex to assist him again. While I am hesitant I will grant his request”* ***James Hale notes February 7th 1939***

*“Alex has had an amazing recovery and has begun studying under Father Comstock to become a man of the cloth. I have submitted the necessary requisitions to have him released. However he will continue to stay on the property as part of the church”* ***James Hale notes December 9th 1939***

*“….his symptoms remind me of Alexander Gomez. But it should be noted that Gomez was able to maintain some clarity.”* ***James Hale notes July 11th 1940 (stationed in the United Kingdom during WWII)***

During the war period Alexander Gomez would stay on at St. Michael's as the assistant parish priest. He would attend seminary school in Winnipeg. Graduating and being ordained in 1943. His sister Maeve, her husband Atticus Jefferson and their three children would be in attendance. The group would travel to Gare later that week to place flowers on empty graves. On this trip they would also finalize the sale of all known properties belonging to both the Byrne and Gomez families. Based on court records the two siblings received over two million for the Byrne farm, commercial land where Dionysus’ had been and their family home.The Jefferson family would depart and never be seen in Gare again. Father Gomez would sporadically visit between 1944 and 1959

*“I saw him (Alexander Gomez) a couple of time before he went to Africa. When I first heard he became a priest I was honestly shocked. Alex had always been a free spirit. He had traveled the country playing music at fifteen. Now he was Father Gomez! But guess that what happens when you experience stuff like that. You go crazy or you find God”* ***Samuel Phillips, interview from 1964 (Ariadne)***

*“I talked to him a couple of times. He would get this look on his face every time I mentioned Paul so I just stopped talking about them around him. Think the last time I saw him was in the late 50s or early 60s. He was out by the river taking to some indigenous people. I waved at him but he didn’t respond”* ***Elizabeth Palmer (Paul O’Keefe’s girlfriend before his death) interview from 1970 (Ariadne)***

In the fall of 1959 Father Gomez requested a transfer to a parish located in modern day eastern Zimbabwe; then called Southern Rhodesia. Normally such a posting was for priests that had committed an infraction or had a moral failing. By all accounts Father Gomez was loved by both his flock and superiors. Based on rumors at the time Bishop Comstock, Father Gomez’s mentor personally attempted to stop his transfer. However the higher authorities in Rome determined that it was not their place to stop a priest from following the word of God. In truth the church was having issues staffing remote parishes
