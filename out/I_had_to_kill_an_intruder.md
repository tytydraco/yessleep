I've personally never experienced anything as bone chilling and mind boggling as this  
and this is the first time I am ever talking about it. When I was 16 years old,  
during the summer I house sat for my Grandma. She was at hospital, and I was told by  
my parents it would only be a weekend - but my grandma can be in Hospital for weeks   
sometimes. my Grandma specifically asked for me to come over, she said she would let   
me use all of her twin sized bed and also something called her 'bedpan'  
I could use, I had appreciated her idea, but ultimately decided to set up camp in  
the guest bedroom for as long as it takes before I could go home. Seeing as it was  
early on a Friday, and I had been at school for the whole day, I had decided to try  
and invite a couple friends to my house, but none of them wanted to come over, or   
talk to me. it was safe to say i was tuckered out, and shortly after turning on my  
television and smoking a fat ass spliff, I drifted into a deep sleep on the sofa.  
  
I was jolted awake from my sleep by a strange noise.  
Slowly opening my eyes, I looked around me.  
I felt like someone was watching me, my eyes lasered around the room.  
I locked eye contact with someone peering through the window in-between the gap in the   
curtains and my heart begins to beat as loud as a drum.  
I try and make out the details of their face but they are completely shrouded  
in a thick mist of nights blackness.  
They start to slowly reach for the frame of the window, looking to descend  
into my sleeping quarters as I had foolishly left my window open.   
I sat up in my bed.  
I reached for the closest thing on my nightstand, A cup of dentures and ping it at  
the shape, sending the shadow of a figure into a hasty retreat. I was calm under   
the stress and felt no need to panic. Although I remembered locking the front door -  
I decided to check, just in case I didn't - as I was faded than a hoe.  
I got to the front door to see if it was locked, it was, just as I thought, my heart  
instantly slows, and I sigh a sigh of relief. Although under further  
investigation, looking through the peephole, I saw someone standing on the porch.  
I couldn't make much out of them as a person due to how faded I was, but I felt  
safe enough to keep my nerves calmed just enough for me to get back into bed,  
and I pursued to sleep.  
  
As I laid in bed - I held my breath for a moment or two - in the moment I wasn't   
breathing - I swore I could hear someone, a person outside my window, I perked my   
ears up and about thirty seconds later, I heard it again. This time I could make it  
out.  
'Let me in'   
I am frozen with fear, and I look towards the window, but the curtains are covering  
me from seeing whoever is saying this.  
I stop everything I was doing before and only listen.  
I don't need to hold my breath to hear mutterings anymore.  
Either my hearing is getting better, or who-ever is speaking, is nearing closer by the  
second.   
It was safe to say I was pretty unsettled, so I take a look behind my curtain.  
Instant waves of panic and dread cover my skin with chills and goosebumps.  
and my blood curdles into a cold spirit, and I was met face to face with  
someone attempting to pry open my bedroom window. Although they aren't   
succeeding, I am scared enough to make my way to the kitchen. Blissfully hoping  
I could wait out the rest of the night in there, peacefully.   
There aren't any windows looking into my grandma's kitchen except from a glazed one beside the front door, and I could see  
them looking into the house at me. Knocking on the front door.  
It frightened me so much to the point I had began mulling over, and assembling a plan to escape the horror.   
Rain began to pour outside.  
I realised at that point I needed to call the police, and I ran to my bedroom for my phone.  
I dialed 911, and the incessant banging and moaning at the door is unbearable and inescapable, paired with the dreary horridness of my blazing, my mind is veiled with fog.  
I crawled to the kitchen, as to avoid being seen by this unlawful intruder.   
Clambering up onto the counter top, I was put on hold by the police line, for 5 minutes I waited, until I realised there was no use.  
I hang up on them after saying my address and  
that someone was trying to kill me, even if they don't come, it doesn't matter.  
I took matters into my own hands.  
  
I stand up. I unsheathed a knife from the knife stand, in a last ditch effort for my life,   
and I grew the balls to walk my ass to the door, not crawl. keeping in line of sight of   
the door.  
I could make out a faint -  
  
"Let me in, let me in, let me in"  
  
I swung the door open and thrust my blade wildly into the figure of the night -  
a swift fleet of attacks and an expression of shrieks and a pathetic 'flump' as  
this measly intruder's frail body hit the floor rung into the nights thin air.  
  
I watched as the intruder writhed in agony on the floor bleeding out from lacerations,  
they actively gushed and pumped blood from their cut skin,  
open stab wounds oozed crimson blood from pink flesh, and i could see corners of raw intestine beginning to simply slide from the slices I had delivered.  
I vomited with adrenaline and proceeded to stomp on their head until satisfied.    
this intruder is a 'she', and this 'she' was dressed in a hospital gown and had the   
clothes of my grandma in a clear plastic bag, along with a hospital wristband with her  
name on it, whoever this was, she knew my grandma was living here, and was at the   
hospital. This crazy stalker must have known what they were doing, and knew to imitate my own grandmother before coming to the house.  
  
the dark contorting lump of bleeding mess on floor gargled - 'Why? - splurt of blood  
 drips from face - Why me? Why Grandma? Please.'  
  
and I couldn't help but get on one knee, pull her by her hair off the floor, and scoff in her contorted and contusioned face, at her failed attempt to fool me. 'The grandma stunt,   
oldest trick in the book honestly, so pitiful.'  
  
Without a single second thought, I finished her off execution style where she lay.   
and I awaited patiently for the police to come and award me with a Medal of Honour.
