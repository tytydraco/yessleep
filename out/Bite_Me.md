I never wanted this life.  


  
Since birth, my life has been a struggle. Rough family, no money. No wonder I’d slipped out the door one evening and hadn’t looked back.   


  
Still, I never wanted to be a drug dealer. When you say it out loud it sounds awful. I was trying to make a better life for myself- not a shittier one. But the world is big and cruel to a teenage girl who is essentially homeless. I was tired of going hungry, and besides, the cash was easy. Much easier than I was expecting, especially when I teamed up with Megan.  


  
Megan was the real expert. The cute, chatty one who could wiggle her way into and out of any situation, and hustle anyone from horny spring breakers to boomer retirees. She’d had an even worse childhood than me and I knew she wasn’t going back. At least we had that in common.  


  
For several months we’d been up and down the gulf coast, couchsurfing and selling small amounts of weed and MDMA from our backpacks.   


  
I never intended to stay this long in Florida- but somehow, we always made enough to get by. I secretly dreamed of making enough money to stay here and make a home.  


  
“Let’s go in here,” Megan said, leading me into a dingy surf shop. She was always hunting for our next score.  


  
The inside air was stuffy and humid. A fan roared in the corner. The store was filled with worthless souvenirs and overpriced flip flops. I browsed the racks of cheap, imported clothing while she drifted towards the cashier.  


  
I watched as she leaned over the counter, pushing her chest forward and batting her eyes. “Hey honey,” she said, “what’s up?”  


  
I smirked as I flipped through T- shirts emblazoned with “I Love Florida” and graphics of dolphins. Megan knew how to hook them.  


  
Still, I didn’t really like the look of the guy behind the counter. Usually we went for tourists, naive and flush with cash. This guy was different. A local. His long dark hair was dirty, and a shark tooth dangled from his neck. He leaned in close to Megan and wrote something on the back of a receipt.  
 

  
I drifted closer. Megan giggled loudly. Up close, I could see he *was* sort of handsome, with a sharp cut face and dark eyes. The name tag on his uniform said “Vinny.”   


  
For whatever reason, Vinny was not giving me a good vibe. He felt dangerous. I silently wished for a crop of idiotic fraternity boys, half drunk and easy to swindle, but spring break was long over.  


  
Megan wrapped up and headed for the door. I followed, with a backwards glance at Vinny. He watched us as we slipped out into the salty air.  


  
The scorching afternoon heat had finally faded to warm dusk. The air felt like a humid bath, but I was glad to be out of the shop.   


  
Neon lights illuminated the rundown hotels and souvenir stores of the strip. The area had been built up in the 70s, but now it just looked weathered and cheap.  


  
“Any leads?” I asked.  


  
“Yeah. Big party later.” I nodded. Parties were our bread and butter, with typically lots of sales in a single stop. “He’ll let us crash at his place.” I rolled my eyes. Of course he would.  


  
"Did you get the address?"  


  
"Yeah." She passed her a crumpled sheet of paper. "It's close."  


  
We walked along the side of the highway, past the dated motels and restaurants until the strip petered out into nothing, and then we crossed a bridge before turning inland. By now, it was full dark. Insects roared in the brush and mosquitos nibbled on my legs, while the sharp grass cut my ankles.  


  
Finally, we arrived at our destination: Sunset Mobile Home Park.   


  
The weathered trailers had seen better days, and from what I could see the residents didn’t look much better.   


  
“Are you sure about this?” I hissed under my breath.   


  
“Of course,” She murmured. “Just relax, Vinny will be here soon.”  


  
The “party” was already in full swing. It was a tough, older crowd that seemed like family, from the grizzled grandma in her bathrobe to the leathered, middle- aged daughter in a bikini top and cutoffs. A cigarette dangled from her lip as she talked loudly to a man in biker gear. An old radio blasted country hits from a nearby porch.  


  
I felt like an outsider butting in.   


  
I knew this kind of people. They were exactly what I was running from back in Alabama. Still, I set my face with a smile and mirrored Megan’s bright and bubbly persona. This was a part of the job.  


  
Before I knew it, Megan had charmed her way into the arms of several men twice her age, and we had both pounded a few shots of Fireball. I felt spinny immediately, and the voices kept getting louder.   


  
Once the group accepted us I made several quick sales, and I grudgingly admitted that Megan had made a good call on this one.  


  
We had been there over an hour and there was still no sign of Vinny.  


  
I sat on a step while Megan worked the crowd. The shots had left me unbalanced and made my head spin. Still, I tipped another back. In for a penny, in for a pound.  


  
I scanned the group for Megan. She could take care of herself, but we liked to keep tabs on each other. She was perched on the lap of one of the biker guys, her back to me. Something about her posture seemed off. I squinted and tried to focus my gaze.  


  
The biker pushed Megan to the side. The front of her shirt was drenched in blood, and her eyes were glassy.   


  
He hadn’t been kissing her. He’d been draining her.

&#x200B;

Megan was fucking *dead.*  


  
My heart pounded wildly in my chest. I *knew* this place was a bad idea. I struggled to my feet as the group clustered around her, flocking to the fresh kill.  


  
I cursed the whiskey, which made me wobbly. My head throbbed. I wondered if Fireball had been the only thing in that cup as I struggled to put one foot in front of the other.  


  
I glanced back to see the grandma tear a glob of dripping flesh from Megan’s corpse.  


  
Suddenly, rough hands grabbed me and spun me around.  


  
Vinny.  


  
“And where do you think you’re going?” he murmured softly.  


  
I tried to twist out of his grip but my movements felt weak and sluggish. I was sweating and I felt dizzier than ever. He laughed, revealing long pointed canines.   


  
He was handsome, my hazy brain decided, but the closeness of his body made me feel claustrophobic and trapped. I whimpered with fear.  


  
I could smell him- a blend of sweat and cologne and something *earthy* and the combination made me feel sick.  


  
But when I finally locked eyes with him it was all over. They were big and inky black, pupils swollen to an enormous size that completely engulfed me as soon as I looked into them.   


  
I don’t remember anything after that. There’s a completely blank spot in my memory.   


  
The next thing I *do* remember was an overpowering feeling of suffocation. My lungs tried to fill with air, but there was only a void. My limbs were completely frozen, weighted down by an incredibly thick blanket. I tossed my body in desperation. The blanket didn’t budge.  


  
Little by little, I thrashed harder, trying to free myself. Then I realized- it wasn’t a blanket.   


  
It was sand.  


  
I finally emerged from the gritty earth, fingernails bleeding and hair full of leaves. I took huge gulps of the humid night air, gasping like a fish.  


  
As my pulse slowed, I looked around. It was a hot fall night. Insects hummed loudly in the trees. My neck ached terribly, and was sore to the touch.  


  
I remember being painfully hungry. My stomach gurgled.  


  
I could see the orange glow of a cigarette smoldering in the shadows. A shape slowly emerged, and walked towards me. Vinny.  


  
He stood over me, observing his handiwork. Then he slowly extended his hand.  


  
“Welcome home,” he murmured.  


  
I didn’t ask for this life, and It wasn’t the home I envisioned for myself. But over time I settled right in at the Sunset Mobile Home Park. The other vampires aren’t so bad, and there's always a party going on.  


  
And with all the tourists around, I never went hungry [again](https://www.reddit.com/r/SunshineScarystories/comments/x88quz/story_index/).
