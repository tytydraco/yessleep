Wasn’t going to tell people about this until yesterday. But now I need to write this down before I lose my mind completely. I spent almost a year trying to convince myself I was paranoid. I’m being stalked by the perfect man. Yes, you read that right. I’m almost to the better half of this bottle, and the smoke of my cuban is beginning to gently paint the ceiling of this room. I’m trying to figure out the right words to say to you all so it makes even the slightest sense, but all I can do is reminisce. It's the soft crunch of the cheap leather I sit on, parked upon laminate floors. I reminisce about a time where life was a little simpler. Today is not a rainy day, nor gloomy; in fact, a beautiful sun pushes through the window. My eyes follow cars on the busy street below me; the constant sound of honking floods my ears. But still I sit here, thinking about the perfect man. Stalking me. If he stalks other people, it’s beyond me. Countless hours of forum browsing and dark, undusted corners of the internet yielding no answers to me now. The only thing I know is that his process of breaking you down begins with a dream. It doesn’t even seem like one; no strange segments or subliminal subconscious messages.. Things felt real. The soft egyptian thread underneath my lying body brushed up against me as if I was lying down. 

That night I got home from the bar with a few work buddies, and ended up falling asleep on the couch.  I blinked awake, disoriented, a chill prickling over my skin. A glance to my right, where the bedstand sat under a clock - it told me it was 3:34 in the morning. I stretched to my left, where my girlfriend was lying-

I gasped. My hand covered my mouth. I reached out, whispering her name, my voice breaking the silence. A wave of cold realization washed over me, and instinctively, I pulled back, forcing myself to stay silent. Her mouth hung open, blood dripping from her cheek and running down towards the navy bedsheet. The haunting visual of my dead girlfriend before me. A kitchen knife sticking out of the side of her face. She died peacefully, I told myself, she had to. But her mouth, open like that, looked like she screamed until her lungs collapsed and blood flooded her throat. I pulled my hand back, instinctively clenching it to my chest, fighting the urge to scream. Every instinct in my body told me to stay quiet, to get up slowly, deliberately, as if making too much noise would shatter whatever fragile calm was left. The bedroom felt like a trap, the air stifling, thick. The now lifeless body adjacent to me felt like a stone tomb. I slid to the floor in a corner, sobbing to myself.

I fumbled for my phone, my fingers cold and clumsy as I pressed in the emergency number, holding the phone to my ear and whispering our address to the dispatcher in the lowest voice I could manage. I managed to stand up, holding myself up against the wall, the weight of the scene before me almost too much to bear. I finally slipped into the hallway, swallowing hard to keep my breath steady. The soft creaks of the apartment seemed amplified in the dark, each step calculated, careful. The thin light filtering from the street outside cast faint shadows across the walls, stretching over the furniture, blurring the familiar shapes of our things.

The apartment was blanketed in shadows, everything cast in eerie, muted tones. In the living room, my gaze landed on the corner chair, and there it was—a figure, sitting in complete stillness. So still, it nearly vanished in the dark surrounding it. My gaze locked onto it, and dread tightened around my chest like a vice. In the corner, by the worn armchair, he sat. The faint outline of a man, barely discernible, but there. His skin held an otherworldly complexion, barely visible in the darkness. He sat calmly, his body leaning slightly forward, hands resting on his knees. Watching. Waiting.

Everything in me said to scream and run. But I couldn't. My body refused to obey; my legs felt like they were cemented to the floor. My phone was still clutched in my hand, but I couldn't bring myself to make a sound, couldn't bring myself to call out. He didn't move, didn't speak, just sat there, almost as if he were savoring the moment; like a predator playing with its prey. A chill swept through me, sharper than any cold night. It was like he was waiting for something. For me to make the next move. For me to show that I was still human. That maybe I was still alive. Slowly, I forced myself to inch back toward the hallway, my foot barely lifting from the floor as I crept backward. I could still feel him watching me, could feel his perfect, crystalline gaze boring into me with a quiet intensity. My heart pounded so loudly I half-expected it to give me away. Even behind the wall, I could feel the unbothered daggers his eyes shot at me. His silver-cut jaw barely pierced through the dense shadows surrounding him, its perfect angles catching what little light remained.

But I slipped further into the hallway, just enough to escape his line of sight, yet still close enough to feel the weight of his presence looming from the living room. The dispatcher's faint voice crackled again, and I pressed the phone to my ear, barely able to force the words from my throat. "Please," I whispered, my voice trembling, "someone is in my apartment. My girlfriend—she's...she's..." I choked on the words, unable to finish. The dispatcher's voice grew louder, more steady. They promised me help was on the way, urged me to stay on the line, but every second felt endless, stretching into an eternity as I crouched in the shadow of the hallway, my eyes locked on the faint glow of the living room. Step after step I trudged backward until the glow of the living room became a distant, foggy memory.

And then, as I waited, I heard it—the sound of soft, measured breathing. But it wasn't coming from me.

Just like that, I woke up. Remembering the feeling of his hot breath reaching my left shoulder blade. I still had half a beer in my hand “What the fuck?”. I ended up calling Rachel and made sure she was okay; and, to be honest, continued with my day as normally. The silent drone of never ending corporate life once again presented itself to me like a dull, rainy afternoon. 

Unfortunately my bottle has now run empty (not sure how that happened). I’m gonna run to the liquor store and add some more when I get back. 

\[Update\] The bottle is open. 

Anyway, like I said the following days after the nightmare were monotonous as usual. See Rachel, go to work, workout, whathaveyou. Like nothing ever happened. That changed, though. Just 2 weeks later:

It resumed what was mid-April, I was to meet Rachel for dinner that day. The first time I saw him. Really saw him. I still have scars in my veins from the heat of my boiling blood when it happened. I remember the drive to La Dolce Vita, our favorite restaurant. The kind of place with dark wood panels and soft lighting that makes everyone look a little more beautiful than they are. The warm glow of the vintage sconces made her eyes sparkle. Around that time, she started a new banking job, and since then my days of seeing her dwindled. But it was good money, so I didn’t want to complain about it. The monotonous drone of corporate life and living alone was starting to get to me around then. I wanted to move in with Rachel, but it just wasn’t going to work at the time. We’d talked about eventually doing it but the stars just hadn’t yet aligned. Anyway, I remember that despite the grueling traffic I actually got to the restaurant early; so I decided to grab a drink. 	I strut towards the rustic bar and receive a friendly nod from the bartender. A middle-aged man, well dressed, cleanly shaven. The red fabric of his vest ran vibrant in the brown color scheme of the bar. I sat down on the black & metal stool at the counter, making sure it spins around like the rest of them. It did, if you were wondering. 

“Evening, what’ll it be?” Asked the bartender. 	“Honestly, give me something a little lighter. What do you think?” I replied

He raised his eyebrows, and nodded to himself. I read his nametag, “Paul”, it said. Paul turns around and gets to work. I take a look at myself in the mirror behind the various liquor bottles seated on the shelf. I brush my hands through my hair and crack a slight smile, getting excited to see Rachel again, when my phone buzzed in my pocket. Funny, it was her calling.	“Hi Honey, traffic is pretty rough right now, I’m still gonna make it but might be a little bit late, just wanted to tell you.” She admitted.	“Alright, no big deal. I’ll see you soon, love you.”	“Love you too, bye.” The line clicked. 

Unfortunately with the place she and I lived, that was all too common. Oh well. The bartender approached my seat with a glass in hand. I thanked him. What sat in front of me now was a Gin & Tonic, not bad. When the first sip of the drink came down, I noticed a figure approaching on my left. It was another man, I raised my glass in his direction, & he replied with a polite smile. 

I felt almost compelled to look at him; as if a magnet pulled my energy in. Like a doll needing to look at the other toy being played with. He sat upright, his posture impossibly perfect, if there was an art form for sitting he’d mastered it to an unattainable degree. From his neck to his waist, he formed an unbroken line, as precise and deliberate as a ruler. He wore a suit of the deepest blue, a shade so rich it seemed to absorb the light around him, making everything else appear dull by comparison. *I am the dull*. The fabric clung to him as though it had been tailored by the hands of a master artisan who had known every contour of his frame. The sleeves ended precisely at his wrists, revealing strong, sinewy hands that were impossibly vascular, the tendons and veins a map of control and purpose.

In his right hand, he held an Old Fashioned, the amber liquid catching the dim light like molten gold. His grip was effortless but firm, the kind of hold that conveyed both elegance and strength. Upon that same hand rested an antique watch, a masterpiece of vintage craftsmanship, its metallic sheen complementing the suit as though they had been forged together in some divine workshop. The sight of it struck a chord in me, deep and visceral—a pang of jealousy I couldn’t suppress.

At the end of his long, slender legs were a pair of Italian leather shoes so polished they reflected the faint glow of the bar lights above. Each step he might have taken, I imagined, would echo with the sound of precision and authority. But he wasn’t moving. He didn’t need to. He simply existed, and that alone was enough to command the space around him. I had sat there, hunched over my stool with the defeated posture of someone who had long given up on exuding poise or confidence. My drink sat forgotten in front of me, the condensation pooling into a small, pathetic puddle. I couldn’t tear my eyes away from him, this stranger who had entered my world uninvited, a specter of unattainable perfection. I had never seen him before, and yet, in that moment, he consumed every ounce of my attention.

His face was maddeningly clean, his jawline razor-sharp and his cheeks smooth as marble. His hair was a vision of meticulous care, each strand in its rightful place, the fullness and texture so enviable it bordered cruelty. His skin was impossibly clear, glowing with an inner light that made him appear almost otherworldly. Every detail about him seemed engineered to mock me, to expose every flaw I carried within myself. I couldn’t understand why I was so consumed by him. I didn’t know him, didn’t even know his name, and yet every fiber of my being burned with resentment, envy, and bitterness toward this man who had done nothing but exist in my presence. His very existence was an affront, a reminder of everything I wasn’t, of everything I would never be.

His presence was overwhelming, like an invisible weight pressing down on my chest. He wasn’t The Devil, not in appearance—no horns, no red eyes, no malicious grin—but in that moment, he may as well have been. He was my Devil, a tormentor born of my own insecurities and self-loathing. I hated him with a ferocity that frightened me, hated him for the way he so effortlessly demanded attention, for the way he made me feel small and insignificant without even trying.And yet, as I sat there seething, unable to look away, a small, shameful part of me wished I could be him, wished I could trade places, even if just for a moment. But I couldn’t. All I could do was sit there, drowning in my own bitterness, unable to handle the sheer intensity of his presence.



“You alright, man?” His voice cut through my spiraling thoughts like a knife through fog. The question was casual, informal, and yet it startled me more than I care to admit.

The thoughts stopped.

I stared at him, momentarily dumbfounded, watching his lips travel up and downwards as he spoke. The smooth upward curve and tilt of his mouth seemed exaggerated in my distraction. It took me longer than it should have to register what he had said, as though his words had traveled through a thick layer of static before reaching me. I jerked my upper body back slightly, snapping myself out of my trance. “Oh, yes,” I stammered, my voice slightly higher than I intended. I straightened in my seat as if that might have made me seem more composed. “Sorry, I zoned out there for a second.”

His lips twitched upward into the faintest chuckle, a sound that felt as effortless as everything else about him. “It happens,” he said lightly, the corner of his mouth tugging into a smile before his attention drifted away from me entirely. His eyes dropped to his watch, the subtle movement carrying an air of dismissal. That small gesture, the glance at his watch, reminded me to check my own. I raised my arm, the watch on my wrist not nearly as striking or expensive as his, but functional nonetheless. It was time. My table should be ready now.

I stood from the stool with a suddenness that felt clumsy compared to his grace, but he didn’t look back at me. He was already somewhere else in his mind, his focus far from my awkward movements or my presence entirely. I approached the hostess stand, the tap of my shoes on the polished floor barely audible over the quiet murmur of the room. She looked up at me, raising her eyebrows in acknowledgment. “Charlie? We have your table right over here.”

“Perfect, thank you,” I replied, my voice steadier now, though I could still feel a faint residue of the encounter lingering in my chest. She led me to the table, a small, neatly arranged square draped with a crisp white cloth. A golden candle—a cheap, fake one—sat at its center, flickering artificially in the dim light. The table was adjacent to the bar, giving me a clear view of where I had just been sitting. As I slid into my seat, the front door of the restaurant creaked open. My eyes instinctively darted toward it. Rachel stepped in.

Everything else—the man at the bar, my bitter thoughts, the fleeting envy—faded into nothingness. All the tension that had coiled inside me like a spring released in an instant. It didn’t matter anymore. Rachel was here, and with her came the calm I hadn’t even realized I’d been craving.

She hadn’t noticed me yet, but I saw her immediately. She carried herself with the same quiet confidence she always did, her movements unhurried, her gaze sweeping the room. She wore a faint smile, one I knew wasn’t for anyone in the restaurant but me. I gave her the same look I’d given her since the first day we met—a mix of admiration, awe, and disbelief that someone like her had even entered my life. She sat before me, placing her patterned, purple purse on the floor to her left, next to the wall. Purple was Rachel’s favorite color. 

It’d been at least a minute now, and not one word was spoken between the two of us, just admiring each other for a moment. I broke. 

“So, how is work treating you? Working that big bank life now! Haha!” I asked playfully.

“Well,” She began proudly. “They definitely keep me fed. Not really a dull moment so far, besides the meetings. But.. I digress. I like it, I really do. It’s much better than what we had before. The money no doubt”.

“I bet.” I was so happy for Rachel. She’s right, though. I made decent money, but this was a huge upgrade from what either of us had ever been familiar with.  We eventually ordered, and caught up with each other. While it wasn’t long distance, we’d only be able to visit every couple of days or so- It’s just how things worked out, to be honest. The eventual goal is to live together but for now it’s just not possible like I said. 

I got the seafood, her pasta dish. Too much pepper for me, though I don’t want to bother the waitress so I dealt with it. Rachel pushed her plate away with a satisfied sigh. That's when I noticed him again, this time through the window behind her. He was simply standing there on the sidewalk, that same perfect posture, that same immaculate suit. Just... existing. I remembered the dream then—Rachel's body, the knife, his presence in my living room. When I looked again, he was gone.

"Charlie? Everything alright?" Rachel asked, noticing my distraction.

"Yeah, just zoned out for a second," I said, managing a smile. I couldn't tell her about him. How do you explain to someone that you're being stalked by perfection itself?

We finished dinner, said our goodbyes in the parking lot, and went our separate ways. That was three days ago. Since then, I've started noticing him more often, but never in a threatening way. He's just... there. Standing in a crowd at the coffee shop. Sitting in a parked car as I walk to work. Always pristine, always watching, but never approaching.

The bottle's getting low now, and my cigar's long since burned out. Writing this down has helped, somehow. Made it feel more real, more manageable. I'm not sure what he wants or why he chose me. The dreams haven't stopped, but they're different now. Less violent, more... observational. Like he's studying me, trying to understand something.

I should probably try to get some sleep. I'll write more tomorrow, after I've had time to gather my thoughts. Maybe someone else has experienced something similar. Maybe someone can help me make sense of all this.

\[Part 2 will be posted tomorrow. I need time to process everything that's happened since that dinner. If anyone else has encountered the perfect man, I'd like to hear about it. Not that I wish this on anyone else, but... it would be nice to know I'm not alone in this.\]
