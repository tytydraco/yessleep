I’ve seen the sprites ever since that day. They communicate with each other somehow, which means they all know what I did. There are only three that I see repeatedly, I’ve recorded descriptions and drawings for a few dozen of them at this point. The main three I see typically show themselves once every seven to ten days. I’ve given them names since they almost never get closer to me than thirty feet, also they’ve never spoken to me since I broke the pact. The one I see the most I refer to as Ourea in reference to the Greek goddess of mountains. The other two are usually together, I call them Asteria and Tethys. 

Ourea is always sporting a different body shape, sometimes she’s human and sometimes she’s not. I always know it’s her because of her morphing face of shifting rock. I see her the most, she hates me. Sometimes I’ll wake up to see her face staring into my window with the body of a mountain lion or other big cat as I leave for work. Sometimes she will stay outside my house preventing me from leaving, prowling back and forth in front of my camper. My call offs are getting more and more frequent, idk what she wants from me but I know it’s not good. I’ve watched her chase down my truck as I drive to work, I know she can catch me. It feels like she wants the chase, like she wants me to be scared. 

Asteria and Tethys visit less frequently but always leave a lasting impression. One time I woke up to my camper shaking due to what I thought was a storm. When I opened the door I nearly fell into the water and drowned. It took the coast guard six days to find me. Sometimes Asteria will cause me to hallucinate entire weeks of my life, when in reality it’s only been a few hours. The hallucinations are never memories and I live a very routine life so sometimes it takes a few days to realize It’s not real before I can find a way out of it. It’s always something small like finding leftovers I didn’t make or working with a coworker that’s supposed to be on vacation. Snapping out of them is always the worst, it takes sometime to figure out if what I’m experiencing is real or not.

There was one “Sprite” that I’ve only seen once, she was dressed in a black knee length dress. Her eyes were gone and simply had deep dark sockets and tears of blood, she stood in front of the door of my camper. I tried to scare her away with my car and by yelling but she never budged. I got out and walked up to her with a tire iron in my hand, I’m not sure what my plan was but I was ready to go home. Once I got within a few feet she unhinged her jaw and it dropped to mid chest. Saliva and chunks of flesh started to drip from her chin and tongue. She began doing what I could only describe as screaming, it shook my eardrums and made my head pound. As what felt like a jackhammer slammed into the back of my head I fell to my knees, and grabbed my ears. I blacked out after a few minutes and woke up on the asphalt a few hours later, I got checked out at the local hospital and lost 60% hearing in my left ear and 40% in my right permanently.

I move to another town every time I see another one, I’ve given up on relationships and friendships. Women either don’t believe me or freak out when they see it for themselves. Friends have cut me off, from what I heard the sprites would visit them too. I’ve yet to meet a sprite that’s kind or even willing to talk, I’m going to try and talk to Ourea the next time I see her. If she talks back I’ll let you guys know.
