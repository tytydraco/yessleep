Ever since I can remember I have always had the bathroom light on. Doesn't matter if I was at a hotel for the night, the bathroom light was on and the door shut tight.

So as I walked past the bathroom before heading to bed, I saw no light illuminating under the shut door. I felt aggravated as I've told my husband, Anthony, multiple times to keep the light on at night. 

With a quick breath I stepped closer to the door and pressed my ear against it, listening for any movements or the sound of something on the other side. When I didn't hear anything I turned the doorknob and pushed it open slowly, my eyes darting around the darkened room.

I pulled in a quick, sharp breath as I stepped through the doorway and into our bathroom. The light from the moon was bright, but our bathroom was dimly lit with the sullen moons brightness. The bathroom was dark, the floor creaked louder than usual and the shadows danced taller than in the light.

Taking a step closer I froze, the walk longer than usual as the doorway to the toilet stretched out. I held my breath as I mustered up the courage to pass the cool, slick washer on my way to the light switch, cursing in my head that I wish Anthony wouldn't have turned the damned light off. My eyes darted around for any sign of life, alive or spiritual.

I crept closer to the light switch. The shower curtains darker than they should be. Replacing the cream colored curtains with biblical script and soft flying birds was a mass of inky darkness, hiding anything. I flicked the light on and my nerves instantly calmed down.

I shuffled out of the bathroom and yawned. My eyes heavy as I made way to the bedroom, across the living room and into our room where the shadows played games and the depth of blackness could swallow one whole.

I remember why I keep the light on. As a child I was scared one night and as I was making my way to my parents bedroom to find refuge, I passed by the cracked bathroom door and the inkyness bled out. As any curious five year old would, I pulled the bathroom door back just enough to peek inside and through the darkness and childlike imagination, I saw her.

She was facing away from me, her outline sharp and vaguely fuzzy from the moon light trying to reach the rest of the room. I stared in curiosity as she stood in the middle of the bathroom, until she turned towards me.

Her face was slick and the moon light glowed on her sickly looking skin. Her hair was dark and tangled up in multiple areas. Her eyes, a dark, and foreboding nature snapped towards me. She shrieked and with arms stretched towards me began running to me.

I somehow made it to my parents room, a blubbering mess of snot and tears as I told them everything. I remember the wild looks of two parents who just got woken up from their daughter crying and screaming in their room but I also saw a wash of understanding cross their faces. 

From that day forward the door was closed and the light was on. 

But we know how that goes sometimes, every once in awhile the power will faulter, and the bathroom light will flicker just enough that I can see feet planted firmly on the other side and a nail slowly being dragged down the bathroom door.

And the voice. The scratchy voice that only says one thing when the lights flicker and she appers.

"Lorelei.."
