Our children can creep us out. 

There are two types of parents: those who openly agree with the above statement, and liars. 

I love my son. I’m proud of him. Yadda, yadda. We say the same shit about all of our quirky friends and family. 

Damien pushes the envelope, though. 

“Can I have some sheep’s blood, Dad?”

I tried to hide my disdain. “Why sheep’s blood, son?”

“Because the incantation asks me to mix sheep’s blood with the lion semen.”

“Ah.” I rolled back and forth on my feet.

“Dad?”

“Hm?”

“Do you have any lion semen?”

These conversations were the norm. I envied parents who lamented having the sex talk with their preteens. I *wish* that my son was awkward in a normal way. I *wish* that his conversations involved his own semen.

I’m not sure what disturbed my sleep last night. All I know is that I found myself wide awake at nineteen minutes after one, three hours after I’d gone to bed. 

I knew that something downstairs had awakened me, but I didn’t know why. 

So I was on edge as I crept down the steps, heart racing as I tried to stop myself from imagining what I might find there. All sensible consideration told me that I should just turn on the lights, but my gut said that would be a terrible idea, and I couldn’t bring myself to override the feeling. That’s why I crept through the house with only muddled moonlight to guide my footsteps. 

I stood by the edge of the living room and took a deep, steadying breath that did nothing to quell my shaking. Closing my eyes, I told myself that nothing could reasonably warrant my apprehension.

I was wrong. Stepping around the corner, I found my own living room to be foreign as it sat awash in moonlight.

Damien had clearly found the sheep’s blood. At least I *hope* the red designs painted on my walls had come from some sort of animal, because it would take an entire human’s supply to produce that quantity of blood. I recognized a sulfur symbol and a pentagram, but most of the bizarre shapes were entirely unknown to me. Their sharp, drippy angles made my skin crawl. 

I stared at the floor to see that plenty of other skin had already begun its march. A hairless flesh pelt lay crumpled in the center of the room. I grew more longing but less optimistic that no humans had been harmed in the preparation of this terrible sight. 

I wobbled on my feet. 

Something shiny stood out. I looked to the middle of the room and saw moonlight reflecting off a mason jar filled with eyes.

Whoever had removed them had done a crisp, clean job. 

I leaned forward to vomit, but had to stop. Extending my head into the room was like slipping deep underwater: the pressure in my ears forced me back.

I stepped away, only to hear a squishing noise as something pulled on my feet. A coppery smell told me that I had been standing in congealing blood. 

I really wish I’d worn my slippers. 

In a daze, I staggered back up the stairs. Yes, I should have cleaned everything up. Yes, I should have confronted Damien. Yes, I should have done more before rinsing my feet in the shower and crawling back under the covers. 

But like I said, parents are human. I was scared, and I thought that closing my eyes and going to sleep would make the problems evaporate.

It didn’t work. 

For five seconds, I *felt* like everything was fine. Then I was struck with that moment when a sleepy brain recalls that something is wrong, but can’t quite remember what. 

Then I remembered Satan’s playground in my living room.

Chest hurting from my hammering heart, I got out of bed and picked my way downstairs in the morning light. The fear was mostly gone as I moved through my sun-soaked home. *Partly* gone. It didn’t matter, really, because everything hinged on what I would find in the living room. I held my breath and rounded the corner to discover-

Nothing. Everything seemed back in place. 

I smiled and pretended that I didn’t notice the copper smell.

The relief did nothing to relax the tension in my chest, though. If anything, the pain worsened as I leaned closer to the living room. Without thinking, I lifted my t-shirt. 

Three deep claw marks ran across my ribs. I tried to reason them as anything other than a malicious attack from a non-human while I was sleeping, but I’m not a good liar, even to myself. 

The thing is, they appear to be non-*animal* as well. They burn when I walk past my sage plant. 

Could tell me what the hell this is? Of course, part of me – a big part – doesn’t want to know. 

I do realize that I have to confront Damien. 

But the reality is that my kid creeps me out.
