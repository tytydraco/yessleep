It all started while we were walking to the bus stop. I've never bothered getting a car because of how cheap and mostly reliable public transport was here. A friend of mine worked close to my office so we often took the same bus home.   

Lately, I’ve noticed an increase in pigeons downtown and near where we waited for the bus. Personally, I liked the birds. I thought they were a bit goofy and aside from all the poop they left, I didn’t think they were a problem. My friend, Mat, hated them. He often had a new insult for the birds. That day was no different. At least twenty pecked around at the sidewalk in our path. He rat at them to startled them causing the flock to move further down. I frowned at him for being so cruel.  

I think any city with a pigeon problem also has a pigeon person. Someone who appeared homeless took care of the birds or treated them as if they were friends. Our local pigeon man was between us and the bus stop. He was dressed in a long black coat regardless of the weather. He fed and petted the birds as he talked with them. He had a beard, but it didn’t appear unkempt. I wondered if he had a home and pigeons were just a hobby. He also had a sign made of cardboard asking for donations. He listed how much money it would cost to feed the pigeons he was so fond of. 1.50 for a loaf of bread to 25$ for a month's worth of croutons. Mat nodded towards the man ready to mock him, but I gave him a look to shut him up.  

We started to walk by them while dodging birds at our feet. The man tore off pieces from a freshly baked loaf of bread. There wouldn’t be nearly enough for all the birds. I felt bad for them.  

I made it three steps past them as I sighed and turned around. Mat expected this. I have always been a bit of a pushover. He waited as I went over to the man and read over his sign again.  

“They’ll repay the favor.” The man said not looking away from his birds.  

“They will?” I asked while still trying to decide how much to donate.  

“These birds are better than people. They’re special. They don’t accept anything for free, so they’ll repay you.”   

I felt a hundred eyes on me. It appeared as if all the birds were watching as I pulled two bills from my wallet. I had recently snagged some overtime at work so I could afford to pay for a month's worth of croutons for the birds. The man accepted the money and nodded a small thanks. A few birds flapped their wings as Mat tapped his foot showing a sign he wanted to keep moving.  

“Don’t forget to take care of yourself.” I told him and joined my friend.  

“He’s probably just going to buy some drugs.” Mat said even though we weren’t out of earshot just yet.  

“Good for him either way.” I shrugged.  

We could still see the man and the flock of pigeons from our bus stop. True to his word, he went inside the small store he had been standing in front of and came outside with a bag of croutons. At least someone was taking care of the poor birds. But wasn’t bread bad for them? It made them happy so that was something.  

Our bus arrived and I had forgotten all about the exchange. It was only until a small incident happened a week later, that I was reminded of the pigeon man.  

I had been about to cross the street and had stepped off the curb when a pigeon flew in front of my face scaring the hell out of me. Thankfully it did because a car turned when it shouldn’t have. If I didn’t step back, I would have been hit. I stood stunned over what happened, my heart racing a mile a minute. Looking up I spotted the bird that saved my life sitting on a power line. I could have sworn it nodded at me.  

The day after I nearly died, I was walking to the bus stop but without Mat. The pigeon man was sitting on the ground looking after his birds again. I walked over to him and got down low so we could talk.   

“I only have this much on me today.” I said offering a five-dollar bill.  

“You still have three weeks left.” He said and didn’t reach out to take the offered cash.  

I was confused. Glancing over I saw so many of those birds staring in my direction. Their eyes appeared as if they understood what was going on.   

“A pigeon helped me out the other day. I wanted to repay it. Here.”  

He finally took the bill, and I stood back up. It would be nice if I could feed the bird that saved my life regardless of whether it meant to or not. But who knew what one it was. And I also hoped this man was taking care of himself and not just the birds. I noticed my bus drive by us. I darted down the street hoping to catch it in time. I scared a few birds as I ran down the street expecting the bus to drive away at any second. When I reached the stop, I noticed the reason why it hadn’t moved. A bunch of pigeons were sitting in the road blocking the bus and other traffic. They flew off after I got on. 

To be honest, I didn’t give the man expecting favors from the pigeons. At first, I didn’t even believe they were smart enough to do anything for a person and thought the man had some sort of harmless illness. For a moment, I wasn’t sure what I believed. Even if they were helping me out in some way because I bought their services, they were birds. What else could they even do?  

In the back of mind my I was counting down the days until my so-called pigeon contract ended. On the final night, I came home very late because of some final project crunch at work. My girlfriend also had been working nonstop to finish a big project. She was an artist who did massive paintings that a local gallery sold. She would spend a few months creating new pieces and living off the pay from the last batch. We were both suddenly hurting for cash because the gallery ordered three more large pieces and that meant she needed to pay for materials she hadn’t budgeted for. Once they were finished it would be worth it.  

“You’re late.” She commented stretching and greeting me by the door. “I heard Mat was going out tonight. Did you go with him?”  

The apartment smelled of paint even though she had all the windows open. She was covered with all sorts of colors and needed a shower. I bet that's just what she had been about to do before I walked in the door.  

“No, I was at work. I wanted to finish some stuff so I could have tomorrow off.”   

Faintly I heard a podcast in her painting room. Since she worked for long hours, she needed something to listen to. But I didn’t fully approve of her listening to so many true crime podcasts. She got pretty freaked out after so many hours of them.   

“You need to shower. So, do I. Let’s save some water.” I offered with a smile.  

I really wanted to hug her but didn’t want to get paint on my work clothes.  

“Can you take a rain check? I’m sore from working today.”  She suggested.  

She expected me to be disappointed, I was a little and I snapped my fingers as if I had just lost a bet.  

“Darn it. Ok, next time. And how did you hear Mat was going out tonight?”  

“His girlfriend told me. But if you’re not with him that means he’s going out drinking alone.” She said while crossing her arms.  

Mat liked to drink at a bar about a ten-minute walk from my place. For lack of a better way to put it, Mat had a drinking problem. Unless someone was with him to keep him in line, he always got in trouble while on a night out. I knew what was even going to be said before the words came out of her mouth.  

“Maybe you should see if he’s at the bar and get him home.” She suggested.  

I groaned and rolled my eyes. I was thinking of excuses when she raised paint-stained hands in a threat. I raised my own in defeat.   

“Fine. I wanted to buy something from the store either way. Let me get changed first. And you need to stop listening to those podcasts.” I told her.  

“I like Mat’s girlfriend. He might get wasted and cheat on her and she doesn’t deserve that.”  

“Mat is dumb but not dumb enough to cheat. Even if he tried, he’s such a messy drunk no one would take him. You just think he’s going to be nabbed by those Smiley Face Killers. Who aren’t real by the way.” I said with arms crossed.  

She narrowed her eyes over just how easily I saw through her and how I refused to believe a conspiracy she did.   

“If you keep that up, they’ll get you next. They also target boyfriends who don’t buy their loving girlfriends Cheetos.” She said while backing up towards the bathroom.  

I guess she wanted Cheetos while I was out. I let her get into the shower as I left to get my friend into a cab back home before he caused any trouble.  

I should never second-guess my girlfriend. She was smarter than me because somehow, she knew Mat needed help. I sent a few texts asking if he was at the bar. It wasn’t a very popular one so I could easily find him inside if he was there. I was a block away when I saw someone stumble out of the bar. Two people followed behind him. My hand tightened over my phone ready to dial the police if needed. I quickened my pace to try and catch up to the three of them. 

The pair closed the distance between the first man, and I heard my friend yell. They dragged him into a small alleyway as Mat drunkenly shouted for them to let him go. I turned the corner to see one man keeping a hand on Mat’s jacket and was in his face over something.  

“Do you always go around talking to other people’s girls? Huh? Do you really think she would give you the time of day?” The larger man accused.   

I suddenly felt exhausted. Why couldn’t Mat just behave? He made things worse by not understanding how much trouble he was in.  

“I didn’t know she was yours cause she didn’t look at you all night.” He shrugged.  

They got closer, both ready to knock some sense into Mat. I spoke up causing all three of them to look in my direction.  

“I’m calling the cops if you give me a reason to.” I said not feeling as brave as I sounded.  

“Is he a friend of yours?” The taller man asked.  

“Sadly, yes.”  

That was not the right answer. They both decided that I needed the same kind of punishment as Mat. Since I most likely was going to call the police either way, they figured they would get something out of being arrested. The taller one landed a hard punch on Mat’s face. I pulled out my phone about to call the cops but the second attacker moved too fast.  

He hit me so hard it knocked me off my feet. I’ve never been much of a fighter. I tended to take the easy way out or avoided confrontations altogether. The night should have ended with both of us in the hospital. But it didn’t.  

Wings flapped in the darkness as a sudden flock of birds came down. They flew in the face of my attacker blinding him. He swatted at the birds as he yelled. Their feet and beaks tore at his exposed skin. By sheer luck, he knocked one out of the air and hard to the ground. I scooped it up before he stomped on the poor bird. I held it carefully in my arms as I watched in horror as more pigeons flocked to the small alleyway.  

Within seconds what appeared to be a thousand of the birds came down. They mauled the two men. The sounds of their wings flapping were nearly deafening. Specks of blood and fabric flew out from the mass of feathers as they tore at the humans in the middle of the swarm. It didn’t see Mat for a moment. Suddenly he came bursting out of the mass, his face bleeding from the attack. Pigeons came down on him as they saw him as an enemy.   

The first man’s body dropped to the ground. Through the flapping wings, I saw a mass of flesh and bone. My stomach twisted and fear ran through my body when I realized the birds were eating them alive. And Mat was next.  

“Wait! Please!” I cried out expecting the birds to understand me.  

He curled in a ball on the ground as they pecked away. He begged me to do something but there were far too many.   

“He’ll buy you croutons!” I shouted, feeling a little bit stupid expecting such an offer would work.   

Somehow, it did. The birds let up long enough for him to get up. He made a run for it and I caught up to him and grabbed his collar. We were going to uphold our deal. He rambled scared and hurt begging for us to just go home. I looked up to see hundreds of pigeons sitting on buildings looking down at us. I called a taxi to get us to the nearest open grocery store.  

No matter where we went, we were being watched. I still held the injured bird from the fight unsure of what to do with it. It sat calmly in my arms as we went inside the store. We were an odd sight. One was beaten and bruised while the other held a pigeon. We gathered up bags of croutons hoping it was enough. Mat meekly tried to make me pay for some of them. I told him he had to do it. The birds already liked me.  

I wasn’t certain how we would feed all the pigeons but that was answered when we left the store. The Pigeon Man waited for us, and he accepted the bags along with the injured bird.  

“Can we go home now?” Mat said while looking around.  

He fidgeted seeing so many birds watching us from all directions. I swear their eyes were glowing but it may just be the streetlights reflecting off their pupils.  

“Your friend is in the clear, but the birds don’t like you. Mat, was it? You’ll need to keep buying them food every month, so they won’t punish you.” The man said almost sounding bored.  

“Punish me for what?!” My friend demanded.  

“You kicked one of them outside the bar tonight.”  

I looked over at Mat frowning in disappointment. The fact we got away tonight was a miracle. These birds had been nice enough to give him a second chance after he hurt one of them.  

“It’s just a bird!” He protested.  

“No. It's not. In case you haven’t noticed, this city is theirs now. They’re just nice enough to let us live in it. Unless you want to end up as the others tonight, you’ll feed them.”  

Those words chilled me down to the bone. Flapping came overhead. A few pigeons landed near us, their dark eyes watching our reactions. Finally, Mat smartened up and nodded, agreeing to the deal. The man told him how much he needed to buy each month and let us leave.   

I made sure Mat got home and we swore not to speak about what happened that night. I think he was worried the police wouldn’t believe pigeons killed people who were going to kick his ass. 

I got home late as my girlfriend rushed over, clearly worried. Only when I saw her I realized I’d forgotten the Cheetos. She didn’t care about that. She wanted to know why I had a bruise on the side of my face. I made up a lie about two guys trying to make trouble and we spent some time running around a few blocks trying to lose them before heading home. She believed that and I finally was able to relax a little from such a weird night.  

Two months had passed since then. I was aware of every pigeon staring down at me as I went to work. Sometimes they watched me through the office windows. A small feeling of fear hit my stomach every time I saw one of them.   

I should have expected Mat to not be able to last two months. He disappeared last week. My girlfriend is spending a lot of time with his girlfriend to comfort her. It kills me that I can’t tell them the reason why he was gone.  

I haven’t heard of any reports of the bodies of the two men showing up. After all, two pecked-to-death men on the street would be a big deal. I’ve walked by where it happened during the day. Aside from some stains on the ground, there were no signs of what happened.   

I met the Pigeon Man again, cash in hand.  

“Can I pay for my girlfriend?” I asked him  

He smiled but didn’t accept the money right away.  

“They only attack people who wronged them. They’ll do favors and look out for the people who buy them food. But I think someday soon they’ll fully take over this city. I have a feeling that day will be a blood bath. The only ones who will make it out alive will be the people like yourself. So, do you have any family that lives in the city?”  

Luckily, I didn’t. I paid him and moved on silently starting to plan when to move.  

It would be hard starting in a new place. My girlfriend has only sold work to a local gallery. I hoped she could do the same thing if we left here. I didn’t know how much time we had left, but it feels as if more and more pigeons are appearing on busy streets.  

Do me a favor, take care of your local Pigeon Man. He might be more of a help than you first realize. And whatever you do, don’t mistreat pigeons no matter how much you dislike them.
