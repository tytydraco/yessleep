It's easy to tell myself none of this was real inside the warm, locked Church. And this is the last place to share this but I don't know what else to do. The cops will laugh, and so will reporters. Maybe not Ross Coulthard, but everyone else? Forget it. (ASIDE- PLEASE GET HIM TO CALL ME)

So, I'm a bit of a couch surfer yeah? I don't very often stay in the one place. I also take a couple of substances I probably shouldn't on a daily basis, so you'll discount my story, but I swear on my life that I wish it was made up. Only the names and one of the people's gender is.

I've either gone crazy, or someone (something) fucked up is stalking me. 

My friend Simon let me pitch a tent on his property, which is a converted Church out in the middle of nowhere in Victoria. There's Simon, myself, a couple (George and Isa) and a slightly younger dude named Brad. All of these names are related to their real names in a lateral way, because like I said, I wish this was a story. 

I started work four days ago, and last night I broke up with my girlfriend. We both cried all night and then today turned a bit nasty on both sides. The reason isn't important, the stress might be though. 

I had to work until 10 tonight, and then again at 9am tomorrow. Or today. Right now it's 4.16. I decided to just stay up all night and tough it through. I was just getting the floodlight set up on the concrete tennis courts when a sound that I'd never heard but could reasonably be associated with electricity started coming from the powerlines that ran from property to property here. The power transformer thing on the pole I thought. But not sure that's true now. 

I went to get Simon, but the sound stopped. It was odd that it did, but it was odd that it had started in the first place. 

I got back to the court and immediately started again. 

That was the first creep out moment.

Actually, the second but I need to back up some.

The last couple of days, I've been noticing my tent zip not shut the same and earlier tonight, I'd noticed it again, so I set my phone up to record audio in the tent while I went to shoot hoops to maybe see if I was going crazy. It needed to charge anyway and the only mains power I had was a single extension lead outlet in the tent. I specifically zipped the tent up just as I left to catch the sound of it.

I couldn't keep going to get Simon if the sound was going to keep disappearing, so at this point, I went to get my phone in case, to text or call him. 

This time, my tent zip was all the way open. No denying it as a figment of my imagination either, because on the sound recording, you can hear me closing it, but somehow pick my phone up inside the tent 33 minutes later without opening it again. My blood turned to ice at this point.

I went back to the courts because all my things were there, to collect them and shut down the floodlight.

As soon as I got on the court I got a feeling of dread. It's old and the concrete is covered in trees and grass, except where we cleared for a hoop. I could hear twigs breaking, and a light started wobbling in the paddock across the highway that ran past the place. 

I started panic texting Simon to let me in (he locks his doors when he shuts down for the night because of theft.)

He came out and got freaked by the tent but didn't believe me about the rest.

I'm unsure what to do right now, but I want to go back outside because I'm sick of typing. Me and my girlfriend, sorry, ex, broke up and were fighting all day. 

If there's anything worth updating you all on, and I live through it, maybe I'll post an update later once the sun comes up.

Wish me luck
