When a blue mark is made, a heart becomes a spade. And with any good spade, you dig and you dig deep. For it was down in an earthy hole that I would bury my Blue Crayon, my piece of impossible wax, with its lead cast wrapped in duct tape like a mummified coffin. I remember standing over my hole, surprised at how far I’d dug, for I had plunged my dad’s shovel through layers of red and gray clay—what we called our Texas gumbo. And it was there that I made for that crayon the most perfect grave.

But burying my Darkest Blue was yet days away, for in my foolishness, I still had more damage to do. More darkness to bring to life.

You see, on the night that I drew Bradley’s picture and gave a wicked presence to his closet, I didn’t sleep well at all. There was tossing and turning. There was sitting up and hugging my knees, wearing my crown of sweat in the dark. There was the memory of the crayon’s aroma—acrid and earthy—when I pressed it and let its color. It was like I could smell that cloying fragrance even as I twisted in and out of my knife-narrow sleep. Somewhere in that liminal space, I thought I saw blue flesh over taut muscles on a gaunt form moving around my bed. Its face was a blurred horror that my mind rejected, but its eyes I knew, for they were like blue stains in an infinite dark. Only that dark was my wounded mind.

Throughout the night, I thought I heard something deep and reaching, something like a rhythmic rumbling, low and distant. Listening to it was also like feeling it, for I both felt and heard its dark pulse through the walls around me. Maybe even through time. And I think I heard a boy’s muffled scream echoing across that penetrating pulse.

When I got up in the morning, I couldn’t find my blue jelly bean anywhere. And even stranger, the Blue Crayon was out of its pouch and resting on a blank sheaf of paper. I already felt sick to my stomach, but seeing that dark crayon made me vomit right then in a terrible mess. I finished in the bathroom and found my blue jelly bean there by the toothpaste. When I went to pocket it, it turned black and broke into two pieces, which left me feeling vulnerable and abandoned.

Despite my feelings, I scooped up the pieces and put one in each pocket. Vomit or no, school couldn’t be avoided. And honestly, I was too afraid in that moment to be home alone. Despite having made my drawing of Bradley and his blue-dark closet, I was honestly surprised when I didn’t see him on the way to school. In fact, he was absent that day. As the hours ticked by, I found my eyes straying to his vacant desk. His empty chair did not bring me satisfaction. Stealing glances at it throughout the day only gave me a deep and growing fear that I had done something very wrong, something irreversible, something for which I could never be forgiven.

When Ms. Jones barked at me to pay attention, I felt stunned and disjointed, like I only partly understood where I was and how I had gotten there. I waited until she turned to the chalkboard before reaching into my pockets and removing the two pieces of broken black jelly bean. I held my hands high and released them, letting the pieces fall to my desk, as if in an act of ceremony. There was no thought in this action. There was only the instinct to do so—perhaps from some terrible place.

Instead of bouncing and flying far, the pieces moved like something heavier, rolling and tumbling along the open pages of my math workbook, before coming to rest at the central seam. One immediately sprang to life as a housefly and the other as a scuttling roach. And when the kids around me started gasping, and one of them screamed, I found myself grinning even though joy was the last thing that I felt.

I’ll never forget the way that Ms. Jones looked when she wheeled around from the board, her piece of chalk in hand, mid-writing pose. It was clear that she didn’t know what was going on—but her eyes told me that she suspected me at the center of it.

“Danny, bring me your conduct card!”

“What for?”

My tone was dead and immediate, and I remember thinking that my voice didn’t quite sound like me, or even really *feel* like me. Those two words and their defiant question had simply come out of me like an unrestrained belch.

The class fell silent, and the fly and roach went as motionless as the printed problems on my open page. For they were smart little pieces of dark, easy to forget. Easier even to unsee.

Ms. Jones and I glared at one another, and time seemed to take its own breath between us.

You see, no one challenged teachers in those days. Not in elementary. Not in the late 80s, at least not where I grew up. And certainly not in the way I had done *then*. Honestly, I think my defiance had even surprised Ms. Jones. Half a moment was all it took to see that she had been triggered on a whole new level, for her face betrayed her with its rapid reddening.

“It’s one mark for disrupting the class and another for being insubordinate. We can easily make it three if you want to keep me waiting?”

I removed the bold yellow paper with its maroon print from my trapper keeper and met her at her desk.

“Give me as many marks as you are willing to receive,” I said. Only this time, I spoke with my own voice and with my own intention.

In that moment, I felt emboldened by the words that had come out of me before. And I felt encouraged by her abuse of power. The injustice of it all triggered a rage within me that seemed to erase my previous dread.

When we locked eyes, I pictured the Blue Crayon in my mind, as if it was a thing I could brandish like a weapon on some low telepathic level. And there I saw it gleaming on a window sill, where its inky darkness held the moon’s shine like an eel lying in wait. Inanimate as it was, it felt to me as a thing long lurking in our minds, dwelling at the invisible tunnels that connect them to each other. If she could see it, if she could *feel* it, I hoped that my Darkest Blue could stagger her. I hoped that a single fleeting glimpse of it in her mind might take something out of her, some piece of fire or spirit forever stolen. But instead, she only seemed more flustered.

When she tore the paper from my hands and asked me what my question was supposed to mean, I touched her hand. It was gentle and deliberate and swift. And in that moment, I could smell her sweat bleeding through her antiperspirant. When I didn’t answer, she cleared her throat, gave me two marks, and sent me back to my desk without further word.

As I sat down, I felt for the first time triumphant, like I had *beaten* her somehow. The whole class must have felt it, or felt *something*, because the kids were quiet and subdued for the rest of the day. And so was Ms. Jones.

Little could I know, my sense of victory was merely another illusion of the Blue Crayon and its power and perhaps that of its maker.

*Don’t think about Blue Simon, Danny. Don’t remember Blue Simon.*

But you and I both know it’s too late for that.

It may not be too late for Vic, though. Not if I can do something good with my Darkest Blue instead of something terrible. There is more to tell about what I did to Ms. Jones and what happened to Bradley, but even now I feel the earth calling to me in that place where I buried it.

And that temptation feels stronger now than ever.
