Blue used to be my favorite color, but not anymore. Not after what happened. Not after I bound that crayon in lead and buried it so many decades ago. But these times are strange and desperate, and my need is no different. Unearthing that blue crayon and using it once again may be the only option I have left. The only option I have to save her.

Even as I type this, I wonder what the fuck I’m doing. I need you guys to talk me out of this. I need y’all to tell me that I’m crazy for even considering it. But before we get to that, before I can even tell you about Vic and her situation, I’ve got to spill my guts a little about what happened to me as a kid and how the Blue Crayon itself was made. Yeah, that’s right. I’m capitalizing it. You’ll soon read why.

So I’m a middle-aged dude that grew up in a refinery town near the Gulf Coast. I was one of them latchkey kids in the 80s. It wasn’t easy for me after my best friend moved away. Not only did that mean that I didn’t have anyone to sit with at lunch, but it also meant that I had to walk home by myself. And I use the term “walk home” loosely, because I was usually running or hiding from this dickhead of a kid that we’ll just call Bradley.

He was already an unnaturally big kid when we were in third grade, and he’d failed a grade a time or two as well. I don’t know why he had it out for me so bad. Maybe it had something to do with us living in the same apartments. Maybe it had something to do with me being easy pickings. To this day, I don’t really know what drew him to me. I won’t bore you guys with the ear flicks and the “your mama’s so fat” jokes, though in hindsight I was more sensitive to the latter than I should have been. I think what really hurt me was when my choose-your-own-adventure book, the one I checked out from the library, went missing from my desk. It wasn’t so much the fact that someone stole it, and I know that it was Bradley. It was more the fact that when *The Cave of Time* was mysteriously returned to my desk, it was stained and it reeked of urine.

I cried right then and there. Right in the middle of class, man. And it wasn’t a quiet cry either. It was ugly and messy and loud. I couldn’t help it. Between the hell I caught every day from my old man, to my best friend moving away, to the constant shit from Bradley—not to mention my teacher, whom we’ll just call Ms. Jones—that damn book was my lifeline, my escape. If I made a bad choice or got myself into a situation, I could always turn the page back and make a different choice. I had some form of control, you know? But in my life, as a kid who was supposed to be “seen and not heard,” I felt like I had no control and certainly no voice.

To make matters worse, Ms. Jones called me out in front of the whole class, and I swear there was a smile on her face to see me crying. She’d had it out for me ever since I corrected her in front of the whole class when she said that *Super Fudge* was written in third person and I piped up with “Actually, it’s written in first.” And even though she scolded me and said that I was wrong, we both knew that I was right. To this day, I’ll never forget that look in her eyes and her snapping, “Bring me your conduct card!”

And I’m not trying to go on and on about this, guys, but Jones would always give me bad conduct marks. Like, I NEVER understood what I was doing wrong. I actually blamed myself for a long time, just trusting that the adult was right and that I must have deserved the bad marks somehow. I could never explain to my dad why I was always bringing home bad conduct reports. And the shit with him was a whole other thing, but there’s really no need to go into all of that. I think you guys get the picture.

Anyway, it was close to Spring Break and I was running home, trying to get to my front door before Bradley could catch me. For the part of Texas where I grew up, it was actually a nice day out. In fact, I would have loved to have taken my time, walking by the bluebonnets that grew in the wooded field behind my apartments. After all, they were only in bloom for a few weeks. But a picturesque, mind-clearing walk simply wasn’t in the cards for me. Not then.

To this day, I don’t know why I looked back over my shoulder. It was like a suggestion from another place, brief and faint. And when I glanced behind me, I saw Bradley at the start of the field, only he was mounted on a bicycle. I was pretty sure he hadn’t seen me yet, so I ducked into the woods and dodged some poison ivy that was growing around a rusted car I didn’t expect to find there. In fact, there was all kinds of shit hidden back there, including a tall chain-link fence covered mostly in ivy. There was a little rundown house there too—more of a shack, really. But I’d never known a house to be surrounded by a fence that was ten feet tall and crowned in barbed wire. In fact, the whole time I’d lived there, I never knew any of that stuff was hidden in the woods, just waiting to be found. There wasn’t even proper access to the property from the road. When I thought of Bradley racing across the field, it was pretty easy to motivate myself to zip up that fence and use my backpack as padding against the barbed wire.

Once I dropped to the other side, I studied the rundown house long enough to realize that no one was there. It looked like something from the 1920’s maybe, single story. One or two bedrooms. Shiplap. Single bricked chimney. The windows were dirty, but I had no interest in going inside. In fact, the steps were all I needed. So I settled down, prepared to wait a while, and went to take out my book before remembering what had happened to it just a few hours before.

I just broke down again right there on those steps. I didn’t want to cry. I didn’t want to feel sorry for myself, but there those feelings were, just pouring out of me like a broken faucet.

When a warm and gentle voice said, “Surely there’s a better use for your tears than that,” I just about pissed myself for real.

*Don’t think about Blue Simon, Danny. Don’t remember Blue Simon.*

Sorry, y’all. I can’t delete those last two sentences, even though really I want to.

But after I just about jumped out of my skin, I saw that there was a kind old man there, standing with the door open. He had the bluest eyes I’d ever seen, and good smells were coming from inside the home. A pie, perhaps? A blueberry beckoning? Through the threshold, it was cool and inviting, and swimming with more colors than I thought there should be. More colors than anything real should possess. And I don’t remember being invited in. I just remember sitting there with the kind man at a table in a room that looked too large for his home. Despite that, it felt good to be in his presence. Never more safe, in fact. Nothing to wish or wonder or worry about.

To tell it true, sitting there with him, I felt that if Bradley showed up, he would be the one in trouble. Perhaps even in danger. I’m not afraid to admit that this pleased me greatly, and I found myself smiling for the first time in months.

“And there it is,” the old man said, “Light born from shadow.” His voice was rich and vibrant, and he smelled so good, and his eyes were so blue. Bluer than I knew anything could be. Indigo deep, like stains in a misaligned void.

When he said, “My name is Simon, what is your name,” I don’t remember thinking or deciding to act. I just remember my mouth opening and my body making all of the connected motor movements to speak, like I was a passenger inside my own body.

I heard myself say, “My name is Daniel, but everyone just calls me Danny.”

That made him grin from ear to ear, with more teeth than I thought any person could have. They were white-strange in their perfect color and edge-straight in their perfect form, like a mouth that had never been born. And, between his teeth and eyes, I felt entranced and not quite myself, shivering with delight to behold him.

“And what evil troubles thee that thou wouldst give away thy precious tears so easily? For sorrow is thy currency, boy, and give not of it freely.”

Even though most of my memories involving Blue Simon were hazy and sweet, like so many stains of blue syrup adrift in my thoughts, I’ll never forget Simon’s question and the queer commandment that followed. It was all in that old speech style—but seemingly only then. His words had a way of changing shape in my mind, like an enlivened putty that could take any form it chose, beyond and after the fact of its setting.

And when I told him of all I had suffered at Bradley’s hands, at Ms. Jones’, at my father’s, his smile ever deepened, like a ribbon slashing through his being. And when he asked me what my favorite color was and I told him that my favorite color was blue, a sound rumbled from him that reminded me of a deer snorting in heat. And I laughed because I thought it was funny.

With an everlong finger, he wiped a tear from the corner of my eye, which his skin then drank like a thing starving.

“There, there, Danny. No need to laugh until all thy drawings are done, for I shall make thee a blue crayon, and its colored wax shall give thee peace ever after. The peace of thy beautiful works, dreadful in their becoming. For thou art the Maker Within, besotted by the Maker Without. So let us profane not this providence and get on with our scheme proper. For I must cast the color of thy impossible blue, the wax of thine sorrows.”

I had no idea what the fuck any of that meant. But, to speed this up a bit, I’ll share that he gave me a list of ingredients he would need to make my crayon. And he told me that I only had three days to gather them. He gave me a blue jelly bean to keep in my pocket, for he said that it would make my troublemakers ignore me or be otherwise occupied. But I wasn’t allowed to come back until I had everything on his list. And so it became the only thing on my mind, day into day, dream into waking dream.

True to Simon’s word, my tormentors seemed significantly less interested in me when the blue jelly bean was in my pocket. And that made it somewhat easier for me to snag my ingredients. I was to steal a blue crayon from the public color box in the back of Ms. Jones’ classroom. And I was to steal a blue crayon from Bradley’s pouch, which was safely secured inside his own trapper keeper. The third ingredient was “something forbidden and blue and long desired”, to put it in Simon’s words, but a thing ultimately of my own choosing. And the fourth ingredient he refused to tell me.

“That,” Simon had said, “will be collected when we make the wax. It is the most special ingredient of all, for it can only be harvested when ripe in its own moment.”

I can only write so much in one go here, so I’ll just say that, thanks to the blue jelly bean, which seemed to distract my tormentors, and in turn made me more relaxed, I was able to take my time, focus, and ultimately lift the two crayons I needed. And when it came to the ingredient of “something forbidden and blue and long desired,” I could only think of the bluebonnets growing in that field behind my apartments, next to Simon’s wood. They were the state flower and illegal to pick, but their color I had long coveted before needing them for my dreadful purpose.

When I brought my three ingredients to the kind man’s property, I saw that the front gate, which was as tall and ivy-covered as the rest of the fence, was unchained and ajar like an open invitation. There was also some kind of industrial sign mounted on it, rusted at the edges, and covered almost entirely by ivy. I pulled some of the overgrowth back to see that there was a logo of a single blue eye, simplistic and large, with words beneath it.

**IRIS INDUSTRIES**

**Authorized Personnel Only**

**Containment Site A21**

There was some more stuff on the sign beneath it, but the ivy was thick, and I became distracted by my cause, or perhaps by something like the tone of a bell. The next thing I could recall was being inside with Simon. We were at a great stove where blue fire had already sprung to life, dancing beneath a small iron skillet. He was delighted to see my crayons and my bluebonnets. And I was pleased when he began breaking one into little pieces. He told me to break the other crayon and relish in how good it felt—and true to his word again, it did. I somehow suspected that it was Bradley’s crayon I held, and as I snapped it into pieces, nothing in my young life up to that point had felt better.

“The Ancient of Nights may be your enemy, and I may be a trickster with my own needs, but I take from you nothing that will harm you and nothing that you will ever need.” Then he nodded, “Now, those pretty flowers. Pull them apart and feel yourself enjoying the loveliness of their destruction. The green and blue and white that they leave on your fingers, their messy beauty, relish it before you cast their bits unto our heated iron.”

And when the wax and bits of flower had begun to bubble in a blue and sticky mass, he said, “And now for the fourth ingredient. Into my eyes you must stare and remember the well of darkness you have already plumbed, for you are mightier and more enduring than you know.”

In my mind, I was lying face down on the carpet of my living room, forbidden from moving, forbidden from turning my head towards my lounging family or the playing television there. I could either stare down straight at the carpet, or turn my head towards the sliding glass patio door of our small apartment. My parents and elder stepbrothers were watching *Short Circuit* on VHS. A movie I had wanted so desperately to see with them, but could not. For ninety-eight minutes, I lay there with my face in the carpet, sometimes turning it to the side so I could breathe better, forced to listen to a movie I couldn’t watch. All because of bad conduct reports I could do nothing to prevent.

Much and more Blue Simon took from me, drinking my tears like whispering streams afloat and drifting in the space between us. And I felt unburdened and exalted in a warmth of letting them go, giving them to him to digest and savor. His monstrous appetites were well met with my monstrous feelings, and this felt to me far more symbiotic than parasitic. But not all of my sorrow was kept selfishly for himself. For I witnessed him sprinkle much of it into the bubbling wax that burped in its blue heat.

He poured our mixture into a lead form shaped like a crayon, before clamping the form closed and placing it in his vintage ice box.

I don’t remember how long I was there, waiting for my Blue Crayon to cool. I only remember Simon’s instructions.

“Draw no new images with your deep piece of wax. Never draw a thing anew, boy, for regret it you shall. Instead, make the image of your Bradley or of your Ms. Jones with other crayons made by the machines of men. It is when you alter those drawings with your Deepest Blue, the wax of thine soul, that you will change their lives forever… in any way that should serve to please you. For your sovereign hand deserves a sovereign knife, and together have we forged one.”

Before I tell you about how I used that Blue Crayon and why I think I might need to go and dig it back up, I think I have to stop here for now. If I’m being honest, I feel far stranger than when I sat down to write this. Digging around in the deep well of my memories, especially surrounding the Blue Crayon, has given my mind a dripping fog.

I haven’t felt this fucking weird in a long, long time.

I think I need to check on Victoria and clear my head a bit.
