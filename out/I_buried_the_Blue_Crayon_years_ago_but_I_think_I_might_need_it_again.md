There is no dreadful wish quite like the blue mystery that was the crayon I drew with and wielded as a kid. Though sometimes, …I swore it looked black.

That’s been in my mind ever since I last posted about this. I didn’t realize that telling y’all how the Blue Crayon was made would make me feel so mixed up and fogged, like an inside-out brain within an inside-out heart. Indigo deep and ever true.

*Don’t think about Blue Simon, Danny. Don’t remember Blue Simon.*

But all is well within the dream, except for Vic, ‘cause she can’t scream.

You see, Victoria can’t talk any more. At least, not as well as she used to. Seems the same degenerative disease her mama suffered from has seen fit to take up root in her. Though, it’s arrived decades earlier than expected. Soon, the doc says that Vic will have trouble breathing.  

In my helplessness, I’ve given my mind to wander a dark road of late, sleepless and ever pondering. Before I even realized the Pandora’s Box of memories I was opening in my inner well, I couldn’t help but wonder one thing:

*What if I were to draw Vic in ordinary crayon, and then give her a blue mouth? Or maybe blue lungs.*

What if this piece of terrible wax could be used to give blue blessings instead of blue curses? After all, it’s one thing to know that I’ll never hear her sing again. It’s another to accept that, pretty soon, she and I will have shared our last spoken conversation—at least our last one with any clarity.

I know.  You probably think I’m crazy. And that’s fine. You’re not even wrong in that.

But you should at least understand what the Blue Crayon can do. You should at least know how I used it so long ago, before realizing that it did far more harm to me than Bradley or Ms. Jones ever had—or even ever could. You should know *why* I sealed the Blue Crayon within the very lead it was cast, and then buried it beneath the bluebonnets. And there it sleeps, like a thing just waiting to be found and used again. Or so I’ve recently imagined.

I’ll never forget the afternoon that I made the crayon with Simon there in his uncanny home within that tall fence. The one with the overgrown Iris Industries sign. I remember his instructions, which were as inviting as they were haunting. And all the while, he stared into me with those blue-strange eyes.

“Draw no new images with your deep piece of wax. Never draw a thing anew, boy, for regret it you shall. Instead, make the image of your Bradley or of your Ms. Jones with other crayons made by the machines of men. It is when you alter those drawings with your Deepest Blue, the wax of thine soul, that you will change their lives forever… in any way that should serve to please you. For your sovereign hand deserves a sovereign knife, and together have we forged one.”

I don’t remember leaving Blue Simon’s house. I just remember being back in the field behind my apartments, adjusting my backpack and heading home. I could tell by the sun that I had been there for hours. But that didn’t stop Bradley from surprising me when he rode up out of nowhere on his bike. I don’t know if he had been waiting for me all that time, or if it was just part of some terrible coincidence. When he drew his water gun and began dousing me, I found myself drenched and stinking of piss.

Even in the retelling, I know it’s difficult to believe. Especially in this day and age. But the time I grew up in was so different, so cruel, so hateful. And much of it ran completely unchecked, from kids and adults alike. It’s like there was a pervasive antagonizing energy that manifested itself in the most physical ways. Who knows what shit they’d been putting in our food and in our fumes back then, to say little of having to take most breaths through a haze of second-hand smoke nearly any time you were indoors or riding in a car.

And, in that moment, I just saw red. There was no fear. There was no sadness. There was only rage. For a twinkling, I saw a glimmer of fear in Bradley’s eyes. It didn’t matter that he was nearly twice my size. When I lunged at him, he sped away on his bike—though he waited until he was a distance away before he started laughing.

There were no tears in my eyes. No feeling sorry for myself. There was only the volcano within me, smoldering and ready to burst. I marched home in such a rage-filled trance that the rest of the walk seemed to pass in an instant. Before I knew it, I was under the shower head considering all of the ways I might draw and color Bradley.  And, with a curling half-smile, I thought of what *gift* I might give him with my dark new crayon. In the rising curtains of steam, I found myself well-pleased with an idea. After all, Bradley needed a *friend*. Someone to keep him company at night.

When I found myself at the dinner table, surrounded by my colors and my big art pad, my stepbrothers were in the living room watching *Growing Pains.* Dad wasn’t home yet, *thank god.* My stepmom was making meatloaf in the kitchen, being awfully quiet and keeping her back turned all the while. It was weird, for sure, but I paid her no mind. The important thing was that they were all distracted when I began to draw Bradley in his bed with the covers all the way up to his chin.

And I did have the blue jelly bean in my pocket—just in case.

As for my drawing in crayon, I was sure to emphasize Bradley’s large bushy eyebrows and his crooked two bottom teeth. It was his eyes that I intentionally bulged and made far larger than they should have been. After all, in that moment, I wanted them to be eyes full of fear.

I didn’t know how his bedroom looked, but for some reason, it was easy enough to imagine. So I drew the vague shapes of objects and furniture as my instincts told me to suggest them. It was his bed that I put facing his open closet, with the door yawning open. Instead of drawing a void of darkness there with my black color, I picked up my Blue Crayon, removing it from its lead cast for the first time.

Touching it was like a cool kiss, and I shivered in a quick flush that was rather pleasant. All along my spine, strange feelings leapt and danced across my flesh, like I had become part of some greater antenna. For the briefest moment, I hesitated with my Blue Crayon just over the picture.

Forging the color and removing it from its cast for the first time was one thing. But actually pressing the Blue Crayon to paper and leaving the first mark was another action entirely. The sturdy paper with my drawing in crayon had become a threshold. And leaving my ***blue mark*** would be crossing it.

I was so young then. But even I understood that much.

The first thing I did was color in the darkness there in that closet with my impossible blue. And there, the wax flaked and burned in its whispering cool shadow. When its color was let, there arose a faint aroma, sweet and earthy, like some kind of anise or fennel. From my rhythmic movements, a great void was born, deep and layered, and teeming with terrifying possibility. It was there in my good work that I saw fit to leave two lightly shaded areas that would give the impression of the blue-dark having its own eyes.

When I took a few moments to study what I had done, I felt nauseated and afraid. Afraid to keep looking  
at it, and equally fearful of what it might do to me if I tried to destroy it. What you may not fully understand yet is that I had done the unthinkable. 

I had made a closet that could stare back from the dark.
