Hello. My name is.

Let’s try that again. My name is.

Okay, my name is irrelevant, not that you’d remember it if you did read it, or even if I told you in person. It’s an effect of my condition.

I love Google. Through it I have the knowledge if the world at my fingertips. All of the information accumulated by humanity can be found if you know how to use it.  Want to know how to bake some delicious chocolate chip cookies? Google it. Want to learn an ancient ritual for summoning the spirits of the dead? Google it. Want to find me, my name, or any evidence that I really exist? Don’t bother.

No. I’m not a secret government agent who had his presence on the web meticulously scrubbed by geniuses for my own protection.  And no. I didn’t do it myself or have it done for me due to any affiliation with a criminal organization. It was done involuntarily, and near as I can tell, irreversibly. But I’m getting ahead of myself.

Google used to love me back. For years my website was one of the most trafficked in the world. It was on the first page of search results whenever people were looking for information about controversial topics. Science, religion, politics, and history were my forte. If there was strong disagreement or conspiracy theories surrounding a topic, my website was a top tier source of information, and people used it in numbers comparable to any three mainstream news outlets combined. When there was a story on my site, it would be shared widely through social media, and linked to hundreds, sometimes thousands of smaller sites that would use mine as a primary source of information.

It was beautiful, magnificent even. I was trusted by all the right people, and I was proud to bursting of what I had accomplished. I was in the elite of the internet, the virtual version of being a champion Olympic athlete.

And it was full of crap.

I was a troll extraordinaire. I gave the world bad information. I did it on purpose. I reveled in the social chaos that was the result of my magnificent prank on the gullible and ignorant masses searching for confirmation bias, and validation of their mistaken or groundless beliefs. I gave them what they wanted. I fed it to them like a parent spooning from a jar into the mouth of a hungry, ever so trusting baby. In exchange I gained money and fame in equally generous amounts. The great scam artists of history: P.T. Barnum, Charles Ponzi, and their ilk would have envied me if they were alive today.

Do you remember how huge the story of Hillary Clinton being outed as a lesbian who lets her husband go tomcatting around so she can fulfill true carnal desires was back in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary? No. Of course you don’t. It was one of my stories. An extraordinary hoax, complete with faked photos that cratered her poll numbers and moved the DNC to use their superdelegates to pave the way the way for the first interracial American president, and it’s as if I never existed. Sure, the effect it had on the world remains intact, but nobody remembers the real reason why. It’s as though there is a collective delusion to fill in the blank space where my work once held full credit, and all that remains are rumors of her closeted homosexuality among her political enemies.

Perhaps you’re familiar with the 9-11 Truth movement. I didn’t start that one, so you should remember it just fine. Thing is, I’m the one who gave it legs. I was searching the internet for stories for my site. I needed one with enough backing to be believable, but also so unlikely to be true that I could use it to play with people’s heads, and I came across this obscure gem. A conspiracy that the U.S. government took down that World Trade Center itself and blamed terrorists so it could start a war for oil that it never claimed as the spoils of war. It was pure gold.

Many people credit Alex Jones with popularizing this conspiracy theory.  Well, he first learned about it from me, not that he remembers. We were buddies back then. Like me he never met a crazy conspiracy he didn’t like. Unlike me, he actually believed them then, and he believes them now. I mean, seriously. The government is poisoning the water to make the frogs gay? How funny is that? We had so much fun together! I miss him.

So how it is then that you have no idea who I am?

Google has been working to improve the reliability of its search results practically from the day it launched.  Their product may be you, and everything you think is private so that they can sell your life to advertisers, but the lure that gets you to willingly give it to them is all that sweet free information in an easy to use, convenient, and reliable search engine that gives you exactly what you want. Chief among them being good, reliable information.

My website represented the exact opposite of this ideal. Hucksterism was my game, and deceit was my trade.

And business was good.

Nowadays, making money on a website can be challenging. The price of advertising is lower than it used to be, and people are less prone to clicking though ads. That’s where the real money is. You might get a pittance for eyes on, but it’s click throughs that really get you paid. Back when I started the money flowed like water. If you had a popular website you could go from a nobody to a millionaire with 300 employees in just a few years if you played your cards right.

I never hired anyone. That meant that I was basically chained to my computer every waking hour, but it also meant that I got to keep all of the money I made for myself . . . well, after Uncle Sam swooped in to take a grossly unfair portion of the fruits of my labors. Seriously. In what world is it fair to spend 3-6 months of your life every year working for free because some government goon is taking your money from you at gunpoint? How is that different from slave labor?

But I digress.

The point is, I was a one-man operation. Nobody was tied to my business but me. So don’t go around trying to figure out if that money I used to have is still tied to my or my business in any way. I assure you that it is not. I honestly have no idea what happened to my money. Where to millions of dollars go when they don’t belong to anyone? Perhaps Google took it. Maybe it was simply sucked into the infinitely hungry black money hole that is the federal government. Maybe it was simply deleted from existence. Our money is mostly digital these days anyway. Erase a bank account, erase the money. Regardless, my fortune vanished without a trace. Every penny earned over years of endless work gone in the blink of an eye.

Google was a multiplied blessing for me. It served both as my primary means of gathering information, and as my primary means of spreading my own brand of misinformation.

That said, if something isn’t on Google, not just buried and hard to locate, but genuinely missing entirely, does it really exist at all? If all of the information in the world, all of the known information, study, events, and general information of human history is online and searchable through Google, what does it mean if it can’t be found? And, relevant to my won story, what does it mean that I can’t be found?

It all happened in an instant, in one of those moments that should be entirely unremarkable, and, in this case, ironically forgettable. Forgettable for you, but never for me.

I sat down at my computer one morning, logged in, and opened Google so I could check for anything useful may have come up while I slept. I had every expectation that the same thing would happen that day as had happened every single day for years. It should have perfectly and satisfyingly ordinary with another day of bland but happy research, writing, and posting wonderfully deceptive stories for the hungry, gullible masses.

Imagine my surprise then, when I opened up my Google homepage and was greeted with the following message: ”You have been deleted for intentionally spreading false and misleading information.”

“What?” I muttered, mouth agape in confusion and surprise. This isn’t April first. What kind of joke is this?

I navigated to my website to log in and do a little work only to be greeted by the nonexistent domain error message. “Hmmm . . . Can’t reach that page? Odd. Lemme Google it.” So I did. I googled my own website and the search result was fruitless. No matter how I searched, no matter my search terms, I got no results that included my own website, and often I got no results at all. I searched myself and found other randos with the same name, but not the most famous one: me.

Frustrated, I went to Twitter to complain to my legions of followers. Every login attempt just got me the “Failed login: Username and Password do not match” message. I searched my account name without logging in, and there were no results to be found.

I went to Facebook with the exact same result. I tried to log into my various email accounts, and they all failed the same way. I attempted to recover my accounts with my usernames and a password reset link texted to my phone, but they all had the same result. “Incorrect Username”.

I broadened my search for anything I could still log into. World of Warcraft? Gone! Amazon? Gone! YouTube? Gone! Bank accounts, utilities, online subscriptions, credit card accounts, and anything that I could normally access online? Gone, gone, gone, gone, and oh-so-gone!

I ran a virus scan on all of my devices and they came back clean. I repeated the scan with three additional antivirus programs, and all came back clean as well.

I restarted my computers, phone, and every other net connected device I owned. When that failed I tried resetting my computer only to be completely unable to properly set it up again due to, you guessed it, no Microsoft account.

“Son of a bitch!” I screamed impotently as my computer rejected my login credentials. I pulled out my cellphone to call customer support, dialed the number swiftly and surely, my fingers stabbing the screen with quick, angry jabs. I put the phone to my ear and . . . nothing. Absolutely nothing! Not even a lousy “This phone number is no longer in service” recording. Just plain nothing!

I tried to open some apps to see if the phone had anything actually working. They all opened, but they all had forgotten me and had asked me to set up a new user account.

“Damn it!” I shrieked as I violently hurled my very expensive iPhone into my equally expensive oversized Ultra HD monitor. They both broke gloriously, bits and pieces flying off in random directions as I growled impatiently through gritted teeth.

“This is crap!” I angrily declared to nobody after I regained a modicum of composure. “I’m going to the library. Maybe I can get some work done from their computers while I get this sorted out!”

I got dressed. Yes, I actually did do most of my work in my underwear and a bathrobe. Yes, I knew it made me a living stereotype, but I was too rich and influential to care. Who was going to see me anyway? I worked alone out of my home office. I grabbed my wallet and keys and hurried out my front door. My next-door neighbor happened to be taking out his trash at the same time. “Good morning, Jim!” I hurriedly greeted as I rushed to my car.

I didn’t fully comprehend his response at the time. My mind was wholly preoccupied by my mysterious computer problems. He gave me a confused look, cocking his head to one side and saying nothing as he hesitantly raised his free and gave me a halfhearted wave hello.

I slid into the driver’s seat and slammed the car door shut. “I swear, when I find out who’s responsible for messing up my computer like this, he’s a dead man!” I groused as I keyed the ignition. The engine roared to life, and the sound of the powerful motor soothed me slightly.

I love my car, and I tried several times to describe it here for you, but apparently that would give you enough information to identify me. So just trust me when I tell you that you’d love to have a car like mine. Sadly, it seems that the page simply will not allow me to commit something that could allow people to pick me out in a crowd to print. Hence, I am reduced to speaking in generalities rather the details of my gorgeous, crazy fast, super sexy car for you so you could form the proper mental picture of this enviable machine. As it is, just imagine whatever car you think is gorgeous, super sexy, and crazy fast. You might even manage to picture mine.

I slammed the car in reverse, zipped out into the street without bothering to look. Yes, I know I could have killed someone, but at the moment I didn’t really care. Once on the road, I slammed the car in gear, floored the gas, and sped down the street like a two-ton bullet.

Yes, I was driving recklessly and I didn’t care. Have you ever been so thoroughly pissed off that you were fine with endangering other people and yourself in your fit of foolish rage? That was me. My world had just been upended, so I honestly didn’t care if I upended someone else’s world. Misery does love company after all.

I roared into the library parking lot in a third of the time it should have taken me to arrive and came to a screeching stop in the handicapped space. Spaces actually. I double parked. I was going too fast to fully stop in time, and I took out the handicapped sign and put a decent dent in the bumper of my year, make, and model I can’t tell you super-expensive sports car.

The minor miracle of having broken almost every traffic law, including speeding, running stop signs, running red lights, failure to yield, illegal passing on the right, illegal passing in a no-passing zone, and reckless driving without once encountering a cop in the eight-mile drive barely registered in my mind. I fixed my furious glare on the library doors and huffed like an angry bull. I held no appreciation for libraries at the time. They are increasingly obsolete relics of an age from before the internet put all that every library in the world contains and more into our homes, and even into our pockets as smartphones improved. I saw them as enclaves for the old, the poor, and the technologically illiterate.

The library was a large, sprawling, two-story affair with blocky construction and lots of windows on such a large lot of land that the utter lack of a useful public space like a playground, public pool, athletic fields, or all three since it had the space was utterly appalling to me. Seriously, if my taxes are being used to maintain the property, the least the people spending my money could do is get the most bang for my buck.

I stalked up the sidewalk, violently threw open the glass double doors, and angrily marched up to the librarian. “I need to use a computer.” I growled.

My demeanor hardly seemed to faze her, a plump, mousy woman in her fifties with long black hair streaked with gray, or, rather, gray hair streaked with black. She merely arched one thin eyebrow at me and said “Okay. Let me see your library card.”

“My library card? I responded incredulously. “Lady, I haven’t been to a library since the last time my mom took me as a kid. I’m only here because my computer got hit with the nastiest, sneakiest virus I’ve ever seen, and I desperately need to get online so I can handle some business and get my remote service guy to clean up mu PC before I get home.”

“No problem,” she said with absolutely no concern whatsoever for the massive info dump I just inflicted upon her. “Just fill out this form and I’ll get you a library card in just a few minutes, and then you can use the computer. Just stay off those porn sites unless you want to give our computers the same virus yours has. Also, it will get your computer privileges permanently revoked.”

She slid a stack of three blank forms and a pen across the desk to me. “We’re not too busy right now, so you can go ahead and fill the application out right here.”

She turned away and did whatever it is that bored librarians do on her computer while I filled out the forms. “Done!” I declared after a couple minutes of furiously jotting down the required information. “Can we please hurry?” I asked as I handed her the completed forms.

“This won’t take long,” she promised. She checked the forms, and a confused, annoyed expression clouded her features. “Is this a joke?” she demanded as she handed the papers back to me. “These forms are blank!”

“Bullshit!” I replied, annoyed at her sick sense of humor. “I just filled them out! You saw me do it!”

I looked down at the forms in my hands. To my utter surprise, the top form was completely blank as if I had never touched pen to paper. I frantically spread them all out on the desk so I could see them all at once.

They were all blank.

“That’s,” I stammered, “um . . . surprising. I could have sworn . . . I mean, I’m sure I . . . whatever. I’ll do it again.”

“Do you need help filling them out?” she asked with a tone that practically screamed “*Say yes and prove you’re a moron. Come on. Do it*.”

“No . . .” I murmured. “Just, give me a few minutes.”

Had I really made some incredibly stupid mistake in my haste? I checked my pen. The ballpoint was retracted, but I was sure I’d had it out while I was filling out the forms. I was sure I’d had it out while I was writing. I was sure that I saw ink flowing across the page as I worked. I was severely stressed. Was it possible that I never even had the point out and just scratched blank lines of nothing on the pages? Yes. That had to be it.

I clicked the top of the pen slowly and deliberately. The point came out and stuck firmly in place with a satisfying *click*. I put the pen to paper and took a few test strokes by slowly writing down my first name. Black ink flowed out onto the page and my name appeared on the white paper in solid black lines. I continued this way all the way through to the end.

“Okay. Done!” I declared as I drew the final letter on the final page. “Now can I please get my library card so I can use the computer?”

The librarian picked up the forms, looked at them, then set them down and fixed me with an angry glare. “This isn’t funny young man!” she scolded. “Now get out of here and take whatever is recording this lame prank with you!”

“What?” I asked, confused.

“This!” she snapped as she forcefully thrust the papers back at me and shook them under my nose before shoving them into my hands.

I looked at the newly crumpled papers, and my eyes grew wide with shock. “This can’t be.” I mouthed breathlessly.

The pages were blank. Every line that I had just filled out in heavy block lettering was as clean and white as newly fallen snow. There weren’t even the impressions that pressing my pen into the paper should have left even if I hadn’t clearly seen the black ink pour out and affix itself to the paper as I wrote.

“This can’t be,” I repeated. “It makes no sense.”

“Oh, it makes perfect sense,” the librarian retorted. “You’re screwing with me, and it’s not funny. Now get out!”

Look, I’m not a crier. I didn’t cry when Old Yeller died. I didn’t cry at the end of Where the Red Fern Grows. I didn’t even cry when my own pets died. Not ever, including as a kid. My parents are alive and well, as is my brother, and I was never close to our extended family, so I had never felt loss on that level. But just then, looking at those forms, I broke down.

“What are you doing?” the librarian went from angry to concerned the moment I shed my first tear.

“I don’t get it.” I blubbered. “All I want to do is check the internet, and I can’t even fill these forms out. What’s wrong with me? What’s happening to me?”

The librarian looked like she genuinely felt my pain. Women are amazing that way, able to feel other’s emotions almost as if they were their own. It’s called empathy, and they have it in buckets.

“Tell you what,” she said tenderly. ”I’ll log you in with my credentials. Do you promise not to access any porn, drug, or anything that’s against our use policy?”

“Yes,” I nodded, rubbing my eyes dry with the back of my hand. “I really do need to look a few things up. I promise it’s all safe for work.”

She led me to the computer lab and logged me in as a guest under her credentials. I thanked her profusely, sat down, and got to work.

I checked my website.

Gone.

I checked my social media.

Gone.

I checked my email addresses and commerce accounts.

All gone.

Then I looked myself up using every combination of data points that I could think of. I was famous. I was in the news. I was practically a household name.

Nothing.

Defeated, I logged out of the computer and pushed my chair away from the little cubicle. I was emotionally exhausted without the energy to be even a little mad anymore. My head hung low. I waved dejectedly at the librarian on my way out and thanked her again on my way out.

She gave a confused look and asked “Thanks? For what?”

I shook my head, taking a moment to appreciate her humility that made he see the great favor she did for me as nothing. Then I turned around and dejectedly walked out the door and to my car. There was a parking ticket on my windshield. I didn’t care. I left it where it was as I unlocked the doors, got in, and fired up the engine.

I slumped in my seat, leaned my head back, and sighed heavily. Not knowing what was happening or why. All I knew was that my life as I knew was almost certainly over, taken from me as surely as if I had never existed, and I had no idea how I was going to get it back.
