I made the worst mistake of my life. It all started last week when I got an email on my home computer! It was from someone named (MR E)! The email read as “do you want to do a survey to get a reward in return?”   
  
I was confused as to what this survey meant at the time! But I did it anyway. And what I first saw was a warning saying, “if you choose to do this you must live with the consequences!” it then gave me the choice to continue! I was pretty sketched out so I tried to click no but it would not work!  
  
So as i was getting annoyed i decided what harm could come if I click yes? So, after I clicked it, I was put into the first question “what is your favorite color?” only red and blue were a choice! But luckily, I like red, so I choose that.  
  
The next question was “do you like coffee or tea?” I thought about it because I like both, so it was hard to choose! But I choose coffee. And then I heard a knock at my door! It was inside my house, so I was concerned as to who knocked because my wife Anne wasn't home, and my daughter Cindy was at school!  
  
But I eventually opened the door! And saw a cup of joe on the floor. I was confused but then I remembered that I was asked this question on the survey! I grabbed the coffee and put it on my desk not wanting to drink it!   
  
The survey then asked me another question “would you like 7 million dollars?” I without thinking choose yes! But I should have chosen not to because I was then emailed by (MR E) a recent news article saying, “seven million dollars stolen from a save the children charity organization!”   
  
I was appalled by this, so I was about to exit out of the survey! When I got another question, “Do you see the sniper?” I froze but not for long because I heard a gunshot, and my window broke! I looked outside and could not see who ever shot that!  
  
Then (MR E) emailed me saying “that was a warning!” after I read that I went back to the survey and clicked no! The survey then asked me “100 or 200?” I was confused so I emailed (MR E) “what do those numbers mean?” (MR E) emailed back “you’ll see!”  
  
I tried to email (MR E) multiple times, but he must have gotten angry, so another bullet was shot, and it almost hit me! (MR E) emailed back saying “do the fucking survey or else!” so I went back to the survey, and I thought for a few minutes, and I chose 100!  
  
And then (MR E) shared with me another article saying “300 hostages are abducted but only 200 are freed” I clicked the article and found out that 100 children were burned alive as their parents were forced to watch!  
  
After I read this, I felt disgusted knowing that this was my fault! I then got a phone call from my daughter's school. The phone call said “um Mr. smith your daughter Cindy smith has not come to school today we tried reaching your wife, but she did not pick up!”  
  
I felt sicker than I felt before I almost gagged! But there was nothing I could do so I continued with the survey! My next question was “what are you more afraid of?” It then showed two oppositions: the dark or gas! I was scared as to what the gas would do to me, so I chose the dark!   
  
Suddenly all my power went out and my window was covered with a black tarp! I could hear someone break my window and get into my house!  They walked upstairs and towards my personal office! I heard a knock, and I was scared.  
  
The survey asked me “do you want to open the door or do i have to?” there were no options on the survey! But I knew what this sicko was wanting me to do so I casually opened the door! I was then grabbed by a man in a black suit with a featureless white mask! and knocked out by chloroform!  
  
I then woke up in a concrete room with 2 tv screens. A young charismatic voice came out of a speaker and said “hello Mr. Smith I am (MR E)?” The TVs then showed 2 people, my wife Anne and my daughter Cindy! The robotic voice then said “which one do you choose to sacrifice?”  
  
I was scared as to what he meant by sacrifice, but I knew it wasn’t good! I thought about it long and hard, but I came to the conclusion that Cindy was a child and had more to experience in life than Anne so unfortunately, I chose Anne to be sacrificed!   
  
Then the tv showing Cindy's picture changed to a video of her! It was vile and showed her arms and legs turned into stumps! And her eyes were missing! She was still alive but barely as she crawled around on the floor screaming and crying!  
  
(MR E) then said “are you happy Mr. Smith?” I yelled crying back “what the fuck is wrong with you bastard!?” (MR E) snapped back saying “that’s not as bad as what the sacrifice is!” the tv showing Anne then went black and then showed my wife Anne she was tied up to a grill! Then the man in a black suit and white featureless mask walked up to her with a cheese grater and cultivator.  
  
He then proceeded to grate her skin off as she was screaming. After she was skinned, he proceeded to stab the cultivator into her chest and dragged it up her fleshy body up to her head! After he did that, he turned the grill on! And as my wife burned, she kept screaming but it got weaker and weaker until she died!   
  
Then (MR E) on the speaker said “when you wake up you and your daughter will get a prize!” and then gas filled the room, and it made me feel sick and sleepy! I woke up next to my daughter who was in a wheelchair sleeping in a motel room!  
  
I waited for her to wake up. When she did, we drove to our house from the motel! It was closer than I thought! But unfortunately, when we got there, I found it burned down with only my personal computer unharmed! It had one last email from (MR E) that said “I hope you enjoy the 7 million dollars I sent you, don't tell anyone how you got this!”  
  
I looked at my bank account on my phone and saw 7 million dollars in my bank account! I still have not touched that money! I am afraid to call the police because of what (MR E) might do if I call them! Even as I currently write this on my personal computer, I am scared that (MR E) will find this post! I hope this is the last I ever have to deal with him!
