I think it’s about time I let you in on some of the more… disturbing aspects of this job. After all, the non-human residents here do function much differently than we do. Other than dealing with residents that have no problem physically lashing out because how dare I call their pile of mush and keratin a pet instead of their child, there’s other things they don’t tell you when you start this job.
 
The coverups are probably the more tedious of it all. Several residents here can’t survive off of normal food. They’ll eat it when necessary, especially when in the presence of other humans, but it doesn’t give them the nutritional value that they need to keep going. Some do eat things that are more harmless, like bugs and even inanimate objects like screws or wood, so that’s not really a problem.
 
The problem is when I have residents that need to eat bigger living things. We have a rule against eating other residents, I’ve had to enforce that a few times, but my issue is when I need to find a way to cover up the disappearances of people from around the city. It technically makes me an accessory, and I know this. I was bothered by it in the beginning, terrified actually, but after a while you learn how to cope with it.

Let’s just say that the city has a rather steady routine of missing person’s reports, reports that I have to work to cover evidence trails before they’re even put out. How do I do that? I’ve told these specific residents that if they plan on making a meal out of a human, they need to verbally tell me when they bring the person back to the complex. No phone call, no text, no email, they need to tell me face to face since I can’t risk having anything that can trace it back to me. The weird nature of the building helps with that, since cops can’t really find this place, but it’s still a worry I always have in the back of my mind. 

I think the most disturbing case I had was a resident from a couple years ago. Most residents that have to do this can function off of maybe 1 human per month, which is manageable for me to take care of the trails. 

This resident needed at minimum three humans per WEEK. That wasn’t even the worst part, the worst part was that this resident didn’t take any care in making their meals silent. I had so many calls from human residents due to concerns of screaming and yelling from this apartment that I needed to find plausible explanations to avoid a massive problem. 

So, if you come to the city, and someone asks you to go for a walk with them, make sure to keep a very close eye on the details. A missed scale, claw, eye color, or fang could cost you your life, and me my time.
