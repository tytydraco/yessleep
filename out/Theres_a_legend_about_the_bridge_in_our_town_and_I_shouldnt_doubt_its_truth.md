Lucy and I became best friends on our first day of third grade. That day, she punched Ridley because he pulled my hair. She was taken to the principal's office, and I waited for her on the bench outside, swinging my legs, a warm feeling welling up in my chest. When she came out, her eyes were red from crying, but her chin remained firm. I gave her half of my peanut butter sandwich.

“I’m allergic to peanuts,” she said.

"Ok? Would you like some of my apple juice?"

She took the apple juice, and from that moment on, we were inseparable.

Growing up in Millbrook was like living in a crystal ball, beautifully enclosed, artificially creating an aesthetic, but you always knew there was a pane of glass separating you from the real world. There were only eight thousand people, one high school, two churches, and a five-cent shop on the main street where candy cost five cents. It was like a place where everyone knew each other, a feeling that was reassuring until you realized it also meant everyone knew each other's secrets.

Or rather, they thought they knew.

Like all small towns, Millbrook is steeped in legends. Stories are passed down from brother to sister, whispered around pajama parties and campfires. Most are similar: a murder occurred in the house at the end of Buck Street in the 1950s; at midnight, you see lights floating in the cemetery; and there's the old quarry where teenagers used to go drinking, sometimes never to return.

But what fascinates me most is the story of the Old Mill Bridge and the Devil's Mist.

The legend goes that every twenty years, a special mist envelops Millbrook. It's not ordinary fog, but something entirely different and absolutely silent. If you're standing on Old Mill Bridge when the Devil's Mist appears, and you sing a specific song as you cross, the mist will transport you to another place. Not just a different geographical location, but a completely different world. Another version of Millbrook. A parallel universe where everything is entirely different.

The song is probably "She Moved Through the Fair," an old Irish folk song. The melody is said to be repetitive, telling a tragic story of discovering a loved one's death. Legend has it that you must sing the lyrics three times continuously while crossing the bridge, without looking back. If you sing it correctly, you will enter another world when the fog dissipates.

Most people treat this as a joke. Every twenty years, on the night the fog is supposed to appear, teenagers make bets to see who dares to sing this song while crossing the bridge. But nothing happens. When the fog dissipates, they remain in familiar Millbrook, perhaps a little disappointed, but mostly relieved.

The last time the fog appeared was in 1995, five years before Lucy and I were born. This meant the next "fog" would arrive in 2015, when we were fifteen. Lucy and I spent hours discussing it, planning to sneak out that night to experience the ritual ourselves, purely for fun.

But by 2015, we had almost completely forgotten about it. We were busy with high school, busy dating boys, and busy with the anxieties of being seventeen and thinking we knew everything.

Lucy's dad was one of the topics we no longer talked about.

Mr. Thompson had always been different. I remember him as a child. A tall, thin man with kind eyes, doing odd jobs in town. He had been a janitor at the elementary school, then a gardener at the cemetery, and then unemployed for a while. Lucy never wanted to talk about why he kept losing jobs, but I heard rumors. Adults whispering. "Alcoholic," "unreliable," and later, only "homeless."

By the time we were in high school, Mr. Thompson had become an invisible man in Milbrook. You would occasionally see him in the city center, sitting on a bench outside the library or begging for change near the grocery store. People would go out of their way to avoid him. Lucy no longer invited me to her house—well, there weren't many houses left to invite me to. She lived with her father in a run-down apartment above the laundromat, and I knew she was ashamed of it.

But Lucy never stopped loving him. She would secretly stuff food from the school cafeteria into her bag to feed him. She would give him the money she earned as a babysitter. When other kids mocked him, she would stand up for him without hesitation.

“He’s sick,” she would say, her voice strained. “It’s not his fault. If people help him instead of judging him, he’ll get better.”

I believed her. I always believed Lucy.

That fall, around our seventeenth birthday, everything changed. Lucy started acting strange—she was always nervous and distracted and constantly looking back as if someone was following her. She no longer stayed up late after school for cheerleading practice. She would turn pale when she received a phone call.

“Is everything alright?” I asked her one October day, watching her stare at her phone, her expression unreadable.

“Yes,” she blurted out, her voice too hurried. "Everything's fine."

But I knew things weren't good. Things weren't good.

I just didn't expect things to get this bad.

November 15th, 2015, Sunday. I remember it clearly because Coach Henderson annoyed me by scheduling cheerleading practice on Sunday night; we were supposed to be home watching movies. We had an important game coming up, and she made us practice over and over until it was perfect.

Lucy and I were the last ones left in the gym, practicing a throw, but we kept failing. I tossed her up; she turned, but she just wouldn't land properly. On the seventh try, she landed hard on her ankle, yelling in pain.

"That's it," I said, grabbing my bag. "This is it. If this keeps up, you'll ruin your ankle."

"If I don't get it right by Friday, the coach will kill me."

"The coach can handle it. Let's go home."

We walked into the November night, our breath condensing into mist in the cold air. The sun had already set when we practiced, and the temperature had dropped. I pulled my coat tighter.

“Want to go to Angie Mama’s for pizza?” I asked. Angie Mama's is in the city center, open late on weekends, and always a popular spot for all the high school students.

Lucy shook her head. “No. I have to go home.”

“Why? Do you have a date?”

“No, I just… I have to go see my dad. He wasn’t feeling well this morning.”

I wanted to ask what “wasn’t feeling well” meant, but the closed-off look on Lucy’s face suggested she didn’t want to talk about it. So I just nodded, and we started walking.

Millbrook wasn’t a big town. You could walk from one end to the other in less than an hour. Lucy and I lived on opposite sides of Old Miller Bridge; I lived in the nicer neighborhood with big houses and manicured lawns; she lived on the east side, in an area of ​​apartments and small houses. Over the years, we’d walked home together hundreds of times from school, practice fields, and friends’ houses. This had become our daily routine, and it made us feel safe.

The bridge was almost exactly halfway between our two worlds.

About five minutes from the bridge, I noticed the temperature had dropped again. The air was damp and heavy; I could see my breath condense into a thick white mist.

“This weather is weird,” Lucy said, rubbing her arms.

“Yeah.”

We reached the bridge entrance. Old Miller Bridge was an old bridge, built in the 1920s, entirely made of wooden planks and rusty iron railings. The townspeople had always said they wanted to tear it down and build a modern bridge, but the budget had never been right. So the bridge stood there quietly, creaking and swaying slightly as you walked across it, with Miller Creek flowing thirty feet below.

The streetlights disappeared about twenty feet from the bridgehead. There were no lights on the bridge, so crossing it at night meant traversing a long stretch of darkness before reaching the light on the other side.

We stepped onto the bridge, and just then, the fog began to roll in.

At first, the fog were just wisps of smoke, clinging to our ankles like curious kittens. But within seconds, it thickened, rising from the stream below and surging in from all directions. I'd seen fog before; Milbrook sometimes gets foggy in the fall, but never this thick. It was almost solid, pure white, and impenetrable.

"Wow," Lucy gasped. "This fog is so thick."

Then I remembered. November 15, 2015. Twenty years since the last time it appeared.

"Lucy," I said slowly, "what's the date?"

"What? November 15th. What's wrong?"

"The legend. That bridge. This should be—"

"Impossible." Lucy's eyes widened. “The fog? That’s just a story.”

“Then what is this?”

We stood there, the fog thickening until I could barely see Lucy, even though she was right beside me. The temperature plummeted, and my teeth began to chatter.

“We should go back,” I said.

But when I turned, I couldn’t see the way we’d come. The fog swallowed everything. I couldn’t see the town behind me, I couldn’t see the end of the bridge, nothing but white.

“I can’t see the way back,” Lucy said, and for the first time, I heard fear in her voice.

“Okay, okay, let’s keep going. The bridge isn’t that long; it’ll be on the other side in two minutes.”

“Jenny, what if it’s real? What about the legend?”

“Then let’s not sing. We’ll just walk across silently. It’s simple.”

Lucy grabbed my hand. Her fingers were cold, or perhaps mine were. “Don’t let go,” she whispered.

“I won’t, I promise.”

We started walking. Our footsteps echoed on the wooden planks, muffled by the fog, sounding somewhat eerie. I silently counted my steps, trying to gauge how far we'd gone. Ten steps. Twenty steps. Thirty steps. We should be on the other side by now. The bridge isn't that long.

"Jenny, I feel like we're going in circles."

"Impossible. We're walking in a straight line."

But she was right. Something was wrong. We felt like we'd been walking for five minutes, yet we were still enveloped in fog, still standing on the bridge. Unless we hadn't moved at all? Maybe we were just standing still, and the fog was creating an illusion of movement?

"Sing a song," Lucy suddenly said.

"What?"

"Sing a song. Any song. I want to hear your voice. I need to know you're still here."

So I started singing. The first song that came to mind was the one we learned in elementary school music class. "In beautiful Dublin, the girls are so beautiful, and I saw sweet Molly Marlon at first glance…’"

But what I sang was, “My young love said to me, ‘My mother won’t mind.’ ‘And my father won’t slight you for your lack of kind.’ And she stepped away from me, and this she did say: ‘It will not be long, love, till our wedding day…’”

“Jenny, no!” Lucy gripped my hand tightly. “Don’t sing that song! It’s a legendary song!”

I stopped immediately, my heart pounding. “I didn’t mean to. It was just the first song that came to mind.”

“Then think of something else!”

But it was all set in stone. Perhaps it was destined from the moment we stepped onto the bridge. Because the fog had changed. It no longer merely enveloped us; it penetrated us, cold and intrusive, as if trying to reach into our hearts and reshape something fundamental.

I felt Lucy’s hand slip from mine.

“Lucy?”

No response. “Lucy!”

I whirled around and outstretched my hands but could only grasp at the cold air. The fog was so thick I couldn't even see my own hands.

“Lucy!”

I stumbled forward, or perhaps backward; I couldn't tell. My foot tripped over something, and I fell, my hands slamming heavily against the wood. I knelt, gasping for breath, fear gripping my throat.

Then, as suddenly as it appeared, the fog dissipated.

I was on the other side of the bridge, kneeling on the sidewalk of Maple Avenue, bathed in the harsh yellow light of the streetlights. Behind me, the bridge stretched into ordinary darkness; the fog was gone. The November night was clear and starry.

Lucy was gone.

The next few hours I remember almost nothing. Only a chaotic jumble of panic and disbelief. I remember running back to the bridge, screaming Lucy's name. I remember shining my phone's flashlight into the stream below, terrified to see her body lying on the rocks. I remember Mr. Peterson coming out of the house in his bathrobe and asking if I was alright.

“My friend,” I said over and over. “My friend Lucy. She was with me. She’s missing.”

Mr. Peterson called my parents. My parents called the police. The police came with flashlights and searched the bridge, the creek, and the woods on both sides. They asked me questions. What was I doing? Had we been drinking? Had Lucy said she was upset? Had we argued?

“No, nothing. We were just on our way home. Suddenly it got foggy. She took my hand, and then she didn’t.”

The policeman, Officer Davidson, whom I’d known since I was a child—he’d given a lecture in my elementary school about the dangers of strangers—looked at me with that pitying look that made me want to scream.

“Jenny, honey, there’s no fog tonight. It’s been clear weather all night.”

“There is fog. There’s fog on the bridge. It’s so thick I can’t see anything.”

“Shall we take you home? It’s late. You must be terrified.”

They took me home. Mom made me hot chocolate, but I couldn't drink it. Dad sat on the edge of the bed, gently stroking my hair like he used to do in my childhood nightmares.

"Everything will be alright," he said. "We'll find your friend."

But his voice sounded off. Hollow. It was as if he was saying what he should say, but not from the heart.

I didn't sleep that night. At six in the morning, I started dialing Lucy's cell phone. No answer.

At seven, I went downstairs. Mom was making breakfast.

"Mom, we have to go to Lucy's. We have to see her dad. He must know where she is."

Mom's hand hovered over the coffee pot, without turning around. "Jenny, honey, I think you should eat something. You must be exhausted."

"I'm not hungry. I have to find Lucy."

"Baby..." She finally turned around, her face full of concern. "Lucy doesn't exist."

These words sounded nonsensical. I heard them, but my mind went blank. "What?"

"You were alone on the bridge last night. The police investigated school records. There is no student named Lucy Thompson at Millbrook High School. Never.

“Impossible. She’s my best friend. We’ve been friends since third grade. She’s on the cheerleading team with me. She was practicing last night. Coach Henderson was there too. She saw Lucy.”

“Coach Henderson said you practiced alone late last night. You asked her if you could practice your stunts by yourself.”

“No, no, that’s not right. Lucy was there. Lucy is real.”"

Mom came over and hugged me. I stood stiffly in her arms, my mind a jumble. This wasn't right. Nothing was right. Lucy was real. I had so many memories of her. Hundreds and thousands.

The day we ate sandwiches together in third grade. For Halloween in sixth grade, we dressed up as ketchup and mustard. In freshman year, we were both kept after school for passing notes in English class. Just last week, we were studying chemistry. I was doing a test at the kitchen table, and Lucy made up a funny song to help me remember the periodic table.

“I think we should take you to see Dr. Morrison,” Mom said gently. “He can help you.”

Dr. Morrison was the only psychiatrist in Millbrook. He was a kind old man with white hair and a soft voice. I had seen him once before, when my grandmother had passed away and I couldn't sleep.

That afternoon I went to see him. I sat in the leather chair in his book-filled office and told him everything. About Lucy. About the fog. Almost everyone was acting as if she had never existed.

He listened quietly, without interrupting, his hands clasped under his chin. After I finished, he was silent for a long time.

“Jenny,” he finally spoke, “have you ever heard of false memories?”

“Lucy wasn’t a false memory. She was real.”

“Our brains are amazing. Sometimes, especially under stress, it creates very vivid, very realistic memories that never actually happened. It’s a coping mechanism.”

“I’m not crazy.”

“I didn’t say you’re crazy. I said your brain might be trying to help you cope with something. Has anything very stressful happened in your life recently?”"

I really wanted to throw something at his understanding face. But I didn't. I just sat there, my hands clenched tightly on my knees, feeling something deep inside me begin to crumble.

Over the next few days, I tried everything. I went to the school and asked them to re-examine the records. I went to the cheerleading coach and showed her the photos on my phone, but when I opened the album, there were no pictures of Lucy. Only photos of myself, in every place I remembered Lucy being.

I went to the apartment where Lucy and her father lived. It was empty. Not just empty, but..." There was no sign of anyone having ever lived there. The walls were bare, and the floors were covered in dust. The landlord said the apartment had been vacant for six months.

I went downtown, looking for Lucy's father, the homeless man everyone knew. I asked shopkeepers, other homeless people, anyone willing to listen. Nobody knew who I was talking about. They said there was no homelessness problem in Millbrook. People here can take care of themselves.

I searched for Lucy Thompson online. Social media, school records, birth certificate—nothing. It was as if she had been erased from existence. She was gone, erased from the past. As if she had never existed.

Yet, I remember her. I remember everything about her.

Slowly, and terrifyingly, I began to doubt myself.

Maybe I'm going crazy. Maybe I've created a fabricated friend, unable to distinguish between fantasy and reality. Maybe that fog never happened. Maybe I walked across that bridge alone, as I had countless times before, and something in my brain suddenly… collapsed.

People started looking at me strangely. Conversations would abruptly stop the moment I entered a room. I noticed my teachers looking at me with concern. My parents began… They made up all sorts of excuses to prevent me from going out with my friends, forcing me to stay home and rest.

Two weeks after that night on the bridge, I stopped mentioning Lucy.

What else could I do?

But I never forgot her. And deep down, I never stopped believing she had ever existed.

After graduating high school, I left Millbrook immediately. I went to two universities out of state, earning a degree in psychology—perhaps to understand what had happened to me, perhaps to prove I wasn't insane. In my junior year, I met George in a cognitive neuroscience class.

George It was reassuring. George was rational and kind and believed in things that could be measured and proven. George didn't believe the fog would devour people, nor did he believe the town would erase the girl's existence. George believed in synapses, neurons, and chemical reactions.

I never mentioned Lucy to him.

A year after graduation, we got married. The wedding was held in court; it was a small affair, attended only by immediate family.

We moved to a suburb forty miles from Millbrook. Close enough to visit, but far enough so I wouldn't have to see the bridge every day. We bought a small house with a yard. George got a job at a research hospital. I opened a private practice, primarily serving teenagers, trying to help them through trauma in ways no one had ever helped me with before.

We had Lucy first (I named her in memory), and two years later, Michael. My love for them was sometimes so intense it frightened me. I would check on them constantly at night, making sure they were still breathing, still real, still around. George thought I was overprotective. He didn't understand how quickly I knew people could disappear.

The nightmare began around the time Michael... It started six months after I was born.

It's always the same dream: I'm pushing a stroller across a bridge. Fog is thick. I look down at the stroller; it's empty. I search in the fog, calling out to my children, but I can't find them. Sometimes in the dream, I'm constantly searching for my children. Sometimes, I'm looking for Lucy. Sometimes, I can't even remember who I've lost, only that they're gone, and it's all my fault.

I wake up with a start, gasping for breath, the sheets soaked with sweat, my heart pounding as if it's going to explode. George will hold me, gently comforting me, saying it's okay, it's just... I dreamt that the children were all fine, and everything would be alright.

But that wasn't the case.

The nightmares grew worse. Three, four, or five times a night. I was afraid to sleep. During the day, I started seeing things too—shadows moving like people, whispers coming from the whirring of the baby monitor. I was playing with the children when suddenly, a strong conviction washed over me: they weren't real, just like everyone said; I was imagining Lucy.

One morning at three, George found me standing by Michael's crib, silently weeping.

"She's real," I whispered. "Lucy is real. I held her hand. I know I did."

"Jen, honey, you need to talk to someone. This isn't healthy."

"I've talked to people. They all say I made her up."

"Then maybe—" He paused, choosing his words carefully. "Maybe you need to accept it. Maybe that's the only way you can heal." “ I looked at him, the man I married, the man with whom I built my life, and felt utterly alone.

“I’ll call tomorrow,” I said. “I’ll seek help.”

Dr. Patricia’s office was filled with the scent of lavender and old books. She was in her sixties, her silver hair meticulously pulled back in a bun, her eyes revealing so much. George had found her online, “the best trauma therapist in the state,” he said.

I didn’t immediately tell her about Lucy. I spoke indirectly about nightmares, anxiety, and the feeling of not being able to trust myself. She listened quietly, without judgment, occasionally taking notes and asking gentle questions.

It wasn’t until the fourth session that she asked, “Jenny, when did these nightmares start? Can you trace them back to a specific event?”"

Suddenly, I told her everything. About Lucy. About the bridge. About the fog. About everyone saying she didn't exist. I talked for an hour straight, pouring out everything I'd suppressed for ten years.

After I finished, the doctor was silent for a long time.

"Do you think Lucy is real?" she finally asked.

"I know she is real. But I also know that all the evidence points to her not. So, maybe I'm going crazy."

"What if you're not crazy? What if something else happened?"

I gave a bitter smile. "Like what? She disappeared from reality? I traveled to a parallel universe? That's no different from admitting you have delusions."

"Memory is complex. Sometimes trauma represses memories, hiding them, making them inaccessible to our consciousness. But they still exist."

"Do you think I have repressed memories?"

"I think it's worth exploring. Would you like to try hypnotherapy?""

I was so desperate I was willing to try anything.

The next session, the doctor dimmed the lights and had me lie on her sofa. She guided me into a hypnotic state with a low, rhythmic voice. I felt myself sinking, layers of consciousness overlapping, like sinking into deep water.

“Back to the bridge,” she said. “Back to that night with Lucy. Tell me what you saw.”

I was there. Not remembering. Experiencing. I was back to being seventeen, in my cheerleading outfit, with Lucy beside me. A thick fog rolled in, unsettlingly thick.

But this time, I kept watching. This time, I didn't forget the moment Lucy's hand slipped from mine.

I saw her being pulled back into the fog. I saw figures moving in the white, not supernatural, but human. I heard heavy, urgent voices.

“Got her.”

“Was it really necessary?”

“You know it was. Her father knows too much. He's been talking to that reporter.” "We can't risk it—"

Lucy screamed. I tried to reach her, but someone grabbed me from behind and held me rooted to the spot.

"She saw it," someone said. It was a woman's voice, familiar, but I couldn't place it.

"Give her the injection. Make her forget."

A sharp pain shot through my arm. The world began to blur and distort.

"Jenny, listen carefully," the woman's voice rang out again, right next to my ear. "You'll forget Lucy. She was never your friend. You don't know a Lucy Thompson at all. You crossed this bridge alone tonight. Can you say it again?"

I heard my own voice, muffled, distant, and far away: "I crossed this bridge alone."

"Good girl. When you wake up tomorrow, it will all be like a nightmare. Lucy Thompson never existed. Her father never existed. None of this ever happened. That's better. Better for everyone. Especially for you." The fog lifted. I stood alone on the other side of the bridge, not understanding why I had collapsed, why my arm ached.

In the doctor's office, I sobbed uncontrollably, my body trembling.

"What did you see?" she asked softly.

"They took her," I gasped. "They took Lucy and made me forget everything. Oh, God..." "They drugged me. They made me forget her."

"Who took her?"

"I don't know. I couldn't see her face. But they knew her father. They said he spoke to a reporter. Talked about something. Something they dared not risk..."

I sat bolt upright, a flood of possibilities rushing through my mind. "They killed her. Right? Because her father knew something. And then they made the whole town forget she existed."

"Jenny, you need to think carefully. The mass memory manipulation you described is scientifically impossible. But trauma can cause our brains to fabricate stories to explain things we don't understand." “You think I’m making this up too.”

“I think you’ve experienced something real and painful, and your brain is trying to process it.” Hypnosis has helped you awaken a repressed memory, but we need to interpret it carefully—”

“I have to go back,” I interrupted her. “I have to go back to Millbrook. Back to that bridge.”

“I don’t think it’s a good time to go back. You’re vulnerable right now—”

But I had already stood up and grabbed my purse. Ten years. I’d spent ten years thinking I was going crazy, thinking I was making up my best friend. But I wasn’t. Lucy was real. And she’d been through terrible things.

I needed to know the truth.

I called George from the car.

“I have to go see my parents,” I said. “Could you babysit the kids for me tonight?”

“Sure. Is everything alright? Did anything happen during therapy?”

“I’m fine. I just… I just need to talk to them. I’ll explain when I get home.”

I gripped the steering wheel tightly, my heart pounding, and drove toward Millbrook. The hypnosis seemed to awaken some kind of memory, fragments flooding back like a tide. Not just memories of Lucy, but also the expressions on my parents' faces that night. There was a hint of guilt in their eyes as they looked at me. Everyone in town quickly rallied, supporting one another.

They knew. They all knew.

As evening fell, I arrived on the outskirts of Millbrook. The town was as usual: neat houses, tree-lined streets, and the white church steeple towering above the shops on the main street. Perfect.

About five minutes from my parents' house, I saw it: Old Miller Bridge.

I hadn't planned to take this route. There was another way to my parents' house, completely avoiding the bridge. But for some reason, my car had brought me here, as if drawn by a force I couldn't understand.

Just then, I saw the fog.

The fog was rising. Thick white fog drifted from the stream below, eerily suffocating. I gasped. I pulled the car over, got out, and stared blankly.

Then it dawned on me: twenty years had passed since that night and twenty years since it appeared.

It's back.

I should have kept driving. I should have gone to my parents' house, confronted them, and demanded to know what had happened to Lucy. That was my original plan. That's why I drove here.

But I couldn't stop staring at the fog, couldn't stop thinking about the legend. The fog that appears every twenty years. That song that supposedly allows you to travel between two worlds.

What if it's all true? What if that night, Lucy and I really did travel to another world? A world where she never existed, a world where her father never existed, a world where the secret they'd always kept never existed. Threatened?

If that's the case, if I really did travel between two worlds, maybe I could go back.

I started walking towards the bridge, my hands trembling. The rational part of me, the part that studied neuroscience with George, that part that built evidence-based medicine systems, was screaming at me to stop. This is madness. Fog is just fog. Parallel universes don't exist. I'm breaking down; I need to turn to help.

But another part of me, the part that never stopped believing in Lucy The sound grew louder.

I stepped onto the bridge.

The fog immediately surged up, enveloping my ankles, waist, and chest. The same biting cold. The same thick, vibrant texture. The world behind me vanished instantly. I couldn't see the town. I couldn't see my car. Nothing but white.

My heart pounded, and I felt like I was about to faint. I started walking forward, my arms outstretched. I groped my way along the railing.

Then I started singing.

My voice sounded strange in the fog, muffled and distant. I kept walking, kept singing, trying to remember all the lyrics. Lucy and I had learned this song in elementary school music class. I couldn't remember why we learned it.

The fog grew thicker. Heavier. I couldn't feel the bridge beneath my feet anymore. I felt nothing but the sensation of falling, a feeling of being destroyed and rebuilt.

The last verse. I sang the last syllable, my voice choking at the final word. Then, only silence, cold, and white remained.

Then, the fog lifted.

I stood on the other side of the bridge. Under the streetlights. On the maple-lined avenue.

But everything was wrong.

Not the kind of catastrophic, earth-shattering thing. Not the kind of obvious, glaring thing. Just… a thousand subtle things hinted at something amiss. The streetlights were the same ones, but for some reason, they were new, the paint fresh, not peeling. The houses in the distance were a different color, and the cars parked in the driveway were different. The air smelled different too, fresher, with a faint floral scent I couldn't quite place.

Lucy was standing under the streetlight, wearing the exact same cheerleading outfit I'd worn ten years ago.

“Jenny!” She rushed over and grabbed my hand. Her face was exactly as I remembered—seventeen, vibrant, real. “Oh my god, where did you go? You just vanished! One second you were beside me, the next you were gone! I was terrified!”

I couldn't say a word; I couldn't breathe. I just stood there, staring blankly at her, tears streaming down my face.

“Jenny? Are you alright? Did you hit your head? The way you're looking at me is so strange.” Her face was full of worry.

I finally found my voice, though it was a whisper. “Lucy. You're here. You're real.”

“Of course I'm real. What happened? What happened in the fog? How long have you been gone?”

“How long?” I asked, half-crying, half-laughing. “How long have I been gone?”

“I don’t know, maybe two or three minutes? But it felt like forever. I couldn’t see you, and I couldn’t hear you. I thought you’d fallen off the bridge, or—” She stopped.

I looked down at myself.

I was wearing my cheerleading uniform. The blue and gold Milbrook High School uniform, with my name embroidered on the front. My legs were bare in the November wind. On my feet were the worn white Nike sneakers I’d worn to practice that night, tied with blue laces. I slowly raised my left hand, terrified of what I would see.

No ring. My fingers were bare. Smooth. Young. “No,” I whispered, “no, no, no.”

My hands trembled as I touched my cheeks. The skin felt different. Smoother, firmer. I pulled out my phone, the phone that should have held photos of Sarah and Michael, George’s text messages, and all the electronic records of my life.

It was the iPhone 5s I’d sold, the lock screen showing a picture of myself at seventeen, grinning at the camera, wearing the same cheerleading outfit. The date was November 15, 2015.

“Jenny, you scared me to death.” Lucy grabbed my arm. “Come on, we’ll walk you home. Maybe you’re having another panic attack. My dad says stress can make people do weird things.”

“Your dad.” I looked up at her, clinging to this detail as if it were a lifeline. “Lucy, what does your dad do? Does he work?”

“He’s a dental assistant at Dr. Morrison’s clinic. You know, you’ve always known. Are you sure you didn’t bump your head in the fog?”

“A dental assistant,” I repeated. Not a homeless man, not the bad guy everyone was whispering about. Just a dental assistant.

“Yeah, he works for Dr. Morrison, the dentist on the street. He’s probably still there packing up. He usually doesn’t get home until late.” Lucy spoke quickly, sounding a little nervous, trying to break the silence, while I just stood there, staring at my bare hands.

“Come on,” Lucy said, tugging at my arm. “I’ll take you home. Your mother knows what to do.”

I let her lead me down the bridge and through streets that looked almost exactly like the Millbrook I knew, but with some differences. A house painted yellow instead of blue. A car that shouldn’t be there. A slightly different street sign.

We walked in silence, Lucy glancing at me anxiously every few seconds. I couldn't utter a word.

Or had I really been here before? Maybe this was my original world. Maybe the past ten years, George, the children, the life I built—it was all an illusion. Maybe that night ten years ago, I crossed that road, and now, I've finally found my way home.

But if that's the case, where is George? Where are my children?

We arrived at my parents' house, or rather, a version of it. Same address, same basic structure, only the blinds were blue instead of white. A different car was parked in the driveway, a silver sedan. Someone I didn't recognize.

Lucy walked me to the door and rang the doorbell.

My mother opened the door, and I almost collapsed to the floor in relief. She looked exactly the same. Maybe a little younger than the last time I saw her, but her eyes were still gentle, her smile still warm. She didn't get cancer when I had my first child; she didn't die…

“Jenny? Lucy? I thought you went straight to Lucy's after practice.” She looked me over carefully, her smile a little stiff. “Honey, are you alright? You don't look good.”

“She was acting a bit strange since the bridge,” Lucy explained. “I think the fog scared her. She's been behaving really oddly lately.”

“Come in, I'll make some hot chocolate.” mom placing a warm hand on my back.

The house felt both familiar and strange. The layout was the same, the basic furniture was the same, but some small details were different. The curtains were different. The paintings on the walls were different. I flipped through my photos, trying to piece together what my life in this world was really like.

In one elementary school photo, I was grinning, with gaps between my teeth. In a middle school photo, I was wearing braces, looking a little clumsy. And in a high school photo, I was wearing a cheerleader uniform, Lucy was next to me, and we were both making faces. But then nothing happened. No college graduation photos. No wedding photos. No pictures of grandchildren for my parents to be proud of. I had to tell myself it was because none of that had happened yet. I was only seventeen. Still in high school. It was just the beginning of my life.

Mom brought us steaming hot chocolate, made the same way I did as a child, with extra marshmallows and a candy cane to stir it. That familiar sweetness made my throat tighten.

“Well,” Mom sat down across from us and asked, “What happened?”

“We were crossing the bridge,” Lucy said. “The fog came in, really thick, Mrs. Paterson. You should see, Jenny’s terrified. She’s starting to ask strange questions, like she doesn’t know where she is.”

“I’m fine,” I managed to say. “It’s just… the fog is terrifying. That’s all.”

Mom reached out and touched my forehead. “You don’t have a fever. But you look tired, honey. When was the last time you had a good night’s sleep?”

I wanted to say, "Six months ago, before the nightmares started." Before I started seeing a therapist. Before I remembered what happened to Lucy, except that it didn’t happen here. Here, Lucy is fine. Here, Lucy never disappeared.

“I’m fine,” I changed my tune. “Just a little tired.”

“Then you should go to bed early. You have school tomorrow.” Mom glanced at her watch. “Your dad will be home soon too. He’s still tutoring students at the high school.”

I froze, my cup still raised to my lips. “Dad…tutoring students?”

“Yes, honey, he goes every Tuesday night. You know that.” Mom smiled lovingly. “That’s the downside of being a teacher, isn’t it? The work is never-ending. He always has to stay behind to help students who are struggling or take homework home to grade. But he enjoys it.”

A teacher. In this world, my father is a teacher.

In my other world, the place I've lived for the past ten years, my father was a policeman. I remember him in his uniform, the static from his radio, and the way he worked late into the night.

But here, he's a teacher. A high school teacher, often staying late to tutor students.

Everything has changed. Not just Lucy. Not just her father. Everything has changed.

“Does your dad know where you are?” Mom asked Lucy. “Should I call him?”

“He’s still at the dentist,” Lucy said. “Cleaning up the last patient’s room. He told me he’d be home late.”

“Your dad is such a hard worker,” Mom said warmly. “Dr. Morrison is so lucky to have someone like him. He’s so kind to his patients, especially the anxious little ones.”

I stared at her. Because in my world, in my other world, Mom always deliberately avoided mentioning Lucy’s father. She always seemed uncomfortable whenever his name was mentioned. But here, she spoke of him with genuine respect and warmth.

“I should go home,” Lucy said, finishing her hot chocolate. “Let Jenny rest. She didn’t sleep well last night.” She squeezed my hand. “Text me later, okay? Let me know you’re okay.”

“Okay,” I said, though I wasn’t sure if I could still say “okay.”

After Lucy left, Mom helped me upstairs to my room—my teenage bedroom, which I hadn’t seen in ten years. The same posters on the walls, the same plush toys on the bed, my cheerleading trophy on the shelf. Everything seemed frozen in the past.

“Sleep well, JenJen,” Mom said, kissing my forehead. “Everything will be alright tomorrow.”

But as she closed the door, I sat on that narrow single bed, and I thought, I have to know. I have to know if George is still…here.

I pulled out my phone, this old phone. I opened the browser. My hands trembled so badly I could barely type.

I searched for George Hend. The man I married. My children's father. The one who stood by me through my nightmares, the one who built my life with me. With me.

No results.

I tried again, adding his middle school and his elementary school. The silly YouTube singing account he used to have as a teenager.

Still no results.

I expanded my search to other cities and other states. Maybe he lives somewhere in the world.

But the more I searched, the clearer it became.

I started searching for Lucy. Searching for Michael. Searching for my children. Searching for my babies. Searching for the two people I love most in my life.

Nothing. Nothing. Obviously nothing.

I sat in my teen bedroom, wearing perfume-scented pajamas, wondering if I was home or if I had left home.
