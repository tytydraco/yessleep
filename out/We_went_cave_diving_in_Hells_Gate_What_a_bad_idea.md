Somewhere past High Springs, we turned off the two-lane highway onto a dirt road that barely counted as a road at all. It led straight into the woods. I was driving while Ry studied a map on his phone.

He’d told me he was bored with Devil’s Den, and the other springs were too crowded this time of year—full of locals trying to keep cool. Hell’s Gate, he said, would be better. Quieter.

I’d never even heard of it. Ry explained it was an underground spring inside a dry cave, like Devil’s Den—but deeper. More dangerous. The site had been closed for decades after several divers got lost and never came back.

That didn’t really scare me. Ry had logged more dives than I could count—caves, wrecks, springs, he’d done it all. I trusted him.

We drove deeper into the woods. Up ahead, a weathered sign came into view:  
**DANGER — KEEP OUT.**

I glanced over at Ry. He just smiled.

“Not if you know what you’re doing.”

A little farther on, we bumped over an old wooden gate that had fallen across the road, half-rotted and eaten through by termites.

The dirt track ended in a small clearing, thick with green ground cover. Ry told me to stop.

I looked around, confused. There was nothing here.

“We’re here,” he said, grinning as he jumped out of the car.

For a second, I wondered if he’d lost his mind. But when we stepped into the clearing, I saw it. An opening in the ground, no bigger than a backyard pool, with stringy vines and moss draping down from the edges.

We crept closer, step by careful step, until we could feel the edge beneath our feet. Peering over, we looked down thirty feet at crystal-clear water.

“Wow,” I said.

The midday sun cut through the opening, lighting the cave below like something from another world. A battered old diving platform floated on the water.

“How do we get down there?” I asked.

Ry poked through the hanging greenery at the rim. After a minute, he tugged out an ancient-looking rope ladder, slick with mold and frayed. Honestly, jumping might’ve been safer.

He let it unroll. It clattered as it unraveled and stopped about four feet shy of the platform.

Ry grinned. “C’mon—let’s get our gear.”

We went back to the car, stripped down to our swimsuits, and hauled our dive gear to the edge. After running through our checks and gearing up, I asked, “So… what’s the plan?”

He winked. “Simple: don’t get lost, don’t die. Ready?”

Ry went first, climbing down the rope ladder. It groaned under his weight, even though he was lean. If there had been solid ground at the bottom, I’m not sure I would’ve followed. But it was water—so I did.

Up close, the platform was in worse shape than it looked. The boards sagged. Some were spongy with rot. It felt like you could fall through in spots.

I gazed at the cavernous space in awe. The sun cut down through the opening like a magic flashlight, revealing submerged cave formations. The sound of dripping water echoed through the chamber.

“It’s like stepping into another world,” I said.

Ry tied the dive line to the platform, checked his gear one last time, and said, “Don’t pet anything with teeth.” Then he pulled on his mask and fins and jumped in.

I followed. My dive light pierced the aquamarine glow. Around me, formations loomed like ruins from a forgotten world.

I was too mesmerized to notice Ry had already disappeared into one of the tunnels. I grabbed the dive line and followed.

Without the sun, the light faded quickly. My dive light sliced through the growing darkness. The only sound was the slow whoosh of my breathing.

I kept one hand near the guide line, letting it drift in the current as the tunnel narrowed.

Then I saw something on the wall to my right. Deep gouges in the stone—long, parallel scratches. Almost like claw marks. Big ones.

I stopped. Stared. What the hell could’ve made those? I tugged the dive line. A moment later, Ry tugged back—steady, reassuring.

Okay, I told myself. I’m just being silly.

I kicked forward.

The tunnel narrowed to a tight squeeze. My gear scraped the limestone. My pulse thudded louder in my ears. That kind of reaction was normal, but that didn’t make it easier. Getting stuck was every diver’s nightmare.

After a few tense seconds, the passage opened. I floated into a vast chamber, far larger than the one above. I swept my light across the void, but it didn’t touch anything. No ceiling. No floor. Just open, black water in every direction.

I wasn’t panicking.  
Not yet.  
But I’d be lying if I said I felt calm.

I wanted to get to Ry. I grabbed the line and tilted downward, then dumped some air from my BCD. My vest hissed softly and I sank deeper into the black. The only light came from my torch, cutting a narrow path through the dark. I kicked slowly, following the dive line through the silent water. The pressure built around me. My breath, loud in my ears now, was the only sound as I descended into whatever waited below.

After what felt like forever, the bottom finally came into view. A wave of relief—at least it wasn’t bottomless. But the moment my feet touched down on the sand, that relief vanished.

Ry’s dive line ended.  
Not gradually.  
It was cut. Clean.

Panic hit. I shouted his name. Pointless. We didn’t have comms. The sound vanished into the water.

I swung my light around, but the visibility was trash. I’d kicked up a thick cloud of silt.

I clenched the line like my life depended on it. I couldn’t let go. But I swept the beam as wide as I could.

That’s when I saw it. Maybe eight feet ahead, a patch of disturbed sand. Something had been there. Something big.

I reached for my backup spool, untied it from my BCD, and tied it to the end of Ry’s line. Just a few more feet.

When I reached the marks, I froze.

They were footprints.  
Not human.  
Long toes. Webbed. Clawed.  
Lizard-like.

**WTF?**

My mind screamed to get out. I yanked myself back to the main line. Kicked hard. I just wanted out.

Then something massive brushed against me.

I felt it—pressure, movement, size. Bigger than Ry. Bigger than me.

I dropped my dive light.

I was alone in the dark. I clung to the line. My light was gone. My breathing turned ragged and loud.

I started following the line back, hand over hand, kicking slowly. Every few feet, I paused. All I could hear was my heartbeat and the hiss of my regulator.

Then I felt it.  
A slight tug on the line behind me.

I froze. Something was back there.

I didn’t look. Couldn’t. There was nothing to see.

I started moving faster, fingers burning on the rope. I kicked harder. Silt clouded around me, but I didn’t care.

The rope shifted again.

A rush of water swept past me—too fast, too strong. Like something huge had glided by. I wanted to scream, but all that came out was a strangled gasp.

I reached the tunnel entrance and was about to pull myself inside when I felt something slimy slide between my legs.

I yanked them up and kicked. My fin struck something solid.

Panic exploded. I thrashed forward.

If I could just reach the squeeze, maybe I’d be safe.

I made it to the narrow part. Too tight for gear. I couldn’t risk getting wedged in.

I took three deep breaths and shucked out of my rig. One final look back.

Nothing but black.

I forced myself into the squeeze. Water dragged at me. The rock pressed in on all sides.

Then—two rough hands grabbed my ankles.

I kicked. Again. Again.

It pulled me back.

My lungs screamed. My chest burned.

Then—  
**Nothing.**

I woke up gasping.

Air. I had air. I was coughing it in like a drowning animal.

I was lying on the platform.

The water around me was still.

And in the shadows beneath the platform, something moved. A head broke the surface. Eyes—too far apart. Slick, scaled skin. Then it slipped back into the depths.

Gone.

I didn’t imagine it. I know I didn’t.

It had saved me.

But why?

Now I’m sitting in my car, shaking. Ry is gone. I should call for help. I know that. But what do I even say?

That we broke into a closed cave system? That we went diving where we weren’t supposed to? That I saw something that shouldn’t exist?

Something that **saved me**?

Who would believe me?
