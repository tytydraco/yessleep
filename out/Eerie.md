I’ve tried to forget, believe me. Tried to shove it down so deep that maybe—just maybe—I could convince myself none of it happened. But memories have a way of crawling back up, like shadows you can't outrun. Especially when you start to realize... maybe it’s not just memories. Maybe it’s more than that. I was a regular kid. Or at least, that’s what I always told myself. My name? It doesn’t matter. Not for this. You only need to know I’m 27 now, and what I’m about to tell you has stuck with me like a cold sweat in the middle of the night. It started early—when I was young, when I thought the world still made sense I think I was wrong.

The first time was when I was nine. I remember the day like it just happened, even though I wish I didn’t. I was in the garden with my grandmother, kicking around this cheap plastic ball. You know the kind—light, flimsy, with Spider-Man plastered across it in bright red and blue. I can still see the colors in my head, how vivid they were in the sunlight. It was a game, just me by myself, launching the ball into the air and waiting for it to come down. Except... it didn’t.  I shot it straight up—ninety degrees, almost perfect—and I stood there, waiting for it to fall back to earth. I waited. And waited. And waited. At first, it didn’t seem strange. I thought maybe the wind had caught it or something. Maybe I wasn’t paying attention, and it had landed somewhere else. But no. There was no wind, not even a whisper of a breeze that day. It was like the ball had just... vanished. I remember the way my heart started racing, how my eyes kept darting around, looking up at the sky, then down at the ground. I felt this weird panic bubbling up, but it didn’t make sense. It was just a ball, right? Just a stupid plastic ball. But as I stood there, staring up at the empty sky, I felt something. A weight, like eyes on me. Like the air had shifted. I couldn’t see it, but I knew, deep down, something had noticed me. Something that wasn’t supposed to be there. My grandmother never even looked up. She called me in for tea, her voice calm, unaware. I didn’t tell her. How could I? How do you explain something like that? I just followed her inside, but I couldn’t shake that feeling. That *thing*... that was still out there, watching.

Waiting.

The second time, it wasn’t something I could write off as a trick of the light. I was older then—twelve. It’s funny, you think as you get older, the world starts to make more sense. You start to piece things together. But that day shattered whatever sense I thought I had. I was living with my stepfather by then, and we didn’t exactly get along. That day was no different. He was shouting at me again, his voice loud, booming, filling up the whole house. I don’t even remember what it was about. Maybe I didn’t do the dishes, maybe I left something out—small things, stupid things. But in that moment, I felt something inside me snap. I wasn’t scared. I wasn’t sad. I was angry. So angry that my chest felt tight, my head hot. I could feel my heartbeat in my ears, could feel my breath coming faster, like the air itself was thinning around me. Then... it happened.  One moment, it was a bright summer day—the kind where the heat sticks to your skin. And then... the sky turned black. Just like that. One second the sun was burning above us, and the next, it was swallowed by clouds that came out of nowhere, thick and dark and menacing. I looked out the window, and I swear it felt like the whole world was holding its breath.  Then the thunder hit, so loud it shook the house. Lightning followed, jagged streaks that split the sky wide open. I looked at my stepfather, saw the fear on his face, the confusion in his eyes, and for the first time... I didn’t feel small.  I felt powerful. It lasted only a few minutes, but I’ll never forget the way the air smelled after—the sharp tang of ozone, the way everything felt charged, like the storm had left its mark. He never shouted at me like that again. I think part of him knew. Maybe he didn’t understand it, but he knew something wasn’t right.

I did too. The third time... the third time was the worst. I was seventeen, on a bus I’d never been on before. I remember feeling... off. Like the world around me was a little too quiet, the colors a little too dull. You know that feeling you get in a dream, where everything feels just a little *wrong*, but you can’t quite put your finger on it? That’s how it was. I sat at the back, staring out the window, not really paying attention to the people around me. But then I saw him. I saw... me. He was sitting a few seats ahead, slouched over, looking out the same window. He had my face, my clothes, my posture. It was me. But it wasn’t a reflection. I wasn’t looking in a mirror. This was real.  I wanted to move, to get up, to go over and say something, but I couldn’t. It was like I was frozen in place. My heart was hammering in my chest, my mouth dry, but my body refused to move. I just sat there, watching this other version of myself, this *copy*, sitting just a few feet away, as if everything was normal.  But it wasn’t.  And the worst part? He didn’t even look back. He didn’t acknowledge me, didn’t see me. But I saw him. I saw myself, living in that moment, in a way I couldn’t.  The bus stopped, and when I blinked, he was gone. I don’t know what’s happening. I don’t know if it’s me, or if it’s something else. But I feel it—every day, creeping closer, slipping into the cracks of my life. I can’t explain it, but I think whatever’s been following me... it’s not done.
