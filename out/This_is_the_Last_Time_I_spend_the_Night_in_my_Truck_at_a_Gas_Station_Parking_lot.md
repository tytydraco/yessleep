When you're camping you sometimes have chance encounters, that's part of the fun of camping. 

I'll never forget the night I met... I don't even know what I met, maybe you can tell me.

I was on my way to visit my parents as I do every year. 16 hours one way, same on the way back.

To be on the safe side, I never made the trip in one go, usually stopping overnight at a freeway service area and sleeping in my truck to save on hotel bills.

This year the trip had started in the same way as usual, comfortably seated with a cushion under my buttocks for comfort, snacks on the passenger seat, and a list of podcast episodes on my phone connected to my car. 

In short, a total blast.

-

Around 7.00 pm, I pulled into the parking lot of a small gas station, in a secluded spot so I could spend the night peacefully.

I was sitting comfortably in the back seat, windows covered for privacy, finishing the instant noodles I'd bought at the gas station store while watching YouTube videos on my phone.

The gas station had a few street lamps scattered here and there, and there was one not far from me whose warm light filtered through the gaps in the window covering

At some point I must have fallen asleep.

-

I woke up in the night.

I looked up to see what had woken me up, but there was no sound outside, not even the wind.

I sat up more comfortably and closed my eyes again, and that's when I heard it.

*knock knock*

Someone was knocking on the rear window right next to my head.

I jerked my head up, thinking I must have been hallucinating. And a few seconds later, the person knocked twice on the window again. What the hell was that? I wondered who could come knocking on the window of a car parked in a gas station parking lot so late.

“He... Hello?” I finally asked.

No answer at first, then a woman's voice: “Do you have a light?”

What? Do I have a light?

“I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

Again, the woman replied: “Do you have a light?”

There was something strange in her voice. She sounded flat. As if she were repeating a memorized text in a foreign language. 

I straightened up, looking out the window. I could see the woman's motionless silhouette thanks to the lamppost that stood at a distance behind her.

“No...” I finally replied. “No, sorry.”

Silence again. 

“Do you have a light?”

Was this a joke?

“Look, I don't have a light, I've already told you, leave me alone, I'd like to be able to sleep in peace, okay? Ask someone else.”

She didn't move from where she was despite my refusal to lend her a light. What was wrong with her?

“Can you lend me your phone?” she continued in the same emotionless voice.

I don't know what she wanted from me, but I could sense that something was wrong with her.

“What for?” I asked to see if her story would hold up.

“For... for... phone”

She just kept repeating “phone“, over and over, in a slow, shrinking voice as if the word was coming from deep in her throat. It gave me goosebumps.

“Stop it alright! I'm not giving you my phone now get out before I call the cops!”

In truth, I'd already reached for my phone, only to realize that I'd drained the battery by falling asleep and leaving it on. I was alone, with no way of calling anyone for help.

Then she started to bash her head against my window while continuing to repeat “phone”.

“Stop it! Hey stop it!” I screamed in panic.

I turned back to the front seat to retrieve the flashlight I'd always kept in the glove compartment, returned to my seat and turned it on in the direction of the window.

Nothing.

She was gone.

*What the fuck, did she just disappear?*

Without getting out of the car, I started to get closer to each window and point the flashlight everywhere just looking for a silhouette, including the ground, to see if she was hiding somewhere, waiting for me to get out. I don't know what had happened, at first I thought maybe it was a bait to lure me out of the car and rob me. 

But now I didn't know what to think, it was just the strangest thing that had ever happened to me and my heart was still racing from the adrenaline.

There seemed to be nothing around the car, at least as far as I could see from inside. The night was calm again, but I still didn't dare go out.

I caught my breath and managed to calm down after a while.

“When I tell my parents about this, they won't believe it”, I muttered.

As I couldn't hear anything, I decided to try to sleep for a few more hours. Even though I didn't have the time on my phone, I could see through the gaps in the windows that it was still pitch dark outside.

I lay down again and tried to sleep, but to no avail. The stress and tension were still coursing through my body too intensely for that.

At some point during the night I sat up after hearing a “pop” and realized that the bulb in the nearest streetlight had gone out.

After about 1 hour I think, as my mind wandered between wakefulness and sleep, I was again disturbed by the same sound at the window, which now had the effect of raising the hairs on the back of my neck.

She was back, I thought to myself.

“Sir, I’m Officer Wake, I've been informed of a disturbance in the parking lot, is everything alright?”

It was the voice of a young man, obviously a policeman.

“Uh” I began, not really knowing what to say. “Yes, well no, no everything's fine, just a lost woman who came to ask me for a light in the middle of the night. But she's gone now, everything's fine.”

“Are you sure, sir?

“Yes, I'm sure. I don't know who called you, maybe someone alerted by the noise and my screams” I said with a laugh, the pressure easing.

“Please step of the vehicle sir I just want to be sure that everything is alright” he asked in an authoritative voice.

“No, no, really, I assure you everything's fine”.

“I said, get out of the vehicule.“

Wow, what the fuck was his problem?

“OUT” he said in a loud voice.

The hairs on the back of my neck were starting to stand up. Something was wrong.

“Where's your car?“ I asked.

No answer.

“Who called you?

Still no answer.

I moved slowly away from the pitch-black window.

With trembling hands, I grabbed the flashlight I'd kept with me, and turned it towards the window.

And there in front of me was the silhouette of the woman. The same one who'd harassed me a few hours earlier.

“Leave me alone!” I screamed.

“OUT”

Like the last time she began to repeat the same word over and over in a slow, shrinking voice. Her voice was now somewhere between that of the police officer she'd imitated I don't know how, and her original voice.

All at once she disappeared and I heard her weight fall on my front hood. This woman, this “thing” was now attacking my car. 

If she couldn't get me out, she was going to force her way in.

I stopped thinking and lunged for the front seat. I grabbed the keys and started the engine.

I still couldn't see anything in front of me because of the window cover on the windscreen, so, despite the fact that I didn't know what I was going to discover in front of me, I removed it.

“She” was standing on her hands and knees on the hood, both hands on the windscreen, her forehead pressed against the glass. She had two pure white eyes, long, dirty black hair that reached down to her feet, and a single white dress that reached down to her ankles for all clothing.

Her wide, inhuman smile began to spread across her face.

I pressed the gas pedal.

The car sped off, she was still standing on the hood, but as I zigzagged I finally managed to knock her onto her side.

I continued straight towards the parking lot exit to get back on the freeway.

Behind me, I could see her silhouette running towards my car, and even over the noise of the engine I could hear her gaunt cries.

-

I drove for about 2 hours on the freeway.

I kept thinking about what had just happened and wondering who she was, and what she wanted from me. I didn't have any answers, but one thing was certain: I'd had a narrow escape.

Eventually the adrenalin left my body, and an intense fatigue overcame me to the point of forcing me to stop. I'd just survived a supernatural encounter, this was no time to die from a car accident.

I pulled into a gas station parking lot.

I leaned my head against the window, just to rest my eyes at first, but 5 minutes later, I was fast asleep.

-

I woke up at the same time as the sun.

I yawned and stretched, glad to be alive after that crazy night and definitely not able to wait to tell my family and friends.

But as I walked around the car to stretch my legs after spending the night inside, I noticed something.

Something that still haunts and terrorizes me every night.

My truck had accumulated a certain amount of road dust, so it was easy to leave marks just by running a finger over it.

And there, right in front of my eyes, I could see that there were fingerprints all over the windows and doors, as if someone had been desperately trying to get inside while I was asleep.

At first I thought it was from the night I'd spent in the other parking lot.

But then I saw them. 

Dozens of bloody bare footprints all around my truck.
