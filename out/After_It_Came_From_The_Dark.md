It doesn't actually seem that long ago. Jacob ran ahead of us and didn't check the wire before jumping the fence. There was a blue spark and he toppled head first to the grass. I remember him groaning.

It was the last Friday of Winter and by quarter to 2am a frost had started to crystal and slithers of fog had gathered and crawled through the paddocks. The air was cold fresh, and wet. Overcast, at least I think it was, but the moon still broke through sometimes. A kind of deep ocean haze rose over the horizon, but it was behind our phone's torchlights as we approached the fence. Jacob's body was more contorted up close. "Shit mate, came a cropper," I said, placing a boot on the wire.

You've probably heard what happened next. It's still a blur, but I'll do my best. So this time I'll include how the others saw it from behind me. 

I do remember that branch breaking, though. Would've been about a hundred metres away, well over the border fence in the thick of the bush. It wasn't loud but you could tell it was loud up close. Then there was a crashing that echoed in the trees, and it stopped, and started again. A bit like it was unsure, sort of. Then everything went silent. 

I looked back at the others.

Robin saw the rest better. She said she saw a faint shadow move in the distance and there were rapid footsteps we all heard, and it was moving so fast that they barely pointed their spotlights down the fenceline, by the time it was close. None were filming, but it was better that way, they all said later, because they preferred forgetting the face that it wore. They saw it less than a blink, but it was still too much. Nothing more than a flash in a dream, Carly was, as only in a dream could something be that hideous.

All black it was, maybe dark grey, and it had the cadaverous stature of a tall old man. But it moved so fast. I barely saw it from behind as it carried Jacob into the black before the hills. Then his scream carried desperate, and it had a Doppler effect. That's how fast it was moving. Must have been several acres away by then. 

And how he kept screaming. Went on for a full minute. And all of a sudden, each scream was the same, meaning the creature must have stopped running. Two loud grunts then resonated, and his voice, fuck me... Jacob, he started screeching. Impossibly loud screeching. It was pure fucking horror. We all started screaming back, but none of us moved. None of us could move. Robin and Carly were crying as they screamed.

So that's where the obsession comes from. The pain he was in those final moments. Crying out in utter agony knowing how hopeless it was. What would you do, if a fate like that fell on your best friend?
Robin, Jacob's sister, was much the same. And she's always been hands on, so, why not. Better done with a partner in crime. I'm the engineering one now, and handles the investigating. These things move locations a few times a year so tracking isn't always easy. She wanted to be a journo back in the day, Robin did, so she's right at home interviewing the locals. And she picked up the computer side remarkably quick. I'm a dope with that stuff.

Last week she found two vanishings on a farm up near the Atherton Tablelands, so today I've been getting the van ready. A week off the road isn't so bad. Fish and chips here have been stellar and the ocean's got a nice glow of an evening. 

The electric traps don't take up too much space. I built a steel chest behind the seats for storage and we've chucked a mattress on top with a few support crates, which do the job. And yes, things do get a bit tricky sometimes, and Robin and I do, on occasion, have sex. Just as friends, though. It helps take the edge off.
Thought we were close last time. Made some adjustments to the traps since then but honestly I'm kind of shooting in the dark here. They move so, so fast. Almost impossible to see. But we did see something, and it only took us six months. Well, Robin did.

Yeah you could say I'm scared. Wouldn't you be? I still don't know how strong they are, so not even sure that our cage is going to hold, if they try anything. They didn't last time, but that was probably because we took them by surprise. Let's hope I assemble it all right. Uncle Tristan reckoned I could build most things fairly well, but this isn't the same.

Robin's having a quick siesta, before tonight, so she's well rested. Feeling a slight edge myself, so might do the same.
