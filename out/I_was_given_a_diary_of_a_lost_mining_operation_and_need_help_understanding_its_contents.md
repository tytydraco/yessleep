Apologies if this isn’t the place for this sort of thing, but I feel as though there’s nowhere else I can turn to with this sort of thing. Everyone else I’ve shown this has either brushed it off as a complete nothing-burger or have accused me of making it up.



For a bit of context, I’m an Archivist- my job is to take literature and make sure it’s preserved for the future. Stuff like court documents, birth certificates, wills- I probably don’t need to explain it, but I’m fond of my job, and it brings me joy when others learn about it.



Recently, my team and I were handed over a lot of documents pertaining to the Everest Mining Operation- Does this ring a bell to anyone? I could’ve sworn there were records about it in the past, but after looking into it, there hasn’t been so much as a news report. Even more curiously, this isn’t a new thing- apparently, this operation has been going on since 1966, which begins to call into question why it took so long for any of us to hear about it.



While much of the documentation was just things such as legal documents and letters shared between various working forces, there was one piece of information that we were handed that immediately caught my eye. Within that cardboard box of papers and blueprints sat a diary, worn from the extreme weather conditions of the mountain the expedition was named after, belonging to one Mr. Alexis Grisnov, the foreman of the entire operation.



It’s considered bad practice to transcribe documents that are meant to be archived. However, given this particular circumstance, I would hazard a guess that the transcription of this diary was an absolute necessity; many pages are worn and faded, the writing barely legible in a majority of the entries. Many parts of it are scribbled out or torn away, like someone had attempted to cover up information that was previously written.



I have spent the better half of two months attempting to restore the diary’s scrawlings, and now, I am presenting what I have restored, even at the risk of my job and, perhaps, my own safety. Everything that you will read in the following passages is undoctored, save any unrecoverable words or sentences- I have written it exactly as it was given to me, though for some parts, I will add an editor’s note to confirm or expand on details written within.



If you have any details on the Everest Mining Operation, or on Mr. Alexis Grisnov himself, perhaps even on the other members of his team, I would not hesitate to get in contact with me. I hope to continue my studies into this mystery as soon as possible.



With that being said, please read further.

**March 17th, 1966**

Camp has finally been set up. The team’s settling into the new location, though the ‘settling’ seems to be slow. 18 people sharing two bunkhouses in below-freezing temperatures has certainly rattled them, but outside of a few complaints, no one seems to be losing morale.



Mount Everest is a beautiful location. When I received word that I was to lead a team into an excavation, I had initially turned down the offer. Two hours of convincing and 15 grand for myself and the rest of my team is why I’m here.



We still have to wait for the rest of the machinery. I’ve been told it should be delivered over the course of the next 48 hours, save any delays due to weather or circumstance. Rations will be delivered every other day, and fresh clothing and luxuries every other week.



I’m not sure what we’re expected to be mining for. They said just to dig until the higher-ups were satisfied, so that’s exactly what we’re going to be doing.

---

**March 20th, 1966**

The excavation is officially underway. Surprisingly, it’s been going without a hitch so far, though it has only been two hours. The drill head has been catching a bit, though we were told to expect that, considering the frozen earth and rock.



Another issue we’ve been running into is snow. We’re about 5000ft up, if I had to make an estimate- our camp is around 4500ft, set up on a flat part lower down. You can see it from the site we’re mining out- the floodlights set up outside make a warm, yellow glow. It’s quite a nice view.

---

**March 28th, 1966**

Work continues to progress slowly. Unlike a usual operation, we’ve been having to stop and start a lot more than usual- the rampant snowfall we’ve been getting recently has us having to dig our way through to the drill every morning, and that takes a good chunk out of what little daylight we get up here.



It’s not just the weather that’s freezing, either. The drill head keeps freezing over, the floodlights are flickering from the cold- most of my crew spend their breaks huddled around a heater in the bunkrooms, when they’re not actively downing coffee to stay warm. I’ve pushed for our supplier to get us heat packs or insulators- he came back with thicker gloves and an apology.



What do they expect us to do if we’re too cold to move?

---

**April 9th, 1966**

I’m beginning to think that there’s nothing of interest up here. We’ve mined almost a mile into the mountain at this point, and we’ve not come across anything particularly interesting- not so much as a gas pocket, let alone the ‘valuables’ that the higher-ups are badgering me about.



On top of that, a lot of the team are beginning to get the cold shoulder- no pun intended. Their work has become sloppy- I had to scold the support welder yesterday on how shitty his bolting was. Entire thing looked like it was about to collapse.

---

**April 12th, 1966**

Well, that ‘nothing’ didn’t last long. We found something today- or, rather, the drill did.



The boys came running to fetch me as I was taking stock of the supplies to tell me about it. After hurrying in alongside them, they brought me into this large open crevice that the drill had conveniently carved straight into- A huge pocket of some sort of reddish crystal. Some sort of ruby, perhaps? We took a sample back to the camp to have Jonesy look over. He’s been itching to do something useful since we got here.

---

**April 13th, 1966**

I was right on the money. We’d carved headfirst into a cavern of rubies. I think that technically makes our team the first to ever do it? It appeased the higher-ups, anyway- we got a telegram basically saying ‘good job, keep going’. Not sure why that wasn’t enough, but I guess they must think we’re on the right track to finding something more useful.



**(Editor’s Note:** By all geological accounts, this is impossible. Mount Everest is located in the Himalayas; there have been no accounts of naturally occurring ruby anywhere in this location, to the best of my research.)

---

**April 30th, 1966**

I don’t get what’s going on with the mining team at the moment. I don’t know if it's the cold or being bundled up with each other for two months, but a lot of them are getting irritable, and that’s making them lazy. It’s like they’ve forgotten how to use a goddamn pickaxe.



The Head Miner, Koloskiwtz, thinks it might be a good idea to give everyone a break for a week or two. I reminded him that his team has been sitting on their asses for the past month- It’s been my team that have been doing the heavy labour which, might I add, we’re still doing- the Drill’s been working overtime recently thanks to the softer rock, so we’re carving towards the other side of the mountain to see if there’s anything else on this layer.



Needless to say, companionship has been difficult. I’m hoping that we can all just put this behind us and work as normal.

---

**May 12th, 1966**

Fucking stupid dumbasses, every single one of them. The Drill’s fucked! I don’t know if it was a blown fuse or what, but all I know is one of Koloskiwtz’s braindead rookies decided to drive OUR Drill straight into a chunk of black rock and completely fuck it.



Three of the Mining Team were injured because of the resulting shrapnel, too. Four others are threatening to quit over ‘unsafe working conditions’- unsafe conditions that THEY CAUSED, but I digress. I told Koloskiwtz not to mess with the Drill, because I knew that the rock we’d found was far too dense, and to let Jonesy figure out what we’d need, but no- he’d assumed he knew better than his own superior, and now we’re gonna be delayed THREE WEEKS because of his error.



All this on top of us not having heard back from the higher-ups in a week, as well. I’m at my wick’s end, here- my team’s about ready to start swinging, and I need to be the voice of reason, despite me probably being the angriest of them all.



Whatever. At least this gives us some time to collect everything we can for the next supply drop. I’ll see if I can put in a complaint about these windows on the bunkhouses, too- damn things keep opening in the wind.

---

**May 29th, 1966**

Still no word back on the new Drill Head. You’d think the temperature would be getting warmer by now, but if anything, it feels like it's been getting colder.



Koloskiwtz isn’t talking to me. We got into a massive argument about the operation yesterday- he wants to cut our losses and go, while I’m firm that we just have to wait. We’re still getting regular supplies, and it’s not like anybody has anything serious- a few colds here and there, but no frostbite or infections.



My team are still in high spirits, despite everything. Though, I think that may be because they don’t have to do anything thanks to the broken drill- the mountain’s been calmer than usual, so they’ve been able to scout out a possible new location for the drill to continue once it’s fixed.



Speaking of, Jonesy finally got back to me on the rock we’d found in the tunnel- apparently, it's some sort of superdense black ice, as he explained to me. Chances are, we wouldn’t be able to get through it, even with the toughest drill on the market.



I actually went back to look over it a few days ago. Like everything else up here, it was quite beautiful, if not a bit unnerving to see how dark it was inside.

---

**June 11th, 1966**

I fired Koloskiwtz today.



There’s a lot of things I can put up with. I can forgive the error of the drill breaking, despite how pissed I was at the time, because I assume he’d done so in genuine error rather than malicious action. I can forgive the constant snide comments towards my leadership, or the few direct insults tossed towards me about my ‘treatment’ of his team.



I can even forgive the possibility that he’s been spreading rumours to my team behind my back. But there’s one thing I can NOT forgive, and that is putting not only MY team, but HIS team in danger for the sake of his own skin.



I was doing a stock check today, mostly out of boredom, when I discovered that an entire crate of rations had gone missing. Each supply drop, we’re given a crate of enough meals to feed 18 people for two days- lo and behold, one of the leftover crates we’d been keeping in case of emergency was gone.



Naturally, I freaked out, grabbing every single member of the operation and got them searching for it. Lo and behold, someone ends up finding that crate smashed and hidden under Koloskiwtz bunk; and the worst part is, he tried to furiously deny it was him, too, leaving me no choice to take action. I fired him on the spot- the higher-ups agreed with my decision, and now, he’s on a one-way trip back to the company so they can figure out if his lying ass deserves to still be a part of this.



In truth, I was going to fire him anyway. It was brought to my attention that the order for the new Drill Head had never been placed- and guess whose responsibility that was supposed to be?



(**Editor’s Note:** After reading this passage, I attempted to locate Mr. Koloskiwtz to see if they were able to provide me with any further information. Unfortunately, this proved futile, as Mr. Koloskiwtz died in 2017 due to natural causes.)

---

**June 13th, 1966**

Another day, another reprimanding of Koloskiwtz’s previous team. This time, the dumbasses decided it might be a good idea to piss about around our communications relay, and what a Surprise! The fucking thing’s busted now, too.



Thankfully, this one should be an easy fix- my boy Terrance is our maintenance guy, and he’s worked with relay towers since he started his career. After he figures out what’s wrong with it, it should be back up in a few hours.

---

**June 14th, 1966**

The Mining Team has been defying orders a lot more, recently. Seems the departure of their boss is making them think they can get away with whatever they want- well, today, that kind of thinking came back to bite us.



I don’t know which one of them thought they could get away with it, but today, all eight of them locked themselves in their bunkhouse. The leader, some prick named Sheffield, is claiming this is a Strike; they’re not coming out until they’re allowed to head home. I thought that would be the end of it, but now they’ve got the gall to start stealing supplies, too- food, water, any leftover booze. Even now, I can hear them throwing a party in there, the fucking parasites.



So, on top of waiting for this stupid Drill Head, I’m now in charge of babysitting a group of children and forcing my team to keep an eye on any supplies so they don’t try and steal it. I swear to God, I’m this close to busting that door down and taking a pickaxe to the first sorry son of a bitch who tests me.

---

**June 19th, 1966**

Guess who came crawling out of his little base of operations with his tail between his legs? Poor, pathetic Sheffield.



Turns out, not having anyone with any technical experience was a huge problem, because their heater broke down. They had attempted to bear it for as long as they could, but one long night later, three of the eight of them had severe frostbite, and the other five were shivering like trees in the wind. On top of that, their window wasn’t shutting properly, due to a broken latch on the shutter. Probably them horsing about and knocking it loose, knowing them- all of them deserve what was coming to them.



Sheffield practically begged me to forgive him, saying shit like ‘he won’t do it again’ and ‘it was a spur of the moment’. I ever-so-politely reminded him that he was not in charge, and forgiveness is EARNT, not given, and that he and his team were getting their lazy asses back into those tunnels and mining their way to forgiveness.



Unfortunately, the three who got frostbite had to be sent back home, so we’re down another three people. Honestly, it serves them right- no one gets to just decide they’re better than the rest of us.

---

**July 1st, 1966**

I had assumed my problems were over when Sheffield’s little strike had disbanded, but turns out, I’m the fool for believing any of them had any amount of humility left.



Last night, one of them decided it’d be a funny prank to bang loudly on the bunkhouse windows, screaming and yelling like death themselves were at the door. My first thought, of course, was that they were in trouble- despite my previous attitude, I do still believe they deserve to live- and had half-expected to run into the team’s bunkhouse and witness a bloodbath. 



And what did I find? Not a goddamn thing. All five of them were panting and yelling and trying to convince me that SOMETHING had entered the bunkhouse through the window and was this, and that, and whatnot.



Sure, I’m not the smartest man. I’d believe that, if we’d seen anything other than the people that were a part of the operation, but yet again I was a fool for ever believing they had good intentions. One circle around the campsite, which yielded no footprints, no signs of forced entry, not even a missing ration, and I was led to believe it had all been some huge, elaborate prank.



I despise these stupid children. I must’ve yelled at them for 30 minutes straight, all the while the rest of my team had to skip sleep because of Sheffield and his gaggle of morons. It’s no wonder that so many things have been going wrong- how the higher-ups ever trusted a bunch of inexperienced, brash, arrogant little shitstains like them was beyond me.



I’m writing this at 2 in the morning. If one of those windbags so much as BREATHES in my direction tomorrow, I’m gonna pop a blood vessel.

---

**July 4th, 1966**

They’re gone. The last of Koloskiwtz’s team- they’ve vanished.



My team awoke that day to the sound of silence on the snowscape. After getting ourselves ready to fight the cold for yet another day, we’d gone to wake them up, only to find their bunkhouse ransacked- it looked like they’d scattered to the wind, taking anything they had with them.



To say I’m disappointed is an understatement, but in a way, I can see why it happened. At the same time, however, I feel as though I’m not entirely to blame- sure, I was harsh on them, but they had driven me to that point. Perhaps if they’d done their jobs instead of trying to make mock-strikes and joking about a forced entry, they’d be treated like the rest of my men, but they had to clown around and find out that I don’t take disobedience lightly.



I put in a request for a new mining team with the higher-ups. Hopefully they’ll arrive alongside the new Drill Head that still hasn’t arrived.

---

**July 11th, 1966**

We haven’t heard back from the higher-ups in a week. The Communications Relay is working- we know it is, because we’ve been sending Telegrams regularly- but for some reason, they’re just not responding. No new Drill Head, no new mining team- and most importantly, no new delivery.



Our supplier didn’t arrive last night. Usually, he just leaves a box for us to pick up, but there wasn’t so much as a deformation where such a box would be sitting. Thankfully, we have more than enough supplies to get us through, considering our ration consumption has been halved.



I’m gonna give it a few days and try again. Until then, I’ve been taking my team into the tunnels to collect the rest of the ruby. After all, who else is going to except us?

---

**July 19th, 1966**

I swear I saw something standing outside the bunkhouse window last night. I tried to trace any possible sighting, but I saw nothing. I woke up first this morning- I know it can’t be one of the others, because they were all sound asleep, and none of them looked like they’d been out there.



I was probably just seeing things. It was dark, and the floodlights have been on the fritz. No use thinking about it- we’ve got bigger things to worry about.



(**Editor’s Note:** Before the second paragraph of this entry, the words ‘what could it have been’ was written, but with several lines crossed through them.)

---

**July 21st, 1966**

Jonesy’s gotten sick. He’s been obsessing over that patch of superdense black ice in the tunnels, and I think the cold finally caught up with him. Now he’s stuck in bed as the rest of us try anything we can to contact the outside world.



Terrance informed me that the Communications Relay has been down since early June. I thought he repaired it? He told me he had, and he told me it was working- how have I been sending Telegrams if that wasn’t the case?



The lack of any order is starting to irritate me. Do they want us to come back? Where’s the supplier? Why aren’t they trying to get anyone else to find us?

---

**July 24th, 1966**

Another one of the team’s done a runner. I’d never taken Owens as a quitter, but sure enough, this morning he was gone too. Clear signs of which path he’d taken, too, which mean it must’ve been pretty recent.



Jonesy’s starting to get worse, too. He’s coughing really badly, and I think I can see blood in the tissue he’s using. When he’s not puking, he’s sleeping, and even that’s filled with pained breaths.



A blizzard is coming. Terrance says he can see it on the horizon, and it won’t be long until it’s on top of us. How long it’ll last for, he doesn’t know.

---

**July 25th 1966**

I saw it drag him back into the tunnels.

---

**July 30th 1966**

Last night, we made the only plan we could think of- four of the team will head back down to try and find someone to help, while the rest of us stayed behind and waited for rescue. That meant me, Jonesy, Terrance and Hansel would stay, while the rest of them would go. I didn’t decide that- we drew straws.



They’ve been gone an hour, and I already fear the worst.

---

**August 9th 1966**

jonesy is dead- covered in black ice 



hansel took him out to bury him and he didnt come back 



terrance and i are hiding in the bunkhouse

---

**August 11th 1966 - August 19th 1966**



**(Editor’s Note:** the next six discernable passages were almost completely untranslatable. Thousands of hastily scribbled notes, mostly of hunger and dread, spirals and strange, almost runic patterns were all that covered them.)

---

**August 21st 1966**

it got inside last night- terrance is gone



i think its looking for me. it keeps saying my name



why does it sound like him why WHY WHY DOES IT SOUND LIKE KOLOSWITZ



cant breathe. air is too cold



made of black ice i think- can’t see anymore. too much snow



someone please help me

---

Unfortunately, this was the final entry of the diary. As explained before, I have been scouring the internet for any amount of information pertaining to this operation, but anything I’ve found was a false lead or was completely fruitless.



If you know anything about this case, then please, contact me. I have no idea what to make of what I’ve been provided, but I felt it was necessary to expose due to the implications of the writing.



I hope to have an answer for you soon, if there’s any at all. Thank you for reading.
