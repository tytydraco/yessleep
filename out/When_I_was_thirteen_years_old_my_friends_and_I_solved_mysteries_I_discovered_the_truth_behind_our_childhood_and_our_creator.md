It was getting harder to tell fiction from reality. 

Middleview was a lie, and I wasn't a doll. 

I was a real girl, torn from my [strings. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/9fBBNrNfvA)

And yet, somehow, I didn't *want* reality. 

The creator’s of Marin's puppet show were tracking me down. 

I had been dragged into a game of cat and mouse, and I was losing.  

The woman who attempted to kidnap me had hunted me down across town, cornering me in a gas station bathroom.

*I didn't want reality.* 

Reality was pain throbbing in the back of my head, a suffocating pressure induced by Dr. Delaney dragging me down a constant, never ending memory lane. 

Reality was bleeding out, crouched in a gas station bathroom, knees tucked to my chest, blood-slicked hands over my mouth. 

Four walls of white. 

Four walls that reminded me of the workshop where I was created, my second life as Marin's beginning. I could see myself as a mindless, limbless doll, a torso with no mouth yet. The figure looming over me held red thread in one hand, a pair of scissors in the other. I saw her manicure, pastel pink nails, as she ran the blade down my torso with precision,  stitching me back up with new strings. 

*“Pretty, pretty, pretty!”*
 
Blinking against the memory, I pulled away from it, heaving out a breath into my palm. My mind was a rewinding video tape, and the further it plunged me, my body was starting to deteriorate. 

If I concentrated, I was back inside Middleview. 

The lights were brighter, colors blurred together, neon reds and blues making me dizzy. 

It was always  the summer before our sophomore year. 

Noah, bathed in rich red light, his head tipped back, a playful grin spread across his lips. That night, I couldn't seem to stop looking at him. Maybe it was his stupid laugh that vibrated his body, or his smile that turned heads, wide eyes shining with glee in our post-mystery afterglow.  

*“Marin?”* Noah’s voice was an echo in my mind. 

I lifted my head, my thoughts dancing. 

I wanted to stay there. 

Why couldn't I *stay*? 

I could taste blood in my mouth, rusty change stinging the back of my throat. 

His eyes darkened suddenly, and above me, the lights flickered white. Tipping my head back, the gas station bathroom was bleeding back into view, clashing with rich neon. Noah was standing over me, lips curled into a scowl. His hair caught the light, bathing him in dizzying red. I could see them again. 

Lines slicing through the air, slicing through him. 

Strings holding us all together.

Aris’s head dropped. Then May’s. 

I could feel them, writhing under my skin, entangling around me. 

Noah leaned forward, the world around us crumbling through, my mind deteriorating, thoughts dancing. 

The gas station lights blinded me, casting him in almost heavenly light. 

“What the fuck are you doing?” 

Noah’s expression faltered when his strings pulled him back. 

“She's coming!”

Awareness slammed into me, almost sending me toppling off of the toilet seat. 

My eyes flew open, a scrunched up piece of toilet paper slipping from my hands. 

I could hear her. 

The *click-clack* of her heels cleared the fog from my eyes. I pressed pressure to my mouth, muffling a cry. 

She had found me. 

Middleview bled away, and I squeezed my eyes shut. My friends were dead, moulded into cruel puppets made of flesh and bone wearing their faces. 

I knew from a recently dug up memory that they had managed to escape, but where were they? The adult versions who grew up with me, graduated with me, and were ultimately kidnapped and turned into Marin's Middleview Four… 

Where were the ones who grew up?

I knew who I was. 

I was Eve, a faceless, and *real* girl from a corrupt town that let a child rip me apart and stitch me back together with pretty eyes, and a grinning smile. 

I knew who I was—or at least who the start of me was. 

All I had to do was delve into who the others were. 

Which was dangerous territory. 

Ever since Dr. Delaney put my mind in permanent rewind, I was struggling to tell reality from fiction. Blinking up at Noah, I felt a rush of warmth in my chest. 

Who *was* he? I had seen pieces of him in my old life. The stubborn, hard faced boy who happily exposed a town full of corruption in front of our graduation class. Marin had modelled him into her idea of the perfect boy. 

Looking at him, caught between fiction and reality, my imaginary friend who was more of an enigma than the real thing, I wondered who he really was. 

Is this who Noah Prestley was bleeding into? Eyes pinched around the edges, a haunted vacancy to them, and yet a lopsided smile that meant something to the faceless real girl. Eve cared about him. I had my personality, my life, everything I was, wiped away.

But whatever she felt for him, was still swollen in my heart. I had already seen pieces of the boy cruelly stitched into the mayor’s son, a seventeen year old rebellion, whose past was startlingly similar to the fictional Noah Prestley. 

This more had an almost feral gleam in his eye, his spontaneous decisions putting us all in danger. 

Marin had taken all of that, all of him, and twisted him into her own fairytale. 

“Marin! I know you're in here.”

The doll’s name caught me off guard, pulling me back to fruition, my body jolting. I had to squeeze my knees tighter to my chest. Noah disappeared, shattering along with the splinters of Middleview I was still clinging onto. 

Reality crashed through. Literally. 

The sound of the bathroom door flying open sent me into fight or flight. 

I was half conscious, blinking rapidly against a relentless thickening fog blurring my vision. 

There were bloodied tissues covering the floor, but I couldn't move to hide them. 

The woman took her time, her heels clicking across marble. 

“I really wish you didn't run away,” she said in a sigh, slamming her heel into the first stall. I kept my head down, my eyes squeezed shut, pressing pressure over my mouth. “Marin, your mother has done so much to protect you from your creator, and you run *away*?”

She let out a light laugh.

“When will you get it in your *head* that there is nowhere else to go?” 

I stifled my breaths against my knees. 

It would only take one glance for her to see the pooling red splattering white tiles. 

“It was a… *terrible* tragedy! Oh, the town wept for those pesky kids meeting an untimely demise. I heard your real mother left town.” The woman dramatised a sob, emphasising her words with another violent kick. “But. The Middleview Four do not die, Marin.”

BANG. 

The second stall was kicked open. 

She was getting closer, and with every step, every click of her heels on marble, I was slowly lowering myself, getting ready to run. 

“All of you are important to your creator! You are her *dolls*, after all.”

She cleared her throat, her heels suddenly pivoting under the gap in the door. “What if I told you I could take you to your three friends, right now?” 

Her voice was silky smooth, almost hypnotising. 

“I don't mean Marin's little puppet show! Peter Young’s remnants are in my car. I can't stand to look at him. Children can do the cruellest things.”

Her heels backtracked, away from the door. 

“I can take you to them,” the woman said, and my breath caught in my throat. She was talking about them as if they were alive, like they were in reach. 

“Believe it or not, your friends have been in plain sight this whole time! I mean, I can't say you'll like what you find, but that's what you want, right?”

I could sense her moving closer, clacking heels turning playful. 

“You just want to see them! Whatever state they're in.”

“Don't you *dare*.” 

The voice was warm and familiar. It sounded like home. Aris Caine stood in front of me, his arms folded. 

My imaginary friends had a habit of popping out of nowhere. His fifteen year old Middleview self was younger, like a golden retriever, sandy blonde hair hanging in his eyes. Marin's creation was more akin to a modern Ken doll. 

His eyes were not what I expected, a darker, more haunted glint. 

“That crazy bitch is lying,” he said, “Obviously.”

“Urgh. For the first time in my life, I agree with you.”

Noah Prestley was leaning against the rattling door, head tipped back, eyes closed. “We’ve established that somehow we managed to escape the facility,” he murmured, “But the question is, why did Delaney help us get out, and where are we now if we’re not dead?” the boy groaned, catching my eye. His attitude had changed. The mayor’s son looked as clueless as I felt. 

For the past few days, he had been fifteen steps ahead of me and my thoughts, somehow knowing exactly what I was looking for. This time, Noah had no idea. I couldn't decide whether to be smug or scared. “Your subconscious sucks. I know as much as you, and your deteriorating brain having a meltdown isn't helping.”

Aris shrugged, his lips curving into a smile. “At least we’re alive, right?”

I opened my mouth to reply, before realising I was talking to myself. 

“Well?” the woman said from the other side. I caught May’s wince when she came close to the door. “What do you say? Are you going to come out, or do I have to ruin another pair of my shoes?” 

Aris took slow steps back. “Fuck. Do you think she'll break the door down?”

“Definitely,” Noah straightened up. “Which means we need to do this now.”

The mayor’s son ducked in front of me, his eyes drinking all of me in. He didn't like being in the dark. My subconscious was getting increasingly impatient. 

“Do you want to know where we are?” 

The tips of his fingers danced across my temples. I couldn't feel them, but I could imagine them. Noah held my gaze. 

“Do you want to know *who* we are? Because this could, uh, definitely kill you. Delaney fucked with your brain, and I don't think another memory dive is going to help,” his head whipped around when the door rattled, his expression twisting. 

He was as desperate as me, my subconscious mind trying to solve the mystery of himself. 

Even as my subconscious, though, I knew my imaginary friend was something else. 

He wanted answers. 

Why he existed, and what happened to the boy who was twisted and contorted into Marin's fantasy. The mayor’s son was slowly bleeding into this nameless, faceless boy. Noah was never impatient, never desperate enough to risk my life. 

“But.” Noah whispered, his voice growing louder in my skull. I blocked out the violent kicks into the door.

“Don't you want to risk it?”

Yes. 

Noah broke out into a smile. “Okay. Concentrate. Your mind is pulling you in different directions, but you should be able to control where it takes you.”

He closed his eyes, and I followed suit. 

He was so warm, his breath tickling my face. I could almost mistake him for being real. I was half aware of the door breaking open, but I didn't see red heels striding through. Noah jumped back, cursing, Aris and May stumbling into the door. Electroshocks rattled my skull, warm red seeping down my chin. 

I knew I needed to run, to get out of there. 

But my vision was blurring, my head lolling, white walls swimming in and out of view. 

Reality was getting easier to let go of, like plunging into the ocean. 

But this time I forced myself further. 

Deeper. 

Shadows filled the stall, one in paticular ducking in front of me. 

I was already falling, just like always, plunging without an anchor, my grip on the real world fraying, like my strings. 

*“Eve?”*

The voice was a shadow, an echo creeping in. 

Bright light greeted me. 

I was standing in an elementary school classroom, and in my hand was what looked like a brightly coloured book. 

The book was homemade, put together with bright paper and kid’s drawings. 

I had an audience of a dozen wide eyed little kids, all of whom were wearing masks. 

Mr. Pembroke had hated us since *we* were little kids. 

I could tell the teacher was revelling in delivering our punishment.

“Eve, would you like to start reading?”

The others stood either side of me. Noah looked bored, jumping up and down on his heels, while May and Aris entertained the little kids with smiles. 

I caught Noah’s wink. I gave him a slight nod. If we had to endure some stupid punishment for being caught in Sherif Hammond’s office, then so be it. 

After all, it's not like we planned to be caught. 

Planned to be given community service, which we *knew* would be storytime with the group of kids who didn't make sense. 

Twelve kids with forced birth records, who were ageing at an unnatural rate. 

Clara Little, the redhead with ribbons in her hair, was supposed to be two years old. 

So, why did she look like a ten year old? 

Aris nudged me, and I cleared my throat, opening the book. 

“The Adventures of The Middleview Four,” I read out, projecting my voice. 

“Written and illustrated by Marin Delaney.” 

I turned to the first page, and the little kids started to murmur in excitement. 

“Marin was playing in the sand, one sunny afternoon,” I said, my voice catching, “When an, um, an evil… milk thief struck her school, stealing everyone's milk away!” I couldn't help skim-reading through the text. *Milk thieves, evil janitors with mysterious bags of white powder, and a carrot stealing pensioner who held our heroes hostage with a world war two grenade…*

“Wait.” Noah was flipping through his own copy of the book. He raised a brow. “Is this fucking book about *us*?”

One of the little kids huffed. “That's a bad word!”

Noah licked his finger, violently flipping a page. “Oh, shut up, you don't even care about this stupid book,” he grumbled, skimming through later chapters, “I don't care how old you are, this is blatant copyright infringement.”

“Mr Carrington,” Pembroke warned. 

Aris nudged me. “Rich private school kid with a British accent,” he whispered. “Is that supposed to be me?”

“Read!” 

“Why should I?” Noah shot back, and a little boy started crying. He held up the book, waving it manically. “When were you planning on telling us that you wrote a kids novel based on our lives?” 

Stabbing at chapter six, Noah scowled. “Did you know I almost died during case four? Lady Thorn kidnapped me and strung me up in the sawmill, and you turned it into a fucking kids book?”

“That's three more days of community service.”

The boy scoffed, flipping through the book. “Noah Prestley is a stupid name.”

“Four more days.” the teacher’s expression didn't waver. “Do you want to go for five, Mr Carrington, or are you finished insulting a group of children?”

Noah shrugged. “It's not my fault the main character is named after a fish.”

I had to press my lips together to avoid laughing. 

May was already losing, pressing the book over her face. 

“*Five* more days of community service!” 

“Jaz.” Aris gritted out, elbowing the boy. “Just read the freakin’ book.”

He did, rolling his eyes and groaning through the whole chapter, adding his own commentary, which included a more realistic approach to each case.

“It's not white powder, kids, it's called cocaine,” Noah ignored the teacher’s curled lip. If I had to guess, he was trying to push the guy to his limit. 

Pembroke left the room eventually, excusing himself. 

The teacher made it clear with dagger eyes not to move a muscle, and continue reading. We did. The four of us got all the way to chapter eleven, the string murders, when Noah slammed the book shut. 

“They're asleep,” he announced, nodding for May to turn out the lights. 

“Fucking finally.”

Aris threw a pencil at him, which thankfully hit the carpet with no noise. 

“Finally?” the boy laughed. “You spent the whole time insulting a little girl’s story.”

“Uh, yeah. Because it was a word-for-word copy of our lives.”

“Shush!” May pressed her finger to her lips. 

I was already moving toward the door at the back of the classroom. 

Mr. Pembroke’s office was impossible to get into usually. 

Aris grabbed the bag he'd hidden behind the door, pulling out four flashlights. “We don't have long,” he murmured, jumping up, his flashlight beam dancing across the back wall, illuminating a dozen sleeping figures. 

May pulled out the keycard she’d grabbed from a janitor. The light on the door flashed green, and we were in. 

Aris headed in first, then Noah, with me and May bringing up the rear.

Pembroke’s office was…an office. There was nothing spectacular about it.

Slumping into his chair, I checked out his ancient laptop, while Noah and Aris searched through the avalanche of papers on his desk, their flashlights bouncing around the room. May ducked next to me, pulling open a drawer. 

“Bills, bills, and more bills,” she hummed through a mouthful of flashlight. “Wait.” May held up a piece of paper, “This looks like a group of subjects,” she spat out her flashlight. 

“All born in 2011. They don't have names, but they are numbered zero point one to zero point ten.” 

“So, Pembroke is experimenting on kids?” Noah said, fumbling around the bookshelf, lifting books. “That doesn't surprise me,” he lifted his head. “Still though, why were Sheriff Hammond and the high school principal’s names on that creepy list of benefactors?” his eyes widened. “We know about Hammond’s side hustle, but why endorse human experimentation?”

May sat on the edge of the man's desk, swinging her legs. “What are they experimenting on, though?"

“Clones.” Noah whispered excitedly. “I bet it's clones!”

“There's nothing in here,” Aris said, leaning against the wall. “In fact, this is the kind of place Pembroke would *want* us to find, right?” He shot us a grin, striding over to the bookcase. “What are the chances of our old elementary school teacher having a secret hidden room in his squeaky clean office?”

“Close to zero,” Noah said, flipping through a box of files. 

Aris didn't reply, jerking the neck of a ceramic pig, triggering the bookcase standing against the wall to slide aside, revealing a tunnel. Noah jumped up, his eyes wide, lips spread out on a grin. 

“Holy shit.” he dropped the papers in his hands. “How did you even find that?”

“Pembroke couldn't keep his eyes off of this little guy earlier. I figured it was significant,” he pulled a face, “Either that, or that teacher has a weird fetish.”
 
“Let's go,” May murmured, sliding off of the desk. 

Venturing into the tunnel, our flashlights revealed old red ingrained into brick.

Paint. 

*Definitely…paint.*

Noah’s flashlight beam bounced across the wall. I kept to his side. I liked his smile, the light that danced in his eyes. 

Reaching the end of the tunnel, however, his smile crumpled. 

Entering a room, I could only describe it as a nursery. The light was a warm blueish colour, a large glass tank taking up half of the room. Aris was already pressing his face against the glass, peering at tiny faces on the other side. 

Babies. I was going to say they were so cute, because they were. At first glance. 

But something stopped me in my stride, a slimy paste creeping up my throat. 

When I looked closer, these babies didn't have mouths. 

I thought it was a trick of the light, but after squinting, I took them in properly. Twelve babies strapped into individual cribs. They looked human at first, but their tiny faces seemed to… stop. 

Instead of a mouth, gnawing darkness enveloped their heads. I should have been focused on the babies with no mouths, but my gaze was wandering. 

Blinking rapidly in the swimming blue light, I found… *me*. 

Glued to the wall were photos of me from an infant to a teenager, every private moment, every school play, every class photo. Aris stood next to me, shining his flashlight across the wall, illuminating photos of his own younger face grinning up at the camera. 

“Fuck.” Aris clucked his tongue. He wasn't smiling. “So, our elementary school teacher has a creepy shrine for us.”

“No,” I said, “I think it's those kids.”

Aris frowned. “The kids in the classroom?”

His beam landed on Noah, who was frozen, frenzied eyes finding photos from his own childhood. The boy didn't move, his flashlight slipping from his fingers. Noah was a private person, so seeing his entire life spread out across all four walls was jarring. Stepping forward, a shiver crept down my spine. 

There was so much I didn't remember, even seeing myself as a preteen.

I didn't recognise the white room my infant self was in, and there was one gnawing thought that was driving me mad. I was staring at my whole life. 

Every waking moment of my existence. 

*So… where was my family?*

“These aren't just our baby pictures,” May hummed, pointing to the next wall.  

She strode over, her shaking fingers grazing each photo. 

Following her gaze, there were group shots of us in Aris’s car, at school, huddled around our table in the coffee shop. 

Somehow, our lives were captured right in front of us, both private, and investigative. 

When we broke into the town hall, the Sinclair mansion, every mystery we thought was private, was our own thing, every corrupt town member we thought we were privately investigating. 

It was all there. 

I couldn't stop myself, taking slow steps toward the wall, tearing off a Polaroid of me standing in my bedroom, half dressed in my bra and jeans. Someone had scribbled out my right eye, marking my arms and legs. 

**NOT PRETTY!!!** 

The note was written in sharp red. 

*The Strings murders,” the low murmur cut into my thoughts, *“The string murders made Marin realise she was just a kid, and Middleview’s criminals were not scared of taking her life… ”*

Twisting around, I found the source, a voice recording playing on an iPhone. 

It was the same book we were forced to read. 

*The Adventures of The Middleview Four.* 

Before I could turn it off, May shook her head. “I think it's… calming them.”

“*Calming* them?!” Noah whisper-shrieked, gesturing to the tank full of infants. “You mean the mutant mouthless babies being lulled to sleep by a book based on *our* lives?!”

“But why?” Aris’s gaze was on his own toddler photos. 

In the corner of my eye, Noah was already searching through a glass desk. 

“Here.” he slammed a piece of paper down, his expression twisted. I glimpsed all four of our names, and a hefty sum at the bottom. “They're signing us over,” he hissed. “Dated just after our graduation, to someone named A.”

Aris frowned. “Selling us to what?” he snatched the paper off of Noah, peering at it. “It says a permanent position,” he caught my eye. “So, he's got us jobs?”

“Jobs.” Noah scoffed. “Dude, the fucking criminal mastermind is selling us to someone named A. That's not a job. It means a permanent purchase.”

“Riiiight,” Aris rolled his eyes. “Because I definitely thought he was *renting* us.”

“Don't be a smart-ass, you know what I meant.”

May blinded them both. “Stop arguing, and get evidence. Take photos.”

"Wait." I didn't realise I was staring through the glass until I was running my fingers over the pane, playing an invisible piano. There was something moving. 

I pressed my face against the screen, peering closer. *There*. I could see something, tiny, shrivelled, tangled around an infant's toe. Whatever it was matched the oozing darkness replacing their mouths, a slimy tendril of darkness creeping up a baby's tiny leg. 

“Is that…” I knocked on the glass in an attempt to scare… whatever it was. 

“They're strings.”

Noah was standing behind me, his gaze glued to the movement creeping around each baby, entangling around them. 

When I knocked again, something slammed into the glass, a slimy black tendril creeping across the pane, like it was alive. The four of us jumped back. 

“What the…fuck?” Noah choked. 

“Wait.” Aris risked a step forward. “Did that string just… attack us? 

No. 

We were attacked by the babies. 

Which meant, somehow, these babies used them as a defence mechanism. 

Before I could tell the others, the room was suddenly awash in red light. 

“Silent alarm,” Aris said, when the door slammed shut. “So, whatever gets in here can't get out. Without waking up the creepy mutant mouthless babies.”

“Okay, so…what do we do?!” Noah whisper-muffled. 

“Nothing.” Aris’s voice sounded kinda high pitched.

The red lights were blurring in and out, dancing across my vision. “If you actually took notice, the room flooded with nitrous oxide several seconds ago.”

“Riiight.” Noah said, dragging out the word. “And what do we doooo, idiot?”

I never got to hear Aris’s answer. 

But I did hear his head hit the floor with a meaty smack. 

The memory fast forwarded, and half aware of reality, where I was bleeding out in a bathroom stall, I had an eerie sense of deja-vu. There were voices above me. Voices that didn't make sense, but also somehow did. I fell away from them, back into the dark. 

Without Delaney's brutal pushing, I was able to tread the memory like dipping my toes in the deep end of a pool. 

This time I was in what looked like a hotel room. 

Minimalist, with navy walls and a chandelier. It was the penthouse suite. 

I was tied to a chair, my wrists pinned behind my back, in front of large windows looking out over our tiny town where the townspeople resemble cockroaches. There was something sticky over my mouth. Duct tape. I tried to lick it off, but this was strong stuff. 

A familiar muffled grumble brought my dizzy thoughts back to fruition. 

*Oh, yeah…*

I lazily lolled my head to the left where Noah Prestley was muffle screaming through a swath of tape over his mouth. 

*I was blasted in the face with nitrous oxide.* 

That explained my headache. 

I should have been surprised when Mayor Caravel stepped into the room, settling the four of us with a patient smile. But it was obvious he was pulling the strings from the beginning. 

Noah muffled something, and Caravel ripped the tape off of his mouth. 

“Ow!” he hissed. “This is child abuse.” 

Caravel stepped back. “It's a precaution,” he said.

“Tying up your stepson is not a precaution,” Noah spat. “But since we’re here,” he leaned forward in his chair. “What were those things, dad?”

Caravel raised a brow. “I have been asking you to call me your father since you were a child. Why the change?”

Noah tipped his head back. 

“I dunno, *dad*, maybe since you abused Mom, and treated her like shit, driving her to suicide,” his words dripped venom. “You have child services in your pocket, so what choice do I have? I can't run away! And I'm preeetty sure you killed my real dad. You just want to control me.” his lip curled. “Do you want to push me off of the edge too?”

Caravel's expression darkened, his eyes challenging. “They're children,” he replied to Noah’s earlier question. “I don't think I have to explain human biology to you at seventeen, do I?”

“They're not children, Mayor Caravel,” Aris managed to muffle. “They don't have mouths.”

Caraval’s eyes narrowed. “Mr Young, I don't believe I asked you to speak.”

“Don't *talk* to him like that,” Noah gritted out. “Why are you dodging the questions? You have a nursery full of mutated, mouthless babies, and let's not forget the creepy fucking shrine dedicated to literally every moment we’ve ever had in our lives! So, what are you doing, huh?” he was getting dangerously close to toppling off of the chair. I heard the breath catch in his throat. “Wait.” Noah laughed, but it came out like a sob. “Did you… did you do that shit to us?”

Caravel sighed. “Callen.” he nodded to the doorway. 

I twisted around to find a man wearing a pale blue mask striding into the room. 

“Dad,” Noah’s voice broke. “Why won't you answer me? Did you fuck with us too?” he heaved out a breath, his eyes widening. I could already sense it, his lungs failing to suck in oxygen. 

He was having a panic attack. I was used to him suffering from them, but I couldn't do anything. I couldn't grasp his hand and tell him to breathe. 

“Mate.” Aris whisper-muffled. “It's okay. Breathe.”

“Take care of them,” Caravel knelt in front of Noah with a sigh. “Just… take it easy on my stepson. I don't want you to hurt him but he is becoming a pain.”

He reached out to Noah, at first caressing his cheek, and then gripping his chin, forcing the boy to look at him. 

“Jaz,” his voice was soft, yet I could see the dents his fingernails were making in Noah’s flesh. “What I want is for you to embrace your gift.” His smile was fatherly, but I could see exactly what Noah could. Control. “You are my son, and I want you to stand by my side when the time is right and accept your place.” The mayor’s grip loosened slightly, his hand lightly stroking the boy’s cheek, brushing strands of hair out of Noah’s eyes. “I don't think you understand how important you all are to this town’s children. Stop fighting me, and then maybe we can have a talk.” 

“About what?!” Noah sobbed. “You're selling us off after graduation, and you expect us to blindly fucking accept it?”

“Jaz–” 

“Get off of me,” Noah seethed, pulling at his restraints, “I want to know why those mutant children are obsessed with us.” 

“They're your creators.”

The man's words sucked the breath from my lungs. 

“What?” May spoke this time. “What's that supposed to mean?”

Caravel sighed. “Take everything,” he stood up. “I don't usually ask for a clean slate, but they're becoming harder to manage. The Middleview Four will continue.” he caught my eye, and something twisted in his mouth, like his smile was being artificially pulled. 

I blinked. 

Strings, tangled between his lips. 

“Whether they like it or not.” 

“No!”
 
The mayor’s son choked out a cry, struggling violently, his breaths coming out in sharp pants. “Do you seriously think you can wipe everything away?”

“I'm finished talking to you, Jaz.”

“Please,” Noah gasped out. “Dad. I can't… I can't breathe.” he tipped his head back, sucking air between his teeth. “Are you really… going to… kill me?”

Caravel lips pricked. “If I could kill you, I would have a long time ago.”

The boy’s breaths were growing laboured, and part of me was thankful when the masked man pressed his fingers to his temples, murmured reassurances, and Noah’s head dropped. 

The man turned to me. 

“Can you breathe in?” His voice was soft, almost melodic. 

The pressure on my head felt just right. 

“I'm going to take you home.”

*Eve?* 

That voice pricked me back to consciousness. 

Reality. 

*“Eve! Hey, come on, stay with me!”*

Dr. Delaney told me there was a specific memory that was killing me.

No matter how deep I delve to reach it, It’s always too far down, enveloped in an oblivion I could never get to. 

He told me this memory was causing my brain to swell from the pressure of relentless attempts to find and revisit it. 

Part of me knew what this memory was. 

I had already slipped inside, instantly retracting myself from it. It was a scarlet room. I told myself I would only find it again when I was sure of myself. 

But the memory that was killing me found me instead. 

I was so… cold, and yet also warm. My body was entangled in something slimy, something stringy wrapped around my wrists and coiled around my neck. The room was made of concrete, and I could feel each of them pressed to my back. 

They were warm. 

Alive. 

I felt their wriggling wrists pressed to mine. 

“Eve.” Noah’s voice was a low murmur. 

He was older. Twenty two years old with patchwork skin and one glass eye, the boy who tried to save me. 

Why did he come back?

I was already trying to pull from the memory. 

I didn't want to see this. 

Fuck! 

I didn't want to see this!  

I saw them push through the exit doors, bathed in flashing lights. 

So, why were they here? 

Why were they back on the cutting room table? 

Noah’s head dropped onto my shoulder. But I was only drinking in blood splattered walls, and hanging above us, a stained blade. “Do you remember my name?” 

I lost my voice when the silver blade started to spin. 

“Noah.” I said, and his laugh was more of a sob. 

I kept saying his name, even when the blade came down, slicing through him, hollowing him out. The saw was precise in the way it ripped through three members of The Middleview Four, and left me screaming, sobbing, my arms still bound to dead flesh. 

His name was stuck in my throat when warm beads of red trickled across the floor, dripping down my back and neck.

It was everywhere, stuck to me. 

Staining me. 

*He* was fucking everywhere. 

They were so cold, while I was warm, soaked in wet warmth that dripped down my face. Their backs pressed to mine felt wrong, like cold lumps of flesh. It was  pitch dark, apart from that single spotlight. I lazily followed the beam, glimpsing trails of scarlet splashed across the table, turning black in the shadow. 

“Marin.” Warm arms wrapped around me, pulling me from the table. Mom pressed her face into my shoulder, her lips tickling my ear. “Oh, baby, you've made me a proud Mom.” she pulled away, her lips stretched apart, strings pulling them into an unnatural giggle. 

“You're my little star,” she whispered. “When Marin watched you discover your friends on stage, she was so excited! She rewound that part so many times!” Mom turned me around forcibly, and my gaze found the pieces of my friends. I could see them pulled through a meat grinder, hanging from the ceiling, impaled through the heart. 

Every time I've seen them die, suffering in Middleview.

Prisoners of strings. 

It was all for her. 

Mom’s expression was riddled with glee, strings pulling her in a manic dance. “Marin hasn’t killed anyone since! You're all making me so proud!” her warm breath danced in my ear. “She hasn't killed me. I'm her favorite!”

My legs gave-way when the pieces of my friends were already being put back together. 

“I'm going to make them prettier!” the little girl’s voice rang in my head. 

*“Prettier and prettier, and prettier!”*

May’s eyes were plucked from her skull, Aris’s mouth unravelling. 

Noah’s torso was rolled over, his limbs detached doll pieces. 

“But don't worry!” Mom giggled in excitement. “We can just put them back together, and do it alllll over again!”

“Allison. Dr. Callan Delaney is ready for her.” 

The voice came from the door. 

My eyes found the door, and there stood Mayor Caraval, his arms wrapped around three smaller shadows. 

They looked like college students. The girl wore a yellow sundress, while the boys were in casual wear. But it wasn't their clothes I was staring dazedly at, still wrapped in my mother’s arms. 

Their faces were drowned in shadow, and yet I knew them. Before I could stop myself, I was moving toward them.

Mom yanked me back, forcing me to face her. 

I could see strings entangled around her iris, her mouth violently pulled back and forth. 

“You're my star, Marin!” she said, squeezing me to her. “You're doing so well at keeping our special girl happy.”

Thankfully, I retracted from that memory, oozing back into reality. 

“Oh, thank god! Are you all right?”

The first thing I noticed was the cool graze of cool air whipping my hair out of my face. I was lying on a wooden bench, a young woman looming over me, her hands filled with bloody tissue paper. I gingerly swiped at my nose, prodding at dried blood crusting the edge of my nostril. “It's all right, I managed to stop it, but you really need a hospital!” She dropped down beside me. “I found you in the bathroom, barely conscious talking about red heels,” she laughed. “I had no idea what you were talking about! But you were bleeding pretty bad, so I called 911.”

I sat up, a dull pain throbbing in the back of my head. 

The woman handed me a bottle of water, and I drained it. 

“Do you want a refill?” she pointed down the road. “I can just go to my truck! I have water in my trunk.”

I nodded, a small *thank you* slipping from my lips. 

“No problem! I'm Bess, by the way! I'll be just a minute, okay?” 

When Bess was gone, I managed to stand up, pressing pressure to my nose. 

I found my gaze flicking to the freeway, following the stream of late afternoon traffic. It had to be at least 6pm. 

The sky was darkening. When I followed the horizon to catch the late setting sun, I saw something else instead.

Something cutting into the air, slicing its way through reality. I stepped back. 

Strings. 

Strings that had expanded from Middleview, from Marin's stage show. 

And now they were in my town.

Which meant…Marin is hunting me down. 

Another step back, and a hand slammed over my mouth. 

“Bess.” The voice said, “In the middle of nowhere, a twenty-something year old woman named Bess just happens to find you bleeding out in the bathroom, and offers you water from her truck.” 

I felt hands on my shoulders, turning me in the direction of Bess’s truck. “If you were a *real* detective, Marin, you would have noticed *Bess* is currently running towards us with a gun in one hand, and a sedative pistol in the other.”

His breath, real and ice cold, grazed my ear. 

“Run.”

A loud beep pulled me out of my thoughts. A black SUV was pulling up next to us, and I was shoved onto the passenger seat, face-planting directly into a warm lap. The door slammed shut, a familiar laugh from the front seat. “That was the *slowest* getaway I've ever seen! Did you short-circuit?”

“Shut up, and drive,” the other voice grumbled. 

The car flung forward, and I almost rolled off of the seat. The voices didn't make sense to me, an amalgamation of what was supposed to be home. But I saw them die. I saw them ripped apart. 

“I said drive left!” 

“I am going left!”

Another violent jerk, and I was sure I was going to die. This time by car crash. Thankfully, cool hands were helping me sit up straight. She was both beautiful and grotesque, a cruel and yet kind delusion of what I wanted, ripping my heart to pieces. May. Her face was too perfect, pretty blue eyes and porcelain skin, dark hair in her usual pigtails. The girl looked like May. 

When she smiled at me and told me everything was going to be okay, she sounded like May. But she was so cold. 

Her skin felt almost… slimy. 

“The *other* left, you fucking idiot!”

“Oh, you mean the *right*?” the voice choked. “Wait. Fuck. A. Two o’ clock.”

One of the figures whipped around. 

Noah. 

His face, like May’s, was too perfect. 

“She's tailing us.”

“I've got it,” the boy with Aris’s face jumped into the back, primed on his toes like an animal. He turned his head. “Can you drive onto a secluded road?”

“No. I know what you're thinking, and doing *that* will just attract attention.”

Aris leaned back in his seat with a sigh, and I caught something attached to him, threaded down his neck, entangling around his fingers like a spider's web. 

“Killjoy.”

Strings. 

Not red, but black, rotting strings. 

A shadow appeared in the corner of my eye.

Noah. 

His Middleview, fifteen year old self.

His eyes were dark. “I don’t mean to be the bearer of bad news, but they're not us.”

Noah Prestley.

Always the fucking detective. 

I was already playing with my phone, stuffing it between my legs to keep it hidden. Noah was thinking exactly the same, but there was something *wrong* with him. I caught it, then, rich red seeping from his nose. He swiped at it with his sleeve, his eyes widening.

I found myself wondering if figments of my imagination were supposed to bleed. 

*That’s… new,”* he mouthed. 

He caught my eye, and I noticed his expression twist. Could he *feel* pain? 

“Can you not hear me?” he hissed, swiping at his nose. 

“Eve. They're *not* us!”

I'm trying to ignore him. 

But you can't *ignore* your subconscious. 

I'm currently travelling with strangers with my friends' faces. 

I'm terrified of them, terrified of getting caught. 

But also…they're real. 

Right now, they're all I have. 

But I have a feeling Marin is playing a new game…
