Why do I always get the weird ones?

I watched the juggling clown that looked as if he’d give kids nightmares more than entertainment. He juggled the alcohol bottles with ease which was impressive in itself. When he caught me staring, he just smiled and winked in my direction. I tried hard to disguise my disgust as he continued to walk the aisle of the shitty gas station I work at. 

The shelves were lined with sugary junk food of all sorts. Including those powdery white donuts that are more dangerous than glitter bombs, candy to look like food imitations, and let’s not forget the off-brand stuff that looked like alien’s tried to make human food but failed miserably. 

The slush machine stirred the frozen sludge around and around in the dispensers. Safety-cone orange, slime lime, blood red, and Smurf blue and many more flavors. Most of the local kids loved slushies, to me they all looked like it could give you a sugary overdose. 

The 24/7 Sole Stop Gas Station—I like to refer it as Soul Stop instead. Our gas station had at least forty different flavors, more than any other convenience store in the state, but either I’m exaggerating, or the owners are. Buts that’s not the reason why I work in this dumpy place of a shit hole. The gas station is located in a very sketchy part of town, the only stain in the suburbs that was two miles away. 

There’s a furniture shop across the street practically next door, they have a broken blinking advertisement sign of a creepy looking girl logo on the sign in big bold red lettering above read Meuble, and on the other side of the gas station is ironic. It’s a life insurance company, advertising payment plans for shortened life expectancy, in their window read Ideal Insurance were enough to keep most respectable people away. And the store right next to them is the crawfish restaurant I don’t recommend going to if your stopping by. 

This street was so seedy even Walmart said no. Let’s not forget the weird pawn shop right across the street that has these weird creepy mannequins in the window wearing the most atrocious outfits. They are in different positions every day, there’s a rumor that those particular mannequins are haunted. As I like to say, not my monkeys, not my circus. 

Let me all be frank with you all: it gets pretty interesting during the overnight shift, some of the things that come through the front doors have you asking *why?* I have a motto, don’t ask if you don’t want that answer. 

But there are those boring nights when its dull and painfully slow, I usually tell my friend that is three states away from me about the shit that goes on here in our honky dory little town of nowhere. She had suggested I should use some outlet to tell my stories, and that’s why I’ve chosen this one, so I can tell you all what’s it is like working in a shitty gas station at night. 

My name is Andy, short for Andrea. I’m twenty-four and I’ve never been to college, it’s just a huge scam to get all your money anyway. I needed a job and there weren’t that many to pick from, to be honest, I had started working here, thinking it was going to be temporary, that was three years ago.

 If you live here, which I’m almost sure none of you do, you might have seen me behind the counter haggard with strange suspicious stains on my uniform and having an RBF—clarification its means resting-bitch-face if you are not familiar with that slang. We mostly get travelers, truck drivers, stopping in to get your latest fuel and snacks to go. I’m sure you’ve probably seen the weirdness of our town, think of the town from that car animation show. There’s nothing else for miles in the hot desert beyond our town but the constant one weather of blue skies and as hot as Satan’s ass crack until you hit almost to the next state over. 

But all that aside, I did mention that things get a little *weird* around here, didn’t I? I am sure it’s like that everywhere on the overnight shift, weird things happen, or strangers you’d rather hid in the cooler from, right? Well not here though, to be honest I’d rather have a drunk driver knocking the display cases down. 

I want to be able to tell you all about everything I’ve gone through, but that would take years to tell. So, I’ll start with my one of my favorites, I call it the Shadow-man. I had done some research in these so called beings, shadows that only catch in your peripheral  vision, you think you see someone there, but when you pay your full attention to it, the shadowy figure is gone.

Feeling watched? Probably the shadowy figure either that or your just paranoid. There is a shadowy figure that does lurk in the store, I’ve named him Jeff. Whether he’s a ghost or some other entity I am not entirely sure. But Jeff is very mischievous. 

His favorite thing to do is stalk women in the bathroom, especially the ones who look like they are someone in this town. I feel Jeff’s repulsion, I really do. We had a lady in here that was from the upper class if you will. I like to say upper crust, and her snooty two children are just as worse as her.

 That likes to frequent the golf club and host book clubs, her name is Madaline Ford Verlander—no, really, that is her full name. The insufferable valedictorian of the towns high school. She’s one of my mother’s book club friends whom she thinks she has to impress. She comes in from time to time, to basically tell me I’m stupid and on the *special spectrum* because I work at a gas station. 

Madaline was doing her usual taunt and go’s I like to describe these events so meaningless that I practically ignore her presence. Now working at Soul Stop there is “technically” a uniform policy. The shirt with the logo in the right breast pocket and a name tag. 

My name tag was a worn out silver thing that barely read And, so when someone reads it, they say Hi And? And my response is and what? I get blank stares. Anyway, moving on, our uniform shirts remind me of those cheap 80’s neon yellow and red shirts, which hurt my eyes when I stair too long. I usually wear my zip up hoodie over it. As per usual Madaline made her way in. 

“Why, I don’t believe my eyes. Is that you Andrea Beetle?” Madaline feigned surprise. Her voice sounded like fingernails running down a chalkboard with a pinch of nasally tone. A shiver ran down my spine. I have nightmares with that voice. “You still work here, in this little quint place. Bless your sweet little heart for keeping a job like this!”

I had to reframe from jumping over the counter, *murder is illegal, murder is illegal, murder is illegal.* I had to keep that motto going in my head. Madaline had that bottle beach hair styled in a bob—some people call it the Karen haircut —brush collar of her light blue blazer she wore over her white blouse and black pencil skirt. It was a look that screamed look how fake rich I am.

 Madaline Ford Verlander had mastered the fake sweet sickening gut wrenching smile, and she was pouring it over me like corn syrup. Her outlined red lips curled up tight at the ends, showing just enough of those shark-white teeth to remind you how hard she can bite like a Pitbull. 

She looked me up and down as I stood behind the register, “Why Andrea, you look like you could use some moisturizer, baggy eyes are not attractive at all!” She eyed me, up an down. Again, that shiver ran down my spine and the urge to commit murder was right there. 

One of the other customers—a regular, Joey, the son of the local the mechanic shop likes to drop by to buy his usual beef jerky and coffee. He thinks he’s being slick when he flirts with me. I bluntly am ignorant to it. 

“I think she just called you ugly,” Joe loudly whispered as he was looking over the beef jerky stand nearby.
 
I glared at him to shut up, Joey isn’t one to take hints, and he’s blunt at everything. I forced a mannequin like smile on my face I was sure my cheeks were breaking. My mother warned me to be nice, to this woman. “How are you, Mrs. Verlander? You know I heard a rumor that that facial cream had to have massive recall because they found dead rats at the bottom of the machine that makes the whole thing. I overheard the pest control mention that before you walked in.”

Joey not so settles snickered as he was still looking at the beef jerky, at this point he was loitering to see where this was going. 

Madaline subconsciously touched her face, a scowl forming in that perfect façade of hers. “What terrible thing to happen, I hadn’t heard anything like that.” As if trying to compose herself. “I was stopping in to get some . . . Bottle water, I had just came from the country club. We had a tennis match and I needed to rehydrate myself before I head home for some well deserved cocktails the top rated neurosurgeon from the city and his wife—you wouldn’t know them—anyway, would you know it, the country club ran out of bottle water, and since this place wasn’t too terribly out of my way, I decided to pop and say hello while getting that bottle water before heading to that dinner party with the neurosurgeon and his wife I mentioned about.”

Joey the ever lovable idiot snickered at her explanation. We both know the real *reason* why she decided to pop in and say hi, and it wasn’t for bottle water. I didn’t have to be a mind reader to know she was lying. She only came here because I worked here. 

She came to show off how rich she was, and she didn’t have to work for anything in her life, her husband is the breadwinner, and yes, he frequents this place like a drunkard fish every night before he has to go  home to *her.* 

“Oh goodness, look at the time, I better get that bottled water . . .” She glanced at her high tech touch screen watch. “I have to get to that dinner that I am hosting. I possibly can’t delay that dinner, Richard was really looking forward to speaking to that neurosurgeon. Oh, and Madison, you remember her, she is coming back home for the first time from university, you know she is studying to be a lawyer. You know Harvard and Yale were fighting over her. Oh, dear Andrea, you haven’t gone to college, have you? You decided to work your fingers to the bone. How is your mother these days? My heart goes out to her, I’ve heard how hard it is to have a special needs child working to help, I suppose you had no choice to work.” 

Yeah, she really called me special needs. Joey’s mouth fell open as he stared at her from behind her. 
Yes, she is really shit talking to me in front of me. She looked around as if she was embarrassed to ask, as she leaned towards me. “If you don’t mind, I need to use the powder room, where would that be?” 

“Take a left by the slushie machine and, walk down the hall ten feet and there you would find the *powder room* with everything you need inside.” I said as sweet as buttercream.   

“Thank you,”  Madaline gave me an evaluated look, but I kept a blank expression, I couldn’t show that she was irritating me or that I would definitely start a cat fight. I had to show customer service personality, the owner was something out of this world. She huffed and pranced off towards the bathroom like a show horse. 

“She’s a piece of work,” Joey said as soon as the queen was out of earshot to hear him. Joey was dressed in a blue jumpsuit with grease stains everywhere including smudged on his right cheek and his brown hair fell in a greasy mess. He set his beef jerky and coffee on the counter as I started to ring him up. “I didn’t know you were special needs, someone should have told me I had the hots for someone with special needs. Don’t worry, my pa told me to always help anyone in need.” He winked. 

I felt my cheeks go red from his teasing. From the humiliation of Madaline. I know Joey was going to go tell his father who’s going to tell his cousin that works as a receptionist, and then that will spread like wild fire, and only fuel Madaline. And my mom would tell me what I did to make people think I was *special needs.* and somehow it would be my fault. 
“Don’t make me accidently set your shop on fire, Joey.” I threatened as I bagged his jerky and he paid with cash. 

“Awe c’mon, I can’t tease ya? Don’t listen to anything she says, she’s just trying to get under your skin.” He said sipping on his coffee. 

I got his change for him and set it on the counter next to the bag. “I’m well aware of what that show horse is doing. Now get out of here, before I really get mad, will yeah?” 

He laughed and took his change, and jerky and walked out of the gas station with the door dinging. I rolled my eyes and took a deep breath. Trying to calm my nerves. When I heard a scream, it’s a shrill scream like no other. I hesitated from leaving my post, I mean she could be screaming at the cockroaches, perhaps someone didn’t flush a toilet? She came running out pale as a ghost and breathing hard. 

“You need to call the police!” She said in that shrill tone. 

I really didn’t want to ask, “why?” I asked in a monotone. 

“There is someone in the bathroom, a man, I think! I could not see his face, it was only brief, I think he was watching me—” she started to hyperventilate. 

I caught a black figure swooshing passed the slushie machines and I had to fight the urge to laugh. Jeff was at it again. Peeping tom. I tried to reframe from laughing as I saw the back of her skirt lift for a brief second and she screamed again and turned around, of course nothing was there. She looked at me like a wild coyote. 

“You want me to call a cop on a ghost?” I lifted an eyebrow to challenge her sanity. 

“don’t be preposterous, there was a man in the women’s bathroom!”

The rack near her fell over and she jumped and screamed. She clutched to her designer bag that hung on her shoulders. She looked around with wide eyes. “Oh, my lord!” She hurried out the door. 

“Mrs. Verlander!” I called after. “Didn’t you want to buy a bottled water!” I yelled after her and she hurried into her BMW and drove out of the parking lot, the wheels squealing as she did so. I was laughing, although I was not happy, I had to rebuild the candy bar display. “Very funny Jeff,” I snickered. 

The lights overhead flickered. As if he too was snickering. Jeff can be a pleasant ghost to work with. There was a rumor that he used to work here before me. But that was only a rumor, hence one of the reasons why people don’t like working the overnight shift. Jeff sometimes is helpful but not always. 

But other times like last Wednesday when I was found a rat eating a decapitated human hand in the backroom. That is to say it was sadly not Madaline’s manicured nails, the rat would have hell of a stomachache. I wasn’t sure if it was worth fighting the rat, I had called the  Sheriff that is on speed dial on my phone. When I mentioned it was a human hand, he acted as if I had disturbed him from his reruns of the Kardashian.

I decided I didn’t feel like getting a disease I left the rat alone. When the Sheriff showed up before I had to clock out and Betsy was coming in for the day shift. I showed him, but all there was left was a bloody mess, I had to stay overtime to clean it up after the Sheriff took pictures and looked around the property to see if he could find where the hand went or came from. No dice. And there were no missing persons of lately, he chalked it up to the bizarre and weird and left. 

That rat comes back frequently with body parts, after my fifth phone call, the Sheriff stopped coming back and told me to just take pictures. Problem with that is, the disease infested creature stole my phone, and I will be posting from my laptop until I can find it. My mother refuses to buy me another, my phone tendency to get stolen and not just because I get robbed. 

I have a lot more stories, not sure I want to stay consistent with them. So, some might seem out of place or date, but I assure you they aren’t boring. But honestly, right now, my laptop is dying, and I didn’t bring the charger with me. Jeff is causing chaos and there is a soupy frozen sludge pool on the floor and that damn rat hasn’t shown itself so I’m not going to be able to make any phone calls for a while. 

Maybe, if your driving through having a craving for sugary treats or some junk food to munch on, you might meet me. Oh and if it’s not a bother, if you happen to find my phone, it has a crack where the camera is on the top, and there should be some old blood smear on the back with a beetle sticker on it, please could you return it to me, I really need my phone. Have a safe night and be careful of murderous rats and Botox women.
