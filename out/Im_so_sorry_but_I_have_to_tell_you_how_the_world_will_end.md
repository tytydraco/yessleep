I’m so sorry that I have to do this to you. Nobody should know these things I know. It’s a curse, just to know what’s coming. But I just can’t keep it all to myself anymore. I’m not strong enough.

I know how the world is going to end, and this knowledge has filled every single moment of my life with terror. I was at a family reunion just the other week, and for a moment, I even managed to lose myself and have fun — and then I looked into my cousin’s face, and I remembered the way he’ll look. Twisted and burned, wrapped up in a barbed wire fence at an unnatural angle, having been bled out by his desperate attempts to crawl blindly through. And looking out at the city’s skyline on my way home, I couldn’t shake the image of those skyscrapers crumbled to jagged metal, like dust sprinkled atop a molten crater scarring the surface of a once beautiful Earth.

And to think it started with something so stupid. At a house party, my nephew introduced me to a girl he claimed had been a psychic medium. Claimed that she could divine the future through a touch of your palm alone, like one of those fortune tellers you’d meet at a carnival. She used to make a career of it, but had since decided to switch to other work. “After all,” she said. “Nobody actually wants to know their future. Not really.”

By that point in the night, I was four drinks deep, and I’d never been much for new age woo in general. So I’ll be honest: I was downright cruel to her. It started as little jabs, slight taunts, asking her why she hadn’t divined the lottery numbers if she were truly so supernaturally gifted. And when she couldn’t answer that, I started outright mocking her in front of the entire party. Accused her of having been a charlatan, probably only quitting after she got caught lying to dumb tourists to scam them out of their money. I even made her cry.

And so, in the end, she grabbed me by the hand, ran her fingers over my palm, and she proved it. She showed me my future.

I could feel her entering my mind, changing things around. I froze, and shuddered, and even screamed. I felt like hands had reached out to grab me from some astral void, carrying me far away. I’d call it a vision, or even a vivid dream; really, it was more like an out-of-body experience. At one moment, I was at a house party, and the next, I was standing in my own future.

I didn’t know how far into the future it was. Months? Years? Things didn’t seem too different. I was standing on my porch in a suburban neighborhood, watching my son Kyle play with toys in the yard. He was older in the vision than in my time, but still at that age where he could be endlessly entertained driving his Little Tikes car up and down the driveway.

I vaguely remembered turning on the TV earlier that morning, and turning it off at the sight of the news. The reporter seemed a bit panicked, breathless. He was talking about a lot of countries I didn’t recognize, and world leaders whose names I couldn’t pronounce. I didn’t really pay any attention to the news anymore. What was the point? It’s not like I had any control over any of it.

Still, there was something off about today. Just this heavy atmosphere in the air. My Kyle seemed to be the only kid out playing, which was bizarre for a Saturday. And up and down the streets, cars were driving to and fro in some sort of hurry, some crammed full of luggage as they rushed out of the neighborhood. One of them, a station wagon, almost even struck my dear Kyle. “Kyle, look out!” I screamed, running forward to grab my boy’s hand. The car’s tires screeched as it swerved around him, but then it continued speeding down the road without even pausing. “Assholes,” I whispered under my breath, too quietly for him to hear.

And then, at that very moment, there came the blaring of sirens.

My blood ran cold. Hearing those ominous wails, echoing from some vast distance, like the dying moans of some race of cyclopean creatures. The whole Earth seemed to stand still. Even the crickets and birds went suddenly silent.

I stood there, frozen with fear. Even Kyle started to cry, seeing the look on his mother’s face. But the old man who lived next to us just seemed annoyed as he came stumbling out the door with his little walking stick. “Christ,” he groaned. “could they shut off that racket? Some of us are trying to sleep.”

Suddenly, my phone started shaking like crazy in my pocket. With shivering hands, I lifted it to my eyes and read: **BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.**

My blood turned to ice. “Oh God,” I whispered. “Are you seeing this? Oh God, oh God, oh God. Billy, come here. We have to —”

“No, no. Wait. I’ve seen this before,” my neighbor said, waving a hand dismissively. “Remember Hawaii? A moron at some agency somewhere accidentally hit the wrong button, and boom. The whole state was getting a red alert like this. Bet they felt like a right bunch of idiots when it turned out to be a false alarm.”

I hesitated. His logic made sense, and I didn’t want to act like some panicked fool. But… “I don’t know,” I said. “It says to seek shelter…”

He scoffed. “And where, exactly, would you be going?” He asked. “There is no shelter around here, anyway. Not for a hundred miles, I’d guess.”

I didn’t really believe him, of course. Every fraction of my rational mind knew that something terribly wrong was happening here. But I latched onto his words because I *wanted* to believe them.

After all, everyone knows, on some intellectual level, that this day could come. Maybe even that it’s inevitable. But it always seemed like it was so far into the future, like a can that mankind could keep kicking down the road, forever and ever. Nothing can prepare you for that moment when you realize that the clock had run out, and the moment that you’ve imagined and longed for and dreaded and feared and thought about all your life had finally come.

It was about a quarter past noon when the first missile hit. Looking out at that heavenly glow, for some reason, I was reminded of a Bible verse.

*“And God said, “let there be light!”*

It was bright. So unfathomably bright. Like a lifetime of staring into the sun condensed into one instant. I squeezed my eyes shut as hard as I could, but that horrible light burned even through my eyelids. Even when I turned away, stuffed my face into the dirt, grabbed and pulled at my hair and screamed and screamed, I could still see it, smoldering, burning, like a fire had been set in the center of my retinas and was spreading to consume all of that precious darkness. 

Kyle didn’t move. He was just frozen there, paralyzed, staring into the last and most brilliant light he would ever see in his short life. “Don’t look, Kyle,” I screamed, knowing it was already too late. “Don’t look.” Eventually, my grasping hand found purchase, and I was able to pull him to the ground, cover him with my body, shielding him from the light.

For a moment, the light dulled somewhat. For one last, blissful moment, there was peace. Kyle was softly whispering into my ear, “I can’t see. I can’t see.” Then the sound came.

The sound felt less like a sound and more like a physical blow, like a bull ramming into your chest. I remember being at the beach as a kid, and getting hit by a massive wave that took me by surprise from behind, which spun me around and knocked the air from my lungs like I’d been punched. This reminded me of that multiplied by an order of magnitude. 

It felt like I’d been impacted with such force that my organs struggled to keep up with the rest of me, rattling them around inside my body, my heart lunging, my lungs constricting, my stomach turning, like hands had burst through my flesh and were squeezing them in tight fists. I struggled to gasp down air, but I only exceeded in vomiting out a noxious black bile, thick with the chunks of clotted blood.

I was so concussed I had to claw my way into half-consciousness, my thoughts blurring, melding together into a surreal haze. I thought I could hear distant moaning and screaming, dogs barking and yelping, car alarms blaring, but it was impossible to be sure. Everything sounded mute and garbled, like I was listening to things happening a mile away with tin cans covering my ears. But I could certainly hear Kyle sobbing and groaning into my chest, and that gave me the clarity of mind I needed to stand.

I stumbled towards my home, cradling Kyle against me. At least, I thought I was heading in the direction of my front door. A cataract had completely filled the lens of my eye and made everything seem blurry and milky white, and with my eardrums ruptured, it seemed almost impossible to balance for longer than a few steps. It felt like the entire world was sloping beneath me, like everything was slowly turning sideways. I fell a few times, and Kyle let out shrill cries as I dropped him, but I gathered him against me again, weeping, and kept blindly marching forwards, driven by some mindless delusion that once I was home, everything would be okay again.

Things go blurry for a moment. The vision jumps forward in time. 

Next I know, I was laid in the backseat of our car with Kyle clutched close in my arms. Ahead of us, my husband Jim was at the wheel. He was always talking about this day, convincing himself he was preparing for it. From the look on his face, the sweat beading on his brow, he certainly didn’t *look* like he felt prepared. “I knew it. It was only a matter of time, honey, I’ve always told you,” he was muttering under his breath. “Who the hell had the balls to take on Uncle Sam? The bastards. The ruskies, it’s got to be.”

I felt like I had the worst sunburn of my life. Every inch of exposed skin had turned a deep, vivid red, and just touching anything felt like pressing my bare skin against a hot stove. And the damned itching — I just couldn’t stop myself, even as I wept from the pain, the top layer of my skin easily sloughing off beneath my fingernails, blood oozing slowly and viscously like syrup. But the true pain was hearing Kyle’s little sobs in my ears. He had it even worse than I did. “It hurts, mommy. It huuurts.” He just kept repeating the same little whimpers over and over. “I can’t see you, mommy. I can’t see.”

Each of his little moans hurt me more than any amount of physical pain ever could. I found the strength to look up at Jim, letting out a weak little sob. “Baby, please. We have to get to the hospital. Kyle needs — needs *help*.” I was under no delusion they’d have an empty bed available. I knew it must be chaos. But Jim brought guns. I thought, maybe… maybe we could rob the place? Take what we needed? I asked myself, was I willing to hurt someone innocent just to save my own child? It was the easiest question in the world. Of course I was.

Jim knew what I was thinking, and he’d considered it too, but dismissed the idea. “I’ve told you, Mary. The hospital is the *last* place we need to be right now. Everybody had the same damn idea, it has to be a bloodbath over there. We have to make it out of the city. My cabin, up in the mountains — it’s got everything we need. Don’t you worry. I’ll take care of us.”

I had to admit, he was doing well. He’d bought an old Ford Bronco from the seventies that could survive the electromagnetic pulse from the bombs, and he knew the route by heart, dodging the nightmare traffic on the highways, ducking down shortcuts no one knew about. For a moment, it almost seemed like we might make it.

And then we turned the corner, and we found ourselves facing them. The weeping masses, some innumerable horde of corpses, all black charred meat, hobbling around as if they didn’t even realize they were dead yet. The victims from the city, those who were a little closer to the blast.

A few looked almost human; others looked like flayed corpses animated by some strange power, and for the first time I learned what bare muscle and bone really looked like in person. All stumbled along together in one mass, as if their damaged minds had reverted to some sort of primitive herding instinct. They moved in almost robotic jerking motions, looking like their muscles had been permanently tensed by the heat. Some had their faces melded with their chests, or their arms fused to their sides. One was, I think, a mother holding her baby. It was hard to tell, as the two of them had melded together and become one, indivisible. Occasionally, one of their number would collapse and be left behind. 

All joined in a chorus of ghostly, withering, agonized wails, like they were singing their own funeral hymns.

They filled the road utterly, sorrowing the twilight of our withering world through empty sockets, their song oozing out of toothless, tongueless mouths. I saw them as nightmare victims, the sort you’d see in the damned pits of hell, but Jim saw them only as obstacles. He slammed the horn and flashed his blinkers as he weaved slowly through the mob, as if they weren’t clearly deaf and blind. “Get out of the way!” He was screaming out his window. “Jesus Christ, get out of the way!”

The car could only crawl forward by inches. There were too many of them, blindly bumping into the vehicle on all sides. Eventually he gave up, and slammed his foot on the gas. I screamed aloud as I felt the car pass over what felt like speed bumps, tired squealing, bodies coming apart as they collided with the front bumper. “God, honey, you’re killing them!”

“Look at them, Mary! They’re already fucking dead!” He screamed at me, which silenced me in a moment. He’d never raised his voice at me before. “We have a very limited window of time to get out of the city before every route is blocked off. Just trust me, baby.” I looked at his face in the rear view mirror, and saw that tears were streaming down his cheeks as the car tore through the crowd of undead.

Eventually, it was too much for the car to handle. It suddenly jerked to the side, the wheels seeming to scream as they spun uselessly, and Jim slammed his fists against the steering wheel as the engine stalled. “No, no, no, no! God damn it, you useless piece of —” He screamed every obscenity he could think of through the tears, before turning back to me. “Honey, stay here. Okay? I’m going to get out and I’m going to fix this. We’re going to make it, honey, I promise. I love you.”

He got out to work on the car, but he had to deal with those corpselike things stumbling and bumping into him. Occasionally he’d scream at one to get back, shove it away, only for it to come apart beneath his hand. And then, just when he thought he’d gotten things working again… one of the shambling things pulled out a gun.

This one had been luckier than the others. He still had one eye, inhabiting the remaining side of his face. The other side was an oozing swamp infested by foul purpura like acne, burst blood vessels spreading a viscous, clotted bloody mass just beneath his skin. He had a baby carrier strapped to his chest with something red and indecipherable inside, like a slab of steak burned on an oven. And as he pointed his pistol, he whimpered out between his burnt-off lips. “Y-you. I n-need… medicine. My boy… he’s very s-sick.”

My husband tensed. I knew he kept a gun in that holster on his hip, and I could see his hand slowly moving towards it. I tried to gesture for him to stop, but he couldn’t see me. “Sir, I’m very sorry, but we don’t have anything for you. Our son is very sick too, sir, do you understand? Please step away from the vehicle.”

The half-dead man was shivering like a wet puppy as he held the gun. I hated him and pitied him all at once. After all, I’d be doing the same thing in his situation. “Y-you’re… you’re lying. You look… p-prepared,” he wheezed. “Give me… g-give me the medicine. Or I’ll… I’ll…”

Jim almost pulled it off. He almost fulfilled those cowboy fantasies in his brain. He whipped the gun out of his holster with such speed, I couldn’t even follow his movements. But he was just a few milliseconds too slow.

The first shot passed right through one of Jim’s lungs. The next two shots seemed to be by mistake, as if the man were startled by his own gun. Jim stumbled, clutched his chest, tried to suck down a breath, looked like he was in disbelief. And then he fell out of sight.

The man looked down at his own gun, that one eye wide and bloodshot. And then he looked down at the inert, lifeless thing strapped to his chest, as if seeing it soberly for the very first time. And then he stuck the barrel into his mouth, and fired.

Everything fell away again. Once more, the vision was jumping forward through time.

I was stumbling down the side of a highway somewhere, past rows and rows of cars that seemed to stretch on from one horizon to the next, all emptied of life. In all my life, I’d never heard such silence. Not the buzzing of insects, or the singing of birds, or the murmur of distant voices. For all I knew, I could be the last person on Earth.

Well, except for Kyle, clutched against my chest. He was still alive. I knew this to be so, in my heart of hearts. Even if he was limp, and wasn’t breathing, and his heart wasn’t beating, and I could feel bits and pieces falling off as I carried him, I felt certain he was still alive. He had to be. I couldn’t fathom my son being anything else.

I knew on some intellectual level that I was in horrific pain. But by this point, I was fully disassociated. Only a passenger, watching myself walk. The pain had transcended pain and become something else, something you could call numbness. I only knew that I had to keep walking. *I have to make it to the cabin.* That’s what I kept whispering to myself. I had no idea where the cabin was, but I felt certain that, if I just kept walking, I’d find it eventually, and everything would be okay. Jim would be there waiting for us, and all the medicine Kyle needed, and all this pain would go away.

I felt like I walked for hundreds and hundreds of miles, but really, it was more like one or two. Eventually my legs gave out from under me. Really, they must have fallen apart, but I convinced myself I was merely stopping to take a break. At least I was under the shade of a gas station canopy. I looked up and giggled at a sign that read *MIDWEEK SPECIAL! Save 5¢/Gal with Any Car Wash Purchase!* That sort of thing used to seem so important, but seemed so silly to me now.

My mouth swelled with the metallic taste of the blood oozing from my cracked gums. I fiddled around in my mouth as if trying to scratch an itch, only to feel something come loose. I stared down at the chipped, rotting tooth in my hand… and I only giggled mindlessly at the sight, like a child pulling baby teeth to give to the tooth fairy.

I felt so warm, so comfortable. I just wanted to fall asleep here. But I knew I couldn’t. I had to keep moving, had to get Kyle somewhere safe. I tried to stand, but my legs just wouldn’t obey me anymore. So I started to crawl. Dragging myself across the hot pavement, whispering that mantra over and over again.

*I have to make it to the cabin. I have to make it to the cabin. I have to make it to the cabin. I have… to make it to the cabin. I… have to… make it… to the cabin. I… have… to…*

Suddenly, I was back, standing there at a house party. 

I dropped my drink and began to scream and cry, hyperventilating, collapsing, wailing. The fortune teller looked like she immediately regretted what she’d done, like she knew she’d taken things too far. “I told you. I warned you,” she whispered. “Nobody really wants to know their own future.”

Ever since then, I’ve lived in terror.

How could I lose myself in a pleasant moment, knowing what’s coming? How can I raise my boy knowing the sort of world that will be his generation’s future? Every time I hear a plane overhead, I freeze up from pure fear, and Jim has to console me. “I know we have to be prepared and all, but there’s no point worrying too much, baby. It’ll probably never really happen,” he said. “After all, the folks in charge aren’t *that* stupid.”

Some part of me wants to dismiss it as some sort of vivid hallucination. Yet still, I can see those milky white cataracts in the center of my vision, as if the divine light of that mushroom cloud has emblazoned itself upon my eyes forever.

I’m so sorry to share with you these horrors. I don’t know if this vision I’ve experienced is something inevitable, some determined end point of our world that cannot be changed. I guess I’m telling you this in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, someone reading this is able to change things. To street the world in some other direction. As horrifying as it was to witness the collective agony of a single city, imagine that suffering spread over the entire world, the wailing of billions of men, women and children in a collective pain that is beyond imagining, beyond reckoning.

We can’t let this be our future.
