I won't try to stop you from doing anything or making your life choices as you all are your own mind and consciousness. But I just want to say we have our own sufferings, problems, happiness, joys, experiences and expectations. 

While we see in social media SELF LOVE & stuffs like that ik it feels worse cause it never seems to work and makes us feel worse we can't do it or it doesn't help. So what do we need or should do? 

It's not factual but in my experience I would say unconditional self love and love from within. What does it mean right cause we hear it so often that now it sounds like some bullshit. What it truly means is loving yourself without any conditions. We praise ourselves when we achieve something or do something that makes us happy but hate ourselves and suffer when we do something bad or have troubles, pain and suffering in life.

Life is hard. It's never gonna get any better but what happens is you find your way to see things for better reasons; abandoned by parents= you'll learn to treat your own new family with fullest affection, sexually abused and assaulted= you'll learn to empathise others with same experience and help them not feel any less which makes you a stronger motivator and life saviour to so many people in same situation, disease and illness= you'll learn to value yourself, your life and life around you more but you'll definitely need to be here in the moment right now right here and make the most out of it.

While all of us here are thinking about suicide, someone's getting into accident and loosing their life so it's really uncertain what happens in another second so why choose your own faith. We're here so let's stay a bit longer, be here. 

Yk instead of sharing our reasons to die what if we started sharing reasons to live maybe a litt tiny one but something cause there's always something trust meüíó

Here's mine " I'm thankful for sunrise I get to see on sunny days which fills my room with warmth and my window video from which I can see neighbours walking their dogs although I find a brown sausage dog of one of my neighbour really cute, I really love doing my makeup it makes me feel creative idk just me, I love just staying in my room although there's chaos everywhere atleast I have a mini me in my head who's my bestie, she's crazy, sometimes too happy, sometimes really low and sad and sometimes sassy but she's the only one who really gets me. I have my own problems and sorrows but they're part of my life, they are my experiences and part of me, if I love my good experiences than why would I hate the bad one when they are just as part of me and my life as any other stuffs. 

Let's live for ourselves rather than feeling any less just cause of the expectations, unrealistic life approach and categorising always being happy as success and normal by society. Social media is shit hell hole. Let's not fall for it‚ù§Ô∏è

Whenever I get suicidal thoughts and can't stop or direct it in any other ways I write in a journal that I keep with me wherever I go 'I don't want to miss out on experiences I'll never get to explore, people who'll make my life worth living but I'll never get to meet, food that'll melt my tongue with flavours that'll be my favourite new dish to never taste, places that'll blow my mind with awe and take my breath away to never see. It's hard but is it really worth giving up when I can live with so much possibilities all around'

I love youü´Ç We're in this together and we got this
