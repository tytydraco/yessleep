 I went to a hotel, and it was a large, very fancy place. They had warned all new guests that the walls had just been painted and to be careful not to touch them. It was expensive, but it was a six-star hotel. When I got to my room, it was fancy as hell—unlike any hotel room I had ever seen before. I enjoyed the room and all the luxuries that came with it.

 Then the phone in my room started ringing. It was the receptionist downstairs.

 “Sir, we are asking all hotel guests to stay indoors because one of our guests managed to sneak in three large male lions into the hotel. Please stay in your rooms until the three aggressive lions are captured.” And then he hung up.

 How on earth did someone manage to get three large male lions into a high-class hotel without anyone noticing? It had to be an inside job—probably a rich VIP guest. I had wanted to explore the area, but now I was just going to sit inside my fancy room. It had everything I needed anyway.

 Then I heard a scream outside. It definitely sounded like one of the guests was being mauled by the three lions in the hallway. I used the chain on my door and opened it ever so slightly. I could see the shadows of the man being mauled—and the lions.

 When I saw the lions walking toward my door, I quickly shut it. I could hear all three of them moving through the hallway. Then the elevator doors opened, and the lions walked inside.

 I stepped out of my room after they were gone. The man who had been mauled was dead; there was barely anything left of his body. I put my hand on the wall, which had been newly painted white. As soon as I realized I had touched wet paint, I pulled my hand away. But when I looked at my palm, instead of white paint, I saw purple paint. That was strange.

 Then I heard more people screaming from the stairwell—the lions had gotten hold of more guests. Their screams echoed up to my floor, even though they were one level below me. Because all the walls were being painted, every stairwell door in the hotel had been propped open.

 When I stepped into the stairway, I saw the lions literally jumping down the stairs instead of climbing down. They were incredibly athletic and powerful.

 I started walking back to my room, but then I decided to touch the white paint on the walls again. This time, my hand showed black paint—then sometimes orange paint. None of it made any sense.

 I went back to my room, and I could still hear more screaming. I thought I was safe in my fancy hotel room and I made sure to take advantage of all of the luxuries this hotel room had offered. Then after 3 hours of enjoyment, I could hear breathing coming from the vents on the ceiling, then more breathing and as I looked up at the vents, it was the 3 lions. They roared and I ran out of the room and closed the door.

I could hear the lions trashing my hotel room. Then I decided to touch the white paint again as it still hadn’t dried, and as I looked at my hand instead of showing white paint, it showed purple paint?
