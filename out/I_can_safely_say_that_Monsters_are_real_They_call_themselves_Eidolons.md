The past few days have been insane and I decided that I need to get my story out into the world. Someone else has to know about these Eidolon things I've stumbled across. So I'm gonna post my experiences on the internet in the hopes that if something horrible does happen to me… At least there will be some record of it.

My name is Kai. I am in my early 20's. I work as a CNA, certified nursing assistant, at a local nursing home, and I live in the pacific northwest of the USA. I live with a single roommate in a shitty apartment the next town over from where I grew up. That's about all I want to divulge at the moment about myself beyond what you will read in my journal. I guess I can mention that I've been Journaling since I was a little kid. As a way to cope with my chronic memory loss and anxiety.

Below is a copy of my journal from last Thursday with a few edits and redactions. I'm just going to let it speak for itself. I plan to update regularly as things progress. Right now, other than missing a day of work and being traumatized I'm doing OK. I'll update you with my journals from Friday through tonight sometime tomorrow once I can post again. Until then, thank you for reading.

Well, I can safely say that Monsters are real. They call themselves Eidolons. At least that’s what the Spider calls itself.

I'm still in shock over all this. I'm going to do my best to explain everything. You got this Kai.

It started as a normal morning at work other than Mrs. C giving me so much trouble today. That woman really tests my patience. I try to be so nice and sweet with her, but she always lashes out at me on the days I get her side of the hall. The hazards of being male I guess. I know she is lashing out from the abuse at the hands of her husband, but still. She doesn't need to take it out on every guy that walks into the building, her dementia be damned.

By the time I got off and home it was about 4pm. I went to go pick up some gas before coming home. Surprise Surprise, Andrew had another new guy over for the 5th time this week. It's like that man takes having a high “body count” as a personal challenge. I still have no idea where he finds these guys either. Deciding that I didn't want to listen to him have some wild sex for the 5th time this week, I opted to go pick up some food and wait for his boy toy to leave.

I went over to \[Redacted\] and got dinner. My usual Kung Pao Chicken meal with hot and sour soup. After picking up the order I went over to the park to sit and watch the river.  Thankfully the snow cleared up last week and parking wasn't a hassle. It was deserted save for a blue Chevy truck that had parked in a spot near the entrance.

Sitting in my car I brought up a Youtube video and started to eat in peace. No depressing sex sounds, just mindless noise from some random Runescape Vid. I was about halfway through my dinner when my phone started to glitch out. It froze and started to buffer. Looking up for the first time in a few minutes I immediately noticed the Fog that had somehow rolled in. It was really thick shit too. I could hardly see the tree just a few feet beside my car. I rolled down my windows a few inches to see if the fog would waft in. Sure enough the fog was thick enough that it rolled in through my open windows. That was when shit got officially weird.

What happened next literally felt like a memory. Like I was recalling a memory from my past, only it was vivid enough that I could feel everything about it. The sights, sounds, the smells and even the feel of the car cushion beneath me. I could also feel the emotions “I” felt in that moment, those were the strongest of all. Right away though, I knew two things were wrong. I wasn't in my car anymore, instead I was behind the wheel of some Ford SUV. I was also sitting next to a woman I had never met in my entire life. I felt an overwhelming sense of undying love for this woman. A feeling I have never felt for any woman, let alone one I have never seen before. She was talking to me about something… I can’t recall too much of the words. The words didn't seem to matter. What mattered was how I felt and after some time I felt that love turn to rage. Unbridled rage, and as I saw myself lift a hand and reach for her throat…

I was back in my own car. In my own body. In my own mind. I wish I could better detail what happened but I didn't really get much time to process things. My windows were still rolled down and the fog was still outside, but it looked like it had cleared up a bit. I could see around my car now… and what I saw were trees. More trees than were at this parking lot. With a quick glance around I could tell I was in the middle of a fucking forest.

(SNAP… CRASH…) I heard something close by make a sound.

Though the river was far enough away that the fog obscured it, I could tell that it was still there from the rushing water. The sound was muted though as there were now dozens of trees in front of me between my parking spot and the river bank. It was during this survey of the trees around me that I spotted something horrifying.

(Snap… Snap…) A similar sound came from my right and I looked over in that direction.

Just a few feet from my passenger side door was a tree that had a fucking Eyeball on its trunk. We looked at each other for a split moment before another sickening (SNAP!) erupted through the forest as the trunk just below the Eyeball split open revealing rows of sharp splinters, like teeth in a giant mouth. Before I could even scream the tree launched a volley of splinters at my car. My windows deflected most of the splinters, but as the volley continued, the splinters grew larger and one eventually shattered my passenger side window.

By this point I was frantically trying to open my door, ducking down below the level of the windows. After some fiddling I managed to get the door unlocked, just as the attack ceased on my car. I seized the moment and ran. I just ran without any thought of where or what I was doing. All I knew was that at that moment I had to escape. I had to get away from this threat.

(SNAP… CRASH…) More sounds from behind me.

Nope. I continued running, soaring past trees and earth. Unable to even think straight. The fog was starting to lighten up and I could see the forest a little better. It seemed like the kind of forest you would find in the mountains around here. I could also see an old Chevy just a few dozen yards ahead of me. *Blue Chevy. Main Road. Fuck it.* I sprinted to the Chevy with more determination than I ever felt in my life.

(SNAP… CRACK…)

I slammed my body into the Chevy, chest heaving. I’m not much of a runner anymore. Not since my field and track days back in High School. As I scrambled for the driver side window I heard a much louder (SNAP!!!) from behind me. Daring to not look yet, I kept my eyes forward and peered into the truck. Inside was a man, about 40 or so with an unkempt beard and long ratty hair. He was passed out in the driver seat. I slammed on the window only to be met with indifference from the man.

(SNAP!)

I finally looked behind me to see a tree, just inches from me. A massive wooden maw opened as the Eye stared down at me. It shot a quick glance at the unconscious man.

I am not proud of what I did next. It will likely haunt me for the rest of my sad life, but I ran. I ran and I left that guy at the mercy of the tree monster. I sprinted to the other side of the Chevy and ducked in time for another shower of spikes. Glass and branches burst from the side of the vehicle, and within a heartbeat the long branches of the entity were investigating the inside of the Chevy.

I ran away and kept running, now with a better idea of where the road was. I ran to find someone else. Surely that guy was already dead before I got to him. He didn't move when I slammed my fists on the windows. These thoughts raced through my mind as I ran. I only got maybe another hundred feet before I came crashing down a pit in the ground.

Only falling a few feet, I kept my senses and scanned the bottom of the pit. It looked like something had dug out this pit and lined it with leaves. A rustling sound came from a small tunnel I didn’t notice on my first survey. That’s when I noticed the bones and webbing mixed in with the leaves. As it dawned on me where I was, a massive black fuzzy spider the size of a Mastiff crawled towards me. Its two biggest eyes reflected my scared expression as I recoiled. Backing myself against the far wall I covered my face and peeked at this thing from between my forearms.

“Another meal…” Came a low yet piercing voice, oddly human sounding. The spider stopped, fully in the pit now, its mandibles hovering over the spot I had landed on a moment ago. “Does this one speak?”

Without thinking I blurted out. “Yes… Yes! Please don't hurt me!” My cries seemed to give the spider pause as it stood there for a few seconds, its front legs stroking its fangs. Fangs that no doubt would be glistening if there was enough light coming in from above.

“This food does speak!” The voice, I presume the monstrous spider at this point, said almost excitedly. In a motion too fast for me to follow the spider turned enough to fire something from its butt straight at me. The webbing hit me square in the chest and knocked the wind out of me as it unfurled and began to encase me.

“Oh god! Please no! Please! Don’t eat me!” I screamed between gasps of air. The webbing pulled tighter and tighter as I struggled in vain.

“I love it when the food begs…” The spider cooed as it advanced on me. “Makes the slow dining experience more entertaining.” As the spider got right up onto me. Its fangs mere inches from my face I could feel myself starting to feel weakened. My head was starting to pound and the strength in my limbs faded. “Let’s take a good look at what I caught.” The spider brought its head down to bring one of its two massive main eyes right in line with my own eyes. “What kind of Eidolon are you?”

“No…” I choked out. “I’m human… please…” I managed to add before the spider interrupted me.

“Human? You claim to be human?” The spider backed away slowly and as it did I could feel some of that weight in my head recede. My limb strength came back to me, though I felt like I had just finished a session of weight training.

“I am human.” I said with more breath and conviction. “Please, I don't know where I am… or why I am here. I was just…”

“Humans are a myth.” The Spider spat back in a cold, yet curious tone from across the pit. It began to dig around for something hidden amongst the debris. “Though I will say… You do fit the bill.” After a moment the spider pulled up a skull of some sort and examined it. Looking between the skull and me it finally tossed the skull and said, advancing as it did, “I’ll have to examine you after I drain you. If you are human then this should be a very good meal indeed.”

“No! Please!” I screamed and thrashed as the spider towered over me again. The waves of exhaustion took hold once more and this time I blacked out quickly.

*"This is it"*

I was violently awoken some time later on my stomach. My shirt was off and a mysterious searing pain was coming from my shoulder. No spider in sight.

*"Free me you wretched human!"* The spider's voice echoed in my mind and the pain in my shoulder burned more as it felt like my flesh was being ripped off my body.

"AH!!! WHAT DO YOU MEAN? How are you screaming in my head?" I reached up and put a hand to my shoulder. To my horror my hand met something…but it wasn’t my flesh. Looking over my shoulder I saw a miniature version of the giant spider from before. Only its legs were adhered to my skin from just above my shoulder blade to the top of my right shoulder. As it thrashed my stomach turned. I could see my skin lift with its legs as it tried to release itself. With every motion the thing made, the pain intensified.

*"RELEASE ME! OR I WILL TEAR YOUR BODY APART, PIECE BY PIECE!"* The spider glared at me and lifted a front leg causing another wave of pain to hit me.

"If I do, you will kill me. I don't know how you got stuck to me… but I'm not gonna let you kill me!" With that thought the spider suddenly went still. The spider looked at me with frozen shock. Feeling a sense of confidence wash over me I asked, "What? Lost your fight?"

*"How did you paralyze me? What power did you use? What sick abilities do you possess?"* The spider's voice rang in my head incessantly as I stood to look for my shirt.

"Shut up! I don't know what is going on any more than you do!" Finding my shirt a few feet away I quickly attempted to put it on. Sadly the spider's bulk impeded my ability to do so. "Look… if I knew how to free you from my back I might do it. But you need to swear to me that you will not attack me anymore! I just want to figure out where I am and go home." I just tied my shirt around my waist admitting defeat.

The spider continued to glare at me for a few moments before nodding and replying, *"I will not harm you any further. At this point I wish to know what you are more than I wish to eat you."* The spider slumped a little.

"Alright. Then, until we figure out what's going on… truce?" I asked, watching the spider as it slumped more, and I realized that its body was starting to meld onto my flesh. "WHAT? What are you doing?" I protested.

The spider looked at itself and in a shocked tone thought. *"I'm sinking into your body… so you are some form of shape shifting ooze! I knew you were an Eidolon!"* It looked at me accusatory and tried to lift itself up, but to no success.

"I am not an ooze! Or whatever an Eidolon is! I'm a human. This has to be your…"

(SNAP)

We both looked at each other and my eyes grew wide as a second (SNAP) came from just above us.

*“Be quiet. That is an Ent… if we remain silent it may leave us alone. I normally hunt them, but in my state it would take me a while to make the special net I need to catch one.”* The spider thought to me as I could see its eyes dart across the ceiling of the pit.

I simply nodded and we stayed motionless and silent for several more moments before another…

(CRACK) (SNAP… RUSTLE)

Tree roots ripped from the ceiling and grabbed at me. With a yelp I started to tear at the roots, but couldn't break through the bigger ones. That's when the spider called out, *"Try to release me! Use your ability to simply release me. Feel it!"* The spider was biting at the roots and trying to break my backside free. *"I will eat it and then that will return me to my original size. Then we can figure out what you are."*

I thought to myself, this bastard is sadly my best bet at survival. So I did what it suggested. I thought about it. I thought about releasing it from my back.

And it really was that easy. The second I thought about releasing the spider all 8 legs were off my back and free. Within seconds my body had been freed from the roots.

*"Climb! We need to get you above ground. You will be bait while I spin the net to catch the Ent."* The spider rushed for my head and pointed at where the opening was. *"GO!"*

I did as I was told. I dived for the opening and straight into the waiting jaws of the Ent. Its form was a bent and mangled sight. Much like the first time, it had a wooden maw made from the inside of the tree it inhabited lined with rows of jagged splinters.

The spider cackled confidently and shot a giant ball of gray silk into the back of the tree's mouth. The ball exploded sending the tree reeling backwards. I used this moment to scramble out of the hole and away from the seething, 30 ft. douglas fir. Getting to my feet I ran in a random direction.

(CRACK)

I didn't dare to look back. I heard the spider mentally call out. *"I need time to make a net to catch the Ent. It's only edible while it's in floating state. I will wait in ambush for it to fly near one of my pits and shoot it out of the sky."* It hops off my head and into a bush at the base of another large oak. *"Another of my pits. Sadly empty, but perfect for our purpose. Keep its attention and when I call out bring it this way."*

*"Fuck, why am* ***I*** *bait?"* I thought to myself as I nodded and looked back the way we came. Seeing the flying Eyeball speeding for a tree a few yards from the tree the spider had hid under.

*"You can speak in my mind. Good. Keep communication silent. Ents may not be able to speak, but they are smart and can understand speech."* The spider thought back immediately, after a beat adding, *"You are its prey already. That is why."*

*"Right… on both accounts. Fine."* I thought to myself again and took off towards the sound of the river making sure I could track my way back to this tree. *"If you run away and Fuck me over I will find a way to haunt you."* I thought as threatening as I could convey in a thought.

The spider remained silent as I sped towards the river the Eyeball in hot pursuit. All I needed to do was distract this thing for a few moments? Easy I thought. I'll just go in a wide spiral towards the tree. After a few hundred feet pain ripped through me starting at my shoulder and radiating to my core. *"What did you do?"* The spider roared at me as I spun around and started instinctively running back towards the pit.

*"Nothing! I just ran. I'm coming back towards you though. I have a theory."* As I had suspected the moment I started running back the pain subsided. *"I guess we have a range limit now."*

*"Your strange ability is becoming more annoying by the moment."*.

I would love to give a play by play of how I dodged the Eyeball. However, I was so focused and scared I can barely remember much from those few minutes. After a few tense moments of cat and mouse, the spider finally called out. *"Ready! Bring it this way."*

I obeyed and started to run back towards the spider. Running to make sure I would give the spider a good shot at the Eyeball from its pit. I stopped at the base of the tree to catch my breath. My feet presumably a few inches from the side of the pit. *"Now remember, this is my meal. Once I'm finished If there is anything left you may have the remains as a reward for playing bait."*

Before I could respond something in the distance caught my eye. The fog seemed to be rolling in again. The thick mist was closing in on our location and for the first time in what seemed like forever I could begin to hear the sound of traffic in the distance. My attention was snapped back to the situation at hand though as the Eyeball grew closer.

The Eyeball sped towards me clearly preparing to take over the tree I was leaning against. However just as it got within a few yards of the tree a blue net of some sort launched from the ground and ensnared the Eyeball. The Eyeball fell under the weight of the net and was knocked back slightly. The spider sprang from the pit and landed on top of the Eyeball, sinking its fangs into its spectral "body".

*"Hey. Something is going on. I can hear traffic again and there is this fog rolling in on us."* I tried to explain to the spider as the fog finally washed into the area around us and began to cover my feet, rising up to meet my legs in quick order.

*"Don't distract me while I eat, human!"* The spider quipped back in an aggressive tone presumably engrossed with its kill.

*"I just think…"* Was all I could get out before I was hit once more by that intense memory that wasn't mine. Only this time it was seemingly playing in reverse. With everything flowing backwards. The only difference was the rage. The rage stayed throughout as the memory rewound itself. And once it got back to the beginning, I caught a quick glimpse of the rear view mirror and got to see "myself".

I was a Caucasian man in his late 20s or early 30s. A big bushy beard of blonde hair with a bald head. That and some facial features is all I could make out before my senses came back to me.

I was standing in the middle of the park's parking lot. Just a few hundred feet from my car and the old Chevy from earlier. I looked at my feet and saw the spider was gone. I was able to breathe a sigh of relief when I felt a pain in my shoulder and heard in my head. *"Why did you interrupt my meal? And where are we? This is not my forest."*

"No." My voice cracked as I began to break into tears running for my car. "This is my home! I'm back!" I sped for the car at first then remembered the man in the Chevy. I weighed my options and decided I didn't want to know if he was still alive or not. I just wanted to get home and get somewhere safe.

As I approached my car I was both confused and relieved to see that the window was in fact not shattered anymore, nor was the window even rolled down. I realized in my haste I left the keys in the ignition with the car still on, but no issue seemed to come from it. The pain on my shoulder grew as the spider spoke up again. *"I do not know what you are doing to me now, but I am suddenly incredibly tired. If this is a ploy…"*

*"Oh just shut up already. I'm not trying to hurt you! Look. I'm going to go home and try to figure this shit out. Just please keep quiet for a bit while I try to relax."*

*"Fine…"* It thought before the pain subsided and the spider went quiet. Thinking about it for a moment I cautiously looked back at my shoulder. Sure enough there was the spider, it looked pressed to my back like some hyper realistic tattoo. Satisfied by that insane reasoning for the moment I got into my car, sat down, and cried.

Some time later I calmed myself down and drove home. It was late by the time I pulled in. Thankfully Andrew's toy was gone. My roommate was in the living room eating something while he watched an episode of old Family Guy. He took one look at me and my disheveled clothes, puffy eyes, and just nodded. He may be an asshole sometimes, but at least he knows when to keep to himself.

That's it. I got home and started typing. It's around 10 am Friday morning now. I fell asleep at my computer around the time I met the Spider. I woke up a few hours ago and decided to finish this entry over coffee and some breakfast.

The spider hasn't woken up yet, but when it does I hope we can peacefully exchange some information. Thankfully I'm off today and tomorrow this week.
