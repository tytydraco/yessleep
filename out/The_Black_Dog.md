I seen it for the first time on the day the lights went out inside my apartment.
Not only the bulbs..but the light. The warm. That hum that brings a house to life.

He sat at the edge of my bed.
That dog, if one could call it a dog.
Its fur resembled that of shadows, breathing and thick, curling as if it were smoke. It’s Eyes like dead stars. When the dog moved, there was no sound at all, just the faint rattle of chains produced as they dragged behind it.

I tried chasing it away.
It didn’t snarl, it didn’t bark.
It’s head tilted and it followed me as I walked away.

After that, I’d catch glimpses of it everywhere. Following behind me on the sidewalk, in the train windows reflection, crouching down in the corner of my bedroom. At times it whispered. At times it would sigh.

It would call me by my name.

“You’ve brought me here.”

Nights had become much longer. When I slept, it would crawl onto my chest, crushing me until I woke up gasping for air. I’d desperately shield my chest, feeling the creatures claws ripping into my ribs, trying to completely dig them out. 

Nobody else could see it.
My mother told me I had appeared more tired. My boss suggested I take a break for a while. My friends phone calls had stopped. The dog grew large. It started eating more. My own food. My relationships, my finances, My time…My reflection…

When I did smile, it grinned back at me with way too many teeth for one mouth.

At one point I attempted to lock it outside.
I shut all my doors, all the windows, and every single light. I still heard its breathing from inside the walls. Scratching … waiting.

It was never outside, always inside.

The last night had arrived quietly . The air was heavy, as if the world was holding its breath. By the window I sat, accompanied  with a bottle and a note I hadn’t finished. The dog stay put beside me, resting its head on my knee as if it cared. Its eyes were no longer cruel…but tired. Like my own

“If you leave ,” it said in a hushed tone, “I leave too.”

For a brief second, I almost felt sorrow for it. This monster that had faithfully followed me seemingly forever. I realized then.. the thing wasn’t following me. It was me.

Every bite, every chain, every shadow left behind had all come from my own hands. My heart. My voice. I felt this way for years.

I peered down at the thing trembling. It glanced back at me. Maybe if I had stopped breathing… it would stop breathing also.

The night felt like forever.
The bottle was now empty. The note remained blank. I struggled to find the words, not for anybody else, not even for me. Just the raindrops hitting the window and the soothing hum of the refrigerator is what filled the apartment.

At my feet, the dog curled, waiting.. watching. I reached down and ran my fingers through its dark fur. All I felt was cold. More soft than expected. For the first time, rather than it feeling like fear, It felt understanding.

“I’m tired,” I whispered. 

The dogs head lifted and it pressed its muzzle against my hand, and breathed out slow. A sigh. It felt like forgiveness.

Outside, dawn crept through the blinds, gray and faint.I did not move. Didn’t shed tears. Just sat, allowing the light to touch us both.

And for a split moment, I thought to myself that maybe the sun would be enough.
Maybe I’d try again. Maybe I’d breathe again. Maybe I’d live

But the dog stayed close to me.
And I stayed closer to it.

When the light fully penetrated the room, only one of us opened our eyes. 

The day was new… a new beginning… a new journey… a new light for me. I felt something I haven’t felt in a long time, and all was quiet
