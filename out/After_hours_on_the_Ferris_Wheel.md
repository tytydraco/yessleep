I felt like a king.  My arm around Claire, as dozens of men drooled with wide-eyed jealousy, muttering words that did not reach my ears.  How could such a scrawny guy land a chick hotter than the women in their dirty magazines?  I wondered that myself.  I was only twenty-two and yet the greatest night of my life had begun when we stepped foot into the carnival.

I had first met Claire at our co-ed kickball league.  We connected immediately.  She loved my self-deprecating humor, and I loved… well I loved everything about her.  She was fiercely athletic in both sports and regular life, always standing out amongst a crowd.  And to me, this was a major turn-on.  When the sun hit her long red hair, she reminded me of a powerful queen from my fantasy books.

On our third date, as we strolled past cotton candy vendors and carnival games, the Ferris Wheel came into view.

“Joel, we have to ride the Ferris Wheel.  I know the place is closing soon, but my friend Chloe is the ride operator, and I’ve got something special planned for us tonight.”

Curiosity bubbled in my stomach, not sure whether I should be excited or nervous.  My first thought was sexual; we had not yet been intimate.

“Okay, sure.  Let’s do it.  Are they going to like let us stay on longer than other people?  It’s usually a pretty short ride.  Are you sure I’m even big enough for this ride?”

Claire chuckled and patted my back.  “Joel, you are such a riot.  Let’s go!”

We shuffled through the line with Clarie telling people she worked there.  When we got to the front, Chloe opened the gate and sent us on our way.  We took our seats and the ride jolted.

“If I had a nickel for every time I rode a Ferris Wheel with a beautiful woman, I’d have one nickel.”

“You are too funny.”  Claire leaned her head on my chest as we took flight.

During our descent, I noticed a man staring at me from just beyond the ride line.  Almost like he was studying me, his face stayed focused on me as we headed back up into the air.  After about ten minutes of going up and down and all riders having exited accept us, Chloe nodded at Claire, the signal that she would let us stay on the ride.  When we reached the highest point, the ride stopped.  I looked over the edge and noticed that the carnival was almost empty, with people heading for the exits.  Even Chloe was gone.  Some of the lights for the carnival games shut off.

“I think they are closing down.”

Claire gently grabbed my face and gave me a kiss on the cheek.  “Joel, I want you inside of me… now.”

My groin throbbed, as Claire gently pulled down my jeans and boxers.  She removed her skirt and threw herself on top of me.  The cart rocked back and forth.  It was total bliss, and I was getting closer to release until I noticed something off about Claire.  With each drawn-out moan, Claire’s mouth widened, and I caught a glimpse of her teeth.  Sharp and pointy, not something I had noticed before.  And then it happened.

Two horns jutted out of her head.  I tried to push her off me, but it felt like a giant boulder was sitting on my lap.  She thrusted harder.

“Joel, don’t go soft on me!”

I headbutted her and finally shoved her away.  Claire stood up, as two wings shot out of her back, flinging bits of her skin across the pod. 

“I need you, Joel!”

The ride booted up again. 

“Claire, please don’t kill me.  I don’t know what the fuck you are, but please just let me go.”

My body shook like one of those bells a salvation army worker rattle to draw your attention.  I thought I was done with, finished.  But as we made it to ground-level, I saw the guy from earlier who had been staring at me.  But this time, he had a crossbow, and it was aimed directly at Claire.

The impact when it connected with her head, caused her head to explode like a watermelon filled with firecrackers.  I was speechless and in a daze.  The man walked away without saying a word, as I stood there covered in gunk.  As I walked back through the fairgrounds, the place was empty.  Not a person in sight.  I got into my car and sobbed, horrified at what I had just experienced.  I’ve decided to take a break from dating.
