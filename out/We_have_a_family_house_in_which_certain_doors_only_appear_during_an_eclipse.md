We call them the astral doors. All black in colors, those astral doors are then divided into two categories. There are the sun doors, only visible during both solar and lunar eclipses, but only openable during solar eclipses. There are also the moon doors, only visible during both solar and lunar eclipses, but only openable during lunar eclipses. The remaining ones are the earth doors or the 'normal' doors visible every day at anytime.

Though the house belongs to my family since the 18th century, no family member lives there and the residence is instead used for a secret family ritual. It served as a correction program for the difficult teenager that I was, and a good dissuader to remove me from the path that I had chosen. The ritual only takes place during eclipses, having the exact same duration as the astral phenomenon. I did not know about all that I just mentioned before my parents told me those things themselves, while driving me to that house on Monday, 21st August 2017.

I set my eyes on the massive house when we arrived there during the early hours of the day. I had the duty to step into all the sun rooms and leave the moon rooms alone, and also avoid touching anything or anyone I could possibly see or meet respectively. No matter what happens, I had to avoid defending myself and instead flee or hide in case of any danger, and also avoid spending more than one minute inside an astral room.

"There's nothing more we can tell you or do to you at this point Desmond. Since you can't listen to us, you should try to listen to yourself." The confusing words of my father before I entered the house.

Of course, I did not really believe them in the first place, and I was expecting some elaborate prank like scenario to scare me away from my lifestyle at the time. The house is actually beautiful, I admit it. Everything in the house was clean and polished as if it was taken care of by someone, but according to my parents, not even a maid was allowed inside. I wondered in the building, thinking about the wild parties I would be throwing in secret with all that space, I mean, that house has 55 normal doors. At some point, I had even forgotten about the eclipse and the ritual.

All of a sudden, as I walked in a corridor, I noticed the outlines of something slowly taking form on my way. Soon, I could identify a door frame before the door itself fully materialized to my disbelief. It had a drawing or symbol, representing the eclipse and the specific phase of that eclipse it was tied to. It was a moon door, standing in the corridor without any support. Its symbol represented the first phase of a lunar eclipse. My stubborn teenage self tried to open that door but it was locked, since that day there was instead a solar eclipse occurring. My parents' words were proving true.

I continued to wonder in the house and I found a sun door, in between two very close windows, suggesting that nothing except the outside could be behind that misplaced door. Its symbol was that of the solar eclipse first phase or first contact. I opened the door, dumbfounded to see a spacious room all painted in white, only containing a white crib in the middle. I approached the crib and found a baby boy that looked very pleased to see me, smiling and giggling the moment he saw me.

Not knowing what to do and thinking that I was losing my mind, I walked backwards then turned around, ready to leave the room while the baby giggled louder behind me. I closed the door, wondering what was that about and what was that house. Another phenomenon interrupted my thoughts when I saw the door slowly disappear until only the wall was left.

That was it. I knew that I was a difficult child, but my parents could not let me be in that paranormal manor. I ran to the front door ready to leave but found it locked. I banged and screamed to no avail. I looked through a window but could not see my parents, and only noticed the slowly darkening sky. I turned around and saw another sun door standing without any support. Its symbol represented the second contact and was logically the next room I had to visit. I ignored it, choosing to run away from it instead. I ran until I met it blocking my way at the end of a corridor. I could not believe my eyes. The door slowly opened, adding to my nervousness as I trembled in fear. I expected my doom to emerge from that room, but instead, a kid, dressed with a medieval costume and armed with a plastic sword, stormed out of the room. I screamed and he laughed before he started talking under his knight helmet.

"Got you, got you, got you!" He shouted in joy, jumping around me.

"What? Who? Who are you? What are you doing here?" I asked.

"Who am I?" He asked back, surprised by my question as he stopped jumping around. "Is it a new game you're playing?" He asked, confused by my questions.

"A new game? Kid, this place is not normal, we gotta get out. What you doing here?"

"Dangerous? No, this is home. Don't you remember?"

"Home? Remember what?"

"You wanna play theâ€”" The kid tried saying before he gasped. "I have to go." He added before storming inside the sun room he ran out of. He then waved me goodbye before closing the door which was already fading out of existence. What was that place? I wondered.

Darkness had covered the outside as the eclipse approached its totality. I tried to open the windows to escape and even use any object to break those windows, all to no avail. Along the way, moon doors were still appearing which of course I ignored and could not open anyway. The third sun door, representing totality soon appeared on a wall next to me and seemed to follow me by teleporting to the closest wall to me no matter the direction I took to escape it. I finally opened it and found a room full of mirrors.

"Yo Dez! Come in bro! What you doing outside there?" Said all the Desmonds in the mirrors.

Each of them then tried to offer me something, be it alcohol, drugs and any material thing that was appealing to me at that point in my life. Remembering that I should not touch anything, I declined all the offers. One of them, who happened to be the only one calm and sober then reminded me that I should not last in the room. I looked at the door that was already disappearing slowly before dashing towards it, under the insults of all the others who wanted me to stay there. I barely made it out.

There was no escape. I just remained in the same corridor waiting for the next door to appear and so it did after a few minutes. Its symbol represented the third contact. I just wanted to go in, see everything that I had to see and storm out. As soon as I opened the door, a foul smell invaded the air. I found rotting food, rotting meat, empty syringes, empty bottles and many more dirt littering the place.

"Stupid brat! It's all your fault!" I heard a growling man's voice behind me.

Hiding behind the door, a bald man having his whole head covered with tattoos attacked me with an axe. I dodged every time to the best of my ability, even getting the axe stuck in a wooden furniture. Unfortunately, I tripped on a piece of rotten food and fell on my back. The man seized the opportunity to strangle me and at some point, then punched me in the face to knock me out. The attack landed on my nose and broke it. Some blood streamed from my right nostril and strangely, the same happened to his nose too. He grew annoyed at the occurrence and pulled out a knife from behind his back. I stabbed him in the belly using a syringe I managed to lay my hand on and immediately felt the pain as if I had stabbed myself instead.

I saw the door slowly disappearing and survival instinct kicked in, allowing me to push him away. I limped to the door slowed down by the pain but fortunately, he was too. I exited the room before him and slammed the door behind me. The blade of his knife pierced the door right after before it all disappeared in front of my eyes, then, I collapsed on the floor, defeated by the pain.

Lying down on the floor, I then heard the sound of music playing behind me a few minutes after that attack. I looked back and saw the last sun door, with the symbol representing the fourth contact, the last phase of a total solar eclipse. The door slowly opened and I crawled away, expecting to be attacked again. The music grew more audible and I recognized it. A famous song talking about the sunset of a man's life. Through the opening, I saw the back of a wheelchair occupied by a gray haired person.

Gathering the courage and the force to stand up, I then approached and stepped into the room. The room was empty, painted in a white that had faded due to time and negligence. It was also covered with thick dust. I walked around the man and he looked at me. I recognized his face tattoos and jumped back in fear, it was an older and fragile version of the man who attacked me earlier. The old man had a revolver in one hand and a very fancy smartphone, that I can only describe as a translucent or glass smartphone in his other hand. While the device played the music, he just addressed me a look between profound sadness and accusation. Before I could consider fleeing, he spoke.

"Desmond, you still have time." He said. I looked closely to his face and noticed that the man resembled an older version of my father behind all the tattoos. But it was not my father. In fact, I recognized exactly who it was, and who were all of the others. I approached, full of emotions and on the verge of tears.

"I will do better. I promise." I replied, gently taking the gun from his hand and the weapon turned into dust.

The door then slowly faded out of existence, and I made my way towards it. Before I stepped out, I looked back to see the man, but there was just an empty wheelchair. I then made my way to the entrance of the house, slowed down by the physical and emotional pains. The sky was back to some brightness as the eclipse was about to end, on that part of the world at least. A moon door that had appeared attracted my attention the moment I touched the entrance door handle. Someone was gently knocking from inside that moon room. I ignored it and exited the house.

Crying in joy and relief, my mother hugged me while my father just stood in front of us and asked if I understood and if I was ready. I responded positively by just nodding, and we made our way back to where we live up to this day. On the way home, my father added something more of great importance concerning the house: never be in that house during a lunar eclipse, never open a moon door.
