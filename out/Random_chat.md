It was just like every other day. I finished my classes and headed home. It was a average evening and the busses and bikes and cars were hustling back to their respective homes. I returned to my home too. It winter season so it gets dark fairly early these days so I changed my clothes made my dinner and watched a video to finish my meal. I didnt have much work to do anyways so I looked up some omegle alternatives and started checking out the websties. Most were just poor copies and had too many bugs or they didnt have much users and it got pretty boring quickly. However there was this website which looked fairly better and after using it for a while it wasnt so bad so I continued using it. Mostly it was just horny dudes looking for women but I kept going hoping id find someone fun or not horny at the very least. As I kept going I got a call from my parents and after talking for half an hour I returned to the website to find that I had matched with someone named "life advices". But the thing is that we matched over 30 minutes ago and they hadnt skipped. I thought they might have been away too and it was sheer coincidence that we matched and went afk at the same time but just to be sure I typed in a hi.

Hi.

They replied almost immediately. Strange I thought that they never started the convo but replied immediately even after 30 mins of waiting. I thought to myself to not question it much tho and decided to continue the convo normally.

Hru? I asked.

Im fine.

Then there was a long pause. I expected them to ask how I am at the very least but they never did.

I decided to break the silence and I didnt have a topic so I asked him about his name. "So u give life advices huh?"

Yes.

"Give me one then" I said.

There was a long pause and I thought to myself that he must be cooking up some goofy things so I waited anyways. It was better than constantly skipping horny people anyways. After 2 minutes I got a reply.

Now I expected a totally random bs but all I got was 1 word. It said "sleep".

I laughed.

"What kind of advice is this?" I asked.

They didnt reply. I waited about 2 mins and realised I wasnt getting my entertainment or a good convo out of this person whoever it is so I decided to skip them and move on.

I kept on skipping people hoping the next convo would be good but it never happened and I fell asleep with my phone on my hands. I woke up the next morning with a stiff neck probably because of my akward sleeping posture. I saw my phone and remembered I forgot to charge it last night and even worse I had some random website running. I unlocked my phone to check the battery and close the website and saw that I was at 50% and while trying to close the website, I noticed I had once again matched to the same person "life advices" but this time they had texted first and not just one message, I had 14 unread messages. As I scrolled thru the texts it was all just a repetition of "sleep" "sleep" "sleep". As I scrolled, the last two message wasnt the same repetition of sleep. It said "im watching". And the last message said "good morning". I checked the timeline of the texts and the good morning text was sent just 3 minutes before I woke up.

Goosebumps covered my skin and I could feel each of my hair stand upright. I was shocked. I dont live in any of the common countries so there was no way they could have known my timings. Nothing in my profile gave it away either and I never mentioned my country or anything traceable to them. I stared at the texts for a while not knowing what to do. I wanted to shake it off and move on but something didnt let me. I grew hyper aware of my surroundings and now after reading the text, I felt watched. Since it was still winter it was fairly dark outside however I couldn't get myself to move. I am never this paranoid but for some reason I felt like the crack in the door besides the switches was slowly growing. I kept imagining a hand just grabbing onto me as soon as I tried gathering up the courage to go there. I lay on my bed absolutely paranoid unable to do anything. I lay there as much as I remember and eventually I fall asleep again. I wake up a while later and check my phone but theres nothing. No chats, no history. It cant be a nightmare? It was too good and real to be a nightmare and it cant be real either? However since then I have never been able to talk to random strangers or been able to shake off the feeling that I am being watched and its eating me from the inside. I cant sleep at nights and need to wait each day for my body to give up and pass out and I cant hold up with this anymore.
