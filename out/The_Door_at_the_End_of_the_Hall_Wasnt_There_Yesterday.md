When my grandparents passed, I inherited their house.

It wasn’t much to speak of—a small, two-story home nestled at the edge of a quiet, forested town—but it had a charm to it, the kind you only find in places that have been lived in for decades. My mother wanted nothing to do with it. She’d left home at eighteen and rarely looked back, saying there was too much history in those walls. I didn’t understand what she meant at the time.

I do now.

I moved in last spring, determined to make it my own. The house needed work—peeling paint, a leaky roof, creaking floorboards—but it was mine, and I was proud of it. For the first few weeks, I kept busy cleaning and fixing what I could. I painted the walls, replaced the locks, and even sorted through the boxes in the attic, unearthing relics of a life I barely knew.

It wasn’t until I’d settled in that I noticed the door.

At first, I didn’t think much of it. Houses settle, walls shift, and memory is a fickle thing. Maybe I just hadn’t noticed it before, tucked at the end of the hallway, its dull surface blending into the pale plaster. It wasn’t worth a second thought.

But that was before I realized it wasn’t supposed to be there.

The hallway had always been an unremarkable stretch of space: three doors evenly spaced along the wall. My room. The bathroom. The closet. It had been that way for as long as I could remember. But now there was a fourth, and no matter how much I tried to ignore it, the thought of it stuck in my mind like a splinter.

The next time I passed it, I slowed, eyes drawn to the crack under its frame. There was no light bleeding through, no air stirring, but the space beneath the door seemed wrong. Too narrow. Too dark.

I should’ve stopped. I should’ve stared it down, but something about it repelled me—like looking too long might invite it closer. I walked on, refusing to glance back. But even as I left it behind, I felt its presence settle in my chest, heavy and expectant.

By the third day, the door felt larger.

It hadn’t grown—I checked, glancing quickly as I passed, a stolen glance like a child avoiding something shameful. It was still the same size, the same dull wood, the same smudged brass knob. But it felt larger, like it took up more space than it physically occupied, like the hallway itself was bending around it.

At night, I lay in bed and swore I could feel it there, a weight pressing against the edges of my mind. My dreams grew strange—images of empty corridors, endless rows of doors that opened to nothing but more doors. I told myself it was just my imagination. Doors don’t move. They don’t watch.

But when I woke up and stepped into the hallway, I found myself staring at it again, as if I’d been pulled there in my sleep.

The door didn’t belong.

That was the thought that consumed me as I stood there one evening, frozen halfway down the hall. It was just a door—wood, hinges, a knob. Nothing about it should have felt threatening. But it didn’t feel like something a person had made. It was too still, too deliberate, as though its very existence in my home was an act of will. Its surface looked too smooth in places, almost wet, while other parts seemed aged, warped, like it had been sitting there for decades. The closer I got, the more the texture seemed to shift, like the grain of the wood couldn’t decide what it wanted to be.

I backed away.

The days stretched into a week, and the hallway became a gauntlet.

Every time I passed, I told myself I wouldn’t look at it. And every time, I failed. My glances grew longer, lingering, as though the door were daring me to come closer. Its presence had a gravity to it, subtle but unyielding, pulling my thoughts back even when I was nowhere near the hallway.

I stopped using the kitchen at night. I stopped leaving my room unless I had to. But it didn’t help. The door was there in my mind, no matter where I went, a constant weight pressing against the edges of my thoughts.

What was behind it?

One night, I couldn’t resist any longer.

I found myself standing in the hallway, barefoot, the dim glow of the nightlight casting long shadows. The door was waiting, as it always was, but tonight it felt… eager.

I reached for the knob before I could stop myself. The brass was cool under my fingers, colder than it should have been, like it had been pulled from deep underground.

I hesitated. My breath caught in my throat as the silence pressed against me, thick and unyielding. Somewhere in the house, a clock ticked, and the sound seemed deafening, the only thing tethering me to reality.

I turned the knob.

The door swung inward with an almost imperceptible sigh, as though it had been holding its breath.

At first, there was nothing. Just a room.

The air was stale, the kind of stillness that clings to spaces long forgotten. The walls were bare, the paint a dull, off-white that might once have been bright but had long since faded. A single light bulb hung from the ceiling, swaying slightly, though there was no breeze to move it.

It wasn’t the room itself that unsettled me. It was how ordinary it was.

This was a place that didn’t belong—not in my house, not anywhere I could name—but it looked so normal it hurt. The angles of the walls seemed slightly off, the kind of imperfection you couldn’t put your finger on but could feel in your gut.

And in the center of the room, there was a chair.

Plain wood. No cushions. No carvings. Just a chair, sitting in the middle of the room, facing the doorway. Facing me.

The light bulb flickered once, briefly, and for that instant, the room was swallowed by darkness. But it wasn’t the kind of darkness that obscures—it was the kind that clarifies, stripping away the pretense of what things ought to be. In the absence of light, the walls rippled like living skin, the corners stretched outward into unseen distances, and the chair blurred, its edges softening into impossible curves, as though it wasn’t in the room but the room existed within it. Shadows crawled across the floor, curling around the chair’s legs, shifting with whispered shapes—arms, spines, things almost human but too alien to comfort.

When the bulb flared back to life, the room snapped into its banal state: bare walls, a plain chair, stagnant air. But the shadows lingered in my mind, burned into the edges of my vision, as if they had never truly left.

The hallway is silent now, the door gone as though it had never been there—but I know better. It’s waiting, somewhere, in the unseen corners of my home, and I fear that the next time I glance in its direction, I won’t have the strength to turn away.
