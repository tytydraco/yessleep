Okay, I know what I'm gonna tell y'all might sound absolutely crazy, but it's nothing but the truth, but I guess I should tell y'all about myself, my name is Andrew, and I live in a small town with all my buddies, Chris, Jacob, and Issac, Jacob recently lost his daughter due to an incident at a daycare he supervised his daughter at, no offense, he did a shit job at it, but I still feel bad for him, enough talk, allow me to tell y'all my story.



So I was on my way to visit an abandoned museum Issac told me, he theorized that it might be connected to this 'Silencer' guy, to me he sounded like a creep, hiring people in suits to kidnap people, but after this experience, I fully know what these creatures are, and how they came to be, so a few hours later, my legs tired, wanting to rest, I finally arrived at the Museum Issac told me, it looked abandoned alright, too abandoned, I took a few minutes to rest my legs, since I did walk a total of 1/2 hours to get here, once I've fully recovered, I went inside, the place smelt foul and rotten, smelled like a dead corpse of a wild bull, I ventured forward into the dark, abandoned, museum.



I visited some exhibits, the 1976 exhibit, the 2012 exhibit, hell I thought this place was just a yearly history museum, but the years ended on 2022 strangely, maybe this is the year this museum went dead and had to abandon it, but little did I know, I'd find out the truth in some shape or form, I just didn't know where to look, I also visited some employee only rooms, like it mattered, no one ran the place anymore, and no one would bother to be here, that's what I thought, I entered the boss's office and the stench of the dead was stronger than before. "Why is this fucking bullshit stench getting more and more bullshit!" I exclaimed to myself, cautiously exploring the room.



I came across documents, 6 of them that looked out of place, they looked like they weren't anything about this museum at all, was this why Issac wanted me to come here, for these documents, I thought so anyway, I grabbed them and put them in my mini sack I took with me, but not before seeing the rotting corpse of the boss, I backed up and gagged, almost throwing up. "Alright, fuck this, I already got what I came here for, I just gotta leave." I left the office and made my way to the exit, but before I could make it a few steps away from the 21th century zone, I heard... shuffling of slabs and stones, I turned behind me and saw a statue moving on it's own, I thought this place was haunted, but what happened next made my blood turn into thin ice, the sides of the statue popped off, revealing arms, arms of a creature I couldn't recognize, once it fully emerged, I could see it's features, it had crazy red hair, big sharp teeth, pure black eyes, springy limbs and neck, and it's whole body was covered in blood, it suddenly roared at me and charged towards me.



I started running as fast as my legs could carry me, I could feel it's breath on my neck, it was inching closer and closer, I needed to get this creature away from me as fast as I could, so I found a broken stick, maybe I could use it to jab into this monster's throat, and that's what I did, once it got close, I yelled. "TAKE THIS YOU DEMON FROM HELL!" I jabbed the stick into the beast's throat, it choked and gagged on it, it gave me enough time to escape, but before I did, I heard... Something speak, in a deep, evil, and monstrous voice. "Clever... You 4 did something no one could accomplish, but you haven't seen the last of my tricks, once I get my family up and running again, all of humanity... Will perish." Out of flight or fight instinct I ran out the museum, promising to never return again.



So yea, that's how I explored and escaped a crazy museum, I think it was a trap made by this 'Silencer' monster, I think it's a monster, Issac plans to share these documents soon, I don't know how soon, but I know it's not long... Stay safe, and remember, don't ever enter an abandoned yearly history museum... Ever in your life...
