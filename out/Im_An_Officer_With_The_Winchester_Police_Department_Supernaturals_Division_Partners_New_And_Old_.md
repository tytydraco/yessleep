“Nope, no, *absolutely* not,” I said, stomping my foot in protest.

Lieutenant Dawn tossed a file across his desk, sighing heavily. “That’s funny, you say that as if you have a choice.”

I glared audaciously at Cameron, throwing my hands out in front of me. “*You can’t be serious!*”

He looked up at me with an expression that read: ‘I’m over it.’

“Deadly.”

I stomped my foot again. “Lieutenant, respectfully, have you lost your god damn mind?! Releasing Rudy is one thing, but recruiting him as an officer?”

Dawn sat up in his chair and cleared his throat uncomfortably. “Now that we’re…*short handed*, you need a partner. And Rudy was a hunter before so it shouldn’t be too hard for him to assimilate.”

A scoff escaped me.

Lieutenant Dawn leaned forward, his desk chair creaking as he did so. “This way we can closely monitor him and, can you think of a better way for him to serve his time usefully?” He challenged.

“Yes,” I stated bluntly. Keeping him downstairs being at the top of my list.

“Too bad!” He replied snarkily.

“But *me,* train *him?*” I pinched the bridge of my nose. “I’m nowhere near qualified for that! You *just* cleared me from rookiedom!”

“Lucky, you’ve been a cop for almost two years at this point. You have plenty of experience.”

“Killing revenants,” I added, “I have plenty experience killing them, not training them!”

“Lucky-“ Lieutenant Dawn warned, testingly. Apparently I’d worn his patience thin.

“Is there really nobody else that can take him?”

Cameron pressed his lips into a hard line. “No.”

With an exasperated sigh, I plopped down on the chair in front of him.

“I know, I know. You’re worried,” he said gently, offering a supportive hand. I took it. “But everything will be fine. He’s different than the others. He’s not *him.*”

My gaze met his. “There really no way out of this?”

Dawn chuckled softly, “Not a chance.”

“Okay.” The ghost of a smile appeared on my lips. “Whatever.”

A knock came from the other side of Lieutenant Dawn’s door before it opened, revealing a tall, older man. His long hair was sandy brown with some salty specks here and there. He wore a black leather jacket, some jeans, and a white undershirt that had motor grease stains on it. The helmet that rested on the man’s hip indicated he was a biker.

His face was hardened with years of life experience, but his eyes looked kind.

“Go on, get,” Dawn said playfully, shooing me out of his office. “I have a meeting.”

I stood and excused myself, giving the man a brief smile and nod of acknowledgement on my way out. He looked familiar to me but I couldn’t quite place why.

Shrugging it off, I made my way down to the holding area where my new trainee was waiting for me.

“Can you believe it?!” Rudy said excitedly, his eyes lighting up as he spotted me. He adjusted the sleeves on his new shirt, having just changed out of the grey jumpsuit he’d gotten used to wearing. Since his intake clothes had been discarded, he was given a set of jeans, white long sleeve shirt, light grey jacket, and a pair of beige work boots. “They’re giving me an apartment! Sure it’ll be heavily patrolled, but-”

“Yeah, that’s nice, Rudy,” I interrupted suddenly, catching a glimpse of a neatly pressed pantsuit coming down the hall. Attached to that pantsuit were a determined pair of eyes, looking right at me.

Fight or flight kicked in and I chose flight (rare for me, I know).

“But- but my stuff!” Rudy cried out as I drug him along with me.

“We can come back and get it later!” I said, navigating us into a busier area where police, perps, and personnel were hustling and bustling about.

Stealing a glance behind me, I thought I spotted a familiar brown bob, bobbing up and down in the crowd still hot on our tail.

“What is going on?!?” Rudy tried dragging his feet to get me to stop. He succeeded for a brief moment.

I snapped, turning to face him as waves of others walked around us in annoyance. “Will you just shut up! I need to think!” Turning back around, we weaved in and out of other people’s way, creating a complicated path to follow.

Rudy said nothing more, blindly following me with an offended and confused expression on his face as we continued to aimlessly flee through the precinct.

“She’s still behind us!”I mumbled. Though she wasn’t in sight, she was there. The feeling of curious green eyes burning holes into the back of my head alerted me to it.

Up ahead, I spotted a corridor that would lead out to the courtyard. Slowly an escape route formed in my mind. Once outside it would open up and be easier to get lost.

Abruptly, I pulled Rudy into a different corridor that would wind back around and lead us through a side door out to the parking lot. This fake-out would, hopefully, misleading our pursuer.

“Who?!” Rudy questioned as we ran, approaching the bright white light at the end of the tunnel, or in this case, the doorlight at the end of the hall. A bubble of hope welled within me as Rudy and I neared freedom.

“Hello!” Jane bubbly greeted, popping out of  a door in front of us to our right.

My shoulders slumped as I face palmed, bubble popped. “*Her.*”

“Remember me?” She asked Rudy, politely sticking out her hand. He gladly shook it, still mildly confused. “I’m Jane Doe, the division’s criminal profiler!”

I should’ve slapped that smile off her face then and there. It was fake, a mere ruse. Hidden beneath her warm and inviting exterior lay a mischievous serpentine. Jane could be one hell of a bitch when she wanted to be.

Jane then turned to me, causing my stomach to drop, as if she could read my thoughts.

“Lucky, where’ve you been loca? I went by your cabin but you weren’t there.”

I rolled my eyes, “Jane, you do *not* get to quote *Twilight* to me right now. And you didn’t find me because I haven’t been staying up there. Currently, I’m laid up in a hotel.”

“Oh, well,” she said beginning to twirl a stand of hair nervously, clearly not wanting to broach *that* topic around me just yet. “I’ve been looking for you.”

I crossed my arms into my chest and laughed. “Yeah, I know. I’ve been avoiding you.”

Jane frowned at that information.

“How did you figure out how to find us, anyway?” I asked, patting myself on the back, “That fake-out was pretty clever if I do say so myself.”

“It was,” Jane admitted with a shrug of her shoulders. She then winked at me and giggled, “But I’ve worked here way longer than you, Lucky Hale. I know the ins and outs of this building like the back of my hand. And, that shortcut I took was pretty clever too, if I do say so myself.”

An annoyed scoff left my mouth as I tried to turn and walk away. Jane maneuvered herself so that it wasn’t an option unless I directly crossed her path.

Another groan left my mouth as I stomped and pivoted to face away from her.

“Does someone want to fill me in?” Rudy asked, tapping his foot impatiently.

“‘Course I can!” Jane squeaked excitedly, running over to Rudy and wrapping an arm around his shoulders like they were best buddies. They both then faced me. “Lucky over there is a wi-“

“Nope. Not listening to it. You’re crazy.” I said, interrupting the profiler before the words could even finish leaving her mouth. With a huff, I started marching down the hallway, away from Jane. “I already told you I’m not talking about this.”

“You’re going to have to face the music eventually!” She shouted back.

Not bothering to turn, my hand flew up and flipped her the bird.

“Real mature there, Lucky.” Jane had to cuff her hands around her mouth to amplify her sound. “Why don’t you come find me when you’re ready to act like an adult and face the truth!”

A disingenuous two finger salute was all I could muster as a response. Jane “tsk’ed” at me before returning to her office.

Meanwhile, I had made my way outside and was enjoying the cold winters air.

“What was that all about?” Rudy asked, out of breath, after running to catch up to me.

Right after asking that question, my tummy rumbled angrily, demanding I put food into it. As if our stomachs were in agreement, his growled too.

With a sigh, I replied, “I don’t have the energy to explain on an empty stomach. Since I’m stuck with you, might as well grab some lunch.”

“Not going to say no to food,” Rudy shrugged.

Together, the two of us started to stroll towards the food truck’s that were usually stationed at the park entrance down the street.

After receiving our food from the slightly off-put vendor, Rudy had asked for his birria tacos to be extra *extra* bloody while flashing a fangy smile, we retreated to a secluded picnic table.

After wiping a light dusting of snow off the metal benches and table, the two of us sat down and enjoyed our street tacos.

The park around us could truly be described as a winter wonderland. Michigan had finally gotten a decent snow, about three to four inches, compared to the past couple of flurries that swept through the area leaving behind virtually nothing. Christmas trees, lights, a nativity scene, and other decorations had been set up all over the park and walking trails for the upcoming holiday. The festive music playing at the outdoor skating rink really tied everything in.

The temperatures had started to plummet as well. Apparently a couple people have already been hospitalized for hypothermia or so says the local news. They recently did a segment about staying vigilant while outside to avoid suffering from such a fate after a woman died from freezing to death.

After finishing my first taco, I looked over at Rudy, who was happily slurping away at his consomé, tacos untouched. While I reveled in the food’s warmth, the revenant barely seemed bothered by the cold and more interested in filling the pit in his stomach.

Internally I shrugged, figuring the undead don’t felt much anyway.

If you’re confused on how he hasn’t burst into flames yet, let me tell you. I’ve said it once, and I’ll say it again: the media does not portray supernatural lore correctly.

Vampires -and thus revenants- can day walk. Most choose not to because of the aversion to sunlight and sun poisoning sensitivity. Another reason being that their abilities are dampened in the daylight, and nobody likes to feel weak.

That’s why Dustin could shift even though it wasn’t a full moon. Werewolves, yes, are forced to shift during the full moon- but they can force a manual shift whenever they want or even stressful environmental factors can start to trigger it.

Speaking of, I was tired of people dancing around the topic for my sake. I needed someone to talk to about it. Since Beth was on vacation for the holidays, Rudy would have to be the next best thing.

A second taco disappeared into my stomach as I divulged everything that went down.

“I’d heard something had happened,” he said, bitting his thumbnail. “No wonder he reeked of wet dog.”

“Guess you’ve never smelled a werewolf before,” I said, realizing just how new he was to being supernatural. Sure, even though he doesn’t fully remember that he’d hunted them, he’s never experienced being one either.

Rudy slurped up the rest of his birria sauce, his breath becoming a visible fog as he let out a satisfied sigh. “So what does that whole thing have to do with Jane?”

“She thinks I’m a witch,” I explained.

“A witch?” His eyebrows furrowed curiously. “So, Jane’s a witch too. What’s the big deal?”

“No, you don’t understand,” I sighed, rubbing my temple. “There’s two kinds of witches.”

“Really?”

“Yes, really. You know how during the Salem Witch Trials, the accused were said to fraternize with the devil and dance around bonfires in the woods at night?”

“Sureeee,” Rudy replied, lying through his teeth.

I rolled my eyes. “Well, “the devil” was actually an Elder. Fae. One way humans are able to wield magic is going through a binding ritual with an Elder in order to serve them. Part of that ritual is dancing around a large bonfire under the moonlight.”

Rudy leaned in closer, intrigued. “And the other?”

I gulped. “The other way a human can wield magic is if they are a natural born witch. Meaning one of their ancestors had undergone the binding ritual I mentioned earlier, but with an immensely powerful Elder. So powerful that somewhere down the bloodline a descendant has that connection to the magic but not to the fae. Which, Is *extremely* rare.”

“Ohhhhh, I still don’t get it,” Rudy muttered, dumbly.

I groaned, pinching the bridge of my nose. “Jane thinks I’m a natural born witch.”

His eyes lit up as it finally clicked in his brain. “And you were avoiding her because you don’t think so?”

“No,” nervously I twiddled my thumb, ignoring the sinking feeling in my heart, “because I’m afraid she’s right.”

“Oh-“

“I-it explains so much,” I confessed, a stinging feeling erupting in my eyes as tears started to form. Before I could stop myself, the words fell from my mouth as I went into my backstory.

Before I joined the division, back in Chicago, I had a partner. Henry Olson.

He was my rock. Helped put me back together after my first six months on patrol. Being a new cadet was one thing, on top of being a woman… it was pure hell.

Like I’ve mentioned before, rookie was used derogatorily at my old precinct. I was bullied and constantly harassed by men higher in rank than me. Powerless to do anything and they knew it.

To be honest, I was thinking about quitting the force. Then I met Henry. He’d been an officer with CPD for almost five years at that point. Since it was protocol to pair more experienced officers with the newer ones, we were randomly put together due to luck of the draw.

Lucky, I was. Henry stood up to my bullies when he found out about them, and not only that, but he encouraged me to start standing up for myself as well. My confidence sky rocketed and I started performing better on all my tasks.

It sounds stupid to say, but Henry made me a better person. And together, we worked like a well oiled machine, keeping the streets of Chicago clean and safe.

And on top of his charming personality, his good character drew me in hook, line, and sinker. It was a bit taboo, but the two of us started dating two months in. Henry and I had become partners in both the literal and romantic sense. I don’t think I was ever alone during those months. We were always together, two peas in a pod.

Alas, what they say about good things never lasting is true. Everything went wrong six months into our partnership.

We’d been promoted and were working VICE then. Staking out a secluded barn on the outskirts of the city. It was rumored to be a storage facility belonging to a drug lord we were tracking down. Supposedly materials to make illicit substances were housed inside.

What we didn’t know was there was also a vampire nest that resided in there too. And they didn’t take kindly to unwelcome visitors.

Before we knew it, Henry and I had been pulled out of his car and severely beaten. Of course we tried to defend ourselves with our service weapons, but seeing as the attackers were supernatural, that did little more than piss them off.

Confused and scared why our bullets didn’t seem to work, the two of us were lined up execution style. Before I knew it, one of the male vampires revealed his true self and bared his fangs at Henry, allowing the true terror of the situation set in. With a sickening squelch, the vamp had unhinged his jaw and taken a giant bite out of Henry’s neck and shoulder.

The other two held me down while I struggled to free myself, forcing me to watch every agonizing second of my partners death. At one point it got too unbearable to watch. Involuntarily, my eyes had shut themselves, blocking the horrid sight in front of me.

All I remember after that point was a gut wrenching feeling surge through me. Then, suddenly, everything stopped. When my eyes opened again, the vampires were gone. Vanished into thin air. To this day nobody knows what happened to them.

Lying lifeless on the ground was Henry. Stumbling, I had pressed my hands into the gaping neck wound, hopelessly applying pressure to his vital arteries. Deep down though, I knew, he was gone.

Quietly, I sobbed over Henry’s body. I didn’t want him to end like that, *us* to end like that. It wasn’t fair, it couldn’t be.

The grief tore me into shreds, feeling like my insides were being torn apart. I didn’t know how to exist without Henry. I couldn’t go back to my life before. Alone, anxious, and antagonized. I couldn’t *allow* him to leave me. Not in that state.

It sounds stupid, but it’s like I willed him back. After a minute, Henry dramatically gasped to life, grabbing at his neck and throat.

Relieved, panicking, and fueled by adrenaline, I managed to pick him up and drag him to the car, high-tailing it out of there to the nearest hospital. After a week, the two of us barely pulled through.

I thought everything would be fine. Henry and I were both alive and that’s all that mattered. But shortly after we got home, Henry started to change. Or maybe, he hadn’t came back the same in the first place. Either way something about him was different.

He was pale and gaunt. The spark in his eyes had disappeared, replaced by something darker. Something I couldn’t possible begin to understand. Worst of all, was the hunger. After a couple days of trial and error, I discovered the thing that satisfied him most was raw, bloody meat.

I chalked it up to trauma at first, figuring his new found appetite was some sort of coping mechanism. We’d be okay, I reassured myself. Everything would go back to normal soon. He’d get over it and we could go back to our happy lives.

But things quickly got out of hand. Henry got hungrier, craved more and more. It got so bad that he physically attacked one night after dinner, almost killing me. He escaped and drained the first random person he saw. A single mother of four on her way home from her second job.

It was then that I knew that Henry wasn’t Henry anymore. How could I have possibly known that when he came back he’d come back as a monster? Came back as a revenant?

Feeling responsible for that woman’s death, I knew I had to track down and subdue him. By the time we crossed paths again, Henry was barely a shell of his former self. He’d morphed into something grotesque and unrecognizable, an insatiable and inhuman blood thirsty machine.

I almost died in that fight. Henry was ten times stronger than a normal vampire, fueled by all the blood he’d consumed. Somehow, I pulled through, managing to stake him right through the heart. Figuring if it looked like a vampire and acted like a vampire, why not kill it like a vampire?

It worked and for a brief, bittersweet moment, Henry returned back to me. He kissed me and said goodbye. Then he faded away and crumpled to ground. Left in his stead was a pile of ash.

After that, Dawn found me. Explained to me how the real world works and helped me clean up the mess. After that, he enlisted my help to take down the same nest that had attacked my Henry and I. Obviously, there were no qualms on my part and we got the job done.

That’s when I got my nickname, Lucky. Because that’s what I was. Lucky to have been partnered up with Henry Olsen. Lucky that I made it out of that storage facility attack alive. Lucky I wasn’t there to see what became of Henry after he had a mental breakdown and disappeared.

Lieutenant Dawn recruited me to the division. Seeing as there wasn’t much left for me in Chicago anyway, I left. Came here.

“Now, I’m here with you,” I said to Rudy, sniffling. At some point he’d reached his hand across the picnic table to comfort me. I’d never admit it, but it was helping.

I’d never told anybody that before. Not even Beth, but that’s because she doesn’t know what I really do for work. Lieutenant Dawn only knows because he was there with me, but that was at the end. In the beginning I was alone and had nobody to turn to.

“I understand,” he said, rubbing his thumb across the back of my palm. “I’m just as scared as you were. Terrified of myself, of hurting someone else.” Rudy ruefully chuckled, “You tell me how I was this monster hunter before, but I don’t know that man. He’s not me and I don’t want to be him. In the beginning, like you, I was alone in a new world where everything was unknown and different to me. But then, I turned myself in. Now, I’m here with you.”

I smiled a small smile. My new partner did the same.

After our conversation it felt… I dunno, *freeing?* Like a weight had been lifted off my chest. I wasn’t alone anymore, and Rudy… he was turning out to be alright.

The two of us jumped as my work phone started ringing. Instantly I answered it, recognizing the number. “What’d ya got?”

“Oh, you’re going to love this one,” dispatch said over the phone.

I rubbed my hands together while standing up from the picnic table. After getting all the details, it was time for Rudy and I to work the first case of the day. “Alright rookie, lesson one: cursed objects!”
