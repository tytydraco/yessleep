[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hjv2pm/if_you_ever_feel_a_strange_chill_in_the_air_then/)

I began my last account by mentioning that it was if a scar had been carved into me ever since the first night when she appeared, when her chill left me broken upon the floor. That scar has changed since then, and I do not know if I can even bear to call it a scar anymore, because a scar is supposed to hurt you, is it not?

That slight chill that still remains in me doesn’t hurt anymore, nor does it feel like an uncomfortable itch like it did before. Now, it only feels like a reminder of her presence. It ceases its chill and starts to emanate warmth whenever she is soon to appear, sometimes overwhelming me with anticipation. And she appears to me quite often now, yet no matter how frequently she shows herself, that excitement of hearing her voice for the first time in the library still has not left me, nor does it get weaker as she appears more.

Two days after vanishing at sight of the Burglar, she finally appeared in the library again, as I then was often sitting there, waiting for her to appear.

That day, however, she did not appear in some dark corner, or slowly emerge from behind a bookshelf to hide her demeanour as she had before. She instead appeared right before me, and I watched in awe as the misty droplets of a wet winter weaved and parted to make room for her glowing figure, though the glow has been diminishing now, as if she is becoming more corporeal the more we interact, slowly becoming more and more like the others.

“Are you alright?”, I quickly asked as I stood up, “I saw the fear on your face that night, as the burglar came through the fence. You had never seemed scared before. I have been so worried for as long as you did not appear.”

She remained quiet for some time, lightly gazing around the room as her ethereal figure seemed as if it was floating in the mist. She finally looked at me again, perhaps having realized that she was in the library, and her eyes pulled in my gaze just as they had done always.

“I do not know what happened to me…”, she softly spoke, “Ever since that black garbed figure appeared, it is as if I have dreamt for so long… of old memories which death had maybe been kind to try bury…”

She continuing staying where she was, and I pondered on whether I should walk closer to her, unsure as before then it had only been her to make that move successfully.

“I saw you wandering in this place,”, she said, “and no matter what I did I could not appear. It was like when I first remembered coming here, as if I was nascent and afraid, but with no choice of my own to be so.”, her eyes broke their contact with mine, andj fell slightly as they resumed the sadness I remembered from that first night.

I walked towards her, until we were even closer than we had been in the library before, though I was afraid to touch her, for I was still unsure of whether that would do something wrong, or perhaps the fear of the cold still lingered in me in part. But I did so anyway, and I put my hand over her shoulder, though it was higher than I had hoped, and colder too.

“But you are here now! You have appeared again, and anything that may be called danger, like that which we saw that night, is barred from the manor. I try to keep away sorrow from the manor, though I do not always know sorrow when I see it. Please, try to rid yourself of that fear, and perhaps that sorrow too if you wish.”

I expected that chill to erupt for a few moments again, as it always had before when I spoke so to her, but this time I was pleased as it did not, and I was pleased again as she looked up to meet my eyes again, and though she no longer appeared sad as she had before, her expression still lacked the warmth which I wished it would show.

“But if it comes again, what then? I don’t remember all that I should, and even less do I remember about why I should remember it all.”, she paused and took in long breaths, though I do not think she needed them, “Will this change? Were the others once like this too?”

My hand stayed softly where it was, “All who I saw at their arrivals were different in their own way from what they would come to be like, but you are different from them all in more ways than any of them were from each other. Right now, in the manor, you are like a star which outshines all those around it. You are unlike anyone I have ever seen.”

“But why? Why am I different?”

“I don’t know, and I think it is alright if you do not either, though I would love to hear all that you think you can remember of yourself, for it is saddening that only a few of the others can remember much at all.”, my hand was growing so cold.

She looked at my hand upon her shoulder, and after observing it with a tilted face, took it in her grasp, which was colder than what ice had the right to be, to remove it from herself or to feel its warmth, I did not know.

“I could not touch anything before, when I first awoke here. I look back on those first days as if I then nascent and unformed, dulled in heart and mind. All my memories of then are of cold, a cold which I can now feel to dull.”

I should have pulled apart my hand from her grasp, it was almost losing its feel, and reddening from the touch. But where that flesh chilled, my heart was warming, and that made her next words hurt much more, as her eyes widened, and she shook and turned.

“No…! I can feel it happening again! I want to stay and speak, but I can feel myself needing to disappear again, and enter that strange state of fully being what I am supposed to be. I am sorry, but can you know how to stop this?”, she had never seemed so desperate before, and I too could’ve wept for the inaction.

 She floated upwards on her position, until her hands were like a chain connecting us, with its other end at her lower body slowly vanishing into the mist around, darkening the room as it did.

“I will wait for you right here!”, I called, “Whenever you may appear again, be it today or tomorrow, or a morning even after, I will wait for you to appear. And each time you do we may continue as if you were never gone, or as if you were, if you want.”

I saw her open her mouth to speak again, but the mists retook her figure before she could, and her hand was final thing that they absorbed again, contact with it left my fingers one by one. I was alone in the library again, where she went whenever she disappeared, I did not, for her cold was never felt right after her disappearance. I hope she knew I wished her to appear just as much as she did, and perhaps she wished me to know the same as well.

She did not appear again that day, though I kept my word and waited in the library for the remainder of the day, thinking even to simply sleep there for the night. Though those plans did not last long as my mind unclouded and realized that spending the entirety of the following days in the library would be neither wise nor practical, especially if she appeared somewhere else, for which she could have little choice as far as I knew then.

 

\----------

She appeared the next day, and the day after that as well, both at dawn and at dusk, and when she appeared again the third in a row, I began to wonder just how I had could once bear to pass day by day without the expectance of her presence at one point or the other, though I understand how hopeless that my sound from outer spheres.

“Do you not venture outside this home?”, she asked me once, “I can feel my memories of the outside, yet can not clearly recollect them no matter how I try. Do you not feel strange, to only be surrounded by those like… us so different from you?”

“I go out quite often when I need to, though in this season there is very little out there to seek. Especially when for so long I have grown accustomed to the company I find here, I am aware in a sense of the fear that others are supposed to have of this place, but which I do not. But I do not think it remarkable, for though it was not always, this may have been my home was as long as I remember.”, I looked at her, “And I think the dead make for more interesting company, though that may be prejudice speaking from me.”

She chuckled softly, though it still slightly echoed as did all her speech, she paused then, “If this was not always your home, then from where did you come? How do you even take custodianship of a place such as this?”

I turned my head away, continuing a smile past its time, “I am afraid this position is not vacant for now, and hopefully will remain this way for some good few years.”

To my relief, she noticed my cue to turn away, “Looking at you I would think you have much more than just a few years left.”, she floated around and scrutinized me as she spoke, and then paused and looked down at her own form, “Probably, that is,”, she said with clouded eyes.

She stayed for longer than ever she had before, that time. And those few days were strange to me, for parts of them moved with fleeting speed which ached to leave me saddened as they passed, while other parts were slow, stale with the laboured chores of every day that has passed. The former rarely existed for me until mere weeks ago.

Another day, I entered the library at the twilight hour, when there was no source of light within save the moon which had not yet risen to shine through the windows. The misty atmosphere which always trailed her freshly emerged in the room, and I could feel her presence there, though strangely she did not appear.

I called to her twice then, once in the regular, soft speech which I often used and then secondly in concern when the first was not heeded. It grew strange to feel that strange sense of uncertainty again after so many days, and as a chill grew in me and I walked backwards slowly in the room, a hush of mist erupted behind me, and I gasped and grabbed hold of a chair to not fall.

But that fear subsided quickly as she appeared in front of me. Though she showed sadness and unfortunate regret at my reaction, I am sure she did it out of a mischief which maybe had come to her mind after a long time. As if she was getting back her form with time, though I had no way of knowing how she used to be.

And then, the day after that she appeared again, early in the morning when I had created my own little camp in a library chair with a blanket and a cup of something warm, parts of me were anxious that my commitment towards her may be leading to neglect towards the others of the manor, who were supposed to be just as important as her.

I stayed buried in the chair as we talked, while she floated and moved around me as she now often did. The mood was as warm as it could be, until she brought up again the matter which we had been forced to let go of when she first appeared in the library.

“It becomes harder every moment to not know what to call you. Can you truly not say anything of your name? Because that is such a strange thing to be restricted from in your own home.”

I suppressed a sigh, “I am sorry, but I really, really can’t. The circumstances which lead to it are quite… unfortunate, and I have tried many, many times to circumvent them, or to convince their cause to let go of it. But it has never worked, no matter how much it hurts me or anyone else.”

“I would tell you mine if you did.”

“What a curse that is then.”, I looked longingly at the floor, “But perhaps one of these days I could try again to set things right, for you. But please do not ask me about its nature in the meantime.”

She did not bring that up again, as I had wished, and she stayed there with me for some more time there, though unlike how we usually did, she did not talk as much before declaring that she could feel herself disappearing again.

I then left the library, and after all the blurry deeds of the day were done, I returned there, and retreated again right into the blanketed chair.

It was right there that I awoke the next morning, to a light, rhythmic humming which sounded so awfully familiar to me, such that my mind struggled for not piecing together from where it was remembered. But it seems that those clouded thoughts were only a waking daze, for realization soon arrived to me.

The structure of the library juts out from the main body of the manor, and is connected to the rest of it by a long hall which looks quite awkward from outside. From there, the Library looks almost like a strange tower, though the ceiling is not as high within. There is another room on top of the library, one that can only be entered now from a door and staircase on the library wall outside.

The humming should not have been this audible from up there, but still it always was heard, no matter where in the manor I was.

As I walked through the hall to get outside, I wondered if it was sheer coincidence that the grandmother had awoken and begun to hum right after that conversation last night. I suppose the manor had its own ways of progressing whatever it found interesting.

I was out of the manor now, and retracing the path I took in the hall outside. The stairs were at the opposite end from the hall, and that wall thus had no windows, a solid dark space in a well open room. It acted as an ominous reminder of the stairs, and to whom they lead.

The stairs creaked as I climbed them onto the pavilion above. My hand rested on the doorknob for long seconds until I could finally get myself to open the door. I was hesitant to go inside, often when I heard the humming, I would simply try my best to ignore it until it would finally fade away, however long that would take. But this time I guess I had reason to face her again. I opened the door, and headed inside.

The room looked much like my own bedchamber, without the dust and decay, that is. It had seldom been cleaned since the grandmother died, and though she still often resided within, she was no longer in a place to have it be maintained so. The room was quite dark, only little strands of light breaking through the curtains to make the layers of floating dust visible.

The noise of the humming stopped, and the grandmother’s half-resting figure on the large bed stayed still as I approached, eyes staring straight ahead.

I went over to the window by the bed and tried to shake the curtains open, they were heavy and worn, I tried to be careful not to tear them apart.

“Finally come again, have you, Dea?”, she said from behind me.

“You know that is not my name,”, I replied while fiddling with the curtains, “You need to let more light in here.”

*Dea*, as far as I knew, was the name of her first, and only, child. I never knew what happened to her, but knowing that I had never seen neither her, nor any signs of her existence, be it photographs or objects, I could only assume that she had died when she was quite young.

“It is difficult to sleep in the dark, Dea,”, she said, “Don’t pester your old woman for habits you gave her yourself.”, I wrested open the curtains finally, letting the morning sun seep through the window and illuminate the dust in the air and the furniture.

The grandmother’s figure was lit up as well, she was just as she would have appeared on normal days before I found her lifeless on that same bed, but slightly lighter, and if you squinted your eyes, you could almost see through her. I had never buried someone before then, and living among the dead had not prepared me for having to deal with one joining them.

“Close them a little!”, she said, irritated, “You have seen these eyes age, Dea, you know they cannot take so much.”

I had seen them age. I had over the years see her grow weaker and older, from being dependent on her every instruction and sweet word, to helping her walk and keeping things stable while she slept. But I had never managed to replicate her way with words with the dead.

“You know that is not my name,”, I repeated while holding the curtains in my grasp.

Her expression soured, “Nonsense!”, she hissed, “The footsteps on these planks have a lineage older than either of our imaginations! I won’t have you disgrace such history by such a rejection! Is it not I who lifted you up here?”

She had.

She had lifted me up from nothing, taking me in when she had been left with no one else. I was just a child then, but she became my world for me, and the manor my home. She would treat me nonetheless as her own, for all the years in which we were together, until her final few years. She turned different then, and her decreasing future led her to be absorbed in the past, and that drove her to a grief that was almost as poor to watch for me as it was for her.

Her family was indeed ancient to me, they had been custodians of the manor for as long as it had been in historic record, and likely for centuries before that as well. When the grandmother had no children after the death of *Dea*, there was fear that the line would come to an end. And the rest of the family made sure that they had someone to blame in her.

“Do you know what they would say to me?”, she asked in anger as she floated out of the bed, “*Look! Look! Here’s the failed heir! How does it feel to be our doom?*”, she tried her best to make that impression sound pompous.

 “*You had but one duty, fulfilled yet by all your predecessors, yet now you fail and end this blood, and the manor is likely to fall with it!*”, she continued repeating their words.

In her final years, she would often repeat those to me, that is when she stopped calling me by my own name and started favouring *Dea* instead. She was haunted by her long-gone family in those years. Always ashamed of herself of not continuing the bloodline, though I am sure she loved me still, the grief of more time gone than left overshadowed it, and she begged and pleaded with the very air around her for me to be someone who had died rather than be one who had lived.

“You have but *one* name that is worth uttering in this manor, that is worth the planks which you walk upon. And it does not matter if it is not the one that you wish.”, she snapped.

 “How many times had we had this conversation here?”, I pleaded, “I do not remember anything of what my life was like before you picked me up from nowhere, you yourself took care of that. And nothing you can do anymore will change your choices, why not move on? Like you helped so many to do?

Rage and sorrow were on her face, “Ah, *ah,*”, she breathed heavily, “That is what you want isn’t it? You just want to be rid of me, rid of the last one here of the right blood. I see what you want, *Dea.*”

I said my name then. Under my breath, yet in clear sounds so that she could hear.

I blinked, and she had disappeared. I regretted saying it, it only broke out of my mouth due to annoyance.

I scrambled in the chamber, and after I could not see her in any hidden corner, I walked quickly towards a corner from where I hoped I could get a view of the full room, with nothing to my back. I walked into a corner just like that, and then turned around to the rest of the room.

She was right there in front of me, such that I could have felt her breaths if she still breathed, and she towered over me, larger than she had ever been.

“You weren’t like this before!”, I reasoned, “Only in your final years were you consumed by this grief. I am sorry, I cannot go back and myself be born to you. But if I could then I would without hesitation.”

“Liar!”, she hissed, and her face and form twisted into strange proportions, my heart lurched, “And I haves seen you converse with that ghost! Seen you betraying the manor for the past!”, she was screaming now, and my ears ached as much as my heart as I closed my eyes.

“When I took you in, you agreed to it,” she continued her fire, “You forgot all that happened before, and were happy for it, for I lifted you up from nothing.”

My mind was a storm, both from the screaming and false pressure, and from remembering that what she said was true.

“But you don’t remember her anymore, do you? I don’t understand why she showed up here now, but you agreed to forget her, for your own good and wellbeing.”

*Why exactly did I feel connected with her?*

“Fine then!”, she screamed, and her face and figure worsened ever more, eyes distorted in horrifying forms, parts stretched to no reason, “Do whatever you wish! Ruin whatever you want! The past matters more than what is to come anyway! Forsake me all you want!”

I do not know how much more she spoke until I passed out.

I dreamt of the first day I remembered in the manor, when I was lost and confused, for I had been made to forget my entire life before the very moment I had come there. Who knows how much I had lost there, and though I understood she had done it, and why I had agreed, I think we both knew how sour it was.

I woke up in that same corner, to a slowly building chill. And that chill made me open my eyes sooner than I would have without it. The grandmother was no longer there, though she was, glowing in her beautiful, ethereal figure.

She spoke to me, but I did not hear what she said, my ears were weak from the morning. I do not know what she asked me, but from the ground I grabbed one of her hands, as painfully cold as it had been before.

“You asked me!”, I gasped, “I think I can answer now!”

“What?”, she softly exclaimed, “You look so pale, I could feel you troubled and was afraid, only now have you woken, are you alright?”

“My name!”, I exclaimed, “You wanted to know what it was! Ask me now, please!”

She seemed concerned, but she put it aside, “What is your name?”

“Seliya.”

Her face widened, and her eyes turned from side to side as something struck within her, “Does it still ring a bell in you, the name *Eva*?”

I could have sobbed then, and could still do so now, for it did not.

I will try to remember what I can, what I should. But I do not know if it can be done, and that is an eternal ache for me, knowing that someone remembers you more than you remember them, no knowing what you were to each other while the other does.

I do not think this can be undone, and each day is darker still, for I can feel the grandmother’s presence still in the manor, no longer bound to that room, but in strange corners does she make herself felt. I wish she would just move on.

Maybe it is time I help her do so, she taught me how to, after all.
