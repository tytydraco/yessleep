I am re posting my dad's ghost story here it's been suggested this is a better place for it. This is a real story told to me several times by my dad when he would reminisce about his past.  Iv retold it how I remember it  and as many times as he told it ita pretty close but without his story telling skills. The part describing my godparents is my thoughts not my dads.

My dad the asbestos and lead abatement contractor takes on a job to remove  black mold from some building in some town and he has to pass a " one stop light town, if you blink you miss it" 

Since this job does not require any special licenses or tests because there is no lead or asbestos my dad wants to help my godfather Dave Lopez make some money. Dave is a hard worker, fiercely intelligent, family man. Dave and my godmother Bea Lopez  are some of the.....  how do I explain this. 

 I don't want to say holy or godly or religious because those words feel hollow. They have this presence about them I can't explain they believe in God but are not Bible thumpers. They don't use God or religion in a condescending or I'm better then you because I'm closer to God then you. 

 My friends who have met them say the same thing they just feel love from them from the moment you see them.  Anyways my dad takes Dave and Dave's friend Mercedes.  (Mercedes says his mom comes from a long line of herbal women. Just a side note no relevance to story) the town they are driving to is 8 hours away and should take a few days an will make bank.

The drive to the town they are going to is uneventful. It's getting late  they are allmost at their destination but still on the outskirts of this 40k population town. They are starving so they see this diner. They haven't passed any place to eat for miles.  This area wasn't to populated maby once was a tiny  area growing just outside of this small town. They pull in to the parking and go inside

Once inside the waitress  tells them to have a seat she will be right with them.  Once seated they see a couple dancing to a juke box playing and a little old man sitting in a booth eating.  Dad said the only thing that sounded good on the menu was a " World famous cheesy meat loaf burger" it was a slice of meat loaf put on the grittle to sear it and kraft american cheese slice with mayo.  Said it was good. Then again they where hungry. 

They are waiting for their food, talking looking around  passing time in a time without cellphones. Mercedes says that something feels off about this place and he thinks they should leave now.  Dad says no he wants to eat and Dave agrees something is off but wants to eat they agree to leave asap once done eating. 

The food arrives and they eat. Mercedes scarfs down his food so they can leave,  Dave finishes second and goes to pay for everyone food so they can leave. Dave is starting to feel uncomfortable like Mercedes. On edge a shiver from nowhere down your spine. A feeling of being watched.  

Dave comes back to the table as my dad finishes his food. This sun baked dark brown  5 foot 5 Mexican man is pale.  About as  pale as my white ass that works grave yard in a dairy. Mercedes knows something is wrong.  Dave leans over and whispers  "look at the people dancing.  Their legs" 

My dad says when they first entered the diner he can't picture what they where wearing. It's like that one part of the memory is missing or was never there to begin with.  But the woman had a white dirty dress that went down to mid shin. And the man was wearing something like a filthy zoot suit with the pants rolled up to mid shin. 

Where the  leg should have been where deer like  front legs with hooves.  My dad noticed the old man in the corner staring at them. They hauled ass out of there.  When they finished the job they drove past that diner. It was boarded up. Like it's been closed down for decades.  A mile down the road was a small gas station. They stopped for gas chew and cigs and asked about the diner Up the road and the person working there said it closed down decades ago. Been boarded up ever since.
