To you, the honorable sir or madam, who has asked that I give an account of everything that has happened. To you who wonders why I will not fight for myself, and to those who wonder why I would so brutally and ruthlessly take the lives of two innocent members of society.

I know you need an explanation, however, I will only tell you what I care to. I apologize if this does not clear up everything, but I hope it clears up enough to bring this small community some peace. My only request is that this investigation ends. I am ready to plead guilty and accept the consequences of my actions.

It started a year ago when I was promoted to Youth Pastor. I had grown up in the church, joining as a young child in Sunday School, then becoming a part of the worship team and finally, leading the teenagers as a Youth Pastor. 

As soon as I got the job, I took it seriously. It was my responsibility to mold these young minds into the future of the church so that they too could one day take up responsibilities in the church.

In that time I had grown to respect them and they had grown to respect me. It was an effortless give and take, which I genuinely loved.

Teenagers between 13 and 17 are not easy to teach, but I found that once I showed them their rightful respect, they returned the favor. However, there was something dark invading our town and when I finally came face to face with it, I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
It started in the eyes of Adelaide, the daughter of two doctors who had recently moved to our small community.

She was a quiet girl and didn't get too close to anyone. She always followed the rules of the church and never spoke back. However, there was a fear in her; she hated anyone touching her and would flinch if anyone even came close to her.

With her head always tilted to one side, a blank expression and something hidden in her eyes, she attended a few meetings at church. All went fairly well, until I was called to her home one night.

Just days before, Adelaide had her fourteenth birthday at a youth meeting. Her parents brought cake and decorated the church. Her mom and dad stood beside her as they sang, and then she blew out her candles and made a wish. She remained quiet during all of this.
No change, she was still antisocial, she barely said a word, she didn't smile. When I spoke to her dad about it later that night, all he said was, "Sometimes you have to get into them to get through to them."

An odd choice of words, but after his first daughter was kidnapped and murdered years before, I guess he developed his own parenting style.

Then the outbursts started. Adelaide would start screaming, throwing things at walls and even try to attack her parents.

When I got to her house that night my heart went cold. There was an ungodly force here and I could sense it. I didn't even want to step inside, I just wanted to run, but we can never show fear when confronting a demon.
You may wonder why it's the first assumption that a child's outbursts are because she's possessed. Well, let me make it simple for you. If you are a part of a church community, everything is a demon's fault.

You got into a car crash, must have been a demon. You lost all your money gambling, the devil is attacking you. You woke up late and couldn't make it to work, must be Satan trying to get you to lose faith in God.

I didn't notice it earlier but self-awareness goes out the door when you let religion in. That's not to say that in the past year my faith in God has wavered in any way, but my faith in religion definitely has.

Her parents thought that if I prayed for them, things would get better, so I did. Adelaide smiled when she saw me, the first smile I had ever seen from her, and then she led me to her room.

We talked for a while. She told me about school, how she hadn't made any friends. She showed me her collectibles and then she showed me her art: dark drawings of shadow monsters. Through all of this I kept feeling the presence of an evil force, but I had to stay strong for the child. If I showed fear, the demon within her would know it's winning.

Adelaide and I prayed together. While I expected some form of a manifestation from the demon, I didn't see any. It wasn't like The Exorcist or so many other horror stories. She just remained quiet while I prayed.
As I said goodbye, I took one more look at her drawings. They were creepy, but back then I didn't realize that every one of them always showed two monsters.
The next day Adelaide drank a liter of water with a bottle of pills. Her mom found her and rushed her to the hospital, and she was in a coma for three weeks.
I felt like a complete failure. Our prayer should have protected her, but it didn't.

I returned to her home with the official pastor and while they talked I wandered into Adelaide's room. Maybe I could find something here to drive the demon out while she was in the hospital.

I was so heartbroken at the time that I didn't realize, even though Adelaide wasn't in the house, the same force I felt when I prayed for her was still there.
When Adelaide finally woke up I went to her bedside again and prayed. It was still the same result. No signs of any demon in her. That's when everything really clicked into place.

I left the girl's side and rushed back to her home. You see, when you live in a church community, self-awareness goes out the door and you start to take members of the church at their word.

I slammed the door open and came face to face with her parents and the force. I felt my entire body shiver and I was terrified. There was more than one demon, and they were the ones possessed.

I immediately got down on my knees and prayed, but her parents just smiled. The things inside them weren't scared.

Dear sir or madam, you may wonder what possessed me to do what I did next, but I have a duty of protection and while you may not take demon possession as a defense in court, this is my truth.

The demons inside Adelaide's parents chilled me to my bones. They told me they wouldn't leave, not because they couldn't, but because the humans being possessed loved them too much. I was ready to run, until the demons spoke again, telling me that the parents loved what they did to Adelaide in the middle of the night, when there's no one to defend her.

So now you have my testimony, the kitchen knife that I used as a weapon and the two dead bodies which can be used as proof against me. I only ask that this situation ends here. Adelaide should not have to testify; she has been hurt enough.

My final hope is that once the hosts are dead, the demons go back to hell.
