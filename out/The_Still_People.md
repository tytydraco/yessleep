My wife and I stared out of the kitchen window in confusion. 

“Should we call someone?” Erica asked. 

I squinted, willing my brain to make sense of the situation. Our elderly neighbour, Chester, had been standing in the exact same spot in his front garden for fifteen minutes now, seemingly frozen in place.

“No, I’m gonna go over there and see what the deal is. He’s probably just knackered himself out from gardening.”

I scurried out the front door, wrapping my arms around myself, breath visible in the crisp air. It was the last week before winter, several of our neighbours had been tending to the last of the fallen leaves before the frost hit, including Chester. As I approached him, I realised I was out of my depth. 

He stood with one foot slightly sunken into the earth, rake angled mid-drag through a blanket of leaves. His body was unnaturally still, caught in the middle of an ordinary motion that should have ended by now. One eyelid hovered halfway down in what would have been a blink, yet his eyes didn’t seem dry or red from lack of moisture. Even the skin on his face looked paused; a crease remained fixed where his brow had been furrowed in concentration. 

“Chester?”

No rise or fall to his chest, no tremor in his wrinkly fingers that gripped the rake. I placed a hand on his shoulder and repeated his name. As I touched him, a stillness washed over me. A calming, euphoric feeling that begged to stay. I withdrew my hand instantly and turned back to the house. Erica stood in the doorway, speaking urgently into the phone pressed to her ear. 

By the time the ambulance arrived, a small crowd had formed. Neighbours whispered amongst themselves as paramedics tried to rouse Chester. I had retreated back to the safety of my own home, unable to answer the bombardment of questions from Erica.

“A stroke, maybe?” She asked. 

“No. I don’t think so.”

“Then what? What could cause something like that?”

The police arrived half an hour later to cordon off the area. Word spreads fast in a small village like ours. With a modest population of barely 400, everyone knows everyone, save for a handful who keep to themselves.

Erica stayed glued to the window for the rest of the afternoon. I asked her to come sit down, to have a cup of tea, but she shrugged me off.

“I need to know,” she whispered, more to herself than to me.

By the time dinner rolled around she reluctantly accepted defeat. We sat in silence over cooling plates, Erica’s attention snagged again and again by the pulsing red and blue lights that bled through the curtains.

“I don’t think they can move him,” she said, eventually. 

I know my wife. I know what she wanted me to say. She didn’t need my approval, she just wanted it. 

“Go.” I said. “It’s okay.”

She kissed me on the cheek and hurried out the door. I got it, I really did. The overwhelming pull that had drawn her from the table. Curiosity is a natural part of being human, after all. We like to make sense of things, to see them clearly and find the logic in them. I felt the pull, too, coiled tight in my chest. But beneath that urge was something heavier, something that kept me pressed firmly in my chair. An instinct that warned me that some doors, once opened, can never be closed. That instinct was fear. 

Ten or fifteen minutes passed before Erica returned, pale and quiet, as if she’d left part of herself standing on the other side of the road. 

“Let’s go to bed,” she said. I didn’t argue. We carried out our nightly routines in silence before sharing a quiet kiss and turning out the lights. I lay in the dark for a while, staring at the ceiling. I wondered what Erica knew that I didn’t, and debated with myself if I ever wanted to know. Turns out I didn’t have a choice. 

The next morning, while making a coffee, I glanced out the window and saw that Chester was gone. Nothing remained but his footprints in the ground. The same pull I’d felt the night before stirred inside me again. I stared at the footprints, thoughts of the stillness flashing in my mind. The way my body had felt being near him, the way I knew right then and there that, if I’d allowed it to, the stillness could have taken over me. My fingers tightened, my jaw clenched, my ears filled with a dull, rising hum. Whatever had happened across the road was calling to me now. A hand on my shoulder startled me, bringing me back to reality, but the pull remained. I looked at my wife with sleep in her eyes, and took her by the hand. 

“I have to know,” I said. She nodded. 

According to Julie Willis, a paramedic and member of Erica’s book club, their first thought was that Chester was catatonic. His brain had stopped issuing normal movement commands, leaving his body in a fixed posture for an extended period of time. Then someone suggested locked-in syndrome, a condition caused by a brainstem injury where Chester’s mind is conscious but his body is immobile. Both good guesses, except for one thing.

Chester had no pulse. 

In fact, despite him being completely upright, there were no signs of life at all. But, perhaps more disturbingly, there were no signs of death, either. No smell. No discolouration. No deterioration. Still warm, still standing, still… Just still. They had no choice but to declare him dead. 

I sat myself down at the kitchen table before my legs buckled underneath me. Erica sat down too and bit her lip. 

“Honey,” she said. “You were there. Did you…”

“Did I what?” I snapped, banging my hands on the table causing Erica to flinch. I took a breath and apologised.

“Did I what?” I said again, calmer this time. 

“Did you… feel anything?” 

I looked at her. She knew. She’d felt it, too. Panic surged through my body. 

“It’s just, when I was over there with Julie, I could swear I could feel something. I know it sounds crazy, but it was almost like-“

“A stillness.”

“Yes.” she said. “A stillness.”

We tried to carry on with life as normal, the whole village did. We went to work, walked our dogs, nodded politely to one another in the street, pretending that Chester’s “death” was just another sad, ordinary thing.

Then the stillness returned, this time for Marjorie Hallows. She’d been fixing a Sunday lunch for her family. They were sat around the table, eagerly awaiting their food when Marjorie bent down to take the chicken out the oven, only she never got back up. Julie told Erica how she’ll never forget the guttural cries of Marjorie’s children as they watched their mother get taken away in a black ambulance. Little did they know that they would be next. I heard through the grapevine it came for them all at the exact same time. Marjorie’s funeral.

It happened more and more after that. It came for Peter Durbridge while he queued at the post office. It got a group of teens who were out on their bikes, and little Katie Fowler from down the road. She’d been on her way to school. It took dozens and dozens and still there was no logical explanation. 

The authorities tried to keep everything under wraps to avoid sparking panic in the community. They’d cart off the still people quickly and quietly, without the sirens and flashing lights. They insisted the situation was under control, that experts were already investigating the cause. 

Then the rules came. Keep your curtains closed at all times. Do not approach the still people. Do not touch the still people. Do not look directly at the still people. Do not give in to the stillness. Life as we knew it was nothing but a ghost. From what I could see online, this wasn’t happening anywhere else in the world. In fact, there was no mention of it even happening to us anywhere. It was as if the internet had been scrubbed of all traces of our village entirely. We didn’t exist.

Erica and I had discussed it many times as we lay in bed together, speaking in hushed voices. We knew the rules were arbitrary- they were only put in place to distract us from our inevitable fate.

“I don’t want you to go,” she sobbed as I held her tightly. “I don’t want to be alone. I can’t be without you.”

I shushed her and stroked her hair. I tried to comfort her with empty promises. We could fight this. We’d sensed the stillness once before. It had beckoned us into its warm embrace when it took Chester. We’d both resisted. Perhaps we could resist it again. We just needed to be strong. I’m not sure that Erica believed me, and I’m not sure I believed myself, either. 

Our usual nightly routine had been replaced with something more desperate, more urgent. We’d list the reasons we love each other. Recount our fondest memories. We’d cry, we’d laugh, we’d live like each night was our last.

“Just in case,” Erica would say. 

That brings me to tonight. I woke with a sharp, searing pain in my arm. Erica sat upright beside me, her hand locked around my bicep, long nails digging into my skin. Eyes wide with panic, she lent towards me in an awkward, stiffened way. 

“I feel it,” she whispered. 

She murmured something else, but before I could register her words, the fear on her face softened, melting into a strange, peaceful smile as she let the stillness wash through her. 

I waited for the pain to come, the heart wrenching ache of losing the woman I love. 

Yet, inexplicably, the longer I looked at her, the calmer I felt. I brushed my fingers through her hair, but it didn’t sway or fall back into place; it stayed exactly as it was. I leant in and kissed her warm, unresponsive lips. 

In the silence that followed, her last words looped endlessly in my mind. Soft and irresistible, carrying more weight than anything she’d ever said before:

“Come with me.”
