“Listen here you little shit. I WILL shoot you. I’ll shoot ya dead. Open up the register. RIGHT. FUCKING. NOW.” the man commanded, a little bit of spittle spewing from his mouth. He seemed like he meant business, but I easily picked up on the subtle undertone in his voice. The sweat glistening on his forehead, how his eyes darted nervously this way and that, the way his hand shook as he pointed the supposed pistol at my face. It was implied that there was a pistol concealed inside of the small paper bag at the end of his arm, clutched inside of a sweaty fist. Everything about the guy screamed nervous desperation.

“I can’t do that for you, chief. Boss would kill me” I replied calmly. “Do yourself a favor and put the gun down. Everybody goes home and we can just forget all about this. Scout’s honor.” I told him, cool as a cucumber.

“Boss? I’ll fuckin kill ya! Give me the damn money!” he screamed, ignoring all reason.

The gas station I work at doesn’t have a conventional alarm system. Our emergency button tucked away under the counter doesn’t summon the authorities. My boss, Carl, didn’t have much want or need for such a thing. He WAS the authority. Everybody in our small town knew it, just like they knew you don’t mess with Carl. You’d have to be a complete moron, or have a death wish to even attempt such a thing. Carl had a reputation, something all of us locals knew all too well. That’s what told me that this guy was from out of town, either that or just a fucking moron.

He got close and prodded me in the ribs hard with whatever was in the bag. It certainly felt like the barrel of a pistol. Here I had been thinking that he was definitely bluffing with an empty bag. Now, I figured it was probably a 50% chance he was bluffing. Despite all that though, I still wasn’t going to give this man a damn dime.

“I told you, sir. I can’t do that” I said, looking him dead in the eye. Maybe if I showed him a sliver of respect, he’d do the respectable thing. Maybe he’d decide to do the RIGHT thing, the SMART thing, and cut his losses.

“You think I’m fucking bluffing? You think this bag’s empty?” he asked, reading my mind. More spittle flung from his mouth with every other word.

I just shrugged, already giving up on trying to save this poor fool from a slow and painful death at the hands of Carl. “Yeah. I sure do. You’re bluffing” I said, resigned in trying to do my good deed for the day.

That was when he took a big step back, lowered the paperbag at my knee, and pulled the trigger. The end of the bag exploded outward and there was a loud pop. Two loud pops, actually, though only milliseconds apart. The first loud pop was the discharge of a gun, the second pop was my kneecap exploding as the small caliber bullet pierced my flesh and shattered bone. I guess he wasn’t bluffing afterall.

I dropped like a stone as my leg decided it could no longer hold my weight, and for good reason. The pain was immense, but bearable. If you want to work for Carl, even as just a cashier at his gas station, you’ve gotta be tough. It’s a prerequisite.

“What do you think now?” he screamed in conquest, standing over me and pointing the gun at my face. I could see the emergency button from my spot on the floor. It was between my assailant and I on the underside of the counter. I hadn’t pressed it yet because I was hoping it wouldn’t need to be done, and if I made a dash for it right this second he’d have a bullet in my brain before I could even get close. Nobody wants that kind of headache.

It was at that moment that Thomas came out of the walk-in cooler, the loud latching mechanism clicking shut and giving away his position. He had gone in to stock some beer about twenty minutes ago, and honestly I was hoping that he had seen the situation through the row of glass cooler doors and was going to sneak up and bash the robber’s skull in. He hadn’t. He hadn’t even heard the gunshot due to those goddamn earbuds he wears 24/7. He came sauntering out of the cooler, oblivious to the fact that we were currently being robbed. He looked up just in time to see the barrel of a gun protruding from a crumpled paper bag pointing between his eyes. There was another loud pop, and Thomas’ brains were sprayed along the row of cooler doors. The robber had gotten the jump on him, and he hadn’t stood a chance.

He turned back toward me, gun at my face again.

“You told me nobody else was here, dammit! That right there-” he pointed to Thomas laying in a growing pool of his own blood, “that shit is on you! His death was YOUR fault” he screamed. He was beyond flustered. The situation had just elevated from robbery and assault to murder.

His thumb moved inside the bag and there was a loud audible click, a hammer being pulled back on a gun. By the weak pop the gun had made when he fired it, a .22 caliber I’d imagine. A little Saturday night special revolver, they call ‘em.

“Now that you know I’m done fucking around, open the goddamn register” he said, seemingly calmed down a tad after taking a slow, deep breath.

“Do you even know what kind of shit you’re in, man?” I pleaded with his greater sensibilities. “Even IF Carl don’t get ya, that’s murder over there. Do you know what kind of time you’re looking at for murder? Nevermind the attempted robbery and attempted murder on me. That’s the rest of your life, which will be a real short one if Carl gets you” I stated, trying my hardest not to laugh at just how fucked this moron was.

The robber DID laugh, though. “Who the fuck is Carl and why should I give a shit? He’s probably got insurance, kid, and you’re really stupid enough to risk your life over a handful of dollars?”

It was my turn to laugh. “I was just wondering the same thing about you. There’s less than $300 in there, guaranteed. Hell, I know people who’d gladly PAY $300 so nobody would utter their name around Carl. That would be you, if you’re smart.”

He didn’t like that one bit. He decided to pistol whip me this time instead of shooting me. He already saw that the register was bolted to the counter, so he couldn’t just carry it with him. As for trying to open it himself, he’d already tried and given up. The strange rune-like symbols on the screen in the place of buttons were foreign to him, just as they were once foreign to me. Carl always preferred the equipment to be in his native language if possible. Some might call him nostalgic for a bygone era forgotten to history, I on the other hand, call him smart for it. Should some moron ever decide to rob the place, such as this moron, it would prove another hurdle for sure, just as it had today.

Dazed and seeing stars from the whack he’d given my head, he started yelling again. I’m not quite sure what he was yelling, only that if I didn’t want another blow to the face or possibly another bullet, I’d better comply. He must think I’m a damn fool. Whatever he could do to me, Carl would make it ten times worse if I let this guy just run off with a single cent of his money. It wasn’t even just about fearing Carl, it was about sending a message to Carl. A message that I was a tried and tested one of his guys. A message about my loyalty. Carl’s a powerful guy in these parts, one you’d rather have as a master than as an enemy if you’re smart.

Another blow to the temple sent me reeling. He was upset, becoming more desperate. He’d been trying to rob the place for damn near 10 minutes at this point. I’m sure that for him, what should have been a quick in and out job that was turning into a lengthy affair was frustrating. It had to be. That’s why I understood where he was coming from completely when he shot me again in my other knee. He finally figured out that mere threats don’t work on people, not where going against Carl is concerned. There’s a town FULL of people here that know that.

The pain of one shattered knee was intense, but bearable. Two shattered knees, however, was a little too much. I rolled about and moaned in agony as I clutched my wounds, as if applying pressure would lessen the pain. It didn’t, but the surge of endorphins seemed to help.

I had two chances left, as I saw it. The first was that damn button, several feet away that I probably wouldn’t reach quick enough. I’d have to crawl a good distance to hit it. My other chance was that Kris, my other coworker, would finish taking a shit sometime soon and come do what Thomas should have, had he had a shred of situational awareness. He’d been back there for quite a while now, and surely he’d heard something, like I don’t know, maybe the three gunshots? I didn’t need him to even take the guy out completely, just distract him long enough for me to crawl my cripple ass over and smash the button.

I was still rolling around in agony when I heard it. The sounds of a scuffle, a rack of chips being knocked over, the gun going off harmlessly into the ceiling. I looked up to see that the robber was no longer behind the counter with me. He was currently grappling with Thomas out on the floor, who had a firm grasp on the man's wrist as he attempted to wrestle the gun away from him. Thank god for Kris, and his long shit. While he obviously wasn’t quiet or quick enough to initially subdue the guy, he had at least taken him by surprise. I saw my chance to go for the emergency button, and I took it. The pain of trying to crawl on my belly with two shattered kneecaps was intense. My useless legs trying to push me forward were enough that I was fighting not to go into shock. Another gunshot rang out on the other side of the counter. Then another. As I inched myself closer and closer toward the button, I realized that things had suddenly gotten quiet. One of those shots had probably hit home, subduing one of the men, but which one? I kept crawling. The button was just barely out of reach when the robber came walking back around the counter again, the spray of blood from my coworker covering his shirt and his face. I don’t think Kris made it.

He leveled the gun at my face for the final time. His resolve turned to rage as he said “Last chance. Open the fucking register.”

There was no getting out of it now. I made like I was trying to reach up to press the correct sequence of keys, and as soon as I got close enough I smashed the hidden button. “Fuck you” I said, as the lights went out. The series of shutters on the front of the store slammed down with a procession of loud crashes. Together, we plunged into complete darkness, and the last thing I remember was the flash of a gun, as the robber's bullet hit me in the face.

~~~

When I woke up, the lights were back on. The shutters were still closed up tight, and as I stood the first thing I noticed was the coppery taste in my mouth. There was an ungodly amount of blood splattered everywhere. The walls, the ceiling, all over the product. It was a bloodbath. Carl had obviously taken his time with the poor bastard. 

I walked out onto the floor to see my boss standing over Thomas, his wrist bleeding and pouring a steady stream of dark crimson blood into the place where Thomas’ mouth should have been. His body spasmed, his limbs twisting and contorting with a sickening crunch as Carl’s blood did its supernatural work. I looked over to see Kris still lying on the floor just in time to see the bullet hole in his chest slowly closing, our boss’s blood staining his mouth and chin.

“You did good, kid” Carl said, not even looking over his shoulder at me. With his preternatural hearing, he tended to hear everything, and knew I was back up.

My knees itched where the newly grown skin had repaired, mending my flesh and bone. No matter how many times he healed me with his blood, I never got used to that odd feeling. It was an itch that never abated, no matter how much you scratched. It would lessen with time, though.

I glanced about, noticing pieces of the asshole scattered here and there.

“I’ll go get the shovels,” I said. He kept them in the utility room around back, right next to his coffin.
