 

This happened to me when I worked for door dash last year, and I am still shaken up from this. for context I’m 25 and I had just come out of a serious car accident where I almost died, (this is the other time I almost died.) I was driving around my town where I have lived for most of my life, it’s a fairly large town and it's people are generally really pleasant and nice. it was getting late, and I was about to call it a night when i got a notification from someone who wanted pizza. I was going to ignore it when I saw that the pay was an incredible $400.

even though it seemed too  
good to be true, I thought "fuck it, why not?" after I picked up the  
pizza, I looked at the address and realised how far away the address was. the  
drive there was uneventful and calm. I looked at the address again and truly  
began to realise how sketchy this whole thing was. the address was on this  
deserted old path with zero houses on it. i had a bad gut feeling about this  
whole thing and was beginning to seem a bit too good to be true. after a minute  
of more driving, I finally found the house at the end of the road. it seemed  
really old and unkept, but decided to

after  
setting aside my worries and mustering up the courage to walk up to the front  
door, i rung the bell to almost abandoned looking dilapidated building, kind of  
like the one out of monster house. after some time of waiting around the front  
door, a huge, obese man opened the door and said in a gruff voice "thanks  
man, moneys just in the basement." I nervously smiled back and reached my  
arm out and gave the man his pizza and said "do you mind getting the  
money? You know your house better than me!" i laughed awkwardly as the man  
seemed unphased my request. after just standing there, he said "ok, just  
follow me down so i can show you." 

i  
now had a pit the size of Mars in my stomach, but just decided to supress it  
and convince myself it was fine. I walked down the musty stairs and into the  
even worse smelling basement with the man. The man looked at me and motioned  
towards a small door in the corner. "your moneys in there." he said  
in a more serious tone. i swallowed the lump in my throat and pushed the door  
open. there in the room was a dentist type chair with wrist and ankle  
restraints on it. on a small table next to the chair was a variety of saws and  
knifes. my blood ran cold, and my instincts screamed at me to get the fuck out,  
so i sprinted past the man who tried to grab me on my way out but wasn't fast  
enough. Thank fuck the door was unlocked so that i could get out of the house.  
i practically launched myself into my car and booked it out of there.

When i got home, i called  
the police and reported him but i haven’t heard back from them. 

A  
year later, this still holds up to be the most horrific and disturbing thing  
that has happened in my life.
