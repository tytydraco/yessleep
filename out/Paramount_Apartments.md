First off, my name is Oliver Wyatt, and ever since I was a little kid, I always wanted to be a police officer. I got an intense amount of pride out of the idea of upholding the law and being someone of authority. As a kid, I would run around my front yard, waving a toy revolver at imaginary bad guys like I was dirty Harry. That might sound like a tremendous cliché, and it probably is, but it’s my life. So, after high school, I picked up a minimum wage job until I was old enough to sign up for the police academy. Looking back, I wish I had stayed at that greasy burger place 15 minutes from my house. 

After 22 weeks of (not exactly intensive) training, I graduated and finally achieved my dream. Dad couldn't have been more proud, and mom couldn’t have been more terrified. I tried to console her, but even I was sweating a little. I will admit that years of anticipation began to climax in fear. Fear that all my ambition would get me is bullets flying in my direction. Only to see *myself* on the evening news, all of my dreams blowing up in my face. I have to say though that the first few weeks were more boring than I expected, even disappointing to some degree. Driving around dealing with car accidents, domestic abuse calls, and busy bodies welding cell phones like weapons. None of it scratched the itch for justice that I was looking for. I wanted some action! Some shit that you might see on numerous daytime TV cop shows. I was so naive.  If I had any sense, I would have listened to *Carter*. 

Carter Halpert was my old partner. He was an older man with a massive white mustache that would have put Nietzsche to shame. He had straight gray hair that was cut just above his shoulder and piercing green eyes that seemed to suck the truth out of any situation. All that and his thick Georgia accent that made him feel like the grandfather everyone wanted in their youth. The man genuinely carried himself like an old west sheriff, something that became quite clear whenever he scolded me for my action-hungry attitude. Or, whenever he scolded anyone for that matter. He always told me that I should consider myself lucky that I hadn’t seen something truly messed up, and maybe never would if I played my cards right. I knew he was right, even back then I knew that he was right. But I always wanted more action. I wanted to feel like I was doing a service.   

At first, this seemed like it was finally going to be one of *those* calls. Someone apparently heard gunshots at an apartment complex out in the middle of nowhere. It was called Paramount Apartments. I knew the address was odd. It was way out of town, seemingly right next to the highway —a more fitting place for a chain hotel, not an apartment complex. 

“Who the fuck is living next to the highway in the middle of nowhere?” I asked Carter, perhaps a bit more vulgar than I should have been. I remember that Carter made a face, a piercing scowl that I hadn't seen on him before, as he stared off into the distance. I wanted to ask him what he was thinking, but before I could say anything, he grabbed his radio.

“10-4, squad car on route.” Just like that, Carter made a few quick adjustments, and we were off with our lights and sirens blaring. I was almost positive it was some old woman calling about a kid’s video game being too loud or something like that. But I had hoped it would be something interesting. We drove for about 12 minutes before we came to the next exit. I can’t remember any exit signs, but then GPS just made us peel off at an exit that seemed to come out of nowhere. The road turned off seemingly into the forest. It was a more drastic turn than I had expected. I braced myself like a child expecting a crash, but Carter took the turn like a seasoned stunt driver. He seemed to chuckle at my sudden panic, only to focus back on the road as we disappeared into the forest. The road came to a sudden fork in the road at a flashing red light. A stop light that illuminated two roads going in opposite directions.

“Recalculating.” The GPS sounded. I turned to look at the GPS, and I wanted to say something. I knew the GPS shouldn’t have needed to reboot. Did we make a wrong turn somewhere?  I really wanted to say something. But I knew Carter was determined at this point, so I shut myself up. He made the right, and I found myself holding my breath as the red light drifted off into the distance. Carter made a right and continued down the dark road, with the red light blinking behind us. 

I looked out my window to try and catch my bearings as we drove. I thought we were in some kind of forest. The intense black surrounding us could only be explained by a dense forest in the dark of midnight. But as I looked around, I realized we were driving through a town. I thought I could see buildings of some kind, but with no streetlights and no lights on, I couldn't be sure. I tried to focus on the shapes moving past my window. They didn't look like they had any depth to them, like the silhouettes of buildings where they should have been. My eyes were quickly drawn to a bright light that seemed to appear right in front of me. The road suddenly opened up into a well-lit parking lot— a medium size parking lot with way too many lights for the space. I felt like I was under fluorescent office lights when I was outdoors. It also didn't take me long to notice that the parking lot was completely surrounded by trees. I could have sworn that the parking lot was surrounded by other buildings, but they seemed to lose their shape when we got out of the car. A well-lit apartment building with at least 15 floors sat at one end of the parking lot. I was confused as to how the two of us hadn't seen the building sooner. Sitting behind the tacky water feature was a sign that read, “Paramount Apartments.”

“Be alert. Something is wrong.” I nodded as Carter parked the squad car. I was at least happy he was just as weirded out as me.  

 When Carter and I pulled up to the building, there was a man in his mid-40s standing out front. He was dressed in a pair of cargo shorts, a pink polo, white sneakers, and Oakley sunglasses worn backwards. The man looked like some HOA asshole going through a midlife crisis. It was like all my worst fears were confirmed at once. This was some middle-aged entitled prick complaining about children. Or something else he happened to mistake for gunshots. In any other situation, the man wouldn't have raised any suspicion – and he certainly didn't beyond my first thought. But now I find myself looking for anything, any clue that could have let me know what was going to happen next. 

“Oh, thank God,” he said with seemingly genuine concern on his face, “I heard gunshots in apartment 307. I think someone might be hurt!” Carter and I glanced at each other before looking at the man skeptically.

“Do you live here, sir?” Carter asked, realizing we still had no idea who this guy was or what his business was here.

“My name is Matt Miller, and I am the building manager. I have been getting complaints about this room for a few months now. They seem like good folks–a nice family. They pay the rent on time, but a couple times a week, I get a complaint about fighting and screaming coming from that room. Then when I go to check on them, it always seems to be over and everyone is all smiles. I've never actually heard the fighting for myself and no one ever seemed to be hurt. ” He explained as Carter raised his eyebrow. 

“Please take us to the apartment, sir,” Carter said calmly. The man nodded and led us inside. He pushed a few buttons on a keypad; the door system let out a loud screech, and he let us inside through a dirty and somewhat bare lobby. I couldn't help but think the room was  absurdly small, with no chairs for anyone to sit in. One side of the room had an elevator, the other had an open door leading to a flight of stairs. The man calling himself Matt then ushered us into the elevator and pressed the button for the third floor. I then turned to him.

“But why have you never called the authorities to deal with it before?” I asked, wondering why I had never heard of this building before or even heard the address on a debriefing.

“Like I said, I have never actually heard the fighting myself or seen anyone hurt. I don’t go into people's private lives.” The incompetence of this manager started to get on my nerves. The elevator opened, revealing a long, cramped hallway with sickly green carpeting and dozens of doors on both sides. The green of the carpet struck me: it was the same green as dirty pond water and the smell wasn't too far off. I had to stop myself from gagging and Carter was right behind me in that regard. Many of the lights were flickering or were out altogether. The lights bathed the whole hallway in a piercing light, the color of movie theater popcorn butter. I couldn't help but notice dead insects inside the bulbs, but then I noticed some were alive. There were so many. The live ones seemed to be crawling over each other–and the dead ones–in a desperate attempt to get out. It was then that I noticed the bugs crawling on the wall. Every dark point on the wall seemed to move the more I looked at them. From that point on, I did my best to stay in the middle of the cramped hallway. The whole place seemed like it was falling apart, and I wanted nothing more than to get out of there. As the man calling himself Matt led the two of us down the hallway, a question popped into my head.  

“Does that mean you heard the gunshot?” I asked, Matt turned and looked at me. 

“The entire building heard it! I got so many complaints from scared parents over the apartment group chat that I just told everyone to stay in their rooms, and I would call the police.” Nothing about this situation was making sense. This building didn't feel like the kind of place where anyone would come to build a family. We finally made it to apartment 307. Carter looked at Matt.

“Stand back, sir. We don't know what might have happened.” Matt took a couple of steps back into the shadows of the hallway. Carter took point and knocked on the door. 

“Sir or Madam, this is the police. Could you please open the door?” We waited for a few moments before Carter knocked on the door again. Considerably harder this time. 

“Sir or Madam, we got a call about gunshots. Please open the door. We need to know if anyone is hurt.” 

This time, we were given an answer in the form of a piercing female scream that made my ears ring. The voice didn't say anything understandable, but it was all Carter needed to start kicking the door in. 

“That sounds like the mother! You need to do something!!” Matt yelled, letting his panic slip and turning my attention away from Carter and the door.  

“We will sir! Now get back!” He backed up considerably. I heard Carter break through the door right behind me. The door broke much faster than I expected, even for a crumbling apartment building like this. I didn't even hear a door chain break.

“What the fuck?” Carter said from inside the apartment. He had rushed in without me while I was dealing with Matt's emotional outburst. 

“Stay here, sir!” I demanded before rushing in after Carter. I ran in with my gun drawn to see what Carter was confused about. As I ran in, I could have sworn I saw Matt smiling. I know I only saw it for a second, but his smile looked wrong… like something you might see on a crudely-made puppet. Like a marionette infested with termites and forgotten about. When I found Carter, he was standing in the middle of the living room looking dumbfounded. I’ll admit, it took me a second to see what he saw. The apartment was seemingly a normal space with a living room and kitchen area, a bathroom, and a bedroom. However, as I looked more closely, I noticed it. The apartment was empty. I mean, it had furniture and everything you'd find in any normal apartment, but any evidence that a family had lived there for any amount of time was absent. No shoes by the front door, no dishes in the sink, and every framed photo in the place was a stock image of a family. But never the same family. Even the smell of the place seemed neutral. Not one smell stood out as a dominant smell in the room. I couldn't smell the carpet, in a place like this I had expected to smell the carpet. Everything in the room just seemed way too clean and neat. Carter directed me towards the bedroom. Clearly, the scream we heard must have been coming from there. We stood on either side of the door, and I spoke first. 

“Miss, are you hurt?” I wasn't sure what, but something about this felt truly wrong. When we didn't get an answer, Carter opened the unlocked door. A part of me was expecting a woman tied to the bed by her abusive husband while said husband held a gun to her head, as their children sat in the corner terrified. I wish to god that’s what I saw. I certainly wasn't expecting  more of what we found in the living room. What stood in front of us was a completely immaculate bedroom. Carter practically ran to the closet and threw it open, checked the closet only to find it completely empty, he then frantically checked the dresser. Nothing, not even a pair of socks. I was still standing in the doorway when Carter brushed past me and moved towards the kitchen. 

“Go find that manager guy,” He pointed at the door before rummaging through the shelves and cupboards of the kitchen. “Nothing, absolutely nothing.” I heard him mutter under his breath as I made my way out of the apartment. 

“Sir, are you sure this is the right roo-” I was about to finish my sentence when I stepped out into the hallway and saw no one. I thought that Matt was standing right outside, but now he was nowhere to be seen. “Sir! We need to ask you a few questions!” I yelled down the long hallway thinking he was just out of my sight, hiding at one of the dark ends of the hallway. A hall that was now too dark for me to see the end with the naked eye. I yelled again, but I got no response. I even took out my flashlight and aimed it down both ends of the hallway. I quietly wondered if the hallway had always been this dark. Sure, it was dingy before, but now… now I couldn’t see to the end of the hall without my flashlight. There was just nothing there. I went back in to tell Carter, and I found him with his hands on his hips, looking both confused and royally pissed off. 

“Well, where is he!?” Carter yelled, clearly exasperated. I didn't know what to tell him, so I just told him the truth.

“He’s gone.” 

Carter looked at me as if I grew two heads. 

“What do you mean he’s gone?” he questioned, walking past me, presumably to check the hallway himself, only to return a few moments later. He came back just as quickly, “did you tell him he could leave?”I shook my head.

“Well, there is nobody here. There isn't even any evidence of someone being here. So, either that guy took us to the wrong room, or he’s playing us both for fools.” 

“But we both heard that scream.” I confirmed, mostly for myself. A sudden spark of realization formed in Carter’s eye. 

“THE BATHROOM!” he cursed our collective stupidity. We rushed towards the bathroom and I swung open the door. The first thing that hit us was the smell. The sudden stench of rot, decay, and death traveled at top speed through the apartment assaulting our nostrils. It was so pungent I wondered how neither of us smelled this mess sooner. After the two of us finished gagging, we collected ourselves as best we could. I reached into the room, looking for a light switch, and was immediately met with a malformed, spongy substance that I immediately recoiled from. When I looked at my hand, a black soapy liquid had covered my fingers where I touched the wall. Carter and I looked at my hand in disbelief, before Carter took out his flashlight and pointed it into the bathroom. Every surface in that room was covered in a thick black substance– a black substance that seemed to pulse, weave, twitch, like the muscles of a rotting animal fighting to stay alive. At first glance I thought it must have been mold, but it didn't seem to cover the walls, it looked like it was one with the walls. Almost like it was pushing itself out from the walls. Like it was always just below the surface, distorting the walls and floors into new shapes before pushing free. Like giant termite mounds made out of black, moldy muscle. My training would tell me to investigate further; however, neither of us needed to step foot in the room, because in plain view was the body of an older woman decaying in the bathtub. 

“We need to call someone.” I had never seen a dead body in person before, and despite the fact I knew who to call, the name escaped me in my panic. Carter pulled out his radio and immediately spoke into it. I can’t recall what he said, I was too busy staring at the woman in the bathtub. I am no coroner, but I had to guess she had been there for multiple years, if not more. Her skin was gray and much of it seemed to have dissolved in the water. Most of her body seemed incredibly bloated. Her eyes were a sickly yellow, but I could tell they had once been a piercing blue. But that wasn't what threw me, what threw me was the black substance pushing into her body like tree roots. Whatever it was had clearly overtaken every part of her body, working its way into her like a parasite. It was when I saw the unidentifiable insects with wings emerge from her skin that I knew I couldn’t take it anymore. So I slammed the bathroom door and ran to the sink to let loose my lunch. I tried to turn on the sink, but I stood in disbelief as no water came. 

“What the fuck is this place?” I asked my reflection in the kitchen sink faucet. 

“No one is answering my radio. Try yours.” Carter said, panic rising in his voice. That was yet another first for the evening. I took out my radio and called out the codes for a dead body and that we needed backup. But all we heard was radio static. We tried a few more times with the same result before I pulled out my cell and simply called 911. 

“911, what’s your emergency?” A female voice came over the speaker. I was relieved, we were finally going to get some help. 

“This is Officer Wyatt and Officer Halpert. We need backup at Paramount Apartments immediately. There is a dead body on the scene.” The line was silent for a good few seconds before the woman spoke again. 

“I'm sorry, can you not handle this Officer Wyatt?” The woman spoke in a blunt and mocking tone. I could have sworn I misheard her, so I turned up my volume and put her on speaker. 

“Excuse me? Could you repeat that?” I asked. 

“You're going to be a great story for mommy on the evening news, aren't you Oliver?” The voice was sickly sweet, like an abusive teacher trying to shame a crying child into stop crying. But with a hint of malice that I swear I have never heard in another human voice, and with a gleeful giggle that made my skin crawl. 

What came from the phone next can only be described as the sound of thousands of insects buzzing. A hive of vermin with far too many wings. It got to the point where Carter and I fell to the ground clutching our ears in pain. The sound was piercing and became deafening, like microphone feedback in a high school gym. It was far too loud a sound to be made by my phone. But as soon as the buzzing came, it went. We both sat up staring at the phone in disbelief. The call was still going and I jumped to hang up, managing to do so before the voice spoke again.  I checked my phone, desperate to call anyone that might be able to help us, but my touchscreen seemed unresponsive. It started to call 911 once more before Carter took it out of my hand and smashed it against the wall. He pulled me up and forced me to look him in the eye. 

“Oliver, listen. No one is coming. We are on our own here. We will deal with her later–what the hell!” He pointed towards the bathroom. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The mold was spreading from underneath the bathroom into the living room and toward the two of us. Creeping across the floor like vines in the jungle, while the buzz of hundreds of thousands of bugs roared behind the door. 

The two of us ran out of the room and down the hallway towards the way we thought the elevator was. As we ran, it felt like the building was decaying around us. The black substance seemed to bubble out of the floor like magma from a volcano, making the green carpet spongy and soggy, pushing itself out as if it was always just underneath the surface. The walls seemed to be growing thick, black tendrils that desperately reached out to us. But when we reached the end of the hallway, we found nothing but a cement wall. Carter and I stood in disbelief. I knew we came from this direction, but the wall stood there as plain as day.

“This is the direction that guy brought us, right?!” Carter asked as he touched the wall, which twitched at his touch. He pulled back quickly and shook it as if he had touched something putrid.

“I know it is.” I turned and looked in disbelief as I saw the black substance was easily cornering us like an apex predator, covering every surface of the hallway, and making sure there was no surface we could touch. But it was when I saw the rotting feminine figure exit the apartment, walking through the doorway and turning towards us like a marionette on a string, that I finally let myself scream. The only thing I could think to do was start knocking on all the other apartments. The doors that weren't covered with the moldy substance anyway.

Surely, someone must actually live here. I tried every door I could, but my knocking only caused the doors to twitch with seeming delight. Carter apparently got tired of my knocking and proceeded to kick one of the doors down. To our surprise, it seemed to be in the same condition as the other apartment, except this one had people in it. A small elderly couple was sitting on the couch when we entered the room. The old man quickly got up to meet us.

“Is there some kind of problem, officers?” he said in a concerned tone. 

“Is there a fire escape?” Carter asked, with a kind of panic I didn't think I would ever hear in his voice.

The old woman pointed towards the window while standing, “There is one over here. Why? Is there an emergency we should know about?” She asked in a concerned yet sweet tone. Carter and I looked at each other before I ran back to the hallway to check the mold. I was horrified to see the mold had completely consumed everything in the hallway. I turned my head violently to the left, only to come face-to-face with the decomposing woman from the bathtub. However, she wasn't really looking at me, her eyes were still very, very dead. They seemed to gaze in opposite directions, neither of which were at me. It was then that I saw one of them clearly for the first time. 

One of the woman's eyes twitched, before popping out entirely. The other eye quickly followed the first eye, as if she was a form of a hive. It looked like a moth and a spider had a baby. A malformed, twitchy thing that eyed me down with seemingly hundreds of eyes. But those eyes– I don’t know how I know, but I know there was intelligence behind those eyes. The intelligence of a being who had just caught its prey, like it had caught so many others. You know how you can tell when something is smiling with its eyes? This thing was smiling at me. Then, another came from her skin, like one of those exotic toads giving birth–and another, and another. I don’t know how I know, but they were all smiling at me. Then, I heard them. I heard them speak in the voice of…my mom, in a place in my mind that was just behind my eyes, “Officer Oliver Wyatt, why not doctor? Or lawyer” I ran back inside the apartment and closed the door behind me. I hadn't realized it, but I was crying. Crying like a little boy whose mom didn’t like his Mother's Day present. Then I realized, I heard that in my mothers voice. Why had I heard that in my mothers voice? I had never heard her say those words before, but at that moment, I could have sworn she had. Something she had said to my father while I was just out of earshot 

“Just stay in your room and don’t leave. Officer Wyatt and I will go and get help.” I looked over to see Carter struggling to get the window open–I ran to join him, and as I did, I lost track of the old couple. Carter and I pulled at the window for a bit, but even though it was clearly unlocked, it refused to move. 

“Perhaps you too will stay for a cup of coffee and some cake?” I turned to politely decline, but when I saw the old couple, I screamed. They had seemingly opened the door and let in the mold. The decaying woman just stood in the hall, as more of those bugs escaped her torso and seemingly any orifice they could. The old woman had thick black tendrils coming from her mouth and her eyes. The tendrils connected to the tray of coffee and cake which seemed to turn into pulsating masses before my eyes. The old man similarly had black tendrils going from his mouth and eyes to completely covering his body. I went back to pulling at the window while Carter pulled his gun on the old couple as they approached us.

“Get back!!” He ordered. Apparently, they didn't listen as he let out four shots. I turned back to see the old couple convulsing on the floor in what looked like pain. However, the writhing on the floor stopped when the couple’s abdomen’s began to expand, blowing up like balloons.

 They both began to laugh and choke in unison. It was then we saw it–the couple's abdomen began to break open, revealing thousands of those insects. Each one fighting to escape its host and adding on to the immense amount of insects growing from the decaying woman. The size was one thing, but the feeling of a crowd grinning at me left me frozen as if on a stage. Facing millions, if not billions, of grinning eyes. 

 “GET THAT WINDOW OPEN NOW!”  Carter screamed, breaking me from my trance. I picked up a chair and threw it at the window. It shattered immediately, and I climbed through. I turned back to help Carter get through, but when I did, I saw the insects had reached him. They swarmed him and seemed to fight their way into every orifice they could manage to fit their bodies into. I couldn't bear to watch whatever happened next as I ran down the rusty fire escape at top speed hearing his choking cries floors above me. I was so happy to see my squad car exactly where we had parked it. I jumped in and raced back to the station. 

I immediately told them an edited version of what happened so I wouldn't look as crazy as I felt. Then, a group of other officers and I went back to the address. But this time, it was gone. Not a vacant lot mind you, but a service center within McDonald's and a Starbucks. Turns out there never was a call from that address. At least not one that was recorded or one that anyone could remember. There was no sign of Paramount Apartments and no sign of Carter. To be honest, I can't even remember what Matt looked like. Not beyond the Oakley sunglasses and the pink polo. I wasn't able to give them an eye color, hair color, or anything besides the fact that he was a man in his mid-40s. And the old couple, I can't remember a single thing about what they looked like, but I can remember everything about how they died. I didn't know what to tell Carter's wife and kids. Hell, I didn't know what to tell anyone. Internal affairs had a field day with this, and after all of the psychological exams and interviews, I was canned. No one wanted to be the next Carter after that anyway. 

So, now it is up to me to find a new lifelong dream. But as cruel as it might sound I was happy trying to forget my time as an officer and be done with it. I was happy trying to forget about Carter. So why am I writing this? Because despite being done with whatever that was, I don’t think it’s done with me. I am writing this because a few hours ago, I got a knock on the door. When I went to check, I found a brochure lying on the ground. I picked it up only to see it was a brochure for Paramount Apartments. 

“Easy living” It said in big balloon lettering on the front page, along with a picture of the pristine apartment I had seen that day. Inside that apartment, waving toward me and wearing the biggest cartoon smile I’ve ever seen, was Carter, with thick black tendrils visible on his teeth and a dead puppet-like look in his eyes.
