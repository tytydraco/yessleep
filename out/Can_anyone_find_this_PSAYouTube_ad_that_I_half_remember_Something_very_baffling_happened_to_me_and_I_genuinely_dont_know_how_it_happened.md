So it was a normal Sunday around 10 PM when I was chilling in my house, and I was sitting by my desk, watching videos on my phone

The browser I use has a built-in ad-blocker, but somehow YouTube updated and found a way to still place ads and REMOVE THE SKIP BUTTON, very *fucking* infuriating

So I was just watching videos on my phone and another goddamn unskippable ad starts playing 

It was some local PSA/charity? about wildlife preservation/anti-deforestation or something and it had a woman talking

She started talking about trying to preserve a large forest near my town, I was getting annoyed at her for wasting 2 minutes of my time

I know I should feel bad since this is a charity and not a commercial but honestly? I *really* don't care, it's not like I would donate or anything

I start dozing off, sometimes looking around my room for something interesting to look at instead, just waiting for the PSA to end...

But then when I "dozed back in", I realize that my phone wasn't in my hand anymore, and I wasn't in my room, or my home...

I kid you not, I genuinely am not joking, but I somehow magically appeared in the same forest she was talking about

*"What the?" "How did I-"*

I was so baffled and confused, I genuinely didn't know how I got here

I was still sitting in my chair, somehow the chair also got here

When I realized where I was I got so confused, how the hell did I get here? Was I kidnapped or something?

And then I started panicking, I'm trapped alone in some random forest in the middle of the night without my phone and I have no idea how I got here

I stand up and start looking and wandering around (keeping a close distace to my chair not to get lost) and trying to find a way to go back home, hoping that I can somehow get out, I start panicking that I might have to sleep in the forest and wait to be recused

Luckily I find a road in the distance and start walking to it, When I got ti the road I realized I recognized it and that I was not too far from my hometown

I start walking along the road, hoping that I don't get kidnapped by human traffickers or whatever my mom says when I go outside

I started wondering how the hell I got here, *how the fuck did I end up in a forest with absolutely no memory of how I got there?*

*Did I get drugged? Was I kidnapped? Was it because of that PSA?*

After some walking I finally saw my house again, and when I went back inside I saw my mom waiting and she started scolding me for going out at night, alone, without her permission when there was school tomorrow

I have no idea what to say to her, I tried explaining that I had no idea how I got to the forest

Obviously she doesn't believe that I "magically teleported" to some random forest from a goddamn YouTube ad

I ask her if she saw me go walk the door or disappear from my room or *ANYTHING* that could give me answers

She rebuked me and told me that I could have gone out the window, and that I was grounded for a week

*Great, fuck me*

I go back to my room, and I start obsessively writing down every detail I can remember of what happened in my notes app, trying to wonder *how the hell that happened???*

I realized that my chair was still gone, I left it in the forest and since I'm grounded I can't go back to the forest to check if it's still there

I tried looking for the PSA, I tried looking through my search history but obviously they don't store what *ads were playing*

I tried searching stuff online like "Philippine Wildlife PSA" or "Black Haired Woman Philippine Forest Ad" and obviously I got nothing

I even tried searching on YouTube, and got 4 results semi-related to what I searched and the rest were unrelated garbage cuz YouTube's *fucking search engine is a piece of shit*

I have no idea how to find the PSA/ad again, but here's some details I remember if you wanna help me find it again:

It was about a forest in the Philippines

It was a black haired woman talking

I remember her saying "in a world dominated by human activity" or something like that

It was for a charity that was called something like: The Philippine Wildlife Front or something

That's genuinely all I can remember as I only was half-paying attention

Please help me find this PSA, I genuinely don't know what happened
