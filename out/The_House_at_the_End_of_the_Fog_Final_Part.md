The corridor stretched on, its fog pulsing faintly like the breath of some giant beast. Each door loomed crookedly in the walls, wood damp, knobs blackened with rot. My boots sank into the floor as though it were made of wet clay.

The silence was unbearable.

Every step echoed too loud. Too alone.

I reached for one of the knobs, desperate to try anything. My fingers brushed it—warm, slick—and the whispers hissed violently in my head:

“Don’t open. Don’t open.”

I pulled back, chest heaving. My hands shook so badly the lighter nearly slipped from my grip. The flame quivered, its tiny light painting the fog in trembling orange.

Then the corridor shifted.

I swear it breathed. The walls swelled, contracted, exhaling a blast of damp air that reeked of mildew and copper. The doors shuddered, rattling on their hinges.

Behind me, the one I’d entered through was gone. Seamless wall now. No way back.

My only option was forward.

I walked.

One door. Ten doors. A hundred. The fog blurred them all together. I scraped marks into each one I passed with my broken nails, but when I looked back—the marks were already gone.

Panic rose like bile. My throat ached from swallowing it down.

Then I saw something ahead.

Light.

Faint. Flickering. Like headlights cutting through mist.

My chest clenched with hope so sharp it hurt. I ran. My boots slapped the floor, fog swirling around my knees. The light grew stronger, brighter—familiar.

It was my car.

Sitting in the middle of the corridor. Headlights blazing, engine idling.

I froze. My body screamed to run to it, but my stomach twisted with dread. It was too perfect. Too easy.

Still… what choice did I have?

I stumbled toward it, every step a war. My reflection warped in the windshield, eyes wide, mouth slack with fear. I yanked the driver’s door open, half expecting nothing inside.

But the keys dangled from the ignition.

And the smell hit me.

Not fog. Not rot.

Blood.

I glanced at the passenger seat.

There was someone sitting there.

Slumped. Head turned away. Their hair clung wetly to their cheeks, dripping down their shirt. Their hands were folded neatly in their lap.

I whispered, “Emily?”

The figure turned.

It was me.

My own face stared back, swollen and pale, eyes gone cloudy. Blood bubbled from my lips as they stretched into a grin.

“Drive,” it rasped.

I staggered back, choking on bile, but the car’s engine roared louder. The tires screamed against the floor though it didn’t move. Smoke poured from the exhaust, thick and black, swallowing the corridor whole.

The voices in the walls shrieked, tearing at my ears:

“There is no road.”

“There is no out.”

“You belong.”

I ran.

Blind, coughing, tears streaming. The smoke filled my lungs, clawing deep, but I kept running until my legs gave out. I collapsed to my knees, retching into the fog.

When I looked up—

The house was there.

Its porch light burning. Its door wide open.
Waiting.

The corridor was gone. The car was gone.

I was right back where I started.

The whispers fell silent.

And for the first time, I heard laughter again. Not distant. Not muffled.

Behind me.

So close I felt its breath on my neck.

The laughter prickled across my skin, hot and wet, as though it seeped from inside my pores. I didn’t dare turn around. My body locked, every muscle trembling, but my mind screamed: move.

I bolted for the porch. The boards welcomed me with a groan, the railing slimy under my grip. The door yawned wide, breathing heat and rot into the night.

I stumbled inside.

The house closed around me like a coffin lid.

The whispers were gone. The laughter was gone.

Only silence remained, thick and unnatural, like sound itself had been drained. My lighter had long since died, but I didn’t need it anymore—the walls glowed faintly, sickly yellow, as though the house itself was lit from within.

I followed the glow down the hall.

Each step sank deeper into the floor, until it felt like walking through flesh. The wallpaper pulsed, veins snaking beneath its surface. I gagged but pressed on, every instinct screaming that the end was coming.

The hallway opened into a vast room that couldn’t have fit inside the house. Ceilings arched high, beams sagging like broken ribs. The walls curved inward, alive, breathing. And at the center sat a table.

The same table I’d seen before.

But now it stretched into infinity, vanishing into darkness, heaped with meat and bone, plates stacked high with gristle slick with blood. Flies swarmed in thick clouds, their buzzing deafening.

Every chair was filled.

The guests wore faces. Some half-rotted. Some stitched. Some torn away to reveal what lay beneath.

And every face was familiar.

Mine.

Dozens of me sat along that endless table. Smiling. Chewing. Some wept as they ate. Some giggled, teeth cracking bone. Some stared blankly, their eyes hollow.

At the head of the table sat the thing with too many teeth. Its grin split wider, blood dripping in ropes down its chin.

“Daniel,” it said. “You came home.”

The others echoed it, their voices layering over each other until the sound shook my bones.

“Home. Home. Home.”

I screamed. The sound tore out of me raw, but the house swallowed it. My double—the dead one I’d seen in the car—rose from a chair, its eyes white, its grin splitting open until its skull cracked. It reached out to me, bloody fingers spreading.

I stumbled back toward the door—but there was no door. Only wall. Seamless.

The whispers surged back, louder than ever, shrieking over the cacophony:

“You can’t leave.”

“No one leaves.”

“The fog keeps what it takes.”

The house quivered, beams rattling, walls pulsing harder, faster, as though its heart beat beneath the floor. The table trembled, dishes clattering, meat sliding off platters in wet slaps.

The thing at the head rose.

It was taller now. Its teeth scraped the floor as it stood. Its grin split all the way to its ears, jaw unhinging, throat yawning wide. Inside, rows upon rows of teeth gleamed wet, waiting.

And in the silence before it spoke, I knew the truth.

The house wasn’t a place.

It was a mouth.

The fog wasn’t weather.

It was breath.

And I hadn’t wandered into it by accident.

I’d been swallowed.

The thing’s voice thundered, shaking the walls, the ceiling, my very bones:

“EAT.”

The chairs scraped back. Every version of me rose. Their footsteps thundered toward me, teeth clicking, mouths drooling.

I turned, clawing at the wall, nails splitting, blood smearing as I searched for escape. The whispers wept now, broken and hollow:

“Too late. Too late.”

Hands seized me. My own hands. Dozens of them. Clawing, dragging. My face stared back from every angle, lips split in bloody smiles.

The last thing I saw was the thing’s mouth opening wide, impossibly wide, its darkness swallowing every flicker of light.

And then—Fog.
