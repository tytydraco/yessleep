Before we moved in, I couldn't wait to enjoy my new upstairs bedroom - especially coming from a small mobile home. The 4 bedroom house was a huge upgrade.


Plus, my new bedroom had a spacious walk-in closet... The closet was the size of a large bathroom or small hallway but the house itself had an A-frame. So when you walked into the closet, after about 6 feet, there was a little nook/crawlspace, and as you walked back out, to the right was an inclined platform that led straight up to a small door into the attic. 


When my mom told me about the closet and crawlspace, I was really excited to have such a big closet to myself. As 6-year olds do, I fantasized about making a secret hideout, stuffed animal landslides, and sliding down the incline like I was in a playground.


Those fantasies came to a halt when I stood in front of the closet for the first time. Something felt off about that closet. Something felt off about that whole house. It always felt like someone was watching me, like I was never alone. An overwhelming sense of discomfort coursed through my veins, and when I walked into the house, the air felt thick and suffocating. It just felt wrong. it felt unsafe. 


If I needed to get something from the closet, I would open the door with my head turned in the opposite direction and I’d turn the light on by pulling on the rusted chain with my eyes tightly shut. I remember the sound of the chain grinding against the light fixture before the light switched on. 


I was afraid of my closet during the day - and I NEVER went into my closet at night. And I never forgot to lock the closet door before going to bed. When you touched the doorknob, it made kind of a rattling sound like something was loose inside, or the doorknob itself was just worn down. 


But I want to stop for a second on this train of thought, because what is the purpose of having a lock on a closet door? Seriously, why would someone install a lock on a closet door? To keep people from going in? No. That can’t be right because it was a push lock. So if you turn the knob from the outside, it unlocks the door. You don’t need a special key. It just didn't make sense. But I didn't think twice about the reason for the lock at the time. I just had a gut feeling that the door should remain locked.


At 2:30 in the morning, I heard a noise coming from my closet. Something was scratching against the closet door. I froze. I heard the scratching again.


I covered my head with the covers and laid staring at the door, terrified of what I was hearing. I thought to myself “Aaron, it’s just a dream. You’re dreaming. It’s just a dream. It’s just a dream. None of this is happening.” But I didn’t dare to speak or even whisper. I was completely frozen in fear.


I laid in bed, dead silent, waiting for the scratching to stop. I kept trying to remind myself that it wasn’t real. It wasn’t real. IT’S NOT REAL. The scratching finally stopped.


Then the doorknob slowly started to turn. Luckily, the door was locked. But the turning of the knob started getting aggressive. Something was not happy to be locked out of the room - just pushing into the door, forcing the doorknob to turn, trying to break in.


At that point I hid all the way under my covers, staring at the sheet covering my head, this thin layer of protection keeping me safe.


I heard a click, and the noise stopped. But then I heard a creaking sound as the closet door opened.


I heard footsteps approaching my bed. And I screamed. 


The covers lifted and it was my mom. She came to check on me because she heard banging upstairs. I told her what happened. 


She didn’t believe me at the time because this was the first encounter in the house. 


But my closet door was open. 


She told me it was just a nightmare. Nobody was there. It wasn’t a nightmare. She closed the closet door and locked it before going back to her room.


After that night, I realized that the lock wasn’t meant to keep people from going in. It was meant to keep something from getting out.


I wasn’t the only family member who experienced strange things in the house. 


My mom was woken by her grandmother in the middle of the night. She told my mom to follow her into the living room because she didn’t want to wake my dad. 


My mom followed her to the couch, where they sat together and she told my mom to pray for her. That she was in purgatory, and the clock was ticking. The clock in the living room was ticking loudly. She repeated that she was in purgatory. The clock continued to tick. And then it just stopped. My mom woke up the next morning on the couch. The clock was stopped at 2:30AM. Her grandmother had died exactly one year to the day. 


These weren’t the only strange happenings in that house, and I still have nightmares. I wake up 25 years in the past. I look toward the closet, and the door swings open. There’s a thin, bald man, crouching in the nook of the closet. He looks at me with bright white-yellow eyes, smiles, and charges toward me. I wake before he reaches me.


I don’t really believe in ghosts and the paranormal, and the house has since been renovated and purchased. But I have no doubt that while we were living there, we weren’t the only ones in residence.
