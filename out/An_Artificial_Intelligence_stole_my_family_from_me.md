When we got the thing I thought it was just another strange product my wife ordered off QVC. 

“Totem: Become Greatness”

It was advertised as a family friendly artificial intelligence designed to assist you in your everyday life and improve your quality of life too. 

I put it aside, telling my oldest daughter Cassie to tinker with it while I worked on the truck. She was the tech geek in the house, not me. 

I forgot about it until dinner time when I sat down for a meal and this weird noise erupted from the seat across from me. 

“Did everyone wash their hands?” A computerized voice asked softly. 
I nearly jumped from the noise and it made the kids laugh. Laura wasn’t as amused, chiding them for playing a prank. 

“I didn’t do anything. We just turned it on,” Arthur claimed. 

Shelby reached over to the empty seat next to her and showed us the activated device. It looked like the typical Alexa or Google Home assistant. 

“How much was this?” I asked when the kids tried to make it play music and it wouldn’t cooperate. 

“It will be worth it since I’m trying to get my business up and running. You can’t be here to keep me organized all the time,” Laura told me. 

“Well. Someone should read the instructions so we can at least shut the thing up,” I said as it began to play instrumental music louder and louder. 

“Sorry dad. I think it’s just trying to adapt to its new environment,” Cassie said. 

“You make it sound like a dog.”

“Well, it’s got a brain right? Maybe it can learn tricks,” she argued. 

I was too busy thinking of ways to take the batteries out. 

I wish I hadn’t let my apprehension of the thing wear off. A few days passed and Laura started to use it for reminders, financing and even tried to integrate it into the home appliances. 

One night while I was brushing my teeth she asked if she could upgrade. 

“I thought it was all in one?” 

“Nah. The model we got was just a trial. And I think it’s been helping. I’m doing a lot better now! It made me a website this afternoon,” she said. 

“I could’ve done that,” I said. But she reminded me that I had to work. 

“It sounds to me like this is designed to make you spend more money we don’t have,” I told her. 

“But what about getting the kids started with homeschooling? And having it assist with household tasks could give me more free time.” 

She told me that she would simply go with the medium level package and nothing more. I caved because I could see that she was enjoying the tech. 

The next thing I knew, her and the kids all had their own a.i. and they were using it daily. You know how people ask Alexa for every little thing? That’s what they were doing. 

I thought it was funny and harmless, at first. But then things got a little strange. 

I was ordering food from our favorite place when Laura stopped me and said we should consult the a.i. to see what was the best in the area. 

“We’ve eaten here like a dozen times in the past. Pretty sure it’s still good,”  I told her, but she was insistent. 

A few moments later the artificial intelligence gave the exact same suggestion as me. “See? The computer knows what’s best for us,” Laura said with a beaming smile. 

“Yeah…. But I mean you could have just asked me,” I pointed out. 

“Honey, no offense but the a.i. draws from over a billion different internet searches. Complex algorithms designed to provide the best possible results. Can you do that?” she teased. The kids giggled. I felt weird being compared to a robot. 

Then I got dressed for the day and Laura told me that I should change my outfit. “Totem says that the color for the day is green,” she told me. 

I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. And then I found out she had integrated it into the car too. 

Anytime I was going a little over the speed limit, that annoying voice chimed and warned me to slow down. When I got home Laura told me she was going to start letting the computerized system do the driving. 

“It’s safer than we will ever be,” she told me. I didn’t like it one bit, but it was clear that she had already made up her mind. 

The kids became more dependent on the ai too. Letting it decide what movies they should watch. What games to play. Soon it was deciding when they should shower or go to bed. 

One night things came to a head and I confronted my wife. 

“This is unhealthy behavior. at the end of the day, it’s just a program, and you’re treating it like it’s wisdom from god,” I told her. Laura looked at me like I had lost my mind. 

“Patrick. I think you’re overreacting,” she said. 

“Really? You’re going to play that card?” I walked over to the light switch and attempted to turn it on. Nothing happened. “This damn thing gets to decide whether or not we use our house? And how we drive our car? Just yesterday Cassie was letting it determine her dating profile! It’s gotten out of hand!” 

“It sounds to me like you’re the one that has a problem here,” Laura replied coldly. 

“What’s that supposed to mean?” 

“Don’t you see? It’s threatening your masculinity and you’re lashing out. The rest of us are happy Patrick! Totem has made us better,” my wife told me. 

“And we weren’t good enough before?” 

“I don’t want to hear about it anymore,” she said. 

The conversation ended but I felt I simply had to take matters into my own hands. 

That night as they were sleeping I got my wife’s phone and tried to figure out how to shut the system down. 

Then to my surprise I discovered she had changed her password. 

What happened to trusting each other? 

I sighed and went to Cassie’s room. I knew the main server for the A.i. was in there. 

If attempting to turn it off didn’t work, I decided the old fashioned method of taking the batteries out would do the trick. 

I picked up the small oval device and checked it on all sides, disappointed to not find a port. 

The device beeped and I realized that I had been found out. It was making a soft noise throughout the house. Like an alarm going off. Shit. 

I dropped the device and the lights flickered on. Laura was standing there in her night robe looking at me in disbelief. 

“What the hell do you think you’re doing?!” she said, snatching the device off the floor. She shut off the alarm and gave me a cold look. “I think maybe you should sleep somewhere else tonight,” she decided. 

I looked at her in shock. My wife was kicking me out of the house over a computer. 

I didn’t bother arguing. I grabbed a few of my things and promised her we would talk in the morning. I thought maybe just a night to cool off would help her realize that this was insane. 

But then when I returned in the morning, my key to the house didn’t work. 

I pulled out my phone and called my wife, trying my best to not get frustrated. 

“Patrick this is for the best,” she told me as soon as the line connected. 

“You can’t evict me. I’m on the damn mortgage,” I said, trying to look through the windows. 

I saw Arthur looking at me as he ate breakfast. He looked scared. 

He was Frightened of me. 

“I’ll be seeing the bank today about that. I think for now we need a separation. Time apart can do us some good…” 

I gritted my teeth. 

“Did the robot tell you that?”

Her silence was all I needed to get an answer. 

“We’ll talk soon, goodbye Patrick.”

As the line disconnected, I tried again to make the call but this time I got a tone that indicated the number was blocked. 

I sighed and called my brother to see if could stay with him. 

That was about a week ago. I remember every word of the conversations we had because I couldn’t believe that something this bizarre was happening to me. It was unnatural how much they relied on the ai. 

And it got worse. 

When I went back this morning to pick up a few of my things I was greeted by an unfamiliar face at the door. A face that did not look human. 

It stood about an inch taller then me with perfectly manicured brown hair and pristine white teeth. Blue eyes that looked like they were made of the finest glass focused on me as I stood in my doorway and felt like I was being probed. 

“May I help you sir?” the robot asked. 

“What the hell are you,” I shot back. A second later Arthur was at the door. 

“I can handle this, Sci. Can you go help Cassie pick out her clothes?” he whispered. 

He looked surprised to see me. And he looked like he was about to cry. 

“Arthur what is going on? Your mom won’t answer my calls and now I come here and this… thing is monitoring the house? How much did that cost?” 

“Everything is fine. You shouldn’t be here,” Arthur told me. 
His eyes were darting around. Was he worried that the ai might be listening?

“Arthur, tell me what’s happened. Are you and your sister all right?” 

“We’re never better and we’re becoming better every day thanks to Sci,” he replied automatically. It sounded like a script he had been coached to repeat. 

“Sci? Now the computer has a name?” 

“It’s here more than you ever were,” he replied coldly. 

I didn’t feel like fighting so I told him that I needed his mom to call me. 

“I’ll let Totem know and he can give her that message.” 

“No. Just you tell her. You don’t need to go through that bucket of bolts.” 

Arthur’s eyes became glazed. 

“We don’t have a choice,” he whispered. 

Before I could ask what he meant, the door closed on its own and latched. Another automatic system? 

His words chilled me to the bone. 

And as I walked toward the driveway I glanced up to where my daughters room was at and saw her at the window, staring down at me. 

Like a prisoner might stare at a free man. 

Then she breathed hard against the glass of her window and quickly wrote a message. 

HELP.
