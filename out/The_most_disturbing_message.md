I wish, I really wish that I could have died that specific day, exactly like everyone else, but of course I have survived and now I need tu support the "Thing" that watches me everyday, everyday of my life, laughing at me, but let's start with the start shall we? 

It was a really normal day, I woke up, I did my daily morning routine, going to school exactly the same I do everyday, but today it was different, today we had a school sleep over. If you don't know how that works, bassicaly we would stay at school over night with 3-4 teachers and sleep in the class all together.

The school day was really normal, all the classes came and went normal. However even if we do this kind of Sleep over every year, today it was different or that's how I felt, everyone was acting pretty normal too, besides one thing, all the teachers acted strange, every teacher acted specific strange that day, all of them acted strange. 

I and the rest of the class ignored their behavior that day, I and my best friend Dumitru, we were very happy for this sleep over as we, like every year, we like to wait until everyone is asleep and explore our school on night time. Our school is very old, builded around the year 1930's (Germany), first being a hospital for "special" treatment for [you know who] , I don't want to enter in some horibile topics, so figure out what I meant yourself. However that's what pur history teacher always told us, he was actually obsessed with this topic, I don't know, it was his thing I asume. 

However after the school day was finished, our teacher, Mr. Heinrich, our head-teacher came to us and told us the ussual rules we hear every year, but this time, there were three new rules :

~ 1. Everyone needs to be in bed by 22:00 pm

~ 2. Everyone needs [...] (I won't stay to tell all the boring rules, let's start with the three new rules They added this year) 

~ 13. No one leaves the classroom without a teacher after 12:00 AM, even for bathroom

~ 14. Don't even think to go near the basement door. 

~ 15. If you hear voices from the walls or see anything suspicios ignore all of these signs to be safe. 

The last three rules were really bizare, but we didn't really think about the much as we break all of them every year, but I wish, I really wish that me and Dumitru listened to the rules that year. It was 23:38 pm when we checked if everyone was asleep and just left the classroom. We left The class quick and went direct to the kitchen. There they always had a lots of Soda and FastFood that we ate every year. 

After we were finished with the kitchen it was about 23:57 pm when we heard steps on the hall way, it was Mr. Heinrich. We ran fast from The Kitchen do the oposite way. However he still saw us and he started to run after us. He said something like: "Hey stop right now, go back to the classroom for your safety", but we didn't listen, we run until we hitted a door because of our lack of attention. On the impact, the door opened and we just fell into a black abyss and 20-25 massive concrete stairs hitting the ground kinda harsh. 

When I was still confused, I heard a strong knock, again and again until the lights turned on, Dumitru did light them on. However, down there, there was only three small and normal wooden doors. However behind one of the doors, we heard a knock again. I don't know we still went to check. Behind The door was small room, maybe 3 meters every direction. However the huge metal door infront of us was the real. It was at least two meters tall with a glass Window, probably 10x30cm on each part exactly at The top. That's when Mr. Heinrich found us. He started to scream at us, he stood at least at 20cm from the door. That's the moment when the glass broke and a giant gray hand took Mr. Heinrich by his head and slowly dragging him on the window, fresh blood and flesh was now all over The door. 

In a matter of seconds we heard some keys, the "Thing" behind that door, tried to open The door. Me and Dumitru instantly ran upstairs. Just a few seconds later we heard the large metal door open and steps on the concrete. We didn't even have the courage to look behind us. I ran and hide under a Sofa on a hallway, thats when I realised Dumitru fell on The floor and my dumbass filled with adrebaline didn't notice. He was there on the floor, when that thing started to mutilate him. That's also the first time I saw the thing. It looked like a man with no genitals, with gray skin and you could see his bones trough the skin. He was at least 3 meters tall but because of his bad posture he seemed about 2 meters. But what really scared me was his wide opened white eyes with one black point in the middle and his mouth with no lips. That's when I passed away. 

I woked up 3 days later, in a hospital with my family around me. However not even after 5 minute 2 Cops came in my room and sent them away. They started to put me questions, all The questions were normal, like what you would hear after a mass-murder. But that's not all what happened that day, at night when I was alone in my hospital bed, I saw the "Thing", he was at the window smiling at me. He apeared every day since than. Now it's my 5th day in the hospital, he even left me some messages on multiple papers. I managed to translate them from hebraic. The messages are like these : [You can't hide forever], [You won't escape too], but the message that disturbed me the most it was : "I bet you wanted to die that day, my little Michael"....
