Look this might sound strange to all of you but the dogs have been acting very odd lately and it's just not the behaviour as well. 

This all started two days ago when a bright light flashed across the sky waking me up ( I'm a light sleeper by the way so slot of things can easily wake me up). I woke from my bed with jump as it crashed to the floor scaring my cat I don't own dogs as I'm highly allergic to them. As I kept to the front of my house I saw every dog in the neighbourhood just staring blank eyes into the night sky.

How they got out baffles me to this day but what happens next scared me. As like a command was given out or something they all just stared at me. It was freaky because the grinned. I slammed the door shut and ran straight to my cat hand hugged her. I didn't get much sleep after but when 6am rolled around and I heard a knock on the startling me with a half awoke and dozy I strided over to wards the to greet my neighbour Sarah.

She is beautiful women in her 20 with long wavy red hair and two gorges black eyes. I plan on asking her out one day but I don't have the courage.

"He- Hey Sarah what's up" I stutterd.
"Hey jack have you noticed anything strange"?

I looked at he puzzled I don't want to tell her about the strang incident with the dogs so I told her that I only saw a strange light and that was it. She sighed and waved me good by. As she was walking away I saw a dog from across the street grinning at me. I stared at the dog for a good while untill a neighbour walked past and the dog stopped.

Over the course of the day I noticed that niegbours who own cats are losing the beloved cats under mysterious circumstances. This made me panik very much as I didn't want my cat to disappear on me. So brought her a security Kenell to put her in at night. I thought she might be safe but last night one of the dogs got into my house.

I woke up to a massive sneezing fit when I released what's causing it I ran down towards my cat to a three headed German Shepherd clenching my cat between its jaws. I panicked and grabbed the nearest thing on behind me  and I hurled it at the three headed dog. To no effect it caught it between one of its head jaws and dropped it between its feet. It grinned at me as turned around it let out a massive Bork that shook me to the very core.

Heartbroken and still sneezing heavily i ran over to the front door to see that 10 or so other three headed dogs all where sitting in a circle with my cat in the centre. They all howled a creepy tone and soon a massive black three head dog with eyes of fire  came in and snatched my cat away. I let out an audible gasp and all the dogs quickly ran towards me grinning. I slammed on the door locking it. 

I ran up to my room and hid myself hoping that the dogs would not break down the door. I started sneezing and dread took all over my body I looked out from under the blanket a sure a three headed Pitbull grinning and drooling at me.

As on cue the grinning faces all turned into a horrific snarl expression but before the could pounce howling could be heard and the Pitbull perked it's ears and howls back and left.i looked over and saw that it was 5 in the morning and I sighed in relief. I heard a knock on the door and again it was Sarah this time looking very upset. She had told me her cat has gone missing and the dogs are acting strange, she had also mentioned that when her cat went missing she checked the vedio camera and saw a massive 3headed black dog on her outdoor cameras. Just before another three headed dog jumped up and tore the camera startling her. I comforted her say that that same night my cat had disserpared to.

I invited her in for some drinks, we chatted for a while and I found out we loved pretty much the same things. We where do intoxicated that we forgot the time and soon it was around 5pm and the sun was setting when we heard barking. Both of us sobered up extremely quickly and peaked through the window it looked like that all the dogs where in the street howling at something when the big dog came from up the ground and all the others wept into submission. The mighty beast gave out a massive bark shaking the entire niegbourhood. When suddenly one of my niegbours came out dazed and in a trance and stopped in the middle of the street. The beast let out another growl and the women looked around confused and let out a scream after seeing the massive creature. The beast turned his head and and groweld and as on cue all the other dogs lept on to the woman tearing her shred from shred spilling guts and intestine all over the place.

Sarah and I both hurled at the sight.
"We can't live here any more" Sarah yelled
"I agree with her but where are to move to I have only this house"? I retorted 

"My grandfather has a spare house in the woods far up in the north we can live there and get away from this mess".

I started to fluster and bluss and the sussgestion of that but was taken away when another screamed could be heard. We both looked out to see our niegbour John getting torn to shreds Aswell.

"It's now or never" she retorted

I looked into eyes and back at her and grabbed the keys.

"Okay now we must run to you car" 
" do you think can grab you keys"? She asked 
I nodded and ran to the kitchen 
"Okay let's sneak to your" 
"What are you kidding there too many dogs"? I quivered a replie.
She looked at me and sighed.
We will sneak when the dogs a ripping about the next human. 

We both heard screaming as the dogs where ripping apart the next human. She held my hand knelt down heading towards the car.
The screaming where louder since we where outside. We both tried to keep our stomach from hurling from the sounds of bones and guts being chewed into.

Crunch we both froze in panic and look towards the dogs all of them including the big dog was now staring and grinning at us. With a loud bark all the dogs started to run the 5m left and just before the dogs could tear into us  we both managed to shut the doors and started the engine. As I put the car into reverse we heard the sicking crunch of dog bones being broke. Under the car and the whining that follows. I floored it speeding of not wanting to look behind.

"We made!" Sara exclaimed.

I smiled at her and she gave the most gorgeous smile back that made me blush.

"Hey um do you want to"...
Yes she replied 

I looked at her with the widest grin on my face . Knowing we've survive a howering escape when she tells at me to stop and I slammed on the breaks. She got out and ran towards the object and when she got back in she showed me it was a cat. I looked at the cat and saw it was Russian blue. What ever it was doing out here I have no clue but after losing our cat it would be nice to have.
