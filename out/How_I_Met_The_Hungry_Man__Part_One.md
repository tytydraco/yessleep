I never met my grandmother, but my grandfather was a brilliant storyteller. As he got older it was the only time that the developing clouds of age seemed to dissipate from his mind, and genuine passion shone through. Bright. Creative. Aware. Of course, I was younger then too, and like most young boys I believed my elder's words as one would the gospel. I always believed that the prince saved the princess, that the thief was always caught, that the good guys were always good, and the bad guys, always bad. The only thing that was different about Grandad's stories was that, on occasion, the endings didn't have a happy ever after. Typing this, I remember one such story. One that involved a knight trading his horse with an evil wizard. so that his princess would get better. Then the story just ended. There was no running off into the sunset or marrying or whatever. He just stopped telling the story. At the the time, I remember liking these stories the best, it meant that as I tried to sleep that night, that I could explore the possible endings.

In my teens, Grandad's stories lost their allure to me, my attention stolen by the directions that my hormones took me; girls, loud music, risks and rewards. Through that time, I barely noticed him age, and thought little about what time he might have had left. "He was always going to be there" I thought, "he's Grandad, he's always been there." I needed him to be there. Throughout Mum's mental health crisis and Dad losing his job, he also managed to be strong enough to hold us together. 

 It had been in my first year of college, I was at a party and fairly drunk, that's why when Mum rang me, I couldn't quite comprehend what happened until I heard the angry tears.

"Jamie, he's had a heart attack for Christ's sake" she shouted over the phone, her sobs angry, confused, and frightened.

I didn't answer. I couldn't.

"Your father is going to lift you. Where are you?" her voice cracked.

"I..." I stuttered as the world sobered before me "I'm at Dean's"

"Where is that?" her voice became angrier.

"It's just past the library on campus" I pause, the realization of the situation dawning on  me. "Is Grandad going to be ok?"

There was silence on the phone, a silence that felt like a lifetime. "I don't know. I just don't know".

Dad and I hardly spoke as he sped to the hospital in his van, indeed we didn't speak until the elevator doors opened onto the hospital floor where Grandad was.

"Jamie" his hand landed on my shoulder "I need you to be strong. For Mum and for Grandad."

His stern eye contact was frightening, as if we were to face an evil together. One of Grandad's stories, about a pair of young boys who brave the depths of an abandoned mineshaft swept into my mind. I nodded "Okay, Dad."

Dad opened the door for me, a long shard of light spilled into the dull room from the hallway, my own silhouette looking distorted in the bright light.  Mum was on a small chair by her own dad's bedside, the yellow-brown light of the bedside lamp cast a halo-like glow about her head and shoulders, her shaking hands clasping the thin, pale hand that rested on the green blanket. A chorus of beeps and humming, provided the only noise in the room. Then there was Grandad, his head lying propped up on a white pillow, the shade of which wasn't too far from that of his own skin. For the first time ever, Grandad seemed like something I never before considered him to be. Mortal. Human, like the rest of us.

Mum lifted her head,  leapt up, and with her arms outstretched, ran to me, her face aged by the tears she shed "Oh Jamie"

I caught her and wrapped my arms around her tightly "It's okay Mum, we got here. We're here" My Dad put his arms around us both, bringing all three of us together. A unit against whatever was to come.

"How is he now?" Dad finally broke the silence.

Mum sniffled "He was awake for ten minutes, before he went to sleep again" she pulled away from Dad and I "The nurses think he will be okay, but they want to keep him for  a few days, just to make sure"

"What else did they say?" I asked.

"I don't remember Jamie" she answered sharply, before calming herself "I was so glad to hear that he'd be ok, that I stopped listening"

"Can I?" I indicated toward the seat

Mum put her hand to her mouth, her eyes clenched shut she simply nodded before Dad spoke "Come on Kathryn" he lassoed his arm around her thin shoulders "We'll go out for a smoke" Dad directed Mum to the door, casting an understanding eye in my direction as he shut the door behind him.

I sat in the seat, and took hold of his hand, hating myself for the smell of alcohol off of my breath. As my thumb ran over the skin of his knuckles, I was struck by two things. One being the stories that his hands could tell, blue veins, calluses, each wrinkle a memory and every blemish a tale. Age had molded him, changed him, and I was tearing up about it.  Secondly, how quiet it had become. The noise of the busy hospital outside the cheap door, seemed to have been extinguished. As if the world had been paused, even as I looked at the door, it seemed otherworldly in someway, somehow threatening in this newfound silence. The beeping rhythm of the machine my grandfather was hooked up to, continued unmercifully, highlighting the sheer quiet between each noise. As a twitching cold began to crawl its way up my spin, I turned to my grandfather for comfort.

His eyes were wide, alert, staring at the door, just as I was. A gentle fear began to gnaw at my stomach, and as if trying to recruit my bedbound Grandad, I squeezed his hand softly, but firm enough to get his attention. In response, his hand gripped tightly around mine, the pressure felt enough to crush my fingers.

His head snapped toward me, the machine beeping quickly. For an instant his eyes wore the expression of outright anger, before a cloud of recognition took over, the pressure about my hand loosened, and the machine slowed its protests once more.

"Hello son" his voice was weak but laced with a certain happiness.

Before I could answer I heard the noise of the hallway outside return, a man's voice cursing the vending machine that stood opposite the door. I smiled at Grandad as we both eavesdropped at the creative insults the stranger threw at the broken vending machine.

He chuckled with a grimace "even the vending things won't work under these conditions"

I smiled and tried to hide the tears that threatened to fall "How do you feel?"

"Considering how that man feels outside, I feel quite well" his low voice croaked in reply.

The door opened, a small, young nurse stood, hands wrung in worry "Mister...Mister Woods?"

My grandfather turned from me and answered "Yes, my dear?"

"There was a short and sudden spike in your vitals" she looked at me, with nervous eyes "please refrain from moving too suddenly"

'Grandad hadn't moved at all' I thought to myself.

Grandad must have noticed my thinking, because he answered quickly "sorry my dear, I dreamt of you, and my heart fluttered at the thought"

The nurse smiled awkwardly and nodded "You're awful sweet Mr. Woods, but please keep from putting your heart under too much excitement"

"They'll need to get an uglier nurse then" he smiled "isn't that right Jamie?" he lifted his hand from mine to pat my forearm.

"Grandad" I tsked before turning to the rapidly reddening nurse "I'm sorry, I'll make sure it doesn't happen again"

The nurse nodded before leaving the room entirely. I waited a moment longer before my head snapped toward him "Grandad, she was just doing her job"

The old man giggled "Jamie, I'm an old man. I survived a divorce and a heart attack, let me have a little fun"

I thought of the entire scene, an old man, who just survived a heart attack telling his college age grandson to lay off.

"A little fun that could send you a second heart attack?" I asked.

"No fun round here with your attitude" he faux sulked, his heavy breathing giving it an extra flair.

"Grandad" I paused as I thought how I could phrase this "What happened?"

His act dropped immediately, his eyes once again seeming brighter, wider.

The door opened, and Mum and Dad came in.

"You're awake Dad?" Mum rushed toward her father, her arms flinging around him, obliterating our conversation entirely.

She looked somewhat refreshed by the sight of her father, colour returned to her cheeks and, running to embrace him,  warmth came back to her entire being.

"I am indeed" He beamed back "the boy wouldn't even let me sleep with his chatter" his smile turned to me, silently telling me to never mention the strange silence we both shared.

Dad placed his hand on my shoulder, patting with a laugh "I think he inherited it from his grandfather"

"Let's hope he doesn't inherit my dodgy heart too" Grandad laughed from behind the veil of my mother's blonde hair that shrouded his face.

The remaining minutes passed in light-hearted laughter and reassurances, it wasn't until the clock struck eleven that I had become aware of just how tired I had become. My mother must have noticed my sudden lack of contribution to the conversation, and spoke "Jamie, do you want dad to leave you home?"

I looked to my father, who never left his wife's side all night. "No, it's okay. I better not drive when I was partying earlier. I'll just call a taxi"

At this my dad smiled, and digging in his pocket produced a twenty "Here" he smiled "Let me know when you get home. We might be here another while"

I  took the money, thankful that I didn't have to dip into my already dwindling student funds. A phone call and twenty minutes later I was walking up the long gravel drive that led to our home. For context we live outside a small city, in a countryside whose farms are slowly modernising to feed the quickly growing city. Yet our home remained the same, a small bungalow with a wooden porch where the paint was peeling, revealing lines of now-grey wood. It wasn't much, but it was home. When my weight hit the steps, they creaked gently, providing yet another instrument for the wind that howled and gently fondled the chimes. As I walked to the door, my hand in my pocket searching for my keys, I thought about Grandad. About Mum. About Dad. I didn't know how to tell them that I was failing college. That I was actually at that party tonight, trying to drown my sorrows. How could I tell them now?

These thoughts swirled in my head as I absent mindedly put the key into the lock, and it was only when I went to scrape my shoes against our mat that I heard it.

 I heard nothing. 

Nothing at all. The windchimes hung like chrome stalactites, unmoving against the wind that caressed my face, the rickety porch that supported my weight ceased its protests, and most unnerving of all was the lack of noise coming from the doormat as my shoes dragged across its wiry bristles.

I looked down to investigate, an uneasy fear intensifying into the oncoming rumblings of terror. This fear was soon replaced by confusion however, because there, on the doormat, was a small bundle of deep green grass. It was longer than the grass of a lawn, resembling the stretching physique of the grass that grew along roadsides or country lanes. Wherever it came from, there was an unusual amount of it. I dragged my shoe over the mat one more time, and the force of the pull made the small bundle lose its structure, allowing the wind to catch hold of its slender leaves and cast it off of the porch. The chimes rattled gently after that, and although I was glad to hear their music, I was all too eager to turn the sweat-drenched key and get indoors, away from whatever unsettling evening this was.

I went to visit Grandad the next day. Mum spent the day in bed, exhausted from worry and the sheer amount of hours she had been awake the day before. Dad was in the city, mowing a lawn for some rich out-of-town landlord. With no family around, I took the family car to the hospital (Saving more money).

Walking past reception and into the elevator, I automatically pressed the floor that Grandad was on, expecting that I'd be alone for this lift. That's why the high pitched voice startled me.

"Hey" she shouted "Hold that door" 

The voice was panting, but sounded somewhat familiar. I peered out of the elevator and seen that it was the nurse that Grandad had been talking to the night previous.

"Thank you" she mouthed breathlessly as she entered, pressing the button for the seventh floor.

"It's no problem" I answered.

As the doors closed she investigated me with her two, amber-coloured eyes. "Do I know you?"

I hesitated for a moment, leaving a brief awkwardness in the air "Yeah" I spoke quickly "I met you last night. I'm Padraig Woods' Grandson"

She looked confused.

"He attempted to flirt with you last night"

She stifled a realising laugh "Oh Mr. Woods on level 5?"

"Yeah"

"I know who you are now" she nodded with a smile.

"I'm really sorry about what he said to you, by the way" My mouth just kept talking, I wasn't even entirely certain what I was going to say next.

"What?" she knitted her eyebrows together "You've no need to apologies. I get a lot worse from men a lot younger!"

I smiled "Well, I'm sorry anyway"

She extended a hand out "Name's Gabrielle" she smiled with her teeth "I've to leave these documents to floor seven, but I'll be with your grandfather shortly thereafter. Perhaps, you could ask him to refrain from flirtations when I come in?"

I shook her hand "I'm Jamie, and I'll do my best"

The elevator door opened, and I was glad to have gotten away from the awkward conversation, I'm not afraid to admit I found Gabrielle attractive, her shallow skin was flawless and her easy-going manner was completely disarming. I thought about how a twenty-year-old might fake a heart attack.

I opened the door to Grandad's room, to find him sitting upright watching television.

"Ah" he exclaimed warmly "Come in Jamie. How are we gettin' on?"

"I'm good Granda" I shut the door behind me "How are you?"

I dodged any discussion relating to college, so our conversation focused mainly on Mum. He was worried that he had worried her sick, and that he hoped she would be okay. I assured him that she would be fine, that Dad was busy with his lawncare 'business' but that he and I would be there for her as Grandad recovered. He smiled at this and inquired about my Dad's business.

"Kiddo" he spoke quietly "I'm just worried about her is all. She went through a lot with that phase, and now that he's lost his job, times will be tough for you all"

The 'phase' that he is referring to is a period of time in which my mother lost her job, a childhood friend of hers had gone missing, and she had tried to slit her wrists.

"He's busy. Has four consistent clients now, and mum. Mum is doing well-" I was interrupted by a doctor and a student nurse who had entered the room.

"Don't worry gentlemen" the doctor assured us "I am just here to read your vitals. Please continue your conversation and ignore us. We will be out of your hair in a moment"

I did my best to hide my disappointment at Gabrielle's absence, and continued "But he mightn't have those for much longer"

"Why's that son?" Granda asked, his concern and consideration peaked.

"Well if he doesn't start sweeping the grass that comes from his boots from the porch, I think Mum will have him buried in one of the client's lawns" I chuckled.

Granda's smile faded "that bad huh?"

I continued smiling, not certain why his mood had changed "Well not that bad I suppose" I began to feel uncomfortable "There was just a small pile of grass on the doormat last night when I got home-"

Granda put his hand up, as if to stop me from talking. The doctor and student-nurse immediately ceased their mumbling at this strange development. His hand quivered in the air for a moment before he let it float down to the sea-green blanket that covered him. "I" his voice was low but precise "need to go home"

Silence deafened the room, as the student nurse eyed both me and the doctor for some inclination as to what was occurring.

The doctor broke the silence "Mr. Woods, I really think it is your best interest to stay-"

"I" my grandfather repeated, louder this time "need to go home"

I spoke gently, my eyes darting between the doctor and Granda "I think maybe one more day would really-"

"I NEED TO GO HOME" he shouted, causing the student nurse to bolt from the room.

"I NEED TO GO HOME. I NEED TO GO HOME. I NEED TO GO HOME" his shouting caused his voice to grow hoarse as he threw back his blankets and began his unsteady march to the door.

The doctor got to him first, and tried to peacefully block his advances. I instinctually blocked the door.

"Sir" the doctor pleaded "I need you to return to your bed"

Grandad's eyes met the doctors, and as if alight with a furious fire, his eyebrows curled toward the intense stare "I" he roared as he placed both of his trembling hands on the doctor's shoulders "NEED TO GO HOME" at this he threw the doctor to the ground. He was making his way to me, the very same look in his eye, when the door behind me burst open sending me scattering to the floor. Four orderlies flooded in and managed to wrestle him back toward his bed. His shouts grew louder, and admis the chaos I ran from the room. Bolting for the payphone that stood by the elevator.

Frantically I told Mum the situation. Hot tears streamed down my face. Did Granda have some sort of dementia? Was this something more than a heart-attack? I felt the world crumple, and didn't attempt to hide the tears as Gabrielle exited the elevator and sprinted toward the commotion of the middle-ward.
