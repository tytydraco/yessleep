In case that last text wasn’t a clue, my girlfriend Diane and I are not in the honeymoon stage of our relationship anymore. 

In fact, this June will be 14 months for us. We’ve had our ups and downs but what couple hasn’t? 

So I let her cool down and gave her space. I had to focus on work anyway. Diane was a second shift nurse and Covid had really messed her up so that meant the bulk of breadwinning went to me. 
 I wasn’t kidding when I said we were short handed. I work as a waiter for a four star diner right near the docks, and besides me there were only 3 other people working.

I figured if I let Diane be mad at me, it would only be temporary. 

But I was wrong. 

What happened this Valentine’s has had me questioning literally everything about our relationship. 

It started in the morning. I had to do double shifts and came home and crashed as soon as I got home yesterday. Diane was already fast asleep and had her back turned to me. I didn’t see much point in waking her up, apologizing and getting into another argument. As much as I hated to go to bed with her angry at me, it was the only choice I had. 

5 AM my alarm went off and I turned to her, expecting the same cold shoulder treatment. Instead to my surprise I saw her perfect green eyes staring at me. To be honest it startled me a bit. 

“Whoa. Look who’s an early bird,” I said with a nervous chuckle. She smiled back. 

“I wanted to spend the whole day with you, remember?” she said softly as she leaned over and gave me a kiss. 

You can bet I was confused by that. Why had she made a complete 180 from last night?

I accepted the kiss and played with a strand of her hair. “I know… and I really wanted that too. Look, I will make it up to you tonight, I promise,” I said as I gave her another quick peck. 

She pouted and tugged at my arm. “You don’t need to go to work. Stay with me. Someone else will cover your shift.”

The way she tugged, it actually hurt a little. 

“I wish it was that easy,” I said as I pulled away. Her pout quickly turned to a frown. 

“You promised,” she scowled. She looked like a cat about to pounce. 

“And I will make it up to you,” I repeated as I got out of bed. “But if I’m late for work this could cost me my job. I’m really sorry. Can we talk about this later?” I asked. 

Diane had turned her back to me, arms crossed. I guess maybe she thought her flirting would change my mind? I sighed but didn’t dare try the conversation again. I needed to shower and get going. 

Five minutes later I was soaping up and trying to figure out how to make it up to my girlfriend when I felt a hand on my shoulder. To be honest it made me jump. I couldn’t even open my eyes because there was soap everywhere but I quickly announced my surprise, “Jesus Christ! Diane there’s not enough room in here for the both of us!” 

She didn’t listen to me and started to lather my body with the foamy brush. I gotta admit, I was getting a little aroused. 

But something felt very off as I stood there and heard her softly hum as she stood next to me in hot water. Why was she being so quiet? She didn’t normally act like this. I mean… I know this sounds outrageous to be concerned about this kind of stuff, but this wasn’t normal for us. 

After being together for this long, I guess you could say the romance has kinda died. 

I felt stupid to think this was weird and tried my best to enjoy the shower with her. 

“You’re really trying to make this difficult, huh?” I remember saying as she started to gently tug downstairs. Her plan, I assumed, was to make me late with a little early morning hanky panky. 

“Babe… I can’t,” I said, feeling absolutely miserable for refusing her advances. Her low humming turned to a growl. It was a weird noise. Then she tugged hard and I yelped in surprise. 

She reached past me and cranked up the heat, making me scream in surprise as I felt it burn my skin. 

I got out as quickly as I could, shaking from the shock and grabbing a towel. 

“What is wrong with you?” I shouted as I dried my face off and finally opened my eyes. 

The bathroom was foggy from the steam and I could only make out my girlfriend’s silhouette past the shower curtains. She was just standing there letting the water hit her body. 

I was astonished that she was able to handle the scalding temperature. It didn’t seem real. Yet she was standing there as still as a statue, unfazed by the burning water. 

“I don’t know what’s gotten into you but it needs to stop. It’s childish,” I told her. She didn’t respond but it felt like she could see that her behavior was making me uneasy. It shouldn’t have, but this was unlike her. 

I thought I heard her softly mumbling in the shower. It kinda creeped me out. She used to do that in her sleep all time, but I guess I have become used to it. 

For some reason, I felt the need to leave. 

“I have to go,” I announced. 

I went back to the bedroom and got dressed. I was already starting to run late. So much for grabbing Starbucks on the way to work, I thought to myself as I glanced up and saw Diane standing at the closet. She was already dressed as if she was planning to come along. 

“We’re supposed to spend the day together,” she told me. 

“So you want to come to work?” I teased as I stood up and started to make a knot for my tie. 

“Here. Let me do that,” she offered. She stood in front of me and let her hands graze against my buttoned up shirt. 

She was clearly doing everything in her power to seduce me. 

“I love you,” I whispered with a lopsided smile as she finished the knot and tightened it against my neck. 
“Thanks-“

I didn’t get the sentence out. She yanked it more than I expected and I gagged a little. It wasn’t enough to hurt me, just startling. 

“Hey I think that’s good…” 

She pulled the knot again, this time making it hurt my skin. 

“We are *going* to spend the day together, Robert. Whether you like it or not,” she told me. Her tone frightened me. I’d never heard her talk that way before, not even when we were trying to be flirty and roleplay. 

I pulled away from her, the room feeling a little dizzy as I tried to figure out what was happening. 

“Diane just quit this! You’re being outrageous! I have to go!” I said as I made my way to the garage. I heard her hot on her heels after me. She wasn’t just casually following me. This was a chase. 

I managed to loosen the tie as I got in my car and then cranked the engine. But before I could shift gears Diane was in front of the car, her nails actually dug into the hood. 

“What the hell,” I shouted at her. 

The look she gave me was no longer flirtatious. 
This was the eyes of a woman scorned. 

“Turn the car off,” she told me. 

“I can’t do that. You’re really starting to scare me,” I admitted. It felt silly at first to say it out loud. What was I scared of anyway? 

Then I saw that feral look in her eyes and realized why I had said something. She was terrifying. 

“Turn it off!!” she yelled, scratching her nails against the paint of the hood. Instinct took over and I locked the doors to the car. 

Then I shifted into drive and let the car go a smidge forward, to push her. 

“I have to get to work, please get out of the way,” I told her. 

“So what are you going to Rob? Are you gonna fucking run over your girlfriend??” she shouted at me. 

I sat there with my foot on the brake, sweat dripping off the back of my neck as I panicked and shifted back to park. 

“Look! I’ll text my boss right now okay? Does that make you happy?” I shouted as I pulled out my phone. 

I sent the message and then rolled my window down, dangling my phone toward her. 
“Read it yourself if you don’t believe me!” I said. 

Diane paced toward the window and I tossed the phone over toward the garage door. She literally lunged for it like a wild animal. 

As I saw her move out of the way, I yanked the gearshift down and peeled out of the driveway. 

“Sorry Babe,” I whispered as I looked back at our house and saw her standing there in the garage, clutching my phone. If looks could kill….

As I turned the corner and made it to the highway, I found my body began to relax. I mentally began to write off all of her odd behavior. It’s not like she was trying to hurt me… right? 

I told myself the mood would pass and by the time work was over, she would be the one apologizing. 

That did not happen. 

I made it to the diner about twenty minutes late, offering the weakest apology I could to my boss and immediately began serving tables. Since it was Valentines, we were swamped and time flew by quickly. 

Whenever I did get a chance to catch my breath, I texted Diane. 

Rob: *I'm sorry about earlier but you were really freaking me out earlier.*

Then I got back to my duties. 

Or at least I tried to. I keep my phone on silent but it vibrates when I get a text. That happened repeatedly as I served the next few tables. I knew it meant my halfhearted apology wasn’t enough for Diane. 

I asked a coworker to run to the next table while I ran into the bathroom to check what she said. 

Diane: *it’s fine. I see what really matters to you.* 

Diane: *did you ever intend to keep that promise at all?*

Diane: *i'm starting to think that you don’t even want to be with me.*

Diane: *You’re going to be sorry for ignoring me this morning.*

Diane: *This isn’t over.*

I don’t know what I felt as I read that barrage of texts but the last one actually sent a shiver down my spine. 

I found myself wondering if maybe I had gone too far. Was she simply showing affection this morning or was it something else entirely? I shot her back a text, feeling guilty for all of my actions. 

Rob: *You’re right. I have no excuse. Please forgive me.*

As I stepped out of the bathroom, my phone buzzed and at the same time I heard a chirp from her phone somewhere in the diner. 

My heart skipped a beat. She was here?

I glanced at the phone as I stared toward the crowd. 

Diane: *Forgiveness is overrated.*

Then I saw her. Black sunglasses on, drinking a martini right next to the rails. And I immediately knew she was here to fuck up my day. 

I swallowed a gulp of air and kept serving tables, hoping that she wouldn’t make a scene. Instead, she requested me as a waiter specifically. 

I stood there in front of her table,  trying my best to remain calm as I said, “Whatever it is you are thinking of doing… please don’t. We need this job. It’s been rough to get good work these days since Covid and-“

“Which wine would you recommend?” she interrupted me. 

I felt flustered. 

“What?”

“Wine. Which wine?” 

“Umm. The Roselle is pretty decent…”

“I’ll take the whole bottle,” she said smiling as she offered one of my cards to pay. 

“Diane, I can’t afford that,” I whispered to her. 

“Are you sure you can afford to tell me no?” she answered back. 

I reluctantly took the card and went back to the bar, one of my coworkers noticing my unease. 

“Isn’t that your girlfriend?” they asked. 

“She’s in a mood. We were supposed to spend today together and well… anyway I need you to do me a favor,” I told them how I needed to get the bottle and pay for it later. I knew she was trying to screw me over for this morning, but this wasn’t acting rationally. The bottle was worth more than I made in a month. 

“Sure. I can put it on your tab,” they said taking the wine and walking it to Diane. I told them that I really owed them big time. 

The coworker winked and offered the bottle to my girlfriend who smiled and took it admiring its red glow. 

Then before Anyone had a chance to even think of what she might do next she slammed the glass bottle against the waiter’s skull. 

The patrons nearby screamed in shock as he fell to the ground and I felt my heart drop as she attempted a second blow with the broken top of the bottle. 

I leapt in front of my coworker, shielding him as people began to push away from the scene, shouting excitedly as they fled. 

“What the hell was that!! Are you genuinely crazy??” I shouted. Instead of responding she slammed the bottom against my arms, bits of glass cutting my skin. 

Before I knew what was happening she flipped the table up toward me, more debris hitting my clean uniform and then she started to slam the bottle against my shoulder until I was gushing blood. 

When the beating stopped, she dropped the broken bottle and walked out with her head held high, tossing the credit card at the owner as if it was penance for the damage she’d done. 

My boss rushed over and helped us up, immediately recognizing my girlfriend as the culprit. “Pack your things and figure your shit out. This is no good for my business,” he shouted at me. 

I didn’t have words to object I was busy keeping my shoulder from bleeding as pain shot through my body. 

A half hour later, I was a little stitched up in the employee lounge trying to beg to keep my job. But unfortunately thanks to Diane’s berserk mode, already the incident had several people reviewing on social media they would never return. 

“This could sink me. I’m sorry Robbie, I like you but this is too much,” they said. 

And just like that, I was fired. 

I don’t know what I did next. I must have been in a daze as I walked to the parking lot. 

I certainly wasn’t thinking of Diane, but at the same time I was enraged at her. And also absolutely petrified. 

That reaction was unlike anything she had ever been like before. Like a demon possessed her. 

I was half expecting the car to be smashed up with tires slashed too. 

Instead it seemed she had taken her rage home so I got in and took a deep breath, trying to figure out what to do next. 

I pulled out my phone, surprised that she hadn’t even bothered to shoot an apology to me. 

Rob: *Where are you? We need to talk.*

Chirp. 

Diane: *Yes. We do.* 

I looked up and nearly jumped out of the car when I saw her standing there like a stalker, suddenly appearing. 

Something told me not to confront her. 

But the anger of what had happened was too much for me to think straight. 

“Well, you got your wish. I’m going to get to spend the day with you. You know why? Because that little stunt of yours back there cost me my job!!” 

Diane didn’t even flinch as I got out of the car and yelled at her. 

“This is literally insane. I have never seen you like this! You could have sent me to the hospital!” 

She didn’t say a word and that only infuriated me more. 

“Are you hearing what I’m saying? I lost my job! We may not even have a place to live soon! All because you couldn’t wait a day,” I said. 

“So now you’ll spend time with me?” she whispered with a smile. It was almost sweet but also mortifying. Nothing else seemed to matter at that moment to her. She looked absolutely bonkers. 

“You know what? No. No I won’t. I’m gonna drive home and you can catch a bus or for all I care. But I don’t want anything to do with you right now,” I snapped. I turned to leave, frustrated that she didn’t see the consequences of her actions. 

Then I felt a sharp pain in my left foot as the sound of a gun went off. 

I crumpled to the ground, cussing out loud as I looked down at my toes. 

Diane was standing at the end of the car, holding a gun at me. 

“Oh my fucking god!” I screamed in pain as I grabbed ahold of my foot. “You just shot off two of my toes!! You just shot me!!” I yelled. 

Diane took a step closer, the gun pointed at my other foot. 

“It’s minimal blood loss. We can stitch it up at home. Get in the car Rob.” 

“What? No. I’m not going anywhere with you, you psycho bitch!” I shouted back as I tried to stand. 

She shot near my foot and I jumped back, reeling with pain as I stumbled to get up. 

“Get in the car before I make you get in the car,” she demanded. 

“Okay!! Okay I will!” I responded hobbling toward the passenger side and tossing her the keys. 

As I collapsed into the car, my girlfriend revved the engine and locked the doors. A few seconds later we were peeling out of the parking lot as I held pressure on my toes. 

“I think I’m losing too much blood. Jesus,” I shouted. She wasn’t listening. Her eyes had a look of hell in them. Determination and chaos mixed into a beast of fury I dared not argue with. 

We drove for almost half an hour, clearly not toward home, before I dared to speak again. Finally the pain had subsided and I asked her where we were going. 

Instead of responding she took the next turn. It looked like an old dead end road that overlooked the bay. Then a vague memory hit me. 

“We used to make out here when we were dating,” I said with a soft chuckle. Diane nodded. “You remembered,” she said turning to me and touching my face. 
“I want you to make love to me like you did back then Robert. Make me feel young again,” she said. 

She still had the gun right against her chest. Pointed straight at my heart. 

“That will make it a little difficult,” I said, gesturing for her to let go of the weapon. 

Her mood immediately soured. “How do I know you won’t just leave again. Like you did this morning?”

“I feel awful about that, I do. And I love this side of you… okay not the sociopathic parts but the sexual energy is nice,” I said with a chuckle but she didn’t respond back. 

“You think this is a game?” Diane asked, her eyes turning dark. 

That only happens when she is truly pissed off and I knew I had said the wrong thing. I knew to choose my words carefully. 

“I just meant that I didn’t realize this was so important to you. This is… all my fault. I’ve been so busy with work and our life has become so routine… I haven’t made room for romance,” I fumbled with my words wanting to say anything that pleased her. 

“I should have realized that you were just trying to be spontaneous and renew that spark. I’m sorry,” I told her. 

The darkness faded for a moment and she leaned in to give me a kiss. It was probably the most passionate we had been in months and it was electrifying. 

“Let’s go home and forget this ever happened,” I suggested to her. 

She actually giggled and for the first time since that morning I was starting to think things were going to go back to normal. 

I said nothing on the trip home, not wanting to break the peace that we had established. 

But any hope I had that this would be water under the bridge was shattered the moment my phone buzzed again from the back seat. 

She gave me an icy glare. 

“That’s probably work. It might be my chance to patch things up.” 

“It can wait until tomorrow,” she told me. 

Her tone was dark again and I knew better than to question it. 

Two minutes later the phone buzzed. 

“Babe, I gotta answer it. If I can save my job, that matters,” I said. 

“What matters is your girlfriend. I matter. Our future matters. Our love matters. Nothing else fucking matters Rob!!” 

She screamed at me as I tried to reach for the phone. Then she jerked the car and veered into oncoming traffic. 

“Oh my god!! You’re going to get us killed!!” 

I yanked the wheel back toward our lane. 


“At least we'll be together!” she shouted back. She had this look in her eyes that told me she was dead serious. She was heading straight toward a median. 

And then I did something I never thought I would do. I opened my passenger door and rolled out onto the road, banging my body against the pavement. 

The car behind us just barely managed to swerve. As soon as I came to a stop, my eyes panicked to find Diane. 

The car had smashed on the side of the median, her airbag deployed. But she was out of the car, blood dripping down her face and her eyes focused directly on me. 

I turned and ran. Despite the injury from my foot I ran like the devil itself was chasing me. The way she looked at me, I believed she was a demon on earth. 

She screamed like a banshee and ran after me. 

I was panting, racing through traffic zones and small stores to reach our neighborhood. Diane was less than a few seconds behind me. 

She was galloping like a cheetah. Damn it. I pushed obstacles to stop her and leapt over a fence, gasping for breath as I saw the street that led to our house. I was almost there. 

Diane yelled at the top of her lungs and leapt from the fence, grabbing me by the neck and slamming me to the ground. Her teeth jabbed into my side as I kicked and struggled to get her off of me. 

Finally I managed to break free and sprinted the final few blocks to our house. 

Hurrying inside, I locked the doors and frantically activated the security system. 

Diane was standing out in the lawn looking like a lunatic with her hair disheveled, clothes torn and bloody. 

“Police are on their way,” I shouted to her from the window. I didn’t know what else to do to stop this madness. She had gone too far. 

“Robert, let me in this house or I swear to god you’ll regret it,” she yelled back. But I wasn’t listening. I was grabbing a drink from the fridge and trying to calm my nerves. She had gone absolutely insane. 

And then I heard a crash of glass. 

Alarms immediately went off and I scrambled to the living room, shocked to see she was climbing in through the glass to get to me. 

“It doesn’t matter what you do. We are through,” I told her. 

Diane froze as she stood there near our fireplace, looking down at the chaos and terror she had brought on me and she began to cry. 

“No. No you can’t leave me. You can’t. I need you, Robert. I need you,” she begged. 

She collapsed onto the carpet like a limp noodle, balling her eyes out. 

I couldn’t help but feel sympathy for her after all our years together. I walked over to the wall and turned off the alarm. Then I knelt down and took her hands in mine. 

“Hey… hey look at me,” I said as I put her face in my hands. Her eyes were filled with confusion and sadness. Loneliness. 

“It’s going to be okay. I’m sorry… I’m so sorry it’s come to this… we’ll… we’ll get you help. We can work through this,” I told her. 

“You… you really mean that?”

I kissed her cheek and we hugged and she cried into my shirt. It was disarming and my body relaxed as we held each other. 

Then I felt a sharp prick against the back of my neck and suddenly my throat began to close. I was gasping for breath. 

I looked toward her hand and saw that she a needle in her palm, somehow secretly stowed away from where I didn’t know. 

“What did… what did you do… to me…” I said as I struggled to breathe. 

She smiled and touched my cheek. 

“It’s all going to be alright.”

I felt the room spinning. Then I blacked out. 

_______


When I woke up the first thing I realized was I couldn’t move my body. I was strapped to the bed. And this wasn’t some kinky roleplay shit, i was freaking the fuck out. 

And that was because I couldn’t feel my legs. During my black out I realized my girlfriend had cut them both off. I was staring at where they once were and trying to scream, but a gag was in my mouth. 

She stood at the edge of the bed with what looked like a power saw. 

“Don’t you see? It had to be this way. You wouldn’t spend time with me. And now… you have nothing else to do. You need me now. Forever.” 

She leaned down and kissed the stump where my leg had been cauterized. I screamed again, straining to break my bonds. 

“I love you Robert and love makes us do crazy things. One day, you’ll appreciate that I was willing to do anything to give us the perfect valentines.” 

She climbed on top of me, straddling me with a look that told me was about to do whatever she wanted to me. 

“You see this?” She paused as she found a little blue pill and shoved it into my throat, forcing me to swallow. 

“I will make sure this is a night you don’t forget,” she promised. 

I will not allow myself to write what transpired the rest of the night. But this was not passion. For me, it was nothing short of a living nightmare. I did not love this woman. Not anymore. Not after the hell she put me through this day. 

But I was powerless. And terrified. 

And I was begging for it to be over. 

Finally, it was and she went to bed. Then Somehow, I managed to loosen my left arm just enough to reach my phone. 

I sent a cry for help. 

An hour later, my house was flooded by police. Diane did not go willingly. I guess I should have anticipated that. But even after they managed to subdue her, I couldn’t bring myself to punish her anymore and just begged they send her somewhere to get help. A psych ward was the only place I was certain she might be able to come to her senses. 

I gave my statements and begged that this whole ordeal not be broadcast on the news. But as time has passed I’ve realized I do need to tell this story. 

I’m not really sure what I feel now, as Valentine’s Day comes to an end. 

Was anything Diane did truly out of love? Or did she take it all way too far? 
At what point did her love become an overwhelming obsession? 

I don’t think I will get answers. I just wish things had played out differently. 

Worst of all though, I hate myself for being a fool and still wanting her to be her old self again. Was that even possible? 

She is going to be the death of me, and I’m afraid there is nothing I can do to stop her. 

Scariest of all is that I know she still loves me too. I saw it in her eyes when they took her away. 

And I knew, without a doubt, no matter what happened. No matter where I ran. 

She would find me. 

And she would love me. Even if it meant our death.
