As you can tell from the title I’m currently - and will most likely be for the rest of my sorry life - in prison for a crime I did NOT commit. I won’t go too much into the details, but basically there was a murder and it got pinned on me. Wrong place, wrong time. Now I’m here, stuck in purgatory, at least that’s what it feels like. Been here for a couple months now and I finally managed to get hold of a phone from one of the guys in here (you can get pretty much anything you want in here, for a price of course). Seems as I was a redditor before being dumped in here I thought I’d start a digital prison diary or some such thing. I thought it would hopefully keep me sane and some people might wanna read it, just like you are now. People love hearing about prison and I’m rotting away in here so I may as well tell you all about the prison life. 

Well, that was my intention, up until my new cellmate arrived, now everything’s changed. He’s a strange guy, not met anyone else in here like him. He’s quiet most of the time, kinda disheveled, long greasy hair, scratchy beard and thin as a twig. Strangely he also has a vague similarity to myself, like if I had been left out in the woods for a couple years or something. Anyway, he came in on his first day and didn’t say a word. Just sat on his bunk starin into the ceiling and would wander around aimlessly whenever we were let out. He was like this for a few weeks, I didn’t even know his name or what he came in for and I just left him alone, he coulda been crazy for all I know. There’s a lotta crazy folk in here, I’ve seen multiple people get their heads caved in for no reason and I don’t want nothing like that happening to me so I just mind my way. He didn’t give off that sorta vibe though. He was creepy for sure and if you were in a certain radius of him you’d start to feel cold and unsettled, as if some kind of dark aura was surrounding him and was now seeping it’s way into you. I got used to that after a few days. I guess I had to. Everyone left him alone too for that reason, even the crazies and prison gangs didn’t wanna go near him, even they sensed a darkness to him. 

After a while I started to notice that sometimes he’d stare at a particular cell on the floor above. It was empty and had been since I arrived. No idea why, maybe something bad happened in there, I’m not sure, no one seems to know and the guards don’t say shit about it either. But he’d just stare at it like it meant something. I’d look at it too but there was nothing there. Then, just the other day he finally spoke to me. It was late, everyone was practically asleep already and I was drifting in and out of sleep when he suddenly said “have you ever noticed that guy in cell 12? Why does he never come out?”. I didn’t register what he’d said at first, I couldn’t really remember the cell numbers. “What cell is that?” I asked. “The one in the far corner, the only one that never opens”. I realised what he was talking about now, he was talking about that damn cell he was always staring at. That must be why he keeps looking at it, he thinks someone’s in there. This guy was more disturbed than I first thought. I stayed quiet, thinking of something to say to him. “I don’t think there is anyone in that cell. Been empty since I came in and everyone knows about it. Ain’t a soul there” He took a while to reply. “There is. I’ll show you”. I laughed and eventually went to sleep. 

The next day I sat down at my usual spot for lunch, not remembering the strange conversation I’d had the night before, when he came over to me. He leaned over me, his hair tickling the back of my neck. Then he spoke. “Let me show you. He’s there now”. The memory of our conversation faded back into my mind again, it felt like a half-forgotten dream. “Oh yeah you told me about him last night. I can’t see anyone from here” I had looked over at the cell and couldn’t see anyone. “You can’t see him from here. Come with me” He turned and walked towards his usual spot. I sat in place watching him, unsure whether I should go over to him or not. I didn’t want to indulge in his delusions, but there’s not much else to do around here so I thought it would be a brief moment of entertainment. I walked over to him, no one else was around him as always. He stood up right as i reached him and said “here, sit down” He wanted me to sit specifically in his seat, so I did. “Look, there he is.” I followed his gaze and then his hand as he pointed up to the cell. My focus switched from his pointed finger to the cell and I couldn’t quite believe what I saw. It was a man, his face pressed up against the bars, looking straight at me with eyes stretched as wide as they could go. No light came from the cell and none of the lights outside penetrated it enough for you to see anything within it so his face looked like it was attached to nothing, like a floating head. An intense sense of dread washed over me, like a rogue wave, it completely knocked me out. Literally.

I remember nothing after that and awoke in a prison hospital bed with an unbearable headache. The nurse said I passed out and then hit my head on the floor. A nasty concussion, but nothing more. I’d never passed out before and I had no reason to either. Maybe he did something to me. My thoughts were confused and the headache was overwhelming me so I tried to stop thinking and just rest. I went back to my cell after another night in the hospital only to find that my cellmate was gone. His bed was pristine and the smell that lingered in every room he entered was gone. I asked the guard what happened to him and he looked at me with a confused and slightly annoyed look on his face. He didn’t know who I was talking about and said I’d never had a cellmate. I thought he was joking but he didnt laugh with me when I began to chuckle. I started to ask around and no one knew who I was talking about. I felt like I was going insane. Has the entire prison decided to join in on a practical joke against me? Did I dream the entire thing? I have so many thoughts going on inside my head right now and typing this out is certainly helping. He was definitely real, I know he was. I have to go back to that cell or sit in his seat tomorrow so I can see that man again. Something strange is going on here and I need to find out what it is.
