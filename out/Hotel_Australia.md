My boyfriend and I have an on and off relationship. It's always me leaving and then coming back but it's always him taking me back. Recently, we came to the conclusion of going on a trip to fix our relationship. I saw a tiktok about a the top ten best hotels to go to when you need a break. The fifth hotel was called 'The getaway' in Australia. It had luxury and couple written all over it. We thought it would be perfect until we saw the price. "That's over 1000 Euros!" My boyfriend says and scrolls to another video. I tell him not to worry about the price and to just trust me. He sighs and nods. We decide to go one week later before we started to argue and change our mind about the trip. Upon arrival, we see a huge building that looked like it took over half of the country. "Let's go." I start walking towards a side of the building. "Where are we going?" he asks as he follows slowly behind. "The door is over there..." "Didn't I say to trust me?" He nods and we walk through a door. "How did you know about this door?" "I did my research." I laugh and we find an elevator. 
I lead him to room 66 and walk in. "Babe, what if this room is reserved?" He asks before walking in looking at the unfamiliar suitcases in the corner of the room. "You ask so many questions. My friend and his girlfriend are staying here and got us the room." I saw as I put my own suitcases down. He hesitated but walked through the door with a worried look. I turn to him and notice someone standing at the door. "Uh.. hello?" I slowly move myself closer to my boyfriend. The person stood there with a grin that could make your head hurt. "Can we help you sir?" My boyfriend asks. "Welcome to your getaway." The man replies without moving his lips and keeping the grin on his face. "Thank you.." I respond. The man nods and closes the door without losing eye contact. "That was weird." My boyfriend exclaimed and turned to me. I laugh it off and lay down. "Stop worrying about everything just relax" I sigh and pull him to the bed. "Where is your friend?" "I don't know. He was supposed to be here when we got here but maybe they went to see the ocean." I answer and rub his shoulder lightly. "Let's get some rest we did have a long trip." I say and turn over. Hours later I wake up and my boyfriend is sitting on a chair looking at me with a blank expression. "Are you okay?" I ask sitting up.
He shakes his head. "We need to go now." "What happened?" "I went to go get food and the guy that was at the door was standing right outside our door and still had the same smile on his face. I asked him if he needed anything and the only thing he said was our time is coming. What does that even mean? Why haven't your friends gotten back yet? I closed the door and looked through their luggage. Nina, Their 
bathing suits are still in their bags. Their phones are both in their bags and dead we need to go."  I stand up and sigh. "You're overthinking this." He shakes his head and I walk to the door opening it. As I walk out of it the same man meets me with the same grin. "Sir, are you lost?" I ask with an annoyed tone. The man inches himself in and looks down at me. "Your time is coming." I push him out of the door as my boyfriend stands there in shock. "Don't come back or i'm calling security!" The man laughs historically without even opening his mouth anymore than what it was. I close the door and walk towards my boyfriend taking a deep breath. "Nina..." "What?" I look over at him. He is looking at the floor with a disgusted expression. I look down and see the floor covered in mold and bugs. "Was this always here?!" I yell and out my shoes on. He shakes his head grabbing his belongings. I follow and grab my friends phone. It's on 2 percent  and has over 100 missed calls from a week. We head towards the door and he opens it. The same man is still laughing but he is down the hallway standing towards us. I head to the stairs and my boyfriend follows saying "I told you this place was weird." As we are walking down the stairs the lights start to get darker and darker until there is no more light. Our surroundings start looking molded and have water dripping from them. "What the hell is going on?" I say to myself as we reach the main lobby. "When we walked through the doors, everything was back to normal. People were enjoying themselves and everything was light and clean. I look up at my husband as he speed walks to the exit. I follow behind as a man stops me. "Your time has come." He states. My boyfriend grabs my arm and snatches me away. Suddenly a bunch of hotel workers start walking towards us in anger so we started to run to the rental car. My boyfriend makes it to the car first but I fall because my luggage was too heavy. I quickly get up and leave my bags running to the car. I finally reach the car but is stopped. Everything went black. "Hello? Can I help you?" I am brought back to my senses. I look around for my boyfriend. He's no where to be seen. I look around and see a woman and her husband staring back at me with frightened faces. "Why is she smiling like that?" The woman whispers to her husband. "What is she talking about?" I ask myself. I feel my face and feel the painful grin. The husband closes the door slowly and I stand there stuck. I can't move. My face hurts. "Why does my face hurt?" I start screaming and a man run towards me and says "Your time has come."
