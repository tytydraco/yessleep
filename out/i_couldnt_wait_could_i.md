We all lined up on the chalky line as the whistle blared loudly. 

“Today is your last day at camp! Tomorrow you’re all leaving my unit, i will miss you.” shares the counselor. 

i raise my hand to speak, as it had to be ingrained into our mind that at all time we should follow etiquette.  

“do we still have to run l-“ 

SLAM! The bulky lady bursted open the front doors leading into the commons. I could feel my legs getting warm and my pants getting soggy as she trampled over to me, i couldn’t withstand another beating. There at the program for ‘troubled teens’ you could tell the atmosphere was cold and full of fear. You couldn’t question anything or tell anyone or you would be put into the naughty time room, which is extreme hell, they change the room every time someone comes out so the next person wouldn’t know how to prepare.
 
“y- yes” i gulped trying not to show fear. 

She opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stops as lights appear from across the parking lot. A mother steps out of her car and over to speak with the lady. 

“Excuse me, i’m Dans mom, Agnes. I’m picking him up early because he has a doctors appointment tomorrow.”
Agnes looks at me squinting profusely.

“Ah you must be Xavier? Dans always tells me how fun and daring you are. One moment i can recall is when he told me you got up onto a table and threw spaghetti at the head mistress, what’s her name again? Hailey was it?”

i looked over at Hailey to study her face to see if she wanted me to respond or not, her face was sorta in a distorted smile with her eyebrows raised. She gestured at me to go talk to Dan and Agnes. i walked over to Agnes’s car where dan and his mom are. 

“Dan is it safe to talk, is she listening?” 

“No.” Dan whispers softly is a reassuring type way. 

“Dan, you gotta sa-“ i almost blurt out but is saved by him putting his hand on my mouth and shushing me.“shh.

“she still has ears you know” dan says

i try to speak again in a more casual manner to not arouse any further suspicion. “Dan, you gotta save me. I can sneak into the back seat and cover myself so she can’t see me. i’m only 13 i still have 5 years when i can get free from this ‘summer camp’.”

“XA- Xavier are you idiotic! that would put my mom and me in danger.” 

“I know but-… Dan i need to get out” 

“XAVIER HURRY BACK NOW YOU WOULDN’T WANT DAN TO BE LATE.” i hear being yelled from behind me.

“Ah yes one moment please Miss. Hailey.” Dan replies back before i could even get a word in.

“i’ll save but you have to promise me you won’t tell her we were apart of this if it goes south.”

“i promise dan.”
 
“XAVIER NOW!” echoes though what seems like empty space because hailey was hollering so loudly. 

i hurried back to the camp in order to avoid a beating. I went into my room and changed my pants as quickly as possible. I tiptoed across the hard cement floor so i wouldn’t be seen sneaking out of my room, although i’m fairly certain the counselors saw me because we made eye contact but they were in the same boat as me so they let me go. Dan ran through the front doors just in time and leaves me with a quick glance and nod. 

“i forgot my belt!!” he said worried.
i ran through the doors and into his moms car while they’re all distracted by dan. when dan came back to the car i feels sense of relief wash over me. 

“i did it, i really did it.” i mumbled shakily

I must’ve forgotten the time as i drifted off into a nap. “WAKE UP! WAKE UP NOW! “huh? Dan?” “THIS IS YOUR FAULT XAVIER WERE ALL GONNA DIE NOW.” i gasped awake in a cold sweat with the picture of dan and agnes snapped necks still vivid in my mind. 

“are you ok back there?” by “wait dan you’re alive!? i must’ve had a crazy nightmare” “you sure d- d- d- did” Dans face slowly turned into a huge grin. “we’re dead because of you, you killed us.” the car ran into a tree flinging them both out of the front windshield as the car hurdles sideways…

And now here i am writing to you in search of what i should do. I already checked to see if i could feel pain and read. i’m 100% not still sleeping. Earlier I heard and saw a monster jump on top of the car early. The face of the monster was sorta in a distorted smile with her eyebrows raised just as Haileys was. Please pray as i will most likely not make it out of this car alive.

I love you mom and dad if you’re reading this, please kiss the cats for me.
