It all started about a month ago. I began to hear a knock at my door every day around the same time, at exactly 3:00 PM. At first, I thought it was just someone trying to sell something or maybe a mistake. But the knocks continued, every single day, without fail.

I tried to ignore it and carry on with my daily routine, but the knocking was persistent and it started to unsettle me. I couldn't concentrate on my work or my hobbies, and I found myself constantly looking at the clock, waiting for the knock to come.

One day, I finally decided to confront the person at the door. I opened it and found a man standing there, staring at me with an intense and unsettling gaze. He was tall and thin, with pale skin and dark, sunken eyes. He didn't say anything, he just stood there, staring at me in silence.

I asked him what he wanted and why he was knocking on my door every day. He didn't respond, he just kept staring at me. I began to feel uneasy and closed the door, locking it behind me.

The knocking continued every day, and I found myself growing more and more paranoid. I started to look out the window before opening the door, trying to see if the man was there. I even started to leave the house through the back door, just to avoid him.

I couldn't take it anymore. The constant knocking was driving me insane, and I knew I had to do something. I decided to go to the police and report the man. But when I went to the station, they just laughed at me and told me there was nothing they could do unless he threatened me or broke any laws.

I was at my wit's end. I didn't know what to do or who to turn to. I started to feel like I was being watched all the time, and I couldn't shake the feeling that the man at my door was somehow connected to my every move.

I began to isolate myself, staying inside my house all day and only going out at night. I was too afraid to leave during the day, when the man might be outside waiting for me. I stopped answering the door, and I turned off all the lights in my house so he couldn't see me.

But even that wasn't enough. I started to hear the knock even when I was inside, as if the man was somehow able to reach through the walls and knock on the door from the inside. I began to fear for my safety and my sanity.

I knew I couldn't go on living like this. I had to find a way to stop the man from knocking on my door every day. So I packed a bag and left in the middle of the night, hoping to put as much distance between myself and the man as possible.

I don't know where I'm going or what I'm going to do, but I can't stay here any longer. The man's knock echoes in my head, and I know that as long as he's out there, I'll never be truly safe. I'll have to keep running and hiding, every day, for the rest of my life.

I had been on the run for weeks, moving from town to town and staying in cheap motels under a different name each time. I thought I had left the man and his relentless knocking far behind me, but I was wrong.

I was staying in a small town in the middle of nowhere, and I had just settled into my room for the night when I heard it - the familiar knock at the door. My heart sank as I realized that the man had somehow found me, even after all this time.

I didn't know what to do. I was too terrified to leave the room, but I knew I couldn't stay there either. I gathered my things and slipped out the window, crawling through the bushes and running as fast as I could through the dark streets.

I ran until my legs burned and my chest heaved, until I was sure I had left the town and the man behind. I collapsed in a field, panting and sobbing, and finally fell into an exhausted sleep.

When I woke up, I was back in my own bed, in my own house. I sat up with a start, my heart racing as I looked around the familiar room. It was all a dream, I told myself, just a nightmare.

But as I got up and went to the door, I saw the scratches on the wood where the man had been knocking. The dream had been too real, too vivid, for it to be just a nightmare. I knew the man was still out there, still searching for me, and I knew I had to keep running.

I gathered my things and left the house, never looking back. I don't know where I'm going or what will happen to me, but I know I can't stay here. The man's knock will always be with me, a constant reminder that I can never truly escape him.

I had been running for months, never staying in one place for too long and always looking over my shoulder. I was exhausted and terrified, but I couldn't stop. The man's knock was always with me, a constant reminder that he was still out there, still searching for me.

One night, I found myself in a small, run-down hotel in a sketchy part of town. I was about to drift off to sleep when I heard a knock at the door. My heart raced as I realized that the man had found me again.

I didn't know what to do. I was too afraid to open the door, but I knew I couldn't stay in the room forever. I gathered my things and slipped out the window, running as fast as I could through the dark streets.

I ran until my legs burned and my chest heaved, until I collapsed in an alleyway, gasping for breath. And then, out of nowhere, a voice spoke to me.

"Why do you run, my child?" the voice said. "You cannot escape me. I am everywhere and nowhere, a constant presence in your life."

I looked up and saw a shadowy figure standing in front of me. It was the man from my door, but now he was different. His eyes were glowing red, and his face was twisted into a sinister smile.

"Who are you?" I whispered, my voice shaking with fear.

"I am the one who knocked at your door every day," the man said. "I am the one who has been following you, watching your every move. And I am the one who will never let you go."

I realized then that the man wasn't just a stranger. He was the devil himself, and he had come for me.

I remembered something my father had told me when I was a child. He had made a deal with the devil, trading his own soul for wealth and success. And now, the devil had come to collect on that deal, taking me as his due.

I knew I had to run, to escape the devil's grasp. But it was too late. He had me in his clutches, and there was no escape.

I closed my eyes and braced myself for the worst, but instead, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I opened my eyes to see a kind-faced man standing over me.

"Are you okay?" he asked.

I realized then that it had all been a nightmare, a hallucination brought on by my fear and exhaustion. I was safe, at least for now.

But I knew that the devil was still out there, waiting for me. And I knew that as long as he was knocking at my door, I would always have to hide and run.
