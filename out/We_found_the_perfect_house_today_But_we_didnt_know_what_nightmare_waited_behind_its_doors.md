We got the big house as we wanted. But what the hell is happening here …

I don’t know where I have to start the story. Let me type everything quickly before my mobile batteries run out. Sorry for my bad English.

This morning! It’s raining outside…I called the house broker. He attended the call and started “Sorry bro. I can’t find a big house like you asked. This town is not that much developed, so I unable to find a house that is big as you want”

I replied “No. Did you search on the mountainside?. I heard that there are a lot of options there.”. 

“No. I didn’t. That area is a bit remote and roads are not good.”

“But we can just give it a try.”, I said to him.

“Okay bro. I will come”

I reached the mountainside entrance of the town ‘Twine Meaks’. It’s still raining. The broker was waiting in a tea shop. 

“Welcome bro. Why do you need to hurry in this rain” he asked.

“Rain will pour for 3 days. So no point of waiting”

“So as I said to you, we are a joint family. My grandpa has 5 children and each of them has 3-4 children and each of those children has 2 children. So Imagine its size. That’s why I need lots of bedrooms and halls.”

“Oh, I got it. But it’s a bit difficult to find. No problem. Let me ask the town people.”

We drove for an hour asking many people but everybody said the same.

After some time I saw a weird old man. One side of his beard is white and the other side is thick black. He only wore underwear. His hair style looks like the Dome of Mosque. He was smoking in the pouring rain. I couldn’t understand how his cigarette remained lit in this downpour. . 

The broker called him.He reached our car. 

“I need to know about any palace-like houses here for  a large joint family”.

The old man smiled.

*“How long a home is, it doesn’t mean it will make your mind vivid” he replied.*

“Well sir, tell me about the house.”

*“No place is happier than home”.*

“Ooh man. Please tell us about the houses here”

*“Try to get into the heaven before they close the door”*

The broker got irritated. 

“Sir, we are not here to hear your quotes. Go to some school and write them there. Please guide us”.

*“Hahaha, Do you think the bigger the bedroom gets, the ‘lasting time’ in this world gets longer?”*

The broker pulled his shirt and tightened  it. “Mind your words and behave as per your age, you elder”.

I opened the car’s door and ran to them. 

“Hi guys, be calm… Sir, we just enquired about some houses. But you are speaking unrelated”.

The man was calm.Then we lifted his head and looked up.

“There is a house situated 3 KMS from here. You have to take a right turn from the Black Angel statue and follow the forest trail.” 

*“And before entering into the home, drink some Tea or Coffee and enrich your memory. And Remember and Remember and keep remembering!!!”*

My broker said “We are not old morons like you to forget things”. 

When we were about to start he peeked inside of the door and said *“One can cross the borders of the world. But no one can cross the borders of their mind and the time”.*

I smiled at the man. My broker yawned. We reached the house. The house looks good. But it doesn't seem like that much larger one. A medium sized house. 

The broker asked, “Did that old moron really understand what we asked?”

We entered the house. It looked nice. The hall was large, and had some sofas in the middle. The hall of the house is spacious and bright, with large windows letting in natural light. The walls are painted a soft, welcoming color, and a stylish chandelier hangs from the ceiling. A cozy, elegant sofa sits in the center, surrounded by tasteful decor and lush green plants. The floor is covered with a beautiful, patterned rug, adding warmth and charm to the space.

“Yeah. it seems good” I said.

“Well.. but we asked for a large palace kinda thing to that old moron. But since he might be suffering from Amnesia, he directed to a medium. “ 

“Okay. Let’s explore the house. We saw a lot of doors in the hall. I wondered why a house needs these many doors. Does it have a lot of rooms?.”

I opened one of the doors. I saw a room in some different architecture. A Moroccan type. I like it. 

That room had 14 doors. We opened one.  I saw a room in some other architecture. An Iranian type. Wow. It's different . 

That room had 26 doors. We opened one.  I saw a room in some other architecture. An Italian type. Awesome!  . 

That room had 53 doors. We opened one. I saw a room in some other architecture. A Japanese type. Amazing!

That room had 45 doors. We opened one. I saw a room in some other architecture. A French type. Beautiful!

That room had 62 doors. We opened one. I saw a room in some other architecture. An Indian type. Fascinating!

That room had 24 doors. We opened one. I saw a room in some other architecture. A Greek type. Stunning!

WAIT!!!!

What’s happening now. 

We keep on opening a lot of  rooms with different different architectures like a never ending loop. And there are lots and lots of doors per room. 

We became tired.

I asked the house broker “What’s happening here?”

He replied “I think this house has lot of rooms”

“Yeah, a lot of rooms”

“Okay broker, I am satisfied with it. Let’s go and connect with the owner”

“But, hey, who is the owner?”

Yes. We didn’t ask the old man. We came here and just opened the main door.

“That old moron doesn’t have a common sense to tell us about the owner of the house” , broker again.

“Okay man, whatever, let’s go and meet someone outside or the old man again”

“I will not be ready to go to prison for the murder of that moron  by meeting him again”, my broker is still angry with him. 

“Okay. Let’s leave”.

“We opened some of the room doors. But I stopped at a room. 

“Hi, which door to open? There are 53 doors here. Which door did we come by?” the broker asked.

“No man. I forgot. But I remember the east side. But here 13 doors are in the east.”

Some minutes later, we opened a door at random. We saw another room. I didn’t remember whether I had seen or not. 

“Man… it has 44 doors. Which door do we have to go to?”

“I don’t know. Just keep on opening in direction we came”

“But, I remember we switched directions sometimes. Right?

“Yes. Correct.”

We keep on opening doors and passing rooms.

I felt tired. I couldn’t proceed further.

“Let’s go man”, the broker said.

“We are only going outside. But how” 

Yeah. We don't know how to exit the house. It’s been 1.5 hours since we were opening doors.

“Okay. Try more”

…….

3 hours passed. It’s been 4.5 hours since we kept on opening doors. My legs were in pain. I was thirsty. We left everything in the car. 

“I don’t know how to exit this house. We need to find out. But how? “

“Why does this house have a lot of rooms with a lot of doors?”, the broker said.

“I think if we are able to recollect which doors we opened right from the beginning we are able……. Wait…. Hey, that’s why the old man told me to remember things. Do you remember that? ”

“Yes man. The old moron deliberately did this”.

“Okay. I am going to call the police”

“Yeah. sounds correct”.

The police took the phone. We told him the details.

“What? You also got stuck in that house?” he asked

I didn’t get him. 

He continued “Hai souls, you got into a house that has 1,234,567,890 rooms and the house is situated in a parallel realm and the entrance door connects ours and it’s. The only way is to find the exact doors you had opened and travel back on the exact path you came and reach the main hall and thereby open the main door”.  

“Okay. But how do you know these things?”

“Because you are not the one who called like this?”

“What? Then lot of stuck here and left”

“No my dear. It’s lot of *remained* stuck there”

“Sorry. I ….”

“Let me be clear. Yes. You are not alone there. You are accompanied by at least 4 living people if there are still living and a lot of corpses. Every month’s Full Moon,a group will see a small girl or a middle aged lady or old man standing in the middle of the road and guiding them to this house”. 

We were shocked. We were jerked. 

“Okay sir. Why don’t you come here and save us?”

“No. Because the house is only visible for someone who needs a house for buying, staying for a day or for renting. I know the place but if we reach there, we only see a weeping Willow of Purple color”

“What should we do now?”

“That is the only way to come out, keeping the same path. But if you forgot, no way unless by trillions of probability or combinations or permutations, you are able to get to the main hall in the house of 1,234,567,890 rooms and a lot of doors per room. ”

“Sir, we will die here due to hunger and thirst”

“No, there are a lot of kitchens there that have a lot of raw fresh fruits and vegetables.  You can eat them. But again, you have to find them”. 

“Don’t lose hope. In the past 20 years, 5 people managed to get out of the house. “

He disconnected the call. We also disconnected from ourselves. What happened to us? How we are going to find the exit. The mobile’s battery is now draining. I put it in “battery saver” mode. After the switch off, we lost connection to the outside world. The house is very mysterious. We are able to get the mobile tower. Even able to hear what’s happening outside like distant vehicle noises, birds, wind etc. But nobody from outside is able to see the house. We are trapped inside now. 

No way out.

Now , first we need to find the kitchen. But where is it ? 

Also, where are the 4 alive people ?

What if we are trapped inside forever until we become old and die?

Friends, please provide my ways to get out or live here. My battery is 85 % for now.
