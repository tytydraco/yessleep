a couple of years ago, i decided to go hiking, and i regret that.


a couple of years ago, i decided to go hiking, this is pretty common here, since I'm in Canada, but, after getting all my equipment ready, i realized it had already been 5 PM, so the sun was starting to go down, which caused the people i was going with to cancel the plans, and schedule them for the day after, but i really wanted to go so i decided to go solo.


after around an hour under the rising moon, i was walking through some trails, in a deep forest, when i suddenly heard a sound of a slash.. and liquid dripping.. i didn't think anything of it cause i thought it was most likely an animal trying to find some food.


after some time walking, i had drifted off into the forest, and had completely lost my way back, so i tried to find a small clearing to put down my backpack and pull out my flashlight, but it was pretty dark out, but not exactly pitch black.


under the moonlight, revealed itself a small area with rocks i could use to pull out my tools, and so i relied on my luck and put down my backpack whilst hoping whatever was out there growling wouldn't hear me.. and i pulled out my flashlight, after putting my backpack back on, i turned on my flashlight, and used it to try and find my way out, but, there was footsteps forming a circle all around where i was.. and they were too big to be human..


i immediately got freaked out and pulled up the flashlight, i looked left and right, nothing, i immediately turned on my back, and wait, the tree there had big claw marks.. they were too big to be of an average animal.. this really creeped me out, but i already knew i wasn't the only thing in the midst of that forest, so looking at the thick trees stretching for miles, i walked in a random direction, and i heard branches snapping around me, i knew they were snapping way too fast to be a human, so i knew i wasn't being stalked by some psycho killer, but i knew that there was something out there, i was mostly scared of coyotes if anything...


so i keep walking, and then i stop for a second, to look at the moon, cause i was trying to make out the time, but my watch died, huh strange? that never happened before, i told myself, but as soon as I looked into the moon, the sound of a growl broke the then complete silence, before i saw a big furry thing jump on me, and it slashed my hand off, and tore my backpack as well as everything in it before running into the dark of night..


as blood was dripping, i used some extra clothes i had brought to put pressure on the blood, as it was dripping, seeing my own hand, next to me, but not connected to my body was terrifying, and surprisingly, there was no pain.


i then got up, and grabbed my flashlight, and continued to walk, but i noticed, i had better stamina, i felt active.. and i could see very well, rendering my flashlight useless, i was wondering why cause it was already night by the time this happened, so i keep walking thinking nothing of it, until i suddenly, pass out, i don't know what happened after, but i remember waking up, i looked at my hands, i had fur..?


i was bloodthirsty, i couldn't hold it in... the.. urge... i was jumping from tree to tree and slashing animals in half, i was surprised, i had night vision and my arm that was supposed to be torn off was there, only that it was covered in fur, it felt like i couldn't control my actions, it felt like i was a spectator, i couldn't control my body, i could only just watch, as i was hungry for blood.


i don't remember too much from the night, it was all a blur, but i remember waking up, completely naked, on top of a tree, i took this as an opportunity to find the exit, and when i found it, i climbed down from the tree and ran towards the exit, whilst noticing that my hand was in my body. i stopped. and looked at it, it felt normal, it didn't feel like an artificial hand, but i definetly felt that it was more powerful, i also noticed i had better vision, as well as better stamina.


as i was jumping through the silver gate towards the outside, i felt a huge sharp pain, i couldn't handle it, i felt weak, but i managed to power through it and got out.


i went home, but now, every month for the last 4 years, i wake up, in that forest, completely naked or with torn clothes, sometimes on the ground in random areas very deep into the woods and not meant for public access, and sometimes on top of a tree, i never recall what happens before, all i know is that it's always night before everything goes blurry.

i have looked this up everywhere but i still can't find the solution to this problem, as much as i enjoy the boosts in my body.
