The Girl with the Handkerchief

The last day of the exam, which should have been a moment of relief. Instead left me with a memory I never forgot. She stood somewhere so close yet so far, where my hands could reach but my heart couldn’t, a handkerchief that was tucked in her waistband, the memory that followed me.

We were in class 8, I was a 14 years old boy, it was a day before the social studies exam, I lay in bed, ready to be struck with tomorrows tragedy, I hated the subject and the exams but that wasn’t the thing I was thinking about that night. An image popped-up in my head, a person I have seen thousands of time, I remember every detail about her, the lines that formed on her face when she smiles, how she uses her hands while explaining or how she throws them up in the air in anger or the handkerchief that’s always tucked into her waistband like her accomplice, she was simple, quiet, yet she felt more like a mystery it kept the 14 year old me up all night, frustrated, it took me a full long day to realize, I have gotten myself a crush.

I saw her two times after that night. Walking down the school I saw a person outside the building, in her simple dress, annoyingly beautiful enough, her accomplice still tucked on her waistband. Her face wasn’t the usually calm one, she looked in distress, like she had tug-of-war in her mind, she was murmuring words I couldn’t hear. Maybe I was too afraid to hear them. I should’ve said something. Anything. “Hey”

“Are you okay?”, but I didn’t say anything, I fixed my shirt and walked away. There was a moment I wanted to turn but the practice of walking away was too strong for that.

The next and the last time I ever saw her, the last day of the exam, if happiness was a moment it was it, everyone was running throwing colors in the air, but between those mirages of colors, there were two eyes which I can never forget looking at me or into me, those eyes were expecting something or saying something, she was there, her dress covered in colors yet never saw her so beautiful, she looked like she wanted to say something but words wouldn’t come out and I wouldn’t believe until I hear them. But as you can tell, I didn’t talk to her, I saw her friends around her and I tried to protect an image of myself I never truly had.

In life there are stories which could have ended differently, like this one. The choice of turning and walking away is my own, all I can tell you is maybe there was nothing, maybe there was nothing for her to say. It’s a story that never had an ending it’s a part of myself that will just fade away from my memory with time. Some stories aren’t meant to be completed, they just fade away into your memory

Edit- this is actually the first thing i wrote when i started writing so hope you enjoy ✌️
