I’m not a superstitious person. I didn’t believe in ghosts or demons until now. 

Yeah, stuff happens that can’t be explained. But I just want you all to know that it took more than a couple of flying spoons or a door opening on its’ own to scare me out of my job.

Since the department didn’t find any reason to keep this police report confidential, I will now detail you everything I can on what happened on the scariest night of my life.

We had just received word from dispatch to check out a noise complaint in a small neighborhood whose name I will not disclose for their privacy.

It was me and my partner. Let’s call him Paul and i’ll go by Mike. We arrive some time after midnight. The street is dead. Everyone is sound asleep at this point.

We park our patrol car in front of the forementioned house and exit the vehicle.

We knock on the door and let our presence known, “Police. Is anyone home?” A little girl, 8-10 in appearance, opens the door and peeks through the gap.

“Hey...” I crouch to make myself less intimidating. “Is your parent or guardian home?” She shakes her head.

My first thought was that she probably had the TV a little too high and woke up the neighbors.

But before I could tell her to stay inside and lock the doors then part, I heard the sound of crashing silverware coming from what I presumed would be the kitchen.

The entire house was nearly pitch black. The girl answering the door and shaking her head let me know she was alone. Which makes whoever made that noise an intruder as far as it concerns me.

I ask the girl to step outside and turn to Paul, “Paul. Why don’t you give her one of those lollipops you like to suck on when you’re nervous?”

Paul gave me a cold stare as the girl giggled. They went to go wait by the car as I slowly pushed the door all the way open, “Police. If there is anyone in this house please let yourself be known.”

Without a warrant, I had no right to enter the building. I tried my best to spot whoever made the noise but it is too dark to see. Just any sign of a threat and I would be justified to search the house. But nothing.

I left the door open and headed back towards Paul and the girl. “Hey again. I don’t think we introduced ourselves. I’m Officer Mike. This is my partner Paul. If I may ask, what is your name?”

“Maribel.”

“That’s a pretty name. So Maribel. Again, if I may ask. Where is your family?”

As soon as I had finished my sentence, the television in the living room turned on, volume fully up.

Me and Paul quickly turned in surprise and could see the television playing static from outside.

We put Maribel in the backseat of the patrol car for her safety as no civilians were allowed in the front seats. We then, against our better judgement, enter the house.

We tried every switch in the house but no lights came on. While wandering the house cautiously, I would catch a person standing in the mirrors. I thought it was Paul but everytime I looked behind me, Paul was nowhere to be found.

As I returned to the front door along with Paul, we both jumped as running footsteps echoed down the hall. We detached our firearms and aimed it at the source.

The footsteps got louder and got closer. But no one ever appeared physically. Lamps, chairs and other stuff started getting thrown around by an invisible force as the footsteps reached us.

We sprinted out of the house and waited by the front yard. The footsteps seemed to stop, followed by the police siren that went off.

I ran to the car and silenced the siren. I looked back at Paul who seemed shooked, “You alright, Paul?”

He takes a lollipop out of its’ package and puts it in his mouth, “Yep.”

I opened the rear door and checked up on Maribel, “You okay?”

She nodded her head so I walked back to Paul.

“I don’t know what to make of this,” he said.

“Yeah, me neither.”

“No. Seriously. Ignore the running invisible man that knocked everything down for a second. All the family photos, pictures on the wall,” he points at Maribel, “She’s not in any of them.”

“So what are you thinking?”

“The footsteps led outside. Then the siren goes off. There’s a million buttons in that car. What are the chances?”

“Paul. Are you trying to tell me that Maribel is haunted?”

“How do you explain what we just saw?”

“I’m sure there’s an explanation.”

“The TV turns on when we take Maribel outside. Prompting us to check it out. Someone or something shows up in the mirrors  but ducks away.”

I remember wanting to shut him up. Not because he wasn’t making any sense. But because he was.

“I know you seen it. It was prowling around. Then it runs outside and gets in the car. Tries all the buttons. I think a ghost is trying to get to the girl.”

I just stood there. Not sure what to say. Until Paul decided to start walking back towards the house.

“Paul what are you doing?”

“It only shows up in the mirrors. That’s how we find it.”

I followed him inside and watched as he takes a book from the counter and breaks the nearest mirror.

“What’s the matter with you?! That’s someone’s property!”

He takes a shard and hands another to me, ”It’s not everyday you get to arrest a ghost.”

We aimed our flashlights all over the house waiting for something to appear in the broken glass.

I recall praying to God almighty to not let anything show up but it did. I panicked as it swung its’ red boney arm at my back.

It ripped right through my uniform causing me to fall forward. I dropped the glass which broke into smaller chunks.

It continue clawing at my shirt and flesh but stopped when Paul opened fire.

I heard its’ screech fading as Paul helped me up. We both then hurried back outside to find Maribel missing from the backseat.

It was difficult explaining what happened to the department without sounding like nutjobs. The police cameras who we were betting on to prove our stories had shut off the moment we entered the house.

The thing, whatever it was, must have turned them off while we were unaware. The only part of our story that our police captain took seriously was the girl, Maribel.

The captain brought up a missing person report and asked us if this was the girl we saw. It was.

It’s been just a few days since I gave up the badge to save whatever little pride I could spare. I just ask to whoever reads this and to whomever it may reach.

The next time a door opens on its’ own or things move by themselves in your home.
