Hi, this might be a bit long, but I feel like I need to tell someone about this. Looking back after everything that happened, I realize that my childhood was a bit different from most. And only now do I understand just how frightening and dangerous all of these situations really were.

I was around six years old, so if I don’t remember many details, I ask for your forgiveness. I’ll try my best to explain everything as clearly as I can and not make it as confusing as it was. I’m traveling while writing this, but when I get back I’ll clarify some doubts and talk to my mom to better understand everything that happened.

Back to the story: I was around six years old, and my mom had taken my brother to the hospital because he had a high fever. It was probably related to the previous night when we had been playing in the park under the rain. This was one of the few times I stayed home alone, but my childlike mind didn’t worry much; I just wanted to figure out what to do to pass the time. Mom had warned me several times not to leave the house while she was gone and never, under any circumstances, to open the door for strangers. She also said she would call after a while to check on me and make sure everything was okay.

She left in a hurry; it was around 9 a.m. when she went out, leaving me alone at home. I think I spent most of the time watching cartoons on TV, though I don’t remember exactly. But after my mom’s first call to check if I was okay, I was already really bored. Without my brother — we were a team and always went on little adventures together — and unable to go outside, the day felt slow and gray.

I was in the kitchen, playing with my little cars, pushing them across the wooden floor, seeing how fast I could make them go. Then I noticed some movement outside, a sound coming from the backyard. The kitchen had a large glass door that led out to the backyard, a big yard, fully fenced, with a small wooded area behind it. Curious, I decided to see what it was. At that point, even the tiniest thing would have been the perfect excuse to break my boredom.

The backyard was fairly large, but there wasn’t much there — just grass that probably needed mowing, since my mom never had time for it. Slightly to the left stood a tree, not very tall, but it had been part of countless games, like climbing. On it hung a swing that my mom had finally installed for us after much insistence. Carved into the tree was a drawing of our family — me, my mom, and my brother. Above it were our initials and a heart.

If the noise came from there, there weren’t many places to hide. Behind the tree, it was hard to see from a distance. But once you noticed, it became clear: there was a pair of hands.

I got scared, let out a terrified scream, and ran back inside toward the phone in the living room. I hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to do. Finally, I called my mom; she would know how to handle this. For some reason, she didn’t answer, no matter how many times I tried. Giving in to my curiosity, I peeked through the kitchen’s glass door that looked out to the backyard. The kitchen was just past the living room, with no divider, only a fairly wide hallway. And then I saw him. A boy leaning against the glass, staring at me, one hand raised in a wave.

He looked about my age, maybe a little older, but not much. His blond hair was messy, and his clothes were dirty and torn. The boy seemed to be calling me over, and I don’t know what came over me, but I dropped the phone and walked toward him. I was still a little scared, trying not to get too close, partially hiding behind a chair.

“What’s your name?” I asked, but he didn’t answer, giving only a neutral look.

He kept beckoning me closer with his hand, but I kept bombarding him with questions. “How did he get here, and what did he want?” ran through my mind, though there were much better questions I could have asked — like why his clothes were dirty and torn. But no matter what I said, he didn’t respond; he didn’t open his mouth, as if he couldn’t.

“Can you talk?” I asked, now more curious than scared.

He confirmed my suspicion by shaking his head from side to side, giving me the information I needed. But what could a child who couldn’t speak possibly want with me?

I asked how he had gotten there, and he just shrugged, as if he didn’t know either. I noticed he kept staring at the door handle, as if silently begging me to open it. But I couldn’t. Just imagining how furious my mom would be if she found out made my heart race. He seemed to understand that I wouldn’t let him in, so he started moving away, heading toward the swing. There he stayed, swaying back and forth, perhaps enjoying himself.

I really need to go to the bathroom, but I didn’t want to lose sight of him. I locked the door and ran to the bathroom, trying to buy time. When I came back, he was still there — now just sitting on the swing, looking a little sad. I felt sorry for him; maybe he just wanted a friend. At least, that’s what I told myself.

“Do you want me to push you?” I called from inside, but the boy didn’t respond, not even glancing at me.

I felt a little insulted. I was offering help, and he didn’t even care. I opened the door and walked toward him, barefoot on the damp grass, repeating the question. This time he looked back, but still didn’t answer — he simply stared. His eyes followed me as I finally got close enough.

“Do you want me to push you?” I asked again, a little annoyed, wanting a clear answer. All I got was a hesitant nod. So I pushed him. He gripped the rope tightly, eyes wide, and then he smiled. For a moment, I forgot how strange the situation was: I was playing with a boy who had appeared in my backyard, without even knowing his name.

I noticed he had a slightly scraped knee, and his gray clothes — originally white — hid several marks. The one that caught my attention most was on his neck, sometimes covered by his long hair. For a moment, I almost mistook him for a girl. A purple mark, whose origin I had no idea of, remained a mystery — though it didn’t really matter, since he couldn’t talk.

I set aside my curiosity, stopped the swing, and asked him to push me this time. He didn’t hesitate and did so willingly. From a distance, it looked like just two kids playing, but anyone aware of the context would find it unsettling. I spent some time there with him on the swing, lying on the grass and telling him some of the adventures I’d had with my brother. He seemed genuinely interested, but I couldn’t ignore the nervousness etched on his face. It was strange.

I heard the phone ring in the background; my mom was probably calling to check if I was okay. I started to get ready to go back inside, but he held me back. He seemed uneasy, scared, or afraid of something. He gestured as if begging for something, but no sound came out. Maybe he was afraid I would tell my mom about him, which made sense. With a lot of effort and careful miming, he suggested a game where we had to climb the tree — I was skilled at it, and he couldn’t reach the top alone.

We spent another 30 minutes there. I tried teaching him to climb, but after a few branches, he became too scared to continue. I had to show him how it was done, climbing almost the entire tree myself. From the top, I spotted my mom’s car turning onto the street — she had arrived. I hid quickly; if she saw me there, I’d be in serious trouble. I had been told countless times not to climb the tree, even if I claimed to be an expert. With the skills I had, I could probably have pursued a career in it.

I climbed down and told my friend to hide until I could bring my mom inside. He nodded, still cautious, never taking his eyes off the house. I ran in and waited in the living room. When my mom came in, she seemed completely unaware of anything. She asked if everything was okay, and I joked that it couldn’t be better. She walked toward the kitchen — then suddenly froze. Something had startled her. She ran back to the living room and stared at me.

“Son, where is the—” she was cut off by a loud crash: the kitchen door glass shattered. We ran to see what had happened, but my mom stopped me from going further because of all the glass shards. She went outside to check. I was afraid she’d find the boy, but apparently, she didn’t. My heart was racing as I tried to figure out what had happened — until I looked down. Among the shards lay a stone.

As I stared at it, I heard a car screeching tires and speeding away in the distance. My mom heard it too and ran, crossing the house to try and spot the car, but it was gone. She took me out of the house, and we waited together for the police, whom she had called. Poor my brother — he was still feeling unwell, sleeping in our mom’s car, barely aware of what had happened.

My mom told the police everything. They were looking for a suspicious-looking car. My friend was gone. I didn’t tell her about the boy at the time, but later, when I mentioned him, her face turned pale with fear. She couldn’t believe what I had said, and asked a question that still haunts me:

“Were you with the boy in the backyard the whole time?” she asked. I told her, basically, yes — I had spent most of the time with him, only coming back inside when she arrived. She paused and took a deep breath.

“Did you answer my call?” she asked, incredulous. I explained that I had missed it because the boy was afraid I’d tell about him. That was enough to make my mom go pale, and the three of us ended up spending the night at a relative’s house.

Only later did I learn what had happened. At first, nothing seemed out of place, but my mom noticed the kitchen knives were missing. Later, while the police were still there, she saw that all the bedrooms had been ransacked.

Her question about the call wasn’t random — I really hadn’t answered the last one, yet she said someone had. The person hadn’t said a word. At first, she thought it was some joke I had played… but after seeing the state of the house, she realized the gravity of it all.

And the reason we spent the night away was that our spare key was missing.
