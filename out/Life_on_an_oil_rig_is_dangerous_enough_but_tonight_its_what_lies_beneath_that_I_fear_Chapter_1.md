This happened to me a few weeks back, and honestly, I still can’t properly process anything. I don’t know what I’m expecting by sharing this—possibly nothing—but if nothing else, writing it all down here will help me clarify some of the events that transpired that night.

Sleeping is almost never an option when the waves are this rough. The rig rhythmically sways, rocking my quarters with an unseen purpose. I push myself up from the comfort of my bed and squint at my alarm clock: 1:27 AM. Outside on the deck, muffled voices of my colleagues can be faintly heard over the crashing waves. While they speak too quietly for me to make out words, their tone is a delicate thread between fear and false bravado. I really don’t want to leave the safety of my bunk unless I have to, so I reach over the clutter on my bedside table, wrapping my fingers around the cold of my dense brick of a radio.

“Hello, is everything okay out there?” I ask, waiting briefly before trying again.

“Is there anything I could help with, or is this situation under control?”

A moment later, the sharp crackling of distorted wind is heard before the voice of my manager replies, “Nothing to worry too much about, son, just some—”

The signal cuts out, leaving me alone with the static once more. I twist myself to face the window again, preparing to knock on the glass, but the deck is now empty—my co-workers nowhere in view. A shadow quickly shifts out of focus, probably some kind of bird. I decide the most sensible option, despite the dread I feel leaving my bed, is to see what is happening outside for myself. The rig is expecting a shipment in about 20 minutes, so we need to ensure the offshore cranes are ready.

I pull on my orange Hi-Vis coveralls and put on a cloud-grey hard hat, slightly stumbling as the rig sways beneath my feet. As I rummage through my bedside drawers, I grab any tool I deem useful—a heavy-duty flashlight, company radio, and my keychain—clipping them all to my utility belt. Crossing the room, I pause at the pale door, raising my hand to the crooked handle. Is it really worth going outside? I don’t really want to get my hands dirty when it isn’t even my shift.

Guilt washes over me—what if someone needs my help? What if someone is in danger? After some consideration, I turn the handle, finally opening the door.

As I enter the dimly lit corridor, I’m immediately hit with the strong saline smell of the Atlantic Ocean. After locking my door behind me, I take a few hobbling steps through the passageway. The swaying continues. Each step on the rose-red carpet feels like I’m trying to balance on a tightrope a mile in the sky. I duck my head as I pass underneath some rusty and slightly flaking steel pipes. Door numbers decrease one at a time: 207, 206, 205, finishing on door 200. It’s strange to consider the rig can hold over 200 people at a time, though we rarely see above 180. At the end of the corridor, I raise my hand to cold-wheel the bulkhead door. I pause as the steel beneath the carpet ripples and vibrates—

CRASH!

The maroon carpet twists beneath my boots as I am flung back into some sprawling pipes on the wall. The corridor echoes with the sound of clattering metal and distorted agony. A sharp ringing overpowers my ears before dying down.

This wasn’t a surge, I’m sure—certain of it! Something hit the rig’s support. Something big.

The metallic smell of wet coins fills my nose as I slowly force open my eyes to a hazy image. Blood—my blood—drips, smearing down the side of my head, onto my fingers, my clothes. A distant blur of murmurs and the cluttering of people stumbling from their rooms mix like a chaotic symphony.

Should I check up on my coworkers? Maybe some of them are in worse condition than I am. What about the shipment? Should we warn them about getting too close? What if it was the boat that hit the support moments ago?

The lights flicker and hum erratically before completely shutting down, leaving me in a damp void. I rummage around in the darkness for my utility belt and grab hold of my flashlight, turning it on in the process. The shining light pierces along the lifeless passageway.

Securing the rig is my priority; I trust my colleagues can handle themselves.

I slowly rise to my feet, vision still vaguely blurry, and stagger to the bulkhead. Resting my hands on the wheel, I forcefully twist it, straining more with each centimetre. The latches click open, and I begin to pull on the door. Rays of faint moonlight glimmer through the crack as I slowly open the bulkhead, and I see the beautiful night sky.

The sky is eerily quiet, unnervingly still. It’s a blend of navy blue hues and spotted patches of glistening stars. There is no strong wind or heavy rain—only tranquility. Even the waves rest, an idleness as if waiting for something. The only sign of life is the smell of oil, freshly extracted from the depths below.

Yet the rig continues to subtly rock and creak, like a giant metal cradle suspended from invisible chains. There is an unseen motion, a deliberate purpose to its movements, a distant heartbeat rippling throughout the structure.

Only one looming thought enters my mind: if not nature, what the hell is rocking the rig?
