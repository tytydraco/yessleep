Two suns were shining on this particular day in June. The one in the sky, of course, and its twin beaming brightly back at it from the still surface of the lake. My small town thrived on this lake, especially during summer. It was the go-to local tourist destination within the county. Until recently, our fish population was one of the healthiest and most numerous in the contiguous United States. There was a factory, nestled in the surrounding woodland, that used the lake's waters as a coolant for whatever they produced. That factory employed over half of the men in the town until just five years ago, when it was purchased by an overseas conglomerate and forced to lay off its entire existing staff. Naturally, this move faced mass protests, but at the end of the day there was nothing we could do. Now the factory, along with a few rows of beach houses, lay abandoned along the sandy banks. 

I'm sure you can tell by now that my town was past its prime. Still, we tried to hold onto our title of a landlocked Amity Island. Crooked mayor and all. The day it happened, I'd descended on the beach in the early morning with my friends, intent on staying until sundown. By this point it wasn't too busy, but we knew that by noon, tourists would crowd the banks like locusts. We met up in the commercial area, a zone of kiosks and picnic tables. A few families had already arrived, and small children were playing by the waterside under the watchful eye of a parent. Once we'd all shown up, our little group of mostly twelve year olds decided that we weren't kids anymore, and that our station for the day should be where the teenagers hang out. The long stony strip that was scattered with empty beer cans and cigarette butts. 

That didn't necessarily mean we were too old for a little fun by the pier, however. We crowded on to the rickety dock and raced each other to jump from the abrupt end into the clear water beneath. I decided to hang back for a bit. One eye was kept on my friends doing their best drowning impression. The other was on Everly, the hottest girl in my year. She sat alone on a flat stone jutting out from the grassy hill, not too far from the edge of the lake. I caught her eye, took a deep breath and walked over to her. 

“Hey,” I said. 

“Hi,” she replied. 

She was nursing a quickly melting soft serve ice cream in a cone. It had mostly liquefied and was running down her arm. 

“Your ice cream is melting,” I pointed out, dumbly. 

“I know,” answered Everly. 

I glanced over at the nearby ice cream truck. 

“Want me to buy you another one?” I asked casually. 

She beamed. 

“Thanks!” she said and smiled. 

I met her smile with my own, then patted my pockets. 

“I… don't have any money.” I admitted. 

She scrunched up her cute nose and laughed. I knew I must've done something right. Before I could continue, I heard someone call Everly's name. I turned, and saw a frumpy, middle-aged woman waving her over. She stood and turned to me. 

“See you later,” She said and dropped her ice cream on the floor. I watched her walk off, and then made my way back to my friends who were only now emerging from the lake. 

At thirteen, I was the oldest and therefore the designated leader of the group. It also helped that I knew a shortcut to the beer can beach, as we'd started calling it. And so, it was me who led the gaggle of tweens away from the now bustling lakeside and into the woodland. We were all in good spirits, and the high we got from the prospect of months without school was more potent than any drug I've tried since. Like the rest of them, I was clad in shorts and a thick layer of sun block that acted like a second skin. I can remember the childhood bickering and cries of “wuss” and the occasional “pussy” directed towards the kids who didn't want to take the shortcut. Despite their protests, they still all followed me. 

It quickly became clear that I didn't know where I was going. We were now surrounded by trees and had somehow strayed so far away from the lake's edge that we could no longer hear the water lapping at the shore. 

“You got us lost, man!” Tyler, my snub-nosed best friend said, throwing his arms in the air. 

Everyone else stopped and waited impatiently for my rebuttal  

“We're like a two minute walk from civilization in any direction, we're not lost!” I replied snarkily and started to walk with more determination. 

“Some shortcut,” I heard one of the other boys mutter as they all gave up in their short-lived mutiny and followed me again. 

Soon, the noise of small, gently crashing waves returned. The once thick treeline thinned out like my balding father and I could once again see the lake laying just beyond our position. Any unfaithfulness my extended friend group had in my sense of direction had dried up. They followed me as we came across a large rock. 

“It's just beyond this rock!” I shouted back at my followers. 

While I knelt and tied my shoelace, a few attempted to scale the mossy boulder in one jump. One of them, a ginger kid named Jeremy who had a desperately small stature even for his age, managed the ascent first. As soon as he reached the top, he screamed. 

“Jeremy, what's wrong!?” A few of us said in something near unison. 

On the top of the rock, Jeremy fell to his knees. I ran over to him, as did a few others. We climbed up behind him and as soon as we reached the top, realized what he'd been screaming about. Washed up in the miniature inlet that lay behind the rocks, was a human body. A corpse. A person's remains. These were the terms that tumbled through my mind as I stared slack-jawed. As the rest of the posse crowded around me, a few had the same silent reaction I did. Some screamed. Jeremy began to cry. 

It wasn't long before morbid curiosity possessed me. I wasn't the only one. Me, and one or two others hoped down from the boulder onto the edge of the thin semi-circle inlet. Everyone was freaking out now. So was I, I suppose, I just had a different way of expressing it. Some tried to deny what was right in front of them, claiming it was just “fake”. I intended to show them what it really was. As a test of my own masculinity and maturity, I picked up a long, thick stick at my feet and walked over beside the body. I admit, I did think the theory that it was fake had some weight after I realized that despite looking severely decayed, it gave off no smell whatsoever. 

I poked and prodded it. With the help of my other stick-armed friend, we managed to move it partially onto its side. It looked vile. Just putrid. There wasn't a single fly or insect around it but despite this, it's face looked like it had been feasted on. The skin was slimy and white, loose adipose that clung to the bloodied skull. Its scalp was rotting away and looking like the threadbare knees of an old pair of ripped jeans. Greasy black hair, which had mostly fallen out, fell down to its shoulders. His nose was replaced with two leaking holes. One socket was empty. From the other dangled a useless eyeball. He, who I assumed was a man, wore green overalls smeared in dirt and other grime that came from spending who knows how long in the lake. When I poked his cheek, yellowing ooze poured out. It was real alright. 

When that realisation dawned on me, and the other older kids inspecting the body, did the gravity of it really sink in. I was looking at a human body. A real life dead person. I dropped my stick and swore. I couldn't fathom it, not really. My friend standing across from me shouted to the younger children to leave, to go and get help. Help, I thought, was funny wording. I looked at the corpse at my feet and thought he was long past CPR. Then it grabbed me. 

Its bony hand shot out like an unfurling mantis claw. It latched onto my ankle with a vise-like grip and used me to balance itself as it tried to get up. Moans escaped its hollow mouth as I screamed, as did everyone around me. I watched my friends bolt, leaving me to kick away my assailant. Finally, I broke free of his grasp. One kick shattered his remaining teeth like a dropped bijou. It stumbled back, almost falling over, but managed to catch itself. Once it was steady, it turned and looked at me with its dangling eye. I was broken out of my fear induced trance when it lurched towards me. I turned and ran, needlessly scaling the rock behind me when I could've just ran around it. I jumped down on the other side and ran, until the pain in my ankle overwhelmed me. Once signs of life were up ahead, and a quick turn around told me that the body hadn't followed me, I stopped and inspected the source of the agony in my leg. Wrapping around my shin was a white rash in the loose shape of a handprint. 

Someone called my name and my head shot up. Standing by a tree just in front of me was Tyler. Behind him, a small crowd of concerned adults were moving slowly forward. Varying levels of belief on their faces correlated to who'd been told just about the discovery of a body and who heard it had moved. Still, even the disbelievers were driven forward by parental instincts and fatherly one-upmanship. Cautiously, myself and a few other children followed the adults back towards the rock. My heart was pounding and my white rash burned like sulphur. Still, curiosity acted like an opioid as we returned to the large standing rock. I watched as a hefty, short-and-vest wearing dad who already had a brutal sunburn tried to discreetly walk past the rock, next to the water's edge and take a peep at the small inlet. The rest of our band watched as he crept around the corner - then screamed, stumbled backwards and fell into the lake. 

His scream caused a chain reaction of similar screeching. There was a collective freeze as we all silently waited for something, anything to happen. But nothing did. No one staggered from behind rock. And, more worryingly, the man didn't get up. I noticed some of the adults looking at each other, wordlessly forming a plan. I saw that plan in motion when three of the equally sunburned men split off from our group and walked tentatively forward. Children were being consoled around me, but I wasn't a child. Not anymore. I was thirteen for Christ's sake! I decided to follow the men. A few steps behind them, of course, but it still made me feel important. 

One, the taller man with, noticeably, the thickest head of hair, broke off from the pair to wander over to the man now lying face down in the shallow lake edge, calling his name reservedly as he went. I decided to follow him. He kicked off his flip-flops and took a few steps into the water, crouching down by the fallen man. I crouched too, feeling the pain in my leg flare. Looking down at my shin gave me the same nauseous feeling as gazing over the edge of an eroding cliff. I could see that where the rash had been was now soft, puffy skin that didn't look quite connected to the tissue beneath it. My own bodily worries were torn aside when the tall man screamed. His friend lurched up from the water, his skin dripping like wax. All I could hear now was people screaming. The men in the water, the two beach goers behind the rock and, of course, myself. I hobbled back on my bad leg as I watched the rotting man in the lake fall forward, chasing his would-be aider. At the same time, the body from the small inlet ran mangled from behind the rocks, chasing after two of the parents. 

The body's hideous shriek, I soon realized, was a plea.

“Kill… me… kill… me,” he roared, his voice sounding like he was drowning in thick mud. 

Despite the bolt of pain that shot through me with every step, I found that fear suppressed most of it. As the two living monuments to decay gained on me, I realized I wasn't escaping, but running into more chaos. Finally I burst from the treeline and into the commercial area. Before my eyes could even register the carnage in front of me, I smelled the blood. Its stench was overpowering. Noxious. It covered the grass, and led out in a trail over the stones, sand and white-painted wooden dock until finally it mixed with the lake water. Staring at the anomaly that coated the lake, it dawned on me that I was wrong earlier. The shimmer I saw wasn't just the dazzling reflection of the sun. It was a spectral shine that reminded me of a gas station puddle. It was like a tamed rainbow, dull from years of abuse, was being held captive just below the gentle waves. 

Black helicopters flocked overhead as I gazed at the destruction this shimmer brought with it. Dozens of people wandering the bank aimlessly, letting out animalistic cries as their body rotted. I saw a young mother cry as she held her quickly putrefying child. They were all still alive by some dark miracle, suffering through every second of it. Not too far from me, staggering between the deserted park benches, was a rotund man still with an inflatable zebra pool ring around his waist. He tore at his own face in agony, which came away from the skull like some extreme case of degloving. This scene and similar was being repeated all around me. Men, women and children, all bearing the same affliction. It felt like a glimpse of hell. As I stared in debilitating disbelief, something suddenly pounced on me. 

I was knocked to the ground, turning onto my back as I fell. As soon as I was down, my assailant dove on top of me. It was the body from the inlet. Now more of a skeleton, with the bare minimum amount of muscle and nerve tissue keeping him moving. He couldn't scream, couldn't speak. His larynx had dissolved from the looks of his neck. The remnants of his face were now inches from mine, and dripping a foul gunk onto me. His jaw bone swung open in an attempt to communicate. As it did, my hand finally felt what it had been searching for. I swung it around, bringing the stone down on the decomposing man's head. It splintered on impact, and he fell limp, slumping on top of me. 

With a heave, I pushed him off. His wasted body left a snail trail of flesh behind it. I didn't wasn't think of what was now coating my clothes. I stood, and brushed bits of bone and sinew from me. Now firmly dead, the man had no bodily functions left to fight against the rot. And so, his corpse, which had curled up like a dead spider, had begun to liquify. Soon, he was a puddle on the grass among a once white shirt and rubber waders. After what felt like years suspended in shock, I felt agency return when I saw Tyler being attacked by one of the rotters. Bloodied rock in hand, I began to run to his side but stopped when I realized the decaying mass assaulting him was his mother. I stopped just a few yards away. For me, seeing someone I knew in that state was traumatising. I couldn't fathom what it was like for Tyler. 

The distressed Tyler and his mother crumpled to the floor. His hands were around her putrid neck, trying to push her away. Even from where I was standing, I could see that she was crying. It was clear to me that she wasn't attacking him, rather she was trying to hug her son. I didn't know if Tyler had realized that yet, but I couldn't bear watching them any longer. Call me a coward, but I turned and ran. My bad leg carried me only a few steps further until I collapsed against a picnic table. I fell to my knees and crawled under the wooden shelter, curling up into a ball. Finally, I grimaced and looked at my wound. The puffy dead skin had rotten away, leaving a mass of bodily slime, yellow beads of fat and sinew. My milk white shin bone poked proudly through the tissue. I whimpered when I saw the damage. The pain was already too much to bear and it was only getting worse. 

My eyes were welded shut as I wept into my shoulder. When I opened them again, I wanted it to all be over. I wanted to be sitting bolt upright in bed, and for all this to have just been a terrible nightmare. I wanted the pain to stop. And when I felt an arm grab that back of my neck, I thought it soon would. Just not in the way I hoped. I was dragged on my back out from under the picnic table. Staring from the grass up, I saw that my attacker wasn't one of the victims of decay, but a person in a formless black hazmat suit. I heard a muffled swear come from his rectangular helmet when, I assumed, he noticed my wound. The long metal cylinder he held in both hands shook with indecision. I watched as he looked up from me and around. I followed his gaze and saw his coworkers swarming the warmth, torching any rotting screamers they came across with the bulky flamethrowers hanging from their suits. I looked up at the man towering above me in fright. Once again his attention turned to me. The last thing I saw was him raising his weapon. 

I woke up in a hospital bed an unknowable amount of time later. As soon as I opened my eyes, my mother, who'd been sitting in the chair at the edge of my bed, sprang up and wrapped me in one of her affirming hugs, careful not to yank any of the tubes that ran in and out of me. A nurse soon appeared, beckoned by some hidden medical alarm. She first warned my mother that I was still in a fragile state. Then, she began to read a set of questions from her clipboard. I answered truthfully, explaining that other than a full bladder and a dull ache in my thigh, I wasn't in any discomfort. She then handed me her clipboard and a pen, instructed me to read through the terms and sign a now broken non-disclosure agreement. Seeing no reason why I shouldn't, I of course signed my name. If I'm being completely honest, which this post has been up until now, I thought it was something to do with the patient confidentiality thing I'd heard about in a medical drama. She took the page back and smiled stiffly. My ears felt like they were filling up with wax after hearing what she said next. I looked at my mother, who began to weep. I didn't believe the nurse, and swung back my blanket to triumphantly prove her wrong. My right leg had been amputated from well above the knee. The next hour was occupied with my mother and a new nurse trying to calm me down. 

This'll be fifteen years ago this summer. I don't live in my hometown anymore. No one does, not really. It wasn't just the lake that was affected. Anyone who drank tap water in that same time frame met a similar fate to the people who'd been out swimming. I still don't fully know what happened. I have my theories, of course, but new better than to voice them. Any time I think about it, the black van parked across the street from my house would make me think otherwise. Until now. You see, since I started writing out my account I've heard banging from my front door. And- oh god. I think I just heard it being broken down. Please, anyone who reads this, get my story out!
