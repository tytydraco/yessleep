When Frankie died I couldn’t get over the irony of the accident that killed him. He was the only reason I'd joined the fire department to begin with; before him I’d been an aimless soul, kicking between school and a house full of fading childhood memories with an apathy that would have ended me if I’d let it.

Meeting Frankie changed it all for me.

Neither of us had the best start in life: my parents had died of cancer one after the other, leaving me to be raised by my grandma from the age of six, and Frankie’s mother and father were meth addicts that routinely abandoned him and his little brother to fend for themselves as though they’d forgotten they had children to begin with.

Frankie wasn’t the sort of kid you’d leave in charge of your dependents, either. He was skinny and angry, full of an intense energy that scared the shit out of his teachers and kept the peers that might have bullied him well out of his way, and out of mine too purely through my association with him.

In spite of this Frankie’s brother Caleb looked up to him, and I did, too, because no matter how wild he was Frankie always seemed to be doing something, whether it was an amateur money-making scheme or working out a way to sneak us into places we shouldn’t have been and wouldn’t have dared go on our own.

Old warehouses. The backrooms of clubs and bars. School after dark. As if by some weird magic we never got caught; Frankie seemed to know how to get out of anything or anywhere, talking so fast he could avoid trouble as much by bewildering the listener than reasoning with them. 

Then as he got older and calmed down a little Frankie announced he wanted to use that knack he had to help people instead. It was like listening to a hero declare his manifesto: I was immediately in, signing up to the fire service with him practically that same day.

He and I trained together for a couple of years, eventually becoming part of a team together, the routine and the heavy nature of the work grounding us after the dual chaos of our boyhood.

Part of that work was keeping fatalities to a minimum, but being first responders in a crisis meant that experiencing death was inevitable no matter what we did to prevent it.

When there were casualties on a mission we’d sit together, not necessarily talking, just keeping each other company through the images that came back to us, the sounds still in our heads of the dying or of those mourning the dead. But when we did speak on what we’d witnessed Frankie always knew what to say to talk me down from a ledge, how to make me laugh even when the stink of smoke and human flesh seemed solid in my throat.

That friendship was the closest I’d been to anyone, or ever will be again. Even on the days I didn’t see Frankie I thought of him, imagining what jokes he’d make or how he’d solve a particular problem, always with that same quick grin.

I was thinking about Frankie when the news came in that he and his girlfriend, Jenny, had burned to death in their home that night before anybody could get to them. An electrical fire, according to the report, that started small and had gotten out of control.

I didn’t believe it at first, couldn’t understand how Frankie—who could do anything, and was totally fearless—had apparently frozen up and forgotten his training, ending up killed just like any regular civilian.

But I had to go to his and Jenny’s funerals, see the closed coffins and the sickened faces of their relatives, and had to accept that I wasn’t getting Frankie back, and neither was the little brother he’d left behind.

I felt for Caleb, for although I’d lost my best friend I still had my grandmother and my work, but the kid had nothing, barely able to afford the house he was living in.

I remember how pathetic he looked, walking bent over through the graveyard, gripping his stomach through his cheap shirt like he was nursing a hernia. He wasn’t crying— I don’t think he’d shed so much as a tear even during the service. He was just shuffling along, ignoring me as I called his name until he disappeared through the gates.

Caleb was on my mind a lot in the following months, though not as much as Frankie was. Only returning to the work that had been his cause in life carried me through those days, and even then I barely got by.

So when I started seeing things in the fires we were called out to handle I kept it to myself. I didn’t want the sympathy or probing into my mental health. The time off the squad would force me to accept if they thought I couldn’t handle myself.

I couldn’t stand the idea of being alone with my grief, as though that kind of haunting was the worse of the two. But I know now I should have taken that time off, even left the service altogether rather than see what I did again and again and again.

It started with a fire that had broken out at a high school nearby. Some kid had been screwing around in science class and ended up setting the whole room alight. A few of the pupils were still trapped inside the building when my team showed up, and by then we only had a narrow window of time left to get them out.

My colleague Darrell and I were sent in for the job, being that we were both known to keep a cool head under pressure. Growing up with Frankie’s madness had taught me that, and I held onto the memory like a charm as we entered the premises.

Shouldering open the science classroom door I made out a figure moving ahead of me through the smoke, too large to be one of the children. Within seconds I realised that it wasn’t solid, either, though I saw it clearly enough that my partner jerked his head to follow my gaze. It was a man’s shape, though made entirely by the patterns and colors of the fire like the skin of some creature camouflaged within it.

The face, when it unmistakably turned to stare at me, was familiar. Though the eyes and mouth were only dark gaps formed between the moving flames I knew that it was smiling, smiling in the way I knew so well. That fast, reckless grin.

“Frankie?” I said aloud.

He wouldn’t have heard me over the noise if he had really been there, still living, but this Frankie—this weird, impossible version of him—did. He raised a hand to me, and without thinking I followed him into the fire, stumbling as I did so over the body of one of the lost kids beneath a broken desk.

I knew even before I glanced down at her that the girl was gone. Even after all those years in the profession I still took it hard when I encountered death, but what I felt then was beyond sadness or shock, beyond horror.

It was deeper than that. Bleaker than that. Cold sweat ran down me with the warm, and still I kept looking for Frankie through the fire, wanting him to come back to me as much as I feared what it would mean if he did.

But he was gone by then, and I still had work to do. I pushed on, Darrell moving at my side with wordless efficiency.

Every student that had been trapped in the classroom died that day, either from burns, smoke inhalation, or from being struck by falling cabinets and debris that had come down in the blaze.

That I had glimpsed Frankie before this discovery clearly signified something, though what that was I didn’t know. Strangely I didn’t doubt for a moment that I had seen him, though unlike my grandmother—who paid visits to spirit mediums and read tea leaves for her wary houseguests—I’d never given much thought to ghosts, even to decide how much I really believed in them.

Still it never occurred to me to consider if I was hallucinating through the pain of having lost Frankie, or picking patterns out of the fire that weren’t really there. I was certain of what I’d experienced, and though I didn’t know how or why I accepted it quietly as I had all the death around me.

Again I went back to work, the coping mechanism that was also the source of my daily suffering, an endless, self-eating loop.

I never expected to see Frankie after that, but I did, and many times. Always in fires, and always in the cases that proved fatal for the victims, his lanky frame moving away out of reach.

Frankie would never answer when I called his name or asked why he was there, though I was positive he heard me, his grin formed by a twist of flame, the black eyes seeming to narrow in recognition.

Soon I began to dread seeing him. I withdrew into myself, didn’t talk more than I had to. The boys at the station must have noticed, but being that they all knew how badly losing Frankie tore me up none of them said anything about it.

None, that is, but Darrell, who’d been at my side since the funeral, trying as hard as he could to be a friend to me even when I made it obvious I didn’t care for one. He checked in with me after every shift, hovering around as I prepared to leave, nearly falling down with stress and exhaustion.

“I’m fine, D,” I’d say. “Get off my back, alright?”

He wouldn’t. If anything he started watching me even more closely, having picked up on something fearful behind my defensive tone. 

Darrell was with me the day I saw Frankie for the last time. A knocked over candle had set an old house alight, causing parts of it to fall in on the young family sleeping there. Once we got in we discovered the three dead children almost instantly, their mother lying crushed under a broken ceiling beam, still just about conscious enough to call for help.

My partner and I went to her immediately to assess if we could safely remove the beam alone. As Darrell crouched down to talk to the woman I saw something shift in the flames eating at the perimeter of the room, something I’d seen so many times by then that I recognised it even before I turned around.

Frankie was looking out through the fire, watching the woman on the floor behind me die.

Suddenly I was unable to see anything but him, that awful face made of flame and the charred walls behind it encompassing my vision. My chest was pierced by the tight airlessness of panic, so overwhelming that I thought I might pass out if it lasted any longer.

It was Darrell shouting my name that broke me out of it. Glancing back over my shoulder I saw him staring at me through his visor, both hands gripping one end of the beam that had struck the woman down.

Then Darrell's helmet swivelled abruptly, and I realised with a feverish pulse of my blood that he’d seen Frankie, too.

“I need your help, man,” said Darrell, raising his voice to be heard through his apparatus. “Can you get over here?”

He hadn’t noticed that the woman under the beam was dead, her face turned on its neck so that she, too, seemed to be looking at the place Frankie had been.

Whether she'd seen him or not I’ll never know.

It was after the team and I returned to the station to debrief that Darrell lead me away from the others via a careful hand on my shoulder and sat me down out of earshot.

“You saw him,” he said. “Frankie. You’ve been seeing him for months. Am I right?”

I didn’t bother denying it, just nodded and took a gulp of the bottle of water I’d been carrying around the station as much for the comfort of holding something as out of thirst.

Darrell was silent for almost a minute, picking at dirt in the rim of one fingernail.

“You told anybody about it?” he asked at last.

“Just my grandma,” I answered. “But she’s sort of a hippie type. She goes crazy for this kind of thing. She just came out with some shit about how maybe Frankie’s leading me to the dead, or comforting them when they leave the world or whatever. Or that maybe he’s just letting me know he’s still around.”

In a cautiously neutral tone Darrell said, “You don’t think she could be right?”

I barked out a laugh.

“Nah. It felt wrong, seeing him. Dark. But I don’t know. It’s insane, right?”

Darrell nodded.

“You gonna tell Caleb about this?”

“Nope. He’ll probably think I’ve lost my fucking mind.”

Grunting, Darrell got up and walked a stiff lap around the room. He’d strained something in his right leg, and he cringed with every step, one eye nearly closed in a Popeye squint.

“If it was my brother I’d want to know,” he said. “Might help. I heard Caleb’s not doing too great. You should go over and see him. Could help you, too.”

Harshly I said, “I don’t need it.”

Darrell’s squinting eye widened.

“Man, I’ve been watching you like a damn hawk since all this started. You’re messed up. You need to talk all this over with somebody.”

Emptying the last of the water bottle I dropped its empty carcass on the floor.

“What about you?” I asked. “You saw Frankie, too. Maybe you ought to talk to somebody.”

With a gentle patience Darrell picked up the bottle and threw it into a nearby trashcan.

“I didn’t know Frankie the way you did. It didn’t hit me the same. But all those dead people we couldn’t save. That’s what gets to me. Gets me all the time.”

I realised, then, how selfish I’d been, so locked up in my own grief that I’d forgotten we were all part of it, all forced to keep on keeping on even as it bled like a bad wound.

“Yeah, I know,” I said quietly. “It gets me, too.”



I went over to Caleb’s house that night with a pack of beers, wishing that I hadn’t left it for so long. 

Frankie had been dead for well over a year, and aside from the odd text message here and there I hadn’t kept in touch. Caleb and I had never been close; he’d tagged along on some of those childhood adventures with Frankie, but he’d always been an afterthought, a timid hanger on.

Now when Caleb came to the door he looked worse than he had at the funeral, his hair in oily strings, an unwashed smell coming off him that was near thick enough to taste. His eyes moved from me to the cans as though considering turning me away, but without saying a word he let me in and collapsed into a stained couch, a shape like a snowman kicked down by kids, left to melt.

He hadn’t decorated for Christmas even though it was just around the corner. I kept glancing at the empty space where Frankie used to put the tree with a sense of unease at another thing missing from our shared world.

“You need help with anything, buddy?” I asked. “You know, if you’re having a hard time keeping up with everything...”

“I don’t need anything,” said Caleb. “Doing fine.”

He didn’t touch the beers, I noticed, just sat looking at the door as though waiting for me to leave. Likely hoping I would.

“You don’t look so great, Cay,” I said. “You ought to come to a bar with me sometime. Get back into the swing of things.”

Caleb nodded, but didn’t say anything in reply.

I plucked at the ring pull on one of the beer cans anxiously.

“Cay,” I said. “It’s gonna sound nuts, but there’s something you need to know. It’s about Frankie.”

Hearing his brother’s name Caleb started in his seat.

“What about him?”

“Sorry,” I said, wondering if it had been a mistake to come here while the death was still so fresh to him. “I know how it feels, losing him, is all. It fucked me up too. But listen, something’s been happening to me since then. You’re not gonna believe it, but I swear it’s the truth.”

Caleb’s hands began to twitch, and he pressed them between his knees to keep them still.

“It’s about the fires,” he said. “Isn’t it?”

I stared at him, trying to figure out his expression in the relative dark of the room.

“You already know? Who told you? Darrell? He swore he wouldn’t say anything till I came by. Look, I don’t want to sound crazy. Like I’m seeing things or whatever. But he saw it, both of us did.”

Caleb frowned.

“Wait. What are you talking about, Drew?”

I cracked open a beer and got the story out as I drank, watching Caleb squeeze his hands together between his knees in mounting agitation.

“So, anyway, it might not be a bad thing, you know?” I said, feeling stupid even as the words left my mouth. 

I wasn’t like my grandmother, with her spell jars and tarot decks. I didn’t really believe it.

“Maybe he’s trying to help me with the work. Or could be he just wants us to know he’s still here or something.”

Caleb shook his head violently, the dirty ropes of hair thrashing his forehead.

“Sure. He wants us to know. But it’s not a good thing. You get that, right?

I fidgeted, trying not to acknowledge the awful tension that had entered that room, the same I felt in so many fires now.

“There was something up between you two,” I said, “wasn’t there?”

“Not with us,” said Caleb flatly. “With Frankie. I tried to help him. Then I protected him. Then I started losing my nerve, told him I was gonna do something about it. Next thing I knew he was dead. Figured it was my fault, but now I think that was the plan all along. Everything was building up to this. All of it.”

Caleb ran the back of his hand across his nose, sniffing thickly.

“One night last year Frankie came home on one of his days off, stinking of smoke. His fingernails were black— I couldn’t sleep, so I was in the living room watching TV when he came in. He hadn’t been expecting me. Stopped dead when he saw me, and right away I knew he’d been up to something. Came out with some excuse. He was a good liar, but he was my brother. I knew him. And I didn’t buy a single word.

I kind of just left it for a while. Hoped I was wrong and he really had been camping or whatever he said he’d been doing. But after that I had insomnia for a while. Couldn’t sleep more than a few hours a night. Stayed up late and kept on catching him the same way. Smelling like he’d been in a fire when he hadn’t called in at the station. I tried to think of ways to get the truth out of him. I’m not confrontational, you know?

But in the end he sat down right there where you’re sitting now and he told me all by himself.”

As if some inner resolve had broken Caleb reached over and took one of the beer cans. He didn’t drink from it, just sat there holding it in both hands, toying with the ring pull.

“Frankie said he always had this thing about fire. He was drawn to it. Fascinated. For a while he thought he wanted to save people from it, and that’s what it was all about. It’s why he worked so hard to get into the fire department. For the first couple of years he thought he had it right. That was what he wanted. But then there was some incident where a lady died, the first time you couldn’t get somebody out alive.”

“I remember,” I said. “She was elderly. Smoking in bed and the place just lit up. Furniture fell across the door in the room she was in. She was dead by the time we got to her. I’ll never forget it.”

I tried not to think about how she’d looked, the stink of fat going up on her body, cooking on her bones. In fact I’d blocked it out so well over the years that what I remembered most about that night was how Frankie’s face had looked through his visor, the black of his dark eyes like some dead thing burned.

We’d seen worse responding to various emergencies since then: little kids killed in vehicular accidents, whole families torn apart by gas explosions, pieces strewn all over the ground for us to find. But the first death you ever see sticks with you, changes you in a way you can’t undo no matter how far you grow away from it.

That had happened to Frankie, I knew, but it had happened to me, too. I’d never been able to stand the smell of cigarettes since that day and would leave the room whenever my grandma sparked one up; none of my stories ever got her to quit.

“Frankie would never talk about that call,” I said. “What did he tell you?”

Caleb swung forward slightly in his seat like he was going to be sick. 

“He said when he saw the dead woman on fire he got— excited about it. Like, he was so worked up he got paranoid you’d notice. Guess you never did, though. Well, Frankie couldn’t stop thinking about what he saw, wishing somehow he’d had a hand in what happened to the old lady. Kept imagining how he would have got that fire going himself without anybody figuring out it was arson.

After he’d been on the squad long enough he started to learn how people got away with it for insurance fraud and shit like that. He didn’t do anything with it for a while, though. Just kept his head down and did the work. Tried to act normal even though every time someone died in a blaze he got worked up over it.”

All the time Caleb talked I was shifting restlessly in my chair, always at the point of leaving and never quite able to do it.

In the end, Caleb told me, Frankie had started sneaking out on some of his nights off, meaning to scratch the itch that had started in Ms Hodgson’s house. There were lonely people all over town he knew from various calls he’d made over the years, people who were old, or sick, or mentally unsound.

People whose families didn’t go by enough, or that didn’t have family at all.

There was an old guy on the outskirts of town that lived by himself and was generally sound asleep by 9pm most nights on account of the cocktail of drugs he was taking to manage an illness. Frankie paid the house a visit, able to get in through an unlocked door at the back unnoticed.

Once inside he had, in Caleb’s words, ‘done something’; whether he’d turned the stove on or messed with the electrics Frankie wouldn’t say, smiling over the secret even as he refused to give it up. All that he’d admit was that he rigged the house to burn in some way he was confident wouldn’t be flagged as intentional and left the building to watch from a distance, waiting for his work to pay off.

Sure enough the house went up in flames, and though Frankie couldn’t see the old man die he knew he wasn’t getting out alive. He sat, smelling the smoke, watching the fire eat up the building and everything in it, pleased with what he’d done. In love with it, as Caleb put it. In love with the high that came of having power over another person’s life that way, and of their death.

Every couple of months Frankie would slip out by night and move in on a new target. Over time he’d developed what he called ‘fire traps’, a way of roughly timing the ignition so that he could be present when the call came through to the station. I’d been with him for many of those incidents, fought hard to get out every person caught in their burning homes unharmed.

I’d always thought Frankie had been just as dedicated, pushing forward against the flames to carry anyone he found to safety and crouching, silent, by himself for a good while afterwards when his efforts failed. Beating himself up over the tragedy, I’d always assumed; now I knew he’d been savoring it, committing the sight and smells of death to memory.

I grappled the urge to put my head between my knees and puke.

“I can’t fucking believe it,” I said. “I can’t believe this is real.”

Caleb looked at me with huge, dull eyes.

“It gets worse. I told Frankie I was going to hand him in. Made something up about him being caught by a security camera, there being enough footage and evidence to nail him— Hell, there probably is. I don’t know. I don’t know if I could have even gone through with sending him to jail. But I guess I convinced Frankie, because he got this look in his eyes. I can’t even describe it. So fucking cold and— smug.”

Caleb took a noisy swig of the beer, spilling part of it.

“I thought he’d run off somewhere,” he said. “Skip town maybe. But the last thing he said to me was how he wasn’t done with the fire traps. How he needed to see one work close up. Wanted to know how it’d feel. Then he left, and— well, you know how Frankie died.”

In a weak voice I said, “You’re saying he killed Jenny. Killed himself...”

“He did.”

Caleb and I watched each other from either side of the room, both of us flattened by the same weight.

“So why is he back?” I asked. “Is he just screwing with me, or—”

The pieces came together for me even before Caleb answered.

“I guess Frankie just wanted to set a few more fires,” he said, “just to see if he could.”




Though the only evidence I had was Caleb’s word I reported the arson to the police, or as much of it as I was able to, knowing I’d have no chance of blaming the latest rash of incidents on a ghost. In the cases where there was enough proof to support my claims the deaths were reclassified as murder, giving the surviving family members who’d always had a lingering sense of doubt over the loss some kind of closure.

As for myself, I never saw Frankie again, though I remained with the department for several years after that.

I had no way of telling if the haunting was over or if he kept on starting fires unseen the way he had before.

Some nights I’d stay up till morning trying to understand why Frankie had shown himself to Darrell and me, but in the end the closest I felt I got to the truth was the idea that he’d wanted his friends to know who he really was down to the blackened bones of him.
