I should’ve known at the start. The breeze blew too cold and the trees stared straight through me into the vast hills beyond. I was pretty sure this was the path, and stubborn as I was, then the path it must be. 

Looking back the signs were there but unnoticeable. A wiser person or perhaps someone more quick of mind might have parsed something was off sooner, but not before far too late. I’m certain of that now.

—————————————————————————        


The forest started to shiver. Trees were being  pushed here and there by gusts of wind as if their very roots shook. Gnarled tree limbs waved madly to their neighbors until quickly all fell silent. Large black clouds pulsed and groaned, dragging their way across the newly dark horizon snuffing out stars in their advance.


 Great blue lightning forked across the sky fracturing it once. And then again. And now repeatedly. Thunder rolled and rumbled like a slow motion metronome keeping time. This was taken as a sign by the rain to commence falling, it started dumping from the sky soon after. 


The path that lay ahead, an old forgotten trail made with mossy stone only added to the disquiet of the night. It looped around trees maniacally, disappeared from sight around bushes, led up hills and down valleys, through creek beds and under rocks. Whatever its purpose was if it ever had one is unknowable. With no other choice, I trudged on. 


My treacherous path lit only by the sparse glimpses of blue light shattering the night through dancing branches. After a while birds rejoined the chorus of the night. Harmonizing owls asking questions I could not  answer anymore. I might’ve been walking for an hour or two, or hell even ten, when I found the cave.


 The noises from inside… I don’t know why I followed, maybe it was the night driving me in, maybe it’s because I forgot who I was and why I was out there in the first place. But dear god I wish I never came in here. I’m hearing noises now… probably coyotes…. The screams are horrifying but it’s a full moon and I know coyotes live in this area. 


I’ve been praying for this rain to stop but if it doesn’t I plan to leave this cave tomorrow. I’m hearing noises in the night and I’m not sure if it’s real or not. I went deeper into the cave and kicked some piled up rocks into another chamber. There was sticks and bones tied with blood stained leather, it’s all wrong. Dear god the rain won’t stop… It’s real. 



I awoke to something of a sick joke, the mouth of the cave, the only exit, was now closed. At first i wailed, but eventually couldn’t help but laugh at the way the rocks seemed to form teeth closing my only hope of freedom, slight gaps of light between jagged shards of stone. In the night it’s different, I have less courage… Now the only way is down, I don’t like it down there. There’s noises coming from down there. 


That’s all I can describe them as. Noises, guttural raspy harsh noises. Inhuman noises. I’m crying as I write this, they’re terrifying and I don’t want to hear them anymore. Please, someone, anyone , stop this. If I could fit this through the “teeth” I would but we’ve since moved underground unfortunately. 


When theres no hope, laugh about it, if you can’t all that’s left is a shell of a man. I know I must go forward, through the “cave”, and I cannot. It’s my only choice and I still can’t make it. My eyes have adjusted to the dark. I wish they hadn’t.
