A strong sense of déjà vu washed over me as I followed the raven’s lead. The places I drove past felt eerily familiar, as if plucked straight from my dream, though the journey in reality felt far more longer. 

I drove for nearly two days straight, taking only brief naps along the way. 

Strangely, the raven seemed to sense when my exhaustion became unbearable and it would perch quietly on a nearby tree, waiting, as I rested. Then, when it was time to resume the journey, it would swoop near my car and let out a sudden, sharp caw, jolting me awake and back into motion.

After covering thousands of miles, I finally arrived at a small town that matched the vivid image from my dream. The raven guided me all the way to the house with the purple door, circling twice above it before flying off. 

The house was almost identical to what I had seen in my dream—the purple door, the neatly decorated foyer, and the tidy garden beside it. But one key detail was different - within the same compound stood another smaller building at the far end, like a guest house or quarters, with a "For Rent" sign hanging from its gate.

My heart raced as I sat in the car, staring at the purple door. 

None of this made any sense, yet here I was, in a strange little town, with no clue what to expect. 

*Who would open that door if I rang the bell? I silently thought to myself.*

 My mind spiraled with possibilities—half hoping, against all reason, that Ben would be the one to greet me, or fearing something far more sinister waiting behind it.

The more I thought, the more my nerves unraveled. 

Shaking off the chaos in my head, I grabbed the bag, stepped out of the car, and walked toward the entrance. 

With a deep breath, I rang the bell.

When the door opened, an older woman, likely in her late sixties, stood at the entrance with a curious expression on her face. 

She was of medium build and wore a floral gown that gave her an air of simple elegance. Her hair was neatly pinned back into a tidy bun, and large horn-rimmed glasses framed her inquisitive eyes.

"Yes?" she asked, her tone polite yet measured, as she peered at me through the thick lenses.

"Good evening, ma'am," I greeted her, with a small nod. "I'm Emily Moore. I happened to be passing through this town and noticed the 'For Rent' sign on your property." 

 "I'm traveling and was hoping you might consider renting the space to me for a short stay."

“Hello Emily, glad to meet you and please call me Martha,” she responded, breaking into a warm smile as I shook her hand. 

“ The guest house is certainly available for rent. How long are you planning to stay?” 

“I’m looking to stay for a month, maybe longer,” I replied, quickly fabricating a story about how I was conducting research on the local history and folklore of the town and its surrounding areas. 

She nodded thoughtfully, listening with genuine interest, before outlining the terms and conditions. After I paid a small advance, she disappeared inside to retrieve the keys and returned a few moments later, then led me to the guest house.

As we walked through the garden, I couldn’t help but admire the neat rows of vegetables that had been carefully planted, resembling a tiny market in its own right. 

Martha next inserted the key into the door and opened it, gesturing for me to enter.

The guest house, though small, was cozy and well maintained, offering all the essentials— a cot, kitchenette, attached bath, TV, and refrigerator. She placed the key in a bowl and wished me goodnight as she quietly closed the door behind me.

I set the Chanel bag on a nearby chair and sat down on the bed, just to momentarily rest my sore back. But the exhaustion immediately hit me like a tidal wave, and all I could think of was sleep. 

I removed the medallion from my pocket and set it on the bedside table, then lay down, drifting off into a deep, immediate slumber.

When I opened my eyes, I could sense that dawn had broken, but I remained motionless, unwilling to leave the warmth of the bed. 

Yet, something had jolted me from my sleep, and then I heard it again. 

A siren, distant at first, but growing louder and more urgent with every passing second. Panic surged through me, and I sat up, eyes darting around the room. Everything appeared normal, untouched, but the siren’s wail only intensified.

I rushed to the front door, trying to open it, but it was wedged tight, as though something was holding it shut from the outside. Desperate, I pushed through hard, managing just enough space to peek through. 

My heart stopped when I saw Martha lying on the ground, a pool of blood surrounding her.

I pushed the door with all my strength, and it finally gave way, causing Martha’s body to roll over the doorstep and into the garden. Stumbling out of the house, I watched in horror as her blood soaked into the soil. 

The sirens pierced the air as I stood motionless, waiting for fate to take its course, watching the compound fill with police cars, as officers spilled out of the vehicles, guns drawn.

My eyes snapped open again as I lay in bed, realizing I had just been jolted awake from yet another unsettling dream. 

 Before I could shake off the lingering shivers, I heard a knock on the front door.

I sat up straight, immediately pinching myself to ensure I wasn’t trapped in a dream within a dream. 

When the sting shot through me, I jumped out of bed and hurried to the door, my mind already racing with worry about what would happen next.

To my surprise and relief, I found Martha standing at the doorstep, smiling with a breakfast tray in hand.

“Good morning, Emily,” she greeted me warmly. “Sorry if I spooked you,” she added, noticing the look on my face. “I saw your car parked in the same spot since yesterday, and I wondered if you’d had anything decent to eat. So I thought I’d bring you something. Nothing fancy—just some stew made with our home grown produce and some hot coffee for you,” she said, extending the tray.

I accepted it gratefully, but my gaze drifted to a young man working in the garden—a boy about 16 or 17. The basket he held in hand was filled with tomatoes, carrots, lettuce, cucumbers, zucchini, and  bell peppers. Martha noticed my look and immediately explained.

“This is Alex, one of my neighbors. He’s a strong young man with a good head on his shoulders. He likes to help an old lady like me out,” she said with a fond smile. The young boy raised his hat at me before getting back to work.

“Thank you so much for this, Martha. I’m famished, I won’t lie,” I said finally to Martha as I held the tray.

She gave me a knowing smile and turned to head back to her house, but paused before looking back at me. 

“Tell you what, why don’t you join me for lunch later today? I know you haven’t had time to set up yet. Please, come by my place. Anytime after 1 is fine. And I am not taking no for an answer. Great, that’s settled then” She gave me a final smile before continuing her walk, leaving me stranded at the doorway before I even had the time to respond. 

I closed the door and set the tray on the bed, my gaze immediately drawn to the medallion on the table. So much had happened in the last five minutes, and it was all making my head spin.

After what happened at the bank, I didn’t want anyone else getting hurt, especially not ending up dead—much less bringing the police into my life again. 

Just the thought of it made my stomach twist, and I considered packing up and moving immediately.  

But something inside me kept me rooted. 

Maybe I was where I was supposed to be. After all, the raven led me here, to this town, and perhaps even to this house. Maybe, just maybe, I could pick up something on Ben. 

Then the image of the abandoned lighthouse flashed in my mind, and I wondered why I hadn’t passed it during my drive. 

It was the first thing that flashed in my mind when I came to this town in my dream. So I had to check it out, see if anything stood out, and then slip away quietly before anything went wrong.

Meanwhile the first spoonful of stew was heavenly. I couldn’t tell if it was Martha’s cooking or simply the fact that I hadn’t eaten properly in days, but it was pure bliss nevertheless. It just seemed to melt in my mouth and was easily the best thing I’d tasted in ages. I devoured the rest quickly, and washed it down with the hot coffee.

Afterward, I showered and dressed, then searched online for any nearby lighthouses. I found one just a few miles away. Before leaving, I hid my bag full of money in the lowest rack of the bedroom closet. I got into my car and followed the coordinates. It didn’t take long before I found it—and it was exactly as I had seen it in my vision.

An old, derelict building in ruins stood ahead, surrounded by a dense thicket of shrubs and overgrown plants. If Ben were here, this would undoubtedly be the kind of place he’d choose to hide.

Stepping out of my vehicle, my eyes caught a tarp partially visible through the foliage. I pushed through the underbrush and uncovered a Honda Civic, its surface thick with dust and grime, clearly untouched for weeks. The location felt odd—an unusual and deliberate place to park a car.

I turned my attention to the lighthouse next, pushing open the door and climbing the rickety stairs to the top.

There was a small, rundown cabin up there, and as I entered, I immediately noticed Ben’s watch and the boots he’d worn the day we parted ways. 

Around them were also empty cans of food, milk cartons, and a bowl that still smelled faintly of sour milk.

 But what truly made my skin crawl was the pile of snake skin in the corner, dried and crumpled, possibly remnants of a shedding.

Across the room, a small wooden cupboard stood with its door slightly ajar. I opened it fully and noticed a loose floorboard underneath. 

When I pried it open, I found Ben’s cell phone beneath, its display cracked, and his Colt Python revolver resting beside it—the gun he always carried. A chill ran through me as the weight of the discovery sank in.

On one hand, I was relieved to finally be getting answers about his disappearance, which had been bothering me for weeks. On the other, a growing sense of worry began to settle in, as it only raised more questions about his safety.

*Where is he now? Why did he leave his stuff here? Why did he come to this town like me in the first place? Is he still continuing to hang around this town? Or is the medallion in its own way trying to unite the two of us back together?* 

*But is he still even alive in the first place?*

My heart ached when I considered the last possibility.

 Looking around the cabin, it was clear he hadn't returned here in a while. 

 The cellphone was dead and gone. So I picked the revolver, stuffed it into the small of my back and made my way back to the car. 

As I started my drive back to the guest house, my mind quickly flashed back to the event at the pawn shop a few months back. 

“Elise… Elise… ELISE!” Ben’s voice had echoed through the store, startling me. I turned to see him standing frozen, his face a mix of horror and subtle amusement. 

His eyes darted between my face and my hands, and when I followed his gaze, I froze.

I was holding both medallions—one ruby-encrusted, the other emerald-encrusted. 

I didn’t even remember picking them up. Mesmerized, I simply stood there, oblivious to the store assistant’s warnings, clutching the auric seals of Teotihuacan. 

The emerald medallion, in particular, burned itself into my memory. It featured a serpent coiled around an hourglass—a detail that now struck me as disturbingly significant.

Then the memory blurred again.  One moment I was inside the store, and the next, I was sprinting outside with both medallions clutched tightly in my hands. 

In no time, the cops were in hot pursuit, with Ben desperately trying to outrace them.

“I’ll draw them away,” he finally said, as he pulled over near an underground tunnel, urging me to escape on foot. 

I hesitated, but as he kissed me goodbye, I shoved the emerald medallion into his hand, silently praying he’d make it. I watched as he sped off, the sirens growing louder in the distance.

Now, back in the present, as I made my way to Martha’s home, a hundred things were going on in my head. The revolver in the small of my back, the snake skin in the lighthouse cabin, and the medallions—all of it felt like pieces of a puzzle I wasn’t sure I wanted to solve.

Upon reaching the guest house, I quickly opened the bedroom closet and placed the revolver in the bag, but kept the zip open so that I could reach for it at a moment's notice. But I kept the ruby medallion in my pocket. After freshening up, I left to meet Martha for lunch.

When I rang the doorbell, Alex greeted me at the door, dressed in an apron and ushered me inside. 

“Martha’s still in the kitchen,” he said, leading me to the living room.

From somewhere in the house, Martha’s cheerful voice called out, “I’m almost done, dear! Just a minute—make yourself at home.”

I sank into a cozy couch and glanced around the room. The house was modest yet inviting, and decorated with care.

A large TV dominated the center wall, with a single armchair angled toward it. The setup suggested quiet evenings spent alone.

 On one of the other walls were framed photographs, some featuring Martha alongside a man of similar age, their smiles frozen in happier times.

“That’s Henry, my husband,” Martha said from behind me, her voice soft but steady. I turned to see her pointing at one of the photos. “He passed away five years ago,” she added, as she served me a glass of iced tea.

Martha then took the seat across from me and we chatted about small, mundane stuff. When the moment felt right, I showed her Ben's photo and casually asked if she'd seen him, keeping my tone light to avoid suspicion.

She shook her head, frowning slightly. “No, dear. No one’s stayed at my guest house for quite some time. We don’t get many visitors around here,” she replied.

We spoke a bit more before she suggested we start lunch. 

By then, Alex had already set the table, arranging an inviting spread: roasted chicken, green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, and a freshly baked apple pie. The aroma filled the room, making my stomach growl in anticipation.

“What will I do when you leave, kiddo?” Martha said, looking at Alex with a fond, wistful expression. “Our boy here will be heading off to Harvard this summer on a full scholarship to study law,” she added, turning to me, her voice filled with pride.

As we sat down, Martha served the food, moving deftly across the platters. The meal was as delicious as it looked, and the conversation flowed easily.

Then, as Martha reached across the table for more potatoes, something glinted at her neck.

I froze. The emerald medallion swung from a gold chain around her throat - its distinctive serpent coiling around an hourglass—impossible to miss.

My stomach clenched as my mind began to race.

Martha, even as she noticed the color draining from my face, calmly spooned more mashed potatoes onto her plate, her expression serene and almost nonchalant. Alex remained engrossed in his meal, while I shifted nervously in my seat. 

The food in my mouth no longer tasted as good, and was stuck at the back of my throat as I struggled to swallow, causing me to suddenly erupt into a coughing fit. As I tried to reach for my glass of water,my hand knocked it over sending it crashing to the floor. 

“Alex, why don’t you bring Emily another glass?” Martha intervened, gesturing toward the kitchen.

Before Alex could react, I stood up quickly, raising a hand to stop him. “I’ll get it,” I said, my voice abrupt.

I needed a moment away from them, away from the room.

In the kitchen, I gripped the counter, steadying myself as I reached for a glass. That’s when I heard it—clear and unmistakable.

“Elise… Elise… ELISE!”

The voice sent a jolt through me. It was Ben. It was Ben’s voice. My heart raced as I turned toward the hall.

The television, which had been off moments ago, was now turned on. A grainy video played on the screen, displaying security footage from the pawn shop.

My legs moved on their own, carrying me back into the living room where I collapsed into a chair, my knees almost giving away.

On the screen, the footage played like a nightmare brought to life.

There I was, standing in the shop, holding the medallions in both hands, my eyes locked in a daze, wild with desire as Ben started to speak louder and louder trying to get my attention. 

The shop assistant, Pete, looked alarmed, gesturing for me with his hands to put the medallions down.

But I ignored them both, my grip tightening as I stared at the medallions, mesmerized.

It wasn’t until Ben placed a firm hand on my shoulder and gave me a hard shake that I finally broke free from the spell.

Reluctantly, I set the medallions back on the tray, my fingers hesitating as if they didn’t want to let go.

When I turned to look at Ben, his expression was a curious mix of amusement and quiet resolve. 

But I knew him too well—behind that facade was the man I had fallen in love with, someone would do anything to give me what I wanted.

Even before he spoke, I could see it in his eyes. I knew exactly what he was about to do as he turned to face Pete.

“Okay. I think I’d like to buy these. What’s it going to cost?” he asked, looking at Pete.

Pete, already visibly annoyed, scoffed. “Oh, come on, Ben. I’m not in the mood for this. Just last month, you came here to sell your ring because you were short on cash.”

“I mean it,” Ben pressed, his voice unwavering. “I want to buy them. I don’t care if they’re cursed. Tell me what it’s going to cost.”

Pete glared at him, exasperated, before finally spitting out, “Three hundred thousand dollars.” His tone dripped with disdain as he eyed the two of us, clearly expecting Ben to back down.

I nudged Ben urgently, whispering that it was time to leave, but the air between the two men crackled with tension. As Pete moved to return the tray to its place, Ben and I turned eventually to leave the store—then he stopped abruptly.

What happened next was something I could never fully understand or admit to myself even after all these months. 

Ben’s face went cold, his expression vacant, like he’d fallen into a trance of his own. Without a word, he drew his revolver and fired.

The deafening shot echoed through the shop as Pete crumpled to the floor, lifeless. I gasped, my hands instinctively covering my mouth in shock.

Ben had always carried a firearm, but he wasn’t the kind of man to shoot first. He was not the trigger happy sort. In fact he had never aimed that weapon at another person before until that point. But now he stood motionless, his face unreadable.

“Pick up the medallions,” he said finally, his voice sharp and commanding.

Still in shock, I did as told, and together, we fled the shop, the medallions clutched tightly in my grasp.

The video suddenly came to a stop as the TV screen went blank. 

Except for the sound of my own breathing, the room fell silent and the silence became suffocating as I felt two pairs of eyes looking straight at me,waiting patiently for me to react. 

Summoning what little courage I had left, I forced myself to meet Martha's gaze. Her eyes were unwavering, cold and accusing, while her fingers absently fidgeted with the chain around her neck.

"My son, my only child is dead because of you," she said, her voice steady but quivering with restrained emotion. "My flesh and blood. He was all I had left in this world, and you took him from me."

"And all for what? For this?"

She lifted the medallion from her neck, its emerald surface faintly gleaming in the dim light. Her face twisted with grief and contempt as I sat frozen, guilt tightening around my chest, making me unable to respond.

"You came all this way looking for your boyfriend, didn’t you? So take it. Find out for yourself."

Her words chilled me, but I slowly extended my  hand, picking up the medallion. The moment my fingers closed around it, a sharp, searing pain shot through my head, blurring my vision. My head snapped back as a vivid, horrifying vision unfolded before me.

Ben appeared, his face breaking into a smile as he looked down where a serpent lay coiled on the floor with its hood up. He poured milk into a shallow bowl, and the snake drank from it. The scene quickly shifted—Ben was now driving his car, the serpent wrapped around his arm. Each time the snake raised its hood, pointing left or right, Ben followed its silent command, turning the steering wheel accordingly.

The vision morphed again, this time to Martha's home. She sat on her couch, tears streaming down her face as she watched the security footage of her son’s murder on an endless loop. The sound of a doorbell broke her from her misery, and she opened the door to find Ben standing there, smiling as he introduced himself.

I gasped as the vision ended, my body jerking back so suddenly that my head throbbed painfully. My temples pulsed as though they might split open.

Then, the scene shifted again—Ben was lying on the floor, clutching his throat, foaming at the mouth, while Martha stood over him, holding a half-consumed glass of iced tea.

At the same time, I felt something physically wrong with me as well. My body burned, like a violent fever was overtaking me. Blood trickled from my nostrils and mouth, and it dawned on me—I had been poisoned, too. My mind flashed to the drink Martha had given me before the meal.

Dazed, I tried to rise from my seat, but my legs gave way, sending me crashing to the floor.

Alex rushed forward, steadying me with his hands as I struggled to stay conscious.

The moment his hands touched me, another vision surged through my mind with brutal force. 

Alex stood in Martha’s living room, a cleaver glinting in his grasp. The blade arced through the air and came down with horrifying precision, striking Ben several times, who already lay lifeless on the floor. 

The scene shifted again—Alex, burying Ben’s remains in shallow graves dug in the barren patch beside the house. Days flickered by as Alex and Martha worked side by side, planting seeds in the freshly turned soil. Weeks blurred together, and the once-empty patch became a lush garden. The plants thrived, nourished by the horror buried beneath.

The realization hit me like a truck: they had used those very vegetables from that garden to feed me. My stomach churned violently as the nausea overwhelmed me. Staggering to my feet, I bolted for the door, desperate for air.

I stumbled into the garden, gulping in deep breaths, but the moment I took in my surroundings, the nausea returned with full force. 

Doubling over, I retched, vomiting up the food I had just eaten, my body rejecting the horrifying truth.

When I turned back toward the house, Martha was standing there, watching me with a cold stare. Behind her, Alex loomed, clutching a large knife in his hand.

“Finish it,” she said, her voice steady and without remorse, as though this were a task no different from any other chore.

Panic surged through me as I fought my failing body from losing consiousness. I threw both my medallions to the floor, staggered to my feet, and rushed toward the guesthouse, instinct pulling me toward the closet where I’d hidden Ben’s revolver. 

As I reached the closet , my hands trembled as I fumbled with the handle, throwing the door open. 

A wave of relief washed over me when I saw the gun still lying there.

But my relief was short-lived. 

Coiled inside the cupboard, hidden among the shadows, was the serpent. Its eyes glinted in the dim light before it lunged, sinking its fangs deep into my throat.

Pain erupted like fire, spreading rapidly through my veins. My body seized as the venom took hold, the strength draining from my limbs. The gun slipped from my grasp and clattered to the floor.

 Darkness crept in at the edges of my vision, and I collapsed, the world fading as my consciousness slipped away.

When I woke, I had no sense of how much time had passed. My body felt light, as if it had been restored to full health, as though I'd been reborn. 

Ben's revolver lay beside me, cold and waiting. I picked it up and stepped out cautiously, only to freeze at the sight before me.

Martha was lying face down in the grass, her throat slit, a crimson pool spreading beneath her. Nearby, Alex stood motionless, his expression distant, as though caught in a trance. In his hand, he gripped a bloodied knife.

As I emerged, his eyes flickered to me, and he dropped to one knee. “Your Highness,” he murmured, holding the knife aloft like an offering to royalty.

 My eyes however darted between the raven and the serpent lying still in the grass, their unblinking eyes locked on me, and the two medallions glinting on the ground between them. 

Then, piercing through the suffocating silence, came the sound of sirens in the distance.

“What is happening?” I demanded, my voice trembling.

Alex’s gaze remained fixed on the ground. “It is the police,” he replied evenly. “I called them.”

“But why?” I asked, unable to hide my exasperation. 

“You must make a choice, Your Highness,” he said, his voice calm yet unyielding. “The medallions represent the future and the past. When you touched them for the first time, you became the natural custodian of the Auric Seals of Teotihuacan.”

His words sent a chill down my spine. “What does that mean?” I slowly asked.

“The medallions cannot be apart for long. They will always find a way back to one another, no matter the cost—through whatever means necessary. ”

“ You hold the power now to decide how this story unfolds”

The sirens grew louder, closer, like a ticking clock urging me toward a decision.

“Pick up the medallions, Your Highness,” Alex said, his tone commanding yet reverent.

I hesitated before reaching down. My fingers brushed the emerald-studded medallion, and a sharp pain shot through my forehead. A vision erupted in my mind—a harrowing glimpse of what was to come. I saw myself sitting on the grass, having abandoned the medallions and waiting for the police to arrive. Alex’s face, once composed, twisted into something unrecognizable. Without warning, he lunged at me, plunging the knife into my chest. The pain was visceral, and even within the vision, it left me gasping. I shuddered as the image dissolved.

My trembling hand moved to the ruby medallion. As I grasped it, another vision surged forward. This time, I saw myself running—driving away from the chaos as Alex charged toward the police, putting himself in harm's way in a desperate bid to buy me time. The visions faded, leaving me breathless and shaking. 

“Have you made your choice, Your Highness?” Alex asked a moment later, his voice steady but his gaze firmly fixed on the ground.

I swallowed hard, nodding.

“Then give me the gun,” he said softly, extending his hand.

Reluctantly, I placed the revolver in his palm. Alex bowed once, solemn and final, before turning and sprinting toward the approaching sirens. 

Shots rang out almost immediately as he fired at the sky before aiming his gun at the vehicles arriving in front of him. 

I stumbled toward my car, the medallions clutched tightly in my hands. The serpent slithered onto the passenger seat, coiling itself with an eerie calm. 

Overhead, the raven soared, charting a path forward as if guiding my escape. 

I started the engine, the tires screeching as the car surged forward,  speeding away just as a firefight ignited in the backdrop. 

The road stretched ahead, an uncertain future waiting to unfold.
