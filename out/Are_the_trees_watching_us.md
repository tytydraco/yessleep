I’ve heard of a place, a so-called Forest of Fears, and decided that it would be our next hiking destination. Carl, Petra and I loved hiking, and this place was said to be filled with mystery. I had heard whispers about it from locals—stories that it fed on the fears of humanity. We thought it was all just an urban legend designed to keep people away, to protect the forest from government influence, or so we thought.

The forest had a name, but we’ll just call it The Forest of Fears for now. The rumors said that strange things happened there, and I wasn’t sure what to believe. Still, the allure of something unexplained drew us in. We started our hike, laughing and joking, dismissing the stories as just that—stories.

It wasn’t long before Petra noticed something strange. She pointed at the trees and said,

"Look, there’s a pattern. Faces... faces in the bark."

I laughed, ever so skeptic.

"It’s just pareidolia," I told her, explaining the phenomenon: the brain’s tendency to see familiar patterns, like faces, in random shapes. "Nothing more."

Petra wasn’t convinced, but Carl decided to take a picture to shake off the creeping unease we were all starting to feel. He grinned, holding up the phone, and we posed.

"Wait, look at this..." he said, sounding rather terrified.

"The expression on one of the faces in the tree had... changed, it now looked like it was smiling."

But when we checked the tree ourselves, it appeared unchanged.

“Stop it, Carl. This place is already creepy enough. You don’t need to scare us further,” I told him, trying to dismiss the unease crawling up my spine.

But as we ventured deeper into the forest, the faces became more detailed, more humanoid. We still tried to brush it off, telling ourselves it was all in our heads, until something caught Petra’s attention.

“Do you see that?” Petra whispered, pointing to a vague figure in the distance.

I turned and froze.

The figure resembled Petra’s little sister, who had passed away long ago due to illness. It was distant, too vague to make out clearly, but the shape—her shape—was unmistakable. And then we heard it—a faint, childish laugh.

Before we could react, the figure bolted into the forest. Petra tried to chase after her, but we grabbed her.

“No, Petra! We need to go back. It’s getting dark, and those stories... maybe they weren’t just legends,” I said, trying to calm her down.

We started heading back, but something was wrong. The forest felt alive, almost as if it were shifting, changing around us and even watching us. The path had vanished. The trees seemed to move, blocking our way. We couldn’t go back.

And then I saw it.

A vague figure in the distance, standing tall among the trees. My heart sank. It was my father—my abusive father. He was massive, his form feeding off my deepest fear: the fear of losing control.

"You can't hide behind your mother now," his voice boomed, sending a cold chill through me.

Petra and Carl saw it too. We couldn’t stay. We turned and ran, faster than we’d ever run before, but the forest only grew denser, the trees closing in. The panic set in, and we realized we were lost.

In our haste, we lost Petra. She was gone, vanished into the trees. The forest seemed to swallow her whole, and the fear that had been creeping at the edges of my mind began to intensify.

Carl's breathing became erratic. He stopped running, his face pale, his eyes wide. He was frozen for a moment, and then he started to shake.

"She's gone... she's really gone... I can't... I can’t lose anyone else."

I turned back to him, trying to hold it together. I could see the panic in his eyes, and it made my own heart race. Carl had always feared losing people dear to him. It had always been his biggest fear—losing someone close. I’d never seen him so terrified before.

I grabbed his arm, trying to steady him.

"CARL, CALM DOWN. She can’t be too far away. We’ll find her. Just stay with me."

He shook his head, his body trembling.

"I—I can’t... What if she’s gone for good?"

 The dread in his voice was overwhelming. I pulled his hand yelling "we will find her!" and then we continued running, screaming out her name, but there were no signs of her.

And then, we stumbled upon it.

An enormous tree loomed in front of us, its bark twisted and deformed. The face that stared out from it wasn’t just any face—it was Petra’s. Her face, contorted in fear, was etched into the tree’s trunk, distorted and warped by whatever dark force was at work in the Fearwood.

We stared at the grotesque image of Petra, but then, I felt a cold hand grab my shoulder from behind. I froze, a shiver running down my spine. That touch... I’d felt it before. It was familiar, a voice I thought I’d left behind long ago—my father’s voice.

Before I could react, the tree before us seemed to shift. The bark rippled, and there, next to Petra’s face, was my own. My face—twisted, contorted by fear—right next to my best friend’s.

At that moment, I knew. The Fearwood had claimed us too. We weren’t leaving, and our faces were left to be seen by the very next curious hikers.
