We used to be a happy family—my brother, my mom, and me. My mother is a single mom; she raised us both and was always there for us. But now, things have changed drastically. The change started after my brother got his job, and because of his job, we had to move to a new house.

My brother works in the General Surgery department, so he usually has a hectic schedule. He doesn’t get much time at home—he just comes in and sleeps. I work from home, so I began noticing strange behavior in my mother. I tried to tell my brother that something was off about Mom’s behavior, but he brushed it off, saying I was overthinking. But I wasn’t

When we first moved into that new house, everything seemed fine at first. But there was something about the place that didn’t feel right—something felt off. Still, I just brushed it aside. That night, when I went to sleep, I started hearing strange voices—like someone was talking… maybe even arguing. It sounded like two people yelling, and it was coming from my mother’s room.

I knocked on her door. No reply. I knocked again. Still no reply. On the third knock, I finally heard a response—but it was a harsh, terrifying voice shouting, “Go to sleep, now!” It didn’t even sound like my mom. It was the first time she ever yelled at me like that. I didn’t understand why. Thinking about it, I eventually drifted off to sleep.

The next morning, I planned to talk to my brother, but he had already left for the hospital. As I sat down for breakfast, I noticed my mom had given me a glass of milk. But I’m lactose intolerant. I told her this, and she just said, “I think I’m forgetting things as I get older.” That felt strange. That night, there were no sounds coming from her room. I figured maybe she had just been stressed the night before, and I went to sleep.


Suddenly, I woke up in the middle of the night to find my mother standing by my bed, staring at me… smiling. But it was a creepy smile. I asked her, “What happened?” but she didn’t reply. She just kept staring, then turned and walked back to her room. I was literally terrified.

The next night, I saw her go into the kitchen. What I saw shook me—she was eating uncooked chicken, her mouth full of raw meat, laughing like a maniac. I thought she had lost her mind. I told my brother everything. This time, he believed me. He said a psychiatrist would come the next day and asked me to manage for one more night. Then he left for the hospital, leaving me alone.
At this point, I couldn’t even sleep. I felt like someone had opened my room door and walked in. It was my mom. She looked at me—and started choking me. I somehow managed to break free and ran out of the room. She chased me. I ran to the kitchen and grabbed a knife to defend myself.
Then… I saw her face.

It wasn’t normal—it was distorted, like she had no muscles… just slime. She was coming closer and closer. I wanted to run, but my body froze. I was terrified. But I gathered every ounce of courage and tried to run. Just as I turned, she grabbed me. She opened her mouth—and it was filled with fingers. I pushed her away and stabbed her with the knife. I tried to run again, but she grabbed my leg.

In the chaos, as I backed into the stove trying to keep distance, my elbow hit something hard.
Click.
I didn’t realize it then, but I had knocked one of the gas knobs open.

The soft hiss of gas began filling the room—silent, invisible, deadly.

I was breathing heavily, tears mixing with sweat, trying to stay alert. I reached for the matchbox on the counter. The lights were flickering again, and I needed to see where she had gone. With shaking fingers, I struck a match.

The flame flared to life.

And then—BOOM.

A blinding burst of fire exploded in front of me. The gas had ignited instantly. The curtains by the window caught first, then the wooden shelves, and within seconds, the entire kitchen was an inferno.

I fell to the floor, disoriented. Heat blasted across my face as smoke began to pour through the room. But I didn’t stop. I couldn’t. I had to survive.

I heard her scream
I didn’t look back. I just ran.

The flames were roaring behind me, and the heat was unbearable. But as I raced toward the door, something went wrong—I was trapped too. The smoke grew thicker, my vision blurred, my lungs burned. I couldn’t find the exit.

I was caught in the fire.

I stumbled, fell to my knees, coughing uncontrollably. My limbs felt heavy. Everything started to fade... until suddenly, in the distance—I saw flashing red lights.

A firetruck.

Someone had come. I don’t know who pulled me out… or how. All I remember is strong arms lifting me, dragging me out of the blaze. Then—darkness.

When I opened my eyes again, I was in a hospital room.

And there he was—my brother. As soon as I saw him, I broke down crying. Everything I had kept inside—the fear, the confusion, the horror—it all came pouring out.

But then… something froze me.

Standing next to him… was my mother.

Perfectly fine.

Not a scratch on her. Smiling. Calm. Normal. As if none of it had ever happened.

I stared at her, my heart pounding .

Was she real? Was it all in my head? Had I gone mad?

Now, the doctors are saying they’ll discharge me today. They’re calling it stress, hallucination, exhaustion. They say I should rest.

But I don’t want to go home.

I can’t go home.

Please… someone help me.
