That was the sign I saw when I turned onto old Country Ave.

**STAY ALERT**

**Children Walking on Roadway**

It was accompanied by the silhouette of a child kicking a ball. I paused for a second, staring at the sign. *Isn’t it usually SLOW: Children At Play?*

The sign was old, the fluorescent yellow paint cracking around the edges. There weren’t many houses on Country Ave. anymore, not since the town had condemned several of the structures. Flattened piles of rubble were all that were left. I hadn’t been on the road in years, but that’s what I heard from Jackie. Were there still actually children playing on this road?

I walked up the hill, my heart pumping, my legs aching. Usually I wouldn’t take my morning walk on this road, but I wanted to take an extra-long walk to compensate for all the cake last night. Country Road went straight up a hill, at a 30 or 40-degree angle, and wove around the trees and boulders like a drunk snake.

I crested the hill—and that’s when I saw the next sign.

**STAY ALERT**

**Do Not Speak To Children**

I stopped, frowning at the sign. Um, okay? Was that because of a kidnapping incident or something? Or possibly children with cognitive difficulties or social anxiety? I stared at the silhouette drawing under the warning. It was an adult with their hands over their mouth. 

*Weird.*

I continued walking. The road had flattened out a bit, now, and one of the razed structures was on my right. Just a gap in the trees, now, with some wooden slabs and chunks of concrete on the forest floor.

In a few months, I bet you wouldn’t even be able to tell a structure was there, as the crawling vines and brambles engulfed it.

I went around another crook in the road—and there was another sign.

This one was different. It was white, with no drawings—just text. And it looked new. It wasn’t peeling and dirty like the other signs, and I noticed fresh dirt along the bottom, as if it had just been erected days ago.

The text it held, however, was terrifying.

**IF YOU TRAVEL BEYOND THIS POINT, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COST OF YOUR SEARCH AND RESCUE**

There was nothing immediately dangerous beyond the sign. Just the road, which had straightened out, cutting through the forest. And one more sign, several yards ahead—a standard **SLOW: Children Crossing** sign. Like the type they put up around schools.

*Is it dangerous because of all the construction?*

*Maybe they put it up when they were demolishing all the houses…*

Either way, I wasn’t going to screw around with the law. I turned around, to head back—

And my breath caught in my throat.

There was a child behind me. Peeking out from around a tree. As soon as I turned, she was already darting out of sight.

My heart dropped.

*What… the fuck?*

I almost called out a hello—just to announce my presence, to maybe scare her—but then I remembered the sign. *Do not speak to children.* I took a deep breath and started walking back down the road, towards home. It meant I would pass the kid, but I had to get out of here somehow.

*Snap.*

I whipped around.

*No.*

Several yards behind me, at the *children crossing* sign, there was a line of children. They stood in the street, holding hands, stretching across the entire width of the street. Boys and girls, maybe eight or so. Wearing old-style clothing, jumpers and dresses, overalls and button-down shirts.

*What the…?*

*I have to get out of here.*

I picked up my pace. I could see the little girl’s hands poking around the trunk to my left. She was still hiding there. *Waiting for me?*

I picked up the pace.

Her fingers… they were so pale. Grayish. Wrinkled and pruny like she’d spent too much time in the bath or at the pool.

*Fuck this.*

I broke into a sprint.

I could hear voices singing behind me. Children’s voices. Singing *row, row, row your boat* but too slow, slightly off key. The tree approached—I kept my eyes on the road—

But I could see her in the corner of my eye.

There was something *horribly* wrong with her face.

Her eyes were dark, empty pits. Her mouth was stretched into a wide, open grin, revealing pointed, needle-like teeth. Her skin was grayish green, her dress frayed and faded—

I broke into a faster run. My feet slapped painfully on the pavement. Running downhill, I felt like I might suddenly trip and fly down the rest of the hill. Every step felt off-balance. But eventually I was at the bottom, at Main Street. I ran onto the sidewalk and stopped, gasping for breath.

A passerby asked me if I was okay.

“Don’t… don’t go on that road,” I choked out, pointing behind me.

Eventually, I had the courage to turn around. For a moment, I saw the tip of a red sneaker poking out from behind the tree next to the sign for Country Rd.

Then it was gone.

And I was, thankfully, [alone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)
