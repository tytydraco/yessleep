Our first “adventure” began about as weird as you’d expect, we had to track down according to B a cat, getting ahead of myself here though.

When I shook his hand at the hospital all my wounds seemed to heal which seemed crazy at first but then thinking about the fact I just survived an attack from a giant dog thing can’t say I was too surprised.

After we got into his old impala and starting driving towards Georgia, he looked at me slightly puzzled and said “Mr.Beck?, you know usually people would have many many questions about what’s going on, but you don’t seem to have many, why?

Taken a back I paused to think on the question, “well I always figured there was more out there I guess?, I don’t know why to be honest just seems like if I’m the only one who can see like you, that you’ve met then it’s safe to say this is probably where I’m intended/needed to be”

He just smirked and kept driving, but I couldn’t help but feel he knows more then his questions suggest, once we reached our location he turned and starred almost in a expecting way, before I said “what?”, and finally saying what’s been on my mind “why does it seem like you know something I don’t in our situation?” He laughed and said “come on, not much time now” and left the vehicle.

Following him we approach a huge medieval looking church, opening the old creeky door I say “are you not gonna tell me why we’re here?” In an annoyed voice 

“We’ll I don’t really know, won’t know what’s causing the problem until we find it”

I said “so im expected to do this job not knowing what I’ll need or what I’m doing/going up against?” With a puzzled and frustrated look

“Yup” he said smirking as he walked through the old building

The inside looked about as old as the outside, old but fancy, the room you walk into is huge with stairs straight ahead and a door way to the left leading to the kitchen area and the right leading to the main room with all the chairs and a stage for the pastor.

“Creepy looking” I muttered as we walked towards the stairwell 

Going up B started to whistle some strange toon that sounds familiar to farmer and the dog or hare who knows; as we approached the top we heard someone finish the whistle in another room

Startled a look at b, smirking he says “atleast we know it’s atleast semi human”

“How so?” I say confusingly

“What animal besides a parrot do you know that can whistle while also finishing the tune before I did?, also it proves they have some sort of consciousness”

Now I’m not expert in the matter but what he said kinda makes sense, how or why would a monster or beastly creature whistle back and not just attack? Anyways B walked up and around the corner with so much confidence it’s honestly kinda intimidating, like we still have no clue what this thing could be

Once I turn the corner I see B entering the room at the end of the hall, sprinting towards the door I slam through to see B and a women just standing and now staring at me

With a puzzled look I ask
“So no monster?”

B said “yea I’m still not sure man but nice to see you care” with a half hearted chuckle

“Fuck you” I murmur smirkingly

“I’m not a monster” the pretty but almost skeleton like women said 

“To be decided” b said “but for now you’re coming with us”

Well shit sorry guys I’ll have to continue writing the story when I have time, the cafe were at is starting to close, gotta stay on the move, see y’all soon sorry for the to be continued and will update when things calm down a little.
