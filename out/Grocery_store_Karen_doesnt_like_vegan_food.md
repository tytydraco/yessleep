I was at my local grocery (large chain franchise) picking up some vegan beef patties for a bbq I was throwing for the neighborhood. I really didn’t know much about these products, but I wanted there to be options since I wasn’t sure who would be attending (I had an open invitation posted in the neighborhood chat). I decided to just pick up 3 or 4 different brands of burger patties to be on the safe side. 

A blonde woman with shortish hair was walking past and noticed what I had in my cart. It would seem she took umbrage with my choices. “You should just eat meat if your going to buy things that taste like meat” she said to me with scorn in her voice. “I do eat meat, I just want those who don’t to feel welcome at my bbq” I responded with as much sincerity as I could muster. 

What Karen and I had failed to notice in our conversation was the pack of service dogs gathering at both ends of the freezer isle. We became aware very quickly though when they started closing in, growling menacingly. Immediately the Karen started shrieking for a manager. The officially envested pack was not impressed, in fact I think her shrill voice only enraged the dogs. 

They all charged at once. I jumped into the freezer and slammed the door shut. Karen jumped up into my cart. She tore open a pack of burger patties and tried throwing them to the service dogs. After a sniff or two I suppose the patties were not incredible enough, because the dogs rejected Karens offering and commenced to jump up and pull her down from the cart. Meanwhile I was crawling along the bottom rack of the freezers until I was well past the dogs. I was at the part with the frozen turkeys when I went to make good my getaway. 

I couldn’t just leave the karen to her fate however, so I grabbed up a frozen turkey and bowled it down the isle with the force of a thunderbolt. The frozen turkey struck the dogs as they were all grouped up in their attack on karen, and it blew away about half of them. Somehow it made the same sound as a perfect strike at the bowling lane. The remainder of the dogs turned their attention toward me, their fur bristled in rage. 

While their backs were turned Karen snatched a couple frozen tomahawk cut steaks from the freezer and began duel wielding them against the dogs all the while screaming her warcry of “do you know who I am?”. 

After that I just ran from the scene and out of the store. I decided the local vegans would just have to make do with pasta salad this time. A few days later at the bbq I was shocked to see the very same Karen from the store perusing the food. I went to greet her and was met with “why aren’t their any vegan options here? I’m going to sue you for not making this inclusive to the meatally challenged”. I’ll update after the court hearing.
