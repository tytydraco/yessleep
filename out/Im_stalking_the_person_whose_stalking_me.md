It all started when I created a youtube channel. I named it after myself, “Avery Johnson” and set my profile picture to a photo I took in a forest that I visit often. You see, I had made this YouTube channel to document the lovely environment this forest has. Although, I don’t strive to be a professional YouTuber, I just wanted to keep a silent video diary of my adventures there. 

When the time came to shoot my first video, I drove to the park about an hour before sunset. Once I got my camera ready, I immediately started recording the path that I was walking down. It was beautiful and peaceful all at the same time. About 10 minutes into my recording, I stopped dead in my tracks, I saw something in the distance on my camera. Maybe another person roaming the forest. Out of curiosity, I zoomed in to see exactly what it was and what I saw shocked me. It was another person standing silently in the woods with a camera that was pointing directly towards me. 

I thought this might’ve been a coincidence or that I was blocking something they were trying to film, so I started walking forward, never letting the person go out of view from my camera. To my surprise, they kept moving their camera to point directly towards me. At that point, I was scared, so I started running, recording them the entire time from the other side of the forest. They were now running as well, doing the same thing. 

At that point, I stop focusing my camera on them and just run as fast as I can. When I finally made it out of the forest, I get in my car and drove straight home. My heart was pounding fast and I was paranoid the entire drive home that maybe the person who was filming me was following me. Luckily, I made it home safely. 

I ended up going to bed right away and didn’t wake up until next morning. As I was making my morning coffee, I reviewed the footage from my camera. It sent chills down my spine. At every point in the video, the person was stalking and recording me. Considering everything in mind, I decided to upload it onto my YouTube channel later that day. I wasn’t expecting major views or anything, but I wanted to share my experience even if only one other person saw it.

After I posted my video, I watched it all the way through to make sure there were no issues and then I clicked the back arrow to go to my channel page again. That’s when I saw it. It was another video on my channel. A video I never uploaded. It was called “SHE’S STALKING ME!” I felt sick to my stomach, but I clicked on it anyway. 

It was me, with a camera, recording the person in the forest. Everything that I had recorded except from their point of view. 

In the description, it read: “I’m Avery Johnson and this woman was stalking me.”
