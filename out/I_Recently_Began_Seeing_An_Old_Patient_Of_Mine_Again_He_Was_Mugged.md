TW: Mentions of drug abuse and self harm

***

“Well, Mr. King, it’s been quite a while since you’ve last been in that chair,” I said, greeting my two o’ clock appointment.

It’s always nice to meet with previous patients of mine, however there’s always a twinge of sadness to it. As a therapist, you never really want to see a familiar face sitting on the other side of your desk again.

The man sitting across from me chuckled lightly, sweeping some of his light brown hair out of his blue eyes. He readjusted himself in the chair. “Please, Dr. Morris, call me James.”

“Alright then, James,” I said, dropping the formality. Playfully I added, “It’s still Dr. Morris to you, though.”

“Alright, *Harrison*,” he quipped back with a sly smile. In response, I smiled and laughed.

Even though it’s been two years since I last saw James, he was still as charming as I remembered him to be.

“So,” he started, locking his hands together and leaning closer to me in his chair, “How’s the wife, doc? The kid?”

“I’m not paid to sit here and talk about myself, James. Let’s talk about what’s going on with you, shall we? Why are *you* here?”

“Okay, no time for small talk, I get that,” he mumbled.

I sat comfortably in my plush leather desk chair waiting for him to answer my question. A tense moment of silence passed. James’s cheerful mask slipped away, revealing a harder, more solemn expression.

He cleared his throat before he finally gave me an answer. “I- uh… I was mugged.”

“I’m sorry that you experienced that,” I apologized genuinely. “It must’ve been traumatizing.”

“It was,” was all he said.

“Do you want to talk about it, James? I’m assuming that’s why you scheduled an appointment with me after all?”

He nervously twiddled with his thumbs before giving me a very abridged version of events. “The boys and I were hanging out at my parents' cabin up in Mount Glenda. I went out for a late night walk and got attacked. Was in the hospital for a couple days. Now I’m here.”

“Do you remember much from the attack?” I questioned, noticing there weren’t any visible scratches or contusions on him. He was wearing black acid wash jeans and a button up flannel shirt, so it’s possible he was attempting to cover them up.

“I- I’d rather not recount that right now, if that’s alright with you, Dr. Morris.”

I nodded my head understandably. “Okay.”

James started picking at some skin on his fingers, a common nervous habit for him. “Thanks, doc. It’s still a little fresh to talk about.”

“It’s not a problem. We can talk about it whenever you’re ready, James.” Changing the topic, I asked, “So, how are things with you and Katie?”

James scrunched his eyelids closed and wrinkled his nose at the mention of her name. If an onlooker didn’t know any better, they’d say I’d just punched him in the face.

I frowned. “Last time you were here, you two were hitting it off pretty well. So well, in fact, you stopped scheduling sessions with me.”

“We broke up,” he admitted, messing with one of the cuffs on his red and white flannel sleeves. “That’s why we were up on Mount Glenda in the first place. My friends wanted to help cheer me up. Help me get over her.”

“Well that was nice of them,” I commented, writing down some observations I’d made. Given the way he avoided eye contact and became anxious while talking about the events that led up to his attack, a PTSD diagnosis was certainly in the cards after a violent experience such as a mugging. But, I needed to fully complete my evaluation before I could say anything was concrete.

“They had good intentions,” he grumbled.

“Why did you and Katie break up, if you don’t mind me asking? Was it amicable?”

James scoffed. “If by amicable, you mean she cheated and left me for the other guy, then yeah you can say it was amicable.”

“Mhm,” I muttered, taking more notes. “Want to talk about it?”

“What’s there to talk about?” James raised his voice slightly. “She cheated on me and we broke up!”

Clearly I’d struck a nerve. I cleared my throat and moved on. “Why don’t we talk about something else, then? How’s work at the diner? How are your courses going at university?”

“L-look, Dr. Morris, I don’t even know why I came here,”James laughed out breathlessly, starting to stand up from his chair. “I’m sorry for wasting your time.”

I stood up with James, gently placing my hand on one of his. He paused and I could see in his eyes he was hurting. I could sense he wanted someone to talk to. *Needed* someone to talk to.

“How about this, James, why don’t we end our session early today. Go home, drink a warm beverage, take a nap. Come see me next week. Friday, same time.”

James nodded his head, “Ok doc.”

I called out suddenly as he was about to walk out the door. “You can come back anytime before then. If you want to talk about it, I’m here for you James.”

James flashed me a weak smile before walking out of my office.

***

I was unsure if I’d see James again. He seemed to be teetering on the edge of a depressive episode the last time we spoke. It’s not easy to ask for help once a person passes that threshold. So, I was glad when I saw he had requested an emergency session with me just a couple days before his next scheduled appointment.

“I was attacked!” James exclaimed, rushing into my office. He was wearing a plain white t-shirt with a gray zip up jacket and a pair of blue jeans. Slung over his shoulder was a black backpack with a red stripe down the sides.

I disregarded his incredibly rude entrance and placed my phone face down on the desk. I adjusted my reading glasses and raised an eyebrow inquisitively.

“I know? You were mugged.”

“No. No, no, you don’t understand,” James said, tapping his pointer finger on his temple erratically. “I was attacked, not by a person, but by *something*!”

I crossed one leg over the other and leaned in closer to him. I wondered where this was heading. “How do you mean James? You weren’t mugged? Were you attacked by an animal?”

“No I *was* mugged,” he explained, tucking a small tuft of his medium length hair behind his ear. “My wallet and phone were gone when my friends found me.”

As confusing as it sounded, this was good. James was opening up more about his mugging.

I sat with a puzzled expression, waiting for Mr. King to elaborate.

“I was mugged alright,”James paused for dramatic effect. “Mugged by a werewolf!”

I had to stifle a laugh. Trying my best to keep my expression neutral I asked, “You? Mugged by a… werewolf?”

James nodded his head frantically. He looked tired. Like he hadn’t gotten a good night's sleep in a couple of days.

“Do you maybe want to describe exactly what happened when you were mugged, James? Help me understand what you saw.”

“It was dark,” he started, taking a seat in his usual chair. He clutched the backpack closely to his chest. “I didn’t see much, but I \*know\* I was attacked. It was quick and fast, smelled real bad too! It was a werewolf, I’m telling you! It had to be… and I think it turned me.”

Oh this couldn’t be good.

The blood-shot eyes.

Delusions of grandeur, more fantastical than ever.

His unstable and nervous demeanor.

“Are- are you using again, James?” I placed my hand gently on one of his, a gesture to show that I cared and was worried about him.

James was a recovering addict, it’s one of the reasons he started seeing me in the first place.

He quickly withdrew his hand from under mine. He scoffed. “Y-you don’t believe me do you?”

“I believe that *you* believe you were attacked and turned into a werewolf,” I told him.

Clinical Lycanthropy. I’d heard of it before, but never thought I’d witness a possible case in real life. What a truly fascinating trauma response.

“Tell me why you think that, James.” I clicked my pen, ready to jot down some notes.

James gave me the side eye. I waved it off and prompted him to continue. He gulped before speaking.

“Well, I don’t know how to explain it, doc. Everything just feels… different.”

“Try to explain it,” I urged.

“Everything is just so *bright* and *loud* now. So I guess enhanced senses? And I’m hungry. All. The. Time. These cravings I’m having, they’re intense!”

“Cravings?”

“Meat,” he answered. “Lots and lots of meat.”

“Mhm,” I said, nodding along as I wrote down my thoughts. “Have you experienced any accelerated hair growth as well? Lupine-like urges?”

James grunted. “This is serious.”

“And I’m being serious, James,” I countered. “I need you to be as detailed as possible.”

“Listen,” he said earnestly, leaning close, “The full moon is two days from now. I’ll be able to prove it to you then. Come with me before I turn, please?”

Quite frankly I didn’t know how to verbally respond to that type of request. My face however, said it all.

“I’ll even let you video tape it!” he added hastily after seeing my reaction.

I raised an eyebrow inquisitively. Instantly, ideas for experiments and different studies for this disorder ran through my head. Just the thought of researching and exploring this rarely talked about mental phenomenon was making me giddy. I felt like an undergrad student working on my senior thesis again.

“You can use the video to break out in the medical world or something, I don’t know,” James said, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly.

“But why me, James? Why not one of your friends?” I asked, curiously, seriously considering this insane proposition.

“Because, you’re the only person I trust with this. Plus, patient confidentiality and all that jazz.”

I couldn’t help but let out a small laugh at that logic. “If you truly believe you’re a werewolf, aren’t you scared of hurting someone? Aren’t you terrified of becoming this big dangerous creature? Why not go off alone?”

“There’s a good reason for that, doc,” James answered, opening his backpack. He reached in and pulled out a thick metal chain. “I need someone to help chain me up.”

***

*I can’t believe I’m doing this*, I thought to myself as I walked into Nancy’s diner. James had requested we meet up for dinner before we headed off to see his “transition.”

Me meeting up with a patient outside of office hours was practically unheard of, and on top of that, extremely unprofessional. I honestly don’t know what’s worse, me aiding James with his delusion or the fact I was excited to see where this would go.

The inside of the diner was much warmer compared to the ambient temperature outside. So as I searched the small dining room for James, I took my overcoat off and slung it around my forearm.

James spotted me and waved me over excitedly. I walked over to the small booth and sat down across from him. It felt like we were in my office again.

“Cozy,” I said. James chuckled and took a sip of water.

He was wearing a thick gray hoodie, some dark blue jeans, and some converse sneakers. I wore my usual work attire, black slacks and a light colored long sleeve cotton button up.

“Are you alright James?” I asked, noticing how shaky he was. He started rubbing his arms intensely.

I made a mental note of this. If James had been using drugs again, he was most certainly in the beginning processes of withdrawal.

He rubbed his arms some more before answering me. “Just fine. It’s just \*freezing\* in this diner.”

I offered him my coat, which he graciously accepted.

“Thanks. And thanks again for coming all the way out here. Dr. Morris-“

“Please James,” I stopped him, “I’m off the clock now. You can call me Harrison.”

“H-Harrison,” he stuttered, “I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate you coming out here. Once I prove my ‘condition’ to you, you’ll have no choice but to believe me. I know if I’d gone to anyone else they’d have just thought I was on Stardust again and not given me a chance.”

*Well James, the consensus was still out on that last one.*

I smiled and nodded. It was clear James was mentally unwell, probably due to both his break up and the trauma from his attack. I was merely here to make sure he didn’t harm himself with his little demonstration tonight, or at least that’s what I was telling myself.

What are the chances James actually does transform into a monster tonight? It’s improbable to happen, but there’s always that excitement that comes with the question: What if?

“Hi, welcome in!” Our waitress greeted, bringing me a menu and a glass of water. Her name tag read Jenny. “What can I get started for you this fine evening?”

James ordered first. “I think I’ll have a cheeseburger. Every thing on it and I’ll take that rare please.”

Jenny nodded as she jotted down his order in her book. She then looked at me. “I’ll just have the Cesar salad please.”

“Alrighty, folks!” Jenny announced as she snapped her book shut enthusiastically. “Your food will be out in just a moment.”

I looked out the window our booth was sitting next to. The horizon was full of light pastel colors as the sun started to set.

“If you’re worried about nightfall, I’ll turn when the full moon is at its peak. That’s what the internet says, at least.” James informed me. “You won’t have to worry about me, *ya know,* before then.”

I disguised my scoff as a laugh as I continued looking out at the pretty sunset.

Our food came out and we started eating. I don’t know if James was just putting on a show or what, but he stared at his cheeseburger like he hadn’t eaten for a year. He sunk his teeth into his food at the same time I took the first bite of my salad. James scrunched his face in confusion. Then he waved our server over.

“What the *hell* is wrong with you?” He started.

Jenny’s unnaturally happy smile faltered. My  eyeballs almost burst from their sockets. I started choking on my salad at James’s brash outburst.

“I asked for my cheeseburger RARE! Does this look RARE to you?” James shoved his cheeseburger in our waitresses face.

“I- I uh,” Jenny stumbled, clearly taken aback.

“Make me a new burger, rare like I asked for,” he demanded. “You can charge me for this one too, I’ll eat both of them.”

Jenny nodded before quickly running into the diner's kitchen, clearly about to cry.

I just sat there in shock as James tore back into his cheeseburger like it was a turkey leg you get at Medieval Times. He demolished that thing in three bites. Since he ordered his burger rare it didn’t take too long for his second one to come out. James then demanded our waitress bring him a full rack of BBQ ribs.

She looked to me for help to control my friend, but I was just as flabbergasted as she was. I hadn’t touched my salad as I sat in awe watching James.

If he was acting, he deserved an Oscar. It was actually kind of terrifying seeing him act like this.

It looked like James was on the cusp of an orgasm as he took the first bite of his second cheeseburger. Once again, it was gone in a couple bites. James snacked on his fries as he patiently waited for his ribs.

Jenny laid down the huge oval plate with a very judgmental look on her face. She scoffed as she took away James’s empty plates.

James waved her off as he began inhaling rib after rib. He devoured those ribs like he didn’t know when his next meal would be. He finished the whole rack of ribs only a couple minutes after Jenny had brought them out to him.

“Laying it on there real thick, huh, buddy?” I said sarcastically. Truth be told, I was bewildered that he actually managed to eat all that food.

James wiped all the barbecue sauce that had accumulated around his mouth with a couple napkins as he finished his meal. “What do you mean by that, Doc?”

“This whole…” I leaned in close to him and whispered,” werewolf thing. I mean the food, your aggression towards our server? That’s not like you, James.”

“I told you, doc, I haven’t been feeling myself. All day I’ve been agitated, and on top of that *starving*! It must be the moon. It’s affecting me.”

I rolled my eyes. There’s no way he was blaming his behavior on the moon. This Clinical Lycanthropy thing was pretty bizarre to witness.

James checked his watch before standing up and chucking a wad of cash on the table. “C’mon let’s go. It’ll be time soon.”

Still in a fugue state of shock, I followed James out of the diner. He got in his car and I got in mine. James quickly peeled out of the small parking lot. I followed closely behind him.

Honestly I was kind of relieved to have space from him. James was almost starting to freak me out, and that’s saying a lot coming from a therapist because I’ve seen some weird shit before.

We drove for about ten minutes before driving down a random dirt road. James got out of his car and prompted me to follow him. The two of us walked for about five minutes before arriving at this old rickety looking gazebo that was in the middle of nowhere.

***

“James, you seriously can’t still believe this can you?” I questioned as he pulled a thick and heavy chain out of his backpack. He handed it to me, the weight of it almost knocking me off balance. I’m surprised he carried that thing on his back without breaking a sweat.

James looked up at the clear night sky worriedly, the full moon slowly rising higher in the sky, “Hurry up, doc,” he pleaded, taking off my jacket and his hoodie

I stared at the now shirtless James, confused.

“So I don’t tear through it when I turn,” he explained nonchalantly. “The pants stay on for obvious reasons. I’m not getting fully nude in front of my therapist.”

“Yeah, cuz *that’s* weird,”I sighed, tying one end of the chain to the sturdiest looking part of the gazebo. The other end was wrapped around his waist and then his wrists.

“Okay,” James said after checking the time on his phone. “The moon should be at its peak within the next minute.”

I set up my phone across from him and pressed record. The light from the moon intensified as it reached its peak in the night sky.

James clenched his eyes shut and braced for pain, letting out a couple of anticipatory grunts.

He did look pretty sweaty and unwell, I have to admit. It could just be from all that food he ate, I rationalized.

James stayed that way, bracing himself for something to happen. He looked pretty uneasy. Scared. I felt bad for him.

A couple minutes passed and nothing happened.

“Wasn’t something supposed to happen by now?” I asked, stopping the recording on my phone.

James opened his eyes and looked down at his very human hands. “Maybe Google was wrong. Let’s wait a little longer.”

“James,” I said testingly. “You can’t let this go on.”

“Please,” he begged. “I need this, Harrison. Please!”

I scoffed, climbing down the steps of the gazebo and kicked a rock. I started walking back to my car before turning around. “Fine. We can wait a little longer.”

An hour passed and nothing happened to James. I got fed up and finally freed him from the chain.

“I- I don’t understand,” James looked dejected. “Nothing happened. Why didn’t I turn into a werewolf?”

“C’mon James it’s getting late,” I said, not answering his question. Instead, I put my hand on his bare shoulder to try and comfort him. He dragged his feet while I guided him back to his car. He looked like he was about to cry.

“Let’s go home.”

***

“Jesus, James, have you been eating?”

It was a couple days after the whole werewolf thing was debunked. James had just come in for his regular session. He looked worryingly thin, almost emaciated. To lose that large amount of weight in only a couple days wasn’t healthy. I worried the events that transpired the other night made James spiral even deeper.

It was quite embarrassing to witness, so I can only imagine how he was feeling.

“Yes!” He said plopping down in his chair. He must not have showered in a couple days judging by the ripe smell that wafted off him. “That’s all I’ve been doing!”

I wrote some notes down. He started lying. This wasn’t good.

“Mr. King-“

“I had it all wrong,”James interrupted me, almost excitedly. “I’ve been doing research. I know what happened now.”

“Oh really?” I asked. James was starting to sound like a conspiracy theorist now.

“I was cursed,” he stated matter-of-a-factly.

I wrote some more notes down. “Cursed?”

“By a wendigo.”

“James, not this again,” I said with a heavy sigh.

“I’m serious, it all lines up! The hunger, the weight loss, why I’m always cold all of a fucking sudden! Not to mention the slow transformation and matching symptoms to lycanthropy.”

“Wendigo’s don’t exist. They’re just creatures of Navajo folklore,” I said, exasperated.

What does exist, however, is Wendigo psychosis.

t’s a mental condition where someone believes they are becoming this cannibalistic creature. It usually stems from the person believing they lack the food and resources to stay nourished, especially during the winter, which causes them to turn to cannibalism.

I found out about it while researching more on Clinical Lycanthropy.

Sure, his skin had shrunk around his nails making them look longer, sharper too, and his skin was pale and sweaty. With how skinny he had become, he did look taller too, but that didn’t mean he was a Wendigo. He was using it as confirmation bias.

“James, let’s be rational here.”

“I AM BEING RATIONAL!” He yelled, getting up from his seat. He started pacing around the room nervously.

“Clearly,” I mumbled. “James, if you think this is true, how do you think you became ‘cursed’?”

“Isn’t it obvious?” James let out a maniac laugh. “The mugging! That thing must’ve attacked me and cursed me. That’s the only reason why it let me live. According to my research, not many people live to tell their tales about encountering these things. Harrison, please! I need your help trying to reverse this curse. I want to go back to normal!”

James’s mental spiral was becoming quite concerning. If I let this continue, someone was bound to get hurt.

“James,” I said softly, sliding a business card over to him. It was a contact number for a mental hospital named Brightburn. “I don’t think I can help you. But they can.”

“You’re a skeptic!” He shouted, throwing the card across the room.

“And you’re delusional!” I snapped. “I mean Wendigo’s and Werewolves?! James, you're unwell!”

“I wonder why!” He shouted, gesturing to himself. “Do you see what I’m becoming!”

“James, you’re not a wendigo!”

“I am!”

“You’re not!” I paused and lowered my voice. “Katie cheated on you! Left you for another guy.” James’s face fell when I brought up his ex.

I continued, explaining further, “So now you’re using this mugging as an excuse to make yourself something you’re not. You’re trying to make yourself seem like something bigger than you actually are, James. When deep down all you’re really doing is trying to do is show her that you’re someone worth staying with. Someone worth not cheating on!”

“You have no right to bring Katie into this!” James cried. “That’s not what’s happening! I’ve been cursed, I’m telling you!”

He grabbed his chair and chucked it across the room in a fit of anger. My chair splintered into a million pieces.

I sat back in my chair and sighed, rubbing my temples. “You say you want help, James. They can help you more than I can. If you don’t want to go, then that’s on you. But if you won’t help yourself, I can’t be your therapist any more.”

“No- don’t do this. Doc, you’re the only one I have.” James pleaded.

“You can’t keep this charade up anymore! I’ve indulged you long enough. You’re not turning into some supernatural creature. You’re human!”

James smoothed the wrinkles in his blue flannel shirt before making his way to the door. He stopped and turned to me.

“Just you wait, doc. I’ll prove it to you,” he seethed. “You better watch your back.”

With a slam of my office door, James was gone.

I took a breath before picking my phone up to call my secretary and to alert security to not let James back in the building.

***

“I think I’m being stalked,” I admitted to my wife Lauren. It had been a rough week with patients, plus I kept receiving threatening letters in the mail. But I couldn’t tell Lauren about it. I didn’t want to worry her.

We just found out she was expecting.

“You’re being silly, Harrison,” she said, trying to comfort me.

“Yeah, you’re probably right,” I said, giving her a kiss on the cheek good night. I turned over in our bed. My heart sank when I saw the shadow of a person glide past my window.

***

I came home late from work a little later than expected.

My office had been broken into and trashed. I had a sneaking suspicion who did it. Nevertheless, I had to clean my office, file a police report, and finish the rest of my appointments for the day.

Lauren had told me she had a surprise waiting for me at dinner, so I stopped on the way home to pick up flowers and a little gift for Brandon, our four year old son.

The overwhelming stench of iron and something putrid and rotting filled my nostrils as I opened the door to my house.

A massive pool of blood was visible in the kitchen.

I dropped everything in my hands and rushed to the kitchen. I almost puked when I found the dead bodies of my wife and son lying on the dining room table.

Half of Brandon’s face had been chewed off, his frozen expression that of terror.

Lauren had been disemboweled. Her intestines and other miscellaneous organs strewn about the table. On her chest was her uterus, which had been half eaten.

I fell to my knees and started bawling my eyes out. My family had been murdered.

Something growled animalistically behind me, “Believe me now?”

My stomach flipped. A tall emaciated figure stood in the doorway. It’s arms were disproportionately longer than its torso. Its hands and wrists were caked in blood. Sharp teeth glinted in artificial light. That putrid smell from earlier worsened.

A *wendigo*. James. It had to be.

He’d been right all along.

The wendigo pounced, but I managed to dodge. James recovered with supernatural speed as I ran as fast as I could for safety.

I lunged for the door to my home office for protection. I kept a pistol in there.

I managed to reach the gun before James reached me. He ripped the door off the hinges and bellowed out a blood curdling roar. I managed to squeeze past him and into the hallway. I took the safety off and cocked the gun, praying I had left it loaded.

*click-click*

James crawled up the banister of my stairs, hanging off of it like a monkey. He had chased me into a corner.

I braced myself as the thing that used to be my patient jumped. As James barreled towards me with a sadistic smile on his mutilated face, I pulled the trigger and aimed right for his chest. The force of the blast knocked me down.

When I regained my bearings, there was no monstrously disfigured body on the floor in front of me. Instead, my front door was swinging wide open.

James was in the wind. He left me alone, with my dead wife and kid in the next room. Grief and anger  flooded my veins.

All I wanted to do at that moment was kill James King for what he’d done. I wanted to kill myself for not believing him and allowing this to happen.

Then I remembered reading about something online. The wendigo’s weakness was fire.

I could kill it with fire.

I could kill James with fire.

So much for a mugging, eh?
