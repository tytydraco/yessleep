I should’ve trusted my gut the second we stepped off the main path.

But when you’re two hours into the middle of nowhere, with your best friend grinning like an idiot and saying, “Come on, it’ll loop back,” you go with it. Even if the trail looks like something pulled out of a nightmare—narrow, overgrown, and marked by little piles of bones arranged like cairns.

Bird bones, mostly. A squirrel skull. Too clean. Too precise.

“Probably just some creepy hiker thing,” Kevin had said.

But they were fresh.

The trail wasn’t on any of the maps I downloaded. It zigzagged up through dense forest—black spruce and larch trees leaning too close, their trunks warped like they’d been twisted under tension. The air was colder here. Stiller. Like something was holding its breath.

I kept glancing over my shoulder. The trees looked the same every time, but it still felt like something was behind us. Watching. Not moving. Just waiting.

“You good?” Kevin asked as we crossed over a fallen tree slick with moss.

I nodded. “Yeah. Just feels… wrong.”

Kevin just chuckled. “Wrong’s half the fun.”

But by the time we realized the trail didn’t loop—it was already too late.

We came to a clearing about thirty minutes later. Everything inside me screamed to turn around.

The trees at the edge were dead—white, dry, bark peeling like old skin. In the middle was a wooden structure. Low. Crooked. Like a hunting blind built by someone who had only heard about hunting blinds in a dream.

It was covered in antlers.

Dozens of them—tied with sinew, woven together, some sharpened to points and stabbed into the soil like warning stakes.

Kevin walked toward it.

“Don’t,” I whispered.

“Dude, chill. Probably just some weird artist’s camp.”

But the thing inside that blind wasn’t a sculpture.

It was crouched. Tall even while hunched over. Bones sticking out under paper-thin flesh. Its head was turned toward us, but it didn’t have eyes. Just pits where they should be—and a mouth filled with too many teeth. Blood-crusted antlers jutted from its skull like branches from a dead tree.

Kevin froze. “What the hell is that?”

I reached for the hatchet in my pack. My fingers didn’t want to move. The thing hadn’t moved either—but I could feel it. Like heat off a fire. Like a migraine in the air.

It exhaled.

The sound was dry and long, like wind over a grave.

Then the screaming started.

Not from the creature.

From Kevin.

He dropped to his knees, clutching his head, blood pouring from his nose and ears. His eyes rolled back. And the thing—the thing didn’t even move.

I grabbed Kevin’s arm. “We need to go. Now.”

That’s when the bones around the clearing started to shift. Not roll. Not fall. Shift. Like something was pulling them toward the creature.

Like it was building something.

We ran.

Or maybe we didn’t.

I don’t remember the trail back. I only remember the silence. The way Kevin wouldn’t speak. Wouldn’t blink. Just walked behind me. Breathing too slow.

We found an old ranger station a few miles out. Empty. Half-collapsed. No signal. I’ve been trying to write this ever since. Kevin hasn’t said a word. He just stares. Sometimes I think he’s mouthing things. But I can’t look long enough to be sure.

We’re not alone in here.

Something is in the crawlspace.

I can hear it breathing when I close my eyes.

I didn’t sleep.

Not because I wasn’t tired—my legs ached, and my eyelids felt like they were stapled open. But every time I started to nod off, I’d hear that dry breath again. Not outside. Inside. Somewhere low. Close to the floorboards. Like the thing was waiting.

Kevin sat in the corner of the station, facing the boarded-up window. He hadn’t moved in hours. Not since we first stumbled inside and he collapsed onto the floor, twitching like he’d been hit by a live wire.

Now he just… stared.

I had to say something.

“Kev,” I started, but my throat caught. I swallowed and tried again. “Kevin. What the hell happened back there?”

No response. Just that slow, steady breath.

I stood. My boots creaked against the warped wood. I walked toward him, heart pounding. “I saw you drop. I saw you bleed. And then—then you just stood up and followed me like nothing happened.”

His shoulders twitched. Barely. Like a puppet on the edge of jerking forward.

“You said something in the clearing. Before we ran. What was it?”

Nothing.

Then—his head turned.

Not fully. Just enough to let me see his mouth.

He was smiling.

Not like Kevin used to smile. Not like the dorky grin he’d throw out before cracking a joke.

This was wrong. Lips stretched too far. Teeth too white. Gums too red.

“I don’t remember,” he whispered.

But it wasn’t his voice.

It used to be. But now it sounded thin. Stretched. Like someone dragging a recording through static.

I backed away.

“I’m going to find help,” I said, gripping the hatchet in my pack. “There’s a main service road a few miles back. If I can retrace our steps—”

“You won’t make it,” he said.

I froze.

“I never would have,” Kevin added, smiling wider now. “But it wants to see what you’ll do. That’s why it let us go. It’s watching.”

My skin crawled. Every instinct screamed run. But I had to try. I had to believe there was a way out.

I grabbed a flashlight, some granola bars, a flare, and the small compass I always kept clipped to my jacket. The bones on the trail had pointed in. Maybe they’d point the way back out too.

I left Kevin in the station.

I don’t know if I locked the door behind me.

⸻

The forest had changed.

Not just darker—wrong. Like the shadows held memories they didn’t want me to see. Branches clawed at my jacket, snagged my skin. The path we took earlier looked different now, like it had grown overnight—twisted in ways that didn’t follow natural geometry.

I followed the compass south.

Every now and then, I saw those bone piles again.

But they were… rearranged.

No longer neat stacks. They were shaped like letters now.

Some of them spelled TURN BACK.
Others said FEED HIM.

The worst one was a bird skull lashed to a tree with strips of leather. Its beak pointed upward—toward the canopy.

When I looked up, I saw it.

Not the Wendigo.

The sky.

It wasn’t sky anymore.

It was watching me.

No stars. Just something enormous—sprawled between the treetops. Antlers too wide to measure. Skin that shifted like smoke. And eyes… not eyes, exactly. Just voids. Pulsing in and out of my vision.

I ran.

I don’t know for how long. Branches whipped my face. Something followed me—silent but massive. My flashlight flickered, then died.

When I finally stopped, gasping, trembling, half-blind with fear—I realized I wasn’t alone.

There was someone else on the trail.

A man. Tall. Thin. Wrapped in rags and fur. His face hidden beneath a hood made of stitched-together hide.

He didn’t speak.

But he raised a hand and pointed behind me.

I turned.

Kevin was there.

Smiling.

I don’t know how long I have. If anyone finds this…
