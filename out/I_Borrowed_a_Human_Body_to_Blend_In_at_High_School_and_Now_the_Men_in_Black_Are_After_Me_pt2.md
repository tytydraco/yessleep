 The Warden didn’t last. About ten minutes into first period, he muttered something about needing to use the bathroom and walked out, leaving the class to its own devices. The noise level skyrocketed the second the door clicked shut. Papers flew, someone launched a pencil like a javelin, and a group in the back started chanting something about Fortnite.

I sat there, trying to figure out what to do next. Blending in wasn’t going great. Hughie’s memories hadn’t exactly prepped me for this level of chaos.

That’s when it occurred to me: I hadn’t actually talked to anyone yet. If I was going to understand this strange teenage ecosystem, I needed allies. Friends. Social connections.

Simple enough, right?

I turned to the person on my left—a kid slouched so low in his seat, it looked like he was trying to merge with the desk. His hoodie was pulled halfway over his face, and he was intently scrolling through his phone.

“Hey,” I started, trying to sound casual. “So, uh… what’s up?”

He didn’t even glance at me. “Nothing.”

“Oh. Cool, cool,” I said, nodding like an idiot. I waited a beat, then tried again. “So, do you think Mr. Ward actually went to the bathroom, or is he just hiding in the teacher’s lounge?”

Silence.

The kid gave the faintest shrug, still glued to his screen. I sighed and turned to my right.

This time, I tried a different approach. “Hi. I’m Hughie. What’s your name?”

The girl next to me didn’t even pause in chewing her gum. “Not interested,” she said flatly.

I blinked. “In… talking?”

“In you.”

Ouch. Strike two.

I leaned back in my seat, wondering if making friends was harder than deciphering the human genome. But then, I spotted someone sitting alone in the next row—an opportunity.

I slid over to their desk, plastering on what I hoped was a friendly smile. “Hi. I’m Hughie.”

The guy looked up, clearly surprised. “Uh… hey. I’m Derek.”

“Nice to meet you, Derek.” I paused, scrambling for a conversation starter. “So… how do you feel about the pyramids?”

He squinted. “The pyramids?”

“Yeah, you know, in Egypt. Big triangles. People think humans built them, but let me tell you—” I leaned in conspiratorially, lowering my voice. “It wasn’t humans.”

Derek blinked. “What?”

“Aliens,” I said, with a knowing nod. “Specifically, the Zorlaxian Builders Guild. Amazing craftsmanship. They used anti-gravity platforms and plasma fusion tools—way ahead of their time.”

There was a long, uncomfortable pause.

Derek slowly stood, grabbed his backpack, and moved to a desk on the other side of the room.

Strike three.

I sighed, slumping in my seat as the chaos of the classroom buzzed around me. Making friends was harder than it looked. Maybe blending in was overrated.

That’s when the door slammed open. The warden was back. This time, he was holding a plasma rifle that looked extra plasma rifle-y. He scanned the room, locking eyes with each of us like a predator sizing up its next meal. Then he smiled—the kind of smile that makes you wish you had been sick that day—and pointed the rifle at the kid he’d grilled earlier.

“Sweatshop or death,” he said, his voice dripping with casual menace.

The kid tilted his head, looking like a dog hearing a vacuum cleaner for the first time. Confusion, fear, and just a hint of curiosity flickered across his face. Around the room, the vibe was unanimous: What the hell did he just say?

Even Phone Kid put his phone down. That’s how serious it got.

The kid let out a nervous laugh, clearly hoping this was some kind of elaborate substitute-teacher joke. “Sweatshop? What does that even mean?”

The warden sighed, like he was explaining taxes to a toddler. “Yeah, your buddies? They’re too slow. Lazy, even. Their recent work hasn’t exactly been cutting-edge.”

The kid just stood there, blinking. His brain was clearly still buffering. Before he could muster a response, the warden shrugged. “Too slow to reply to slow to work,” he said—and blasted him.

The aftermath? Red. Red everywhere. The floor, the walls, my shoes—God help me, even Bubble Gum Girl’s bubble popped and dripped red.

For a moment, the room was dead silent, except for the faint hum of the plasma rifle cooling down. No one moved. No one breathed. It was like we’d all collectively agreed to pause life.

Finally, the warden broke the silence. “Don’t worry about him, guys,” he said, with a dismissive wave. “He was an alien.” He nodded, as if this explanation should magically resolve everything.

Bubble Gum Girl was the first to crack, letting out a scream that started high and kept climbing. The warden swung the rifle toward her. “Shush! Or you’re next.”

She shushed. Oh, she shushed real fast.

Then, the warden pulled out what looked like a can of Axe body spray. “Alright, everyone, look at the light,” he said, shaking the can like he was about to Febreze the trauma away.

We all stared, too scared to ask questions. He pressed the button. Snap. You know that flashy thing from Men in Black? Yep. Memory erased. Clean slate.

For everyone, that is—except me. I was just borrowing Hughie’s clone body after all.
