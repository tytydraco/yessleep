This is a long, LONG story.  I can’t promise you it’ll be a good read – I’m no King – and, unfortunately, I can promise you that it doesn’t get interesting for a while. Certainly not in this entry. I know this is a forum for SCARY personal experiences -- and trust me, I'll get to that in later parts -- so I understand if this gets removed. But I need to tell you about them, and about where this all started. 
This is a story about the two best people I met in my life, who I loved more than anyone and anything, and how I watched their lives fall apart. 

This is about Austin and Kimberlie.

------

In the foothills of Southwest Virginia, there’s a city named Redview. It’s got about a hundred thousand people – about a hundred thousand more in the surrounding county – and it’s the largest city in the state west of Richmond.  Not far from there, about half an hour if you’re headed South on the US220, is a small town – Maybe village? I’m not quite sure – of about two-hundred and fifty people, called Michael’s Mill. It’s nestled in a small valley, surrounded by Kudzu-infested hills, with the highway cutting through its center. It’s pretty small – two gas stations, one on either side of the highway, a law office, a bank, several abandoned, unkempt buildings and closed up shops, and a post office make up the town center. Located on a hill by the train station – a historical site – was a small, pathetic-looking complex housing a police station, town hall and food bank. I grew up just a few minutes from this town on a small, forested back road home to a number of single and double-wide trailers, on a street called Black Oak Road.

My town wasn’t a bad place to live.  It wasn’t dangerous, and there wasn’t a whole lot of crime, though the local police department employed only two officers. But when I was a child, I always felt this sort of primitive, primal fear of the country around me. I’d imagine monsters, hulking and massive, stomping through the forest, or dark, shadowy figures staring into our windows – made worse when a local tweaker actually did do that to try and perv on mom. There were a lot of junkies on my street, though they rarely caused trouble, as well as lots of older couples or widows in retirement. 

An overgrown rural shit-hole like any other in America, full of retirees, meth addicts, and a family of four on welfare. When I turned six, I was entered into Kindergarten at a local elementary school, where I met my first friend, Austin. Unbeknownst to me, he had lived just up the street, putting us on the same bus route to and from school. Slowly at first, and then all at once, Austin and I became best friends. He’d come down to my house every day, and I’d walk him back up to his, tossing a football back and forth the entire way. We’d roam around the woods, imposing and ominous before, vast expanses of wilderness that seemed otherworldly, out of bounds, explored only in my worst nightmares, now our dominion. My fears melted when Austin was there. A bear or a ghoul or a bobcat or a ghost, it didn’t matter. We’d face it together. 

We grabbed sticks and sparred, sometimes ending up bruised but never failing to feel downright awesome as we battled through the trunks and trees. We drew maps of the neighborhood and pretended to be explorers venturing through unknown lands, like Lewis and Clark charting the Oregon Trail. Austin and I spent hours bounding through the trees, discovering every branching trail and little abandoned structure for miles.

In the middle of the main trail (we always called it a trail but it was really more of an overgrown path), the one that connected both his and my houses, were three trees. Two were nearly toppled over, one leaning on the other, which leaned on the third, whose trunk stood tall and straight, its roots holding it firmly in the ground – and supporting the weight of all three. Together, they formed something like a backwards D, crossed with a  triangle. Austin and I called it the Archway, and it soon became our primary hangout, even more than either his or my Trench or our houses. There was nothing overly remarkable about it – we found other archways like it in the next few years – but the view of all the neighborhood’s houses, the serene nature of the spot and the beauty of the Archway captivated us. 

It was the summer after we discovered the Archway, when Austin and I had just finished fourth grade, that we met Kimberlie. It turned out, as with Austin, she had lived on our street the whole time – in a house with the longest driveway I’ve ever seen, placed back in the woods as if concealed from the road, right in the middle of the street between me and Austin’s houses. We had walked past her a hundred times and never known. 

The girl's mother, paranoid and traumatized by her ex-husband, never enrolled her daughter in public school, instead choosing to homeschool her. Kimberlie was never allowed to leave the driveway – the long nature of which I later learned was pivotal in her mother’s choosing the location, as she allowed Kimberlie to walk up and down it, getting fresh air and exercise without leaving the property or her mother's line of sight. It was by pure chance that, while walking through the woods on Our Trail one day, we spotted a girl who looked about our age, walking up and down a long, gravel driveway.

“Dude, do you know who that is?” I said, gesturing her way. “No,” Austin replied hesitantly, the word drawn out and his voice high pitched. “I’ve never even seen her before. What the hell?” “No idea.” “Wanna go introduce ourselves?” I looked at him with an expression that was something between “you serious dude?” and “Is that even a question?” There was a problem, though. “Well,” I began. “We’re not just gonna come up through the woods, we’ll get shot. Let’s go back and we’ll go the long way around.” 

We did just that, and while I was confident it was the right choice, by the time we got there, we were both getting worried that she’d be gone. Thankfully, as we walked up the hill toward that long driveway, our legs burning from the work, we saw her. Kimberlie had long, pretty black hair and pale skin with black, square-framed glasses framing her chocolate eyes. Freckles dotted her porcelain face like stars in the night sky, and she wore a black hoodie and grey sweatpants. She didn’t see us at first, listening to music with an MP3 player in her pocket and a long white wire connecting it to the headphones stuck in her ears. 

We tried waving, but she didn’t see. Said hello to her, but she didn’t hear. I wasn’t sure if she was truly oblivious to our presence – it seemed to me we were in clear view – or just blatantly ignoring us, and either way, I didn’t want to bother her. Austin, on the other hand, felt differently. “HEY!” He shouted loudly, and I instantly cracked a smile; I was always smiling around him. The girl jumped at the sudden noise, letting out a gasp and quickly yanking the earbuds from her ears. “Yeah?” She said, wary but curious. “Just wanted to say hi – I’m Austin, this is–”
Suddenly, a noise interrupted him. It wasn’t a loud noise, wasn't a shrill grinding or a sudden scream. It was a rumbling. It was a low, subtle hum, the kind you felt in your skull, the kind that set your teeth on edge. It reminded me of the time I’d ridden to school with my asshole cousin Tim, who had had the bass at max the whole way and was evidently trying to blow my eardrums. Like I said, it wasn’t that loud. But it was that powerful. We felt the earth vibrate, ever so slightly, in a way that could've been easily mistaken for a rogue nerve firing or missed entirely if you didn't really focus on it. It kept on for what felt like a whole five minutes, but was likely less than half that, before ending abruptly. The girl that would soon become my closest friend in the world looked at me, an expression that was somewhere between fear and curiosity on her face, as if waiting for an answer or an explanation. As if I had one. 


“Uh, hi. I’m Isaac.”

The next year or so was sort of a blur. Kimberlie’s mom DID NOT like us interacting with her daughter, and directly told her to stay away from us multiple times. Kimberlie, of course, disregarded this, coming out to talk to us without her mother’s knowledge. It started with us just talking at the top of her driveway – we’d stand on the other end of the street, not even on their property, as we told her the latest gossip from the kids at school along with all of our greatest exploits.
Our new friend listened eagerly, soaking up all she could about the outside world before she’d eventually look at the time on her Barbie watch and a frown would form on her lips. Then, she'd slink back down that long driveway and back inside her large, two-story house – the nicest on the street –  and leave Austin and I alone once again.

Eventually, we told her about the Archway. 

“Yeah, there’s these three trees, they all lean on each other and they make a triangle, or arch. We call it the Archway. It’s pretty much in the middle of the woods.” Austin said. 

“Yeah, it’s wicked!” I added with excitement. “You should come with us to see it!” Kimberlie’s face fell, and I immediately regretted the invitation that I knew she couldn’t accept. I wasn’t even sure why I offered – there was no way her mom would ever let her go. “Fuck her, come anyway! Can’t let others control you, y’know.” Austin said, guessing the cause of her apprehension and trying his best to sound tough as he dropped the f-bomb. Kimberlie giggled. “I wish. She can be so mean sometimes.”

“Shoot. Speak of the devil…” I said as Kimberlie’s mom came stomping up the driveway behind her, with a look on her face that could cut diamonds. She was a young-looking woman, much younger than mine or Austin's moms, with hair just as long as Kimberlie’s, but not nearly as dark. There were lines etched in her face despite her apparent youth, and dark circles under her eyes.

Kimberlie paled as she realized what I must be staring at, her mother’s voice calling out a second later. “Kimberlie Elizabeth Gates, get your ass over here, now!” Shit. “Sorry guys, I gotta go!” Said Kimberlie as she quickly turned, running toward her mother, who was studying a lilac bush she kept in the yard with an oddly determined gaze. I thought it was odd that she'd stopped to look at the plant, as angry as she'd sounded, and even odder how intently she looked at it, as if she was trying to make a decision.

She turned back to Austin and me and ordered us to leave without saying a word, in an expression that very clearly said Leave or die. We quickly obliged. As we started back down the hill toward my house, I heard Kimberlie’s mother ordering her daughter inside, and I glanced back over my shoulder to see Kimberlie dejected, head pointed down at the ground as she walked back down the long drive toward their house. In front of her, at the lilac bush, Kimberlie’s mother plucked off a branch, one of the longer thinner ones, with a satisfied, if not happy, expression. I turned and walked home.

It was only six days before Austin and I saw Kimberlie again. This time, though, she was different. Fiery. Defiant. Like she had internalized Austin’s earlier advice. It was good – she had always been shy, reserved, before – but also concerning. Concerning because, even at ten, with the emotional maturity and understanding of my age, I could tell that beneath her brand new attitude, Kimberlie seemed angry. Angry and scared.

She smiled at us as we walked up the road, waving. Austin and I exchanged nervous glances, unsure if we should engage after clearly getting her in trouble last time, but we weren’t left with much of a choice after she called out to us. “Yo, dicks, get over here already. Hurry.” We did, immediately, excited to talk to our new – if still mysterious – friend once again.

“Hey, what’s up?” I said with a grin, raising my hand up for a high-five. She met it and repeated the motion with Austin, before getting an all at once serious and mischievous look on her face. “I want to go and see the Archway.” I gasped. It was monumental. Less than a week after her mother had all but dragged her back down that long gravel driveway for just talking to us, she was going to sneak off with us into the woods. Her mother would kill us if she knew. I was ecstatic. “Awesome, finally! Come on!” Austin shouted before excitededly darting off up the road toward his house. I exchanged a look with Kimberlie, who glanced nervously over her shoulder despite her new demeanor, before the both of us took off in the same direction as our friend.

As the summer breeze danced lightly through the trees, Kimberlie, Austin and I darted through them beneath it. When we finally reached the Archway, all of us were panting from the run up the forest hill. Hiking that thing put me out of breath when I walked, much less sprinted up it at breakneck speeds. With burning lungs and a stabbing pain in my hip, I limped towards my friends. 

Austin and Kimberlie were already sitting on a log near the base of the more stable tree – we refused to sit anywhere near the other two, for fear they’d fall on us – and I walked over after I caught my breath, joining them. Kimberlie was looking up and to the left, toward the majestic structure, studying it and everything else like it was her first time in the woods. It might have been. If so, she had rn in with zero hesitation and was a complete badass – and I remember thinking this at ten. Even with Austin by my side, I had been afraid my first time in the woods.

Then we heard it for the second time. At first I thought it was a truck or tractor going down the street in the distance, but looking at the portion of road that was visible for just a few moments convinced me otherwise. Then it got louder. Kimberlie heard it too, raising her head up and scanning the road as I’d done, before turning to look deeper into the forest, where it seemed to be coming from. It was louder here than it was in her driveway, and some leaves even fell from the trees, branches snapping in the distance. The first one made Kimberlie jump, gasping. Austin put his arm around her shoulder and she pushed him off, scooting away, before shooting him an apologetic look. “Sorry, I don’t like to be touched.” “My bad,” the brown-haired boy replied, sounding sad. I knew it was guilt. 

The momentary distraction had taken our focus off of the Hum, still growing but subtle enough to slip into the background if you didn’t really focus on it. 

“I wonder what it is.” I said curiously, trying not to think about the dull ache in the base of my skull. Did it go on this long last time? I was sure it hadn’t, but then again, that didn’t mean much.  ”I heard someone at school say it comes from underground or something.” I looked, wide-eyed, at Austin. This was new information. “Hold on,” I said excitedly, “Other people have heard it too?! I thought it was just around here!” Austin shook his head. “Nope, they hear it all over. Everyone at school knows about it. Or, at least a lot do.”


Then, Kimberlie – who had been silently staring at the sky until that point, her neck craned up and shirt pulled just enough to reveal a long, dark bruise on her shoulder that stretched down, past the curve of her back – began to speak. I didn’t say anything, just looked at it for a moment before fixing my eyes on hers. “I think we should find it. The source of it. We can, you know. Just head in the direction it gets louder. It might take a few trips.” Austin and I exchanged a look of mutual acknowledgement and assent, grinning, before I replied. “Kimberlie, you’re a genius.” She looked over at me, a cheeky smile spreading across her face. “I know.”

Almost as if in opposition to our plans, the Hum didn’t come for nearly two weeks after that day at the Archway. We waited and waited, assembling our gear – backpacks full of water and snacks, flashlights, earmuffs in case the Hum got loud, and – to my amazement and Kimberlie’s reluctant fascination – a pocket knife stolen by Austin from his father, “in case we needed to defend ourselves.” It occurred to me that we would not be defending ourselves if he had the knife, but alas, my father had no pocket knives to steal. 

Eventually, the fated day came. I was sitting with Kimberlie on our usual log, listening to her tell a story about her uncle Mark who was a marine, while Austin was carving his name into the Straight-Tree (the name we gave the tree that was standing straight up rather than leaning). Suddenly, a group of leaves fluttered off of the tree – an action soon repeated by the leaves on all the trees around us – and fluttered between me and Kimberlie. I felt it in the ground, then, a soft vibration, just the way it always started, and I knew it was time. 

I grabbed my bag and they grabbed theirs, and we all set off in the direction we could feel it coming from. I was sure of it as we continued walking, the vibration growing stronger, beginning to fill the air as well as tremble through the ground. We walked for a while, silent, the Hum’s presence palpable, leaving now room for conversation. As we got farther, I could swear there was a taste in my mouth, like pennies, and I was sure, surer than I've ever been of anything else, that we would find it then, the source. That day, that hour, that very minute, it would be there, over the next hill, around the next tree. But it never came. We must have walked two or three miles before the Hum finally stopped.

When it did did, our silence broke almost instantly. The Hum was stifling, making it hard to even get a deep breath. It was hard to think about the ungodly noise without a pit forming in my stomach. Now, though, we were cracking jokes, laughing. It felt nice. Freeing. We stacked a group of rocks to mark our progress before turning around to head back to the Archway.

I paused, taking a moment to observe the creek-slash-drainage ditch at the bottom of the hill we stood on, before turning around and feeling my heart stop in my chest when I didn’t see Austin or Kimberlie there behind me. Then, I breathed a sigh of relief as I saw Kimberlie crouched behind a nearby tree, shushing me. Austin approached from behind a nearby bush, looking frustrated. Apparently, in the time I was looking at the creek, they’d decided to play hide and seek. I laughed, winking at Kimberlie as Austin started looking around even more desperately, clearly getting confused. How he hadn’t spotted her was beyond me, and I couldn’t help but laugh again, louder this time. Apparently it was contagious, because before I knew it Kimberlie was laughing too, and then Austin. By the end of it we were all a bit dirty from rolling around on the dirt path, belly laughing. 

The mood quickly changed when we heard somebody else laughing with us. I wheeled around to see who when I was greeted with a middle-aged man with a backpack, wearing a red-and-black flannel and green cargo pants. He had short, jet-black hair and a weathered, wrinkled face, with eyes that looked tired but soulful. “What are you kids doing out here?” He asked, narrowing his eyes at us. “Aren’t you a little young to be exploring by yourself?” He was right, of course. “Our parents gave us permission!” Kimberlie assured him, though he wasn’t quite buying it – either that, or he was judging all of our parents. 

“I really should take you home, young lady. And you boys too. It’s getting late.” He said, his voice caring and concerned, yet stern. “No,” I started, but couldn’t finish as Kimberlie began to hyperventilate. “N-no, no, no, she’ll be so mad, no, no, I can’t, I can’t, you can’t-“ She repeated over and over in a shaky voice, panting and trembling as she stepped back, behind me and Austin, who I could tell was getting anxious. “We’re gonna go home now, sir. I promise.” I said. “If your parents know you’re out here, why would they be mad?” He said suspiciously to Kimberlie. Something about the man's demeanor made me uncomfortable, though I couldn't articulate why, and when he took a step towards us, I felt a surge of adrenaline rush through me.

Austin, much more impulsive and excitable than I was, shouted at the man. “We said we're going home, leave us alone!’ Kimberlie tried to bite back a sob but failed, and that caused something to snap in both me and Austin. We were both decently strong for our age. I had accidentally knocked my six-foot-six, two-hundred-fifty pound father to the floor just a month prior, and Austin had always been the fastest and most athletic kid in our class. So I was sure that even if our enemy was a grown man, he and I would be more than capable of at least causing some pain and distracting him while Kimberlie fled. I looked over at Austin, who nodded almost imperceptibly, pulling out his pocket knife. “Leave. Us. Alone.” He repeated as firmly as he could, while I stepped back, grabbing a long, heavy stick off the ground and holding it out in front of me.

“Now, son, you just put that down. Now. You too, with the stick.” He said to Austin before gesturing to me in the back. “No. We’re going home. Just leave us alone, okay?” My voice was shakey and I could feel my little heart pounding in my chest. 
As Kimberlie’s breathing began to even out behind me, she took a step forward, chin up, looking at the man. 
“We really do just wanna go home. We’re just exploring. We’re sorry, sir.” She offered, in the charming, Kimberlie way that we would come to know and love. The man took another long moment of silence before making a noise somewhere between a sigh and a chuckle. “Go the fuck home. It’s dangerous out here. And be careful who you pull knives on, son.” He said, his tone not scared or even angry, but sounding mostly annoyed, as if having a trio of ten year olds pull weapons on him was a normal, if irritating, occurrence. As we reluctantly walked by him, I noticed something glinting with sunlight on his belt. A closer look on our retreat revealed it to be a small, golden key with the letter ‘E’ engraved on its center. 

When we finally reached the Archway, our legs aching and blisters on our feet, we began to hear a faint buzzing sound. My heart began to race, though if it was in fear or excitement, I couldn't tell. It never happened twice in one day. Never. That had to have meant something. It had to. Maybe we'd gotten close. Maybe we'd gotten close and it was a warning, or maybe-

I calmed down as Austin pulled something out of his pocket: a cellphone. My jaw dropped for an entirely different reason “Dude! That’s awesome!” I couldn't believe he had one, especially as young as we were. His parents were so cool!

He didn’t respond, and as I watched his brow furrow, a twisted, warped little knot began to form in my stomach. He read the words on his screen aloud as we heard the distant sound of a police siren echo off of the vast expanse of trees. 

“Amber Alert: Missing Persons; Child; Emily Thompkin, 16, last seen with father Bill Douglas Thompkin in a purple sweater and blue jeans.” 

Then, suddenly, I puked. Spewing water, crackers, beef jerky and bile all over the ground in front of me. Some of it splattered onto Kimberlie’s shoes and pants, causing her to groan in disgust. “Ugh, gross!” Austin watched in concern and morbid fascination as my stomach acid and partially-digested food congealed on the ground below us, a feast for the scavengers and insects to enjoy. I remember thinking about them then, about how something so normal and average to one being can be appaling and unthinkable to another. And I remember thinking about how unappealingly colorful the whole display was: sickly yellow, green grass, brown soil. 

I’m not sure why I threw up. It could’ve been exhaustion, or stress from our encounter with that hiker. It could’ve been the absolute helplessness and gut-wrench I felt when I saw Kimberlie sobbing and my best friend pull a knife on a grown man. It could’ve been because I felt sick for poor Emily, who I knew somehow, deep in my gut, wouldn’t be the last to go missing. 

Or, maybe it was because, as we stood there in bewilderment, watching the sun set over the trees and listening to the sound of the wind as it rustled gently through them, I felt a trembling in the Earth beneath my feet, 

And a terrible, dull ache in the base of my skull.
