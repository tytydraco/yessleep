I don't understand this new thing with “Halloween fireworks”. It's obviously just firework companies trying to clear out excess inventory, take a fountain with Uncle Sam, throw a new label on it with a witch, and Boom, it's for Halloween now.



I also don't think it's smart to have fireworks around children wearing flammable costumes.



This was just a mild gripe to me until my daughter brought home a Skull Buster.



It was a few days before Halloween, my wife and I were in the process of decorating the lawn, when my came home, holding something strange.



“Daddy, look what I got!”

She held it out to us. It looked like a skull-shaped popper.



My wife asked the question first.



“Where did you get this?”



My daughter responded matter-of-factly.



“A man was giving them out.”



Parental instinct took over, and I snatched it from her hands. She was visibly upset, explaining she should never talk to or take things from strangers because they can be dangerous didn't make her feel better, but the promise of Ice cream to make up for it did.



While my wife took her out for said ice cream, I looked over the strange popper and found out it was called a Skull Buster, and at the bottom of it was a string. Curious, I went out to the backyard, aimed it away from myself, and pulled the string.



I heard a pop, then nothing happened. I was honestly disappointed that it was a dud.



At least I was until I got a phone call from the mom of one of my daughter's friends.



“Did Lanie come home with a skull-shaped firework?”



“Yeah, I took it from her.”



“Well, don’t pop it! There's something wrong with them. Charles just had to rush Gina to the hospital!”



That was the first of several calls I got from Lanie's friend’s parents, the ones I didn't get a phone call from, most likely called 911, because the ambulance sirens didn't stop for the rest of the night.



I decided to try looking into this on my own. I didn’t expect a lot of headlines to call them by the product name, so I searched multiple news sites, along with Facebook groups, and even tweets talking about firework accidents. From there, I put together a list of every known "surprise” from popping a skull buster.

 

34 instances of bugs exploding out of and biting whoever was holding the popper, insects ranged from fire and bullet ants to scorpions, and even black widow spiders.



26 instances of caustic liquids bursting out, these ranged from drain cleaners to bleach, and even sulfuric acid.

These were reportedly stored in glass vials that would burst when it was popped.



14 instances of projectiles that fired when the popper went off, projectiles ranged from broken glass, thumbtacks, and rusty nails. One article described a little girl accidentally firing a rusted nail into her father's neck.



10 instances of the poppers being filled with gunpowder.



And 3 instances of Poppers releasing toxic gases.



I remembered the Skull Buster we just left in the backyard after it didn't go off I looked out into my backyard and was horrified by the sight.



In a roughly 10-foot area around where the Skull Buster had been dropped, all of the grass was dead, as were any birds that had flown through, and a squirrel that was curious about the popper.



So this is a warning: if your child brings you a skull-shaped popper called a Skull Buster, get it away from them immediately, and for God's sake, don’t pop it.
