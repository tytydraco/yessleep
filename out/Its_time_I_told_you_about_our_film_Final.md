&#x200B;

After leaving the set of ‘The End of Eternity’, Seb and I went west. We didn’t stop until every sign pointing us back to Chatter Blinds were far off in the rear-view mirror. The highway was as open as ever, but I couldn’t help but to feel trapped; like some cosmic shackle had bound my life to what’d happened back there. Even if I never saw or heard from any of them again, there was no way I’d ever forget what’d happened.

After an exhausting trip, Seb and I finally parted ways at a roadside diner. He was going back home to his girlfriend, and I was gonna pick up my job working the projector. It wasn’t much, but I needed to get back to something mundane to process it all. To come down.

We had a meal and hugged it out in the parking lot. We didn’t say much. I wished him the best, and he did the same. But as he got back in his car, he asked me a final question.

“If I hear something, do you want me to pass it on?”

“Yeah,” I nodded. “Sure.”

I didn’t really want it, but I didn’t expect him to hear anything either. It was over. It was done.

&nbsp;

And for a long time, that was it. Six years.

Six years of pretending to live a normal life. Dating back and forth. Showing movies to the late-night crowds. Getting promoted to general manager and handling the shifts.  I ended up in brief but stormy relationship with a Dutch woman that almost had me killed. Long story, but that’s what life’s about. A whole bunch of long stories.

Six years after the filming of the ‘End of Eternity’, I was in a slump. The movie was never shown. Sure, I got the check in the mail, and it was substantial, but money just sort of leaks out of your account over time. It didn’t take long for all that hard work and suffering to be turned into a cheap replacement car, new kitchen floors, a suit, and the various day-to-day minutia that no one really pays attention to.

I was as broken and stuck as ever. My new position afforded me a slightly more flexible schedule, and a place with one more room, but that was pretty much it. It was the same job. The same people. The same movie trends bringing in the same crowds.

Then, I got a call from Seb.

&nbsp;

Seb Digman was a family man by then. I hadn’t heard much about it, but I got the impression that he had a troubled family life. I knew of his one kid, little John, but I think he had a second or even a third kid with another woman. Either way, he was steering dangerously close to deadbeat-dad-road, and he’d long since taken his hands off the wheel.

But talking to me was different. It was like nothing had ever happened. Just two excited friends, eager to meet. He told me about coming to town in a couple of days to sort out some family stuff, and he thought we could catch up.

“You said you wanted me to let you know if I got something,” he said. “Well, this is it. I got something.”

&nbsp;

I met up with Seb at an old corner pub, the kind of place that’d been around for generations. I could easily picture the folks behind the counter having been there since the civil war.

Seb was good, all things considered. A little heavier under the eyes, but still as upbeat as ever. The scar on his hand from being nailed to a tree was as obvious as ever though – he wasn’t getting rid of that anytime soon.

We had a couple of beers and talked about our lives. He had a lot more to say than me, but the story about my Dutch ex-girlfriend gave him a couple of laughs.  But when it came to the meat of the conversation, the tone took somber turn.

&nbsp;

“I’ve been keeping my ears open,” he said. “The movie’s out there, but it’s mostly shown at private parties. Small gatherings – people close to Hampton.”

“Like a home movie kind of thing?”

“Yeah, like that,” nodded Seb. “It’s… fucking weird.”

“So what’s the big news?”

“Well, there’s gonna be a showing pretty soon,” Seb sighed. “And, uh… it’s not far. There’s this up-and-coming finance guy who’s expanding into the entertainment industry, and Hampton must’ve gotten whiff of him.”

“Sounds… exclusive,” I added.

“It is,” Seb agreed. “But the guy is like… what, 21? And his mom is, uh… an old acquaintance of ours. We can get a foot in the door.”

“Through his mom?”

“Hear me out on this.”

&nbsp;

I heard him out. I didn’t like it. He made an argument for it, explained how it was all set and ready to go, and finally just asked me to go – as a friend.

“Can you live your life without knowing what this was all about?” he asked.

And no, I couldn’t. I really couldn’t. Not even then.

&nbsp;

This man’s mother was none other than Ariel; the ringleader from that group of violent locals back from Chatter Blinds. Turns out after getting severe burns on most parts of her body, a lot of the fire in her burned out. Having turned docile, wheelchair-bound, and lethargic, Ariel had spent years trying to find a way to come to terms with her past. This was a way to do so – to see the source of her pain with her own eyes – and to apologize for her past misgivings.

This had turned into a sort of enemy-of-my-enemy kind of deal. Ariel had long since realized that her problem wasn’t with us, but with the various powers-that-be that pushed that whole film into the realm of the senseless. After a long discussion, she and Seb had agreed to put their differences aside. She would get him a couple of invitations to the screening, and in return, he’d grant her the peace of mind that only forgiveness could bring.

I wasn’t buying it. I’d seen that woman’s eyes, and I couldn’t imagine anything but hate coming from them. But then again, last time I’d seen her, she’d almost been burned alive. That changes people.

&nbsp;

On the day of the screening, Seb picked me up in his ’68 Frogeye Sprite. We had a couple of Slim Jims as a dinner snack. I could tell Seb was nervous, but it was impossible to say exactly why. Maybe he was excited to leave this chapter of his life behind, once and for all. Or maybe it was something else. Either way, I could tell something was off. He barely said a word on the drive up, keeping his eyes on the road and his breathing steady. But he did say one thing that made me raise an eyebrow.

“There’s a storm on Jupiter,” he said.

“Sorry, what?”

“There’s a storm on Jupiter,” he repeated. “Read it in a magazine once. It’s been around for centuries. Kinda looks like a big eye.”

“Didn’t know that.”

“You can sort of see it from Earth,” he continued. “Like a large, white… disk. And it’s all storm.”

“Where are you going with this?”

“I dunno,” he sighed. “It’s just… some things are like that, you know? Without that storm, without that big eye in the sky, we wouldn’t see it.”

Looking at the road ahead, I could feel the first pitter-patter of rain.

“If it wasn’t for all that storm and noise, we might not even know it was there,” he continued. “Makes me wonder what kinda things are out there, flying under the radar, you know? All the things without storms, that just kinda… stay in the dark.”

He turned to me as he clicked on the wipers.

“I’m not sure we’re seeing the real storm yet,” he sighed. “I just… I don’t think this is it.”

&nbsp;

We parked about a block from the venue. By now, the rain was coming down hard. Seb had to pull a tarp over his car, costing us a couple of minutes in the downpour. By the time we got to our meet-up, we were both drenched. But our host wasn’t.

We met Ariel outside a café, along with her son – Jonah. I could barely recognize her. Most of her face was burned, and her left eye had sunken in on itself. Looking at it felt like falling into a well. She didn’t even look up at us when we approached, instead holding a cross around her neck with both of her shaking hands.

&nbsp;

We sat down with her. Jonah went to get us a couple of coffees, leaving us to stir in our own silence. It probably took Seb a solid minute to find the right words.

“This won’t set things right,” he finally said. “But it’s a start.”

Looking up at him with that one dark eye, and the other as bright as ever, Ariel nodded.

“I understand.”

“You tried to have us killed,” I said.

She turned to me, her face barely moving. Not a single wrinkle of expression changed.

“Yes.”

&nbsp;

There wasn’t much more to say. We had history. We were all on our own paths, for our own reasons. But maybe this was meant to be something else, and maybe for that moment, we all realized it. Either way, we were in this together.

We trudged through the rain, making our way to a rented-out community theatre; our venue for the night. Jonah tried to keep the mood up by talking about his upcoming investment, while Seb and I chimed in with what applicable movie trivia we could conjure up to keep him interested. While I was still a hobbyist, at best, Seb hadn’t slowed down in the least. He could step back into his role at the drop of a hat.

We were among the first to arrive. There was a check-in at the door, where we were written down as guests. The place was buzzing with caterers and security personnel. There were a few other guests who’d arrived early, casually socializing in the lobby. Jonah excused himself, bringing his mother along to meet his many potential clients and business partners.

As Ariel was rolled away, she turned to us. And for the first time, I could sense something.

The hint of a smile.

&nbsp;

Within the next hour or so, the place was crowded. All kinds of people from the movie industry, along with one or two hopeful singer/songwriters. There was a composer who’d worked with Kubrick for a brief time, taking up plenty of spotlight. Three B-list actors, trying to talk their way into a handshake and a couple of promises. This one news anchor from upstate. A photographer, along with his girlfriend of the week. It was a wild mix. Some seemed desperate to just get an “in” on whatever this was supposed to be, while others seemed to be there out of genuine interest for Hampton and his work. Then, of course, some people just wanted to skim some money off of Jonah.

Seb and I kept to ourselves. We were asked a couple of times who we were, but we kept the discussions short. We just said we’d worked on the movie, mostly background technical stuff. Seb tried to divert attention by making people talk about themselves – a strategy that worked nine times out of ten.

There was a little announcement jingle; the same that we used at my job. The movie was about to start.

&nbsp;

We got seats behind Jonah and Ariel. Even with all the guests invited, there weren’t even enough people to fill a quarter of the seats. It was eerie, in a way. Like we were doing something inherently wrong.

A few caterers walked up and down the rows, offering shrimp cocktails and cheap sipping drinks. Seb bunkered up with a couple, getting a few eye rolls in return. Looking at me, he shrugged.

“I drove here,” he whispered. “You’re driving back.”

“The man with the plan,” I sighed.

&nbsp;

As the lights dimmed, there was a faint scatter of applause coming from the other side of the room, as none other than director Roy Hampton stepped out on stage. He waved at the audience as he introduced himself.

“I’m Roy Hampton, director of ‘End of Eternity’,” he presented. “This exclusive viewing is made as a benefit for our rising entertainment star and benefactor. Let ‘em see you, Jonah, don’t be shy.”

Jonah got out of his seat, waving to the others. He sat back down with a smile, looking at his mother. Ariel didn’t move a muscle.

“It’s been a long journey. We’ve presented screenings of this movie in select theatres across the country, but as you’re about to experience, it’s not a project intended for the mainstream. This was a passion project. Something deep and meaningful to me, and the many people who’ve worked on it. I believe it can give us a glimpse of something deeper, and in a way, to make us whole.”

He took a deep breath, looked down, and back up.

“So without further ado, I present to you – the End of Eternity. Thank you.”

&nbsp;

I could see Seb tense up in the light of the silver screen.

This was it. This was the movie.

The End of Eternity.

&nbsp;

Sitting here, decades later, it is hard to describe it. As I watched, I kept having to remind myself what I was doing. I kept spacing in and out of focus. It was as if the movie continued to run inside my head, even when I closed my eyes. Still, there was a narrative. I’ll try to explain it.

The movie portrayed an anonymous woman in a blue dress. She was tortured by the voice of an otherworldly being, whispering secrets of the world to her. As she tried to get a job in a new town, escaping a passionless marriage, she eventually succumbs to the influence. Turning more and more inward, she finally understands her place in the world.

In the movie, the Earth exists in a multitude of fractured realities. In one world, people wander as broken shadows, desperately seeking to become whole. In another, they are tortured beasts, floating in a hellish firescape. But in countless iterations of the universe, all existing simultaneously, the protagonist is the only one who solely lives here – in this one instance. This one life. This one place.

She is the first of the last. An indication of the many worlds dying – disappearing. An indication that whatever waits at the end of eternity is waking. An impossible force, deep within the crust of the soil, stirring; cracking her world open like an egg.

So it speaks to her. The voice at the end of all. The final spoken word, and the penultimate voice. A voice that can be heard by her, loud and clear, as it is not diluted by impossible multitudes. She can see the truth. She can listen.

She can weep.

&nbsp;

As the movie built up to the reveal of the last word, I looked around the room. Even before it was spoken, I could feel it. I think we all could.

And in unison, we mumbled under our breaths. We mouthed it silently.

EO.

All throughout the movie, there was this nonsensical voice speaking to her. The “influencing voice” was just… noise. I couldn’t make sense of it. And yet, a few select words rang true. The same words I’d learned that day on-set, when Hampton had asked me to read an excerpt. And still, even now, it brought images to mind. The same images they’ve brought since that first day. An image of a blue fabric, fluttering in the wind. Salt underneath my fingernails. A great fire.

But others reacted differently, as if they heard different things. An older man in the back started laughing maniacally. Jonah just sunk his face into his hands, openly weeping. Looking over at Seb, he just shook his head in disbelief.

“John deserves better,” he mumbled. “He… my boy deserves better.”

&nbsp;

I think we all saw and heard what we wanted to. Or, in a way, what we were meant to. Maybe they saw some version of their own truths, or heard a stutter of the same voice as the protagonist. Maybe they felt the same existential frost crawling up their spines as I did.

Either way, as the lights came back on, it was dead quiet. Everyone just sat there, looking straight ahead. You could’ve heard a pin drop.

Roy Hampton took to the stage again. But something was different.

&nbsp;

There was a sway to his step that I hadn’t seen before. His back was straighter. His eyes looked different – colder. When he entered the middle of the stage, he relaxed his shoulder, taking a deep breath.

“I think we all saw something of ourselves,” he smiled. “We learned something new. Much like I learned something the very first time I read this book.”

He showcased a thick leatherbound manuscript, tapping it confidently.

“It said I was to make this movie. To show it to others. To give little glimpses of what could be, both in our own lives, and our lives to be. And at the end of the line, all those little glimpses would add up to one thing.”

Ariel stirred in her seat. Up until that point, she hadn’t moved a muscle.

“At the end of it all, I’d come back. And I’d watch the world with new eyes, and a beating heart.”

Hampton stepped forward, casually dropping the leather-bound script to the ground. Pages scattered across the stage.

“And finally, I live again.”

&nbsp;

Everyone just… looked at one another. A mumble rose through the crowd amidst the crying and giggling. Jonah put a hand on his mother’s shoulder, trying to calm her. I looked at Seb – his eyes still red from tears.

“He’s Rask,” Seb wheezed. “Hampton listened too much. He’s… he’s Rask.”

I could see it. There was something there. Something I could recognize in the pit of my stomach, that could find me from across the room. I’d seen him that night in the woods, and by the fire on the set.

I don’t know how he did it. But this dead author, somehow, made his way back. That was him on stage – not director Roy Hampton.

&nbsp;

He looked at me with a gleeful smile. He drew breath and raised his hand. Something was about to happen.

But before it did, there was a bang.

Looking down at the row in front of me, I saw Ariel, holding a handgun, with a strange symbol engraved on the barrel.

&nbsp;

Roy Hampton collapsed to the ground, clutching his stomach. Ariel was tackled, and Jonah was dragged off. People ran for the exits or dove to the floor. A few remained seated, staring blindly ahead; not even flinching at the gunshot.

Hampton writhed in pain, clutching his stomach. It was a bad hit. His blood was so black that it seemed purple. It stained his clothes and hands.

As he screamed and gasped, his voice became increasingly twisted. Changing in pitch from high to low, back and forth, like he was cycling between young and old in a matter of seconds. It was this unearthly howling noise, erupting into a voice; but not his own.

“So-aorak zent Eo! Ru-aubgur vio gept Eo!”

The words poured out of him like torrent.

&nbsp;

Pointing with a bloodied hand at his audience, his screams cycled between horrifying and nonsensical. But with every breath, something would happen.

The first was the main theater door. The heavy rain had pooled outside, resulting in a flash flood. Those first few people who tried to get out were knocked off their feet, tumbling down the stairs. All the lights but the projector went out, as the movie started up again on its own – playing from the halfway mark. The protagonist with the blue dress was superimposed on the bleeding body of Roy Hampton, who had forced himself back up to his knees as we all fumbled around in the dark.

“Yuth-maogu! Zevbreth! Driikh aoleth! Eo! Eo! Eo!”

I didn’t see what caused it, but I saw Ariel being flung across the room. Picked up and flung with a massive force, at least 30 feet, instantly snapping her neck on impact with one of the second-floor balconies. Her lifeless body tumbled to the ground, gun still clinging to her hand.

As Hampton wept tears of blood, pandemonium unleashed around us, as the world seemingly came apart.

&nbsp;

In the back, there was a man whose body was turned into shadow. To this day, I can’t explain what he used to look like, or if it even was a man. It’s as if he’d been erased in every way but the immediate visual sense that he was there.

I saw a woman who’s eyes were burned from the inside out. An old man spewing up dirt in the front row. Jonah was crawling towards his mother, as little white bioluminescent bugs poured out of his head.

A sulfuric wind blew through the room burning through my nose and throat. And despite it all, I grabbed Seb by the shoulder and headed for one of the emergency exits.

&nbsp;

There were flashes of light going off behind us. I could see things in my periphery. Tall things, short things. Transparent and solid. There were discolored sunflowers creeping out of cracks in the wall – seemingly reaching for us. As whatever Hampton had become continued to unravel, the audience kept running.

It felt like a gauntlet. People were disappearing around us. There was this massive red-feathered bird creature who tore into an old man ahead of us, dragging him into a bathroom stall. Someone tripped on a molar tooth growing out of the carpet. There was a short man in the far back that just… evaporated into a cloud of flies.

Even halfway through the building, I could hear him screaming. It reverberated through the walls, rattling my bones.

&nbsp;

There were flashes of something different. Different corridors, with different people. With every step, I’d be someone, somewhere else. I’d be young, I’d be old. For one breath, I was Seb – watching his scar on my own hand. It’s as if we were piercing a barrier, losing a semblance of order that our mind required to function.

Then it was dark. Cold. I would feel my body stiffen. I grew elongated, unfeeling, and unreal.

In that moment, I thought it was over. I thought that’d be it. I had this vision of worlds beyond, and the many instances of lives I would come to lose.

But one thing kept coming back to me. The words I’d understood all the way back when.

An image of blue fabric, fluttering in the wind. Salt under my fingernails. A great fire.

This wasn’t it. Not yet.

&nbsp;

I drew breath as we turned a corner. I was there. The carpet under my feet was real, and the screams of the maimed and dying were piercing my ears.

As Seb and I made our way out the emergency exit, and the alarms began to wail, I heard a scream for help. Instinctively, I reached out an arm, pulling someone along. I didn’t know who it was, nor did I care. Seb hurried ahead, keeping the door open, crying out for me to hurry. We all collapsed outside, scrambling to get to a safe distance.

Only three of us made it out that night. Me, Seb, and this mysterious woman I’d managed to drag along. Turns out, that was Edith M. Carroll; one of the movie’s co-writers. I hadn’t recognized her in the crowd.

&nbsp;

As the chaos inside the venue rose to a crescendo, a lightning bolt struck the roof of the building. I could see the clouds part above for a split second.

Then, it was over. No screams. No death. Just this one bright light, thunder, and then the pitter-patter of a calming storm.

It was done.

&nbsp;

They later said the theatre collapsed from an unsupported roof, exacerbated by the downpour. To this day, no one really knows how many people died in there. It’s as if everyone just forgot they even existed. The only name mentioned in the articles were Roy Hampton, who was credited as a “philanthropist” and “esoteric scholar”.

The three of us who made it out could finally put an end to it all. While the answers we got weren’t necessarily what we wanted, we could at least say that this was it. There was nothing more for us to look into regarding Roy Hampton and the End of Eternity. And yet, it was an empty victory. Pyrrhic.

&nbsp;

As we rested outside, waiting for the sirens to stop, we spoke in hushed tones. Seb had trouble focusing, rubbing the scar on his hand.

“If… if I find anything else, I’ll let you know,” he said.

“…sounds like… a plan,” I nodded.

We held hands for a while. Just two people ensuring one another that somehow, things were going to be okay.

&nbsp;

It didn’t exactly turn out that way, but… it never really does.

That night was the last time I saw Seb Digman. He died about eight years later to a kind of metal poisoning. According to his kids, it’d been something he’d had in his system for years. Maybe even the whole time I knew him.

I eventually dated, and married, Edith. The one this whole story began with. That’s how I know of her work at the bakery, and the community college. We’ve been married for decades, right up until her passing not too long ago.

But it was only a matter of time. For years, she had cried to me about what she’d seen that night at the screening – her death. Staring into her own face, as life slipped from her.

Maybe that’s why she choked in the bathroom. I don’t know.

&nbsp;

There was also the case of Dawn Andersen. It’s strange; she’s still around. My oldest son showed me a video of her on YouTube not too long ago. She makes videos under some strange synonym. She looks different, but it’s the same woman. I can tell.

I’ve researched Rask over the years, trying to make sense of the things I’ve seen and experienced. I wanted to understand what Hampton’s obsession was about. I haven’t found a complete copy of that manuscript though, and I count that as a blessing. Neither are there any remaining copies of his film – the End of Eternity. Not that I can track down, at least. Maybe there’s a forgotten tape in the back of a closet somewhere.

But the more I’ve thought about it, the more I’ve started to realize the ingenious nature of his work. That by reading, experiencing, and understanding his work, Emmett Rask can manifest. He can always come back. A concept cannot be forgotten. Information doesn’t go away, just because we don’t know it. It’s still there.

Hell, I don’t know how to assemble a phone, but I can still call my grandchildren. Just because I don’t know how doesn’t mean the information doesn’t exist.

That’s how Rask exists. He just… is. And whenever someone looks a bit closer, or listens a bit too eagerly, he makes his way back. He learns his way back. Little by little.

&nbsp;

I’ve come to terms with what is going to happen next. I was kept alive out of circumstance. Rask wanted someone to live long enough to learn just enough to bring him back again. For someone to invest, experience, and become. That’s what he wanted for me.

But I think he forgot one thing – the images shown to me. The words I’d been given.

Blue fabric, fluttering in the wind. Salt under my fingernails. A great fire.

&nbsp;

Looking back at my long life, the very first picture of me and my mother was at a hospital. She wrapped me in a blue blanket, leaving the window open to welcome the spring wind. That was my very first earthly experience.

The night that Edith and I conceived our first child was on our honeymoon, on an Italian beach in late July. I remember it for many reasons, but the salt crystals beneath my fingernails, on that very night, meant something. Even then, I could feel it.

&nbsp;

And now, as I write this… excessive and maddening recollection, I look at what is to come. A repeating pattern coming to a close.

Perhaps I’ll learn a little too much, a little too soon. Maybe the act of writing this all down will bring it all to the surface and send Rask roaring back with a vengeance.

But I don’t think it will. As I look across my desk, at the last of Edith’s scented candles, I think what is going to happen has long since been established. And as I wait, putting these final words to paper, I think it will be okay. While there may be an end to eternity, there are so many more things to understand than we’ll ever grasp.

&nbsp;

So with that, I leave you with this.

We have to accept the mystery.

There will never be an end to questions, no matter the answers.

And at the end of the line, we must embrace the great fire to come.
