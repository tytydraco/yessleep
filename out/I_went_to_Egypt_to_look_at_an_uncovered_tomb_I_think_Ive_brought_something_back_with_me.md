My name is Samantha, and I'm a photographer. I'm freelance, often getting photos for different jobs and purposes. Sometimes I do weddings, sometimes I do birthdays, and other basic shit like that. Then there are the odd jobs, like taking pictures of models, shooting promotional stills for television, and I even took a picture for a nudist couple's wedding, which was about as fun as it sounds. It was the stretch between January and March, when jobs dried up. Turns out, people don't like taking pictures in the freezing ass cold, and I frankly didn't blame them. I had a wedding gig in January once in Milwaukee, the bride and groom wanted pictures outside, and she slid on the ice and cracked her skull. She was fine, but they spent their wedding night in the hospital. Anyway, I was watching Jeopardy when I got a call from a professor, an apparent Egyptian archaeologist. He told me about a job that needed documentation; he'd uncovered a tomb deep in the desert, and he said that before he continued to excavate, he wanted pictures. Considering that I wasn't doing anything and needed money, I accepted.

The flight was paid for, and I'd carried a bunch of equipment with me and got flagged by flight customs. They went through my bag like they were a starving child opening a bag of chips. One of my lenses actually fell out and cracked onto the floor. To say I was pissed was an understatement. They were apologetic, but I was seething about it. I just grabbed my stuff and left. I didn't have anything nice to say, so I chose to say nothing at all. I flew economy, I was wedged between an old man who slept with his mouth open and a woman who was particularly chatty about how excited she was to see the pyramids. I was excited, too, to be honest. The furthest I traveled out of the US was to Canada or Mexico. However, Egypt was an entirely new adventure for me. 

I was in the middle of a dream about home when I was awoken by the lady next to me gasping. I woke up slightly startled. She had tears in her eyes, saying,

"Would you look at that!" she said with a trembling voice,

I leaned over her and saw the pyramids jutting out from the desert sands, standing there in all their glory as they cast gigantic shadows over the landscape. Next to them is the city of Giza, which would look large under any ordinary circumstances, but next to the great pyramids, it seemed puny. Hard to believe that human hands would make something so great, so seemingly immortal. I thought that maybe after I got the job done, I would be able to take a stroll in Giza and look at the historical sights. Maybe I'd even take some pictures, not for the job, but for myself.

The airport was busy, and I saw an older, balding man with a group of younger men and women surrounding him. He had a huge white sign that he and some of the other members held that said 'WELCOME TO EGYPT, SAMANTHA!' I waved to them, and they waved back. I talked with the Professor, who will remain anonymous, aloud with the rest of the crew. We ate at a Pizza Hut which had a great view of the pyramids, and as the sun began to set, we talked business.

"Our site," he said, munching on a slice of cheese, "It's about a ten-hour drive from here, goes out far into the desert."

"How'd you find it?" I asked,

He smirked as he swallowed his food and elaborated,

"I was gifted some very old scrolls by a colleague who expected me to try my best to interpret them. I may be versed in hieroglyphics, but this was difficult, very difficult. But I was able to gather something from it. From what I translated, it allegedly detailed the location of the burial site of a 'shamed' priest for one of the pharaohs. The *exact* pharaoh I couldn't deduce."

"This priest, which God did he...I dunno, worship?"

He chuckled at this, too, and stated,

"No idea. It was vague, I think maybe it was purposely vague, it feels like they're trying to keep it secret, whatever it was. Where was I?"

"How you found it."

"Right! I followed where this text allegedly led, and for the longest time while I drove, I thought it was a fool's errand. But as I drove, whack! The bottom of the car struck something hard; if it weren't for my seatbelt, I would've gone through the windshield. I got out and dug until I found stone, man-made stone."

"Sounds like you were lucky."

"Far from it, I damaged the buggy pretty bad, and for a few moments on the drive back, I thought I was gonna be stuck in the middle of nowhere dying of exposure. But I thankfully made it back, contacted my fine students, and we began excavating as soon as possible. We've uncovered the outside; all we have to do now is look inside."

We carried on conversation until all of the food was gone, at this point, we were just chatting and drinking. We made lots of small talk, trying to get to know each other, and they all seemed like great people. The crew, as I learned, was mostly comprised of the Doctor's former students. They were loyal to him to a fault; it almost felt culty to me, but maybe it's because all of my professors were dickheads. One thing was nagging at me, though; this was an archaeological dig of an undiscovered tomb in the middle of the desert. By all means, this was a huge deal. I cleared my throat and asked,

"Doc, why hire me? This seems like a job for someone a little more professional."

"I thought that's what your work entailed, aren't you professional?"

"Yes, but...I don't know, it feels like you would want someone a little more popular, like some actual press."

"True, but I want to publish my findings independently. I have had plenty of instances in my field of work where people took credit for my discoveries, my own research. After a while, I became a footnote while everyone else basked in the glory."

I noticed that his face had tightened; he was gritting his teeth. I could tell that whatever happened to him, it made him seethe with rage. I cleared my throat and broke the tension,

"Got it, regardless, I'll be sure to take the best photos I can. I brought my best lenses, well, apart from one that customs fucked up."

"Oh, well, that's a shame." He said with a tinge of sympathy, 

The sun had finally fallen behind the pyramids, and it signaled to everyone that it was time to rest up for tomorrow. It'd be a long drive, and an even longer time exploring this new tomb. 

The hotel I stayed at was nice, I slept well, and when I went to the lobby, the rest of the crew was waiting for me. We left Giza around six in the morning, and we drove off the beaten path in a series of high-duty trucks filled to the teeth with tech, tools, and other necessities. The drive itself was boring; it started out thrilling, driving off-road into the desert, but after the first three hours, it became tedious. I was in the back of one of the trucks, making small talk with one of the crew members when we got a radio message, through the scratchy static,

"Dig site ahead."

In the distance, and couldn't believe my eyes. In the distance, sunken partially in the earth, I saw what looked to be a small, inverted pyramid, broad side pointing down into the desert sands. Surrounding it was a variety of tools, generators, and giant lights pointed at the structure. It was an unusual sight to say the least, it looked like no ancient tomb I've ever seen, but all I'd seen up until this point was only things I would've watched on TV or read up on in magazines. The vehicles surrounded the perimeter, and everyone got out into the midday sun, beating down on the sands. The Professor flagged me down and told me to take some exterior photos before we got started. So, I did, I thought about making them look artsy, but decided on taking some flat shots with plenty of exposure. Enough to where you could see everything on display. Afterward, I walked around to where the supposed entrance was and found the crew removing a large stone. Ancient air shot out with a hiss and kicked up the sands. It didn't look very professional to me, and it hadn't occurred to me whether or not these people had permits. As the stone fell to the wayside with a loud thud, the Professor beckoned me to join them with a large, eager smile. Guess I was too far into this thing to back out, what was I going say say? Could I get a ten-hour ride back to the airport? 

I stepped inside, smelling rank decay in the darkness. The Professor yelled outside, 

"Let's get some lights in here!"

As soon as he said that, his students rushed in, setting up lanterns, handing out flashlights, and some of them even cracked glowsticks and chucked them ahead into the dark.  The tomb was massive, as if the pyramid itself was hollowed out just for this specific crypt. I began taking pictures of the inside as everyone poured in and began combing through everything. I won't attempt to explain what they were doing because I'm a photographer, not a archaeologist. There were several jars strewn about the floor halfhazardly; some of them were cracked on the floor, and what remained of their contents must've withered away. The walls, which I expected to house hieroglyphs, were bare except for one inscription behind a sarcophagus near the center of the room. I asked the Professor to translate, and he told me it read,

'HERE LIES THE TRAITOR OF THE GODS, FOLLOWER OF ------'

The last word was crudely chipped away,  like it was something that was meant to be forgotten. Below the inscription was an etched figure of what looked to be a human figure kneeling before a large humanoid figure. The head of the large humanoid was missing, completely chiseled away. I asked the Professor who the large figure might be,

"Unsure," he said, "I can usually tell which God is which from their designs, their clothing gives me context clothes if I struggle trying to identify what I'm looking at."

"So, you've never seen this...deity before?"

"I can't say I have. Solid white skin, black clothing, no gold accents whatsoever. And scarab wings are...unusual for a God."

I took some more pictures of the surroundings of the tomb, the crew hard at work preserving and documenting their findings. It was fascinating watching them work, and as I took pictures, I felt a knot in my stomach growing and twisting. I couldn't explain it, but I felt like we weren't supposed to be here. I sat down to have a breather. I was on my feet taking pictures for hours, and I just needed to sit down. I sat leaning against one of the walls and looked above the chamber, looking at the large roof overhead. It stretched on pretty far, and the lights couldn't reach quite that far. But then I saw something stirring in the dark, things swaying around. I pointed my flashlight up to the ceiling and saw a collection of small, hanging coffins, sarcophagi, whatever the hell you want to call them. The wind outside had picked up and traveled within the tomb, and it made them sway back and forth. I gathered everyone's attention, and they looked on with confused, disturbed expressions. 

One of the swinging coffins' ropes snapped and fell to the ground with a thud. We circled it and pried it open to see what was in it. To say we were upset with what we found is an understatement. It was the body of a child, decapitated, and in place of its head was that of a bat. The body was seemingly split open and stuffed with scarabs and sewn back together. I looked to the Professor for an answer, but got none. He only said,

"Pictures. Take plenty of pictures."

We finally opened the coffin at the center of the room and found a body that lay wrapped tightly, but the head was exposed. His mouth was stuffed with pieces of what looked to be flattened rock. The Professor retrieved them and laid them out on a fold-out table the team had brought in. The rock was not just a rock, but it was the pieces of the text etched into the wall, and the head of the deity that had been smashed apart. The name of the deity was Arnok, God of Rot. The headpiece completing the deity was that of an elongated human skull with black dots swarming it.

"Not dots," the Professor said, "Look closer, those are scarabs."

I took more pictures. I hated being in there; it gave me the creeps, and it felt like the air was thick. I will admit that I was shaken up by the whole thing, and I was walking to one of the trucks to grab some water. 

"Where are you going?" shouted one of the students,

"I'm getting some air." I snapped back,

I exited the tomb to the relief of a fresh breeze blowing through the desert. The moon was out, looking exceptionally large against the bare sky. It illuminated the desert with a soft white hue, and as I drank the water, I saw something at the end of the desert. I tall figure with tattered black robes blowing along with the strong winds. The silhouette was huge, even at a distance, and I felt a ripple of goosebumps flow down my body. I turned to run back to the tomb, but I felt my vision fade, and I just blacked out. I felt completely fine beforehand; I have no serious health issues, but I, for some reason, just completely shut down.

I woke up in the backseat of one of the trucks, and heard the Professor talking to one of his students who was driving,

"Professor, I don't understand. What the fuck was that? What did we find?"

"I don't know," the Professor said with trembling words,

One of the crew members was praying silently, clutching a cross around their neck. I faded in and out of consciousness until I woke up in a hospital room. The Professor apologized profusely for what happened and thanked me for my help on the job. I just took the money and flew back home. I developed the photos and sent everything to the Professor. I was done with it all and ready to move on to something boring again. 

I won't let you know where I live, just know that it's cold and wet. I was glad to be back in my house watching snow fall outside. Weeks passed since that job, and I was ready to see my work in a published article or magazine, but nothing came. I was in the middle of taking a shower when I saw something black and small moving in between my soap pumps. I didn't have my glasses on, so I got close to look at whatever it was and saw a giant scarab beetle. Another thing to know about where I live is that beetles are not native to where I am, especially in the middle of winter. I freaked out and left the shower, soaking wet. I grabbed my towel and ran to my bedroom to dry off. As I walked in, I felt something gritty beneath my feet. I grabbed my glasses and saw that there was sand littering the floor of my bedroom. I felt uneasy, but I chalked it up to maybe some old clothes that were full of sand. I mean, I've heard of plenty of people taking fold-out chairs to the beach and finding sand months later.

I returned to the bathroom after drying off and getting dressed, then dealt with the beetle. However, it was missing, crawling somewhere else in my home. I looked all over for the little bastard, but I couldn't find it anywhere. I tried to move past it, but it was always at the back of my mind. I watched TV and checked my emails to see if anyone wanted my services, but I found nothing. I checked to see if the Professor published his paper yet, and what I found was strange. After our work was done, he sent me a link to his blog, on which he intended to publish his findings. Out of curiosity, I decided to check it out. Instead of an article about the inverted pyramid and all of the strange things we saw, I found something more bizarre. The site was changed from a scholarly blog to something called: 'ARNOK, THE WAY OF THE ROT.' 

My pictures were all strewn about the site underneath text stating different boisterous things above it. ARNOK IS THE ONLY TRUE DEITY, ARNOK WAS SUPRESSED BY THE WEAK, ARNOK IS DIVINE, and so forth. I clicked on a video to see the Professor recording a video from his computer camera, and saw him disheveled and weak-looking. His skin was pale, and sores littered his exposed skin. The eyes were dull, milky, and sunken in. And he spoke with a fever that was unlike the mild-mannered Professor I knew,

"Good evening, I'm Professor ---------, and I come to you to enlighten you. What history and science lack in their attempt to explain the world around us is a concrete answer. They give us the pieces, but they can't put them together! I...along with my wonderful students, have found the answer. We put the pieces together and found Arnok."

He hoisted up pieces of the excavation: scrolls, tiles, and so much more he'd retrieved from the tomb. He displayed them with a wild, yellowed smile,

"Look upon these masterworks, buried in the desert! The gods of Egypt were jealous, the God of Abraham was jealous, but he was found! Arnok deserved freedom, and he chose me! He chose all of us!"

He began to cough, and blood spat from his lips; he didn't bother wiping.

"I am here to spread his grace upon this modern world. His gospel may scare most, but it is what people need to hear. He spoke to me in the deep desert and told me his gospel of rot. He saw the world change around him and believes it is time for us all to return to the earth. We're rotten, so we must rot. Regardless of age, regardless of race, regardless of who you believe, we must rot! I have studied the process to accelerate our decay! The ritual needs blood to hollow out the body of someone so young and stuff it with the creatures that feast on dead flesh. In the desert, it was scarabs, but it can be done with any insect or vermin. Arnok only accepts offerings of those who are young...."

I remembered the hanging coffins, the little bodies that had been brutalized, he continued,

"I decided to choose my son for the process; he does not know yet, but his work will bring wonders. If you want to find Arnok, you do not have to travel far, as I have...you simply see or hear his name, and he will latch on to you. If you want to look for a sign, listen for the flutter of scarab wings, feel the sand beneath your feet, and you will be in his presence. This is my last vlog. I will rot and become one with the earth. Praise be to Arnok!"

I slammed the laptop shut and immediately contacted the police of the state and country in which the Professor stayed and reported a possible murder, but then, as I was pacing around my living room. Something loud buzzed by my ears. I ducked in fear as I saw a massive scarab beetle flapping its two great wings around me. My gaze followed it until I saw it fly into a dark corner of the room and disappear into the shadows. I stared at it and turned the flashlight on my phone to illuminate the corner. But the light would not illuminate the dark, and from it, a great pale figure donned in royal black robes emerged. A white skull that was swarming with scarabs, it spoke to me in a voice so sweet that tears filled my eyes,

"My child of woe, Samantha, do you feel it? The decay of the world around you? Take my hand, together the holy rot will consume us, and bring us together as one."

I wish I could tell you I was strong-willed, that I rejected the deity, but I've found solace in Arnok. He speaks to me more frequently now; his voice is so sweet. I don't have any children to accelerate the rot, but Arnok has shown me another pass. I feel the scarabs inside me, their tiny spindly legs scraping across my muscle, their broad exoskeleton brushing against my skin. The pain hurts, but I know he will reward me! He said that he loves me! 

If you are reading this, know that the time of the Holy Rot has begun! Listen for the scarab wings, feel the sand at your feet, and know freedom!

Praise Arnok!
