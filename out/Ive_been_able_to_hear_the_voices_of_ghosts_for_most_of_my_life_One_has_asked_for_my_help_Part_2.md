As it turns out, trying to solve a murder using the ghost of the victim as a witness isn’t as easy as I thought. I mentioned it in my previous post, but her recollections of her last moments aren’t clear in the slightest.

She remembered most of the hike. She remembered seeing three people on the trail. One couple, two separate men, and also a lone woman. That made five total people. Of those five people she recognized not a single one.

I wrote down descriptions of each.

The couple that she encountered was older. The man was stockier built but not out of shape. He was about 60 years old with white hair that contrasted his wife’s still faintly blonde hair that was put up into a bun.

One of the lone men appeared to be in his thirties with short brown hair, a goatee, and arms as hairy as a chimpanzee’s.

The other guy was younger. He was probably just out of college because he wore a brown and yellow UW hoodie. He kept the hood up, which concealed his hair color, but aside from that he had no distinctive features.

The woman was a young redhead who kept her hair in a tight ponytail. She didn’t wear any distinctive clothing like the last guy, only generic athletic pants and a blue tank top with a white windbreaker to cover it.

Unfortunately, none of the descriptions matched any of the people I remembered seeing on the trail that day. If one of them had, maybe we could have narrowed down the timeframe.

“When was the last time you checked your phone before the incident? That might narrow it down more than just that it happened in the morning.”

*I didn’t take my phone on the trail. I never do.*

I stopped myself from making the faux pas of telling her how dangerous it was to do that because that advice was literally less than useless now. She seemed to come to the same conclusion by finishing her thoughts with,

*Well I never did, I should say.*

A knocking at my door made me look up from the notepad I was writing the descriptions on. I was frozen. I didn’t want to move. The knocking continued louder, accompanied by a yelling voice that I could not quite understand.

Hesitantly, I got up from my seat in my home office to check the front door. I looked through the peephole to see a police officer. A woman with blonde hair bound tightly into a bun. She called out again, asking if I was home.

I opened the door and asked her what she needed.

A few questions. Just a few questions which turned into a ride to the police station and before I knew it, I was sitting alone in an interrogation room. Not one like what you would see in a tv show, but more like a room the size of a walk-in closet with a single table and two chairs.

The lady had left me in the room with nothing but a cup of black coffee which I was not particularly keen on. That didn’t stop me from drinking it, though, as the nerves of suddenly being taken to a police station had made me jittery and fidgety. I knew there were probably a few officers watching me on camera looking like a nervous wreck.

No doubt my jitteriness had caused me to look more guilty about finding a body on the side of a trail. Maybe it made my story about only calling once I got home seem more suspect. The more I dwelled on the thought of myself looking guilty the more nervous and unstable I got and the more guilty I made myself appear. It was a cruel, cruel cycle.

The cycle was broken when the blonde woman reappeared at the door. She held her own cup of coffee in one hand and a clipboard in the other.

She greeted me by name as she sat down.

“Am I being interrogated?” I asked.

“Woah, there. Calm down, okay. I’m just here to ask you a few questions.”

A million thoughts ran through my brain about how I should ask for a lawyer or ask to leave or if I’m under arrest or whatever or whatever. What my dumb ass ended up saying was,

“I don’t wanna sound guilty.”

My face immediately flushed. The lady looked at me for a moment with squinted eyes.

“Sorry,” I said. “I’m not really very good at talking to people. I never have been and I just don’t want to be implicated with committing murder.”

“Who said anything about murder?” she asked.

Oh fuck, I thought. I forgot that the body was reported as being a victim of an animal attack. I couldn’t exactly explain to the officer that the ghost of the dead body had followed me home and specifically told me that she was murdered.

“The body?” I said, doing my best to sound ignorant. “The one I found. Wasn’t it a murder?”

“Tell me again how you found the body. You said on the phone call to 911…”

She looked through a transcript of the call on her clipboard.

“You said the body was off the side of the trail and you passed it going by.”

Once again her gaze was on me. Her eyes stared into mine, causing me to break eye contact almost instantly.

“We couldn’t find the body on the side of the trail. The body was pretty far off the trail actually. I was just wondering how you were able to stumble across it so easily when you weren’t looking for it. Especially since we couldn’t find it for a good while with so many people very actively searching it out.”

I wanted to tell her, oh yeah I was just walking when I heard the ghost of the dead body call out to me so it was pretty easy to find.

“The smell,” is what I actually said. “I smelled it. Must have been caught by the wind.”

“Interesting,” the lady bemused. “I don’t usually go searching for the sources of awful smells. To each their own, I suppose.”

“I just had a feeling. I just felt that something was off.”

With a final scribble of notes on her page, she got up, said goodbye and told me to hang around a bit longer.

I wanted to demand I be let go. I wanted to just get up and leave on my own. But the nerves kept me glued to the chair. The nerves were awful and only got worse when I saw who came in the room next. A man in his thirties. His jaw was covered in the scruff of a brown goatee. And once he sat down across from me, I confirmed it. Hairy arms just like a chimpanzee.

“What’s wrong, darlin’? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I snorted at the irony.

He stared at me. He dared me to look him in the eyes but I refused to.

“You’re a pretty little thing aren’t you?” He said. “I bet you couldn’t hurt a fly even if you wanted to.”

“I could hold my own,” I said, shyly.

“Could you? I don’t think you killed that girl. She was a pretty little thing just like you. But you know what? She couldn’t defend herself when the time came. I don’t think you could either.”

“I—”

“Take a look at that,” he interrupted. He slid a photograph across the table. It was of the young woman who had been slaughtered. An image of the spirit I had talked to in my home.

“Poor little, Alice. She should be a reminder to you, huh. A reminder that pretty little things can get hurt. That they do get hurt pretty often now.”

“What are you saying?”

For once I looked into his eyes. His beady, cold eyes.

“Maybe you should be thankful that we’re here to help you. Otherwise what’s stopping that thing from coming after you too?”

“I’d like to leave.” I demanded. “I have rights and I’d like to leave.”

“Sure, darlin’. I’ll drive you home.”

My heart sank. Whatever happened, I did not want that man finding out where I lived.

“No. I want the other lady to take me.”

“She’s off the clock, sweetheart. It’s either me, or a long walk.”

It’s a good thing I’m a hiker. It’s a good thing because that creep was right about one thing; it was a very long walk back home. The misty mountain air had turned into a light rain with sweeping gusts.

I kept the hood of my windbreaker up, and did not put in my airpods. I wanted to be completely aware of my surroundings. I checked every car that drove by. My heart sank every time the noise of one crept up.

I saw nobody the entire way home. I was almost relieved until when I got to my front door, I heard the ghost of Alice say to me,

*That’s him. That’s the guy.*

I looked over my shoulder and saw him.

Inside of a silver car on one end of my cul-de-sac stared back the familiar beady eyes of the police officer from the station.

He waved with a wicked smile. Then he drove away.

I locked my door immediately. I checked every window. Eventually I started crying on the couch clinging to a kitchen knife in one hand and my phone in the other.

I didn’t know what to do. Who do you call when the person hunting you is the police?

Only then did I realize how dangerous this had become. As Alice tried to comfort me, I wondered,

How long until I end up like her?
