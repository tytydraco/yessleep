   

I arrive at the bus stop as fog starts to roll in, darkening the sky and casting an eerie light over everything. Fretting, hastily dressed, Iâ€™m already running late for my job interview. I slide onto the empty bench and check my phone, only to find that the battery has died. I curse under my breath, feeling more and more stressed with each passing minute.

The fog starts to thicken, encasing the area in a shroud of white and gray. Soon it becomes so dense that I can't see more than a few inches in front of me. I can hear the sounds of traffic and people passing by, but they're muffled and distant, as if they're happening in another world.

I stand up and try to see if I can make out the bus stop sign, but I can't. It's as if I'm in a dream, or a nightmare. I can hear the sound of the bus, its engine rumbling in the distance, but I can't see it. I call out, but my voice is swallowed up by the fog. I'm alone, lost in this dense, white haze.

Suddenly, I hear a sound that chills me to the bone. A soft, guttural growling, like something is lurking in the fog. I start to panic, my heart racing as I try to find a way out. I take a step forward, but I can't see anything, and I almost trip over a curb. The growling grows louder, and I realize that whatever it is, it's getting closer.

I try to run, but I can't see where I'm going. I trip and fall, hitting my head and blacking out. When I come to, I'm lying on the ground, and the growling has stopped. I sit up and look around, but the fog is even denser now, and I can't see anything. I'm alone, lost in this white, swirling murk.

I don't know how much time has passed, but eventually I hear the sound of the bus, its engine getting louder and louder. I call out, but my voice is still silenced by the fog. The bus stops inches away from me, and I scramble to get on, grateful for the safety and warmth inside. As the bus pulls away, I look out the window, but I can't see anything. The fog has swallowed everything up, and I'm left alone with my thoughts, wondering what was out there, waiting for me in the fog.

I look around the empty bus and break out in a cold sweat. I'm alone, completely alone, on this bus with no driver and no passengers. I try the doors, but they won't budge. I bang on the windows, trying to get someone's attention, but they don't break. I'm alone in this moving tomb.

Panic sets in as I realize that the bus is accelerating, speeding through the fog with no one to control it. I can feel the fear rising in my chest, and I try the doors again, but they won't open. I'm trapped, hurtling towards who knows where, with no way to escape.

I try to calm myself down, but it's no use. I can feel the bus getting faster and faster, and I can hear a sound, like a voice, speaking softly in the darkness. I can't make out what it's saying, but it's like a whisper in my ear, urging me to give up.

I scream and pound on the windows, but they won't break. I'm trapped, hurtling through the fog, with no way to escape. I close my eyes and pray for a miracle, but the bus just keeps moving, getting faster and faster, until everything goes black.

I come to, once again sitting on the bench at the bus stop. The fog has lifted, and the sky is a brilliant blue. 

As I walk away, I suddenly realize that I've changed. I'm no longer the person I once was. I've transformed into a monster, just like the one I encountered in the fog. I look down at my hands and see that they're twisted and gnarled. I feel a powerful urge to hunt, to kill. The bus stop, the city, everything I thought was real, is slipping away from me. I'm trapped in a world of darkness and terror, and I don't know if I'll ever escape. I'll be hunting, killing, for eternity.

Terrified, I run away, praying that the fog returns and I can disappear. Forever.
