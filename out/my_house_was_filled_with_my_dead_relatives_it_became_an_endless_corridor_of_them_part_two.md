so here’s a little bit of background/context, i had undergone a really strange experience. something so strange, something that doesnt happen to anyone else but me, i had woken up one morning to all my family ever dating back to… forever. All fine and in normal condition. I presume how they were before they died. i woke up again to a long corridor with sludgy green walls and with all of my family once again where i was ambushed by a demon. But i stood out his way and he ran down the corridor missing me (his target). I had “saved my families souls” or so i thought. so here we go. 

it was a long time since it had all happened. But I had forgotten none of it. I still remembered every minute detail. But it didn’t really affect me. I just remembered it but it didnt traumatise me because i thought it was all over, but yesterday morning, when I woke up. I opened my eyes and infront of me i saw an old television, so old it was still square shaped. but what was odd was i didnt buy this television, nor had i ever seen it before. It just appeared. i walked up towards the television and looked at it, there was nothing suspicious about it but i heard a noise, it was static but there was nothing to indicate the television was on, a few seconds later it hac turned on, and text started appearing letter by letter with the same static noise but more… demonic. the first message read. “Hello friend or expirement subject, which ever one you prefer. you will not know who i am but i know who you are. And you know exactly what this is.” I sat infront of it panicked yet eagerly waiting to see what would happen next. More text slowly appeared. “You thought you were the hero, you thought you had solved it all. the message was wrong, that was only phase one.” I thought it would read something else but everything stopped. The noise, the messages. It was all done.

I thought it may have taken at least a few days for something to happen. But immediately after a felt a shift in pressure. I ran out into the hallway. I went to run downstairs, but there was no downstairs. My house was falling in on me and i saw nothing around it, it was all darkness around before I fell into the big pit of darkness

For a second i felt the fall. The next i didnt. And once again was that television. That darn television once again right infront it me. No static this time. The message on the television was long and clear. “I wont waste your time. I dont have time to waste this must be done immediately. It has been awhile since i last challenged you and since then I have planned my next one for you. I have taken the souls of your family and made them into something you don’t want. You may see nothing now, you will soon.”

The television beamed up into the air through a bright white light. But there was nothing to come for me. I was trapped here and i had to wait and discover my fate. I saw a beaming red light this time, It came closer and it was a pair of eyes, and then, i saw more, and more and more and they just kept on coming. they all circled me. one stepped forward to show the whole figure. I couldn’t work out who it was and definitely not when they ran into me. I fell to the ground but i felt a difference in power, i had collected their soul. And they all came closer towards me. They ran into me in unison. I blacked out and awoke. Not where i was. I was on a platform holding onto dear life half connected to a bridge but I felt so strong. I had collected all their souls. Their anger. Their rage from their torture from whoever this demon was. Before i could even collect my thoughts there was a huge thump. I went out for a few seconds before awakening again. It was a very large, unhuman figure with big bright orange eyes staring into your soul. 

Its voice… was static, I couldn’t believe it but i could just make out what it was saying. “Tis is an end, you not be making it to next phase.” But in my head, i heard voices, they all said “Its go time, make phase three” i had lost control and i had started running towards the figure. The anger and rage managed to defeat it. It went away in the same white light the television went away in. So did I. I awoke in my bed. I have sat there since wondering what phase three may contain. honestly. i dont even want to take part in it. i loved those in my family who i knew very dearly. But they are gone. And im not sure if my struggles are worth it. I have been through enough. And who knows if there will be a phase four or phase five or however many. Whose to say this will ever end. What if i am being played. And what i am doing all this for? To free souls of dead family members? how can there be a phase three. when i killed the main guy? so many questions that wont be answered. Last time i didnt know there was something next so i could take it easy then but now. Threre will be sleepless nights thinking about whats next. I’m not ready, i just wish it would end, no matter how it ends, even if that means me dying, no ending is bad at this point. But i should really get some sleep, so i will leave you all for now but i will be back to tell you about phase three. hopefully it goes well.
