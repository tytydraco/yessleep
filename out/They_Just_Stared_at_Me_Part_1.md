A few days ago, I walked into work thinking it was just going to be a normal Wednesday.  Now I’m stuck in this building still unsure of what really is happening all around me.  The internet still works, phone lines work, but when I try to call anybody, even 911, the line just stays ringing.  All texts just stay sending and never seem to go through.  All I can think of to do now is to record what I saw day by day until now. 

 

**DAY 1**

I arrived to work on a bright sunny day pulling up to the three hundred thousand square foot warehouse.  I worked in a cubicle in the business office, I was just an analyst ready to get his 8 hours over with.  The warehouse floor was most likely alive with forklifts rolling and conveyors buzzing, but I honestly never had to go out on the floor with the operations team much these days. 

 

As soon as I got out of my car in the parking lot, I was startled by the feel of a firm hand that grasped my shoulder.  I turned around quickly to find a tall man staring at me coldly.  A black eye patch covered his right eye, he wore a black leather overcoat and black pants with a white knit shirt that stuck out from the dark contrast.  He was a big guy, about 6’3, with olive skin and dark hair, something straight out of a mob movie, but that one cold eye that stared at me just made me feel uneasy. 

 

“I came to invite you into the light of the Lord.”  He said with almost no expression on his face. 

 

“Let me save you the time, I don’t believe in God.”  I quickly said as I grabbed my backpack hurrying to get away from this guy.

 

“Who said anything about God?”  He said with a slight grin forming on his face.

 

I turned to start walking to the front office, but I heard him say one last thing as his words faded in the distance growing between us.

 

“I am brother Tobias, when you reconsider, I’ll be close by.”

 

I could still picture that sadistic grin on his face as I hurried to put distance between us.  There were rumors of a cult that operated around the local area, but I never actually thought it was anything more than some drunk local gossip.  Feeling un easy about the whole encounter, I made a mental note to let security know once I got into the building. 

 

 

I walked through the front part of the main office first, a room with large see through glass walls that stuck out like some glass box attached to the rest of the building.  Inside was a receptionist desk and a small lounge area with couches and chairs on the far right.  Straight through the door past the receptionist desk was my cubicle, right in the middle of a windowless bull pen of more cubicles with no privacy.  The walls overlooking the bullpen were lined with doors to the corporate managers individual offices, always kept shut while they most likely did jack shit with their day.

 

The bullpen was always roaring with the sound of keyboards being pecked, people yelling on their phones and conference call voices echoing through the computer screens.  The noise drove me crazy, but I learned to cope with it, at least the pills I was able to get a hold of seemed to desensitize me from the vibrations in the atmosphere.  I put my backpack down in my chair and set up my laptop for the day in my cubicle.  I got up to get a cup of coffee, and that’s when shit started to get really fucked up.

 

I stood waiting for the final drops of coffee to fill my cup from the machine in the corner of the bullpen, I knew something was wrong while my back was turned to everyone.  It was peaceful, silent, not even a pin drop could be heard, and that was the problem that froze me still in fear.  The noise all suddenly stopped. 

 

I was afraid to turn around, but it was inevitable.  I grabbed my coffee cup and sipped it to let the hot liquid pour down my throat, hoping I was in some dream that I would just snap out of.  Unfortunately, shaky hands caused me to drop the cup, the liquid burned my hand as I felt the heat lick my exposed skin reminding me that this was reality. 

 

I turned around and saw everyone in the office standing up facing me, and they were all just fucking staring at me.  All 40 or so people in that bullpen, just staring, no expressions on their face, blank emotionless gazes radiating on me.  They all began walking backwards until they formed a single file line, then they all walked backwards in a perfect formation out the door to the front office.

 

I was left alone in the windowless bull pen room.  My paranoia and anxiety took over, and I couldn’t bring myself to leave the room.  I went into one of the mangers offices and locked the door behind me after shutting it.  I figured if this was some sick joke or something, I would hear a knock at the door or something eventually, a laugh or some kind of noise.  It never came, and at some point, I just passed out in the chair. 

 

**DAY 2**

 

I snapped out of a sleep to be met with the same fear and anxiety I briefly slipped away from for a few hours.  I checked the clock on my cell phone, 6am it read.  I tried calling everyone in my contact list but nobody picked up.  Every text message I tried to send just stayed stuck on sending status. 

 

I had to leave the bullpen at some point, I was just afraid of what I was destined to see.  After a couple hours spent just staring at the locked office door, I knew there was no way to slow play this.  I just had to rush out and see what happened to everyone.

 

I opened the door to the office I was in and was met with the same empty room where everything was just as silent as I left it.  I made my steps up to the door leading to the glass walled front office and pushed the door open. 

 

Normally, when you stood in front office, you could see easily about a mile in each direction of the glass walls.  The road to the left side, and all the warehouses that sat directly across from it in a type of massive cul-de-sac.  The parking lot through the front and its massive stretch, and miles of farmland to the right. 

 

I couldn’t see as much when I walked in, I just saw people standing outside the glass walls.  There were way more than the 40 coworkers I had standing outside those glass walls, there were hundreds on hundreds standing in perfect formation for columns stretching for what seemed like an endless eternity.  I was confused, dazed and just all around lost as to what to make of any of this. 

 

I walked to the left side of the room, and saw every head turn to keep their eyes fixed on me all at once.  If I walked to the furthest right of the room, heads turned to follow my every motion.  They had no expression in their faces, they just stared. 

 

A rush of emotions started to hit me all at once, tears formed in my eyes as a thousand questions filled my mind.  I walked up to the glass wall closest to me, the thickness of it being all that separated me from the massive number of people fixated on me with blank gazes.  I was an atheist all my life, but the only thing that slipped out of my mouth was the question “Am I in hell?” 

As soon as the words left my mouth, the face closest to me through the glass, an older woman I had worked with, suddenly smiled as wide as she could.  Her old features suddenly filled to life with a playful happiness as she grabbed what looked like a pocketknife from inside her jacket.  She slit her right wrist and put it up to the glass writing the words in her own blood that said NO GOD. 

 

I panicked and stumbled away from the glass, tripping and hitting my head on the secretary’s desk behind me.  Grabbing my head as the pain rushed through me, I screamed at the top of my lungs “WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT!!!!”. 

 

The old lady, still standing there, put her bleeding wrist back up to the glass and wrote out the word YOU.  Still smiling, she put the knife up to her throat and cut it from left to right.  The smile never left her face as she fell to the ground.  Two people standing in column directly behind her, completely expressionless, pulled her lifeless smiling body by the legs.  People quickly stepped to the side as they pulled her deeper into the columns, stepping back into perfect formation as they passed. 

 

I quickly ran back into the windowless bullpen, back into managers office and locked the door.  Hunger and thirst were starting to kick in on top of the sheer terror running through me.  I’ll have to find what supplies I can at some point, water and snacks people left around.  If I am still alive by tomorrow, I’ll post whatever happens to me if I’m still alive.
