I've been in the middle of this field surrounded by the forest for a long time, and a light wind has been blowing and no birds were singing which meant the thing was close. As I readied my old m-48 and turned the safety off.The men in black didn't like that I used this gun. They always said it was out of date and inadequate for my job, offering me other more advanced rifles. But I always turned them down. This old m-48 was reliable and had served me well over the years. I took a long breath as I prepared to fight with a creature that you would only see in nightmares. This wasn't my first job but I'm becoming too old for this.  

The creature I was supposed to eliminate was some sort of monster that was part of the local folklore. As I look at the file that was given to me by the men in black. The creature was a humanoid resembling a bald man who walked on all fours and was so thin that his ribcage was visible. The locals called him the Laughing Demon. The few surviving victims recounted that they heard an evil laugh coming from the woods before being attacked by the creature. It killed several people over the years including a few kids who were exploring the woods at night. 

The government always covered up these incidents by claiming that were bear attacks. As for the survivors of these attacks, their memories were wiped, and they were told how they survived a bear attack.

I usually don't get personally invested in these jobs but I just think of those poor kids who were killed by this creature. The CSIs could hardly gather what was left of them so they could identify them. I couldn't wait to return this creature to hell.

I started hearing laughing in the distance, it was coming from the forest. And then I heard it run as it broke branches and stepped over leaves revealing its movement. It was running around me just behind the tree line of the footrest as I stood in the middle of the field. I was slightly shaking as its laughing increased. I tried my best to stay calm. I followed the creature with the barrel of my rifle.

It was moving fast like a horse. As it ran around, it decided to rush towards me. I saw the creature now in full. It had this disturbing grin on its face as it charged at me. I waited until it came closer I only had enough time for one good shot.

As the creature dashed towards me, I aimed for its head and pulled the trigger.

The loud bang from my rifle echoed in the forest, and the laughing stopped. I thought I got it but to my horror, it was still alive. The bullet hit its lower body, and its legs went limp on the ground.The creature was standing on its arms as the lower part off it's bony body and legs were incapacitated .

 It must have tried to pounce on me right before I fired. Blood was gushing out of its lower body but it didn't seem to care about the damage it had received it was still grinning. It seems to not feel pain I thought. It was too close to me to have time to reload and fire my rifle as it swiped its claws at me. I reeled back to try to avoid the strike but it managed to get my chest.I felt its claws digging into my chest and cuting my flesh.

Luckily I was wearing a kevlar vest but it only minimized the damage as it still managed to cut though it and make contact with my flesh.I was on the ground my chest hurting i could feel  blood streaming down my torso.The fear of death was racing through my mind as I lay on the ground with the pain and blood streaming down my torso from the creature's claws, and I felt a terrifying sense of helplessness and vulnerability as I realized that I could die right here.

I stood up and pulled out my dagger,it was given to me by the men in black ,long ago back when i started out in this calling,it was made out of some kind of meteorite.

Adreneline pumped through me as i Ina single motion slashed at  the creature's arms before stabbing it through its jaw.It fell on the ground. I immediately cut off it's head . It was a safety precaution as some creatures won't stay down until there head is cut off.And I didn't want it to rise up again and get a jump on me. My hands were shaking as i put my dagger back in its sheath.The adrenaline was starting to wear off.That damm thing almost got me.I took a sip of my water to calm myself down.

I called the men in black over to come pick up the body.And in about half an hour I heard a helicopter.And saw  it over me as it landed on the field a couple of agents in hazmat suits jumped out and put the creature in body bag and loaded it on the helicopter and flew away. 

I managed to patch myself up with some bandages and first-aid supplies, but I was still in pain and feeling exhausted. The thought of more work ahead was weighing on my mind as I headed home, but I had to keep going. I knew that my job was never done.
