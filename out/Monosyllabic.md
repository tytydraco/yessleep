It was a random Tuesday night — probably the most random day for this incident to have taken place. I had just left my uncle’s house; it was his birthday, and we’d had a late-night party at his place. I didn’t drink any alcohol since I knew I’d be driving back home. There was no way I’d be staying there until past midnight, let alone overnight.

Family functions with my family have always been a bit odd. Everyone gets drunk way too quickly, which completely ruins any fun. Half the time, they can’t even say a proper sentence back to you.

As I was saying, I had just left the party and was now driving home. I lived about 30 minutes away from my uncle’s house, and honestly, I don’t even know why I bothered going in the first place. My uncle lives in a peculiar part of the city — extremely rural. No big buildings, no streetlights, only one or two cars passing every few minutes.

I was half-texting my cousin, who didn’t attend the party because he knew how useless it would be. I was telling him how boring it was, as usual, and he replied saying he’d probably never attend another family party again. I was about to send him another message when I looked up from my phone and through the windshield.

There, on the side of the road… sat a woman.

She was facing me, sitting cross-legged. I stopped the car. It was such an odd sight. Seeing anyone out here was unusual, especially at this time of night. There wasn’t even a path where she was sitting. She would’ve had to walk through the forest behind her or down the road itself, which was incredibly dangerous.

I don’t even know why I stopped. I should’ve just kept driving. I just looked at her — not pulling up closer, not saying anything — just sitting there in the middle of the road.

The woman was still facing my way, and I could make out a few details. She was wearing a dark green dress. Her hair looked soaking wet, even though it wasn’t raining. And she was barefoot.

There was something clearly off about her. I didn’t know whether I should say something or just drive away. It was already extremely awkward just staring at her from inside my car, so I decided to pull up beside her and ask if she needed a ride or something.

I rolled down the window slowly. She didn’t look up. She was still staring at the same spot where I’d first stopped my car. I leaned closer and asked if she was okay. No response.

I asked again if she needed a ride home. Nothing. I was halfway rolling up the window to leave when she spoke, in an incredibly soft, quiet voice:

“Could you bring me home.”

I really wished I hadn’t asked her anything at that point. I just wanted to go on, but I still had to get myself out of this situation, so I asked her where she lived.

She didn’t answer right away. She just sat there, still facing the spot on the road where my car had first stopped. I could barely hear her breathing, but I could tell she was. Her shoulders moved just slightly. It was almost like she was thinking about what to say next — or like she’d forgotten how to speak altogether.

“Where do you live?” I asked again, a little quieter this time.

Then she turned her head. Not fast — just slow, as if the motion itself took effort. Her face looked pale, almost gray in the light of my headlights. Her eyes didn’t quite meet mine. They seemed to look just a little past me, at something inside the car.

“It’s not far,” she said. “Just down the road.”

I nodded, even though something in me didn’t want to agree to that. I don’t know what made me do it — maybe guilt, maybe curiosity, or that weird human instinct that makes you do the exact thing you know you shouldn’t. I unlocked the doors.

“You can get in,” I said.

She stood up slowly. Her dress looked heavier now that she was standing — like it was soaked through. She walked around the front of the car without looking at me once. Her bare feet made no sound on the gravel. When she opened the passenger door, the smell hit me. It wasn’t strong, but it was strange — like old wood and rainwater and something faintly metallic.

She sat down without saying a word. I didn’t know what to do with the silence that followed. I started driving.

The road stretched out in front of us, dark and narrow. The only light came from my headlights, cutting through the fog that had started to gather. She didn’t give me any directions. She just stared out the windshield, hands folded in her lap, whispering something I couldn’t quite hear.

I turned the radio on, just to fill the space. Static. Every station was static. I turned it off again.

“How far down the road?” I asked.

No response.

Then, after maybe a minute: “You’ll see it.”

I didn’t like that answer. I kept driving anyway.

After a while, the road started to look unfamiliar. I hadn’t noticed taking any turns, but the trees on either side seemed thicker now, taller. The asphalt looked more cracked. I slowed down.

And then she spoke again. “Here.”

I looked out the window but didn’t see anything — just trees and the faint outline of what might’ve been an old mailbox, rusted and bent.

“Where?” I asked.

She pointed, her hand trembling just slightly. “There. The house.”

There was no house.

Just a break in the trees and what looked like a faint path leading into the woods. I turned my headlights that way. The light caught on something for a second — a fence, maybe. Or what was left of one.

I looked back at her.

The seat was empty.

The door was closed.

I hadn’t heard it open.

I stopped the car and turned off the engine. The air felt heavier now — like the whole forest was pressing in around me. I just sat there, staring at the empty seat beside me, trying to make sense of it.

And then, from somewhere in the dark, through the trees, I heard that same soft voice.

“Could you bring me home?”
