For a few years now my buddy Anthony and I have jointly owned a cabin out in the Rocky Mountains. Every once in a while we’ll go up there and spend the weekend. We always end up doing the same few activities. After setting up we start a fire in the charcoal stove and make lunch. Then we hike down to the closest lake and go fishing. We’ve only ever caught one fish, Anthony claims he got it, but I definitely did. Before sunset, we hike back and retreat to our bedrooms. I usually read a Stephen King for a few hours until it pulls me to sleep. In the morning we make breakfast and pack up, leaving around noon.



Last month we decided to head up for the new year. Neither Anthony nor I had anything better to do. I woke up early that morning and put on heavy layers. Then, I grabbed a few granola bars for breakfast and prepared my bag. As I walked down my front steps, Anthony’s red pickup truck cut through the snow to park. His flatbed was filled with unevenly cut pieces of coffee brown wood with burgundy fillings. Next to the wood was a medium cardboard box. I put my backpack in the bed and hopped onto the leather of the passenger seat. He had the radio on playing our local rock station. Anthony took a sip of his thermos,



“You like the tunes?”



I let out a small chuckle. The music was something by Imagine Dragons that had come out a few years ago. We had always hated the overproduced music they made and joked about it whenever we heard it.



“What a song, this deserves all the Grammies.” I joked.



“No no, a few Nobel prizes are more appropriate.”



As we kept driving, the city around us started to thin as we approached the freeway. The fast food restaurants were replaced with pine trees and the skyscrapers turned to mountains. We had about 2 more hours of driving until we got up to the cabin. As we turned around a bend in the road, the radio station was drowned with static.



“Damn it. Could you find something else?” Anthony muttered.



I turned the knob for a few minutes getting nothing but static. Finally, after a minute or two, I found something local. The station played easy-listening music, something that you would hear in an elevator. Eventually, the music was cut off by the crooning voice of a host. He sounded like he was around 20 and had a slight drawl,



“Welcome to KWYU Mountain Mysteries. Today is our Bugfoot mystery hour, if you have any evidence of the Bugfoot call in at xxx-543-6846.” After he was finished the easy listening faded back in.



Anthony spoke jokingly, “The fuck is a Bugfoot?”



“A bunch of these areas have their own cryptid, it’s all just for tourism.”



After a few more minutes the smooth voice of the host returned,



“We have Randy from Bailey on the line, Randy what do you have for us today?”



An older man with a gravelly, northern accent spoke,



“Hello, I’ve lived in this area for a good long while now and have seen plenty of evidence for the Bugfoot, but the other night I saw him right in front of me.”



“Randy that sure is something, please, tell us what happened?”



“Oh it was horrible, I was out on my nightly smoke, the wife doesn’t want me smoking by the house, and I was walking along the river. It must have been the dry season because I could not find that damn river. The woods have a way of tricking you, it all looked the same and I got lost. Once I realized I didn’t know those woods, I put out my smoke and looked for light. In the distance, I saw what looked like headlights sitting stationary. I assumed it must have been a car on the highway and thought I could hitchhike back to Bailey. 



Once I got about 100 feet away from the lights I noticed they were moving around oddly. I thought it must have been some kids screwing around with their car. Instead of hitchhiking, I thought I would just walk along the highway instead. As I got about 50 feet away I saw that the lights were too high off the ground to be headlights. I called out in their direction and the lights sped up the road faster than any car could.”



“And what do you think those lights were Randy?”



“They were the eyes of the Bugfoot of course. He has giant bright eyes that can blind you if you get too close. Everybody knows that.”



“Thank you, Randy.”



Randy hung up.



“Well folks, what do you think? Was that the Bugfoot, or just some kids screwing around?” he chuckled.



A different easy listening came on, it was older and sounded like something you would hear on the weather channel.



“Bugfoot, that's some bullshit.” Anthony snickered,



“Oh definitely, it's not even creative, Bigfoot but he’s a bug. Every weird part of the country wants their own Bigfoot, or Loch Ness Monster, or Mothman.”



“Are they even trying though, they could have at least made the name something better than just a play on Bigfoot”



The easy listening was cut,



“Welcome back, we have Linda from Buffalo Creek on the line, Linda what do you got?”



A 40ish-year-old woman with a shrill voice came on the line,



“The Bugfoot was trying to get into my house the other day.”



“That sure sounds scary Linda, whats your story.”



Anthony joked quietly, “It sure sounds true.”



The woman started,



“I was coming back home from emptying our latrine in the lake when I saw something outside my house.”



I shuddered and hoped that Linda’s lake was nowhere near ours.



“The sun had almost set by then so I couldn’t get a good look at it. From what I could see it was big and had brown smooth skin. Its face looked like a cricket’s but it was shaped like a man. Its head had two large black eyes and two long growths on the top. The arms didn’t end in hands, instead, it had two long hooked fingers. Its legs went backward then bent forwards at the knee and ended in one long foot.”



“Were its eyes bright like Randy said.”



“No, it’s eyes were a lifeless black.”



“Sorry to interrupt, continue.”



“It walked all around my house feeling the walls with its sickly long fingers. After a few minutes, it lost interest and retreated into the woods.”



“What do you think it was doing Linda?”



“It must have been trying to get in. It looked through the windows and tried to,,,”



“What did it do Linda?”



The host sounded slightly more serious. I can’t imagine he was actually sorry for her, more so, I think he wanted to pry her for more content.



“It tried to kick down the door. Even from as far away as I was, I could hear it pounding on that door. Thankfully it didn’t break.”



The host returned to a normal tone,



“Thank you, Linda, that's all we need.”



She hung up. The easy listening returned.



“Probably just some weirdo, definitely not Bugfoot” Anthony remarked.



We had gotten way deeper into the forest by then. When you’re driving through a wooded road there will usually be breakaways to people's private property. We always liked to point out the “Don’t trespass for your own good!” and “Stay off my property!” signs. At this depth, they were all gone and the road seemed to infinitely wind through the pine trees. That nut Randy was correct about one thing, the woods have a way of tricking you. The Rocky Mountain forests consisted of nothing but boulders, moss, and various pine trees. When that's all you see for hours your mind starts to get bored. If I lived there for years my mind would probably come up with a Bugfoot too. My thought was cut off by the return of the host.



 “Now we have…”



The host hesitated. After a few seconds, I could hear him stand up and walk away from the microphone, but I could still faintly hear him. He spoke much more casually,



“Hey, Beth, is the caller ID working? I can’t see this guy's name or where he is.”



He got a response that I couldn’t hear,



“Oh, um, I guess we’ll take the call then.”



He sat back down. The mixture of the winding woods and the uneasy speaking of the host brought out a deep unpleasant feeling within me.



“Hello caller what’s your story?”



The sounds that came out of the radio made me feel disgusting. The call had horrible quality, and the man's voice sounded pained like every word was a shard of glass. And the crickets. The second they took the call, the sound of thousands of crickets filled my ears. But that should have been impossible, it was January, the crickets in this area should have been hibernating.



“The Bugfoot is out there.”



The host dropped his radio voice and now spoke slowly and uncomfortably, 



“Our audience knows that sir.”



“No! No! No! The real Bugfoot.”



“What?”



“The real Bugfoot doesn’t tap on windows or have headlight eyes, It’s a killer. I have lived in these woods for years and ain’t done anything to make it mad, until now. I’ve seen plenty of hikers get stalked by the Bugfoot. Only seen a few actually get killed. They always did something bad for the woods, lit too big a campfire, caught too many fish, whatever. I’d find them a few days later as a feast for the woods, beaten to death.”



“What the fuck are you talking about?”



“I’m talking about the truth. I’ve lasted longer than most, it’s been stalking me for about a week now. Don’t know what I did but the Bugfoot is after me.”



The crickets got louder. The sounds of their chirps mixed with the quality of the call was nauseating. The host spoke softly,



“Why do you think it’s stalking you?”



I heard a faint crash in the background of the call,



“Fuck. I-I know it’s been stalking me. When I forage I can hear it out there chirping in a low tone. When I sleep I can hear it walking on my roof. It’s been hunting me”



“What are you gonna do?”



“I’m trying to…”



Anthony turned off the radio. 



“Fuck man, I was interested in that.”



“That stuff hurt my ears so bad, I felt like driving off the road. Why do you wanna hear that crazy dude anyway? Are you scared the Bugman’s gonna get you” he teased,



“It was interesting, of course I don’t think the Bugfoot is real.

	

Finally, we pulled into the clearing where our cabin rested. Its old, barely shingled roof sagged tiredly, while the old logs looked like they would support them forever. It had snowed recently, the ground was covered in patches of starch-white snow. Intermittently throughout the snow were patches of soft, brown mud. We acted like the place was a minefield, avoiding stepping in or dropping anything in the mud like it would blow our legs off.  As I was grabbing my stuff, I noticed the cardboard box again.



“What's in the box?”



“A little New Year surprise. At sundown, I’ll bring it out.”



The inside of the cabin was just as cozy as it always was. Once the fire was set in the stove, the warmth filled each room slowly. There was a redundant painting over my bed that showed a temperate forest similar to the one we had just driven through. I put my bags under my bed before I heard Anthony in the other room,



“What’d you bring for lunch.”



“A bunch of stuff for a Dutch lunch.”



“The fuck is a Dutch lunch?”



“Sandwiches stupid.” I joked.



I pulled out a bag of cold cuts, cheeses, sauces, and vegetables along with a loaf of bread.



“I went to a breakfast place in Pueblo a little bit ago that served this.”



We ate for about an hour, reading our respective books. After eating we went down to the lake to fish. The entire time I couldn’t stop myself from imagining the mystical Bugfoot just behind the treeline. I was so deep in the daydream that I didn’t even notice when I got a bite. I unfortunately lost it.



As we got back to shore Anthony had to put together his tackle box just right. While I waited for him to finish I noticed something in the gravel. There were long, deep impressions going down the lakeside. They were thin and ended in a sharp point. Interestingly, the back end of each depression was deeper than the front, as if someone shoved a board into the ground and let it fall. Within each imprint were what I thought were clear brown nuts or seeds. Only now, after doing research, do I realize what they were. Cricket shells.



It was almost nightfall when we got back, so Anthony revealed his New Year surprise. It was a few Roman candles and one of those massive sparklers with a name in Chinese.



“I didn’t want to do nothing for New Years, so I brought up these.”

 

“Haven’t you heard all those stories about people starting forest fires from stuff like this?”



Anthony knelt down and pushed on the soil.



“You couldn’t burn down shit in these conditions.”



“I guess you’re right.”



We made dinner of hot dogs and smores then set up to light the fireworks. It was beautiful. We only lit two of the Roman candles because we realized how boring they were, but the sparkler. The sparkler went on for five minutes, it had all sorts of colors and arrangements that amazed me. Although, when the spectacle ended, all I could think about was what that man said on the radio.



“...lit too big a campfire, caught too many fish, whatever…”



Anthony must have been distracted too, because while watching he accidentally bumped into the bed of his truck and all of our firewood rolled into the mud.



“God damn it.” he exclaimed. It seemed like all his excitement was let out at the same time he spoke.



“It’s okay dude, I can drive into town and buy some more.”



“No, No, I’ll go, don’t you remember how bad the roads were coming up? And besides, I don’t want you getting anywhere near the driver's seat of my truck.” The fun seems to have lept back into him.



I stood there until I couldn’t see his brake lights among the pines marching along the Rocky Mountains. Only when everything was still did I notice the ambient sound around me. Chirps.



The fire was on its last leg, what was once a bright summer yellow had become a deep crimson. I decided to read my book by the fire til it died, then I would see if any of the logs were salvageable and throw them in. Unfortunately, I could barely focus on the story, I think it was something about vampires, but my eyes kept drifting up to the window in front of me. The moon was shrouded by clouds and the window was usually completely dark, the silhouette of the trees being the only sight that broke through. Every once in a while the clouds would give way and the light of the moon would faintly light the treeline and path towards the cabin.



Just like at the lake, I couldn’t stop imagining Bugfoot behind the trees, but this time it was real. Every time the light revealed itself, if only for a moment, I thought I could see the outline of a dark figure. It disappeared so fast I’m unable to describe it, but it was there. At some point, I looked back down at the page and realized I couldn’t read. The fire died. I looked into the window. Darkness. The treeline was just barely visible, and the pile of wood was just out of sight.



I slowly reached for the doorknob, it was rusty and felt impossibly cold. At the sound of the first wooden creak, the cold winter air hit me like a thousand metal pins.  I only stepped close enough to examine the wood, but as soon as I left the safety of the doorframe, I felt an acute feeling of being watched. It felt like the whole forest was staring at me, hungrily. From my distance, some of the wood looked mostly clean; the wood at the top of the pile had barely touched the mud.



I took another step then stopped. Now that I was wholly out of the cabin, my senses could fully take in the black void around me. The chirping. It was gone. While I was reading, the crickets chirped non-stop, but now they were gone. I should have felt relief, but I couldn’t. It didn’t feel like they stopped because they left, it felt like when a predator goes completely still before pouncing. I walked as quickly and quietly as I could and grabbed the closest logs. When I had grabbed enough I looked up. My eyes had adjusted, I could distinctly see the clearing around me. Pressed deep into the mud in front of me were those long, thin tracks.



I ran back into the cabin, slamming the door with a force that felt like it would break the frame of its hinges. As soon as the door was closed the crickets started up again. Chirp. Chirp. Chirp. It sounded like there were thousands all around the cabin, taunting me. I covered my ears, but couldn’t keep out the nauseating cries. I threw the logs on the fire, trying to create something to drown out the cacophony around me. But it didn’t work. I fell to the floor keeping my ears as close to the fire as possible without burning my hair off. Trying to use the crackles and pops to drown out the shrill singing around me. Then it stopped.



Only for a moment, I was gifted silence. Suddenly, a staccato pounding hit the roof. Something started walking atop the shingles. It sounded as if someone was walking very exaggeratedly. I could hear each distinct thud of the heel and toe. The toe hit was muffled, like there was less force put into it. I hastily, but silently, made my way to my bedroom and dropped to the floor. As I lowered myself, my knee gave out and hit the wood board below me with a forte thud. The stepping stopped. It heard me.



I dropped completely flat and slowly wriggled under the bed. I used my bags to create a barrier between me and the wall, blocking any sightline to me. The stepping didn’t return for the longest minute of my life. Abruptly, whatever was on the roof started pounding on the shingles. In between thumps, I could hear a few ceramic tiles fall into the snow. I couldn’t get a clear sightline of the roof, but I could tell it was giving way. Eventually, they gave way with a sickening creak. The logs that broke tumbled to the floor and rolled before settling. The fire was quickly snuffed out by the snow atop the roof quickly plunging to the floor. Silence. Silence returned to me, like an old friend.



The beast dropped down to the floor with an impossible lightness, its feet almost fluttering onto the wood. Its horrible feet. They were the color of autumn leaves and ended in downward hooked yellow points. They were long and impossibly smooth. It was segmented with sharp, yellowed spikes. It's all I could see of it. When it took its first step, I understood how it layed those tracks. All the force went down on the ball of the foot and the hooked “toe” fell to the ground with it. It walked frantically around looking for me. It made almost no sound beyond its steps and I couldn’t tell what it was doing. It knocked over everything it walked by as if it didn’t notice them. First a lamp, then a picture frame. It had no direction and didn’t spend any amount of time in any one place



Eventually, It made its way to where I was hiding. The monster’s smooth feet were now close enough to reach out and touch. I hoped to god it couldn’t smell me. It stepped even closer to the bed, then halted. Engine sounds. Anthony was driving back. I watched as the beast’s feet stopped, turned around,  then floated back through the hole with a sickening, reverberating buzzing sound. I stayed still for one more minute then jumped out from under the bed. I grabbed my bags and ran through the door, I went so fast I didn’t even notice when it began to snow. The cold, fluttering flakes mixed with the fresh tears and sweat on my face. 



I yanked on the car door throwing myself into the passenger seat.



“Turn around turn around.”



“Wha…” 



Anthony started to speak but then looked inside the cabin which now lay bare in the snow. He turned the truck around and sped back up the trail. We kept the radio off the entire drive. I still don’t have the willpower to tell Anthony what happened, but now I think I need to. I was planning on keeping this story to myself for the rest of my life, but now I can’t. I need help, last night it snowed and when I looked out my window the next morning I saw those same long, sharp tracks in my yard.
