I took the night security job at Mount Green University's Spring Hill Campus because I needed the money. Simple as that. The pay was decent, the hours worked with my class schedule, and how hard could it be watching over a few farm animals and a weather station?

I should have known something was off when they spent more time on the "rules" than actual job training.

Spring Hill Campus isn't like the main university. It's about twenty miles outside town, just the veterinary program's practical facilities - a few buildings, some pastures, stables, and that weather station sitting alone in the middle of a field. Across the street sits Mount Green Corrections, a medium-security prison that's been there since the 70s. The whole area feels isolated, especially at night.

My supervisor, Jane, was a no-nonsense woman in her mid-forties who'd worked campus security for six years. On my first day, she handed me a laminated card and told me to memorize it.

"These aren't suggestions," she said, watching me read. "Follow every single one, every single night. No exceptions."

The rules were:

**NIGHT SECURITY PROTOCOLS - SPRING HILL CAMPUS**

1. Always keep your radio on channel 2. If you come across a life or death situation, switch to channel 4.
2. The campus currently has six pigs, three horses, and three cows. Always do a head count during evening rounds.
3. Always lock the gate to the weather station.
4. There is no scarecrow in the weather station field. Go inside immediately if you see one.
5. All animals are to be inside by 9pm. If you hear any animals outside after this time, ignore them.
6. Do not take the dirt road from the weather station to the stables anytime after 11pm. Stick to the path with the lamps.
7. If you hear a window break near the stables, immediately recount the animals.
8. DO NOT use the bathroom next to the stables. You are not safe there.
9. If you think that one of the animals escaped somehow, leave it. It's probably not one of ours. Rule 6 applies here as well.
10. Our horses love alfalfa treats. Feel free to give them one per night! If they don't eat them, immediately lock yourself in the security office.

"What's with rule 4?" I asked. "Why would there be a scarecrow?"

Jane's expression didn't change. "There wouldn't be. That's the point."

"And rule 8? What's wrong with the bathroom?"

"Just follow the rules, Marcus. They exist for good reasons."

I wanted to ask more questions, but something in her tone told me the conversation was over.

My first night started quietly enough. I arrived at 10pm, did the evening walkthrough Jane had shown me, and settled into the small security office in the main building. The horses - Titus, Belle, and Daisy - were happy to see me and eagerly accepted their alfalfa treats. Good sign, according to rule 10.

At 11:30pm, I started my rounds. First stop: livestock count. Six pigs snoring in their pen, three horses drowsing in their stalls, three cows chewing cud. All accounted for.

Next was the weather station. It sat about 200 meters from the main buildings, surrounded by a chain-link fence in the middle of an open field. As I approached, my flashlight beam caught something that made my stomach drop.

The gate was standing wide open.

I stopped walking, suddenly very aware of how dark it was outside the small pool of light from my flashlight. Rule 3 was clear: always lock the gate. But it was already open, which meant either someone else had been here, or...

I swept my flashlight across the field beyond the weather station, and that's when I saw it.

A dark shape stood motionless about fifty yards into the field. Tall, thin, arms outstretched. Even from a distance, I could tell it wasn't quite right - too tall, too still, positioned at an odd angle.

Rule 4 flashed through my mind: *There is no scarecrow in the weather station field. Go inside immediately if you see one.*

My hands started shaking. I fumbled for my radio, but what would I say? "Hey, there's a fake scarecrow in the field like you said there might be?" That sounded insane even to me.

The shape hadn't moved, but I wasn't taking any chances. I backed away from the weather station, keeping my flashlight trained on the figure. It looked almost human from this angle, like someone standing with their arms spread wide. But the proportions were wrong somehow.

As I retreated, I realized I was heading toward the stables. The main building felt too far away, and I was starting to panic. Rule 8 said not to use the bathroom next to the stables, but surely hiding there for a few minutes was better than standing exposed in the open?

I made it to the stable building and found the small bathroom attached to the outside wall. The door was tucked into a shadowy alcove, partially hidden from view. I slipped inside and locked the door behind me.

Inside, I tried to steady my breathing. The room was cramped, with a small window that looked out toward the pasture. I pulled out my phone to call Jane, but there was no signal. Of course.

That's when I heard the footsteps outside.

Slow, deliberate, circling the building. Too heavy to be human, but with a strange, uneven gait. I crouched low beside the window and carefully peered out from the corner, staying in the shadows.

What I saw made my blood freeze.

A creature moved across the open ground near the stables, and it wasn't human. It stood upright like a person, but too tall - maybe seven feet - with a lean, muscular frame covered in dark fur. Its head was elongated, wolf-like but eerily uncanny, with ears that were too large and positioned far too low on its head. In the moonlight, I could see its eyes reflecting light as it turned its head, scanning the area.

The thing moved with a strange, loping gait, sometimes dropping to all fours before rising again to its full height. It was clearly searching for something - for me, I realized with growing horror.

It approached the window, and I pressed myself against the wall, heart hammering. From my position in the corner, I could see it but remain hidden in the shadows. The creature's snout had pressed against the glass, threatening to shatter it. I could see sickly, large red and yellow eyes darting around, but finding nothing. Its mouth hung open, revealing rows of sharp teeth that caught the light.

The thing tilted its head, studying the window with an intelligence that terrified me. It raised one clawed hand and tapped gently on the glass.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I couldn't move, couldn't breathe. The creature's mouth moved, and I heard muffled sounds through the glass - it was trying to mimic human speech, though the words were distorted and wrong.

Then sirens started wailing from across the street.

The thing's head snapped toward the sound, and in an instant, it was gone. I heard rapid footsteps - multiple sets - moving away from the building toward the road. Through the window, I could see searchlights sweeping the area around Mount Green Corrections.

I didn't waste time wondering what was happening at the prison. I burst out of the bathroom and ran for the main building, not stopping until I was inside the security office with every door locked.

I spent the rest of my shift in that office, jumping at every sound. When Jane arrived at 6am to relieve me, I was still clutching my flashlight.

"Everything okay?" she asked, though her tone suggested she already knew the answer.

"The weather station gate was open," I managed to spit out. "And there was... something in the field."

She went to the window and lit a cigarette. "Did you follow the rules?"

"Mostly. I used the bathroom by the stables."

Her face darkened. "Max, that rule exists for a reason. That bathroom has a window. Windows aren't safe after dark here."

"What the hell is going on? What *are* those things?"

She was quiet for a long moment. Finally, she said, "Get some rest. You'll be back tonight?"

"I... I don't know."

"The job pays well for a reason. Think about it."

As I drove home, I kept checking my mirrors. I needed the money - student loans weren't going to pay themselves. But did I need it badly enough to go back?

By 9pm, I was putting on my uniform again.

I told myself it was just the money. But deep down, I knew I had to understand what I'd seen. What were those things? How long had they been there? And why did Jane seem unfazed by everything I'd told her?

Tonight, I'd be more careful. I'd follow every rule exactly.

What could go wrong?
