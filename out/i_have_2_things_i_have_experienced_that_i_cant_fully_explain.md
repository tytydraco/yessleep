i live in a rural area of canada and the closest house or any building in general is roughly a 15 min drive. where this occurred happened to be surrounded  with lots trees and bushes  (almost forest like) and fields and there is also no way to be camping because my grandparents house and the surrounding area is privately owned.  grandparents left for a week  and left me to take care of the farm. i was 17 so i felt i had a grip on things.  So what happened is, i was my room was around 1-2  in the morning. i was playing a game online with my cousin who is in my 2nd story.  got up to go to the bathroom which is right beside my room.  once i go in i start to hear a faint laugh outside of my window. the window also faced the part of the bush area, and there was also a yard light which illuminated the trees 10 yards  deep. so i go and peak out my window and wait for roughly 2 minutes, at the same time while looking out it just felt odd because we never had anyone come out this far.  after the 2 min the laughing started while i was peaking outside, and just so happened to be in the dark where the light didnt reach. had a rifle but i just froze in fear. managed to grab the gun and shoot directly where the laughing was still coming from.  Another thing i wondered about is  why our dogs weren't barking and doing what their supposed to do.  after i shot the gun they still weren't barking and it  just was silent and very odd altogether.  told my grandparents but they said i was probably just tired and was hearing things. i really  don't know if that was a person because if it was they'd have to walk for over an hour through waist high grass, bushes and plants that give you a rash to be near the closest road.

the 2nd story occurred at my cousins house just a week after my experience at my grandparents house,

we both live in rural areas but he is not a farmer..

it is just me and him at the house drinkin and smoking weed. me and him  both kind of tipsy but not drunk, and are  just have a conversation when we both  started to hear this weird animal noise off in the distance,   his cats even heard it  and went directly near the sound.  the noise sounded weird like it was in pain or something. we weren't really scared by this noise, we were really wondering wtf kind of animal makes that sound.  as the noise got closer i told my cousin to grab the flashlight which was  inside and shine it near the area, which was just coming from the dark less than 40 yards away from us. once the light was near it i saw the glowing yellow green eyes.  the light wasnt bright enough to see the animal just only its eyes. the noise also stopped once he shined the light on it.  i then ask him  on why it looks so tall like in how its eyes were atleast over 7 feet above ground.   atp we started to get scared of this animal because of how it just sat their and watched us while we were sitting their talkin about it. after 4-5min of just it sitting there,  the animal started moving back into the direction it just came from. we sat their for another minute before going in  to go to sleep.  i honestly don't know what kind of animal that is over 7  feet tall and able to move almost silently on a gravel road. with that eyeshine too considering  we were in an area where we barely even see wild animals.

in the end these occurrences seemed so weird and out of place
