Ok so I read somewhere that writing down stories from your past in order to remember them is a thing. I have this hazy memory that I need to flesh out that happened right before my family moved away from the first house I ever lived in. It frightens me and I don't know why. Because I don't know what happened, if anything. So you see my predicament. The memory is there but it's like, blocked.

Anyway, let's give this a go then.

I was a young kid, ten. I had a brother, Jeremy, who was two years older. We used to go down into the basement which was cold because it was just the raw brick foundation, and this was Chicago so winters in the 90's were no joke. I mean today they're not peachy, but back then Snow Days were a given.

Anyway, we would go down there and play.

Legos, for one. You know, kids' multicolored plastic brick construction toys. Strewn about. We had the Monorail space set, and the Black Knights. We also had the first Nintendo. We played a hockey game that was literally called "Ice Hockey". It's like the gaming equivalent of that commenter who just has to say 'First!' on a Youtube video. "Ice Hockey"!

We had a Sega Genesis too. Sonic was our jam there. Although I think we spent more time blowing air up the cartridges than actually playing.

Anyway, Granny spoiled us with this stuff not our parents. Doesn't matter.

I haven't thought about this stuff for ages!

Alright so, cold basement, lots of toys and rugs and a second-hand couch. That's basically the setting.

The memory kicks off on an evening like this. I think we'd just scarfed some mozzarella sticks and coke (90's kids ate shit for food), and ran right back down the mildewy and cracked-paint stairs to the basement. Past the washer/dryer in the laundry room to our play room/area/whatever. Hopping from rug to rug so as not to touch the freezing cold concrete floor with our bare feet.

Right beside where we played with our legos, which was intricately preserved mayhem, was the furnace room. Not that it did much for the basement's temperature. It was loud. It'd snap on out of nowhere and make us jump. Needless to say we *never* went in there. Couldn't describe that room to you today. The door to this room was like a barn door, just wood panels nailed together and triangular creaking rusty hinges. This basement was a basement truly, not like these new build basements that are already crisp and ready for a makeover. Old home basements are *actually* scary in the dark.

That's sort of a trigger for the memory, now. It was dark.

It wasn't supposed to be dark, I think. One minute, I remember we were elaborating on the previous day's adventure between my lego knight and Jeremy's lego knight. Did I mention the basement was windowless? Not even a window well. Jeremy used to prank me, turning off the lights and running upstairs. It was especially frightening when the furnace would be in its ticking stage, and the sounds of Jeremy retreating upstairs were distant. Something oppressively lonely about it. So that's what happened in this memory. One minute it was adventure with my bro, the next it was Jeremy giggling as he fled, flipping the light, leaving me alone standing in the dark.

My hands are sweating. My neck is itching like crazy trying to write this out. What was it that I can't remember? What...

A hand. That's it... I felt a hand, on my neck. There in the dark. My childhood home, there was a dry finger drawn across the back of my neck. Oh my god I remember, there was a something on my face. On my lips. My own hands by my side, I was fucking frozen there and I felt a hand on my neck and a hard object walking up my chin edge over edge, pressing against the part between my lips. Oh my god, I remember. That's what I remember! I'm hyperventilating. This fucking exercise. No! There was pressure, that small cold object was pressed on my lips. It pressed so hard it cut my lip. I was 10 years old how could I forget this!?

...

I remember now. I ran to turn on the light. I flipped on the laundry room light, which only illuminated our play area slightly, and then I quickly turned on the play area light too. But I remember now! There was a shape standing in the middle of the legos, tall as an adult, in that micro-second before I turned all the lights on and it was nowhere to be seen. There was a shadow there, I saw it! A person or a creature, something!

...

We moved away that same month. My parents couldn't stay there after Jeremy died. They didn't tell me for years, because I was still so young. But they found him one day when he had stayed home from school, sick. They found him in the basement, froth at the mouth. He had choked to death on a [lego](https://www.reddit.com/r/velabasstuff).
