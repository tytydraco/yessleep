Recently, the museum I work for received a bequest from the nine-times-great-granddaughter of a well-known violent pervert (I won’t mention who, since the exhibit’s not yet been announced). This “gift”, transferred to us after the benefactress’s death, contained documentary evidence of a series of murders commited by her infamous ancestor. For simplicity’s sake, I’ll call her ancestor “the Sadist”.



Part of my job in archives is to digitize newly acquired historical documents. So, once we received the Sadist’s trove of letters, drawings, and miscellanea—all of which painted an even grimmer picture of a man already known for his grimly deeds—it was my responsibility to scan and upload the files to the museum’s cloud storage, as well as to an external hard drive.



One day, in the midst of the last few minutes of hustle and bustle before work closed, I forgot to leave the external hard drive in museum storage where it belonged. I blame my forgetfulness on being upset because I’d forgotten my good umbrella at home. It was set for a downpour outside, and I had to make due with the one I bought at a drugstore. Thus distracted, I forgot to double-check my portfolio briefcase.



Once I realized my mistake (not the end of the world, but an error my superiors would expect me not to repeat), the museum was already closed, and would in fact remain closed for renovations over the next three days.



I accepted with equanimity that I’d made an error, mostly because it was raining hard enough to float Noah’s Ark and rectifying my mistake would require going out in that deluge. 



The storm seemed unusually dangerous, too—I’d seen three trees struck by lightning after leaving work, one bolt striking the park a half-block away as I got in Fariq’s car. It was so loud I almost ruined my leather seat during the Uber ride home.

Now, you should know something about me. I’m a bit of a clutterbug. My apartment is filled with gimgracks and bric-a-brac, the debris of estate sales and the leftover pulp from widows’ and widowers’ end-of-life liquidations. Ephemera, oddities and sundry.



You know, hidden gems. 



I’ve gotten a reputation as a collector, so friends and family are in the habit of sending me strange gifts, or of sending me items they hope I’ll sell for them on consignment (my secondary enterprise).



In the course of my collecting, I’ve amassed quite the inventory. And living inside the city limits, I had to get creative about maximizing my apartment’s square footage. Accordingly, I started designing life-size dioramas using items from my collection. It’s a little kitsch, but I’m a gay man who works in a museum, and kitsch is one of my species’ eccentricities, so you’ll just have to forgive my kitschiness.



(Bear with me on this, you will soon understand why I'm explaining my physical property to you.)



When you enter my apartment’s foyer the first thing you’ll see is one of my dioramas. You’ll see a life-size articulated wood mannequin seated at an antique classroom desk. You’ll see the mannequin positioned with its wooden hand holding a Ouija planchette, and the planchette placed on an original Kennard Novelty Company Ouija board.



Now, it’s worth mentioning that this Ouija board’s previous owner was a notorious gadfly. He showed up to Broadway shows dressed as Lucifer, had both a “wife” and a “husband” before it was cool (neither of whom he actually married), and he spent millions lobbying for Congress to designate absinthe as the country’s official national spirit. I think it can be fairly said that he was what, these days, we would call a troll. This self-proclaimed diabolist enjoyed, as our cousins across the pond often put it, “taking the piss”.



It is on that man’s Ouija board I keep my key dish. It’s one of the centerpieces of my collection.



So, when I came home from work completely drenched, I set my keys, wallet, and phone where I always do, on the Ouija-mannequin diorama. I put the hard drive there, too, so I would remember to bring it along with my personal effects when I returned to work.



Unfortunately, because I was in a hurry to go to the bathroom (overactive bladder), I carelessly slapped my cheapie umbrella on the classroom desk, launching a spray of water all over the hard drive.



I remember my cousin staying with me during her artist’s residency, and she always used to say, “You ought to get rid of all that occult nonsense, you know. You’re inviting the devil into your home.”



It wasn’t the devil that entered my home. But she wasn’t too far off the mark.



•



I decided that, having misappropriated the hard drive from work, I could make the best of a bad situation and get a head start on some further cataloguing.



I plugged the hard drive into my laptop without bothering to check if it was still wet. And I got a terrible shock. The USB cord practically exploded. I counted myself lucky not to have been electrocuted into a coma, and tried to remember that well-educated people who die because of wet electronics are remembered as categorical imbeciles.



After that little scare, I got a new cable and got back to work.



I was surprised that when I opened the hard drive, there was a brand new set of etchings I hadn’t seen in the Sadist’s collection before. And they were very disturbing. I won’t describe all of them, which is something only to be attempted on an empty stomach, but I’ll choose two so you can get a feel.



In one etching, the Sadist was decapitating a dog while drinking its blood. Yes, really. In the second etching, he had an elderly woman mounted upside-down on a meat hook, her throat opened over a porcelain—you know, let your imagination go where it would with this one, and that’s pretty much how bad it was (probably worse, actually).



I would need to call my direct boss to let her know what I’d found. We were approaching a juncture, I felt, where informing the government of the Sadist’s home country might be necessary. I knew that Europeans could be touchy about their libertinism (or touchy about their libertines’ masochism), and they appreciated a heads-up on these sorts of things.



I’d get on it in the morning, though. It wasn’t exactly exigent circumstances; the Sadist had died before the American Revolution. No one would fault me for waiting one night.



I returned the hard drive to the Ouija-mannequin beside my wallet and keys. And then I went to sleep.



•



I awoke in the wee hours to go to the bathroom and, as is the awful habit of everyone who uses social media and has an overactive bladder, I checked my smartphone as I urinated. When I unlocked my screen I saw there were dozens of messages sent to me from…me.



I opened all of them, each one with a photo attachment inside.



Each photo was worse than the last. And they all showed me doing the most heinous things. Yes, me. I saw my own face in each picture; my own likeness, but twisted and bestialized, as I performed unconscionable acts of violence and sexual perversion.



Now, you have to understand, I knew quite well that I hadn’t done any of these things. But a picture, as they say, is worth a thousand words, and what “I” had “sent” to myself amounted to about seventy-five-thousand word’s worth of photographic evidence of criminal behavior. In the mildest ones I was still caught, *in flagrante delicto*, nude and engaged in—well, it didn’t look good, I can tell you that.



There was a certain, for lack of a better term, evil spirit that radiated from the pictures on my phone. I mean, these were acts I was literally incapable of even imagining, a species of wickedness I couldn’t conjure in even my most twisted nightmares. But those acts did remind me of the sins of another, a man who often dreamed such wickedness. I thought of the Sadist’s bloodlust and perversion, reams of their evidence that I’d found while working at the museum.



I didn’t know what exactly I thought I would do, but I did know that a frame-up was in the works, and that the exculpatory evidence clearing me of any wrongdoing might be found on the hard drive.



Phone in hand, I went over to the Ouija-mannequin to get the hard drive. The moment I was within ten feet of it, my phone started going haywire, screeching out distorted rings and beeps like an old dial-up modem; it vibrated so violently in my hand that I dropped it on the ground.



Shocked, I looked down at the floor. The phone was bumping around under the power of its own vibration, speaking in dial-up tongues. And then it rattled to a stop. I hesitated a moment. I stood over my phone and looked down at the screen. I saw one of the falsified pictures of me executing one of those terrible acts. But my face looked different. It was like someone had mutated me so I half-resembled the Sadist.



What the actual fuck?



I picked up my phone. I edged closer to the hard drive and Ouija-mannequin. The closer I brought my phone, the more the images on my phone transformed. I put my phone right next to the hard drive, and the pictures transformed completely. They were no longer pictures of me, or even a mutated half-me, they were pictures of the Sadist performing, not my deviancies, but his own.



Out of curiosity, I put the phone right next to the Ouija-mannequin. My phone just about exploded out of my hand.



The mannequin jumped up from the classroom desk, knocking my keys and wallet and the Ouija board on the floor. I screamed. It hit me right in the face with its hard wooden hand. I heard cartilage crunch. I fell to the floor as blood gushed from my face. The pain was extraordinary.



The mannequin jumped right on top of my chest. I shoved it as hard as I could and it went backwards, plonking down on its wooden ass. I was surprised I had moved it, but then I remembered that it weighed half as much as I did.



It moved fast, though, and jumped right back up on its feet. It kicked and caught my hand. I heard and felt my pinky snap. I tried to scream (again) in pain, but the scream came out as a gurgling retch through my blood-clogged airway. 



The mannequin kicked me again, this time right in my knee. I grabbed my knee with both hands and, forgetting myself, jammed my broken pinky doing it. I reacted to this fresh pain with instinct and stupid rage—I kicked the mannequin at the very split-second it launched at me again. My kick was so spot-on, so perfectly timed, that my articulated foe rolled back along my foyer floor, skidding like a toy thrown across a child’s playroom.



That bought me a few seconds to get to my feet. I looked around for something to arm myself with. And lo, did I find my weapon:



God bless Ince & Sons umbrellas, I thought, and picked up my umbrella cane so it was turned around with the handle as the head of a hammer. It had some real heft to it, a good old fashioned bumbershoot, unbreakable by even full gale force winds.



The mannequin came at me again. I single-handedly choked up on the proverbial bat with my good hand. I connected my umbrella’s cane handle with the mannequin’s featureless face, hit it as hard as a juiced-up Barry Bonds crushing a Rawlings baseball, breaking the stitches and hitting it out of the park. The mannequin’s head came off its torso and bounced down under the classroom desk; its body clattered on the floor.



“Alright then, no more messing about,” I said. 



My one hand’s pinky was broken, but I had the energy of panic powering the uninjured hand. I bashed the living daylights out of the mannequin’s headless body as it lay on the floor. I didn’t stop, just kept beating it into disarticulation, first its wooden arms off its wooden torso, then a wooden leg off its wooden waist. I kept going, smashing it to pieces, actually and in fact.



By the end, I was panting. I was completely out of breath. My face and chest and underarms were greased with sweat.



I heard the dial-up sound come from my phone again. It was weaker, much weaker, but it was still there. 



That got me moving.



I finished disarticulating the mannequin fully. Then I put each wooden body part in a separate part of my house—the head in the oven, one leg in the sink, the hands in the toilet tank. I had plans for the severed mannequin, but until then, I remembered that one of the powers of evil was reconstitution.



But first I’d take care of the Ouija board. And the hard drive, too.



•



There is a place along the water where hobos still light fires inside old steel drums. 



I bought two bottles of twist-cap sludge, one wine bottle each of Night Train and Thunderbird. I took the cheap swill and the hard drive and Ouija board with me and made my way along the canal. I came to where the bums burn garbage fires while they strip their stomach lining with booze. I sidled up next to them with their Mennonite beards and their Salvation Army clothes, black-toothed and cackling, and I asked if I could share my twist-cap wine with them and, oh, by the way, is that a fire?



I stood with the bums until the hard drive melted and the Ouija board’s ashes floated up in the wind. When the fire burned brightest, I felt the toxic fumes thick in my throat, and for that brief moment I saw a vision of darkness.



But that darkness was soon gone.



The sun was coming up by the time the fire stopped burning, and I watched the sunrise with the two vagrants who’d made my acquaintanceship. A strange tranquility set over us—I believed that some kind of peace was over all of our heads—and one of the bums asked me:



“Didn’t like that Ouija board, did you?”



“No, no,” I said, “I guess not anymore.”



The hobo belched and then farted before saying, “You’re better off without all that black magic crapola. Witchcraft ain’t no better than inviting the devil into your home.”



I thought of my cousin and I laughed.



•



It was strange, but when I got back to my apartment, stinking of fire and cheap wine, I didn’t have the heart to break up the whole diorama. After all, it was just the Ouija board and the hard drive that caused all that trouble. Wasn’t it?



And I heard something in my head, something whispering, no, I’d got it all wrong, I’d misunderstood the Sadist, hadn’t I, and I shouldn’t be rash, and I should just think on it a bit—something whispered it to me, said to me, or I said to myself—yes, I’d got it all wrong.



•



I kept the mannequin.
