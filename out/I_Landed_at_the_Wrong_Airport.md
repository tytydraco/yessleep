For all intents and purposes, I’m not sure how to express my feelings about this experience. I initially thought that I’d keep this story to myself due to the fact that I didn’t think people would believe it. And while that may certainly hold true despite me posting this, this is a story that needs to be told.  By the title, you might assume that my experience wasn’t abnormal in any way, or that it was at least incredibly frustrating or anxiety-inducing.

But even then, how is it possible? How does a certified American Airlines pilot land their plane at the wrong airport, and release their passengers like nothing was wrong? Was it even an error on their part, or was it an error on mine? And above all else, what could’ve compelled me to post this story to a place like this? To be honest, other than that last question, I don’t know the answers to these questions, nor do I have any answers to the other mysteries that this story will bring up. What I can assure you of is that this was no normal landing, and this was no normal airport.

It was about three days ago, and I was on a return flight from a business trip in New York. I live in Texas, so you could imagine that it would’ve been a decently long flight from JFK International to DFW. I’d been planning to go home and spend some time with my family, since the trip lasted a little longer than I thought it would. I guess in retrospect, I did fulfill these plans, but nothing could’ve overshadowed the events that transpired on that flight. I’d been, admittedly, scrambling to get a ticket for the return flight since I’m a bit of a procrastinator.

In my luck, however, I was able to get an AA flight from NYC to Dallas, with only 7 seats left out of the 128 total seats on the plane. I got to the airport just fine, I went through customs just fine, and I made it to my gate just fine. By all accounts, this is as normal as a trek through JFK could go, save for my impeccable ability to lazily do everything at the last minute. Once they called my number, and I made my way onto the aircraft, everything proceeded out as normally as it could. I found my seat, stored my luggage, and sat comfortably until the plane took off without any abnormality.

Once we were in the air, everything was, once again, just fine. The food was as bad as usual, the seats were as cramped as usual, and my headphones worked just fine as they usually do. The old lady that sat next to me didn't bother trying to talk to me, and spent the flight reading what looked like some sort of crappy romance novel. The reason I emphasize this is because by all means, this was a perfectly normal flight. There was no indication; no symptom that would have or could have predicted what transpired once we landed.

Due to it being a long, overnight flight, I fell asleep at around 11 a.m. I’m not a heavy sleeper when I'm on anything that isn’t my own bed, so I figured I’d wake up a couple hours before we landed. When I came to, however, we were already descending to the airport. The plane stopped, and stationed itself at the terminal. While somewhat off-topic now, I just wanted to preface by saying that I didn't really pay attention to the surrounding area outside my destination. I'd been on this flight several times beforehand, so I never bothered to get a good look at the outside of the airport.

Getting off the plane was easy enough. Grabbed my luggage. Waited for the people ahead to start moving. Moved towards the plane’s exit. As I carried my fairly heavy bags into Terminal B, the jet lag starting to set upon me, I immediately noticed something strikingly obvious to anyone in the same mindset as I was. Airports aren’t exactly known for being buildings with immense personalities. Many airports use very basic layouts and architecture, leading them to look and feel very similar to each other.

However, if you travel often, you usually take note of the specific layouts and minor details that make the airport you’re traveling from stand out at least a little bit from the rest around the country. They, at the very least, have some sort of iconography and trivia about the specific city or region they're located in. The more you travel around these places, the easier it is to remember certain things about them. This was the same case for me. The reason I state all this is because of the realization I made in that very moment when I stepped into that terminal. Every aspect of it; every minor detail of it made it clear to me that this was not DFW.

I stood there in confusion, wondering if my eyes were tricking me, somehow. After around 10 seconds of contemplation, I came to the conclusion that I was correct. This wasn’t DFW, nor was it any airport I’d ever been to in my life. In pure instinctive confusion, I started walking back towards the entrance to the plane, thinking that there was a wrong turn I could’ve made. I stopped myself, of course, realizing that trying to go back on a plane with the intention of staying on it for the next flight wouldn’t be allowed in any way shape or form.

Because of this, I try to go for my second-best option: finding the customer service desk at the gate for help. However, as I started to look around for it, not only could I not find any such desk existing, the second most perplexing thing I’d noticed so far came into view for me. There were no airport staff anywhere I could see. There were many people, for sure, but none of them had any sort of uniform, badge, or equipment that would make me think they worked for this place. So, I tried asking the other people walking around.

Even if this was completely unfamiliar to me, I could at least be comfortable knowing that I wasn't alone here, right? Well, soon enough, that sentiment proved to be useless here. “Hello?”, I'd ask. “Please I don't know where I am”, I'd say. It all fell on deaf ears. Every person I tried asking just ignored me. Walking on by as if my presence was completely invisible and inaudible. As I stood there and took on that information, I was rightfully weirded out by whatever predicament I’d gotten into. What was this place? What do I do now?

While these questions entered my mind, time stood still in a way. Nothing felt real, as if I were somewhere that didn't really exist. With circulating feelings of perplexion, fear, and a slight sense of dread flowing in my brain, I could only stand there in awe of whatever new world I had ended up in, however mundane it seemed at first. Once I was able to move again, there was only one goal that clutched onto my thoughts, a survival instinct baked into the brain of every human being. Escape. As I clenched my fists with bated breath, I walked forward into a new world I wasn’t completely sure I could leave from.

Despite my earlier grievances with the airport not being what I expected, the airport was relatively normal, on the surface at least. As I trekked throughout the terminal, passing by shops, walkways, gates, it all seemed like it was perfectly fine. Yet, in a way, that sort of mundane normality felt more uncanny than if it were distinctly strange and unnatural. I had never been to this place before, and as far as I knew, it didn’t exist. I had absolutely no idea where I was or what I was doing here.

Eventually, I reached a place I recognized: the entrance where I arrived. I’d fully circled the airport. Despite the fact that I’d loosely ascertained the layout of the airport, I realized that there were still no answers to my questions.  While very stupid of me in retrospect, I only realized something important once this thought appeared in my head. My phone. I could look at my location on Google Maps and work my way from there. However, when I acted on this thought and pulled out my phone, it was to no avail. Every app I checked, every online service I tried, nothing would work right.

But it wasn’t just simply that every service was offline. No. It was just that nothing was working the way it should have. When I opened my phone, it turned on and worked just fine. But when I opened Google Maps to try and find my location, the map showed me nothing. Not that the map didn’t load, but all it did was show me an empty, blank terrain. No roads, no towns, nothing. I went to my messages app to see if I could text or call my parents and notify them of everything, to get any sign that I was still on the same planet as them.

But when I attempted to text and call my parents, they never responded. Unread message after unread message. Missed call after missed call. I try to do the same with my other contacts: My sister, my friends, my boss, etc. Still nothing. While I wasn’t entirely sure of the specific time zone I was in, there had to be at least someone I knew that was awake to receive my messages. With this information, I came to the conclusion that not only could I not understand where I was, no one else did either. They hadn’t received my messages, and I was completely, utterly alone.

I had to lean against the wall, and take in my situation. I really didn’t know what to think of this, and in all fairness, I still don’t. “What’s going on?”. “How did I get here?”. These thoughts echoed in my mind, and I felt myself falling into a complete state of panic. However, something brought me out of it. Something I'd initially written off as ignorable, but one that suddenly filled me with curiosity. It was the people.

I didn’t really pay much attention to the people as I was traveling through the airport, since every time I tried to ask for help from them, they just ignored me. But as I adjusted my posture, and started looking more closely at them, I figured out what it was that had garnered my focus. They were shiny. Not that they were glowing any sort of light, but instead the type of shininess that comes from light being reflected across a smooth surface, like say metal or glass.

As I went to take a closer look, I realized that the reason this shiny reflectiveness was occurring was because their entire bodies were outlined with some sort of plastic sheen. It kind of looked like they were all completely wrapped in cellophane. For some reason, this was the first thing that made me truly terrified. I was panicked beforehand, for sure, but right then and there, I was taken by an overwhelming sense of dread as I understood that the people I was surrounded with in this airport, the only human contact I had, weren't really human.

Things only got worse from there. I started distancing myself from the “people” I was walking with, still keeping a close eye on them. But as I started wandering once more through this now foreboding structure, more unnerving things disturbed my psyche. The letters and numbers on the walls above stores and kiosks had started to change. At first, it looked like some of the letters had been switched around or removed, but as I kept walking, they became nearly unrecognizable gibberish. Some looked as though they'd been generated by a Captcha in their unnatural positioning, while others couldn't even be distinguished as being letters in the English language.

This continued on as I walked through the terminal, coming to understand that every piece of text in the airport had been transformed into incoherent scribbles. But while text changing on a wall only slightly confused and unnerved me, it was, once again, the “people” that freaked me out. As I still maintained a relatively safe distance, I noticed how the strange plastic texture of their skin had started to transform. I

t warped from a sort of cellophane wrap to a hard shell plastic, like their entire skin tissue had been replaced by the material of a mannequin. More things started to confirm this observation, as it appeared that their external features (eyes, clothes, shoes, etc.) had started to flatten into this hard shell, eventually reaching a point where their entire body looked as though someone had painted an incredibly realistic drawing of a human onto a store mannequin.

The only saving grace I had in this place was the small hope that, despite their ghastly forms, they weren't going to hurt me. Though unnerved and frustrated by it before, I'd now come to appreciate the fact that they were set on never acknowledging my existence. While I didn't want to startle them, and still kept a multi-foot distance from them, I still felt hopeful in the fact that we're content on ignoring my presence. That hope wouldn't last.

I kept walking and walking, wandering if I could even find some sort of exit. I must have circled the terminal around ten times, with no food or drink to sustain me. I finally sat down, still reeling from the dynamic fear, frustration, and confusion that had manifested in me due to this place. I had to sit with myself for a while, mumbling to myself those same questions from earlier: “What's going on? How did I get here?”, along with some new ones, “What are those things? How do I get out of this?”.

Finally, in a scream mixed with frustration, fear, and confusion, as the emotions swelling inside me finally reached their boiling point, I yelled out “Where the hell do I go?!”. Almost as soon as I asked it though, the airport answered. But it wasn't the answer I wanted.

When I was a kid, I had a near-death experience at a pool, at least that’s how I saw it at the time. Since I couldn’t swim very well, I went under the surface of the water in a deep part of the pool, where I felt myself starting to drown as I struggled to return above. In reality, I was likely in no considerable danger since I was barely 2ft underwater, and my mom was able to pull me to the surface with little struggle.

But to me, I felt the overwhelming fear and anticipation of death as the water seemed to pull me farther down to my demise while the light of the surface drew further from my vision. I felt like I was going to die, and that scared me to no end, as you could imagine. Even as life has gone on into adulthood, I’ve only felt that fear of death once at that pool. That was until this moment, as I stared at the newest, and by far the worst disturbance the airport had presented me.

In the middle of the walkway, standing around twenty feet away from me, was another one of those plastic “human” things. But it wasn’t walking around like the rest of them were. It was hunched over, shuddering in some sort of shock, as if it were injured. As I looked closer, though, I understood why. Its body was splattered with blood and viscera, which originated from several wounds placed all across its head and torso. Like the rest of its features, it looked like it was painted on its hard-shell, mannequin body. However, it still reacted as though it was hurt.

Another odd difference I noticed, though, was the way its skin and clothes looked on its body. Unlike the others, its red and black plaid shirt, blue jeans and white skin looked less realistic than the others. While every other airport denizen I’d seen looked like it had a photo scan of human features pasted on a mannequin shell, the injured one had a more rushed, unfinished look, with it looking similar to a simplistic portrait with no harsh shadows or clear outlines.

Yet the worst thing about it by far, was the direction it was looking in. Mine. While the others had continued ignoring me, this one broke the tradition and was clearly directing its attention towards me, shuddering and groveling as it awaited for my reply. 

At this point, I didn't know what to believe anymore. I had been in this place for what felt like hours, and I didn't see any way out of this situation, no matter how much I wanted to stay away from that thing. It didn't walk or run towards me at any point, it just kept staring at me. The airport started to fall more quiet as well. The ambient noise of rolling suitcases across marble floors and the echoes of conversation between “people” dimmed as my focus continued to fall on the creature ahead of me.

However, despite my absolute reluctance, I decided to approach it. You guys may lambast me for this decision, which is fair, but I had run out of options. As I slowly moved towards, still wary of provoking it, I said “Hello? What do you want?”. No response. “Please, I just want to leave. I don't have any problem with you”. It still didn't say anything. Eventually, I got close enough to where I was standing right in front of it. It still didn't say or do anything, just trembling as a result of a nondescript wound. Right before I left out of confusion, I heard something coming from its direction.

It was hard to notice at first, but as I looked closer, I realized it was a barely audible, hushed whisper. I leaned in closer, hoping to discern what it was saying. It sounded like gibberish, the kind of nonsensical monologue expected of an asylum patient, except this one's mouth wasn't moving. Then, all of a sudden, louder than before, in a hushed, raspy tone, it said one discernable word.

“Eden”.

Before I could even process what it said, a loud BANG went off next to my ear. I recoiled from the sound, covering my right ear with my hand as it started ringing. I writhed on the ground for a second until I looked up to see what the source of the noise was. There was nothing.

No person, no object, no firearm like I assumed it was. Nothing was there. I felt blood trickling down the side of my head. Panicking at the thought that I was the target of that sound, I checked every part of my head until I realized that the blood was coming from my ear. The noise was so powerful that it blew out my eardrum, leaving it so my head was ringing even after the sound had stopped. Despite being dazed by the sudden injury, I was still lucid enough to question where that shot had landed and why it had been shot. However, it didn’t take me long to find out my answer.

Only about two feet away from me was the injured creature from before, laying in an ever-growing pool of blood. The blood wasn't just plastered across its mannequin shell body. It was actually physically manifesting. I staggered back in horror, taking in the revolting scene in front of me, before regaining my senses and examining it more closely. Part of me wishes I hadn't.

The source of the blood was a large hole on the side of its head, and it looked cracked, kind of like an eggshell. Underneath the shell revealed a solid mass of flesh, blood, and other viscera, slightly concave due to the impact of the weapon. The body, originally twitching and shuddering at any interference, is now laid lifeless as its pain was ended by an unknown assailant. I'm pretty sure it was a gun.
