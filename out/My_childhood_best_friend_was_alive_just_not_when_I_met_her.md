Me and my family moved to a small town in Oregon when I was about 7 years old. Due to my difficult childhood, it was very hard for me to interact with other kids, especially to get them to stick around.

But at some point, I remember I was playing outside before my homeschooled classes began when I met  her. She was a young girl around my age, Lorelai. From the start, I knew that there was something bizarre about Lorelei. It could've been the fact that she spoke with a strange accent, kinda like a mix of a boston and a southern accent. Or maybe it was the fact that she always wore the same clothes and had the same one long braid in her hair

But anyway, I didn't really care that she seemed strange. After talking with her, I found out that both of us were pretty similar. We were both born in Massachusetts, we had trouble making friends, we both liked frogs, etc. I finally felt like I had found myself a friend

Ever since that morning, we were practically best friends. We were always going to the creek to catch frogs, swinging on a random tire swing in the forest next to my house, or just talking and playing around somewhere in town 

Another strange note is that Lorelai hated people. Well, except for me. Whenever I tried to get another kid or adult involved in our playtime, she would get very upset and usually started lashing out at me. I knew she was pretty antisocial like I was, but it took me a bit to realize she was **that** antisocial.

I can't remember that much of the times we've played, but I can remember this one particular day the way you would remember something bad happening. It was a pretty warm day in late Spring, and neither of us felt like playing. However, she got an idea of what to do and started dragging me through the woods. It was going to start pouring at any moment and I pleaded that we check out whatever it was tomorrow, but she was very insistent on checking the thing out immediately. 

After a while of running through the thick woods, we settled at a small clearing, where Lorelai took out a small shovel. I asked her what the shovel was for, and she responded with "We have something to dig up". I shoveled and shoveled in this one spot she showed me, but never told me what we were getting.

Finally, after what took half an hour at the very least, I managed to fully dig up a large chest in the ground. It had a lock on it, but the lock stood no chance against a few swift kicks

After opening the chest, I noticed that there was multiple belongings in it, mostly letters, sketches, maps, and a stuffed frog made from what looked like a raggedy potato sack. Shortly after opening the chest, Lorelai immediately grabbed the frog, said "Thanks, I've been wanting this for a while", and ran off. I tried chasing her, but she was too fast for me to keep up. That was the last time I ever saw Lorelai.

I noticed the chest was looked very old, so I closed it up and took it to the town historian, Mr. Geller. Once I got to our town's small museum, I greeted mr. Geller and told him I found something that he might find interesting. And interesting it was.

The chest was from the Landry family, one of the many families that traveled through the Oregon Trail for new opportunities. However, from the context of the notes, the Landry family met their demise after the family was murdered and cannibalized by some third party. From the looks of it, the third party found their belongings, likely took things of value, and decided to leave some of their belongings in a chest underground as a little prize for whomever found it.

But the thing that stuck out the most where the members of the family. The parents were Lucille and Andrew Landry, and their two children were named Marc and Lorelai Landry
