**PART 1: The Rules**

You’ve probably never heard of “The Reflection Game.” I hadn’t either—until my roommate Max brought it up one drunken night after our third round of whiskey sours.

We were college seniors, and Max had a thing for urban legends. He said his cousin in Romania swore by this old Eastern European ritual. The gist was simple: You play at midnight, alone, with a mirror. You light a single candle, stare into your own eyes, and say:

“My shadow knows me. My mirror shows me. Let what’s hidden now appear.”

You wait. Supposedly, you’ll see a reflection of yourself that isn’t quite… you. If you speak to it, it will answer—but only once. You’re supposed to blow out the candle immediately after the response. That ends the game. If you hesitate… it doesn't.

Max dared me. And I’m an idiot when drunk and trying to be macho.

So, I did it.

At 12:01 a.m., I stood in our bathroom. Candle lit. Mirror fogged from nerves and breath. I said the phrase. I waited.

Nothing.

Then something shifted. My reflection’s smile appeared before mine did.

I stared, frozen.

Then it spoke.

“You’ve already let me in.”

My stomach dropped. I blew out the candle like my life depended on it.

Because I think it did.

**PART 2: The Thing in the Mirror**

The next morning, I laughed it off—told Max the whiskey made me hallucinate. But Max looked pale.

“Did it talk back?” he asked.

I nodded.

His lips tightened. “What did it say?”

When I repeated the line—“You’ve already let me in”—he backed away. “You didn’t follow the rule,” he said. “It’s supposed to answer your question. You didn’t ask one.”

We both went quiet. Because he was right. I didn’t ask anything. The reflection just… volunteered that.

That night, strange things started happening.

Mirrors fogged up with no heat or steam. I saw movement in the corner of my eyes—only in reflective surfaces. Worse, the thing in the mirror started acting on its own.

While brushing my teeth, I’d look up and it’d already be staring—smiling before I did, or not moving at all while I turned away. I covered every mirror in the apartment with sheets. Max started sleeping at his girlfriend’s place.

It got worse.

The reflection would talk even with no candle lit. Whispering words like:

“You don’t sleep alone.”
“That’s not Max knocking.”
“Your skin fits me better.”

One night, I dreamt I was trapped behind the mirror, banging, screaming—while my double walked freely in my place.

And then Max disappeared.

**PART 3: In the Glass**

Max had left his stuff behind—phone, laptop, even his jacket. Police said there were no signs of forced entry. I knew the truth, but I couldn’t tell anyone: the mirror took him.

I was spiraling.

I ripped every reflective surface from the walls. Blacked out my phone screen. I only used matte utensils. But no matter how careful I was, I kept seeing myself—in puddles, in windows, even in the blank of a turned-off TV.

And one night, I saw Max.

He was behind the glass of my TV screen, face pressed against the other side like he was trapped underwater. Mouth moving, eyes wide, begging.

I couldn’t hear him.

But the reflection next to him was me—smiling, calm, fingers resting on Max’s shoulder.

I screamed and smashed the screen.

The police found the apartment destroyed. They put me in a psych hold.

Now I’m out. Living in a motel. One with no mirrors.

But tonight, there’s condensation on the bathroom wall. I wiped it with my palm.

There were two handprints. Mine… and someone else’s. From the other side.

**PART 4: The Hand That Followed**

I checked out of the motel an hour after seeing the second handprint.

Didn’t even pack. Just left.

I drove all night, no destination. Just… away. I slept in my car at a truck stop, windows fogging from my breath. When I woke, someone had written something in the condensation of my rear window—backward, like from the inside.

"LET ME FINISH."

That was three days ago.

Now I’m crashing at my cousin Lila’s cabin in the Adirondacks. No electricity. No mirrors. Nothing reflective. She thinks I’m getting clean from something. I didn’t bother correcting her.

But that night, I found a puddle in the woods.

I didn’t notice it was water until it was too late—I was already staring.

And there I was again, crouching in the reflection. But… off.

My face was smiling, again. My eyes were bleeding. And Max was behind me, pale, mouth sewn shut with some kind of black thread. He shook his head. Slowly. Like a warning.

Then the thing in the puddle raised its hand—and so did mine. Not because I wanted to.

Because it moved me.

I screamed. Fell back. Snapped the puddle’s surface with my boot.

Ever since then, I’ve noticed little things.

I hum songs I’ve never liked. Crave raw meat. My reflection—it doesn’t always blink when I do. And I keep dreaming of glass, sharp and endless, like a labyrinth made of mirrors.

Two days ago, I bit my tongue and looked in the creek to check the wound. No blood.

But my reflection was smiling, with red-stained teeth.

I think I lost the game. I think the rules weren’t meant to be broken—but followed.

And the worst part?

Sometimes, when I’m walking through the woods, I see Max out of the corner of my eye. Still trapped in glass. Still mouthing something I now understand.

“Don’t look back.”

I never used to.

But now I do.

And it’s always there.

Smiling.

**PART 5: Behind the Smile**

The smile isn’t just a smile anymore.

It’s a mask. A stretched-on performance stitched to my face like wet leather. I can feel it pulling at the edges of my mouth even when I’m not looking in a mirror. Even when I don’t want to smile.

Yesterday, I caught my reflection blinking twice—but I only blinked once.

Lila’s dog won’t come near me now. It just growls and whines outside my door at night. She says I sleepwalk. Says she heard me speaking in some guttural, wet voice that sounded nothing like me.

Last night, I woke to find my face wet. Not from sweat.

From drool.

But I wasn’t hungry. I was staring at Lila through the crack in her door.

I don’t remember getting up.

I tried to end it today.

I smashed every reflective surface I could find. Sliced my own hand open and wrote “NOT ME” on the walls in blood. But when I blinked, the message was gone.

My reflection—still there—had wiped it clean.

It watches now. Always. And not just in mirrors. Windows. Silverware. Water. My own pupils if the light hits right.

It’s closer.

Sometimes I feel its breath, like steam against the back of my neck.

This morning, Lila was gone.

Her phone’s still here. Her keys. But all the windows in her room were fogged over, like someone breathed on every one of them. And in the middle of her bed?

A mirror shard.

Not broken glass. A piece of the mirror I used that night.

I don’t know how it got here. But when I picked it up to toss it, my fingers locked. My eyes were dragged to the surface.

And there he was.

Max.

Mouth still sewn shut.

Behind him was me, grinning wider than skin should allow. Holding Lila by the neck. Slowly turning her toward the mirror.

I dropped the shard. It cut my foot. I barely noticed.

Because when I looked down at the blood on the floor, the reflection in the puddle wasn’t mine anymore.

It was smiling.

They’re not trapped behind the glass anymore.

They walk among us. They smile. They pretend.

If someone close to you seems a little off—smiles too often, blinks wrong, watches reflections too long—don’t ask questions.

Don’t play the game.

Don’t even look.

Because the moment you do...

You’ve already let them in.

**PART 6: The Mirror World**

I’m writing this from a phone I found in an abandoned ranger station.

But I’m not sure you’ll believe any of this.

Because I don’t know if I’m the one writing.

After Lila vanished, I tried to run—barefoot, bleeding, crashing through the woods. The trees seemed to close in. Every puddle, every shadowed window of a cabin, every glint off a wet leaf was a threat.

They were watching me.

Reflections.

They’re not passive—they’re doorways.

I tripped in a clearing and landed face first in a shallow pool. And that’s when it pulled me under—not the water, but the reflection.

It wasn’t cold. It wasn’t wet.

It was glass.

I don’t know how long I’ve been here.

This place is endless. Everything is mirrored. The trees are glass. The sky is cracked silver. Every footstep echoes like it’s being watched, and sometimes I hear my own voice call out from behind me—only it’s not what I said.

I’ve seen others.

Dozens.
Trapped in looping reflections. Running. Screaming. Clawing at invisible walls, unable to escape the paths their doubles now walk in the real world.

Their doppelgängers smile too wide.

They blink at the wrong times.

They laugh at nothing.

They watch.

I found Max.

He was crouched near a lake of obsidian glass, his eyes gone milky, lips raw from trying to scream past the stitches.

When he saw me, he didn’t smile.

He mouthed one word:

“Run.”

But I couldn’t move.

Because I saw something rising from the lake. Slowly. Smiling.

Me.

But this version was perfect. Clean. Confident. Calm.

Not terrified. Not broken.

He looked at me and whispered, in my exact voice:

“This world doesn’t trap you.
It shows you who deserves your life.
And I’m better at it.”

Then he turned, walked across the glassy surface, and vanished.

I woke back in the cabin.

But the mirrors are gone. The windows are black. Even my own reflection in my eyes… gone.

It’s like the world stopped showing me myself.

And I don’t know if that means I’m free…

Or if it means I never made it out.

If you’re reading this, look around you.

Check your reflection—just for a second.

If it smiles before you do…

Run.
