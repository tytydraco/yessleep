I woke up on that day to my phone ringing, 3:00 am. It was quiet, the type of silence that makes you feel in danger. I answer the phone, Dr. Bruno Zaffre, the pathologist for my late wife.

Me and Frankie spent 35 years together, we met in university. It was true love at first sight. I didn’t think life could go to hell. And to the universe’s credit, it didn’t for a long time.

2 days prior to the incident, my wife died in a murder, supposedly a wrong place wrong time scenario. To say the grief has been a nightmare is a serious understatement. I wasn’t myself anymore. It was like a soulless skin walker had infested my skin. I’m finding it hard to put the emotional turmoil down into simple plain words.

I was crying when Dr. Zaffre called me. I imagined my late wives body lying in an old, rusted freezer.

“Mr. Smith? We noticed something… I can’t even put it into words. I understand that you’re grieving, so if you could send a family member over on your behalf, it’d be highly appreciated.”

I managed to find my words during my flowing tears.

“What?”

“Mr. Smith, we found an oddity in your late wives body, the reason I’m only giving you vague information because I DON’T KNOW” he replies, a hint of panic and rudeness in his tone. “Look, I’m not sure what else you want me to say, I need someone on your behalf to come to the morgue. Understood?“

My tears begin to dry. I’m left with a sense of curiosity, an elephant in the room which refuses to leave.

I obeyed the doctor’s orders, and called my son Kenneth. He was never one to portray emotion externally. Out of everyone I knew, he could handle the news. Somehow, he accepted my request. I assumed he thought it was something minor, I kept him a bit in the dark from that angle.

3 hours later, after tossing and turning, I fell asleep…

My sleep came to a halt at the sound of banging on my door. Yells filled my apartment, yells akin to the tortured souls of hell. I opened the door, Kenneth.

“Dad, we need to have a talk, NOW” he says. I accept as he walks in. He hands a slab of pavlova, a juxtaposition of the news he would soon bring. I’m confused in the dark labyrinth of my thoughts.

“Who was she?” He asked, trailing off at the mention of his late mother.

I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t say anything, I was completely mute.

Kenneth wiped the sweat of his eyebrow, looking around cautiously. “

Remember how you always said Mum was a *machine* in medicine?” he asked, referring to her old job as a chemist.

I nodded along, I still didn’t know where this conversation would lead.

“Well, you were right”.

“…what?” I mutter.

Kenneth poured it all out. My wife? All flesh, but a metallic machine locked up where her brain should be. Her organs? Containing DNA from other people who went missing 50 years ago, people who vanished without a trace. Then, he dropped the final bombshell.

“And… how should I say this?”

I gave up at this point, nothing could shock me. “What?”

“There were no wounds, no sign of injury, nothing. As far as they’re aware, her brain. Never mind, her circuits, shutdown.”

I sat on the chair paralysed, I tried to ask a question, but nothing released from my chained up mouth.

“Shutdown, shutdown, shutdown, shutdown” my son repeated, his voice devoid of life. His words sent a chill down my spine. Within a second, his body fell to the floor, spasming everywhere. I yelled out his name, I was greeted with his body smashing into the glass coffee table in the room. Still, he continued to spasm across the living room. And then, the unthinkable.

A loud BOOM echoed across the space, his head was absent from his body, the walls painted blood with his blood. Fragments of his old teeth were stuck in my leg, like shrapnel from a grenade. I collapsed onto the floor, screaming out his name. In the centre of the room laid a metallic box with wires circulating every side, some torn, presumably from his spasm fit. I stepped closer to the metallic box, picking it up. Kenneth’s words rang across my mind.

“All flesh, but a metallic machine locked up where her brain should be.” That’s what he said about Frankie. The metal box was a reminder of his words.

I let the box drop to the floor, a crackle of electricity singing its last tune when it hit the now bloodied floor. My family, my now dead family. A family of circuits.
