Recently I received a package from my cousin Mark. We had never been very close but he was one of the few members of my family that always enjoyed being imaginative and creative. He was a few years older than me growing up so he would always find and figure out new activities for us to do together. Trading cards, videos games, horror movies and books. You name it Mark was into it and subsequently so was I.
As we grew older we became distant but did still keep in contact on occasion. I was starting a family and Mark was still trying to find a ghost hunt or long road trip to go on.
I recently received a package from Mark containing a weathered leather cover journal. After reading its contents it only feels right to share what I am assuming are his last days.
The following are some of the final entries from my cousin Mark’s journal.

I went and had dinner with these really interesting people I met today. Seems like some kind of church mission being led by an older guy Tom Jameson. They all seemed nice enough and invited me to an outdoor sermon Sunday so I guess that’s where the road is taking me.

The outdoor service was an interesting experience. Tom spoke extensively on the unity of all beings with God and profoundly explained the relation we all have to the spiritual world. 
He seems to have taken a liking to me because he invited me on a trip the group plans on taking in a few weeks. I usually don’t stay in one place for this long but Tom is very persuasive and the group in general has been hospitable and generous. I guess the road can wait for a while, got to rest at some point.

Tom’s wife Shelly has set me up with a bunk at their home. 
I explained to them my money situation and made clear I was fine at the motel in town but they were very insistent on me “being well and good for the trip.”
I still haven’t gotten the full story on where we are going but Tom keeps saying it is a wonderful place where more people of his following have gathered many times before. Some kind of ceremonial thing for new members to officially join.

Tom’s service was amazing. It is truly amazing how insightful and wise he is. 
The ceremony this weekend is sure to be life changing.

Tomorrow is it. Our journey will begin.
Tom has been very adamant on being on time for the trip. I do not want to let him down. 
I won’t hide that I am a bit nervous after talking to this guy Devon in the church. He said that some collider thing is being tested and that we have to use that for something, not really sure what he meant. 
I’m going to send this journal to my cousin in case something happens and I can’t have this anymore.
