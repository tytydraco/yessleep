The unknown of the paranormal, does it really exist? It's something I've wondered about for years. I've never had any paranormal experiences that made me 100% believe in it, until last week, when I managed to have a conversation with one. Generally, I have always been quite skeptical about this subject. I have always tried to find an explanation for everything that happened to me, but sometimes not even science can explain certain phenomena.



Before telling you about the experience that changed my life, I would like to introduce myself. My name is Luca and I am a bit introverted. I have never liked to socialize with people, although luckily I still have some friends I've had since elementary school. Without them I would probably be completely alone; they are just as geeky as I am, so they have never judged me for my weird tastes.



April 7th came around, my friend Rick's birthday, and we decided to celebrate it at Mia's house, an old classmate of mine who had a pretty big house on the outskirts of the city, with a garden and a swimming pool. I met up with my friend Thomas (we call him Thom) to go to the birthday party together. The party was fine, nothing more. In the end, we were four lifelong friends tired of making the same plans every day.



It was getting dark, so I brought up the subject of the paranormal to scare them a little. I love seeing their shocked faces as they tell horror stories. Mia told us that her father is fascinated by this world and has sometimes done research on it. After a few hours of chatting and debating about the existence of the paranormal, we were so excited that we decided to go to an abandoned hospital near Mia's house. Before we left, Mia picked up a Spirit Box her father had from the investigations. I thought they hadn't taken the plan to investigate that hospital seriously, but in the end we all wanted to know the answer to a question that none of us knew the answer to.



We arrived at the hospital, and I must stress that it was a cold and silent night. We walked in and the four of us were quite frightened. We didn't dare go up to the second floor, as everything was in very bad condition and there were even dangerous holes in the floor. Mia turned on the Spirit Box to see if it would pick up any spirits. We started asking questions to see if any being from beyond would answer us, but nothing. After about 40 minutes with no answers, we plucked up the courage to investigate the hospital a little further. I noticed that there was a hole in the wall that led down a flight of stairs, as if there was a subway floor. I poked my head through the hole and saw a sign that said "Morgue" and a down arrow pointing to the stairs. I convinced everyone to go down to see if we could pick up anything paranormal in that morgue.



As we walked down those stairs, the cold increased so much that it made my skin crawl. When we got to some sort of completely trashed room, we turned on the Spirit Box. We started to say "Hello? Is anyone here?" and it didn't take long to get a response. From the device a voice began to be heard that seemed to mimic us, a deep voice that said "Who am I contacting?" and we replied, "We are Luca, Mia, Rick and Thom. Who are you?" the voice replied, with a somber echo, "I am he who dwells among shadows." We looked at each other in disbelief and fear, unable to process what we had just heard.



Rick, trying to remain calm, asked, "Why are you here?"



The voice was silent for a few moments and then said, "Because you called me."



The temperature dropped even lower, and I could see my breath in the air. Mia, her face pale, tried to unplug the Spirit Box, but the device continued to work. The voice continued, "I've been waiting...for a long time."



We were starting to get nervous. Thom, always the most rational of the group, tried to find a logical explanation. "This must be interference or something," he muttered. But even he seemed less sure than usual.



Mia, with a tremor in her voice, asked, "What do you want from us?"



"I want... freedom," the voice replied. "You guys must help me get out of here."



We began to hear footsteps, as if someone was approaching, though we couldn't see anyone. Suddenly, Rick gasped and fell to the ground, holding his head. "It's in my mind! It's trying to get in!"



We helped Rick to his feet, but his face reflected a terror we had never seen before. "He knows things about us," Rick muttered, "things we've never told."



We decided enough was enough and started backing toward the stairs. However, the voice didn't let us go easily. "You can't run away from me. We're connected now."



Mia, desperate, shouted, "What do you want from us?"



"I want... to be one with you," the voice replied with a ghoulish laugh. "I want to experience what you call life."

At that moment, something strange happened. I felt as if an invisible force was pushing me forward, separating me from the group. The others seemed to be experiencing the same thing. The darkness of the morgue seemed to envelop us, as if we were being absorbed by it.



Then everything went black.



When I woke up, I was in the garden of Mia's house. The others were there too, but something had changed. We looked at each other with a sense of strangeness, as if we were no longer ourselves. Rick had an expression on his face that was not his own, and Mia and Thom looked just as puzzled.



Suddenly, a voice spoke from inside my head. "We are now one."



I understood then: the spirit hadn't been trying to contact us. It had been trying to possess us. We had become the hosts of that entity.



Days passed, then weeks, and I began to realize that we were not the same. We had memories and thoughts that were not ours. Strange behaviors began to emerge, as if we were being influenced by an outside presence.



Finally, the truth was revealed. As we investigated more about the abandoned hospital and the Spirit Box, we discovered that the voice was not just any spirit, but an ancient entity seeking reincarnation in the living. And now, that entity was part of us.



Over time, we began to lose more and more control over our own bodies and minds. The entity was winning, and we were disappearing.



The real horror was not what we found in the hospital, but what we brought back with us. There was no escape. We were no longer ourselves, but mere fragments of an ancient darkness that had found its new home in our souls.



And so, the unknown of the paranormal was not only answered, but became our reality, a reality from which we could never escape.
