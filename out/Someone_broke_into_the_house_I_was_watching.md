As a 16 year old with overprotective parents it was always difficult to find work. I wanted to get a job and save for college, but my parents didn’t like the idea of me working around creepy old men so I was left to find work mowing lawns and babysitting kids.

Despite their reservations about me getting an actual job, my parents were more than happy to help me make money elsewhere. It was because of this that I met Dave, a friend of my dad’s from work.

Dave was a single guy with no kids and a position a few above my father’s, which meant he had a much, much nicer abode than my father. Of course, having a nicer house meant it was more prone to a break-in if people believed that the owner was away. This idea wouldn’t have bothered Dave if it weren’t for the fact that the last time he’d gone away he came home to his living room trashed. Lucky for him, it seemed that some kids had just used it as a hangout instead of robbing it, but still, he had become paranoid of leaving the place unguarded.

This is where I came in. Dave needed to go out of state for a night and needed someone to watch the place. Due to a combination of it being a Saturday night and my girlfriend cancelling our plans due to a family emergency, I was able to watch the place.

Upon arriving to familiarize myself with everything, Dave gave me a whole spiel about how everything worked. 

“That there is the computer you will be using to watch over everything. It’s connected to all of the cameras outside.” He said, looking at the laptop on his desk.

Dave continued “Good news and bad news about the cameras though. Bad news is that they’re only outside, and they don’t have a night vision mode. Good news is that I have motion sensing lights, meaning you can’t see a lot of the time, but you can when it counts.” 

Dave paused for a moment.

“And it should alert you when the lights turn on. If you want, you can even link your phone to the computer for the night and get the notifications on there.” He said, taking a moment to think about the next thing he needed to say.

“And don’t worry about the login. I left it all on a sticky note attached to the screen.”

“Sounds good.” I said, with no intention of regularly checking the cameras. After all, a break-in would only occur if someone thought the place was empty, and if my car were in the driveway they’d be stupid to assume such.

“Alrighty then. Looks like you’re all set for the night.” Dave said, beginning to walk through the hall and down the stairs to the front door as I followed.

“Before I leave, is there anything you need to ask about?” He asked.

I took a look around the room before answering, as though looking for something to ask about.

“Don’t think so sir.” I said, reaching out for a handshake.

“Good. Good.” He said, grabbing my hand.

“I hope to be back by three tonight, five at the latest. If there’s any delays I’ll let you know. If you need to sleep here, feel free to. Just make sure not to use my room.”

And just like that, he left. And I was all alone.

The first thing I did after he left was power up the laptop and connect my phone. Just in case anything were to happen. 

Most of the night was normal, I spent the first few hours in the living room watching a TV show that I’d been needing to catch up on. I was just starting my fifth episode of the night when I suddenly heard a nearby tapping. 

At first, I couldn’t quite place where it was coming from. I paused the TV and tried to place the sound, but it had stopped. I was about to start the show again, assuming I had been hearing figments of my imagination when I heard it again. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.*

Despite stopping after the fourth tap, I could tell it  was coming from the window to my left. I turned, only to see no one. I got up to get a closer look only to be met with the plants cultivated just outside the window, with only complete darkness beyond them. 

“Must be one of the plants.” I thought to myself.

The night went on and I brushed the incident off.

It was about an episode and a half later that I heard the sound again. This time it wasn’t coming from the window. It was further this time, despite this I could tell the sound was much louder. I quickly paused the television and got up to investigate.

I found myself in the hall, outside the room Dave had told me was the laundry room when he gave me a tour. I pressed my ear against the door.

*Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.*

“What the fuck?” I thought to myself.

The sound wasn’t just coming from the laundry room. It was coming from the other side of the door. 

Upon coming to the realization that whoever was tapping was now in the house, I quickly ran to my phone and dialed the police. 

“911 what’s your emergency?” I heard the operator say.

“I’m keeping an eye on this guy’s house for the night and someone’s in the house.”

“What’s your current address son?”

“It’s *REDACTED* drive.” I said.

“Alright son. Where in the house are you currently?”

“The living room.”

“Can you get to the front door?” 

“Yes sir.”

“Head through there.”

I was standing a mere 4 feet from the front door when I heard it.

*Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.*

“Fuck.” I muttered.

“Is everything alright son?” The operator asked.

“There’s another person on the other side of the door.”

“Alright son, stay calm. Is there somewhere you can hide? Ideally a small room you can lock?”

I thought for a moment. I was about  to say the downstairs bathroom when I remembered Dave told me that the lock on that door was iffy at best. I knew there was another room downstairs that had a lock, but couldn’t for the life of me remember which one. This left me with one solid option.

“Yes. There’s a bathroom upstairs.” I said.

“Good. Head up there quickly but quietly.”

It was only as the operator said that that I realized one fatal flaw. The stairs were in the hall. Thankfully, they weren’t past the laundry room, but it was close enough to make the thought of the trek cause every hair on my body to stand tall. 

The next thing I knew I was a couple of feet from the stairs. As I was just about to reach the bottom step, I looked over at the laundry room door. The door was wide open.

Upon seeing that, I hightailed it up the steps and into the bathroom on my left, locking the door behind me.

“I’m in the bathroom now.” I said.

“Good. Help is on its way. Stay on the phone and stay quiet.”

A few moments passed before I heard the sound that made my heart stop.

*Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.*

“Fuck.”

“What’s wrong son?”

“They know I’m here. They’re right outside my door.”

“Stay absolutely silent sir.” The operator said.

“This is how I die.” I thought. No window to jump out of. No weapon to defend myself. It was just a matter of time until the person on the other side of the door busted it down.

I prepared myself for my final thoughts when suddenly I heard sirens. The next thing I knew, an officer was pulling me out of the tub. 

I was asked a multitude of questions while the other cops searched the house, to find nothing. Once I explained that I was house sitting, the officers decided to stay with me until Dave got home.

When he got home, Dave was immediately frightened and asked the first person he saw what happened. The officer explained there had been a break-in and that no one was harmed, but that anything he could provide that might clue them in on who did it would help. Dave gave them access to the camera footage for the night, which later became public.

I haven’t been back to that house since. I constantly think about how close I came to losing my life, and wonder what the people responsible for what happened were doing there. The police seem to think it was a robbery, but nothing was stolen. 

I’ve tried to move on from this incident but no matter how hard I try, there is one detail that still haunts me. 

How did they get into the house without setting off the lights? At first I thought I had maybe disconnected my phone by accident at some point during the night, but upon watching the footage over, and over again, I just can’t bring myself to believe that.
