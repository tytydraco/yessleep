Being an artist is tough, musicians barely get paid on streaming platforms, filmmakers depend on contacts and luck to thrive on a very competitive industry, and painters like myself are being slowly but surely replaced by photographers and AI. They say desperation makes you reckless, and maybe that's true. When I first met the old man in the black suit I was three months behind on rent and eating plain rice for dinner. My paintings weren’t selling, and every day felt like I was teetering on the edge of something I couldn’t come back from. So, when he knocked on my door with his strange offer, I didn’t ask enough questions.

“You’re Sophia Ramirez?” His voice was smooth, precise, like the kind of man who always got what he wanted.

“Yes, that’s me” I replied, gripping the doorframe. He didn’t look like someone who’d buy art, more like a lawyer or a banker. But when he opened a leather briefcase to reveal stacks of crisp bills, I didn’t care who he was.

“I need a painting,” he said, stepping inside without waiting for an invitation. “An abstract depiction of Hell. Something… authentic.”

“Hell?” I repeated, raising an eyebrow. “Why not just buy one of those medieval-style ones? Bosch, Bruegel, that kind of thing?”

He smiled faintly, as if I’d said something amusing. “Those are interpretations. I'm getting sick of the pitchforks and flames. I’m asking for something new. Raw. True.” He placed a thick envelope on my rickety kitchen table. “600 dollars. This is now, the rest will come upon completion.”

I stared at the money, my throat tightening. “How big do you want it?” I asked, trying to sound professional.

“Big enough to adorn my office walls” he said, handing me an old looking piece of paper with handwritten instructions: Capture the truth of Hell.

Before I could ask any follow-up questions, he left his contact card, turned and walked out, leaving behind the faint scent of cigarrettes and fancy perfumes.

The first week was fine. Great, even. I felt inspired for the first time in months. I bought a massive canvas and spent days splashing reds, blacks, and grays onto it, creating chaotic swirls and jagged lines. Hell, as I imagined it, wasn’t fire and brimstone, it was confusion, desperation, and endless motion.

At first, I told myself the unease I felt was just my usual perfectionism. The sensation of being watched and judged as I painted was my overactive imagination. The shadows creeping across the room late at night were just tricks of the light. Then, small things started happening.

By the second week, I noticed the painting changing.

Not dramatically, just subtle things. Lines I didn’t remember painting. Colors I hadn’t used. One night, I could’ve sworn the swirling reds on the canvas looked like flames. The next morning, they were either placed in different spots of the canvas or completely gone.

I’d wake up in the middle of the night, sweating, my chest tight as if someone had been sitting on it. The air smelled faintly of smoke. My phone glitched constantly, texts disappearing before I could read them. I tried to brush it off. Stress, I told myself. That’s all it was.

“Hey, Soph, you okay?” My mom called one afternoon. I was elbow-deep in paint and barely heard the phone ring.

“Yeah, I'm just busy,” I said, forcing cheer into my voice.

“You sound tired. Are you eating?”

I paused. When was the last time I ate something that wasn’t instant noodles? “I’m fine, Mom. Just working on a big commission.”

“Well, don’t overdo it,” she said, her tone softening. “Your uncle’s worried about you too. He said he tried calling.”“Your uncle Mario’s worried about you too,” my mom said during one of our calls. “He told me he tried calling you three times this week. You know how he gets when you don’t answer.”

I sighed, guilt settling into my chest. “I’ve just been swamped, Mom. I’ll call him back.”

“Don’t make him wait,” she said softly. “He’s been… struggling, Sophia. He doesn’t like to talk about it, but the sickness has gotten worse. And you know he hates going to the doctor.”

I leaned against the counter, feeling the weight of her words. Uncle Mario wasn’t just family, he was my safe place. When Dad walked out, Mario stepped in without hesitation. He was the one who took me to school, packed my lunches, and sat through every awkward school play and art show.

He didn’t know anything about art, but he was my biggest cheerleader. I still remember him showing up to one of my college galleries in his old work uniform, a mechanic’s jumpsuit, sticking out like a sore thumb among the suits and dresses. But he didn’t care. He walked around, asking about every piece like it was the Louvre.

“You got a gift, Soph” he’d said that night, handing me a small bouquet of daisies. “Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Even if it’s hard, even if no one gets it, you keep painting. That’s what you were meant to do.”

“Mom,” I said, trying to push down the guilt. “I promise I’ll call him.”

“You better,” she said, but there was no anger in her voice. Just worry. “You know how much you mean to him.” 

But I didn’t call him.

The days blurred into one another, and every time I thought about picking up the phone, something stopped me. I told myself it was just because I was busy, but deep down, I knew the truth. I was scared. Scared he’d hear how tired I was, how broken I’d become. Uncle Mario always saw through me, and I didn’t want him to know I was unraveling.

Three weeks passed and I got an email from a client canceling a project I’d been counting on. “Budget issues,” they said, but it felt like something worse. My landlord left a note under my door threatening eviction if I didn’t pay by the end of the month. I knew I shouldn't have spent all my money in materials, but the commission demanded me quality and quantity. Now all I had left from my initial 600 was 40 dollars. My only chance now to keep my shitty apartment was to take another bank loan that would most certainly ruin me. I could ask Mario, of course, but now it had been weeks since my mom asked me to call him and I wouldn't want to reach out just to take his money.

Slowly but surely, the painting had begun to consume me.

I couldn’t stop working on it. Every time I stepped away, my head throbbed, my chest tightened. It was like the canvas demanded my attention. The colors weren’t just colors anymore, they were alive, pulsating under my brush, like the souls of all the damned craved to be liberated from their current hell to my depiction of it. I started painting through the night, sleeping only when exhaustion knocked me out.

My health was the next thing to go. The cough that had started as a mild irritation turned into something worse. I’d wake up hacking into my pillow, my throat raw, my chest aching. Feverish chills left me shivering under layers of blankets, even though it was warm outside. My reflection in the mirror was almost unrecognizable. My cheeks were hollow, my skin pale and clammy. There were dark smudges under my eyes, and my lips were dry and cracked.

Then the nightmares started.

They were always the same. I’d find myself standing in a vast, fiery wasteland. The air was thick with smoke, choking me as I stumbled through rivers of molten rock and jagged black cliffs. Faces stared out at me from the ground—eyes wide with terror, mouths twisted in endless screams. A shadowy figure stood in the distance, watching me. When I tried to get closer, the ground would split open, and I’d fall, fall, fall… I’d wake up gasping, my heart pounding, drenched in sweat. It felt so real, like I’d actually been there. But the next week, that was when Hell truly broke loose.

The painting had become my obsession. No matter how sick I felt or how exhausted I was, I couldn’t stop working on it. Each time I stepped away, a deep, gnawing anxiety clawed at me until I picked up the brush again. It wasn’t inspiration anymore, it was obsession. The reds bled deeper into black, twisting into shapes I swore I didn’t paint. Mopre figures began to emerge, screaming faces pressed into the strokes, writhing limbs half-hidden in the chaos.

But the real chaos was outside the painting.

On Monday, my landlord left another note under my door. “Final Warning: Payment Due Immediately.” I crumpled it without reading the rest.

On Tuesday, my phone started buzzing relentlessly, calls from numbers I didn’t recognize. When I finally picked up, it was a debt collector demanding payment for a credit card I didn't own but was with my name.

By Wednesday, I was coughing so hard I could taste blood. My reflection in the bathroom mirror looked even more alien than before.

And then, on Thursday, my mom called again.

“Mom, I can’t talk right now,” I said, holding the phone between my shoulder and ear as I mixed paint on my palette.

“Sophia,” she said, her voice low and unsteady. “Sophia… it’s about Mario.”

I froze. “What? What happened?”

“He… passed away last night.” Her voice cracked, and I could hear her trying to hold it together. “It was his heart. The doctors said…” She trailed off.

The rest of her words blurred into noise. All I could think about was how I never called him back. How the last thing I said about him was a lie. My mind raced with memories: the time he taught me how to ride a bike, the Sunday mornings we spent making pancakes, the way he always smelled faintly of motor oil and aftershave.

I thought of that last art show he came to, how he insisted on buying one of my paintings even though I tried to stop him. He’d hung it in his living room, right above the TV, proudly pointing it out to anyone who visited.

And now he was gone.

The weight of it crushed me, and for the first time in years, I sobbed like a child.

Her words hit me like a punch to the stomach. “No,” I whispered. “No, that’s not—he was fine. He was—”

“He wasn’t fine, Sophia,” she said, her voice breaking. “He was stressed, he wasn’t taking care of himself, and he wouldn’t tell anyone how bad it really was. He didn’t want to worry us.”

I sank to the floor, my back against the wall. Mario had always been like that. Stubborn, selfless. Always putting everyone else first.

My mom kept talking, but I couldn’t focus on her words. All I could think about was the last time we spoke, no, the last time I didn’t speak to him. The missed calls. The unanswered texts. The promises I never kept.

“Mom, I need to go,” I said abruptly, hanging up before she could say more.

I sat there for what felt like hours, staring at the painting. The faces in the swirling reds seemed more defined now, more tortured. One of them... looked just like Mario.

I crawled across the floor, getting as close to the canvas as I could without touching it. The face wasn’t there anymore. It was just paint, just shadows. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that the painting wanted me to see it.

“Stop it,” I muttered to myself, pressing my palms against my temples. “You’re just tired. You’re grieving. That’s all.”

By Friday, the sickness had worsened. The coughs came in fits so violent I had to clutch the edges of my sink to stay upright. My fever spiked, and every breath felt like I was inhaling ash; and yet, I couldn’t stop.

I painted through the pain, through the tears, through the crushing guilt. Every stroke of the brush felt like it was draining something vital from me, like the painting was taking more than I was giving.

When I finally finished the piece late that night, I collapsed to the floor, my body too weak to stand. The painting loomed above me, more alive than anything I’d ever created. The flames seemed to flicker in the dim light, and the faces, those tortured, screaming faces, seemed to shift and writhe, their agony seeping out into the room.

I lay there, staring at it, when the knock came.

It was a slow, deliberate knock; three sharp raps that echoed through the apartment. My stomach dropped. I already knew who it was.

He was back, the man in the black suit. “It’s done,” I croaked, barely able to lift my head.

He stepped inside, his eyes glowing faintly red. “Magnificent,” he said, running his fingers along the edges of the canvas.

“Take it,” I whispered. “Take it and go.”

He smiled, pulling a silver coin from his pocket. “Your payment,” he said, tossing it to me.

I caught it instinctively, and the moment the cold metal touched my palm, the world cracked open.

The apartment vanished. I was standing in a vast, barren wasteland, the air thick with ash and the stench of burning flesh. The ground beneath my feet was hot, cracked, and oozing with molten rivers of something dark and alive. Above me, the sky burned, a sickly red expanse, churning with shadows and flames.

And there it was: my painting.

It towered over the landscape, no longer a canvas but a living monument. The faces were no longer confined to the strokes of paint, they screamed and writhed, their torment echoing through the fiery expanse.

I tried to step back, but my feet wouldn’t move. I turned to look at the, but his face was different now. His eyes glowed like embers, and his teeth were sharp, inhuman.

“The truth of Hell,” the man said from beside me, his voice calm, almost reverent, “is that it always comes back to the creator”. Before I could respond, I felt something cold and heavy in my hand. I looked down to see a brush, its bristles soaked in dark, viscous paint. My other hand moved without my permission, clutching a palette that seemed to shimmer with colors that didn’t exist in the real world.

“No,” I said, shaking my head. “I won’t.”

But my body betrayed me. My feet moved toward the towering painting, my hand rising to the surface as if pulled by an invisible force. The moment the brush touched the living canvas, I felt it—the weight of its hunger, the endless void demanding more.

I painted and painted, the shapes twisting under my strokes, the faces multiplying, the screams growing louder.

Time became meaningless. Days, weeks, years; none of it matters. I paint until my arms ache and my fingers bleed, until my vision blurs and my body begs for rest. And still, the painting demands more.

At some point, I realized I was back in my apartment, though it was hardly recognizable. The walls were cracked, the windows covered in soot. My easel stood in the center, the painting smaller but no less alive, its flames licking at the edges of the room.

I barely noticed when my phone rang. I barely noticed anything anymore. But I forced myself to answer when I saw my mother’s name.

“Sophia?” Her voice was hesitant, strained. “You haven’t answered in weeks. Are you okay?”

I wanted to tell her the truth. I wanted to scream for help. But the words caught in my throat, and all that came out was: “I’m working. Almost done.”

I hung up before she could reply.

The next time I looked at the painting, I knew it was nearly over.

One final touch, one final stroke, and my work would be ready for the world. And so I remain, confined to an eternity of painting in a world only I could see, each stroke dragging me further from myself until there is nothing left.

Nothing but the art.
