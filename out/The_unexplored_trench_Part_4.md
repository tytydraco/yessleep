[Part 3. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gd4fv8/the_unexplored_trench_part3/)

  
We began the next descent in an uneasy silence, none of us speaking more than absolutely necessary as the submersible dropped lower and lower into the vastness of the ocean. ANEX’s presence hung over us, unseen but deeply felt. Their vessels hovered just out of sight, their personnel posted strategically, and the silence on the radio only heightened the sense that we were being watched. The weight of their scrutiny was almost suffocating, yet they’d left us little choice but to dive again. 

The shuddering hum of the submersible’s engine was our only companion, each vibration rattling up from the metal floor and into our bones. Emily sat beside me, her face tight and resolute, though the strain was clear in her eyes. Dr. Miles was tense, his usual scientific curiosity smothered by the grim reality of what we were facing. The lingering memory of the creature—the immensity of its size, the depth of its unfathomable gaze—loomed large in our minds. The horror we’d barely escaped last time hadn’t left any of us unscathed. 

After what felt like an eternity, the lights from the surface finally faded, and we slipped once more into the deep’s endless darkness. 

“Almost at depth,” I muttered, half to myself, checking our position on the monitor. The quiet stretched on, the pressure building as the pitch-black water pressed closer around us. Our lights cut through the darkness, casting beams into the void like fragile threads trying to pierce a hidden world. 

Ahead of us lay the seabed, and soon our instruments began to pick up irregular shapes scattered across it. 

“Alright, turning on external floodlights now,” Dr. Miles said as he flipped a switch, and our submersible’s floodlights illuminated the ocean floor in a harsh, almost surgical white light. 

The sight that greeted us was a vision of horror. 

The remains of ANEX’s battle lay scattered, shredded and broken, across the silty seabed. Equipment lay in pieces, half-buried under disturbed sand. Metallic fragments, scorched black and twisted beyond recognition, jutted from the ocean floor like the remnants of a forgotten war. Nearby, the ruined shells of two small submersibles lay collapsed, each torn open as if crushed by an immense force. 

“Oh my god,” Emily breathed, her face pale as she took in the devastation. “It… it’s worse than I imagined.” 

Dr. Miles leaned forward, his face illuminated by the glow of the monitors. “It’s like a graveyard. It tore through them… they didn’t stand a chance.” 

The destruction stretched farther than our lights could reach, the shadows around us thick with the ominous unknown. Every angle, every broken piece, told the story of a brutal, one-sided battle that had ended in pure annihilation. Yet what caught our attention next was far worse. 

Feasting on the remains, amidst the twisted metal and fragments of human equipment, were strange creatures that defied any categorization. They looked like crabs at first glance, their armored bodies covered in barnacle-like growths, but as they shifted and scuttled through the wreckage, we could see their legs were tipped with thin, sharp spines, which they used to pierce and tear at the debris. 

But what drew my attention, what made my stomach twist with revulsion, was the way they attacked the remnants of ANEX personnel. Several limbs—human limbs—lay scattered among the wreckage, partially buried under the sand. One of the creatures latched onto a severed arm with a claw that rotated in a jerky, unnatural way, as if it were tasting the flesh with each twist and turn. 

“Oh god…” Emily whispered, her hand covering her mouth as she turned away from the screen, unable to watch. “This can’t be real. Those things…” 

They weren’t merely scavenging—they seemed to savor every piece, every fragment of the carnage, moving in concert, each motion slow and calculated, as though relishing the aftermath of destruction. Their bodies glistened with a translucent sheen, and through their shells, we could see something shifting within—a dark, pulsating mass that throbbed with a sickly green light. 

“They’re… they’re drawn to the remains,” Dr. Miles murmured, his voice a mixture of horror and fascination. “Like parasites. Feeding off the remnants of the creature’s destruction.” 

I forced myself to keep watching, my mind racing. These creatures were unlike anything I’d ever encountered in all my years of marine research. They seemed to embody a primal aspect of the deep’s ecosystem—a reminder that down here, life and death were intertwined in grotesque ways. 

As we drifted closer, the lights caught one of the creatures full-on, and for a brief, horrific moment, I thought it was looking back at us. Its mouthparts—gnarled, jagged appendages—twitched as if tasting the water, sensing our presence, and then it scuttled off into the darkness, leaving the mutilated arm behind. 

“Let’s keep moving,” I said, my voice taut. “There’s nothing more for us here.” 

The silence that followed was heavy, filled with an unspoken sense of dread. The only sounds were the faint hum of the engine and the occasional flicker of static from the radio. But none of us dared speak, our minds overwhelmed by the grisly spectacle we’d just witnessed. 

As we moved away, leaving the macabre feast behind, a question settled at the back of my mind, gnawing at me. If those creatures were here, scavenging the remains, where was the main creature? The one we’d come to fear? Its absence was almost as unsettling as its presence had been. 

We moved deeper into the region, our lights cutting through the gloom, illuminating the seabed with its odd formations, jagged rocks, and more scattered wreckage. But the silence was oppressive, thick with a sense of waiting, of something immense lurking just beyond the reach of our lights. 

“Do you think ANEX really understood what they were dealing with?” Emily’s voice cut through the quiet, low and wary. 

“I don’t think anyone could,” I replied. “Even now, knowing everything we do, I don’t think we fully understand it. This creature—it’s beyond anything we could’ve anticipated.” 

Dr. Miles nodded, his expression grim. “I don’t trust them. They see this creature as something to be controlled, something to be used or destroyed. But it’s more than that—it’s like it’s part of the ocean itself, something we’ve only just begun to scratch the surface of.” 

The uneasy silence settled over us again, broken only by the faint hum of the engine. Our descent continued, deeper into the ocean’s pitch-black depths, each meter adding to the crushing weight above us. 

Then, without warning, the lights from ANEX’s vessels—faint but distinct—suddenly winked out, one by one. 

“What the…?” Dr. Miles leaned forward, his face pale in the dim light. “Did they just… lose power?” 

Our radios crackled, filled with the sounds of garbled voices and frantic shouting, but the words were barely discernible, distorted by static. Then, a deafening crash echoed through the water, followed by another, closer this time, and I felt the submersible shake as if something enormous had moved past us, disturbing the water in its wake. 

“Did you feel that?” Emily whispered, her voice trembling. 

Before I could answer, another crash reverberated through the depths, and a shadow drifted through the darkness, just outside the reach of our lights. It moved with a terrifying grace, its body a massive, sinuous shape that seemed to absorb the light rather than reflect it. 

The creature’s body moved, and for a brief, heart-stopping moment, we saw it—a single, enormous eye, larger than our submersible, staring back at us. Looking into the creatures' eye again noticing the wrinkled, scarred flesh, surrounding its eye but within its depths, I could see a swirling, galaxy-like void that seemed to stretch endlessly inward. It was as if the creature held an entire universe within its gaze—a vast, ancient expanse filled with stars, distant galaxies, and swirling nebulas. 

We were utterly insignificant, like specks of dust drifting through its world. The eye was a cosmic horror in itself, a reminder of how small we were, how little we understood. It was a creature not just of the ocean, but of something far greater, something that defied all comprehension. 

And as it stared at us, I felt a cold, creeping sense of dread. The creature wasn’t just examining us—it was studying us, measuring us, as if deciding whether we were worth sparing… or consuming. 

Then, with a sudden, graceful movement, it turned and disappeared into the darkness, leaving us alone once more.  

The submersible was filled with an eerie silence as we sat, breathless, in the wake of the creature’s departure. The image of its eye—a void filled with stars and secrets older than time—was etched into my mind. None of us dared to speak, as though words might shatter the fragile stillness that had settled around us. 

And then, through the tense quiet, the radio crackled to life. 

“Expedition, this is Colonel Harrison! Come in!” The colonel’s voice was frantic, a stark contrast to his usual composed tone. “You need to pull back. I repeat, get out of there—now!” 

I fumbled with the radio, my hand trembling as I pressed the button. “This is Dr. Ellison. Colonel, we’ve encountered… something down here. It’s beyond anything we can control or understand. What’s going on up there?” 

Static filled the line for a heartbeat before the colonel’s voice broke through again, laced with a fear that was both immediate and contagious. “We don’t have time to explain, Doctor! We’re launching an assault to neutralize it—if you’re too close when it starts, there won’t be anything left to bring you back.” 

A heavy silence settled over the cabin as his words sank in. The reality of our situation struck like a knife to the gut. 

“An assault?” Emily’s voice was barely a whisper, her face pale as she clutched the edge of the console. “They’re actually going to try to kill it?” 

I could hear the colonel’s labored breathing, tense and uneven, as though he were battling his own panic. “We’re out of options, Dr. Ellison. This thing… it’s a threat we can’t let slip away. Just get yourselves out of there, now. For god’s sake, don’t look back.” 

Dr. Miles was already gripping the controls, his fingers shaking. “We don’t have time to argue. Everyone, hold on!” 

The engine roared to life, the hum of the submersible vibrating through our seats as we began our ascent. The lights cast long, sweeping shadows across the seabed as we rose, illuminating the remains of ANEX’s equipment, scattered like grave markers on the ocean floor. I could feel the weight of the deep pressing against us, each meter adding to the dread growing in my chest. 

But the calm didn’t last long. 

A deep, rumbling sound began to echo from above, a low-frequency drone that vibrated through the submersible’s walls. It was rhythmic and pulsing, like the beating of a massive heart. It took me a moment to realize that it wasn’t just our submersible trembling—the very water around us was shifting, growing more turbulent as the assault began. 

“What… what are they doing?” Emily asked, her voice barely audible over the vibrations. 

“They’re probably using sonar pulses to disorient it,” Dr. Miles said, his knuckles white as he gripped the controls. “And from the sound of it, they’re turning up the frequency. It’s… it’s like they’re trying to drive it into a frenzy.” 

The submersible shuddered violently, the lights flickering as the water churned around us. Shadows danced and twisted outside the viewport, casting dark, shifting forms that seemed to pulse in time with the sound waves. 

I clutched my seat, feeling a wave of nausea wash over me as the vibrations intensified. “We need to get higher, faster. If it decides to come back, there’s no way we’ll survive down here.” 

But even as I spoke, I felt a cold, creeping certainty settling into my bones. The creature wasn’t just an animal—it was something ancient, something that understood far more than we could comprehend. And the assault was only making it angry. 

Another pulse rocked the submersible, harder this time, and through the viewport, I saw something move in the distance, a dark shape sliding through the water like an ominous shadow. 

“It’s coming back,” Dr. Miles muttered, his voice barely audible. “We’re not going to make it.” 

The creature’s form grew larger as it closed the distance, its massive body undulating with a terrifying grace. Its skin seemed to shimmer with an otherworldly light, flickering and shifting as it approached. I felt a primal fear take hold, as though I were watching something that shouldn’t exist in our world, something too vast, too powerful. 

“Colonel!” I shouted into the radio, my voice cracking with panic. “It’s coming for us—abort the assault! It’s going to—” 

The radio cut to static, and the next pulse from above was followed by a deep, guttural roar that reverberated through the water. The sound was low and resonant, more felt than heard, and it sent shivers down my spine. The creature was furious. 

Before we could react, the creature shot forward, moving with a speed that defied its massive size. Its maw opened wide, revealing rows of teeth that glistened with a sickly luminescence. The submersible rocked violently as the creature rushed past us, drawn to the source of the assault above. Its tail whipped through the water, creating a shockwave that slammed us backward, nearly spinning the vessel. 

“Hold on!” Dr. Miles shouted, wrestling with the controls as he tried to stabilize us. 

Through the viewport, I caught a glimpse of the creature as it surged upward, its enormous body stretching far beyond our field of vision. It was like watching a mountain come to life, a dark titan rising from the depths with the fury of a natural disaster. The lights from ANEX’s vessels illuminated it briefly, casting the monstrous form in stark relief against the darkness. 

Then, in a horrifying instant, the creature was upon them. 

Through the viewport, we watched as it tore into the ANEX vessels with a savagery that left no doubt of its anger. The creature moved with terrifying speed, its massive jaws snapping shut around one of the smaller crafts, splitting it in half with a sickening crunch. Pieces of metal and equipment spilled into the water, sinking slowly as the creature tossed the remains aside like scraps. 

“Oh my god…” Emily’s voice was trembling, her face pale as she watched the carnage unfold. 

The creature’s massive tail swept through the water, colliding with another vessel and sending it spinning out of control. I could see the bright flashes of explosions as it shattered on impact, torn apart by the force of the blow. The creature’s roar echoed through the water, a sound of pure rage that shook us to our core. 

“Colonel, do you read us?” I shouted into the radio, desperate. “Pull back! It’s destroying everything—” 

The radio crackled to life again, filled with frantic shouts and broken transmissions. I could make out snippets of voices, panicked orders, screams. Then, just as quickly, the static returned, leaving only the hum of the submersible and the distant sounds of destruction above. 

“They’re all… they’re all gone,” Dr. Miles said, his voice hollow. “It tore them apart.” 

The water around us was thick with debris, fragments of metal and machinery drifting slowly downward. The creature’s massive form loomed above us, its body a dark silhouette against the faint light from the surface. For a moment, it seemed almost still, as though it were assessing the damage, savoring its victory. 

Then, slowly, it began to turn. 

The creature’s massive eye swept over the wreckage, coming to rest on our small, insignificant submersible. The dark orb filled the viewport, larger than life, and I felt an overwhelming sense of dread as it fixed its gaze on us. Within its depths, I could see something more than just a reflection—it was as if the eye held entire galaxies, stars and nebulae swirling in an endless expanse. It was a sight that defied explanation, a reminder of the creature’s otherworldly nature. 

“It’s… it’s looking right at us,” Emily whispered, her voice barely audible. 

The creature’s gaze was a weight, pressing down on us, filling the cabin with a suffocating silence. I felt as though I were staring into the abyss itself, a place beyond time and space, where human comprehension had no place. 

Then, with a slow, deliberate motion, the creature began to move toward us. 

“Ascend! Now!” I shouted, panic clawing at my throat. 

Dr. Miles didn’t need to be told twice. He threw the controls forward, and the submersible jolted upward, the engine straining as we accelerated. The creature’s eye followed us, watching, studying, as though it were considering whether to pursue us or let us go. 

The water churned around us as we rose, the darkness closing in as the creature’s form grew smaller, fading into the black depths below. But even as it disappeared from view, I could still feel its gaze, lingering in my mind—a silent, cosmic reminder of the horrors that lay hidden in the depths. 

As we ascended, the radio crackled once more, filled with the faint, desperate voice of the colonel. His words were barely discernible through the static, but I caught fragments—a warning, a promise, a plea. 

“… never should have gone… impossible… it’s still…” 

The radio fell silent, and we continued our ascent, the oppressive weight of the deep lifting slowly. But the horror lingered, a dark stain on our souls, a reminder.
