[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oml2ux/the_hotel_part_2_everything_seems_empty_here_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Since we'd first set foot in that hotel, nothing had gone normally. It was time to take stock, to gather everything we'd noticed, to try and get a clearer picture and perhaps uncover a new lead. I started listing everything that came to mind for Mia. 

 

\- “If I forget something, don't hesitate to remind me. So… We know:   

\- There are special customers who all speak an unknown language, but can also speak ours. -They are the only ones allowed to eat in the restaurant in the evening.  

\-The symbol on the ground is unknown to us.  

\-The lady in white can access level -2 while we are forbidden from going to the basement.  

\-The lady in white wasn't at the restaurant with the special guests. Was she one of them? 

\- One side of the hotel is entirely built into the mountain, so logically there are no windows, and therefore no rooms. (to be verified) 

\-The noises in the ventilation ducts sounded like a child's cries for help. No one else seems to have heard it.  

\- Our room key is blue; there are more missing at reception, but we haven't seen any other regular guests. Where are they? 

\- Special clients appear to have red keys.   

\- Apart from the special guests in the restaurant at lunchtime, the head waiter, and the lady in white, we didn't see a single person in the hotel or outside. We didn't see the special guests entering or leaving the restaurant. 

I think I've thought of everything.” 

 

\- “That’s a lot. We’ve only been here since yesterday afternoon, and we already have such a long list.”  



\- “I know… I don’t want to upset you, but I still wanted to point out that none of these events are “paranormal”.  



\- “Are you serious? Is that what comes to mind? To prove that you're still right for the moment?”  

  

\- “Well… I guess so…” 

 

I didn't see anything wrong with it, but it seems it wasn't the right time to bring it up again. I guess we all cling to what makes us feel safe at certain times. For me, it was my ego. Mia was outraged by my behavior; she had a hard time understanding me. 

 

\- “So what good will our investigation tonight do?” she yelled at me.  

 

\- “To eliminate all possibilities. I don't think there's anything ghostly, or that the hotel is haunted, but investigating and checking everything with your equipment can only add or remove elements to our questions.”  

 

She wanted to make sure I understood her exasperation, so she sighed loudly, raising her hands before continuing in a condescending tone.  

\- “Okay, so what do you think is going on here?”  

 

I looked at the list of events, thought for a few seconds.  

\- "It might be a cult. Could the hotel be their meeting place?"  

 

\- “A cult? Yes, why not, and what about the child we heard screaming? A sacrifice?”  

 

Talking about that moment again made me really uncomfortable; I didn't want to think about it again. I was a coward and wanted to pretend that what I had heard wasn't what I had heard.  

 

\- “Auditory pareidolia.” 



Mia slapped me, she was beside herself, my stubborn asshole behavior had reached her limit of tolerance.  

\- “How dare you question that child’s screams and cries! It was horrible! I heard it too! The same thing as you! Word for word! Alec, you’re going too far. I’ll chalk it up to fatigue and shock. It seems you’re refusing to see what’s happening here. I told you, fear is blinding you.”  

  

I didn't answer. A long silence followed. She stared at me, and I looked away. She finally left me and suggested we go to sleep for a while. The bedroom was a place where we were seemingly safe, and we should take advantage of it. We needed rest; our judgment had been impaired by the past few hours. Not to mention our ability to manage our emotions, which, judging by my still-sore cheek, was practically nonexistent. 

 

I lay with my back to Mia, closing my eyes and trying to think, over and over, think. I went over and over in my head everything that had happened, but something was missing. I felt like I'd missed something. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, and without realizing it, I drifted off to sleep. 

 

—---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 

We were jolted awake by loud banging on the door. The mattress vibrated beneath me; Mia jumped when she woke up. Half asleep, I blinked to check the time: 7 p.m. I went to open the door with slow, mechanical steps. It was room service. Without a word, the attendant handed me the cart and immediately disappeared back down the silent hallway.  

Mia sat on the edge of the bed, staring blankly ahead. I sat down next to her. 

 

\- “How are you feeling?”  

 

\- “I don’t know… I slept but I had nightmares… Well, I think I did. I have the feeling I had them. I can still feel the fear they instilled in me, without remembering what terrified me.” 

 

\- “You should go take a nice hot shower to relax. I'm going to see what there is to eat.” 

 

Dinner lacked originality; it consisted of the same thing as lunch. I took it as mockery, perhaps I was becoming paranoid, but the hotel didn't seem to be making much of an effort towards us. 

Mia was still drying her curly hair as she came out of the bathroom; her brown curls were all messy. She exclaimed: 

 

\- “Let’s go, it’s a good time if everyone eats, isn’t it?”  

 

\- “Are you talking about going around the corridors?” 

 

\- "Of course! Come on, let's get the equipment." 

 

\- "Don't you want to eat a little something first?"  

 

\- “I’m not hungry. Maybe later.” 



This burst of energy surprised me, and I couldn't complain. I agreed. She pulled a handheld camera, a magnetic field detector, a temperature detector, and a voice recorder from her things. She handed me the camera; she wanted me to film her during these tests. 

Suddenly, the room felt different. Colder. Heavier. I felt the pressure rising within me at the thought of a discovery my mind wasn't ready for. I had the uneasy feeling of being watched, judged, as if we were transgressing some invisible rule. Yet I didn't stop Mia when she began to examine the room. I couldn't let fear stop me, as she had already told me. I didn't want to prove her right. 

She climbed onto the bed and moved the magnetic field detector toward the air vent where we'd heard the screams. Her voice became almost academic as she explained that the device could pick up the electromagnetic variations associated with paranormal activity… but that we had to remain cautious, because electrical wiring could interfere with the readings. She scanned the room methodically. Every faint beep, every click of the device made me flinch. She also measured the temperature in several places. Nothing. Silence. 

Just a weak reaction, in front of the mirror. 

Frustration was already rising within her. 

She finally switched off the device abruptly, as if she refused to admit that there was nothing there. 

 

\- “Just some power cables. Let’s go into the hallway.”  

I followed in his footsteps. 

 

There was no one there, no sounds of life coming from the neighboring rooms. We went to the right, toward the elevator. Mia ran her device along the walls and doors, taking the temperature, and I filmed her failing in her search. We moved forward, and she detected nothing. Helpless, she bit her thumbnail, but kept going. Determined. The floor was laid out in a square. So there was indeed a corridor on the mountain side.  

In each corridor, the rooms were on the right, while maintenance or equipment rooms were on the left. Upon reaching the elevator, the device reacted. 

 

\- “There’s something near the elevator. The sensor is going haywire. Objectively, electronics seems the most likely explanation, but it’s an old elevator, there isn’t even a digital display for the floors, it works with a mechanical arrow. I don’t know what to think.”  

 

\- “Could it just be electrical cables? Despite its age, it's very likely there are some. There's light inside the elevator shaft.” 

 

\- “That’s true, but there should also be some in the walls of the corridor we just went through for the lights, and yet the device didn’t react. Simple electrical cables give off a very weak magnetic field, while the device shows rather high activity here. There must be something else going on.”  

 

\- “Shall we take the elevator?”  

 

\- “No, later, perhaps, let’s continue down the corridors.” 

 

We continued walking, slowly, Mia combing every nook and cranny with her devices, but nothing, absolutely nothing, total emptiness. No reaction in the corridor through which the woman in white had arrived. In the one at the end, where, logically, there couldn't be a window. There were indeed bedroom doors, four of them. The other corridors had six bedrooms. I pointed this out to Mia, still absorbed in the measurements of her devices. 

 

\- “There are fewer rooms in this corridor, perhaps they are larger. But no windows? That's really strange. The detector isn't reacting, the temperature remains stable, it's dropped slightly by one degree but nothing conclusive. It's really disappointing.” 

 

She raised her head and looked down the corridor as a whole, turning her head from right to left. 

 

\- “Perhaps these aren’t rooms?”  

 

\- “I could have thought the same thing as you, but look, the rooms have 3-digit numbers, and these numbers follow each other all the way through. The premises, on the other hand, don't have numbers.”  

 

\- “That’s true. Besides, how do they know which room is used for what if there are no signs on it?”  



\- “Indeed. There's only one door next to our room, which has a yellow lightning bolt symbol, probably an electrical panel. Now that you mention it, it's also the only room on the right side of the corridors, while the others are all on the left.” 

 

\- "If the rooms are all on the left, they form a kind of large central cube. Do you think all these doors without markings open onto a single room?" 

 

\- "It's not impossible." 

 

I shrugged in disbelief. Too many questions were piling up. We had one corridor and the second half of our own left before reaching our room. All we had to do was close off this floor. Without much hope of discovery. 

  

**“DING!”**  

  

The elevator.  

The doorbell had just rung; someone was likely to arrive. Mia and I stared at each other, eyes wide; we really didn't want to run into anyone. Frozen in place, we remained there, unable to react. I mustered all my mental strength to manage to speak. 

 

\- “Take the camera. Don't make any noise, go to the other corridor, ready to leave. I'm going to go see.” 

 

She didn't answer me, and she complied. With my back against the wall, I slowly approached the corner it formed with the elevator corridor and crouched down. I activated my phone's camera to use it as a mirror so I could observe discreetly. On the screen, I saw the arrow indicating the floors I'd ascended, stopping with a second, ominous **"DING"** on the first floor.  

 I breathed a sigh of relief, my hand on my chest; I thought my heart was going to give out for good. Sitting on the floor with my head in my hands, enjoying the wave of security that had washed over me, I had barely caught my breath when I heard the elevator's gears start up again. My body froze, I slid, trembling, my phone along the baseboard and looked at the screen. The arrow rose, and rose, until it reached our floor and the doors opened.  

The woman in white. My phone was a little too far away for me to get a proper look at her, but I could see that her dress was stained with red. Blood? She was soaked in it; the blood was still running down the fabric, leaving a long trail on the hallway floor. A slit in the dress revealed her thin, white leg and her pair of ivory stilettos, glistening with the still-warm liquid.  

Messy splashes had covered her until she managed to plaster her large hood. What situation could have put her in such a state? A remake of Carrie?  

She was walking in my direction; one of the four windowless rooms had to be hers. I could hear her heels clicking on the hallway tiles, the sound getting closer and closer. I pressed the record button with my thumb. I stayed there, watching the screen for as long as I could. I needed a record of what I was seeing. I was supposed to follow the rules and be discreet, to run away, but I was mesmerized by what I was seeing.  

A hand landed on my shoulder, and I was about to scream when another covered my mouth. It was Mia; she gave me an accusing, questioning look that clearly meant: 

 

 \- " What are you doing ?".  

 

She grabbed my arm and led me down the corridor. I glanced behind us to make sure I hadn't been seen. Just as we rounded the corner, I caught a glimpse of her blood-soaked ivory shoe peeking out from where I'd been standing seconds before.   

  

I put myself in danger. I put us in danger; if Mia hadn't come to get me, she would have seen us within two seconds. 

Upon arriving in the room, Mia immediately questioned me. She hadn't seen him.  

 

\- " But what were you doing ?! " 

 

\- "I… It was the woman, the same woman, the one in white… I think I filmed her. " 

 

\- "Really ?! " 

 

\-  "Yes… It was full of blood." 

 

Mia snatched the phone from my hands and searched through my video files. I sat behind her to watch the screen. She started recording. You could see the woman walking towards me, her long, bloodstained dress trailing on the ground, leaving a wide, sticky trail. Her hood didn't cover her face, but you couldn't see it; her face was blurred, as if distorted by a whirlpool. 

 

\- “Alec, do you see the same thing as me? Everything is perfectly clear. Everything, except his face!” 

 

\- “Yes, I… I don’t know what happened. I’m sorry.” 

 

\- “It’s impossible that the camera couldn’t focus solely on her face, not to mention that strange swirl; it doesn’t look like normal blur. It has to be paranormal. Are you going to deny that here too?”  

 

\- "I…" 

I hesitated, for too long.  

\- “You know what, Alec? Just shut up, I don't want to hear your speculations. This is the only paranormal element I've been able to get today. When I think that you're the one who captured it, I'm disgusted!”   

 

I remained silent, as if suspended outside of time. Sitting on the bed, I rubbed my eyes, certain I'd misjudged it. I picked up my phone and fiddled with the video. Pause. Zoom. Nothing. The image didn't change.  I restarted the video and observed the rest: the dress, the blood, the corridor, the motionless elevator behind her. Everything was clear, perfectly real. Everything… except her face, as if her presence didn't belong to the same world. The sleeves of her long, flowing dress covered her completely down to her hands. I observed her elegant bearing. She seemed to float, yet the click of her heels proved she was making contact with the cold tiles of the corridor.    


That's when I noticed this discreet, quick, and delicate movement: she took her hand out of her sleeve and gestured. Her hand extended in my direction, palm up, her fingers closing gently one by one. An invitation. As if to say, "*Come.*" I replayed that split second several times; I wanted to be sure. Those slender hands, those fingers and nails reddened by blood, the movement of those fingers. I remembered the small smile I thought I'd glimpsed in the elevator's reflection. I realized she always knew when we were there. 

 

This woman is only speaking to me. She knows I'm the only one who's looked at her. This message is for me. I'm sure of it. **For me**.   

 

\- “We have to go back out!” 

Mia had snapped me out of my reverie.  

She looked at me with intensity and determination; telling her no would undoubtedly lead to an argument. But I risked asking a question. 

 

\- “Okay, but where do you want to go?”  

 

\- “I want to go down to the lower floors, I want to see if they are the same as ours.” 

 

I took a few seconds to think: if I don't follow her, she's perfectly capable of going alone, and that's out of the question. The problem is that the meal must be finishing downstairs and we risk running into customers.  

 

Very well, but I have a few conditions if that doesn't bother you, and even if it actually bothers you.  

 

 \- "What are they?"

  

She crossed her arms defiantly, looking down at me as I sat casually on the bed. 

 

\- “We're not taking the elevator; there must be stairs somewhere. The elevator would attract attention, and we risk ending up with other people inside.”  

 

\- “Well, that makes sense, what else?”  

 

\- “If we are in danger, you run away without looking back and go straight to the bedroom.”  

 

\- "And you ?"  

 

\- “You're running away without looking back!”  

 

\- “Pfff, anything else or is that all?”  

 

\- “I know it’s cold, and you don’t want to, but we should eat something. Between the effort, the adrenaline, the fear, our bodies are using up a lot of energy; we’re going to end up fainting.” 

 

She sat down, without a word, in front of her meal, and began to eat. She agreed with my proposals. 

 

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 

It was around 9 p.m. when we left the room. I advised Mia to take only the camera; after all, we hadn't detected any phenomena with her equipment on our floor, and we only wanted to confirm that the structure of the lower corridors was the same as ours. There was no need to carry too much.  

The stairwell door was right next to the elevator. We had to avoid stepping in the trail of blood the woman in white had left behind to get there. The stains were still wet; the blood hadn't dried, forming pools of bright red liquid in which our silhouettes were reflected. The amount of this thick, red liquid was more impressive than we could have imagined. How could anyone carry so much blood on them? I put the question aside; we had other things to do right now. 

 

The stairwell was made entirely of concrete walls, with no windows. It was lit only by flickering neon lights, whose crackling echoes bounced off the walls and into us.  

Our arrival on the second floor was unsettling. It felt as if we hadn't changed floors at all, but had simply returned to the same one. It was identical in every way to ours: the colors, the door layout, the tiles, the elevator door. For a brief moment, I thought we were trapped in a liminal space, or in the backrooms. Not believing in the paranormal didn't make me ignorant. Fortunately, there was one difference: the room numbers, whose first digit changed from 3 to 2. This was the only indication that we had gone down a floor. I decided to break the oppressive silence. 

 

\- “This resemblance is really creepy; the first floor is surely identical too.”  

 

\- “Yes, that’s true. The exaggerated symmetry was already disturbing, but now it’s really… yes, bleak, I can’t find another word. This situation has left me speechless. I feel really… unwell here.” 

 

We had to keep going; we were checking something simple on each floor, and it shouldn't take us long. Lingering wasn't a good idea. I put my hand on Mia's back; I could feel her body twitching. She was terrified, but I selfishly kept going, helping her along. We walked to the far end of the corridor. 

 

\- “Four bedrooms, like on our floor, still without windows, of course.”  

 

\- "Indeed…"  

 

She didn't react to this discovery any further; she must have expected it after seeing the appearance of the entire floor. Her lack of motivation and disappointment were obvious. I tried anyway. 

 

\- “Do you want to go down to the next floor?  

 

\- “No… I don’t expect anything different.”  

 

Her behavior had become really strange; just 10 minutes ago she was enthusiastically suggesting a tour of the other floors, and now she was deflating so easily, her motivation had vanished. 

 

\- “Stay on the stairs, I’ll take a quick look at the first floor and then we’ll go back up.”  

  

She didn't reply.  

Without a sound, I headed towards the stairs, Mia following me with slow steps.  

Unsurprisingly, upon opening the upstairs door, at first glance, it was also completely identical to the others.  

I went through the door and it slammed shut behind me. That's when I saw blood, a large trail of blood, like the one left on our floor. I looked around in a panic. Had I gone back to the third floor? Breathless, I spun around, searching for the room numbers. They were there; I was definitely on the first floor, so why was there the same trail of blood as on the third? I reopened the stairwell door and called Mia over to show her. I was afraid it was a hallucination. 

 

\- “Look, can you see it too? All that blood? Can you see it?”  

 

\- “Yes, yes, I see it.” 

 

I doubled over, relieved by her answer. Mia's eyes were blank; I couldn't understand what was wrong with her. She was like a zombie without purpose. She should have been terrified, but above all, full of enthusiasm for this most peculiar discovery. 

 

\- "Mia, what's wrong with you? You've been acting strange this whole time."  

 

\- “I… I don’t know, I feel… empty, tired… I don’t know. I can’t think straight.”  

 

\- “Okay, listen, stay here, I’ll quickly check the back corridor, and then we’ll go back up, okay?  

 

\- “Okay.” 

 

I ran as quietly as possible, filming the corridor and the blood in it. I hurried so as not to leave Mia alone in her condition for too long. Luckily, the corridors aren't very long, and I quickly reached my destination. The far corridor, unsurprisingly, consisted of four rooms, and the trail of blood—inside or out?—was from the last room at the end. 

I turned back, as the conditions weren't ideal for taking the time to observe in more detail. I found Mia, took her by the sleeve and gently pulled her along with me, and we went back up the stairs to our floor. 

I arrived at this one. I stopped. The floor was clean. Immaculate, white, spotless, dry, and damn clean! How long were we gone? 15-20 minutes maybe? I checked the time on my phone. 10 p.m. We'd been gone for an hour? That wasn't possible, we'd hardly done anything. Mia was still unresponsive, her eyes barely open.  

I grabbed him by the shoulders. 

 

\- “Mia, look! There’s nothing left, there’s no more blood! The phone says we were gone for an hour, that’s impossible!”  

  

No reaction. I insisted. I shook him. 

  

\- “Mia! React! This is when you're supposed to tell me that all of this is paranormal! What's wrong with you?” 

  

\- "Sleep...." 

 

She said nothing else.  

I placed my hand on her forehead. It was a little warm; I wondered if she had fallen ill.   

I supported her by the waist and helped her lie down. Her forehead was beaded with sweat, and her eyes were already tightly closed as soon as she lay down. She was breathing normally; that was the only thing that reassured me.   

 

I sat on the edge of the bed, scanning the room, unsure what to do. Then I noticed the meal cart was gone. It shouldn't have alarmed me; it's normal for employees to collect their equipment.  

But that's when I finally found what I was looking for, that detail I hadn't been able to recall since this morning. Last night we had our meal in our room, just like today. We didn't leave the room, and yet the trolley was gone when those horrible noises woke us up. I hadn't paid any attention to it at the time, and my subconscious kept trying to remind me.  

 We didn't see anyone come to get the trolley. We didn't hear anything and there's no other explanation.   

 Someone entered the room to retrieve it while we were sleeping.
