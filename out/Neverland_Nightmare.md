I walked far and wide, through fields of green and deserts of pale yellow, mountains whos peaks scraped the very sky and valleys that cut deep into the earth. My journey had been a long one but then at the time I believed it was worth it. As I crested the hill that marked the end of my exodus, I caught a glimpse of the Ranch I had travelled so far to witness... The Neverland ranch.

It was more beautiful than any of the descriptions I'd heard before and while it was anything but perfect I felt an immense sense of wonder, having laid my eyes upon this place.

I was shaken from my awe by a sudden noise just feet from my person. A horrible creaking filled the air and I held my breath. My feet planted on the ground as if held in place by railway spikes. "Who else could be out here?" I wondered. I couldn't have guessed who I'd see there, peering out of the tunnel that had been dug beneath the very ground I stood upon. A tall man in a lily white suit crept out from the depths of that tunnel. His smile wide and his eyes marked by a look I'll never forget. He had a sack slung over his shoulder that rivaled the man's size. Fear overtook me as the truth of who stood before me made itself known. It was Diddy Combs!

My blood ran cold and all the wonder I felt having seen this Ranch faded and was replaced with unimaginable terror. His eyes locked with mine and he crept forwards slowly before coming to a stop 6 feet from me. Placing the bag beside him he knelt down to open it. My mind ran Wild with theories as to what terrible things were in that bag. I wouldn't have to wait long as he untied the straps and out spilled what must have been 1000 bottles of baby oil.
He turned to me, his grin somehow even wider than before and said, "You can call me love.It's time for a Freak off!"

I wanted to run but fear had frozen me in place. He must have sensed my dread because his eyes went blank and he got even lower to the ground than before. He grabbed one of the many bottles of baby oil he had been carrying. His fingers teased the top of the bottle and he looked into my eyes.

The disgust I felt was palpable enough to break through my terror and allow my feet to carry me far from this place but after I took my first step a stream of oil shot over my shoulder landing right in front of me. I slipped and began rolling down the hill with incredible speed. As I tumbled down the hill I landed on my right arm with such force I could hear a crack over the inhuman screeching Diddy let out as he pursued me down the hill.

I knew my arm was broken but I knew I had to get away so I gritted my teeth and rose to my feet. I ran as fast as I could but he seemed to have almost superhuman speed. His suit flapped in the wind and he ran at me dual wielding baby oil bottles.

Just when I thought he would catch me a bright light blinded me. I fell to my knees and watched as Diddy was dragged into the sky by none other than Grammy award winning singer and song-writer Michael Jackson! I'd been saved by the GOAT himself. Without his intervention I'm sure I would have been a goner. I saluted Michael as he rose higher into the sky. He returned my salute and said Happy Veterans day before dropping Diddy back to the earth where he made his final impact on our world. That was the last I saw of Diddy Combs and the Neverland Ranch but I never forgot what Michael did for me that day.
