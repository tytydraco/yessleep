The sputtering of my vehicle gave out its last note, and the engine went dead. Towering over me was the asylum in which my target was being held; Nicholas Culpeper. I didn't know much about him and, frankly, I didn't care. Why the chief wanted me to investigate some old man turning senile I didn't know. He hadn't done anything to warrant being investigated, just ramblings of the end. Typical stuff.

  
I walked past the gates of the asylum, flashing my badge to any guard who happened to be looking at me. They always looked bored whenever I passed by here; but not this time. They were alert, suspiciously watching their surroundings instead of dozing off or staring into space.

  
Perhaps this Nicholas fellow could prove to be more entertaining, I thought. Once I reached the doors to his cell, I stopped short. One of the guards stopped in front of me, concern as prevalent on his face as every other person I'd seen before. "Detective, I'm sorry... but I don't think you should enter."

  
I raised a brow, too tired to deal with someone trying to stop a detective from doing his work. "Is he dangerous?"

  
The guard nodded. "He bit the ear off of a nurse earlier today. Told her that no one deserves to be able to listen if they've never heard a song before. In fact, he keeps on talking about this 'Song'. He sometimes hums to himself, but it's all out of tune and-" He stopped to allow himself to breathe, nervously taking a peek back at Culpeper's door. "And then he just goes silent for hours at a time. It's quite frightening really..."

  
I nodded in agreement, knowing there was something wrong. "Thanks for the heads-up. I'll be careful." With that, I entered the padded cell. It was a miserable room, more fit for prisoners than the ill. Only one light bulb was perched atop the ceiling above me, casting its dim light across the room and creating a spotlight for the man who sat at the far end, far too composed for someone who bit someone's ear off.

  
"Mr. Culpeper?" I asked, trying to keep a distance between us. "If you're listening, I've come to help you. If you'd answer a few questions, I will get out of your hair and leave you alone." There was no reply. His eyes bore lazily through me like I wasn't even there. "Excuse me? Did you hear me?" I repeated again, louder this time. Nothing. "What is this about a song you keep-" The moment I mentioned the word song, Nicholas' head jolted up, his eyes wide with realization.

  
"The Song! Have you listened to it?"

  
I paused, debating if I should go along with the ramblings of a madman. "Listen to what?"

  
"The Song. Have you heard of it?"

  
"I'm afraid I have not. Could you explain what it is?"

  
He let out a dreamy sigh like he was in the middle of recalling a pleasant memory in his past. "It... it's in the air. It is our protector, our guardian angel. The Song is everywhere, all around. Even now, it fills my ears. It has taught me so very much. The Song... the Song gave me sight..." I nodded, hoping he would elaborate. When he didn't, I pressed forward.

  
 "And have you always known of this song?"

&#x200B;

  
"No, no! It was the music box that gave me freedom." Now I was getting somewhere.

  
"A music box?"

  
"Yes, a music box!"

  
I knew asking the next question would yield no results, but I went ahead nonetheless. "Could you tell me where this music box is?" Much to my surprise, he didn't immediately respond with riddles. There was a long pause until, finally, he began speaking.

  
"I don't need to tell you that. If you are chosen, then it will come to you."

  
I raised an eyebrow before a sigh followed. What was I doing wasting my time here, I thought. Although, considering his state, the fact I was able to get any information out of him was a miracle. With that, I stood up. "Thank you, Mr. Culpeper. You've been very... Helpful."

  
"May it guide you well." He responded, his words vague as ever.

  
Nicholas' store, aptly named "Culpeper's Music Shop", was just a few blocks from the asylum, nestled at the far end of the city. Caution tape surrounded the entire store, preventing any civilian access. As I ducked under the tape and got closer to the entrance, I found myself swallowing back dread.

  
Somehow, I have gone through murder cases of the most violent nature without so much as batting a lash. Even my own brother's death did little more than make me sad. Yet, this had caused my fingers to hover over my firearm.

  
The moment I entered the building, my hand instinctively reached for the holster of my pistol, grasping the grip firmly. However, it was about what I expected; everything was comprised of wood, its age apparent in every corner. Floorboards creaked beneath each step, and instruments of all variety hung on the walls. The register was blocking even more musical trinkets, each kept safely inside the several cabinets. If the source of his mania was anywhere, my first choice was in there.

  
Unfortunately, my estimate was incorrect. No powder, liquid, or drugs were present whatsoever. I raided the first floor, turning the place upside down. Yet, I couldn't find anything that would cause a man to go mad. The second room didn't yield much results, either.

  
I was standing at the top of the stairs, figuring his store didn't have any evidence, when I heard it. A sound so faint that it was almost muffled by the sound of my breathing. But it was definitely there, the musical notes. Turning to where the source of the sound was, I saw the door to Mr. Culpeper's room.

  
Subconsciously, I had managed to avoid this room until this point, my mind erasing it from sight. But now, I was unable to help myself as I pushed the door open. Slowly, I approached the bedside drawer, where the sound was coming from. The moment I opened the drawer, my eyes shot open in utter horror as I collapsed to the ground. The notes tore through my ears, my vision fading into an endless abyss.

  
My ears, no... My entire body was being torn apart. The pain eventually became tolerable and I could open my eyes. Although, I wish I hadn't. Rubble and debris scattered across the land, the ashen skies raining down molten lead. The stench of sulphur, burning ash, and blood clawed its way into my nose, causing my throat to close. A cacophony of agony tore through the skies, not even the crumbling of civilization able to drown out its piercing tone.

  
The screams, however, were slowly moulded into laughter. Charred corpses emerged from the ground, the sky, and even the very air around me, all singing the same melody. Their voices, despite their larynxs being burned away, all sang the notes in perfect symmetry. The Song. As the melody drew to a close, all at once, the choir ceased to be, a gust of wind picking their now empty skeletons up and carrying them into the abyss above.

  
Silence. My mind tore between wanting the Song back and praying it never returned. The ground shook as it split open, the abyss revealing itself once again. But this time, it wasn't empty. A hand emerged, so dark it sucked the light of the world into itself. The hand grasped the edge, and then a second hand came out, pulling a black figure free from the darkness.

  
It was the most beautiful thing I'd ever laid eyes on. It looked down at me, both with countless eyes and no eyes. To describe it was impossible; vortexes that caved its body infinitely pulled in and absorbed everything, distorting reality and its already incomprehensible form even further. Yet, it didn't drive me mad. Its lips parted, revealing a perfect set of teeth. The simple action of taking in air to speak now felt like a tornado desperately clawing at me.

  
Suddenly, before it could say a single word, I was back to reality. It was abrupt, leaving me feeling empty. It took something from me, and deep down, I desperately wanted it back. The music box was peppered with holes from my pistol, and only then did I realize I was continuing to pull the trigger.

  
I dropped the gun and stumbled onto my knees, eyes refusing to leave the music box. Though it looked ordinary at first glance, I soon realized it was covered in symbols. A swirl that defied the laws of nature, endlessly descending further and further down. Just like the being I saw. There was no way a human was able to carve something this precise down, yet it was here.

  
I stood up, my legs wobbling. I had to get away from here. Staggering to my feet, I looked in the direction of the asylum. I refused to work on this case any further. The chief could fire me and I wouldn't care, I just couldn't stand being near this house, this song, and especially Mr. Culpeper. I managed to stumble my way out of the house and into my car, where I slammed my foot down, driving off with no destination in mind, as long as it was away.  
"Hello, Chief. This is Detective Charles. I am officially dropping the Culpeper case. There was nothing found in his home or the asylum, and my attempts to investigate further proved fruitless."

  
"Are you sure?"

  
"Positive. This is the first time a case has gotten to me, but I'm sure you understand that there are things beyond a detective's capabilities."

  
The chief looked down at the paper, then up at me, before sighing. "Well, alright. I'll mark the case as a failure. I always figured that he just went senile, so it doesn't matter to me either way."

  
I nodded and left his office, taking steps that were a touch too fast; anything to hide how much my legs were shaking. I was supposed to leave the door with newfound relief, but the haunting feeling of the music box never left. Over the period of weeks, I found myself returning to the music box in my mind over and over again. I would turn around and, for an instant, it would be resting on the top shelf. A car would drive past me blasting music, and it would contain two or three of the notes.

  
Not even in sleep was I free. The figure would return, beckoning to me, offering its hand. Each time I refused, things became worse, the visions more intense, and the figure became less and less friendly. I was never someone who believed in the supernatural. I was a firm believer in facts and hard evidence, but there was no denying the music box's power. It wasn't some drug, and it wasn't some hallucination.

  
Finally, after a month of trying to ignore it, I decided to take action.

  
Returning to the asylum wasn't like my first visit. This time, I didn't feel the dread of the unknown or fear of the future. I felt the same confidence I had before meeting the figure, and the desire to know more was far greater than the fear of the consequences. Mr. Culpeper had answers, and I needed them. Walking into the asylum, I was met with the same guard that warned me about Nicholas.

&#x200B;

  
"Detective? I was told you dropped the case, you-"

  
"Nicholas Culpeper," I cut him off, unaware of just how much anger I had contained within. "I need to see him."

  
The guard backed off, looking intimidated. "Okay, okay. Just, uh... Be careful. He's still ill." The moment the door to his cell opened, I rushed inside, closing it shut behind me. Culpeper perked his head up, his eyes narrowing as he stared at my expression. Then, a look of realization spread across his wrinkled features.

  
"You heard it," He stated, more certain about this than the Sun rising each day.

  
I didn't have the patience to beat around the bush. "What the hell was that?" There wasn't any other question I could ask. Nothing else needed to be said.

  
"The Song. What else could it have been?"

  
"What is it? Is it some sort of psychological weapon? Like those experiments where certain frequencies do different things to the human brain?" I had never sounded so panicked in my entire life, yet Culpeper just kept on smiling.

  
"It is not a man-made weapon, detective. It isn't even a weapon. It's a Song. And it is beautiful, isn't it?"

  
I was stunned by his words. "Beautiful?! Are you joking? That thing was terrifying, how could you think-" I bit my tongue, taking a deep breath to recompose myself. As much as I hated to admit it, he was the only person I could ask for help. "Mr. Culpeper, please. I have no idea what is going on. What. Is. That. Music box?"

  
He closed his eyes and, for the first time, I could see a glimmer of lucidity. "I had dreams a while back. The same visions you yourself experienced haunted my every slumber. Each one was more vivid than the last. At the time, I was worried that I had lost my mind," He let out a small chuckle, a smile creeping up the corners of his mouth. His fingers began flowing across the white, padded tiles, swirling through the air over and over again. "But then the Song came. It spoke to me, held my hands and used me to construct the music box. I was given the opportunity to be the messenger, to save humanity from extinction. Don't you realize, detective? You are chosen, just as I was."

  
The silence dragged on, and I didn't realize my hands were shaking until his rested upon them.

  
Culpeper nodded slowly. "I know. I'm asking the impossible. The Song is terrifying, a nightmare incarnate. You will feel your soul being ripped away from your body, and a void of death will replace it. People will think you are mad. You'll be stripped of your titles, your loved ones, and your sanity." He looked into my eyes and, for the first time, I realized it wasn't madness behind them, but something beyond lucidity. "But we the few enlightened ones must make these sacrifices. We are the protectors of the Earth. We have to bear this burden."

  
For the longest time, I just stood there. He must have been having an effect on me because, for a second, I was actually considering what he was saying. This was all just the ramblings of a madman, a deranged psycho who had gone insane from hearing some music. So why couldn't I deny his claim? Why did everything I went through align with what he was saying? I shook my head and rushed out of the door, unwilling to remain a single second more. He was insane, I told myself, burying the seed of doubt that had formed in my mind. I, unlike him, wouldn't indulge in this madness.

  
Those thoughts allowed me to reel my heart rate back to a relatively calm pace. The only thing that could make things better was the radio. The songs always cheered me up. So, turning the knob, I stop at a channel and lean back in the chair, waiting for the melody to come in. But all I got was static.

  
"What?" I grumbled, adjusting the knob in hopes that the signal was just fuzzy. Nothing. The entire station was dead. My eyes narrowed, and I could feel the familiar pit in my stomach burrow further. I tried at other channels, but all of them yielded the same result. All but channel one. The static was accompanied by a low hum that grew louder. A tune played by a piano, or a violin, or something else. Something that sounded so very familiar.

  
Without a second thought, I slammed my fist into the radio, breaking the glass and rendering it useless. I slammed my fist again and again and again. But the song still played. Even when the fragments of plastic and glass imbedded themselves into my hand, letting a waterfall of blood trickle onto my legs, it remained. The bullets I sprayed into the now broken radio did nothing to help, aside from the repercussions piercing my ears with a deafening screech. Those few tranquil moments without the visions didn't last long, however.

  
Once I looked back up, I realized my car was headed straight for a pole. Too terrified to move, I could only slam on the brake, and brace for impact. My head slammed into the wheel, and warm blood slid over my face. My body pathetically fell out the door, but I managed to catch myself. I sprinted down the streets, unsure of where I was headed.

  
The neon lights emanating from a nearby house caught my attention, my paranoia drowning underneath the bass-heavy rock and roll. Then, in the blink of an eye, the bright lights were replaced with a fiery inferno. The building was collapsing in on itself, and the crowd banged against the window, begging to be let out. Their pleas were soon drowned out by the melody, and, just like in the vision, they joined.

  
Once the Song had begun to pick up in volume, I got back to sprinting. My feet moved on their own, and I didn't realize they were guiding me until I found myself at the end of the block, met once more by "Culpeper's Music Shop." The only structure in sight that wasn't reduced to rubble.

  
I shook my head with all the energy I had left, my lips gaping like a fish out of water. I had no control over my body anymore, something pushing me closer and closer. It was warm, like the touch of a mother helping a child first walk. One step at a time, I was led to the entrance. I opened it, this time without the influence of the force.

  
The room was exactly as it was, with the same instruments and furniture. Yet, the atmosphere felt like a completely different room. It was a haven from the terror outside. I looked around, the various instruments hung up on the wall placed exactly where they were. However... Something about them was different. I stumbled to the closest one, a ukelele, and inspected the body. A spiral. The same symbol that had been adorned on the music box, the same one that Nicholas drew in his cell.

  
The string was plucked, and I fell on my back. Another note played, then another, and then, suddenly, all at once, every instrument began playing the Song. My knees buckled, and the floor met me as a friend, welcoming me with its cold embrace. Nothing I did could stop the symphony, and soon enough, my eyes were shut tight, a feeble attempt to block the world out.

  
But as the song continued, the various instruments were beginning to mesh together. Harmonious tones blended into each other, and I no longer felt the urge to cover my ears. Slowly, the melody was beginning to change. The song no longer felt like a hammer pounding into my head.

  
My nails stopped digging into the palms of my hands as my fingers went loose, and the piercing scream ceased, leaving only the Song. Tears, which had been forced out from the intense sound, flowed gently now, and the corners of my lips were starting to lift up.

  
I could hear the choir, their voices muffled by the walls of the house. I could see what Mr. Culpeper was talking about. The Song was beautiful, unlike any melody ever composed by human hands. Lifting myself off of the ground, I approached a piano, one with the same mark carved into the wood. My fingers hovered over the keys, and the notes of the song resonated inside my head.

  
Slowly, my fingers descended onto the keys. I had never been talented in music, let alone playing the piano. Yet, the notes came naturally, and the song sounded as though a master pianist was playing the keys. My head was thrown back as a smile spread across my face, tears and laughter merging as one. I realized my purpose, why my mother had given birth to me, and why the chief assigned me the case. It was all because I was destined to hear this Song.

  
Because I was destined to aid the saviour.

  
The Song starts with Mr. Culpeper, but it won't end with him. It's a terrifying thing, I know. That's why I went through the trouble of posting this. Not for help or to be taken seriously. But so the one who read this and is willing to take the sacrifice, who wasn't afraid of the Song, but rather embraced its beauty.

  
To you, whoever you are, rest assured; the song will find you, as it found me.
