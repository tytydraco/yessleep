Because of potential legal issues, I can't say the name of the place where we had our most recent call, but once I describe it, I’m sure yinz’ll know exactly where I’m talking about. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

It's a store known for its maze-like floorplan full of showrooms painstakingly decorated with their affordable assemble-it-yourself furniture. That's probably more of a giveaway than a hint, but keep in mind that I'm but a humble pest control specialist, not a mind game mastermind. 

Anyways, with the nature of how that store is, I'm honestly surprised we haven't been called there sooner. I could easily see some poor Housekeepers being *very* confused by it, among other atypical household pests. 

But before I get into that case, here's a brief update on how everyone at Orion is doing after the shit storm we dealt with last week.  

To start, I’m fine. I didn't need surgery to fix the internal bleeding, thankfully, and the concussion went away after some rest and NSAIDs. Sure, I felt like shit for days after the hag incident, but better to feel terrible than to feel nothing, right? 

Something that I’m convinced accelerated my recovery was that Deirdre had stayed by my side the whole time. More on that later. 

As far as my coworkers go, they're all fine, too. Victor was back to his usual, grouchy self two days after the incident. Wes fixed himself pretty quickly, so there's no concern about him, either. Thankfully, neither Cerri or Reyna got anything other than some emotional scarring.  

So there you have it: everyone at Orion is alive and well. We're back to business as usual. This is starting to become more normal for us, but I’m not sure if that's a good thing.   

When the store’s manager called us, I initially thought the infestation was, in fact, because of a confused Housekeeper. But the more she told me, the more certain I became that I would be dealing with another pest entirely. 

“So, it started with our showrooms getting rearranged,” The manager began, her voice low as if afraid someone would overhear. “It was little things, at first, like a Vattenkrasse going missing or a Häckpoppel being broken, you know?”

I had no idea what either of those things were, but I pretended like I did just for time's sake.  

The manager kept going, “At first, I thought it was just one of my team members bumping into things and not telling anyone, you know, something *normal.* But then the other night, I was the last one to leave and I heard…”

She got quiet. When she spoke again, she sounded doubtful, “Let's just say, I heard a voice that I shouldn't have been able to hear. It wanted me to follow it.”

Definitely not a Housekeeper. 

First, I asked the most important question, “You didn't follow it, did you?”

The store manager quickly said, “No! God, *no!* Who would be stupid enough to follow a creepy voice into a storeroom?!”

My answer may have been a little too honest, “Ma'am, you'd be amazed.”

She went on to tell me that other employees have heard the voices of people they know, calling to them when working at night, trying to convince them to investigate a certain corner of their massive storeroom. Since then, they'd all been too scared to go near the area. Meanwhile, none of the day shift had reported hearing or seeing anything out of the ordinary.

Where it went from creepy to horrific was when the pest decided to add its own ‘furniture piece’ to one of the showrooms. 

An extremely unfortunate customer had been made into a chair. His limbs served as the chair's legs, his torso the back piece. His head was left on the nearby table as a centerpiece. The pest had even given a name to its grotesque addition, written in what looked like a marker that had been stolen from another display: Köttstol. 

Naturally, they called the police. The cops checked the security footage and told her that Orion would be able to handle the situation better than they could. 

I told her that I’d be there once the store was close to shutting down for the day, thinking it would be best to search for the pest afterhours so that there’d be less chance of a bystander being harmed. I also advised her to have everyone travel in groups. If the culprit of this infestation was what I thought it was, it would be less likely to try to collect one of them if they weren't alone. 

Before locking me in for the night, the manager hurriedly told me that their kitchen had set aside some meatballs in case I got hungry. Since I'd never been to this furniture store before, I was confused and a bit suspicious. What kind of furniture store sells *meatballs?* But according to the internet, I guess this is a regular practice. 

Call it force of habit, but I didn't eat them. The employees all seemed human, at least from the brief time I spent with them, but with the position I'm in, I can't be too careful. A certain Huntsman has used humans to get to me before, after all. 

When it comes to exploring the furniture store, it's a surreal experience, especially when the lights go out. The displays are set up like someone's living space with walls separating each one, complete with fake food and family photos. The gap between the tops of the walls and the warehouse ceiling is where the fantasy of each pristinely decorated interior ends. 

It's a strange, *strange* store and I'm not entirely convinced it was created by humans. 

At first, there were no voices or traces of anything unusual. Just display after display of furnishings with names I would embarrass myself trying to pronounce correctly. 

Hours had passed. I still hadn't made it to the other side of the store. And at that point, no signs of an infestation. The pest was probably apprehensive, since I made no effort to hide Ratcatcher at my hip. It was most likely waiting for an opportunity to catch me off guard. 

Given what the manager had told me, its nest was in the storeroom. It wouldn't be at its nest until the sun rose. It was most likely nearby; I just had to inspire it to show itself. 

I found a showroom that was supposed to look like a sporty kid’s bedroom and took a seat on the mattress, starting to grow bored from the lack of activity. I *knew* it was there, hidden amongst the maze of furniture. It was just taking its sweet time. 

At least, that's what I thought until I saw it peeking over the wall at me. 

Its eyes reflected the light of my flashlight like a cat's, little sparse hairs on the top of its egg-shaped head swirling upwards. It had to be at least twelve feet tall, with how easily it could peer over the wall at me. 

A Gray Man. 

Gray Men are artists, in a sense. Unfortunately, they appear to find living beings to be the best tools for their macabre art installations. Sometimes they use flayed skin as canvases or fabric, other times, it uses entire cadavers to create sculptures, like the man-chair. 

It must've found the store's showrooms and build-it-yourself furniture to be inspirational. 

The Gray Man whispered to me in my mother's voice, “Let me help you.”

It was a poor imitation. It had a strange edge to it, like a recording of my mom that had been played out of an old, tinny speaker. 

“Won't you let me?” The Gray Man asked, tilting its misshapen head. “Let me transform you? Give you a purpose?”

*What kind doesn't grow up dreaming to become a chair?* 

I rose slowly from the bed, hand on Ratcatcher's hilt. As I did so, its face lowered behind the wall, the slaps of its bare feet circling around to the entrance of the storeroom I'd picked to sit down in. It was going to try to box me in. 

Once its footsteps drew nearer, I slashed at it. As previously mentioned, we ordinarily try to resolve infestations non-lethally, but there are some pests out there that can't simply be caught and relocated. Gray Men are one of them. 

My first cut missed. Its laugh was a perversion of my mother's; there was no warmth in it, and it was far too slow, as if the Gray Man was trying out that particular form of vocalization for the first time and couldn't quite figure it out. 

I ducked under its arm as it reached for me with its long, needle-sharp fingers, then dragged the sword along the Gray Man’s side. Hearing Mom’s voice scream like that, even while knowing it wasn't her, made me tear up instantly. Ignoring the Gray Man’s manipulations, I struck again, cutting into the skin of its back. Black blood spilled onto the white tiles below our feet. 

After all that I’d encountered over the past few weeks, dealing the Gray Man felt much easier than it had in the past. While those sharp fingers are deadly, the pest is relatively slow compared to other Neighbors out there. It primarily relies on using fear or manipulation to capture its prey, not appearing to know how to handle itself against someone that is able to fight back. 

Right before I could finish it off, the Gray Man turned and scurried away, as much as a tall thing like it can scurry. It was quick, its fingers clicking noisily against the floor as it retreated. I gave chase, narrowly avoiding slipping in its blood at a few points. 

It wasn't hard to guess where it was going. 

I had lost sight of the pest itself, resorting to following the trail of blood to locate the stockroom. When I came across the sign pointing out the direction of the storeroom, I grimly wondered if the Gray Man had more ‘furniture’ that it hadn't set out yet. 

Preparing myself, I kept Ratcatcher ready as I slowly turned the corner that separated the selling floor from the storeroom, anticipating an ambush. 

The Gray Man wasn't in sight. Rows and rows of tall metal aisles lined the warehouse. Even though the aisles were kept tidy, it would have plenty of places to hide. 

Despite their great height, Gray Men have extremely flexible skeletons, which gives them the ability to wedge themselves into small spaces that yinz wouldn't expect them to be able to get into. During home infestations, children often report finding Gray Men hiding under their beds or in wardrobes. 

Like with most things we deal with at Orion, salt and iron do the trick. It's just a matter of finding the creepy fuckers first. 

The blood trail ended abruptly next to a pallet of packaged dresser parts. Eyes darting around, I listened for it. Iolo has pulled this move on me quite a few times: setting me up to think he's going to appear somewhere else, when really…

There was the slightest click of the Gray Man’s nails to my left. 

I ducked beneath its reach as it lunged for me, slamming into the pallet. It whirled around clumsily; its fingertips nicked my forearm as I stepped towards it to draw Ratcatcher’s blade across the gray skin of its throat.

With a gurgle, it fell to the ground, inky blood splashing onto the pallet of white bedspreads beside it. Its fingers twitched a few times, its eyes gazing at something only it could see. After some time, it stopped moving.

Admittedly, gathering up The Gray Man’s cadaver was even worse than fighting it. They're deceptively heavy, for how lanky they are. It took a long time of dragging and playing Tetris to get the body to fit in the company truck's bed. It would be burned later. 

After that debacle, I checked the entirety of the stockroom to make sure that it didn't have any more victims hidden in one of the stacks somewhere. Disgustingly enough, I discovered it had gotten a hold of some pigeons and made a wreath of them, sewing them in a tight ring from tail to breast, their eyes empty from being eaten away by fruit flies. 

As terrible as that was, at least it wasn't another person. 

On the bright side, after all was said and done, the furniture store paid us well beyond our normal grade and sent me a gift card. Can't complain about that. 

As far as the scratches go, they aren't bad, nothing that some band-aids and Neosporin won't take care of. Itchy as hell, though. Kind of like getting scratched by a cat. A big, ugly, nasty cat. 

That case occurred three days after I got discharged from the hospital. At that point, nobody at Orion had seen or heard anything from the Hunters. 

Back when I was admitted, I relayed all that had happened with the Cookie Hag to Deirdre while she perched on the edge of the hospital’s lumpy bed. She’d listened to all I had to say with solemn intensity. When I'd admitted that I stepped between the hag and Iolo, her mouth tightened and her brows furrowed. I couldn't tell if it was from disbelief, concern, or a mixture of the two. Or something else. 

Once I was done telling her everything that I told yinz in the last update, I waited for her to give me her thoughts. Her eyes darted down, and she swallowed, as if she were searching for words that she couldn't find. Eventually, she glanced around, making sure that there was nobody around to eavesdrop. We were alone. 

Those pensive eyes settled on me as she uttered, “I remember how I became a Weeper.”

Suspecting that her memory had something to do with what she wanted to tell me, I nodded for her to continue. 

“We were among the first Irish immigrants to the Americas. This was in the wake of much war and turmoil. Since my family couldn't afford to come to the New World on their own, we were to be indentured servants to one of the wealthier families. At the time, I was just a girl. But my mother… 

She paused, her voice cracking somewhat as she admitted. “I… can't recall her name. Or my father's.”

I saw her blink a bit, as if either holding back tears or in shock that she couldn't remember her own parents’ names. I reached for her hand. Upon reflection, this seems to be our default way of comforting each other. At least it works. A physical reminder that the other is not alone. 

She continued. “We were somewhere new, so the souls of the dead needed more guidance than ever. My mother was a keening woman, as was her mother before her and so on. I used to watch her as she sang and wept for the dead, as passionately as if they were from her own family, even if she didn't know the deceased well. I learned from her as best as I could. But there was one lesson that I had to learn the hard way.

“There was a butcher in my village that was soft spoken, but had a smile that did the talking for him. I did not know him well, but I knew that he was kind. He was known to help those of us that couldn't afford proper meat. He didn't let anyone go hungry. I was to keen for him after he’d succumbed to illness. And at the time, I was fully intending to carry out my duties. 

“But at the funeral, his wife and children surrounded him. His widow had gone entirely voiceless from crying. Meanwhile, the little ones were too young to understand, waiting for their father to wake up. And most importantly, I saw the butcher. His soul lingered, needing guidance. But before I could utter a syllable, he began to beg, ‘Please. Please don't take me from them.’”

*Jesus.* That would be hard. 

She put her head down, “I regret to say that I listened. To keep up pretenses, I sang a different song. One that didn't resonate with him. I was weak.”

I kindly argued, “Anyone with a heart would've hesitated.”  

Shame continued to weigh Deirdre down, “I didn't just hesitate, Nessa. If I had, I would've simply followed in my mother’s footsteps, but instead I *failed.* And worse yet, because I had failed, someone else had to do it for me.”

When she met my eyes again, her gaze was haunted. She let out a deep breath, “That ‘someone else’ was a rider of the Wild Hunt. When she came for the butcher, she made a point to do it when I was watching. She winked at me before she tore the poor man’s soul apart.”

Good to know that the Hunters have always been assholes. 

“The point of this story,” Deirdre concluded solemnly. “Is that a choice that may seem compassionate in the moment can cause more harm later.”

I wasn't sure how to feel about that. “I don't mean to put words in your mouth or anything like that, but do you think I should've let just… let him die like that?”

She flinched, “My word, it does sound that way, doesn't it? I merely meant that I worry about him taking advantage of your mercy.” 

Her eyes lowered once again, but not from shame. Was it guilt? 

Treading lightly, I told her, “I’d understand if you felt that way. If you wanted the mechanic to die, I mean.” She gave me a shocked look, but didn't deny what I’d said. “He tortured you, me, my coworkers, and God knows how many others.”

Once I was done, she stayed frozen in shock, her eyes wandering once again as if collecting herself. 

When she finally spoke again, it was barely above a whisper, “Would you think less of me if I admitted that I hate him?’

Naturally, that confused the hell out of me. “Why would I think less of you?”

“You don't have a hateful bone in your body, Nessa. Even if the being in question deserves it. I’m afraid I don't have that sort of mercy within me.”

Somehow, I’d accidentally managed to trick her into thinking I'm some sort of saint. Completely flabbergasted, I couldn't help myself from letting out a little chuckle. 

When she frowned, I assured her, “I don't mean to laugh, but I’ve hated plenty of people before, the mechanic included. And my father. My fourth grade teacher…”

Her frown lightened, evolving into relief, “I never would have guessed.”

“The trick is to bottle up your feelings until you're going to explode.” I joked like the mentally healthy person that I am. 

“Spoken like a true Irish woman.” Deirdre replied with a smirk. 

She sobered, confessing, “I don't recall ever hating someone before. At least, not like this. Even though the Huntsman is being punished, I still feel it isn't enough.”

That caught me off guard, “What do you mean?”

She didn't realize that I didn't know that losing a wing is debilitating for Neighbors like Iolo. 

From the way she explained it, the seeds Briar buried beneath his skin are essentially prosthetics that use their host's body plan to recreate the lost limbs. However, like with most things Neighbor-related, there is a catch. The seeds attach themselves to their host’s vascular system, so there is a chance that they can become parasitic if not taken care of properly. 

In other words, it's something only a crazy bastard like Iolo would be okay with risking. 

My response to this crucial information was absolutely brilliant: “You know so much.”

*Why is she with me again?*

Deirdre gave me a small smile, “When you're confined to a river for decades, you find ways to occupy your time. Learning was one of those ways. The wind and the trees have many stories to tell to those who are willing to listen.”

I then asked her something I was anxious to hear the answer to, “Are you angry with me? For stopping the witch from killing him?”

She pondered for a moment until she eventually shook her head, “No. Though, I must admit that there's a part of me that thinks it would've been easier. I know he would've just been replaced with someone else, possibly someone even worse, but at least it wouldn't have been *him.*”

It was a bit jarring to see her so visibly remorseful, as if she felt guilty for being so honest with how she felt. 

“The choice I made affects you, too,” I assured her. “If you think I made the wrong decision, that's alright. I won't be upset, especially since the mechanic will definitely find some way to make me regret helping him.”

She gave me a thoughtful look, “Not necessarily. Because of what you did, you have some leverage over him. You can negotiate your freedom.”

“I want you there for that.” I said quickly. “You seem to be better at negotiating than I am.”

It's definitely going to piss him off, but I'm willing to risk it if Deirdre is. 

She squeezed my hand tighter in response, agreeing to it without any hesitation. 

Once I got discharged, she and I determined that it would be best to speak to him sooner rather than later. With Samhain just around the corner, it would be helpful to know where I stood. 

Admittedly, there was also a stupidly optimistic part of me that hoped that what happened with the Cookie Hag would change things. Not just for me, but for Orion’s relations with the Wild Hunt. I am not delusional enough to think that all bad blood would be cleared up between our organizations overnight, but I was hoping that, at the very least, we could learn to coexist with one another. 

However, when I passed by his shop, his truck wasn't there. There was a handwritten note taped in the window reading, ‘Temporarily closed. Hoping to be back Friday. If urgent, call (814) XXX-XXXX. Sorry for the inconvenience! :(”

Noting that it was a different number than the one Orion used for our company truck’s repairs, I put the number in my phone, got back into the Jeep, then made the call. It went straight to voicemail. Strange. 

My next stop was the skull tree clearing. I’d expected to find him strumming at his banjo with that damned smirk on his face, but the site was deserted. The fire pit hadn't been used in days; the ashes were soaked from the morning rain. No sign of him. 

After a few more failed attempts to get ahold of him properly over the course of that day and the next, I decided to take a more direct approach. He may have been recovering from a life-altering injury, but I've always had to be at his beck and call no matter what state I was in. Maybe that's petty of me, but after all that that Huntsman has put me through, I think I deserve to be a little petty. As a treat. 

That being said, if I was going to attempt to draw the banjo bastard to me, I was going to do it nicely. No sense in angering him before trying to argue for my freedom. 

Before heading over to the Lovers' Tree, I picked up another jar of fresh cream as well as a bottle of cognac in the hopes that providing an offering would inspire him to speak to us. And ideally, the cognac would put him in a decent mood. 

As I approached the tree, I saw that a murder of crows was gathered in the hawthorn’s uppermost branches, watching me with their beady little eyes. They whispered to each other. Their shadows circled the tree as if the birds were aloft, independent of their owners. 

I held the offerings up to them, “I have a gift for the captain of the Wild Hunt. The Dragonfly.”

One of the birds took flight, catching up to its silhouette on the grass. The others merely watched as I set the offering down by the tree trunk, trying to keep the cognac somewhat hidden in case some idiot got the idea to swipe it. 

On that note, I shouldn't have to say this, but don't *ever* steal a Neighbor's offerings. Even the gentlest of them don't take kindly to thieves. 

Afterwards, I simply went home to wait and see if the mechanic would grace Deirdre and I with his presence. 

A few hours later, there was a knock at the door. Anxiously, I sprung up to answer it, only to find that it wasn't Iolo on the other side of it. 

The Huntress’ burns had disappeared completely, leaving no trace of the disfiguring injuries she'd sustained less than a week ago. Even her Cool Mom haircut was back to the way it was before. One of her red-eared hounds sat at her feet, tail wagging as it panted excitedly. 

“I know that I'm not the one you expected to see,” The Huntress said when she saw my expression. “I’m afraid that the captain is incapacitated. As such, I have been asked to temporarily take over your training.”

I heard Deirdre rise from the couch, coming to stand by my side just as I asked, “Incapacitated?” 

The Huntress paused, her eyes roving over the Weeper before replying, “I’m not at liberty to give any more details than that.”

During our discussion in the hospital, Deirdre had mentioned that the seeds, like any other transplant, can be rejected by a Neighbor's body. I wondered if that was what was happening to him, or if there was some other complication he could be experiencing. Deirdre and I exchanged a glance. She appeared to be thinking the same thing I was. 

The Huntress interrupted our pseudo-telepathic conversation, “We should go.”

With that, I grabbed Ratcatcher, gave Deirdre a quick kiss on the cheek goodbye, then flounced out the door. The dog trotted in front of us as the Huntress guided me to her van. 

Over the sound of my seatbelt clicking and the van’s engine grumbling to life, the Huntress told me, “He did appreciate the cognac, by the way. It was a nice choice.”

“I wouldn't know.” I replied. “I just thought the bottle looked pretty.”

That got a small snort out of her. The closest I'd ever come to seeing the Huntress laugh. 

After a bout of heavy silence, I tried to see if I could get anything else out of her, “If you can't say, I understand, but there is a matter I’d like to discuss with your superior as soon as possible. How severe is his incapacitation?”

She didn't answer immediately, probably pondering how much she could give away without getting in trouble, “There were some complications, but nothing we can't handle. He should be fine in a few days.”

“What kind of complications?” 

“You ask a lot of questions.” She commented instead of answering. 

“Just trying to make conversation.” I replied, knowing better than to push any harder. 

“Hm.” Was her only response. 

The rest of the car ride was uncomfortably quiet, save for the dog’s ears flapping as it held its head out the open window. 

Once we arrived at the skull trees, she retrieved the same wooden sword Iolo used from the back of her van, then tensed up. Her voice suddenly taking on a harsh tone, she commanded the hound in Gaelic. It swiftly trotted off, leaving us alone. As it disappeared into the trees, I could hear it baying in the distance. 

Like the mechanic, the Huntress offered me a four-leaf clover before we began.

Something that I noted was that when she was in her hoofed form, she was about my height, not including the antlers. That meant that her reach should be about the same. 

Right off the bat, it was completely different sparring with her than it was my usual partner. Where Iolo was fast, seeking to overwhelm and disorient me, she was more direct. She used her antlers as secondary weapons, when able to. There were a few times I was worried about getting gored. Her hits also felt a bit harder than his, if yinz could believe it. 

Another difference between them was their training methods. Any time I made a mistake, she would stop the session to point it out, then explain to me what I should have done differently. Because of that, it felt like our session took much longer. But on the bright side, I didn't feel quite as bruised and battered as I did when dealing with her boss. 

She even let me take a break. That confused me greatly. Breaks? We could take *breaks?*

When the Huntress saw my reaction, another barely-there chuckle escaped from between her canine fangs, “I suppose the captain gives you the ‘tough love’ approach?”

“‘Love’ isn't the word I'd use, but sure.” I joked. “I’d say ‘throwing me out of the frying pan and into the fire’ is a better way to put it.”

She scraped a hoof along the ground thoughtfully, “That's how most of them learned in the old days. The reasoning for that was that an opponent wouldn't take the time to school you, so why should your instructor?”

“And here I was thinking that the mechanic just really enjoys smacking me around.”

She shrugged, “Two things can be true at once.”

That sounded suspiciously like a joke. Given how no-nonsense she appears to be, I didn't think the Huntress was capable of that. Of course, she is the Hunter I know the least about. 

She then straightened up, her tone becoming serious once again. “There is some information I can share with you in regards to the upcoming Hunt on All Hallow's Eve, but it comes at great risk to myself. Great enough of a risk to equal the debt that I acquired to you during the altercation with the hag. I also firmly believe that this information could be used to save not only your life, but potentially the lives of those you care about. If I share it with you, that would make us even. Do you accept?”

That was completely unexpected. So much so that it took me a moment to realize what she was offering me. This was something that we needed, provided that the Huntress wasn't going to try to screw me over like how a certain someone would. But she couldn't lie. I at least could be assured of that much. 

“Am I able to ask questions as well?” I inquired, testing the waters. 

She nodded once. “I figured as much. Yes, that is perfectly fine.”

“Okay, then I accept.”

Some might say that I wasted the opportunity to have a member of the Wild Hunt indebted to me. But when it comes to Samhain, I felt like I was flying blind, and flying blind into a storm, at that. Between the Dullahan and Gwyn ap Nudd, we were going to need all the help we could get. 

“The hosts of the Hunt are responsible for finding an appropriate quarry worthy of the White Son of Mist.” She informed me. “Before you, it was to be the Leader of Orion. However, given recent events, it's possible that could change, but, that'll depend on the results of your discussion with the captain.”

I was about to say something, but the Huntress continued, “In the chance that it doesn't change, just know that if you or one of your colleagues sees crows during the day or hear the howls of hounds, that means that one of you will be hunted when the sun sets. The Hunt will end when the sun rises once again, or once we’ve found the one we're looking for.”

Before she could keep blazing through, I dared to ask, “What happens to the person who gets caught? Do they just die?”

“That's at the White Son of Mist’s discretion,” She replied ominously. “If he’s satisfied, then the quarry may be granted a quick death. However, if the quarry ends up disappointing him, he or other Hunters may take measures to make things more interesting.”

A cold feeling settled in my stomach as it occurred to me that that was probably why Victor and other Orion employees were suggested as the Hunt’s target. Iolo knew we'd fight back better than most people. 

Suppressing a chill, I made the mistake of asking, “What kind of measures?”

The Huntress was way to calm as she answered, “One year, the quarry's eyes were sewn shut with the idea that it'd be humorous to watch them try to run while blinded. Another year, the quarry was forced to swallow gasoline, then burned alive.”

Jesus. I shouldn't have asked. 

Unfortunately, she continued, “There's also the chance that a captured soul may join our ranks, depending on the King’s whims, but I’m sure you suspected that already.”

That's what this training was all about, wasn't it? Making me a tool of the Hunt. No surprise there, either. 

Taking a deep breath, I nodded, “Yeah, I kind of figured that one.”

“Do you have any other questions?” She inquired patiently. “Or can we call this transaction complete?”

“I do have another,” I said quickly. “Is it possible to elude the Hunt?”

“Hypothetically.” She replied after a moment of consideration. “I've never seen or heard of it happening, but I suppose it's possible.”

Iolo had never had trouble finding me. The few times I've ever tried to run from him, it proved to be horrendously futile. And that was just *one* Huntsman. I didn't want to imagine how much worse it could be with an entire hunting party led by Gwyn ap Nudd himself. An entire army of Iolos. Now *that* is a hellish thought. 

“Are there any precautions you can recommend, or is that asking for too much?” Was my next question. “Besides the usual bonfire and costumes, of course.”

I plan to get into what precautions Orion takes when it comes to Samhain closer to time. We have more research that we're doing to ensure that we're following the traditions to a T, so I want to wait until that's been taken care of before sharing it online. 

The Huntress deliberated once again, “Nothing that you don't already know.”

After that, I didn't have any more questions. With that, I agreed that we were even with one another. Once that was over with, it was back to getting my ass very politely being handed to me in sword training. 

I don't know what to make of the Huntress. On the surface, she seems more straightforward than her boss does. But I don't trust it. There's always an ulterior motive with them. It's safe to assume that she's no different. However, knowing that she can't lie leads me to believe that the information she offered was truthful to the best of her knowledge. I’ll still be taking everything with a massive grain of salt.

I may not know where I stand with Iolo, but at least now, we have a Hunter’s account on what to look out for. That's more than what we had before. 

Now, if yinz will excuse me, I have to go get a Halloween [costume ](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/s/kvnRWF2wFv).
