I work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building I found a book detailing another expedition to Igloolic. After reading it I found this story particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.

Me and Hugo stood on the deck talking, like we did every day. We had so many stories to swap, so many memories to impart.

 He seemed young like I did, his new body bearing a striking similarity to his first.

 We had reached the mouth of the bay of Fundy today and it was only mid June. We had planned to wait longer for the ice to melt, but had been too anxious to stay in Louisiana any longer. We had picked up an ice breaker on our way past Europe for just in case protection.

As we started to sail along the coast adjacent to Baffin island Hugo spoke.

"You know we die right? We get her but we die." Hugo said

"I had thought so, but I wasn't sure." I responded. "You were in suspended animation most of the time weren't you? How much did Yahweh tell you?"

He smiled brightly. "We both go straight to heaven when we die. After we die they will say pity not the dead, but envy them, for they are saved!" He stopped then said with a wink. "So when you get to heaven are you going to apply?"

I snickered. "Of course."

We watched the trees get smaller and smaller and then disappear from the deck of the ship.

We  stared off at the horizon, looking at the alien landscape. Things are just different this far north. 

before long the water was turning to ice. I recognized a landmark, we were unfortunately farther south  than when we had disembarked last time.

The sun never really went down this time of year this far north and it saddened Hugo that we couldn't move under the cover of darkness.

We anchored the ships and set out on horseback. We left 15 inquisitors to guard the ships, so we numbered at 135, the largest force we had gathered since Salem.

We journeyed for only a few hours when we saw some children dressed in green suits in a sleigh being pulled by reindeer. We expected them to run away but they came right towards us.

"Howdy partner, you sure are some strange folk. In these parts we don't usually see people that seem so... Mediterranean. I tell you it gets awfully cold in these parts during the winter and y'all are likely to freeze or starve if you don't take your caravan and turn around right now!" The child threatened.

Hugo laughed and strolled up to the sleigh grabbing the child by the neck. He looked to the other and said "You better start talking, you can only live a few minutes without air."

The other frantically started talking "We're the white witches elves, we're making bombs. Our mother the white witch says she'll feed us to land octopi if we don't make them."

Hugo dropped the supposed elf and he fell to the ground coughing.

"The witch is plotting to send us all to the promised land! She knows a way to save us all!" The supposed elf hollered.

"What sorcery is this?" Hugo responded "The only thing we need to be saved from is Samael, and the white witch herself! How does she intend to send us to this promised land?"

The elf stood up and replied jollily "With the deplorable word of course! Through the power of the white witch we may all be saved! Even you strangers from these supposed southern lands. "

Hugo's face went red. He then screamed at the child "And this pleases you? Terrible wretch you are a slave to your mother." Hugo then headbutted him, knocking him out. I clubbed the other with the blunt of my sword knocking him out as well.

"I think its time for a deep insurgency mission" Hugo pronounced. 

He then started changing into the supposed elves clothing and I followed suit. Before I knew it we were riding their sleigh back to the palace. 

The first thing we noticed was that there was another giant. I had hoped I had gotten them all but there was at least one by the door, wearing a polar bear coat. He was small for one of these giants, only maybe 13 feet tall. He guarded the door as another group of supposed elves entered the large double doors.

"We shall find their stash of bombs and detonate them all at once" Hugo whispered. "Try and make your voice high pitched"

"Alright we will sound like the supposed elves..." We looked at each other and giggled as high pitched as we could.

The giant looked at us, he seemed to be a sad lame giant with poor eyesight.

He hobbled towards the cart, looking at us briefly, before opening the door. 

We rode in and were astounded by what we saw. Over 100 supposed elves were working, cramming black powder into shrapnel dishes and then sticking fuses in.

"Why we can blow half the palace up with all these bombs." Hugo whispered. 

"Now Blanco!" I commanded.

Blanko flew out from under my green hat and peppered a bomb with flaming goo. The bomb exploded in chain reaction with several others creating a large explosion, knocking me and Hugo off the sleigh. 

We got up quickly and he said angrily "We need need to get out of here BEFORE we blow the place up. Have you never seen a bomb before?" 

The supposed elves were thankfully looking at the floating book, levitating in the middle of the room and not us. My old rogue skills came back to me and a crept in to the shadows. Hugo chose to hide in plain sight, still a supposed elf himself.

I quickly located a large stash of bombs and set about making a makeshift fuse. I found a long string of fuse that was to be cut into many pieces. WAS. 

I cut it off at about the 8 foot mark then went back to bomb stash. Once the fuse was placed I called Grimoire Blanco.

"Get over here and light this fuse!" 

He came flying, all the supposed elves watching, and when he lit the fuse they all ran for the door screaming.

Me and Hugo, not wanting to blown up ourselves, went running to the door in tandem.

When we got outside we were greeted by a thick, murky fog.

We paused momentarily before breaking into a sprint running for a few moments before the bombs went off.

The explosion was massive and I felt the air suck in before the shock wave hit, knocking me forward. 

I quickly got back to my feet. I looked back, wishing I could see the palace in the thick fog as chunks of ice started to rain around me. The pieces verified wild in sizes, one boulder sized one just missed me.

After that I heard screaming and snarling. I listened to what sounded like Lions, and then something came through the fog.

It was a large, black, fury wasp with the face and legs of a polar bear. IT was as big as a large polar bear as well. It's bug eyes looked strange against white fur.

It charged forward swiping at me with its claws. With my catlike reflexes I lopped off its leg and jumped back at an angle. The wasp lost focus and circled it cutting off its wing, then another of its legs. 

It turned to me and snarled, I lunged forward stabbing it though the eye. I pulled and and backed away as it fell over lifelessly.

I heard screams from the direction of the castle and realized witch way to run. I was out of the fog within minutes. I looked back at the palace that was half covered in fog. What an eerie haunting site.

Soon Hugo came out of the fog and we headed back to the main force of inquisitors.

Right before we arrived we started to hear the buzzing. I turned to see a squadron of manticore wasps coming our way. There were two dozen of them, flying in a v.

"Take formation" Hugo screamed as the men started to form a phalanx. The wasps crashed into the groups of slower inquisitors, stinging them, biting and swatting them.

Hugo let out a scream of rage and charged at one from the side, lopping its head off in one slash.

Another charged at him and he stabbed it through the eye, killing it. His sword snapped as he pulled it out and another came towards him. He let out a war cry.

"WAAAAAAH" and charged forward, grabbing the wasp and putting it in a headlock. He wrestled it to the ground and snapped its neck.

while this happened Grimoire Blanco coated a manticore wasp in fiery goo, and was then swatted to the ground, he lay there lifelessly.

Grimoire Negro froze a wasp manticore solid, and was then also swatted to the ground.

While this happened I circled around a manticore wasp. It circled too and we danced in a circle. IT eventually lost its footing and I lunged forward, cutting off an arm and a leg, then a wing. 

Its lost its focus and hysterically buzzed as I danced to the next manticore wasp. It was dueling someone else as I stepped in cutting off a wing and then a leg.

I danced to the next  circling pair cutting off a wing and then two legs.

I danced through the battlefield ans Hugo charged through, an unstoppable force of nature.

With minutes all the wasps were dead. We had lost nearly 80 inquisitors, down to 55. 

We then saw a sleigh with the White witch and Dora, being pulled by reindeer.

"You have no idea what you let out! Fool!" The white witch cackled.

I felt a chill down my spin and looked to the castle. There was something looking back at me from the fog. Something terrifying.

"You might want to activate your halo" I heard Yahweh's voice in my head.

I activated it as most of the remaining inquisitors closed there eyes and fell to their knees.

The 10 standing inquisitors turned to stone immediately as the land octopi came out of the mist.

They had eyes as big as dinner plates that glowed blue, and huge mouths full of saber like teeth. The heads were surrounded by a whirling mass of tentacles. Each tentacle had a sharp beak on the end of it. The blue mass of tentacles moved forward on dozes of tiny tentacles, acting as makeshift legs.

I heard a voice in my head speak to me. "I eat human minds as well as bodies.. Your troupe will satisfy me for weeks should the only two of you even capable of fighting us die. Face us now in single combat. You think your old? I lived on the ocean floor for 1200 years before your evil witch mother captured me and used me as a garbage disposal. Make no mistake, she is on the menu after you, should you fail." 

I charged towards the smaller of the land octopi and when I got close I started moving in circle. The land octopus started moving in a circle as well, faster than you might think. I moved towards it with Damascus steel sword in each hand. Multiple tentacles came at me at once, sharp breaks drawn. I danced forwards cutting off the tentacles as they came at me at total random.

We moved forwards and back as I cut off tentacle after tentacle.

Hugo did something similar but moved so close that the land octopus tried to bite him. He quickly jumped into its mouth purposefully. It shrieked as he cut it apart from the inside.

Me and the land octopus danced in a circle, as I cut off tentacle after tentacle.

Hugo burst out of the other land octopus and it fell in a heap. 

He charged right at the one I danced with and phased into it while we circled each other.

I moved back as he cut it apart from the inside, then came out.

He looked at me triumphantly, then his face went to tears.

"What?" I asked.

"You have a cut on your face. The land octopus has venom that will paralyze you within minutes. You'll be dead shortly after that." He said solemnly, then came in and hugged me.

Before I knew it I fell to the ground paralyzed. I saw a view of what was happening though.

Inquisitors were chasing after the white witch who was riding around on her sleigh with Dora.

I wish I could have laughed as I saw a polar bear sized wasp made of stone.

Hugo mounted his horse and tried his best to pursue the white witch, but here reindeer were more well equipped for the terrain and she ran circles around the cackling.

"I've almost figured out the deplorable word you are all doomed!" she cackled.

I then saw into the spirit world. Samael sat by a pile of book and said to me "You'll live long enough to die by the deplorable word with Hugo, fool. We've almost figured it out." He laughed.

I then heard a deep infinite cackle as a smoldering dragon head floated towards the white witch. 

"Only I can tell someone the deplorable word!" Nibiru cackled. "And you think I would tell it you, you worthless hag? This is as powerful as you have ever been, and as powerful as you will ever be. The only reason I spare you for death now Samael is so that you may doom this worthless race of traitors in the future. I will leave nothing of this civilization and I will have you doom it for the karma. I have chosen you, Samael!"

Samael then erupted with wasp larvae. Some chewed and others ripped off all of his twelve wings.

"And you witches! You think your gods or something, prometheusing one of my favorite tools! I am your god now!"

Both the white witch and Dora burst into jelly. They then quickly regenerated, and then were hit by lightning. They then regenerated and burst into flames.

There was a bunch but the last I'll mention is that were eaten by wasp larvae like so many others.

Nibiru chased them around, killing them over and over in bizarre horrible ways.

He then came to me.

"Last time I spared you and you chose not to worship me, you never gave me the recognition I deserved or I would spare you this time as well!"

'What will you do this time?' I thought?

"This time nothing lives!" he cackled.

Then the wind blew like a hurricane and It started to hail balls of ice the size of basket balls.

The vortex intensified to the point where the waves were 100s of feet tall.

I and everything else within 100 miles died.

Before I went to heaven I went to a monk in that monastery in Louisiana and told him my story, so he could record this here so that my contemporaries and future generations may have a true account of what happened on the Spanish Inquisitions second expedition to Iglooic.
