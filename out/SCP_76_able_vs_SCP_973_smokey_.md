 I’ve tried to forget that night. God knows I’ve tried. But it claws its way back into my mind every time I close my eyes. I don’t want to write this. I don’t want to relive it. But some stories don’t die just because you want them to.

That night wasn’t just a horror show—it was the moment I became someone else. A man who stared into the jaws of death, felt the weight of terror crush his lungs, and came out of it alive. Stronger, maybe. Or maybe just hollowed out and filled with something darker.

I was a D-Class. If you know what that is, you know exactly how little my life was worth to the people running the show. If you don’t, well, let me give you the short version: I was expendable. A nobody thrown into the meat grinder of an organization I only knew as “the Foundation.” They deal with things that shouldn’t exist. Things you’d think were nightmares if you ever had the misfortune of seeing them.

That’s all I knew when they plucked me from my cell that morning. No explanation, no choice. Just a “Get up, you’re needed.”

They didn’t tell me where I was going or why, but I could see it in their eyes—this wasn’t routine. The guards who marched me through the sterile, humming corridors of whatever facility we were in were quieter than usual. Grim. I heard one of them mutter, “Why are we even trying this? It’s a suicide mission.”

I didn’t ask questions. D-Class don’t ask questions if they want to stay breathing. But my gut churned with the kind of dread that doesn’t come from just being scared—it comes from knowing you’re a pawn in a game you can’t understand.

As we walked, I caught glimpses of preparation. Equipment being loaded. Men in tactical gear checking weapons. And then there was him.

The first time I saw Able, I didn’t think he was human. He was too big—eight feet tall and built like a statue of a war god, every muscle carved to perfection. His skin was olive-toned, and his body was covered in tattoos—grotesque scarlet faces that seemed to sneer and scream as he moved. His face was cold, devoid of anything remotely human.
He didn’t look at me as I passed. Didn’t look at anyone. He just stood there, motionless, like a weapon waiting to be unleashed. I wanted to believe he was on our side, but something about him screamed predator. The kind that doesn’t differentiate between friend and foe—just prey.

As we walked past, I felt his eyes flick to me for the briefest second. A chill rolled down my spine. It wasn’t the kind of look you get from another human being; it was like a wolf watching a rabbit. Something primal, dangerous, and indifferent.

I didn’t know who—or what—he was. I didn’t want to know.

The guard leading me grunted and shoved me forward when I hesitated. “Keep moving.” His voice had an edge to it, a mix of frustration and fear. It was subtle, but I heard it. That fear. That unspoken truth that whatever they were planning tonight, nobody in the room thought it would work.

As I was led out, a technician muttered, ‘No one survives the third mile.’ His colleague shushed him, but I caught the words—and the look of dread on his face. Third mile? What did that mean?

They shoved me into a briefing room, a sterile box with buzzing fluorescents and a single table covered in documents and maps I wasn’t allowed to look at. A man in a lab coat was waiting, his eyes sunken and his face pale like he hadn’t slept in days. He looked at me like I was already a ghost.

“Do you know why you’re here?” he asked, his voice tight.

“No,” I said. My voice cracked.

He didn’t explain. He just slid a set of keys across the table.

“You’ll be driving a car. You’ll have a passenger. Follow the road, stick to the speed we tell you, and don’t stop until you’re told to.”

“That’s it?”

“That’s it,” he said flatly. He didn’t bother hiding the lie in his voice.

I didn’t press. You don’t ask questions when you’re a D-Class. You do what you’re told, or you disappear.

As the guards led me out of the room, I caught snatches of conversation from the people huddled over maps and screens. “Route 973,” someone said, their voice low. “If we fail again—”
Another voice cut in. “We won’t. Able’s here this time.”

Able. The predator. The eight-foot nightmare. My “passenger.”

I didn’t know what they were trying to do. I didn’t know what Route 973 was. But I knew one thing for sure: the guards didn’t believe I was coming back.

Neither did I.

As the guard shoved me forward, I caught sight of a monitor displaying the route. Numbers scrawled in red danced across the screen—coordinates? Warnings? And in the corner, faint text read: Route 973 Incident Log: 28 Fatalities Confirmed.


They led me to a black car parked in an underground garage. The lights were dim, casting long shadows across the rows of vehicles. My car looked ordinary—clean, polished, nondescript. But there was something about it that made my chest tighten, like the air around it was heavier.

Able was already inside.

He sat in the passenger seat, perfectly still, his massive frame making the car feel small. Up close, he was even more terrifying. His tattoos seemed to shift under the dim light, the faces contorted into silent screams. His eyes—cold and dark—were locked straight ahead. He didn’t acknowledge me as I slid into the driver’s seat.

The silence in the car was suffocating. I gripped the steering wheel, my palms slick with sweat.

“Drive,” he said.

His voice was deep, commanding, and completely devoid of emotion.

I turned the key in the ignition, the engine roared to life, but the dashboard flickered for a second, like something unseen was meddling with the car’s electrical system. A faint static hissed through the radio, though it was off, forming patterns of whispers too soft to understand.”

  That’s when I realized I’d just become part of something I couldn’t escape. Something worse than death.

I forced my foot onto the gas pedal, the car lurching forward with a low growl. The hum of the engine was the only sound in the silence between me and Able. The road twisted and turned ahead, lined with trees that seemed to reach out like skeletal hands, their branches clawing at the sky.

Every mile felt longer than the last. The lines on the road blurred together, creating a hypnotic, unending pattern. My hands gripped the steering wheel tighter, knuckles white, my breath coming faster than it should. The darkness outside felt suffocating, like it was closing in on me with each passing second. I could feel my chest tighten, my heart racing in my ribcage, but there was nowhere to go, nothing I could do. I was trapped.

Fear and anxiety curled inside me like a twisted knot, squeezing tighter with every turn. I wanted to scream, to shout at the night, but I couldn’t. I was just a passenger in this nightmare, powerless to stop it. The weight of everything—the boy, the robbery, the trial, the verdict—pressed down on me, and I felt dizzy. My mind flickered back to that moment, the kid's blood on my hands, his face forever burned into my memory.

I could feel the sweat building up on my brow, my palms clammy against the wheel. The road seemed to stretch on forever, the headlights doing little to pierce the darkness that wrapped itself around the car. My pulse quickened, the dizziness growing as I tried to focus, tried to ignore the weight in my chest.

I swallowed hard, trying to shake off the fog in my head, but it wouldn’t lift. It felt like I was suffocating, but I couldn’t stop. The road stretched on, endless, like everything I had done, chasing me down, pulling me deeper into whatever came next.

The road blurred in front of me, the lines blending together in a hypnotic dance. My hands gripped the wheel tighter, but my mind drifted to the night everything changed.

It was supposed to be a simple job. A robbery. Get in, get out. But things went south the second I stepped through that door. The clerk—a kid no older than nineteen—looked terrified. I remember yelling at him to open the register. He fumbled with the keys, his hands shaking.

And then I heard it.

The siren.

Panic hit me like a freight train. My finger slipped on the trigger. One shot. That’s all it took.

I didn’t even mean to pull it. I swear I didn’t. But the kid crumpled like a puppet with its strings cut, blood pooling around him faster than I could process. I froze, staring at what I’d done. My chest felt like it was caving in, but the sound of tires screeching outside snapped me back.

The next thing I knew, the cops were on me, screaming orders I couldn’t hear over the ringing in my ears. I barely remember being shoved into the back of a squad car, my hands cuffed and shaking.

But I remember the trial. God, do I remember the trial.

The courtroom was packed—journalists, strangers, even people I thought were friends. They looked at me like I was a monster. Like the kid’s blood was still on my hands. And maybe it was.

My family was there too. My mother wouldn’t even meet my eyes. My father…he just sat there, stone-faced, as if he’d disowned me already. And my sister? She cried the entire time. Not for me. For the boy I’d killed.

The prosecutor didn’t pull any punches. “Premeditated,” they said. “Cold-blooded.” They paraded the boy’s parents in front of the jury. His mother sobbed so hard she couldn’t even speak. His father just stared at me, silent, with hatred so sharp it felt like it could cut through steel.

When the verdict came, it wasn’t a surprise. Guilty. The judge didn’t hesitate either. Life without parole. My world ended with the bang of a gavel.

But it didn’t end there.

The night before they transferred me to the prison that would be my new home, two men in black suits showed up in my cell. They didn’t look like cops. They didn’t even look like people. They were too clean, too cold, like mannequins brought to life.

“We have a proposal,” one of them said.

I didn’t even respond. What was the point?

The other one leaned in, his voice low and sharp. “We can spare you from what’s waiting for you in there. But the alternative…you might wish we hadn’t.”

They didn’t wait for me to answer. They didn’t need to. A signature on a paper I didn’t read, a nod from a warden who didn’t care, and I was theirs.

No trial. No appeals. No chance to say goodbye.

I thought prison would be hell. I thought dying on a noose would be the worst way to go. But then I met the Foundation.

And I learned there are things far worse than hell.

Then, his voice cut through the air like a blade.

“You can never escape it,” Able said, his tone flat but laced with a certainty that made my chest tighten. “The crime you committed. The boy you ended. You did it intentionally.”

My hands froze on the wheel, the weight of his words crashing down on me. I didn’t dare turn to look at him, but I felt his gaze, cold and piercing, like he was peeling back every layer of my mind.

“You’re no man,” he continued. “Just a scared little coward trying to pretend you are. Maybe after I end that monster, you’ll be next on the list.”

My breath hitched. My throat felt dry as sandpaper. How did he know? I hadn’t said a word. Was he reading my mind? Or was he just that good at seeing through people?

For a moment, the car felt smaller, like the walls were closing in. My pulse pounded in my ears as I gripped the wheel tighter, trying to steady my hands.

Then he leaned back, his voice quiet but sharp as a knife. “Drive.”

I blinked, snapping back to the present. The road stretched endlessly ahead, shadows twisting under the dim moonlight. A cold sweat clung to my back as I glanced at Able from the corner of my eye. He sat there, still and unyielding, his face a mask of indifference.

But his words echoed in my head, carving themselves into my mind.

And yet, a strange calm washed over me. He was right. I’d done it. I’d pulled the trigger. I’d ended that boy, no matter how much I wanted to deny it. I couldn’t run from it, couldn’t escape it. Maybe I deserved whatever fate Able thought I had coming.

I swallowed hard and fixed my eyes on the road.

Acceptance. That’s all I had left.

Then I saw him. The boy. Standing in the middle of the road, staring at me with wide, unblinking eyes. Blood dripped from his chest, pooling around his bare feet. My hands froze on the wheel, and the car swerved before I realized—there was nothing there. Just the road, empty and endless

As I was driving, we heard it before we saw it—the crackling of a broken radio, distant static, and then a low, gravelly voice.

“You better run,” it warned.

I glanced in the rearview mirror, and there it was—red and blue lights flashing behind us.
