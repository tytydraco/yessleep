I lay on the cold bare ground: a ground so cold you'd call it dead - but life flows from within like worms from a corpse.

My story is no different than any other death, except in every way. But, really, who am I to judge?

I have no name. I was a little boy when it happened - a boy so young and fair and full of, what they call it, life, and I thought I was invincible. I had a mother, and a father. Mother was sweet and blissful like pearls in a sack and her skin met neatly and arms stretched as clear and high as the very sky. Father was old in all ways and his eyes were right on top of his head, however I could never look at one without seeing the other. The Mother and the Father made me - I don't know how, but I appeared although I had always been before them. However, I let them believe they came before. 

I knew my fate clearly, but I didn't know what it meant. I just knew I wasn't meant for the life above. I didn't feel the sun the same way Mother and Father did. And I was kind to them - but they didn't deserve it.

When I died I was years of age. I was, you know, I was sat on the yellow grass and playing with stones. And I felt them rummaging through my bones. Bone and stone, two sisters in denial of their absurd resemblance. Bone has its marrow. Stone has its tremendous diamond guts, disgustingly barren and cold. I broke a piece in half, or had it been my bone? Had it been, I had felt no pain. I looked up at the sky and then back down and, as I saw my Mother through the window baking, I thought, that's it. Right now I feel the wind through my clothes and the smell of flour and sweat and the coldness of the earth and I taste the saltiness of my own blood. What more is there? I have hollowed all my senses and I shall leave.

And so I laid my head down and died. I was about five. Mother never cried.

After I died, everything changed. I was suddenly no more - and that is a hard thing to come to terms with, even for a five year old. I walked through this cave, and through a warm stone wall. At the end, I saw God.

'How is it?'

'How is what?'

'Death.'

'What is that, death?'

God didn't look in any way. I cannot describe Him. But I just knew I had seen Him.

'Death is what you have been through. The transition from life to higher. You, ceasing to be.'

'I died.'

'You did. You are the first mortal to ever die.'

The words had a deeper echo through me. 'I understand. And will there be others? Can I come back?'

God fell in deep thought and answered late. 'You shall. Since you are the first, the wait will be long. Your parents will have more children, and the Earth will be soon full. You can return, but only once. Until then, you are here to guide.'

'Guide who?'

'The others who will suffer your fate. You must walk them through. You must take them. You will be their death.'

Suddenly, I understood. I was never meant to live. The five years I had spent on Earth had been filled with confusion. I was meant to be the first to die. I had to lead the way. To help the others transition. I had a mission, a purpose.

'I understand. And where will I lead them?'

'To Me. To the end of the world. You will be among them every moment, everywhere. You will carry them Outside. And, when I say so, you will finally come back on Earth, at the End of all ends.'

'But when does Death get to roam the earth?'

'You shall see. Until then, be patient. And when the time comes, you will finally get to live.'

Since then, it has been eons. My mission has been heavy, but rewarding. However, I feel the End is near. 

Today, I finally woke up. I posted this message as a warning. The mortal who is writing this has been feeble enough to dream me, and I have answered. I shall send my message through him.

I will finally be free from the heavy burden, and no soul shall know how to find God without me. I will roam the Earth as I please and take whoever I want. The sea will know no sun and the moon shall turn its face from us. The apocalypse is coming - until then, enjoy what is left. Don't ask for a purpose.

I was the first mortal to die, and I shall be the first to return.
