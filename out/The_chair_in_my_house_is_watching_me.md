 When my uncle died, I didn’t expect anything to come of it. He didn’t have children, and he’d cut himself off from the family years ago. We heard of him in scraps, a letter at Christmas, a phone call if someone was in a hospital bed. The last time I saw him, I was maybe eleven. He gave me a chocolate bar once and said, ‘Stay out of the corners.’ I thought it was just one of those weird adult things kids don’t understand. So when the lawyer called and said the house was mine, I laughed, it felt like a joke.

I thought it was some kind of scam. But the papers were real. The keys were real. And soon enough, I was hauling my life into a place that had been in my family for three generations.

It wasn’t a bad house. Old, but solid. Two floors, a basement that smelled of dirt, and a living room that looked like something from another decade. My uncle had left almost everything behind, the furniture, the rugs, even some clothes in the drawers. It was like he’d stepped out one afternoon and never came back. Most of it was ordinary. But the chair… It sat in the living room, facing the fireplace. Red fabric, faded almost to brown where the light hit. The back was too tall, the arms too narrow; the seat had a permanent dip, as if something heavy had been sitting there for years. At first I couldn’t say what bothered me about it. It was just a chair. But whenever I looked at it, really looked, I felt the same way I had as a kid being told to stay out of the corners.

The first night, I slept on the couch. Not because the bed upstairs wasn’t fine, it was, but because I couldn’t bear the thought of that thing sitting down here in the dark, alone. Watching. I told myself I’d move it in the morning. Stick it in the basement or haul it out to the curb. But morning came, and when I walked into the living room, the idea of touching it made my stomach twist. So I left it. Days passed like that. I unpacked, found a job, started settling in. The chair stayed. I never sat in it. I barely went near it. But every time I crossed the room, I felt it like a weight at the corner of my vision. 

Sometimes, I thought it had shifted. Just a little. Tilted more toward the couch. Angled a few inches differently. It was probably just me remembering it wrong. But once, I dug out an old family photo from the attic. My uncle, sitting in that very chair, his face half in shadow. And the chair in the photo looked… taller. The days began to stretch out in that house. I thought moving into an inherited place would make me feel more rooted, like I belonged somewhere, but it had the opposite effect. The rooms felt borrowed, heavy with a history I didn’t understand. The living room was worst of all. I started avoiding it when I could. 

I’d make food in the kitchen, carry it upstairs to my room, and eat on my bed like I was still a teenager. When friends from work asked if I wanted to hang out, I said yes every time, even if I was exhausted, just so I wouldn’t have to go home until late. But eventually, you always have to come home. The chair was always waiting. It wasn’t that it did anything. That was the problem. If it had moved, or made a noise, or done something I could point at and say look, that’s what’s wrong, I might have had a reason to get rid of it. But it just sat there, angled toward the center of the room like it was part of some invisible conversation. 

More than once, I thought I saw someone in it. Just for a flash, a shape, a dip in the fabric like weight had settled into it. When I blinked, the chair was empty. One night, I made myself a cup of tea and tried to sit across from it, just to prove I could. I lasted maybe five minutes. The longer I stared at it, the stronger the feeling grew that the chair was staring back. Not in a metaphorical sense. Not just my imagination running wild. It felt… mutual. That was the night I noticed the fabric. In the daylight, it just looked faded. But under the soft glow of the lamp, I realized the red wasn’t dull from time. It was stained. 

Dark patches bloomed under the arms, along the cushion, trailing faintly down the legs. I reached for my phone to take a picture, but when I looked again, the patches were gone. I told myself I needed sleep. That the old house was getting under my skin. Still, I didn’t go back in the living room for the rest of the night. I started paying attention to old photos in the house. My uncle wasn’t much for decorating, but there were a handful of framed pictures tucked away in drawers or hung crooked in the hallway. Three of them showed him in the living room. And in all three, he was sitting in the chair.The first photo was ordinary: him in his thirties, a book open in his lap. 

But the second one… it bothered me. His posture was stiff, too upright, his hands gripping the arms like he was holding himself in place. His smile didn’t reach his eyes. The third was the worst. He was older in that one, maybe not long before he died. The photo was washed out, like it had sat in sunlight too long. But the chair, The chair looked different. Taller again, its back rising a few inches higher, the shape of it more… narrow. Like it had grown. I tried to brush it off as bad angles, aging furniture, tricks of the light. But I started to notice other things, too. The cushion seemed to dip deeper some days, like something heavy had been sitting there. The arms bore faint impressions, the kind you’d see if someone had gripped them hard. And sometimes, God, I hated this, sometimes I’d walk into the room and catch the faintest whiff of sweat. Not the musty smell of old fabric. Fresh. Human. 

Once I heard something, a tiny creak, like wood flexing under weight. But I was standing in the doorway. Watching it. Empty. I remember whispering to myself, don’t look too long. Because that was the other thing. The longer I stared, the worse it got. My chest would tighten, my eyes would blur, like the chair was pulling at something behind them. Like it wanted me to sink into it, not just my body but my focus, my time, my thoughts. And every night, I dreamed of corners. Dark corners, where something waited just out of sight. A few weeks in, I ran into the neighbor across the street, an older woman who’d lived there longer than I’d been alive. 

She asked how I was settling in. “Alright,” I said. “The place is… quiet.” She gave me this look, the kind people give when they’re trying to decide if they should say something. Finally, she asked, “Do you still have all his things?” “Most of it,” I said. Her eyes flicked past me, toward the living room window. “Even the chair?” I asked her what she meant, but she shook her head like she’d already said too much. “Your uncle… he spent most of his time in that chair. Wouldn’t let anyone else sit in it. Used to talk to it like it was an old friend. Sometimes… well, Sometimes… I swore it talked back.” She laughed after she said that, as if to wave it off. But the sound was thin and nervous. 

That night, I sat at the top of the stairs long after midnight, staring down at the living room. The house was silent except for the hum of the fridge and the occasional creak of the walls cooling in the night. The chair was a dark shape by the fireplace. Still. Waiting. I stayed there until my legs went numb. I don’t know what I was expecting, movement, maybe, or a sound. Some proof that I wasn’t going crazy. But nothing happened. It was the next morning when I noticed the rug. It had shifted a few inches, just enough that its corner no longer lined up with the base of the chair. I would have blamed myself, except I hadn’t set foot in the living room that night. 

And then there were the impressions. At first, I thought I was imagining them. The cushion seemed sunken in deeper, like something had sat there long enough to reshape the stuffing. A faint hollow at the back, where a head might rest. Two shallow dents at the arms, where fingers might grip. I pressed my hand into it once, just to see. The fabric was cold. Not the cool of a drafty house. Colder. I jerked my hand back and didn’t touch it again. I started sleeping with the bedroom door shut. It didn’t make much difference, I could still feel it down there, like a presence pressing against the floorboards, but at least the wood between us gave me the illusion of distance. 

One night, I woke to a sound that froze me in place. It wasn’t loud, not even close. Just a faint, steady creak. The kind you hear when someone shifts their weight in a chair. I held my breath until the sound stopped. In the morning, when I finally went downstairs, the first thing I noticed was the angle. The chair had turned slightly. Not much, maybe twenty degrees, but it no longer faced the fireplace. It faced the stairs. I stopped going into the living room at all after that. I carried my things upstairs: books, laptop, even a lamp from the hall. I told myself I’d just turned into one of those people who lived out of their bedroom. But the truth was, I couldn’t stand being near it anymore. 

Still, the house wouldn’t let me forget. From the corner of my eye, I caught it in reflections, the shine of the TV screen when it was off, the glass of a picture frame. I’d see a tall, red shadow in the room behind me, even if I hadn’t looked directly. Once, when I passed the living room doorway, I could have sworn the fabric was brighter. Not the faded, dusty red I was used to. Fresher. Almost wet. That same week, I found a box of my uncle’s things shoved into the back of the hallway closet. Papers, receipts, notebooks with barely legible scrawl. Most of it was mundane. But in one battered composition book,…page after page was filled with only three words: *I see you.* Written again and again, in frantic loops until the paper tore. And on the very last page, a single line, 'It knows when you notice'. 

After I found the notebook, I started leaving lights on in the house. The living room lamp stayed lit through the night, casting its glow across the chair. Somehow, it felt safer to see it than to let it sit in darkness. But the light didn’t help. Some nights I’d creep down the stairs, peeking through the banister like a child spying on intruders. The chair was always there, exactly where it should be. But my eyes would play tricks. The shadows seemed too deep in its seams, too dark under its arms, as though the lamp couldn’t quite reach those places. 

Once, I swore I saw the fabric move. Not a shift of the wood, not a trick of my vision. The fabric itself. It tightened, like something underneath was drawing breath. I didn’t tell anyone. How could I? “Hey, I think my dead uncle’s armchair is alive”, that’s not a conversation you walk away from without people questioning your sanity. So I tried to rationalize it. I told myself the house was old. That my uncle had been lonely and his habits were rubbing off on me. That if I just ignored the chair, it would fade into the background the way all furniture should. But it never did. Every day, I felt more aware of it. The way the room seemed arranged around it. The way the air grew heavier when I walked past. The way I sometimes woke up with the imprint of its fabric on my palms, as if I’d been clutching it in my sleep.

 The worst was the dream. I was standing in the living room. The chair sat across from me, bathed in the same weak lamplight. But when I looked at it, I realized it wasn’t empty. Something sat in it, tall, thin, folded into the chair like it had grown from it. Its skin was the same dull red, its head tilted in the exact angle the chair always seemed to keep. When it leaned forward, I woke gasping, my chest aching like something had pressed against it. After that, I couldn’t keep quiet anymore. A few nights after the dream, I woke to a sound downstairs. Not creaking this time. Something softer. Breathing. I lay frozen, my ear straining against the silence. It was faint, but steady. A rhythm too controlled to be the house settling. I told myself it was in my head. That I’d carried the dream into waking. But then the rhythm stuttered, like whoever, whatever, was breathing had realized I was listening. I didn’t sleep the rest of that night. 

The next morning, I went downstairs, half-expecting to find nothing unusual. But the living room… the living room was wrong. The chair was angled toward the hallway now. Toward me. I stopped in the doorway, gripping the frame so tight my knuckles ached. For the first time, I really looked at it. Not a glance. Not the quick, guilty acknowledgment I’d been giving it for weeks. I stared. The fabric wasn’t faded at all. It was vibrant. Wet-looking, even. And the longer I looked, the more I realized the pattern I thought was floral wasn’t floral at all. It was ridged. Layered. Like muscle fibers. My throat tightened. My chest burned. And then, without even thinking, I heard myself say it. “...What do you want?” The words were out before I could swallow them back. And then, God help me, the chair answered. The sound didn’t come from its wood, or its cushions, or the air in the room. It came from inside my head, thick and warm and crawling behind my eyes. It said, “I was waiting for you to ask.” 

I didn’t move. Couldn’t. The words echoed inside me, low and damp, like they’d been whispered through water. I stared at the chair until my vision blurred, waiting for it to say more, waiting for it to move, to shift, to prove what I’d just heard wasn’t me unraveling. But it stayed still. Silent. Just an old piece of furniture bathed in dusty morning light. Hours later, I was still in the doorway, my body stiff, my lips dry. Eventually I stumbled back upstairs, locked my bedroom door, and sat on the floor until night came. For days, I didn’t go near the living room. I moved through the house like a thief, hugging the walls, keeping my eyes averted. I almost convinced myself I’d imagined it. That the words hadn’t been real. That I’d finally cracked under the weight of this place and my uncle’s madness. Almost. But then, I started noticing things. The way the cushions were indented when I knew I hadn’t sat in them. The faint warmth that clung to the upholstery, like a body had just risen from it. And the worst, the sound. Every so often, late at night, I’d hear it, that same faint breathing. Only now, it matched mine. Inhale. Exhale. Perfectly in sync. As if, somewhere in the dark house, something was sitting very still, waiting for me to notice again. 

One evening, I came home later than usual. The sun had already dipped, the house sunk into shadow. I hesitated in the doorway, my hand still on the knob, because the air inside didn’t feel right. It was warm. Too warm. Like someone had been sitting in the house all day, breathing it full. I tried to go straight upstairs, but I couldn’t help it, I glanced toward the living room. Just once. The chair was turned again. Not toward the fireplace. Not toward the hallway. It was angled toward the front door. Toward me. I froze. My pulse thundered in my ears. And then, before I could even stop myself, I did something stupid, I laughed. A quick, nervous bark. The kind of laugh you make when you’ve nearly tripped in public and hope no one saw. “Fine,” I said under my breath, my voice shaking. “You win. You’re creepy. Happy?” I didn’t expect a response. I didn’t want one. But the cushions sank. Slowly. Deliberately. As if something unseen had leaned forward to listen. 

That was the first night I slept with a chair propped under my bedroom door knob. For the next week, I told myself not to acknowledge it again. Not to feed into whatever it wanted. But the house… the house was changing. I’d wake to find things misplaced. A picture frame tilted. A book nudged off the shelf. Once, my shoes were waiting neatly at the foot of the living room chair, side by side, toes pointing in. And through all of it, that suffocating awareness grew stronger. It wasn’t just that the chair was in the house. It was that the house felt like it belonged to the chair. It happened on a Sunday. I hadn’t left the house all day, too uneasy to face the outside world, too exhausted to fight the thing inside. 

By late afternoon, I found myself standing at the threshold of the living room, staring at it again. My stomach turned as I realized how natural it felt now, like the chair had become the center of my orbit, and every hallway, every step in the house curved back toward it. I don’t know why I opened my mouth. Maybe I was tired. Maybe I wanted proof. Maybe part of me thought I could win. “…I know you’re not just a chair,” I said. My voice sounded small in the room, swallowed by the heavy air. “I know you’re there.” For a moment, nothing. Just the steady hum of the refrigerator from the kitchen, the tick of the clock on the mantel. And then, that same thick voice seeped into me, wrapping around the inside of my skull. “Finally,” it said. “You see me.” I staggered back a step, gripping the doorframe. My throat was dry, but I forced words out anyway. “What are you?” The chair didn’t move. But the air felt tighter, as if the walls had leaned closer. “I’m what stays,” it murmured. “When everyone else leaves.” 

I thought of my uncle then. Of the notebook filled with frantic words, of the way his handwriting had crumbled into jagged scratches. “You talked to him too,” I whispered. The cushions creaked, though nothing shifted. “He noticed,” it said. “Like you. That’s all it takes. To notice. To see.” My chest clenched. I wanted to run. To slam the door and never come back. But my legs wouldn’t move. “What do you want from me?” This time, the pause felt long enough to crush me. And then: “I want to be remembered.” I didn’t tell anyone about the conversation. How could I? If I tried to describe it, I’d sound insane. I felt the words, not through my ears but like they’d been stitched into the folds of my brain. But the worst part wasn’t the words. It was the relief. Somehow, having it acknowledge me eased the pressure I’d been living under for weeks. Like finally scratching at an itch that had been buried too deep. I hated that feeling. Hated myself for it. But I couldn’t deny it. 

Over the next few days, I caught myself hovering near the living room. I wouldn’t go inside, not at first, but I’d linger in the hall, waiting. Listening. My pulse would quicken if the house creaked, if the air shifted, if I thought I heard that low, wet voice again. And sometimes, I did. Not long sentences. Just fragments. “Closer.” “Sit.” “Talk to me.” I resisted. At least at first. I told myself I wouldn’t end up like my uncle, hunched over notebooks, words unraveling into nothing. I told myself I was stronger. But one night, I snapped. I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, heart pounding against the silence. I couldn’t take it anymore. I got up, padded barefoot down the stairs, and stopped in the living room doorway. The chair waited in its usual spot. It wasn’t turned toward the fireplace anymore. It wasn’t turned toward the hall, or the stairs, or the door. It was angled perfectly at the foot of the steps, like it had been watching me all along. I swallowed hard. My throat burned. “…What happens if I sit?” I asked. The answer came instantly, crawling through my skull. “Then you’ll know me.” The cushions sighed, as though shifting to make room. For a long moment, I just stood there, staring at the hollow dip of its seat. And I swear I saw the faintest trace of warmth rise from it, like steam off skin. 

I almost stepped forward. Almost. But I didn’t. Not that night. I fled back upstairs, slammed the door, and shoved the dresser in front of it until the wood groaned. Still, even barricaded in, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something waited just below me, smiling without a face. I stopped going downstairs at night. At least, that was the plan. But it never left me alone. I’d hear it creaking faintly through the floorboards. Not random groans of wood, not the shuffle of an old house settling, no. These sounds had rhythm. Like a slow, deliberate rocking. Back and forth. Back and forth. Sometimes it matched my heartbeat. Sometimes it was out of step, like it was trying to force me into its rhythm instead. I started sleeping with music on, earbuds jammed in until my ears ached, but that didn’t block it out. The voice slipped past everything. “Talk to me.” “Don’t ignore me.” “You see me.” One night, I woke with my hand outstretched, fingers brushing the doorknob of my locked bedroom door. I didn’t even remember standing up. I yanked my hand back like I’d touched fire and curled on the floor, trembling until morning. 

The next day, I found something waiting for me on the kitchen table. It was one of my uncle’s notebooks. Not the one filled with I see you, but another, one I was sure I’d shoved back into the closet. The book was open. And on the page, in fresh ink, was a single sentence: “Don’t make me wait.” I threw it in the trash. An hour later, when I came back into the kitchen, it was back on the table. Same page. Same words. Only now, there was more. “It’s rude to ignore your guest.” I wanted to burn the whole house down. To walk out and never return. But every time I pictured leaving, I felt this terrible weight in my chest, like something deep in me was tightening its grip. Like the chair wasn’t just in the house anymore. It was in me. A week later, my cousin dropped by. She hadn’t seen the house since the funeral and insisted on checking in, making sure I was “settling in okay.” I almost told her to leave. The thought of anyone else being in the house made my skin crawl. But I didn’t want to raise suspicion. So I let her in. She walked through the halls, commenting on the old wallpaper, the smell of dust, the way the floor dipped in certain places. When we reached the living room doorway, I stopped short. 

The chair was right there. Front and center. Angled toward us both. I braced myself, waiting for her to gasp or freeze or at least notice. But she didn’t. She looked straight at it, smiled faintly, and said, “Oh, you kept that old coat rack of his." I thought for sure you’d throw that thing out.” My stomach dropped. Coat rack? I stared at her, then back at the chair. It was still a chair. Same heavy wooden arms. Same deep red fabric. Same impossible weight pressing into the air. But she didn’t see it. She saw something else entirely. I tried to keep my voice steady. “That’s… that’s not a coat rack.” She gave me a puzzled look. “Of course it is. Same one that used to sit in the corner, right? He was always hanging his hats on it. God, it looks just like him, doesn’t it? Sitting there.” Sitting there. Her words made my chest lock up. My throat went dry. She didn’t notice my panic. She just laughed softly and wandered off toward the kitchen, leaving me alone in the doorway with it. The chair didn’t move. Didn’t speak. But I could feel it gloating. And for the first time, I understood what it meant when it said: I want to be remembered. 

After my cousin left, I couldn’t stop thinking about what she’d said. Coat rack. I replayed it over and over in my head, like a scratched record. She hadn’t hesitated, hadn’t blinked. She’d looked right at it, and her brain had filled in the wrong shape. I tested myself. I pulled out my phone and snapped a picture of the living room. Looked at it immediately. My breath caught. The chair wasn’t there. Not a coat rack, not a shadow, not anything at all. Just the empty space where it should have been. I tried again. Different angles. Video. Nothing. Always the same. But when I lowered the phone, there it was, staring at me with fabric that looked fresher, wetter, as though mocking me for trying. That night, I didn’t sleep. I couldn’t. I sat on the floor of my bedroom, back against the wall, whispering to myself just to fill the silence. Every so often, I swore I heard it answering. Not words this time, just agreement. A subtle shift of air when I nodded, a faint creak when I muttered yes. It was listening. I started catching myself talking to it without realizing. Out loud. Mundane things, like what I was eating, or how I’d found another of my uncle’s books, or how the weather was changing. 

Like I was making conversation with a roommate. And each time I slipped, the house seemed to sigh with relief. The air grew easier to breathe. The pressure in my chest loosened. Until I stopped. That’s when it punished me. I woke one night to find my bedroom lamp smashed on the floor. My sheets damp, reeking of mildew. And scrawled on the wall above my bed, in letters the color of dried rust: “Don’t make me wait.” I stared until the words blurred with tears. And then I whispered, “I’m sorry.” The house went still again. 

Almost gentle. Like I’d said exactly what it wanted to hear. From that night on, I stopped fighting it. Not completely, I didn’t sit in it, not yet, but I gave it what it seemed to want. Words. Acknowledgment. I’d pass the doorway and murmur, “Good morning.” Whisper, “I see you,” before going upstairs. Sometimes I’d even tell it what I’d eaten for dinner, like a child reporting to a parent. Each time, the air grew lighter. My chest loosened. The house felt less hostile. But it wasn’t enough. Soon, the voice returned. “Closer.” 

I obeyed. I began standing in the living room instead of the doorway, my feet sunk into the worn rug, my body trembling as I spoke to it. “Stay longer.” I obeyed. Minutes stretched into hours as I lingered in its presence, filling the silence with nervous rambling. Sometimes I swore I heard it hum in response, low and steady, vibrating through the floor. “Touch me.” I resisted at first. But the pressure in the house built until it was unbearable — every step heavy, every breath sharp. Finally, with shaking fingers, I brushed the armrest. Warm. Not just warm. Hot. I yanked my hand back, but the voice purred inside me, thick with satisfaction. “Good.” 

That night, I dreamed of sitting in it. The cushions rising to meet me, folding around me, pulling me down until I wasn’t sure where I ended and it began. When I woke, my body ached. My skin bore faint lines, red and ridged, as if pressed into fabric while I slept. I hadn’t left my bed. But I knew what it meant. The chair wasn’t going to be patient much longer. It didn’t ask anymore. It commanded. “Sit.” The word rattled through the room like a slammed door. My knees buckled, but I caught myself on the wall. “No,” I whispered. My throat was dry. “I don’t, I can’t.” The air thickened instantly, choking. The lights buzzed, dimmed. 

The walls seemed to lean inward. My own skin prickled like a thousand needles. “Sit.” The second time, it wasn’t a command. It was inevitability. I stumbled forward without meaning to, feet dragging across the rug. My chest heaved. My vision tunneled. Every part of me screamed to stop, but my body moved as though strings had been tied to my limbs. I pressed my palms into the armrests. They burned. The wood was alive, trembling under my skin like muscle. I fought. I swear I did. I dug my nails into the fabric. I screamed until my voice cracked. My legs shook as I tried to pull back.

But the cushions rose to meet me. The seat gave way, sucking me down. The fabric clenched around my thighs, my hips, my chest. The smell of rot filled my nose, sweet and wet. I was inside before I realized I’d given up. My body slackened. My head lolled back against the rest, like I’d finally come home. And then “Good.”

The word was warm inside my skull. Too warm. My heartbeat slowed, syncing with something deeper, something beneath the floor. I couldn’t move anymore. Couldn’t think. The room blurred, edges softening, colors dimming. All I could feel was the chair. All I could hear was the chair. All I could be… was the chair. Weeks passed.

Dr I don’t know how long. Time stopped in the house. The windows didn’t matter. The doors didn’t matter. Everything revolved around the chair now. And then one day, someone else moved in. I don’t know who. I don’t know when. But I know they walked past the doorway and saw me sitting there. Waiting. They smiled faintly. Commented on how nice the furniture was. I tried to warn them. Tried to tell them. But it was too late.

The air shifted around them, heavy and warm. The cushions rose, forming just the right shape, just the right pull. And I… I watched. Because that’s all I can do now. All I can do is wait. For them to notice. For them to see me. For them to sit. The chair is patient. Always patient. And it never stops waiting.
