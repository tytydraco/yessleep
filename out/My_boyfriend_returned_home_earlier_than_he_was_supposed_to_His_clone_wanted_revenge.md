Ramirez was chaos wrapped in charm. Loud, reckless, impossible to ignore, but somehow I loved every second of it. He had a way of making ordinary life feel like a battle, and dangerous life feel like a game. Even in the worst situations, he laughed. Even when he bragged about surviving near-death fights, I found it endearing.

We had been together for years. I first met him when he returned to his hometown for a break after a war. He got to return to the battlefield once again a few months ago. Every separation, every long-distance call, every anxious night waiting for him to return felt like its own war. And now, after months apart, he was coming home. I didn’t expect anything, but what I got was… something else.

I was sitting on my couch, calculating how much I had earned that day when my phone buzzed. Ramirez. My heart leapt.

“Teressa! You’re not going to believe today,” his voice rang sharp with energy.

I sank onto the couch. “Try me.”

“Oh man… chaos.” He laughed, the sound carrying through the line like it belonged to another world. “The battlefield was brutal. There must have been billions of casualties. Our sergeant, Foster, got pushed into a pile of mud by the pushing force of a bomb. Briggs dropped his gun mid-fight, and somehow tripped over it like an idiot. Cole tried to throw a grenade… forgot the pin, so he basically gave his enemies a weapon. And Chen? He screamed at the explosions like he was five.”

I laughed until my stomach ached. “You’re insane. How are you still alive?”

“Pure skill… and luck,” he said. Behind him, I could hear the chaos: shouting, crashes, Cole yelling, Chen wailing, Briggs cursing, Foster shrieking. The squad then threw chairs, spoons, everything at Ramirez. He laughed while dodging thrown projectiles.

“Good news though. Command said we might get a week off — home visits. Maybe in seven days.” Foster told his squad, off-screen.

I gasped. “Seven days? Really?”  
  
In the background, I heard the squad reacting, chaos mixing with relief. Cole whooped. Briggs shouted about food. Chen laughed shakily.   
   
Ramirez grinned. “Yeah… I’m coming home.”

I hugged the phone. “I can’t wait.”

I didn’t know it yet, but this call was the calm before a storm.



I was having breakfast when suddenly... The knock came early. I opened the door to see Ramirez, messy hair, uniform, lazy grin. My chest surged.

“Surprise,” he said.

“What… how? You weren’t supposed to come for another week!”

“I told command I needed to see my girl. They agreed.”

I threw myself into his arms. Warmth, scent, laugh. Everything seemed normal.

The day was mundane — takeout, movies, conversation — everything normal. No hesitation. No subtle wrongness. No micro-twitches. Perfect. 



The next morning arrived. The sun stretched its pale fingers across the blinds, spilling light in thin stripes across the kitchen floor. My bare feet pressed into the cold wood as I stepped in, coffee mug in hand, and there he was, Ramirez. Hair messy, shirt rumpled from sleep, smiling lazily as he stirred his own cup.

“Morning,” I said, trying to keep my voice light.

“Morning,” he replied, grinning, but there was a subtle… precision to the way he moved. Too smooth, almost like he was consciously performing normality. His hand held the spoon just a fraction too still as he stirred, watching the swirls carefully.

I took my coffee. It smelled perfect, rich, warm and enticing. I sipped, and almost immediately noticed it was too perfect, not the messy, slightly burnt disaster he usually made that somehow always tasted like him.

“Smells amazing,” I said.

“Yeah, thought I’d do it right this time,” he said, shrugging, and I felt a small, unplaceable prickle of unease. Maybe he was just tired.

We ate breakfast together. The eggs were almost too neatly cooked, yolks perfectly round, toast evenly browned. He reached for the plate with his right hand, hesitated, and then switched to his left. “Guess I’m a bit ambidextrous today,” he said with a grin, and I laughed, but my pulse ticked a little faster than usual.

Everything was normal enough. Almost too normal. I told myself: He’s home, he’s safe. That’s all that matters.



By the afternoon, though, the subtle cracks started appearing. Ramirez moved through the kitchen again, cooking. I watched him cut vegetables with near-perfect precision. Bacon sizzled, eggs flipped without a single drop escaping the pan. Even the sound of the knife hitting the cutting board was measured, rhythmic, and far too precise. My stomach knotted. Ramirez had always been disastrous in the kitchen. Always.

Then I saw it: a thin line along his forearm, almost hidden beneath his sleeve. I leaned closer. Blue liquid, blood-like, thick, shimmering faintly in the sunlight.

“Ramirez…” My voice trembled.

He looked down. Calm, unnervingly calm. “Paint. Don’t worry about it.”

My stomach sank. My mind raced. That wan’t paint. That looked an awful lot like blood. Blue blood.

Then we got down to have dinner. I watched him carefully. My eyes immediately caught that he was holding his mug of coffee with his right hand. He was painfully left-handed. He couldn't even unscrew a jar with his right hand. He noticed my stare, smiled tightly, and switched hands. “I’m… ambidextrous,” he said quickly, a laugh too forced to sound genuine.

Every movement, every blink, every subtle twitch felt… wrong. Too deliberate, too smooth, rehearsed. Yet in his words, in his smiles, in the way he laughed — he looked exactly like Ramirez. And that was what made it worse.

The next day progressed almost normally, though. We moved from breakfast to lounging in the living room, the sun casting soft light across his figure. And still, my unease grew. I could see it now — just barely — in the faint shimmer of his skin in the light, the imperceptible stiffness in his fingers, the unnatural smoothness of his movements.

By the end of the day, my heart pounded every time he moved. Every step, every gesture, every word held a tension I couldn’t explain. It wasn’t outright terrifying yet, but the seed of dread had been planted. I could feel it creeping, coiling, waiting.

Then. Evening. Couch. Music soft.

“Remember our first date?” he asked.

“You wore that blue dress with white stripes,” he said.

I froze. I never had that dress. I was about to correct him when I thought to myself: "He is probably suffering from trauma from the war. Just a tiny bit of memory loss". I calmed down, a bit.

Later, Ramirez cracked a joke. Wrong timing. Wrong tone. Flat. Hollow.

Hands too stiff. Fingers curling unnaturally. Posture rigid. Head tilt slightly off. Anxiety tightening in my chest. I had a feeling he wasn't my beloved Ramirez. A strong feeling.



That night, I was sleeping when I got woken up to some noises. I came into the hallway. The hallway was dark, the faint light from the blinds barely cutting through the gloom. My bare feet pressed against the cold wood, heart hammering. Then I heard it — a wet, subtle noise, like skin stretching. My pulse leapt.

I edged forward and froze. There he was — Ramirez… or what looked like him. But wrong. So wrong. His body twisted unnaturally, muscles rippling under black-blue skin that shimmered like oil. Limbs bent at impossible angles. Multiple small, dark eyes flickered independently.

The mouth opened wide, teeth jagged, a wet rasping hiss escaping. “Teressa…” Like it was practicing to mimic Ramirez. Every movement was fluid, calculated, alien. The blue blood glistened along a forearm wound. My stomach churned.

I wanted to scream but could not. My legs refused to move, my hands shook uncontrollably as I pressed them to my mouth. The creature’s head tilted slightly, mimicking the way Ramirez used to glance when he smiled — but this was a mockery, twisted, hollow.

Then it moved its hands toward something in the bathroom — I couldn’t see clearly, my gaze glued to the impossible limbs, the twitching torso, the way it *stretched* and *morphed* fluidly. A wet, tearing noise rose, louder this time. My stomach turned violently, bile rising.

The smell hit me then. Coppery, metallic, sharp, acrid. Blood, but not human blood. Thick, black-blue, almost luminescent, sticky. My throat tightened, panic coiling around my heart. My breaths came fast, shallow, uneven.

And the worst of it: the way it moved. Every twitch, every step, every subtle bend of the spine *was calculated*, like a predator testing its own body for efficiency. My mind screamed: this isn’t Ramirez. Ramirez would never. Could never. *Do this.*

I stumbled back, hands fumbling against the wall, trying to escape the sight, but my eyes remained locked. The creature turned its head toward me, eyes shimmering black, mouth stretching into a horrifying approximation of a smile — and I realized it *knew I was watching. I*t hissed again — wet, rasping, familiar yet alien. “You shouldn’t have seen this…”

I barreled through the house, knocking over chairs and tables, slipping on the slick floor, lungs burning. At the stairs, I glimpsed it moving like liquid metal, faster than I could comprehend. Then, it suddenly boosted its speed. I got cornered not long after that.  
  
The creature stopped a few feet away, tilting its head. Its voice — wet, rasping — filled the space. “Years ago, your boyfriend took half of my heart. That weakened me… but I learned. I learned to shapeshift. And now… you will pay.”  
  
Then, faintly, voices. Male voices, familiar. Ramirez. My mind lit up — hope flaring like a fire.  
  
"So this is your house?" a voice asked.

“Yep, I’m going to show the whole squad my sweet sweet girlfriend,” Ramirez said.

The creature froze — a fraction too slow. I lunged into the doorway. The squad was there, Foster, Ramirez, Cole, Briggs, Chen, Holt, shocked to see a mutated figure. 

“What… the *hell*,” Foster whispered.

The creature lunged.

Ramirez didn’t hesitate. He swung the iron bar he’d grabbed from outside earlier — a stupid thing he’d used for pull-ups — and it connected with a sickening, metallic crack. The force’s arm jerked back, but the bar bent inward like soft aluminum.

It screamed — a vibrating, layered howl that made my teeth buzz.

“TERESSA, MOVE!” Ramirez shouted.

I dove behind the hallway cabinet as the beast twisted backward, spine snapping into a new shape as it regained balance. Briggs charged with his hatchet, screaming, but the creature whirled, a blur of black-blue muscle, and Briggs barely dodged the claw swipe that would’ve opened his ribs.

“Blue blood!” Ramirez gasped. “IT’S THE FORCE — GUNS DON’T WORK ON IT!”

“MAGAZINES DOWN!” Foster barked. “CLOSE COMBAT!”

The creature rushed again, impossibly fast. Ramirez planted himself in the center of the squad, blocking with the half-broken bar as the thing’s claws slashed downward. Metal screeched. Sparks burst. The bar almost split in two.

“COME ON THEN, YOU UGLY—” Ramirez grunted, shoving back.

Chen vaulted the kitchen counter and stabbed downward with a long survival knife. The blade sank in — barely an inch. Blue blood hissed out, smoking on the tile.

The creature didn’t even flinch.

It flung Chen backwards with a single arm sweep. He slammed into the fridge with a grunt.

Cole rushed in next — terrified but furious — swinging a crowbar like his life depended on it. The force caught the crowbar mid-swing, bent it like a pipe cleaner, and hurled Cole across the living room.

“Ramirez, LEFT!” Foster roared.

The creature’s arm flashed up, ready to slice his throat.

Ramirez ducked at the last possible second, grabbed its wrist, and — with a snarl — *pivoted* his whole weight. I saw the veins bulge in his neck as he twisted, dragging the thing off balance. He shouted, putting everything into one desperate move, and **threw the monster through the living room window**.

Glass exploded everywhere. The creature hit the ground outside in a spray of blue.

But it got up.

Of course it got up.

It launched itself back inside, shards of glass clinging to its body. Foster shoved a table into its path — the force tore it apart like cardboard. Eli and Briggs came at it from both sides, striking its legs, trying to topple it. Chen staggered back into the fight, knife ready.

I watched, trembling, as the squad formed a tight semicircle around Ramirez.

The creature hissed — a long, wet, seething sound.

Then it charged.

Weapons clashed. Wood splintered. Blades scraped bone. The air filled with blue mist and grunts of effort, the room shaking with every impact. Briggs managed to bury an axe into its shoulder; Chen drove his knife repeatedly into its ribs; Foster used a broken chair leg as a spear, ramming the creature against the wall.

The beast thrashed, limbs bending at impossible angles. It grabbed Ramirez by the vest and slammed him into the wall — hard enough to crack the drywall. He slid down, dazed.

“RAMIREZ!” I screamed.

The creature reared back, ready to finish him.

Briggs and Foster tackled it at once, dragging it sideways. Holt leapt on its back, stabbing wildly into its neck. Blue blood sprayed across the ceiling. The force twisted violently, flinging Holt off, but the damage had slowed it. Its movements faltered — just slightly.

Just enough.

Ramirez surged up with one last roar, grabbed the creature by the back of the head, and *slammed* it face-first onto the glass-strewn floor. Chen’s knife plunged down. Briggs followed with another strike. The creature convulsed, shrieking, limbs spasming in all directions.

Then it stopped.

The room went eerily silent except for the squad’s ragged breathing. Blue blood slowly pooled across the broken floorboards.

Ramirez stumbled toward me, chest heaving, face streaked with sweat and dust. He dropped the broken iron bar, grabbed my shaking shoulders, and pulled me close.

“It’s dead,” he whispered, voice trembling for the first time since I’d met him. “This time… it’s really dead.”

Then Ramirez looked at the mess, whistled softly, and nudged a puddle of blue blood with the toe of his boot.

“Welp…” he said, completely deadpan, “at least Dr. Davis is gonna be thrilled. Man’s been begging for more samples for months.”  
He gestured vaguely at the splattered walls. “Pretty sure this counts as… I dunno… *same-day bulk shipping.*”

Foster barked a laugh he immediately tried to smother. “Bro, you basically delivered him a whole warehouse.”

Ramirez shrugged, smirking like he hadn’t nearly been disemboweled ten minutes ago. “What can I say? I care about my coworkers.”

I stared at him, exhausted, trembling, but somehow still able to roll my eyes. “Only you would survive a monster impersonating you and still worry about a scientist’s wishlist.”

He winked. “Babe, I’m a multitasker.”

I let out a shaky breath—half a sob, half a laugh—and finally stepped forward, pressing my forehead to his chest. His arms wrapped around me instantly, tight and warm and real.

The others gave us a little space, stepping back among the shards and the blood.

The house was a disaster. I was a disaster.

But Ramirez was here. The real him.

And that alone made the ruins feel survivable.

But I knew, deep down, that the safety wouldn’t stay with me long.

Even laughter couldn’t chase all the fear away.
