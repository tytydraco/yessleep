1. *Whatever is mine is also yours…”

It seemed like years ago when she first told me, when we connected within the first month of freshmen college, and decided we were best friends. We looked alike, people said, and could easily pass for sisters, our features like twins in a crowd, but the things we liked, the things we said and thought were vastly different- our personalities were different. 

Lana was assertive, charismatic, the type of girl that boys loved and girls hated. I know, because all the girls asked why I hung out with Lana. She dressed up nice and always had makeup on, but the girls were jealous she was so calm and got everyone’s attention. 

One night I Lana put makeup on me, soft brushes against my eyelids and our breathes entangling as she lean close to draw my eyeliner, the liquid cool against my warm skin. She walked with me into the bathroom and then I almost jumped back at who I was—in the mirror we looked so alike it bothered me.

It wasn’t normal. 

I wiped my face with her makeup remover and it only smeared until Lana took over and I looked down at her tight top as she gently cleaned my face. 

Our college life was trying our firsts with each other- clubbing, fighting, making up, hanging out for holidays, taking driving classes together, failing our drivers test together. She moved away her second year and I cried. She promised she would return from California and we would meet in my place in New York. 

We were each others best friends, and we shared anything we could. In those two years of college after she moved we called all the time, and I told her about my boyfriend, who she would meet when she came over to the club with us. 

I was nervous when they met, maybe I had a premonition. Lana had dyed her hair and was wearing black all the time now and we were different-but my ex pretty much fell head over heels with Lana. I could tell, his eyes avoided hers but when she turned he stared at her in oblivion to my stares. He said lame jokes when they were seated next to each other, jokes me told me but with much more stumbling. Most of all, I could tell because when Lana laughed at a mistake he made he looked at her and laughed and moved closer to her and further from me. I didn’t chase, I stood there, watching his idiocy. 

His libido grew and faded and grew and one night, after roughly grabbing me without foreplay, I remembered thinking how I fell out of love for him. During sex, he muttered her name. I was so stunned I couldn't push him away and he cummed in me again and I showered without asking him why. 

O after my breakup Lana took me out for dinner at a nice restaurant. I was dressed in jeans before she sighed and gave me a dress she brought along, a midi dress with lovely green satin dress that look regal. She zipped it behind me and once again in the mirror we were so similar-but so distant. 

She was here, in the real world, but I was back home in a dark corner, gasping for breath. Choked. Strangled. 

Jealous.  

“Come on, look up and smile,” Lana said. “You’re beautiful, Angel. Whatever’s mine is also yours. You can wear my dresses and clothing.”


*You're like my twin…*

Lana was no less of a local celebrity in her new university in California. She was always posting stories of her new adventures, hot female friends, and good looking guys. Every story made me feel some kind of way I couldn’t explain—I only wanted to be with her. 

We called one night and I mentioned how amazing she was, she could get anyone, guy or girl. 

Lana’s voice dropped as she whispered, “Inside, I don’t feel happy at all.”

“Really?” I placed on my concerned face. “Why?”

“I feel like it’s all going to be forgotten within a year and when I graduated we won’t initiate a reunion.” 

“I feel the same,” I lied. Her eyes widened. “Sometimes I’m afraid you’ll slip away, too.”

“Me too!” Lana piped up. “I’m afraid you’ll leave me. My friends are the same, we meet, rant to each other, have ice cream, and I feel like there’s no real connection.”

“Don’t you think we are alike?” I giggled softly. “Even though you look like a social butterfly and I’m a wallflower I guess we have similar thoughts.”

“Both of our favorite books are *The Giving Tree*!” she added. 

“We both dated an older guy,” I joked. 

“We both like dogs, Tim Burton movies, and don’t like Marvel.”

“We also both can’t drive or swim. You’re also allergic to dust, and we are both neat. We both cook, too.”

“We prefer spicy food and love sushi.”

“We both have the same hair before you dyed it.” 

“We look alike!” 

“No way, you’re so pretty,” I argued. 

“No, we both are pretty!” Lana said. She grinned on my phone screen. “You’re like my twin.”

My smiled lagged and I said something, I forgot what. “No way?” “Really?” “Kind of?” I said something and the words made me feel a funny sort of way, like if I was, then why? 

Why did he choose you, why did you have a better personality, why was I feeling this way? 

“That’s why if we ever want to talk to someone or reach out, promise you’ll reach out to me,” she said. 

“Same to you.” 

Little did I know soon, I would really need her soon. 

At this time a strange pandemic came, it was far away at first and the United States wasn’t affected. We watched on the news as people became progressively weaker and soon aged years in only days, and the number grew. 

Once it spread here, science had determined it was fatal and there was no cure. People who had the disease were quarantined and that was the most we could do. People who suddenly fainted or even tripped over their own feet were suspected and kept in quarantine. 

I saw my mother fall down the stairs one day and I had no place to go but Lana’s. 

Lana had moved back with her mother after her mother divorced her husband. Her mom allowed me to stay with them as she vaguely saw me during the two years Lana stayed with me. She called me Angel and I called her Giselle. 


*I love you, Lana*


Their house was small but cute, and while mom was quarantined I called her on her phone. It seemed like it was progressively getting worse. Soon her nurse had to navigate her phone to call me. Mom gave me her passwords to her phone and later began to mutter so low I could only not hear. It took a week before she passed to Covid. 

At this time Lana seemed afraid of telling me her life’s updates to the point that when I caught her, smiling, she would immediately wipe it off her face and look at me with her serious face. I know she was texting someone, maybe even seeing them, so I finally asked about it. It was our mutual friend from college, and she admitted they bumped into each other at the car dealership and they’ve been hanging out for a while. 

I was quiet and Lana no longer spoke about it, but she began to cough. 

Covid. 

Gisselle quickly got her tested and quarantined her to the attic before she tested positive and she called the ambulance. Lana was young and had God’s blessings obviously, so I wasn’t afraid. Gisselle too, began to sigh about her daughter’s karma, because she kept hanging out with some guy she was texting. I didn’t care.

When the doctors called us in we were confused. They told us to keep it under wraps and we signed contracts- they told us this was a government approved experiment due to the deaths to the pandemic. They were able to save her consciousness, but her body was losing, slowly, they added, because she was younger. 

They explained they didn’t often have this luck with such a healthy patient that had their consciousness awake. They asked if there was anyone who would be her vessel. 

Gisselle looked at me, and held my shoulder. Her eyes were pleading me, but when my mom died, did she mourn? I looked at her face and then in the glad behind her, saw my face vaguely reflected. 

Who would mourn me, though? 

I asked the doctors what would happen to my consciousness. 

“That’s something you don’t have to worry about. You control your body a hundred percent. All her consciousness can do is be in you. Namely, only you can hear her.” 

I wanted to hear her call me Angel. I wanted to hear her laughter and witty remarks. I agreed. 

Gisselle hugged me, crying and stroking my hair as though I were Lana. 

The days after the surgery I began to hear Lana’s voice. It hadn’t hurt at all, and the doctors wanted me to follow up every week until they released the news. But that wasn’t what I was so hungry for. 

The day I heard Lana speak I was so happy. I entertained her. I met up with her guy and said Lana was inside me. Answered everything. Did just as she told me, thoughts merging. 

But oh, trust me, Angel is no angel. 

Did you really think I was that pathetic? 

When Lana was there one night, we sat at the vanity table with the lamp on. She asked if we were sleeping soon. 

“Hey look, Lana,” I said. “Whatever is mine is also yours.”

*It means the world to me. You are literally my savior.*

“Yeah, you’re like my twin.” I said. 

*I love you, Angel. Really.*

“I love you, Lana.” I smiled and our face was so pretty, eyes so bright and skin so pretty. 

*What are you holding?*

“What do you think?” I asked, laughing, then slowly lifting my hand with the box cutter. “We should do everything together, and experience the same things, right? We are one.” 

*No, no! Mom! Call my mom! Stop it! No! Angel, what’s wrong with you?*

I dragged it across our face and our screams merged as I stabbed into our left eye. 

*It hurts! Stop it! I can fall asleep, it’s hurts, don’t do this! You can fall asleep but I can’t! It hurts! I’ll be suffering alone!*

“We will suffer together!” 

I slashed our face four times by that point. She is crying and screaming. I writhed on the floor, unable to scream as my mouth was slit. It hurt. 

But as least Lana will be with me through the pain now.
