I am writing this so people stay away. Please keep away from the abandoned white house with the beautiful garden. 


If you make the mistake of finding this place and entering, you might not be as lucky as I was. 


The bunch of us are homeless vagrants, hobos, whatever you'd like to call us. We drift without a destination in sight. It's a hard lifestyle, but everyone has their reasons for why they end up like this.


We're a group of six: Dawg, an on-and-off drug addict; Tim, a military vet; Emma, a red-haired runaway who ran from home when she was 17; Dean and Sarah, a couple that have been together for 10 years; and myself.


I got kicked out of my home for laziness and lack of motivation at 18, and I had it rough until I met this group.


Our lineup is pretty consistent, but sometimes we get other people that tag along for a while but disappear in the mornings, never to be seen again.


We found this house. Its paint was cracked with time, and its windows were very dirty, but overall it looked nice for being abandoned. 


"Ooh, she's pretty! We can get a good night's rest here," Dawg exclaimed. 


He approached the house, and we immediately looked out for cops, but we were very far out on the outskirts of town, so the night was exceedingly isolated. 


Dawg whistled to us with his bucked teeth; he was very good at picking locks. We ran into the house. 


I whispered to him, "That's the fastest lock you've picked, old man. Good job!" 


Dawg shook his head. "I ain't done nothing this time, boy; the door was already open." 


Sarah piped up, "We're in luck today." It lured us in; we just didn't know at that moment. 


We decided to explore some, trying to scavenge for food. Emma had joined me. We didn't find any food, so we started digging in the rooms. 


"Sam, look at this!" Emma called me from a room down the hall. 


I walked into what looked like an art studio. The thick smell of paint still hung in the stale air even after its years of neglect. 


Emma signaled me over to a stack of canvases. "Look, they're all the same." 


The canvases portrayed a woman surrounded by flowers. It was charming how the colors danced with the lady on the painting, but it was bizarre how they were all exact replicas, robotically made to be the same. 


"Let's go; there is nothing here for us." 


We joined Tim and Dawg, who were drinking water. They also didn't find anything; that place was barren other than the weird paintings we had found. 


Dean and Sarah called us from the back of the house. We went outside to be embraced by the view of a sea of flowers, colors varying from purples to yellows and blues.


The aroma the flowers emitted was deliciously intoxicating; the moonlight illuminated the delicate petals. 


"Let's sleep out here tonight," I said. 


Everyone was still in awe, but Dean answered, "Good idea; this beats the hardwood floor." 


He layed down among the flowers, and Sarah knelt beside him. We all proceeded as well; our bodies relaxed to the soft ground. We were used to concrete and homeless shelter floors, so it felt like paradise.


I looked at the stars; the astral bodies dazzled me. My eyelids got heavy. That was the last time I was truly at peace.


I woke up to someone shoving me violently. 


"Wake up, Sam! Wake up!" It was Tim; his voice sounded desperate. 


I tried to shake off the morning grogginess. "What's wrong?" 


"Dean and Sarah are gone, and their stuff is still here."


I stood up, looking around; everything seemed off. The flowers looked thicker, and the aroma was stronger, tainted by a metallic tinge. 


I could hear the group calling their names from within the house. My eyes were drawn to where the couple slept together the previous night. The flowers were especially overgrown in that spot. 


I kneeled down by the area; the smell was overpowering and making me dizzy. I stuck my hands into the abundant foliage, and my hands touched a sticky substance. I recoiled; there was blood on my hands. 


I heard Emma scream; the group had come back outside. 


"What the fuck is that?" Tim yelled, his voice cracking at the sight. 


I couldn't stop staring at my hands. "I don't know, but we need to get the hell out of here!"


We rushed to leave the way we came. When we opened the front door, the front yard was there but surrounded by a wall of flowers. Then, we tried the backyard; we were caged in like animals.


Dawg attempted to climb the wall of flowers by grabbing onto the vines that held the flowers. They started growing around him. Tim and I pulled him off before he was overtaken. 


"What is going on?" Emma whispered to herself; she was trembling. 


We all were covered in sweat, and everything felt unreal. 


"Let's just push through the flowers; we can rip them as we go!" Dawg spoke with desperation.


"No! We don't even know if we'll make it through. Something happened to Dean and Sarah, and it could happen to us as well!" Tim answered him with authority. 


We went back inside the house; confusion and fear were plaguing us, and it got worse once we explored the house thoroughly. 


We rummaged through the house trying to find a way out; all we found was a basement door. The basement was ravaged by the fragrance of the flowers. 


We walked down the creaky staircase of the basement; sunlight leaked through the basement windows, showing us how big the subterranean room was. 


Halfway down the stairs, we saw it: a tall statue of a woman, just like the paintings upstairs. It was covered in the flowers from the backyard, all fresh and blooming with life. 


The anthophilic statue was imposing itself because in front of it were dozens of canvas stands. Some of the canvases were blank, and others were fully painted, all of them facing the statue. 


The sick bastards who lived here before worshipped the flowers. We left the basement wordlessly. We were dealing with the lucid fact that we were trapped, and there wasn't any apparent way to escape.


The incoming night filled us with dread. We were low on food from the start; we were hungry and dead on our feet. 


It did not help that the damn aroma was so strong. Even with the doors closed, it penetrated through as if it were excited to have us here. 


Dawg offered the last Snickers bar to Emma; she protested against the gesture. 


"You need it more. I can handle the hunger for much longer." 


"It's all right; I have lived off weird stuff, and those flowers don't look too bad,"
Dawg answered proudly. 


"You are not really thinking about eating those flowers, are you?" Tim said incredulously. 


Dawg smiled at him crookedly. "You know it," 


I spoke up before Tim yelled at him. "Dawg, that's a terrible idea. We don't know what these things truly are." 


Tim and Dawg had a tendency to argue like an old divorced couple; we always had to intervene. 


"We've had to stop you from eating rat poison food, you old coot," Tim said. He had calmed down a bit. 


Emma giggled. "He does have a strong stomach." 


The banter quelled our fear, but what happened that night returned us to our insane reality. 


Dawg mumbled, "Fine," and distracted himself with his backpack. 


Then the night arrived. We had decided that at least one of us had to stay awake to keep watch. We took turns. During my watch, I noticed how still the night was: no crickets, no birds, just dead unadulterated silence.


It was Dawg's turn to keep watch. I woke him up; he was drowsy but conscious enough to keep lookout. 


Laying down, I saw Tim's eyes gleaming; he was keeping an eye on Dawg. I didn't blame him; I would have as well, knowing what was going to happen. I was awakened by the sound of Tim's angry bellow. 


"God damn it, Dawg!" 


I sat up immediately. "What's going on?" 


"Dawg is outside." 


We found Dawg standing in the middle of the yard, facing away from us, staring up at the moon. The flowers were starting to crawl up his pant leg. 


"Dawg, what the fuck are you doing? Get your ass back over here!" we yelled at him. 


He didn't utter a single word; he just turned to us and we realized flowers were growing out of his eyes and mouth. 


The vines were curling from within him; they were coming out of his pores and orifices, entangling throughout his skin like stitches. Multiple flowers were protruding from his mouth; he was being suffocated by the blossoms. 


The predacious flower buds bloomed at an unnatural pace. Emma and I ran towards him. The flowers were starting to pull him down. 


By the time we got to him, only the top of his head was visible. 


"No, no, no!" we said urgently, but our efforts were fruitless. 


Dawg was devoured by the ground. Then a spring of flower miasma mixed with the pungent smell of blood invaded the air around us. Red pollen peppered our faces, mixing itself with our tears; we couldn't save him. 


He was gone. 


Back inside the house, Emma was crying incessantly. My body felt numb; warm, red-tinted tears dripped from my eyes. Dawg's flower-ridden face was engraved in my mind. Dawg was the closest thing we had to a father. 


"I fell asleep! Damn it! I knew he was going out there. I could have stopped him," Tim said defeated. 


The silence ate at us; no one slept after that. We just stared at each other while we listened to the silent cry of ecstasy the flowers were releasing after consuming Dawg's flesh.


"Let's burn it," Tim's rough voice killed the morning reflection. "It's the only way I can think of getting out."


The idea of burning that place down was more than a pleasant thought; it was a desire. The need to make sense of my friends' deaths conceptualized the image of this place being razed by hungry flames in my desolate mind. 


We put the plan into action, scrounging the house for the materials we needed to perform the act of arson that would aid us in our release. 


We stacked the flowery canvases in the front yard as our fuel. We had some leftover lighter fluid; all we needed was a match or a lighter to start the fire. 


Emma nor I were smokers; Tim was, but Vietnam messed his lungs up, so he quit. 


"Agent Orange did a number on my lungs. I got lucky; I was one of the few who didn't get lung cancer," he told me long ago.


Only Dawg's backpack was left; we had found what we required how poetic. 


"Okay, I'm going to set the flowers ablaze while you two run to climb the wall as fast as possible," Tim whispered. 


"What about you?" Emma asked, worried. 


"I will catch up," he said firmly, leaving no room for argument. 


We nodded, our hearts beating excessively in anticipation. Tim held the matches poised, ready; he watched us as we moved into position. 


The disgusting pollen of the carnivorous flowers was now visible in the air, red and spreading. When we were inches from the wall of flowers, Tim yelled, 


"Now!" 


We sprinted to climb. The overconfident flowers had ignored us, like a cat playing with its prey; it was caught off guard by our retaliation. 


The flowers pulled at our shoes. We both lost our shoes climbing. 


"Climb!" I yelled at Emma. 


Because I heard a wretched sound that tore at the sky above, and from the corner of my eye, I saw Tim's arm flung like a rag doll to the ground. 


I was almost at the top when I turned to check on Emma. I wish I had not. Emma was being dragged down; the vines were piercing through her skin, undoing her limbs. It twisted her arms and legs until her joints popped out; then it beheaded her. She managed a strangled cry before she lost her head. 


I scaled the final stretch eagerly and jumped off that tall wall of flora. My landing was not majestic; the pain was searing. The concrete welcomed my body with a crunch, but I ignored it all.


I crawled away; I writhed my way far from those voracious vines. I have recovered now body-wise, but my mind is broken. 


I moved away from that town and got a job. I managed to rent a small apartment. The streets don't feel right anymore. 


All I have left are my memories, that are now buried under the maw of those flowers. That place uses death to give birth to beauty, a deadly enticing beauty. I escaped, but it feels as if I have been digested there. I'm still rotting. 


Writing this is the closest thing to a moment of respite that I've had in a while, so please heed my warning: stay away.
