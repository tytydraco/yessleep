Good morning ! 
Let me introduce myself, my name is Lise, I am 21 years old and I live in France. I experienced a lot of “paranormal” things that shook my childhood/adolescence which always raised questions for me. I will tell you my story in detail.

BEFORE YOU START: You should know that I have a theory that I will say at the end of my story :) and sorry for the spelling..

I was then 5 years old / 6 years old I would say, at that time I lived in a two-story house with my parents who slept on the first floor and my sister on the top floor, I was on the first floor with my parents.
One evening while I was falling asleep peacefully without light, I suddenly woke up and felt a monstrously great fear, I was very hot, I was sweating enormously, while there was no sound, none of that, I put myself so my blanket over my face leaving just my nose sticking out. I felt like I was being watched at the edge of my bed as if someone or something was watching me.
The evenings passed and every night I felt the same thing, it lasted about a few minutes before going back to sleep after my big scare.
One evening I took my courage during yet another fear, to look at the ground to see if there was something and that I was not dreaming, there was something, someone was good there.
What I saw? Large, slightly round shoes facing my bed, men's shoes, in any case I felt they were a man.
After seeing these shoes the following nights I heard the man come to my bed walking, I felt him look at me then slowly leave, when he left again I fell asleep immediately.
I then asked my parents if they came to see me at night, they told me no.
My mother is a strong believer in the paranormal unlike my father who is very philosophical; She experienced things herself.
So I talked to her about it a few years later before moving, she advised me to talk to this man which I couldn't do because of the thrill of fear it caused me. After discussing this with an adult I found myself upside down in my bed wrapped in my duvet I was screaming for my mother to come and save me because I didn't know where I was, my mother never was also afraid.


We then moved to a small house with my father and my mother, my room being near my parents as usual, this reassured me so much... I was now 12 years old.
I then fell asleep the first night in my new room everything went well, but I always slept with my light on and my duvet on my face leaving my nose protruding (in summer as in winter)
One evening I heard someone say my name slowly like a whisper "Liise..." then I immediately hid under my blanket because I was playing my DS in secret I thought it was my father at first, then I heard even louder
 “READ!” I was sweating like every other year.


Nothing happened after a few years but I was still so stressed at night. 
Time passed and the more things I felt in this house when I was alone, I felt observed as soon as I turned my head I saw black shadows suddenly disappear. 
I had a staircase that went up to the small floor of the house; I almost never went up there because I felt something at the top of it.
But I was going up there to play video games!

So I played video games at night because I was so afraid of falling asleep. But I had to sleep one day so I fell asleep on the bed that was upstairs with the television on to reassure me I was around 15 years old.
Then I felt the same sensation again and someone calling me very loudly “READ SHUUUT!” so I woke up I hadn't slept all night because of fear, I then slept all day.

Sometimes I saw things like a very bright light on the wall in front of my bed that I had taken a photo of for my mother when my parents went on vacation (I no longer have this photo unfortunately)
I approached the light because over time I finally got used to it, the light remained then, I touched it, it was warm and... reassuring.

So when I was alone I would talk to these things: “Where are you?” “Are you okay today?”...

Sometimes at night I felt someone caressing my back, it was quite disturbing but in truth I felt very good.
When I was playing with my figures a few times they would jump from my bed onto the floor in front of my eyes.

Also I had found a branch that strangely resembled a tree of life which I put in the trash under the advice of a lady who had come to my house who smelled the spirits, read the cards, you see what.
My mom wanted to know more about why I felt all this. This lady then revealed that the spirit of a lady lived in this house: the former owner. But she never talked about a man, when she came into my room she had a wave of fear. I often left my shutters closed because I was too lazy to open them... she told me that evil spirits were stored in my room which sent a chill down my spine...




Now I live in an apartment with my partner! I'm 21 years old! and... I wasn't finished...

I hear a voice from time to time which gives me short sentences:
I was getting out of the shower when I heard: “Are you okay, darling?” 
I then jumped up and shouted to my partner who was downstairs if he had called me "No, I didn't call you at all, I'm peeling the zucchini for this evening"...
The last time I heard a voice was when I was on the sofa in my living room listening to a Feldup video (good atmosphere) I then heard: 
“SHUT UP!”
I then turn off my phone in the middle of the day and I end up shouting: 

LEAVE ME ALONE!

Since that day nothing more... I sometimes feel strange things also I see black masses I even bought books on the paranormal! 
I also started doing cartomancy, I draw cards for my loved ones which troubles them because I discover things about them... 

So who was this man all this time? My grandfather died when I was 5, I assumed it was him, my mother confided that it was him from the beginning. My darling is not a trivial nickname..

If you have any questions or ideas, tell me everything!
