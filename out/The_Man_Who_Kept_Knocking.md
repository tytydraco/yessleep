I’m not writing this for attention. I’m writing it because my hands won’t stop shaking at 1:30 a.m., and because every night that passes makes the details slide around in my head like oil on glass. If I don’t put it somewhere, I’ll start doubting what I heard and saw. And I can’t afford to doubt it, not with how precise he is.

I live alone in a one-bedroom on the third floor of a brick building that used to be a hotel in the 60s. The hallway carpet still has that faded pattern of red paisley that never really looks clean no matter how many times the super runs a shampooer over it. My door is the fourth on the right after the stairs. It’s got a newer knob and a deadbolt, but the frame is old wood and the peephole sits just a little too low, like it was drilled by someone guessing.

The first time he knocked was a Thursday, a little after one in the morning. I was half-asleep on the couch with a true-crime documentary playing on my laptop. The knock wasn’t frantic. It was patient: three even taps, like a teacher asking a classroom to quiet down. Tap… tap… tap. Then nothing.

I waited for whoever it was to either knock again or say who they were. When neither happened, I went to the door and looked through the peephole. The hallway was empty, just the emergency light making that cold cone on the carpet. I almost laughed at myself. I’ve got neighbors who have parties at weird hours; sound bounces around that stairwell and does strange things.

I turned off the laptop and went to bed. At 2:34 I woke up because I’d dreamed the same three taps. When I lay still, listening to the building hum, I heard them again. Tap… tap… tap. I sat up, heart going like I’d run stairs. I didn’t look through the peephole that time. I told myself if I didn’t engage, whoever it was would get bored. The tapping didn’t come back.

On Friday it happened again, 1:30 a.m., the same three even knocks. I checked the peephole. Nothing. I messaged the building group chat to ask if anyone was having someone over who might be confused about the floor. No replies, just a thumbs-up from a guy on two who’s always drunk and thinks everything is hilarious.

Saturday night I made coffee at eleven and decided to wait it out. I’d prove to myself it was just pipes or heat expansion or something physical that my brain was turning into a pattern. At 1:33, as if I’d set an alarm I didn’t know about, I heard it again. Tap… tap… tap.

This time I slid to the door in my socks and looked through the peephole immediately, trying to catch whoever was moving away. Someone was there.

He was tall and thin, wearing a long dark coat that looked too heavy for late spring. He stood perfectly still, facing my door, head tilted like he was listening to the wood. I couldn’t make out details of his face. The emergency light hit him from the back and flattened everything.

I was about to say something when he lifted his left hand. He held it at shoulder height and moved his index finger in a slow circle, then drew three short lines in the air, one after another. It wasn’t a knock gesture. It was like he was writing on invisible glass. After the third line, he put his hand down and stayed there, motionless.

“Can I help you?” My voice sounded smaller than I meant it to.

No response. He didn’t even twitch.

“Wrong apartment,” I tried. “You’ve got the wrong door.”

He stayed another few seconds, then turned without hurry and walked toward the stairs. I watched him until he disappeared. The quiet after he left felt like the moment when a dentist takes their hand out of your mouth and your tongue is suddenly this strange muscle you don’t know what to do with. I realized I was holding the door frame so hard my fingers hurt.

I called the non-emergency police line and explained. The operator was patient. She said she’d send a car through, but unless he was forcing entry or making threats, there wasn’t much they could do. I know how that sounds online: “the cops didn’t care.” It wasn’t like that. They cared. It’s just that standing in a hallway is not a crime, no matter how much your stomach flips over it.

Sunday I bought a door security bar—the kind that braces under the knob—and one of those wedges you kick under the door. I told myself I’d sleep better. I also covered the peephole with a strip of electrical tape after reading an article about reverse peephole viewers. I’d never thought about that before: that from the hall, with the right little lens, someone could see you as if the hole was a window.

Sunday night the knocks came at 1:27. Three, even. I didn’t look. I sat on the floor in the dark kitchen with a butter knife in my hand and felt exactly like a kid hiding from a game where the rules were unclear.

Monday afternoon I caught the super, Manny, in the basement by the washers and told him. He’s in his fifties, soft-spoken, reads the paper in a lawn chair out back when the weather’s decent.

“You get a look at his face?” he asked.

“No. Just the coat, the height. The way he moved his hand. Like…” I made the small circles with my finger and felt stupid copying someone else’s gesture.

Manny didn’t laugh. He took a folded piece of masking tape from his pocket and put it over the peephole, smoothing the edges. “Don’t take that off,” he said. “People do weird things. You call me next time.”

That night I messaged a friend, Jonah, and asked if he’d stay over. He brought a sleeping bag and a baseball bat and told me if the guy knocked, we’d open the door and ask him what the hell his problem was. At 1:24, the tapping started. We were both awake. Jonah stood up, bat in hand. I put a hand on his arm and shook my head. We waited, not breathing. The taps didn’t come again. Jonah stayed until three, making jokes about how I’d made him miss his bedtime for a ghost with good manners.

Tuesday afternoon there were three small chalk marks on my door frame at shoulder height. Pale, like someone had brushed a carpenter’s pencil there and then wiped it partially away. I ran a paper towel over them. The towel came back gray. I know what you’re thinking: I could’ve missed those since I don’t inspect my door frame every day. You’re right. I don’t. But I’d cleaned around the knob when I put the tape on the peephole. They weren’t there then.

I set my phone to record audio that night. I put it on a chair by the door and turned on airplane mode so nothing would cut the recording. I shut off all the lights, wedged the door, braced the bar, and tried to breathe like I wasn’t listening with every atom of my body.

At 1:19 I heard footsteps on the recording, precise and slow. They paused. The mic picked up the faintest rasp—fabric against wood? Then: tap… tap… tap. After ten seconds, three taps again, lighter. Then a whisper. The whisper was so soft I had to max the volume and press the phone to my ear to make words out of it. I could be wrong. But I swear I heard: “You’re there.”

I sent the file to Jonah and to Manny. I called the police again and played part of it over the phone. This time, two officers came by, walked the halls, and knocked on my neighbors’ doors, waking a couple people who were understandably annoyed. They didn’t find anyone in the building who matched my description. They suggested I get a simple motion camera and pointed me to a model that stores clips locally.

I bought two the next morning. One facing the door from the inside, one covering the living room and kitchen. I know that sounds paranoid, but the price of not knowing what happens between midnight and two was higher than a couple plastic cameras and a microSD card. I also bought a cheap doorbell camera for the outside, but since it’s an interior hallway and not my property, I didn’t install it. I was trying not to be that tenant everyone resents.

Wednesday the knocking came at 1:07. Three knocks. Then three lighter. Then nothing. The interior camera caught the sound perfectly and caught me standing perfectly still in my hallway with a ridiculous knife in my hand. Manny texted at 1:10: “Police on the way. Don’t open.” They came, went floor to floor, checked the stairwell. One officer asked if he could sit inside my apartment in the dark for a few nights and wait with me. He wasn’t promising anything; he just said, “Sometimes people like this escalate. Better we see it.”

He sat with me Thursday night. He told me to call him T. He was maybe mid-thirties, built like he actually did the gym memberships the station gets, and he spoke quietly in the way people do when they’ve done a lot of night shifts. We sat on my floor with the lights off and whispered about unrelated things so I’d keep breathing. At 12:58 he touched my arm to still me. I heard it too: a soft scuff outside, like a shoe toe against carpet. Then his head tilted. He took out his phone and typed something quickly to whoever was parked on the street. The three taps came at exactly 1:00.

T didn’t move toward the door. He looked at the peephole and then at me, at the strip of black tape I’d left over it. He stood and pressed his palm flat to the door, then took it away and showed me his hand. There were three faint gray lines on his skin.

“Chalk,” he mouthed.

The taps didn’t come again that night. At 1:15 T’s phone buzzed. He checked it and whispered: “No one on the stairs, no one on camera at the entrance. If he’s in the building, he tailgated and is staying out of view.” He left around two. Before he went, he looked at my deadbolt. “You need longer screws in your strike plate,” he said. “Those half-inch ones don’t grab. Get three-inch. Into the stud.”

I spent Friday with a screwdriver and YouTube. Longer screws, a secondary slide lock at the top, a little adhesive alarm that would shriek if the door moved while armed. I covered the gap at the bottom with a heavier draft stopper. It looked ridiculous. It also let me close my eyes for more than fifteen seconds without my heart sprinting.

Friday night there was no knock. Saturday, none. I started to relax in the way you do after a fever breaks. I left the bathroom light on, fell asleep at midnight. And woke at 1:33 to my phone buzzing. Unknown device detected moving with you. I sat up so fast I smacked my head on the wall. The phone showed the pop-up Apple gives you when it feels an AirTag you don’t own traveling with you.

I don’t own an AirTag.

I hit “Play Sound” the way the notification tells you to. A faint little chime came from the hallway—no, not the hallway. The chime came from inside my apartment, somewhere near the door. I turned on every light. The chime played again. I traced it to my coat hanging on a hook by the door. In the inner pocket, tucked into the lining, there was a small white circle the size of a coin.

I have never bought one. I don’t let friends hang coats here. I don’t even remember when I last wore that coat. I stood there too long with it in my hand, like if I crushed it the problem would be over. I didn’t crush it. I followed the instructions, disabled it, photographed it, emailed myself the serial.

At 1:40, three taps on the door. Not loud. Deliberate. I stood a foot back from the door and said, “I’m calling the police.”

The whisper came, so soft I wasn’t sure it was a voice: “I know.”

I called. T came with another officer. They took the AirTag. They took my statement. They were careful not to promise more than they could do. T said he’d push for a warrant for the owner information. He said, “If he’s dumb enough to register it in his own name, he’s dumb enough to make a mistake. Keep everything in writing. Don’t engage.”

The next morning, I was packing a bag. I’d decided to stay at Jonah’s for a while. The apartment felt wrong. That’s not a legal term or a useful descriptor, but it is the best I have. It felt like I had already been entered and cataloged, like a drawer someone had measured and closed again.

I took down the strip of tape over the peephole to check the lens for scratches. The tape was thicker than it looked. Manny had folded it in on itself to make it easy to peel. When I pulled it free, something fell with it—something tiny and silver, stuck to the adhesive. I bent to pick it up and realized I was holding a piece of polished metal no larger than my thumbnail: a peephole reverser. The kind you press to the lens to see inside. This one was the other half—flat, designed to stick to the door and act as an anchor for a magnetized viewer.

There was a faint ring around the peephole where someone had glued, then pulled off, something. I don’t know when he did it. Maybe the first night, when I opened the door and saw nothing and stepped forward into the hall for two seconds. Maybe the second. The idea that it had been there while I had spoken, while I had pressed my own eye to the lens—my stomach turned hard enough I had to put my hands on my knees.

I left. I took the cameras, the laptop, a duffel of clothes, and left. On my way out I saw three fresh gray marks at the height of my shoulder on the other side of the door frame. I didn’t wipe them.

Jonah’s place is a fourth-floor walk-up across town. He gave me the couch and made dumb jokes and ordered too much takeout. I wanted to be grateful. Mostly I listened for footsteps in the hall that never came. We put my door camera up facing his apartment entrance as a joke. It felt important once it was there.

Sunday afternoon T called. He said, careful and official, that they’d requested owner information tied to the AirTag serial. He also said that if I was leaving the apartment, I should let the super know, because if the person was targeting me specifically, they might follow. “Don’t post about it,” he said. “People escalate when you make them characters.”

I didn’t post. I didn’t tell the building group chat, either. I wanted to believe that changing location breaks a pattern.

That night, at 1:33, the camera by Jonah’s door recorded three even taps. You can see Jonah sit up in his sleeping bag on the floor in the living room and look at me on the couch. You can see us freeze. The knocks don’t come again. Ten minutes later, the camera records a single frame of motion: a dark shape too close to the lens to resolve. The motion sensor triggers an eight-second clip, but the frame after the first one is just the empty hall. Whatever passed in front of it did so almost against the lens.

We didn’t open the door. We didn’t sleep. At 4:20 the camera recorded something else: a folded piece of paper pushed under the door from outside with a stiff business card. On the paper, printed in neat block letters: YOU’RE DOING THIS WELL. THANK YOU.

T took the note. He dusted it. He told us, “Don’t respond. Don’t reward.” He said the note might be evidence of harassment. He said he’d ask for the building’s exterior cameras. He didn’t have good news. The exterior cams are fake; the landlord put up domes to deter package thieves and never wired them.

On Tuesday afternoon, Jonah went to work and I took a shower. When I came out, my phone had that same notification: Unknown device detected moving with you. I swore out loud, followed the chime, and found the AirTag in my backpack’s front pocket. The backpack had been in Jonah’s entry closet since I arrived.

We tore the closet apart. There was a hairline scratch around the inside of the knob plate so fine I would never have noticed it if I weren’t inches from it. Jonah hadn’t given anyone else a key. He swore he hadn’t. We believe him. I believe him. It doesn’t matter. The scratch is there. This man has a method for getting into places quietly, swiftly, and leaving no sign the casual eye would catch. Or he has a key for older knobs, or he’s very good with a pick. We changed the knob that night, because doing something felt like the only way to breathe.

Wednesday I went back to my apartment in daylight with Manny and two officers. We went through my stuff. Manny showed me the hinge pins on my door. You can tap them out from the hallway on older frames even if the door swings inward. Manny replaced them with security pins in fifteen minutes using parts he had in a plastic organizer. He said, almost apologetic, “Should’ve done these already.”

One of the officers, a woman with eyes that seemed to notice everything, pointed at the baseboard heater and then at a tiny hole drilled in the wall above it, at ankle level, behind where my shoe rack used to sit. The hole was the width of a drinking straw. There was nothing in it when she probed with a swab. She looked at me and didn’t say anything at first. Then: “You live alone. You keep your blinds shut. Someone wanted a vantage you wouldn’t think to cover.”

That night I slept at a motel with the security bar flipped over the knob and a chair under the handle because that’s what you do when you’ve run out of locks to buy. A family on the other side of the wall watched a show at a volume that would have driven me crazy any other week. The noise made me feel like there were witnesses. At 1:33 exactly, there were three taps on my door. That even, patient rhythm. I lay on the bed and looked at the ceiling and cried without sound like a dog who knows whimpering gets him smacked.

At 1:40 a folded piece of paper slid under the door and stopped against the rubber threshold. The paper was hotel stationary. I didn’t move. I waited for an hour and then opened the door to a hallway that was normal in the way a set is normal when you step behind it and it’s just plywood. I picked up the paper. YOU LEARN FAST.

The front desk had cameras. Real ones. The night manager showed the police the footage. At 1:21 a man in a baseball cap checked in with a card that processed. He carried no luggage. He walked to a room two doors down from mine. At 1:32 he walked out of that room, turned to my door, stood with his head tilted, and did not knock. The camera doesn’t have audio. After forty seconds he turned around and walked back to his room. At 3:10 he left without checking out. The card was prepaid and untraceable. The name was fake.

I moved in with a cousin an hour out of the city after that. I stopped going to my apartment except in the daytime with someone else. Manny sublet it to a student two months later. I didn’t want the deposit back. I didn’t want to stand in that hallway with the paisley carpet and explain why the strike plate had four giant screws.

There are things I could add that would make this sound like a story. I could tell you that two weeks later an apartment across the river was broken into at 1:30 a.m. and the woman who lived there woke up with someone standing in her doorway. That’s true. I could tell you that she described three light taps on her door in the nights before it happened. Also true. I could tell you that I got an email from an account with no name containing a single attachment: an eight-second clip of my living room from the angle of the peephole, me standing inside with a knife, my mouth moving as I asked through the door, “Can I help you?” That happened too. The file metadata was wiped. The email auto-deleted the day after I opened it.

T still texts sometimes. He checks in like a friend. He keeps it professional, reminds me not to post identifying details, not to tell a version that turns this man into a myth. “They read,” he told me once. “They get better.” He says they might have enough to get a warrant if the AirTag owner information connects to a human with an address. He doesn’t promise. I asked what he thinks the hand gesture meant—that slow circle, the three little lines. He stared at me a second and said, “Counting his nights. Or counting yours.”

I’ve bought things I never thought I’d own: a simple alarm system, two real door bars, window pins, a wedge that will break your foot if you kick it wrong. I sleep with my shoes by the bed and my wallet in my jeans pocket on the chair, because T said if you have to run, you should have your ID and keys. My cousin pretends to be annoyed at the extra deadbolt I paid to have installed on her door. When she goes to work, I check her peephole twice. There’s a piece of tape over it. Blue painter’s tape. I replace it every few days, like a ritual.

Sometimes, when I’m standing in her kitchen pouring coffee, I practice not reacting to imagined sounds. I count to three and make myself set the cup down and pick it up again, like I am rehearsing a movement the way he rehearsed his. Some days I hate that. Some days it makes me feel like I’m not only being acted upon.

If you live in an older building with a door that is mostly wood and a peephole that isn’t beveled from the inside, put tape over it. Replace the screws in your strike plate with longer ones. Set your phone to notify you about AirTags. It won’t stop someone with patience, but it will at least make you feel like you are a participant in your own life.

I’m writing this tonight because it’s quiet where I am, and because two hours ago I got a text from an unknown number. Just a photo. The photo is a blurry shot of a motel hallway with paisley carpet and a numbered door with a chair wedged under the handle from the inside. My chair. The timestamp is from months ago. The caption says: THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME PRACTICE.

I don’t know if he means practice getting in, or practice not knocking, or practice making people like me into a set of predictable responses. Maybe all of it. Maybe the point was to see how much of my life he could occupy by doing almost nothing at all. Three taps. A mark on wood. A little piece of metal you’d miss unless you knew to look.

It’s 1:29 now. I can hear the refrigerator motor, the distant hiss of a car on the highway, my own heartbeat in my throat. I’m going to put my phone on the table by the door and start a recording. I’m going to stand back from the peephole with the tape still on it, and I’m going to breathe. If there are three taps, I’m not going to open the door. If there aren’t, I’m still not going to open it.

If you’re reading this and thinking I’m feeding him by writing it down, you’re probably right. If you’re reading it because you’ve heard something at your door around the same time every night and you needed to know you’re not the only one keeping track of seconds in the dark, then I’m writing it for you, too.

It’s 1:33. There it is again. Three even ones. Tap… tap… tap.

I don’t answer. I don’t move. I let the recording run. And even though my hands are shaking, I count my breaths and think about screws biting into studs, about tape over glass, about all the ways you can slowly teach yourself to stay very still while someone on the other side of a door teaches themselves something about you.
