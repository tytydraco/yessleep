Appreciated everyone's attention and patience last time, but I can't say I have much else nice to give you. Now for the rest of that night and Markus's story:

\*\*\*

"I figured that Mama wouldn’t be back until dawn, and by then, Ryder and I would have left the creek. I could sneak my dirty clothes into the laundry bucket without her noticing. I grabbed an old orange t-shirt and a dirty pair of sweatpants before pulling on my zip-up jacket and rubber rain boots. I placed one hand on the door before realizing that the winter night wasn’t going to offer any visibility. I grabbed a flashlight from our kitchen drawer and smacked it a couple times before I got it to switch on. Once the feeble light proved to still be working, I shoved it into my jacket pocket and made my way out. 

I stepped outside the trailer door and into the brisk night air. Ryder was standing a good distance away. He was wearing a wrinkled white t-shirt, holey sweatpants, and no shoes. There were red marks circling his neck that I could only see in the brief flash of light I shone on his body–marks that made me wince. I guessed that his dad was the same as always. A move didn’t change that man. 

Ryder was also holding the old paint bucket and lid that we always used to carry the little crustaceans in for my Grandma’s kitchen. ‘You’re not cold?’ I asked, shaking my head as I quietly closed the trailer door behind me.

“No,” His grin was infectious, and I was soon smiling with him. “Now c’mon, we ain’t got that much nighttime left.” 

Normally we would have sprinted down the hillside towards the creek bed, but with the darkness as it was, I was happy to just follow behind Ryder as he kept up a moderate pace. The top of the hill was flat, but the way down to the water was rocky and a bit uneven. I reached the edge as Ryder disappeared down the rock wall, climbing slowly but steadily. I put the flashlight under my arm as I began my descent. The rocks were cold and still sort of wet, which didn’t exactly help my tiny fingers. I had to dig into the dirt with my nails just to not collapse as I inched my way down towards the sound of the water. The flashlight’s light was measly, but enough that I could vaguely see my surroundings. 

When I looked down, Ryder was somehow already at the bottom of the hill, watching me with a blank expression. The small shock I got from seeing how far he’d gone nearly caused me to drop the flashlight. I pulled my arm closer to my body to keep it in place. ‘How…how did you…” I huffed, still struggling to maneuver down with the slippery rocks as my only touch points. ‘Dang, Ryder, did you fall?’ He cocked his head to the side, watching me struggle, but I don’t think he answered. 

After a few more moments, I let my impatience get the best of me and I unhooked myself from the wall. My boots hit the ground from about five feet up, a bolt of pain shooting through my ankles. I grimaced and tried to put on a brave face. 

Ryder was standing several feet away at the creek bed, but his back was turned. Despite the sound of the running water and where he was facing, I could still hear his voice as clear as day, slurred ‘s’ and all. ‘C’mon…the crawdads are all in there.’ He raised his arm without looking and pointed to the right where the wooded area sat.

In the darkness the trees were tall and menacing. We had never even touched that area before, my mother warning of ticks and other varmints that would give us diseases. She and my grandparents had also made it perfectly clear, time and time again, that they did not want us going in that forested area. It was one of their hard and fast rules that we hadn’t ever really thought of breaking. The one time one of our footballs ended up over the hill and in those trees, the two of us had just accepted it as a loss. 

Knowing all of this, my eyes bulged at him. ‘Are you crazy? Mama will whup my ass if she finds out we snuck in there this late.’

Ryder turned slowly. Even in the thick darkness of that cold farmland, where only an outline of him was really legible, I remember that I looked for the lights of his eyes to distinguish them on his face, but there was nothing there. His hair blew in the wind but his face was a pitch black slate. His posture was slack. His arm had fallen back to his side, dangling uselessly. I thought I could see his fingers twitching around the handle of the bucket. 

I froze on the spot, trembling for reasons I couldn’t then make sense of. I waited for him to say something, anything. I knew he was staring right at me, even if I still couldn’t find his eyes. 

I was half-tempted to shine the flashlight at his face when he suddenly started walking towards the woods. ‘...need your help, Markus.’ His voice was low. I could barely make out what he said at all. The back of his head and the upper part of his body were still. 

It took several seconds before I could close my mouth and start to walk after him. I was losing confidence in this whole trip, but the number of questions swarming around in my brain was enough to propel me forward. ‘Whaddya mean?’ I asked, yelling slightly so he would hear me. No matter how fast I walked, I just couldn’t reach him. The back of Ryder was always at least fifteen feet ahead. ‘This is a bad idea, and you still haven’t told me why you moved away.’

Ryder’s voice trailed behind him. I couldn’t believe he wasn’t stumbling over his own bare feet. ‘They’re all in here, Markus. They don’t come down from this part until it gets warm. It ain’t warm. We’ll find ‘em at the center where the creek heads off.’

Wintertime is already too damn dark, and the darkness that surrounded me that night was almost entirely impenetrable. It was as if the moon had been strangled by pure pitch. My pathetic little flashlight was the only thing making a dent in that shroud. I didn’t want to follow Ryder into that void, I shouldn’t have followed him into that void, but I found my boots moving anyway. I steeled myself for a tense walk as I ducked into the foliage. 

Even with my precautions, I was tripping over roots, twigs, and small patches of ice as we began our march into the woods. The creek ran rapidly and wide beside me, but when I shined my flashlight into the water, I couldn’t see anything but rocks and ice. I figured that Ryder was correct and we just needed to get deeper to find the little crustaceans. I didn’t want to be seen as a wimp, and so I coughed down my feelings of fear and reminded myself over and over that this wouldn’t take too long. 

The further we went, I kept my light on Ryder’s back and legs, following him as we ducked under branches. The trees hung low to the ground, almost as if they were dangling their own arms in our way. The third time I got smacked in the face by twigs they got into my mouth, and I sputtered and dropped my flashlight. We were already so far into the treeline that I couldn’t figure out which direction was which, but by the time I recovered and picked my light back up, Ryder was gone.

I swallowed the immediately blooming panic in my chest and called out: ‘Ryder!’

No reply. I swung around in multiple circles, calling his name over and over, trying to catch any glimpse of him, but there was nothing in the winter pitch. I couldn’t even see any footprints in the dirt ahead. No varmints scurried. No birds called. Only the creek’s running water would make its presence known. The trees hung uselessly around me, their leafless branches attempting to block out the sky. 

I was scared. I had no idea where I was. He had led me in a straight line, but the depth of the forest was indecipherable from a child’s viewpoint. All I had was the creek to go by, and in the darkness, it was easy to lose sight of your direction. I would have to turn and follow it straight, hoping that it would take me back to the hillside. My mind was racing to try to make sense of the situation as I considered my next move. Was this a prank? Had he done this to get back at me for something? I didn’t think it was very funny at all. 

I wanted to go back to the trailer. Mama would get mad at me if she caught me, but it was better than staying in that quiet blackness for even another second. At that moment I would have gladly risked an ass whupping. I walked up to the creek, and before I began to set my sights on leaving, I turned my head over my shoulder and yelled: ‘Ryder, I’m going home! This isn’t funny.’

What greeted me was a thud. 

It wasn’t loud and it wasn’t nearby, but amongst the forest’s silence, it may as well have been a clap of thunder in my ear. Every hair on my body stood up as I froze and began to listen.

THUD.

Deeper into the woods, in the other direction, the sound continued at an even pace. 

THUD.

It was heavy. It sounded like something was smacking against a wall. 

‘Ryder?’ I wanted to shout, but my voice came out as a miserable squeak. I pointed the flashlight all along where I thought the sound was coming from, but I couldn’t see anything except ice and trees. 

*THUD.*

The thudding sound ceased after that final bang. It produced the same jolt in me as if someone had slammed a car door, or dropped a bowling ball from several feet up. It wasn’t too much longer before that static sound was replaced by something else. Unlike the thud, it was softer. I tried to still my heartbeat and listen, and right when I began to think I was just hallucinating, it grew in sound. 

It was crying. The soft but unmistakable sound of a child crying echoed in the distance. It wasn’t a screaming tantrum, but an agonizing weep that did not stop. From where I was standing, I got the sense that I was very close, and there was a familiarity to the cry that made my heart sink. ‘Ryder?’ I tried again, actually managing a yell this time, but the crier didn’t even flinch, and they didn’t stop. 

I couldn’t go home. Ryder was still out here. He had probably fallen and really hurt himself, maybe while looking for me. I stood frozen for several more seconds before gripping the handle of the flashlight and taking a deep breath to calm myself. I walked forward slowly, trying to get closer to the sound of crying. My pace was snail-like, and even as my heart began to pound faster and faster, I was determined to find my friend. I don’t know if I was walking for minutes or even hours, ducking under branches and blinking to try to find any sense of shape or color in that void, but eventually…eventually I came upon another hill.” 

At that point, Markus was sobbing in his chair. He hiccupped, barely able to speak. I honored his word and didn’t dare interrupt the story. When he was able to continue, his voice returned in a choking whisper that I had to lean forward to even hear. 

“I stopped at the top of the hill, and I realized that the crying had stopped too. I shone my flashlight along the creek and realized that I had come to some kind of pool where the water widened and deepened. I pointed my flashlight upward to try and see the sky, but it made no dent in that oppressive darkness. It seemed to concentrate here–I could barely see my own hands in front of my face. 

The trees hung low and completely still in the wind, dead and forgotten. From one of the taller ones, I saw that a broken-off rope was tied to its lower branch, and its wood seemed to be chipping all-around the base. A low moan from beneath my feet shocked me back to the present. I blinked rapidly, trying to both calm myself and see with the faint light I had. “Ryder? You okay?” 

I looked down, and caught the top of my friend’s blonde hair shimmering in the light. He was on his knees in the freezing water pool, sitting over something and making all kinds of distressed noises, coughing and hacking as if he were choking on something. 

The water flowed around him with little effort, his shivering frame only wrist-deep. The crawdad bucket was resting on the grass several feet away, tipped over and empty. I really didn’t want to move. It felt as though I was staring down at the back of his head for centuries, shaking in the winter cold. My lips tried to form words and failed several times over. 

I didn’t care about the crawdads anymore. The empty, broken nature of his demeanor chilled me to the bone. ‘We need to go.’ I mumbled, but I still crouched and began to scoot myself down the muddy hill towards the water. ‘We shouldn’t be here.’ My boots squelched when they hit the water. The rocks were pointy and uneven, and every step was a small bolt of pain through the soles of my feet. I shone the flashlight in front of me as I slowly made my way over to where Ryder was kneeling. 

But when I had walked several steps and not come across him, I stopped. I didn’t see him anywhere in the water. In a bit of a panic, I began to shine my flashlight in a circle around me, trying to take in the area to see if he had moved once more. 

The rest of the forest circled this small inlet pool. Trickles of the creek proceeded onward, but the majority of the water sloshed around where I was standing–ankle-deep and freezing. My stomach hurt from how scared I was. ‘Ryder!’ I shouted out. I didn't even care that I was beginning to cry, but it didn’t help my vision one bit.

The longer I stood there, I began to hear the familiar clicking sound. 

It was as if the crawdads had finally begun to answer me in place of my friend. It was a loud reply. They were screeching, and it was an uncomfortable sound amongst the sheer silence of the rest of the woods. I was not interested in them anymore. I just wanted to find Ryder and get out. 

Even through the tears, I could see a giant downed and dead tree cutting over the edge of the grass and into the water. A victim of the winter weather. It was a diagonal line down into the creek bed. With my squeaking boots, I stepped a little closer. With a shaking hand, I dragged the miniscule circle of light down to the end of the tree, the part that met the water head-on. 

I couldn’t stop the gasp that fell from my mouth. The crawdads were swarming. I had never seen so many of them in one place, hundreds of them gathered around the downed branches as if something had attracted them there. It wasn’t possible that there could be that many in this creek. The chirping was incessant, but non-threatening. They didn’t seem to notice that I was there. They were pre-occupied, climbing out of the water towards, towards–

I remember slowly raising the light. What I saw first was a shock of blonde hair. What I heard first was another painful moan. 

Every patch of skin on my body was raised with goosebumps. My stomach flipped and threatened to double me over. 

Ryder was splayed on his back over the downed tree’s trunk. It looked as if he had collapsed and landed there from a high place. Other than his lips, he was not moving. His arms were dangling over the side at an uncomfortable angle. His legs were wedged underneath the foliage on the other side of the tree. His eyes were unfocused but gazing up to the sky. I didn’t get it. I had seen him in the water, how did he get to the top of that small hill or the big tree–

All of these pieces of information and concerns came and went through my brain in a matter of seconds, but all of it took a backseat to the very first thing that turned my stomach: my friend was covered in crawdads.

The little crustaceans crawled up his limbs in droves, formations and lines devoid of any pattern other than sheer, hungry pursuit. They slipped through the holes in his shirt and pants. They picked at his fingers dipped in the water. I had never seen so many all at once in my life. I gasped out loud at the sight of it, and Ryder’s hazy eyes didn’t even move as he began to speak. 

‘I want them off.’ His voice was hollow, cracking at the seams, scared and scary all at once. ‘Get them off of me, Markus.’ A single crawdad slowly crawled over his lips when they closed. Another began to pry at his nostrils. I watched as the skin on his nose folded and moved in its pinchers, as if it were shearing the skin from an onion. He shuddered in pain. When I inched only a little closer, I heard hissing from around my feet. Looking down, a couple crawdads were trying to poke my boots, displaying their pincers in a territorial show. 

My flashlight began to shudder, twitching on and off. I felt as if I couldn’t breathe. When it finally shut off and shot me back into pitch black darkness, my animal instincts kicked in enough, and allowed my hand to shake the stupid thing until it finally began to work again. 

His skin was green. His clothes were in tatters. His eyes were gray. His hair was falling out. He was splayed over the tree trunk in the same position. The crawdads continued to roam over his body. The skin on his nose and his lips were gone, clutched within the pinchers of the crawdads as they slowly peeled away what was left. They snipped at his hair and dug into cuts that laced his arms. 

He continued to moan, bloody mouth trying to forcefully echo the words he could no longer muster. 'Off…off…hurts…' Tears streamed down the broken remnants of his face. I watched as several of those awful fucking creatures reached greedy pinchers toward his eyelids.

I was having a nightmare. It wasn’t real. I forced my eyes shut, and I knew if I opened them again, I would wake up in my bunk with Mama making breakfast. Grandma would drive me to school–

But the clicking sound only grew louder. I had to open my eyes again. 

The skin I could see was gray. His clothes were shredded to nothing. There were only the crawdads, and they prodded and punctured his eyeballs, clipping away meat from the sockets with ease. Their small pincers weren’t effective enough, and so the clipping was gradual. It was like pecking away at jello. 

Bones. His fingers were fucking bones, they had entirely bitten off the flesh from where they touched the water. Searing them bit by bit–

‘Markus…’ He wept. There was nowhere left for his voice to come from, throat torn into strings of meat from endless tearing claws. It was just in my head.

The animal part of me won. I turned and I ran.

I remember screaming as I tore into the darkness of the woods. I remember getting lost. I remember waking up in the hospital. I hadn’t really been hurt, but they had found me on the top of the hill behind our trailer, passed out and covered in scratches. My mother and grandparents were with me when I woke up, panicked, angry, and relieved that nothing serious had happened. I wasn’t punished for sneaking out at night by them.

I lied, Shawn. They asked me what happened and I said I was spooked by the dark woods. I didn’t want to tell them the truth, because I didn’t know what the truth was.”

At that part in his story, Markus had started dry-heaving, and only stopped when he hit this final sentence. He was quiet, face puffy from sobbing, but he was seemingly unable to force out anything else. I sat there, stunned by everything I had just heard. I couldn’t speak, mind swimming with thoughts and fears and plenty of anything else that I couldn’t quite name. As if he was also uncomfortable with the silence after several minutes, Markus spoke up again. His voice was gravelly with pain. 

“When I made it to high school five years later, I finally gained the courage to ask my mother the truth about my friend. She finally gave me what all they knew: They thought Wyatt kidnapped him and fled the state. They spent months trying to find Mr. Poole both in Ewing and outside it, and some law enforcement in Florida did find him the next Memorial Day, wrapped around a telephone poll with enough alcohol in his blood to poison three men. Ryder wasn’t with him.

I did my own digging at later times when I was able to stomach it. Breaks of course, breaks in between weeks and months when I could even ask my family or brave a Google search bar. Mrs. Poole died of a stroke three years after her husband. Jed fell down a heroin rabbit hole in his twenties and came out a born-again evangelical somewhere in Florida. Lily was a girls high school basketball star who joined the army and got her fucking face blown off somewhere in some middle eastern shithole.

Nothing ever got better, Shawn. Nothing ever gets better. Every part of that night is seared into my memory. I still can’t think about it without panicking. I screamed when they tried to make me sleep in the trailer after that. I screamed my head off even when I slept in the house. I screamed on cold winter nights. I don’t eat seafood. I don’t stay up late. I don’t go hiking. My mother spent every dollar in her account to get me to therapists I refused to talk to. I think she knew it had something to do with Ryder, but she never asked. My grandparents died after I left Ewing. Mom has dementia and is rotting in a care facility in Nashville that I visit once a month. They never found Ryder. After days, weeks, months, and years of searches, everyone gave up.”

His story finally ended with that jarring note, and the silence in the room was enough to choke on. 

Markus looked as though he had aged twenty years in only an hour. His eyes were sunken into his skull from the weight of his sobbing, and his body seemed to be melting into the leather of the chair. 

I had plenty to think about at that moment. I can still feel my past emotions now, mouth wide and struggling to even acknowledge the childhood trauma that had been delivered to me firsthand. I don’t think I had ever heard so many words from this man ever before. I would have been happy to never hear another. My stomach was turning over.  

Every single detail was still rippling through me like stones chucked into a pond. I was very much aware that I was a dumb guy sitting in my smarter older sister’s suburban living room and trying to console her crumbling husband, and I knew I was doing a bad job. “...you never told anyone else about what happened to you that night?” I finally coughed out. My own hands were shaking.

Markus shook his head. “I never told Mama, my grandparents, my teachers, anyone. Leah knows I had a traumatic childhood, but she doesn’t know much more than that and my mother’s first name. I never allowed her to ask me questions about any of it.” His laugh was hollow. “I thought it was a nightmare. I was traumatized. I lost my friend, needed to cope, all that nonsense. Even recently…I had begun to *believe* that it was all a nightmare.” 

Time was cold and static. Only the sounds of the TV next to us showed that it was still moving. I only spoke again when I began to hear Markus mumbling something to himself. 

None of this was real. It couldn’t possibly be real, but my bigger concern was a man still haunted by hallucinations he had had as a child. In the moment I really wished that Leah was present. I had no meaningful way to comfort her husband, no real sense of how to approach something like this that would make a damn difference. He needed help, and he was in no state to have his emotions smoothed over, but I needed to say something. 

I settled on something simple and direct. “I’m…I’m sorry man.” I was too far away from him in the room, but I moved my hand to the top of my knee as if I was patting him on the shoulder. “Something like that really messes a guy up, I get it.”

“Do you?” The question cut like a knife. My eyes suddenly locked back into Markus’s, and they were wide. “I don’t think you do get it.”

“I-I mean, I didn’t mean to–”

“I wanted to move on.” Anger wasn’t an emotion I expected, but it poured out of him. It was as if a switch had been flipped. He was staring at the wall behind me as he spoke. “Leah’s great. My life is great. My job is better than I should get, but shit doesn’t happen that way. Of course it doesn’t. I was fucking stupid to think I could get over this. Because the moment I got comfortable, the moment I started thinking that I had actually gotten over whatever hallucination I had produced from my fear and the subconscious realization that my friend was dead, that’s when I…that’s when I…” His voice was raising, but it suddenly cut off there at the end. 

“When you what?” I tried to put confidence in my voice, but all I managed was a croak. 

“It’s not a nightmare, Shawn. It never has been. I heard him again, last night even.” That awful belly laugh returned. He was scratching the leather off the arms of the chair. “He was outside my window again. He was asking me if I wanted to go hunt crawdads. It’s been two weeks since then, right up to the thirty year anniversary of the first time he asked me.”

“Markus, I don’t think that’s real.” I finally said what I had been thinking, blurting it out the second he stopped speaking. His eyes locked onto me immediately. “You’re having nightmares about what you experienced.” 

“...you think I’m making this shit up.” 

That reply echoed in my bones. I cringed, and I couldn’t get rid of the grimace on my face. “It’s visceral, man. I’m not saying you’re a liar. I’m saying that you’ve been through a lot, much more than a ten year old could handle. Shit, I’m in my thirties and I know I wouldn’t do well with those kinds of visions. You didn’t do anything wrong.” 

I wanted him to reply, but my last words hit and silence overtook us. It stayed silent for what could have been ten seconds or three goddamn hours. All I could see was the fizzing cogs in Markus’s head working again. He continued to scratch the leather arms. He stared at me with a whole swirl of emotions. When he spoke again, it was quiet, but poisonous.

“I was right–you don’t believe me. I don’t know why I even told you anything…” He somehow sank even further in the chair. His eyes burned into my skull. “You think I’m crazy too.” 

“No, not crazy, just traumatized. We can get you help–”

“You aren’t listening! I’m not the one who needs help!” He shot forward, glaring at me. “I was all he had! His mother was never there. He had no other close friends. He came to me, he keeps coming back, because I was all he had! He’s in my mind and at my windows because I’m all he has!” Something demented had taken over him. The light in his eyes was composed of pure fear and rage. “I failed him. I failed my friend.”

“Markus, don’t–”

“No!” He screamed. Every bit of emotion that he had bottled up through his storytelling exploded at that moment. He was on his feet, towering over me, hands wringing and arms flailing wildly. “You don’t understand after everything I said! I saw him! He came to me for help, and I failed him! For thirty years I’ve failed him!”

A noise at the living room window made us both jump. I turned my head to see nothing but snow and ice pattering against the glass.

Markus cried out in anguish, clutching his head with both hands. He dropped the right half of his body and drove his fist through the pane. When it did not crack the first time, he beat the glass until the shards began to dissolve, sprinkling over his fist and his arm. I tried to pull him away, yanking at his frame, but whatever adrenaline coursed through him gave my scrawny brother-in-law multiplied strength. I may as well have been trying to pull down a brick wall with my bare hands. 

Blood began to drip onto Leah’s carpet, traveling down his skin as the glass cut closer to his wrist. I snapped myself out of my stupor and stopped trying to restrain him once I realized. “I’m gonna get you help, man. I’m gonna…just stay here!”

I ran to the kitchen to get bandages, finally ending the recording on my phone to call for help. While I tore through Leah’s cabinets for her first aid kit, I heard him mumbling and crying in the living room. The shattering continued, a single man’s bloodied fist breaking the glass with repeated blows. The wind howled through the open window, but I could still hear Markus’s wails clearly. “He’s still out there…he’s still out there…” 

The fast food I brought went uneaten that night. I stood shivering in the snow; watching three people drag my screaming brother into an ambulance. 

The day after that, I sat down with the video on my phone and typed out everything that had happened and everything that Markus had told me. I forced myself to do it. Believe me, I took no kind of pleasure from listening to those wails, or hearing the cracking window glass over and over again. Even making these two posts was difficult.

I’m not gonna pretend as if I was the one who got the shit end of the stick from this whole ordeal. Leah’s currently managing not only her full-time job, but has also been hinting at a potential break between her and her husband. I haven’t given her the full story but I plan to soon. I’m just not really sure how to best broach the subject yet, and I doubt she wants a typed version. 

Markus remains in the hospital with self-inflicted injuries at the time of writing this second post. He’s basically kept chained to a bed 24/7, and he’ll start something if all of the lights in the room aren’t blasting at full power. Leah called me this morning and I need to return that call. 

I’ve spent a bit of time these last two weeks trying to discover more about the Poole family from sources in Ewing and online. The claims of Wyatt Poole’s violent death and Ryder’s sudden disappearance turned out to be true, and to this day no one really knows what happened to that kid. I found Jedidiah Poole’s ministry in Tampa and obituaries for both Alissa Renee and Lily Belle Poole in online newspaper archives. 

Aside from that, there wasn’t much else about them I could uncover. Police swear up and down they combed the area for miles to see if something happened there, and even though I’ve never been too sure about police testimony, I was going to have to be satisfied with that. There’s an email sitting in my draft folder to Jed’s ministry address that I don’t have the courage to send, and I don’t know if I’ll ever get that courage. I saw a few true crime podcast episodes about the family and didn’t give them any attention. 

Short of actually driving to his hometown, I’ve done just about all I can stomach. I’ve been skipping out on onions in my burgers. I’ve been drinking a little too much when I do get out with friends, and I’ve found myself avoiding questions about the subject when they ask. I thought getting the story off my phone and into the world would give some kind of relief, but it hasn't.

My parents now claim that all of their bad feelings about the guy were warranted, but I still can’t find it in myself to dislike Markus, even after everything that happened that night. Leah thinks he’s crashing out and my parents think he’s full-blown crazy, but I think there’s a nugget of truth in every man’s wildest stories. 

To be clear, I don’t believe him, but I also don’t think a man that tortured created a folktale for nothing. I’ll never forget the pain in his eyes, and every single word he spoke that inevitably landed him in the hospital. I wasn’t perfect that night, but I don’t know if there’s that much I could have done differently to help him. Those thoughts are enough to make me sick. 

But in my quiet moments, when something dark overtakes me, I return to my laptop with dozens of thoughts and questions. I’m seeing my doctor later this week for a routine check-up and even with my anxiety, I’ve still got the same question rattling around in my head after all that time. Something from Markus’s story that makes me squeamish and curious at the same time. Leah would chew me out if she knew about it, but I guess I just can’t let it go until I know.

Maybe a zoologist or someone from the south would know better, but can crawdads actually eat flesh?
