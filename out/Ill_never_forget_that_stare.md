I would like to make something very clear here. I usually never get scared. When I say never, I truly mean never. I’m a huge fan of horror, but I never felt fear from anything in my life. Mild discomfort at most, but even that's rare. That is until what I experienced 5 minutes ago. It’s 5:15am and I never felt such fear before.



For context, I live with my grandma. She just turned 82 last week and I took time off work to visit and spent time with her in Virginia (I’m 25 and work as a financial analyst in New York). She’s raised me all my life and we’re extremely close, genuinely the sweetest woman I know. However, the incident I just experienced makes me…uncomfortable.



Yesterday, we were watching TV in the living room and she was getting a little tired. My grandma is an early bird, so she usually goes to bed at 8:30-9pm every night. Tonight was no different.



As she got up from the chair she’s had since I could remember, she hugged me goodnight and headed upstairs to her bedroom. I’m a night owl and usually don’t go to bed until 4:30-5am lol, so I chose to stay up a bit longer.



A few hours pass and I was still watching TV. However, I started hearing a faint banging sound from afar. I couldn’t wrap my finger around it, but I ignored it at first. My grandma lives in the middle of the forest in a cabin, so I assumed it was an animal outside scraping for food or something.



5 minutes later and the banging got a bit louder. The weird thing is that the bangs were consistent, if that makes any sense. Idk where it was coming from, but it certainly came from outside the house. I started getting a bit concerned when it wasn't stopping, so I went upstairs to check on grandma. 



Thankfully, she was fast asleep, and all the windows were locked. By the time I made it to her bedroom, the banging had stopped, so I let it be and walked back down. It was 2am by this point and I figured it was time to at least try to go to sleep (since I have insomnia), so I got ready and headed to the guest bedroom, which is where I slept.



What felt like a few hours passed, and the banging came back. I hadn’t fallen asleep yet, so I could vividly hear the moment it returned. However, this time, it was a little stranger.



Not only was it much, much louder, but also, it wasn’t just a banging sound.



I could also hear screaming coming behind it. A what seemed to be bloodcurdling scream of a person yelling for help. The longer I waited, the louder it got.



Eventually I got pissed off and got out of bed. With my phone flashlight at hand, I followed where the bangs and screaming were coming from. But suddenly, just as I had made it to the living room, it had stopped.



“TJ, are you ok?” I heard.



I turned around and saw my grandma standing on the other side of the hallway.



“Yeah, just that I heard a lot of banging and screaming from outside.” I replied.



“Banging and screaming?” Grandma seemed confused.



“Yeah, but maybe it was just an animal or something.” I said while dimming the phone flashlight. Although I didn't believe for a second that it was 'just an animal,' I didn't want to make my grandma worried or cause any problems for the night. Besides, it had already stopped so I hoped that it wouldn't come back.



Grandma sighed. “Things like that happen around here sometimes. You should get some sleep, sweetie. It's late and we have plans tomorrow."



I smiled. “Yes, grandma, I will. Love you."



I hugged her and went back to my room where I eventually dozed off. I could hear my grandma turning on the TV and cooking herself breakfast, as usual.



The next day passed by in a flash and nighttime came by again. I hadn’t thought of what happened the night before and just saw it as a normal day. 



That is until I realized that it was 1am and my grandma was still wide awake. Not just that, but also a lot more talkative than usual too. 



This wouldn’t have caught me off guard if it weren’t for the fact that she never stayed up past 9pm for the last 20 years.



“Hey, grandma.” I asked. Shouldn’t you go to bed? It’s late for you.”



“Oh sweetie, but I’m not tired.” She said. “I’ll go in a bit, don’t worry.”



It was starting to get late, even for my standards.



"You should go to bed soon, it's getting late. I'll go now, goodnight." I said.



As I laid down on my bed, I closed my eyes. After what felt like 15 minutes, I heard that faint sound again. 



Banging.



As it got louder, the bloodcurdling scream followed.



“What the fuck?” I muttered under my breath as I swiftly pushed the duvet off me.



Grabbing my flashlight, I went back to investigate. This time, with the intention of figuring out what it was.



As I slowly opened the door, I tiptoed around the house, following the sound. It seemed like my grandma was back upstairs, sleeping, so I tried to be as quiet as possible (even though banging and screaming wasn't helping).



Although I didn’t feel scared of what was happening (like I said, I don't get scared easily), I was getting a bit uncomfortable as the sound worsened the closer I got to it. 



“What the fuck?” I muttered again.



As I walked closer, the banging and screaming got progressively louder. Suddenly, I paused.



There was no mistaking it, the banging and screaming was coming from the other side of the storage room door, the room my grandma keeps her stuff in.



As I reached out to it, I felt a cold presence send shivers down my spine. I gasped and staggered backwards. As I quickly turned around, I saw my grandma standing at the other side of the hallway. But this time, she looked different.



Her back, completely straight. Her skin was pale. Her soulless, lifeless stare piercing through me. It was the first time I had seen a human without a single sign of a catch light shining her eyes. It was a tense and deadly, but lifeless expression, one I can’t describe in words. 



However, it was the first time I felt danger looking at the lady who had raised me for 25 years.



Her face was glowing from the moonlight outside, although the rest of her body was surrounded by darkness. From afar, it looked like a floating head.



Suddenly, her eyes widened, and there followed a smile. However, not a single wrinkle formed around her eyes. It was ominous. Nothing could convince me that the person standing in front of me was my grandmother. It barely felt human.



“TJ.” She said, her voice tone flat. “What are you doing?”



I began shaking. By this point, the screaming had stopped. It was silent. I began stuttering, then stayed quiet. No word escaped from my lips. 

  
For the first time in my life, I felt genuine fear.



“TJ.” Repeated my grandma, her voice tone still flat.



My body tensed up as I looked at her. I could barely breathe.



“What are you doing?” Said my grandma, slower than before.



I took a deep breath, hoping that any ounce of my body could relax enough so I could form a sentence. 



“I’m sorry, grandma.” I said, my voice cracking. “I was curious on what the screaming was.”



Grandma’s smile dropped instantly, and her eyes widened further. “What scream?”



My body tensed again. It felt like I was getting stares from all angles. I suddenly felt something cold touch my bare feet. As I looked down, I saw what looked like blood leaking from the storage room door, reaching to my feet.



“Thomas Junior.” Said my grandma, raising her voice slightly.



I gulped and looked back up. “Yes?”



“What scream?” She repeated, her voice deepening slightly.



Only one sentence could come out of me at that moment. 



“Maybe it was just a dream, I’m sorry, grandma.”



Her eyes widened further, although her stare only became more tense.



“Go to sleep, now.” She said, enunciating every word. She sounded deeper than before, almost inhumane.



“Yes, grandma.” I said, my body tensing up further.



As I walked towards her, a sense of pressure dawned over me. Walking past her, I could feel her stare stabbing my head.



Walking to my room, I closed the door and hid under the covers. Checking my foot, my suspicions were correct. What I felt leaking from under the storage room door wasn’t just water.



It was cold blood.



This event leads to me writing this down. Idk what to do. My grandma’s stare, if she even was my grandma at that moment, is implanted into my brain. I feel a cold presence looming over me. I’m still shaking, hoping that the morning comes asap and I can forget about this.



What should I do?! 



Please, I need all the help I can get.

  
I don't know what to do.
