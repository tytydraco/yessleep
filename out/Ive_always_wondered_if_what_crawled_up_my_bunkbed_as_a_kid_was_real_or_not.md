I have had a pretty interesting childhood, to say the least. I grew up in a large family, 10 siblings. My parents were deeply Christian and listened to God for everything. They would follow whatever they thought the will of God was. 

Because of that, we moved around a lot and never stayed anywhere for too long. My parents are both sick people who believe that mental illness is always demons or the influence of the devil in some way. Odd behavior was always met with prayer. My parents would go full exorcism mode and start asking the "demon" in us what it's name was and eventually to leave. 

The way my parents raised me proved to be very difficult on me because I'd come to find out much later in life that I had schizoaffective disorder. I was prone to seeing and hearing things that others couldn't. It started off mostly innocent, but the more I saw them, the more my parents would tell me they were evil spirits trying to scare me to open my soul up to them. 

They told me they craved fear and that I shouldn't be afraid and give them what they wanted. I was never able to not be afraid.
I have vivid memories of the things I'd seen. They became increasingly more terrifying and caused me a lot of trauma while growing up. 
There are many stories similar to this one.

There was one night in particular where I was up in my room on the second floor. This house was interesting. It was connected to a church. But although it was connected to a church, it was the 2nd creepiest house I'd ever lived in. It felt.. wrong. 

I slept up on the top bunk of a metal framed bunkbed. The kind where the whole bed would shake and squeak really loud every time someone climbed it. I shared the room with one of my older brothers but went to bed alone that night because the 3 oldest siblings and my dad were playing cards together downstairs. 

I fell asleep without issue, but I suddenly woke up after a little while. I heard a slow creaking. I immediately recognized it as someone getting on the ladder to climb the bed. Normally my brother wouldn't climb the foot of my bed like that. He'd just say hey from the side or go to bed without saying anything.

My eyes shot open, and I felt a sense of dread as soon as I heard the metal creak. I couldn't explain it, but I knew to be afraid of whatever was there. I had another older brother who I feared greatly. Part of me thought it could be him, and another part felt like primal fear of the unknown. 

The creaking was so slow. Whatever it was, it was crawling up slowly and carefully. As my heart began racing and I started hyperventilating, I saw a pale gray fleshy head peak over the top of the ladder, and a small, deformed humanoid thing began to crawl onto my bed toward me. 

I began to panic and jumped off the side of the bed, and ran downstairs without looking back. When I got downstairs, I was crying to my family saying I saw something in my room. My parents prayed over the room and the house and called it a night. I never got over it, though. The sounds. The feeling of intense fear. 

I obviously at this point, after my diagnosis, believe what I saw to be my brain processing trauma in a way a child could understand. But it just felt so real. It sticks with me to this day.

I have a number of similar stories like this throughout my childhood. This is just one of many encounters. There were many houses and many "evil spirits" within each home. I always felt like they enjoyed tormenting me.
I'm going to write more stories from my childhood as a series. I hope you enjoy them.
