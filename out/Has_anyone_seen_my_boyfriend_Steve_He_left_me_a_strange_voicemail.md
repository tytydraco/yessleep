My name is Kristen, and I'm reaching out here in desperation. My boyfriend, Steve, is missing. It's been a month since he disappeared. Steve and I have been together for three years, and we share everything with each other. That's why I'm so confused. He would never have ghosted me. I know he loved me :(

This all started about a month ago. I had no idea where Steve was or what had happened to him. We were supposed to move some furniture in my apartment to prepare for my mom, who was visiting from Delaware, but Steve never showed up. I called and called and texted him countless times, but there was no response. His friends and family hadn't heard from him either. It was like he had vanished into the void. I suppose I shouldn't say that ALL of his friends hadn't heard from him. Greg, Steve's friend from high school, replied to my text the morning after Steve went missing.

I asked, "Have you seen Steve? He was supposed to meet me after I got home from my shift last night, but he never showed. I'm worried and I don't know what to do."

Greg replied, "Steve is ok. I'm sure he's ok. You'll see him soon. I promise." And then, an hour later, he sent another text, which puzzled me at the time, "If I don't bring Steve back by tomorrow morning, go to r/nosleep on Reddit, and ask what to do."

In the general chaos of that time, going to an internet forum for advice was the last thing on my mind, but now, having no other recourse, I don't see what I have to lose. Greg, needless to say, never showed up with Steve and has not replied to my many attempts to contact him since. I don't know where he is either. I imagine that Greg must have posted here before, but I don't know how I'd possibly go about finding anything like that.

I've contacted the local police, and they assured me that everything would be ok. But their contact has become less and less frequent, and while their assurances still persist, I can tell they are no longer earnest in their searching.

Finally, last week, my phone rang, but I was in a meeting at work. When I was finally able to check who had called, my gut wrenched as I saw it was Steve's number. He had left a voicemail. Tears streamed down my face as I hit play, but there was no voice on the other end. Just radio static. I fell to the floor and started sobbing, but after a minute, the message started playing some crackling radio guy's voice saying, "Thank you for spending time out of your life to be with us. You, yes you, the listeners, are what give us the energy to go through this every single day. So from all of us at 103.1, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you. This next song is for you..." The message then begins to play the song "You're the Reason I'm Living" sung by Bobby Darin. I tried to call back. I tried for hours. I must not have gone to bed until around one in the morning. [I've included the voicemail in this post for any of you who wants to try to dissect it for anymore potential information](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mZF0gxDxG_wKMlO85UuoHrmOiZVb47DA/view?usp=sharing).

My heart is broken. If you have any information, and I do mean any, about what might have happened to Steve, please, I'm begging you to let me know.

I miss you, Steve. Please come home.

Love, Kristen
