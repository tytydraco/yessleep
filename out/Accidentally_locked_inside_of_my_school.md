I'm not particularly brave and I have never been but sometimes curiosity gets the best of me and that makes me get in trouble.

At first I was hesitant to post this but I feel like I should share it so here it goes...


I'm from a small country in Latin America, my hometown is also pretty small and is pretty normal to know most people around me from store owners to local "celebrities".
Since I was a kid I've been very shy and didn't have many friends so I was known as the lonely kid, always by himself and, in a way, I enjoyed being alone since talking to people always seemed a little difficult to me, even in school. 

Even though I was very shy, I enjoyed playing soccer with my classmates in the yearly soccer tournament my school held. I loved seeing everyone around using official soccer teams logos and giving it all to win first place.

After the opening day matches ended, I went on to get some food at the cafeteria. I wanted to eat my lunch right there but it was totally packed and felt uneasy so I went to a lonely spot behind the classrooms right next to a big tree. Everything was calm and quiet, I ate my food and wanted to go home but something was off. I always enjoyed some peace and quiet but this time it was TOO quiet. As a matter of fact, it was so quiet that I was only able to hear my heart beating rapidly and an annoying ringing in my ears.
It was midday, I didn't check the time at that moment but I'm pretty sure it was around 12 o'clock because of how bright the sun was. Didn't matter what time it was anyways, I was terrified and I didn't know why. 
Have you ever felt like you're being watched? Or maybe that annoying feeling of having someone you don't like walk right behind you? That's exactly what I was feeling. My mind was screaming and my body was begging me to just run and find someone else, and so that's what I tried to do. I ran and ran but everyone had left, even the guard who used to stay longer at the main entrance. I was totally alone, but I didn't feel like I was truly "alone".

Looking at one of the hallways, my fear only grew bigger and bigger. I felt like someone was going to come out of nothing and get me, and I wouldn't be able to do anything about it but scream for help.
After a few minutes thinking about a way to exit school grounds I happened to look right at the end of a hallway while walking and my eyes just locked on something. Although my mind took some time to identify what I was looking at I finally snapped out of it and saw it; a dark figure peeking from one of the classrooms in the distance. I felt my heart stop for a second but I wasted no time and decided to run, feeling worse than ever I remembered  that one of the walls on the northern side of the school was damaged and could be climbed without risk of injury.
After getting there, I felt like whoever was watching me was getting closer by moment so I climbed the wall as fast as I could and jumped to the other side without even thinking if the landing would hurt me. Luckily for me, outside of the northern side of the school, there's a public park and the walls weren't so high so I landed perfectly but I wasted no time and started to run as fast as my tired legs could run until I got to my grandma's house. My grandma was worried about my terrified face and asked "what happened, why are you so pale?". I told her what happened and she then told me an old story about a student who committed suicide in one of the classrooms a long time ago.

I'm not sure if I dismissed that story just because I didn't want to believe that I was being harassed by some sort of ghost or because I've heard lots and lots of stories about people dying on school grounds, some more ridiculous than others.

That figure... that horrible feeling... I'll never forget it, it's completely burned into my mind.
