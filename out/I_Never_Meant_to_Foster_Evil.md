I was kneeling on the kitchen floor, coaxing a stubborn grey kitten to finish its dinner, when the thought returned to me. Quiet as always, heavy as gravity:

I am impossibly small.

And yet, here in this fragile moment, my hands meant everything to something living.

Five kittens crowded the dish, their tiny bodies warm and unsteady, ribs fluttering with purrs beneath my fingertips. That familiar smell of tuna and salt hung in the air. As the kittens ate, I listened to the sounds of my house. The dogs shifted around in their sleep, radiator clicking rhythmically.

My house was a place of comfort and nourishment for all of nature's creatures. But altruism, in practice, is not how people imagine. It’s filth and relapse. Grief and chewed furniture and broken promises and sleepless nights. It’s urine on the floor and blood in the sink and hands that shake too badly to hold a spoon.

People asked me why I’d take on such a massive burden; why volunteer for so much suffering? But suffering does not arrive in neat categories. Nature does not sort its pain. When the whole world turns away, someone has to open their heart. That was me. A voice for the voiceless.

But humans are a disaster of contradiction. They burn everything they touch. And yet, they are nature—just as surely as hurricanes and parasites and forest fires. I do not choose what belongs in the ecosystem. Only how I interact with it.

I was wiping kitten food from my hands when I heard a knock on the front door.

On the porch in front me was a young man and woman beneath the light of the full moon. Their clothes were thin for December, and they stood desperate, shivering in the cold night air. That familiar weariness of hunger sat openly on their faces, along with the restless fear of people who hadn’t slept safely in a long time.

“You Opal?” the guy asked.

“Yeah, that's me.”

He shifted his weight with a clenched jaw. “Our friends said you take people in?”

The woman nodded with pleading eyes. “We’re trying to get clean. We just need a warm meal and a bed for the night. I promise we won't be any trouble.”

She clutched the sleeve of the man’s jacket like she might float away in the wind.

I opened the door wider. How could I not? They needed me.

 “Please, come inside before you freeze."

Without any hesitation, they shuffled inside past me. 

“Thank you so much, I’m Katrina.”

“Justin,” he said, giving a short nod. His eyes lingered on me. “You’re very kind.”

The house reacted to them immediately. The dogs erupted in a thunder of barks and a cat yowled upstairs. I shushed them all with soft affirmations that it was okay, then showed my new fosters to the last empty room at the end of the hall. The metal bedframe creaked when Katrina tested its weight.

“Sorry. It’s not much, but it’s the best I got right now.”

“It’s perfect,” she whispered.

Justin didn’t speak. He kept watching my hands. I left them to their own devices and returned to my nightly mission. 

Back in the kitchen, I continued the familiar ritual of feeding everything that trusted me with its hunger. I was used to cooking for two, but I'd have to adjust. The only other human staying with me at the moment was Kevin. Quiet, hollowed out Kevin. He had been sober for sixty-three days and in all that time we'd barely spoken. I adjusted the portions in my head; two more mouths to feed.

A couple bricks of frozen vegetable stock went into the pot. Butter melted into gold under chopped carrots and onions. Steam rose and fogged the window over the sink. I worked on autopilot, comforted by the ancient choreography.

Justin and Katrina whispered at the table. Their heads bent close, voices no more than breath. When I mentioned how pretty the full moon is, they both flinched as if I’d called their names in a crowd.

“No,” Justin said quickly. “Didn’t see it.”

Katrina wouldn’t look at me.

Withdrawal can do strange things to the mind, and I didn't hold it against them.

Dinner was awkward. Kevin sat quietly, eating without lifting his gaze. Katrina slowly picked at her food. Justin ate aggressively, eyes fixed on the bowl like it might fight back.

Trying to lighten the mood, I asked about their astrological signs.

Justin scoffed. “We don’t believe in that shit.”

I caught the fleeting satisfaction in his eyes, the childish pleasure of being cruel in a space that expected softness. Part of me wanted to scold him, but I knew he was lashing out to mask his own pain.

“It’s just for fun, there's no faith required,” I said. 

But neither responded. I was relieved when the meal was finally over, and I could clear the table.

When I reached for Justin’s bowl, his hand shot out. Before I could react, his hand had closed around my wrist as a rotten grin stretched across his face.

I tried to pull away, but he tightened his fingers and laughed.

I swung on instinct.

My fist clipped the side of his head as he yanked me forward. The floor rushed up with shocking speed and I crashed hard into the wood. His weight crushed the air from my chest. Katrina screamed as Justin shouted at her to get his bag.

I kicked and thrashed with all my might, but it did nothing.

His knuckles split my cheek. Pain bloomed immediately. The world spun around as he dragged me out of the kitchen and down the hall. I felt the cold bite of plastic at my wrists, and heard the metallic rattle of the bedframe as he wrenched my arms wide and zip-tied me to the iron posts.

My legs scraped raw on the hardwood as he finished restraining me.

From the kitchen came laughter and celebration. Cabinets opened and slammed. Glass shattered. Furniture dragged across the floor with triumphant violence.

I sat in stunned silence as the truth began to settle in. There were so many innocent lives in this house that depended on me. I could hear the dogs whimpering in panic, the cats scurrying to hide. My heart fractured under the weight of it—reminding me how small and insignificant I truly was.

Kevin’s face appeared in the doorway, and relief crashed through me so violently I nearly wept.

“Kevin,” I whispered through clenched teeth. “Get me out. Please. Now.”

He hung his head low. “Justin said he’d hurt me.”

“I will kill you,” I whispered back, with the same calm I used on cornered animals. “Get over here and help me… NOW.”

He flinched, but yet, still turned and walked away.

As his shadow disappeared down the hall, something inside me finally split.

All I had ever wanted was to protect the small, vulnerable creatures. Those that could not survive without gentler hands guiding them. Again and again, humans had answered that gift with theft, violence, and contempt.

A new feeling rose sharply through my body—like an ancient tide finally rising, pressing against every boundary I had spent my life building.

Two forces warred in my chest: mercy and ruin.

Just as the battle for my soul reached a crescendo, two small puppies turned the corner. Gary, a little white fluff ball, and Roxy, my sweetest girl with her short black hair.

They padded up to me with what seemed like impossible calm for the moment. Their steps were measured and purposeful. When they looked at me, I felt recognized in a way I had never known.

I stared into the inky blackness of their eyes, drawn in with overwhelming gravity.

The world vanished around me.

I was submerged in all consuming blackness. No longer bound to the bedframe, I floated in a featureless abyss.

In that black void, a purple flame ignited, burning with an ancient intensity that vibrated through my bones.

The flame spoke without language, its meaning unfolding directly inside my soul.

"Take me."

I stepped into the fire, and in one breath I was back on the hardwood floor.

The puppies were at my wrists. Their tiny, razor-sharp teeth tore at the zip ties until they gave way.

I stood, something vast moving behind my eyes.

In the kitchen, the noise had swollen into something feral. Laughter, shouting, the crash of my life being joyfully destroyed. Kevin met me in the hallway, face wet with tears. His body shook like a leaf in a storm.

I looked into his eyes, and filled him with my will.

In one swift motion, he turned, took the knife from the block, and plunged it into Justin’s neck. He pulled the knife out, painting Katrina with a crimson spray. Kevin tackled her before she understood what was happening. Her screams collapsed into choking silence beneath his hands. 

I watched as she flailed under Kevin’s oppressive grip. Legs kicking against the hardwood floor, hands searching frantically in all directions. Her wild eyes met mine and pleaded in silent agony. I stared into her soul as mother earth reclaimed her spark.

Kevin then rose, lifted the knife to his own chest, and slowly plunged it between his ribs.

Steam fogged the windows.

Blood soaked into my floors.

Purple fire hummed behind my eyes.

This was nothing. Small and insignificant—a single corrective twitch in a world convulsing with imbalance. Our world burns and our oceans turn to acid.

Mother Earth is wounded beyond measure.

And I...

I am the counterweight.
