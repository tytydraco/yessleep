I don't know how it got there- or who put it there.

I was clearing out my old bedroom at my parent's house- they were downsizing and asked me to pack up my stuff and to either take it or throw it out. There was a lot of stuff that plucked my nostalgic heartstrings, but most of it really was junk so I just threw it out. I did keep some stuff though- the first A+ I had ever gotten on a Maths test, for example.

I did see something that was... out of place. It was a box, which had dust on it but I couldn't remember ever buying it. I thought it was a VHS tape initially but when I grabbed it I saw that it was a video game box.

'Wizard Hunter.... your job is to find the wizard in 3 days, or else it's game over.'

That was it. That was the only thing written on the back of the box, and the front just had 'Wizard Hunter' written all over it. That was very odd- I gave the box a good shake. Seemed like it still had the disc inside.

It was weird though- in that there was no ESRB rating on the box, or a name of a company or studio, or even a barcode with the price on it. 

I did not remember buying it- and it looked like a knockoff to be honest. Had this been one of my friends?

My parents were of little help in this regard- saying that it was probably something they had bought for my Xbox on Christmas.

I owned a PS3, in case you're wondering.

I took the box home, opened it to find the CD inside, and loaded it up. Maybe this was some kind of prank game made by one of my friends for me to find- but as far as I remembered, none of them were tech-savy enough to come up with something like this.

I put the disc inside my computer and loaded the game- a screen flashed displaying the title 'Wizard Hunter' and then text scrolled across the screen.

'Greetings Player! Let's you and I play a game together- find me within three days, and my treasure is yours. On the other hand if you can't find me, well...'

There was an image of a strange creature that looked like a minotaur but with spikes on its arms and dark wings sprouting from its back.

'...my little friend here will get you and your soul will belong to me.'

A timer counting down from 72:00:00 appeared on the screen.

I waited around five minutes for something to happen- mashing nearly every single key but couldn't get something to work. That's it- the game was stuck on that message. I shut it off and turned it back on only to see the timer again, but the countdown had not reset.

Assuming it was just some dumb hoax I went about my day as usual.

The next morning though, I got the scare of my life when I got into my car to drive to work.

In the rear view mirror, in the distance- I saw it.

The demon from the game. I whipped my head around to see that there was nothing really there, but when I looked in the mirror, it was there again. I turned the car on and began to drive frantically, but the thing kept the same distance.

I was sure I was hallucinating or something, but every single time I looked into a reflective surface, I could see it, out in the distance. I was so shaken I took the day off and went home and tried falling asleep straightaway, thinking that maybe sleep deprivation was the cause behind this odd vision. 

The next morning, a deep pit developed in my stomach as I realized something- not only could I see the monster in the distance still- *it was getting closer*.

I searched up the game online but couldn't find a mention of it at all, let alone a walkthrough or a Let's Play. I loaded up the game and started at it for half an hour, eventually screaming at it wondering why the game wouldn't start when it struck me- maybe the game *had* started.

After all, I could see the game's monster in the mirror- maybe the wizard was in the real world- I could only find him with a mirror though.

I spent the afternoon looking like an idiot searching for the wizard with a mirror in my hand, noticing the monster getting closer and closer.

Where was I even supposed to start? There were no clues or hints. And could the wizard be literally anywhere on planet earth? 

Eventually I was so exhausted I fell asleep, but now that I've woken up I see the countdown shows there are only six hours left.

And that monster- it's almost right behind me.

I'm terrified guys- and I need your help. Does anyone know any cheat code to finding the wizard? Or how to get rid of this monster? I tried breaking the disk already, and deleting the program- nothing's helped. 

Please reply soon, I may not have much time left...
