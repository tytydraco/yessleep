I had just finished my night shift and was driving home. The desert air pressed against my skin cold and sharp carrying sand that scratched my arms. I had just moved here from the city and back home my family always joked about the desert eating you at night. My dad would laugh and say, "You will break down and never be seen again," and my sister would roll her eyes. I never thought it would happen to me.

Now my car coughed shuddered and died on a lonely stretch of road. I twisted the key. Nothing. The engine was gone. The radio was dead.

I remembered my dad telling me about the desert roads during his trucking days. Not the roads themselves but the roadsides. People walking shadows moving under the moonlight. Lost souls. "Never get out of your car," he said. "Or you will become one of them."

I did not want to get out. The night was thick almost liquid and the moon hung low. The brush along the road swayed whispering with the breeze. Coyotes laughed somewhere in the distance sharp and eerie. I turned the key again. Nothing.

I started noticing shapes in the brush. People or what looked like people gliding just at the edge of the headlights. Walking shadows. Their movements too smooth too slow too deliberate. I swallowed hard and tried not to look directly at them.

Then I saw lights over the hill. Headlights moving toward me. Relief clawed at me.

A figure appeared walking slowly up the road toward my car. The glare from the headlights blinded me and I could not make out who it was. My chest tightened. I wanted to start driving to get out of here but my car would not start.

The figure stopped at my window. I flinched. It was him. My dad.

He smiled though it did not reach his eyes. "Hey, how have you been?" he asked.

I nodded nervously. "I have been… fine."

He leaned slightly against the car just enough to block the moonlight behind him making him a silhouette. "The desert is something else at night isn’t it," he said softly. "Feels like the world stops or maybe it’s just waiting."

I swallowed hard glancing at the walking shadows lingering just beyond the brush. "Yeah… it’s quiet."

He smiled faintly. "Thanksgiving was nice. The family really misses you."

A long pause stretched between us and I tried again. "Thanksgiving… what do you mean? It’s July."

He gave a slow sad smile not answering directly. "We had a good dinner last year didn’t we? Plenty of laughter." He let it hang in the air. "Your sister… she’s done with college now. All grown up."

I shook my head. "She’s still in high school. How can you…?"

He looked down briefly sighed quietly and then looked back at me. "Time moves differently when you’re not paying attention. You work too hard don’t you?"

I forced a laugh. "Yeah night shift. It’s… it’s exhausting."

He nodded as if the previous confusion had never happened. "I know. I remember those nights. You’d fall asleep sometimes without warning. Just like that time…" His voice trailed off. He smiled faintly lingering. "I was worried about you."

Finally he got my car started. I exhaled relief mixing with unease. He hugged me suddenly. It was too tight too long his head brushing mine. "I will see you next month son," he said.

Something clicked. Every week my family visited. On my days off. Always. Too regular. Too precise. Why a month now?

I started my car and caught something in the headlights. A makeshift memorial my name scrawled on a faded wooden cross. I froze.

Then it hit me. I remembered falling asleep at the wheel one night after my shift then a white flash.

I gripped the steering wheel. My hands shook. I whispered to myself barely audible over the wind, "Wait… did I?"
