**Chapter 3: Door**

The next day after the tour, Clark was ready to start working. Katy had printed and gave him his key card at the end of the previous day. The guard scanned the card and let him park inside the wall. It was six in the evening, the lot was empty except for a handful of cars. *I wonder which one is uncle’s, could he still be here this late?* Clark wondered. Katy was gone for the day, so he used his card to enter the facility. The smell of spoiled chicken still hung in the air, maybe that was something he could fix today. In the main facility room, he and Nancy shared a computer, used to clock in and out. He could even surf the web on his breaks! Nothing wrong with watching some shows while on a meal break. He had his own facility cart where he could carry all the tools needed. Mop, sponges, rags… you name it, Clark had it. He put on his headphones and began to work. Nothing out of the ordinary happened until a few hours into the shift. A man came out of one of the red sealed doors and made his way down the hall that Clark was mopping. He was an old Japanese man with a small mustache, bald head, shrewd eyes, and large glasses. The man was wearing a white doctor’s gown and sleek black shoes that creaked along the hallway. Clark took his headphones off and greeted the man. 

“Evening doctor, name’s Clark. I’m the new janitor around here.”

 The man eyed Clark up and down for a few seconds, seemingly in judgment. 

“Ah yes, nephew of Mr. Rogers. The last janitor we had left poorly… I hope you will not do the same” said the man. 

Without introducing his own name, the doctor walked away. But not before Clark got a glance at his name tag. 

*Doctor Wu, huh? I think he’s a friend of my uncles… seems like a piece of work* thought Clark. The rest of the shift was spent cleaning desks and bathrooms. He made sure to make the place spotless and empty all trash cans. But the spoiled smell was still in the air. Guess that would have to be a problem for another day. 

Second week on the job, Clark got his first paycheck. It was huge! At least triple the size of his average check from the school. The money pleased him, he used the cash to buy a new set of headphones. The pay was great, but the environment… not so. Something was just… weird about SynMed. All the other workers were quiet and kept to themselves, besides the occasional chat with Nancy and Katy of course. He hadn’t even seen his uncle yet, he hoped to run into him sometime soon. The rooms that Clark wasn’t allowed in had started to pique his interests as well. Maybe it’s just all the cameras, but he could never shake the feeling that someone was watching him. He never noticed anything that might suggest so, but the hairs on the back of his neck would stand up and he would get chills. A seemingly instinctive response to an unwanted pair of eyes. Not to mention he still couldn’t get rid of the foul odor in the air. People acted like he was crazy for smelling anything. They must be ‘blind’ to the smell or something.

*Maybe an animal died in the vents or something… I’ll just check it out later.* Whatever other doubts might cloud Clark’s mind, he would simply shake them away and keep working. After all, fifty dollars an hour is not something to worry about at all. 

After clocking in, Clark struck up a conversation with Katy. 

“Hey Katy, so I’ve been meaning to ask. What is the process exactly for giving someone a replacement body part? I can see that you have purple access, so you must know a lot about this company.”

Katy seemed pleased that he asked, she grabbed her coffee and gestured to the couches in the waiting room.

 “So Clarky, let me tell you a basic representation of our process here at SynMed. A customer comes to us asking for a replacement mold. The term ‘body-part’ can be a little gross, so we call individual organs or limbs ‘molds’. Now, I then schedule a meeting for them with my husband, Wu…”

*What? Katy is married to Dr. Wu? I had no idea…* Clark thought. 

Katy continued, 

“After Wu’s evaluation, we  take a minimum of two weeks to prepare the mold for the person. To do that we draw some blood, then go through a process of mixing it with the mold. I don’t know how it all works, too much science for me. Ask my husband if you see him, have you met him yet?”

Clark answered, 

“Once in passing, he seemed busy and we didn’t get to chat. I haven’t even seen my uncle yet.”

“That isn’t too surprising. Mr. Roberts rarely comes into work. Keep an eye out for a red, sports-y car with yellow lines. I’m sure you know all about those cars and stuff but I don’t know all the different types.”

*Man is Katy a talker…* thought Clark. Katy continued, again, 

“You know Wu and your uncle were friends in college, that's how they met and started this business. Also, there is no better way to learn something than to experience it. Tell you what Clarky, I have a new customer who scheduled a meeting with my husband today. His name is John Elton, a war veteran who needs an arm. I will have you sit in with Dr. Wu and follow up on Elton’s process, m’kay?”

“Sure, that sounds great! Thanks for the chat Katy, I’ve been clocked in for the past half hour I should probably start working no-”

“Oh but wait I haven’t even told you the story of how they met! You see, both your uncle and Wu are big fans of tennis and…”

An hour later, Clark hadn’t started working yet when John Elton walked in the building. He was an old, fat man. Bald headed with a long white beard. He was holding a wooden cane that thunked hard against the wooden entryway floor. And just like Katy stated, his right arm was missing. 

“Hey, John Elton? I’m Clark, nice to meet you”

“Oh, hello young’un, are you this Wu fellow?”

Katy walked up to the man, 

“No, that would be my husband. I’m Katy, we spoke earlier on the phone. Wu will be with you shortly, and Clark here is new so he is going to sit through your meeting if you don’t mind” she said. 

“Oh, sure I don’t mind at all. Mind if I take a seat while we wait?” asked John. 

Clark made small talk with John for a few minutes while they waited. Wu then walked into the room.

“John Elton, come with me for your meeting. Clark, why are you not working?”

 *What a ray of sunshine* thought Clark before replying. 

“I’m gonna sit in on this meeting, I wanna learn more about the company and well, Katy thought it would be good for me to sit in today.”

“Ah alright then, just make sure you’re clocked out. Your uncle will not pay you for dilly-dallying” said Wu. 

Clark and John then followed Wu down the hall. The examination room had a red code door, Clark noticed Wu pull out a purple pass and gestured for them to walk inside. The room looked like your average doctor’s examination room, just even more soulless. Everything was just white and bright. White tile floor, white examination bed, bright white lamp… the room had all the personality of a slice of  bread. Wu told Clark to stand in the corner and listen while John sat on the bed. 

“Oh, does anyone else smell rotten meat? I think someone might have left their lunch in here or somethin’...” pronounced John. 

Clark was about to remark in agreement, but Wu started talking before he could say anything. 

“John Elton, you are seventy-eight years old and live at 104 Aviva lane. You lost your right arm forty years ago while on duty. You now live with your wife, Ophelia, whom you have been married to for fifty-three years. Is all this information about you correct?”

John seemed to have dosed off…

“Sir!” exclaimed Wu. Clark was taken back by his aggressiveness. 

“Oh, uh sorry. It’s just late is all. Yes, that information is correct, sorry doctor” answered John. Wu rubbed his sweaty bald head and handed John some papers to sign. While John read it over, Wu explained the process. 

“Our work here is relatively straightforward, all you are required to do is give some blood and pay. It all starts with your arm. I have many arm molds in the building. I will then use the blood you give to slowly adjust the arm to fit your person. I cannot graft the mold immediately, your body would reject it upon sensing that it is not your own. The rejection of a mold is something to avoid at all cost, the side effects are incredibly painful and irregular. This process will take a minimum of two weeks to finish. When it is done, you come back and we graft the mold onto you. Think of the mold as a blank canvas. As the artist, I must perfect it before giving the work to your person. Do you have any questions?”

Wu had a very straightforward way of speaking. Each sentence felt like a bullet point, like a computer spitting facts as opposed to a person talking. “Oh, uh how do you grow these limbs?” asked John. 

“Our process is irrelevant information to you. Now let's finish these procedures and send you on your way” answered Wu. 

Clark left the room while Wu drew John’s blood and ran other tests. All this information, molds, grafting… it was a lot to think about. Clark too wondered just how exactly SynMed grows these ‘molds’.

After the procedures, Wu escorted John and Clark back to reception. John took a seat while Katy processed the payment. Clark was close enough to hear Wu whisper into Katy’s ear, 

“Make sure John Elton brings a family member to speak on his behalf next time. I will no longer tolerate this buffoon on his own.”

Clark couldn’t understand how Katy could give Wu such a loving look before continuing the payment process. After the day was done, Clark only got more curious about SynMed’s process.

**Chapter 4: Clark**

There was a red sports car with yellow stripes parked in the lot at work today. His uncle must be at the facility! It would be nice to see him. Clark walked into the building and asked Katy if his uncle was here and if he could finally talk to him. 

“Oh, your uncle is in a meeting with Wu, apparently a customer had their mold reject them and now they’re doing paperwork or something on it. Sorry about that, Clarky.”

He responded, “it seems like uncle is avoiding me almost, but I understand how busy this line of work must be…” 

Clark did have the feeling that his uncle was staying away from him. He was never close with him. As smooth as Tom is with people, he doesn’t like them all that much. 

Clark noticed that Katy was looking uncomfortable with that last remark, so he quickly changed the topic. 

“Say, Wu was telling John Elton about this rejection process, what exactly is it?”

“Oh trust me Clarky you don’t want to know. Especially before lunch time”.

Their conversation awkwardly ended there and Clark went to work.

Cleaning helps keep the mind busy, but it can be tiring. A delivery guy showed up with a bunch of anesthetics, Clark directed him towards Wu’s office and then went on lunch. He was resting in the break room, he got a full thirty minutes for lunch and didn’t know how to spend the time. The thought hit him to check out that website that Nancy had told him about. He opened his phone and searched for a Ethical Genetics website. Sure enough it was the top search, it seems it was created by some activist group.

 *This must be similar to PETA or something lame like that* he thought. But when the page was opened he was greeted by a disturbing image. The quality was not the best, but Clark could basically make out what it was. It was a human torso, white as snow, covered in arms. The head was deformed and shrunken into the chest, it seemed to have its eyes precisely sliced out. There were probably twenty arms growing out of this thing's body, all pure white, and oddly enough all right arms. It was suspended in air by a few hooks and had all sorts of tubes with various liquids pouring in and out of the thing. The image’s splash text read,

 **“THIS IS WHAT SYNMED’S ‘MOLDS’ ARE”.**

The image was revolting to say the least, and any little bit of hunger felt on the lunch break was lost. *Surely this can’t be how stuff is grown here, right? This has to be one of those groups that makes fake information and stuff to make people upset* thought Clark. As disturbing as the image was, Clark continued to read the website. According to this Ethical Genetics group, SynMed uses human bodies as the base for the molds and injects a type of formula that causes the growth of whatever body part is needed. He read about the start of the company back in ‘13, how Wu was the mastermind and uncle Tom was the charismatic businessman. There was a whole section on this ‘rejection process’ from witnesses, and he was about to start reading when the door to the break room quickly swung open. 

“Clark! Just what do you think you’re doing in here?” said a smooth voice with a southern accent. 

Clark could recognise that voice anywhere, even after all these years. 

“Uncle Tom? Oh I was just-”

“Just what, huh? Looking at our critic’s website on our wifi? You gotta be kidding me!”

Uncle Tom was furious, and Clark forgot that Nancy told him to be sure to turn wifi off when he searched for the website. 

“Oh, I uh, I’m sorry Unc- I mean, Mr. Roberts. I was just told to give this website a visit and I thought that-”

“Who told you to visit?” Tom asked, while pulling up a chair to sit next to Clark. His voice was calm now, uncle had a way of doing that. His manner could switch from furious to calm in seconds. Clark sat there for a minute, debating if he should rat out Nancy. 

“It’s okay Clark, I’m not mad. Just a little frustrated given the details of this situation, you know?” Tom gave Clark a reassuring pat on the back.

“Just tell me if it was someone here who told you, and all is forgiven, okay champ?”

Clark had to decide between keeping his co-workers secret or upsetting a family member. Heck not just a family member, his boss. The choice was obvious. 

“It was Nancy” replied Clark.

“Good, that’s all I needed to know” Tom rose from his seat and Clark stood also.

 “Christmas break is almost upon us now, and we will be closed from the twenty-fourth until the first of the new year. You will be sure to get a good holiday bonus for being such a good worker, okay champ? Just don't get too curious is all I’m asking” said Tom. 

“All right Uncle, I’m sorry”

“Hey no need to apologize for being curious, I’m just upset I had to see you for the first time here in a situation like this. Tell you what, let’s go grab a beer after work today, what do you say?” 

What he saw on the website truly disturbed him. He wants to keep his uncle happy, but is what's happening here even ethical? Was that thing he saw *alive*? Those would be questions answered another day. The smell of the facility seemed to get stronger when Tom showed up, but Clark tried his best to ignore it and walked out of the room with his uncle.

The decision that Clark made was not just witnessed by himself and Thomas, but by another. The crawler in vents was upset at the young man’s decision. It’s three eyes narrowed in judgment. But all would be well, the matter would be settled come Christmas break. 

It was now the following day. Clark never got that beer with his uncle. Tom canceled at the last minute, citing ‘an emergency work situation’. This upset him, the day was not off to a great start. 

*Just think, this is the last day of work before christmas break. A whole week off! I can do whatever I want until the facility opens again on the first!* Clark thought. As he was walking towards the door he heard a commotion inside. Sounded like someone was yelling. Not wanting to disturb, he waited outside the building where he could partially hear what was going on. It was Katy’s voice all right, and she was furious. Clark had never seen Katy mad, he didn’t even know there was a mean bone in her body. She was yelling at Nancy, who he couldn’t hear making any form of protest. *Oh man, she must be getting chewed out because I told on her…*

This made Clark upset, but he thought, *hey, better her than me. I wasn’t the one who did anything wrong*.

He could tell now that Katy lies, she puts on a kind welcoming face for reception. But she must be a shrill, mean-spirited person on the inside. No wonder she got married to Wu. 

After a minute or two the yelling stopped, and Nancy left the building. It would seem she had packed all of her stuff. She turned around and saw that Clark was listening. However, there wasn’t any anger in her eyes, only tears. 

“It was a mistake ever working here. SynMen provided me with these beautiful blue eyes… I thought that if I could just work here I could help others in need, but then I found out what actually happens here and…”

She was struggling to not break down, so she turned away to her car. Clark called out to her, 

“Hey Nancy, I’m… I’m sorry for ratting you out. I just didn’t want to upset my uncle and I thought that…”

he trailed off as she turned back around. 

“Walk away from this place while you still can Clark. The help we give here… is not worth the suffering of the ones less fortunate…”

Clark watched as the only truly welcoming face at SynMed left. The thought crossed his mind to leave with her, but it was only for a moment. He was working with *family,* not to mention making a pretty penny doing it. Clark’s mind processed what she was saying.

*She must be talking about the molds, but I mean look at all the good this company is doing! Surely SynMed isn’t in the wrong.*

*Right?*
