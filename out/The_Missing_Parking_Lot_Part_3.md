I’m not sure where we ended up that night, now I’m not sure I even want to know.

We went back to the logging ground road and drove through it just like that night a few months ago, only now during the day. Much more confident with daylight, the drive that took us 40 minutes that night took us closer to 20. Our jaws dropped when the end of the logging road presented us with only one right turn.  

It’s not there, the road isn’t there, it doesn't make any sense.

\_\_

After planning it out for 2 months we finally decided on the days to take off from work to go back and check that place out. Thursday and Friday were the days we agreed on with Saturday also off to get a good day's rest. There would probably be too many hikers if we went on the weekend, better chance of having the whole road and lot to ourselves during the week, we thought. 

If that parking lot or road happened to be closed off somehow we were going to sneak in through the forest. No matter what, we were going back to that place. We crossed our fingers hoping we wouldn’t lose reception on our radios and each also took a polaroid camera in hand. We would explore the massive lot separately to cover more ground. With sunlight and no fog we figured it would be a breeze.

We had two main goals in mind: to obtain pictures of that truck and its license plates and to find and photograph anything that might indicate or clarify exactly what that place was. All this of course while not getting caught.       

We rented a pick up truck and headed back to that town. Leaving at 7:30 am we got there a little past 9:30 am. Choosing our routes carefully and with it being a Thursday, there was much less traffic and it pretty much took us an hour less to make the trip. Even during the day the logging ground road was very well obscured by the forest and we almost missed the entrance.

The four signs that served as warnings that night were nothing more than decorations during the day.

Driving in without a second thought the forest closed in on us just like that night, only now instead of tense and anxious I felt peaceful and relaxed. The area was picturesque like driving into a painting.

“I can’t believe this is the same road,” Dario said from the back seat.

“It makes sense why it's so dark at night, with intense shade in this little road during the day, it only gets amplified at night” I said while driving.

“I think this is the area where the elk came up right in front of us,” Andy said from the passenger seat. 

“Yeah I think it ran right out of there” I said pointing to a spot of the forest that came and curved a little closer to the road on our right.

Driving past the first hiking trail, an older couple who happened to be on foot raised an arm to greet us.

 “After all this planning I sure hope some of these hikers don't get in our way, the last thing we need is a nosy Karen or Kyle ruining it for us and notifying the authorities like last time”. Dario said.

“It wouldn’t be them, they seem nice, the old man reminds me of my grandpa” I said, having just waved at them.

“Well they better mind their own business,” Andy replied.

Unfortunately all our planning *would* go to waste, and it wouldn't be because of any hiker.

I turned slightly to the left when we drove by two cars parked on the side of the road. They were parked mostly out of the way in between the forest and the dirt road.

“It looks like we can park anywhere to our right as long as there's enough space on the sides of the road” Andy said looking out his passenger window.

“Interesting that we haven’t lost GPS signal yet” I said, looking at my phone. It was mounted to the dash and had been showing our location mostly uninterrupted since we started the trip. 

“Huh? I still have phone service too. What about you Andy”?  Dario asked, leaning forward to speak to us.

"I also have service, everything is going the complete opposite of how it went last time”. Andy said looking down at his phone.

When we neared the second hiking trail I slowed down and saw that there were many more people out and about, over ten cars were parked on the side of the road. One of the parked cars was a van with a sign posted on its side that read “$5 dollar breakfast burritos”. They had a line of about 6 people.

“ Let's stop and get some breakfast guys, support a local family trying to earn some cash. They got some clientele that's a good sign. I bet those homemade burritos are good.” Dario said.

“I do not want to get food poisoning over 2 hours away from home. Let's just head straight to the lot, eat the sandwiches and snacks we prepared and grab a bite at a legit place after,” I said, continuing forward.

“Hold on this gives me an idea, slow down and park here real quick,” Andy suddenly said pointing to the side of the road.

After I parked Andy loosened his seat belt and faced both me and Dario simultaneously.

“Why don’t we try to ask the locals if they know of any RV parks or rest stops nearby, you know, get the scoop from somebody that lives here and likely knows of that lot and what it could be” Andy suggested.

Dario and I liked the idea and we all agreed to keep conversations as nonchalant as possible.

We each got out of the car and headed in separate directions, trying to talk to different people.

I headed towards a group that were eating in their car with their windows open. They had clearly been off-roading.

“Hey how’s it going man you guys around these parts often?” I asked the man with his elbow hanging out the driver seat window.

“Yeah man we live about 30 min away, why whats up?” He then asked me.

“Would you guys know of any big rest stops nearby? Me and my friends are scoping out the place and planning on coming back and renting an RV. Are There any places where we can park our cars and RV within the next few miles? We are trying to stay as close to this beautiful hiking road as possible” I asked.

“Nah man not nearby, there's a Walmart that allows people to spend the night in their parking lot but that’s like 20 min away. All nearby campgrounds are Tent-only. There are no places to park such a large vehicle anywhere near here.” He replied.

“I believe there's an RV park on the north edge of town, that's almost an hour away from here though” A guy sitting on the back seat added.

"That’s good to know I appreciate it. We’ll be sure to plan our RV trip a little better. You guys have a nice day” I said.

“You as well, good luck with that” the guy sitting on the driver side said, a few nodded their heads and continued eating their burritos. 

I then walked towards the van selling the breakfast burritos and heard Andy mid conversation with some hikers who were waiting in line.

“ -out there’s only one way, whoever told you there were two ways to go gave you wrong directions. This road ends at a closure, the other road that starts at a hard right turn is one you can use to head out of town, but to go back into town you need to head straight back. There is no other way to go.” I heard one of the hikers finish telling Andy.

“Appreciate the clarification” I then heard Andy tell the three hikers before looking over to me in a tight browed expression.

All the people we spoke to had nothing different to tell us, just like GPS systems, even the locals had no idea and never heard of such a road or lot.

I couldn’t help but feel a certain level of unease when we walked back to our car.

“All these people are nuts,” Dario said, sitting back in the car. “The couple I spoke to don’t know a thing. Clearly there's something right under their noses and they don’t have the slightest clue or knowledge of it.” he said putting the big burrito he bought in our lunchbox.

“If they don’t know of it we’ll likely have the whole place to ourselves, better chance of not getting caught. Hopefully the place is as deserted as it was that night”. Andy said, opposing Dario's pessimism.

“With a lot of that size, I find it hard to believe there isn't somebody on guard at all times” I said, still expecting to have to sneak in.

“I don’t know, let's just get this over with and check that place out” Dario said frustrated.

I then turned the car on and we continued down the dirt road for a few more miles. The end of the current road and road split were just out of view. After driving through the last bend it all finally came into perspective, the end of the current road and a singular tight right hand turn.

 I felt my hands tighten on the steering wheel.

It was not two like that night, only one turn came up on our right. I hit the brakes and looked straight ahead not believing what I was seeing. There were trees and tall foliage where the other road should have been, no sign of another road ever being there. 

We all looked at each other wide eyed and shocked, unable to say a word.

“Let’s get out of the way before another car comes behind us” Dario finally said looking out the rear window, we had been spacing out in the middle of the road for a few seconds.

I swerved to the right and parked the truck on the side of the road, facing the entrance to where the other road should be. We sat in the car for a few minutes still looking straight ahead processing what we were seeing and what we had seen 2 months ago.

I know the three of us were thinking about and wondering exactly what the hell we had stumbled into that night, but It was unexplainable and there was no other way to put it.

“There’s no fucking way!” Andy unexpectedly said loudly, opening the passenger door and walking out.

Dario and I were trying to keep our composure. We both stepped out of the car and followed after Andy.

Andy was a few feet away looking towards the forest at the big trees that should not be there, trees that weren't there the night *he* drove.

“This is crazy, we made all the preparations for nothing, did all three of us imagine that shit or something?!” Andy asked, looking down at the grass, putting his hands in his pockets in frustration.

Neither me or Dario said a word.

“You guys see that,” Dario said abruptly. He was glancing at a very well obscured trail that happened to be about 20 feet from where we stood. When we walked over to it we noticed it headed in the same general direction of the absent road.

“It looks like it heads the same way, should we check it out? I mean, we need some content after making that 2 hour drive” Dario asked, seemingly ready to commit to the hike.

“This whole area is something else, I don’t think we should go into the forest. Hell, I don’t think we should spend the night and camp anywhere near here like we planned to do”. I said.

“What do you suggest we do then, just give up and head back home”? Dario then asked.

I didn’t know what to say, we had stumbled into something paranormal in nature. As Urban Explorers we fantasize about stumbling into anything out of the ordinary or unexplainable, but this was a little much to take in.

The three of us were in our thoughts for a while until a car came into view and we proceeded to act like nothing was wrong.

It was a family of at least four, they were riding in a big truck towing a camper trailer. They slowed down when we came into view.

“You guys good”? I heard the driver ask out of the open passenger window leaning forward to speak past his female passenger. 

“Yeah umm we are just taking it all in, it’s a beautiful area” Dario answered.

“It really is” the man replied “If you’re thinking of hiking that trail there keep in mind it is a long one but definitely worth it, it ends at an unbelievably wide natural open field. We hiked it a few years back, just be prepared”. He said.

“Where are you guys headed, is there a rest stop nearby”? I heard Andy ask without missing a beat.

“We *are* headed to a rest stop, it isn't anywhere near here though about an hour away actually” The man answered.

“Well thanks for the heads up we are just gonna hang around for a bit” Andy then said.

“Take care now keep in mind this area tends get dark real quick” we heard the man say as we watched his truck take the tight turn and continue down that road.

“So no one knows anything about that lot we stumbled into” Dario said after exhaling through his lips in frustration.

“I want to see this road again before we head back home. There's gotta be a way to make it reappear. I don’t want to necessarily drive in it, I just want us to have some kind of proof that we didn't imagine all of that. Just for our sake.” Andy said decidedly.

“What are you suggesting, that we come back at night again or something?” I asked.

“Is there any other way?, I can’t think of anything else to do besides that, we owe it to ourselves and those teens to come back and figure this whole shit out” Andy answered.

“I’m game if you guys are, we all agreed that we would not leave empty handed like last time. This isn’t a whole lot more different than sneaking in like we planned, is it?” Dario replied.

As dumb as it was, we needed to figure out what it was that made this road appear. How do we make it reappear? What did we do? How did we manage to end up in a place that doesn't exist?

We were not completely convinced that simply driving through the logging ground road at night would make it all reappear, if that was the case more people would know of it. We were giving this a shot more so because we were out of options. You don’t exactly have a lot of people to ask for advice when dealing with something so strange.

The three of us were in and would be ready to go by the time night fell.

Time flew by and we spent over 4 hours hiking the two trails on the logging ground road. Taking it slow to kill time, we filmed and took pictures while making the trek. All the walking worked up our appetite and we went through our days worth of food supply right after.

The remaining hours of sunlight were spent going over footage and resting in the car at a nearby campground. Before the trees engulfed the last bit of sunlight we drove to the closest gas station for refreshments. We also restocked on batteries for our flashlights while we were there.

By the time we were driving back it was already night time. Once again driving towards the logging ground road we noticed the night was much brighter than the first night we drove through. The full moon produced light that illuminated the forest. 

The entrance was much less intimidating thanks to the brightness of the night and the drive wasn’t any different. The dirt road was easily visible thanks to our headlights and the absence of fog. We also never lost phone service, not until the end of the road.

When we could finally see where the road ends everything seemed to be exactly like that morning, a single right turn again. The other road was still not there like we had hoped. Only difference was as I parked as close as possible to where the missing road should be, we lost phone reception. 

Leaving the headlights on for backup, we each got out of the car with our flashlights in hand walking in the direction of the missing road. Dario tried taking photos on his camera and Andy tried doing the same on his phone. They both malfunctioned in much the same way as last time.

“There's something here, we are very close, we lose signal but why only in this area now”? Andy asked out loud, pointing to the area where the other road should be. He then started tugging and pushing on a few trees that happened to be in place of the road.

“What are we missing”? I asked, trying to stay within the confines of the dirt and gravel the logging ground road happened to run over.

“Hold on now is our chance to test our polaroids and see if they are affected by the signal loss,” Dario said excitedly. He walked to the car and came back holding one of the retro cameras in his hand, the familiar rainbow stripe that ran across it vertically seemed to glow thanks to the car's headlights. 

He then proceeded to take a picture of us and the forest right in front of where the other road would’ve been, the flash blinded me for a few seconds. He set the developing picture face down on the hood as we continued waiting and thinking of other possible ways to make this road appear.

“What did we do differently that night”!? I asked loudly. 

Dario walked back towards us looking down at his phone.

“Well we are actually early, the night we drove through here it was around 8:45 pm it is currently 8:12 pm.” Dario said, still looking at his phone.

“You guys think the exact time matters”? I then asked.

“It makes sense, the best thing we can do now is try to replicate everything we did that night” Andy said emphasizing what Dario had just mentioned.

Deciding to wait in the car we walked back and stepped inside our vehicle. Dario grabbed the picture from the hood and examined it in the back seat after turning on the truck's interior lights.

“Oh man you guys gotta see this,” Dario said, handing me the photo.

I looked at the photo closely and saw that a section of trees and foliage behind me and Andy were almost see-through. You could just barely make out the entrance to the absent road behind the vegetation. Under normal circumstances one would have thought the camera had simply malfunctioned.

“What the hell, that's crazy,” I said, handing Andy the photo.

“Holy shit now that's scary, but interesting… so I guess the road both is and isn’t there. Those trees in the way are solid. Is all that foliage about to disappear before our eyes?” Andy asked, examining the photo.

With nothing else to do but wait we sat in the car expecting to be allowed to wait the remaining 30 minutes. The chill in the air was making me fall asleep, so I turned off the truck's headlights and decided to take a quick nap.

I was suddenly awoken by Dario 20 minutes later. He was budging my shoulder from the back seat, both me and Andy had fallen asleep while he had only laid down in the back cab.

“Guys wake up, there's a car coming” he said. 

“Damn it, what should we do!?” Andy asked, still frustrated and not thinking straight after having just woken up.

I rubbed my eyes and turned on the car trying to think of something.

“Let's pretend we got lost, took a wrong turn or something. Let me turn the car around” I said, making a U- turn.

“Better not be a fucking cop like last time” I heard Andy say just loud enough for me to hear.

“Looks like a truck,” Dario said, looking ahead in between Andy and I. The car was closing in on us and we could tell from its headlights that it was definitely a truck or SUV.

I moved forward slowly while the vehicle came towards us at a much faster speed one would expect. For somebody to drive like that on a rural road; they definitely knew the area I thought to myself.

As It got closer we saw it was a white truck hauling an empty flatbed car trailer. The driver side window was being rolled down as the truck slowed and approached us.

I followed and also rolled down my window as our cars met heading opposite ways.

“You lost er Something!?” The driver loudly asked out his window.

“Yeah man I don’t know where we ended up but we’re headed back the way we came” I said lying to the man. I suddenly recognized him when I said that, his dog looked over to us from the back window.

“Well y'all better be careful this area ain’t exactly safe at night, unless you're a local who knows the region I’d say avoid this road at all cost, ya hear. I've heard and seen of a fair share of accidents that have happened in this little road, best to avoid it completely” He added.

“Will do, thanks” I then said.

Before we started moving again Andy who had not yet recognized the man asked him a question.

“Are you helping out somebody that broke down this late at night? I see you’re ready to tow?” Andy asked.

“Umm uhh.. yeah a buddy o’ mine broke down, can’t seem to get his damn car to turn back on. I'm cutting through this here road to get to 'em sooner.” The man answered.

“Good luck with that man, we’ll be on our way now thanks” I said, breaking the conversation, afraid he would recognize us soon.

The man nodded his head and raised an arm in farewell, I drove out of there as fast as possible. Looking through our rear view mirror I noticed he never moved. He was still parked in the same spot we spoke to him when I finally lost sight of him through the trees. 

“What are the odds?” I asked loudly, almost laughing.

“Yo Andy, did you not recognize him?” I heard Dario ask from the backseat.

“Recognize who, what are you guys talking about?” Andy asked us.

“That was the heavy set junkyard owner, the dog that attacked us was in the back seat” I mentioned.

“No fucking way, I didn’t even notice the dog, for real!?” Andy asked perplexed. 

“Yeah man you’re over here trying to be all friendly and start a conversation with him, we were trying to get out of there before he recognized us”. Dario said laughing.

“That's my bad, I guess I’m still asleep” Andy said, cracking up.

“So what's the plan now are we coming back?” Dario asked.

“Yeah, tomorrow night for sure let's avoid that road tonight I do not want to run into that man again” I said, and they agreed. 

We then hit up a local fast food place for dinner while Dario ate the big breakfast burrito he bought that morning. It was safe to eat and very good because he wouldn't shut up about it and never got sick. 

With camping still out of the question we decided to stay somewhere to wash up and get some rest. We split the bill and spent the night at the closest decent looking hotel. Being the driver I called dibs on one of the two beds while Andy slept on the other and Dario reluctantly extended the sofa bed after losing to Andy in a dice game.

We woke up fairly early Friday morning to take advantage of the free breakfast the hotel offered. Talking about what we’d do differently while we ate, there was one thing for certain, we would not head over there until after 8pm. Dario also sensed something was up with the man from the junkyard when we stumbled into him, the three of us wondered what exactly he was doing driving through there at night.

Andy looked up the man’s junkyard on his phone and we realized we weren’t that far from it, actually we were about 35 minutes away according to one route. It suddenly seemed less odd that we had run into him. I guess the heavy forest and winding roads made it hard to tell we were so close to where it all went down. 

 Hanging out in the hotel room for another 2 hours we were out of there at noon. 

Cruising around for most of the day we checked out interesting stores and spots that were aimed towards tourists to kill time. Growing increasingly bored and out of things to do we decided to go out of our way and drive by the Junkyard to feed our curiosity.

It was a dumb idea but we were in a different vehicle and we agreed we would not step out of the car, we would simply drive past it. A little more relaxed when we saw he was not home, I turned the car around to get a better look and quickly head back the way we came if he happened to show up. 

I found it interesting that the confines of the junkyard were much more condensed with more old cars and auto parts covered with tarps layered throughout. In the 2 months we had been waiting to come back I would say the junkyard had almost doubled its inventory. 

This man had been busy. We also saw he now had three dogs on guard, the one that attacked Andy and two that we did not recognize. Dario took a few pictures of the premises from inside the truck.

We were back in the direction of the logging ground road by the time the sun was beginning to set. With just over an hour left until we would drive through it again, we would try to wait in the same campsite as the day before.  

The night was oddly beginning to look very similar to the first night we drove through 2 months ago. It was now getting cloudy and the temperature had dropped at least 15 degrees in the last 2 hours. Fog was also beginning to form at a rapid pace and the darkness of the forest was increasing drastically.

For nearby campers this might've been bad news but for us it meant everything was working in our favor, the weather was almost identical to that night, it was now up to us to replicate what we did back then. 45 minutes after impatiently waiting in the campsite we finally headed back. 

Admittedly getting excited and going over everything we did that night and how we would try to repeat it, our conversation suddenly came to a halt when we drove past the junkyard owner again. The logging ground road was only a few miles away from us, this was no longer a coincidence, we were sure he was coming back from there.

Driving his familiar white truck, we saw he was towing an old yellow VW Beetle when he drove past us.

“What the? Yo that Volkswagen"! Andy suddenly said loudly

“What”? I asked confused

“That Beetle!” he repeated. “That Beetle was in that parking lot!” He finally clarified.

“Wait, what, really? Are you sure?” Dario asked him.

“Yeah, I learned how to drive in one of those, the same color just not as old. I remember thinking that when I was driving through the cars and fog that night, I don’t really see yellow Beetles very often.” Andy replied. 

“So what are you thinking? That he knows of that place?” Dario then asked. 

“He’s got to know something, there's too many coincidences, we stumbled into him in the logging ground road at night acting all shady, and now this.” Andy said, clearly convinced. 

“Hold on, one thing at a time we need to figure this whole thing out. Now's our chance to drive through this road and see what happens. If he was really just in that parking lot I don't think he’s coming back anytime soon” I said trying to stay focused. 

I turned on the truck's high beams just as we approached the logging ground road. Visibility was bad although not as bad as the first night we drove through, at least not yet.

I entered the dirt road without hesitating and hit the gas.

“We got no service boys, everything is falling in place” I heard Dario say after checking his phone.

“Wait, wait, slow down, we need to do everything as precisely as possible. Remember, I was going less than 20mph for the first few miles until the elk came up in front of us.” Andy said, beginning to go into detail of how he drove that night.

I slowed down and continued steadily forward, I hit the brakes when we got to the stretch of road where the elk came up in front of us. I completely stopped for a few minutes while Dario took pictures of the general area where the elk would’ve been. I then honked and continued on even slower than before, as instructed by Andy.

Dario enthusiastically confirmed the photos he had just taken weren’t saved. If the missing path didn’t show itself at the end of the road after our interpretation of that night, then we would be out of options, out of ideas, out of our minds.

I followed and did everything as close as possible to what Andy detailed and we remembered. The road looked exactly the way it did the night we stumbled into that parking lot, the darkness that seemed to blend the trees and night sky, the fog, the dust coming up and affecting our visibility, even the time. Everything seemed to match. 

We truly believed that the rules and steps *we* had come up with would make this road reappear. 

Unfortunately it didn’t seem to work. It felt like it had happened dozens of times before, we were once again dumbfounded in the middle of that road. Thinking of other ways, I was mentally grasping at anything that came to mind.

Suddenly I remembered something, something we forgot to do.

I started switching the car headlights on and off a few times the shadows of the trees and foliage seemed to dance in front of us.

“What are you doing?” Andy asked, watching me fiddle with the lever.

“You did this to make the elk get off the road, remember?” “How many times?” I then asked him.

“Oh yeah, you are right, umm 2 or three times i think.” he said trying to remember.

I moved the switch up and down twice and nothing. I then moved the switch up and down three times each and froze.

We all looked ahead and grew silent, even the crickets and cicadas seemed to cease. 

The road had just appeared and the entrance was now in front of us.
