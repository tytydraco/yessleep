Times are tough, they say.
 
 
I've heard that a hell of a lot in my life. I've slept on sidewalks, using sheets of cardboard to shield myself from the sun. I've been robbed at knifepoint while living at a shelter.
 
 
Until recently, I lived in a share house with six flatmates, but I was never formally on the lease and they kicked me out when I couldn't afford the rent increase.
 
 
Thankfully, I'd directed my small trickle of cash flow to train as an elevator technician. A solid trade. Something I could do with my own two hands–something no one could take from me.
 
 
So after my last job for the day, a run-of-the-mill hotel in Mott Haven, I simply never left. I just stayed in the maintenance room. I'd fixed the elevator, so they had no reason to go investigating, and who were they gonna call? Me? 


I plumped up my backpack as a makeshift pillow and hunkered down for the night. I didn't mind sleeping on the floor; the concrete was cool to the touch. In one corner of the room was an exposed pipe, which I stuffed with an old shirt. Experience taught me something nasty like rats or cockroaches were apt to crawl out of there.
 

The hardest part about sleeping in the maintenance room was the beeping.
 
 
All night the elevator would ring. Even at odd hours, like three o’clock in the morning. I figured there'd been an event on–a party hosted in one of the rooms.
 
 
It didn’t pass. *Ding. Ding. Ding.* Every night.

 
When the elevator moved during these hours, it sounded like it was moving down.
 
 
I had access to the whole MCP form; that's a piece of documentation detailing the whole elevator shaft.The maintenance room was on the ground floor, and there were no basement floors listed–at least none on file.
 
 
I brushed it off as acoustics–how the sound bounced off the concrete walls–but the sound was particularly annoying in its persistence. At least when sleeping on the street, all the sounds merged into one.
 
 
There were new sounds too: glasses clinking together, cutlery scratching plates, a cat–or some sort of wild animal–yowling.
 
 
Tired and cranky, I traced the sounds and found they were loudest near the pipes. I removed the old shirt I'd stuffed down the exposed hole and it became clear. People were having dinner–a party–and it was coming from below.
 
 
Still, the room was safe, and I could stick a wrench through the door handle to stop people getting in. No sun to scorch my skin, no rain to turn the walls soggy until they collapsed on top of me.
 
 
When livin’ is tough, you learn pretty quickly to accept things as they are and not push your luck.
 
 
So I plodded on, ignoring the sounds. People came and went, visiting the basement dining room at inappropriate hours. If I pressed my ear against the door, I could hear them talking. One night there had been a heavy, wet plod, and then a man said,
 
 
“Quiet, piggy.”
 
 
The smells would drift up from the pipe, and I hadn't smelt any pork that night–more like minced veal and a bitter stench like too much garlic.
 
 
In the early hours of the morning, when I snuck out to go to work, there were brown stains like machine oil streaking the floor, leading right to the elevator doors.
 
 
It pissed me off more than anything. Here I was living in a cell while they dined lavishly.
 
 
The other night, there were two men speaking outside the door.
 
 
"Is the meal prepared for tonight?"
 
 
"Yes, a full course. Caught fresh."
 
 
"And the tools?"
 
 
"Sharpened."
 
 
They chuckled to themselves as the elevator arrived, and I listened to their voices drift off.
 
 
Drift down.
 
 
Coincidentally, my job the next day was at this very hotel. I dipped out amidst the morning rush, when the front desk staff were overwhelmed and wouldn't notice. After pretending to park my van, the hotel manager greeted me in the lobby.
 
 
“Back so soon?” He drawled.
 
 
I recognized the voice immediately; I'd heard it just last night. “What can I say? This lift sees a lot of use.” He raised an eyebrow, so I followed up. “This place must fit a hundred, a hundred and fifty guests.” 
 
 
“About so, yes.”
 
 
He left me at the elevators and I went to work on the issue; a twelfth floor button that wouldn’t register when pressed. A simple enough problem. We get about one a week. I’d coordinated with the in-house maintenance team to shut down the power until I was done.
 
 
Halfway through the job, the elevator doors suddenly rattled shut.
 
 
“Hey–what the fuck?”
 
 
The elevator started moving, and although no buttons were lit up, I could feel that it was moving down.
 
 
The doors opened onto near-total darkness. In the centre of the room was a long, glass table. The type you see in an executive boardroom. The table was set entirely in glass—plates, cups, even knives thin as broken window shards. Above the table were three hooks. Glass hooks.
 
 
Before I could see more, the doors closed again, and the elevator shifted back up to the ground floor.
 
 
I stumbled out into the lobby, a little dazed. The hotel manager was speaking with some guests in fancy suits. He spotted me and excused himself.
 
 
"Is it all fixed?”
 
 
"Almost. I just need to grab a screwdriver from my van.”
 

I already had my tools with me but I needed to grab something else from my van. An inflatable mattress, that I could blow up once I was done with the job.
 
The elevators had cameras. If I reported anything, they’d see it was me. I’m in no position to help anyone. I just need a place to sleep.
 
 
And truth be told? I’ve slept through worse.
