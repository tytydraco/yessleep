People are cynical, and I love that. I blame putting stand up comedians on Television. 

So we’re clear, I think it works by publicly saying *‘this THIS right here is the damn issue*.’ However, being able to laugh it off makes the need to fix the issue *go away.*



Punk rock effectively does the same. Because no one reads the lyrics.



I digress.



My name is Clemintine. I go by Clem though. I’m no one special, just a vampire. I live my life when most of you are asleep. I’m not here to call you out on poor sleep routines. I’m here mostly to tell you my story. 

My life is mostly boring. I was born in 1942 which means some of my friends are still alive somewhere.



I wake up, I drink, I go to work. Luckily, work provides leftovers which provides me with breakfast for the next day. Waste not, want not was my family’s motto. My mama swore by it, and now so do I. It actually helps me keep a low profile.



My mama cleaned houses during the war while my dad was gone and she kept that job when I was growing up because dad liked alcohol. (We’re not here to discuss that, although that’s its own horror.)



The thing I guess you really need to know about me is I was changed, or embraced for fancy people like to say, in 1965. I liked it fine enough. I had no idea my boyfriend at the time was actually about 700 years old 



Oops.



I learned pretty quickly that I still needed to survive as a vampire, especially because my boyfriend thought that he was gonna be a rockstar, but he never learned how to write any songs or book himself anywhere. Another horrendous oops on my part.



I got hooked up with the mob in LA because I was always looking for work and always graveyard shift. 

I was a coat check girl. The boss always knew that I was looking for extra money so one night when there was a little bit of a problem in the back room I was given a mop and a bucket and told to get to work.



That's what I’ve been doing, mostly, since then.



In case you’re wondering, I left the loser boyfriend in LA and moved up to the Pacific Northwest to a place called Kitten County (name changed duh) not because there was a hell of a lot of mob activity out here, but it was easy enough for me to get back to LA and there was a few serial killers out here who were smart enough to employ help .



Believe me, I don’t feel good about helping these people, but the lives were lost whether I clean it up or not and, as for the leftovers, I can take them home. No, don’t get me wrong, I’m not a ghoul. However, sometimes it’s nice to have a little meat with your blood. Besides, one of my fortunate powers is that I can effectively turn humans into mush.



So I, having an effective cleaning method, first take the body to the bathroom and start draining most of its blood. To drain all a body’s blood does take longer to do, I can’t do it all during a cleaning session. While I’m waiting for that I get to work cleaning. That's the actual part where I use an industrial cleaner and a mop and bucket, of course wearing gloves. I can’t burn my hands on solvents and caustic cleaning agents, but it does hurt a lot..



After everything is clean, I go back and I make sure that my two big giant water jugs are filled. Remember, I never take more than I can eat in a day. That’s a good rule for any of you other vampires that might be reading.



It would be gross if I were to explain how I make a body into a pulp. I’m sure you could imagine it, however what happens is worse. Let’s just say I don’t quite take the gloves off yet and once a body is effectively flushed down the drain there it goes.  Again, I’m not trying to sound proud of my work or even glib that people died.



I just know these types of people. 



Most of them would kill whether people like me existed or not.



I mean, look at true crime, if they have someone like me helping they’d probably still be free. And I’ve called in tips IF my client goes too far.  I’m not happy about this. Most of the people I work for are terrible people, and if you don’t know how to tip properly, I am going to make it your problem.

This is, in my opinion, the most ethical way I could survive. And that’s all my life is right now surviving.

I haven’t had friends or lovers in quite some time. However, maybe that’s just my luck in life.

I mean, I’m sure I could pick people up at a bar, but by the time I’m done with work I’m too tired to even think. 



I just go home to my abandoned gas station. I lived in the mart part, around the fridges, where I put my bottles, and crawl into my coffin. Where, because of the growth of technology (huge fan, by the way), I can binge watch Gossip Girl to my heart's content. Til sunrise, when I drift into slumber.



So perhaps, next time you think of all vampires as being sexy and rich. Remember, we have jobs just like everyone else. 

Also, I would like to leave you with the note that not every girl with brightly colored hair wants to be cat-called. Sometimes we have a job to get to and you are just making our day easier because who’s gonna turn down a free hot meal.
