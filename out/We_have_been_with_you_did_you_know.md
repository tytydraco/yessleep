My name is Kent and this is why humanity won't be seeing the year 2040   
Disclaimer my real name is not Kent but humans don’t understand my species' language so it will have to do. I'd like to say I am not a part of your planet but I have been trying to help you and your planet but your world leaders are not happy with us and have been trying to stop us at every turn.   
Your planet is currently in the process of what we call purging. It happens when a species takes too much from the mother of that specific planet, you may know her as mother earth or Gaia. We are known as the ARGO crew and have been orbiting Earth since February 21st of 1945. We have met with all presidents of every nation great or small but see your presidents are not the problem it's the people behind them that are.   
Everything is not what you think it is and I'm gonna need you to listen closely, your presidents are like puppets for a group of humans who think of themselves as the elite. They have been running the world since the government was created since kings and queens lived. As long as there's a parliament they were behind them making every decision and making it seem like it was your idea all along.  
There are good ones or I should say were good ones most were killed off because they went against the grain of their highest demands. What are their highest demands, you may ask who is the mysterious them?   
Well, the elite is more elite than most humans because they have abilities most of the human populace has lost. They see everything through the threads of energy that make up our very existence. Matter, space, and time are all the same thread of energy and can be easily manipulated and used to help the populace or cripple them to their knees.  
 I'm sure you can tell which path this group has chosen; however, manipulating energy threads isn’t as simple as it sounds; it has a sort of ripple effect among the entire universe. So when one path is changed it changes for all of us and most of the time the threads they are pulling are destruction, poverty, chaos, jealousy, envy, and my favorite fear.   
My species overcame fear a long time ago. It's a sickness that embeds itself deep within your mind and spreads and devours you if you don't cure it. Most humans think it is an emotion due to being taught that. Little do you know it is just one of the many things that's hindering your ability to see the world properly. Your water is highly lethal to most species because of what is inside of it. It's a mineral that's used to deactivate your brain's pineal gland or severely hinder it from functioning properly. For us, this is just another form of death because you are completely cut off from the source that your body energizes off of and you can no longer help yourselves or protect yourselves physically and astrally.   
When we first came to this planet we gave governments some of our technology turns out that wasn't such a great idea. Many of what you call scientists have taken our technology and turned them into massively destructive weapons. No one else has these weapons except for these groups of people.   
Some of them are in the Antarctic creating earthquakes all over the globe along with floods and other horrific natural disasters that leave many living creatures dead.  
Here on the ARGO, we call those groups Reapers. We have been trying to get those weapons back seeing as they are a million years too advanced for human minds. But we have been unsuccessful in those attempts. See there are laws we have to follow and we don't want to scare all of you to death so we follow them strictly but it's getting to a point where the Galactic Federation is considering dismantling those laws for the earth. That would mean war with the entire human species because half of you don’t even want to accept our existence but you need to because when we do come it won't be for you and you have no reason to be afraid we are coming for your world leaders and the reaper groups. I'm writing this to you in hopes you will listen to what I have to say and it won't turn into a war but the decision is yours.
