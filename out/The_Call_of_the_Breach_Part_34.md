[\[Part 35\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1juy5bm/the_call_of_the_breach_part_35/)

Around me, the team froze in place, and I blinked.

“What . . . what are you doing here?” I shook my head in disbelief.

Grapeshot’s eyes were red, as if he hadn’t slept for a long time, with scorch marks on his coat sleeves where he’d scrambled over burning growth just to reach the tower window. “Where is she?”

Chris flicked the safety off on his rifle and narrowed both eyes at the pirate. “Does anyone have a shot?”

“I do.” His grip tightened on the pistol, and Grapeshot’s face contorted into a fierce snarl. “One I won’t miss. You move an inch, and she’s dead.”

Down the stairs from us, the gunfire increased as our enemy continued to throw themselves into the teeth of our rear guard. Any minute now the Puppets could break through and clamber up the stairs or follow Grapeshot’s climb through the vines outside. We needed to get moving, but the pirate captain had me squarely in his sights.

From behind me, Peter stepped forward, one empty hand raised, the other grasping his rifle. “Sam, you have to listen to me—”

“No.” Grapeshot clenched his teeth so hard I thought they might crack. “I don’t. You let them do this, Peter. You let them take her away.”

*He’s crazy. There’s no way we can reason with him, not in this state. But if someone shoots, and he squeezes the trigger in reflex . . .*

I swallowed, tasted the blood from where I’d split my lip, and eyed Chris. He was focused on the captain, ready to spring the instant Grapeshot let his guard down, but I knew Chris wouldn’t be fast enough. Adam held his sword, while Jamie palmed her Beretta, wearing the same deadly scowl as Chris. They were ready to leap to my defense, but no one could beat the speed of a bullet. If I wanted to come out of this alive, I had to think fast.

“I can take you to her.” Meeting his manic gaze, I nodded slowly at the captain and pointed up the concrete steps. “She’s at the top of the tower. Just put the gun down and we’ll go find her together.”

Under our feet, the cold cement shuddered as something enormous hit the tower, and from the blood-curdling screech outside, I figured it to be one of the Osage Wyverns swooping in for a kill. We didn’t have much time left, and every second wasted here was one Tarren could not afford to lose.

“Why would I believe you?” His eyes darted wildly around our group, and Grapeshot searched for Tarren among us as if we might have her tucked in our pockets. “You’re not one of us. You don’t understand.”

“But I do.” Peter stepped closer to him, and I noticed he also moved to the side so that more of his torso was between the captain’s gun and myself. “I’m your first mate, always have been. We fought that storm off Golgotha Bay together, we killed those giant crawfish by the southern coast together, we stole that grayback supply truck together. Remember that?”

Something flickered in the captain’s dark eyes, a glimmer of recognition, and his hardened gaze slipped for a moment. “We found those sweet rolls . . . gave em to the whole crew . . . did it for Greg’s birthday . . .”

Peter’s face bore a sad, whimsical half smile. “We both gave up our share to make sure everyone got a taste. It’s always been that way, for you and for me, ever since the start. You don’t have to do this, Sam.”

The end of the flintlock pistol trembled with uncertainty, and the captain’s breathing grew faster, shallower, as if a force deep inside him threatened to break free. It welled up in his eyes, and for a split second, I looked into his irises and saw it.

Pain.

Loneliness.

Grief.

For the first time since being on the *Harper’s Vengeance*, I saw the boy behind the mask of the pirate, someone not much younger than myself, who lost everything he ever had. I saw the regret, the shame, the crushing sense of horror at what he’d done, who he’d become. Sam didn’t want to be this way, I could sense it. The human behind the costume, under the bravado, past the faux accent and the sword wanted it to end. He wanted his friends to be safe. He wanted to come home.

*If it had been me in his shoes, would I have ended up the same? The violence, the drinking, the suspicion, how much of it was necessary to stay alive? He wants to protect Tarren; he always wanted to protect them all.*

As quick as it had come, the doubt succumbed under a black tide of resentment, and his expression crusted over with renewed fury. Sparks danced in his eyes, the mania resurfaced, and Grapeshot threw me a look of pure loathing.

“*We* are all *we* need.” He growled and aimed down the long barrel of his gun at my forehead.

My heart stopped, the others tensed, and out of the corner of my eye, I caught the twitch of Chris’s rifle barrel preparing to snap up for the final shot.

Grapeshot’s finger tightened on the trigger.

Peter moved in a blur, and to my terror, threw himself in front of me.

*Click.*

Even amidst the cacophony outside, the sound of the flintlock hammer ramming home was deafening in the stairwell. Everyone flinched, stone-cold in their shoes with anticipation, but as the seconds wore on, the truth dawned on me.

*The rain, it soaked his gunpowder.*

Beside himself with frustration at the malfunction, Grapeshot dropped the useless gun and reached for his cutlass.

Relief flashed across Chris’s face, and he moved to bring his rifle up, but a hand reached out to block his barrel.

“Go.” Peter bore an expression of stoney determination and slung his rifle to draw the sword from his back. “All of you. I’ll follow after.”

Adam hefted his sword and frowned. “Peter, we can’t—”

“It’s my fight, preacher.” The words weren’t spoken with any disdain or sarcasm, but a genuine finality that brooked no opposition, and Peter kept his eyes on Grapeshot as they two squared up across the small cement landing. “God may have started this, but I have to finish it. *Go*.”

Chris, Jamie, and Adam looked to me, waiting for my reaction.

Heart pounding in my chest, I met Peter’s grim look with a stunned nod. He’d been willing to die for me, even if the gun hadn’t gone off, and now I had to leave him to face this fight alone. It felt wrong in every metric, but I could tell Peter didn’t want this any other way.

*I saved him from the noose, only to leave him like this?*

“Let’s go.” I headed up the stairs, but let the others go around me so I could pause just before the landing fell out of view.

Blades flashed, and both pirates threw themselves at each other with a ferocity that took my breath away. Steel rang in the cold cement tower as their swords clashed, sparks flying in the darkness from how hard the blows were. Captain Grapeshot had clearly used up the rest of his gunpowder weapons just to get to the tower and wielded his cutlass like a madman in great, strong swings. Peter, however, had plenty of bullets left for his menagerie of modern guns, but refused to so much as touch them; his face a sheet of cold focus as he sparred agile and fast. They moved with fluid precision, parrying, cutting, thrusting, a whirlwind of metal and seething hatred. Sometimes the metal found its mark, and blood spattered onto the walls around them, neither combatant giving ground as they hacked at each other, groaning in pain. Despite this, both shouted at one another at the top of their lungs in fury, but from how far up the steps I was, and with the battle still raging outside, I could only catch bits and pieces of it.

“Liar!”

“Traitor!”

A tight grip closed over my arm, and I turned to find Jamie’s morose face enclosed in the shadows. “Come on, we have to keep moving.”

Guilt weighed on me like a ton of bricks, but I dashed with Jamie up the stairs, even as the sounds of the duel reverberated in my eardrums with every step.

Towards the top of the steps, we came across a section of the wall that had been destroyed some time ago, a massive hole that allowed us to look out over the clearing as we went. Some of the rubble lay scattered around the landing adjacent to it, and as I clambered over the broken concrete, fragments of painful memory rippled through my mind.

*“Can’t stay here.”* A man’s voice, hoarse and weary, grunted in the dark, and I saw in my mind’s eye a face white with pain. *“You can’t stay.”*

Surfacing from within the memory I felt the cold, wet fabric of his uniform shirt as Madison pressed her face to his collarbone and shook her head like a stubborn child. *“I’m not going without you.”*

Dizziness spun in my skull, and I looked down to find a tattered black trucker cap under my left boot, a sight that sent pangs of second-hand heartbreak through me. It was *his*, somehow I knew it, felt it through the sorrow that radiated off Madison’s sobs inside my head. This was where it happened. This was where she lost him.

Sucking in a fresh gulp of air to still the eerie tide, I shook my head at the memories and whispered to them under my breath. “Hang on, Maddie. We’re almost there. Just hold on.”

At the top of the steps, we reached a metal man door and stopped to check our weapons.

“He’s in there.” Holding my Type 9, I nodded to the others crouched in the dark. “We have to be quick, or he’s going to see us coming. I’ll go first.”

Adam stepped in front of me and sheathed his sword, M4 at hand. “*I’ll* go first. He’s after you; the rest of us need to keep him busy while you do whatever it is you’ve planned. Just let us know when we need to get clear.”

I bit my lip and hated that he was right. It struck me then how many people had done such things for me, ever since I’d first stumbled into the lost stretches of Barron County; how many good people had taken a bullet for me, walked into certain death for me, risked everything to get me just one step further in my path? How would I ever repay such a debt, one written in blood of so many brave souls, when I had only one life to give? Eve’s tear-streaked face appeared in my mind, and I wondered if her Christian virtue would be able to resist hating me if I got her husband killed.

*It wouldn’t be the first time I robbed someone of their soulmate.*

Stepping back into the lineup with Jamie, I dragged in a shallow breath and waited.

Adam turned the corroded doorknob with one hand and shoved the door open to lunge inside.

I’d never been in the room before and had only glimpsed a few things in the broken fragments of Madison’s memories, but even as I swept in with the others, I could feel that it was different. Unlike the small, simple place described in Madison’s account, the expanse beyond the rusted door now spread over a widened elevated platform of interwoven vines similar to the ramp near the dead Oak Walker. The square windows of the old concrete room had been widened by some primitive form of hand tool, until they formed a small ring of narrow doorways that branched off in all directions. Thick growth sheltered the new portions of walkway from the rain in a tangled version of a roof, and small circular openings in the vines served as crude windows to look out over the dark woodlands below. It was dark here, the interior somewhat clouded with the smoke that rose from fires below us, but not so much that I didn’t stare in wonder at what filled the elongated room.

Hanging from the ceiling, the walls, or laid out across various parts of the floor were hundreds upon hundreds of items that rested in layers of dust. Pictures, jewelry, items of clothing, they were set out in winding pathways, like a treasure horde in some ancient temple, and I noticed a set of old nylon harnesses piled by one window, underneath a braided steel cable that spanned the room’s ceiling. I knew from the accounts I’d read that these were normally our way out of this accursed place, though with our vehicles I hoped to be able to drive to the exit as opposed to the old zipline. Still, to see it so reverently preserved by the mutants themselves, who would have benefited from all escape being cut off to us, made my skin tingle in macabre curiosity. We were standing on something akin to holy ground, though perhaps a warped, evil version of it.

My senses sharpened in the gloom, and out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a subtle movement.

“Down!” I grabbed Jamie’s arm to drag her with me to the floor, and a blur whistled past my face to imbed in one of the nearby vines.

Chris let out a burst from his M4 in the direction the arrow had come from, but already the shape had moved, and his bullets struck nothing save for the growth.

A low, guttural laugh echoed through the murky room, and I swallowed hard, my throat dry.

*He’s going to pick us off, one by one.*

“Where are you, demon?” Adam bellowed into the curling whisps of smoke, rifle at his shoulder. “Show yourself! Only a coward hides in the shadows!”

“Coward?” The throaty chuckle trickled in from somewhere on my left, only to be followed by more words off to the right, as if Vecitorak moved faster than sound itself. “Who was it that hid in the bushes that night, Adam? Who was it that left the other to die?”

*Whack.*

Another serrated arrow hissed past my head and glanced off the concrete section of floor beside Chris’s boot.

“We’ve got to get a bead on him.” Ducking behind the low walls of the old tower room, Chris looked at Adam and pointed to the right. “I got this way, you go around, and we catch him in the middle, yeah?”

Covered behind the opposite wall, Jamie scanned the curtains of smoke over the top of her Kalashnikov sights. “And us?”

Chris met my gaze, and his mouth formed a grim line. “You put an end to this.”

With that, he and Adam jumped from behind their minimal protection, and hurtled into the shadows. Their headlamps cut through the gloom like lighthouse beacons, but even in the confined space it seemed like they were miles away. Walls or solid partitions of vines sometimes obscured them from my view, and I fought a rising sickness in my guts at the notion that Vecitorak could easily see us in the darkness.

*So, what now? I know what needs to be done . . . I think. The question is where?*

Uncertain, I dipped my right hand into my jacket pocket and touched the necklace.

An image flashed in my head, the memory of a golden pocket watch on a dusty table alongside dozens of other sacrifices. Something about the watch being there hurt, ached within my soul, but it gave rest to my doubt. The necklace had been offered the same as the watch . . . they belonged together, as did their owners.

“Turn your light off.” I clicked the button on my own headlamp and motioned for Jamie to do the same.

She stared at me in confusion. “I can’t shoot what I can’t see.”

“I’ll see for both of us.” I exhaled, relaxed as much as I could, and let *the focus* slide into place. “Just hold on to me and keep quiet.”

Dowsing her light, Jamie wound the fingers of her off hand into the strap of my chest rig, and together we glided into the abyss.

I walked heel-to-toe and concentrated as hard as I ever had, my heightened senses on full alert. My mutated vision turned the inky darkness into a gray haze, through which I could pick out the vague details of the room beyond the smoke. Chris and Adam’s lights shone white in my altered vision, glaring shards of illumination that panned back and forth, but I managed to spot a black shadow slinking closer to Chris from the left side.

Lifting my Type 9, I sighted in on Vecitorak’s moldy hood and squeezed the trigger.

*Brat-tat-tat-tat.*

The muzzle flash of my submachine gun lit up my field of view with white blazes in the gray, but Vecitorak let out an annoyed screech and swept away behind a partition.

Chris and Adam turned to move in, now aware of the priest’s location, leaving Jamie and I enough room to explore further. I had to be quick, as Vecitorak would recover in moments, but it felt good to hear him grunt in something like pain.

A satisfied grin crawled over my face, and I continued on through the pathways.

*You’re not the only one who can see in the dark, creep.*

With the time I’d bought for myself, I flicked both eyes over the surrounding piles of offerings, in search of the golden pocket watch. So many things had been left here over the years, including some items that looked as though they were brought right out of a museum. There were many pocket watches, but I didn’t feel anything by looking at them, or rather *Madison* didn’t seem to feel anything, our connection thin and tenuous as ever. Still, it felt like she was trying her best, sunken deep in the recesses of my subconscious, to guide me from what little strength she had left.

A prickle of unease slithered over my neck, and I froze, craning my head upward.

*Thwack.*

Wood splintered on the back of my cuirass, the arrow striking just between my shoulder blades. The steel took the brunt of the impact, but like an overgrown bat, Vecitorak dropped from where he’d been crawling across the vine-encrusted ceiling.

In a panic, I dove out of the way, and Vecitorak’s wooden dagger slammed into the roots that made up this section of the floor.

Jamie tumbled backwards in surprise from the sudden change of movement and raised her rifle to fire into the gloom between us.

*Bang.*

Vecitorak spun with the prowess of a tiger, batted aside the AK, and snatched Jamie from the floor with one hand.

*No.*

Desperate, I threw myself on him, clawing at the mass of tangled, rotting robes to try and find any way to hurt the priest. My fingers caught on something heavy and square, so I grabbed the fetid book to tear it free.

*Wham.*

An elbow hit me in the face just below my left eye and knocked me to the ground. Vecitorak whirled to throw Jamie across the room, and she crashed into a partition of vines. The book came free of his poncho and thudded down amongst a pile of sacrifices to scatter coins, rings, and a few old picture frames. He was angry now, angry but still dangerous, and it seemed the fact that I had managed to take the journal away enraged Vecitorak.

“Fool!” He yanked the dagger free of where it had stuck in the growth to charge at me.

*Bang, bang, bang.*

More gunfire met him, and Vecitorak reeled as Chris and Adam emerged from the haze, emptying their rifles into the arcane leader. In such close quarters, the report of their M4’s was deafening, the concussive force enough to shake my hold on *the focus.*

Plunged back into the eerie darkness of normal sight, I scrabbled on hands and knees to get to cover and tried to calm myself enough to be able to concentrate. Jamie could be hurt, judging from the shouts and gunshots Chris and Adam were in the thick of it with Vecitorak, and I’d barely avoided death by sheer luck. I *had* to find that pocket watch, had to get this nightmare over with once and for all, but I couldn’t just leave my friends to die even if it was the rational thing to do.

*Crash.*

*Whoosh.*

Yellow light exploded in the dark, and I held up a hand to shield my eyes as a sudden blast of heat licked over the cold room. The stench of burning gasoline filled the air, orange, red, and yellow flames curled over the vines, and above it all, Vecitorak roared in blind fury. Chris and Adam came into view, backing away from the writhing torch that was the priest, and Jamie crouched in the background from where she had thrown the Molotov. Above them, another shape on the ceiling drew my gaze, and my heart stopped in my chest.

Tarren lay wrapped in a cluster of vines, unconscious, like a fly in a spider’s web. She was still unharmed, but that wouldn’t last for long. The fire was spreading rapidly over the dry interior, casting long shadows across the smoke-filled room, its heat rising by the second. We had to cut her down, but that wasn’t possible while the priest continued his rampage.

Covered in hungry flames, Vecitorak thrashed inside his moldy poncho, the fire licking over the rotted canvas with speed. He dropped the curved thorn wood bow he’d been using to hurl arrows our way, flung himself against the far wall, and shrieked in a chorus of screams that almost sounded as though they came from multiple voices. The sickly-sweet odor of burning flesh grew heavy in the cluttered room, and I tasted the foul smoke on the back of my tongue. Despite the wet surroundings, or his movements, it seemed the fetid cloth refused to be put out, and at last the dark priest ripped it from his back to throw the garment aside.

From where I sat on the floor, I brought a hand to cover my mouth and fought the urge to vomit.

*Dear God.*

He’d been a man once, tall, muscular, and strong. Ragged gouges in Vecitorak’s flesh marked where he’d been unable to peel some of the skin away in places, mostly around his head and hands. As for the rest of him, it was a bloody mass of exposed muscle and gray fat, portions of bare bone yellowed, some of the tendons a dull purple. The ragged clothing under his poncho lay plastered over the decaying husk of Vecitorak’s body, heaving from a swarm of crawling things that slithered in and out of various tunnels they’d chewed through him. Some were cockroaches, slugs, or maggots, while others were nightmarish things that could only have been borne from this hellish place, things with teeth, eyestalks, and spines. Wounds covered him, mostly gouges and tears that closely resembled bite marks, and something about them seemed vaguely human in shape. His stomach had been torn open and stitched shut with black cordage made from vines, and the stitches seeped greasy trails of pus down his emaciated midsection. One hand was cut to bone and sinew, while the other remained somewhat intact, though that ended at the wrist. Blood had turned Vecitorak’s ruined clothing a rusty brown hue, but I could still make out old combat boots, tactical pants, and a ripped officer’s field jacket with a faded badge on one arm that I couldn’t mistake.

*ELSAR.*

Eyes wide in shock, Adam took a step closer and cocked his head to one side. “Who are you?”

“Oh Adam,” Slowly Vecitorak’s bare, matted head rose, and the macabre being turned to face the armored preacher with a fiendish grin. “don’t you recognize me?”

Of all the damage to his butchered form, Vecitorak’s face made my gut churn the worst. As with his hands, one side of the corpse’s vestige remained somewhat untouched, save for a few bites that had almost gnawed off his right ear. I could still see the faint shape of who he’d once been: tufts of a dark beard, smudges of old camouflage face paint on his skin, and a single brown eye. The opposite side of his face had been torn away by hungry jaws, lips shredded, teeth exposed, the hair scooped out by the roots. Some of the meat had been stripped down to the bone of his skull, and the eye there was a glazed, milky white, much like the Puppets he ruled. Vecitorak’s throat lay open, the shriveled trachea swinging loose inside his neck like a clock pendulum, and whatever vocal cords he had were bloated beyond recognition.

I didn’t recognize him, but the look that crossed Adam’s sweaty face told me that he did.

“God on high.” The preacher’s cheeks went a shade paler, and he stammered in utter confusion. “Bronson? You died, I . . . I saw it . . .”

Something in Vecitorak’s expression rippled, the smile diminishing into a snarl so filled with hatred that my blood ran cold. “No. You saw *nothing*, not after that filthy abomination of yours called the Master’s children to their deaths. You hid in the shadows while they gorged on my pain . . . and you’ve been hiding ever since.”

With that, Vecitorak darted toward Adam, swept him into the air with a single powerful throw, and slammed the man into one of the nearby walls.

Chris raised his weapon, but Vecitorak whirled to catch him in the chest with another strike, and I watched my husband go flying across the room like a rag doll.

Jamie ran to the left, trying to light another Molotov, only to be intercepted by Vecitorak, who ripped a section of the exterior wall out with his bare hands to use as a missile. She barely avoided the chunk of wood, but the glass Molotov shattered on the floor before she could throw it, and Jamie dove into a corner to avoid the gush of new flame.

*You have to move, Hannah, he’s going to kill them all.*

Vecitorak’s book lay a few feet away, and I snatched it, sprinting into the rows of sacrifices as the tumultic struggle continued all around me.

“You did this to me!” Vecitorak refocused his attacks on Adam, striding over to kick away the preacher’s rifle before he could grasp it. “You threw me into a heap with all the others and left me to rot in the trees. Unable to breathe. Unable to move. Unable to scream.”

Adam took a hard kick to his abdomen, but the steel of his cuirass blocked most of the force, and he managed to roll to his feet, cruciform sword in hand. “You tried to hurt Eve. You attacked us without warning. I didn’t have a choice.”

Stretching out his hand, Vecitorak watched with malicious satisfaction as oily black vines slithered up his arm, out to his bony hand, and formed into a long wooden club that bristled with thorny spikes. “You didn’t, but *I* did. When you left me in that pit, someone heard my pleas; someone other than your false god. The Master gave me life, made me strong, and all he asked in return was for me to shed my broken, weak flesh. When I raise him, he will seat me at his right hand, and you will watch as I take your wife back into the fold of his blessed children . . . where she belongs.”

Adam’s toffee-colored irises blazed with fury, and he leapt at Vecitorak, his sword gleaming in the spreading firelight as if it too burned with vengeful zeal. The two met in the middle of the inferno, shouts and roars echoing between them as the man of God fought with the servant of the Void, neither giving an inch. Adam had the advantage of his armor, but Vecitorak was stronger, faster, and tireless. He tore out more sections of the exterior wall of the room to try and crush Adam, the cold rain mixing with the heat of the flames in a whirlwind of misery, but the preacher had enough dexterity on his side to avoid the attacks. In the background, Chris and Jamie emerged from the shadows to try and rejoin the fray, but rising flames blocked them. Chris opted to climb a nearby partition to reach for Tarren while Jamie tried to work her way toward me, but the heat was too intense, as the wind coming in from outside whipped the fire to hotter levels. A small part of me realized, with sinking clarity, that I was cut off not only from my friends, but the metal man door to the stairwell.

Stumbling through the blast furnace that was once the sacrifice room, I coughed on the acrid smoke and squinted with watery eyes at my surroundings.

*To your right, filia mea.*

The soft baritone voice seemed to whisper in my ear, and I turned to see a little shelf of growth on my right adorned with trinkets, but with one notable empty space. Flecks of dried rusty-red blood stained the interwoven vines, and my eyes landed on the one thing to cement my hope.

Glittering in the firelight, the golden pocket watch waited in an unassuming coat of dust next to the empty spot. It was plain in design, the finish polished smoothed by many hands over the years, but I knew in my heart who it belonged to. This was a place of sorrow, much like the check-in hut at New Wilderness; a place full of old memories, lost souls of those who came before, and were now gone. A place of pain. A place of grief.

*Kind of like the altar . . . and the blood . . . hang on a second.*

I dug into my pocket and cast a glance over my shoulder in time to see Adam’s sword knocked from his grasp as Vecitorak seize the preacher by his armored collar. Adam struggled, but clearly he too was no match for the superhuman strength of the Breach-borne priest.

Vecitorak lifted Adam high and tossed aside his club to reach for the jagged wooden dagger on his belt. “Our era is inevitable. Our Master is absolute. Now you will see it with new eyes . . . as one of us.”

My shaky fingers slid on the disgusting leather of Vecitorak’s book as I flipped to the page with the runes and laid it out before the tiny shelf. Placing the necklace in my left palm, I reached for my war belt and drew my trench knife. I had no idea if this would work, if I was completely wrong about the process, but there was no time left.

I took a deep breath, and pressed the sharp, cold steel to my palm alongside the necklace.

Pain flared in my skin, red blood oozed up around the silver chain and turquoise stone, while I shut my eyes and did my best to pull *the focus* into my frazzled mind.

*Madison, if you can hear me, I need you to fight hard, one last time.*

Memories flickered with shutter-speed intensity in my head, hers and mine mixing until I could hardly tell the difference. She continued her mantra from the shadows of my subconscious, and I understood the words as if they were my own. A strange sensation moved within me for the first time, a new plane within *the focus*, one that made me feel both the heat of the sacrifice room, and the cold raindrops of the outside world. Like two clocks ticking in sync, Madison and I collided within the unknown, our thoughts in lockstep, our spirits conjoined. Every emotion, every thought, every ounce of strength either of us had left poured into a vibrant energy that radiated from the cut in my hand, put static in my ears, and made the runes in Vecitorak’s book glow with a bright golden light. The light grew in brilliance until it ate away at the pages, the binding, the leather of the cursed book, turning it black like charcoal and then to fine dust. For the first time since driving into Tauerpin Road, a heavy calm settled over me, a power beyond myself or Madison that wasn’t bound to the dripping trees or darkened clearing. In total opposition to the Breach, this was something clean, warm, gentle.

From this wellspring came a familiar voice, deep and kind, that resonated over Madison’s, and over my own.

*‘She didn’t know how loved she was . . . and neither did he.’*

As if he could sense that something was wrong, Vecitorak’s wooden blade froze in the air next to Adam, and he snapped his head around to glare at me, but even he couldn’t cover the distance fast enough.

I raised my bleeding hand over the shelf, uncurled each aching finger to release the necklace, and let the sacred words that had protected Madison through so much agony flow over my lips. “Mark Petric.”

In an instant, the rain slackened, the thunder dimmed, and Vecitorak himself lurched to a halt in stunned breathlessness.

*Kaboom.*

Lightning struck just outside, louder than any I’d ever seen, and almost blinded me. Searing pain flashed through my mind, and I grimaced as Madison began to scream in a torment that sliced into my very soul, her memories flickering out like old lightbulbs. The good feeling left me, *the focus* slipped away, and I fell to my knees as the entire tower shook in its foundation. My scars writhed with phantom knowledge, and outside a multitude of Puppets shrieked in wild delight as the ground shuddered under my feet.

*Maddie?*

Tears rolled down my face, both from pain and panic as I searched for that ethereal connection with all my will.

*Talk to me. Show me something, make me feel something, anything. Where are you?*

Outside the window, old growth cracked and crunched, vines and roots snapped, accompanied by the enormous creaking of something heavy. A huge shape rose into the night, the charred sections now covered in fresh vines, the triangular head complete, propping itself up on one knee as the gigantic figure tore loose from its cocoon. Try as I might, I couldn’t raise any sign of Madison’s spirit within my mind, couldn’t bring up her memories, her emotions, anything.

Gone.

She was gone.

*What have I done?*

“Yes.” His mutilated face twisted into a grin of wicked triumph, Vecitorak stood in the gap he’d made of the outer wall, raising his arms high in the rain as the shadow climbed to its feet. “*Yes!*”

Weak from *the focus* leaving me, I could do little more than look on from my knees as the Oak Walker stood up, reared back its massive head, and broke the sky with a colossal baleen roar.
