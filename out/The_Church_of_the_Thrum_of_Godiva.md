I’ve kept this story to my self for more than a decade in fear of any repercussions but after recently learning of the death of its last surviving member, I’ve chosen to collect some of my thoughts from journals and what scant information I’ve sourced over the last 10+ years, and write about my experience with what I later found out was \*not\* simply a religiously oriented social club working with its local community, but rather a deranged and abusive cult.

In the interest of maintaining some level of anonymity I’m doing my best to omit locations and other personally identifiable information. I will name the people that I was in contact with throughout the ordeal as best I can because they’re already known to the area with which the cult is associated and its local authority, and there were enough victims that I feel comfortably lost in the maelstrom of ruined people and broken homes left in the wake of The Church of the Thrum of Godiva.  If you have questions, I will answer what I can but only under the pretence that the safety of myself and my friends/family come before everything else. What I and others went through should be experienced by no one and I am for one thankful the monsters involved are all seemingly gone.

When I left high-school mid-2008 at the age of 16, I immediately applied to go to my local college where I started in Media & Business studies with night classes dedicated to Creative Writing. This is mostly irrelevant to the story other than it providing the impetus to my seeking out the Church by way of my final exam being a long form essay on a local establishment and how it uses media to enrol members into it’s organisation. Simply put I was to pick some local group and write about how they work with their community and what types of media they might use to draw interest. We were to spend the year developing this essay with a view to hand it in at the end for our passing grade. I never submitted mine.

Around Christmas time that year I had been around town prodding at random shops and local businesses to see if anything interesting stood out to me. A lot of places were starting to use, at the time, the burgeoning social media scene. Think late-stage Bebo, but more likely Facebook and Twitter. These all seemed like perfectly acceptable options given their future-forward approach to their media output but me being the smart arse I was thought it’d be cute to find somewhere that still “did it the old fashioned way,” and so I’d look at flyers in shop windows, bulletin boards and the like at our local library. Somewhere along the way I found a flyer headed in big bold letters “THE CHURCH OF THE THRUM OF GODIVA” which - I mean look at it, it sounds ridiculous and utterly incomprehensible. The only thing that really stood out to me was the “Godiva” part because I knew Queen had a lyric that mentioned “Lady Godiva” in “Don’t Stop Me Now”.

Beneath the bold heading was some smaller text which read “Connecting with the Heavens by giving to it everything, and every one whom would seek her.” - Again, to my eye, gibberish but extremely interesting sounding. The rest of the body of the flyer was your typical church-group fair. Little bubbly clouds surrounding different activities they provide and events they’d put on: “Church Book Club” “Horse Riding Day!” “The Lady’s Choir” “Private Tutoring” “Feeding Homeless” and “The Winter Fete” among other more menial, generic activities you’d expect of any church.

Finally at the bottom was a telephone number. Just a landline with the local area code. No website, no emails, no names of members or leaders. and particularly no local address. At the time I tried googling what I could but there was literally nothing. Not even a mention from our local newspapers. To me, it was perfect. I liked the idea of looking at this from the perspective of “old media” and how relevant it may still be in today’s age. I mean, it worked for thousands of years before, right? Surely I as a smarmy 16 year old media student could elucidate on this topic and uncover some deep meaningful reason why groups like Churches might stick to the “old ways,” rather than trying to appeal to the latest trends. I guess when you work only in paper, it’s pretty bloody easy to burn the trail it leaves behind.

Right away I decided to call the number. It rang four or five times and then as quickly as they picked up they hung up again - the only thing me hearing was what sounded like a sharp toned static sound then the usual 3 note dead line tone. I rang again and almost immediately was answered but not before the sharp static stung my ear again, except this time I could tell it was coming from a person, as the one who had answered seemingly shushed whoever was making the noise.

“Good Morning, her blessed light with be with you! This is Sarah-Kate speaking, reception.” A soft, friendly voice spoke. I could hear the smile on the other end it was so upbeat.

“Oh- Hi. My name’s \[Alice\], is this the Church of Godiva, yes?” I was still coming off being a little startled by the harsh sound before the introduction but she immediately corrected me.

“The Church \*of the Thrum\* of Godiva, yes. Reception speaking!” she informed.

“Sorry, yes that’s what I meant. I am calling to see if it would be possible to obtain your address and if I could come by for a friendly visit this afternoon?”

“Why yes, of course dear. May I take your name again please?”

I provided her my contact details and she gave me the address and some information on where to find it. I actually knew the location. It was an old Catholic Church my Grandfather used to attend around the time my Mum was born (which I think was late 60’s, early 70’s. I don’t recall anymore.) but I remember hearing he stopped attending as the Church had been seemingly closed or merged with a larger Church elsewhere due to a lack of funding and staff. I guessed, then, that these Godiva-folk must have leased or purchased it in the interim and repurposed it for their own needs.

When I arrived at the church I was sort of blown away by it’s beauty. It was completely refurbished, possibly recently as there wasn’t a blemish on it. It had nice but stark warm white walls with brass adornments and accents around the eaves and on it’s steeple where at the top was a flat cutout of a woman sitting on a horse where you’d normally expect a chicken or something, alongside the N, S, E and W cardinal headings. Around the church was like a garden moat made entirely of gorgeous flower arrangements of white lily, periwinkle and stunning virginal aconite (or colloquially, Wolfsbane). There were bushels of strawberry and peaches all simmering in the sun with waning morning dew. I spent a few minutes here before moving just taking in the air. It honestly smelled incredible, like fresh fruit dipped in hand turned cream.

The entrance to the Church was equally magnificent. A very muted red door with wrought iron embellishments of the Lady Godiva, atop a well dressed horse in stark contrast to her naked form with only the thin veil of long, wavy hair covering her breast. She sat sidesaddle, with one foot crossing the other, and one hand by her belly cupping the other above it, palms up and head down as though she were cradling a small, injured bird and willing it back to health. The horses bridles acted as the door knocker. I pulled it forward and let it fall twice. Standing there waiting I couldn’t help but turn back to the garden to spy out busily working bumblebees but just as I turned, the door silently opened with only the warm air around me rushing in and mixing with the steely indoor cool to draw my attention back.

Standing there, leaning around the door was Sarah-Kate who was a small woman who, despite looking decidedly not middle-aged, was betrayed by the straw coloured blonde hair she once had giving way to intermittent wisps of grey and white. She introduced herself and asked if I was the young lady who called earlier. “I am.” I let her know and gestured inwards to which she obliged. Inside was quite modern looking, to my surprise. The reception desk right up front had one of those all-in-one desks you might find in an IKEA catalogue with that wretched, glossy fake wood veneer over top some particle board. And on it stood a laptop connected to a larger monitor and I presume the telephone I called earlier. As she invited me in I was almost immediately startled by the rest of the sight.

In a row near the opposite wall of reception were five girls sitting on velvet stools shaped a bit like saddles. They were sitting side on like the door knocker, feet crossing the other, hands at their bellies cupped upwards with their heads tilted down and long, dark hair draped over satin or silk shifts that only just gave them a modicum of bodily privacy. They were sheer, but not so much that they were basically naked with an excuse for fabric to cover them. I immediately averted my eyes out of either habit or a sense of feeling like I was invading their privacy, feeling as although they were covered I was still somehow seeing something I shouldn’t have. Sarah-Kate noticed immediately.

“Oh how funny, you’re a natural!” she said through a slight laughter.

“What do you mean?”

“Well, we ask that members and indeed visitors do not look directly at them while the foals supplicate. It’s part of a tradition, you understand?” still in her soft and friendly phone voice.

“Supplication? Like prayer?” I ask.

“In a manner of speaking, yes. Supplication can be like a prayer but-” she stifled herself. Possibly realising she was saying too much too quickly. “Well. I think its best you let the Father Greer explain it when you meet him. These are members of his congregation.” pointing at the girls.

“Oh, okay. Will I meet him today?” I vaguely gesture around me.

“Indeed you will, he should be here shortly. He’s just finishing up a private prayer session with a member.”

Sarah-Kate waddled back around to her desk and kind of just left me standing in the middle of this entrance chamber. It gave me a moment to write some notes down and try to take in more of the room. I couldn’t help but feel extremely uncomfortable and a little weirded out by the girls just sitting there in complete silence. Out of respect I tried not to make it obvious I was looking and at least \*tried\* not to look at their faces.

They all looked quite similar. All had that sort of dark almost black hair that turned somewhat red at the roots as it met their pale, milky skin. They honestly looked impeccable if nothing else. Not a mark on them anywhere and their shifts were spotlessly clean, almost painful to look at as they reflected light back at me. From that I noticed that it was literally the case, now that I had surveyed around, above them were empty shafts leading apparently right up and outside, or at the very least to some extremely bright lights installed into them. The shafts let a cone of light blanket each one of the five and the closer I inspected them, the more I could surmise they were all around my age. Anywhere from 16 to 20 at most. Completely motionless, breathing softly and sitting there in “supplication.”

I was becoming engrossed in their otherworldly appearance when just out of my field of view to the left, toward the back of the chamber I saw another red door swing open violently, revealing two men. One very obviously being this Father Greer, adorned in various white and red robes and what shocked me back into present was an older, grey-haired man standing behind him a little hunched over and looking like he had been crying, reaching his arms out toward the Father until he noticed me, and I his eyes. He quickly stepped backwards and down one step of stairs behind him. When he passed a shaft of light I saw that he was almost naked only wearing one: a red sort of cloth kerchief around his neck and two: …not underwear, but a kind of white sheet wrapped around him like a toga-nappy. It sounds funny but it was extremely strange, especially given the look of sheer hurt and then horror on his face when our eyes met. The Father swung the door behind him and let it slam shut. I jumped but the girls in prayer didn’t move an inch.

“Ah! Alice, Hello! How nice to hear someone is interested in our little congregation.” Father Greer let out while brushing his palms down his robe as if to wash himself of the man in the stairwell.

“Hi, Father. I’ve just been admiring the garden and this beautiful chamber.” I tried to maintain a friendly, jovial tone but I’m certain he could detect the undercurrent of morbid curiosity under my words.

“How wonderful. We take much pride in our little cove, I’m sure it’s all very breathtaking if you’ve never seen it before.”

He seemed awfully forthright with his estimation of the place. Nothing wrong with that, just that it seemed odd. You usually expect priests and church-goers to portray a sense of modesty, but not him.

“Sarah-Kate was just telling me about the girls, and their… supplication?”

“I see, I see.” he glances over me toward Sarah-Kate’s area, then back. “And what did she tell you?”

“Nothing, really. Just that it’s like prayer in a way.”

“You could say that, yes. Prayer is often one making an overt plea to their maker. A request or wish for someone, or some thing. Supplication is more internal. There’s a far greater focus on manifestation. It’s meditative and meant for giving oneself over to the light, rather than asking for the light to be brought to oneself.”

“I think I see what you mean. So they are meditating? They’re allowing the light to bathe them it looks like?”

“They wish to engender… hmm, not prosperity- they wish to engender in our minds and our environment a knowingness with respect to the light. To cleanse us of our wrongdoings and allow us to better prepare for her- the heavens coming.”

“Sounds quite Christian to me, Catholic even.”

His subtly building fervency relinquished at that moment. He wasn’t mad or upset but perhaps disappointed.

“Not quite. We may inhabit an old testimonial church but we’re certainly not Catholic.”

“But you are Christian, at least?”

“I guess so, in as much as we are all seeking the Kingdom of Heaven.”

“That seems very cryptic, Father Greer. Is it in the Thrum of Godiva’s nature to be cryptic? And what is a Thrum if you don’t mind me asking?”

He let loose a satisfied smile “I’d be happy to explain further another day. I can’t spend all day with you today unfortunately. It is rather short notice, your visiting, and I have many congregants to see to. Are there any burning questions you have right now I can answer, and in the meantime I’ll-”

He turned away from me, looking over my head again toward Sarah-Kate’s desk. “Sarah-Kate, see that you find a time in my calendar in the next fortnight for the young lady to come back and speak to me further.” He returned his gaze my way. It was only then that I actually noticed that he hadn’t been looking at me at all. He was looking down, past me… almost through my chest. Kind of like speaking to a blind person, where their eyes seemingly point in your general direction as they try to accommodate for a seeing person’s comfort by feigning eye contact. Except… where that would feel like a kindness from them, from Father Greer it felt alien. Like his line of sight was magnetically inverse to my own.

I shook the feeling and asked “I sort of get the girls supplicating in the light-”

“Aha, the girls.” he interrupts but lets me continue.

“-but why the averting of the eyes, why can’t I look at them or they at me?”

“Well, in the briefest and least full way I can explain it’s a tradition born of the myth of the Lady Godiva. In fact, there you go… some homework for you to do until we can meet for a proper conversation. Part of our adherence to tradition involves the natural aversion of the eyes from the gentler folk of our congregation. It’s partly out of respect, partly abstention and in many ways another form of supplication. She, as in the heavens, will only allow us passage if we respect the wishes of said heaven.”

In a certain way I found his speech mind-numbing but only really in the same way I found any kind of proselytising similarly mind-numbing. It seemed designed to be purposefully vague yet maximally applicable to any situation or interpretation.

He turned his body to face the girls, but fully dipped his head down to avoid any chance of meeting their eyes and said “Technically, you may look at them as you are one of them.”

“One of them?”

“The aforementioned ‘Gentler Folk'’” he nodded.

“So I can look at them, fine. Can they look at me, too?”

“I don’t see why not but it would only be up to them. I couldn’t ask… “ he paused momentarily then said “…or make them do it.”

Just then, the girl nearest me ever so slightly curled her hand into a ball and twitched her feet. I couldn’t tell if it was out of lapsing concentration, or frustration.

I could see a thinly veiled smile through his pursed lips as he pondered the motion from the girl.

“Pandora, only if you wish to you may turn your gaze. I don’t wish to interrupt your time in the light or ask that you break your abstention.”

We stood there in silence for a few seconds but in the now buzzing tension between his words, my intrigue and this “Pandora’s” break in form made it feel like forever. I had now fully turned my eyes toward her face. I wasn’t regarding the implied privacy I was providing before, or the “tradition,“ or really any social norm I might be breaking by staring. I was completely absorbed in the subtle tremor rippling across her features or the continued squeeze of her balled fist. I had to hear her voice at this point, I was praying she would speak and then-

“There we go.” the Father uttered and turned almost fully away from Pandora and me.

She released the squeeze in her hand and breathed slowly again, then slid off the saddle-stool onto her feet. The pat of her steps were so hollow, almost at a whisper but it was so quiet in there that I could still hear it. She stood in front of me. It was only then could I tell how tall she was, she easily stood almost a foot over me. She wasn’t scary or lanky, it was just unexpected to see such a delicate, slight person emerge into this tall, almost divine form in the cone of light still bathing her. I mean, this all happened in seconds but it played like a slow motion movie in my head.

She tipped her head up enough to meet my gaze and opened her eyes and… she smiled. Then she extended her hand out from her spotless shift toward me, letting her slender fingers hang as if I were to bend a knee and kiss them. At this moment instead of returning the gesture, I firstly looked over my shoulder toward Father Greer, his back still to me. I could see him turn his head toward Sarah-Kate’s side of the room, though still downward, and raise an eyebrow. Sarah-Kate must have been trying to relay what was happening between Pandora and me because he nodded as if to imply he “understood,“ then smiled and turned back away from us.

Taking this to mean things were “cool,“ I looked down at Pandora’s hand and stretched mine outward, while turning up to see her eyes. They were huge. Not scary, not cartoon like… they were just very large eyes, with a watery sheen over them and made up of a very fair but mottled grey tone. When our hands clasped together, I was surprised how warm she was. Like, almost feverishly warm. I smiled back at her and-

Suddenly she threw her head to my left, over the Father, while at the same time the red door at the back crashed open and the man from before in the white toga pants fell out of it, spilling himself onto the floor. He landed on his forearms and let out a yelp which caused both Father Greer and Sarah-Kate to rush over to help. Very quickly I felt my heart sink, as Father Greer let out some so far uncharacteristic growls and yelled at the man “Abstain, Alistair… abstain!” and other things while pushing him toward the door. Just then, I felt Pandora’s grip on my hand tighten and tighten until it hurt then she wrenched my hand, pulling my arm almost by her side.

This pulled me into her chin and as I struggled not to fall into her, she simply bent her head down to my ear and stifled a whimper, a cry almost, and said into my ear:

“They make us fucking watch them.”

I whipped my hand down and away from her and stepped back, looking at her and trying to make sense of it. She looked at me as if I should understand what she meant but just then the red door slammed shut, Sarah-Kate wiping her hands down herself and hurrying back to the desk while likewise the Father turned back toward us and angrily marched over. Always without meeting our eye line yet I could tell he was more less looking at Pandora and me in his peripheral to see what was going on. I looked at him trying to hide my dread, then back toward Pandora who was now sitting again- sidesaddle, with one foot crossing the other, and one hand by her belly cupping the other above it, palms up and head down as though she were cradling a small, injured bird - bathed in light and breathing slowly. This whole time none of the other girls had moved even once.

I left shortly after this, having arranged an appointment the following week with Sarah-Kate. The Father didn't seem to suspect anything happened between Pandora and me but I can't be certain that he or Sarah-Kate didn't see anything, averted eyes or not. That's only half of my concern, however... what the fuck did Pandora mean "they make us watch them"? Watch them do what, and to whom? It's seemingly a big deal to them about who and when one may watch, or "look," at anyone... so what is she and possibly the other girls being made to watch that had her almost hurt me in order to let me know? I needed to know more, but had almost nowhere to begin... so I waited until the following week to return back to Pandora, to the Church of the Thrum of Godiva. 

\*\*

I need to take a break but I promise that I will write again about my experience with the Church soon, if anyone is interested, as this was only the beginning of the downward spiral. If you have questions I will try to answer what I can. Otherwise, thank you for reading and I hope you have a good day.
