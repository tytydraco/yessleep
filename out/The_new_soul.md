The police never found anything—no trace of Lira de Phantom, alive or dead. They combed through every inch of the sprawling, decaying mansion that loomed like a shadow over the valley, but it yielded no answers. The house itself seemed to breathe, its walls whispering secrets, yet offered no safety. It was alive, but not in a way that comforted the living.

The only clue left behind was a tattered book, its pages worn and frayed, some of them violently ripped out, as if something didn’t want the story to be told.

The remaining title read:
Lira de Phantom
Author: Lira de Phantom

The missing girl herself.

Day 1

Hello, dear diary. My name is Lira de Phantom, and I live in my family’s old home with my parents. It’s enormous, almost like a castle. We’re royalty, after all, but it doesn’t feel grand. It feels… heavy. Empty.

I’m writing because I have no friends. My biggest wish is to find someone who will talk to me, laugh with me, and make me feel alive. For now, there’s nothing more to say. Goodbye, dear diary.

Saturday, 3:04 AM

I couldn’t sleep tonight. The house feels heavier when it’s quiet, so I decided to wander. I ended up in my favorite room—the one filled with flowers and a massive, antique mirror.

I often stare into that mirror, but tonight was different.

Tonight, it stared back.

There was a boy inside the glass. He looked my age, with blonde hair and strange, faded clothes, like something out of a painting.

At first, I was frozen. Then, he spoke.

“Hello! Don’t be scared. I’m not here to hurt you. I heard your wish for a friend, and I’m here for you!”

His voice was soft, almost melodic, but his eyes—oh, his eyes—were not. They were black as midnight, voids that seemed to pull at my soul.

Still, I spoke with him. His name, though faint and smudged in the diary, was later deciphered as Lui de Phantom. He claimed he was a distant relative, though his name wasn’t in any family records.

Day 23

Dear diary, I’m worried about Lui.

He was furious tonight when I mentioned telling my parents about him.

Lui: “I told you, Lira. I don’t like adults. They’re boring, and they ruin things.”

Lira: “But they’re worried about me! They think you’re… dangerous.”

Lui: “I’m not dangerous! I’M YOUR FRIEND, LIRA!”

His voice echoed in my mind long after I left the room. But tonight, when I passed the mirror, I saw him watching me. His expression was no longer kind—it was hollow.

And hungry.

The Final Entry

The next entries in the diary were either torn or illegible, but one chilling passage remained:

Lira: “I’m here, Lui. You said you wanted to talk.”

He stood in the mirror, but his smile was wrong—twisted and cold. His eyes glistened like polished obsidian, empty yet overwhelming.

Lira: “Lui… why are you smiling like that?”

His voice was low and distorted now.

Lui: “Because I’m not Lui. He never was.”

The only clear words left in the diary were:

You are not safe.
You are not alive.
I was wrong.
I am… new.
New soul.

⸻

I didn’t believe it either—until I went to that house.

The mansion is abandoned now, but the mirror room is still sealed. Not locked. Sealed. I tried to find records of what happened to Lira, but there’s nothing. No missing person report. No family left. Just rumors.

A few weeks ago, I made the mistake of going there at 3:04 AM. I only wanted to look through the window. Just to see if the mirror was still there.

I swear, I saw something standing behind the glass. Not a girl. Not a boy. Something else.

And then, in the faint reflection of my own face, I saw it:

A smile.

Not mine.

I ran. But I don’t think it mattered.

Because last night, I woke up at 3:04 AM.

And my mirror was fogged up.

With words scratched into the glass.

“New soul.”
