Has anyone had any luck sleeping lately?

Just as the title says, my insomnia has gotten far worse lately. I’m fairly new to Reddit and I came across r/nosleep, and I’m hoping you guys have found a way to consistently get some rest.

Some details about myself and my situation, in case it helps: I’m 22, living in a one-bedroom apartment in a busy city in America, and I work an office job that usually keeps me on a pretty normal sleep schedule. I’d love to blame the city noise outside, but I’ve lived here for years, and it’s never been an issue before. This insomnia started just over three weeks ago, and every day it feels worse. 

I’m a back sleeper. I wear a sleep mask to block out the glow from some streetlights outside and use a medium-stiff mattress that I’ve always been comfortable with. None of it is working. I’ve tried over-the-counter sleep aids like melatonin, but they only help sometimes, and I don’t want to rely on them forever. I’ve tried blankets, no blankets, weighted blankets, white noise, no noise—nothing is working.

Please, any help is appreciated.

Edit:  
Sorry guys, I completely misunderstood the point of this subreddit. I want to thank the users who were kind enough to send a DM instead of embarrassing me in the comments, and a couple of you encouraged me to update my post just so I didn’t leave a permanent footprint of embarrassment here. Mods haven’t taken this down yet, so they must be getting a chuckle out of this. 

For those of you who even actually provided me sleep advice, it may be worth it to expand on my situation. context:

-No, I’m not sharing my bed with anyone. It’s just me here in my apartment.
-No, I haven’t had insomnia my whole life. This only started about 3 weeks ago, and I’ve had maybe 20 hours of sleep total since it began.
-Yes, I’ve been to a doctor. They couldn’t find anything physically wrong with me, but they recommended I see a specialist if things don’t improve.

I’ll admit, I’m starting to worry about my health. I haven’t slept at all in the past week. My thoughts feel foggy, and my body is sluggish, like it’s running on fumes. At this point, I’m just grasping at straws.

Anyways, I’m currently browsing to see if there’s any actual insomniac subreddits. Thanks again, you probably won’t be hearing back from me.

Edit 2: (Day 4)
Hey guys, me again. It’s been 27 days since this started, and exactly 4 days since I last slept. I’m only updating this because the actual insomnia subreddits have been… less than helpful, if they didn’t outright accuse me of lying. They didn’t give me any actual advice, and only told me that I needed to go to a hospital ASAP because I hadn’t slept in almost 100 hours. Apparently that’s a “dangerous” amount of time to stay awake (as though I’m not aware), and most people didn’t even believe me.

So, due to the kindness I received here, I’m back, with just a couple updates, I guess. Like I said, 27 days, 4 days since last sleep. 97 hours, to be exact. You guys seem to be a lot more open minded here, and I’ve had a lot of fun reading all your stories. I’ve been keeping up with the “F—— HIPAA, My Patient…” series every day, and there was one a couple days ago about a couple that can hear themselves up in the attic, that was fun too.

I haven’t been able to work in almost 3 weeks. I wasn’t fired or anything actually, my boss is really understanding. After I collapsed at work from the exhaustion, he sent me home and told me not to come back until I had gotten my health in order. It’s a good thing I’m salaried. I think if this goes on much longer though, I’ll get moved to disability leave, which is only 50% of my salary for up to…. 6 months? I think?

I won’t bore you with that anymore. You’re all here because you’re worried about my health, or because you’re morbidly curious, or something like that. I guess the idea of actually not being able to sleep is good enough to be a scary story for you, but to be honest, it’s just exhausting for me. 

A couple of you suggested I stop sleeping with the sleep mask. I was hesitant to the idea at first, because my window overlooks a busy intersection and there’s a lot of light that pours though. Someone was kind enough to send me the link to some blackout curtains, and they finally came in today! I’ll update you again in a few days.

Edit 3: (Day 7)
Mixed success. I’ll admit, my face felt a lot better without the sleeping mask, and the blackout curtains were incredible. There were times throughout the night where I genuinely couldn’t even tell if my eyes were opened or closed, which was a little trippy. But alas, even in the darkness- no sleep. 

The blackout curtains didn’t just block out light. They’re super heavy duty, and come pre-installed with a magnet kit so they can form a sort of seal around your window. As a side effect, the incoming noise from the street below was greatly reduced. I think the sudden lack of noise in my room was actually more disconcerting than the noise. When you grow up with a constant, rhythmic source of loud sound, the near-silence that replaces it is infinitely louder. 

I think I’m beginning to hallucinate. The dangerous combination of being more sleep deprived than anyone online says is possible and being in near complete darkness and silence is, apparently, the perfect concoction to allow my brain to start experiencing things that aren’t really there. 

In the early hours of the night, I begin to see pinpricks of light on my ceiling, glittering stars that swirl, pause, and resume their heavenly motion above my head. It’s the only indication that my eyes were open. 

The auditory hallucinations were stranger. Groaning, creaking noises, like an old house settling. I heard nails, clacking around on a wooden surface, the sound of my childhood dog coming to greet me. Memories, soft and sweet, but not any assistance in my goal.

What do you guys think? Do I unclip the magnets from the curtain tonight and let some light and noise in, or do I put up with the hallucinations until I sleep.

Edit 4: (Day 13)
I hate all of you.

You told me to keep the curtains up. “Your mind just needs to adjust,” you said. “It’ll help you sleep.” Well, guess what? It didn’t.

It was a mistake to tell you guys about the hallucinations. No, there is nothing in my room with me. Did you miss the part where I have just passed THREE HUNDRED HOURS of consciousness? Do any of you even care?

Your “kindness” is starting to sting, I’ll be honest. It’s becoming INCREASINGLY obvious to me that none of you actually want to help me rest, and are just morbidly curious to see how long it’ll take my mind to break. 

I looked it up. You’re all sick. The official world record for longest time spent without sleeping was set by Randy Gardner in 1963. 11 days and 25 minutes. Well, I’ve hit day 13. You all wanted to keep me on the hook long enough to see what would happen if I went without sleep longer than any human in recorded history. Well guess what? It’s nothing special. I’m just tired. No special insight, no transcendence. Just exhaustion. 

You jerks all told me that if I kept my curtain sealed, I’d eventually fall asleep. All you wanted from me is to keep hallucinating, to keep feeding you pieces of my broken mind until I eventually die, and you see me on the news giving you the satisfaction of a “scary ending”. Screw you.

I’m going to bed tonight without the curtain. No sleep mask, no melatonin, no fan on in my room, no weighted blanket, NONE of the STUPID advice that you people have been feeding me in an attempt to keep me awake.

I’m going back to sleep like a NORMAL HUMAN BEING. It has to work. It HAS to work.

Final edit: (Day…?)
I’m so sorry everyone. I was wrong, I was so so wrong. 
I went to bed that night, and with no mask and no curtain, I was free to observe the shallow light of my room. I was confident that my hallucinations would end, and that I may have a chance to finally get some rest.

When the sun finally set, and the room darkened, the room was bathed in a dim glow from the streetlights below illuminating my ceiling. There were no stars.

There were eyes. Dozens and dozens of eyes. 
A hoard of.. things. Skittering, smiling, spider-like things, crawling around my ceiling. Limbs cracking and distorting to swiftly find a new position, then pausing to stare at me in my bed.

I’ve seen them now. They KNOW that I’ve seen them. They don’t leave during the day anymore, and I’m too scared to leave my bed. It took me three days to work up the courage to move enough to reach for my phone.

I’m so hungry. Im thirstier than I’ve ever been. But worst of all, I’m tired. Not the exhaustion of insomnia I’ve told you about- I’m sleepy. I’m fighting with every fiber of my being to simply stay awake. 

I don’t know what they’ll do with me if I fall asleep.
