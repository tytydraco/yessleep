**(8:17 PM - 1:10 AM)**

I went to the archives today. I’m not sure how to feel right now, but I know all of you are waiting for some more information on what’s happening around here, and I do want to hear your own thoughts, so I’ll just get to it.

Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to properly sit down to write this post until just now — after getting home from work and settling in — but I did take short notes that I’ll be referring to as I do so, along with my own memory. I don’t usually try to write very cinematically about my actual life, but I know that’s what some you are probably here for, and I have the free time without the fear of another reset creeping upon me, so I’ll try my best.

The large, white ornate stone building stood tall against the backdrop of a blue morning sky. Looking back, if it weren’t for the circumstances I was in, I might have called it a beautiful sight — even a beautiful *morning* — but it’s strange to think of anything that way when you’re trapped so far from everyone you know and love.

One of the two wooden doors easily twice my height was opened upon my arrival, and I remember marveling at the strength of the old woman who most certainly should not have been assigned to that job as she greeted me and guided me inside. The sprawling, intricately designed polished wood floors echoed with the footsteps of my guide, myself, and anyone else who might have been walking about at the time, and the scent of old books steeped with well-guarded history fragrantly accented the air, like the sort of smell you’d have expected stepping into an old library. By all visuals but the noticeable paper sleeves with dates and incomprehensible numbers scrawled upon them, that’s exactly what it was. Nothing more than a massive library, yet held in such higher and more protective regard.

The old woman, whose name I shamefully can’t recall, turned to me as we rounded a corner and showed me towards what I can only describe as a front desk of some manner, telling me that she had other visitors she expected that day, but that the archivist there at the desk would be glad to show me to whatever I might have been interested in viewing.

I think it was only then that it hit me that I didn’t know what I was interested in viewing. In my head, I guess I’d foolishly expected that I’d have the time to just look at the entire thing. Really, I don’t know what was going through my head when I’d just walked in there without a plan, but I decided there on a scrambling whim that the things I should prioritize were these:

a) Any history that might involve my alleged family.

b) Any notable records on cases of people with amnesia or who made strange claims about major things happening that couldn’t be verified (an unlikely event to have information on, but I’d hoped it was worth a try.

c) Information about the founding of the city.

d) Any records regarding incidents that occurred as far as people leaving or staying outside of town past nightfall without taking a carriage.

(If any of you believe that I forgot something important, please let me know, and if it’s necessary I’ll go back for a return trip as soon as I can.)

If I’m being entirely honest with you, I think my jaw dropped a little when I went to see the head Archivist at the desk the old woman had pointed me towards. Although it certainly doesn’t compare to many of the cities back where I lived, Myosotia isn’t small (and I’m only just now realizing I’ve never mentioned the name; people pronounce it my-oh-soh-shia, if it’s somehow relevant), and I’ve probably only met less than a fiftieth of them in my time here, so I think you can understand when I say I was surprised to see one of my regulars working in the top position here.

The theatre where I work at is the sort of “dinner and a show” place that you might expect of something from this era; there are tables and chairs for eating at, and a curtained stage for performers to put on a show while the customers enjoy their meals — an incredibly glorious job for those who work up in the spotlight of everyone‘s attention, but not quite so glorious for people like me, who spend our days sweeping floors, taking and delivering orders, and cleaning up tables. I do meet a lot of people, though, and this man was one of them — a semi-regular, in fact, who catches the last show and orders the same chicken casserole with chamomile tea every Tuesday and Thursday as we wind down for closing time. Yes, you heard me right: Thursday. I knew I’d be seeing him again just at the end of my shift later that day.

Clayton, as I knew well that his name was before I even saw the nametag fastened on his chest, greeted me with the same quiet smile that I’ve grown very well accustomed to seeing twice a week on the job — a very unique smile which was pulled farther to the left side of his face than the right — and to my surprise, showed just some small form of recognition that I’d been his server for the past few weeks. Something to note down, I felt: that people in their mundane remembrances can at least recall the faces of the people they’ve interacted with frequently. I admit, my curiosity was burning, so I tested that theory further by bringing up a short conversation we’d had during a day about two resets ago. His reaction was….admittedly, more or less what I expected: he said yes, he remembered, but I could see on his face and in his suddenly avoidant eyes this…deep embarrassment that told me he didn’t actually know what I was talking about, but just didn’t want to seem rude in saying it.

After I’d changed the subject to what I was looking for in the archives, he seemed to be relieved at being released from the uncomfortable situation I’d knowingly placed him in and I took an awkward walk of utter silence behind him, through the rows of tall shelves containing year after year of records and history.

He searched through the shelves and pulled out stacks of books for me, then took me to a table and handed me some gloves before sitting down beside me, pointing out what each record was and where I could find what I was looking for.

I’ll spare you the great details of everything that I found for now and just summarize what I learned (mostly because I didn’t have the time to copy everything word for word without both risking making myself late to my job, and possibly looking suspicious to any potential prying eyes, who I’m not sure even exist, but I definitely don’t want to provoke):

\- There wasn’t much record of my family’s involvement with this city because of the fact that my grandparents were born and mostly lived in the other city up north, about 122 miles/196.34 kilometers west from the cabin I visited, and I’m the first member of the family to move to Myosotia. What I do know is my grandparents had a lumbering company that sometimes sold lumber here to the local shops. Nothing particularly interesting. Clayton said if I want to learn more about my family history, I should visit the city archive in the place my grandparents were born.

\- No known records of any relevance that involve cases of amnesia or people claiming they aren’t from this dimension, but I did get an awkward glance from Clayton when asking about amnesia, who I assume felt I was taking a subtle jab at his inability to remember us having our conversation at the theatre. Great. That’ll make things awkward for awhile.

\- The city of Myosotia was apparently founded 819 years ago in 1340. Yeah. Make sense of that. That’d make this 2159. I don’t understand anything anymore… This is honestly a shock to me. I’ve been too afraid to ask the year since I got here, and it’s not listed on any calendars I’ve seen (another thing I found odd to begin with), so I’ve just been trying to go along in life hoping it’ll come up naturally in conversation. It just…hasn’t. I’m still so confused. This place shouldn’t be like this if it’s even farther into the future than my reality, unless they count years differently than us… I don’t even know what to say here.

\- The first recorded case of someone disappearing outside the city walls was apparently three months after its founding. A young couple went out for a moonlit walk and never were seen returning. The next morning, both families realized their children were missing when they hadn’t returned home for the night. At first, it was assumed they eloped, but asking around Myosotia and a travel to the city up north to look for them led to them coming up empty-handed, and they were officially considered missing. Any searches conducted in which people remained outside the city walls after nightfall without taking and remaining in a carriage until daylight led to their disappearance. For a while, it seems to have been believed that it was a killer hiding outside city walls and preying on anyone they could under cover of darkness, but obviously this has happened consistently, without fail, for longer than any one killer could have survived, so unless it’s a family that carries on the tradition generation after generation, that couldn’t be the case. As far as I was told, there have been a total of 282 recorded cases since the city’s founding.

\- I tried to look into when the tradition of drawing the carriage cabin’s curtains began, but I couldn’t find anything. No record of when it started or ended, and even Clayton said he didn’t have any idea about it. The only thing we could find about the tradition in any important record was one case in 1797 when a man apparently self-admittedly failed to obey the rules one night and went completely mad, later murdering a guard at the city gates and attempting to open the doors in the dead of night to “show everyone the relentless darkness”. There have been other cases of people returning in carriages in a catatonic state or who possessed erratic behavior, but none of them have been provably linked to disobeying the rule.

And that was my time at the archive. Not really the smoking gun I had hoped for, but it’s at least given me some perspective, and, unfortunately, a lot to think about.

I didn’t see Clayton at the theatre today, which marks the first time since the day I started working this job that he’s missed a Thursday, or even either of his usual days. I feel guilty for upsetting him. I suppose the only solace I have is that he’ll have forgotten by the next time I see him.

I should sleep soon. I have work tomorrow, and I’m exhausted from the late night I spent writing my last post. Since apparently I can’t post this for several hours, I’ll set an alarm to get up when I can actually post and then I’ll stay up an hour longer to read comments if you leave any, but otherwise, I’ll be seeing you all tomorrow. Take care.
