2:41 AM. Corte Madera, California. May 20th, 1998. Trujillo Residence. That is a case I will never forget. Me and my partner, one Dahlia Barnet, were responding to a murder case.

A family of five were attacked in the middle of the night by an unknown assailant. All members of the family were subdued, tied up, and then had their heads repeatedly beaten against tables, chairs, floors and other hard surfaces.

Three members of the family, the mother, father and eldest sister, were determined to have died from either severe brain trauma or fractured skulls. The youngest sister was determined to have died to a seizure after the beatings stopped. The son was found with several broken bones and blind in his right eye, yet, responsive. The family dog was found unharmed but deeply frightened.

Nothing was stolen or destroyed, and after giving his testimony, the son left the scene, possibly to go to a relative or friend’s house. After that, it was swept under the rug. Nothing in the news, nothing in the papers. Nothing. And I thought exactly nothing of it for four years after that, until May 20th, 2002, exactly four years after the first incident. An elderly couple were found attacked in that exact way just a couple blocks down from where the first incident occurred. Me and officer Barnet were once again brought to the scene, she brought up how similar it was to the previous case, and when the couple’s daughter, who hid in the bathroom, gave her testimony and walked off, followed by the story getting swept under the rug, I started to get suspicious. So, nearing the 25th anniversary of the first murders, I thought I’d publish my findings here.

- January 19th, 2003. Warwick, Rhode Island. A man by the name of Carter Lewis Jones was found bludgeoned to death in his apartment. Very little coverage outside of an obituary in the papers, which made no precise mention to the cause of his death. A few weeks later, his brother was murdered the same way.

- November 23rd, 2003. San Diego, California. A man by the name of Oswald Ford was found with his head repeatedly smashed into the flatscreen TV in his hotel room until it broke, he was rushed to the hospital, I couldn’t find anything on his fate.

- December 1st, 2007. In Ketchikan, Alaska, a man and his girlfriend were found beaten to death in their home, the woman’s beating was brief while the man’s lasted for a long time after his death.

- March 13th, 2013. An image of a woman’s tied up and bludgeoned body is posted to 4chan. May or may not be tied to these cases.

- June 28th, 2017. An unknown man is rushed to the hospital after being attacked by a home invader, he claims that the attacker fled after he managed to get his back to a wall with a cross on it. The man died two days later.

Throughout all these instances, with the exception of the 4chan post, many similarities become apparent. All victims were men along with their lovers and/or family, and they were all bludgeoned to death. But it doesn’t stop there. Most of these men attended church regularly, but all stopped roughly 5 years before their deaths, they were all frequent contributors to satanist or atheist forums online, and they all had been charged with the murder of Church officials, and in all instances the charges were always dropped for unknown reasons.

However, most interestingly, all these men were either lottery winners or had what they described as “the job of their dreams”.

My theory is that of satanic deals. Riches and happiness in exchange for favours, and when these men become obsolete or fail to provide adequate turnouts, they are disposed of.

My theory has a daunting lack of evidence, I know. And I’ll try to update as I find more info, but for now, something tells me I should be wary of my surroundings. As whoever, or whatever, is trying to keep this under wraps is very determined, and they may not take too kindly to information leaking out.
