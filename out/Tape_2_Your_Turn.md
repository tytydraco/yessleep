I moved into the house a month ago cheap rent, landlord barely spoke a word, just handed me the keys with a kind of twitchy urgency and left without even a handshake. The place is way out in the countryside, middle of Shropshire, surrounded by thick woods that seem to lean in too close, like they’re trying to listen through the windows. The house itself is old, creaky, one of those stone cottages that smells like a mixture of damp plaster and something else. Something sweet and rotten. I chalked that up to mice or mould in the walls and didn’t think much of it. Not at first.  
  
I’ve been slowly unpacking, sorting out which rooms to actually use, it's a three-bedroom, but I live alone, and I only really need one and a half. A week ago, I went up to the attic for the first time. The hatch was stiff and the ladder barely held my weight, but I made it up. It was empty, mostly, except for a box in the far corner and a VHS tape sitting on top. Just a black tape, no label, no case, covered in dust like it had been sitting there untouched for years. I should’ve left it. I know that now. But curiosity’s a hell of a thing.  
  
I still had some of my old film gear, including a dusty CRT monitor and a VHS deck that I used back in uni for editing weird horror shorts. I set it all up in the basement—my thinking was that I’d turn it into a little editing den again. The air down there is always cold, colder than it should be. My breath fogs if I sit down there long enough. I put the tape in, expecting static or some old family recording. Instead, I got this flickering feed of a concrete room. Low-res. No sound at first. Just that deep, grey stillness. A man sat in a plastic chair, naked except for what looked like boxer shorts, his limbs tied tightly with zip ties, his head lolling like he was drugged... or broken.  
  
Then the sound kicked in. It was faint at first. Breathing. Not his. Something else. And then a sound I still hear in my dreams—a sort of wet dragging, like raw meat slapping tile. From the corner of the screen, this… thing emerged. Not an animal. Not a person. It crawled on all fours but its limbs were too long, bending the wrong way. It moved with this horrible speed but made no sound doing so. The man didn’t react. His eyes were wide open, staring at the camera, like he knew I was watching. Like he was waiting for me.  
  
The tape cut out suddenly - just a quick flicker to black - and then a title card in that jumpy, low-res font: TAPE 2: YOUR TURN. The footage that followed made my blood run cold. It was my basement. Exact layout. Same table, same corner with the busted pipe. And there, right in the middle of the room, was the same plastic chair from the first tape. I don’t have a plastic chair. Or… at least I didn’t. When I went back down there, after what felt like hours frozen in my seat, it was there. Right where the tape had shown it.  
  
I haven’t told anyone yet. My phone’s signal is patchy out here, and every time I try to send an email, it just sits in my outbox. I tried to take a picture of the chair, but the image won’t load—it comes out corrupted, like something’s smudging it from the inside. The nights are getting worse. At exactly 3:17 a.m. every night, I hear the floorboards creak. But it’s not footsteps. It’s crawling. Too fast. Like something scraping its way across the wood, stopping just beneath my bed before going silent.  
  
Last night, I tried to leave. Packed a bag, bolted out the front door. Car wouldn’t start. Not a click. Not a cough. Dead. But when I came back inside, something had changed. Every window had been covered up—from the inside. Nailed plywood. I didn’t do that. I don’t even own a hammer. I spent the night in the kitchen with the lights on. At some point, I must’ve dozed off, because when I woke up, there was another VHS tape on the table. This one was labelled.  
  
It just said “**FINAL**.”  
  
I haven’t played it yet. It’s sitting in the deck right now, waiting for me to press play. I’m not sure what’ll happen when I do. I’ve got this pit in my stomach, like whatever’s on that tape isn’t just meant to be watched—it’s meant to complete something. Like I’m part of a ritual I never agreed to.  
  
If you’re reading this and I haven’t posted an update in the next 24 hours… don’t look for me. Don’t come to the house. Don’t touch the tapes.  
*They watch you back.*
