Three nights ago, the world had gone silent.

When night came, it brought shadows that moved like smoke. People vanished—first neighbors, then loved ones, then strangers who left empty streets and abandoned cars. No screams, no resistance, just a collective disappearance into darkness.

Sterling escaped with his family, fleeing away from the city. He had to get away, far away, where the darkness could not claim them.

As the sun began to fade in the sky, Sterling drove over dirt trails in the desert hills, and a lone house appeared in the distance silhouetted against the orange smear of the horizon. Perched on a cliff’s edge, it was a modern structure of glass and steel, its sharp lines catching the dying light.

The driveway crunched beneath the wheels as they approached. No birds cried, no wind stirred the long grass. The world held its breath.

The front door was not locked. 

Inside, the air was cool and still, carrying the faint scent of wood polish and dried paint. The house was pristine, brand new, and fresh. A winter home for some wealthy family, maybe. The walls rose high, bare and white, save a few impressionist pieces of gray paint splatter. Sparsely decorated, it had a bowl of fresh fruit in the kitchen, and a refrigerator that was empty save a single pitcher of filtered water, still full.

“We’ll stay here tonight,” Sterling said, his voice low.

Sterling began methodically checking the doors and windows, his movements mechanical. He closed the blinds, shutting out the growing darkness. Night pressed against the glass, black and impenetrable, as if the house floated in a blank void, an impossibly dark space.

It wasn’t long before they heard it.

A faint shuffling, barely audible over their own breathing. Sterling froze. The sound came again, this time clearer—a scrape, a breath, a presence. It came from the pantry.

Sterling’s heart pounded as he approached, the floorboards creaking beneath his weight. He opened the pantry door in a single, jerking motion.

A man crouched inside, his eyes wide and bloodshot, his chest heaving. He raised his hands defensively. “Please,” he whispered, his voice cracked and dry. “Don’t hurt me.”

The man’s name was Marcus, and his story spilled out in fragments—how he’d stumbled upon the house that morning, how he’d hidden at the first sound of footsteps, how he thought Sterling and his family were the shadow people.

Sterling didn’t trust him, but he let him stay. There was nowhere else to go.

“Help me secure the house,” said Sterling.

Marcus nodded his head, and they continued to check the doors and windows. The upstairs was empty, furnished in the same simple, sterile furniture. All the beds were still made.

When Sterling descended the stairs into the living room, a figure was standing with Marcus.

“This is Kim,” said Marcus. “My girlfriend.”

Sterling was confused momentarily. She had not been hiding with him, and he did not know where she came from. But there was no time to argue—the night had come.

The first growl was low and guttural, echoing from somewhere outside. Sterling stiffened, his breath catching. Another growl followed, closer this time, accompanied by the sound of paws moving over gravel.

“The dogs—they’re with them now. They can smell us.” Marcus whispered, his voice trembling. 

Sterling already knew. Before the people disappeared, it was the dogs that betrayed humanity. They joined whatever was in the darkness, and sniffed out what was left of humanity, leading their new masters to their quarry.

Sterling grabbed towels from the bathroom and shoved them under the doorframes, trying to block their scent. The dogs’ sniffing grew louder, their claws scraping at the wood. The family huddled in the dim light, their breaths shallow, their eyes darting to every sound.

Each night it happened in threes. The first was the dogs to find you. Then, it was the shadow people to tempt you.

Faint at first, like a breeze slipping through a crack, but soon distinct. Voices, human voices. Sterling peered through the blinds, his pulse hammering in his throat.

Figures stood outside, just beyond the reach of the house’s lights. They were familiar—achingly so. His first-grade teacher, her cardigan neat and her hair in its usual bun. The old neighbor who used to tend her roses every morning. A man Sterling barely remembered from a childhood baseball team.

“Sterling,” they called, their voices warm and inviting. “It’s okay. Come outside. You’ll be safe.”

Sterling’s hands trembled as he let the blinds fall shut. “They’re not real,” he muttered to himself.

When he turned back, his youngest daughter was gone.

“Where is she?” said Sterling to his wife, in a whispered panic.

He found her at the front door. It was wide open, the towels kicked to the side. Her small hand was clasped in Kim’s. The woman’s voice was sweet, almost hypnotic. “You’ll be safe in the dark. They won’t hurt you,” she said.

Sterling lunged, pulling his daughter back. Kim’s face remained calm, her eyes glassy, as she stepped backward through the doorway and into the shadows.

“Marcus,” she called softly. “Come outside with me.”

Marcus approached the doorway from behind Sterling. Tears streamed down his face. 

“I’m sorry,” he choked out before walking past Sterling and into the night. He took her hand, and they walked like that into the darkness, beyond the light of the house. His screams came moments later, sharp and brief.

Inside, Sterling in a panicked rush locked the door and shoved the towel beneath. His older daughter tapped him on the shoulder, and pointed up to the ceiling. A security camera in the corner swiveled, accompanied by a soft mechanical whir.

“We’re being watched,” said Sterling.

Sterling slammed his hands against the wall, and began searching. Following the wall around the corner he found it, a security panel. He ripped it from the wall, exposing wires that led directly down. He sprinted around to the other side, and saw the pantry. He began moving brooms and things aside and inspecting the wall, before looking down at a rig. He lifted it up, and beneath it, he found a hatch.

Sterling walked back out to the kitchen, his wife holding his two daughters behind him, watching. And Sterling tore through the drawers, slamming silverware, until he found a knife and a wooden mallet.

Inserting the knife into the latch on the trap door, he began pounding on it, forcing it to break the locking mechanism. And as he did, the third phase began.

The shadow walker arrived.

It loomed over the house, a towering figure of impossible proportions. Its shape was humanoid but indistinct. The giant began to tap on the roof. The sound was loud and deliberate, each tap shaking the walls.

Sterling hammered the knife again. And the tap from above rattled the entire home. An enormous hand flashed across the blinds as it moved down to the front door, and with a single finger it knocked, cracking the molding around the door and breaking its hinges.

Sterling beat the knife one last time, and the trap door gave way. He sent his wife down first, and then handed her the girls one by one, before going down himself. 

It was a few short steps down into the panic room. The walls were bare and concrete, and it was cold. In front of them was an elderly couple, huddled inside, watching a monitor. Their faces were pale. They were terrified.

On the monitors, the shadow walker’s form filled the screen, its immense hand reaching down toward the house.

“We won’t hurt you,” said Sterling. “We just need somewhere to be safe for the night.”

The couple didn’t look at Sterling, they stared in horror at his wife and children.

“It’s safe in the night, daddy,” said the youngest.

“Come outside,” said the other.

The old man leaned over and played back the surveillance footage. Sterling watched in growing shock. It was him, arriving at the house just before sunset—he had arrived alone. His children had been taken the first night, led by their own dog into the darkness. His wife had gone to them soon after.

His wife opened the hatch. His children smiled, serene and calm, as they took his hands.

Sterling followed them into the night. Above, the house was gone, torn from its foundation. The colossal being stood there, twice the size of the missing house, its form shivering and imperceivable, surrounded by the shadow forms of everyone he’d ever known, ever loved. Then it took him, too.
