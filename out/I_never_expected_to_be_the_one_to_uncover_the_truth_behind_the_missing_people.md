 

It was a dark and stormy night when I first saw the strange figure in the woods. I was driving home from a late shift at the hospital, my headlights barely piercing the darkness as I navigated the winding roads.

Suddenly, a figure appeared out of nowhere, standing in the middle of the road. I slammed on the brakes, but it was too late. The car hit the figure with a sickening thud, and I heard a faint cry of pain.

Panicked, I threw open the door and ran to the figure lying in the road. It was a woman, her face contorted in pain. She was barely conscious, but she managed to whisper one word before she lost consciousness: "Help."

I knew I had to get her to the hospital as quickly as possible. I lifted her into the car and sped off into the night, my heart racing as I navigated the treacherous roads.

When we arrived at the hospital, I rushed the woman into the emergency room and called for help. The doctors and nurses rushed to her side, and I watched in horror as they worked to save her life.

But as the night wore on, it became clear that the woman was not going to survive. As she took her last breath, she reached out and grabbed my hand, her eyes fixed on mine.

"You have to find the others," she whispered. "They're in danger."

I didn't know what she meant, but her words stayed with me as I left the hospital and headed home.

Over the next few days, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about the woman's death. It was as if she had been trying to tell me something, and I knew I had to find out what it was.

I began to investigate, and what I discovered was shocking. The woman had been part of a group of people who had gone missing in the woods a few months earlier. No one knew what had happened to them, but there were rumors of strange figures lurking in the shadows, watching from the trees.

I knew I had to find the others, but I had no idea where to start. I searched the woods for days, my flashlight barely piercing the darkness as I called out for any sign of life.

And then, one night, I heard a faint cry for help. I followed the sound to a clearing, and there, huddled in the center, were the missing people. They were scared and disoriented, but they were alive.

I knew I had to get them out of there as quickly as possible. I led them through the woods, my heart racing as we ran through the darkness. And when we finally emerged from the trees and saw the headlights of a rescue vehicle, I knew we had made it.

As we were loaded into the ambulance, I couldn't shake the feeling that we were being watched. I turned around and saw a group of  figures standing in the trees, their eyes fixed on us as we drove away.

I never knew who those figures were, or what they wanted from us. But I knew one thing for certain: we had narrowly escaped a fate worse than death.

The missing people were reunited with their families and, eventually, the investigation into their disappearance was closed. But I couldn't shake the feeling that we had only scratched the surface of what had really happened in those woods.

To this day, I still wonder about the strange figures that lurked in the shadows, watching us as we fled for our lives. And I can't help but feel that, one day, they'll come back for us.
