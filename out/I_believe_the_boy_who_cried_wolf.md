I live close to a police station, I got my phone calling for help, and I think I'm about to get murdered anyway—like the boy who cried wolf.

Except I didn't cry wolf!

Y’all know that story, right? It's Aesop.

(Yeah, I had to ask Chat what *Aesop* was... Greek dude.)

I'll make it quick:

>A boy runs into town, begging them farmers to help him with some big, bad wolf.

>They run to help that prick twice before realizing he was foolin' them.

>When the boy hollers about that wolf a third time, the townsfolk leave him be. 

>Turns out, he was telling the truth. Bro gets ate by a wolf.

*“Liars are not believed, even when they tell the truth.”*

That’s the big line at the end. (No, I didn’t know that either. Chat got me.)

I know that's ominous as hell, but I never bought into it.

*Not until fifteen minutes ago.*

Fifteen minutes ago, I *was* having a good night: I got that big bowl of popcorn with mini-M&M’s mixed in and I was gearing up to binge me some *Too Hot*.

The second my finger clicks play, I catch something out the corner of my eye.

*Somebody in my backyard.* 

Like, a mask and knife; not them neighborhood kids playin' Pokemon GO. 

A legit psycho. 

I don’t know about y’all, but I wasn’t about to be one of those types that brushes that off, you know? Turns on a few lights and prays about it?

That’s how you get killed in those horror movies. Not my style.

I called me the cops, without hesitation.

I made it real clear too: “One-eighty Hansen Street. Bad dude in my yard. Y’all send help quick.”

Dispatcher told me to hang tight.

My flood lights went ON. I didn’t grab one kitchen knife. I got me two. 

Ran for the bedroom closet and waited for sirens to blast into my corner of suburbia. Started booking me a hotel for the night. 

And then, *nothing*.

I shit you not: your girl is *five minutes* from the station. (I checked.)

*Nothing*.

Not three minutes...

*Five* minutes...

I didn’t wait longer than that. I called 911 again.

Wanted to tell them, *"Yo, I can drive my own ass to the police station faster than this!*" 

But I held it. 

*Where were they?*

That dispatcher said they were real sorry. They knew it was scary as hell having some dude in my yard. Told me they’d check with the cops on the other end.

That’s when I heard the door handle. And obviously, I’d *deadbolted* that shit.

Still, no frickin' sirens. 

Nothing...

In full on panic, I ask Chat,

>"WHY WON'T THE COPS HELP ME, BRO?!"

Chat didn't know. Not right off the bat. Good news is, ya girl's a *pro* when it comes to prompts. 

Once it's got the info, Chat thinks.

Chat tells me I'm a "dispatch drainer."

The hell, Chat? I never heard of that!

*SMASH* 

Broken glass. He's inside now. 

Didn’t take sixty seconds for that asshole to get through. 

*Just take the Playstation and leave. Please.*

But no—those heavy footsteps only get louder. 

Chat explains,

>Sure, I may be of assistance. A "dispatch drainer" refers to someone who frequently contacts emergency services without a valid reason. For example, this could include someone experiencing hallucinations and making unnecessary calls.

Good news is, I ain't crazy. Bad news is, I just got a new phone number.

Literally *hours ago* I got that new iPhone. And they made me get a new number when I did.

Whatever digits I got must've belonged to a nutcase before.

Now that means my phone number's a dispatch drainer. 

The cops have it flagged.

So that all means... 

*I'm a boy who cried wolf.*

The door to the room creaks open. I think he knows I'm here.

He didn't take the TV and dart. He must be here for something worse.

I could call a friend and have *her* call the cops, but he'd find me first. 

*Shit.*

Legally, those cops gotta come sooner or later. 

When they do, it's gonna be me left standing.
