 Firstly I want to say this might be a bit aimless as I haven’t been quite right in the head since everything went down.  This has made me want to not return to my bedroom or house since it happened.  And I figured I might as well share it with you all.


  So for about two days before this I had strep throat and a fever, so I had to endure hours of lying around and feeling like my throat was full of glass, sand, and sharp rocks.  I was laying down in bed, my head burning up, listening to the oddly comforting drone of my ac.  I think I fell asleep after about twenty or so minutes. And had a weird dream about things I don’t remember, and probably don’t want to.  One thing I prominently remembered about it was a strange human figure that had no forearms and looked completely skinned.  I think I somehow knew it was fine with that and was not in pain.  And I woke up at I believe about 4:00.


  I rolled around in bed for a while still half asleep.  I finally opened my eyes and saw that my closet was ajar and shaking slightly.  I thought noting of this as I knew my house was on a hill.  I reached over grabbed my iPad off my nightstand that I still preferred over a phone, and groggily opened it up, blinding me with its brightness.  I watched YouTube for a while to pass the time, as I did that I heard my brother open up his door on my right and walk through my room to the other door on my left that led to the stairs.  I noticed he was up early which I assumed was because he was preparing to go to his friend’s house.  After a while I remembered something, he had left at 6:00 pm the day before.  This terrified me as I hadn’t seen him because I was looking at my screen. As he came back up, I got a good look at what I thought was my brother. He looked like a cruel parody of the monopoly man, short thick legs, a gargantuan stomach, a giant white moustache that was crusted with maroon liquid, a bulbous round head, black coat and white vest, and a cartoonishly sized monocle.  The instant I saw him he whirled around and stared with glee at me.
“Wax or resin?” He asked.
I responded with a frightened “What?”
“Wax or resin?”
“I don’t know what you mean.”
“JUST PICK ONE!” He screamed with sudden intensity.
“What am I even choosing?”
“JUST HURRY UP AND PICK ONE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!”
“FINE WHATEVER RESIN!”
He instantly changed to a giddy demeanor.
“Great!”


He quickly hopped into my brother’s room and brought out the creature from my dream.  It was just as I had dreamed of with no forearms and only muscle and sinew with no skin.  It had completely white eyes and no mouth.  It seemed to be a male and was very pleased.  The monopoly man pulled a tub of resin out of my closet and started dumping it over the abomination.   It quickly hardened into a thick coating around it.  
“Thank you and good day!” He squealed.


 It’s been a while since then and my brother came back at 8:00.  His friend has gone missing and I have an idea as to what happened to him. What scares me even more is that at midnight yesterday I swear, while I was sleeping someone whispered something that chilled me to the bone.
“You’ll have to choose once more, this time with a few more options and a few more subjects.”
Today my brother said he’s going out again with his group of friends.
