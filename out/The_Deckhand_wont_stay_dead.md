My daughter told me to post my story on here. I don’t really know how to work the internet that well but she said you guys could help.

I’ve been a fisherman for thirty years off the coast of Maine. It’s hard work, but I wouldn’t want to do anything else.

The sea is a harsh home to make. She takes what she wants from you and doesn’t ever let it go.

I guess what I’m trying to say is I’ve seen a lot in my thirty years. I’ve seen men lose fingers, lose their minds, lose their lives. I’ve buried good friends. But what I’ve been seeing the last few weeks is unlike anything I’ve known.

This whole thing started when we took on a new deckhand a few weeks back. Quiet fella — skin scored like he’d worked twice as many years as he had. Clothes hung off him in rags, and he walked like every step was heavier than the last. He smiled when we shook hands, faint and unreadable, and the first thing out of his mouth wasn’t about the weather or the work. He just asked me my name.

Out of habit I told him. Didn’t think a thing of it.

He kept to himself after that. Barely spoke, but he moved around the nets like he’d been born with a line in his hands. For three days he worked beside us. Never complained, never laughed, never swore when the lines snarled. He just kept that faint smile and pulled his weight. The others said maybe he was shy, or half-mad from whatever scars he carried. I didn’t much care. A man who does his job without fuss is a fine man to have aboard.

On the third night the weather turned. Nothing unusual for the season — sky gone black, wind tearing at our jackets, sea heaving like a beast. We’d ridden out worse. But sometime after midnight, when the deck pitched and spray came down in sheets, I looked up and he was gone, one slip of the rope and the wind closed its mark. No shout, no splash, no flailing arms. Just gone over the side.

We dragged nets until our arms ached. We circled back and called his name until our throats went raw. The sea doesn’t give back what she’s taken. By dawn we all knew we’d lost him.

That was the night the dreams started.

I was on deck in the dark — nearly pitch black — and at first all you could hear was the sea chewing at the hull. Then, slow as a tide, a ragged wheeze rose through the air and it drowned the water. I looked around in the dream trying to find it. The sound came from everywhere.

Then I saw him.

He stood at the far end of the deck, clothes dripping, hair plastered to his face. Rope trailed behind him like a broken tail. He didn’t speak. Didn’t move. He only breathed — heavy, uneven, too close no matter how far he was.

I jolted awake in my bunk, soaked like I’d been dragged under. My chest burned. I pulled my shirt open to a red line across my ribs — a rope’s shape dug into flesh.

At first I blamed a twisted blanket or a bruise from the bunk. When I went to lace my boots, I found a knot tied into the laces — a clean sailor’s knot, the sort you don’t undo without a knife. I hadn’t tied it. None of the men claimed they had.

The next few days passed without much incident. The salt stung my chest and the smell of diesel and hard work kept me moving through the day. We hauled, we mended, we gutted fish. The routine helped, but it didn’t stop the nights.

The dreams came back almost every night. The breathing always started first, then the dragging — rope across wet wood — then him, standing there, smiling faint like the day he asked my name.

I asked the crew if they’d noticed anything strange after a week or so. I even asked straight out if they remembered the deckhand who’d gone over. They just stared at me. Said no new man had signed on this season, no one missing from the roster, no bunk left empty. One of them asked if I was feeling all right. I didn’t press it. I knew what I’d seen and what he’d asked, but for a while I wondered if I was the one who’d lost my mind.

Last night the dream changed. He stood closer, the rope tightening around my chest like a vise, its frayed ends dripping seawater that pooled in the shadows of the deck. A chorus of wet gasps rose, dragging me toward a darkened hold I couldn’t escape — the voices of lost crew echoing through the black. I woke gasping; the red line on my ribs was darker, and a fresh knot had strangled my fishing line — tied by no hand I know. The sea has been whispering my name all day, and I found damp rope ends tangled in the nets.

When the sea calls, you answer — and I can feel her hand on me already. If anybody else has heard these whisperings, tell me. I need to know I’m not the only one.
