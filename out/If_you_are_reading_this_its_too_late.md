By now I guess I should introduce myself. My name is Sam, I am 16 years old. And like you I have gotten sucked into the endless loop of Reddit stories. It starts with one intriguing story but doesn’t end with one…. It never ends at all. I know this because I am living through the never ending hell of it. There is only so many horror stories you can read before they become your reality. Which is exactly what has happened to me. Every corner I see there are shadows there to greet me. I see faces in the cracks of semi open doors. They always seem to be watching… it is too late for me. I’m not sure of the last time I slept but it must have been awhile, because I am exhausted beyond compare. I have lost almost all concepts of time. I feel foreign to my own body. I have no realization to what is real and what isn’t. I do not recognize the people I used to know as my family, they are all filled with static. Everything is a blurry haze. I don’t know how long I have before I am just another story. So I apologize for this being all over the place. I am slowly slipping from the consciousness I have known and found safety in for the past 16 years of my life. 


Soon, I will be in a subconscious that I have up til now, unknowingly created. I have no ideas as to which horrors I will indure. Most likely one of the hundreds I have read and obsessed over. But it isn’t too late for you. There is still hope.

Now, before I help you escape I want you to promise to cherish your life. The good, the bad, the ugly…. All of it, because it makes you the person you are today. Love and cherish your family and friends, hug them tight. Because there is a chance that your tomorrow is indeed promised.  If you are panicked by now, I must apologize. That was not my true intention. Keep yourself calm, because now I need you to listen closely. I have spent what I am convinced is my last moments before THEY take me, writing this as a warning to you. So as this story comes to an end, AS I come to an end. I will try and help you escape.
