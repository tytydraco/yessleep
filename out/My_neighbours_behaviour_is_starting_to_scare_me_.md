I live in a very secluded part of the town where only few people actually live , i chose to live here because I thought it would be very peaceful here and i can here in my room alone and get my work done more quickly and as a result have more time to myself and who knows maybe my boss will get impressed and give me a promotion ... 

But ofcourse my luck is not even that good , right next to my house lives an old women who is literally the most weirdest person I have ever met in my entire life , I visited the other people of the area when I first came here to get to know each other and built a good relationship with my neighbours and most of them were actually pretty chill guys , except one of them ofcourse , that old women , her name is Samantha and she is 58 years old , her husband and her kids left her and went to a different place which was probably the reason she went mad like this , one of my friend from this area told me that many people think she uses black magic to try to get her family back , he said these were just assumptions though , most of the people here wer very scared to talk to her mainly because of her weird behaviour and rudeness .

when I first went to talk to her and told her that I was her new neighbour she glanced at me like I was a damn terrorist and closed the door on me ... Apart from her though this was actually a very nice place to live in ... But now i fear for my life , I think she's is more than just a weird lady who had a mental problem 


The screams: I was in my bed sleeping peacefully after a hard day at work just when I woke up to a blood curdling scream , I jumped out of bed , took some time to cook myself down because if I didn't I would have gotten a heart attack , and looked outside of window to see the old women wearing a black mask crying in the road at the middle of the freaking night , I saw some of my neighbours come out of their houses , looking more annoyed than scared for some reason , and helped her get inside her house , she was screaming and crying and telling to let her go but the neighbours ofcourse couldn't care less about what she was saying , she took her inside and just begged her to sleep and not do that again .. 

next day I went outside and asked the neighbours what the hell was that and i discovered that it was not a rare occurrence , she used to do this almost every few nights before the neighbours decided that had have enough and admited her to a mental hospital ... After few months she came back and the late night reactions did stop for few months but now she is back to the old habits , but something way scarier happened few days later ...


I was sitting at my desk working on a project , it had rained that day so it was the perfect time to listen to some music while i got lost in my work , it was around 1am and I was feeling really sleepy but I was determined to complete the work so after drinking yet another cup of coffee I started working like a robot once again with complete focus now , and that's when I first noticed it , two full black eyes looking at me through the window , i was frozen in my chair for few moments , the thing at my window didn't move a muscle , it kept staring at me with a weird grin on its face , I screamed as hard as I could , that thing once again didn't even flinch . I ran out of my room and grabbed a baseball bat and went outside , that's when I saw the lady , who was sitting on the mango tree right next to my bedroom window where I was doing my work , I was very confused , how the hell did a women like her who looks like she hadn't eaten anything in 9 days able to climb that think tree all by herself specially ... But i was more furious than i was confused , i wanted to scream at her for scaring me half to death but I just stood there in scilence , unable to comprehend wtf just happened ... My other neighbours told me that it was the first time she had done something like this , she usually kept the weird shit to herself and never invaded someone private life  , so I was even more angry , why the hell did she target me then , I was the new one here , she should have atleast kept me away from all this weird shit 


Now these were the things that a mental patient would usually do , but this was just the tip of the iceberg , now I'm going to tell you something that I've told no one because I just know that they won't fucking belive me ...


So I have a window in my kitchen that gives me the full view of her house and even the backside area which had no fence so the forest was directly connected to her house , which made cooking food not so fun , like cooking is never fun but having to look at her creepy house everytime I have to make breakfast or lunch just gives a weird vibe , that's why I generally just get something from the market for dinner because I have no intention of looking at the house at night  , her house looks like the house they use for shooting a horror movie , like it was so accurate to a stereotypical horror house ... She also had a small garden which just had dead plants , I think she just planted those and then just forgot about them , 

So one night i came downstairs to grab one glass of water when I saw the weird lady , outside of her house , i thought that she was about to have those mental breakdowns once again but then I saw something in her hands , it was a knife , and I think there was something dripping from it , she looked around her house and went in again , I don't know why but i was just not feeling tired and sleepy now , like my brain is too interested in this women's activities to be sleeping right now , so I stood there , drinking my water slowly , and that's when she came out of the backdoor , dragging something , and when I realised what it was , my soul left my body .

 it was the body of a naked human , that person was chained , it's hands had these deep holes in them , that person's hands and legs were definitely broken , that old women kept pulling that body towards the forest like it was a lightweight dog on a leash , and that's when she lifted the knife , and stabbed it right into the eyes of the person .. I don't know what was worse , the stab or the fact that the person flinched in pain , indicating that the individual was still alive and was feeling every moment of it , then she did it again to the other eye , I couldn't hold it any longer and made a loud gasp sound ... And then she looked at me , I had no fucking idea how she heard me but she did , she looked and me with those black eyes I saw on the window , that evil smile still painted on her face , she stared at me for a while , and it felt like I could move , she had highjacked my brain ... I finally got out of the paralysis state of ran to my bedroom and shut the door .

 few minutes later I heard knocking at my door , I knew exactly who ir was but I still went to check anyway , IT WAS HER , COMPLETELY DRAINED IN BLOOD , HOLDING KNIFE IN ONE HAND AND A PLASTIC BIG IN THE OTHER ONE ... 


I woke up the day after in my living room , having an extreme headache , that's when I thought about what had happened last night . â€œ wtf was that " I asked to myself ,  it couldn't have been a dream , brain cannot create such realistic and detailed dreams , i thought about calling the police for once but then I decided that I would just go for a walk to calm my mind down, i mean it could have been a dream afterall , I know about the powers of our brain , so I wore my boots and opened the door

and then I saw a plastic bag ... Covered in blood , and when I opened the plastic bag , I saw three things , decapitated head of two human beings , so severely damaged that it was hard to understand if it was the face of a man or a women , alongside of a knife , with a note stick to it ... The note read 

" YOU SAW TOO MUCH , YOU SHOULD NEVER KNOW TOO MUCH "
