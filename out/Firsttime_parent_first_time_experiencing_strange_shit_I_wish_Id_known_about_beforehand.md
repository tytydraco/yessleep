I made it out of this alive. I wish I could say the same for everyone, but life sucks sometimes, and I’m just a passenger.

-----------------

I wanted to tell my wife to stop provoking the psychopath in the cape, but I couldn’t talk. No matter how hard I pushed, the only physical sensation I could produce was the feeling of gas moving through my colon. 

The thin man looked pissed and was clearly out for blood.

I think that helplessness is the greatest of all fears, because every terror is rooted in it. [Until you’ve prepared yourself to watch your family die while completely paralyzed](https://redd.it/13gfxfr), you haven’t experienced the level of fear that a human mind can endure. 

Malvern breathed in slowly. I don’t know how to explain the fact that I *felt* his anger as he pulled air from around me; the emotions tumbled through the night like leaves caught in a wind, helpless to dance as he pleased. I was afraid and angry because that’s what blew through me. 

Still paralyzed, I was unable even to wince as the bolt shot from Malvern to Kimmy. I would have thrown myself in its path if I had been able to stand, but could only watch what happened to my wife. 

Vertigo spun me as I felt reality swirl. The world seemed to twirl as the energy moved around Kimmy like a physical object, banking half a turn and firing back at Malvern. 

“YOU BITCH-”

He only had time to speak those two words before his own rebounded energy consumed him in a deafening roar. 

I couldn’t cover my ears as the sound became painfully loud, and I couldn’t wipe my face when one of Malvern’s eyeballs landed on my cheek with a *splorch.* 

God *damn* is it creepy staring at a de-faced eyeball when neither of you can blink. 

“Ella,” my wife wheezed, “take care of Daddy.”

“Da?” my two-year-old asked.

“Yes, hun,” Kimmy answered. She sounded like she’d lived a thousand lifetimes. “Take him to the car.”

I had some questions.

But a man needs both fine and gross motor movements to question things, so I just had to go with the flow as my daughter grabbed my ankle and hefted me before toddling toward the car. She moved my 191.3-pound frame like it was a blanket, dragging my face with ease over dirt and rock alike. Upon arriving at my wife’s car, Ella tossed me against its side with a *thud.*

“Good girl,” Kimmy breathed as she leaned next to me.

My frozen insides dropped ten degrees. 

Kimmy’s waist was stained with dark red blood. “I know that you’re staring, Russ, even when you can’t move your eyes,” she answered without looking at me. “Yeah, it’s bad. Turning Malvern’s own work against him was effective, but it came at a cost.” She chuckled before devolving into a coughing fit. “It was worse for him, though, wasn’t it? That inverted colon will be the least of his worries once he realizes the long-term damage I’ve inflicted.”

She staggered into a kneeling position. “Come here, baby girl,” she cooed at Ella. “Let’s get Mr. Bun to keep you company in your car seat, okay?”

The next minute was dominated by a fussy toddler fighting a gravely wounded woman’s attempts to get her into a car as her paralyzed husband did nothing to help. 

“Okay,” Kimmy sighed, finally collapsing next to me. She smelled like copper and sweat. “You probably have some questions, Russ.” She stroked my scalp, sending tingles through my body. “I’m sorry to bear bad news, but you’re not going to get the answers you want. Not yet, anyway.” She winced, gingerly cradling her slender waist. “I had to accept a certain amount of damage to put Malvern in his place. I’ll never be quite the same, but I have a few tricks up my sleeve to stop the bleeding.” Her nimble fingers danced down my cheek. “I know you,” she cooed.

Then she grabbed my dick.

“Just as I suspected, Russ. All *voluntary* muscle movement has been suspended. I knew you had a thing for women in power ever since that one time you asked me to dress up like Xena.”

I did *not* appreciate several insinuations, allegations, and implications. 

I also did not have the tools to voice my discontent.

In addition, I lacked the tools to reject my wife’s pulling down my pants and sliding myself into her. I was powerless against her, and could do nothing as an involuntary fart breathed into the night. 

Kimmy had executed such a take-no-prisoners, badass move that even my involuntary breathing faltered. 

Of course, she was right about the ‘women in power thing.’

“Are you fucking serious, Russ?” she squeaked. “It’s been less than ten seconds.” She sighed. “Whatever. This will be enough to stop the bleeding.”

I had more questions. 

“I know you have questions, Russ, but we don’t have time for that kind of shit right now. Harvesting your seed is only a temporary fix.” 

She reached into the car and pulled Ella from her seat. “Get Daddy into the car, okay, sweetie? He’s too heavy for me to lift.”

“Ghaaa-thxxxx,” my daughter responded. Then she bent down and heaved me inside with a single movement.

I bounced around the back seat, pain rocketing through me as my limp limbs and rigid dick bounced painfully against tight spaces while I could not adjust.

When I finally got my bearings straight, I realized that we were moving. Ella was strapped safely into her car seat, and Kimmy was squinting as she drove into darkness. 

“I tried to keep you out of this, Russ,” she explained, wiping her eyes. “You don’t stand a chance in our world.” She let out a trembling sigh. “I’m so, so sorry. I wish I had done so *many* things differently.” Kimmy shook her head. “But it’s too late. You’re in it with us now.” 

She let out a small gasp.
