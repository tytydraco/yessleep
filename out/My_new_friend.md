It all started 12 years ago, and I can't stop it.

Most of my childhood was average,  I lived with my younger sister Lilian who was 9 years old at the time, my mom, and my dad, I would dare to say I was happy before everything started.

We lived in a quiet town, one of those where you know everybody, where you don't pay any mind to the people around you, we were supposed to be safe, it all started when my sister disappeared.

Just like that, we went to sleep after dinner that night and they were gone by morning time, just gone, erased, the only trace left behind, sitting on top of my bed, a letter read:

*My new friend, we'll be gone for a while, I wanted to play, and I finally can, it's time for us to go but don't worry, and don't feel alone, I know how that feels and your sister will never feel that way again.*

*ill come for you someday David.*

*P.s. This letter is* ***only for you***\*, you'll keep it safe for me, won't you? I know you will my good boy.\*

My mother was the first one to notice her absence I still feel sick to my stomach just remembering the way she screamed when she noticed her daughter was gone, my dad rushed from downstairs to their room just to find my mom on the ground holding the little doll Lilian always kept in her arms, by the time the police arrived I had already found the letter, I wanted to tell them, I really did, but the words wouldn't come out, every time I tried to say something I just felt so sick, something about the way he wrote it  ❝***ONLY FOR YOU***❞ I knew what that meant, if I wanted to see my sister again I would keep my mouth shut, and so I did.

The police did their best, but after 2 months the trail went cold, the whole town had a dreadful feeling, that false sense of security that for so many years had loomed over us suddenly broke, and we were left with nothing.

My mom killed herself not two weeks after that, her heart couldn't deal with the pain and she slit her wrists in the bathroom at the bank where she worked, one of her coworkers found her, I would have cried but the day my sister disappeared I saw it in her eyes, she was already dead at that moment, and just like that my mom was dead, my sister was missing and the letter, the only thing I could think about was the letter, every night I read it, trying to find a clue, trying to find a way to get my family back.

I stopped going out, and people looked at me with a hateful sentiment, I was a reminder after all that the town was not a safe haven, instead of supporting us as they should have, they invented a story where I abused and killed my sister, that my mom couldn't take the guilt of covering up the truth anymore and that's why she killed herself, it was easier to blame me than to fear of the unknown.

I knew the truth, I knew one of these bastards took my sister, it had to be someone from the town, it's just too much of a coincidence, why would they come here? why my house? it didn't make sense, I was alone in my room trying to figure it out, then I heard it

”hey David” a dark, playful, and rusty voice that was filled with malice I couldn't quite locate said.

”Who are you" I responded trembling with fear.

”Ohh silly David, how quickly you forget, you know who I am don't you??, as I told you before I'm your new friend of course"

At that moment I realized, he was it, he took my sister, I started to scream at him  ”where the hell are you, bring back my sister you bastard”

”hey hey David buddy play nice”, he said in a mocking way, ”do you want to see me?”  ”i can show you”

”show me,” I said, at that moment my fight or flight instinct was frozen, I just wanted to run out of there, I couldn't move

And from the darkest corner of the room he came out, a pale figure not human but not inhuman either, he was tall, taller than any regular human I've ever seen and his skin was almost white as if he hadn't been in the sun ever, I could see it in his eyes, whatever he was there was hell in his eyes, wide open, with a smile so cheerful almost maniac, he craved for death or at least that's what it looked like.

”wha, ww,w, what the hell are you?” I said

his smiled disappeared and the cheerful and playful tone in his voice did too.

”i told you, I'm your new friend”
