Ever since I was a kid, my grandma's house had been a source of fascination and fear. It was a massive, creaky Victorian monstrosity that seemed to breathe with every gust of wind. My siblings and I used to play hide and seek there, and while they loved it, I always felt uneasy. There was one room, in particular, that terrified me: the locked attic room.



My grandma had always been clear that no one was allowed in that room. As a curious child, I asked her why, and she just gave me a stern look and said, "There are some things better left alone." That only made me more curious, of course. I spent countless nights lying awake, wondering what could be inside.



Fast forward to last summer. I was now 24 and had moved back to my hometown for a new job. Grandma had passed away two years prior, and the house was still in our family. My parents were thinking of selling it, but they hadn’t gotten around to it yet. I volunteered to spend a few nights there to sort through her belongings.



Being back in that house alone was both nostalgic and unnerving. The first couple of nights were uneventful. I wandered through the rooms, lost in memories, occasionally packing away items for donation. But on the third night, my curiosity got the better of me.



I stood before the attic door, the old brass key heavy in my hand. I had found it in Grandma’s jewelry box. The door loomed, and a shiver ran down my spine as I slid the key into the lock. It turned with a loud click, and the door creaked open to reveal a narrow, dark staircase.



I hesitated, staring into the blackness. My phone’s flashlight cut through the dark, illuminating dust particles suspended in the air. The stairs groaned under my weight as I ascended, the air growing colder with each step.



At the top was another door, this one with an old-fashioned keyhole. I bent down and peered through it, my curiosity winning over my fear.



What I saw made my blood run cold.



Inside the room, there was a single chair facing away from me, with a dim light casting long shadows. A figure sat in the chair, unmoving. My heart pounded in my chest as I strained to see more details. The figure’s head slowly turned, and I stumbled back, falling against the wall. I hadn’t seen a face, just a mass of darkness where a face should be.



I bolted downstairs, my mind racing. I couldn’t call anyone – who would believe me? I tried to sleep but was haunted by the image of that figure. The house seemed to creak more than usual, every sound amplifying my paranoia.



The next day, exhausted but resolute, I decided to open the attic door again. Maybe I had imagined it, I told myself. Maybe it was a trick of the light. I climbed the stairs, my heart pounding louder with each step.



The chair was empty.



I felt a mix of relief and dread. Had I really seen something the night before? I turned to leave, but as I did, I heard a whisper.



It was so faint, I thought I might be imagining it. But it grew louder, more insistent. It was coming from the keyhole.



My hands shook as I bent down again. This time, there was no figure, just darkness. But the whispering continued, incoherent at first, then clearer.



"Help me."



The voice was pleading, desperate. I stood frozen, unable to move. The whispering grew louder, more frantic. "Help me. Let me out."



I backed away, slamming the door shut. I raced down the stairs and out of the house, not stopping until I reached my car. I called my parents and told them everything. They were skeptical but agreed to meet me at the house.



When we arrived, the house was eerily quiet. My dad, ever the skeptic, marched up to the attic while my mom and I waited downstairs. Minutes felt like hours until he returned, looking pale and shaken.



"The chair," he said, "it’s gone."



We left the house that night and never looked back. My parents sold it within a month. The new owners tore it down, replacing it with a modern home.



I’ll never forget that whisper, though. Sometimes, late at night, I think I can still hear it, faint and desperate. "Help me. Let me out."
