&#x200B;

Alice stared for a moment, her mouth parted as if to say something, but no words came out, "Joel, I know you're upset about your friend and Ethan, but that's insane. Whatever that thing is is far beyond our understanding. How would you even attempt to *kill* it\*?\*"

"I told you Ethan had injured it, remember? If I can get close enough to it, I think I can finish it off."

"Well, if that's the plan, then there's no way I'll let you fight it alone. That's too dangerous; you'll get yourself killed."

Ethan's words about his dreams echoed in my head, but I ignored them.

"No, Alice, please. This isn't your fight."

"Yes, it is! It took just as much from me as it did from you."

"I know, but-"

"But what, Joel? What should I tell your group when I get up there? 'All of your friends are either dead or dying, and the only one who isn't just went to fight a demon? possibly the devil himself?'"

I hadn't seen Alice like this yet. Her expression looked desperate and upset, but it wasn't anger. It was fear. I could tell that she was so tired of losing. She noticed that I hadn't said something for a beat and jerked her gaze away, embarrassed by her outburst. I slowly stepped toward her.

"Alice, I… I don't know what happened to you during your time here… I don't know what you did to end up here either, but-" I thought for a moment, "I don't know what you think you still need to atone for, but you've paid for it all, Alice. Over a decade of your life has been spent trapped here, and this place is as close to hell as I can imagine. You've lost so much and sacrificed even more, and it's painful to see you continue to punish yourself for things you can't control."

Her gaze finally drew to mine as I continued.

"It is dangerous, and that's why I want you to go. You don't deserve any more pain. You deserve to make it out of here." I could tell by looking at her that she still wasn't convinced, "Please… In my entire life, I have never done anything good for anyone, Alice. All I do is hurt. So please, just let me do this one thing on my own. Let me try to do one last good thing in case I don't make it out of here."

There was more silence before she quietly spoke, "That day that I left you guys in that basement… A long time ago, I had a friend that I stabbed in the back to get something I wanted. It left them broken, and… Well, it ruined their life. From that day forward, I just always wanted to make up for it… no matter how much I gave up, though, it never healed. No amount of 'selflessness' ever made the pain go away. When I got here, I thought giving my life would be enough, but I should've known that was wishful thinking. The House wouldn't even let me die. Just watch everyone around me suffer that fate."

Her eyes held pain that danced as memories flickered through her mind. Finally, she lifted them from the ground to my face.

"But that day I ran off? That was the first time I hadn't even thought about it; atoning, I mean. I ran off because it felt like the right thing to do. And suddenly, it all made sense. It was like this weight was lifted, and I finally, for the first time in years, felt free. I was terrified as I ran, but I felt free. Because all those selfless acts before were just to make me feel better, whether I wanted to admit it or not. But not when I helped you two... For once, I helped because getting you back to your group was the right thing to do."

I stared at her, trying to understand what she was trying to tell me, but I never figured it out before she spoke again, "What's your plan, Joel?"

"I told you, I'm going to try to kill it. Once I do, I'll come back up for you and the others so we can get out of here."

"But you're not like Ethan was… What if you can't hurt it? That's why I need to stay, Joel. I can help."

"That's exactly why I need you to go, Alice. If I can't kill it and don't make it back, I'm going to need you to get my friends out safely. The House will know you're trying to leave with them, and it'll attempt to stop you. If it turns out that I can't hurt it even while it's injured, there'd be no way for me to protect the others. I need you to be there to get them out safely."

"You keep talking like this is a suicide mission, Joel."

"It's not. I swear. I'm just trying to be safe about this."

She studied me for a long time, running the numbers in her head. I could see that she really didn't like this plan, yet her empathy won out, "Okay. I'll go…."

"Thank you. Thank you so much."

"But you better make it back, okay?"

"I will. But if I don't, wait a day. If I'm still not back, get everyone out."

"How am I going to get up there anyway? The Curator is blocking the door, remember?"

"Don't worry about that. I'll draw it down here when you're heading back up. When you reach the door, knock three times, wait two seconds, then knock once. It's a secret code that only my group knows. It'll help them trust you."

She nodded, then sighed, "Alright, I guess I should get going."

"Good luck Alice."

She smiled, "Thanks, but you can keep it. I think you'll need it more." She looked down at the axe in her hands, then held it out, "This too. Just in case what you have isn't enough." I took the weapon, and without another word, she turned and headed down the hallway before looking back once and disappearing around the corner.

Just like that, I was alone again.

I set a timer on my watch for forty-five minutes while I let Alice get back to the lift. In the meantime, I tried to keep myself occupied and not think about what was to come. I stepped back into Bea's room and sat with her for a while, but she was still out of it the whole time. I gently brushed her hair with my hand and stared down at her.

"I love you too…." I told her. "And I'm so sorry. For the way I treated you. For everything…."

For the rest of my time, I sat in the theater hallway and just thought and prayed. There's a lot to think about when you might die. You wonder about all the things you could have done differently. You think about all the little details that you thought were so important but now are so trivial in the face of everything else. I thought about Rose, Andi, and Ethan and wondered if I would see them again, but I also thought of Him. When the others got out of here and I was confirmed dead in the real world, would they have a funeral? Would he come, or would he even care that I had died?

My watch beeping snapped me from my thoughts, and I stood to my feet. I looked down at my wrist to silence the small screeching machine, but it stopped on its own. I tried the light button to see what had happened, but it wasn't working. Stepping down the hall into the theaters glow, I laughed to myself as I looked at the blank digital display. After all these years, the little thing had finally given out on me.

I stepped into the lobby, then with shaky hands, cupped them to my mouth.

"Hey!" I screamed. "Is anyone there?!"

It was a gamble on who would show up first; the House or the Curator. If it was the latter, then great. That meant more help for me. If it was the former, however… Well, there never really is a good time to die, right?

*Tink TINK!*

I never thought I would feel relief upon hearing those notes. It was only surface-level, though. After all, the last time I had seen the creature, it was mad I had escaped. There was no telling how it would act.

I turned to the hall it had come from and called out, "Hey, over here!"

Its footsteps were soft and quiet, stalking slowly. It didn't make any other sound.

"It's okay," I gently spoke, "I'm not going to run or trick you. I just want to talk."

I saw its bald, skin-patched, skeletal head peer into the room at me from the dark theater entrance. A shiver ran through my spine, but I shook it off.

"Bad… pet…" It murmured as one colossal hand crept into the lobby.

I set the axe down and then held up my hands as I spoke again, "I know… I know, I was a very bad pet. You like good pets, don't you?"

It tilted its head to the side as if listening but continued moving forward toward me.

"Ethan was a good pet. But the House it… It killed him… You don't like the house, do you? He's mean to your pets." I said as if trying to coax a child.

The creature clacked its teeth together and looked at me before shaking its head. My heart pounded in my chest. I couldn't believe I was having a conversation with the feral beast that had haunted me for the last 4 and a half years.

"I don't like the house either. How about we help each other?" I said sweetly, "You helped Ethan and me last time, remember? If you do, I might be able to make the House go away. Then you'd have your pets all to yourself. Wouldn't that be nice?"

By now, the Curator was only ten feet away from me, and it stood on its hind legs as it stared down. I swallowed hard and hoped that it wasn't ready to pummel me into a stain on the carpet.

"F-Friend?" It squeaked as if trying to understand what I was saying.

"Mhmm. Like a friend."

It tilted its head to the other side and then clacked its teeth once again before saying, "Help, friend." And playing a small flurry of notes on its throat.

The creature and myself looked at each other for nearly a minute in stunned silence. I had absolutely no idea what to do next, and I was frankly shocked it had listened at all. The good news was that I now had the strength I needed to get the upper hand on the House. The bad news was that if we succeeded, I would have a whole new problem to worry about. The indifferent news was that if the next few hours were my last, either outcome would no longer be on me to sort out...

Worried I might lose the creature's focus, I forced out a, "Good. That's really good, f-friend. Now, let's go find that mean House."

Cautiously, I picked up the axe again and began to step around the Curator toward the door. As I did, it pivoted the whole time, following me with its unyielding eyes. I didn't dare to look away from it. When I was about halfway to the door, I felt a rumbling around us. The Curator must have felt it, too, as it nervously shifted its massive hands across the carpet to steady itself. The room was moving. In a panic, I changed directions, heading back toward Bea's hallway. The door was still open to my relief, and I could see the endless black void beyond. Hers hadn't moved. Instead, I turned back to my original destination to see that the lobby's glass doors now peered into a parking garage.

*The* parking garage.

Across the way, I could see my target standing in front of something on the ground. A figure covered by a sheet with a couple of fake house plants posted nearby. Ethan's body. I clenched my fist in anger. The House really did know how to get to me. It took the form of Him as it had for so much of my time knowing it, and as I stared, it glanced over its shoulder. I couldn't see its face from how far away I was, but I knew it was smiling.

I turned back to my new 'friend' who looked at me with a cocked head, "Well… I guess *it* found *us*."

The Curator did nothing but click its teeth and continue to stare at me. What had I gotten myself into?

Not beating around the bush, I placed my hand on the door's handle and pushed it open. The cavernous ambiance of the parking garage wrapped itself around me as I slowly stepped through, followed by the Curator, who crouched low to the ground like a cat prowling toward its prey. The House stared at me every step of the way, unblinking and still as a statue. Once I was about twenty feet away from it, I stopped, my heart nearly throbbing out of my chest. The same could be said for the house, too. The hole that Ethan had torn was still present, the dead heart within beating slowly. Painfully.

"Well, this is a surprise." The shapeshifter sneered. "I truly didn't expect to see you again, Joel. Tell me, how did you get out of your cell?"

Beside me, I heard a gurgle brew in the back of the Curator's throat, but I slowly raised a hand in an attempt to calm it. We couldn't just dive straight into things. I needed to have a clear opening before I went for the kill.

"It's okay," I told it. "Just wait a moment."

"And you brought the passenger, I see. What's the plan? Are you two going to rough me up again like last time? Is Ethan going to spring up from under that sheet and finish the job?" The being chuckled, looking down at the blanket covering the body on the ground. I felt sick as I looked at the blood-soaked tarp. "I wouldn't count on him if I were you. He hasn't been feeling well lately."

My blood boiled, "Yeah? You sound pretty confident for a creature that almost lost to a human and one of your own children."

That wiped the smile from his face, "How dare you insinuate that that parasite is one of my children." It snapped, glaring at the beast behind me. I was confused, but he didn't give me time to think about it more, "And you sound pretty confident for someone with no real leverage. Have you forgotten how this works, Joel? You're not like Ethan or your other friend, that Alice girl. You can't hurt me."

"Oh yeah? That heart of yours looks pretty soft. Why don't you come over here, and we can test that theory?" The hole that Ethan made would certainly be enough, but it was still small. I would have to get really close if I was going to pull this off.

"You're planning something." The being said plainly with a smirk. "I can hear you thinking about it. I can't quite tell what, but I know it's there."

'Don't think about it. Don't think about it.' I chanted over and over again in my mind.

"Think about what, Joel? How exactly do you plan to kill me? I hope you brought more than that toothpick in your hands."

"Maybe I won't." I blurted out, trying desperately to switch topics. "Ethan thought you would kill me in the end. He had a dream about it."

"Oh, really?" The House purred, clearly intrigued. It took a few steps toward me, then spoke again, "And what do you think of that?"

"I'm not sure yet. I guess we'll find out soon enough."

The house laughed with genuine amusement, "Joel, I must say, you have certainly been entertaining to witness. Time and time again, you act so sure of yourself, yet it never fails to blow up in your face."

As it spoke, it once again stepped closer.

"You do the same. You act like you're some god, yet you keep getting humbled by us. We found the exit. We wounded you physically. Heck, I was in your clutches, and you couldn't even keep me there."

It didn't like that response, "Maybe you did, Joel. That doesn't mean I can't put you back. Although, this time you'd be all alone. Trapped with no company. That would even be worse than before, wouldn't it?" my confidence wavered a bit, "At the end of the day, that's what scares you the most, isn't it? It's not losing people. It's not the idea that you're a bad person. Sure, those keep you awake at night, but it all boils down to one thing: you're scared of ending up alone, and you're scared that you'll cause it. That's why you fight to save your friends. That's why you don't want anyone to die on your watch. It's all rooted in that one selfish notion that you'll have them around to numb the pain."

I knew that now wasn't the time to let his words affect me, but he always knew exactly what to say to get under my skin. Maybe I was letting myself get distracted, but I had to ask, even if it yielded no answer. It was a question that had burned in my mind for a long time.

"What… are you?"

The House smiled, "Oh, Joel, you should know. You helped to raise me. To build me. You and everyone else. You humans are such complex things. You hurt each other and commit the most heinous acts, then try to dust it all away with false apologies and affirmations. But all of the darkest things? The sins that are too big to be swept under the rug with simple words? Those you lock away. You see, everyone is so content to acknowledge their guilt and try to move on from it, but no one is actually willing to confront it. Make amends for it. Instead, you bury it deep down in the void of your mind, contained in neat little rooms whose doors you never open. Meanwhile, inside, those memories are screaming out, begging to be released." The House began pacing toward me in an inhuman and jerky way as its form shifted between various faces, some I knew, some I didn't. "But you have to understand, Joel. When those screams echo out into the lowest parts of the void," Its eyes flicked to yellow as it stepped in front of me with a grin, "Something might hear them."

With the creature now so close and my confidence quickly dwindling, I lobbed the axe toward the hole in its chest. Expecting the attack, the being retracted into the floor as the Curator pounced forward, following my lead. We immediately went on alert, trying to figure out where he would emerge next. However, he never did. Instead, his voice filled the entire garage.

"It's a shame, Joel. Your agony tastes so delicious, but you've become too much of a nuisance to keep around. If I can't break you, I suppose there's only one other option. Let's make Ethan's dreams come true, shall we?"

The House went quiet as The curator and I continued to pivot, looking out for it to attack. I gripped the axe tightly, ready to strike where ever it appeared. I knew it would most likely have no effect, however. I saw the asphalt below me begin to buckle outward, and I raised the axe, but the bump sunk back in quickly, surprising me. I waited until I saw it again, although it was a few feet away this time. Then again and again. It took my eyes a second to register that it was happening all around us. The ground was rippling. I turned to the curator, who looked on edge as it shuffled around, staring at the floor.

Then all at once, chaos erupted.

Bodies. Forms of people made of asphalt stretched from the back tar below, all wailing and reaching out to grab us. Their torsos leaped forward as arms and hands writhed upward, clawing at my legs and grabbing hold of me. I swung the axe down on an arm that held my leg, surprised to see that it shattered away on impact. I swung again and again, doing my best to fight off the relentless horde, but there were too many. Meanwhile, they did the same to the curator, leaping on it and doing their best to drag it to the ground. However, they were no match for the colossal beast, who swatted them away like flies from a sandwich. Still, the numbers were beginning to overwhelm.

I wasn't fairing as well. No matter how many I destroyed, more took their place. Eventually, I was dragged to the floor and fell among the mob. They surrounded me with their petrified bodies and began pulling on me harder, this time into the concrete. I let out a cry of pain as I felt my bones try to forcefully pass through the solid ground to no avail. The Curator heard me and turned to see my predicament, then rushed forward, batting away my assailants and scooping me up with one giant hand. It held me suspended above the sea of tortured souls while fighting them off with its free fist; however, this restricted movement was a lot less effective.

I tried to assist by swinging my axe below, but the jerky movement of the beast that held me made it impossible to aim. I could tell the Curator was starting to gauge the futility of the situation as its head looked frantically around the room. Every inch of the asphalt was writhing with the mass of shadowy figures; there was nowhere safe. Nowhere except for…

The creature from downstairs bounded forward over the field of grabbing hands and threw me down on the roof of a nearby car before turning back to fight off the horde below. I got to my feet and looked around at the figures now desperately trying to scale the vehicle. Luckily, they couldn't get past their stomachs before an unseen force dragged them back under.

Suddenly, out of my peripheral, I saw a figure rise up higher than the rest, making it above the top of the car. I spun around and swung the axe, but I might as well have hit a brick wall. The house glared at me with Bea's smile.

"Hey, Joel." It taunted before lunging forward. It pinned me against the car's roof with its unfathomable strength, and I nearly dropped the axe from impact. It was certainly close enough now, but there was no way I could attack with my arms pinned the way they were. I was helpless.

"What? Did you think I hadn't learned from last time? That beast may be nothing but a parasitic savage, but I'll give it one thing: it sure puts up a fight." I struggled, but he only pressed against me harder. "What do you think of my team? Quite a lot of them, huh? Take a good look, Joel. Every single figure you see used to be like you. Full of hope. Eager for an escape. Yet when it came down to it, they just weren't strong enough to make it through. You'll join them soon enough."

Around me, the cries of the grasping souls suddenly made morbid sense. They were screams of pain and agony, sadness and despair. The noise of voices who had come so far only to meet an eternal end right at the last second.

"Was it all worth it, Joel? All that time spent traveling, all that pain and loss. Knowing now that it was all in vain? Nobody gets out of here. Nobody leaves. This is how every one of your journeys has ended, and this is how every journey will end."

I wriggled my head back and looked at the Curator. I could tell it was quickly growing tired and being overrun, its skin being torn from its skeleton.

"Help!" I called to it. The monster perked up and tried to charge back over, but it was quickly pulled to the ground before it could get far. Thankfully though, its arms were very long.

It swung its goliath limb toward the House, catching its shoulder and knocking one of my arms free. I quickly reached up and plunged my hand into its chest, grabbing hold of the being's undead heart. I squeezed with all my might, and the thing screamed in pure agony as it recoiled off of me, its body rippling through several forms. Confidence flooded me as my suspicions were confirmed. Its body was just a shell. That part of it I could hurt. My hand was almost caught in the hole as I tried to pull it out from the creature's spasms, but I managed to break it loose. Then, with all my might, I grabbed the axe, raised it high, and brought it down hard into the House's chest.

The House looked up at me, pure shock in its expression. Its eyes flickered to their true yellow form, and soon after, its moldy body followed suit. It jerked away from me, taking the axe with it as it clawed at the handle, trying to pull it loose. I couldn't believe it. I had done it.

The joy of that thought lasted only a few seconds.

The House pried the weapon loose and peered down at the hole. The Axe hadn't made it all the way through. It had gotten caught right on the edge. He looked at me, this time with no smugness, no pride. Just pure rage. Without even trying, it snapped the tool into dozens of pieces, keeping only the sharp part in its hand.

How could I have been so dumb? Why didn't I stick to the plan? Why hadn't I used the--

Before I could think anything else, it lunged forward, fast as light, and jammed the axe head deep into my chest. So deep that every bit of it disappeared somewhere beneath the pool of blood that erupted from the wound. I could feel every bit of tissue tear as it cracked through my rib cage and sliced through my heart. Ceaseless pain shot fire through every nerve as my body clocked into panic mode, trying to understand the sensation it was feeling. Confusion was all I felt. I couldn't scream. I couldn't cry. I could barely think. All I could do was force my head up and stare at the mess on my torso. It looked so absolute. So final. 'How do you bandage a wound like this?' I struggled to wonder.

"Was that what you were going for, Joel?" the house hissed as it leaned in close to my face, lapping up every bit of my hopeless expression.

As blood began to flood the places inside me it didn't belong, the pain began to subside. Maybe I had just gone numb. I didn't know. I didn't need to worry about that. I didn't need to worry about anything anymore. My last thought, before I had none at all, was that Grace had been right. Once you got past the pain and fear, death really was peaceful.

My vision went black, and I reveled in the small relief of knowing that all my struggling was finally over, but then, something strange happened...

Darkness. A pitch-black void engulfed every sense, like sleep. We sleep every night, yet we never honestly know what the process feels like. We experience the before and the after but never the in-between. One second our eyes are closed, the next, they're open, and it's a different time of day. Sometimes a dream fills the empty space, but sometimes it doesn't. On those nights, it's just darkness. I learned what that in-between space felt like as the last breath of air slipped past my lips, and I gave up my life. It was all I felt.

But then it suddenly wasn't. I was still in blackness, but now I could feel something. An aura around me, a sense of self. I wasn't nowhere; I was... *somewhere*. I no longer had the sensation of a body, but I focused the tangled string of thoughts that made up my drifting consciousness to remember what it felt like. To have form. To feel. My hands tensed at my sides to grab ahold of something silky and soft, a stark contrast to the cold car roof I had just died on. I felt it not just in my hands but my back too; I was still laying down.

The simple realization caused my consciousness to rush into one point so violently that I jolted straight up with a gasp, my functions returning to me. I had no idea what I expected to first see in the afterlife, but a familiar soft yellow was not it.

The room I was in was undoubtedly the yellow room, but it couldn't have possibly been the same house. It was clean, with no water stains or dust in sight. As I inhaled, for the first time in four years, I smelled no trace of mildew. The room around me was decorated, with pictures adorning the old yellow walls and dressers furnishing the corners. Real, living house plants sat perched on shelves, and below me, a warm, cozy, not damp bed held my newly realized form. My clothes were no longer torn, stained, and tattered, and I had no more bandages covering wounds on my skin. My fingers instinctively wandered up to trace the spot on my chest where I had seen an axe head disappear moments ago. There wasn't even a mark.

I looked behind me out of the clean, clear window to see that it was night outside, unobscured by an endless blanket of clouds that once was. The disturbingly perfect round hills that I was used to seeing had been smoothed out into natural rolling plains of golden wheat that swayed gently beneath an early breeze. Mountains even further hid a crowning, golden sky as the sun began to rise somewhere behind them. The sight beckoned me forward with a warmth in my chest unlike anything I had ever seen, and I wanted nothing more than to answer it.

I stood.

As I went for the door to the kitchen, I stopped, turning around out of morbid curiosity. The entrance to the basement stood waiting for me. The door where the thing from downstairs lived. The door that contained the true horrors of the house. Slowly I stepped toward it and turned the handle. Only a closet full of spare blankets and pillows greeted me.

As I stepped into the kitchen, I found that it too was decorated like the yellow room. The whole house was. Warm colors and pleasant decorations blanketed the area, and though I had spent so many miserable years in the layout of these same rooms, in that moment, all I could feel was comfort. Security. It wasn't the same place I had come from; it had to be somewhere far, far apart.

As I passed the elegant dining room down the hall to the bedroom, I spotted something through the living room doorway. A figure sitting on a bench in the sunroom, gazing off into the horizon. I felt no fear as I called out.

"Hello?"

The figure turned their head slightly, and I suddenly felt numb as they spoke, "Oh, hey. You're finally awake."

I forced one foot slowly in front of the other as I stepped closer. The feeling of shocked joy made it hard to speak again, "E-Ethan?"

I heard him laugh softly before calling out, "Yeah, man. It's me. You want to come talk for a bit?"

I listened to his request, shock still causing me to move slower than I meant to. When I rounded the corner, He turned to me and stood with a smile. "Hey, Joel."

I threw my arms around him like a bear as tears of joy began to leak from my eyes. I had never been happier to see someone again in my life.

"It's good to see you too." he chuckled

"Ethan, I- I didn't think I'd… I'm so sorry." I stuttered, barely able to think of a response.

He pulled away, and sat back down onto the bench, "Have a seat, man. We finally have some furniture around here, we may as well use it."

I chuckled as I wiped the tears from my eyes and sat. "What's going on? What is this place?"

"We're waiting to see if the sun comes up."

"Why? Does it... not... usually... come up?"

I saw him purse his lips, but he remained looking out the window, "Apparently, sometimes it doesn't. If it does, it means we can head out, though. Across the fields."

"What's out there?"

"I'll tell you if the sun comes up."

"Can we not go now?"

"We probably could, but I've heard its easy to get lost out there at night. Besides, it's more pretty in the day."

"You've already seen it come up?"

He turned to me with a smile, "Oh man, Joel, just wait till you see it. The sunrises on earth were beautiful but this is just something else."

I smirked, "I guess dying made you more cryptic, huh?"

"Well, there's some things you just won't understand until you see the sun come up for yourself."

"Why haven't you gone out already?"

"I wanted to wait for you. I figured we could go together."

I didn't understand what he meant by anything he was saying, but the statement still made me smile, "Thanks, buddy." We sat in silence for a beat before I spoke again, "I guess you were right."

"Right about what?"

"Your dream. The House really did get me in the end."

Ethan shifted his glance away from me and nodded, then spoke, "Hey now, I wouldn't count yourself out just yet. There's still time before sunrise. Who knows what could happen?"

"What, are you saying I might not be dead?"

"Maybe not yet."

"I don't know, man. It sunk an axe right through my heart. I don't think I'm getting back up from that."

"Was it the same axe that I almost killed it with?"

"Yeah."

"Dang. That's kind of ironic, isn't it?"

"Yeah, it is, isn't it?"

We both laughed, and after it faded, I spoke again, this time more sorrowfully, "I'm sorry, man. About everything."

"Joel, Don't. you don't need to apologize for anything."

"Yes I do. I wasn't a good friend to you Ethan. And you certainly didn't deserve to die trying to save me."

"It was my choice. And besides, I would have died somewhere down the line anyways. Better to go out as a hero, right?" He smirked.

I snickered but quickly fell back into my serious tone. I was dodging around my biggest fault. "Bea, too," I said. He perked up at that. "I'm sorry about Bea. I knew you liked her, and I could tell it hurt you that I… you know. That was selfish of me to do. Really selfish…"

"It's okay, man. I know you had stuff you were trying to figure out. We've all done stupid things. None of that matters anymore. And besides, at the end of the day, its up to Bea who she has feelings for."

"I should have changed them back then, though. Now all of that is just, unresolved, you know?"

Ethan nodded but said nothing. I could tell he was thinking of a response. "You remember when I told you and Alice I bullied a kid back in school? When you guys were trying to tell me I didn't belong in the house?"

"Yeah?"

"That same kid ended up killing himself."

"Oh my God…"

"Yeah, I know. That's awful right? And when I heard, I felt sick for months. I barely ate, I hardly went out, I just isolated myself from things for a while. But once I began to get over it, you know what I did?"

"What?"

"I just rejoined my friends and we found somebody new to pick on. Because while I felt awful that I had ruined someone's life with torment, it felt worse that I might be on the other end of that. Alone with no friends. So I stayed where I knew I wouldn't fall to that level. Tried to ignore what had happened last time and call it an unfortunate circumstance. But the problem is that you can't hide from that stuff. It becomes a part of you, and you're going to drag it around whether you like it or not."

"What happened after that?"

"I kept being a jerk for a long time, tagging along like a henchman in this group of… just awful people. But I started to realize that I hated it. I always had. Looking back, whenever we'd walk away from leaving someone hurt or abused, I always felt guilty. I knew it made me a bad person, but I thought that by acknowledging that, I was somehow better for it. That it made me exempt from the pain I was inflicting on others. It wasn't until one day that we made this one guy cry that I broke. Watching a fully grown person break down like that… all I could think about was the classmate who killed himself. How truly sad he must have been. How desperate I had made him. Telling myself that I knew I was a bad person only stopped me from changing. If that's all you admit, then you feel like you don't have any work to do. 'I'm bad; that's why I do these things.' There has to be an 'and' there. I'm a bad person, and I need to change."

"So, what did you do?"

"I changed. I cut off my 'friends'. Started standing up for people, even if it meant I got put down sometimes. I went back and apologized to all the people I had hurt. Some forgave me, some didn't, but that was okay. I didn't deserve forgiveness after what I had done, but they still deserved an apology."

"Did it make the guilt go away?"

"No. Heck no. I still look back on what happened to that classmate and want to throw up, but it helped me to stop running from it. To stop fearing it. I knew that I would never make a mistake like that again, and it was the most liberating feeling of my life. If we always run from the worst parts of ourselves, the second we slow down to catch our breath, it'll come slamming right back into us."

I looked away from Ethan to the floor and took a deep breath, not sure of what to say. Tears formed in my eyes as only one sentence came to mind.

"Don't feel guilty."

"hm?"

"Don't feel guilty. That's the last thing Andi said to me." I lifted my head and laughed softly, "Ethan, that's the key to the house. She wasn't just telling me that because she knew I'd blame myself for her death. She was telling me because she had figured it out. The house can't get to you if you have nothing it can use."

"Huh. Well, I'll be…"

"Would have been nice to know when we were alive, huh?"

"Yeah." Ethan chuckled, "It would've."

He put an arm on my shoulder as we sat waiting for a bit longer. The golden glow from the sun beyond the mountains didn't seem to be moving at all, and I was beginning to wonder how long it would take.

"So this place… It looks like the house?"

Ethan nodded, "I think the house we know was never meant to be that way. I think it might have been like this at one point. Then that creature showed up and must have done something."

"So, what is it? This place, I mean."

"I can't say I fully even know. Some sort of crossroads, I guess."

I was about to see if he would elaborate on that when the sky began to grow darker. I looked to the window to see that the golden light behind the mountains was beginning to fade. I was worried for a moment until Ethan spoke.

"Huh." He said plainly, "I guess it's not today."

"What? What do you mean?"

He turned to me and smiled, "You got some time before your sun comes up, Joel."

"Are you saying I'm not dead yet? How?"

He shrugged, "Who's to say?"

"So, what do I do?"

As I asked the question, I noticed a new glow filling the room, this one much more faint and coming from behind. I looked around the corner of the living room to see that the door in the back of the bedroom had light bursting from its seams. A warm, green light. An exit.

I turned back to Ethan.

"You should get going. I'm sure you have a lot to get back to." He said with watery eyes and a smile.

"What about you?" I said, tearing up myself. "Are you going to have to have to walk alone now?"

"It's alright. I have a lot to reflect on. Plus, I won't have you bombarding me with questions the whole way."

I laughed, but it was short-lived, "So this is it then?"

"I'm afraid so. Don't worry, though; I'll see you again, Joel. Someday."

We embraced one last time.

"Thank you, Ethan. For everything."

"I love you, Joel."

"I love you too, Ethan."

We pulled away and looked at each other for a moment before wiping our eyes. Ethan smiled and retook a seat on the bench, and I smiled and rounded the corner into the living room. Each step I took felt hard, not wanting to leave my friend or the calling of the fields. As I entered the bedroom, the warm green glow produced a new pull, however. A more powerful one. The will to live. I stepped forward and took the handle. With a twist and a pull, the green light flooded the room, overwhelming every sense. I closed my eyes, but the light was so blinding that I could still see it through my eyelids. The warmth of it burned at my skin until it was numb, and before long, I was once again a string of thoughts floating in a vast void of nothing. That was until-

*"SCREEEEE!"*

The sharp shriek caused me to jolt back to consciousness. The warmth of the light was replaced by the feeling of the cold car hood behind me. I took a second to get reacquainted with the aching flesh that was my body.

"you've got to be kidding me." I sighed, slightly upset that everything was now again my problem.

I choked the selfish thought back with thoughts of Bea and the others, then slowly lifted my hand to my blood-soaked torso. While a crimson muck still covered my chest, there was no injury besides the hole left in my shirt. My chest tingled at the thought of the gaping pit that had once been, causing me to cough violently. How was that possible?

Another shriek reminded me that I was not currently safe. How much time had passed? I sat up slowly, my head still spinning from death. The answer must have been not much at all. Before me, the shadowy figures in the asphalt assaulted and grappled the Curator while the house loomed over it in its true form, violently clawing the beast. The Curator was doing its best to fight its enemies off, but it was quickly failing. It was *my* turn to help it.

I checked my belt to ensure I still had my plan tucked in it before shakily standing to my feet. Around the car, figures still writhed and wailed at me, hoping to pull me down to their level.

"H-Hey…" I weakly muttered. The house couldn't hear me over the sound of the chaos, so I tried again.

"Hey!"

I saw it land one last hit into the Curator before it turned its amber eyes on me. It had no true face, no real expression, and yet still, for the first time since I had known the creature, it looked confused. For once, it looked like this was out of its control.

"I'm not done yet," I said through gritted teeth.
