As we unpacked the vehicle and settled in, I couldn’t shake the gnawing sense of despair that had taken root in my chest. No matter how far we ran, no matter how well we hid, the truth was we were trapped.

That first day, we worked in silence. Emma was the one who took charge. She used this beat-up toolkit we’d found earlier to nail planks across the windows while I went out and gathered stones to block the door. Not exactly Fort Knox, but enough to make us feel a little safer.

By the second day, the cabin started to feel… like a place where we could maybe survive. I found this old, ratty blanket in a closet and threw it over the mattress to make it less disgusting. Emma rigged up a clothesline near the stove to dry our wet gear. We even found a little transistor radio on a shelf. It didn’t pick up anything but static, but I kept it on anyway. That faint buzz was better than the silence.

On the third day I woke up earlier, to check the area for firewood, making sure there weren’t any infected or other survivors snooping around. Emma stayed back and organized our supplies. She was good at it, too. I watched her stack cans, arrange medical kits, make everything fit perfectly into this tiny corner of the cabin. I didn’t say it out loud, but it was comforting. Like, as long as she was here, there was some order to things.

But nights were the hardest. I’d lie there on that damp, uncomfortable mattress, staring at the ceiling, and my mind would just… unravel. I’d think about everything I’d lost. And then, inevitably, I’d think about Emma. Her laugh. Her determination. Her optimism. It should’ve made me feel better, but instead, it felt like a weight pressing down on my chest. I didn’t know why. Maybe I envied her, or maybe I just didn’t trust it.

Then came the fourth day. That was the day everything changed.

We were out gathering firewood when Emma spotted it, an old truck, half-hidden under a mess of overgrown bushes. The paint was peeling, and it looked like it hadn’t been touched in a while. Emma practically bolted toward it, her face lighting up like a kid on Christmas morning. I hung back, scanning the area for any signs of danger. Old habits die hard.

When she pried open the back doors, I’ll never forget the sound she made, a little gasp, half disbelief, half joy. Inside, there were crates of canned food, bottled water, duct tape, medical supplies, even a couple of weapons. There were blankets and clothes, too, and this dusty carton of instant coffee that made Emma laugh out loud. It was the first time I’d seen her smile like that in days.

“Can you believe this?” she said, her voice breathless as she rummaged through the supplies. “It’s like we hit the jackpot.”

I let myself smile, just a little. For the first time in a long time, I felt normal. We spent the rest of the afternoon unloading the truck and hauling everything back to the cabin. It took hours, but it didn’t matter. We had supplies to last us weeks, maybe even months. We had a roof over our heads. We were far away from the infected. And for once, I wasn’t completely alone.

By the time we got everything inside, the sun was setting, and the sky was this incredible mix of orange and pink. Emma was humming some tune I didn’t recognize as she stacked cans in neat little rows. I leaned against the wall and just watched her. She seemed so… happy. So at ease. It was contagious.

“Everything’s gonna be okay,” she said, catching my eye. “We’ve got this, Liam.”

I nodded, but I couldn’t shake this feeling in my gut. I wanted to believe her, I really did. But something inside me was screaming that it wasn’t that simple. It’s never that simple.

That night, we ate instant soup by the stove and sipped on the first hot coffee I’d had in months. For a little while, it felt like we weren’t just surviving we were living. Once I laid down on that mattress later that night, all those dark thoughts... didn't come back, and I could finally sleep peacefully.

The fifth day began like most of the others. Emma and I spent the morning sorting through our supplies, a routine that had become strangely comforting. She was always meticulous, labeling cans and organizing the first-aid kit while I busied myself reinforcing the barricades. The cabin felt more secure than ever, but the sense of unease lingered. I told myself it was just the world we lived in now, but deep down, I knew it was more than that.

But that fleeting moment of peace didn’t last. That evening, as we sat by the stove, I noticed something off. My phone, which had been buzzing intermittently with weak signals, was completely silent. No notifications. No messages. Nothing.

“The signal’s gone,” I muttered, holding up the device.

Emma glanced over, her expression unreadable. “Figures. Nothing lasts forever, right?”

She was trying to play it cool, but I could tell she was disappointed. The signal had been a lifeline, a reminder that we weren’t completely cut off from the world. But I’d been through this before. Ever since the outbreak started, things had a way of disappearing just when you got used to them.

“We’ll manage,” I said, more for her sake than mine.

That night, I fell asleep to the sound of the wind rattling the cabin walls. The fire in the stove crackled softly, casting dancing shadows across the room. For the first time in a while, I felt almost… content. But that feeling didn’t last.

I woke to the sound of something clattering to the floor. My heart jumped into my throat as I sat up, scanning the dimly lit room. My vehicle keys glinted on the floor near the door. That’s when I saw her.

Emma was standing by the door, a bag slung over her shoulder and a rifle in her hand. My blood ran cold as the realization hit me: she was trying to leave. No, she wasn’t just leaving, she was taking the supplies, the vehicle, everything Martin and I had fought for.

“Emma?” I said, my voice hoarse.

She froze, turning to face me. Her eyes were wide, her face pale. “Liam, I… it’s not what it looks like.”

“Really?” I stood, my legs shaky. “Because it looks like you’re trying to steal everything and leave me here to die.”

“It’s not like that,” she insisted, her voice trembling. “I was… I was going to come back. I swear.”

“Come back? You expect me to believe that? After everything we’ve been through?” I said harshly.

She didn’t answer. Instead, she turned and yanked the door open. The cold night air rushed in as she stepped outside, but I wasn’t going to let her go that easily. I lunged forward, grabbing her arm and pulling her back into the cabin. The bag fell to the floor, supplies spilling out across the room.

“Let me go!” she shouted, struggling against me.

“You’re not leaving!” I yelled, my grip tightening.

The fight was chaotic. She shoved me into the wall, and I stumbled, knocking over a chair. I grabbed her again, this time pinning her against the table. Her eyes were wild, filled with a mix of fear and determination. She reached for the rifle slung over her shoulder, but I was faster. I grabbed it, pointing it at her before she could react.

“Liam,” she said, her voice shaking. “Please, put the gun down. We can talk about this.”

I stared at her, my hands trembling. My mind was a whirlwind of emotions: anger, betrayal, fear. But above all, one thought echoed louder than the rest: I had to survive. At any cost.

“I trusted you,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “And this is what you do?”

“I… I was scared,” she said, tears streaming down her face. “I thought if I could get away, I—”

“Save it,” I snapped, cutting her off.

She took a step toward me, her hands raised in a placating gesture. “Liam, you don’t have to do this. Please.”

But I knew how this ended. I’d seen enough movies, read enough stories. The people who gave second chances always paid for it in the end. I couldn’t afford that. Not now. Not ever.

My finger tightened on the trigger. She saw it in my eyes, the moment I made my decision.

“Liam, don’t—”

The gunshot echoed through the cabin, deafening in the confined space. Emma crumpled to the floor, her eyes wide with shock. The realization of what I’d done hit me like a freight train. I staggered back, dropping the rifle as bile rose in my throat. My knees buckled, and I sank to the floor, staring at her lifeless body.

I killed her.

I killed a person before I ever killed an infected.

The weight of it was suffocating. I crawled to the corner of the room, my head in my hands as I tried to process what I’d just done. Emma’s blood pooled on the floor, stark against the wooden boards.

“I… I’m sorry,” I whispered, though there was no one left to hear it.

The cabin felt colder than ever. The silence was deafening, broken only by my ragged breaths. I had survived. But at what cost?

Four days. It had been four days since Emma’s body lay motionless on the cabin floor, and I still hadn’t buried her. Every time I thought about digging a hole, I froze. It wasn’t guilt, not entirely. It was fear. Fear that the sound of the shovel hitting the dirt would echo too loudly in the stillness. Fear that some infected or worse, some person, would hear and come for me. So I left her there, in the cabin we’d called home for those fleeting days of false hope. I took everything, the supplies, the weapons, the vehicle keys and ran.

I didn’t look back. I couldn’t. The cabin was a chapter I had to close, just like everything else.

The road stretched out before me like a scar on the earth, winding through forests and fields, each mile pulling me further from the cabin and deeper into isolation. The supplies Emma and I had gathered felt heavier than they should have, like they carried the weight of what I’d done. The vehicle was my lifeline now, a metal cocoon that shielded me from the horrors of the world outside. I drove aimlessly, the hum of the engine my only companion, until the fuel gauge dipped low enough to make me nervous.

I couldn’t stay on the move forever. I needed a place to settle, at least for a while. Somewhere safe, somewhere quiet. The infected weren’t the only danger, humans were just as unpredictable, and I couldn’t afford another confrontation. Not after Emma.

Eventually, I found it. A house, tucked away at the end of a long dirt road, surrounded by overgrown bushes and tall trees. It looked abandoned, the windows dark and the paint peeling from the walls. But I couldn’t take any chances.

and even how his hair was styled were

The first rule of survival is to never assume. Just because a place looks empty doesn’t mean it is. I parked the vehicle a good distance away and approached on foot, keeping low and quiet. The door was locked, but the windows weren’t. I slipped inside, weapon in hand, and began to clear the house room by room.

The living room was empty, there was a couch covered in dust and a coffee table stacked with old magazines. The kitchen was the same, dishes still in the sink, cupboards hanging open, but no signs of life. I moved through the hallways, checking every closet and corner. Every creak of the floorboards made my heart race, but I pressed on.

The final room was upstairs, at the end of the hall. The door was closed, and something about it made my stomach churn. I tightened my grip on the weapon and pushed it open, bracing myself for whatever I might find.

The smell hit me first, the sickly, unmistakable stench of decay. Then I saw him. A man, slumped against the far wall, a pistol still clutched in his skeletal hand. The bloodstain on the wall behind him told me everything I needed to know. Suicide. He’d probably been dead for weeks, maybe months. Long enough for the body to decompose but not long enough for the sight of him to lose its impact.

He was about my age. That’s what struck me the hardest. His clothes, his build, even the way his hair was styled, it was like looking at a warped reflection of myself. I stared at him for what felt like an eternity, unable to move. This was where the road ended for people like us, wasn’t it? Alone in some forgotten corner of the world, with nothing but a gun and the echoes of our own thoughts for company.

I wanted to look away, but I couldn’t. Not until I noticed the laptop sitting on the desk beside him. Unlike the rest of the room, it was clean, untouched by dust. And the light on its side was blinking, it had power. And there was a signal, somehow, even though my phone hadn’t picked up any.

I didn’t touch the body. I couldn’t bring myself to. Instead, I grabbed the laptop and carried it downstairs. The house was empty now, and it would do for shelter. I barricaded the doors and windows as best as I could and set up camp in the living room. The supplies I’d taken from the cabin filled the cupboards.

But the laptop called to me. It sat on the coffee table, its screen glowing faintly in the dim light. I powered it on and waited as it booted up. The connection was weak but functional.

What I found was a blank text document, left open on the screen. A cursor blinking expectantly, like it was waiting for me to write. But I had nothing else to do. Nothing left but to write.

So I did. I started typing. To whom? I had no idea. Maybe my story can help someone out there, help them learn from my mistakes, or maybe just offer me the hope of connecting with someone, even if it's from a distance, without the risk of betrayal or loss.

So if you’re reading this... maybe you’re out there, somewhere, fighting your own battles. Maybe you’re surviving too, against all odds. Here’s the only advice I can offer:

**Survive. No matter the cost. No matter what it takes.**
