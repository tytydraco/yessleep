I woke in the middle of the night. It wasn’t the kind of waking that drags you from a dream—no grogginess, no confusion—just awake, like my body knew something I didn’t yet. My heart thudded quietly in my chest. The room was still, too still, as if the air itself had stopped moving.

The clock on the nightstand read 3:12 a.m.. I stared at the ceiling, listening. Waiting.

A sound. Faint. From beneath the bed.

I held my breath. It came again. Scrape. Slow, deliberate. Something dragging along the floorboards beneath me.

I stayed perfectly still, staring up at the ceiling. Every nerve in my body screamed for me to move—to get up, turn on the light, do anything but stay there listening. But I couldn’t. Something about that sound pinned me in place.

Scrape.

It wasn’t random. It came in intervals, too steady to be the house settling, too deliberate to be the wind sneaking in under the windowsill. Something was down there.

I shut my eyes, hoping if I ignored it, it would stop. It didn’t.

The mattress shifted beneath me, ever so slightly. A faint pressure from underneath, pressing against the fabric as though testing the weight above. I froze, heart hammering in my chest.

The room around me seemed to pull tight, shrinking, bending inward. The air grew thick, pressing down like a hand over my mouth, smothering the space between each breath. I could hear it now—the thing under the bed moving, shifting closer to the edge, like it was working itself loose from a place it didn’t belong.

The ceiling blurred as my eyes began to water. Don’t move. Don’t look. If I just stayed still, maybe it would crawl back into whatever hole it came from.

Then I heard the first limb slide out.


---

It didn’t make sense. I saw it flicker just out of the corner of my eye—something long and thin, a pale shape dragging itself over the floorboards with no sound but for the scrape of movement.

I kept my head still, but my eyes tracked it from the edge of my vision. The limb wasn’t... right. It didn’t bend the way it should. It folded and curled, twisting over itself at odd angles, like a marionette being pulled by clumsy, invisible strings.

Something else followed—another limb, longer, thinner, gliding out from the dark beneath the bed. I could only make out pieces of it—curves that didn’t stay curved, edges that flickered, twisting in and out of focus.

The room tilted, as if the walls were being pulled inward, warping the space around whatever was coming out. The air grew colder.

The mattress lifted, just slightly.


---

I tried to move. I couldn’t. My arms, my legs—they felt heavy, as if the weight of the thing beneath me had already begun to drag me under. I felt something cold brush against the edge of my foot—a whisper of movement, soft as a breath, curling up from beneath the bed.

I shut my eyes, tight.

Scrape.

I opened them again.

The thing was still moving, unfolding into the room in pieces. Limbs twisted like rope, bending at joints that never formed, wrapping around the legs of the nightstand, curling toward the walls. More followed—tangled shapes without purpose, without symmetry, spilling into every corner of the room.

The walls groaned as the space seemed to stretch and fold inward, the ceiling sinking closer to my face. Time felt wrong, each second dragging too slow, as if the thing’s presence made even the idea of forward motion collapse.


---

It crawled closer to the edge of the bed. I saw the limb unfurl, a thin, jagged shape pressing itself against the floor. The tip brushed the nightstand and the clock blinked out, the numbers flickering once before disappearing completely.

And then—the limb reached for me.

It touched my wrist.


---

The moment it made contact, something inside me snapped, like a thread pulled too tight. My thoughts stuttered, folding over themselves in fragments. Memories twisted, scenes playing backward, details flickering and blurring. My name—I could feel it slip loose, like a word on the tip of my tongue that I’d never catch again.

The touch spread, curling up through my arm, into my chest, undoing me as it moved. I could feel pieces of myself unraveling, sliding away into a place I couldn’t follow.

I blinked once and found myself staring at something else entirely—an edge that wasn’t real, a corner that folded inward, spiraling into nothing. And from that nothing, more limbs began to creep.

They weren’t crawling toward me. I knew that now. They were pulling me toward them.


---

The room buckled again, the walls caving in as more pieces of the thing emerged from beneath the bed. Each movement shifted the space around it, as if reality was peeling back, letting something older and colder seep in. I could feel it pressing down on me—a presence that didn’t belong, curling into every corner of my mind.

I tried to scream, but the air was too thick. My voice slipped away, falling into the same place my thoughts had gone.

Another limb brushed against my face. It felt like static—cold and sharp, unraveling everything it touched.


---

The mattress lifted again, higher this time. I felt myself sink into the space beneath, as if the floor had softened, become something deeper, something with no bottom.

I could see them now—pieces of the thing that weren’t limbs at all. Shadows that curved where they shouldn’t, faces that flickered in and out of shape, mouths that whispered without sound.

They twisted closer, weaving themselves into the room, crawling through the cracks in the walls, slipping between the folds of time. And all I could do was watch as they unmade everything they touched.


---

The bed sank, and I sank with it. The room dissolved—walls flickering out, light twisting in on itself, folding into nothing. I felt myself go with it.

And just before the last piece of me slipped away, I saw them—all of them, crawling back beneath the bed.


---

I blinked.

The room was still. The mattress was cold beneath me. The clock blinked 3:13 a.m.

I lay there, staring at the ceiling, waiting.

I know they’re still there.

And one night, they’ll take the rest of me.
