I have been a huge fan of urban legends ever since I stumbled upon a forum about them maybe 15 years ago when I turned 10. 

Now this was a long time ago, back when I didn't even know that such a thing like that existed as my parents were still very clueless about the internet and people can talk about whatever they like on the internet. 

I was hooked on the stories of strange creatures appearing in different places, most of which take place in well known cities like Austin or Brooklyn.

One day, in 2011, I was playing a game with my best friend, Eric, when someone on the urban legends forum sent a strange video claiming that it came from a VHS tape that they found at a swap meet. 

I remember the video looked a little fuzzy but also in good quality, and the audio was... clear as if it was never played before. 

There was a date on the bottom corner of the video which says "Dec 18 1985" and that led me to wonder, "Man, whatever happened that day must've been an unforgettable event for whoever made this video". 

The video started off with two guys who looked 15 mentioning that some people heard strange noises coming from an abandoned building, and they were going to check out what was in that place and what was making that noise. 

The video then showed what seemed to be an abandoned laboratory, located in the middle of a desert but once the teens approach the building, the video ended. 

The person who posted the video later explained that shortly after the video was filmed, the two teens were reported missing and to this day they were never found. 

I asked which city was the video filmed in and surprisingly, they responded to me saying that it was filmed in my hometown which I'll redact for my own privacy. 

That's when I had an idea, one I would eventually regret having. 

I asked Eric if he wanted to go to an abandoned building and he said "yeah sure, I've always seen them in movies but never got to go there". 

We planned to go to the abandoned laboratory during our 2 week break from school just to see what was in there and once we started our break, that's when our journey started. 

We arrived to lab at around 8:00 pm, I was a little excited but Eric on the other hand, had some second thoughts about my plan.

 "I think we should go back!" Eric told me, "What if we get in trouble?" I later explained to him that we're not gonna get caught by police since the building looked long abandoned and that there were no signs warning us about trespassing so we should be OK. 

The front door was locked but luckily, there was a key buried underneath the ground and we managed to get in. 

There was no power so we used our flashlights to look around the place. 

As we looked at the things that were left behind, we heard what sounded like a Goat. 

Eric turned to look at me and suggested that we leave but I wanted to know where that sound was coming from. 

It was coming from one of the rooms in the lab, specifically the testing room. We walked over to the room and that's when the noise stopped.

Eric felt something breathing at his neck.

I turned around.

And that's when I saw a tall, buff man with a goat's head and legs standing right behind him. 

I tried to warn Eric but before I could do that, the thing grabbed him right by the neck and carried him off into darkness. 

I chased after him, knowing that the worst could happen to my friend if I didn't stop that thing. 

The thing threw him on the ground, and opened its huge mouth revealing its razor sharp teeth. 

I grabbed a broken piece of glass, and stabbed the thing on its back, giving Eric time to escape and we ran out of the lab screaming until we spotted a police cruiser passing by. 

We told the cops about the abandoned lab and what we saw in there but when they started to investigate, the creature was gone. 

10 years had passed, Eric moved to a different state, and I am now working at my local newspaper company as a cartoonist. 

When I told one of my co-workers about that time I encountered a strange creature, she told me that the creature I encountered was the result of a failed experiment that occurred in 1947 and was a mutation of a Goat and a man from Scotland who goes by the name of Shawn McLackey, a criminal who would eat the flesh of adolescents.

It's been 12 years since I saw the goat-man hybrid and I'm worried that if I ever go back to that place (if it's still there) I'll become its next victim.
