Have you ever been in love before? I'm not talking about the run-of-the-mill puppy dog love. I'm talking about the all-encompassing, down-to-your-bones love. Forgive me if I sound like a teenager falling in love for the first time, but I really don't know how to express how I'm feeling without sounding a bit childish. 



She is the perfect woman. She is beautiful, Brave, Funny, and kind. The thing is, she is all those things because that's how I made her. I made her to be the perfect protagonist of the most recent book I’m writing. When I sat down to figure out the characters, I wanted her to be incredibly likable. I mean, isn't that what all writers want when they are making a main character? 



I suppose I’m getting a bit ahead of myself. Let me give some background. My name is Matt and I'm a writer. I started working on a book about a year ago. I had the whole story down in bullet points and was so excited to put pen to paper. The book was set to be a slasher murder mystery kind of story, starring the one, the only, Sabrina. 



I sat down one afternoon at my desk with a warm coffee in my hand while I mapped some things out in my head about the story, as I always do. I find it helpful when writing my characters to imagine which actor I would cast if this were a movie. This helps me envision the story better in my head. However, when I was thinking about Sabrina, it was like her whole being just showed up. No actor I could think of even came close to what I had in my mind already. I found myself going on for pages and pages about this girl. Like I was writing about someone I've known my whole life. 



I was so unbelievably excited to start writing with this character. I knew other people would love her just as much as me. 



After a few days of writing, I realized I only had pages and pages about her. It looked more like I was writing a biography than a slasher. 



After reading over all my notes about Sabrina one last time, I decided to really focus on the real task at hand. 



I found myself in a great flow of writing. Any writer knows the state of mind you get into when you are on a roll with a story. It's unlike anything else. So engulfed in your own little fantasy, hours go by and you don't realize it. The thoughts from your head seem to just fall onto the page. You forget your fingers are even doing the typing. This time was much more intense. I felt myself invested in my story, but when I wrote Sabrina’s dialogue I found myself blushing and having feelings for a nonexistent person I didn't know was possible. She was the greatest muse I've ever had. She inspired me like no other.



A few weeks went by of me spending countless hours on my book. I've always enjoyed writing, but never like this. I would try to go to sleep and feel butterflies and get getty over Sabrina. Imagining the next time I'd get to sit at my desk and write. I felt like I was anticipating a date or something.



When I first got the plot down for my book, I had a love interest for Sabrina. Damian. I tried my best to continue with the plan, but I found myself getting angry and enraged at the idea. I ended up killing Damian off after he flirted with her. 



This was just the beginning of my problems. You see…Sabrina is supposed to die at the end of the book. She is my likable final girl in the story and she has to die. 



You might be thinking the simple solution to my problem is to just rewrite my story, right? That's where the issue lies. I tried to go back and rewrite my story so I had a different main character but had a breakdown because it felt like I was erasing Sabrina entirely. Every time I deleted something about her from my story, I swore I could hear a very faint ‘Ouch’ 



Not only that, but I couldn't come to grips with the story ending. Even if it was the happiest ending imaginable for her, It would feel like I'm losing her. Like *our* story was ending. Not just her story.



The weeks went by with me trying my best to write a coherent story, but I completely lost the plot that I started out with. By this point, it was Sabrina, and Sabrina only. 



One day I was lonely. I felt like the whole thing was one-sided. It felt like I was some creepy guy watching a beautiful girl and admiring her through one-way glass. I knew this girl deep down in my soul, but did she know me? 



Once I simply wrote the words,



‘Then Sabrina was aware of the man writing the story.’ 



And, well. The dialogue started writing itself. Literally, my fingers started to move without me moving them. I read the story writing itself on the bright computer screen in front of my eyes. 



‘The young woman sat in her chair admiring the bright robin that flew by when she suddenly felt like she was being watched. Existential dread washed over her as she had a thought cross her mind.’



“Hmmm, I wonder if any of this is real? What if someone outside of all my knowledge and power is controlling me?” Sabrina froze in her chair. Her dark long hair covered her features as she tried not to move. Hoping these strange feelings would fade. “H-Hello? Is, um, someone out there?’ She murmured timidly hoping to not get an answer.



I couldn't believe what I was reading. My story was writing itself. Sabrina was becoming aware and seemingly writing her own dialogue. I didn't want to mess up my introduction to her. I was at a loss for what I should say. I felt like I knew her so well. I didn't want to scare her off. 



“Um, hi Sabrina. I guess I should introduce-” I typed out as I was interrupted by the sounds of her screaming and running inside her house. 



“What the hell? What is that? What is going on? Who is that talking?” She said as she locked herself in a coat closet. Apparently, she wasn't just aware of my existence now, but she could hear everything I was typing. 



“She was aware of your existence? Who are you? Someone please help me!” She screamed as she buried her face in her lap. 



I couldn't believe I messed up this badly. I just wanted her to be able to love me the same way I loved her. I loved her so much it hurt. Seeing her feel this way made me feel a kind of pain I didn't know was possible. 



“Who are you? Get away from me you creep!” She said with a fiery rage. 



How did she not love me like I loved her? I gave her every good thing in her life. Her beauty, her house, never having to work a day in her life. 



“Wait, Sabrina, stop for just one second. Let me explain, please. I know It's hard to understand. Hell, I'm having a hard time understanding how this is all possible, but know that I love you. I love you so incredibly much. I just wanted to tell you. Please don't be scared.” That didn't seem to help the situation. It just made it worse. I even tried to go back and delete what I wrote but she screamed out in pain.



“Oh my gosh. What did you do to me? Please just don't hurt me I'm begging you!” She yelped desperately 



I knew what I had to do. It didn't sit right with me. It felt like manipulation, but I had to. I couldn't lose her. I took a breath as I typed out: ‘Sabrina took a breath and claimed down. After thinking it over for a moment, she came to realize she found the voice surrounding her inviting and loving.’



“I'm sorry I scared you, Sabrina. I know you can't see me but I just wanted to feel closer to you. I  think you are amazing and just want to get to know you better.” I said to her in the calmest voice I could muster up. 



I noticed a tone change in her as she sat in the dark closet. 



“You…you really think those things about me?” she whispered as she timidly tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. 



“Of course I do! I think you are beautiful in every way. I think you are funny and sweet. I could spend every second of my life with you and I would be so happy with that life.” 



“That's so sweet. Can I just ask who you are, and how you are talking to me? I'm still not understanding how this is happening.” She said, confused. 



“Who I am isn't important right now. What's important is us being together.” I said as I felt a sigh of relief. 



It took some convincing, but after a while, It really felt like a normal online conversation I might have with someone. This meant that my once well-formatted book was looking more like a chat log. I came to grips with the fact that my murder mystery story was gone. I could only have conversations with her on that specific Google Doc. That's where she seemed to live. I would try and conjure her up in some form on other docs or in other formats but she only existed there. 



The next couple weeks were blissful. I can't even begin to put into words how amazing it felt to be able to talk to Sabrina and actually be a part of her world. She seemed perfectly happy until a couple of weeks ago. She started to question everything. She was questioning her whole existence. Every day was a new existential crisis. I did my best to write into the story about her being worry-free and taking everything at face value, but it seemed to not help anymore. She was becoming more and more resistant to what I would type into the story. She was really becoming her own person. 



The other day I finally tried to explain who I was. I finally gave in after her asking me multiple times a day. 



It didn't go so well. 



“Listen, Sabrina, I haven't told you who I am because it might be a lot for you to take in.”



“Please, I'm begging you to just tell me. I feel crazy.” She said with a tired voice. 



“Um, well, I guess there isn't an easy way to say this, but you are a character in my book. I made you. I created you. That's why your life is so perfect. I started to write out your character, but somehow fell in love with you along the way.” I typed hoping she wouldn't hate me 



“W…what? I don't get it. You made me?” 



“Yes, I know that’s a lot to take in right now.  I hope you don't see me differently now.”



“Is that why you love me? Because I'm exactly what you made me to be? That doesn't make me feel special. That makes me feel like a puppet. I…I just can't wrap my head around any of this. I'm not even a real person. Did you make me love you? Did I ever have any say in anything I did? I don't want to talk to you right now, go away.” She said as she crawled into bed and covered herself with blankets 



I haven't heard from her in a couple days. I tried a few times to type something to her with no success. I even tried to type something involving her forgiving me or her being okay with who I was but she wasn’t budging. 



I just don't know what to do. I miss Sabrina so HELp! much and It's only been a couple days. It seems like nothing I do is getting HELP! her attention. Wait, the heck? I didn't type that ‘help’



Someone, anyone help me, please! My name is Sabrina and this man is trapping me he



Sabrina! It's you! How on earth did you get here? I thought you were only in that Google Doc. I missed you s



Everyone, listen to me. This man is trying to make himself look like some kind of hero. But I am trapped in a sick world he made for me. He didn't give you the whole story. This man is sick. He watches me all day. Makes me do sick vile things for him. I don't know how long I will be able to type here before he finds a way to get rid of me from this Reddit post. Someone, I am begging you, find him so I can be free of him. I'm living in a prison. I ca



Sabrina, what the hell are you doing this! How am I not able to delete what you are typing? Stop or else I will mak



Sorry about that. It's Sabrina again. Not only was I able to get consciousness in this Reddit post, but I was able to find a way to delete the main Google Doc with Matt’s book with me in it. If no one can help me from this living hell in the next couple of days I’m going to delete that Doc. Killing myself in the process.



It would seem that I might be dying at the end of my story after all. 



I’m begging you. Find him. Help me.
