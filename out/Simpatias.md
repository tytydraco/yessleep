The events I’m about to tell you about happened last week. It’s not something from a long time ago. It’s still happening, and I have to deal with it, even though I don't know how.

 

Since the pandemic, the company I work for started operating remotely, and it stayed that way for a good while. About three months ago, I stopped going to the gym, and since I moved to the city where I live less than a year ago, I don't have any friends here. So, I didn't have many reasons to leave the house. In recent months, I haven't stepped outside, only interacting in person with my wife and with the occasional neighbor who came to talk to me for some reason.

 

Then, two weeks ago, following the trend of many companies, they decided that employees should return to the office. At first, I was very nervous about it. Getting back on the bus. Leaving the house every morning, coming back at night. All of it seemed terrible to me. My wife helped me get used to the idea. At least now we live in the same city as the company, so the commute wouldn't be as long as it was when I first started working there.

 

Even so, the first week was very difficult. I no longer remembered how stressful it could be to leave the house. Dealing with people became a source of stress for me, even more than before. Working in helpdesk is pretty stressful. Not only dealing with clients who often don’t know what they’re doing and want to blame someone else, but also because various departments can make mistakes, but the client only talks to helpdesk, so we’re almost always the scapegoats.

 

I felt like I was in a meat grinder. Even if I managed to get home before eight, which was impossible when I lived in my old city, I still had the feeling that there wasn't much of my night left. It was just enough time to prepare for the next day.

 

By Friday of that first week, I was already feeling very overwhelmed. I left work trying not to think about the tasks I had postponed but would need to be solved on Monday. Instead of taking my usual bus from the stop near work, I decided to walk to the subway station. It was a 15-minute walk, but I usually took 30, walking slowly and trying to distract myself with things along the way. Halfway there, I decided to stop and eat something. I don't think I was hungry; maybe it was just something to comfort me with a little dopamine. I stopped at a small bar, ordered some snacks and a beer, then took out my phone and scrolled through Instagram.

 

Between one post and another, something caught my attention. It was a girl, maybe 25. Long black hair with pink streaks. She was exercising in a familiar place. It looked like the gym I used to go to, but I didn't remember her. I don't usually follow anyone I don't really know, except for content creators that I actually follow. I went to her profile. I was following her. But she certainly wasn't a content creator. She hadn't even posted in a few weeks. That gave me a nagging feeling, but my torrent of thoughts was interrupted when the bar employee arrived with my order. I put my phone aside.

 

I had only one bottle of beer, then went to the station. The time I spent was enough to escape rush hour. I managed to get on a emptier train and even got a seat. Even though I got home later, it seemed worth it. When I arrived, my wife had already gone to the gym, but she had left dinner ready. Since there seemed to be nothing else to do, I took a shower, had dinner, and threw myself on the couch to scroll some more. It wasn't long before I remembered the girl with the pink streaks.

 

“Sophia...” I murmured, entering her profile again. I don't know what it was, but something about it was making me really uneasy.

 

I thought she might be my wife’s friend; maybe she had asked me to follow her or something. But when I checked, the two didn't follow each other. I wondered if I had ever reacted to one of her stories. I went into the DMs and to my surprise, there was a conversation. The conversation started with a like from me on a story of hers that was no longer available. Then it continued:

 

Me: “Good to see! Focus!” It was probably a story of her working out.

 

Sophia: “Thanks. Lol. And you? Haven't seen you training anymore.”

 

Me: “I took a break. I don't think the gym is for me. But seeing you train is an incentive.”

 

She sent a smiling emoji.

 

I felt a chill go up my spine. The conversation was from a month ago. But I didn't remember any of it. It was as if it had been written by someone else. I even wondered if my wife had taken my phone thinking it was hers; that had happened before since our phones are identical. I thought about asking her, but was stopped by a strong sick feeling in my stomach. Something told me not to, and I decided not to say anything about it yet.

 

That night was difficult. I couldn't stop thinking about that conversation. Was that flirting? It didn't seem like something I would do. Was I trying something with that girl? Was I drunk that day? No, it’s been a really long time since I drank that much. That couldn't be it. I couldn't get any sleep, so in the middle of the night, I just got up and went to the living room. I went back on Instagram, deleted the conversation, and unfollowed the girl.

 

“There.” I thought to myself. “Now I just have to forget about this story.”

 

The next day was Saturday. Some weekends, we would go back to our old city, which was an hour and a half by bus from where we currently live. To see family, friends, and everything else. This time, we split up as soon as we arrived in the city. It's a small city, so you can walk everywhere. We got off downtown, said goodbye, and she went to her mom's house, and I went to my parents'. We would meet up again at night.

 

The path was always nostalgic. The streets of the city where I grew up seemed untouched. Everything was there, the same, as if it were immune to the passage of time. The square, the main church of Our Lady. Everything just as I left it. I caught myself smiling alone with satisfaction. So distracted that I almost tripped over a man sitting on the sidewalk. Shaken, he seemed fine. I apologized, and saw that he was asking for money. I don't remember the last time I used a physical banknote. I usually pay for everything with a banking app. However, to my surprise, I opened my wallet and there was a ten-dollar bill. Worn out, apparently wet. It must have been washed with some pants. I wouldn't miss it. I gave the bill to the man, he thanked me, and I continued on my way to my parents' house.

 

That time was really healing for my mind. Sometimes I feel that my parents' house is currently the only place I can really relax. Maybe because there, I'm the visitor, so I don't really have any responsibilities. Maybe because of all the good memories the house brings me. Maybe because of seeing my brother and catching up. We’ve always had a much better relationship than the average siblings. But probably a mix of all these things.

 

I was on the couch, resting after lunch, when my mother came to talk to me.

 

“Are you sleeping here tonight?”

 

“No.” I answered. “I think we're going to sleep at my mother-in-law's house.”

 

“That's a shame. I had already made up the room.”

 

“I would sleep here tomorrow, but I have to be at the company very early on Monday, so I think we’ll go home tomorrow night.”

 

“All right. Next time, then. In any case, the things you left last week are on the bed.”

 

And saying that, she went to the backyard to continue taking care of the plants. I was thoughtful on the couch. I didn't remember forgetting anything. Maybe it wasn't anything important, since I hadn't missed it. In any case, I decided to take a look.

 

I turned on the light in the room, and I saw what was on the perfectly made bed. A shirt. Some underwear. An old headphone. And a notebook. A notebook I didn't remember. Surely it must have belonged to my brother. I put the other things in my backpack and went to his room with the notebook in my hand. I knocked on the door and heard a “Come in” from inside. When I entered, he was playing on the PC.

 

“Look, I think this is yours.” I said without giving it much importance, throwing the notebook on a shelf.

 

He took his eyes off the frantic game for a few seconds, then returned to the screen.

 

“I don’t think so.” He replied.

 

“What? It’s not mine either.”

 

Apparently something happened in the game, and a red game over screen lit up. He turned his attention to me, now more focused. He raised an eyebrow in a strange expression.

 

“No? But it was with you last week.”

 

“Was it? I don’t remember.” I replied, confused. At this point, doubting my memories. Or lack thereof.

 

“Yeah. Isn't that the spell notebook or something?”

 

Spell notebook? I sat down instantly on the rug near the bed. He just put the headset back on and went back to the game.

 

I analyzed the notebook from the outside. It was a thin, very common notebook. Hardcover, covered with black suede paper. It looked old and yellowed. When I opened it, the inside of the cover had “simpatias” (superstitions/sympathetic magic) written in blue ballpoint pen. Already a little smudged, it looked like it had been written a long time ago. Flipping through it, I saw that the content was a complete mess.

 

There was no logic or organization system. Different pages were written with different handwriting and pen types. The things written there ranged from “Recipe to always have money when you need it,” “How to be invisible to your enemies,” “How to discover something that is hidden,” to more nonsensical things like “To change the colors of your sock,” “To attract the attention of stray dogs,” or even “To know in which direction the nearest McDonald's is.”

 

I laughed a little to myself. That notebook couldn't be mine. I would certainly remember reading something like that. Besides the recipes, if I can call them that. There were also what appeared to be comments. I decided to read one.

 

“To always have money when you need it, take a bill of any value you want. Put it in a glass of water with salt and leave it outside overnight during a full moon. In the morning, take the bill and let it dry in the wind, repeating “Thank you very much, and come back soon” without stopping for a single second, until it is dry. Then store it in your wallet.”

 

Further down, comments written in different handwritings from the main text.

 

“It really works!” In red ballpoint pen.

 

“The ratio of water to salt must be less than 10/1 or it won’t work.” Another with more elaborate handwriting.

 

Finally, there was what looked like a stamp that said “Bullshit.”

 

It all seemed like a big joke. Maybe it was part of the idea to interact by writing something, then leaving it somewhere for someone to find. In any case, it seemed very fun. I didn't pay any more attention to it, put the notebook in my backpack, and went to play video games with my brother. Later, after dinner, I said goodbye, grabbed my things, and left for my mother-in-law's house. A fifteen-minute walk.

 

The night was warm, and I thought a popsicle would be nice. So I stopped at a little shop on the street to buy one. When I opened my wallet to get my debit card, something caught my attention. A ten-dollar bill. First, I thought it might be another bill. But it was worn out, it had apparently been wet. I could have sworn I had given that bill to the man I found asking on the street earlier. I took the bill and stared at it, incredulous, as if it could tell me what was happening. I was pulled back to reality only when the clerk asked me again what the payment method would be.

 

“Sorry, I think I'm a little distracted today. It’ll be cash.” And saying that, I handed her the bill. And got the change. Two two-dollar bills. I put everything away and continued on my way.

 

I spent the whole way thinking about this. Wondering if I had kept the ten-dollar bill and didn't remember. Just as I didn't remember the notebook. Just as I didn't remember the girl with the pink streaks. None of it made sense.

 

Upon arriving at my mother-in-law's house, I took a shower and went to my wife’s old room. We caught up. She told me what she did during the day, about the cousins who had also been there today, and about the pets she hadn’t seen since last week. While she was saying all this, I was a bit spaced out, thinking about all the things that had happened. Answering the basics, robotically, while flipping through the notebook sitting at the computer desk. I flipped through the pages until my eyes were caught by something that completely stole my attention. Her voice became more and more distant. A look of panic and disbelief took over my face as my eyes ran across the page.

 

“To get rid of a persistent thought:

 

On a new moon night, write the thought that bothers you on a sheet of paper. The paper must be virgin, but the pen must have been used every day for a month. Write it down and then fold the sheet and store it.

 

 

Every night, until the waning moon, you will act this out every day: Pretend you are going to open the sheet, then stop as if you were distracted by something else.

 

On the night of the waning moon, burn the sheet, put the ashes in a glass of filtered water, and drink.”

 

Further down, some comments with other handwriting as always.

 

“It can take a while, but it works!” Said one, difficult to read, in blue ballpoint pen.

 

“The amount of water influences the result. The more the better.” Another in cursive, written with what looked like India ink.

 

Finally, the comment that made me freeze.

 

“This junk doesn’t work. But I’m going to try again.”

 

It was me. It was my handwriting. I would recognize it anywhere. How could I have written that? My stomach churned. Silently, several pieces fell into place in my head. None of it made sense. Suddenly, my wife called my attention again.

 

“Are you listening to me?” She questioned angrily, pulling me out of my trance.

 

“Sorry, dear. I’m just a little...” My voice failed. “Hey. Do you remember a girl from the gym, one with pink streaks?” I asked suddenly. Unable to contain my confusion.

 

First, she seemed angry that I had changed the subject. But her expression quickly changed into a kind of sad, or pitiful, look.

 

“Sophia? Did you hearing about it too?”

 

“Hearing about it?” I felt that sick feeling in my stomach again, as if my insides were being churned in an ice cream maker. “Hearing about what?”

 

“It's been a few weeks since she last showed up. I thought she had just stopped going to the gym. But I heard comments from people closer to her. It seems she’s disappeared. Her family has been looking for her desperately.”

 

All of these things happened last week. Since then, there has been no sign of Sophia. It's inevitable to connect the dots and imagine that this happened because of the notebook. Because of me. Since then, I haven't opened that notebook again. I haven't talked about it to anyone. Until now. Now, past the initial fear, I can't stop thinking that if there are answers to all of this, they are in the notebook. And I need to find out what it's all about.
