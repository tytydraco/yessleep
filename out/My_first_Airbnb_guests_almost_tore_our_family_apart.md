After I got laid off last spring, my husband and I decided to list our house on Airbnb. It's beautiful, a historic Queen Anne we inherited when Mark’s parents died. Much nicer than we could afford on Mark’s adjunct professor income and my (now-nonexistent) nonprofit salary from the food bank. Mark’s aunt Gail lives ten minutes away and agreed to let the three of us (we have a daughter, Stella) stay in their carriage house when the house got rented.

For reference, we’re in a small city in Michigan. There’s not a ton of demand for rentals but we figured we might get bookings for a few days here and there, folks visiting WMU or weekenders checking out the state park. Just enough to help make ends meet until I found another job. I really loved my work at Third Harvest, an organization that collected extra vegetables from local farms and surplus perishables from restaurants and grocery stores, and turned them into meals for whoever showed up hungry. Every day was different. Stop here to collect a dozen loaves of sourdough, here for a bucket of potatoes and carrots, here for a rack of chicken thighs, here for a pallet of bagged rice that had been punctured and was no longer sellable. I’m one of those types who loves to feed people but can’t cook to save my life. Anyway, we lost our federal funding and just like that, full bellies were once again empty. 

 The first booking request came in: ten days. The name on the account was “Felix A.” Two adults, one child age six—the same as Stella. This endeared them to me. Stella was our everything. After nearly a decade of infertility, after three miscarriages, two rounds of IUI, and two rounds of IVF, Stella was born. Our family was complete. I wondered what the renter’s daughter’s name was (but of course didn’t ask.)

Felix had no previous reviews on the site, which felt like a yellow flag, but he agreed to pay in full upon booking and waived the right to a refund in case of cancellation. I admit, we were nervous because of the horror stories you hear about nightmare guests and properties getting trashed. Still, the money was too good to pass up—it covered our property taxes for the entire year. I accepted. Mark and I celebrated with prosecco once the money hit our account.

\*

 Check-in day. I sent Felix a short welcome message. No response. They were probably settling in. I was nervous about being a host; I really wanted this first booking to go well so we’d have a positive review on our profile. And I admit, part of me wanted this family to have a pleasant time, for them to rave about my lovely home.

I’m a people pleaser. The short version is: Dad left when I was two, Mom died when I was seven. After that I was bounced around between disinterested relatives until I got myself into community college at 16; from there I transferred to WMU and met Mark. Sometimes it felt like the project of my adult life was to will into being the stable, loving family I never had. And I’d done it.

I titled our listing “Home Sweet Home.” The lavender and blue exterior paint looked wonderful against the fall leaves on the giant maple in our front yard. Like Mark, his parents were professors, and the house was full of books, art, travel mementoes, and old furniture. Not priceless antiques or anything but good quality stuff imbued with generations of love and memories. No gray HGTV floors or shiplap here. I wanted our guests to write in our guest book that I'd thought of everything. Locally made lemon verbena soaps in the bathrooms, soft fleece blankets tucked into a basket, a binder with instructions for how to work all the appliances along with recs for family-friendly restaurants, playgrounds, and nature areas.

I think what I really wanted was for a stranger to look at my life and want to occupy it for a while. For someone to look at our family and say: Yes. YES. Five stars.

Three days passed. Nothing from the renters. Out of curiosity, I drove by the house. The driveway was empty. All the blinds were closed and the curtains shut. It was strange to see the house so shuttered—we never closed the blinds, except in our bedrooms at night. The natural light spilling onto the hardwood floors was too pretty to keep out. Well, maybe they were jet lagged after a long trip and sleeping it off. Or maybe they really wanted privacy. It was harder than I thought, not knowing what was going on inside. But hey, they’d paid for the privilege.

I checked the app to make sure I hadn’t missed any messages. Nothing from Felix, though I did notice he’d removed some information from his profile—there’d been a picture when he booked the house, a smiling white man with glasses and thinning hair, blue button-up shirt. He looked like he could've been pulled from a stock photo catalogue of mid-level managers. Harmless. But now the photo was gone, and in its place was a question mark. 

During dinner that night, Stella had that glassy-eyed look she gets when she’s coming down with something. Then she curled onto Mark’s lap and asked to watch Cinderella. (She knows I won’t watch it. I can’t stand movies where kids are treated like shit by their relatives.)

“Big Saturday night for me,” Mark quipped, but I knew he meant it. Stella always got clingy with Mark when she was sick. She wasn’t a particularly affectionate kid otherwise, so this was his chance for cuddles.

Our neighbor Connie called. “Aren’t you supposed to have renters?” she asked. “I haven’t seen anyone at your house since you left.” Connie’s been widowed ten years; her favorite thing to do is keep track of the block. I explained my jet lag theory. “If they’re asleep,” she asked, “where’s their car?”

I wondered this too, but it was possible they had flown in and taken a cab or an Uber.

“They don’t have a car? Where are they from? Did you google them?”

Connie can be… paranoid. We chalk it up to loneliness and too much cable TV. She complains about dog poop on her lawn, or a car parked too close to her driveway, anything to force people to interact with her. Our street is close-knit, though, and we try to be sympathetic, bringing her cookies or casseroles or dropping by to chat while she tends her rose bushes (or pretends to). Sometimes it’s nice having a Connie on the block—someone who keeps track of things, someone vigilant. The tradeoff is, well, having her nose in your business. 

I didn’t have notifications turned from our home automation app. But after I said goodbye to Connie I opened it up.

All the squares representing the activity of our devices filled with the data from the previous couple of days. Oven programmed, oven program cancelled, turned on, cancelled. Heat set to 44 degrees, then up to 90, then 61, then the air conditioning set to 88, then 12 (!). Jesus, who sets the AC to 12 degrees in September? Or ever? The back door sensor tripped… 97 times last night alone. 144 instances of motion detected on the front porch. I gave up my pretense of allowing them privacy and checked the Ring camera. I was dying to know what these people looked like, what they were up to.

The front porch camera had been activated each time motion was detected. And yet, each clip showed an empty, still frame. There was no one there. I watched them all. There was never anyone there.

I paused the movie and showed Mark, whose sweet, big eyes got even bigger behind his thick glasses. “You stay here, I’ll go over,” he said, jumping up. “The camera might need to be charged. Or something’s up with the fuse box. I’ll bring my new voltage tester.” Mark greeted minor home repairs with the enthusiasm most people reserved for sex or last-minute courtside seats.

Stella immediately began to whine. “Noooo, staaaaaaay!” She grabbed Mark’s arm with both hands. Her fingernails, painted with sparkly purple polish, dug into his arm. It never failed to amaze me how tiny her hands were, how small the average six-year-old is. Her mind was always working, coming up with questions neither of us knew the answer to, reading more and more words every day, creating her own infinitely complex universe of thoughts. And yet she was so miniature. The size of a potato sack. Truly—once during hide-and-seek she hid inside a mesh bag that had previously held Yukon Golds. And yet this little creature asks us things like “Are there more blades of grass or leaves on trees?” and “Where did the first person come from?”

Mark gently peeled Stella’s fingers from his forearm. He made it into a game by loudly smooching each one as he went. When he was done he looked at me and said, “Seriously, I’ll pop by real quick and make sure everything’s kosher. You guys hold down the fort and don’t stress.”

Mark can be protective of me because of my past and honestly, not always in a way I appreciate. Sometimes he confuses the pain I went through back then for delicacy, or weakness, now. Like it’s his job to shore me up. But as I told him in counseling, my “trauma” is part of what makes me me. When we were going through the fertility stuff it was he who seemed weak and scared. I’d already seen what the devil looked like. I knew pain. He was meeting it for the first time. 

“We can’t just go over. We’re supposed to give 24 hours’ notice unless it’s an emergency,” I said. “Which I don’t think this qualifies as.”

I messaged Felix and asked if we could come check on a safety issue. Stella asked to watch another movie, and though normally I’d tell her to play outside or do something in her room, she looked so tired that I relented. Mark put on *My Neighbor Totoro* and Stella was asleep before the family had even finished moving into their old, mysterious rental home in the countryside. Mark carried her to bed as I watched Mei and Satsuki discover the adorable-but-also-scary dust bunnies and chase Totoro into a hedge. Their mom was in the hospital with some undisclosed illness and they only had their absent-minded dad to take care of them. I turned the movie off and scrolled through Indeed.

Maybe it was time for a pivot. Get my foot in the door at WMU doing something entry-level. Mark wasn’t tenured so didn’t get benefits, but if I got hired as a department assistant for $18/hour, I could get health insurance for our whole family.

It was close to midnight when I got a call from Maggie Akers, across the street. If she was calling, it was important. I answered immediately.

“Kate, I just texted you. Your house is blinking.”

I opened the video. There was our house—the hydrangea blooming in front of the wraparound porch, the pale purple tower room Stella loved so much rising against the evening sky. With every light in the house flickering and flashing on and off. The lamp in the living room window looked like a strobe. Other lights stayed on a while, then flashed once or twice, then turned off. There was no pattern to it. What the hell? Were they having a party? The listing specifically said NO PARTIES. The house looked so…out of control. My hands shook as I held the phone toward Mark so he could see.

“What the—” Mark stared at the video, mouth open.

I could hear Maggie on the line. “Kate, are you there? Should I call the cops?”

I begged her not to call the police, still stupidly thinking about my five-star review. She begrudgingly agreed. "I know you're in a bind, Kate, but this needs to be dealt with. It’s creeping me out."

I promised her we'd take care of it. As soon as she hung up, I threw my coat over my sweats. I told Mark I’d go by and see what the deal was. He argued with me, saying it wasn’t safe and that he should go instead. But I didn’t *want* Mark to come with me. I wanted to confront the situation alone.

“I’m a grown and autonomous person, Mark,” I said in the tone that immediately brought us back to therapy. He backed off.

“Call me the *second* something feels off,” he said. I felt relief as I pulled the door closed behind me. The smell of fallen leaves and woodstoves filled the air. I pulled my sweater around me. It was the first truly chilly night of the year.

In the car, I rehearsed what I might say. “Nice to meet you! Are you trying to break my HVAC?” My stomach was flipping. I felt queasy. Why was I so scared? It was an old house. It was probably just something wrong with a wire.

I turned onto our street. There was our house, flashing like a deranged Christmas display. I crept closer. When I got to the Chen’s, three doors down, the house went dark. Like, BLACKOUT. I blinked. For a moment I saw a black Queen-Anne-shaped silhouette, as if it had disappeared completely and left only its shadow.

I looked down the block. The light of a TV at the Henderson's, the porch light on for the Rawles boys' 9PM curfew. Not a power outage.            

And then I felt it: I was being watched. And I could feel exactly where it was coming from: Stella’s room, the curved turret above the front porch. Someone was watching me from the darkened window. I couldn’t see them, but I knew they were there as clearly as I knew I was sitting in my car. It sounds crazy but it felt like they were sifting through my brain, looking for something. 

I saw my hand shift the car into drive, felt my foot press the gas pedal. I sped down the street. Only when I’d passed the end of the block did I feel whatever it was release me, and I began to feel warm again.

Who—or what—was in our house?

I called Mark and told him about the lights. “It was so weird, I felt like I was being… *possessed* or something.”

“Whoa. Are you—?” I heard Stella in the background. “I’ll be there in a sec,” Mark said to her. To me he said, “Are you coming home?”

Stella had fallen asleep by the time I arrived. Mark told me to lie down. He poured oil on my back and rubbed the knot above my right shoulder blade until it melted away. I breathed deep into my stomach. Everything was going to be fine. We were together. 

“Hey babe, when you said you felt like you were being possessed…you didn’t really mean, like, *possessed*, right?” Mark drew the side of his palm down my spine. “You were just freaked out?”

I thought back to that moment in the car. The sensation of  another conscience inside my head like a grasping hand. “I don’t know.”

“They were probably watching you from behind the curtains, weirdos.”

“Yup,” I said. I didn’t want to re-live the experience any further with him. So I said, “That’s probably what it was.”

A few minutes after Mark started snoring beside me in bed, my phone lit up. A message from Felix:

**where dol house**

Shit. We’d brought Stella’s dollhouse with us to Gail’s. She adored it and didn't want to leave it for strangers. It was at least a hundred years old, had been in the family forever. But it *was* in the listing photos. 

**I’m sorry, my daughter couldn't bear to leave it. I hope you understand. Also, I was curious if you needed some help with the lights in the house or the appliances? Neighbors have seen them blinking.**

Felix’s response: **need dol house**

What was wrong with this guy? I glanced across the room at Stella, who was looking pale and sickly. She clutched one of her dolls, Daphne. Stella’s breathing was ragged. I wasn't taking her dollhouse anywhere. Ugh, now I understood why people said Airbnb isn't worth the hassle. 

**I will bring a dollhouse for your daughter's use during your stay. I will leave it on the front porch tomorrow morning.**

\* 

When she woke up at 6AM, Stella was worse. Fever of 103, chills, headache. Tylenol wasn’t having an effect. I hated seeing her sick. Though I knew it wasn’t my fault, part of me always felt like I hadn’t done enough to protect her.

I kissed Stella’s sweaty forehead, drove to Walmart, and bought a dollhouse. Red roof, yellow façade. Ketchup and mustard. A balcony. There went eighty bucks. As I pushed my cart through the parking lot to my car, I passed a Dumpster overflowing with perfectly good food. Bags of bagels, apples, sealed sandwiches, unopened Lunchables. There is so much surplus in the world. There really is enough to go around. Of food, of love. I wish it went around. 

Maggie texted: **Everything OK??**

**Not sure yet. I hope so? They asked me to buy them a dollhouse. Gonna drop it by soon. Does the house seem normal?**

**House looks dead rn. A dollhouse???**

**For their kid. Ours was pictured in the listing but we took it with us. I wanna give them the benefit of the doubt…**

**GIRL. They are deranged. Kick them out already**

When I got to the house, the blinds and curtains were drawn tightly shut. The place looked like a mausoleum instead of our warm and comforting home. At least there was none of the sense of being watched that I felt the night before. I left the dollhouse on the porch and drove away as fast as I could.

Before I even got home, I had a message from Felix.

**not dol house!!!**

Enough was enough. I was done being nice.

**The listing showed a dollhouse. There is now a dollhouse there.**

I saw him start to respond. As I waited for his reply, my phone grew hot in my palm. Then it got REALLY hot. It was *burning* me. “Shit!” I swore and dropped it.

A minute later I picked it up. It had powered itself off due to the heat, and was merely lukewarm. I turned it on and it rang. Connie.

“Kate, your house is on fire.”

I ran inside the carriage house and told Mark what was going on. We both looked at Stella, who was rosy-cheeked and sleeping. It was tempting to bundle her up and carry her into the car. But if our house was going to burn down, I sure as hell didn’t want her to see it.

Mark had the same thought. “I’m going over there and giving these fuckwads a piece of my mind.” This time, I couldn’t stop him. He rarely got angry and when he did, there was no stopping him. He was gone before I could argue. I stood next to Stella’s top bunk, gently stroking her back. I could feel the heat radiating off of her.

Mark texted a few minutes later:

**House is fine. They burned the shed. Fire dept is here, it’s out. No sign of the assholes. They’ve got the house closed up like Fort Knox. I’m going in, fuck it. It’s our house.** 

I wrote: **I’ll see if Gail can keep an eye on Stella. Wait for me.**

**\***

 I passed the firetruck as it was leaving, saw our house intact. I let out a breath I didn’t know I was holding. The carved porch railing, the scalloped trim around the tower, the regal pointed roof with its tiny circular attic window—it was so beautiful.

Mark stood on the sidewalk talking to a police officer. No signs of life inside the house. There was the shed in the side yard, now a smoldering pile of blacked metal gardening tools and ash. “We’re positive it was the renters,” Mark was saying. “Kate has the messages on her phone where the guy basically threatened to do it. If I see him….” He trailed off, probably not wanting to voice the threatened violence he was imagining in front of the cop.

Then something red and yellow caught my eye. I stepped closer to the shed.

They’d burned the new dollhouse. I turned to look at the house. “FUCK! YOU!” I screamed.

The cop, an old-timer named Officer Karns, wanted to go inside. No one had answered the door earlier. I assumed they were gone for good. Fantastic! I couldn’t help but think of the money and be glad I’d allowed him to pay in full upfront. I wasn’t looking forward to dealing with Airbnb and filing the insurance claims necessary to rebuild the shed, but considering how bad the damage could’ve been, it still felt like we’d escaped something terrible.

I entered the code I'd set on the pin pad. 120718, Stella’s birthdate. Red light. What the hell? I had my key, so I unlocked the door that way. 

Officer Karns made us wait for him to enter first. I’m not a gun person, but I admit I didn’t mind going in behind him and his holster. He took each step slowly, cocking his head to listen. The house was silent. Hurry up, I wanted to say. They’re gone. It’s just our house.

Step. Step. Step. Around the corner from the front hall was the kitchen. When he got there he yelled WHAT the FUCK so loud my ears rattled and then I hurried forward and what he saw: our dining table and chairs, *upside-down on the ceiling*. I felt like I was going to throw up. Four chairs and a table, hanging there as if bolted.

Mark grabbed his throat as if choking. I leaned into him, smelling his fresh sweat. The table and chairs remained frozen, inverted, looking more viscerally wrong than anything I’d ever seen. And then I noticed the smell.

“What *is* that?” I sniffed. The air smelled sharp and alive.

“Ozone,” Officer Karns said. “Like after a lightning strike.”

Mark leaned over as if to vomit, but thankfully did not. Finally Officer Karns cleared his throat, shook his head, and said, "This is beyond my paygrade.”

“Please don’t go anywhere,” I begged. “Not until we go upstairs.” He grunted and agreed.

Mark took my hand. We looked at each other and for the first time in a long time, I couldn’t tell what he was thinking. He looked angry and scared, but also determined. Determined to do what?

Stella’s room looked like it had been attacked by a wild animal. The antique poster bed Mark’s grandmother had been born in was splintered and mutilated. The matching dresser had been chewed up and spit out.

In our room, the bed was still made. Hospital corners on the top sheet still as I'd folded them, a technique I’d learned during the year I stayed with my great-aunt, who treated me like a maid in exchange for my room and board. No one had slept in this bed. 

They’d been there five days. Where the hell were they sleeping? 

“This has to be some kind of joke,” Mark said.

Was it a joke? Or was it something we didn’t understand? I wasn’t into paranormal stuff, but I was having the same tingly feeling I had watching *Unsolved Mysteries* in my cousin’s room late at night as a kid. Something was happening that we didn’t, maybe couldn’t, begin to understand. But regardless of understanding, this much I could feel: Something was very, very wrong here.

Officer Karns finished his report and said we could pick up a copy for our insurance company in a few days. I filed an insurance claim with Airbnb and called a locksmith to come change the locks.

If they showed back up for some reason, we were supposed to call 911 right away. 

\*

Though the renters were most certainly gone, we were not in a hurry to get back into the house. Stella was not getting better. Her fever hovered around 103.5 for two days. On Wednesday night she started screaming that her neck and eyes hurt. Wailing, clutching her head. I could hardly breath, watching her. 

We took her to the ER. 

They admitted her based on the fever, gave her something that let her sleep, then ran a bunch of tests. Not flu, not Covid, not meningitis—thank god. She was fighting something off, but no one could figure out what. 

I had an interview the next day, community outreach at an organic farm. It seemed like a good fit, and in a way, I’d still be feeding people. I wore a floral dress and a blazer. The woman who interviewed me wore overalls covered in pig shit. She said they’d be in touch.

That night at the hospital, desperate, I convinced Mark to ask Deb for help. Deb Hedstrom was a colleague of Mark’s in the sociology department. She was a highly respected scholar with tenure, and had published several books on folklore and mythology; she also had a wildly popular podcast called Monsters Among Us that examined supernatural phenomenon from a historical, scientific, and cultural perspective. I found it all a little goofy, a little too woo-woo. But I didn’t care. And if anyone would know what we were dealing with, it was Deb.

“Fine, but really—this is a prank. Probably kids making content for Tik Tok.”

Deb agreed to a Facetime so we could stay at the hospital. “Hello, dear Wallaces! To what do I owe this digital honor?” Deb held a purple mug in one hand and waved at the screen with the other. A snout-faced dog shoved its snout into the camera and she pushed it away. “Krampus, *git*.”

I described what had been going on: the closed blinds, the blinking lights and power surges, the dining set on the ceiling, the desiccated wood furniture.

She perked up when I mentioned the furniture. “You mean it’s drained of color, turned gray?”

“Yes!” I told her about the dresser in Stella’s room.

She listened and nodded, running a finger back and forth over a chip in the rim of her mug. “This reminds me of something, actually. First Nations people talked about creatures called *matere*, which translates loosely as ‘feeders.’ Now, to back up: in some First Nations traditions, objects were considered to have souls. Not everything, but things that had been in close contact with people, with positive energy, that sort of thing, could sort of be imbued with their own spirit or soul. Think of the Velveteen Rabbit coming to life because of a child’s love.”

Mark and I exchanged a small smile. The Velveteen Rabbit was Stella’s favorite book.

“Once the object gains a soul, it becomes precious. And there’s a type of creature who feeds on these objects. Empties them of their life force. Wood in particular lends itself to this sort of energy transfer, perhaps wood remains alive in a way, its layers expanding and contracting and changing shape long after a tree has been cut down. Sacred wooden objects are sometimes found…drained, for lack of a better word. The natural color of the wood disappears and the object turns gray and brittle, splintering or even turning to dust.”

“So they're, what? Vampiric termites?” Mark asked. “Feeding on my family heirlooms because my parents loved me?”

“That’s not far off.” Deb nodded and turned toward my side of the screen, ignoring Mark. Here was a woman who was used to being doubted. Maybe there was more to her than I thought. “Some consider the *matere* to be a subset of vampires, not only because of the way they feed, but because of their documented effect on electrical fields. That would explain the appliances going haywire. They also avoid sunlight and—this is important for your case, I think—they can’t enter dwellings or use objects without permission.”

Krampus stuck his nose into the screen again. We all laughed when he stepped back and the image was obscured by dog snot.

“So if they wanted to get inside our house,” Mark said, “they’d need an invitation.” He looked at me. “We’re supposed to believe that semi-vampires used Airbnb to get permission to eat our antiques.”

I asked Deb, “Could that be why the furniture was hanging there? To like, literally drain the energy?”

Deb shrugged. “It’s possible. I don’t understand the mechanics of the energy transfer.” She hesitated, then added, “But the matere are considered… persistent. If they don’t get what they want, they have been known to come for humans.”

I understood. “If our furniture isn’t enough to satisfy them, they’ll drain us.” I said the name aloud to myself. “Matere. Matere.”

Deb wouldn’t meet our eyes. “I would exercise *extreme* caution.” She was scrolling on her phone. “I’ll have to check a couple sources, but I’ve never heard of them traveling this far south—they were usually reported in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories.”

“Maybe climate change is forcing them down here,” Mark said, rolling his eyes. “I’m sure next there’ll be polar bears in the yard.”

I gave Mark a hard look. I didn’t like when he was overprotective, but I didn’t like it when he was dismissive, either. I wanted him to want to look out for us. To believe there was something that needed looking out for. Without that, Stella and I were dangerously close to being on our own. 

\* 

A few days later Mark and I were in Stella’s hospital room, talking in low voices over her as she slept. She still had a fever, and her kidney and liver functions were borderline worrisome. Earlier that morning when she was awake, Stella held my hand and said in her sweet little-kid voice, “Mama, why don’t you make me better? Pwease? I know you know how.” My heart broke and it was all I could do to hold back my tears as I promised her we were doing everything we could.

But *were* we? The doctor had run another battery of tests that raised more questions than they answered. The not-knowing was the scariest thing of all. Stella looked so small and fragile, like she was shrinking.

I couldn’t help but connect the creatures in our house with Stella’s illness. It made no sense, and I didn’t mention it to Mark. Things between us had been tense since our meeting with Deb. It felt like he was trying to avoid what was happening, like if he didn’t face it, it wouldn’t be real.

I got an email from the farm. They were going in a different direction with the community manager position. They wished me luck.

Then, while we were in one of those hospital waiting room in-between periods where you don’t want to go home but there’s nothing you can really do here, my phone buzzed. A message from Felix. Felix!

My chest filled with a boiling heat. My mouth opened, I actually roared. If these assholes were appealing my report or asking for a refund they had another thing coming. I clicked to open the message.

**help**

I showed it to Mark. He crossed his arms, shook his head. “They’re baiting you.”

What did it mean? I had no idea. But I knew it wasn’t bait. “I’m going over there and taking care of whatever the hell this is,” I said.

“If you’re going, I’m going,” he said.

All the doors and windows in the house were wide open. Mark’s mom’s velvet curtains flapped out of the master bedroom window upstairs. As we got closer, we heard a metallic, whining pitch emanating from the house. Like a singing saw, or some interstellar emergency alarm. I clutched my head. It felt like the sound was coming from inside my brain. Mark paused on the front porch. His mouth hung open and his face was pale. Part of me thought, Good. Now you see. Now you have to believe.

Mark looked around desperately. “We need a weapon,” he said. He bent down next to the porch railing, grasped a spindle with both hands, and yanked.

“What are you doing? Stop! You’re breaking it!”

He stood, jumped down the stairs, and picked up a large rock from the garden bed. As if that would be of any use if we were dealing with what I thought we were dealing with. 

A deep moaning from upstairs. Stella’s room. I went in, pulled by the sound, terrified but unable to stop myself.

In the dining room, all the wood furniture was trashed. The gorgeous walnut sideboard with the carvings on the doors was now the color of bile. The two front legs were broken and the door panels were cracked in half. The dining table was the worst. It had been reduced to a pile of kindling and fine powder. Pain slashed my chest. Mark’s grandfather built that table. Its surface held lifetimes of family stories. All the adventures planned out, the spills from the kids, the scratches from pets long passed, the pale, heart-shaped spot from Mark’s kid sister Emily when she tried to remove permanent marker with bleach. All the after-school homework sessions, the meals shared, the holidays, the late-night conversations. That table was where Mark first told me he loved me. Tears welled in my eyes.

Mark was on the other side of the room in front of the shelf where we kept cookbooks. He held his mother’s copy of *The Joy of Cooking* in his trembling hands.

“What is it?” I asked.

He didn’t say anything, just turned the book around so I could see the pages.

It was blank. The matere had found a way to drain words off a page. His face looked like it had been drained, too.

They were upstairs, I knew this. But I couldn’t bring my body to move in that direction yet.        

Mark tried to turn a page in the cookbook, but it crumpled as his fingers pressed into it. Behind him, I noticed the painting of galloping horses had been transformed, the figures no longer distinguishable, the colors melted into a brown pool at the bottom of the frame.

My heart was thumping. I’m pretty sure I wasn’t breathing at all. I looked at Mark, looked at the staircase. He nodded. The sound was deafening. After this, I thought, I might never hear normally again.

We followed the trilling sound upstairs. The wailing grew louder. I thought of Stella in bed at the hospital, asking me to help her.

Stella’s door was closed. As I reached for the knob, it began to shake. I grabbed it and tried to turn, but it wouldn’t budge.

“There’s no lock on her door!” Mark cried.

“I know that!”

The wailing was so loud I couldn’t hear myself think. It sounded like glass shattering, a heart breaking. I have never felt such sadness. God, I missed Stella. I would’ve given anything to hold her in that moment. Mark took two steps back, screamed with all his might, and threw his body against the door. The doors in that house were solid oak, but somehow he cracked it. As he was stumbling back for another attempt, I kicked the knob as hard as I could. Suddenly, POP. The door flew open. The room was incredibly hot and smelled like chlorine.

I cannot adequately describe what they looked like.

The two adults had wart-like bumps swimming over the surface of their slender, scaly bodies bodies. Several shimmering, undulating appendages. Their heads were very small, maybe the size of apples. Their forms were in constant motion. If I wanted to hit one, I wouldn’t have known where to aim. They weren’t big but they exuded power. By which I mean I felt weak in their presence.

At first, they didn’t seem to notice or care that we were there. They were focused on a third one, smaller, who was lying in the corner, writhing and emitting occasional piercing shrieks. The small one. She was…dripping. Small drops of silvery mucus fell from her body, hit the floor, and dissolved. Every time this happened, the big ones moaned. They were *desperate*.

When one of them turned and registered me, I felt like a truck had been placed on my chest. I could tell Mark felt the same—he grabbed his neck as if choking. *Let me breathe, fucker*, I thought.

Its tiny head was a fluid silvery soup, black spots floating in a gelatinous “face.” Sometimes a bubble rose to the surface and popped. Were these eyes? Mouths? A big one popped right then and I realized what was inside the bubbles. Black teeth. Thousands of them. Jagged and gleaming and sharp, roiling beneath the surface. Strong enough to tear apart a tree, a bed, me. I fought the urge to vomit.

And then it lunged at me. Several layers of teeth upon teeth shot toward my face. I screamed and fell backward into Mark, who caught me and dragged me out the door.

Mark was carrying me down the stairs now. He hadn’t picked me up in years. I thought of Stella. What she’d said to me that morning. *Pwease? I know you know how.*

That’s when it hit me: *their daughter was dying*.

“Mark,” I said, forcing my voice out. “You can put me down.” He set me down and we stumbled onto the front porch. I’d never seen him look so scared.

“We need to go home,” I said. “You drive.” I knew what I needed to do.

Mark drove us to the carriage house. He kept saying, “Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.” As we pulled into the driveway, he said, “We have to call Deb. She’ll know what to do. She has to.”

I told Mark to go to the hospital and sit with Stella while I rested at home. “I’m exhausted,” I said.

“Are you sure? I don’t want to leave you.”

“I’ll be OK. I promise,” I assured him. “It’s almost six. Stella will be awake soon. Go.”

As soon as he left, I got a plastic bag from under the sink and put Stella’s beloved dolls in it. Then I put the dollhouse in my trunk. I thought of Stella. If I was wrong about this, I might never see her again. Then I thought of the small, dripping creature in the corner of her room. I put the key in the ignition, turned, and drove.

When I reached the house, it seemed to be… glimmering. It was like I could feel it radiating pain. I went inside, back up to Stella’s room. The two big ones were on either side of the small one now, their “skin” seeming to blend into one another’s. The small one was not moving.

I set the dollhouse and bag of dolls in front of them.

“I’m sorry I didn’t understand sooner,” I said.

The biggest one, who I’ll call Felix, slid the bag of dolls over to the small one in the corner, placing each doll on top of her shivering mass. There was Matilda, who had red hair and was missing an eye, wearing the red gingham dress Mark’s mom sewed for her. Patti, who was technically a Barbie but had no hair at all anymore, nor clothes except for some marker scribbles across her breasts. A few more handmade ragdolls: Ollie, Taylor, Ginger, and Big-Butt, who Mark’s mom had comically overstuffed.

As Felix worked, the other figure, the mother, formed hands and began to gently break apart the dollhouse. She placed each stick on the small body and right in front of my eyes, I saw the color leave it. The dolls began to shrivel. The mother stroked the child, placed more sticks near her face, and every time, the sticks faded and crumbled. The sound in the room began to change, the pitch slightly calmer, the vibration more peaceful.

She was coming back.

In the end, it took the entire dollhouse to heal her. The child sat up on her own, then stood gingerly. The forms of her parents shimmered and wiggled. I suddenly felt lighter than I had in years. The mother turned herself toward me, spiraling sets of teeth in pockets on her horrific face. I imagined what those teeth would feel like sinking into my arm, my stomach, my cheek. 

The creatures began to… pool up. It was like the way water forms a sphere in space. What the hell was going on? Stella’s nightlight began to blink and flicker. The bulb went POP and shattered. I screamed. Then I heard the heater click on. Hot air blasted into the already warm room. Oh god, were they going to trap us in here and cook us alive?

The matere had pooled into three silver balls and floated right past me, out the bedroom door, and down the staircase. I followed them, my legs wobbly, my breath in my throat. They flew through the open front door and just as I emerged onto the front porch, I saw them shoot into the sky. There was an awful crack, like lightning, as they departed. In the sky, they resembled birds flying north. Then they were gone. I fell to the ground and gasped for breath. I felt like I’d never breathe properly again.

In my pocket, my phone was ringing. There were three missed calls from Mark.

“Hey,” I answered in a whisper, still staring into the cloudless sky. I began to feel a little calmer, a little lighter.

“She’s OK,” Mark said. “She’s awake. She’s so much better. Whatever it was has passed. Her temperature is normal and she’s got so much energy she’s bouncing around the room.”

*Pwease? I know you know how.*

“Tell her Mama’s coming,” I said. In the distance, I heard police sirens.

“Are you outside? Wait—did you go back?”

“I… fed them,” I said. “They’re gone now, and they won’t be back.” As I said it, I knew it was true.

One, two, three squad cars pulled up in front of the house. Before Mark could say anything, I told him I had to go.

I explained to the officers that the renters had definitely left for good, and that we’d come to an agreement about compensation. No, I didn’t want to press charges. Yes, I was sure. As I made up a story, I let my gaze settle on the porch swing Mark’s dad had built. It was swaying slowly, back and forth, in a light breeze.

It’s been almost a year since “the incident.” A few months ago, I got an admin job at WMU. The pay sucks but the benefits are good. I spend my lunch breaks reading in the beautiful campus library. Sometimes I meet Deb for lunch and we talk about the *matere*. She’s become a good friend. Mark didn’t want to keep the house listed on Airbnb, but I promised to rent only to people with lots of positive reviews. We’ve had several nice families come through. They all left gushing reviews: *Everything was wonderful. What a beautiful home. Five stars.*
