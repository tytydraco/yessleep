&#x200B;

**Wulff:** Alright. Thank you for taking the time ma’am. Can I get you anything before we begin?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** No, no… I’m fine.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** Great. Then, let’s get started. So… you do photography, yes?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Yeah. I’m something of a photographer, I guess.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** Photographer or urban explorer?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Photographer. I don’t really consider myself an urban explorer. I mean, no I guess it wouldn’t be inaccurate, but I don’t usually go poking around abandoned buildings or anything. Usually.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** So the convent was an exception?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Well, you’ve seen some of the pictures I took, right? It was hard to resist. Sometimes, it’s just nice to take a closer look at an abandoned beauty that’s been somewhat reclaimed by nature.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** I suppose I could see the appeal.

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** I’d seen the convent a few times, actually. It’s visible from one of the hiking trails I frequent. It’s picturesque, sitting abandoned on a small island in the middle of a lake, crumbling into ruin, overgrown with greenery. Most of the roof collapsed long ago, but the trees and the brush that have overgrown it since then have more or less formed a completely new roof. They’ve turned it from an abandoned house of God into a living chapel of nature. It’s beautiful!

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** So I’ve seen. Do you know much about the history of the convent, Miss Chalke?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Nothing more than the obvious. Once upon a time it was a convent, now it’s abandoned. I did a bit of research into it… even asked my grandfather if he knew anything… he lives closer to it than I do… but I never actually turned up anything meaningful.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** Right, right.

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** I mean, even if there wasn’t much to find on its history, I still wanted to take a closer look and take some photographs for my portfolio. Crumbling ruins and lush greenery meld beautifully together, and I couldn’t really pass up the opportunity.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** And clearly you didn’t.

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** No… clearly I didn’t.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** Why don’t you tell me about your excursion, Miss Chalke.

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Well… it wasn’t hard to actually get to the convent. The bridge leading to the island was still intact and judging by the graffiti, I wasn’t the first one to cross it either. It’s a shame… actually. People had been using the area in front of the old convent as a party space. There were burnt out fire pits, stray garbage… it was… well, kinda desolate.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** I see. That does sound disheartening.

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** It was. I had to shoot my photographs of the entrance without showing the mess on the ground. I actually got to thinking that maybe I should bring some garbage bags to clean the mess up. Looking back, most of it *did* seem pretty recent, so I guess someone was taking care of the property, but… well, at the time it was a mess.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** But you still got your photos?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Yeah! And once I had a few nice photos of the outside, I decided to see what was waiting for me on the inside. The interior was run down and mostly untouched. There were weeds growing through the rotten floorboards and even some patches of exposed stone on the ground. There was a little bit of graffiti inside of the convent, but not as much as I’d seen outside. I kinda got the impression that people avoided going in there. Anyway, I took some photos, trying to avoid the graffiti where I could, which got easier and easier as I went deeper into the building.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** Less graffiti?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Yeah, which did kinda seem odd to me and I got to wondering if maybe it wasn’t safe to be inside, but what was left of the convent looked pretty stable! I mean, most of the inside had long since rotted away, making anything above the first floor virtually nonexistent. The only things left to confirm there even *had* been other floors were the empty windows. It was honestly kinda beautiful…

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** Judging by the pictures you provided, it was quite pretty.

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Oh, I can’t put it into words. Being there just sorta… it sorta gave me this feeling of contentment. Old wood crunching under my feet as I walked through the ruins of this place that God had abandoned, and nature had retaken. There was just the peaceful sound of my footsteps against the old wood and the brush, the occasional snap of my camera and that was all. It was beautiful… it was peaceful…

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** It sounds like it… although I suppose that changed when you found the sinkhole, didn’t it?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Surprisingly, no. Finding the sinkhole was more of a pleasant surprise than anything else. I hadn’t known it was there when I’d first entered the old convent, but claiming that it took me by surprise probably wouldn’t be entirely accurate either. If anything, I thought it looked interesting.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** Interesting?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Well, it was like this tunnel down into the bowels of the earth. Really I probably shouldn’t have gotten as close as I did, although I guess if I hadn’t gotten close, I wouldn’t have noticed the stairs.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** There were stairs?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Leading down into the sinkhole… I know it was… it was surreal. But at the time I figured it was just part of the convent. I mean, these stairs were *part* of the sinkhole, they weren’t some part of the convent that had fallen in they were actually *part* of the sinkhole!

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** Interesting… and you trusted they were sturdy enough to go down?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Was that wrong of me?

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** It might’ve been a little bit reckless.

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Maybe. But I was intrigued! And it *looked* sturdy. Plus, people knew where I was. My husband and my grandfather both knew I’d gone out to the convent. I figured that if the worst happened, they’d come looking for me.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** Well at least you’re optimistic.

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Is that really so wrong?

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** No, I suppose it isn’t… so you went down into the sinkhole.

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Yes, I did.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** What did you find?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** There was a little stream down there… and I could see other caves branching off from the main river. I didn’t explore those. I didn’t want to stay down there too long, just in case there was anything down there. I just wanted to get some pictures and leave.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** But there was something down there, wasn’t there?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Yes… yes, there was.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** Tell me what you saw.

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** It was something downstream. I couldn’t get a good look at it from the bottom of the stairwell in the sinkhole. It looked sort of like tree stump, but the way it was placed… it was odd. The stream ended at the stump and just sort of flowed around it, putting it on its own little island. And it was the only tree down there. Or… I guess the only *sign* of a tree down there. But there was something about it. I wanted a closer look.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** And what did you see?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** The stump was… someone had decorated it. There were human skulls around the base of the stump… or… they looked human. Something about them was off, but I’m not sure if I can really put my finger on it. The stump looked like it had been hollowed out, and I could see that someone had placed things inside of it. Effigies made of sticks, rotting fruit, stuff like that. It was like a shrine of some sort. I snapped a few photos of it… I assume you’ve seen them.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** Yes, I have.

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** It was strange. And while I was looking at that shrine, I heard movement behind me. Someone coming out of one of the other caves.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** Someone?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** It looked like a person. I didn’t get a good look at them but… it looked like a person.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** Can you describe them?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** No… I… I really can’t. They were wearing this thick black robe and some sort of mask. It was either shaped like a skull or… or it *was* a skull. They were coming out of one of the caves and just stared at me. They just stared…

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** Did they attack you?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** They came at me, yes. I got the feeling that I’d intruded somehow. They just started approaching me. I snapped a picture of them with my camera… I’d… um, I’d turned the flash on since it was dark. It managed to blind them for a moment.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** And then what? You ran?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Yeah. I just started running! I bolted past them and started climbing the stairs again… I swear I almost took them on all fours, I just wanted to get out.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** And the figure?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** I saw them trying to follow me and I could see other masked figures near the shrine. They never got close, though and once I reached the top of the sinkhole, I just started running as fast as I could.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** They didn’t follow you?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** I didn’t see them following me but…

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** But?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** I don’t know… I felt… I felt watched, for the rest of the time I was in town. I never saw anyone but I still felt watched. I still do feel watched?

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** And that’s why you’ve come to us, correct?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Yes. I haven’t… I haven’t seen anything. Not explicitly, but there’s been *things.* I’ve heard sounds outside of my house at night, I swear I’ve seen movement in the shadows. Maybe I haven’t seen anything, but I’ve *felt* it. Like… like someone is watching me.

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** I see. But you haven’t seen anything?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** I know it sounds paranoid. I know. But I’m *scared!* I *know* something is watching me!

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** But you don’t have any proof?

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** I have the photographs! I’m not crazy!

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** Miss Chalke, I’m not sure *what* to make of these photographs.

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** You think I faked it…?

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** I’m not sure what to think.

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** But you don’t believe me? Why the hell would I make this up? Go to the Convent yourself! See it for yourself!

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** Ma’am…

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Why the hell would I make this up? Why? Why would I fake these pictures?

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** Ma’am, please calm down.

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** Please, please, I’m not making this up. Something is following me!

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** Without any solid evidence, ma’am, there’s nothing I can do.

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** There has to be something! Please…

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** I’m sorry. I think we’re done here. Thank you for your time, Miss Chalke.

&#x200B;

**Chalke:** No… please no… please, please…

&#x200B;

**Wulff:** I’ll walk you out.

&#x200B;
