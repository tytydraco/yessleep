Hey, I have to share something really strange that's been happening to me. I might be overreacting a bit due to my recent stress and lack of sleep, but honestly, this whole situation is giving me the creeps.  
  
Recently, I moved into a cozy apartment on the outskirts of town. It was the night before last when I was engrossed in TikTok videos and out of the blue, I received a text message from an unknown number. The message wasn't exactly intended for me; it simply said,  
  
**"I can see now."**  
  
It left me feeling confused because these days, it's pretty rare to send a text to the wrong number.  
  
Anyway, I decided to brush it off and ignore the message. But then, something caught my eye—the sender's number. It looked eerily familiar. I mean, REALLY familiar, because it appeared to be my old number. Around two years ago, I switched providers and got rid of my old SIM card, thinking I had put that number behind me.  
  
My memory isn't the best when it comes to numbers, so I wasn't entirely sure if they matched. However, after checking my bank records, I confirmed that they matched down to every single digit.  
  
What on earth? Well, there's a rational explanation, right? SIM cards do get reissued, it happens. But after two whole years? I didn't even release the number—I simply stopped using it. Now that I think about it, it's possible that someone could use this number to access some of my old accounts! I can't fathom what the provider was thinking. It all seems like utter nonsense.  
  
But that's not the weirdest part. How do I explain the fact that the person who now has my old number accidentally texted my new number? The coincidence was too much to comprehend, and just as that thought crossed my mind, an unsettling shiver ran down my spine.  
  
As I glanced at the message once again, "I can see now”, a wave of suspicion washed over me. My initial thought was that it could be some sort of scam. Could it be possible that someone had somehow gotten hold of my old number? Although it wasn't the most comforting idea, strangely, I found some relief in the notion of a logical explanation. Without a better plan in mind, I decided to reply to the message.  
  
After a moment of hesitation, I typed, "Who is this?"  
  
To my dismay, when I tapped the send button, the message failed to go through. A red exclamation mark next to the text made it clear that the message hadn't been sent. Anxiety surged through me once again, exacerbating my uneasiness.  
  
The next morning, I woke up feeling shattered, my nerves on edge, as every rustling noise seemed to jolt me from my sleep. It was far from an ideal situation, especially since I had recently started a new job and was still on probation. Despite the exhaustion, I knew I had to take immediate action. Without even bothering to brush my teeth, I grabbed my phone and dialed the number of my old provider, hoping for some answers.  
  
Unfortunately, my call to the provider proved to be futile. The friendly lady from customer support sympathetically listened to my story but regretfully informed me that she couldn't provide any information since I no longer owned the number.  
  
"But I still own the number."  
  
Her voice carried a hint of skepticism. "You just mentioned that the new owner wrote to you."  
  
"Well, it could be someone who somehow got hold of it. Can't you simply deactivate the number?"  
  
"I'm sorry, but I can't block a number on a call from a different number. Perhaps you should try putting your old SIM card back into your phone and call us again."  
  
"Uh, I don't have the card with me at the moment."  
  
"So you've lost your SIM card? In that case, someone might have come across it and decided to use it."  
  
"No, I don't think anyone could have found it," I quickly interjected.  
  
"But you don't have it now?"  
  
"No, but..."  
  
I hesitated, realizing it would be a lengthy explanation to convey why I was certain that the SIM card hadn't fallen into the wrong hands. Feeling a mix of frustration and embarrassment, I decided to cut the conversation short. It seemed like a futile effort to convince them of my conviction.  
  
Ending the call, I couldn't help but feel foolish. The truth was, I knew exactly where that SIM card was now. It was tucked away with my other belongings from my "old life," which I had left behind at the old house.  
  
The thought of returning to that house sent a shiver down my spine. It held numerous painful memories and was the last place I wanted to revisit. However, one thing I knew for certain was that no one had access to the house except for me. Despite my attempts to rent it out, I had never found any tenants, which wasn't surprising given its dilapidated condition.  
  
Unable to think of any other course of action, I reluctantly decided to ignore the situation for the time being and headed off to work. But as soon as I stepped onto the subway, my phone buzzed with a new message from the same mysterious number.  
  
**“I’ve been trying to reach you for quite a while now.”**  
  
As the subway train began to move, the signal on my cell phone vanished. Two stops later, I hurriedly disembarked and dashed towards the escalator, quickly typing my response along the way.  
  
"Who are you? How did you get my number?"  
  
The message failed to deliver. Again.  
  
This is when I decided to write this post and ask for advice. What could be behind these strange texts? Could it be just a technical glitch causing the message to fail? Is there anyone who has had a similar experience?  
  
I have to head to work now, but I'm planning to try something different tonight. I'll make sure to keep you all informed about any developments in this situation.
