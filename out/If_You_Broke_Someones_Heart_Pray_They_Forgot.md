No one knew where the name came from.
People just started calling it The Void, because there wasn’t a better word. 
Nothingness felt too generic, and hell felt inaccurate. Hell implied punishment. The Void didn’t punish, it tested.

It always began the same way.

A couple went to sleep together, and one of them woke up alone.
The person left behind would wake in a room that wasn’t a room at all but an endless nothingness of beige motion, like sand caught mid-swirl, like the color you see when you close your eyes too hard and stare into the back of your own skull. No walls or ground you could sense. Nothingness.
Just movement with no direction, and a soundless pressure that made time feel thicker.

The ones who woke outside The Void always said the same thing too.
It felt like something had already decided for them.

Donnie didn’t panic at first.

That surprised Marge later, when she tried to explain it to people. She said he woke up confused but calm. Like someone who believed a misunderstanding would be cleared up with enough conversation.

“This isn’t right,” he told her through the portal the first time it opened. “This isn’t ethical.”
The portal appeared without warning, an oval thinning in the air between them, like fabric worn translucent. 
Donnie stood on one side, beige dust curling around his ankles. Marge stood in their bedroom, one hand still gripping the edge of the mattress in uncertain fear.
“I’m not dead,” Donnie said, voice steady. “You’re not God and can’t judge someone before they’re finished living. That’s not how it works…”
“I know,” Marge said.
She didn’t argue. That hurt more than if she had.
Donnie firmly, desperately, believed that The Void was a mistake.
But maybe it wouldn’t be all bad, he thought. “I’m not here alone…”

He’d seen her almost immediately. A shape in the distance, darker than the beige, moving against the current like she had weight. A girl, maybe. A woman. Someone human enough that his heart leapt when he noticed her.
He waved. She didn’t wave back, but she didn’t disappear either.
“See?” he told Marge. “I’m not alone. There are others. So maybe I’m here by mistake. They’ll figure this out.”

Marge swallowed.

She didn’t tell him that everyone else said the same thing at first.
That they always thought they saw someone.
The phenomenon didn’t discriminate by age, but the couples it chose tended to have history. Years and decades, sharing lives so deeply intertwined that betrayal didn’t always carry repercussions, but weight. Cheating was the most common offense. Lying came second. Sometimes it was something harder to define, emotional abandonment, quiet cruelty, a thousand small choices that added up to harm.

The rule of The Void revealed itself slowly, but once it was understood, it was always the same:
The other person was given a date and time.
A choice.

Donnie didn’t believe that part until Marge showed him the notification on her phone.
It appeared like a reminder text she hadn’t subscribed to. A simple text, no sender.

RETURN WINDOW:
Saturday, (DATE REDACTED) 11:30 a.m.
Failure to arrive will be considered FINAL.

“If you come back,” Donnie said, “what happens?”
Marge hesitated.
“They say… if I come back, you can come out.”
Donnie exhaled sharply. “Then that’s it. That’s the solution, just wait until then and get me the hell out of here.”
But there was another rule. 

One no one liked to say out loud.

You couldn’t force the release.
The person outside had to choose to return.
Love mattered. Trust mattered. The Void didn’t accept transactions made out of feelings of obligation alone.

That was why so many people never came back.

The first night was hard in The Void. The portal between The Void and the real world was opaque on his end.

The girl he thought he saw was nowhere in sight once he was alone.

One moment she was there, still distant, still indistinct, and the next she was gone, like The Void had erased the idea of her. Like it tricked him into believing he’d have some sort of companionship, as if he deserved it.
Donnie was spinning in his mind, dark static matter whipping faster around him, his voice echoing, as if swallowed before it could travel.
“That’s not fair,” he said.

Marge heard it through the portal, warped and thin. She could see him, if she wanted to, by summoning the portal via the link on her phone, but she had the option to allow him to see her. She chose to keep her presence unknown.

After a few days she stopped seeing him regularly. The thought of him begging her became too much to handle. She chose to just watch.
“This isn’t fair. You chose me for this, didn’t you? How could you do this?”

His words broke apart. He stopped finishing sentences.

“That’s not fair,” he repeated, softer now, like he was trying to convince something that didn’t listen.

Marge cried after that.
She cried because she loved him.
She cried because she remembered being young with him, because decades of shared life don’t evaporate just because trust fractures.

She cried because she was lonely.
And she cried because, deep down, she believed that if she didn’t go back for him, something would come for her eventually anyway. Karma, consequence, God, whatever name you gave it, she felt its breath on her neck.

Saturday came.

Marge returned.

The Void spit Donnie out.

He collapsed onto the bedroom floor, solid again, crying and laughing at once. The Void sealed behind them like it had never existed.
People said it was beautiful.
People said it was proof love could redeem.

But…I didn’t say anything.

I couldn’t stop thinking that Donnie had deserved to stay.

That The Void had been right.
That Marge had confused compassion with justice.

I said it too many times. At family gatherings. In hushed conversations. Once, too loudly.
“He cheated,” I said. “Why does he deserve to come back?” 
We’d known Marge and Donnie for years. My grandparents church friends. We’d known they had their problems, and Marge couldn’t leave so we supported her the best way we could. This felt like just desserts.

People told me I was being cruel.
Donnie avoided my eyes at ever Sunday dinner. 
I wish I had just stopped talking.
Because The Void doesn’t disappear when it’s done with someone.
When a person leaves The Void, they’re given something else.

A submission.

The rules came out slowly, like an infection.

If someone escaped, they could anonymously submit another person into the system. 
The Void would pair them with the person who had loved them most and been wronged by them.
Love was the key.
Not current love. Not forgiveness.
But the deepest imprint.
The Void didn’t care how much time had passed.

Mine came on a Tuesday afternoon.

My phone buzzed while I was standing in line at a grocery store, staring at nothing. 
I almost ignored it.
Almost.

VOID PAIRING CONFIRMED.
PARTNER: Sabrina.

I dropped my phone.
I started shaking before I understood why.
Sabrina.
We were young. We were stupid. We were real in the way only first loves are real, messy, blinding, precious. She loved me more purely than anyone ever has.
And I took her for granted.

I didn’t cheat. Not like Donnie. 
That almost made it worse. I was careless. Dismissive. I assumed she’d always be there, waiting for me to decide she mattered.
By the time I realized what I had lost, she was already gone.

I screamed.

I screamed that I wouldn’t go. That I refused. That they couldn’t make me.
Because I knew the rule that mattered most.
The person outside has to choose to come back.

And I didn’t know if Sabrina loved me anymore.
So here I am, waiting for The Void to devour me. I know I won’t be coming out once I go in.

The Void doesn’t care if you’ve changed.
It only cares what love remembers.
I don’t know how much time I have.
People think The Void is rare. 
It’s not. 
It’s just waiting and listening.
People aren’t playthings. Hearts aren’t toys. Love isn’t a game. 

Check your phones. If you see a name you don’t remember, or worse, one you do, don’t ignore it.

If you ever hurt someone who loved you, really loved you, pray they forgot.

Because The Void hasn’t.
