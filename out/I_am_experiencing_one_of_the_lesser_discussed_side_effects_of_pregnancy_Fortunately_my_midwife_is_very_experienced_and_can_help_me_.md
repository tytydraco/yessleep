Betty, the midwife flashed a competent smile at George. He understood, squeezed my hand encouragingly, murmured something about a washroom, and slipped out of the room.

Alone, we looked at each other. Then I said “The animals-“

Betty nodded. “All pregnant women see the animal spirits of people my dear. They just don’t talk about it.”

I felt like crumpling with relief. “Oh thank god. I was freaking out you know, but then I also felt comfortable- if that makes sense- “ I was babbling, almost delirious with joy at finally being able to share what had being haunting me since the last appointment. 

As my pregnancy progressed, whenever I encountered anybody, for the first few moments I saw them as their animal spirit. Then, my rational brain would regain control and I would see them in their normal human shape.

Betty however seemed to know exactly what I was going through. She took my hand. “Don’t worry my dear. It’s completely natural. And of course, George is such a sweetheart. I suppose you see him as a beagle?”

I nodded. “Yes! And my mum is an older gorilla, and my dad is a walrus- but why? How?”

“It happens around the first trimester, as you discovered. It’s some sort of survival mechanism, our hormones, who knows. But of course, we don’t talk about it. Women have a hard enough time with pregnancies without adding this on to everything else going on. I mean, can you imagine?” Betty smiled deeply at me, and I felt a surge of emotion I have never felt, and don't know how to name.

“And of course, it fades once you give birth. Like the pain of labour and childbirth, your body will work to make you forget it.”

I nodded thoughtfully. “But- what if I see someone as a terrible animal? What should I do?”  
Betty laid a finger on my lips. “You say you’re feeling sick, and you leave.”

George tapped on the door and came in, and for a few moments I enjoyed his handsome cute lovable beagle face before it flickered into human-ness.

That evening, Alison and Henry, two old friends came around. They had been travelling, and we hadn’t seen them since I became pregnant. I was fully expecting to see Alison, a bright bossy woman, as a cat, and frankly I was a bit worried in case I saw a tiger. I hadn’t given much thought to Henry, something of a beige background man.

Alison entered first, Henry was parking. I saw with a surprise a dull brown bird, like pheasant? A hen? 

She brought her beaked face and frantic bird eyes close to mine for a kiss. I blinked, and the bird was replaced by Alison’s sharply made-up face and newly-dyed blonde hair.

And then my heart skipped a beat, and a wave of nausea hit me with such force that I doubled over.

For greeting and congratulating George in the hallway was a large horrible glossy dolphin, opening and closing its wide teethed mouth with glee, emitting sharp cackles. 

I turned, and left.
