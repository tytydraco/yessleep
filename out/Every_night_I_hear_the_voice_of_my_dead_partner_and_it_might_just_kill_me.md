They say grief is a process. A storm you have to wade through before your life can go back to clear blue skies. That’s a lie. In my experience, grief is a cold and lonely home you live in. Over time you simply get used to the draft and creaky floorboards of it all. But the home stays the same nonetheless.

The apartment felt bigger after Lily died. Every room echoed with her absence. Every piece of furniture reminded me of lost moments at her side. There was no escaping it. For weeks, I barely left the apartment at all. I wore her favorite hoodie until it stopped smelling like her. I cooked her favorite meals just to throw them away when grief became stronger than hunger. I stopped answering the phone.

That's where I was— knee deep in the wreckage of denial and no closer to the rumoured 'blue skies' of acceptance than I had been weeks prior— when the package came.

It was a small box, wrapped in plain brown paper with no return address. The handwriting on the label was uneven, shaky, as if whoever wrote it had trembling hands. I didn't recognize it but it barely mattered to me at the time. I had been running on autopilot for so long that I couldn't have paid attention even if I had wanted to.

Inside was a candle, thick and heavy, its pale blue surface covered in neatly carved patterns of sorts. Intertwined vines and flowers. There was no note, no explanation, just the candle that smelled faintly of lavender. The scent alone made my eyes burn with tears my body couldn't shed anymore, the well running dry. Lily had always had this quirky habit of leaving a small bundle of dried lavender stems in her drawers so all her clothes would be imbued by the calming smell of it. The flower, and its' scent, had become synonymous with her name long ago, the two inextricable from one another.

I didn't think much of it at first. People had sent me all sorts of things since the funeral— flowers, condolences written on generic postcards, books about grief and loss, even the occasional casserole or pie. I assumed it was just another gift from someone who didn’t know what else to say to get me out of this funk, or what else to do to help me.

What good would a candle do when the one thing I needed, I could never have again?

I still lit it that night, craving for the smell of lavender to float through the living room once more. The flame flickered blue for a moment before settling into a soft, steady glow. The scent filled the room, rich, almost intoxicating. Nostalgic. I stared at the flame for a long second, inhaling deeply, feeling every muscle in my body loosen from the lavender's relaxing effects before knotting themselves up again at the myriad of memories it brought up.

After a while I managed to pry my eyes away without completely losing it and bursting into sobs right there, only for me to walk in the kitchen, ready to prepare Lily's favorite pesto recipe for the third night in a row, even though I hadn't tasted it once in all those days.

And then I heard it.

At first, it was barely a whisper, just the breath of a sound in that same way grief sometimes made you hear footsteps and phantom laughter in empty houses. My heart was heavy, heavier even than the day before, or the one before that. After all, I had heard her voice many times since the accident. All figments of my imagination, all memories haunting and taunting me. I tried to hang on to that reality, *my* reality, and busy myself with the food, but that hint of a whisper floated by my ear again and again until I had no other choice but to pay attention, knowing that it was all in my head and would inevitably hurt me more.

"Sarah?"

My body froze, my heart jumped, the spoon slipping from my fingers and clamoring down against the marble counter. I had never heard her so clearly before, the sound so pure and melodic compared to the muddled, muffled version my mind always conjured. It sounded just like her, every day, calling my name from the living room to ask if I wanted a refill for my wine glass, even though she knew it still stood half-full on the coffee table. It sounded like the real Lily. Not my version of her. Not my memory of her. Not my deluded visions of her. It sounded like *her*.

My own voice creaked. "Lily?"

The whisper came again, soft and hesitant, like she wasn’t sure I could hear her. “I’m here.”

I whipped my head around, trying to find her, to see her, to grasp at anything I could that would prove it wasn't all in my head, not this time. But there was nothing there. Just the empty couch, in the empty living room of the empty apartment. The empty space as still as it had always been since Lily died. The empty, and the candle, its' flame swaying gently with the rhythm of an invisible breeze.

“Lily? Is that really you?” I asked, taking a few steps towards the candle, each movement so tense, so minute, careful not to accidentally blow the flame.

I could have lost my mind entirely but I was past the point of caring, past the point of wanting to rationalize it all. If insanity was the path to reuniting with her, I would've walked it a million times over in that moment.

“Sarah... I’m here.” Her voice trembled, barely audible, like a breath carried by the candle’s flame as it swayed with each word. “God, I've missed you."

"H-How? You're... gone. It can't be..."

“You lit the candle for me." that bright chuckle of hers, the one that always punctuated her words when she thought I had said something silly, warmed the room in an instant, and my heart with it. "I don’t know how, but I’m here and I’ve been waiting so long to talk to you again, lovely.”

\_\_\_

I didn’t sleep that night. I sat by the candle, listening to her whispered words— her calling my name, or humming the tune of our favorite song. It felt like a dream, one I had had for so many nights in a row, finally seeping into reality. Like I’d fallen into some half-conscious state where anything was possible, where Lily, *my* Lily, was by my side once more.

I tried to tell myself that it was all a trick , that it was just my mind playing cruel games. I really did. But the seconds ticked by, the minutes even, and that sweet lilting voice kept on going, talking and talking about everything, anything, nothing—jokes we shared, stories we told. The way she teased me about my terrible cooking, the pet names she used when no one else was around.

By the time the sun rose, I was crying. For the first time since the funeral, I wasn’t crying out of despair, desperate to feel her warmth and her love once more. But because she finally didn't feel so far away anymore, for the first time in too long, she felt like she was right at my fingertips. Even if I couldn't see her. Even if I couldn't touch her. Even if I had made it all up, my mind finally broken by grief and denial. She was with me and nothing else in the world seemed to matter more than that.

\_\_\_

For a while after that, the days seemed to blur together a little. As I had always done, I would force myself to go about my day— my leave of absence from work had ended over a week ago and still it was torture dragging myself out of my misery long enough not to end up unemployed. Every night when I came home, I lit the candle, and every night she spoke to me.

The flame burned and danced steadily, the wax melting and the pillar shrinking slower than it should have. She told me about memories I’d forgotten—our trip to the coast, the way we got lost in that tiny town and ended up laughing and kissing in the rain.

She told me she missed me, that she was proud of me for holding on.

It was comforting at first, like finding a piece of her I thought was lost to me forever. Coming home and telling her about my day, listening to her talk herself silly about one thing or another. It was different than before and yet, in all the ways it mattered, it was the same routine. The same Lily.

God, I wish it had stayed that way.

But one night, after I had gotten home late from a bad shift, wanting too see and hear from nobody but her and drown in her presence some more for as long as I could until the sun would inevitably cut our time short again, she suddenly asked me why I hadn’t been in the car with her that day.

“You were supposed to be there,” she said, her voice sharper than I’d ever heard it. "It was raining, you *always* drive on rainy days."

I tried to argue, to explain that I was stuck at work, that the weather report had assured me it would be sunny for the entire week-end, that I didn’t know she was going to take that road. But the words felt hollow and meaningless. I didn't want to rehash what had happened, didn't want to think about the worst day of my life all over again. What excuse could I possibly make when she was the one who had lost her life that day, because I was late, because I texted her to drive there ahead of me, because I left her alone.

“You didn’t even call,” she said, and all I could do was hang my head in shame.

\_\_\_

The next night and the night after that, she brought up things I’d never told anyone—times I’d been too tired to join her on her adventures, times I’d secretly resented her for being so alive when I felt like I was barely holding on. She seemed so unhappy with me, so bitter. I wanted her to laugh, to make her silly jokes, to be as lively as she had always been. Before she died I took all of it for granted but now I couldn't bare to hear the disappointment and hurt in her voice, and yet more and more it was all she seemed willing to offer me.

"You don't visit me anymore..." she breathed one evening.

"I... I can't go to your grave Lily. It's too much..."

"Too much for you?" she scoffed. "I'm the one that's buried in that pile of dirt".

The candle fluttered, the flame swaying before shrinking quickly, as if mirroring Lily's temper and her tone of voice. I was so afraid it would blow itself out and Lily would be gone again. Even with the anger in her voice, even with the reproach, I needed her. Anything but the empty silence again.

"You know how much I love you, it's just-" I tried to appease her.

"Do I?" her voice cut me off from thin air. "Because you weren't there that day, Sarah. You should've been with me on our anniversary, and you weren't."

I could feel my breath catching, my throat seizing and closing around the guilt that obstructed it. She was right. It didn't matter that I hadn't known that night would turn out the way it did, when it mattered the most I hadn't been there. I was a horrible person, and an even worse partner. I had always known that. It hurt to hear she had known it too.

"I knew you wouldn't be there." she whispered before her voice disappeared.

I didn't hear from her again that night. I was besides myself. I had no time to give myself pity, to feel sorry for what had been said to me, for the truths I had to come to terms with. I was too terrified that I would never hear her again, that she would never come to me again. All I wanted was her voice, always and forever. I needed it more than I needed air. More than I needed sanity. Little did I know imagine that I could ever regret this wish being granted.

\_\_\_

She did come back after that night. Every time I lit the candle, she was there. Every time she talked and every day her words would hurt a little more, and even then I couldn't bring myself to think it wasn't all worth it.

"You used to hate me, didn't you, lovely?" she asked once. "How free spirited I was. How I lived life."

"What? No! I loved that about you... I-"

“Don’t lie to me, Sarah. I saw the way you looked at me. You thought I was selfish. Reckless." her voice sounded so bitter, so malicious almost, as if she started to enjoy seeing the hurt each word marked on my soul. "You didn’t say anything because you wanted me to love you. But deep down, you thought I’d burn out, didn’t you? You thought I’d ruin myself.”

I hiccuped between sobs. "Stop it. You’re twisting things.”

"Do you remember the last thing you said to me?

"I- I said I loved you..." I manage to form the words.

She clicked her tongue, or at least it sounded like it, as if she was chastising a kid for getting an answer wrong. For lying. "No, Sarah. You told me I was a burden. You told me I was too much.”

My head spun, my heart racing as I tried so hard to remember. I had done my best to forget that day completely, to expunge from my memory the moment I had received the call about the accident and the blur of moments that followed. We had had a fight that day and I barely recalled what it was about anymore, it didn't seem to matter when it had become too late for me to tell her how sorry I was.

“I didn’t mean it like that! I was just upset, Lily, please.”

"You meant every word." she spat. "I replay them in my head every second I’m down here. ‘Why can’t you just take care of yourself for once, Lily?’ That’s what you said. That’s how you left me.”

"Stop it. Stop it, please." I begged and begged, tears running down my face, illuminated only by the candle amidst the total darkness the living room had fallen into.

"I’m telling you the truth. You didn't love me. You tolerated me, pitied me." Lily's voice seemed to sigh, a mocking sound, as if she was the one pitying me now, looking down on me like she felt I had looked down on her. "It was easier to let me die than to watch me live, wasn't it?"

\_\_\_

By the third week, I was afraid to light the candle, to hear her accusations knowing all of them were true, even the ones I didn't believe. She couldn't be wrong about me, she had always known me better than anyone. Day after day I became more horrified about the person she thought I was and more terrified still that this angry, evil version of her was slowly tainting the image of *my* Lily that resided in my mind, completely. Still I couldn’t stop myself. Her voice was like a drug, and I was too far gone to pull away.

The whispers grew darker, angrier. She accused me of things I didn’t remember, things I didn’t believe I could do. She said she could see me from wherever she was, that she watched me every day, that she knew the thoughts I tried to bury. That I couldn't escape what I had thought, what I had done, more than I could escape her.

"Do you want to know what it feels like, Sarah? Dying alone?" she mused, like an eerie whisper floating in the air and making the flame dance along.

I didn't want to know, I didn't want to hear. I wanted Lily, my Lily, the one who smiled and laughed but that Lily could barely hang on in my mind anymore, all there was was this, this voice, those words, the horrors it scarred in my memory. And I was a willing victim to it all. She knew it. So she kept talking despite the tears already staining my face.

"The moment I died, it felt like being swallowed alive by razors, like my own skin peeled back layer by layer, and I can *feel* it still, every second. It doesn’t stop, Sarah. It never stops." the sound of her laughter was pure evil, it was the only word I could equate it to. "And the dark—oh it’s alive, slithering over me, into me, filling every crack of my body and soul, swallowing my spirit, leaving me there to drown over and over, eternally."

As her voice kept on going, I wanted to bring my hands to my ears, I wanted to stop the words, I didn't want to hear it anymore, to imagine the torture she suffered while I wallowed in my own self-pity for the last few weeks since her death. But Lily was unrelenting. She wanted me to know. She wanted me to hurt.

"And do you know what the worst part is? It’s not the pain. It’s not the suffocating dark. It’s the way I *remember.* The way I see you, alive, moving on while I'm *rotting,* Sarah. Because of you. And every time you light this candle, it *pulls* me back through it. All of it. You’re the one twisting the knife, over and over."

"I won't light it again! I won't do it anymore! Please!"

I yelled at the top of my lungs. I couldn't bare the thought, I couldn't have more of her pain on my hands. I didn't care if the neighbours heard me, if they thought I had gone insane. For all intent and purposes I had. I just wanted it to *stop.*

"*DON'T YOU* ***DARE*** *LET ME GO*"

The sound roared in the entire apartment, deafening, guttural and absolutely horrifying. It wasn't her voice. Not the sweet lilt of her tone, not the gentle inflection she always used on the wrong syllable, not the faint Swedish accent she could never quite get rid of. It wasn't *my* Lily. It sounded like pure evil, like the pits of hell groaning and moaning as the opened, all condensed into one voice.

The wax began to bubble and hiss, spilling over the edges of the candle and onto the white surface of the coffee table. I had never noticed before how the wax never ran down the length of the candle this whole time. I chose not to see it, how unnatural it was. The scent of smoke filled the room, choking me, burning my eyes, my lungs, my heart.

Her screams filled the room, rising to an unbearable pitch. I fell to my knees, clutching my ears, begging her to stop. I could hear her fear as the car swerved off the road, her pain as it tumbled down the roadside cliff, breaking every single bone until she was left there to drown in her own blood filling her throat. And then I could hear the thing, the demon that had played its part, that had taken her place, its' horrible gurgling screams of rage making me crumble onto myself.

"Watching you fall and die is all I have left!" it bellowed between ear piercing screeches. "Die for me, lovely. *Die. Die. Die.*"

\_\_\_

I can barely remember finding the strength to get up, let alone the strength to blow the candle out. The only thing that still spurred my body and its broken, shattered spirit, was knowing that the Lily I had known, the one I had loved — even if I had loved her all wrong, loved her too little — would have never wanted to hurt me this way. Thinking about how horrified she would be to even imagine it, I found it in myself to put a stop to it all. Even if the damages were already more than done.

The candle sits on my shelf now, its wax hardened into jagged, unnatural shapes. I can still hear her voice sometimes, faint and distant, like a radio station that won’t quite tune in. I don’t light it anymore. I don’t think I could survive hearing the screams, but no matter how hard I try, I never can bring myself to get rid of it completely. Not when I can have the prospect of her voice again, right there, just in my grasp.

I know it's not my Lily, but I don't think it matters anymore. The horrible things it said, the harm it wished on me, I deserve them all for leaving her alone that night. I know that now. I am to blame and I will bare that burden. And one day soon, when I'm ready, I will light this candle again and I will let this entity, this Lily, do with me as it pleases, so I can finally reunite with *my* Lily and suffer through the eons of pain that I deserve, never leaving her side this time around.

If dying is the only path to her, then so be it, I will take it without a second thought.
