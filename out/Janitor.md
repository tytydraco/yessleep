*When I returned to my hometown, the unchanged landscape surprised me. Manitou Valley had never been much, though, so perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised at all. Too obscure to appear on most maps, Manitou has always been the same little town, too small for even a local news station. Things usually spread around here through rumors and stories. I always liked that about this place, it gave it a mystical sort of feeling.*



*Mrs. Taylor was the first I visited, even before any family. It felt right; she deserved to see me first. Even disregarding the events of the past couple of months, the lady held a special place in my heart. For her sake, I wish I had been around when they apprehended Walker. The things he did had a particularly damaging effect on her.*



*When facing him, the sheer madness of it all caught me off guard. I harbor no doubts about his guilt in the crimes he was accused of. Yet, something just feels wrong. There's a strange truth in his words, or at least in what he sincerely believes. Perhaps that's what madness truly is—believing a lie of your own making.*



*During our interview, he was the sole occupant of that jail, making things easier for both of us. Guiding his thoughts into a coherent story proved remarkably difficult, especially while transcribing his words. Strangely, though, there were no inconsistencies in his account. While the grammar was nonsensical, the content was not. It was coherent, which made it all the more disturbing. Listening to his words felt like claws were ripping and twisting in my soul, a sensation I couldn't compare to anything else.*



**Allen Walker’s Account**



I know people are calling me crazy. If I’m being honest, they’re probably right. Everything that’s happened to me… well, our minds aren’t built to handle things like that. If I wasn’t crazy already, all of this has tipped me right over the edge.



*At this point, I already had to intervene and encourage Walker to begin his narrative of the events. Everything from this point on has been adjusted for the sake of clarity, but Walker’s words were surprisingly eloquent and coherent.*



Oh, yeah, yeah, I guess it’d be best to start where it starts.



In all its years, that school had me as its janitor for far longer than it didn’t. From the moment I walked through that front door and into those echoing halls, I felt a connection to the place. It was a strange connection, not unlike the one between a man and his dog. I loved that school. Once, I had grand aspirations and lofty dreams, but those got scrubbed away in an instant on my first day there. It was always just the school for me after that; it’s all I was really interested in.



I could say it felt like a second home to me, but it was a lot more than that. It was my one and only home, that damn school. Everyone knew me. Even if they didn’t know my name, they knew me.



It wasn’t unusual for me to stay long after hours, despite what you may have heard around town. School ends at 3:05 p.m. every weekday, and I’d take a ten right around then to give time for the kiddos to leave. After that, most of them would be gone. Of course, there are after-school programs. You know, sports and clubs and such, but they were always out of my way enough to keep cleaning. At the end of the day, I’d usually be heading home around 6:30 or so.



 *He began to say something but looked reluctant. I pressed him about this.*



Well, for the past month or so, I’ve been staying an hour longer. There was this little girl. Her name was Emily. She’d been sitting outside the school on the steps, just waiting for someone to pick her up. That poor girl would wait there for hours until one of her deadbeat parents remembered to come get her. Manitou ain’t exactly a town full of criminals and predators, but it didn’t feel right just letting that girl sit there all alone.



“Hey kiddo, are your parents coming?” I asked her.



“Yeah,” she replied, meekly, “My dad said he’s coming soon.”



I glanced toward the entrance of the school, noticing the frost covering the surface of the steps, a testament to the biting cold. “It’s freezing out here,” I remarked, sympathy clinging to my voice. “How about we head inside where it’s warm? I’ve got a cozy spot in the janitor's closet, and we can play Candy Land to pass the time. What do you say?”



I realized how creepy that must’ve sounded as soon as I said it. “It’s- it’s a lot bigger than you’d think. The closet. It’s more like a room really. It opens right into the teacher’s lounge and there are plenty of teachers still here. Besides, I think the snow’s getting worse.”



She smiled. After that, I don’t think she ever stopped smiling. “Okay,” she replied, her voice rising in pitch to indicate her excitement.



As we walked back into the school, I abruptly realized how potent the smell of disinfectants must be to a young nose. Emily pinched her nostrils tightly with her fingers. “Pee-ew!”



“Yeah,” I said with an awkward chuckle, “It’s not the most pleasant of smells.”



It didn’t take long to get to the teacher’s lounge. As soon as we made it, she plopped herself down right on one of the three sofas, which circled around a brown wooden coffee table. She looked like she hasn’t sat in anything besides her assigned desk at school in a very long time.



“Well, uh, I’ll just go get the game and we’ll play it here, how about that?” She nodded her head. While no one else sat on the couches, the principal and assistant principal stood by the window, looking curiously at Emily. I gave them a glace and told them the situation.



“Her parents are late to pick her up. I figured there’s no point in letting her freeze out there.”



They both nodded understandingly, returning to their conversation. Rifling through my junk in the closet, I scolded myself for keeping my things so unorganized. I was a janitor, after all. I should know better.



After less than a minute, I found it in all its rainbow-colored glory. The box was torn and creased all over, and I’m sure a few pieces must have been missing, but it was more than enough to keep a young girl occupied while we waited for her parents. I exited the closet, holding the box up with a grin across my face for Emily to see. Before I could set it down, I heard the faint sound of three sharp taps down the hall. Emily, the principal, assistant principal, and I all turned towards the hall at the same moment. I shrugged it off. “Must be a woodpecker,” I said, “Those things make all kinds of racket.”



As I set down the game on the table, another three taps emanated from down the hallway. This time, they were loud enough for me to surmise that they must be coming from one of the windows.



“I’ll go check it out,” I said with a tired sigh.



Stepping out of the room, I looked down the hallway toward the sound and saw something. On the other side of one of the windows, the figure of a person stood, only their outline visible. Any defining features were shrouded by the intense cloak of the winter storm, now raging on worse than ever. My pulse quickened as I approached hesitantly, unsure what a person could possibly be doing outside of a school in this type of weather, let alone tapping on the windows. The cold chill of fear crept up me as I took each step, almost as if I were out in that storm as well.



*Tap tap tap*



*Tap tap tap*



The sound grew faster and louder as I approached, my heart pounding like a drum so hard that I could almost hear it. I could see the figure’s finger outstretched, tapping against the window with an eerie urgency. At no more than fifteen feet away from the window, the tapping became so fast and frantic that there was no longer a discernible pattern.



*Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap-*



As I grew closer and closer, the figure faded away into the tempest of the storm. I was seized by desperation, realizing that someone, potentially dangerous, could be out there stalking around the school. Putting my hands around my eyes like binoculars, I pressed my face up against the window, hoping I could see where it went. My breath fogged against the window in rapid bursts. It was no use, though; the storm had swallowed up the figure as if it was never there in the first place. One thing caught my eye, though. On the center of the pane, where I presume the person’s finger was tapping, there was a dark grey greasy fluid, as if this person’s hand was covered in runny clay.



With my mind able to offer no explanation, I returned to the lounge, again scolding myself for my failures. The three people in the room looked at me, clearly waiting for me to say something.



“I was right, just a woodpecker,” I said, “Apparently the things could care less about the cold.”



As before, the principal and assistant principal returned to conversation, and I sat down on the couch across from Emily. “Alright,” I exclaimed, feigning excitement, “I’m sure Candy Land is a lot less miserable than Manitou right now.”



We played the game for at least an hour, most of that time spent figuring out the rules. In the end, I don’t think we were playing it right anyway, but the girl certainly had fun. We just played and played, making up rules as we went, which always favored her. Eventually, the other two adults left the room. I asked Emily if she’d be more comfortable if we could find one of her teachers to leave her with, but she insisted we keep playing our game.



Just a couple of minutes past 7:30, I heard three rapid knocks. Without a word, I rushed to the front door, the source of the sound, my heart resuming the pace it achieved only an hour prior. I cracked open the door, somewhat relieved to see a normal-looking man.



“My daughter Emily in there?” he asked, his southern twang thicker than molasses.



“Oh, uh, yeah, she is,” I stammered, taken off guard by the abruptness of his arrival, “I’ll bring her right out.”



Returning to Emily, I couldn’t help but notice the disappointment etched across her face as I told her of her father’s arrival. Without much of a word, she embraced me tightly and ran off to her father, who was waiting impatiently at the front of the school.



After I heard the screech of the doors, followed by a hefty slam, I returned to our board game, slowly packing it up as I reminisced with a strange nostalgia on events that took place merely minutes before. Once finished, I placed the box back in the closet, this time in a much more accessible spot.



With all of my duties completed, it was time for one last sweep around the school. Usually, this was standard procedure in order to make sure everything was where it should be and that there weren’t any staff still lingering around. On this occasion, though, I also happened to be checking for intruders.



The sweep went by without any incidents, for the most part. The corridors were devoid of life, just as they should be, and everything was perfectly clean and tidy. Like always, I left the gymnasium for last. It was the section of the school closest to the entrance, so it only made sense to do it last, but it also gave me the creeps. Casting a quick glance around, I noticed something nestled tightly beneath the bleachers. Cautiously creeping closer, I quickly realized what it was: a baseball bat. I picked it up, unsurprised that a careless child could’ve let it roll out of sight and forgotten about it. For a moment, I felt silly for inspecting it with such fear, but terror again swept over me as I heard three sharp taps coming from the hallway.



A mix of fear and anger brewed inside of me, swelling together like a nasty cocktail. Judging by the volume and echo of the tapping, I estimated that it must be originating from the same window as before, or at least one very close to it. Standing still, I assessed my options. I gripped the bat so tightly that my knuckles turned white.



I would use the exit in the boys’ locker room to leave the building, circle around the perimeter of the school to the strange figure, and hopefully apprehend them. With the bat and the cover of the snowstorm, I figured I wouldn’t have any trouble reaching the person without being seen.



Deciding that I shouldn’t waste any time, I acted against my fear and executed my plan. I strode with confidence through the locker room, unlocked the door, and exited into the storm. The wind was so cacophonous that I couldn’t here the sounds of my own footsteps. Holding the bat tightly in my left hand, I grabbed a rag from above one of the lockers, rolled it up, and wedged it in the door. Then, using the wall of the school to my right as a guide, I circled around the premises, slowly making my way to the stranger.



Each step felt like walking a mile. The snow was so deep and frozen that the simple act of walking required an excruciating amount of effort. The storm, refusing to let up, remained the perfect cover, both visibly and audibly. Despite this, however, as I stalked closer and closer to the figure, I began to hear the sound of the tapping.



*Tap tap tap*



*Tap tap tap*



Like before, the taps came in threes, rapid and loud. Knowing the figure was still there was enough to cause the fear inside me to chill my bones even more than the storm. This fear only grew and grew as the taps, just as before, became more frequent in pace and loud as I approached.



*Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap*



*Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap*



I slowed, out of both fear and exhaustion, but the tapping did not relent. Soon, much to my horror, it turned to banging. It seemed to me that this person was trying to break the window.



*BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG*



My movement ceased. Though I could not see, I knew I was within striking distance, and certainly also close enough for this figure to hear me if I shouted.



*BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG*



Taking one step closer, I could finally see the figure, as faint as it was, banging on the window with all of its might. They were tall, almost freakishly so. No less than six and a half feet at least, probably more like seven feet. Their arms swung in unnatural rotations, generating so much speed that I was astonished the windows were not already shattered. It took all the bravery I had inside me to open my mouth and shout.



“Stop that right now! I have a gun and I will shoot you if I have to!” It was a bluff, but a convincing one. Though I could see the figure, and they could likely see me, there would be no way for them to discern the nature of the weapon I held in my hands.



The wind picked up, impairing my vision even more. I moved my forearm over my face to protect my eyes. As I lowered it, shivering and gripping the bat, the figure was gone. Using the bat, I reached out, confirming that there was nothing in front of me. I cursed to myself silently. Whoever this person was, they were violent and clearly intent on terrorizing the school.



Trudging closer to the window, a foul stench entered my nostrils. As I leaned my head closer to the window, the smell worsened, causing me to reel back in disgust. Pinching my nose, I leaned back in, noticing the window was covered in dark grey sludge. It smelled putrid, like a mix of feces and rotted food. During my long years as a janitor, I’ve encountered countless repugnant odors, but nothing was as terrible as this.



With no interest in remaining out in the storm, I transferred the bat to my right hand and guided myself back to the locker room using the wall of the school and my left hand. Retracing my previous footsteps made the walk back slightly easier, but it was still an extremely difficult journey.



Suddenly, a cold object slapped across my face, being pressed against it by the wind. Confusion turned to dreadful understanding as I heard the sound of a door slam shut. It was the rag I used as a wedge. With this wind, I should have known that the rag wouldn’t have been secure.



I reached for the keyring at my belt, knowing how difficult it would be to find the correct key with my fingers so stiffly frozen. Fear made me dizzy as I flipped through the keys, the skin on my fingers burned by their cold metal surfaces. Looking down at my keys made me feel so weak, so vulnerable, knowing that the strange man could be so close by without me even knowing it. Someone of his size, and I was almost certain it was a *he,* would have no trouble overpowering me in a fight. As my thoughts raced, I realized that I found the correct key. I stuck it tightly into the lock and twisted the handle, which was thankfully not frozen in place.



Entering the locker room, I closed and locked the door behind me, thankful to be back indoors. I quickly realized that leaving the door wedged open was a poor decision as I viewed the scene around me. A massive amount of snow had blown its way into the locker room, partially melted and sludgy across the floor. It was a complete mess, but after all I had been through, I decided to deal with it in the morning. Besides, I figured there probably wouldn’t even be school tomorrow after I reported this incident to the police.



Still shaking, I leaned the baseball bat against a locker; just another thing I’d take care of in the morning. Continuing out of the locker room, my gaze crept downward, my mind piecing together a terrible realization that numbed every inch of my body. The trail of melted snow didn’t stop in the locker room; it continued on through the gymnasium and out into the halls of the school. My breathing quickening, I turned back into the locker room, retrieved the bat, and shut the locker room door.



I made sure the door was locked tight and peered out the pane of glass built into it. There was nothing in the gymnasium, but out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a figure passing through the halls in front of the gymnasium door. It was only a blur, but I was certain I really saw it. I turned, back pressed against the door, and dropped slowly into a sitting position on the floor. I didn’t have a mobile phone and there certainly wasn’t a phone in the locker room. For a brief moment, I considered my options, but my thoughts were cut short.



*Tap tap tap*



Directly behind me and slightly above my head, the glass pane on the locker room door was being tapped on.



*Tap tap tap*



I strained to look up, but the angle made it impossible to see through to the other side.



*Tap tap tap tap tap tap*



Tears welled up in my eyes from the sheer terror of the situation. I had no choice but to sit there, waiting for the intruder to wander somewhere else. Never in my life had time gone by so slowly. Only one thing served to remind me of every passing moment.



*Tap tap*



I looked down at the baseball bat in my hands. I considered trying to fight the man but decided against it. Doing so would require standing up and unlocking the door, which would not only alert him of my presence but also give him ample opportunity to easily seize control of the situation as I opened the door. Though a terrifying solution to the problem before me, my best and only real option was to remain still.



The tapping continued for what felt like hours. I was so deathly tired that I began to think I was dreaming. In between each set of taps, I would convince myself that this whole ordeal was in my head, but as if responding to my very thoughts, the taps would always return, snapping me back to my horrible reality.



Then, some unknowable amount of time into my torment, the sound stopped. Seconds and then minutes passed in complete silence. My body, in complete and utter shock, collapsed completely. There, I laid sprawled on the floor, snot running from my nose as it continued to thaw. While my eyes slowly closed shut and my mind wandered to sleep, air snuck through my runny nostrils.



I smelled a familiar putrid smell.



*At this point, Walker became somewhat unresponsive, staring at the ceiling. I urged him to continue his narrative.*



It was a little after 5:00 a.m. when I woke up the next morning, still lying where I had collapsed. I gathered myself as quickly as possible, which must’ve taken a lifetime. My limbs were stiff and sore, refusing to recover from the previous night’s trauma. I grasped the baseball bat with my right hand, knuckles cracking out of their frozen stiffness. With no other reasonable course of action, I began making my way to the principal’s office, where the nearest phone was located.



Each step I took echoed painfully, a horrible reminder that if someone was still here, they knew exactly where I was. These thoughts fueled my growing paranoia, transforming every shadow and object into that stalking monster. With only a short distance left to the phone, my pace became more frantic. Soon, my careful walk turned to a sprint.



My momentum came to an instant halt as I slammed into the office’s door. Hands trembling, I gripped and turned the door’s handle. Hastily, I slid myself into the room, opening the door just wide enough for me to fit through and lock it behind me as fast as possible.



Leaning against the principal’s desk for support, I slid my fingers across the numbers of the phone, only illuminated by a subtle light coming from the hallway and through the small glass window on the door. I dialed the sheriff’s number, praying I recalled it correctly. The phone rang once, twice, and then a gruff voice answered, “This is Deputy Collins, you’ve reached the Manitou Valley Sheriff’s Office.”



“This is Allen Walker, I’m a janitor at Valley Public, there’s an ongoing… incident,” I stammered, failing to hide the fear in my voice, “Someone was trying to break into the school last night and I think they’re still here.”



“Calm down Mister Walker, we’ll be there shortly. Just make sure all the doors are locked and stay put. If you encounter the intruder, do not confront him or aggravate him in any way.”



“Yes, okay, I will-,” The light coming through the door suddenly retreated, only to return as I turned around to look through the small window.



“Mister Walker, are you still there?”



“Yes, just… just come quickly, please,” I said before hanging up.



Any comfort provided by the locked door was dwarfed by the uneasiness I felt being so exposed. Anyone or anything in that hallway could peer right through the window on the office’s door and see me. I sidled along the wall next to the door, attempting to hide my body from sight.



*Tap tap tap*



The sound came from the very glass I was obscuring myself from. My knees involuntarily collapsed beneath me, causing me to sink into a sitting position. With barely enough energy to comprehend what was happening, let alone ponder who or what this was, I could only focus on staying hidden.



*Tap tap-*



As if interrupting the second set of taps, the phone started to ring. With no courage left in me, I allowed the phone to ring. Eleven rings went by before the caller was directed to voicemail. A kind, yet concerned voice spoke from the other end.



“Hi, my name is Candice, I’m the mother of Jonathan Pryce. I called last night because Jonathan didn’t come home from school yesterday afternoon, but I still haven’t heard from him. He probably just spent the night at a friend’s house and neglected to tell his poor mother. It wouldn’t be the first time and I know it won’t be the last. If you could, please just make sure he shows up to school today and give me a call when you see him. My nerves just won’t settle until I know he’s alright. Thank you so much. Buh-bye.”



*Tap tap tap*



The door handle rattled, scaring me enough to let out a slight yelp before covering my mouth.



“Mister Walker, are you in there? This is Deputy Collins.”



My relief had never been so great in my life. I dropped the baseball bat, rose from the ground, and peered through the door’s window. As I remember, five officers were there in total. Two, including Collins, were on the other side of the door. Two more officers were further behind patrolling the hallway, so far away that I could barely see them. Even farther behind them, a fifth appeared to be entering the gymnasium. I figured he was more than likely following the trail of water left the night before. I opened the door, smiling awkwardly at the two officers.



“The front doors to the school were unlocked. Were they left unlocked by you?” Deputy Collins asked.



“I… can’t remember, I’m sorry. It’s possible, but I’m not sure,” I replied, frustrated that I couldn’t recall such a simple detail.



“That’s alright, Mister Walker. Why don’t you go ahead and show us where you first saw the intruder, then run us through everything that happened afterward?”



I nodded, then proceeded to show him around the school, recounting my experience. When reaching the area of my first confrontation with the intruder, Collins made special note of the strange substance smeared on the window.



“What in the world…” he muttered to himself, examining the sludge very closely, gagging when he got close enough to smell it. “I’ve never seen anything like this. This was here when you found the intruder last night?”



“Yes, it was,” I confirmed.



“It’s not necessarily related to the break-in,” another officer chimed in, shorter and skinner than Collins, who was a rather muscular man. “It could be the remains of a dead animal, maybe dead for a long time. The cold can do weird things to carcasses like that.”



“That’s true,” Collins granted, “But we should still take pictures and collect some as evidence.”



The other officer took a slight step back.



“That means you,” Deputy Collins said more decisively. “And *you* will continue showing me what happened last night,” he continued, pointing at me.



I took him back through to the locker room, continuing to explain the events. At the conclusion of it all, back in the principal’s office, Deputy Collins sighed.



“Well, Mister Walker,” Collins said with a serious tone, “we’re definitely going to have to shut this school down for a few days while we continue to investigate. Whatever is going on here, we can’t be sure it’s safe until my three officers and I finish investigating and find some answers. For now, you should head home. We’ll contact the principal and make sure no one shows up here for a while.”



I nodded, not a single bit of energy left in my body. Deputy Collins escorted me to the front of the school and put his hand out to open the door before being interrupted by a loud shout coming from the gymnasium. Wordlessly, he drew his pistol and began running toward the noise.



“Stay there!” he shouted back at me.



Only moments later, I flinched from the sounds of gunfire. A dozen shots rang out, at least. The two other officers, from opposite ends of the school, ran with weapons drawn into the gymnasium. More shots were fired, and then as quickly as the chaos started, silence once again reigned.



“Deputy Collins?” I shouted, desperately needing a reassuring response. Inching closer to the gymnasium, I noticed one of the officer’s pistols at my feet. I bent over, picked it up, and raised my head to see the lifeless hand it had slid from, jammed through the gymnasium door, propped open only by the officer’s arm.



I froze in place, refusing to get any closer. This wasn’t real. This couldn’t be real. My extreme fear dispelled such doubts, however. No nightmare, however vivid, could make me this terrified. In the silence, with nothing but the sound of my own breathing, I stared forward toward the gymnasium. Somehow, though, according only to my gut instinct, I knew I had to look behind me. Against all logical thinking, I turned my head. There, I saw it.



Peering around the corner of the hallway, only twenty meters or so away, was something human in shape only. It made no attempt to escape my line of sight. Its eyes, so wide and piercing, shot through me like daggers. Its skin was pale, wrinkled, and malformed, its fingers long and slender. In place of a nose and upper jaw was a disgusting cavity filled with blood and puss, connected flimsily to its lower jaw, still barely intact.



Not even the storm outside could freeze me in place so suddenly as this thing did. Only instinct snapped me out of this state as it began rounding the corner in my direction. I turned and ran, stumbling every few steps and clenching the gun in my hand like the lifeline it was. Squeezing myself through the gymnasium door, I nearly vomited at the sight of three corpses, strewn about in a horrific fashion. One laid wedged in the door, a look of ultimate fear still plastered on his face. One was curled in an unnatural ball, his spine snapped backward in such a manner that the blood from his back dripped directly onto the top of his head. The last, Deputy Collins, was in no one place in particular. On every surface and in every corner of the gymnasium was a meaty, bloody piece of Deputy Collins.



As I had been for the past countless numbers of hours, I retreated, the images of those officers burnt into my mind forever as I passed. I dove into the locker room, tears streaking down my face. That’s one thing I learned that day; in moments of extreme dread and fear, you can’t help but cry. It’s far different than tears of sadness or pain. It’s indescribable.



Shutting and locking the door behind me, I paced the room, making sure to stay hidden behind the rows of lockers. Again, I was overcome by the horrible smell. Hands on my head, sobbing, I struggled for an answer to all this. So many questions with so few answers swam around in my head, clashing against my skull to create a headache so intense that I thought my head would explode like a balloon.



One of such painful questions was quickly answered.



A swarm of flies drew me to a particular locker, my sense of smell confirming it was the source of the putrid odor. My left hand covering my nose, I reached my right hand out and pushed the small lever keeping the locker closed with my pistol. With a weighty thud, a small, mangled body fell out. His limbs, each bent in multiple directions to create the appearance of joints where there were none, gave him a spider-like appearance. His face, now staring up at the ceiling, was completely flayed.



I couldn’t help but imagine, all in one morbid moment, that he was made to watch his own brutal slaying, denied even the comfort of closing his own eyes.



This was Jonathan Pryce.



A scream came from the hallway, followed by a cry for help. The voice was familiar, one I had heard the evening before, however briefly. It was a young, innocent voice; undeserving of the horrors that now dwelled in this school.



“Emily!” I shouted, suddenly invigorated with courage.



I rushed past the bodies of the officers, this time paying no mind to their morbid fates. Pushing through the gymnasium door, I pointed my pistil quickly toward the figure, now all the way across the hall. I fired two shots, which were followed by multiple quiet clicks of the trigger. The figure was either unharmed or unbothered by the bullets. Either outcome filled me with dread. The thing moved around the corner. It didn’t walk or step, exactly, but moved in a motion I can only describe as gliding. I dropped the gun to the ground and looked to my right at the front entrance of the school.



Sirens sounded from outside. Moving towards the front doors, I looked out and saw police cars covering the street, the occasional ambulance mixed in. My mind told me to run out and seek safety, but I couldn’t. I turned and ran back through the halls, shouting Emily’s name another time.



“Help me!” she yelled again, her voice emanating from the teacher’s lounge.



I ran toward the plea, uncaring of what else was there. Barreling into the lounge, I looked around, hearing the sound of police attempting to break through the now-locked front doors.



“Emily?” I called.



A noise came from the closet. I opened its door and saw Emily, barely visible under my pile of junk.



“Emily, what are you doing here?”



“I- I just walked here from home. I have to come to school extra early or Daddy gets really-”



I scooped her up before she could finish and began running to the front doors.



“Who is the scary man in here?” Emily asked, her tone of voice so heartbreakingly terrified.



“I don’t know, Emily. I don’t know,” I responded, upset that I couldn’t give a more comforting answer.



Approaching the doors, I could feel the prospect of safety so close. Only steps away, I slipped or was pushed, and crashed into the ground. My vision went blurry and my head pounded. Behind me, further into the school, I saw two figures, one short and one tall, going through the door of the gymnasium. In front of me, I saw the front doors of the school finally burst open, and police pouring in.



They dragged me out, kicking and screaming, into the hellish storm outside. I squirmed so powerlessly, but with every ounce of energy in my body. Over and over, I shouted her name. Handcuffs were squeezed over my wrists and I was shoved into a police car.



I never stopped shouting her name.



Only once did I falter when I looked towards the woods behind the school as the car drove away. Through the storm, I swore I could see two figures, one short and one tall, walking deep into the trees.



*Walker became silent for a long moment, his face full of despair, or maybe regret.*



And now I’m here. There’s nothing more to tell.



*Allen Walker’s account stands out to me for two major reasons. Firstly, it is an outstanding example of how the human brain may concoct fantastical stories in response to trauma, especially when relating to one’s own inexcusable actions. When you can’t forgive yourself for something you’ve done, you can either deny it ever happened, or let yourself live in perpetual self-punishment. Some may say that Walker chose the former.*



*Secondly, his account stands out to me because I absolutely believe it. I am certainly not implying that these events truly occurred, but I truly think that Walker believes they did. Throughout our interview, he came across as entirely honest and emotional. I have no formal training in body language analysis or lie detection, but of every monster I have ever spoken to, Walker is by far the most earnest. This troubles me in a way so deep that I cannot describe the feeling.*



*I have decided to stay in Manitou Valley for the indefinite future. During that time, I plan on attending Allen Walker’s trial and interviewing others about these horrible events.*



*Whatever is true, there certainly is a monster here in Manitou, and nothing has scared me more.*
