I had just suffered a tough breakup with my boyfriend. We had been dating for 2 years and I, (18 F), and my friends decided to have a girly beach house weekend to take my mind off him. So there we were, me, Anna, Ruth, Clarabelle (Clara for short) Maya, and Adriana, the tires of our beat up Honda skidding sand on the large black strip of road stretching as far as the eye could see. We had some music playing, and snacks were flying everywhere as people ate and threw food at others. Maya and Ruth were singing obnoxiously loud and laughing. In the back seat me, Anna, Adriana and Clara had our arms around each other as we joined the sing along.

We finally finished the 5 hour drive ( although it felt like 5 minutes) and I was having much more fun than in a while. I didn't even realize how much I cut them off when I was with my boyfriend! We got out all of our sparkly, girly bags and moved inside to set up. We had 6 people and 7 rooms, so we set up and left one empty. The first one on the 2nd floor was empty, and Clara stayed in the second room on the 2nd floor, and Anna, Adriana and Maya stayed on floor 1 while me and Ruth had rooms on the ground floor.

I asked for snack requests and then moved down into the den to get everyone their stuff. That's where I found that horrible list. I was grabbing a stool from the corner and I put it next to the counter so I could reach up to the high cabinet. I pulled out a can of potato chips for Maya. I was about to leave but then I saw a small piece of paper flutter down to the floor. It was crinkly and yellowed and looked like it had been dunked in the sea and left to dry up in the cabinet for years. It also looked like it had...... seen better days. I picked it up and it smelled like old seaweed. I looked at the hastily scribbled on writing on the front that said: RULES FOLLOW FOR SAFETY AT THE BEACH HOUSE

I had a feeling that whoever wrote this out wrote this wasn't making a joke. I unfolded the paper and inside, sure enough, along with some suspicious brick-colored spots, presumably dried bl- Nope. Not going to even think about that. Anyway, inside was the same hasty writing but this time, even more desperate. I shuddered as I read the list.

 

1: DO NOT WATCH ANY SCARY MOVIES AND IF YOU DO, ZERO VOLUME NEVER LISTEN TO IT, AND NEVER LISTEN TO SCREAMS

 

2 DONT WALK THE HALLWAYS FROM 1AM TO 2 AM EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO OR YOU WILL BECOME THE REASON THIS RULE EXISTS

 

3 IF YOU ARE SWIMMING AND SOMETHING TUGS YOUR FOOT, HOLD YOUR BREATH FOR 30 SECONDS AND NEVER SWIM OR RUN

 

4 IF SOMETHING TAPS ON THE WINDOW, LOCK THE FRONT DOOR WITHIN 20 SECONDS OR THE CLOSEST PERSON WILL BE AFFECTED

 

 

5 ALWAYS REMEMBER DONT INVESTIGATE STRANGE THINGS AND NEVER GO TO THE 1ST ROOM ON THE SECOND FLOOR

 

 

And the note just ended. The last word had a huge splatter of something that looked like bl- No. I will not think about blood. DANG IT!!! I decided to keep the note and show it to my friends. I gave them all the snacks they requested and then told them about the note. Clara looked scared but then said, WAIT. Did you prank us, Jade??? No way! I insisted. I wouldn't. But they all laughed and brushed it off and we set off for a day of fun.

At the beach, everyone agreed that for today, no swimming as we were still settling in. I was pretty relieved and we started to put down a cooler and some chairs. Anna set up the volleyball net and the game started off very happy and energetic. We were all enjoying ourselves when we started to get tired. We went up to our rooms to chill for a bit and we were on our own. I took a nap and watched YouTube as well as play some idol games. Afterwards, I got up to check on everyone. (And brought the list, just to make sure) First I checked on Clara, cringing at the only other room on the 2nd floor. She was fast asleep, a book strewn across her face like in a movie. I chuckled and took a photo (for blackmail purposes, and just to humor myself). Then, I went down two floors to check on Ruth, only skipping a floor to use one of the two bathrooms (both on the ground floor). Ruth was also asleep, and I took the time to grab a marker and draw a mustache on her. I laughed, took another photo, and ran upstairs trying to beat the clock which was at 12:35 am, remembering rule 2. I went up and Maya was on a video call with her boyfriend (ouch). She mouthed sorry, then cracked up when I showed her the pics from the doorway. I silently closed the door and glanced at the clock. 12:40. Better hurry.

 I walked into Adrianas room. She was listening to music on her iPod. I checked, and it was Taylor Swift. I was relieved, but it was now 12:45.  Oh no. I had to check on Anna. I went to her room and she was on her iPad. I ran over to her to check, and she was watching something. I pulled out an earbud, and asked her what it was. She replied: I just started watching a zombie movie! Wanna watch with me? I screamed and told her to stop before it ended the credits. She laughed and said: Is this about that list again? It’s just a prank done with bad handwriting and some lipstick. Chill out!

I started crying as she put the earbud back in. She smiled and put a finger to her lips to indicate for me to be quiet as the movie started. I screamed and cried as she started to transform. I heard cracking and twisting as I shut my eyes as tight as I could. When I opened them, Oh God, it was horrible. Her legs were bent in an unnatural way and there were 6 more terrifyingly twisted legs wrapped around each other in ways that made me need 50 years of therapy and some holy water. There were bones peeking out in places that would make your throat break from screaming.

And her arms... it was..... They were coming out of the socket and shoving into her side with such force that they were making holes. Her torso had broken and bulged and scratched and... reformed. And her face....oh her face. I wanted to shut my eyes and wake up from this nightmare. But it was real. Her face was broken her hair ripped and her features red, broken and bulging in a way that screamed: run, horror movie creature! I was begging her to stop as she approached in a weird crawling motion. Like a spider... I thought. It was terrible. But her broken mouth made a sound like crying, but wrong. She made a horror-movie noise that sounded like: I'm sorry Jade. I should have listened and then she just fell. And as a weird comparison, it looked like a fallen angel. I'm so sorry.. I whispered, silently sobbing. The others came in, and when they took one look at us, they pieced it together immediately.

We left our bags and jumped in the car as we tried to drive away. Just as we were about to enter the highway, our car just... Stopped. Like nothing weird. It just... Stopped. We went back, and decided we should at least try to have fun if we couldn't leave. But when I showed them the list and explained nobody seemed to even remember Anna or anything that had happened. They acted as though the list was invisible. When I showed them her room, they said you’re talking crazy, Jade! We never had a friend named Anna! And then, they walked out. I checked for myself, but there was nothing there. It was like Anna never even existed. I grabbed the list and wrote down what happened on a blank spot of the page. Just in case...I forgot my friend too. I was scared when everyone went back to their rooms but I looked at the time 12:59 I jumped in my room and shut the door as the clock ticked one. A pretty girl in a bright purple night gown drifted down the hall. She whispered: I'm trapped. Please help me. I want to go home with my mom and dad. As I cowered away from the protests, they grew more desperate. She banged on my door with her feet and fists as I hid under the bed. She eventually left, and I fell asleep. The next morning things felt too loud. Too wrong. Like someone shook a music box till the music box played distorted noises instead of a song. My heart panged as i heard Ocean Eyes by Billie Eilish playing in the kitchen. That was Anna's favorite...

I let out a gasp as I entered. The pancakes smelled like burning. They were giggling, but it sounded wrong. Someone was watching a kids show, but all the characters looked like they had been shot multiple time in the ribs and they were covered in blood. It was as if everyone had gone insane. I decided to go with them to the beach. Maybe it would clear my head. Outside it smelled like rotten flesh. Maya and Ruth went to swim, taking photos in the water to post on social media. Clara and Adriana lay on tanning mats while I sat in a beach chair. It was FINE until... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!  I heard Adriana scream as Ruth joined in the chorus of screams. SOMETHING GRABBED OUR FEET!!!! Ruth shouted back. HOLD YOUR BREATH FOR 30 SECONDS HURRY!!!!!! I yelled urgently. Then they said quietly so I had to strain my ears: where's Anna? I saw Maya and Clara say it on my left as they got up. Oh no.... they all said. Ruth!!!! Adriana!!!!! NOOOOO!!!!! I as they were dragged under. HELP JADE! screamed Maya.

 What happened? Did you remember Anna and Adriana and Ruth? I asked, voice breaking. What on earth are you talking about?? We mean, she gestured to herself and Clara, can you sunscreen our backs before we get a nasty sunburn? Uhhh ok. I replied. I was starting to think that the only time they would remember was after someone else had gone missing. This time it was weird because nothing had happened, they had just went under the water swiftly, painlessly.

Or maybe I spoke too soon, because right after I had that thought the water started to bubble. The smell of rotten flesh was becoming worse. It started getting humid like being close up with roadkill in a heat wave. And the water was dark red like blood. Oh, not again. It was boiling almost as we caught glimpses of body parts floating above the water and disintegrating in whatever-the-hell-that-water-was-made-of. And them, just as soon as it started, it ended. Only a single eyeball remained floating on the surface of the crystal clear water. It was downright WRONG. I went back and wrote it down underneath Anna's story. Then I went inside with mixed feelings of being tired of this already and wanting to save them all before it was too late. Ughhhh you made us come inside too soon I have a terrible tan, Maya complained. I’m going to get some popcorn choose a movie.

FANTASY!!! Me and Clara screamed. DAMN OK GIRLS I GUESS WE CANT  WATCH  ROMANCE! she screamed from downstairs. Clara giggled. I just stared. The movie started up and it was pretty fun but then: tap. What was that? Maya asked. Clara was the closest to the door.

 LOCK THE DAMN DOOR CLARA!

I was already on my feet.

I ALREADY LOCKED IT! she insisted. Not again I can’t lose you! Tap tap tap! More insistent this time. No no no no Niobe no no no no! The door quietly opened and the shadows seemed to yank a screeching kicking Clara straight out leaving behind a pool of blood and a terrible gurgling noise. Then everything was gone. I peeked out the window and was met with a horrible grinning face. Blood covered skin stretched over bone and shredded in a way that made me not want to know why it was cut. It’s eyes we’re missing as if gouged out. I was hysterical. I was breaking down. Crying, laughing, screaming as I realized that was Clara. And then she was gone. And everyone was gone. Just me and Maya. Watching a fantasy movie. Clara’s perfume still lingering in her spot. I was just… numb.

If I stayed here any longer, I was going to go insane damn it. Well, I needed sleep. I needed out. I jumped in bed with my ugly pajamas. I would have been teased but Anna was gone. Adriana was gone. Clara was gone. Ruth was gone. Soon Maya would go with them. And maybe me too. Then I remembered. MAYA TAKES A SHOWER AT 1:30AM SHE WILL BE TAKEN OMG OMG OMG I HAVE TO HURRY. I called her cell. It rang twice before she picked up.

 I need you to not shower tonight. You can’t go in the hallway please Ruth Clara Anna Adriana they were here! You can’t go with them please Maya!

*Jade I can’t not shower* you need sleep!

I watched through the peephole as she walked down the hallway in her sparkly pink pajamas. No no no no no!!! I whispered as the girl in the hallway grabbed her and Maya screamed before disappearing.

The girl flew off and I felt a pang of sadness for her. Then I looked again and in the hallway was Maya screaming for her friends. I was broken. Alone. I would never see my friends again. Ever. I was just…. DONE. I’m leaving this horrible place. It was 5 am, the cold harsh sun leaping over the horizon like a poisoned cloud. The car felt cold. Unhappy. Unwelcoming. I sat sadly, quietly. Listen to the broken radio spit out tunes as I finally got out. I should have rejoiced. But no. Not until I had them back. I made my way slowly away from the cursed beach house. And everyday, I prick one finger with a needle trying to make a river like the one that took my friends. Like the blood they were covered in. Before I never saw them again.
