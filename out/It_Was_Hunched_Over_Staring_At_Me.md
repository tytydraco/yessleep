So recently I visited my cousin over in Arizona to celebrate their birthday and things felt off.

You see, when I arrived at their house the sun was setting and as I pulled up to the driveway I heard my name called despite being in my car, so I responded. Complete silence, naturally I looked left and right, there was no one so I just brushed it off.

Despite all this I entered the house and got on with the birthday ceremony, all was well until I volunteered myself to wash the dishes, while picking up the scrub daddy I looked outside the kitchen window and saw a set of eyes roaming around the yard on what looked like all fours. I asked my cousin if he had a dog and he laughed as if I told him a joke. What was that?

As night fell my cousin and the rest of his family went to sleep but I stayed up watching the new Despicable Me movie that I just pirated, halfway through the movie I heard my name called once again but this time it sounded angry, this was followed by a scratching sound. I was frightened and curious at the same time, I decided to stay indoors as that was the safest bet. After the movie finished I went to go brush my teeth in the bathroom and the entire room felt cold.

Eventually sunrise came the next day at 5:40AM and I had to go back to Utah for work, I stepped outside and walked towards the driveway, I saw a huge scratch on the side of my car between the drivers door and passenger door. This couldn’t be a prank of some teenager, this looked like it could get the offender jail time, I walked over to the other side of the car to assess any damage there and there was something hunched over next to it. It was white/pale, had no eyes and was pretty tall while hunched over.

I jolted back in reaction and ended up falling over, my vision became blurry and I heard a loud scream followed by footsteps that sounded like they were leaving the property. I woke up from being unconscious and checked the time, 6:40AM. I was more surprised that no one came to check on me, but again it was the morning and everyone was asleep.

I eventually got back to Utah and I got to my apartment and not one hour later I heard a knock on my door, I opened it up to see two missionaries. Both of their faces became pale and shocked in horror as they looked at me. They both ran, that was confusing? As the days passed I kept hearing that exact voice calling out my name and I’ve been having vivid dreams about what happened at my cousin’s house, I’m guessing that whatever that thing was it must’ve attached itself to me in some way.

What now? Am I haunted forever?
