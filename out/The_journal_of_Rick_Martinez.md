September 14th
 My brother and I are heading to our dad’s shabby old cabin. Food has been scarce. We need to catch some game if we want to make it through the winter. Life’s been rough since the Awakening—people have changed, and the places we used to call home are now unrecognizable.
We lost Buck in the beginning. Seeing him like that hardened me. I didn’t have the nerve to do what was necessary, so he suffered until the end.
As the sun rose over the valley hills, we gave Derrel a moment of peace in this world of chaos. It’s been quiet for a few weeks. I don’t like quiet. Those things move in herds.
 I crack open the last can of Bush’s baked beans our father stashed away “just in case.” We savor every bite of that cold sludge. Derrel starts reminiscing, telling stories about when times were simpler—when you could order a T-bone steak on a whim.
But before the words could leave his mouth, a blood-curdling scream pierced the air. It was almost... human.
They're getting better.

 Winter’s already brutal this year. Derrel had a close call with a grizzly protecting its cubs. He’s barely hanging on. I don’t know if I can nurse him back.
I don’t think I can do this alone.

 Merry Christmas.
I never liked the holidays, especially not alone. I’ve been talking to the cross outside more than I should. I know it’s dangerous out there. They pick you off one by one.
I’ve never seen one up close. But if you do... you’ve already sealed your fate.

 I woke up to a faint whisper outside. I strained to hear—it was unlike anything I’d heard before.
Then a voice.
It called out in fear, in terror... but it felt wrong. Manufactured.
I grabbed the only double-barrel we had left. Four shells. That’s all.
My heart was pounding as I approached the door, dread sinking in deeper with every step. When I opened it, I saw something horrifying—something that froze me in place.
I fired the first shot, the buckshot grazing its leg. It shrieked in pain. The other one stared at me—almost as if it understood. As if it were saying, this isn’t over.
The injured one limped away on all fours. The other walked upright, never breaking eye contact as it faded into the treeline.
I sat awake the rest of the night, listening to the hollows and shrieks outside.

 I went out today. I had to.
I don’t go out much anymore—not since what happened. I think it’s waiting for me. Every night, I wake up to scratching… like it’s playing with me.
I can’t take it anymore. I’m going out. I’ll get whatever I can find.
It’s them or me.
This is my final stand.
Rick Martinez, signing out.

 I never thought I’d be doing this again. Not that anyone’s ever going to read this.
I guess this is more for my sanity. Though we both know that’s slipping.
It’s getting harder and harder to write these. This is the only socializing I have left.
I’ve been talking to myself... and over time, someone started talking back.

 Hello to whoever finds this.
This will probably be one of my last entries. My health has taken a toll. I haven’t taken my meds since all this started. The voices are constant—overwhelming.
It’s been two years since I’ve spoken to another human. I don’t even know if I remember how.
My world is crumbling.
Soon, I might join Derrel.

December 2nd
 One shell left.
I won’t survive another winter. I can’t rely on luck anymore.
It’s getting colder every night. The only thing keeping me warm is the little bit of Jack I found in an old supermarket.
It makes me think about better times. Drinks with friends. Laughter. Warm meals.
But these aren’t the good ol’ days.
And it’s time.
As I walk to the fireplace one last time, I remember the stories told around it... the meals shared.
I hesitate. Then—

Nothing.
A dud.
That doesn’t fix this. It makes it worse.
No way out.
Except one.
Sincerely,
 Rick Martinez
