At 22, I’ve barely scraped through college with a degree I never wanted. Engineering—a path chosen under the heavy shadow of my father’s expectations, not out of any passion of my own. I realised in my first year that this wasn’t for me, but I stubbornly pushed through, determined to finish what I had started. Now, that degree feels more like a shackle than an achievement. Still uncertain about my future, I’ve decided to continue with my part-time job at McDonald’s for a year to figure out what to do with my life.

I usually work the night shift, from 5 PM to 1:30 AM, starting in the midst of the evening rush between 5 and 7 PM, which can be tough. During these hours, I typically go on autopilot, trying not to think about the stifling heat as I scrape the grill clean, sweating in the greasy air. After the rush, the orders die down, leaving just me and Tristan, my coworker, in the kitchen.

Tristan is the complete opposite of me—very extroverted and constantly chatting with the other coworkers in the front. His outgoing nature often leaves him distracted, so I usually end up taking over his tasks, which I don’t really mind since it makes the time go faster. This includes putting the hamburger buns in the oven and preparing the orders by placing the buns in the boxes, ready for me to dress the burgers.

We work in kitchen line 1, which faces kitchen line 2. The main difference is that line 1 has the grill, and line 2 houses the floor deep fryer. After 7 PM, kitchen 2 closes since there aren’t many orders, and everyone’s workload lightens. However, there still needs to be someone managing the deep frying, and recently, that task fell to a new girl who started three weeks ago. I’ve only seen her on two shifts before, for just an hour each, because she was still in training and her shift had to be earlier. Now that she’s passed, she can work independently, and tonight marks her first night shift.

After the rush had finished, and most coworkers had finished their shifts, it was just me, Tristan, and the new girl in the kitchen. Since we hadn’t received an order for a while, Tristan was, as usual, chatting in the front with a coworker, which left just me and the new girl in the kitchen. Since I had finished checking the dates of the ingredients that needed to be replaced within a few hours and had cleaned the workspaces and refilled all the burger boxes, I was left with really nothing to do besides preparing the few orders I’d received. The new girl was quiet, which gave me this uncomfortable feeling since you barely noticed her presence. So, I decided to introduce myself, which I would later regret.

“Hey,” I said, trying to sound friendly despite my introverted nature. “I don’t think we’ve properly met yet. I’m Ryan.”

She looked up slowly, her eyes blank and distant. “Hi, I’m Amy,” she replied in a whisper.

“So, how do you like your new job?” I asked, raising my voice a bit over the faint radio music and the periodic beeps from the kitchen equipment.

She glanced around, seemingly attuned to the noises that filled the space. “It’s… different,” she murmured, almost as if puzzled by the question.

“What made you decide to work here?” I tried again, hoping for a bit more insight.

“The noise,” she said softly, a strange smile flickering. “It drowns things out.”

“Ah, okay,” I replied, a little thrown off. “Not much of a talker, huh?”

She shook her head slightly, her gaze drifting back to her tasks. “Not much to say,” she breathed out.

“Got it. Well, good luck,” I said, turning back to my grill, the unease settling heavier around me.

As the shift went on, I kept thinking about the conversation I had earlier with Amy—about the noise. Since she mentioned it, I couldn't really focus anymore. Now, all I could think about were those annoying beeps from the kitchen and the repetitive radio songs that were driving me crazy. It was as if her words had planted a seed of distraction in my mind, growing louder with each passing moment. 


In an attempt to quell my growing anxiety, I decided to take my 7-minute smoke break. I made my way to the designated smoking area—a neglected corner of the restaurant where the trash containers find place and were i can sit on the broken yard furniture. Settling into one of the cheap, worn-out chairs, I lit up a cigarette, intending to find a moment of peace amidst the chaos of the night.

However, what was meant to be a brief respite turned into a prolonged 15-minute hiatus. The calm of the night air and the rhythmic motion of smoking seemed to soothe my frazzled nerves, offering a fleeting sense of tranquility that I desperately needed.

Reluctantly, I extinguished my cigarette and rose to my feet, ready to return to the chaos of the kitchen. As I approached the entrance, the dim light above the door cast eerie shadows, obscuring the identity of the figure standing in the darkness beyond.

I could barely make out the silhouette of a person, their features shrouded in shadow as they disposed of a trash bag filled with leftover food scraps. It must have been Amy, since i thrown away the trash back at mine kitchen line when i was on my way for the smoke break.

As I stepped closer, I called out to her, my voice echoing in the quiet darkness. She turned towards me, her face illuminated by the flickering light from above. What I saw sent a shiver down my spine—a blank expression devoid of any emotion, her eyes vacant and empty.

For a moment, time seemed to stand still as we locked eyes, the silence punctuated only by the faint hum of the fluorescent light. I repeated my question, my voice tinged with concern, but she offered no response, her gaze fixed on some unseen horizon.

Suddenly, she turned away, disappearing into the depths of the restaurant without a word. Bewildered by her strange behaviour, I followed after her, tossing the trash bag into the bin before setting off in search of Amy.

To my astonishment, I found her back at her workstation, as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred. Puzzled and unnerved, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was amiss—that beneath her composed exterior lurked a darkness I couldn’t begin to comprehend.

After that unsettling encounter, I found myself retreating back to my workplace in silence, my mind racing with questions and unease. I couldn’t shake off the eerie feeling that lingered in the air, haunting me as I went about my duties for the remainder of the shift.

As the hours dragged on, my unease only grew, a knot tightening in my stomach with each passing moment. Yet, despite my growing sense of dread, nothing else out of the ordinary occurred.

Finally, as the shift came to a close and the rest of the crew gathered to await the manager’s final tasks to close the restaurant for the night, a sense of relief washed over me.

After the manager finished up and the rest of the crew drove off, Tristan and I remained behind, seeking solace in the stillness of the night. Stepping outside, I reached for my pack of cigarettes and lit one up, the soft glow contrasting against the bright lights of the parking lot.

Tristan also lit a cigarette, the smoke curling upwards as we stood side by side. I explained the encounter with Amy earlier, downplaying it a bit to not seem too weird.

Tristan chuckled lightly, taking a drag from his cigarette. "Huh, Amy's a bit of an enigma, isn't she?" he remarked, his tone light. "Quiet, mysterious type. Probably just lost in her thoughts."

I nodded in agreement, relieved by Tristan's easygoing response. "Yeah, she does seem a bit reserved," I replied, attempting to shake off the lingering unease.

But then the manager, who had been finishing up closing, overheard our conversation and approached us. “What’s this about Amy?” she asked, curiosity evident in her voice.

I explained the strange encounter with Amy during my smoke break, feeling a chill run down my spine as I recounted the details. The manager furrowed her brow, clearly concerned by what she was hearing.

“Let’s check the security footage,” she suggested, leading us back inside the restaurant. We gathered around the monitor as she scrolled through the recordings, searching for any sign of Amy leaving her station.

But to our shock, there was nothing. Amy had remained at her workstation the entire time, never once venturing towards the smoking area. The realisation sent a shiver down my spine, my mind reeling with the implications.

As we returned to the parking lot, the sense of unease that had plagued me all night intensified.

As I drove home that night, I made a silent vow to myself—I would never set foot in that restaurant again, haunted by the memory of Amy and the mysteries that lurked within its walls.
