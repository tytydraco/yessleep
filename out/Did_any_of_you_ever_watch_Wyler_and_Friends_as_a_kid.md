For those of you who don’t know, Wyler and Friends was a show about an anthropomorphic dog, and his friends. 
There was Chucky the Sock Puppet, Annie the Doll, Penny the Wallet, and Clover the Clown. 

It wasn’t animated, it was just people in foam costumes. They went on basic adventures, with the help of a magical door that took them to wherever they wanted to go. Does this jog anyones memory?

Now, here’s the weird part. I was watching one of my tapes (it was the 90’s.) of the show. It was episode 22, at midnight.
When Wyler said, “Hey, kid! Wanna join us in our wacky adventures?” It looked as though a paw was sticking through my screen. I blinked, and it was gone. The tape was missing.

At school, nobody who had the tape had ever saw something like that. I told it to my best friend, Bailey. He was the only person who believed me. “I’ll watch my copy of that episode.”

The next day, I was waiting for him to show up to class. He didn’t. It was revealed that he had died of a heart attack during the night. 

The next few days, I was extremely depressed. My best friend was gone. I was just a kid, so I had no clue how to deal with grief. Instead of talking to somebody about it, I watched as much TV as possible to keep my mind off it.

That Saturday, there was a new episode of Wyler and Friends. Only, instead of them going in the magical door, something came out.

It was a new character, named Blops the Dragon. He even sounded like Bailey. He became my new favorite character. Everything he did reminded me of him.

Soon, there was a live recording of the show near my town. My mother dropped me off to watch it. I wish I hadn’t. I went to go to the bathroom, and when I came back, everybody in the audience was dead. There was about a hundred new characters on the show. I naively thought they were unconscious and tried to wake them. 

Wyler heard me and came off stage. “Hey, buddy! Come here! I got something for you, you lucky duck!” He was holding a knife and charged at me. I started to run. I threw something at him, and the detachable head came off…

Only there wasn’t a human under there. It was just bone and foam. “Uh-oh! You gave me a boo-boo!” He put the head back on.

While he was doing that, I ran away, straight home. Nobody believed me about what happened. They said the dead there died due to the lights malfunctioning and flashing extremely fast, causing everybody to have seizures.

I was told this so much, I believed it myself. I believed it was all a dream. Not anymore.

It’s been a few decades. I still think about it. I think about their bodies. I think about Wyler’s eerie chuckle and voice.

When my parents died, I got the house and everything in it.

Including the TV and my old tapes. I burnt those tapes with gasoline and some matches. I was put at ease. I have a wife now. I left her in the living room where that old TV is. It was to be sold the next day.
When I came back, she was dead. I called the cops. I was accused of poisoning her or something along those lines, until the autopsy revealed it was a heart attack.

I destroyed that TV. Now, thinking back to that day, I knew now it wasn’t a dream. 

Every night since my wife died, I hear from my walls… “Hey, pal! Wanna play with your friend Wyler?”
