When i was a twelve year old there was a website i spent a lot of time on, it was for a technology company and had a lot of cool toys and games you could play with, these days i see a corporate show off but 10 years ago if something was fun, it was fun, the majority of them were expiremental features that never made it into their products, but i was a kid who enjoyed clicking around websites in general, each website felt like a maze with different pieces of knowledge as it's treasure.

Yes i also wasted lots of time on wikipedia, i even went through a phase of hacking security cameras, the internet and outside world in general to twelve year old me was as mysterious and exciting as a fresh case would be to the detective.

Ten years and adulthood came faster then i could ever have imagined, my youth beat in a race of time and that last tinge of intrique that always marks childhood, yet i find it hard to reconnect to those days, that hard drive took a good knock when i was 15, it never worked again.

But a couple weeks while feeling nostalgic and after looking for relics in the junk drawer of this desk i'd had for over 10 years, i suddenly remembered something.

The Internet Archive! sure websites go down or get changed, but i could re-experience that website i wasted time on so many years ago, one day when i was twelve i logged off that website for the last time, i never knew the second time was going to be now.

Without hesitation i entered the URL and clicked back 10 years, November 2014, i hit enter and was prepared to experience the most my generation would ever consider to be a form of time travel.

The website loaded up fine, a perfect mirror image of what was, this website had a UI of blocks or tiles, like the then latest version of windows or wall street, it was in the 'int' thing back then.

It was these tiles that my eyes were scanning, they linked to different pages, and companies being companies, they had a page dedicated to their employees testimonies, this block had a picture with it, and that picture was of me.

No, not the twelve year old me who wore his black carhartt overalls without a shirt with a blazer layered on top and had a fake gold dogtags around his neck.

It was me now.

  
More specifically a picture i didn't recognize, but the person in it looked exactly like me, i couldn't work out where it was taken, it seemed to have been taken with a professional camera, the kind that blurs the background.

  
I did what anyone probably would have done, i clicked it, the page loaded slowly, one by one the testimonials of employees and volunteers came up, but the me? i clicked back to the home page, my picture was gone, in it's place was the first one on the page that tile linked to.

  
I considered it may have been in my head, nostalgia can do some funny stuff, i scrutinized the picture, if i squinted then maybe it does look like me, you know those corner of the eye moments when you think something is something entirely else? sometimes it's freaky, but other times it's not, it's merely a fact of life, we work on patterns more then you think.

  
But i couldn't shake it, i swear the image was different only a minute ago, i refreshed the page expecting to see it, but no matter how many times i refreshed, it never came back, of course such a picture should be impossible, i quickly if the archive being hacked a while ago was to do with it, but why would it be a picture of me? on this one site in a sea of millions? 

  
The archive wasn't complete enough for me to dig deeper, though i managed to dig up every image used, my one wasn't there, perhaps it was just in my mind or a computer glitch, after all, this shouldn't be possible, do you really think i saw myself now ten years ago? i went as far as investigating multiple archives and none had the picture i saw, had i been using a laptop i would have slammed it shut, but i just closed the tab, and went on reddit.

  
You know in the top right corner of reddits new horrid desktop UI? there's a messages icon, the orange dot always told me i had 5 messages, pig butchers trying to make me dump all my money into some crypto site no ones ever heard of, people advertising their discord servers or telling me how they can help me with something, i remember when you bought spam off the shelf, not randomly found it in your inbox.

  
6 messages, i focused on the icon, hovering my mouse over it, i thought it said 5 a minute ago? had a new one came in? i clicked it, expecting to read about how i can become a millionaire for the millionth time.

  
A day old account with no karma, the username a random series of letters and numbers, i scrolled down to read the message.

  
'Hello, we've been looking for you' it read, below it was a picture, not that picture but it was of me when i was 12, taken at the mall, i was standing next to a set of doors near the cafeteria where i used to meet up with my friends, i appreciate the random snippit of my former years, but at the same time a random picture of my younger self taken in a public place is just creepy.

  
After i snapped out of that nostalgia trance i messaged the person, asking them who they were and where they found the photo.

  
'You still like to explore?' they asked

  
'Who are you and are you affiliated with \[this company\]' i asked

  
'Used to be, but i need your services, do you still hack or urbex?'

  
Urbex? i thought, i'd never urbexed other then the time i sneaked through the staff only area of the mall.

  
I tried telling them they had the wrong person, but they insisted they hadn't, i eventually caved in and told them everything.

  
'Oh, that? this picture? yea i did that' they told me

  
All i could reply was 'the hell is going on?' 

  
'Meet me at the mall tomorrow, 2:35'

  
If i was a woman i would have noped out but i was a man whose had their fair share of.. interesting situations, i decided i could get out if the need arose.

  
The next day i took with me a fully charged burner phone and a pen, my intention was to use it for self defense if i had to.

  
I waited at the same spot i would wait at all those years ago, the mall long since having it's layout changed til the point it was almost unrecognizable, the cafeteria long gone.

  
Not long after 2:30 i saw a man waving at me, he walked closer and beckoned me to sit at a bench, he carried a messenger bag and wore techy clothes.

  
The first thing he asked was 'are you the one from reddit?' 

  
To which i said yes, and what on earth was going on, with the pictures, the impossible time travel, the link with the website, and who he was.

  
'Are you feeling satisfied with life?' he said, changing the subject

  
'I guess i'm neutral' i said



'I can make your life interesting again, like all those years ago' he said

  
'What do you want me to do?' i asked

  
'Sorry if the attention grab was a bit... jarring, and who we are isn't that important, we just wanted you to know what we need you to do' he said

  
He casually reached in his bag and pulled something out, it was a pair of well worn fake gold dogtags.

  
'What.. the?' i said in surprise, i lost those in july 2016 when a school bully jumped me, nearly made off with my iPhone 6 too but he threw back when i told him i was going to track him down with it.

  
I never got the dogtags back, i technically wasn't supposed to have them in the first place, my parents told me i was too young to have such a thing, me and a friend ended up sneakily buying them from a costume shop when we realized we were too poor to afford the silver ones from the jewellers ('come on man it's just a dangly piece of metal!'), i kept them hidden for over a year before i lost them.

  
'He's no more' the person said

  
'What you killed that guy who robbed me?' i asked

  
'Nope, V8 mustang around a tree, this was found near the crash' he explained

  
'Anyways, do you remember when you used to play games on the xbox? all those hours spent looking for the jetpack? or the megalodon? i want you to do something like that in real life' he explained further

  
'Back then i was the administrator of that website and i saw you visiting every now and then, i kind of... followed you around the internet and realized you had potential, do you remember that camera in the warehouse?' he said

  
I had a vague memory of hacking a camera one morning and finding it pretty boring because it was one that couldn't look around.

  
'Well, it belonged to a military contractor, whoops' he said

  
'But, i'm not here to arrest you or something, here's the deal, many years ago i heard rumours of something called cyberentities, they're like ghosts but instead of the real world, they cause havoc in the computers and the internet, some can manifest in the real world though, they say they evolved from gremlins, i need you to capture a cyberentity, in exchange i'll get that hard drive fixed for you and i tell you, this will bring you back to the good old days' he explained

  
'What will i be doing to capture this cyberghost?' i asked

  
'Wardriving, just go round with a laptop recording all Wi-Fi communications and bring it back to me on a thumbdrive, specifically target abandoned office buildings and other places where computers were' he explained

  
'Because we think cyberentities could be a problem if not dealt with, you know what happened last night? that was cyberentities, they infiltrated the archive a while back, they weren't hacked, it was a cover up' he whispered

  
'Imagine if you could save the world and the internet' he continued

  
'Fine, i'm down' i said

  
It lingered in the back of my mind that this could be something illegal, contract hacking, corporate espionage, were cyberentities even a real thing? before i left he gave me the dogtags, i still wondered about the link with the bully that robbed me all them years ago.

  
I did the job for a few weeks, collecting lots of data i didn't understand, at the end of the month i met up with him and handed over the thumbdrive, he later told me the data had traces of cyberentities and that it would help research into these things, he payed to recover that hard drive, and i soon became a cyberentity hunter.

  
The only problem is, werid things keep happening, computer crashes, werid files appearing on my computer, messages that pop up, i fully believe in cyberentities now and i believe i'm being stalked by one, even before i found out what was going on, but this deep dive into the other realm has made me feel like i did 10 years ago now.
