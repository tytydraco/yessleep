It's ten minutes to midnight on a Thursday night. I'm up past my usual bedtime by a good three hours. It's funny to me that, in my 20s, I had always thought bedtimes were only for children abiding the house rules of their parents and the meek who couldn't handle a little roughness in their life. But now, at age 32, bedtime was sacred. I can barely get a full night of sleep even when I don't have anything to get up for the next day; most nights my body wakes itself up to body cramps in less than 6 hours and I can't get back to sleep.

But tomorrow was Friday, the last day of the work week. It was a wasted day anyways, might as well suffer through it, right? Well, it was hard to fall asleep anyways with the severe thunderstorm keeping me up. That's another thing that's funny, thunderstorms used to *help* me fall sleep.

One more thing that's been keeping me up is, well, just a few days ago I had tossed out my last bit of weed. I had wanted to quit for months but, when I got high at my uncle's funeral, I knew I had lost all sense of self control and tossed it out mindlessly in anger. I told myself I would not dig it out of my trash can. Just two more days until trash day, then it'll be taken, then I won't have to worry about it anymore! I live in an illegal state, there's no incentive to travel 2 hours to buy a new grinder, a new pipe, a new bag of bud. None of it! I'm done for good. All I need to do is resist the urge to go out there and bring it back in.

  
*That's* what was keeping me up, I realized. Not only that I always relied on the THC to do its thing and put me to sleep, but just the desire itself to inhale that earthy tasting smoke, let it fill my lungs, and bring my thoughts at ease.

  


The lightning lit up the room through my window, a large crackling sound following it not a half second later. I literally jumped in my bed. *Damn, that one was close!*

The odd thing was, that light didn't go away. At least not fully. I raised my head up and looked at the window above my head, covered by white blinds. There was, in fact, a light. But, of course, it wasn't lightning. It was... my porch light. *My porch light? That's odd.* That thing is motion activated, it hardly ever works. I have to damn near wave my arms on my way to the door in order to get it to turn on for me.

This is the backyard I'm talking about too, there's a gravel alleyway that cuts by but it's rarely ever driven upon since my neighbors are old retirees who never leave their house. Let alone at night time! Besides, I didn't hear a car go by. And, due to how insensitive the light is, it certainly wasn't some leaf blowing by or even the rain. Why would it suddenly turn on now after a lightning strike?

  
I'm not a paranoid person at all. After living on my own for nine years now, I've become a lot less skittish. I can walk into my dark, unfinished basement in the middle of the night no problem. I've even done it before.

So, no, I did not believe there was something outside my window that would frighten me. I didn't think there was someone out there sliding around my house, trying to find a window to break into, or something out of the ordinary like that. This is a small, crime-free neighborhood! *Highly unlikely*. 

I lifted the blinds with my finger tips and jumped in shock. My heart was suddenly booming heavier than the thunderstorm outside. **There's somebody out there. I can see their silhouette.** I couldn't make out who it was, if it was a man or a woman. All i could tell was that they were fairly tall, they were wearing a hood, and they were digging-no-*ravaging* through my trash can. They were violent about it. Throwing things out from the bag out onto my driveway. Digging, and digging, they were desperate.

For a moment I just sat there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do. I pondered if I should call the cops, if I should confront them myself, or just let them be. If the automatic porch light didn't scare them off, I sure as hell don't think they would be too concerned if I saw them.

Oh, but my cell phone had no signal. *What the fuck??* That lightning strike, that big ass lightning strike from a couple minutes ago, it must've struck the telephone tower!

I tossed my phone onto the bed and decided I'd handle this myself. What kind of homeowner would I be if I couldn't fend it myself, right?

I felt every bit of that confidence until I actually stepped out of bed. And as I went down my hall and approached my back door, I felt less and less of that confidence and more terrified of this mysterious person outside.

The thumps of them rummaging through my trash can outside became more audible, as did their grunts and *talking?* What they were saying, I couldn't make it out, but in between their grunts and groans, they were certainly saying something.

A flash of lightning lit up the entire house, the thunder almost as loud as the last time. I literally fell on my floor in fear. I rubbed my head, in disbelief of how terrified I was. It almost felt as if the world around me was spinning. My heart was beating on my rib cage like a rabid animal trying to get out.

Finally I approached the door, unlocked it, and, as soon as I opened it... there. I was maybe two yards away from the hooded figure, still violently digging through my trash can. I could finally make out the man's deep, disgruntled voice repeating over and over, in an almost dreamlike and unrealistic way, "Where is it? Where it is? Where is it?"

I poked my head out of the doorway and didn't dare take a step outside.

"Hey! Who are you?"

The man looked up at me, and for the first time I saw his face in my porch light. It was *my* face. It was *me.* I didn't blink for a whole minute, staring wide eyed and mouth gaped, and in this moment I was **truly** paralyzed. I would've certainly collapsed if it wasn't for the heavy rain slapping me in the face keeping my alert.

How could this be?

"Who are *you*?" the man responded. He grinned. It was *my* grin. He started to laugh. It was me, laughing at myself. "Who are ***you***?"

And me? I started to laugh too.
