I didn’t kill Elise.

Yes, she died in my apartment.

Yes, I was by her side as her heart turned cold.

But God, no - I didn’t kill her.

It *may* look like we were alone, like no one broke in, but it’s a cruel trick. My fingerprints *may* be the only ones that were found on her body, but they didn’t need to lift a single finger to bleed her out.

So, I implore you - same as I’ve implored countless others - don’t write me off because it’s easy. Don’t send me upriver for the rest of my life because it’s convenient. 

Read what I have to say. Then, consider the blood.

Because the truth is in the blood.

Both mine *and* hers.

\- - - - - 

*That night, I heard her knocking at seven on the dot…*

I sit down the silverware I’d been unpacking, wipe a thick film of sweat from my forehead with the collar of my already drenched T-shirt, and walk to answer it. I must have been wearing my surprise like a pair of oversized novelty glasses, because the first thing out of her lips when she sees me is: 

*“You forgot about movie night, didn’t you?”*

I consider fibbing, but think better of it.

*“Sure did.”* 

Bowing as if in the presence of royalty, I hold the door open for her, gesturing inside my war zone of an apartment. A wolfish smirk creeps across her lips. She walks in, gives me a good-natured pat on the head, and tosses a family-sized bag of white cheddar popcorn onto my black leather sofa. A waft of perfume-soaked air whispers to me as she passes by; it smells of citrus and sea spray.

*“You’re a fortunate man, Mateo.”*

I nod. As the door’s deadbolt clicks into the lock, I find myself disagreeing with her. I've never felt like I've had much luck at all. I keep the sentiment internal.

She smells too nice to argue.

As we have sex, the wrathful Florida sun mercifully sets under the horizon, though that did little to cool us and the apartment, even after we were done.

Earlier that week, I’d begun moving into the townhome’s lower level, and - just my luck - the unit’s air conditioning wouldn’t turn on. I wasn’t entirely shocked. The row of newly constructed houses on the isolated strip of land looked like a rush job. Some were still only half-built, for God’s sake.

Far as I could tell, I was the only person living there, too.

There wasn’t a great alternative for cooling the apartment. Mitigating the boiling summer heat with dollar store plug-in fans, as the landlord had so graciously suggested before hanging up on me, was a *very* funny joke. 

Wasn’t keen on keeping the windows open either. 

Behind the house, a two-minute walk down a steep, overgrown hill, sequestered behind a rusty fence, there’s an abandoned reservoir. It’s the literal definition of a cesspool. A tub the size of a battleship filled to the brim with stagnant water, which of course meant it was a breeding ground for insects. The one time I cracked a window, a downright biblical swarm laid siege to my apartment within the hour. 

To keep out pests, I learned I had to maintain a tight perimeter.

I pull some fresh clothes from an open box in my bedroom. When I return, I apologize profusely for the stuffiness. Elise smiles. Dimples crest up her cheek like a stone skipping across the surface of a lake. She dismisses the apology with a wave of the hand, never one to pollute a quiet moment by dwelling on the unchangeable.

I loved that about her.

A few minutes later, we finally settle onto the couch. She opens the bag of popcorn. I pop on a movie. 

Whether out of grief, or longing, or some misplaced sense of responsibility for what happened, I replay the events of that night in my head every day, on an endless loop, over and over again until I start to feel physically sick. 

Every window was shut. The door was locked. I’m sure of it.

I have to be sure of it.

\- - - - - 

We’re reclining next to each other on the couch. It’s too hot to cuddle, but we’re still holding hands. Our feet are propped up on the coffee table.

It’s not perfect, but it’s damn close.

Exhaustion sets in. The move has been tiring. I’m fading in and out of sleep. The pearly light of the TV glitters against my tired eyes. All of a sudden, my body feels simultaneously hot and icy; a halfway point between being feverish and being drunk. 

I don’t mind the feeling. It’s not unpleasant; it’s just strange.

There’s this *whooshing* sound. It’s right next to my ear, but I can’t place what’s making it. The sound reminds of my baby sister using her asthma inhaler - sharp, breathy gulps - but it’s much, much quieter, barely audible.

My head leans back. We haven’t touched the remote for hours, so the TV clicks itself off.

I drift through a long, dreamless sleep. A cozy sort of paralysis.

Slivers of golden light needle my closed eyelids.

It’s morning. I start to stir.

I feel her hand before I see her. Woozy, vision focusing, I sort of think I’m feeling the couch: a palmful of cold, stiff leather.

But there are fingernails.

I turn to look at Elise.

Inches away, a pair of soulless, moon-tinted eyes stare back at me. Wilted skin wraps tightly around her skull. Makes the angles of her cheekbones look like two trapped elbows desperately trying to break free. Her craggy, shriveled lips are slightly pursed. There’s a slit across the side of her neck. Its pale edges are serrated and dainty: death-colored petals of a carnation blooming along the bank of the River Styx.

I stare back at her and wait patiently for this macabre dream to end.

My body is in the moment, reactive: heart galloping, breathing shallow, sweat torrential. My mind is anywhere *but* the moment: numb, emotionless, and nearly blank, save for one question:

*Where did all her blood go?*

It’s clearly not in her. It’s not on her, not even around the slit in her neck. I scan my apartment - the couch, the floor, the walls - it's all spotless. So, where the hell else could it be?

I review that damning peculiarity until, finally, my mind catches up.

This is no dream.

Then, the brain-splitting panic sets in.

I don’t have dreamless nights anymore. 

Now, every night, I dream of a ghost-white, bloodless Elise, lips pursed, perpetually about to speak.

But I always wake up before I hear what she wants to say.

\- - - - - 

My mind catalogued the day that followed into short, fragmented memories. A stack of blurry polaroids shuffled out of chronological order, but the story they tell always ends at the police station.

I’m sitting at a wobbly steel table across from Detective Frank. He’s quickly proven himself to be a real bastard, so when he demands that I address him by his last name, I make sure to call him Frank.

He has a small head on a narrow neck leading down to a monstrous, pulpy gut. His body is shaped like a tube sock stuffed with ground beef being held in the air, fabric sagging into a mushy ball as gravity fights to claim the meat. Either Frank or the interrogation room stinks of piss. No reason it couldn’t be both, I think.

He insists on asking me the same three questions:

*“Why’d ya kill her?”*

*“Where’d ya hide the knife?”*

and

*“Do you really see y’self gettin’ away with this?”*

By the time I’m being berated by Frank, I’m done earnestly pleading my innocence. Initially, I’d been appealing my case, saying things to dead-eyed police officers like: 

*“Why would I call it in if I was the one who hurt her?”*

or

*“I loved Elise.”*

or even

*“There should have been so much blood - where was all her blood?”*

No one believes me, though. No one has even *pretended* to believe me to save face. In a bitter, painful way, I’m not entirely surprised: a white girl was found dead in my apartment. Even if the mechanics of her death beggar belief, it doesn’t matter - I’ve been convicted by circumstance. Might as well have put a shotgun to her head in the middle of Times Square and pulled the trigger.

Eventually, Frank gets bored and starts to play dirty.

*“Would you say you have a history of violent behavior, Mateo?”* He doesn’t smile, but there’s an impish lilt in his voice. Frank is pleased because he knows it’s a trick question.

*“I didn’t hurt Elise.”* I mutter, bleary eyes fixed on a small crack in the table.

There’s a pause. My heart thumps indecipherable code against the back of my throat. All of a sudden, he shoots up from his chair like a puppet sprung from a jack-in-the-box and repeats the question with righteous zeal.

*“Would you say you have a history of violent behavior -* ***yes*** *or* ***no****?”*

Still, I don’t respond. I have no winning answer.

*“If you asked me…”* he starts, now smiling, *“…I’d say yes. Nearly blindin’ a poor young man with a broken beer bottle sounds pretty violent.”*

He wants me to bite, but I stay silent, gaze fixed on the crack in the table, dread bloating in my gut as I imagine all the ways it could have gotten there.

There’s a knock. 

I look up long enough to catch Frank’s dismay. His jaw is clenched tight enough to chip a tooth. He’s staring daggers at the steel door, but the person on the other side doesn’t wait for him to become civil; she enters.

Surprisingly, I recognize her. I’ve seen her interviewed on the news plenty, usually on the steps of the courthouse.

The woman is tall and slender. She has brittle, ancient-looking gray hair, but her porcelain skin is smooth, youthful, and confusingly wrinkleless. Her brown eyes are hard as stone. Her expression betrays confidence. The clunky, navy-colored vest strapped over her well-pressed Italian suit is the only piece of her that lacks poise, but the item is clearly one of necessity, not of choice. It’s gently vibrating against her chest. Plastic tubing connects the vest to a lunchbox-shaped machine resting atop a rolling metal cart behind her. A young man with tense, overly-slicked hair is standing beside the cart. I assume correctly that he’s an underling who’s been assigned the inglorious task of driving it. 

Her name is Danica. She’s a hotshot lawyer with an undisclosed lung disease - hence the vest. It vibrates to break up mucus or something. I have no idea what she’s doing in my interrogation room.

I didn’t call her, and whatever she costs, I certainly couldn’t afford her.

*“Same shit, different day - isn't that right, Frank?”* she booms.

He straightens his spine and sputters a few embarrassing half-words, none of which are worth mentioning.

*“Has this man even been to the hospital yet, Frank? I mean, for the love of God, he’s clearly injured.”*

She points a long, unpolished finger at my neck. I tilt my chin down to look to where she’s gesturing. To my profound bewilderment, she’s right: if I really crane my eyes, I can see the jagged corner of a cut peeking out from under my shirt collar. There’s a splotch of dried blood the size of a quarter next to the lip of it. I lift my hand and run a fingertip over the edges, feeling the laceration snake over my shoulder.

The area around the cut is swollen - absolutely ripe with trapped fluid - but it doesn’t hurt. Even when I press a trembling fingertip into the slit, feeling it plunge beneath my skin, so deep that I can appreciate the hot, spongy muscle lying at the bottom, all I sense is a dull pressure. Despite being open, the wound is dry. The sticky moisture of blood is completely absent. It's like the entire thing has been both anesthetized and clotted over.

How is *any* of that possible?

Before I can get too wrapped up in the question, Danica motions for me to follow her. I do as I’m instructed. I can feel Frank’s eyes crawling over my body as the door slams shut.

The hallway is buzzing with activity. My eyes squint against the phosphorescent bulbs overhead, which are blinding compared to the dim light of the interrogation room. The lawyer looms motionless in front of me, statuesque, her mechanical vest quietly pulsing.

*“I’ll be taking your case pro bono - do you understand what that means?”*

I nod slowly, though I’m not confused by the legalese; I’m confused why she’s representing me free of charge in the first place.

*“Great.”* She snaps her fingers. Her intern - an overeager twenty-something I’d later find out is named Tim - hands me her card.

*“First and foremost, get that cut checked out at the ER. Tim will call you tomorrow to set up a meeting. Do you have anywhere else to stay other than your apartment?”*

I do, but I lie.

*“No.”*

Her gaze narrows. She looks disappointed. Without another word, Danica turns and walks away.

I watch as she strides down the corridor, weaving herself through the crowd, nimble and elegant, never losing her pace.

All the while, Tim and her artificial tail struggle to keep up.

\- - - - - 

I sleep through most of the wait at the emergency room. 

I’m nudged awake by a nurse with a kind voice. I sit up straight, grimacing as I stretch. My neck is stiff. It aches from the awkward rest, body curled into a chair, head draped over its cushioned handle. In comparison, the deep, muscle-exposing gash in my shoulder still feels fine. No pain at all, and it’s barely bleeding. A few drops here and there. Nothing more.

I’m led by the nurse into an exam room that smells of days-old coffee and fresh bile. As I lower myself onto a hospital bed, a gruff physician with meteor-sized bags under his eyes stomps in after her. He inspects the wound with the tenderness of an MMA fighter, yanking and pulling the edges, out then in, lips open then closed, like he’s pretending to make it speak. I’m glad I can hardly feel it.

*“How the hell did you get cut like this?”* he barks into my ear.

I fabricate a story. Something about a construction accident. He grunts.

He draws a few blood tests to confirm I’m not in need of blood from the injury, which feels ass-backwards, taking blood to decide if I need *more* blood, but I don’t complain. Then, he sews the wound shut, and stomps off to see some other patients while the labs are cooking. I lay back on the hospital bed and try to relax.

While he’s gone, I think about the cut. 

Elise had an identically shaped cut across her neck. I figure it can’t be a coincidence, but that begs the question - why am I still alive? Why wasn’t I drained like she was?

As I consider the possible answers, misery digs its roots in deep. The chaos of being implicated in her murder led me to barricade my emotions in an act of self-preservation. Now, with the threat somewhat managed, that barricade was melting down.

Tears well. My chest feels tight. I’m scared, and I’m angry, and, God, I just don’t understand.

As if to comfort me, Elise materializes in my mind. Her bouncy, cocoa-colored curls. Her glacier-blue eyes. Her world-soothing smile.

The image flickers. Fades.

Then, all I can picture is her waxy, soot-tinted face and her soulless eyes; a pair of white grapes wilted to the size of raisins.

Dead Elise won’t leave, and I can’t get her to go.

Panic drips down my spine.

I leap up from the hospital bed and throw the sliding doors open. I hear the physician behind me. He’s attempting to flag me down. Something about my blood is off, he says. More tests are pending.

I’m not listening, and I don’t slow down.

Before long, I’m in an Uber, head leaning against the warm glass of the passenger side window, watching Miami dissolve on the horizon. When I step out of the car, the wrathful Florida sun is starting to set once again.

And there’s a humming in the air.

\- - - - - 

The evening devolves into an alcohol-fueled daze. 

I’m in my bedroom, slumped over my desk, head down. I lift the bottle from the floor and take a lazy sip. Whiskey burns a numb pleasure in the pit of my stomach.

I’m listlessly staring out the window that faces the hill behind my house. I can’t see the reservoir through the blackness, but I know it’s there. My neck feels tight and frozen, like someone is tenderly strangling me with an icepack, but my torso feels warm and full. There’s a gentle *whooshing* right next to my ear. None of this bothers me in the moment, not even when a human-shaped silhouette drifts into view outside the window, wearing the night like a shroud.

I squint, but I can’t make out their features. It’s just a blurry head with broad shoulders atop an unnaturally slender torso. The figure drifts closer. A rapid thrumming overwrites the *whooshing*. It sounds like the beating of helicopter blades.

Because of the sharp decline, it’s a fifteen-foot drop from that window to the ground.

How could anyone be standing there, and, more importantly,

where did Elise’s blood go?

\- - - - - 

I wake up gasping and terrified. 

I fall off the chair. My ass hits the floor with a painful *thump.* The half-empty whiskey bottle tips over in the commotion, clattering against the hardwood, spilling its copper contents into a small, sticky puddle.

It’s morning. No specter of death hovering outside my window - just harsh sunlight.

A groan mixed with a sigh billows from my lips. I’m about to get myself upright when I notice something odd. 

There’s a slight wetness beneath my shirt, but it’s not on the correct side. My healing cut is on the right shoulder, not the left, and it’s bandaged - it shouldn’t be leaking *anything*. 

I rip off the shirt, jump upright, and sprint to the bathroom.

When I flick on the light, there it is: 

another identical cut. 

A mirror image of the older one hidden under the white bandage.

It doesn’t hurt.

It’s barely bleeding.

And for some inexplicable reason, unlike Elise,

I remain unfortunately alive. 

\- - - - - 

Honestly, I expected Danica’s office to match her character. Lavish. Larger than life. A corner office at the apex of some monolithic skyscraper. In reality, the space is little more than a broom closet with a filing cabinet in the courthouse's basement. Tim has to wait in the hall to make room for me.

Her desk is cluttered with used coffee cups and haphazard stacks of jaundiced legal paper. She leans forward and asks me to recount the events of that night. Her gaze is intense. Minutes turn to hours, and she never seems to blink.

At first, I’m reluctant. I know the story sounds unhinged; I can hardly believe it myself. Danica was different, though. She didn’t sneer. She didn’t roll her eyes. Even when I show her the second cut, she remains neutrally attentive. It’s an incredible breath of fresh air.

*“Do you believe me?”* I ask.

*“That’s not really the point,”* she quips. There’s a pause. The soft buzzing of her vest fills the silence. After what felt like days of unbroken eye contact, her gaze floats away from me.

*“But I do, yes.”*

I watch the words stumble over her tongue; each syllable is slow and drawn out. Bathed in the piercing glow of the ceiling bulbs, her porcelain skin almost appears to gleam. It’s not as perfectly smooth as I first thought, though. Close up, I detect a few subtle creases both above and below her lips, crisp and thin like tally marks.

*“So, what’s next?”*

*“Well, the police will get a warrant to search your house. Presumably, they won’t find the murder weapon, but I don’t think that’ll steer them away from indictment, and they might elect to arrest you, regardless of what they discover. Do you have money to pay bail if they do?”*

I shake my head *no.*

*“Don’t worry. Just call me. I’ll see what I can do.”*

Danica is undeniably the single beacon shining in the depths of a very black night, but I don’t understand *why*, and the amount of things I just plain don’t understand are starting to weigh heavy on my chest like a load of bricks, making each breath shallow and agonizing.

*“What’s your angle?”*

She cocks her head.

*“I mean, why are you doing all this? What do you get out of helping me?”*

*“Do I need a reason to want to help someone? Someone who’s inches away from becoming just another martyr to a very old, very broken system?”*

I hesitate, but an answer eventually slips out.

*“Yes. I think so.”*

Tim knocks on the door and then swings it open.

*“Your two’o’clock is here, ma’am.”*

Danica forces a weak smile.

*“We’ll discuss this another time, Mateo. In the meantime, you need to be safe. If I were you, I wouldn’t go home. Call in a favor. Crash on someone’s couch. Just don’t skip town.”*

As I step out, she volunteers one more piece of unsolicited advice.

*“Might want to get that second cut looked at, too.”*

\- - - - - 

I make a stop on my way home, but it’s not back to the emergency room; it’s to the hardware store. The pair of wireless video cameras I can afford aren’t top of the line, but they’ll make do.

Just as the sun begins to set, I’ve finished installing them: one in my living room, one in my bedroom. I hop in my car, flip my laptop open in my lap, and drive until the feed starts to get hazy, which ends up being about halfway down the block.

Night falls.

The bitter sting of an energy drink trickles down my throat. I crush the can and lob it into the back seat. I have five more where that came from if need be.

I’m not sure what I think I’m going to catch, but my eyes remain glued to the screen in anticipation.

Hours pass. 

I chug another caffeine spritzer and wring my shoulders out. I wonder if paranoia is a known symptom of grief. I’m about to call off the amateur stakeout when I spot movement.

My jaw drops. I rub my finger so vigorously against the screen that it squeaks, but it’s no smudge, and it keeps moving, slithering through my house, searching for something.

Searching for *me*.

It came from under the door; pinched itself through the tiny space between the door and its frame.

A tube.

The front of it glides like an elephant trunk, fanning side to side, edges wrinkling like it’s sniffing the air, but it’s much, much longer. Five feet, ten feet, fifteen feet - the silent worm continues to elongate.

I can see it on the bedroom feed now.

My phone vibrates in my pocket. My entire body spasms. I yelp.

Clumsily, I retrieve it.

The name of the emergency room flashes across the screen. I silence the call and toss my phone into the cupholder.

I bring my eyes back to the feed. It’s rooting through a box of my clothes now. When it finds nothing, the head reappears, spinning in small, dizzy circles. Eventually, it springs forward and plunges into my laundry hamper, passing right by the camera lens as it does.

Paper-thin teeth line the rim. They’re shaped like candy corn. The tube itself is translucent. I can see the rest of my room through its diameter, though it’s blurry and distorted, as if you were to use an unwashed glass as a telescope.

All of sudden, I have an epiphany.

If it came from under the door, there should be *some* part of it lingering on my stoop, right? 

I try to look, but I can’t see my stoop from my position: there’s a mass of shrubs in the way. Setting my laptop on the dashboard above the steering wheel, I roll down the window, and shove my head out of the car.

With enough elevation, I see something. 

There’s someone standing at my door, facing away from me. 

They’re tall, and they’re naked. Their hair is long and uncut. Thin black strands dangle against the small of their back. 

My heart flutters wildly against my rib cage.

Movement on the video feed catches my attention. I throw myself back in the car and grab my laptop from the dashboard.

The snout of the tube is pointing straight up. The edges appear agitated, or excited; they’re expanding and contracting feverishly. From the size of a soup can to the size of a manhole cover and then back again, over, and over, and over.

Then, at a seemingly impossible speed, the tube retracts. 

It retreats from my bedroom to my living room to explode out from under the door like a bolt of lightning. 

I look up from the screen. 

My eyes bulge from their sockets. 

I launch myself back out the window.

There’s no one on my stoop anymore. 

A distant thrumming slinks into my ear. 

The sound is directly overhead. It’s eerily familiar, and it’s getting louder.

It’s getting louder, because *they’re* getting closer. 

A wave of panic surges through my skull. I ram the key into the ignition. My foot crashes onto the pedal. The acrid odor of burning rubber fills the air as I peel out, and I hope that masks my scent.

Because I think that’s how they found me in the first place.

\- - - - -  

I’m driving down the highway towards Miami. My body is depleted, but I don’t expect my mind will be ready to sleep for another few decades. I rack my brain, trying to place where I’ve heard that *thrumming* sound before.

Suddenly, a nagging question pops into my head.

How Danica know about the cut before I did?

I make a wild U-turn, nearly clipping a city bus as my car skids. 

The courthouse is in the other direction. 

\- - - - - 

*“Why did you kill Elise?”* I demand. 

Her overstuffed office feels like an oven in the early morning. Viscous globules of sweat pour from every inch of my body. My grip on the pocket knife becomes tenuous. I can feel the plastic handle sliding in my palm. Still, I point the blade at her like I plan on using it.

Danica doesn’t look frightened. She doesn’t look fazed at all, really.

She just sits at her desk, staring at me.

I decide to show her what I know.

I stomp around the side of her desk and begin ripping the tubes from her vest. I even slam my fist into the connected machine’s conveniently labeled *“OFF”* button for good measure. 

The vest stills. The machine powers down.

And yet, the *thrumming* continues, emanating from her chest, buzzing like the wings of some elephantine mosquito.

It was all just camouflage.

Guess she can’t control the noise. 

*“Why did you kill - “*

*“Not me,”* she mutters.

*“What…?”* I ask, not convinced that I heard her correctly.

She leans back in her chair and sighs. I shake the knife closer to her. It wobbles in my grasp.

*“You wouldn’t happen to know what was there before they built your housing complex, do you?”* She looks up and meets my gaze. Her sharp, bark-colored eyes bore vicious holes into me.

*“Of course you don’t,”* she continues. *“Well, it was an old slaughterhouse. A big one, too. A giant slaughterhouse perched above a massive reservoir. A strange pairing, but it worked just fine. Better than fine, actually. Plenty of blood dripping down that hill, and it all disappeared into the water.”*

The thrumming in her chest intensifies, becoming shrill, almost melodic.

*“It was a good system, Mateo. That arrangement held things in balance for nearly a century,”* she scowls, gathering the tubes and reinserting them into her vest with a glint of annoyance in her features.

*“But now, things are different: my nieces…my nieces are going hungry.”*

I step back, stumbling over loose papers on the floor. The corners of Danica’s mouth ripple. They extend a few centimeters from her face, and then quickly retract. Her teeth seem to swirl around her gums like shards of glass in a washing machine.

*“My one niece - Rossa - she’s a nasty, voracious little thing. I’ve seen her proboscis grow miles long, and boy, has she developed a taste for you.”*

I still have the knife pointed at her, and yet, she feels safe enough to turn away. She flicks the her fake appliance back on and begins tinkering with settings.

*“Your blood is different, she claims.”* Danica snaps her fingers. She’s trying to recall the word Rossa used.

*“Ah!”* she gasps, pivoting back to face me.

Leaning forward, she whispers: *“Sour. That’s what she said - ‘exhilaratingly sour’. Unfortunately, she can’t have very much at one time. Hurts her stomach. Still, she loves it. Unlike your partner, who was evidently quite bland in comparison, and not very filling…”*

My fear curdles into a seething rage. I squeeze the handle of the knife so hard that the bones in my fingers ache. I shoot towards her and place the edge to her throat. I expect her to recoil, but she tilts into my advance. The blade rests tightly on her skin.

*“Listen, Mateo - to answer your question from yesterday: yes, my desire to help you wasn’t purely altruistic. I suppose I feel partially responsible for your…situation. They are my kin, after all, and they haven’t developed self-control, or a place in your society, like I have…”*

She twists her neck. The knife draws blood. Delicate crimson dewdrops fall, sizzling as they contact the metal.

*“But don’t fool yourself. Killing me here changes nothing. In fact, I’d argue it would make your predicament substantially worse, because, at the end of the day, who will believe you? They didn’t believe you when you said you didn’t kill Elise. They didn’t believe you when you said you hit that boy with a beer bottle in self-defense.”*

She winks, then continues to whet the blade against her porcelain skin. More boiling blood sprays against the knife.

*“That ‘boy’ has been charged with multiple counts of assault since your encounter, by the way. I checked. A real bellicose individual, it seems.”*

Danica’s mouth narrows to the diameter of a straw. Like a tornado hovering over the earth, it skirts across the knife, suctioning the blood back into her gullet. I hear her shifting teeth clinking against the metal. It sounds like hail. 

Hot nausea licks at my tonsils. My entire body is becoming numb and heavy.

Once the knife practically sparkling, her mouth snaps back into its normal shape.

*“My question to you is this: why now? When you’re caught standing over my corpse, cradling a blood-drenched knife like it’s the only thing you have left in this world, why do you expect they’ll believe you* ***now****?”*

My grip on the blade loosens. Every painful emotion - all the terror, all the anger, all the hurt - seems to evaporate in my veins. They leak like steam into the stale air of her claustrophobic office.

Because she’s right.

I fold my knife inward, shove it in my pocket, and sprint from Danica’s office.

*“Only come back if you’re willing to cooperate,”* she shouts after me.

*“And if you see Rossa before I do, well, tell her I say hello.”*

\- - - - - 

And that brings me up to this evening.

I’ve thought long and hard about what Danica told me. Don’t know if her intention was truly one of guidance, but I’m thankful nonetheless. 

Like I mentioned, she’s absolutely right. As it stands, there’s no reason for anyone to believe what I have to say. It’s an outlandish story, and a pisspour alibi. The scales of logic and objectivity are weighted against me.

But that makes the solution simple. All I need to do is put my finger on the scales. Tip things back in my direction.

So that’s what I plan on doing. 

Right now, I’m sitting in my car with the windows rolled up tight, down the street from my house.

I just got off the phone with Detective Frank.

Told the poor bastard that I have *so much* to show him regarding Elise's murder. He can bring as many friends as he wants, too; he just needs to meet me here *now*.

If Rossa is truly as voracious as Danica claims, I figure she’ll make an appearance, flying up from the reservoir to get a taste of all this nice new blood. Either Frank will survive with the image of that human mosquito burned into the back of his eyeballs, or he won’t survive at all.

Seems like a win-win to me.

While I wait, I plan on listening to the message the emergency room left on my voicemail when they called last night.
