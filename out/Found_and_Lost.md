Someone suggested taking photos of myself to document changes, and I did try. I took pictures of my face, my arms and hands, my torso, and my legs. On my chest right in the center I have this large freckle. Honestly it'd be better to call it a birthmark, but it's been there all my life. It's something I've always been a little self conscious about and it was in the photo I took. But when I checked myself this morning, it was gone, all that was left behind was rough skin, almost like a scar? 



I spent a good thirty minutes bouncing between having the mother of anxiety attacks, and just touching the skin where that mark used be. When I finally checked the photo, all it showed was the weird scar. No birthmark looking thing, nothing but that scar, like the mark had never been there, so... not only is that plan a bust, but I don't know if I can trust my memories, pictures of memories, or anything.



That's the biggest reason I decided to visit the address I was given. I was in over my head with all this, I had no idea what to do and the thought that maybe at the end of the road there could be some help, a savior from this madness? It was an easy decision.



When I left my motel room I made sure to take everything I still had in my possession with me, I was terrified of the thought of coming back to it and having a repeat of my apartment. It wasn't much, just my phone, laptop, the clothes I'd been wearing, and my keys. But they were \*mine\* and I refused to lose anything else, I was determined not too.



When I plugged the address into google maps, though, something fucking bizarre happened - the app went all, I don't know how else to describe it, but glitchy. For a moment it froze, then it flickered and crashed. I tried it a second time, with the same results. On the third try it finally stuck, though the app kept flickering the entire time - like it wanted to crash but couldn't anymore.



It was a fairly long drive, a good forty minutes away from the motel I was staying at, so I decided to call Maddy, my boss, to let her know I wouldn't be coming in today. It was a call I didn't need to make. I'd called her personal number, it was easier to get in touch with her that way, and when she answered her first words were, "Hello? Who is this?" I was shocked, to say the least, and felt dread building in my gut. We had our numbers programmed into each others phones. She had this ridiculous ringtone set specifically for me, but here she was asking who I was? 



My first question was if she got a new phone, maybe she was doing that stupid 'new phone, who dis', thing? But she wasn't, she sounded confused, and a little defensive even when she said it was her regular phone, and questioned again who I was. When I told her who I was, and that I was calling to say that I wouldn't be able to come in today, that I was calling in sick, her response left me feeling numb, and the blood in my veins colder than ice.



She didn't know who I was, didn't know what I was talking about. She said no one by my name had \*ever\* worked at the store with her, in fact it was just herself and a few volunteers. Was this my weird way of trying to ask for a job? When I pushed, insisting that we'd just talked literally yesterday, she got angry, and my pleading with her to remember me ended in her hanging up.



I had to pull onto the side of the road after that. I couldn't breathe, couldn't think, couldn't do anything but feel the confusion and panic and devastation boiling inside of me. Distantly, I could hear someone screaming and cursing, and realized after a few beats it was me. I was sobbing, pounding on my steering wheel and, to be absolutely blunt, losing my shit.



It took a while for me to calm down enough to continue driving. There was a moment when I genuinely considered just saying 'fuck it' and staying there on the side of the road. What was the point after all? I had no home, no job, no cat. I was losing everything important to me and I had no idea why. I think that was what spurred me to continue though. The not knowing, not understanding why it was happening. That more than anything else. I wanted...no, I \*needed\* answers.



When I pulled up to the address, what I found had me feeling even more off kilter than I had previously. All that was there was a little shop, the outside looked like it had seen better days. Paint was peeling and there was a sign hanging above the door - I couldn't quite make out what it said, it was so faded and weathered. And on either side of the store were abandoned, broken down buildings that looked like they'd been left empty for years, decades maybe.



This was the address though, this was where the cop I had told me to go, so despite an intense amount of uncertainty on my part, I opened the shop door and went inside. 



When I opened the door I heard a faint chime, but when I looked around there wasn't a chime on the door, or even anything that might have indicated a motion activated sound. It was just a faded door. What popped out at me first were the dimensions, the size of the shop itself. Just looking around it made me feel queasy, like I was on a rollercoaster ride. It was like the walls and ceiling were too long and short at the same time, both variations occupying the same space in a way that made my head ache, and my eyes water.



The second thing I noticed were the lights, they flickered above, casting the shop interior in strange shadows, but there was no buzzing sound from them. There wasn't any sound, actually. No sound from the traffic outside, no sound from the flickering lights, no sound as I gingerly walked across the too soft feeling floor. It was like the entire space within absorbed sound, leaving nothing but abject silence in its wake.



I was about to call out, more just to hear something than out of any need to find someone, when I was grabbed from behind. I would have screamed, but whoever it was had the foresight to clap their hand over my mouth as they started dragging me past the counter and towards the door behind it.



I was putting up a struggle, who wouldn't, when I heard a voice hiss in my ear, "What the \*fuck\* are you doing here? Are you insane?" The tones less angry and more filled with a desperate urgency, "Just stay quiet, and come with me." Was whispered once I stopped trying to break free. I was turning to face whoever it was that had grabbed me, when I hard a sharp hiss of breath and found myself being yanked unceremoniously to the door, even as the door to the shop opened and another chime sounded, followed by a presence I can only describe as \*heavy\*. It felt like being in the space as whoever had just entered was a weight on my bones, pressing me down until I couldn't move.



I likely would have stayed rooted to the spot I was in if it hadn't been for the person dragging and literally shoving me through the door. I stumbled to a stop inside what looked like a break room. There was a coffee pot, and one of those older bulky tvs affixed to the wall that was playing static. 



Beyond that there were people, several people, that stood or sat in groups around the room, a room that was larger than it had first seemed. They stared at me, and I stared back until I found myself being spun around by my attacker, or maybe my last chance at surviving this. Meeting their gaze, I noticed that their eyes were the same flat brown shade mine were. I think they noticed as well, because their expression shifted from anger, to confusion, and finally to sympathy. 



Whatever he saw in my eyes, it was obvious he'd seen it before, maybe lived it before.



"Ah, shit. I remember that look. Didn’t think I’d see it again so soon. You got it's attention, didn't you?”



I stared at him for a second, feeling overwhelmed and confused before answering.



"What does that even mean? What fucking look? What does that even have to do with anything?"



Before I could keep yelling, and it \*was\* yelling, panicked unthinking yelling a hand clamped down firmly over my mouth, silencing me and leaving me staring wide eyed at the man. 



"Look, I know everything happening is probably confusing, frightening for you. But you're going to have to keep your \*fucking\* voice down, you understand me?"



I didn't really have any choice other than to nod, even as my eyes darted around looking for some sign that someone might intervene, the people around us, they all stayed silent. Some were watching us with interest, other seemed utterly unaware we were even there. The man, seeing my gaze, maybe realizing what I was searching for, scoffed, a bitter sound that spoke of a hard earned knowledge.



"You're not gonna find any help from them, don't bother. It doesn't matter anyway, this room, right here." At that he gestured around the break room, that seemed simultaneously filled with people and oddly empty at the same time. The harder I stared, the more confusing it became until the man shook me by the shoulders, grabbing my attention, "This is the only safe place you'll find. Nothing can get in here. Now, listen, that thing out there - I know you fucking felt it - but that thing, it's after you. It doesn't want to kill you, that'd be too kind of it. No, no, what it wants to do is eat the \*essence\* of what you are. Who you are. Your memories, your thoughts, the memories of you. It's going to eat, and eat, and eat until there's not a goddamned thing left. Nothing to ever say you were here. That you existed. That you fucking \*mattered\*"



I wanted to call him a liar, call him crazy, call this whole goddamned thing a twisted joke. But he was right, I \*had\* felt it.



"I...I don't know what I felt, I didn't see anything - anyone"



"You had it right the first time with 'anything'. What's out there isn't a person, it doesn't think like a person does, or feel like a person does. It's just...hunger incarnate."



He shook his head then, looking me up and down before heaving out a weary sight, "You've got two choices ahead of you, and I'll tell you now neither one of them is easy. You can fight to survive, fight to stay real, to exist. Or you can give up, and become one of them."



At that he gestured towards the people that hadn't yet acknowledged me, hadn't acknowledged anything really. They were...it wasn't that they were see through, it was more that there presence in the world was like an echo of a thing, like a memory of a memory, and all that was left was the blank people before me.



I was staring, maybe a little too long, when the nearest woman finally turned her head to face me. She still wasn't looking at me, it was more like she was looking through me, but when she spoke, I knew it was directed at me alone. "You think you matter....you think you're real...you won't. Not for much longer...maybe you never did." 



My stomach churned as she spoke, not just because of what she said, but her voice. It was soft, but rough and crackling, like someone had recorded a woman speaking, then recorded that same sound over, and over onto different tapes until all that was left was a copy of a copy. Was that what was happening to me? What I'd become? What was the point of fighting if that's what was at the end of the road.



It was another shake from the man before me that yanked me out of my downward spiral. 



"Just ignore her, ignore them. Her and the rest like her, they stopped fighting. Some gave up. Some didn’t even know they were losing until it was too late. Now they just sit there, waiting to disappear completely. They’re already ghosts, all they're doing is waiting for the room to soak up what's left."



As he said that, above us the lights - that had up to that point been steady if muted - began to flicker, and on the static filled tv screen flashes of an unsettling familiar room began to drift in and out of the crackling static. My living room, but warped, twisted, in a way I couldn't put a name to. In a way I didn't \*want\* to name.



Jerking my gaze from the tv I looked back to the man I blurted out, "You said it was safe in here, right? That nothing can get in here?" 



I'm not ashamed to admit my voice was shaking, that I was crying. His own eyes were wide, filled with a helpless sort of fear...and a strange determination, as he met my gaze.



"Nothing \*can\* get in here, that doesn't mean it can't try to make us come out."
