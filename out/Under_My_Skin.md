I am Emily and I wore my boyfriends skin because I thought it would bring us closer together. I wasn’t always this way. Our love was intense and passionate, but little did Jacob know, my affection would soon transcend the boundaries of sanity. Oopsies.

I adored Jacob with an obsession that consumed my every thought. I would watch him from afar, memorizing his every move, and imagining a future where we would be together forever. He had beautiful brown hair with blue eyes. His skin was perfect. He was just everything a woman dreamed of. But as time passed, my love twisted into something darker, fueled by jealousy and possessiveness.

One fateful night, as Jacob sat contemplating the future of our relationship, he realized that my love had become suffocating.

As Jacob gathered his courage to break free from my grasp, I sensed his intentions. My heart, now consumed by madness, could not bear the thought of losing him. I resolved to ensure our love would remain eternal, even if it meant taking drastic measures.

One evening, while Jacob slept soundly in his bed, I crept into his room, my eyes gleaming with a sinister determination. In my hands, I held a sharp knife, its blade glinting ominously under the pale moonlight. With each step I took, my heart raced with anticipation, fueled by a love that had warped into something macabre.

As I approached Jacob, I hesitated briefly, my grip tightening around the knife. I whispered in his ear, "We shall be together forever, my love."

With one swift motion, I plunged the knife into Jacob's chest, silencing his startled gasp. Blood spilled onto the sheets, staining them crimson as his life ebbed away. But my madness had only just begun.

In the days that followed, I skillfully flayed Jacob's lifeless body, carefully separating skin from flesh. I meticulously stitched myself into his skin, layering it onto my own like a grotesque second skin. I wore his face like a mask, preserving the illusion of love and togetherness.

I reveled in my newfound transformation, believing I had finally achieved the eternal bond I had yearned for. I spoke to his lifeless eyes, whispered sweet nothings into his deaf ears, and danced with his limp body in a twisted celebration. 

But as the days turned into weeks, my grip on reality grew increasingly tenuous. I could no longer distinguish between Jacob's memories and my own, my mind consumed by the darkness that had enveloped my soul.

Eventually, the town began to notice Jacob's absence, and whispers of his disappearance circulated among them. Suspicion pointed to me, with my eerie demeanor and the unnerving way I clung to Jacob's memory.

One stormy night, as I danced with Jacob's lifeless body in my home, a mob of angry people gathered outside. Driven by both fear and justice, they stormed my house, intent on bringing an end to the madness that had consumed their town.

As they broke down the doors, I stood before them, my eyes glazed over with delusion. I clung desperately to the remnants of my beloved Jacob, my mind unable to comprehend the horror I had become.

The mob, fueled by righteous anger, carried out swift justice. They took me into the streets and burned me alive. Jacobs skin was still attached to me. In a sick dark way I guess you could say we perished together that night. 

As I started to smell his flesh burn first, it dawned on me that you can’t love someone into loving you back. The fear of being alone consumed me.
