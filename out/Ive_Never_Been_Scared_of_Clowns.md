Like the title says, I’ve never been scared of clowns. When the clown sightings were happening and everyone was freaking out over it, I focused on myself. In fact, I never even saw one in person! Only online. When I was a kid, I was more afraid of dolls, ghosts, things like that. But never clowns. I don’t know why, but I just wasn’t. I listened to horror stories every night as a bedtime story or true crime, but after what happened I’ve switched to more… vanilla stories. Damn clowns. 

So it’s been about two weeks since I moved into my new house. I’m not married or anything, so it’s just a small, cozy house with a lot of history. I think it was built around 1856, I’m not entirely sure. I just know it’s been standing longer than my great-grandpa. Well, anyways. Everything was normal and I was starting to settle in until the midnight calls started happening. At first, I thought they were prank calls. It was your basic heavy breathing, silence, static, whatever. But things got weird, and they got weird fast.

One night I was finishing up some papers for work when I got a call at 11:57 PM. The last few times there were no sounds, but this time there was faint music. Kind of sounded like carnival music? Then, there was laughing. To be honest, it gave me chills, but I just brushed it off as some weirdo messing with me. The next night the call came around the same time. This time the laughter was louder, almost like it was next to the phone, swallowing it or something. Then, whispering. It sounded like it might have been just out of earshot because I tried to listen, but I couldn’t make out what they were saying.

I was starting to be on edge and began turning out my lights around 10, finishing paperwork in the morning, locking the doors as soon as I got home, and double-checking the windows when I got home. Yeah, I know, I was losing my mind. I wanted to change my number, but I didn’t want to go through the pain of updating everything. It also felt sort of personal too, almost like they knew me or something.

A few nights ago, the call came again. This time 12 on the dot. I let it ring a few times before answering, and this time a voice spoke. “Do you want to play a game?” I immediately thought of the movies and laughed. This was definitely a prank, so I hung up. Then, another call. This time I didn’t hear anything until a few seconds later—footsteps. I pulled my phone away from my ear slightly and heard something moving outside my front door. I brushed it off as bushes rustling or something. My house was small, so noises sounded more intense. This gave me chills though, my heart started racing, so I hung up again and turned off my phone. I could hardly sleep, my mind was racing with fear. I laid in bed with my eyes open the entire time and watched the clock go from midnight to 3 AM.

I heard the noise again, and they were definitely footsteps. They were soft and slow, almost like someone with maybe flats on or barefoot? I held my breath and strained my ears, trying to listen. I almost jumped out of my skin when I heard a knock on the door. I was a grown man being pranked by some weirdo, and I felt like I had no control over this situation. I toughened up and went to the front door. I looked through the peephole and… nothing. Absolutely nothing. I double-checked the locks and tried to convince myself that maybe a neighbor was drunk or something. I did a check around the house, checking the locks and windows before heading back to my bed. Nothing happened after that, and I was able to sleep after laying there for about an hour.

I was ready last night. I double-checked all the locks, windows, and turned out all the lights. I sat by my phone waiting. 11:55 PM. My phone rings. I answered it. With a stern voice, I greet whoever is on the other line. “Hello. Who is this?” I asked. “Come outside,” the voice on the other line says while laughing. I felt a cold sweat break out on my forehead, and I began getting nauseous. I asked again, “Who are you?”

The voice started laughing harder before spitting out “Look outside,” between breaths. So I did. Heart pounding, I walked toward the window in my room and peeked through the blackout curtains I invested in after the third night of this happening. I didn’t see anything, and then I did. When I scanned the street a little more, I spotted someone under a streetlamp. It was a damn clown. It wasn’t a colorful, happy-go-lucky clown. It was old-fashioned, with a huge creepy smile, a pale face, and dark red lip paint. They held a briefcase and a knife in the other hand. They waved with the hand holding the knife.

I freaked and dropped the curtain, backing away and trying to catch my breath. The phone still in my hand, I held it against my ear so I could hear the person. “Come outside and play,” the voice whispered. I immediately hung up and phoned the police, but when they arrived the clown was gone.

I’m writing this now on my computer, waiting for midnight to come again. Although I have my phone turned off, I can still hear that awful carnival music and that chilling laughter. I haven’t figured out who’s doing this, but I’m terrified of what’ll come next. I’ve never been scared of clowns… until now. 

If you’re reading this, be careful and don’t forget to lock your doors at night. Sometimes that bump in the night could very well be real. And who knows? They just might want to play.
