Like the title says, I’ve never been scared of clowns. When the clown sightings were happening and everyone was freaking out over it, I focused on myself. In fact, I never even saw one in person! Only online. When I was a kid, I was more afraid of wars, ghosts, things like that. But never clowns. I don’t know why, but I just wasn’t. I used to listen to horror stories every night or true crime, but after what happened I’ve switched to log cabin building. It’s peaceful, quiet, but not silent.

So I was about two weeks moved into my new house when the calls started. I live by myself, had a few nasty exes, one divorce, so I refused relationships. My house is a small, cozy, suburban home.  Everything was normal, nothing out of place, just a quiet home. And I was really starting to settle in when the midnight calls started happening. At first, I thought they were prank calls. It was your basic heavy breathing, silence, static, whatever. But things got weird, and they got weird fast.

One night I was finishing up some papers for work when I got a call at 11:57 PM. The last few times there were no sounds, but this time there was faint music. Kind of sounded like carnival music? Then, there was laughing. To be honest, it gave me chills, but I just brushed it off as some weirdo messing with me. The next night the call came around the same time. This time the laughter was louder, almost like it was next to the phone, swallowing it or something. Then, whispering. It sounded like it might have been just out of earshot because I tried to listen, but I couldn’t make out what they were saying.

I was starting to be on edge and began turning out my lights around 10, finishing paperwork in the morning, locking the doors as soon as I got home, and double-checking the windows when I got home. Yeah, I know, I was losing my mind. I wanted to change my number, but I didn’t want to go through the pain of updating everything. It also felt sort of personal too, almost like they knew me or something.

The night after that, the call came again. This time 12 on the dot. I let it ring a few times before answering, and this time a woman spoke. “You wanna play a game?” I immediately thought of the movies and laughed. This was definitely a prank, so I hung up. Then, another call. This time I didn’t hear anything until a few seconds later—footsteps. I pulled my phone away from my ear slightly and heard something moving outside my front door. I brushed it off as bushes rustling or something. My house was small, so noises sounded more intense. This gave me chills though, my heart started racing, so I hung up again and called the police. They did a sweep, but nothing. They left. I could hardly sleep, my mind was racing with fear. I laid in bed with my eyes open the entire time and watched the clock go from midnight to 3 AM.

I heard the noise again, and they were definitely footsteps. They were soft and slow, almost like someone with maybe flats on or barefoot? I held my breath and strained my ears, trying to listen. I almost jumped out of my skin when I heard a knock on the door. I was a grown 57 year old man being pranked by what I bet is a young brat, and I felt like I had no control over this situation. I toughened up and went to the front door. I looked through the peephole and… nothing. Absolutely nothing. I double-checked the locks and tried to convince myself that maybe a neighbor was drunk or something. I did a check around the house, checking the locks and windows before heading back to my bed. 

But what if it was them…? I called the police. When they arrived they seemed irritated and did another sweep. They told me to go back to sleep, and that it was probably some kind of prank. Nothing happened after that, and I was able to sleep after laying there for about an hour.

I was ready the next night, I prepared. I double-checked all the locks, windows, and turned out all the lights. I sat by my phone waiting. 11:55 PM. My phone rings. I answered it. With a stern voice, I greet whoever is on the other line. “Hello. Who is this?” I asked. “Come outside,” the woman on the other line says while laughing. I felt a cold sweat break out on my forehead, and I began getting nauseous. I asked again, “Who are you?”

She started laughing harder before spitting out “Look outside,” between breaths. So I did. Heart pounding, I walked toward the window in my room and peeked through the blackout curtains I invested in after the night of this happening. I didn’t see anything, and then I did. When I scanned the street a little more, I spotted someone under a streetlamp. It was a damn clown. It wasn’t a colorful, happy-go-lucky clown. It was old-fashioned, with a huge creepy smile, a pale face, and dark red lip paint. They held a knife and waved it. 

I freaked and dropped the curtain, backing away and trying to catch my breath. The phone was still in my hand, I held it against my ear so I could hear the person. “Come outside and play,” she whispered. I immediately hung up and phoned the police, but when they arrived the clown was gone. They were upset. I didn't understand why, I was literally the one being harassed! This time they came in and told me to sit on the couch. 

“You can’t keep calling. There’s nothing here and you haven’t been hurt, they aren’t breaking in. Probably just trying to scare you,” the officer said. They told me they’ll check in the house just in case. I sat there freaking out because this wasn’t my fault, why were they blaming me? Regardless, I waited. Nothing. I felt so defeated and then they just left. 

I didn’t understand why this was happening to me. I’ve never been scared of clowns and now one just shows up in the middle of the night. The next few nights I turned my phone completely off to not receive any calls. But then I started hearing noises around the house which terrified me.

Around 1 AM I woke up to what sounded almost like a loud crash. Then, I heard it again, only it was coming from inside the house. I sat up, walking over to my door, and peeked outside of it. I couldn’t make anything out because it was so dark and I stood there straining my eyes until I heard the noises again from the kitchen. It got closer, closer, closer! I slammed my door shut and grabbed my phone as quickly as I could to phone the police. My door opened slowly, my phone still powering on, I looked behind me. The clown stood in front of me just staring.

She ran at me and started attacking me.  Slashing me with the large knife she had. I was an older gentleman, so it was more physically demanding for me to fight back and she was without a doubt strong.  I tried so hard and feared I’d never make it out alive. I grabbed objects near me to attack her with, but they just weren’t large or heavy enough. I shoved my fingers into her eyes and was able to grab my phone and limp myself into the bathroom. I phoned 911, hearing that damn clown banging on the door. Then, silence. I didn’t live far so I knew they’d be here soon. I could hear the sirens and I felt my adrenaline leaving my body, the pain rushing in. 

I looked down… my fingers… two of my fingers have been sliced off. I sat there beside my tub panting, my blood soaking my clothes and the floor,  just begging for me to be saved. I was so exhausted and scared that this was it.

I was taken to the hospital where I was questioned by police about the event, but at the time I could hardly recall exactly what happened. I was in so much pain and shock that all I could give them was, “that damned clown”. After I got stitches, I asked about my fingers. The police couldn’t find them when they looked and assumed whoever was there took them with them. Some kind of sick trophy. No longer a pointer or middle finger, but I guess I have the other hand for that. About a day later I went to the police station for a follow up to explain everything that happened. I didn’t know who would do this or why and all I could really give them was it was a scary fuckin’ clown. 

They had someone do surveillance around the neighborhood for a few days which eased some of my worries. Since nothing happened during those days, they decided it was safe again. I also ended up changing my number during that time and received no calls after that. They didn’t see or find anyone and still haven’t at the time of me writing this. Sometimes I would even see that person standing off in the distance. At first, I was calling the cops but after a while I just felt exhausted. I just started staying home and locking myself away. 

About a year later I started dating again. I was too scared to live on my own and I didn’t want to hole up and die this way.  I decided I wanted a family. A home. I met my wife in the grocery store and we moved in together half a year after that. We decided to move to a different town close by and get a house over there. I sold the other one, I just couldn’t bear living there. The new house felt like a fresh start. 

I don’t answer calls anymore unless it’s saved in my phone and I don’t think I will ever again. Since I moved in with my wife, everything has stopped. We go to bed early around 9 and I still double check my locks and windows. I never saw the clown after that and I never received any calls around that time anymore. 

If this post reaches you, don’t forget to lock your doors at night. Sometimes that bump in the night could very well be real, and maybe… they just might want to play.
