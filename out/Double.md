I will forgive you for passing the following off as the ramblings of an old man.  Even after all these years, when I recall the events that transpired, I have difficulty believing they were anything but a child’s imaginative story.  However, I know for fact they were very real.

We were walking down one of the many side roads that make up the majority of our ramshackle little town.  It was just before dusk, and the waning red sun cast our shadows out behind us for what seemed like miles.  The air was still and the oncoming night held no promise to banish away the heat.  

The three of us walked, jeering at one another as teenage boys often do, enjoying each other’s company while pretending not to.  A lot of playful shoving, talk of what games we were excited to play.  John, ever the playboy, would brag about getting to second base with Sarah Gray, whom we all knew had hated him ever since the first grade when he had put a frog in her lunchbox.  Bill, who bullies would refer to as Butterball due to his weight, would go on about the latest video game coming out.

The stretch of road we were currently ambling along had a large number of old decrepit houses lining the wide street.  Untrimmed hedges obscured lawns full of weeds and overgrown grass.  Paint flecked here, and vinyl siding hung limply there.  Crabgrass shot up through cracks in the pavement to bask in the waning light.  The housing market bubble had burst a few years prior and homes were abandoned and foreclosed on quickly.  Many streets appeared as ghost towns in an otherwise busy little village.   

A number of us kids had broken into a few of the homes and looked around, disappointed to find nothing but dust, trash, and feces from whatever squatter had most recently taken up residence.  We had even ran across one or two of the vagabonds, though they were quick to shoo us away and we were just as quick to run.  Never did any of them attack us.  That would have brought unwanted attention.  They stayed inside hiding from the little foot traffic that went by.

As a result we had several roads to ourselves.  Cars rarely traveled these side streets even when the houses were occupied.  Police only rarely looked down to see if anything was amiss.  Except for us and the random homeless person peeking through a window, we were the only people on the street.

Which made it odd when we topped a small hill and came across an elderly man with a cane walking as though it were a Sunday afternoon.  We had seen the full length of the street only moments earlier, and we all swore there was no man there.  He would have been a black shadow against the setting sun, easily distinguished walking along the abandoned sidewalk.  A long forgotten shade within a long forgotten neighborhood.

The elderly man was not moving very fast and we easily caught up to him.  He was nearly bald, with the last few wispy strands of white hair that comes with age adorning his head.  His skin was dark and leathery from years of working in the sun.  He wore a simple white short sleeved shirt and blue jeans.  While he did walk slowly, slightly bent over his cane, he did not exude an air of weakness.  Indeed, he was supporting the cane more than the cane was supporting him.

Being boys, we were flirting with danger by walking in the middle of the road, though as I said there was nary a car to be seen.  We assumed we’d be able to walk by quickly before the man saw us in his peripheral.  The man did see us, however, as we came upon him and nodded in our direction.  He then cracked a grin that, while should have been filled with all the warmth of midsummer, sent a shiver down my spine.  Was it the grin?  Or was it those piercing blue eyes that belied his age?  No, it was the grin.  I was certain of it.  A grin that belonged more to a boy half my age than on a man old enough to be my father’s father.

“You boys out for an evening stroll?”  We ‘yessired’ as polite as we knew how.  “Well that’s just fine.  Just fine.  I can’t say I approve of you boys walking in the streets, however.  Cars don’t see young boys like you.  They don’t see,” he tapped his wire-rimmed glasses with his free finger, “like I see.”  He sighed then. “Well, can’t say I didn’t do the same at your age.”

He rambled on.  For some reason, we had slowed to match his pace.  The man was friendly enough, mostly talking about the state of the street, the town, the state, and the country.  Every iteration moved further out until all the world’s troubles became, well, the world’s.  As his head bobbed while talking, I noticed a peculiar birthmark on his head, just above his right ear.  It was a patch of purplish skin, dark even against his well tanned skin.

“Well, I think I’ve held you boys up long enough.”  And as though a spell had been broken, our pace quickened and we left the man behind.  It was only then I realized that beyond our initial greeting, none of us had spoken.  I felt as though I hadn’t taken a breath of air in hours.  As we increased the distance between us, I took large gulps of hot dry air trying to fill my lungs to bursting.

“What the fuck was that?” John asked, puzzlement adorning his otherwise roguish face.  “I wanted to run but I couldn’t even make myself walk faster.”

Bill looked just as confused.  Beads of sweat had formed on his more rotund features and some had combined to form little rivulets down the side of his head.  “I don’t know, man.  I...it’s like I couldn’t even think.  And he just kept going on and on about...nothing?  I can’t even remember.”

I just shook my head.  I was still trying to grasp as much oxygen as my body would allow for.  I was also sweating profusely.  We all were, really.  The summer heat was getting to us, is what we all agreed upon.

But I glanced over my shoulder.  And there he was, not but fifty paces back, still grinning and those blue eyes fixated on us.  On me, it felt like.  We should have left him far behind us, not just a hundred or so feet, by that time.  We were practically jogging.  But he just shuffled along, one step at a time, cane swinging forward.

“Let’s...go down another street,” I suggested.  Both nodded in agreement and we turned right onto Pine Street.

We walked in silence for a bit, before John cracked a small joke which, thanks to the sudden release in tension in the air, caused Bill to break into fits of laughter.  His voice echoed around the empty buildings, easing the mood greatly.  

I chuckled a bit and glanced behind me.  The waning red sun still cast our shadows out behind us, but the old man was not there.  Something still seemed off.  I couldn’t quite figure it out.
Pine Street, as it turned out, felt a bit more lively.  The houses weren’t quite as dead as they were on...Whatever Street.  While most were still empty, there were hints of occupation here and there.  A well tended lawn, a rose bush in bloom, a sprinkler.  For every three empty buildings, one stood out as still having life.  We had moved to the sidewalk now since it was obvious cars could become a problem.

We never saw any.  And we didn’t see any people either.  For such a nice night, no one was out cooking barbeque on a grill, or children playing in the water to escape the heat, or any of the other such summer activities one would come to expect.  Yes, something did still feel off.

After another block we turned right again, intent on making our way back home.  I forget exactly the street we turned down, only that it was visually identical to the previous one.  A few well kept lawns and several old abandoned homes.  I remember vividly the contrast between the short grass of one lawn adjacent to the overgrown weed farm of another.  I was too young to understand property values then, so I didn’t really understand why it was so hard for people to move out or into such an area.  My father had tried explaining it to me, but like most teens I only pretended to pay attention while daydreaming of something else.

We crested a hill and in the distance a shape emerged shadowed against the setting sun.  It really couldn’t have been, we all murmured at once.  We had walked for a bit and passed several side streets.  It was not entirely outside of the realm of possibility that the old man had cut down a street and wound up ahead of us.  We kept walking, quickly overtaking his long shadow that stretched almost menacingly towards us.

As we came closer we each breathed in relief.  It was not the old man.  This man was in his late thirties or early forties.  He was balding, with brown tufts of hair surrounding a cap of bare skin.  He wore a green work shirt and an uncomfortable looking pair of khakis.

He was walking towards us, seemingly ignoring the three boys occupying his walking space.  He didn’t speak as he passed us, but grinned a grin that could chill ice.  We barely nodded and shuffled along.  I found I couldn’t breathe again.  Bill’s face was again covered in sweat.  John had turned green and looked about ready to sick up.

“He had the same eyes.” John finally croaked.  “I know it can’t be him but it was him.  How was it him?”  Bill wiped his face with his shirt, but said nothing.  I was too busy hyperventilating.  I felt as though I couldn’t get any air.

“It couldn’t have been him.  It...wasn’t.” John said doubtfully.  “No,” he said more forcefully, “it wasn’t.  It couldn’t have been.  He’s some random guy on his way home from working the counter at a corner store.”  John sounded like he was trying to convince himself.  I let him.  It was working for me.

I glanced behind and instantly wished I had not.  The man had turned to look over his own shoulder at us.  His grin was still splitting his face and his eyes were shining blue agates in the dying sunlight.  He waved and threw his head back to laugh.  The sound that came out was nails on a chalkboard.  We ran.  We ran as fast as our legs could go to escape those waves of insidious laughter.  We ran around another corner, praying we could escape.
“I...think...we lost him…” Bill was panting.

“Guys...this...this is Pine Street!”  John had gone from green to white.  His eyes were bulging in their sockets.  A shaky finger pointed at the street sign.

John was right.  It was Pine Street.  The signpost was clearly visible and the houses were the same.  Except not quite.  There were no clearly abandoned houses.  Every house looked lived in with well tended lawns and cars in the driveways.  I could see some clothes hanging to dry on lines.  But still no people.  Not a hint of a person anywhere.

“This is impossible,” I breathed.  “This is not possible.”

“You guys okay?” the voice came from ahead.  John let out a yelp and Bill scooted back ten steps in an instant.  The man was staring at us with his back to the sun, making focusing on him difficult.  I could see he had messy brown hair and looked to be probably in his twenties, but that was it.  “You came around that corner like hares running from a fox.”

I couldn’t move.  I couldn’t breathe.  He took a step closer.  His blue eyes flashed.  His grin split his face.  “I swear, catching up to you boys is the most fun I’ve had in a long while.”

Bill let out a shriek.  He lunged forward and grabbed both John and I by the cuff of our shirts and dragged us backwards.  And the spell was broken.  We were running the other direction.  We rounded the corner and faced the setting sun and rows of white picket fences and trimmed hedges and freshly painted pavement and cars and sprinklers and laundry and no people to be seen anywhere.

And him.

But not him.  He had changed again.  He was even younger.  He looked familiar.  And a cold realization washed over me.  I no longer felt the heat of the day.  What I saw drove away any warmth left in my body. 

My blue eyes, my brown hair, my baggy shorts and dirty t-shirt and sneakers with the soles worn too far.  Except he had that grin.  That too wide Cheshire grin.  And he faced us with his back to the sun.

“Well this has been fun but all good things must end.  I’ve waited a bit too long this time.”  We were frozen.  We couldn’t move.  His voice transfixed us.  He chuckled softly.  In my voice.  “I’ll be quick about it, I suppose.  No sense in putting this off any longer.”

Tears were streaming down John’s face and he shuddered visibly.  Bill had fallen to his knees without taking his eyes off the man.  I couldn’t even take a breath.

“Why…” John croaked, “Why do you look like me?”  I blinked.  Like him?  No, this man...this thing looked like me!

“What do you mean?” Bill whispered in a raspy, puzzled voice, “It’s me!  He’s ME!  But...not fat!  He’s me but not me!”  And I understood.  The thing was deciding.  It was deciding who to be.  Who to take.

“Well now.  I don’t think that would be very fun,” he gestured at Bill.  “All that fat gone in an instant would be hard to explain away.  And pretty boy,” he gestured to John, “would draw too much attention, I think.  So that leaves…” And he turned to me, grinning.  I was still frozen when he leapt upon me.

It was ice.  His hand wrapped around my throat and all I could feel was ice.  Ice suffocating me.  Ice pumping through my veins.  A cold torrential stream of ice and cold and frozen needles slicing through my flesh at every conceivable angle at every point in my short life.  It slashed me and stabbed me and froze me to my core then went deeper still until my very soul was being iced over.  Thoughts, dreams, feelings, emotions everything was being stripped away from me.

And as sudden as it had happened it was over.  John, somehow breaking free of his trance, had knocked the thing away.  Bill had found a large thick stick and slammed it into the things head.  It shrieked then, a hideous howl of confusion and fear.  I was on the ground, my head muddled, but now the red hot fires of anger were melting away the ice.  I tasted anger in my mouth.  I felt my blood pumping.  I felt the heat and rage rising.  This…thing…needed to be destroyed! 

It was snarling. Angry.  The thing was on all fours and bellowed.  I didn’t pause.  I grabbed it by the throat as it had me and pummeled it with my free hand.  We tussled, fell over one another, and fought a schoolyard brawl.  It only registered briefly how it would look to an outsider coming upon us, twins trying to destroy one another.

We separated momentarily.  The blow Bill had landed had split the skin open next to that purplish patch of skin.  Blood oozed out matting down its hair.

We locked in battle again, trading blow after blow.  I was bleeding from where my teeth had cut into my mouth.  It had a black eye.  I was barely conscious of both Bill and John hovering just out of reach.  Bill still had that all too large stick in hand and John had found a rusted metal bar from somewhere.

“KILL HIM!” I heard my voice say.  “KILL HIM BEFORE HE KILLS ME!”  And Bill and John rushed in, weapons swinging.  There was a sickening thud and everything went blissfully quiet.

***

I sighed, pushing myself back from the table.  I had been writing for most of the afternoon.  It was near sunset and I could feel the lack of energy in my bones.  I tire so easily these days.  The memories of that day had brought back a fear that I had long forgotten and it had started welling up more and more with each word I put down.

I thought about the body.  Of course we told ourselves we hadn’t just killed another human.  His face was frozen in terror and surprise.  Like he didn’t know how it had ended that way.  Like he expected a different outcome.  It was the kind of horror that only someone who saw their own mortality laid bare before them could understand.

We had taken a tattered tarp from one of the abandoned yards, wrapped the body up, and tossed it into the river where it washed out to the ocean.  As far as we knew, no one had found it.  When I got home, my mother made a fuss over my injuries.  We lied and said a couple of bullies from a nearby town had jumped us.

“You should see them!”  Bill tried joking, but neither John nor I smiled about it.  My father just shrugged with a ‘boys will be boys’ attitude.  My mother still had none of it and was very firm we were to not walk in the abandoned part of town any more.

We never spoke about that day.  No one ever brought it up.  I’d like to think that with each passing year the memories of it faded a little bit more from their minds.  But not mine.  Not after what I had seen.  What I had done.

Well, I thought, no sense in putting this off any longer.

I had neatly stacked the sheets of paper I just finished writing, set them in the middle of the table where they’d be easily discovered, and then stood to prepare.  The last ramblings of an old man confessing to a crime no one had reported.

My bones creaked as I shuffled over to the dresser to pull out a pair of jeans and a simple white t-shirt.  Thinking about it for a moment, I included a small pistol into the mix.  This time, I wanted to make it easy.  The last time I had tried it had been too much of a struggle.  There was no sense in prolonging the inevitable, this time I’d do it right.

I had a good long life.  I had two friends who stuck by me well into adulthood.  We had been through rough patches, of course, but how many others can say they kept the same childhood friends well into their forties and beyond?  And we shared a dark secret, one that still haunted me.  They never spoke of it to me, but it still bothers me.  I was the one who gave the order.  They just did what I told them to.  If it had ever come out, I’m sure that would be their defense.  But I never held that against them.  They were the closest thing I had to brothers.

It is a shame they had to die.

I had started losing my hair in my thirties.  By forty most of it was gone.  I had taken to wearing ball caps to hide the loss.  Apparently, I probably didn’t need to be so self-conscious about it. 
 The others didn’t seem to notice.  

At first.

Bill had noticed sometime in our late thirties.  It was amazing he had lived as long as he did with how obese he had gotten over the years.  The man did not know what exercise or healthy eating meant.  The coroner didn’t even bother to look twice when he called the cause of death a heart attack.  Bill had noticed the lack of hair, and that set me off.  It had been an accident, I always told myself.  Some deep seated anger had bubbled forth and I had lashed out without thinking it through.

John, on the other hand, was fairly athletic and in good health.  I was being far more careful then, but was just a bit neglectful one day while visiting John in his backyard.  I had removed my baseball cap to wipe some sweat away and John had seen.  John made an innocent comment, certainly, but it was still enough.  Overpowering him had been no easy task, but I managed somehow.  

I think John’s shock is what did him in.  Had he not realized something at the last moment, freezing him in place, it would have been my body hanging from that tree and not John’s.  Seeing his body twitch as I held the rope taunt left a haunting scar on my mind.

I sighed.  It was time.  I waited too long, enjoying this life too much.  I had to move on.  As I ran a hand over my bald head, smoothing the last few wispy strands of white hair, I could feel the familiar birthmark over my right ear.  I started for the door and caught myself in the mirror.  My blue eyes flashed.  Almost forgot a hat.  Don’t want to do that again.

I fished my cane from the stand and stepped out into the red sunlight.  It was a good day, I thought, grinning an all too wide grin..  I picked a direction, it didn’t matter which, and walked towards the waning red sun, my shadow stretching out long behind me.
