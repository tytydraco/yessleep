I was out late one night with nobody but my one friend, we can call her C. We were outside later than we expected after playing games all night in a small hut we built. 

We were getting bored and C proposed that we take a walk through the woods. I said sure and we started walking around. We have a large patch of woods near our houses and we thought it we be okay to walk in there. Oh were we wrong.

We started to walk through the woods and we were talking the usual, drama gossip about that one girl, and people that we didn't like. We were talking and we started talking about old tales and things in the unknown. When we were talking we didn't have our phones so nothing could be lit but with the small glow of glow sticks, again we were out playing games that night. We were looking to find a log or a downed tree to sit on but, to no avail. Everything was a grown tree so we didnt know where to sit. We found a pile of leaves and decided that would be a seat. We were just sitting until we heard a stick break.

We looked around for the sorce of the sound but found nothing. I suggested that we turn around and go back but C convinced me to stay. We sat in the light glow of the glow sicks and talked for what felt like an hour when we heard the slightest footstep. We both looked around and asked if anyone was there. Me and C aren't the poeple to get creeped out by that kind of stuff very easily so we just brushed it off as nothing. 

We used the glow sticks to light the way as we looked around for anthing that could be there and all we found was a hoof print next to somehting was was not quite human. C looked at it and said it was proably a horse and a person from earlier that day but I said there wasn't any rides that day. I know that there wasn't any rides here today, I thought to myself, I didn't see them enter the woods. I closely inspeced the hand print and C was looking around for the broken stick. 

C was looking and then we heard the blood-curdling scream from down the trail we found. We looked at eachother and figured oh a coyote no problem. I was looking at the prints closer and put my hand in the not-quite-human one and it was a total shock. The print that I saw is a slightly bigger hand than mine, but with the same marking and fingerprints. She looked horrified when the next scream broke out, sounding just like her but louder, way louder. See my friend was never a loud person so it scared me when she screamed like that, but it was like an echo when I heard the thing down there scream. I was terrified but I looked at her and made sure she was okay. She was scared but she told me she was okay. I was a bit worried about the look in her eyes. Being friends for 5 years, thats the look that tells me, I should be scared too. 

The thing sounded almost exactly like her. I yelled something back to it and it told me to come to it, that it wants to see me. I said "Why are you doing this to me C?" The thing said becuase I just don't need you anyomore. She looked at me with the most serious look on her face and said, It knows what I think, I knows what I see. I look at her and say, well good thing I don't need it either. She looks back at me and goes, We need to get out of here before- Shes gone. Some kind of substance on the ground. I cry but know I need to run for her. I run deep into the path and hear here screaming, quietly. I knew for a fact that that was her. 

I go into the woods. Shes there and I ask her the safe question. She gets the answer correct. Im happy and we sprint out of the woods. We see the light glow of the eyes on that monster. It screams as fire takes the body of it. Although, who was that and... Why do I feel a sence of fear aorund her now?
