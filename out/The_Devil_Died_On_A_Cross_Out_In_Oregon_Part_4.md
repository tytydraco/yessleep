John 19:30: “He said ‘It is finished!’ and He bowed his head and gave up His spirit.”

As soon as her blood ceased to fall from the black cross, so too had the snow exhausted itself. Her red dress nobly held what blood it could, but it did her no good. So exsanguinated was her body I thought it would float to Heaven if not for the nails, but her red dress fell like a comet to the ground. The snow caught her as softly as it could; it embraced her body warmly, but we took her easily, for she was not a corpse but a feather or a rose.

The ground was hard, but many hands made work light. Soon there was a place for her in the earth. 

“A mercy or disgrace, to remove the crown that pierced her?” We asked.

“Leave it. The regalia pains her no more.”

We had her buried in time for supper.

At supper, the sermon topic was Christ’s resurrection. We were told that Mary would rise again in the spring, just as Christ after being buried in his tomb rose again on Easter. Just as Christ’s rising from the dead signified his conquering of death and bestowed everlasting life on all who believed, so too would she do for us if only we were baptized in the lake with the angel and in her name. After supper we would go out to lake and be baptized with the angel as witness.

Dinner was joyful. They ate little and they ate quick to prepare for the lake. The director put on thick waiters to not freeze in the waters. They gathered towels and blankets to keep the newly baptized from freezing.

That chain that held our angel above the lake grew taught as we giddily walked in the gray dusk. I realized my time was nearly up. So I stopped, watching to see if in their glee they would notice me fade from the crowd. Only Jessica’s eyes turned back to me, giving me a knowing look. She shook her head, and continued with them.

Simple as that, I walked away, past the cabins, and the vans  and along the road from which we came in summer.

After night had fallen, towards the now distant lake I heard gunshots echo through the woods. First only a few, then a chorus, then a storm. I kept my face forward, afraid to look back. As quickly as the storm grew, it faded and passed.

After walking again in the night and in silence, “Hey kid! Stop right there!” Footsteps approached rapidly from behind. “Show me your hands! Hands!” I lifted my hands.

Once they were close behind I heard, “Turn around slowly kid, show us your eyes.” So I did. After examining my eyes with a flashlight, they put a bag over my head, zip tied my hands, and marched me again through the night.

The next day I recounted the events of those 6 months to men in black suits. They showed me pictures of the angel, of the cross, of the man in white robes, and the bodies of my friends whose eyes were now black as pitch. They told me I’d be among them if I had not left when I did.

They kept me warm and fed until summer when my stay at the camp would have ended. Then they flew me back home to my parents. At the airport, I repeated to my mother what the men in black suits had told me. I had a great year. I made great memories. The lake was beautiful. I’m glad to be home. 

I find it ironic: what sticks with me most. It's not the miracles, or rather the horrors. It’s the synchronicities; the gentle whispers that guided me there and safely back. I try to fathom the purpose of it all. Perhaps only to tell the tale.
