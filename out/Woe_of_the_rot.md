it all started a week ago. I was cycling on my bike, It was an old piece of junk that I got for cheap off of eBay. It wasn't exactly a glamorous ride, but it sure as hell beat walking.

The specific area that I live in is on the border of the countryside and the suburbs. The area is not exactly the safest place to be in, especially at night, and so I had my eyes scanning all over the place looking for any unusual shapes.

That's when I arrived at a four-way intersection a few streets away from my house, I slowed my bicycle down to check if there were any cars coming down the corner.

I think that's where I saw it for the first time. Out in the middle of the intersection was what seemed to be a piece of roadkill.

It was about the size of a goat, but at first, it didn't look like any specific kind of animal that I knew of, though maybe I could have chalked it up to the environment being low light.

When I saw that, I decided to It all happened three weeks ago. I was going home from work after my shift had ended. It was an hour to midnight and the sky was an unassuming tone of navy blue that contrasted pleasantly with the bright orange streetlights.

take a moment longer to get a better look. It looked like it had been there for weeks, although I was certain that it had not been there when I passed here this morning.

Its bones were almost picked clean were it not for the stray patches of skin and fur that loosely clung to its frame. Its skull looked like the skull of a predator, not particularly canine or feline, but the best way I could describe it would be if a horse had a dog's teeth.

For a short few seconds, I stared into it's empty eye sockets and felt a cold sharp feeling in my gut. After those seconds of observation, I decided it was enough and started pedaling past it to get home before midnight.

When I did finally get home, I did all the usual rituals. You know, stuff like undressing, taking a shower, putting on some YouTube in the background and making myself something to eat.

I got myself a skillet, some butter and eggs as I got ready to make scrambled eggs. I turned the stove on and slowly covered the pan in the molten butter.

That's when I noticed something unusual. I cracked the first egg and was immediately greeted with an unpleasant smell, alongside the realization that the egg was rotten. At first, I thought it was just one bad egg, but after cleaning my skillet and trying it again, I was devastated to discover that all my eggs were rotten.

I didn't know how that was possible, but all 20 of them had gone bad. Aside from the devastating financial loss, I was also quite hungry, so I decided to reach for the only other thing in my kitchen that could be considered an effort-free meal: a box of cereal. As I filled my bowl and went to get my milk jug, I was horrified to discover that it had spoiled. I was getting quite confused at that point. had my fridge given out at the time I was out of the house? It couldn't be because if that had happened the ice would have melted. Either way, that was a concern for future me, current Me gave a very limited amount of fucks and just wanted to have a bite and turn his brain off until he decided it was a good enough time to doze off to sleep. As such, I ended up having dry cereal and water for dinner.

The next morning, I woke up feeling like I had gotten no sleep at all. My neck hurt and I had a mild headache. What little will I had was used to push my body off the bed and into my feet. The floor felt cold, too cold for my liking, but I merely pushed through the

Unpleasant feeling. I shambled my way to the bathroom so that I could take a warm shower and freshen up. The warm water washed over my shoulders and slowly shook me from my sleepy daze.

I got out of the shower and got dressed for the day before making my way towards the kitchen to scout for something that could be considered nourishing, however, as I gazed into my pantry I was only met with a sleeve of graham crackers and some assorted foods that I was

Simply not patient enough to cook, so after putting the crackers in my bag and having a glass of water to clear my mind, I got out trough the back door and locked it securely, then i set off to work on my bike.

On the way to work, I noticed someone had already cleared that piece of roadkill from the middle of that intersection near my home. I couldn't imagine who would have the courage to even touch that thing, Just imagining having to drag  it elsewhere made me gag a little.

As I got to the office, I noticed that the building's air conditioner was turned off. When I asked the boss, he told me that it was smelling weird and that he was going to have a maintenance guy have a look at it after lunch. He told me that there was a fan in the back room that I could use in the meantime.

I wasn't thrilled to hear that, but since the day was not that hot, I decided to just go fetch the fan. As I got settled in my office and started to work, I noticed the room started to smell a bit moldy. At first, I tried to ignore it and work through it, but soon my throat started to itch and breathing became a little bit more taxing. That's when I realized I was having an asthma attack. I haven't had one of these in years, but I suppose sitting here like a moron and breathing in mold spores did the trick.

I decided to go talk to my boss about the mold problem and also the fact that I was currently having respiratory issues. My boss is by no means an unreasonable guy and when he saw that I was having trouble, he sent me home earlier. He also handed me an inhaler. He told me that his son has chronic asthma and that he keeps an inhaler in his bag in case of an emergency. I could not thank him enough for that, however I did not want to spend even a second longer In that building, and as such, I made my way out of there with speeds comparable to an Olympic athlete .

As I was retrieving my bicycle, I decided that Before heading home, I would go get groceries because I was short on pretty much everything. On the way there, I was making mental notes on what exactly I was missing: eggs, milk, vegetables and such things, maybe I would even get myself a little treat to keep me on my feet.

as i got to the market i chained my bike on a nearby pole and made my way inside, mindlessly grabbing a shopping basket on my way to the shopping aisles.

the air in the supermarket felt moist and damp like a cardboard box, in fact, old cardboard was one of the most prevalent scents there, with notes of dirt that were just faint enough to not comment on but not enough so that your mind can ignore it.

i was idly browsing the canned goods isle when i remembered that i in fact did not have all day to spend looking at jars of pickled mushrooms, my basket had almost everything i was in need of except for some vegetables, as such, i decided to go to the produce section in hopes of rectifying that.

while there i was picking up a few carrots for a stew when noticed something strange, all of the carrots were becoming soft, then they started to become mushy. as soon as i saw that i was quite unsettled, but that was only the beginning of my horror because as soon as i looked away i noticed that the apples were visibly going putrid even though not a second ago they were beautifully ripe.

 as I look back at my hands, I am shocked to discover that the carrot I was holding was now merely a gooey, dark orange puree. As I dropped it and stumbled back, I felt my elbow touch something round and soft, kind of like a water balloon but just a little more firm, as I turned to acknowledge it though, something else caught my attention, as I looked at them, all the greens had turned a sickly dark yellow all within seconds in a motion similar to a wave, as if they were being affected by an invisible aura. 

I did not have time to observe it though as I realized that that soft unseen object was in fact a very,putrid watermelon, which burst as my elbow put pressure on it\`s soft exterior, immediately splattering me with it\`s juices, which stained my shirt and soaked the side of my pants with a fluid of which the word vile would be unworthy of describing just how unpleasant it was.

Its density was thin and watery but he scent was absolutely awful, it was like if you spilled yogurt inside of a hot car and let it ferment in there for the whole afternoon, but that was only the liquid that was currently staining my clothes, because the smell of the room around me felt way, way worse, the aroma of old cardboard had been replaced by a hodgepodge of rotting smells from multiple kinds of fruit, which combined to make a sickly, thick aroma.

as soon as the realization of my current situation hit me i just dropped my shopping basket and bolted out of there, which was a stupid fucking decision because the floor was currently covered in very slippery watermelon goop which caused me to slip and fall on my ass, that was now also soaked in that thin fluid.

after that absolute fiasco i decided to miserably speed walk towards the exit instead while doing my best to not to whimper like a kicked puppy, then i got up on my bike and cycled off towards my home completely unable to process what just happened.

After what took place inside that convenience store, I was scared shitless. My mind was going a million miles a second trying to find a logical explanation as to why everything inside that market turned to mush in the blink of an eye, but no reasonable explanation came to my mind.

After what felt like an eternity stuck in thought, I finally got snapped out of it by a loud car horn. I had almost gotten run over by a guy in a yellow pickup truck. He yelled something about seeing where I was going and called me a slur before driving off with a scowl on his face.

I was already exhausted by that point because of all that took place today and I was feeling both sticky and miserable, so I didn't even pay him any mind. All that I could think about was a warm shower and comfy bed.

As I reached my home, I put away my bike in the backyard and entered through the back door. As soon as I did, I realized that something was not right. I didn't use my keys on it and yet it was open. Had I forgotten to lock the door? No, I have vivid memories of me locking it just a few hours ago. That's when I realized someone could have broken into my home. 

After that realization, I quickly drew out my pocket knife and held it tightly in my right hand while my left hand looked for the light switch. After a second or two of frantic searching, I finally managed to turn the light on, which revealed something that I found most displeasing. 

My usually clean white kitchen floor tiles were stained with long tracks of mud and many of my dishes and silverware were broken and strewn about. It was as if a hurricane had come through here. The adrenaline was rushing over me and, ignoring all common sense, I decided to investigate deeper to see if any intruders were still inside the house. 

As I took a few more steps into the house, I felt a concerning aroma. It was like the forest on a rainy day. If it were in different circumstances, I would possibly even find the smell to be pleasant, but not here, and especially not now. First, I looked into the living room, it was absolutely trashed, my couch, which I worked very hard for, was covered in dirt and decomposing leaves, the carpet, which just this morning was a nice and pleasant off white was now stained and filthy, like a white poodle that just played in the mud.

Next, I made my way to my bedroom. As I braced upon its closed door, I was not prepared for the absolute fowl odor that was about to assault my nostrils. I pushed the door open, and immediately the smell hit me like a concussive blast. It was horrible, the air tasted sweet and made my eyes water. It was a powerful and overwhelming scent, but it wasn't as simple as that. It was as if someone had taken a Thanksgiving turkey and left it in the dinner table untouched until February. I immediately gagged involuntarily before dumping this morning's cereal all over my already ruined shoes.

I then looked around for the source of the smell only to quickly find that there were several animal carcasses laid out in a pile directly on top of my bed. 

Needless to say, I was practically frozen, all my hair stood on end, and my muscles tensed like they never did before in my life. All I could do was stand there and look at the scene before me. Multiple kinds of rotten animal carcasses, all arranged in a formation that sorts them by size. In the center there was the body of what seemed to be the same odd carcass which I had seen on the street yesterdat, while at its sides were several smaller animals: racoons, dogs, possums and a handful more that I simply cannot recall. It was truly terrifying to see, and my most immediate thought was that I was going to get added to that pile very soon if I did not act quickly. 

I immediately turned around to the other side of the room and opened a small wardrobe where I quickly pushed aside some clothes to reveal a small safe. I hastily inputted the code and opened the safe, which housed a small handgun and a loaded magazine, which I rapidly inserted into the weapon and chambered a round, after which I then immediately turned around again, only to discover that,to my horror, In the span of no more than thirty seconds, all those bodies were simply gone, as if they had vanished or slipped away in perfect silence, leaving only a deep red stain where they were once placed. As I stood there and considered turning the gun on myself to avoid having to deal with whatever the hell that was, I was interrupted by the sound of even more dishes breaking in the kitchen.

As I rushed out of my bedroom in hopes of catching whatever the hell that was on it\`s way out, I saw something which I think no man should ever have to witness. they were standing on the door to the backyard, all the bodies that were once motionless on top of my bed were all moving in unison, joined at odd angles by what seemed to be vines and branches, all arranged in a vaguely humanoid shape that towered over me, the body of the strange animal was acting as a kind of torso while the carcasses of the smaller animals acted as limbs, it moved in an exaggerated and clumsy manner, like a rag doll being puppeted by string.

As soon as I caught sight of it, a primal fear overtook me as I raised my handgun and pointed it at the abomination\`s center, my finger on the trigger as we both stood still for what felt like ages, until the creature finally broke the stalemate by taking a step towards me. it\`s “feet” if you could even call them that made a wet squelching noise as it made contact with the ground. 

That was all the incentive I needed to start making holes into that thing like It was a boat and I was a duct tape salesman. I quickly fired off all fifteen shots of nine millimeter right into it.

My ears were ringing and the muzzle flash was burned into my retinas as I felt the slide on my handgun hold open. the only thing worse than the tension of the moment where I waited for my vision to readjust to the lighting in the room was the abject Terror of realizing that all the bullets just went straight through the rotting abomination without doing even as little as making it flinch.

As I stood there in awe awe and paralyzed by fear, the abomination made another clumsy step, it\`s body leaking mixed fluids through the fresh bullet holes and leaving a trail behind it.

I felt the corners of my vision start to darken as it closed the distance between us, I could hear it take deep and gurgled breaths even though im pretty sure it did not need to breathe. My legs felt weak and my heart thumped so hard that I was sure it would pop like a balloon any second now. As it stood not even a meter away from me, it raised one of it\`s appendages, it was comprised of three different animals: a possum, a raccoon and what seemed to be a house cat, all in various states of decay. As it did so, my legs gave out and I dropped to my knees. I felt as if it was taking the very energy from within my bones as the ringing in my ears became overpoweringly loud and my vision faded out like an incandescent light turning off.

i awakened in a hospital bed two days later. as i would later come to discover, apparently the neighbours had called the cops after they heard the gunshots. the police had found me uncouncious on the floor surrounded by bullet casings and chunks of flesh and ripped fur. needless to say they had several questions for me that i simply could now awnser. i am currently still in the hospital, the doctor says if all goes well ill be discharged tomorrow morning, the doctor explained to me that as it turns out i had suffered from methane poisoning, however he assured me that the damage would not be permanent.

as of now i am fearing for my life and i would really appreciate any advice for my current situation, especially given it\`s extremelt unusual circumstances.
