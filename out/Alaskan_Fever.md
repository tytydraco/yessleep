It's easy to overlook the signs of your body needing medical attention. Minor back pain or a slight cough, if left unchecked, can rapidly alter into a mass spread epidemic of uncontrollable proportion. In an Alaskan mountain village, in which my practice is based, this outcome is by all accounts a death sentence for all our residents. Some of you may find it strange how I referenced back pain as being the equivalent of a village death sentence, but in our case, a hunter or fisherman put out of the job for a few weeks means that everyone will suffer. It is for this reason that my role as village doctor is one which I take very seriously provided the outcome of negligence can equally lead to my own downfall. I've recently encountered an illness that I am unable to recognise or identify via the symptoms displayed.

 

The reach my practice exceeds is limited to the villagers and any injured hikers. For this reason, I am not well versed in more specialised diseases such as cancer and tuberculosis. Instead, my expertise lies in conditions such as the examples I listed above with things such as back pain, colds, fevers, flu and the most severe being hypothermia but this is less common than you would think. The village is rather small, consisting of around 15 buildings made up of homes, schools, markets, and a church. I can't stress enough that despite the titles these buildings hold they are nothing more than a miniaturized recreation of the real thing. The school is around the size of a single classroom that you would find in England which is where I'm from and this is the same for all other institutes including my clinic which is made up of a waiting room and a single consultation room along with a medical equipment and pharmaceutical storage unit. The reason I stress this fact is due to my fears that this disease could hold the potential to spread rapidly throughout the village if I fail in my commitments to identify and eradicate it. Beneath are excerpts from my diary. These should paint a picture of when the disease first occurred.

The weather was nicer today than yesterday, but my ankle still hurts from when I walked Benjy in the woods. I contacted the natives today to trade bandages and plasters for herbal remedies since Mrs Nelson refuses to take anything "manmade". She seems in better spirits as of late and she mentioned that her stomach pain is beginning to cease.

 

Seeing the neighbour's kids playing around outside has made me realise just how much I miss Lisa. I loved her for her smile, her laugh, and the way she made me feel, but I never stopped to think that a part of that love was for the promising future she fed me each night about starting a family and moving up here in the first place. I miss her every day, and it never gets better.

 

I walked Benjy twice today, or more hobbled after him as he darted in between the trees. We did our normal route today past the stump, over the bridge and then looping back around when we reached the wet patch which is beginning to dry a little. Hopefully, the good weather is consistent enough so that me and Benjy can start our longer walks again. I saw a deer today in the tree line by the bridge. Haven't seen one in a while, makes me feel as if I may have been struck with a streak of luck, but I can only wait and see how the weather holds up.

 

On a more serious note, I was contacted by Mountain Rescue today regarding a hiker who has been missing for the past two days. They told me that the hiker was a young man estimated to be around the age of 20-30 and had called Mountain Rescue which the team managed to record. Unfortunately, this is the only lead the rescue team has to go off of. They asked if I could look at the recording and give them an estimation as to what condition he could currently be in as well as give them an idea as to how much time they had left to find him before he could be ruled out as dead. The recording was largely a concoction of static and intermittent mumbling which was incomprehensible due to the sound of wind that backdropped the audio. The only things I could make out were the word "Head", a sort of moan of pain, and then the sound of cracking and snapping before the call gave out. I told them that I believed the man may have become lost before being caught in a storm given the wind and the sound of what I believed to be branches snapping against the force of the wind as well as beneath the hiker as he tried to find his way out. The hiker saying the word "head" could mean he had suffered a head injury and granted it wasn't too severe, the rescue team should have another day or so to find him. I only hope he's experienced. I don't want to see another young man suffer the consequences of frostbite again this year.

Weather held up so the wet patch has dried enough now for me and Benjy to extend our walk to the boulders. They say lightning doesn't strike twice in the same spot, but I can't help but feel like this week is going to be one for the memory books since I saw another deer in the same spot as yesterday. I can't believe my luck!

 

Mrs Nelson told me at her consultation that her stomach pain has gone which is always good to hear, but she's said she's been feeling a little down since her husband Tom didn't come home last night. I feel bad for her. It's not easy being married to a mountain rescue officer and I suspect my words played an equal part in the all-night search the overseer instructed. It's times like this that I realise I would never have been cut out for that sort of work. Trudging through the mud and trees all hours of the day only to bunker down in a dingey checkpoint bed miles away from home really doesn't float my boat.

 

The store's shipment was late, so I had to settle on a bowl of porridge for my tea using some powdered milk which I rehydrated. Benjy doesn't seem to know the struggle. I sometimes wish I had the same memory span as him so I could forget what I ate the day before and enjoy the same meal the very next day over and over again. Rereading that it just sounds like I want dementia.

Hit with a storm during the night so I was unable to take Benjy into the woods given how muddy the paths have become. I opted to take him along to one of my house visits. I'm grateful for the fact everyone here loves him otherwise I wouldn't know what to do right about now.

 

Tom was escorted home early this morning by Mountain Rescue due to concerns surrounding his condition. Mrs Nelson called me to take a look. She greeted me at the door and had clearly been crying before I came. I asked if she was okay, but she replied with a quick nod before wiping the tears from her eyes with a tissue. She escorted me into their bedroom and took Benjy into the living room downstairs while flicking on the TV. As far as physical competence, Tom is in his prime and well-built. He doesn't seem to have suffered any falls or scrapes while in the woods. Mentally, however, Tom appears severely disturbed. For the hour-long consultation, Tom remained mute. He didn't verbally reply to anything I had to say. I asked if he was in pain to which he nodded. I asked him to point on his body where the pain was located to which he pointed at his head. It became clear to me why he had been rubbing his head periodically. I provided him a pen and paper and asked him to write down any other symptoms he was experiencing. He struggled to hold the pen and write on the page, but after a grueling 2 minutes he managed to scrawl out the word "Voices".

 

I've prescribed him painkillers for his headache, but I suspect he may be experiencing an abnormal case of hypothermia which may have taken effect primarily within his cognitive ability leading to issues surrounding confusion and perception. I didn't stay long since after coming downstairs with Tom Benjy began whimpering and trying to cover his ears with his paws. I think he may have heard something outside which disturbed him which isn't any wonder given Tom and Debby live close to the village's power generator. The monotone buzzing probably sounded like the most terrifying thing imaginable to a dog. Luckily Benjy appeared in better spirits after we left.

Today's events are all a blur, but I'll try to commit everything down to paper. Tom's condition has significantly worsened to a degree of unrecognizability. His head has tripled in size.

 

I was unable to walk Benjy this morning since I received a call from Mrs Nelson requesting urgent care for her husband. She was frantic, hysteric, her voice was almost incomprehensible as her words rapidly fluttered down the line. I didn't understand half of what she said but I recognise the sound of desperation. When I arrived at the house Debby was already at the door running up her drive to meet me. She was a mess of snot and tears, but she managed to say, "It's Tom... he's not right!"

 

I've seen a lot over the years. A man with his leg trapped under a fallen tree, a hiker impaled on his own walking stick, flu, colds, headaches, back pain, but I have never seen this in all my years of medical school. He was still alive, moans of pain escaping his lips every few seconds as his head pulsed. He was laid facing up in bed, his head propped atop a pillow with all the lamps on and positioned to face him. He looked monstrous. The brow of his head protruded out over his eyes encasing them, so he didn't notice I was in the room. His head was a mess of protruding bone, his skin stretched tight around the shards acting as his internal body's last defense to being completely exposed. His head throbbed periodically, the mass of his brain sinking low creating deep crevices around the fragments of his skull before expanding causing his skin to stretch and split ever so slightly. I alerted him to my presence, but I dont think he could hear me. No matter how loud I shouted "Tom!" "Tom I'm here!". He didn't respond. I think a part of his skull had penetrated his ear drums or at least the pressure of his expanding brain had suppressed my voice reverberating in his ears.

 

I was drenched in sweat, my racing heart pounding in my ears. I was, and still am, at a complete loss. I didn't know what to do for him. When I reached my arm out to his he began thrashing and screaming, the weight of his head keeping him pinned only causing him to scream more in pain.

 

I contacted the Providence Alaska medical Center and they agreed to fly out in an air ambulance to transport Tom to keep him under their care. I don't have the necessary treatment to help him here. Debby accompanied him in the helicopter after thanking me.

 

On a lighter note, the weather's been nice today, so I hope I'll be able to take Benjy in the woods tomorrow. God knows he'll be tired of walking around the gravel streets.

Met with the natives again today. They asked for painkillers for the first time. It's nice to see that they're coming around to what I have to offer besides just bandages. They didn't have anything else to trade since they told me they were in desperate need of all their remedies. They've been extremely helpful for the duration of my time here, so I didn't mind. I told them if they needed anything else all they need to do is ask.

 

The ground felt drier today after coming down the mountain, so I was able to take Benjy into the woods by the time I got back. I feel bad not taking him with me to see the natives, but I feel like he'll struggle clambering over the rocks to reach them.

 

Benjy seemed to enjoy his walk sniffing various plants and sprinting back and forth towards me, but something strange happened in the woods which continues to play on my mind. I saw another deer today. It was actually in the exact same spot as my previous encounters this week. I can't help but think it could be the same one. It remained rooted to the spot. It didn't even move when I walked up to it. It snorted heavily as I approached and his body began to tremble slightly, but it never moved. Never bolted, turned its head, or closed its eyes. Its eyes were almost frightening. Wide and unblinking, streaks of red surrounding the corners. It appeared frail. I don't think it had eaten in a while. In fact, now that I think about it, it sort of looked like when a deer gets caught in a car’s headlights. Turned to stone in motionless fear. Whatever it saw out there must have really spooked it.

 

I don't know why but I wrapped my arms around its head to hug it. I thought it would calm it down, but it didn't. It remained the same as when I approached it, but I began to hear a different sound. I couldn't see its lips as I positioned my head beside its ear, but I swear I heard it mumble something. I darted back my eyes wide with shock, but it didn't make the sound again. Shaking, I embraced it once again. It didn't make a sound but as soon as my head became level with its ear, the mumbling came back. It sounded as if someone were talking on the other side of a brick wall. The sound of Benjy's whimpers broke my focus as I retreated from the deer. My body trembling I struggled to catch my breath. Benjy was staring at the deer beside me. Whimpering loudly and trying to cover his ears. Nothing about that walk felt right. My heart racing I took off in full sprint alongside Benjy as we ran like bats out of hell back to our cabin.

 

I didn't have many consultations today which I'm glad about. After that walk, I don't think I could take much of hearing other people's issues.

I was hesitant to take Benjy into the woods this morning, but what we saw only strengthened the fears I hold for our village's fate. After yesterday's encounter, I paid more attention to my surroundings. There are more deer in those woods than the one by the bridge. There are hundreds. Close, far, some just dots in the distance. All of them remain motionless. The one I saw yesterday has yet to move. Whatever they saw, whatever they were suffering from, is outside my realm of reality. I don't know if we caught it from them or them us, but more of Mountain Rescue have returned home. They've all been escorted off the Mountain by their team before being left at home and their colleagues venturing back into the mountain. Everyone escorted is suffering from headaches. I'm terrified by the events in store for our village. I can't abandon them in this state. Lisa would never forgive me after I meet her in the afterlife. Has anyone encountered this sort of thing before? I could really do with your help.
