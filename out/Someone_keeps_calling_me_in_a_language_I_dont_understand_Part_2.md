I’m back, even though I wish I didn’t need to be. If you don’t know, I made a post detailing my first two encounters with whatever keeps calling me in a language I can’t understand. [Part One is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/LMH3MKgKzb). Thank you to the generous person who pointed out that “Woah Beast Do” is wo bist du, German for where are you. That unsettles me even further, given the following events. 

Wednesday night was no better than the previous two days. I woke up from another few hours of dreamless sleep, sweating despite the AC blasting in my bedroom. I was on my back, a terrible position to be in if you have ever experienced sleep paralysis. It was 3:00 a.m, that dreadful hour. 

My phone started to buzz. I ignored it this time. Damn these stupid calls at ungodly hours. Probably scammers anyways. 

It buzzed, and buzzed, and buzzed.

It seemed to go on forever. Since when did calls ring for this long? I swear, it was so bad I started to get a headache, one of those nasty cluster ones behind the eye. 

This went on for what felt like hours. I tried to close my eyes, but every time I did images of something watching me popped up in the darkness. I tried to cover my ears, but a ringing would start every time I did. I even declined the incoming call, but it would only stop for about 5 seconds before the ringing started again. 

I covered my face with a pillow and let out a muffled scream. Someone had to have sold my number on the dark web, or is purposely doing this because I pissed them off or something. It had to be that. I wanted to cry. I wanted to sleep. 

Uncovering my face was the worst decision I could’ve made at that moment. It was getting hot under that pillow, and the ringing from my phone finally stopped, so I decided it was time to grow up, take heavier pills, and fall asleep. When I did so, I found myself gawking at the ceiling.

Five tiny eyes had sprouted from the ceiling, slowly blinking at me in sync. They were all bloodshot, some of them having puss welling up at the head of their infected eyelashes. A drop of that disgusting off white liquid fell from the ceiling right onto my cheek. 

I went to scream. My vocal cords cut out. All that came out was a measly, strained noise, like some dying animal. I felt like a dying animal. 

The buzzing from my phone came back. Suddenly, I was jolted awake, laying on my back once again. There were no eyes on the ceiling, no puss on my cheek—the only thing leftover was a headache, the stabbing kind. I didn’t go back to sleep that night. 

Thursday was a messy, sleep deprived day. I didn’t get a call all day, until about 6:45 p.m that night. I’ll once again try and transcribe the interaction I had, as much as it makes the constant headache I now have worse. 

The phone rang at 6:45 p.m. I ignored it. I hadn’t been in my bedroom all day since the events of the previous night, and I’d been wary of my phone, only answering my mom’s daily check-in call that I ended early, as much as it breaks my heart to be short with her. 

The phone rang again at 6:47 p.m. This time, I answered. I don’t know what compelled me to answer. I think a part of my logical brain rationalized that if someone was calling twice in a row, they obviously needed to reach me for something. 

The only thing that greeted me upon answering was silence. This went on for about 5 seconds before I heard shuffling, and then a man started to talk—except, nothing intelligible. It was all a garble of noises and phrases from different languages; a little Japanese there, some Turkish there. He sounded…angry? But I couldn’t decipher what he was saying, none of the phrases I could translate made any sense together, he was saying stuff like “I will eat” and “You will come.” 

Somewhere in the long rant, I caught the words “ton nom—“ your name, in French. I was puzzled, and on pure instinct I responded. “Mon nom? Pourquoi?” 

The voice on the other end fell eerily silent. I couldn’t even hear static. After ten seconds, I almost hung up before the person on the other end suddenly spoke again. 

“Ton. Nom.” If the person sounded angry before, they sounded downright enraged now. 

I grasped for words before finally responding. “Marie. Que veux-tu?” What do you want? I assumed that if I spoke in a language they understood, I’d finally get some answers.
 
The line went dead. Whoever was on the other line hung up. They must’ve realized they had the wrong number, I rationalized. Yet, there was something in the back of my mind that I couldn’t shake—the feeling that I had just done something very, very wrong. 

That night I had another nightmare. This time, the eyes were back, though they covered every wall in my bedroom, and there was a figure wreathed in shadow at the edge of my bed. 

The figure reached out, tapping its long, bony fingers against the blankets near where my feet lay. It spoke in tongues—well, not tongues, because at least that language is based on an actual African language that could be discerned as human. This was distinctly not human, like the chattering of a hungry animal. 

“Marieeeeee,” it called out with a gravelly voice, before it made a coughing noise. This time, when it spoke again, it sounded distinctly feminine. “Marie. Marieeeeee.” 

I swear, it almost sounded exactly like my voice.

All I remember after that was an incessant whispering in my ears, and the fingers moving closer until they wrapped around my ankle and tugged. When it did so, I woke up, my blankets in a tangle around my ankles. 

I hope you understand my plight now, because it is finally Friday, and things aren’t any better. I think I made a terrible mistake. I don’t know. The calls won’t stop, and I swear I can hear whispers from around the corners of my apartment. Something is after me, and it wants to know where I am. I just want my mother, but I can’t trust my phone enough to call, and I can’t leave. 

I can’t leave because someone is outside my door, and has been since I woke up.
