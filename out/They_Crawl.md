I’m a father. Or at least I was. After today’s events I no longer know who I am.  I’m so, so, broken.





Sleep was something that had returned to my life. Compared to in the infant months of restless nights it was heaven having a two year old. But it was with mixed feelings that our son, Mikey, was finally old enough for daycare. 





Myself and my wife missed him a little, for the few hours each day he was away. We both work from home and the house felt a little empty without him. 





But otherwise all was fine, until today. 





2pm rolled around and Jen asked me to bring some butter home as I headed out to pick up Mikey.





It all went downhill from there. First was the flat tyre. I rolled over a piece of wood with a nail in it that must have fallen off a truck. I had the spare on in no time, but I would be late to pick up Mikey and that frustrated me.





I guess I was a little embarrassed arriving late, as if this made me a bad parent. Mikey himself wouldn’t mind or even notice, he’d be engrossed with the extensive collection of toys there. 





When I pulled up at the daycare, 30 minutes late, I was surprised to see a lot of cars in the lot. But the little playground outside was empty.





When I entered the small one story building all was quiet. 





A large woman who usually mans the front desk was gone. Left for the day maybe.





I let myself through into the hallway. It was also empty. A tricycle sat there, abandoned under the pale strip lights. 





As I walked further down the hall I called out.





‘Hello?’





 My voice was loud in the silence. 





And then I stopped, frozen in my tracks. On the ground in front of me was a footprint. It was red. It was blood? I couldn’t be sure but it was not a child’s footprint. 





I tried not to panic. It’s dye or it’s paint or it’s jam. I told myself all the harmless things it could be. And I pushed away the invasive thoughts of kidnapping and mass murder and shooters. But I was now too afraid to call out…. Although every part of me wanted to scream Mikey’s name. 





And then at the end of the hall, movement. A small form crawled quickly out of one door and into another. 





The silence broken only by the creak of the door, as it swung open and closed again. 





I hurried forward towards the door where the child had disappeared. 





When I got to the door, I looked through the small glass panel but the lights were off.





I quietly pushed the door open and felt for the switch on the wall. When I found it, dozens of eyes turned in my direction. Child eyes reacting to the light. And under the children were corpses. Parents.. the daycare staff, Debbie the large woman from reception. All lifeless and soaked in their own blood. 





The children’s mouths were red too. As if they’d been feeding, feeding on the adults. 





I felt puke rise up from my stomach. But I held it in. I had no time to be sick. One of the kids broke away from its meal and scurried on all fours towards me.





I slammed the door in her face. Like hell that thing was getting near me. 





I peered back through the glass. The little girl was  banging her head on the door trying to get at me.





THUNK-





THUNK-





THUNK-





The other children crawled over to join her. I searched desperately with my eyes, Mikey wasn’t there. 





The banging was increasing. Faster, more heads. So I ran for it.





I checked other doors as I hurried through the hall. Behind me the tiny but somehow very speedy mob of toddlers crawled after me. 





I had to be quick. Where was Mikey? I tripped over the damn trike. Banding my knee badly and twisting something in my ankle. I yelled out in pain but was up again. Now limping. 





I entered the closest door and shut it behind me. There was no lock, so I jammed a chair under the handle.





The only full sized chair in the room, it was a playroom. Everything else was child sized. Including the child who sat facing away from me in the centre of the playroom floor.





Mikey? 





The kid turned toward me. Not Mikey, he was Asian, with a bowl cut. His mouth bloody, his pupils large and black like grapes. 





He stood and waddled towards me. And I’m so ashamed but out of fear I kicked out with my good leg, and I booted that small child. He flew a few meters across the room tumbling through wooden blocks and stuffed toys. 





But in a moment he was upright again, like a cat, like nothing happened. He came running back towards me. 





I grabbed the chair from under the door and pulled it open.





I used the chair as a shield from the swarm outside the door. Pushing the savages out of the way. The chair leg caught a chubby kid in the eye and he growled at me like a feral dog. I felt terrible, did I hurt him? Then kid grabbed the chair leg and somehow wrenched it from my grasp.





Shocked by their strength, I retreated as best I could on my busted ankle. They were quick but their legs: little. 





The last door left unexplored were the toilets. 





Once inside there was nothing to block the door with. Just three stalls and a couple miniature urinals. 





I pushed open the first stall and there he was. Mikey, my boy, my angel. But he was different. He sat there quietly on the toilet, gnawing on something. 





‘Mikey’ I said. ‘It’s daddy.’





He barely looked up, but enough for me to see that his eyes had changed too and that he was chewing on a dismembered ear. 





The swarm was coming through the door from the hall now.





I shut the little stall door locking me and Mikey inside. Heartbroken, my eyes full of tears, I tried to stroke Mikey’s hair.





In return, he lunged and tried to go for my neck. After a prolonged struggle and many scratches, I managed to restrain him with my sweater. I can’t bear to see him like this, hog-tied on the floor. Writing around furiously. The other kids banging on the stall door. 





There’s no way out and I’ll have to call for help soon. I just wanted to spend a little more time with my only boy.
