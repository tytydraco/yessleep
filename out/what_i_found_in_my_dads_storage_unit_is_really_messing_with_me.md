I (24F) have made a discovery this week that has made me seriously rethink everything i thought i knew about my family it has been fucking with my mind since I found it. 

 March 3rd, 2005

As a child I would often wake up with dead mice on my bed at least once a week and I would always see a tall figure and a cat mask with a camera.  I told my parents about this but they always told me it was just our cat Binks I always sort of  doubted this in the back of my mind as every time I saw this figure  it had white fur on the mask despite our cat being Orange-haired  and the mice would always have deep cuts and wounds seemingly way too precise and straight for a cat. but my parents would always write this off as some weird dream and just our cat leaving dead mice as cats sometimes do.

 After years of this happening it stopped when I turned 13. After that I started to become more rational and just sort of believed my parents when they said it was just a dream in our cat leaving the mice on my bed.

I would think of this every once in a while, but always push it back into the farthest recesses of my mind whenever anything else to think about came up I always assumed it was just some funny childhood story about me misunderstanding what I was seeing at night and that was the end of it until now

 this past Thursday my father died of a massive heart attack I was struggling with grief   I was never close to my father though I seem to be a rift between us but it was still sad the wake and funeral came and passed with nothing very interesting until after the will came out 

My mother got the house car most of the money my brother got his old collection of Trinkets and the old 40 been restoring for the last few years before his death he loves that car it started off as just a rusty old hunk of metal but he slowly into a working vehicle well something resembling a normal vehicle was still very Rusty and ratchet

  all that he left me in the will of course the storage unit included with a note that red is the follows " my dearest daughter Elena I left you the storage unit to contains a lot of my childhood items family photos and stuff that I found important enough to keep I'll leave it all to you to do with as you please just please take care of any family photos or important family documents and  when you find me and your mother's wedding VHS please give it to her " 

I thought nothing of it just a bunch of stuff left to me to give me at least something in the will or something like that.  I went to the unit last night and it seems very normal I started to clear out stuff deeming what was trash and what was some value to keep until I got to an old dresser and back of the storage unit it was full of family photos cards my grandfather's old rifle and  my father's collection of baseball cards from when he was a kid as well as the VHS of him and my mom's wedding it seems like it was full of his most sentimental items. 

 I thought it was cool until I found the old box labeled “ my Elena”  inside was the four items that have caused me to rethink  everything I thought I knew about my childhood It was very dusty with  just  four  old items a stack of Polaroids pictures of me in my bed  some of me sleeping some of me awake  as well as  petco card Rusty  red stained old scalpel and a white cat mask.
