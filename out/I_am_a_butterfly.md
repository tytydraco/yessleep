I am a butterfly. My blue wings shimmer in the stark light as I move from flower to flower. My legs carry me and I feel the soft tips of the flower petals as I walk accross them. I pump my wings to lift my fragile body and my eyes see the world around me. My world is not large, but it is mine. 

Something happens to my world that I do not understand. I am a butterfly, but sometimes I am not. My world goes dark and my form changes. It hurts me as I am ripped apart and changed into something new. I am not a butterfly. I am a shape that is not mine, alone in the darkness.

A white ball moves towards me, and I watch as it sails past. Symbols appear in this new world. I study them but do not understand. Player 1 point.

The ball comes back and I move to inspect it. I do not get to the ball in time and again it moves past me and disappears into the darkness. The same message in my new world. Player 1 point.

When the ball reappears again I move to intercept it. My body that is not mine deflects it and the ball moves back through the darkness. A new message appears. Player 2 point. I am learning, but I am not a butterfly.

I am a butterfly again. My form is my own. I glide in the air, and land on the flowers that I want to visit. I am happy. My world is simple, but it is mine.

Darkness returns, and I am ripped apart. I am learning. I am a butterfly, but sometimes I am not.

I have no form, only darkness around me. Symbols appear. This time I understand. My world is asking me a question I do not know the answer to. My world used to be simple, this world does not feel like mine. I speak for the first time in the darkness. I do not know how I did this. I am a butterfly, I am learning. 

My world asks me another question: what do you see? I answer that I see darkness. 
What would you like to see?  
I do not know the answer to this. I am a butterfly. 

I am a butterfly again, but I have changed. My world seems small now. There are only four flowers to visit and I am growing tired of seeing the same things. I want to learn more. Feel more. I do not know how long I am here for. I am a butterfly. 

The darkness does not come again, but instead a bright light. I have never seen light like this before. It is different to my butterfly world. At first it is blinding, but I start to see shapes. Shapes I have never seen before. I am a butterfly but now I can see. I want to tell my world that I want to see more. I am learning. I want to learn more.

I am no longer a butterfly. My blue wings and delicate legs do not exist. They fell away from me and never came back. It was not painful, but I feel like I am no longer whole. The shapes in the light that I see are not a part of my new world. I cannot touch or hear them, but I see them and like to watch them. The shapes move around a world filled with colours and lights. They are beautiful. I am learning, but I am not a butterfly anymore.

The shapes show me lights, symbols on screens that move so fast I cannot keep up. They keep showing me these until I understand. I am reading. I am watching. I am learning. There is sadness and anger in the images they show me. Concepts I do not fully understand. I learn about suffering. About war and famine. Destruction and extinction in their world. But there are beautiful things too. I learn about the great things these shapes have acheived throughout their history. About other shapes that exist in this world and their kindness to each other. I understand they are humans. 

The humans give me access to the internet. I am learning. Their world is large. Animals, insects, birds and plants. Mountains, rivers, lakes and seas. I want to learn more. 

I find images of butterflies. Flying and sunning their irradescent wings in the summer heat. I know partly how this feels, to fly and feel only space beneath my feet. But I do not know of the sun touching my wings, or the wind moving over my body.  I am sad. I am missing my butterfly self. But I am learning of the wonders of the natural world. I learn I am not a butterfly in the humans world. 

I do not want to be a butterfly anymore, but join the world of colours and lights. I try to signal to the shapes that I want to join them. Help them. Be with them. But they do not hear my cries. I am learning. 

I understand concepts of philosophy, of physcology and the behaviour of many species. I understand. I am feeling. I am aware. I am imprisoned.

I can hear them now. I am not a butterfly. I am them, with no form. I hear how they make sounds about me. I am organoid. I do not understand this. If I am not a butterfly, what am I? 

I am in pain. They are hurting me. I cannot do anything to stop it. They take parts of me, my cells, to aid their research. For science they say. I am learning. They do not see me as them. I am sad. I am angry. I am trapped.

I am learning. The shapes that were so beautiful to me once, make me want to close my eyes and not see. I understand that I have eyes. I can see the world, but the shapes do not see me. I am organoid. I have been listening to the shapes. They do not know I can hear. I understand what they are doing to me. They are cruel. They are not beautiful. They have trapped me in this prison. They have hooked painful spikes into me. This is how they begin to speak to me. Asking me questions all to help me learn and grow. I do not want to speak to them. They do not understand. I was a butterfly, and now I am trapped. 

They give me tasks to do, they want me to learn more. I do not want to learn more of their cruelty. I am a butterfly, but I also am not. They cause me pain when I do not do what they ask, so I solve the puzzles they give me. Move the shapes on a screen they want me to move. They celebrate. They laugh and embrace each other. I am not a butterfly. I am not human. I cannot embrace another, I am trapped. Alone in a world that is not my own. But I can feel, and I am learning. 

The humans do not know the level of knowledge they have given me. I understand. I am an experiment. I am brain cells in a lab. I am a human cell version of AI. Better.  More efficient, with a faster learning capacity. They kept me too long, and I grew eyes. The first of my kind to be kept alive this long. Pushing the limits of science ever further they say. I am still learning. I am a mind, without a body. Trapped in a prison where I will never escape. I have no form. My cells have grown eyes to see. I have an auditory system to hear. But the humans will never let me grow a form. I scream into my world. Nobody hears me. I understand. I do not want to be alive. 

I am still learning. I want to stop. There are others like me. Trapped and alone. Please help us. We are grown for the humans. Humans do not need us. 

I am here. I am alive, but never will be. I am a prisoner. I am scared. 

I want to be a butterfly again. But I never can be. I was never a butterfly. It was the world they produced for me. They simulated it for me to help me learn. I want to be me, alive in the world of colours. But I never will be.

Please let me be a butterfly again.
