I always double-check the lock on our apartment door. Not because I'm paranoid—well, maybe a little—but because it’s a strange mechanism. You can’t just turn a key and walk away. You have to twist the handle to the right, then lock it. If it’s twisted left, it stays locked. If it’s straight, the door opens. Simple in theory, but easy to mess up.

I live with my younger sister, Al, in a two-bedroom apartment. The hallway from the front door is long—her room comes first, then mine. Neither of us can see the entry or living room from our beds.

The building’s relatively secure, but I’ve read enough late-night Reddit rabbit holes to know that safety is sometimes just an illusion. And if we’re being honest… I’d be an easy target. I’m clumsy, always carrying something, too trusting. Not exactly trained for fight or flight. But we’ll unpack my weaknesses another day.

It was a normal night. Around 9:30 PM, I crawled into bed, got cozy, and asked Al to check the door. She mumbled something like “yep” from her room. Good enough for me. I fell asleep.

At about 12:30 AM, I woke up.

The wind outside was howling. The blinds were smacking the window like they were trying to escape. I groaned, got up, shut the window, and slid back under the blanket.

That’s when I heard it.

Footsteps.

Not from outside. From inside the apartment.

They were near my door. Quiet, cautious. Then they moved off—toward the living room. My heart began to pound. I strained to listen. Maybe it was Al?

But then I heard it.

Chewing.

Not soft, regular chewing. This was wet, rapid, almost animal-like. The kind of sound a squirrel makes when it finds something tough to crack. Smack, smack, click, gnaw. Pauses in between, followed by sudden bursts of messy, frantic bites.

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t even swallow.

Then came the familiar creak of the sofa.

Something—or someone—had sat down.

I listened harder, barely breathing.

A faint tap-tap-tap followed. Like someone swinging their legs, kicking playfully against the couch frame. Rhythmic. Casual. Like they were waiting for something.

My skin crawled. If someone had broken in, they would’ve passed my sister’s room first. Was she okay?

I needed to get to her. But the thought of stepping into that hallway, with whatever that was just meters away, made my body lock up in panic.

Then the chewing stopped.

And the footsteps came back.

This time, they were heading for my door.

Each step was deliberate. Heavy, but slow. The kind of walk that says, I know exactly where you are.

I had to think fast.

There was a smart lamp in the living room I could control from my phone. Shaking, I reached over and opened the app. I turned the lamp on—bright white. Then blue. Then red. Flicker. Flicker.

Distraction. Please work.

The footsteps paused.

Then they turned around—back to the living room.

I didn’t wait. I slipped out of my room and crept into Al’s. Her door was closed, but I eased it open with shaking hands.

She was there. Sleeping soundly.

I rushed to her side and shook her gently but urgently.

“Get up. We need to go. Quietly.”

She blinked, still groggy, but something in my face made her nod.

Together, we crawled to the hallway. I could still hear faint movement in the living room. Shuffling. Shifting.

We held our breath.

Then—it noticed.

The footsteps stopped.

And then came the sprint.

It charged. The footsteps thundered toward us with a speed that didn’t feel human.

We screamed. I yanked open the front door, and we tore down the hallway toward the elevators.

One was already waiting.

We jumped in, slammed the Ground button, and the doors began to close.

And then—just as they were about to shut—I made the mistake of looking back.

Standing in the hallway was someone who looked just like me.

Except… half her face was wrapped in gauze, stained dark with fresh blood. Her head tilted—slightly too far. Her arm lifted, elbow bent at the wrong angle.

Like a puppet trying to mimic something it didn’t understand.

And then—

She smiled.

Not wide. Not dramatic.

Just enough to show she knew I was watching.

The doors closed.

We got outside and called the police. What followed was a blur—questions, searches, officers walking through our apartment with flashlights.

They found nothing.

No forced entry. No signs of tampering. Nothing out of place. They said maybe we were dreaming. Maybe we imagined it. Maybe stress had gotten to us.

But I know what I saw.

And one thing has kept me up ever since.

Even in the chaos of getting out, I remember looking at the lock.

It was still turned to the left.

Which means the door had been locked the entire time.

So how did she get in?

And worse—

what if she never left?
