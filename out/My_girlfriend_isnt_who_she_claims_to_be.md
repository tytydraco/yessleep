Every day I tell myself that life goes on—that I’m not trapped in an endless cycle of enchantment and fear. Fear that she’ll return and try to finish what she started. Or maybe—who knows—I’m just schizophrenic, and all of this is nothing more than one long, bad hallucination.

Nonetheless, I’m here to vent to you all. I need you right now, especially since I feel her creeping closer with each waking day. She lingers in the shadows, waiting for me to make the wrong move. She waits in blissful silence, knowing that somehow, someday, I’ll be back for more. I can’t let that happen. Guide me. Be here for me.

It all started back in May. I’m an out-of-state college student in my sophomore year, and as you can imagine, I’m already under a lot of stress. To blow off steam, I always went to a nature trail near my university. I’d spend hours roaming through the woods, wanting to feel like nothing—you heard that right, nothing. I wanted to feel like a void, exempt from the pressures and stresses of life.

During those times, I would occasionally call out to the universe for clarity. I felt like my life wasn’t my own, that my existence was just a preprogrammed path of emptiness with no true fulfillment. Maybe it’s just because I’m 22, but I’m sure many of you reading this can relate one way or another.

Two months ago, on an afternoon beneath a lavender sky, I was hiking through the woods with my dog Milo, an all-black German shepherd. He kept me company through the long strides in the woods. He also acted as an alarm system for potential threats, that’s when I noticed Milo detecting something. I followed him as he veered off the trail and soon came across a trail of fresh red blood smeared across the leaves and branches.

I thought to myself, Who would just randomly go off trail like this? My first assumption was that a predator had been carrying its prey’s carcass through the woods. But then I saw it,a blood-drenched footprint in front of me, nestled between two large rocks. I crept forward slowly, ready for whatever predator I was about to encounter, although the predator must have left its prey as I saw  a freshly killed white-tailed deer carcass.

The strangest part about this was that the deer was almost fully intact. There were no signs of a struggle, no gashes. I assumed at first that maybe it had died of natural causes. But upon closer inspection, I noticed two small tooth marks near its neck. A snake? What snake would cause so much bloodshed around the area? The blood spread across the leaves and branches all around but yet no gashes?

I was perplexed. Something felt off. Maybe it really was a snake bite—perhaps the deer vomited while dying from the venom, and maybe someone else had stumbled upon the scene before me, leaving that footprint in the blood. Whatever the reason, I decided to move on. I returned to the trail and started heading back toward the car lot.

That’s when the thirst set in. The summer sun had drained me, and I realized I hadn’t stayed hydrated. I spent the remainder of the hike trying to forget about that weird situation.

When I finally stopped by a water fountain, the cold water after hours of hiking and ignoring my dehydration felt like pure rejuvenation.

As I lingered there, taking my time, I noticed a pale-skinned girl with light, curly brown hair standing behind me, patiently waiting her turn. Immediately, I apologized for holding her up.

“Oh—I’m sorry, I didn’t see you there behind me!” I said, stepping aside and gesturing for her to go ahead.

“Oh no, no, you’re okay!” she replied sweetly. I waited behind her, planning to take another drink once she was finished.

When she turned back toward me, her pale skin seemed to glow beneath the lavender sky, and her light curls framed her face as she gave me a long, genuine smile—a smile that could awaken even the most dormant, tired soul. I instinctively smiled back, as best I could, and then she went on her way.

I’m not the type to dwell on moments like this. Some of my college friends are girl-crazy—heck, what 22-year-old college student isn’t? But this was different. This was genuine. Time seemed to pause, and for once, I felt alive. Corny to many of you all but it was true, let a man live.

As I drove back to my apartment that day, I was perplexed and confused. Why? Why did this hit me like a freight train? I tried to convince myself that I didn’t feel anything, that I’d be okay the next day.

As you’ve probably already guessed, the next day came and my curiosity only grew. Who was this mysterious woman? For an entire month, I kept going back to that trail, hoping to see her again. Every day I returned, hoping that another glance would stop my thoughts from spinning out of control. I just wanted to feel focused again, like I controlled the wheel in life.

But each day, she wasn’t there I just grew more hopeless, more crazy. Was that single encounter really enough to set me off like this? It didn’t make sense. I must have been obsessed. I kept telling myself people have reasons for falling in love, but mine didn’t feel valid enough. Not for someone I’d barely met.

And then, there was the strangest part of it all.I started dreaming about her. I almost never dream, or at least I rarely remember them. But after that night, the memory of our meeting kept replaying while I slept. I’d wake up feeling drained, hopeless, like I was slipping through the safety net we call "ego". The stress must’ve been affecting me physically too as I started to get a rash on my back and neck. I assumed I was scratching at it in my sleep. All of these events transpired during that month when I kept going back to the trail, trying to find her, the mysterious woman as I'd like to call her.

After feeling like I was drowning inside of my own head I decided to mentally ground myself, I sat down at my kitchen table and stared at Milo my sweet boy, the companion who did not care about anything else other than pleasing me. That’s when I made a decision. I was going to go back to the trail one last time. Not to find her, but to let go. I needed to move forward and focus on school and my mental health.

As I packed up my truck for a 12-mile hike, Milo suddenly took off, barking and chasing a passing car. He’d never done that before. Maybe there was a dog in the car window or something—but still, it wasn’t like him. I shouted and chased after him until he finally came back and jumped into the bed of the truck.

We drove off toward the trail. This time, I was mentally prepared. I told myself this would be the last time, my chance to break free of whatever strange grip this woman had on me. As we drove through the Colorado highways, I rolled down the windows and let the breeze wash over me. There was a calmness in that moment, like temporary freedom.

When the trail-head came into view, I slowed my breathing and tried to center myself. I got out, strapped on my hiking backpack, leashed Milo, and we began our walk into the woods. We played fetch along the way, Milo’s trained to be off-leash (I know some of you reading are already upset and commenting on how I should keep him on a leash), but we had a great time. Honestly, when I say we don’t deserve dogs, I mean it. Milo has always been there for me, he was an instrumental factor in keeping me mentally stable through those times, oh my sweet Milo, you'll be missed. 

Nonetheless I felt like myself again for a moment.I started to believe I could move forward and let this whole silly and embarrassing obsession go. Before my thoughts could linger I noticed something on Milo's neck that I also had on my own. He had a rash—on his upper back and neck, just like mine. Instantly, the hairs on my arms stood up. A cold wave rushed through my body, despite the hot August air. Could there be fleas? Mites? Something in the apartment?

I pulled out my phone and made a note to schedule a doctor’s appointment,for both of us.

We kept walking. Maybe a little too long. Fatigue started to set in, so we found a spot by the river and rested as the sun began to dip below the horizon. I had almost completely forgotten about her. I even laughed a little to myself, thinking how ridiculous it was to have been so caught up over a stranger.

But just as that peaceful feeling began to settle in, Milo started to growl a deep, low, disturbed growl. 

I turned around quickly, my heart immediately racing. And there she was.

The woman.

She stood there, bathed in the last golden light of the day. She smiled, then waved for me to come over.

I walked over and smiled nervously.
“My name is June. It’s kinda crazy how we ran into each other again.”

“I know... I saw you sitting there and thought I’d say hello. It gets lonely out here sometimes. I’m Angeline,” she said with a soft laugh.

“I’ve been coming to this trail for a while. Haven’t seen you much, except for the last time by the water fountain. Are you from around here?”

“Actually, no. I live nearly two hours away. I work at my family’s flower shop. I just come out here now and then to breathe.”

“So… you’re not in college?”  I asked as she seemed to be in the same age group as myself.

“Right, I’m not. Luckily, our family business is doing really well. And... studying? Reading? Presenting in front of twenty-plus people?” She chuckled and squinted with a smile. “I count all my lucky stars that my parents let me work with them.” Then she reached for her phone in her back pocket.

"lucky...staying up till three in the morning has been one of the best experiences I've had as a twenty two year old" I said sarcastically, now reaching for my phone as-well.

“Oh I bet, let me guess the Ramen noodles are fantastic too?" she smiled slowly, and genuinely. "Why don’t you take my number down? There’s a festival coming into town soon. I thought maybe we could go together, you caught my eye the very first time I saw you and I regretted not talking to you then, luckily we crossed paths again?” she said shyly.

"I think we both didn't seize the moment but it's okay, we have this moment now and I would love to go to that festival with you, Angeline."

I eagerly pulled out my phone and saved her number.

She gave a warm smile and turned to leave, waving gently. As I walked back to my car, I felt lighter. The anxiety, the confusion—it all lifted. I wasn’t crazy. She remembered me. The feelings had to be mutual.

Then, just as I started to head back to the trail-head, I heard someone yelling for help.

I ran toward the voice and found an old man, trembling beside something that stopped me cold in my tracks. A dozen deer carcasses lay scattered around him—each with two identical bite marks on their necks. Just like the one I had seen a month ago.

I knelt beside him, trying to keep calm.

“This must’ve been some kind of freak accident,” I said.

“No,” the man gasped. “This wasn’t an accident. It did this.”

“What is it?” I asked, my voice rising with fear.

His eyes were wide with dread. Slowly, he reached toward my neck, his eyes rising with shock and dread, right where my rash was.

“It’s already sipping away at your body. Run, son. Go far from this town. It has chosen you,” he whispered.

I froze. A chill crept over my entire body.

“Old man, stay with me. Don’t talk like that. This has to be some kind of accident!” I shouted, trying to shake the fear away.

But his breathing slowed. He started to fade. Just then, paramedics and county police arrived, rushing into the clearing. I stayed as long as I could, giving them my statement, explaining what I’d seen.

But none of it made sense.

Twelve deer.
Same bite marks.
Same location.
Same eerie pattern.

I thought about texting Angeline—to tell her what happened—but stopped myself. It would make me sound insane.

What haunted me the most wasn’t just the deer or the bizarre coincidence.

It was the old man’s final words.

“It has chosen you.”

The next morning, I checked the news for any unusual reports from the trailhead, but to no avail. Nothing had been reported. I know some of what I’ve shared with you all so far might sound like strange coincidences—but how does something like that not make headlines? Twelve deer carcasses, each with two small puncture marks on their necks. No mutilation. No struggle. It was as if the blood had been drained clean from their bodies.

That’s when my inner conscience started to turn on itself. Was I losing my mind? Was my ability to process information objectively starting to fail? I grabbed a notebook and wrote down two objectives:

See a doctor and veterinarian for mine and Milo’s rash.

See a psychiatrist.

Later that day, I went to both. The doctor couldn’t diagnose anything on the spot. Same with the vet. They both took samples to be tested and told me they’d call in a few days. At least I got something out of the psychiatrist visit.

“June, I understand that everything you’ve told me may seem crazy, but it can all be explained,” she said calmly. “You’re not speaking in any unusual fashion. All signs point to a normal, functioning, healthy brain. I think the lack of sleep and the pressure from your classes are causing you to mentally crash and become paranoid. Consider taking a break from school if you need to. Your mental health comes first.”

“Ma’am, with all due respect, after everything I’ve told you, you still think I’m processing the world normally? That I’m not losing my mind?” I could feel the frustration and desperation rising in me. I didn’t want to be brushed off—I needed answers. But as if she had read my thoughts, she continued.

“June, I know you want answers to the chaos in your life right now, but I’m the professional here. And I’m telling you, with years of experience, that what you need is rest. Time away from school. Time to breathe. You’re pushing yourself too hard, and there’s no balance. I tell my son the same thing as well since he’s your age. You kids sometimes push yourselves too hard. If things don’t improve, come back and we’ll take the next steps. But for now, take a break.”

I left the appointment feeling more defeated than ever. There were only two possibilities: either everything I’d seen and experienced was real… or I was genuinely going crazy, and they just missed the diagnosis. When I got home, all I wanted to do was crawl into bed. But something was off the second I stepped through the door.

Milo didn’t come to greet me.

He always greeted me.

I walked slowly through the apartment, flipping on lights as I walked through. I called his name. Nothing. As I got to the living room, a sinking feeling hit my stomach. The back door was open—just slightly. And from beyond it, I could hear faint whimpering.

I stepped outside and froze. There, just outside the door, was Milo. He was lying still, breathing shallowly, his body pale and cold. The rash on his neck had grown worse—and there they were. The same two puncture marks, just like the deer had on its neck. My knees gave out as I dropped beside him, sobbing and screaming uncontrollably. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think. My best friend—my companion—was gone.

What had he tried to stop from coming into the house?

I buried him that night in the small patch of earth behind the building. I could hardly see through my tears. Anger and confusion warred inside me. Again and again, I asked myself: what did Milo try to protect me from?

I stayed up for hours researching. I looked into every animal I could think of that attacked the necks of its prey. The closest I found were large predatory snakes—but nothing matched what I was seeing. Could this be a new disease? A virus? Something spreading through the area? Was I next?

All I knew was that once I got out of class the next morning, I was heading straight to the county hospital to report everything.

Researching the possible cause of this nightmare distracted me from my grief, at least temporarily. But the moment I stopped, the pain came flooding back. My body shook with tears, and I screamed into the silence of the apartment. I couldn’t imagine a future without Milo. He had loved me unconditionally—and I had loved him the same. I cried myself to sleep, praying that when I woke up, this would all have been a nightmare. That he would be there in the morning, wagging his tail, ready to greet me.

But I didn’t even make it to morning.

I woke up in the middle of the night, my rash burning worse than ever. I stumbled toward the bathroom, scratching at my neck. But something caught my eye. A figure, standing at the far end of the hallway. I don’t wear my contacts to bed, so I assumed my eyes were just playing tricks on me.

Then came the footsteps.

Heavy, fast, pounding against the tile floor.

The figure bolted—straight for the back door—and slammed it shut with a deafening bang.

I darted into the bathroom and locked the door, heart racing. I grabbed my phone with shaking hands and called 911. My eyes scanned the drawers, searching for anything I could use as a weapon.

Something had been in my house.

And I was beginning to believe Milo had died trying to protect me from it.

After the police arrived, they spent at least an hour searching for evidence that someone had been in my apartment—but found nothing. Not a single footprint. Not a scratch on the wall. Nothing.

“Son, don’t tell me you’ve been dabbling in that acid and mushrooms crap?” one of the officers asked, giving me a disappointed look.

“We’ve already had to call four ambulances this week to deal with kids tripping out,” his partner added with a chuckle. “Marijuana’s never enough for your generation, huh?”

I didn’t even bother to argue. I just thanked them for their time and let them go. I knew they thought I was wasting it—and maybe I was. But deep down, I also knew I wasn’t crazy. I knew what I saw. I knew what I felt. The fear for my life was real. Something was out there. And it was coming for me.

The next day, I somehow powered through school with only a few hours of sleep and a heart full of grief. That afternoon, I received a call from the lab regarding my rash.

“Mr. June, we’ve got your results. The rash on your upper back and neck appears to be infected with some kind of venom. Honestly, we’ve never seen anything like it before. Have you been out in nature recently? We’d like you to come in for a more detailed follow-up test.”

That call solidified everything. Something was after me. I couldn’t explain what or why, but the venom confirmed it—I wasn’t imagining this. I was in danger.

I rushed back to my apartment and packed enough essentials to stay in a hotel for a few days. I needed time to breathe, time to think without watching my back every second. At the hotel, I tried to piece everything together. I wanted to call Angeline—to tell her everything, to have someone believe me—but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. What if she thought I was insane?

I couldn’t risk that.

All I could do now was try to clear this mess up before our date next week at the festival. I had to be ready. I had to be alive. So I came up with a plan:

1. Tape or drill down all windows in my apartment.
2. Secure every door with heavy furniture and rig alarm bells to them.
3. Get a weapon.

For the next couple of days, everything felt normal. I felt safe. I went back to my apartment and settled in again. At this point, Angeline and I were scheduled to go on our date the next day, so that evening, I took a stroll to unwind from the chaos of the past few days. As I walked past a coffee shop, a woman stopped me abruptly.

"How long?" she asked, her expression deeply disturbed.

“Excuse me, ma’am—how long of what?” I asked, confused and thrown off by her sudden question.

She leaned closer, pointing toward my neck. “How long has that creature been sipping away at your soul? I can see it written all over you. It’s been eating at you slowly,” she whispered, her voice trembling as though even saying the words caused her pain.

I hesitated, then spoke, barely believing I was admitting it out loud. “I’ve been very confused for a while now, ma’am. I don’t know who you are, and I don’t even care if you think I’m crazy… but something has been after me. I just don’t know exactly what it is yet.”

Her eyes widened. “I hate seeing young men like you go so soon.” She lowered her head, shaking it in disappointment.

“Wait—hold on! You have to help me figure this out. What do I do?” I begged, stepping toward her.

She looked up sharply. “So you don’t know yet? You haven’t been informed?”

“All I know is that everything started the day I found a deer carcass in the woods... one that had only two puncture marks on its neck.”

“Now, son, after that occurrence—what else happened?” She squinted, eyes narrowing as if trying to see through me.

“Well… I ran into this girl—” I began.

She cut me off immediately. “I’ve heard enough. I’m sorry, but I have nothing more for you. Whatever lies ahead is something you’ll have to face on your own. I just can’t believe you haven’t been informed yet.” Without another word, she turned and walked away.

“No! Don’t just leave like that—you were the one who started talking to me!” I called out, chasing after her. But within seconds, I lost her in the crowd.

What haven’t I been informed about? I asked myself over and over. The only thing I could take away from that conversation was that Angeline had something to do with all of this.

That night, I went to bed determined. I was going to tell her everything I had experienced—every terrifying detail. At this point, I didn’t care if I sounded insane. I just wanted the truth more than anything.

That night, I had a dream. Milo was there, waiting for me in a green, lush forest. The sunlight pierced through the trees as he leapt into my arms, licking me uncontrollably. It felt so real, so full of peace. But then, Milo started guiding me down a trail into the woods. The deeper we walked, the darker it became. Grim shadows overtook the sunlight, and from within the trees, I heard the screams of men and women.

“Turn back,” they cried.
“Kill yourself before you become one of them,” another voice pleaded.

Suddenly, an altar appeared ahead. Angeline stood at the center, wearing a tattered white wedding dress. Her smile was lifeless, empty—but somehow, I wanted her more than ever. I craved her dark embrace. I ran toward her.

Just before I could reach her, I woke up.

It was morning. I staggered to the bathroom to brush my teeth, still trying to process the dream. But when I looked in the mirror, my stomach dropped. The rash on my neck had spread—and I looked visibly paler.

Worst of all, I saw them.

The two small bite marks.

The same ones I saw on that deer carcass two months ago.

They were faint but clearly visible. They were emerging.

I got my clothes on and walked out the door. I walked into the street and began asking everyone passing by if they could notice how pale I looked. They all said I looked normal—except for the rash, which, they said, could use some aloe vera. I asked if they could see the bite marks on my neck, and every one of them said no. The only visible, concrete evidence others could see was the rash.

After confirming that I might’ve been hallucinating my physical state, I opened my phone and searched Google for any flower shop within a two-hour radius of my town—since Angeline had claimed she lived that far out, though she never provided specifics. After digging through a few sites, I found something that froze my blood. There had been a flower shop about an hour and forty-five minutes away… but it had been abandoned for the past twenty years.

Here’s the best summary I can give you of the article I read online:

“The Yeager family’s flower shop has been permanently closed due to a tragic family incident involving the death of Angeline Yeager, daughter of Julius and Martha Yeager, former owners of the local business. According to insider sources, Angeline died at age 19 in a head-on collision while out drinking with friends. It is unclear whether she was under the influence while operating the vehicle. Following the incident, the Yeager family shut down their business indefinitely.”

Below the article was a photograph—Angeline. Picture perfect. The same face. The exact same face I’d been talking to. Who the fuck was I talking to if the real Angeline had been dead for two decades?

I even asked a few friends to confirm if the website and article were real—they were. She hadn’t aged a day. Not a wrinkle. And come on, if she had died in a car accident, I’m sure some kind of trauma would’ve been visible. What was I touching? Who… or what took her place in death? And what the hell had they buried in that car?

I didn’t have time to wait for answers. I got in my car and headed straight for the festival where we’d planned our date. As I arrived, I felt a heavy, hollow fear rumble in my stomach—like I’d lost touch with all five senses. And there she was, standing in front of my car with that same enthusiastic smile. A smile wrapped in lies... and sin.

I was ready to confront her. I had to.

“Hey Angeline,” I said nervously, trying to contain my fear, “Is there anything in particular you want to check out here? You’re more of a local than I am since I'm from Texas.”

“Yes! Let’s go check out the rigged fair games,” she said, laughing aloud.

We walked deeper into the festival, hand in hand. As crazy as this sounds—I still enjoyed being near her. As scared as I was, a part of me wanted to savor every second. But she could tell something was off.

“June,” she asked, frowning, “Are you okay? You look like you haven’t slept in days. Don’t tell me you’ve been up partying with your college friends.”

Her voice was soft but growing with disappointment.

“No,” I said. “It’s not that at all. Things have just been... weird. The past couple of months—I’ve been seeing some strange things. I feel like I might need medical help.” Regret and embarrassment flooded my conscience.

“You seem pretty normal to me,” she said. “I don’t think you’re crazy. So why don’t you tell me exactly what you’ve seen?” Her tone shifted—calm and sweet, but somehow... demanding.

I stepped back slightly. “Angeline, why don’t you tell me what’s going on? I think you know all too well. Let’s stop playing games and be open about the bullshit that’s been going on.”

The last strand of my humanity spoke with confidence and determination.

She leaned in closer, her eyes shimmering with something inhuman. “You sleep so soundly, June. So beautifully. Your breath... it’s so warm. And the look in your eyes when you know something is wrong—it never gets old. I love seeing people like you staring into thin air, trying to make sense of the chaos.”

My voice cracked as I asked, “Was that you in my house? That night… did you kill Milo?”

She smirked. “Let’s ask a better question: how much longer do you think you can survive this warm little life of yours? How long can you play this game with me, little June?”

She pulled me in close and whispered into my ear, voice cold and electric with malice:

“Tonight, June dies. Tonight, June enters a new age of existence—one stripped of humanity. A new consciousness. A new will... for the one we serve.”

I tore away from her and ran to my car. As I threw the door shut and started the engine, I saw something that made my hands shake on the wheel. The car she had arrived in—it was the same car Milo had chased down the street weeks ago.
I was prey. I had been marked by whatever had possessed that body.

Driving home, I called my siblings and loved ones. I told them everything. Every terrifying detail from the last couple of months. When I got home, I locked every possible entrance to my apartment and grabbed the only weapon I owned—a small crossbow.

I sat there, in silence, waiting for her to return.

Not even an hour passed before I heard footsteps on the roof—heavy, deliberate. It was like she was probing every edge of the building, like a hungry serpent trying to find a crack in the nest of a defenseless, flightless bird.

Then silence.

But before relief could set in, I heard it—a thunderous crash, like a large object had been hurled straight through a glass window. I ran through the apartment with my crossbow raised, ready to strike at whatever hell had broken in.

And then I froze.

Milo’s corpse had been dug up and thrown—thrown—into my apartment.

At that moment, I lost every last piece of my morality.

I picked up the crossbow. I aimed it at my own chest.

And I pulled the trigger. 

After that, I lost consciousness and woke up in a hospital, a cold, pale hand caressing my head. I turned to my side—and it was Angeline. I tried to get up and run, but I couldn’t. The pain in my chest was too immense. Moments later, my mother and father rushed into the room after hearing I had woken up. They came to hug me and told me that I had been diagnosed with severe schizophrenia the day I visited the psychiatrist. Apparently, I had refused to take the medication prescribed to me, which had led to the episode I’d experienced.

I asked my mother how she knew all of this. She pulled out her phone and showed me the call records from that day. I genuinely didn’t recall any of it… but the evidence was right there, staring back at me. I reached for my own phone and quickly searched the web for the article I remembered—the one about the supposed death of a woman from Yeager’s Flower Shop. But when I looked it up, all that came up was a normal company website with photos of Angeline smiling alongside her parents.

Relief started to flood through me. Maybe I really was sick. Maybe I still had a girlfriend. Maybe there was no sinister entity chasing me after all. I turned to hug my mother and Angeline, thanking them both for sticking by me through my mental health episode. They both smiled and cheered me on. My mother left the room to give Angeline and me some space.

“Angeline, thank you for everything. I mean it... no one should have to go through what you’ve been through these past couple of months,” I said, turning to her with a deep, grateful smile.

She looked back at me, expression unreadable. “New June, you’ve been quite the project. Luckily, we don’t die so easily from point-blank arrow shots like that,” she said, her voice cold. “You’ll find out what you are soon.” She grinned then, a demonic look flickering behind her eyes, and walked out of the room without another word.

I turned my face into the pillow, trying to convince myself I was just slipping again—that the medication still needed time to work, that this was all in my head. I write to you all here and now: am I losing my mind, or am I being hunted by something veiled in darkness?

Please... be here for me.

The more I live on, the more I want her. A dark paradise lies in her eyes, and I can feel my soul being sipped away. The more I want her, the closer I get to losing everything.

Come to my aid...
