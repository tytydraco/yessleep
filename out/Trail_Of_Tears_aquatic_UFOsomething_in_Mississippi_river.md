(Pics and video to back this up) My friend and I talk about this almost every day because it changed our life's. We experienced something that was not possible. A few months ago at the Trail of Tears state park outside of Jackson, Mo, my best friend and I were sitting out on this overlook that has an incredible view of the valley and it sits right above the Mississippi River. We were alone as we could possibly get in the entire park. 

We were enjoying the view as the sun set and as it got darker we saw all the lights come on in the distance and it was beautiful. 

As it was finally getting completely dark, out of nowhere my friend says, "what the fuck is that" and points out over to our right. I look over and about 2-3 football fields away, I shit you not, a bright bioluminecent blue orb comes from the depths of the Mississippi River. We both watched in horror as this thing slowly got brighter as it got closer to the surface, and when it surfaced, it stayed level with the water and made its way to a nearby rock bank/sand bank or whatever it was.

This is where shit gets weirder, as we are tripping over what the hell this thing is, it starts traversing land and water seamlessly, like it was flowing perfectly with the landscape. THEN this fucking thing goes from one big blue ball of energy or whatever the fuck it was, into atleast 5 connected balls of blue light that must have been 50-100 feet wide SURGING through the water and going over sand banks and back into the water so seamlessly. 

AND IT GETS WEIRDER! This thing becomes one ball again, and makes its way to the shoreline where there were trees and bushes. This thing was either so hot or so powerful with energy that it was incinerating anything that got close to it greenery wise. We saw spurts of fire come OUT of this thing like a flamethrower too! 

The last crazy unexplainable thing it did, that drove us to get the fuck out of there, was it fucking starting throwing out pulses of orange light, it looked like alien technology throwing out a sheet of light that traveled through the air and laid down onto the sand bank perfectly like it was scanning or fucking doing something crazy I have no idea. 

First of all I know I saw something extraordinary because you physically cannot watch light travel through the air. We both agreed that we saw this thing shoot out a huge sheet of light that literally just laid down on the ground and dissolved. Anything else I could have explained away but THAT is what fucked us up the most. There's no possible way that happened but it did. 

Whats weird too is I started having nightmares and visions flash in my head... One prominent vision I had was of me standing knee deep in water, and this giant blue orb hovering right in front of me, but that's all I could see. Thats the end of the vision. 

Like i said I have not so great video proof of this happening to us, it was dark and my phone wasn't the best and we didn't think to record until it wasn't doing anything crazy because we were literally freaking out so bad. 

IF ANYONE CAN HELP EXPLAIN WHAT WE SAW, THAT WOULD BE AWESOME BECAUSE WE CRIED LIKE BABIES ALL NIGHT AFTER. 

Please DM me and I will send the pics and video that I took that night.
