What am I about to tell you may sound unbelievable or rubbish. But I assure you that this is a true story, a real-life account of a bizarre creature sighting in the woods. 

My dad's cousin Jeremiah lived in a rural area in Kansas. His lawn mostly comprised of tall grasses and his family home was surrounded by the woods. He loved the woods and as they had no television or toys or anything, he loved to go there to collect wild berries and mushrooms. 

One of his favorite past-times consisted of whittling sticks. He was quite the craftsman and he made amazing things with wood and sticks. The woods was so deep that people and little kids were forbidden to go there without supervision or after sundown. But there were accidents as people always love to do stuff that were forbidden. Now few months back, one of his neighbor's teenage son went into the woods and he never came back. They just couldn't find him. 

So, that day Jeremiah went a little deeper into a place from where he could see the edge of the forest. So he sat down and started to whittle sticks. He didn't notice the sun had set until some kind of liquid hit the back of his neck. He didn't mind much and continued to whittle his stick. Then he felt something fall on his forehead. He wiped at it and his hand came away with blood. 

"What in the hell?" He whispered and looked up and around. He saw nothing out of the ordinary except all his hairs were standing on end and he was covered with goosebumps. Suddenly, he became aware of something. He couldn't hear anything. Everything had becoming very quiet. There was no bird calls or insects to be heard. 

Then he heard it. Sounds of branches breaking, and the crunching of dried leaves in the ground. He held his lantern up and looked around. He couldn't see anything as the light from the lantern didn't penetrate the darkest corners around him. He decided to leave and as he was packing his things up, suddenly he couldn't move. As he sat paralyzed, he could feel that something big was drawing closer to him. Then the thing stepped in front of him. 

His eyes grew wide and his throat dried up as he never saw anything so unholy and terrifying in his whole life. And the worst part is, he knew who it was. It was the kid from the neighborhood, or at least his face that was perched on a long scaly and withered neck. He or whatever it was, between 214 to 274 cms in height. Its body was hairy, and its hand was hairy and they ended in huge curved claws and its feet ended in hooves. There was something danging from its mouth which really looked like a human leg. But Jeremiah didn't want to accept it. 

Jeremiah tried to scream but no sound came out. He heard a raspy whisper in the wind which sounded like "go away, you are not welcome here". He tried to speak again but ended up farting. He lost consciousness as he saw the creature approaching him. When he opened his eyes he was lying on the porch of house. He remembered a dream where that horrible creature told him why and how he ended up turning into that creature, what he did, and what he ate to survive lost in the forest. The truth was more unsavory and disturbing than he could've imagined. He decided to keep that kid's secret and take it to the grave lest he and his family face the wrath of his damned spirit. He decided never to go into the woods again and stop anybody from doing the same.
