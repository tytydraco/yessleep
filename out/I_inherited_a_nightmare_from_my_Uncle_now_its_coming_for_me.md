The same nightmare woke me up again. The visuals were too erratic and unpleasant to describe. Every time I have that nightmare, it feels... off. Kind of meaningless yet still carrying an undisclosed significance. Just a person too distant to be clearly visible, standing still—or not. Sometimes, he seemed to be walking in either direction. You know that feeling when you can't tell if someone is walking toward you or away due to distance and slight hindrance in visibility? So far, I’ve been unsure of his direction. I call him the directionless guy.

Samara, my psychologist friend, calls it a mere hereditary condition. According to her, I somehow inherited the dream from my uncle.

But this isn’t a recent nightmare—it has been happening since childhood. Back then, I used to see a child or someone standing too far away. My uncle had the same dream too, though he would always talk about some **entity**. He wanted to, but he passed away three years ago. He was about to share his experience with us. He had been lucid dreaming as well. He had even joined a Facebook group called Lucid – Reality Rules Dreams.

He was found dead, **alone**, with multiple stab wounds in his apartment on the 20th floor. To this day, his death remains a mystery. No one knows what exactly happened—who killed him, or if he somehow killed himself.

The sheriff looked for clues, did everything he could, but the case remains unresolved. There was no evidence of a break-in by any means possible. The authorities partially ruled it as a possible suicide. But stabbing oneself to death? That’s something I refuse to believe. And yet, they moved on, leaving an unsolved mystery behind. Now, I have inherited his apartment, and due to the recent murder, no one wants to buy it—even at half the price.

I was already broke, and my uncle never married. As far as I know, he never even had a girlfriend. Perhaps he was a loner, or if he had someone, I believe she must have left him because of the nightmares that kept him awake and frightened. He was practically going insane.

Now, about the apartment—it's a duplex with dust covering every surface. A reminder of my uncles absence. It was abandoned for three years, after all. With three big rooms, a hall, and a kitchen, it’s pretty damn big for a single person. But I have no choice but to live here. I'm in debt, and this is my only way of getting out of it. Renting another apartment would mean choosing my own doom.

Samara, who lives in a town some 80 miles away, has been begging me to rent another place instead. If only she knew about the debts I’m carrying. Nevertheless, her concern is my uncle’s tragic demise—and the fact that his killer is still at large. She’s worried that someone might show up and stab me too. I don’t dismiss her concerns, but money makes us do things we would otherwise refrain from.

Samara doesn’t say it, but she’s also **worried about my nightmares, the ones that mirror my uncle’s. She thinks I might end up going insane like him.**

It took a lot of time to get the apartment cleaned. I took a deep breath and headed toward the bed. Near the bed stood a rocking chair with a small pillow fixed to the headrest. The pillow had those dust markings that come from prolonged use. My uncle used to sit there, deep in thought, trying to decipher his nightmares—trying to understand what they meant.

I remember visiting him once when I was around 23. He was sitting in that chair, lost in thought, confused and frightened. Scratching his chin with one hand, as if trying to solve some great mystery.

At that moment, I asked, "What are you thinking, Uncle Brian?"

*No... no... it can't be. How is my past...* he muttered, accidentally ignoring my question. He was so lost in his thoughts.

"UNCLE?" I raised my voice, finally catching his attention.

*"Yes... y-yes, John? What is it?"* he stammered.

"What do you keep thinking about? Why do you always seem worried?" I asked.

*"I can't... I can't tell you right now. Someone is coming...the entity...the entity"* he kept saying, looking tense. It was better to leave him alone than to push him further.

I don’t remember falling asleep, perhaps due to exhaustion. But upon waking up, I recalled the nightmare. I saw myself running away from someone—someone wearing exactly what I had on when I fell asleep. He was far away, very far away. He seemed to be chasing me. The scene was too hazy, but I could still make out the vibrant colors of his clothes.

I also saw my uncle, sitting on a wall, swinging his legs, calling me towards him.

But I chose to walk in another direction. I don’t know why. Perhaps I feared walking toward my dead uncle.

Then I woke up.

I hadn’t slept much; exhaustion still clung to me. I took a shower, had breakfast, and while watching TV, I dozed off again.

A lunatic honked outside, jolting me awakean hour later—otherwise, I would have slept longer. This time, I had the same nightmare, but the man was much closer. His face was obscured by haze, but he was wearing exactly what I had on at that moment. Now, I could tell—he was walking toward me, not away.

I could also see Uncle Brian, but this time he was more distant, still calling me toward him. Before I could decide which way to go, the nightmare ended.

It was getting eerie. Why did I keep seeing the same nightmare? I had always shrugged it off as nonsense, a coincidence—because Samara had said so. She believed it was just a pattern my brain had copied from my uncle. She also had this theory that nightmares were a way for the brain to stay alert while asleep.

But this was too much. I was worried.

I didn’t want to end up like my uncle. What if it was some kind of inherited curse? What if it was some kind of warning?

I had to know.

So, I searched for the same Facebook group my uncle had joined. Just as I was about to click Join, my laptop battery died.

During the move, I had put the charger somewhere, but I couldn’t recall where. As I searched for it, I stumbled upon a book. It was covered in dust, its front cover and some pages worn—perhaps chewed by a rat.

I held the book in my hand but didn’t want to read it yet. I was too lost in thought—too scared.

The entire day passed with me trying to understand the meaning of these nightmares. Somehow, I found myself sitting in the same rocking chair my uncle used to sit in. It was as if I could feel him now—feel what had troubled him.

I don’t recall when I fell asleep.

This time, in my nightmare, the person was very close. He looked almost like my exact replica. Fear gripped me.

I saw Uncle Brian too, standing far away, still calling me toward him.

Something inside me told me that walking toward him would be the better choice.

I took a step in his direction—

And woke up to the sound of my doorbell.

Someone was pressing it continuously. The ringing was unbearable.

I walked to the door and looked through the peephole—

And froze.

An eye was staring back at me.

Panicked, I looked again.

Still there.

I was terrified, but I thought maybe someone was just trying to scare me.

I shrugged it off. But then—

The bell rang three more times.

Shaken, I sat down and joined the Facebook group. There were tutorials on lucid dreaming, guides on how to achieve exceptional results.

I had learned the technique, but the book—still in sight—drew my curiosity.

So, I opened it.

*"I couldn’t understand these nightmares. They were driving me insane. But after my lucid dreaming sessions, I found hope. In my dreams, I see only someone who looks like me. He has been chasing me since childhood. Now I realize—the child I used to see in my dreams was my own replica. Yesterday, someone rang the bell continuously. When I looked through the peephole... it was just an eye staring back at me. I was terrified. I didn’t open the door, because I have come to know that it's my very past self, chasing me into the future and trying to kill me
This reminded me of my father's foolish decision to summon an entity in return for unparalleled wealth and power when he was foretold that if the entity is not pleased on time then it returns as time itself, the very lines written in the book that had the procedure to summon the entity still haunt me "If not pleased on time for the power you have taken, the entity shall return from the time it was summoned", it gets into your own past self, becoming the past version of yourself, now the entity will haunt our generations. And I don't see any hope now, I can't outrun him, he's getting closer in my dreams which means I barely have a day left and as I write this now...I don't have any help either, no one can save me, It's just him and I in the dream, my god ! the bell is ringing again."*

Amidst the ringing door bell and having read my uncle's last left note, I was shivering in fear. The only hope I had was lucid dreaming, but in the guide it was clearly mentioned that there should be one more person beside you, who would help with the procedure and help you come out of it.

I knew I could trust no one but Samara and I immediately contacted her, and it took her more than 2 hours to reach my place.

Then we began the step by step guide and I was finally there, the entity (my own version but with big black eyes and an angry grin) was walking towards me, this time with twice as much speed, meanwhile I was running, my heart pounding. Until I saw Uncle Brian, sitting on the same cracked wall, calling me towards him. And I ran without stopping, I didn't look back, I just ran towards him and he took me to a secluded place within the dream.

I woke, gasping, the bed soaked with sweat. The doorbell was silent—for now. My pulse wouldn’t slow, and my eyes stung like I’d stared into the dark too long. Uncle Brian’s voice lingered: “Stay hidden, John. It’s time itself—it’ll find you if you stop.” I glanced at the rocking chair; it swayed once, then stilled. The entity wasn’t gone—just waiting.
