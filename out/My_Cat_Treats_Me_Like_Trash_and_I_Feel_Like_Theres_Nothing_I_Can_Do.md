Kittens. Freaking kittens.  
Let me be clear, I’ve always wanted to own a cat but it wasn’t until I started high school that my mom would let me have one.  
“You’re not responsible enough!” That was always the first thing she said. “Not like your cousin Margaret!”  
Dammit I hated Margaret. You know that one family member that everyone has who is oh so perfect that everyone loves? That’s her. My mom reminds me almost every day. What’s worse is that I have to go to school with my cousin so Margaret is always telling me herself.  
I am responsible, okay? Just maybe not compared to other people…  
Luckily, through sheer persistence, I managed to convince my mom that I could handle a cat. Who doesn’t want to pet them and snuggle them and feed them and rub them and…You get the idea. Cats are awesome!  
And when I went to mom to the local animal rescue to adopt my very own cat, there was no body on Earth that couldn’t convince me to adopt Missy Softclaws.  
“Do we have to call her that name?” My mom asked the animal rescuer next to us. Missy looked up at us while sitting down with her black tail swishing from side to side. Her soft green eyes stared right at me, she had mostly black fur but white patches on her paws that made it appear like she was wearing white socks.  
She looked awesome.  
The animal rescuer shrugged her shoulders. “Up to you.”  
“What happened to her previous owner?” My mom asked.  
The rescuer hesitated before saying, “Died.”  
“Old lady and her cats huh?”  
I thought the rescuer would be offended by what my mom said but he looked genuinely disturbed as he looked at Missy Softclaws.  
“No, well, actually the owner was still young. Early thirties I’m led to believe. When the police arrived in response to a call, they found the owner dead with Missy here fast asleep on top of the corpse.”  
Ignoring the disturbing sleeping habits, we adopted the kitten almost straight away and I was playing with her as soon as I got home. She was purring, running around, softly pawing my fingers away as I stroked, patted, tickled, brushed, hugged, cuddled…all the awesome things you do with cats.  
Fifteen years of anticipation and Missy Softclaws was everything I dreamed that the perfect cat would be.  
I only wish it stayed that way.  
When it came to dinner that night we had bought the fancy stuff: tuna and chicken casserole with gravy, expensive but nothing less for my cat. I laid it out on a plate in front of her and…she pawed it away. No matter how many times I pushed it in front of her nose, she pushed it away. I even tried eating a little bit to show her how tasty it was but she still pushed it away.  
New home nerves I guessed. Didn’t seem like she was hungry for anything so I didn’t bother trying to force her to eat anything. No matter, I was still so excited that I played with Missy for hours after dinner and she eventually spent the night in my room. When I turned off the light and went to bed, she was curled up next to me when I shut my eyes.  
I don’t know how long I closed my eyes for, but I swear I’m not making this up, there was a voice that said, “Silly human. You will learn to worship me.”  
It sounded so clear, so real, so close, that I sprang out of bed and went straight for the light.  
I don’t know what I was expecting but when the lights came on my room was empty, except for me and Missy Softclaws. Stood there for a good two minutes until I convinced myself that it was either a light dream or I was sleep deprived.  
Oh how wrong I was.  
Woke up the next day with Missy Softclaws lying on top of me. Not going to lie, that was pretty awesome. Went to school as usual only to run into Margaret who made it seem like her only reason for going to school that day was to give me grief over owning a cat. “You? A cat owner? The thing would be lucky to be alive by the end of the week. The cat would be way better off in my home.”  
Did I say everyone loves her? Everyone loves her. Except me.  
Anyway, ignored her most of the day and I was still really excited to see Missy Softclaws again, except…I had a stack of homework that was due the next day.  
Somehow Missy had already managed to find a way outside and I actually found her on the fence, staring down at the neighbour’s St. Bernard, Rufus, who was barking and jumping up at Missy. So I climbed the fence and brought her inside before she hurt herself.  
She was purring when I placed her on the back of the couch and kept looking at me with wide round eyes.  
Told her, “I’ve got to do some homework tonight so I can’t play, okay?” Yeah, I’m one of those people who talks to their pets.  
But when I turned around, I didn’t expect her to talk back to me.  
“Your homework is not important. Paying attention to me is.”  
I know you won’t believe me and I didn’t see her say it either because I had my back turned. But there was no one in that room except me and that kitten. Started to get a bit lightheaded when I turned around to look at Missy, couldn’t believe I heard that.  
Not surprisingly, when I was actually looking at her, she just stared at me expectedly and meowed.  
Maybe I was losing it, I don’t know. But I swear I heard those words. Shook my head in disbelief and went to my room to study. Shouldn’t surprise anyone but Missy Softclaws walked in through the open door and started rubbing against my leg as I was trying to do algebra.  
If x is 5, y is…  
As if algebra wasn’t hard enough, Missy was purring louder than I could think. I know I shouldn’t have, but I was spending five minutes on this one question so I…  
Kicked Missy Softclaws away from my legs.  
Gently! It was more a gentle nudge with my foot that just pushed her away from me so I could concentrate and finish that stupid question, okay?  
So I was still staring at the stupid question, hoping the answer would, I don’t know, magically appear before me when I heard a voice behind me.  
“You shouldn’t have done that human. You will pay for your insolence.”  
Leaped out of my freaking chair. Sounded like some woman was in my room but my room was empty…save for Missy Softclaws. Started to get so freaked out that I could feel my heart beating through my chest. Quietly, I took a few steps to my doorway and peered into the corridor.  
Nothing.  
That was the second time I heard a voice in an empty home within half an hour. Thought I was going nuts. Decided, screw it, searched every room in the house. Nobody.  
Had to be my imagination. What other reason could there be?  
Eventually, after making sure I was the only person in the house, I came back to my room to find Missy Softclaws lying on my homework.  
Thought I was so anxious about my homework that I probably started to imagine voices that weren’t there. Instead of homework, I decided the best way to relieve stress was to pick up Missy and pat her until my parents came home.  
I didn’t tell them about the voices though.  
I woke up the next morning to find Missy Softclaws lying on my bed fast asleep. Which I thought was adorable. That is until I put my feet on the floor and stepped on cat poop.  
Missy!  
She woke up slowly, her kitten eyes fluttering as if she was trying to get back to sleep as fast as she could.  
Wanting to housetrain Missy, I rubbed her nose in the squished poop before throwing her outside in the backyard (I didn’t literally throw her out I mean I just placed her on the back porch).  
Had a shower to wash my feet, had breakfast after and made myself lunch for that day: two sandwiches and an apple. Now, I distinctly remember that I made my packed lunch in the blue lunchbox and left it on the kitchen table for five minutes while I got my homework and bag ready.  
Came back, put my blue lunchbox in my bag and went to school.  
Had history then gym in the morning so you can imagine that I was looking forward to lunch that day.  
But do you want to know what I found in my lunchbox? Not two sandwiches and an apple, but an apple core and cat poop.  
No. I’m not making that up.  
I had cat poop in my lunchbox.  
Was so pissed about it that I threw the lunchbox straight into the bin causing the cat poop to fly out and nearly hit me.  
Never figured out how it got in there and who put it there. Thought it was Margaret to be honest.  
Had more homework that afternoon. So I wanted to go straight inside but I found Missy Softclaws sitting on the fence again staring down at the neighbour’s barking dog. It was funny, never heard the neighbor’s dog barking before but it seemed like Missy was almost antagonising the dog. Needing the quiet, I climbed the fence again and brought Missy down.  
Again, I went inside and placed her on the couch and went straight to my room to complete the new set of algebra questions. Didn’t even solve the first question before Missy found me in my room. Was so fixated on my homework that I forgot to shut the door.  
No biggie, I thought. That was until Missy Softclaws decided to jump on my head and use it as a cushion. She curled up in a ball like she was a turban on my head and started purring so loudly that I couldn’t concentrate on my homework.  
“Okay Missy, maybe next time…” I reached for her on my head and as I tried to pull her off, Missy’s claws started to cling to my scalp. I yelped in pain but she only dug in deeper, tried to pull her off even harder but I could feel her nails dig in deep, real deep, as I let her go in response to the pain, trickles of blood ran down my cheek.  
“Silly human, do not disturb me from my perch again.”  
Those voices weren’t my imagination. My kitten was talking and right now she owned me. I could only sit there for what seemed like hours until my parents came home from work when Missy decided she was bored and leaped off my head finally.  
But that was it. I needed to tell my mom that I didn’t want the kitten anymore.  
“Don’t be silly you just got her.”  
“But she talks! And she’s evil. She thinks she owns me!”  
“Her purring is kind of cute. Evil isn’t the right word to use though. There she is-“ I thought I managed to slip Missy Softclaws but the black kitten was standing right beside us in the kitchen, listening to every word I was telling my mom.  
“Have you fed her? Come on, I almost have dinner ready.”  
I didn’t take my eyes of Missy Softclaws as I found the can of cat food in the cupboard. I didn’t take my eyes off her when I opened the can and plopped the contents into the food bowl either. Missy walked right over the cat food, leaned into my ear and said, “Do you think this garbage is good enough for me? I need human flesh now. Bring me human flesh.”  
I was wide eyed. But I stared into that kitten’s eyes and I knew it was serious.  
I was too afraid to close the door that night and I tossed and turned as I lay there in bed, with Missy lying on my pillow next to me, contemplating how to feed this talking kitten.  
Barely slept that night and nearly fell asleep during lunchtime. I was lying back against a tree, ready to fall asleep when my cousin Margaret poked and prodded me. Normally I would’ve got up and knocked that idiot over but I was so mentally and physically exhausted I just lay down on the ground.  
“What’s wrong? Is a little old kitten too much for you? Did you stay up all night with your pussy?”  
“Piss off Margaret, I’m too tired.”  
“Tired of life no doubt. Everyone knows your mom loves me more than she loves you, you know.”  
My day didn’t get any easier when I got home. As soon as I walked onto my front lawn, I heard my neighbour Darrel crying in his backyard. Yelled over the fence, “Darrel? You okay?”  
He stopped sobbing for a moment and stood up over the fence, tears still wet on his cheeks.  
“It’s my dog Rufus. He’s dead. Someone…someone…”  
I wish I didn’t look. I think morbid curiosity got the better of me. I only leaned over the fence for just a moment, but when I did, I saw the bloodied mangled corpse of what used to be Rufus and I recoiled in horror. My legs almost failed me as I leaned back against the house wall.  
“How did this-“  
“I don’t know.” Rufus sobbed. “It’s just so barbaric.”  
Far from equipped to deal with the emotional trauma, I left Darrel alone in his grief. But as soon as I turned the corner, I saw Missy Softclaws sitting on the front porch, licking the blood clean from her claws, staring right at me.  
When I opened the door, I heard her speak from behind me.  
“Dogs are always so annoying. You haven’t forgot my dinner for tonight have you?”  
I remembered to shut my door to my room this time and I sat alone, in my room until my parents came home. When my mom walked into the house I pretty much sprinted through the house and practically ambushed her.  
“You have to- You have to get rid of this kitten. It’s pure evil. It killed the neighbour’s dog and now it wants me to kill somebody because it doesn’t like cat food and-“  
“Would you get a hold of yourself? You’re acting so stupid.”  
“But you’re not listening to me I-“  
“Are you seriously so incapable of responsibility that you can’t handle a cute little kitten? You know what? You’re not responsible enough. I’m going to call your cousin Margaret and she can adopt the kitten instead. She’s responsible and has always wanted a kitten as well you know.”  
I slumped to the ground in defeat. My own mother wouldn’t believe me. It was over.  
Then Missy Softclaws walked up to me and brushed up against me. My mother gave me a dirty look as Missy was purring.  
“Honestly. It’s so sad you can’t get your act together.”  
Margaret only took ten minutes to reach our house.  
As she walked out the door with Missy buried in her arms I was looking away when I heard Missy say, “good job boy.”  
The dread that filled my soul when I realised I had found her dinner. Her human flesh. This evil talking adorable kitten was going to eat my cousin, my own flesh and blood. Even if Margaret was a jerk to me, she doesn’t deserve to die, she doesn’t deserve to be nibbled to death, to be clawed to death, to be mauled by Rufus. No matter how cruel or two-faced someone is, surely no body deserves such and end?  
Margaret turned to me and said, “Did you say anything dweeb?”  
I shook my head.  
“Didn’t say anything. Not a thing.”  
Some people really deserve cats.
