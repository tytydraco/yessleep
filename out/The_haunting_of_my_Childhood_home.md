I’ve always loved the paranormal, watched scary movies tried to talk to ghosts on apps, etc. I always thought that it’s so cool, until I had my own experience. Now I respect it a bit more.

  The first time I ever experienced something was when I was 8(I’m 14F now)
and I was sitting in the living room drawing on a blue chair made of velvet. My foot was hanging off to the right and this isn’t very scary but as a child, I was on the verge of a panic attack. I heard a soft kind of kind female voice whisper in my ear “foot” then my foot. My foot was touched. I ran to my mother in the kitchen screaming and crying, she comforted me.

  The second experience I can’t remember what age but I was doing dishes and putting them up. As I was reaching to put a cup in the cabinet to my right, the cabinet slams in my face hitting my hand and grazing my nose. I dropped it and ran I wasn’t as concerned, but it definitely wanted the wind or something. I know this because the door, windows, everything was shut, and it hit my hand but still had force and made a loud bang normally it would’ve just stopped moving these cabinets are very old.(it was my grandmothers house and before that my school counselor grew up in it because it’s a fairly small town)

  Third experience I was probably 12 and and I had an easy bake oven, and I kept it in the top of my closet along with the ingredients and some Disney movies. I was going to get my clothes or something I can’t quite remember but the easy bake oven fell and nearly hit my head I jumped back in time. There’s no way it just “fell”, no it had to be pulled pushed idk it had to of jumped at me because it was not hanging off at all I’m a very organized person.

  Fourth experience. My area is heavily wooded and especially on my street and the graveyard that’s over a hundred years old is literally my backyard if you go to the end of my street you can enter the woods, keep walking and then you reach a path it connects the graveyard, my street, and another neighborhood I’ve never actually found the end but it’s a long path and I love walking there.

  I live on a dead end street called sunset st. There is a curve instead of a corner turning into my street or you can turn from church st. to sunset that intertwines with the curving street I live right there. Right at the curve there’s some abandoned stables and the woods. The stables are more to my left from the view of my bedroom window.

  And I’m a giant horror and true crime, ready anything creepy fan so I don’t scare easily or really at all. I’m chilling with my 2 year old cat Mia and I hear tapping on my window. I assume it’s the girls next door, so it doesn’t bother me I glimpse out the window. Nothing.

  Maybe 30 minutes later I hear it again, and I’m a mix of agitated and nervous. I open the window and all the way maybe 15 feet from the stable I see a woman. No not a woman, there’s no way. She’s pale skinny looks like she’s been starved and deprived of basic nourishment. Oh god her eyes, her eyes, they were so empty and pale and I couldn’t see her irises or pupils just blind maybe? Her hair was all white. All she wore was a tattered yellowing nightgown. I run crying to my mom and ex-stepdad they look, and nothing.

  Fifth experience wasn’t that much but was scary The doorhandle kept on turning it just kept on jiggling and I was terrified to open it and it was late at night, and when I opened it, there was no one there. 

  The final event or what I think is. My dad loved controversial books and he had the satanic verses and I was so curious, so last year I decided to read it. I only read a glimpse of it and the part included Lilith that’s all I remember. I set it on my bed the 8th of April on a Wednesday, Thursday I sleep in my mom refuses to drive me to school ask my ex-stepdad and he says no as well. I get upset and I just try to enjoy home a bit, but school has always been my escape.

  My mom goes to pick up subway, I watch my 5 year old brother for her, I went to the bathroom and it couldn’t of been more than 2 minutes. There’s. no. way. And I hear patting so I come out and my brother is trying to put out a fire on my bed right beside the book. I try everything I can but my room burned, but I gave it up and tried to get my brother and cat out I couldn’t get my cat and lost her in my moms room.

  I didn’t have a phone at all my moms tablet needed Apple ID passcode to call. F**k. I was also grounded so my laptop and tablet were in the car. I run out of the house with my brother, all of the neighbors are GONE. No one my hope was depleted, but also as I was running down the driveway my mom comes around the corner. “CALL THE COPS THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE” “You’re joking right?” NO PLEASE” she doesn’t call them she just run in the house and panic so I grab her phone and call them myself.

  It takes them forever, or at least it seemed like it I don’t know. It looked hellish I remember hearing my window shatter. I was determined to get my cat, so I took a chair put it to my moms window and smashed it threw her headboard across the room and tried to get my cat. No hope. I sat in the car and ate my sandwich.

  Well this year my mom’s friend steve who lives IN YORKSHIRE, YOU HEAR THAT? A DIFFERENT CONTINENT. He’s a clairvoyant and he says a Priest died in my room. That’s right a full on priest DIED in MY BEDROOM. I wanted to confirm this so I did some digging and yeah that actually happened.

  And my town is fairly haunted I believe because the trail of tears runs through and there was a burial ground and then a graveyard was built over it. The one in my backyard.

Long story short I think it’s over and I cleanse my house daily. Most scariest and humbling experience of my life.
