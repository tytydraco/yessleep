Red tinted the water as the thick, blood-like substance hit it. I bent down, feeling my bones crack from the position. The now-familiar putrefying smell mixed with an iron aftertaste as I cough once again. I could barely see anything, my eyes burned so much that I even thought I was crying acid, the same acid that was coming from my mouth. For a second, I thought that was it and I wasn’t even fazed by it. I was throwing up my life into the toiled and didn’t care. Actually, I was relived. But it never came. And I was brought back into reality, one where I had to handle what was happening to me.

When did it start? The calendar says a couple of weeks ago, but in my mind, it feels like an eternity. Maybe it was my fault. I prayed to god every single night to take me away. Isn’t it funny how I begged for his mercy so many times, and now that he finally answered ,I don’t want it anymore. I feel like I’m being punished.

As I sat on the body-shaped crater forming in my bed, I could still taste the bile. And in a blink of an eye, it was already dark outside. Through my eyelashes, I saw my life drifting away. I put another x on the calendar, starting another page, leaving my youth behind. Just as my mind started clouding with thoughts of impending doom, I tried to bite my nails, hitting flesh. But I didn’t even mind. I just wanted it to stop.

If you’re reading this, you’re probably confused. What’s happening to me? you may ask. If I’m being honest, I’m not sure. I guess it started with small changes, too small for me to notice. Or maybe I just simply ignored them. I don’t know. My body just stopped working one day. 

My hair went from just falling out to chunks of flesh coming off my skull with it. And I must admit that even though it was scary, at first, I saw it as some sort of miracle. My internal pain was externalizing itself, and it felt real for the first time ever. I could finally say that I was hurting, and everyone could see it. And it felt good, it felt real. I wasn’t a liar. My feelings were actually real.

Of course it did not take much time for me to realized I was dumb for believing in miracles. It didn’t stop when I had no hair left. It didn’t stop when my skin got so dry that I would scratch it off. Nor did stop when my bones got so weak that it hurts to move.  

I haven’t not shower in days. I haven’t brushed my teeth. I have no strength anymore. I’m barely surviving. This past month has felt like hell itself. I’m writing this to explain why I did it. I hope any of your learn something from this.

Be careful what you wish for. It can always get worse.
