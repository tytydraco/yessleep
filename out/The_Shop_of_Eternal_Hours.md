It wasn’t supposed to be permanent—just a weird little shop I passed by a dozen times on my way to and from work. “Curiosities of the Eternal” looked like any other hole-in-the-wall place you’d see downtown, wedged between two abandoned buildings. I’d never noticed it until that one afternoon when I suddenly found myself standing in front of it, the faded lettering on the sign almost whispering my name. The windows were blacked out, impossible to see through, but something tugged at me, pulling me inside.

The air hit me like a wall when I stepped through the door—thick and stale, tinged with the scent of old wood and dust, like the pages of a forgotten book left to rot in an attic. The floor creaked beneath my weight, and as I moved farther into the store, the dim lights flickered overhead, casting long, dancing shadows across the shelves. Shelves that seemed far too numerous for a shop this small. I couldn’t see the back of the store, no matter how far I walked in.

The man behind the counter introduced himself as Anhur. He smiled, though it was more like a slight twist of his lips—there was no warmth behind it, no human emotion. His skin looked stretched tight, like old leather, and his eyes—black as pits—seemed to flicker with something ancient, something that made my stomach churn.

“Looking for work?” he asked. His voice rasped like it hadn’t been used in years, each word scraping against the back of my mind.

I didn’t remember why I said yes. Maybe it was the weight of his stare, or maybe it was something else, something the shop itself seemed to press into me. Either way, I found myself coming back the next day, standing behind the counter as if I’d always belonged there.

At first, it was simple. The customers, though strange, weren’t too off-putting. Some looked almost normal—just a bit too pale, a bit too quiet. They moved through the aisles without a sound, their footsteps swallowed by the thick, musty air. But then there were the others.

One man shuffled in, his clothes hanging loose on his body as if they’d been draped over a skeleton. His skin was papery, thin, and when he handed me an old coin—something that looked like it had been minted centuries ago—it disintegrated into dust the moment it touched my palm. He stared at me with eyes that looked hungry, though his face remained slack, emotionless. He didn’t speak. He just turned and left, dissolving into the shadows near the entrance.

I could still feel the cold pressure of his stare hours later, lingering like a weight on my chest. It wasn’t the only time something like that happened. The customers never stayed long, but they left pieces of themselves behind—dust, strange smells, and the distant echo of whispered words I could never quite make out. 

Anhur’s eyes were always on me from behind the counter, silently observing. When I asked about the strange customers, he simply shrugged, muttering, “The shop finds who it needs. You’ll get used to it.”

After a few days, I started noticing things weren’t staying in the same place. Shelves shifted subtly, and aisles grew longer, twisting into new directions that hadn’t been there before. It felt like the store was stretching beneath my feet, warping into something larger, something that didn’t obey normal physical laws. The light had a sickly, dim quality, flickering erratically as though it struggled to exist in this space.

And then there was the smell. What once had been musty now stank of decay, like something ancient and rotting beneath the floorboards. Sometimes it was faint, almost imperceptible. Other times, it filled the entire shop, clinging to my skin and clothes, making me gag. I asked Anhur about it once, but he just gave me that same twisted smile and said, “The shop is alive. You’ll adjust.”

At night, when I was alone, I could hear something faint—like a low hum, vibrating beneath the walls, almost as though the shop itself had a pulse. It was subtle at first, barely noticeable, but as the days dragged on, the sound grew louder, more insistent, until it thrummed in my bones. 

One evening, as I was locking up, I heard footsteps behind me. Slow, deliberate. I spun around, expecting to see one of the shadowy customers lurking in the aisles, but there was no one there. The shop was empty, save for the relics that seemed to watch me from the shelves. And yet, the footsteps continued—faint but unmistakable.

Anhur was getting stranger, too. His once rare appearances grew more frequent, and I often caught him pacing, muttering to himself in a language I didn’t recognize. He would stop sometimes, just staring at me with those deep, dark eyes, his expression unreadable.

I started to notice his reflection. In the glass of the old display cases, his shadow seemed longer, thicker, almost as if something else was sharing his space, something not entirely human. Sometimes, his voice would change—guttural, almost animalistic. It was subtle, just enough to make me question whether I had really heard it.

Then there was Baalis. He appeared out of nowhere one night, a hulking figure with skin like stone and eyes that glowed faintly in the dim light. He was the shop’s “manager,” or so Anhur claimed, though he seemed more like its prisoner. His voice was low and harsh, full of barely-contained rage, and he moved with an unnatural stiffness, as though bound by invisible chains.

“Don’t ask too many questions,” he growled at me one night, his eyes narrowing in warning. “The shop’s been here since before time. It’s seen empires rise and fall. It chooses who stays.”

I shivered at his words, but didn’t press further. The more time I spent here, the more I felt like I was losing something—my sense of time, of self, of reality. I stopped going home. I wasn’t even sure I could find my way back if I wanted to.


The shop felt different now. The relics seemed to shift when I passed them, as though they were aware of me. My reflection, whenever I caught it in the dull glass of an old mirror, looked off—my eyes darker, my skin paler. The hum had grown louder, more oppressive, thrumming through my veins. I couldn’t shake the feeling that the shop was breathing, alive in some horrible, unnatural way.

One night, after closing, I found a new door at the back of the store. It hadn’t been there before, I was sure of it. When I reached for the handle, Baalis appeared out of the shadows, his massive hand slamming the door shut before I could open it. His face was twisted with a mixture of pity and anger.

“It’s happening to you,” he said, his voice low and dangerous. “Just like it happened to me. The shop... it’s replacing him.”

I didn’t understand at first, but then the pieces began to fall into place. The shop wasn’t just a place—it was alive, and it needed someone to run it, someone to keep it fed, to tend to its relics and strange customers. Anhur had been that someone for millennia, and now, it was my turn.

The horror of it hit me all at once—Anhur had been waiting, watching, guiding me to this point. I wasn’t just working here—I was becoming the shop, my identity slowly dissolving, my life slipping away. I hadn’t seen my family, my friends, my home in what felt like months. But I realized with a cold certainty that I never would again.

Anhur confirmed it that night, cornering me near the entrance as I tried to leave. “The shop chose you,” he said softly, his eyes gleaming with satisfaction. “It needs a new keeper. My time is done. Yours is just beginning.”

He didn’t need to explain any more. I could feel it—the shop had me. Its pulse beat in time with mine now, its walls whispering in the back of my mind. As Anhur stepped outside, free for the first time in centuries, I tried to follow, but the door slammed shut in my face. The walls seemed to close in, the hum growing deafening.

I was the shop now. I could never leave.
