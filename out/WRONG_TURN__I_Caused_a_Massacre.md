[ The way my night had been going](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11kplxy/wrong_turn_will_i_die_tonight/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), I was glad when I got phone signal. I thought I would be able to call for some help. Instead I called my friends to slaughter.

I’d been hiding in my bogged Toyota Landcruiser for half an hour when my phone dinged and I got a text from my best mate Bill. “Hey Ryan, how’d the Cruiser go on the tracks today?” Holy shit I thought, some phone reception. Quickly I tried to call Bill, thankfully he picked up straight away. I explained to Bill how I got the Cruiser bogged and roughly where I was. Like always Bill was keen to help out and about an hour later I saw a set of headlights coming down the trail.

“Got yourself in a bit of mischief mate?” Bill yelled out the window of his Nissan Patrol. The rivalry between Toyota Landcruiser and Nissan Patrol as old as time, Bill was reveling in the fact his Patrol had to come rescue me and my Landcruiser. “Been a hell of a day Bill” I called back.

“Firstly mate, I bet you could go one of these'' Bill said as he hopped out of the Patrol carrying two fresh beers. “Shit driving like always Ryan” a familiar voice teased from the otherside of the car. Our mate Greg popped round the corner of the Patrol, also with cold beer in hand. 

As we knocked the top off a couple of cold beers, I filled Bill and Greg in on the events of my day. “Your full of it mate” Greg scoffed, taking a swig of his beer. “Don’t believe me? Here read it for yourself” I passed the notepad over to the guys.

Over the next few minutes both the guys had a read of the notepad. I could tell that they both were a little scared/worried by what they read.

“Well fuck this, lets get that Toyota outta the mud and go home” Bill said as he stood up, walking over to the cars. 

As Bill and I started planning the recovery of the Toyota, a muffled scream sounded from the nearby scrub, followed by the sound of glass shattering. Bill and I looked at each other “Greg?” I called out. 

Bill and I ran in the bush, broken glass littered the ground, the remains of Gregs beer. An almighty crash sounded, a massive bang and more broken glass. From back in the direction of the two cars. 

Running back to the cars we found Greg. Greg's body was embedded into the Toyotas windscreen. Gregs head, separate from his body, was sitting squarely on the hood, Greg's blood painted the hood of the Landcruiser. Deep gashes ran the length of Gregs torso. Large chunks of flesh dangled from his legs. 

“What the hell is going on? What could have done this?” Bill questioned, both of us frozen in horror. A sound to my right snapped me out of my frozen state. A clicking sound, gradually getting louder. “Holy shit Bill, the monster from that notepad is real!” 

An ear pearcing squeal cracked through the night. The sound hit me with a headache unlike anything I had ever experienced. I tried covering my ears as the squealing intensified but it had no effect. The pain building in my head brought me to my knees. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Bill had also collapsed on the ground.

The sound ceased and I turned to look at Bill. Tears leaked from his eyes and I noticed he had dark red blood running out of both nostrils. “ We have to run” I croaked to Bill.

As I began to get back up to my feet, I felt a coldness creep over me. Thats when I noticed the silence. The forest frozen, as if the leaves and wind themselves were too scared to move. 

I clambered up to my feet, unbalanced. I started over to Bill who was still on the ground. Approaching Bill I reached out with a hand to help him up. 

"This thing is playing with us Ryan" Bill said as I helped him to his feet. His face was white as a ghost, undoubtedly he was as unnerved as I.

"Christ sake look what it did to Greg? He is torn to shreds!" I replied. Shock and panic started to set in.

"We've gotta get out of here mate. Come on." Bill stuttered as he started jogging towards the Patrol.

As I took a step to follow him something launched me through the air. I crashed on to the ground and then another ear splitting shrill hit me. Again I pointlessly tried to cover my ears. The pressure in my head too great this time. Black dots encompassed my vision, slowly closing in. Before I new it the blackness engrossed all. 

When I came too Bill was gone. “BILLLLL!!! Bill where are you!” I yelled out. Frantically I began looking around. I feared for my friend, but at the same time I feared for myself. As I walked around the side of my Landcruiser I found Bill. Bill lay limp on the ground infront of me.

A deep, crimson laceration crossed Bills neck, blood ran down his shirt. His eyes stared blankly up into the night sky.

I noticed Bills car keys clipped on his belt loop. Without any time to spare I ripped them off and made a dash for his Patrol. I practically launched myself into the front seat of that Patrol, slammed the key into the ignition and cranked the car to life. I spun the Patrol around and raced back up the track.

I drove out of the bush as quick as I could. I'm currently parked up in the McDonald's car park. I've made a call to the local police station who are on their way to me now. I am pretty sure they don't believe my story, probably thinking I just murdered my friends during a bad drug trip.
