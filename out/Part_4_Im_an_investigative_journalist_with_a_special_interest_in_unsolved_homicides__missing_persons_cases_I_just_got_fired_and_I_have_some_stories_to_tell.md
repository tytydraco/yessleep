Hey NoSleep. You might remember me from the above posts, a murder case in Massachusetts I was investigating. If you don't, a quick refresher: I *was* an investigative journalist on a true crime podcast, and I started looking into this bizarre murder that I got an email about, from one of the responding officers to the original 911 call. I started posting here hoping for some help with the case, things got...really fucking weird, and then I was ordered to cease-and-desist by the network I worked for. I wasn't totally operating above board and when the network found out I'd been using my credentials without approval, they got mad. For the last year I've been trying to lay low and not upset anyone else, but a couple weeks ago it got out that I was posting about it here, and, well. There went my job.

The good news, for you anyway, is that I am now free to tell some hair-raising stories. As I've mentioned before, I had a public email address associated with the podcast I hosted, and I encouraged people to send me their unsolved mysteries. I got a lot of crap, but I also got a lot of interesting stories. Some of them were published as part of the podcast, but a lot of them weren’t, even the ones I started digging into. I thought y’all might be interested in hearing some of them, the ones that never made it on air.

But first, I’ll tell you the rest of the story I was working on this time last year. Well, as much of it as I know. The network made me abandon it before I had any answers, but maybe you guys can figure it out.

Definitely read [\[Part 1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xwuk13/im_an_investigative_journalist_with_a_special/) [\[Part 2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/y0njom/part_2_im_an_investigative_journalist_with_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [\[Part 3\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/z4wkwt/part_3_im_an_investigative_journalist_with_a/) before you read on.

In the cemetery, Mrs. Knight pointed towards the main gate on the other side of the cemetery. From a distance, I couldn’t be sure what she was pointing at, but when I got closer, it was clear.

Across the street from the cemetery’s main gate was a residential street. The houses were mostly nice, with trimmed lawns and white picket fences. Except for one.

It dominated the block, taller than all the other houses by at least a story, not to mention the tall, peaked roof. It was all black, the front yard was a tangle of weeds and brambles and a gnarled old tree and what might have been a forlorn little herb garden. I stood near the entrance of the cemetery, wondering what this house was doing in an otherwise dainty little neighborhood, when, of all things, a school bus pulled up in front of the house and a young girl, looking for all the world like an average twelve- or thirteen-year-old, hopped off and headed up the walkway towards the house.

That was surprising enough, that this house was occupied not by a mean old witch, but apparently by a nice normal family. Then there was a shout from the bus as it lurched away, and something shot out of the window towards the girl, who gave a scathing look over one shoulder before disappearing into the house.

My curiosity got the better of me and once I was sure that no one was coming back out of the house and the bus was gone, I darted across the street and picked up the wadded up ball of notebook paper. I smoothed it out, and gasped.

**YOU’LL BURN, WITCH**

What the hell? Had I suddenly traveled back in time to 1692? Were these kids really accusing this girl of being a witch and threatening to burn her? I hesitated for a second, and maybe it was out of a genuine desire to help this kid, or maybe I was just looking for an excuse to get inside that house, but I decided to knock.

Someone from inside called, “Just a minute!” and then the door opened to reveal a woman in her mid to late thirties, wearing a simple cotton dress with an apron over it, holding a wooden spoon. She had long reddish hair, piled on her head in a messy bun, and a bright, pleasant face. She smiled at me.

“Can I help you?”

“Um, yeah, hi. I, uh, I just saw your daughter, I guess, get off the bus, and, um, well, someone threw this at her. I thought maybe you’d like to know.”

Frowning, she took the paper from me and looked at it. She sighed. “Yes. Well. We suspected this was happening. Thank you for letting me know. I suppose it’s inevitable…well, you know how kids are. It’s not easy…I mean, in our line of work…”

I had no idea what she was talking about, but before I could say anything else, an old woman appeared in the doorway, looking livid.

“Talia, is that a customer?”

“No, Mom, she just—“

“Then get out of our house! Our business is our business. I’ve had enough with these nosy—“

The door slammed in my face. Well. That hadn’t gone well, had it? I stood on the doorstep for a moment, temporarily frozen from surprise, and then I realized someone was calling to me. A man was unloading what looked like groceries from the back of a small car parked in front of the house.

“I’m so sorry,” he said. “My mother-in-law, well, she’s not fond of strangers. They, ah, haven’t had the best time, these last years. I'm sure, well, you can imagine.”

“I’m so sorry,” I said, “but I actually have no idea what you’re talking about.”

He paused and seemed to really look at me. “You’re not from around here, are you?”

“No, I’m, well,” I decided to go with the truth. “I’m a reporter, and I’m here investi—“

“You want to know if the rumors about the Proctors are true.”

I shook my head. “I don't—“

He interrupted me. “It’s no wonder Edwina wouldn’t talk to you. She’s had a bad time with the media. Like I said, the last few years…I keep telling her if she just told her side of the story, but she won’t…” He trailed off, gazing up at the house, looking forlorn and frustrated.

“What about you?” I said quickly. “Will you talk to me?”

He sighed and looked up towards the house. “Alright. But not here. Can you meet me at the diner around the corner in an hour?”

I was giddy with my success, and drove straight to Jenny’s. While I waited, I searched for the name "Proctor." It was vaguely familiar, but I couldn't figure out why until a webpage for the Salem Witch Trials popped up. Of course. Elizabeth Proctor and her husband had been accused of witchcraft and executed. No wonder the kid got called a witch. I could see it being a hard name to have in Massachusetts, just a stone's throw away from Salem. But why were the last few years particularly bad?

I added "Kent, MA" to my search terms and my eyes widened with some interesting hits. (All of these URLs are fictionalized for anonymity but based on my real research. Also, I refer to my former show as *Taken to the Grave* and call the network "WGBR." These are obviously not their real titles.)

Seemed like the Proctors were really capitalizing on the history of their name. I clicked on the first link. ParaNorma turned out to be “a lifelong clairvoyant and self-proclaimed mistress of all things otherworldly: magic, madness, and monstrosity.” Her website was devoted to selling her “readings,” which she claimed she could do over the phone or, for the full experience and “highest fidelity divination,” in person in her “parlor” in Marblehead. She had an online “emporium” for all manner of “magical” trinkets, like tarot cards, crystals, candles, elixirs, and so on. Her blog post on Kent, though, was devoid of anything useful, based entirely on speculation.

I tried WGBR next. I’d heard of *SpookCast*, of course, an annual Halloween podcast series from WGBR. I was actually featured on it once, a special episode of *Taken to the Grave* premiered on *SpookCast* a couple of years ago. It was a weekly podcast done every year for the months of September and October, covering stories about various spooky topics. A lot of them were based in history, urban legends, and true crime, but occasionally they went really off the rails with something like this. The article was a transcript of the *SpookCast* episode from October 24th, 2017.

I skimmed the transcript of the episode.

>The Proctor house is an old Victorian on Hawthorne Street, overgrown with ivy and vines, exactly what you’d hope a witch’s house to look like. While the Proctors themselves were unavailable for comment during my visit, I did speak with one of their customers, Lily Frankle, on her way out of the home. According to Lily, the Proctor family have been living in Kent for generations, using their skills to help townsfolk. “They’re so kind and always have a suggestion, whatever the problem is. Lots of women go to them when they have babies, or even just colds and stuff.”  
>  
>Lily is just one of many satisfied customers who go to the Proctor house for help with all manner of ailments, from the common cold to pest problems. But is what they do really “magic”? Karen McIntyre, local mother and substitute teacher, thinks so, but she isn’t happy about it. “It isn’t decent, what they do,” she said. “We shouldn’t be condoning that kind of meddling.” I asked her what she meant by “magic.” Spellcasting? Curses? Potions? Double, double, toil and trouble? “All of the above,” Karen said. “I don’t know what-all goes on inside that house but I can promise you it isn’t good.”

There was Karen McIntyre again. Based on what little I knew of her, she struck me as the town busybody. I had to talk to her, and the Proctors. But the episode was frustratingly nonspecific. What did Karen mean by “magic”?

An hour later, the man from outside the Proctor house walked into the diner, glanced around anxiously, and then saw me and hustled over. He sat down across from me.

“Thank you so much for meeting me,” I said. I had decided to switch tactics, and hoped he wouldn't notice. “I’m just doing a local interest piece for WGBR on Kent and I wanted to learn more about the Proctor family.”

He looked slightly suspicious. "You want to know about the rumors," he said again.

I shook my head. “Actually, I haven’t heard any rumors. I just know the Proctors have done a lot of good for people, and that there’s some controversy, and I’m interested to learn more. Ideally from the Proctors themselves, I prefer to keep hearsay out of my research.”

“Well, my wife, Talia, she’s of the original Proctor bloodline.” He sighed in kind of a world-weary way. “I’m happy to tell you what I can, but it’s not much, and that’s not me being evasive. I really don’t know much. It’s the women who do this sort of work, not the men. I don’t think men ever possess the…the skills, if you know what I mean.”

I didn’t. I had no idea what I had stumbled into, but it was all beginning to sound more like small-town legend run completely amok, rather than a tangible mystery.

“My wife and her mother do most of the work now that Tal’s great-aunt has passed on. They’re teaching our daughter when they can, but it’s hard enough being the kid of the town witch and dealing with all the normal teenage girl stuff.” He waggled his hands in front of him, clearly uncomfortable with the subject.

But I was stuck on that word. *Witch*. He had thrown it out there so casually, like it was totally normal to call his wife a witch.

“What do you mean, the town witch?” I tried to keep my voice steady, but I was a little freaked out. I didn’t know how to respond to a man—let alone the possibility of a whole town—who believed so shamelessly in witchcraft.

“Well, you know, they do all the herbal remedies, the traditional medicines. Some women around here refuse to give birth without my wife or her mother present with their oils and poultices and so forth.”

“Oh, so they’re really just herbalists.”

“I suppose that’s a lot of what goes on, yes. There are bits and pieces here and there of spell-casting, and my mother-in-law has a long and storied history with fortune telling.”

Fortune telling? Spellcasting? My face must have betrayed me because he waved a hand at me.

“I know, I know,” he said. “It sounds, well, it sounds batty. I suppose that’s why folks are always turning them into the bad guys. It’s hard to believe.”

“I’m sorry,” I said. “But I don’t understand at all. Are you saying that your wife, and your mother-in-law, actually perform magic?”

He sighed. “It’s not that straightforward, now, is it? Because magic, well, that implies a certain hocus-pocus that just isn’t the truth. What Tal and Edwina, and all the Proctor women before them, do is much less flashy than all that Halloween nonsense.”

I was getting frustrated. “But what do they do?”

“It’s like you said, herbal medicine. Oils, teas, poultices, tinctures. Natural remedies.”

“You said spell-casting.”

“It’s not what it sounds like.”

“I don’t know what it sounds like.” I was trying not to get angry, but this man lived in that house. He had the answers. And he wasn’t giving them to me.

“Listen, what they do isn’t hurtful. They don’t do curses, or hexes, or whatever else you might have heard. Tal, and Edwina, they help people. That’s all they do. They have this tradition that’s been passed down in their family, and I don’t understand it but I’ve seen what it can do.”

“And what can it do?” I was trying to stay calm and professional, but I felt like he was talking in circles and I wanted a straight answer.

He regarded me for a minute. “Did you hear about the woman with cancer?”

“Yes.”

“Susan came to my family about two years after her diagnosis. Talia and Edwina had helped her with womanly sorts of things before, and the doctors had told her there wasn’t much more they could do, so she was looking for any shred of hope.

“Tal didn’t think she had anything to offer this woman except emotional support, and maybe something to help with the pain. But she would try everything she could, and she said that just the act of trying would be healing. So Susan started all the herbal things, the teas and tinctures, and she came to the house once a day to have a spell cast over her.”

I opened my mouth to interrupt but he held up a finger. “Every day she said she felt better. Her pain was reducing, she was needing less of the heavy-duty pain meds the doctor gave her, she had more energy. Then one day she went in for scans and her tumors had shrunk. Suddenly they were operable. Her diagnosis was no longer terminal.

“They did surgery, another round of chemo and radiation, and she was cancer-free. She’s been in remission for almost four years now. The doctors had no explanation for why her tumors shrunk. Why she suddenly recovered. They said it was a miracle. Susan said it was magic.” He held his palms up defensively. “I’m not saying one way or another. I’m saying what I saw. What I’ve seen over and over and over again.”

“But Talia didn’t actually cure her. Surgery and treatment cured her.”

“No, Talia didn’t make the cancer go away. But something shifted inside that woman that changed the course of her disease and helped her to get better. That’s what Tal does.”

I didn’t know what to do with that story. It was amazing, sure. But there was no proof. I’m an investigative journalist. I deal with hard facts.

“Can I ask you another question?”

“Ah, here we go,” he said.

“What?”

“You want to know about the murders.”

“How did you know?”

“You’re asking questions about my family, you’re a journalist, it’s the biggest thing that’s ever happened around here. I knew it would come up.”

“Okay,” I said. “So what does your family have to do with those murders?”

He heaved another tremendous sigh. “There’s folks ‘round here who think what my family does are curses. We take the blame for a lot of unexplained illness, bad luck, sudden death. It’s easy to make the witch the scapegoat when you don’t have another explanation.

“But of course, Talia and Edwina had nothing to do with the murders, except that Edwina made a prediction about a year previous that everyone thinks is related to the murders.”

“What was the prediction?”

“I don’t know. No one knows. Edwina doesn't discuss that sort of thing. The only reason anyone knows it even happened is because Rose told a friend of hers, who blabbed about it after the murders."

"Well, what was *she* saying?"

He grimaced. "I don't want to spread rumors."

"Off the record."

"Well, the rumor is that Edwina predicted her death."

Holy shit. Way to bury the fucking lead.

"But that's not really how fortune telling works. Ed always says that the future isn't a book you can read. No matter what she saw, she couldn't have predicted it like people say. Whatever that girl's friend said, it wasn't right. But Edwina won't talk about it, and the only other person who knows the truth is, well," he gestured sort of hopelessly down the street, towards the cemetery.

I thought for some reason of the theme song to a show I watched as a teenager. *Two can keep a secret if one of them is dead.*

"So that's, that's why people think Edwina was involved. Or could've prevented it. Depends on who you ask, but either way, my mother-in-law is not a popular person around here anymore."

Before I could say anything else, his cell phone started ringing and he leapt up as though stung and fished it out of his pocket. "Hello? Yes, hi, I'm at--no, I just--I'll be right back."

He looked at me sheepishly. "I'm in trouble now. I have to go."

"Thank you for your time," I said, "I didn't catch your name."

"Harry," he said over his shoulder, practically running out of the restaurant.

After Harry left, I stared into space for a few minutes, trying to process the conversation I'd just had. It was all so ridiculous. Witchcraft? Spell-casting? Fortune-telling? But at least some people here seemed to take it all so seriously. Too seriously. I desperately wanted to talk to Edwina, but that seemed unlikely.

After I ordered and ate dinner, I paid the check and gathered my things. I was about eight steps away from the diner when I looked up and realized my car was gone. Actually, all the cars were gone. The parking lot was completely deserted, and entirely silent. I turned in a slow circle, white-hot dread rising in me, until I was facing the dark windows of the diner which had, thirty seconds earlier, been bustling with the dinner rush.

The fading light of the setting sun had entirely closed over, and the sky was a deep, flat black, unmarred by even a single star. I could hear nothing except my own blood pounding. You never realize how much noise there is in the world until it's all suddenly gone.

I stared at my reflection in the dark glass, and the empty diner beyond it. And then, the all-encompassing silence was shattered by a scream. A figure appeared beside my reflection, and I whirled around to face the empty street.

But it wasn't empty any more. A young girl was standing on the sidewalk on the other side, her mouth wrenched open in an endless scream. Without thinking, I ran towards her, her scream echoing in my ears as though she were right next to me and not two hundred yards away. I made it to the road, close enough now to make out a round, pretty face and blonde hair in a cheerleader's bow, green eyes, wide with horror. I realized she wasn't just screaming, she was saying something.

*"NO! STOP! DON'T HURT THEM! PLEASE!"*

A car horn went off, and I looked away from her to see headlights speeding towards me. I kept running, certain I could make it to the other side of the road. Something was very wrong, and this girl needed help, but before I could take another step, everything went black.

The last thing I remember is a quiet voice in my ear.

*"They deserved what they got."*
