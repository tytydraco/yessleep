[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11c0pug/theres_something_in_the_darkness_and_it_wants_me/)

If I can recall correctly, I was 20 when I encountered this darkness again. It was during the night again, while I slept, I was awoken by the sound of something falling over in my bedroom. Living alone now, it was indeed odd for any movement to be had at all besides what the air conditioning would provide to the objects close to vents around my apartment. It wasn’t until I sat up in bed, scanned around my room, and took in the sight of a familiar apparition that I realized just what had made the noise. Almost instantaneously, the whispering filled my ears just as it did once before, sounding a gentle hum in my head. Before I could stop myself, I was out of bed and walking towards the misty creature, stepping as fast as my sleepy limbs would carry me. I stretched out my hands and let the wispy appendages it offered take them. In a split second I was submerged in light, the warmth and comforting glow surrounding me wholly and completely. 

For what seemed like hours, I was suspended in this light, not really sure what was going on around me, letting the world float past. But the whispering came back, and just as it did, I was again thrust from the warmth of the light and into the dark void, enveloped in darkness but only for a moment. I remembered my dream from years ago and expected to be shown dreams of terror and suffering but no, I was placed upon that same beach from back then, and, just like before, there loomed a great and disastrous storm in the distance. I then recalled that there was something gargantuan standing behind me in my dream and as I chanced looking, I was greeted by the large creature yet again, though this time, one of its massive heads was already lowered to my level and ready to impose its will.  

I thought it was going to speak, I was sure of it, as it opened its mouth wide and inhaled, but then it pulled its back and let a ferocious roar unlike anything I’ve ever heard before it. It looked back down at me as if to be sure I was giving it all my attention. The dragon turned its heads towards the sea, the unending ocean beyond the both of us, which forced my head to turn there too, just to see what it was staring at. As I stood there, a feeling of unimaginable terror came over me. Even before I saw whatever I was meant to see, I could feel a sense of dread and panic wash over me and fill me brim full. I didn’t know what was about to happen, but I was terrified. 

Out of the water came what I was so dismayed about, a beast so unholy I dare not guess what it truly was. This monster pulled itself from the sea, one head at a time, seven of them, each as massive as the last. On the heads, it held ten horns with ten crowns, just like the dragon. As the colossal creature rose from the water, it became clearer to me, I could see that one of the heads had a large, healed wound on it, one that would seem like it’d kill even a monster that size. Its body started erupting from the water and I witnessed the fur about its body, speckled like that of leopard or a cheetah, surrounding the torso and necks. Its legs though, were different, covered in darker hair and far too large for the body they carried. They were paws at the feet, like bear paws, pads and claws like knives that stabbed the sand they plunged into.  

The beast stood at the shoreline in a prideful pose, allowing the dragon and I to take in its figure. It too began to roar, its mouth I could now see resembling that of a lion, the large fangs, whiskers, and muzzle all resembling that kind of feline. As the fierce, thundering cry rumbled in my ears I jolted up in bed and took a deep breath before starting to hyperventilate, realizing I was alone again, in bed, covered up and it was the next morning. 

I wasn’t sure what it was I was seeing in my dreams or why. I was also struck by the fact that I could recall, and still can, each and every detail of these dreams as if I was still there in person, face-to-face with what had stood before me. I could still hear faint whispering as I sat there in bed but it soon faded out and I started to forget it was even there. I gathered myself, wiping away the sweat that collected on my brow and rubbing off the shakes my hand had started into, standing from my bed and heading for the bathroom. 

I went to work that day with the dream on my mind while I mechanically typed at my computer desk. I worked at a usual 9 to 5 in a cubicle as a customer service representative for a large company in the local area. I would often answer phones and help people with problems with company merchandise or answer questions about programs through the establishment if things were unclear. Just then, I was finishing up some after-call paperwork and sending it in to my supervisors when a new call came in. I was just about done with my typing, so I went ahead and answered the call.  

I clicked on my headset and just before the caller chimed in, I could hear a gentle ringing in my ear, a soft hum, which I at first didn’t recognize as sounding similar to the noise from my earlier dream. I was just about to take off my headset to check if it was faulty in some way, but I was then greeted with the sound of male voice on the other end of the phone. 

“Hello?” 

“Yes, hello, this is JC Comparisons customer support, you’re speaking with Natalie, how may I assist you today?” Just as I spoke, I started to hear the whispering, the sound of it taking away my attention momentarily. 

“Natalie...Natalie...maybe you can help me...” The man sounded gruff and sleepy, like he hadn’t just called in to talk about some item he ordered online. 

“Yes, sir, please tell me, is there a product or program with which you are having trouble?” The whispering was getting louder, making it hard to concentrate on the man. Suddenly, a quick blip of the janitor from years before burning in a large fireball, arms outstretched at his sides and walking towards me flashed across my eyes. 

“Hello?” The man’s voice caught me off guard. 

“Y-yes, sir. Sorry about that. Could you repeat what you just said? For confirmation?” I lied; I hadn’t heard a thing the man had said. 

“I said...is this call being recorded?” I knitted my brows together, not an unusual question but it doesn’t get asked a lot. 

“All calls are recorded for quality assurance, sir.” 

“Mmh...do you think you could turn that off?” My brows scrunched together further. 

“Turn it off, sir?” 

“Yeah, just turn off the recorder, or whatever it is that you’re using...” I could hear the sound of something metal being dragged against more metal, the noise was so faint though, I could hardly ascertain what it was. It was now that I realized the whispering had calmed to nothing but a gentle hum again, a ringing in my ear. 

“I can’t just turn it off, sir, it’s built in.” I told the man. “Is there something I can help you with today, sir?” 

“Do you think God’ll save us?” The question jarred me a little, the tone of his words sending a chill down my spine. “Hello?” 

“I’m still here, sir.” 

“Do you think he will?” I was quiet for a moment. 

“I don’t know what you mean, sir. If you believe in God, I’m sure-” He cut me off, the shouts on the other end of the phone making me jump slightly from my chair. 

“THAT’S NOT WHAT I MEAN, NATALIE! DO. YOU THINK. GOD. WILL SAVE US?!” I was quiet again, the sound of metal scraping becoming louder, so loud I could hear it audibly now. “Answer me, Natalie...!” He was getting impatient, and the gentle hum began to rise in volume again, becoming so loud it was like someone was standing next to me trying to talk to me but all that was coming out was a line of garbled gibberish. 

“I-I don’t know, sir, I don’t know what you’re talking about!”  

“Wrong answer. Looks like you couldn’t help me after all...” The man sounded defeated and withdrawn in his words, the scraping sound ceasing almost immediately after he spoke. “Thanks anyway, Natalie.”  

I then heard cloth being cut, something tearing open like a shirt or pants being ripped apart. It was quiet for a few seconds, the other line almost completely silent except for a few crackles here and there. As I listened, I could hear...something, like a slicing sound, or cutting, something. There was suddenly a loud crash on the other end, a noise that seemed to disrupt the phone line because it dropped the call moments after. I sat in shock for at least a minute, wondering what had just happened, wondering what the man meant by his words and why he thought I’d have any answers for him in the first place. I didn’t understand anything that was going on, but as I sat there, rummaging through my thoughts, I decided it was best to report my call in the employee portal and let the supervisors know about what the strange man was saying. Just as I was about to start typing in the address to get the forms ready, someone tapped me on the shoulder to get my attention. 

“Natalie? Hey, Jeff wants to talk to you.” A coworker alerted me that my boss was asking for my presence, telling me to go and see what he needed. 

I made my way to the older man’s office, thinking it’s good that I’ll be going, I can tell him about the strange call in person, though I was unsure of why he was calling me to his office initially. When I got there, I stepped to the entrance and knocked on his open door. He saw he and closed the file he had open in his hand to beckon me closer. Oddly, the file he was holding in his hand happened to be mine, I could see the name on the outside of it in one the corners. 

“Natalie, please, come in, have a seat.” I took his invitation and planted myself in the old, plastic chair that sat in front of his desk. “Do you know why I called you in here, Natalie?” He asked, taking his own seat and clasping his hands over the top of his desk, my file tucked neatly beneath them. 

“No, sir.” I replied quickly. “I was actually about to tell you about a call I just took-” The dark-haired man interrupted me, completely ignoring the words I was trying to say. 

“Natalie, how long have you worked here?” He inquired, a fake smile paired with an inquisitive look now plastered across his face. 

“A year and a half, sir. Almost right out of high school.” I recalled that the day I started to work at the company, I was welcomed with open arms and an advanced paycheck if I started early. 

“Right. And would you say, Natalie,” he reopened my file and took a look at one at one the sheets facing him, “that we’ve-I’ve favored you, in that time? I can see here that you’ve have a few disciplinary slips where you’ve been a little aggressive with callers and even forgetting to turn in after-call paperwork, but still, you have never been given any full disciplinary action or demotions in the time frame in which you’ve been working here, is that correct?” I awkwardly scratched my cheek and straightened myself up in my chair, recollecting the times when I did indeed shout at a few people over the phone when they first became hostile with me or the two or three times I had forgotten to finish up pages and turn in work after a phone call had finished. 

“What, um...what’s this about?” I was becoming uneasy and anxious, starting to fidget and pull at my fingers as they rested in my lap while trying not to look too long into Jeff’s eyes. His gaze was unsettling. Though he was looking at me, it was like he was staring off in the distance, like he wasn’t really there with me in the room. 

“Why do you think that is, Natalie? Did you think, ‘I’m lucky I haven’t got into too much trouble’ or ‘I wonder if anybody knows I actually did this’? Or did you realize it was for a reason?” Another fake smile grew on his face as he waited for me to respond. When I didn’t, he continued. “Well, I’ll tell you, it was. I did you a favor, Natalie, helped you out. Now, I want something in return.” His face dropped, his eyes became like daggers, drilling into my very soul as he stared at me. 

“What do you want?”  

“I’ll tell you, but first, I want you to tell me what that call you just had was about.” He sat back in his chair and pulled his clasped hands to his lips. “What did the two of you speak about?” 

“What? You mean that weird guy?” I calmed, if only for a moment. “That’s what I was trying to say to you at first, he was yelling at me, wanting to know if I could answer his questions.” 

“Which were?” 

“He was saying something like, ‘do you think God will save us’, or something like that.” I tried to remember word-for-word what the man said and relayed what I could recall. 

“Hm. So do you?” Jeff sat forward again, closing my file and placing a hand over the folder. 

“Do I what, exactly?” He snickered and clarified. 

“Believe he will save us?” I sat for a second to process his question then shook my head in disbelief, was everyone going crazy today? 

“What is this about, sir, what’s going on? First, you talk about my time here, then my disciplinary file and ‘wanting something from me’, then God? What is this?” I threw my hand up in an exaggerated movement and just as I was about to stand and leave, he stopped me and spoke. 

“Natalie, sit down. We’re not done here.” He stood instead, walking around me and shutting the door, locking it and turning to me. He inhaled deeply before taking his seat and rummaging through a deep drawer for something. I could suddenly hear the whispering again and the sound of it frightened me, I was unsure of what the situation was going to bring, but the unexpected presence of the whispering made me feel like something bad was about to occur. When he found what he was looking for, he pulled it out and sat it on the corner of the desk, the very sight of it making me instinctively stand from my chair and make a move for the door. “Sit. Down.” He ordered. I had no choice but to take my seat again, my eyes never leaving the item that had just joined the two of us. 

“Now, Natalie...I’d like to tell you what I want.” 

“Yes, sir.” I nodded and swallowed hard, my breathing becoming heavy and labored. 

“What I want is something I’m sure you can help me with, I’m sure you’ve already helped others, like that caller, for instance.” He placed his hands on the top of the desk, one over the other and talked as if there wasn’t a gun, possibly loaded, just off to the side of us. 

“I’m not sure what you mean, sir.” He scoffed and shook his head. 

“Oh, you do. What I need from you is the truth, Natalie.” I furrowed my brows together in confusion, visually expressing my need for clarification. Jeff, unfortunately, in the slowly escalating state he was in, didn’t seem to realize that I wasn’t even remotely sure of what he wanted from me. “DON’T ACT LIKE YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, NATALIE!” His sudden loudness made me push back in my chair, the hairs on my neck standing straight up when I saw one of his hands fall to the gun. The whispering was getting louder and louder, it was like a warning this time, telling me that something was just about to happen. “I saw you there, we all did...standing with that thing...I know you know what’s coming. Tell me what it is, Natalie!” 

“What are you talking about?! Saw me where? Who’s we?” I questioned, the flashes of my dreams popping in my head. My lack of knowledge seemed to enrage Jeff, he took the gun in his hand and smacked at his temple with the butt of it.  

“Natalie...I want you to tell me what I want to know.” He had started to sweat, beads of it dripping from his face and spilling onto the pages scattered on his desk. He let a smirk dance across his face and pinched the bridge of his nose with his free hand. 

“I don’t know anything!” 

“YOU KNOW!” He slammed his fist on the desk, dropping my file and then using his whole arm to hurl all the papers and objects that rested on his desktop off it and onto the floor. He was partially hunched over his desk now, his hands placed upon it, holding him up and the gun still firmly in his grasp. “You have to know! He said you were his speaker, his prophet, the one who will preach his word, goddamnit! YOU KNOW!” Prophet? What was he talking about? Could those dreams...could those dreams not have been dreams at all, but...visions? Warnings? But even so I couldn’t decipher them, I had no inkling of understanding about their message, what any of it meant, the dragon, the beast from the sea, nothing. 

“I don’t!”  

“YOU DO!” 

“PLEASE!” I tried to reason with my boss, but it seemed like he was too far gone, crazed in his mind for whatever reason, he was stuck on the idea that whatever I was, or that he was told I was, and that I should have answers for him. I didn’t. I didn’t have answers for myself.  

For a few moments, Jeff just stood there, staring at me, a frenzied look in his eyes. But he soon broke that stare and stood upright, taking in a few deep breaths and looking up at the ceiling. He let a solemn, sorrowful look creep upon his face before looking back down to me. 

“You...you really don’t know...do you?” He sounded like the man on the phone earlier, defeated and dejected. 

“No, sir.” I replied. I could now only hear the whispering faintly, the sound of it like a gentle hum again.  

I saw a tear fall from Jeff’s eye before the next few seconds that happened so fast, I had no time to react until it was all over. 

“Then, I guess, you don’t think he’ll save us.” In an instant Jeff pulled the gun up and stuffed it into his mouth, pulling the trigger and immediately slumping to the ground after a spray of blood and brain matter splattered across the wall behind him. 

For a full minute I just sat there, processing the situation. Did everything that just happened really happen. I paid no mind to the fact that people were at the door, banging on it and trying to get in, it was like I was in a whole other world, completely outside of my body while watching Jeff’s body writhe from the after-death jerking that occurs from deep brain damage. It seemed like everything slowed to crawl and I could just barely hear the sound of the door being busted open from behind me over the loud ringing of whispers in my ears. I was greeted by my co-worker who was frantically trying to find out what happened, but after that I don’t remember much. 

It was a few days later when I turned on the news that I discovered they said it was in fact suicide. They listed his menial job, poor family life, and bad childhood as the reasons, but never mentioned anything about religious ideation. I spent many days thinking about the words he spoke to me, about being ‘His’ prophet, ‘His’ preacher, but it all seemed so unreal. I wasn’t religious in any way leading up to this, no real church attendance, no bible study, I wasn’t even sure if I owned a bible. In my search for answers, I wound up purchasing one, paying no mind to the strange looks from the bookstore clerks and those around me when I asked if it was in the fiction section or not. In my defense, I had no real belief system and had no idea really about anything pertaining to God. Wouldn’t say I was atheist, just ignorant. 

It took me a long time to do it, but I read a large chunk of the good book and discovered the Book of Revelation. When I skimmed over the pages, I noticed that a lot of what was said in the verses was quite similar to my previous dreams and, of course, I was a little unnerved. For the first time, I entertained the idea that I may actually be having visions. I didn’t think I was a prophet or any holier than the next person, but I was seeing some crazy stuff and it seemed strikingly similar to something I had not yet even heard about or looked into. I had no formal introduction to it, and for it to be shown to me in full detail without such exposure was...strange.  

I didn’t know where to go from there, how to proceed with the newfound knowledge that I just might be psychic, not a prophet. I made the executive decision to contact a professional to see if they could help me. That was a mistake.
