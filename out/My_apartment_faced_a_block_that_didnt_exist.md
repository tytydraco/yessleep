Recently, my former best friend from primary school invited me over for a short reunion to catch up on old times. He had moved back to his hometown after graduation, and this would be our first meeting in a decade or so. Excited to see him again, I readily accepted his invitation and took some time off work for the three-day trip. 

My friend, who I shall refer to as Nathan, originally planned for me to stay in his family house during my visit. But as I didn’t wish to impose on his family, I insisted on staying in a homestay instead. I found a cheap apartment nearby with all the basic amenities that I needed online and promptly rented it. 

Nathan was already waiting for me when I finally landed at the airport in the evening. Though he had definitely aged over the years, I could still recognise the twinkle in his eyes and his brilliant smile as he waved his hands at me. We exchanged pleasantries and he helped to put my luggage in the boot of his white Proton before we set off for dinner at his place. 

“I wanted to invite you during Chinese New Year instead, but my boss wouldn’t let me take more than two days off,” Nathan told me with a rueful chuckle. “So I thought now would be as good a time as any. Hope I didn’t inconvenience you too much.” 

“Not at all, I’m glad that you invited me to your hometown,” I replied politely. “But to think that Chinese New Year is just round the corner…” 

“Time sure flies, eh?” he joked, and we shared a good laugh at the dining table. He offered to drive me to my homestay before we parted ways, and not being too familiar with the local public transportation, I gratefully took him up on his offer. 

“You’re staying at Padang Tembak?” Nathan gave me an uncharacteristic surprised look when I showed him the address of my homestay. 

“Hmm?” I noticed his odd reaction and asked, “what’s wrong?” 

“Well…” he hesitated and lowered his voice to a whisper. “People say that place is ‘dirty’, if you know what I mean.”

I had an inkling, but I wasn’t the superstitious type, so I laughed it off. “Come on, I’m only staying there for a short time. Nothing’s going to happen.”

“Stupid, that’s why I’m a little worried,” he said. “The people living there are already accustomed to the place, but for a newcomer like you…who knows?” 

Nathan didn’t say anything further, and soon we arrived at the place—Block E, Jalan Padang Tembak. He insisted on helping me take my luggage to my apartment, which was on the fourteenth storey. 

While we were waiting for the lift at the shabby, dimly-lit lift lobby, I curiously asked, “what does Padang Tembak mean?” 

He shrugged. “Something along the lines of ‘shooting field’, if I were to guess.” 

Shooting field? The name sounded a little silly to me, but I didn’t ask for the reason why. Our lift finally arrived at the ground floor with a heavy clunk that didn’t inspire much confidence. It was certainly in dire need of maintenance, and the graffiti only served to highlight how rusty and grimy the lift compartment was. But it served its purpose and brought us up to the fourteenth storey. 

Before Nathan left, he asked me a strange question. “Did the owner give you any sort of instructions?” 

“Instructions?” I blinked and tried to recall the email I received from the houseowner. “Uh, they said to give the water heater a good hit if it doesn’t work, and that the air-con doesn’t function too well…”

“Anything else? Like locking the door and windows before going to sleep, for example.” 

“No, there wasn’t anything like that…” I paused. “Oh, right, I remember they did mention something about closing the curtains after 11pm to prevent mosquitoes from flying in.” 

Nathan nodded his head jerkily. “Make sure you do that. The mosquitoes here are terrifying, you know.”

“Really…” I noticed that he was behaving oddly, but it didn’t feel right to question him about his reaction. We bid farewell to each other and he promised to come pick me up at 7am tomorrow morning for breakfast. 

The apartment itself was a typical flat with a minimally-furnished living room, kitchen, toilet and bedroom. Evidently the houseowner wasn’t concerned with keeping up with the times, for the TV in the living room was an old-fashioned Panasonic with a huge bulge at the back. The remote control provided was one of those cheap universal TV remotes you can find in any sundry shop. I turned the TV on and flicked through the channels while waiting for the water heater in the toilet to start up. The reception was pretty poor, and after listening to a minute of staticky noises, I gave up and decided to check out the window view instead. 

“No wonder there would be mosquitoes…” I muttered, looking at the pitch-black forest beyond the window. I drew the curtains shut even though it wasn’t 11pm yet and took a hot shower before retiring for the night. 

It was a few minutes after midnight when I was rudely awoken by a jarring crying noise. Even though I knew I was alone, it sounded so close that I was afraid someone’s baby might have accidentally wandered into my apartment and started crying in the dark. Switching the lights on, I went out to check the living room and found it empty like how I had left it. 

“Huh?” I was beginning to think that I might have heard it wrongly, but then the crying noise started again. This time, it seemed to come from…outside the window? 

Without a second thought, I went to the living room window and pulled the curtains open. 

“Oh, maaf!” A lady by the window of the apartment facing opposite mine exclaimed in Malay when she saw me. “I didn’t mean to wake you up, so sorry for the disturbance!” 

I could understand some basic Malay, but as I don’t really know how to speak it well, I merely nodded my head at her and managed a smile. Must have been hard to have an uncooperative baby, I thought as I closed the curtains again. I was preparing to go back to sleep when a chill abruptly ran down my spine, stopping me dead in my tracks. 

That was when it dawned on me. Was that apartment block there before? 

Bewildered, I backtracked to the window and opened the curtain just enough to peek outside. Sure enough, the apartment block was standing on the very place where I swore was just wilderness when I looked out of the window earlier. The lady was still standing by the window of her apartment. Her back was turned towards me, seemingly trying to pacify her baby. I quickly counted the number of floors from the ground level and realised that her apartment was on the fourteenth storey as well. 

“Mister, why did you look at them?” 

The little voice that came from behind me nearly scared me shitless. Barely able to suppress my scream, I jerked the curtains shut and spun around. “W-who’s there?!” 

My eyes landed on a girl, looking no older than my own five-year-old daughter, standing outside the front grille gate of my apartment. Our eyes met for a mere moment before she backed away and darted out of sight. 

“W-w-wait!” I rushed to the front door, but when I peeked at the dimly-lit corridor outside, it was completely deserted. 

I wanted to go outside to check the neighbouring units, but oddly enough, something in my mind told me that it would be a wiser decision to stay in my own apartment. Shaking my head to clear my frantic thoughts, I stumbled back into the bedroom, leaving the lights on as I tried to sleep again. 

The next day, Nathan came in his white Proton at 7am sharp. I did not mention to him my lack of sleep, though he probably noticed my eye bags, because he offered to buy me a cup of Kopi O kosong to go with my dim sum. We went sightseeing around the island throughout the day in his car, and I soon forgot about the weird events last night. 

“My wife wants to go to Kek Lok Si after dinner to make an offering,” he said while we ate laksa at a bustling night market. “Will you be interested to come with us?”

“You mean the temple up the hill?” I wasn’t usually interested in temples, but when I suddenly remembered what happened last night, I was only too eager to tag along. Long story short, I met his beautiful wife and also bought a not-too-expensive jade bracelet from the temple. 

“Are you giving that bracelet to your girlfriend?” Nathan asked when he saw what was inside my bag. 

“Yeah, I guess,” I lied. 

He raised his eyebrow at me, but didn’t comment on it further. After his wife was done with her prayers, he offered to drive me back to my homestay again, which I accepted with an embarrassed smile. 

When we passed by the forest next to my block, Nathan’s wife abruptly clasped her hands together and mumbled some sort of prayer. She must have noticed my wide-eyed stare, because she turned to face me. 

“There’s a mass grave in that forest,” she said matter-of-factly. “It’s where the Japanese buried the thousands of innocents that they shot.” 

Oh fuck, was all I could think at that moment. Although I managed a smile, I was already clutching tightly onto the jade bracelet in my hand. Nathan dropped me off at the junction outside my apartment block and told me that he would come pick me up the next morning. 

“Your flight back is at 9pm tomorrow, right?” he asked. 

I nodded my head in confirmation, and he smiled. “Say, are you okay with waking up earlier? I want to bring you to the bridge to catch the sunrise. The view there is magnificent, trust me.”

I wasn’t even sure that I would be able to sleep much, so I instantly agreed and he told me to come down to meet him at the carpark at 5.30am. With that, he drove off and I found myself wishing that I’d stayed in his car longer. 

When I finally went up to the fourteenth storey, I noticed a man burning joss paper in a red metal pot outside my unit. Bits of ash were flying all over the corridor and blowing straight into my living room through the front grille. 

“Woi!” I yelled at him. “Apa?” 

That was just about all I could muster, because the man immediately stood to his feet and muttered something under his breath without even a glance in my direction. Before I could storm up to him, he turned and walked into the unit adjacent to mine. That was when I saw the girl from yesterday watching me from inside their living room. 

Needless to say, I was pretty much creeped out by the unexpected actions of my neighbours. “What a bunch of crazy assholes…” I kicked the smouldering pot away and tried my best to sweep the ashes out of my living room. Sweaty and tired, I didn’t bother with the water heater this time and took a cold shower before hitting the bed. 

I didn’t know how much time had passed, but when I was suddenly jolted awake by a loud buzz, it was completely pitch-black in my bedroom. Rubbing my eyes, I sat up on my bed and tried to figure out what the buzzing noise was. It reminded me of static from the TV…

I glanced out of the ajar bedroom door and froze. The old Panasonic TV in the living room was switched on, its fuzzy screen displaying a garbled black-and-white snow of static. Although the lights were off, the living room was brighter than usual, clearly illuminating a figure standing in front of the TV. 

The lady from the apartment that didn’t exist was inside my living room. 

Never in my life have my instincts kicked in with such force. In the split second that she snapped her head in an impossible 180 degrees to face me, I launched my body towards the door and slammed the flimsy wooden thing shut before frantically turning the lock. 

What in the actual fuck?! With a sinking dread, I realised that I had forgotten to close the living room curtains in my anger at my neighbours earlier. Thank whatever deity was watching over me that I had left the bedroom curtains closed. 

My grateful thanks didn’t last long, however, as the bedroom door suddenly caved as if someone was throwing their entire weight against it from the other side. The next moment, an eerie crying noise sounded from *directly outside my bedroom window*. I swear I saw a small shadow flit across the thin curtains, and the glass panes began to shake so violently that the entire window was on the verge of falling out of its frame. Coupled with the heavy thuds threatening to break the door down, I was certain that this was going to be my last moments when I heard something shatter near me. 

My first thought went to the windows, but they were still somehow intact. Frightened, I frantically glanced around at the room and caught sight of a curved fragment lying on the floor tiles inches away from my trembling feet. 

The jade bracelet had shattered. 

That was the last thing I remembered before fainting on the floor. It wasn’t until I heard a familiar ringtone that I finally regained a hazy consciousness and slowly picked myself off the cold, hard floor. My phone, which I had left charging beside my pillow, displayed the name ‘Nathan’ along with the words ‘incoming call’. 

I answered the call, but I was so exhausted that I couldn’t bring myself to say anything at first. Nathan’s cheerful voice came over the speaker. 

“Did you just wake up? I’m reaching your block in five minutes, remember to brush your teeth before coming down!” 

I finally managed to utter a reply. “S-sorry, can you, um, come up instead? I-I need some help.” 

“Oh? Sure, but it better not take too long. See you!” 

It wasn’t until I heard Nathan calling my name from outside that I mustered the courage to open the dented bedroom door and drag myself out of the living room. To my surprise, the man that had been burning joss paper outside my unit was with him, looking at me with a mixture of surprise and disdain. 

Before I could say anything, Nathan smiled at me. “Sounds like you had a rough night, eh?” 

I shot the neighbour a glare, which made him leave me and Nathan alone without a word. “For fuck’s sake, what did he tell you?” 

Nathan shrugged. “Nothing. What do you need help with? We got to leave in five minutes if you want breakfast.” 

“Ah, about that…” I mumbled that I needed help with packing my luggage. It was a weak excuse, but fortunately he seemed to buy it and told me that he would bring me back to do so before driving me to the airport. 

I never told Nathan about what I saw in those two nights. But I guess the neighbour might have told him something, because just as I entered the departure hall, my old friend gave me a small wrapped box as a ‘farewell gift’. 

When I finally opened it on the plane, inside was a [jade bracelet](https://www.reddit.com/r/killwrites/).
