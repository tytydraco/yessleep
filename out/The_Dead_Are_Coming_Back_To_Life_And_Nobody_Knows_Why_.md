There’s an old wives tale told to the new generation of grave diggers when they start. They say the reason for digging a grave 6 feet deep isn’t just to stop hungry animals from digging the newly deceased up from their eternal resting place. If it happens a person is buried alive at 6 feet deep you could hear them scream. 

Strangley enough, their is a protocol we must follow if a person is buried alive. You have to call the police and have an ambulance on standby just in case they run out of air while you dig them out. 

I was a gravedigger for twenty years and I’d never had to dig someone out from their grave, thankfully. And I sincerely hoped I would never have to. 
. 
There was an eerie calm to the day as I finished digging a fresh grave that was to be occupied by its new tenent the following day. As the sun was setting I was startled by the muffled sound of wailing. Having worked in the graveyard for most of my adult life you become accustomed to the sounds of the graveyard, but this was a sound I’ve never heard before. 

At first, I thought someone had fallen into the hole I had just dug. To my relief the hole was empty. But I still wasn’t sure where the sound was coming from. The graveyard was old and some of the people buried here were long dead before I started working here. 

I followed the sound to an old gravestone that had been weathered by the elements. 
I felt a tingle of dread creep up my spine as the muffled sound of someone wailing rose from the dirt. 

I wasn't sure at first what I was hearing or if what I was hearing was even real. I’ve been under a lot of stress since my wife died and I thought I was hearing things. But as I stuck my ear to the dirt, I could clearly hear someone scratching to get out.  

When the police first arrived on the scene I wasn’t sure how to explain to them that someone who is alive and shouldn’t be is crying out from 6 ft below. 

One of the baffled police officers knelt and stuck his ear to the dirt. 

“How long have they been buried,” he asked. 

“40 years,” I stuttered as I pointed to the date on the gravestone. 

The police officer's face turned pale with disbelief. 

“How is that possible?” he asked

I didn’t know how to answer so I quickly got to work digging the coffin back up. 

Four police officers stood looking down at me from the mouth of the grave. As I pried the coffin two of the officers started heaving from the putrid smell. The other two police officers stared in disbelief as the decomposed corpse was moving around in the coffin, seemingly alive. 

The corpse was a dry shriveled husk with hollowed-out eyes. It made a strange wailing sound and its teeth clattered together as it tried to talk, which made it all the more horrifying. 

Reports of the dead coming back to life started to flood the news. Nobody was sure at first why it was happening or why it was only a small handful from cemeteries around the country. 

The authorities were at a loss and didn’t know what to do with the living dead once they were dug up. Most of the dead that had been dug up were long dead and couldn’t do more than just move around and wail in a strange macabre manner. 

Not all the dead were long dead and decomposed, I was called out to dig out a woman who I had buried a week earlier. The woman’s husband was at the grave to lay some flowers. The poor man's heart nearly stopped when he heard her calling his name from deep below the ground. 

The husband was there ready to embrace his wife, something he thought he wouldn’t get to do until it was his time to cross over. But tears of joy turned to tears of anger when the woman started crying and begging for forgiveness. She confessed that she was cheating on her husband for nearly 2 years, and was hit by a car on the day she was traveling to meet up with her lover. 

At first, I didn”t mind the extra work. Not only was it my Job to bury the dead, I now dug them back up. 

That all changed when I was called to dig up a young child. The young boy was only buried two weeks before. He was only 6 and had died under mysterious circumstances. I remember feeling sad when digging a small hole for his coffin. It was the same sadness I had felt when I had to dig the grave for my beloved wife who sadly passed away a few months earlier. 

It was a call the police had strangely gotten used to. They stood at the foot of the grave as I pried the coffin open. Inside was the deathly pale young boy crying to be left out. 

I picked up his still-cold body and handed him to the police. 

Some of the younger police officers started to cry when the boy called out for his mother. 

“Don’t worry little man, your father is on his way,” explained the police officer. 

The boy became physically distraught at the mention of his father. 

“No, not my dad, please mister. He’s the reason why everything went dark.”

The boy wrapped his arms tightly around the police officer's neck as his father rushed into the grave. 

“He was angry at me for getting in trouble at school and put a pillow over my face,” whispered the boy into the officer's ear.”

As the police arrested the young boy's father I suddenly realized why only a small handful of the dead were coming back to life. It seemed to be the ones who took a secret to their grave. 

When the police officers left the graveyard. I rushed to my wife's grave. I was horrified at the thought of her crying out for me. 

I could hear her screaming to be left out as I dug up her coffin. My heart was racing with fear as my shovel hit the wood of the coffin and her voice could now be heard, clear as day calling my name

Once I got the coffin out of the hole, I began to dig the hole even deeper. At 12 ft deep nobody will be able to hear her cry out from her grave. Making sure she takes the secret of her death to her grave.
