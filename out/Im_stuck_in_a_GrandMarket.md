I never thought a simple grocery trip could turn into a nightmare. My name is Jack, and this is my account of how GrandMart became a twisted labyrinth of horror that has consumed my sanity.

I had recently moved to a quiet town, eager to escape the noise and chaos of city life. Everything seemed perfect: the fresh air, the serene streets, and the promise of peace. But that peace shattered the moment I stepped into GrandMart for the first time.

It was an ordinary evening when I decided to make a quick run to the supermarket. GrandMart was the only store in town that stayed open late, so it had become my go-to for any late-night needs. The store had a familiar, if slightly unsettling, charm. The fluorescent lights flickered faintly, casting a cold, sterile light over the neatly arranged aisles. I noticed that the air had an odd, metallic smell, but I shrugged it off as nothing more than the scent of cleaning supplies.

My initial visits to the store were uneventful. I picked up my groceries and went home, but something was always slightly off. The aisles seemed to shift ever so slightly, and the layout of the store was always just a bit different from the last time I visited. At first, I chalked it up to tiredness or a lack of attention, but as time went on, these small changes began to unsettle me.

Then, one night, the store became something else entirely. I was there after midnight, searching for a few last items. The store was eerily quiet, save for the occasional hum of the overhead lights. The aisles seemed unusually dark, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. The atmosphere felt heavy, almost oppressive.

I turned down an aisle I’d never seen before. The shelves were lined with jars containing grotesque, preserved specimens—disembodied eyes, strange, writhing creatures floating in murky liquids. My heart pounded as I quickly turned around, only to find that the aisle I’d just left had disappeared. Instead, there was a long, narrow passage that seemed to stretch into darkness.

Panic set in as I wandered deeper into the store, trying to find my way back. The store’s layout was shifting, morphing into an ever-expanding maze. No matter how many turns I took, I kept ending up in the same grotesque aisles, each more disturbing than the last. It felt like the store was alive, its layout changing to trap me inside.

Every time I thought I was close to an exit, the store would stretch even further, growing larger and more twisted. I found myself stumbling through aisles filled with bizarre and horrifying items—skinned animal heads, jars of blood, and other macabre artifacts that made my skin crawl. The walls seemed to pulse, and the lights flickered ominously.

The whispers began then—soft, eerie voices that seemed to come from nowhere. At first, they were barely audible, but as the night wore on, they grew louder, more insistent. “You’re not leaving,” they said. “This is your home now. Join us…”

Desperation took over. I sprinted through the aisles, trying to find any hint of an exit. The store seemed to expand endlessly, the aisles stretching into infinity. I could hear footsteps behind me, though whenever I turned, I saw no one. The whispering grew louder, more taunting, as if the store itself were mocking my attempts to escape.

My breaths came in ragged gasps, and my heart raced as I stumbled over something slimy on the floor. I looked down to see what it was—torn, rotting flesh smeared across the tiles. I recoiled in horror, but there was no time to dwell. The store’s walls seemed to close in on me, the aisles converging into a claustrophobic nightmare.

I reached an aisle where the shelves were filled with grotesque, decomposing corpses. Their eyes were wide open, their mouths twisted in silent screams. The sight was so horrifying that I nearly vomited. Just when I thought I couldn’t handle any more, the store seemed to shift again. I found myself in an aisle lined with jars of black, congealed sludge, and the air was thick with a rancid stench.

I stumbled and fell, scraping my knees on the grimy floor. Blood seeped from the cuts on my legs, mixing with the filth beneath me. The whispers grew louder, now almost shouting in my ears. “You’re ours. Forever. There’s no escape…”

My desperation reached a fever pitch as I staggered toward what looked like an exit, only to watch in horror as it receded into the distance. The store expanded around me, growing larger and more twisted with every step I took. The fluorescent lights above flickered erratically, casting eerie shadows that seemed to dance and mock my futile attempts to escape.

The whispers turned into a cacophony of deranged laughter. The walls of the store seemed to close in on me, and the air grew thick with the acrid stench of decay. I felt like I was suffocating, the oppressive atmosphere weighing down on me as I stumbled through the nightmarish aisles.

I can hear them now, the whispers. Closer this time, more insistent. They’re telling me it’s time. Time to give up, to join the others. Maybe they’re right. Maybe it’s the only way out. My eyes are heavy. I can’t fight it anymore.

I’m thinking of just closing my eyes and going to sleep. Maybe that’s the way to get out of here… Perhaps… Yeah, I might do that. If you hear my screams, or see me, please, send help.
