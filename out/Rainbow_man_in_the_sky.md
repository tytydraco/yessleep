This is something deeply ingrained into my head, despite being so young when it took place. I’ve always wanted to share this so maybe someone could help explain what I saw. Through time I’ve started to make more sense of it, but obviously I’m still a little confused. 

I grew up in a rural area in the Midwest, neighbors were spaced out among the trees and winding gravel roads. I was 5 years old and my brother had just been born a few months prior. My mom was excited to go out with her sister in law, even though it was just to the local movie theater. I remember sitting on the bathroom counter while she was doing her makeup “be good tonight” she said, even though she knew I would be. 

The next thing I remember is settling down for the night. Something I loved as a child was making thick pallets of covers on the living room floor and sprawling out to watch the tv. I remember the exact season of Friends I was watching because Joey was a sand mermaid in the opening credits. I remember having a plastic thermos cup and twisting my flavorless bubble gum around the handle as I lost consciousness. 

I wake up. The tv is off and the living room is dark. My dad’s room was right beside the bed room. This is the only part of the entire story that is hazy. I can’t remember if I had dreamt I went into my dad’s room and saw an empty bed or if I had really got up and went to his room first thing. Either way, I was starting to get scared because I was alone in my house in the dark and my dad wasn’t in his room. The only other plausible explanation that entered my mind at the time was, oh he must have went out to his truck. I don’t know why I thought that but I did. I was sure of it. 


I opened the front door with all the might a 5 year old could use in their body and stopped right before my hand reached the screen door handle. My attention was redirected to the night sky that was exposed between a clearing in the trees. I couldn’t believe my eyes, a human silhouette seemingly made of fluorescent rainbow lights appeared in the sky. I didn’t feel fear, at first. I was more confused, or maybe in shock? It began to walk across the sky in the same manner a soldier would. One foot forward, one arm back. It made its way across the sky walking from the left side to the right. The thing took around 10 steps. 

During this time, especially being so young, ration or reason wasn’t present. But then, it noticed me. It knew I was there looking. Whatever it was. As soon as it stopped walking it turned its head towards me and acknowledged my presence. I couldn’t explain it but I KNEW it was looking at me. I almost felt like I saw something I wasn’t supposed to. I felt a cold rush through my entire body and the tears came. I was terrified. I slammed the front door and was paralyzed in fear, I couldn’t move so I just put my back against the door and slunk down to the floor till I’m sat. 

My cries woke my dad up and he ran out of his room to console me, then question me. The one thing, or emotion, I remember the most from this experience is the surprise that my dad was in his room the entire time. I even confronted him about it. This was in the 90s so cell phones didn’t exist to the lower middle class yet. My mom has always had premonitions her entire life, bad feelings before bad things, or even death. She called the house from the theater pay phone and just knew something was wrong. She felt it in her gut.

I remember explaining and giving a direct demonstration to my parents of the way the figure walked. My mom said it was probably the angel of her father who had just passed very recently. I didn’t feel that way. I didn’t feel protected I felt watched. But I didn’t question it. Up until a few years ago, after losing my Christian faith, and reading an article about a woman’s ET experience that was similar to my story, didn’t even consider it could have possibly been an alien or ufo. 

After sharing my story locally in passing to friends, people who lived around the area said their parents had witnessed colorful lights around the same time in the 90s. I know 100% it was real. Even being 5, my rational mind would never allow me to completely hallucinate on that level.
