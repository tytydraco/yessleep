I first noticed it during an early morning run. A blue tarp covered the opening, about ten by ten feet.

*Must be water damage.* I thought. *Maybe they need help.* 

I decided to stop by, see if they needed any assistance with the repairs.

The sound of scattered footsteps erupted from within as I knocked. I waited several seconds, then… 

“Morning,” I said, putting on a gentle face. 

The man was middle-aged, perhaps fifty, with pepper-flecked hair and a trim beard. He had green eyes and an emaciated face. Other than his malnourished features, he seemed normal.

“Yes?”  

“Name’s Tony.” I smiled and extended my hand. “I live just down the street.”

He stared at my palm with disgust. I stepped back, embarrassed.

“I couldn’t help but notice you had a hole in your roof. I’d be happy to check it out. It’s supposed to rain next week.”

“Thanks for your concern, but I’ll be fine.” 

He started to shut the door. 

“Wait. I run my own business.” I handed him my card. “If you need repairs, I’m available. What’s your name?”

“Eugene,” he said, then shut the door.

I stopped by Gladys’ place the next morning. At seventy-eight years, she was our oldest resident. Aside from a few stray cats that lapped up tuna cans at her door, she was completely alone. 

“You doing okay, Gladys?” I asked, ducking into the kitchen. 

“Still breathing,” she admitted.

I glanced out her kitchen window. Eugene’s house was across the street. The hole in his roof was larger. The blue tarp was attached to a green one, encompassing twenty by twenty feet. 

“You know anything about that house?”

“Ah, yes, the spooky place.” She adjusted her spectacles. “Never liked the man who lives there. Only comes out on rare occasions. In fact, I’ve maybe seen him five times since he’s lived here.”

***

I continued on with my week. Each morning I’d go run, then head off to work. I had endless jobs piling up, and the daily exercise helped me de-stress.

I was so busy that it took me days to realize the hole on Eugene’s roof had quadrupled in size.

*What the hell?* I slowed to a trot. 

Sure enough, there were different colored tarps arranged all over the roof. It was like a fumigator had set up shop.

*He’s got a serious problem.* I mused. *How’s he going to take care of it?*

Call it OCD or curiosity, but I decided to stop by after work, bringing a cup of decaf coffee.  

*If he doesn’t want to see me, at least he’ll like this treat.* 

My stomach flip-flopped when I spotted Eugene out front, dressed in colorful robes and engaging in a violent dance. His movements were so erratic, he seemed to be participating in a macabre ritual. 

“Eugene?” I called out, slowing my walk to avoid startling him.

He stopped and turned, his face masked with a panicked expression.

“Is everything… alright?”

“Please, leave me alone.”

***

That night I stopped by Gladys’ place, confusion etched onto my face. 

“You look like you’ve seen a ghost, Tony.”

“I think I have…” I thought about what I had seen, sucked my front teeth. “I went by Eugene’s place. He was all dressed up. Doing this terrifying dance.”

Gladys’ eyes clouded over. “He was… dancing?”

“Yeah. And he seemed in pain.”

“Get in,” Gladys said and pulled me forward. 

“Wait. What’s going on?”

“Just get in and I’ll tell you everything.”

The two of us sat at her table, peering over steaming cups of Earl Grey. 

“I’m afraid I haven’t been fully honest with you, Tony.”

I wiped sweat from my brow. *What could this sweet woman be so worried about?*

“That man… at the house… isn’t just a random neighbor. He’s a spirit guide. It’s his job to keep evil beings away from our neighborhood.”

*Evil beings?* “Are you pulling my leg, Gladys?”

“Heavens no!” She waved the comment aside. “Did you know that this entire county used to be indigenous land?”

I shook my head.

“When we drove the people out, something evil took their place.”

“Like demons or…”

“Hateful spirits. Every so often, one gets out. People like Eugene use their pain to keep them away.” 

“This doesn’t make any sense.”

Gladys pulled the sleeve of her shirt back to reveal hundreds of tiny cuts on her arm.

“Jesus!” I leapt back, bowling over my seat. “Why are you showing me this?”

“Because human suffering is the only thing that keeps them away. We all take turns harming ourselves. It’s a burden we bear in this community.”

I was so shaken. This gentle woman who had baked me cakes and shared stories about her grandchildren was unfolding a nightmarish story.  

“So Eugene is scaring the spirits off.”

“The suffering dance is the final step in the process. The chosen undergoes a ritual of torment. At the end, they sacrifice themselves. I’m afraid tonight is the last time we’ll see Eugene.”

I shrank back against the wall, in shock. 

“This can’t be real.”

“It is.” She stood, placed her hands on mine. “Most of our neighbors know about this. I wanted to tell you, but you’re so kind. I didn’t want to burden you.”

My breath shook as I stared into Gladys’ eyes. I peeked over her shoulder to Eugene’s house. 

The lights were on. 

***

“Wait! Tony!” Gladys trailed me as I marched down the street. “If you interrupt the session, everything will be lost!”

By now most of the neighbors had exited their homes. Some were aware of what I was doing. Others were as innocent as I was. 

“He’s going toward the house!” A voice shouted. “Don’t let him in!”

I increased my speed, ignoring everything. I had to put an end to this insanity. Hear from Eugene first-hand that this was a cruel joke pulled on the gullible neighbors.

By the time I reached his driveway, a large gathering had assembled behind me. 

“Tony!” It was Gladys, shaking. “Please, don’t go in there.”

I looked at everyone. Their faces were worn and hardened. A few hands held guns. Some were pointed at me.

I backed away, raising my palms. “I just want to check on him…”

Then, the front door opened and something came out.

“Oh Jesus.”

It was Eugene. He was nude. Jagged cuts were all over his body. Strange symbols. Wretched diagrams. His eyes were hollow and his breathing faint. He took a few steps toward me, then collapsed. Dead.

“The sacrifice has been rejected!” Gladys screamed.

The most despairing, wretched sound emitted from the house. 

I turned, seeing… something burst out from the tarped patchworks of the roof. Its body had spider-like limbs and jagged spines along its back. Two bat-like wings stretched out from what appeared to be shoulders.

“Our judgment is upon us!” Gladys fell to her knees, praying.

In a burst of chaos, gunshots were fired. Voices begged. People screamed. I felt something lift me by my arms and haul me into the sky. 

It was the abomination from the roof. Soaring higher, clutching me in its crow-black talons. A gaping jaw full of yellow teeth grinned as a forked tongue smacked against my lips, smothering them in cat-like saliva.

“Take it down!”  

A gunshot rang out and the behemoth dropped me, screeching, as hot blood poured over my face.

***

When I woke up, I was lying in the street. Gladys’ face was over mine. 

“Tony, you’re alive.”

I sat up. The entire neighborhood was gathered around me. Some familiar faces were missing. Others were bruised and bleeding. What had happened? 

“The spirits accepted their new guide,” Gladys croaked, downcast. “They’ve agreed to let us live, as long as we continue our suffering.”

*Our suffering.* 

I glanced to where Eugene’s house used to be. The entire building and its surroundings were gone, like a bomb had been dropped on it, leaving only a crater.

A searing pain shot through my legs. I pulled up my left pant leg. A diagram of macabre sketches were marked into my flesh. 

“I’m sorry, Tony,” Gladys sighed. “But you’re the new vessel.”
