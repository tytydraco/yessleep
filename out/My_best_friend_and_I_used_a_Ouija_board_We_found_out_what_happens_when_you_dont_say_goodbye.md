We were so stupid. 

My childhood best friend, Lilly, and I had managed to find a Ouija board in a Halloween store. We were the type of middle school girls to wear all black and think we were cool for listening to underground metal bands. So naturally, we had to cross contacting a spirit off of our bucket list. 

I didn’t think we’d actually manage to reach anything. Ouija boards are mass manufactured by Hasbro, for fuck’s sake. No way they’d actually work. Right? 

I was dead wrong. 

Lilly was the one who set everything up. Her parents were more laid back than mine were. Mom and Dad already weren’t fans of my heavy black eyeliner and crummy attitude, so bringing a Ouija board into their home sounded like a great way to get myself grounded. Lilly’s house was the natural choice. 

Lilly ushered me into her room the second I stepped through the door. Her excitement was bubbling over. She clearly put a lot more stock into the paranormal than I did. 

“I’ve been waiting for this all week,” she said, an eager glint in her eyes. “I’m pumped.” 

“This is really something,” I replied, drinking in my surroundings. 

Dusk wasn’t for another three hours, but Lilly’s room was dark as pitch. Thick blankets were hung over the windows despite the fact that she already had blackout curtains. A circle of candles glowed on the floor, acting as our only light source. The Ouija board sat in the center of the room like a crown jewel. Something about the whole setup made me uneasy. 

“Come, sit!” Lilly said, claiming her spot to the right of the board. I did as I was told, taking a seat opposite her. 

“Put your hand on the planchette,” she demanded, her gleeful demeanor melting into one of stern determination. Truthfully, she was beginning to frighten me. But I didn’t tell her that. Instead, I followed her orders and placed my hand beside hers. 

“Hello! Spirits! Is anyone in the room with us?” 

Her call was met with a lingering silence. 

“Is anyone there? Anyone from the other side?” 

Nothing. Just another moment of tension before she called out again. 

“If anyone can hear me, give me a sign.” 

“Lilly, I don’t think this is-” 

The planchette suddenly began to move. It rapidly shifted, first to the letter H, then to E, L, and O. 

*Hello.* 

My blood turned to ice. “Lilly, this isn’t funny. Stop moving the planchette.” 

“I… I’m not.” She failed to meet my gaze. I knew just by the tone of her voice that she was telling the truth. 

“Who are you?” Lilly continued, a slight tremor in her voice. The planchette began to move again. 

S-A-M. 

“Nice to meet you, Sam,” Lilly said, regaining some of her prior confidence. “I’m going to ask you some questions if that’s okay.” 

The planchette shifted to *yes.* 

“When were you born?” 

*1-8-4-3*

“When did you die?” 

*1-8-6-2*

“That’s really young. Were you killed?” 

*Yes.* 

“By who?” 

*E-V-E-R-Y-O-N-E.*

Lilly and I shared a glance. I was terrified to know where this was going, but a morbid curiosity gnawed at me. I decided to ask a question of my own. 

“By everyone, do you mean the whole town? Were you hung?” The planchette darted aggressively as soon as the question left my lips. 

*Yes. Yes. Yes.* 

I could feel the color drain from my face. Lilly asked the question that I couldn’t bring myself to. 

“What did you do?” 

There was a pause before the planchette began to move. 

*M-U-R-D-E-R*

At that moment, I made one of the stupidest decisions of my life. I stood up. 

“Lilly, I can’t do this anymore. I want to stop,” I said, taking my hand off the planchette and rising to my feet on shaky legs. 

Lilly didn’t have time to respond. We could only watch in horror as the candles began to extinguish on their own, one by one. Only the one between us stayed lit, its flame dancing weakly. 

My bottom lip trembled and I could feel tears welling up. Lilly was frozen with fear, her eyes locked on me. 

And then, the last candle was snuffed out, plunging us into darkness.

We screamed, ran for the door, and raced out the house and into the light. If anyone else had been home, they would have thought we’d lost our minds. The pair of us collapsed on the front lawn, tears streaming down our cheeks. We stayed there for a long time, letting the adrenaline rush fade.

Once the fear dissipated, we stood, shared a glance, and walked back inside, turning on all the lights in the house until Lilly’s parents got home. 

\*\*\*

I kept my mouth shut about the incident. Mom and Dad would have gone berserk if they’d known I’d been messing with a Ouija board. But staying quiet became harder and harder to do when strange things started occurring around the house. 

One night I woke up with weird bruises on my wrist. Then my things started to go missing, only to reappear hours later, right where I’d left them. Words began appearing on the bathroom mirror, unprompted:

*Hello.* 

*I see you.* 

*No escape.* 

After nearly a week, it was clear that the odd occurrences were taking a toll on me. I could barely manage to get a wink of sleep, and my grades suffered as a result. A few of my classmates even commented about how tired I looked. I had to do something. 

So I called Lilly, the only person I could confide in. 

“Hey,” she said from the other end of the line. 

“Hey. How are you holding up?” 

There was a pause. “Hannah, I’m scared. Really weird stuff has been happening, and I… I just don’t know what to do.” 

Her voice was tinged with a mixture of exhaustion and fear. My heart sank for her, but a small part of me was glad to have someone who knew what I was going through. 

“We’ll figure out how to get rid of this thing. Ask your parents if I can spend the night tomorrow. It’ll all be okay.” 

I heard a sniffle. “I will. I really hope you’re right.” 

\*\*\*

The next day, I found myself standing on Lilly’s front porch ringing the doorbell. After a few seconds, Lilly appeared behind the screen door. She was sickly and pale with deep purple bags under her eyes. She’d obviously had it worse than I did. 

“My parents won’t be home tonight,” she said, allowing me into the house. “They’re at a concert a few hours away.” 

I nodded as I followed Lilly down the hall to her room. Once we got there, I noted that it was a stark contrast from my previous visit. All the lights were on, the curtains were open, and the Ouija board was nowhere in sight. 

“So, I don’t think you’re going to like this,” I said, wringing my hands. “I know I don’t. But… we’re going to need to use the Ouija board again.” 

Lilly’s eyes grew wide. “I don’t want to do that,” she said, averting her gaze. 

“I don’t either, but I think we need to say goodbye to Sam. That’s probably the only way to get rid of him.” 

Lilly paused. I could tell that she was turning my words over in her head. 

“Okay,” she said, a stern determination overtaking her expression, “I’ll do whatever it takes to get this thing to leave.” 

Moments later, the Ouija board was set up. We didn’t bother with the candles or turning out the lights. Neither of us were comfortable with that. 

Lilly seemed hesitant to start, so I took the lead as we placed our hands on the planchette. “Sam, are you in the room with us?” 

No response. I tried again. “Sam, we *know* you’re in the room with us. Give us a sign that you can hear me.” 

The planchette began to move. 

*H-I-T-H-E-R-E*

My heart dropped. I didn’t like that answer. 

“We need you to leave us alone. I’m going to say goodbye, and we’re going to be done with you.” 

The planchette angrily flew to the word no. 

*No. No. No.*

Suddenly, the door to Lilly’s room slammed shut. She released a whimper and jumped instinctively. That was the worst thing she could have done - because she momentarily removed her hand from the planchette. 

An overwhelming sense of dread settled into my stomach. The lights flickered, and the planchette began to move once again. My heart raced as it flew around the board, and my head felt heavy as it spelled another word. 

*N-I-G-H-T N-I-G-H-T*

That’s the last thing I remember before everything went black. 

\*\*\*

I awoke lying facedown on the carpet, a searing pain shooting through the flesh of my back. I ran my hands over my skin, and they came away red. My face drained of color. 

“Lilly. Lilly, what the fuck happened?” I said, wincing as I rose to my feet. I received no response. Something was *very* wrong. 

I glanced around the room. When I found my best friend, I screamed. 

Lilly was slumped against the wall, her eyes wide and unblinking. Her neck was stained a deep red. Written across her forehead were three letters that have haunted me for the rest of my life. 

SAM

I scrambled to pull out my phone. I called the police, trying to feel Lilly’s neck for a pulse. 

She was cold to the touch. 

I was frantic when the operator picked up. “9-1-1, what is your emergency?” 

“Hello, my friend is hurt, I need help! Please, send an ambulance right-” 

In my frenzy, my eyes fell to the Ouija board, and the words caught in my throat. I found myself paralyzed with terror as the weight of it all crashed down on me. 

The blood-splattered planchette was sitting over the word [goodbye.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorJunkie123/)
