Oh god, this is efd up.

I (27M) have a girlfriend (25F). We have been dating for a long while, ever since high school. She is (well, was I guess), the love of my life.

Im sorry for grammar as Im typing this as fast as I can

Everything was going smoothly until a couple of months. She read a book from her teacher, Mr Raymond. He wrote it actually. It was a collection of short horror stories, every story was written like a witness account from a different person. Even though they were short stories, they revolved around sexual themes. I gotta say, I read some myself and felt them to be pretty steamy despite all the gore.

Mr Raymond was a nice guy, Ive met him before and he wouldn't make a move on my girlfriend. I wasnt worried about that at all. 

In fact, upon reading the short stories my girlfriend became very active sexually. She wanted me, and wanted me bad.

It was awesome at first. Just stripping my clothes whenever we were together and jumping my bones. I was pretty burned out from all the sex tbh. 

Anyway, fast forward a few weeks and she started wanting more. First a few slaps on my face. Then punching, licking me. Drops of molten wax on my belly and crotch  very close to my genitals.

It was hurting a bit but she was so passionate about it that I couldn't make her stop. I didnt want her to, if Im being honest.

Someone's knocking now

But she started biting me. Gentle at first, then painfully. My buttocks, thighs, arms... Big bite marks started forming untill she bit off a piece of my lip. It was painful and I screamed. She got off of my screaming, ecstatic. Like she was high on something.

I started looking through her stuff to see if she had drugs with her. Needles or anything but I couldn't find anything

We were barely talking at that time since all the time we had together was either on the bed or hot tub. She growled during sex which I gotta be honest turned me on a lot.

But one day it was too... How can i say? Like a beast? Or a monster? The growl wasnt hot anymore, it was just really scary, as if that person wasnt my girlfriend Anymore.

I talked to her when we were driving back from the town library. I said I was a bit scared of how our sex life turned out. She apologized profusely. Said she loved me more than anything in this life and would do everything to pleasure me.

She said that with a crooked smile. I felt uneasy but took her word for it. 

Our first night together after that talk she brought a friend. A super hot friend that Ive never seen before. Melissa lets call her. Melissa was into submission. I was supposed to boss her around and slap her. It was weird at first but in about 5 minutes I got the hang of commanding them around. They called me their master.

After a while more  they jumped on me and started scrathing my back and arms. It got progressively more painful untill I asked them to stop. But that wasn't the safe word. I had completely forgotten about it so the scratching started to leave marks, red spots,blood.... They stopped when they saw and licked it. This was so disgusting I wanted to puke. 

I asked my girlfriend for no more ladies. She winked. Next night she brought a guy. He seemed knowledgeable (if that makes any sense) and very familiar. We had drinks first and then he showed up at the door. Ive must've been out of my mind because everything is just haze now. But i was definitely in bed with them. They were worshipping me??? 

I knew I was bossing them and the night slips my memories. Could she have put something in my drink? There was so much blood in the sheets this morning. And the guy never left. He was tall and was completely naked except for a big amulet hanging from his neck. 

This was yesterday. I know she has something planned for tonight as well because they're all here today.

I asked for no more worshipping but they dont listen to me anymore. I feel fat and slow and dont even know what Im gonna do in bed. She was my sweet heart, we love each other, I dont wanna leave the toilet. 

I hear this weird music, with strings and short tempos, there's some chanting as well. I don't wanna leave this bathroom but they keep knocking on the door, and I swear I hear scratching as well but all the blood in the floor makes no sense.
