When I was about nine years old, my family lived on a beach, a little alcove covered in trees, the cooing of birds, and floury white sand that dusted your toes. The kind of tropical oasis they make beer commercials out of, the ones the locals keep to themselves. I was lonely then, I was being homeschooled, and the homes nearby were only occupied for part of the year by retirees. We were there because my grandfather had gone missing long enough to be declared dead, and the property had been bequeathed it to my father, my father said he couldn’t bear to abandon what he’d be given. Not that they’d ever complain about it. Though a particular incident marred those days for me.  


I was holding my mother’s hand as we walked along the beach looking for shells, I had big cargo shorts on to carry as much as I could, and I picked up plenty of tiny, fragmented rocks and empty clams. The sky had a pink hue, and a wind moaned and ran through my hair. I shivered, and tugged at my mom’s hand to go inside. I looked back at the ocean, and I saw it, a golden light, below the surface of the water, like a lantern. It moved back and forth, and emanated a hospitality. As if the lights were left on to welcome an old friend coming into town.   


The frogs chirped “ko-kee”, “ko-kee” and the wind howled, and the light in the water seemed to glow a little brighter as the ocean dimmed under the setting sun. My mom tugged at my hand then “It’s getting dark” she averred, her forehead curled into her eyebrows, and her voice bore a tone of consternation. I wanted to walk toward the water, I wanted to follow the glow. I stood, somnambulistic, my toes digging into the fine powder that caked the earth. The sun drooping further behind the earth, the light, dancing, twinkling, all but calling me toward the waves that lapped and clapped.   
  
My mother tugged harder, starting to drag my bare feet across the sand, I could feel dew on her palm, and for just a moment I thought I could slip from them, and run into the ocean to greet my welcoming friend. But we walked, we trudged, up the little hill and into our home. I could still hear the frogs, and the wind, just a little more faintly behind the window. I could still see the glow, soft and ebullient, lighting the water and the water’s little waves.   


My father came over and drew the curtain, and I screamed. “I want to look at the ocean!” tears flowed down my cheeks, I felt a panic I had never felt, a tightness in my stomach, a need, my skin pricked me like tiny needles, beads of sweat fomented at my knuckles, as my fingers dug into my palm.   
My father refused, and told me that he couldn’t, “You must stay in at night, you mustn’t when it’s dark; you mustn’t look from this window” his voice was sonorous and foreboding, the words warbled, and ached in my head, I continued to cry, I didn’t answer. “Promise!” my dad’s voice grew, and the fear of angering who was to me a giant, elicited an acquiescence.   


“I promise” I said, my fingers still digging into my palms. My mother walked me to the bathroom where I brushed my teeth then we came into my room where I changed into my nightshirt. A long heavy shirt that reached down to my ankles, it was white with a large brown coffee splotch. It belonged to my father.   


I lied in bed, a blanket up to my chin, staring at the little shapes the popcorn-ceiling made. Scenes of men fighting monsters, of dragons, have creatures with strange eyes, and tiny bugs that froze in mid skitter. All little dots that morphed into new shapes whenever my eyes would turn. I’d look at these shapes until I fell asleep, dreaming of whatever scenes were stirred. My mother sat at the foot of my bed, and softly clenched my ankle from over the comforter.   


She spoke, “I know what you saw at the ocean today, and I want to tell you what’s down there” I didn’t say a word, and she continued. “The light we saw in the ocean is the old witch, and she uses a lantern to lure little boys and feeble old men to the depths” her voice was humorless, and flat.   
“If you follow the light, the witch will grab you, she will take you under, and you’ll never see any of us again. Believe me, she took your grandfather, and she wants all of us. Your father and me never go out past dark, we never look out the windows at night, and you can’t either.”  
“But the light was so friendly!” I pleaded; I couldn’t imagine that something so sweet could be insidious. “What does she look like?” I asked.   


She has a human face, and long tentacles that grab hold of you, when she opens her mouth there’s that yellow glow, luring you to the back of her throat. Her teeth are sharp, and they grind through bone. She wafts and glides in the water, entrancing you like a tick-tick-ticking of a clock” she annunciated every click. She clenched my leg a little harder, and I winced. She got up, kissed me on the forehead, and walked out, flipping the light-switch as she did so. In the dark I imagined the horrible witch, her teeth digging into my arm, my heart pounding as I struggled to breathe, adumbrated by the depths.   


But I had an urge to look at the window toward the ocean, to see the glow once again, if I didn’t walk out there, I thought there was no harm in only looking. I could hear my parents whispering in their room, I needed to wait until they were asleep. So, I lied there, little spots and figures floated in the darkness, and I struggled to stay awake. When I thought the whispering had died, and that my parents must be asleep, I crept my way to the window, and drew up the curtain. I could see it right away, that glow, floating in the water, beckoning.   


I couldn’t resist it for long, and I reached up to the doorknob, and twisted it as gently as I could. It creaked a little, and I hoped my parents wouldn’t hear. I walked out on the sand, the frogs chirped “ko-kee”, and the wind howled. The glow light beckoned, and that water splashed its little waves, it was surely safe to go in.   


The sky was dark so that the end of the ocean touched the bottom of the sky, and I walked toward it until my feet were in the water, rivulets streaming in my toes; I walked further in, following the glow, feeling the cool water on my ankles, sparks of water jettisoning up my calves at the occasional wave slightly larger than the others. I had to follow the glow.   


Soon I couldn’t touch the ground, and I was wading in place, just above the light, I could barely see except for what that golden glow illuminated. I heard my mother then, screaming, and running onto the beach “Come back!” she shouted, “Come in!” her voice shook.   


In a moment of compulsion, I dove in, I was further out than I knew, but I swam until I reached the bottom. I could hear the voice of my mother, distorted and truncated by the screen of the water above. My foot hit something, and I turned to look, in the glow of the light, I saw a cinder block, and a corpse tied to a rope. I screamed, bubbles filling the water, taking away my breath. The body was swollen with shades of blue and purple. It’s face cracked, and its hair dangled in the wind. I tried to swim away, but something caught my foot, I thought it must be grabbing me.  


I pulled, and thought of that sea witch with her tentacles, and her razor teeth, this must have been her meal, and now she was coming for me. I would stay tied to a rock while my body ballooned and ripened. I looked back at the body dangling in the water, and I recognized it. It was my grandfather, and there were holes in his shirt, something had cut through him multiple times. I could hear my mother’s feet stomping, running into the ocean. Finally, I broke through the grasp of whatever was holding me, and made it halfway to shore, my mother was in the water to meet me. We walked out of the water and she held me, both of us soaking and shaking.   


There was some seaweed wrapped around my ankle; my mother stopped for a moment. “Did you see anything down there?” My mother didn’t sound scared, but something else, it sounded almost menacing, as if she were daring me to tell her what I saw. Something told me I shouldn’t, and so I shook my head.   
“Good” she sighed, and we walked back into the house.
