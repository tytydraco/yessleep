*I was in shock as I kept reading that same sentence over and over, I am the cause of the zombie apocalypse. I kept reading more and here's what else the text message said, I made a virus that I named Zhang, it causes the brain to be set on doing one thing.* 

&#x200B;

*Eating humans, the first zombie to get this will have a certain amount of abilities that will be passed on once infecting another human, the first zombie abilities will be speed, intelligence, crawl, climbing, and dodging. Once the first zombie infects a human that human has a 97% chance of getting 1 ability.*

&#x200B;

 *2% chance of getting 2 abilities, and 1% chance of getting all of the abilities. Same thing with any other zombie! Hope this helps! Good luck in surviving the Zhang zombie apocalypse! I put my phone down and thoughts started to race through my head, that zombie that just killed that entire group had 4 abilities.* 

&#x200B;

*Which means that more and likely it's the first zombie. I came out the closet and ran to the window to look at the zombie. I didn't see it at first until I looked down and saw it climbing up to the window. Before backing up to get the baseball bat and knife I saw that it was the same zombie from the school.* 

&#x200B;

*I realized that the first zombie was the one at my school and is here now. I quickly got my baseball bat and knife but when I turned around the zombie was there and behind the zombie, the window was open. I slowly started to back up but the zombie ran so fast towards me I panicked and dropped the baseball bat and knife.*

&#x200B;

 *It jumped on me and I hit the floor hard. The zombie took advantage and tried to bite me but I got the knife just in time and jammed it into the zombies mouth. It made a loud shriek, then jumped through the window.* 

&#x200B;

*I was on the ground for a while shaken until I realized that that shriek that the zombie just made caused the zombies to go somewhere. Realizing my only chance of escaping I got up and grabbed a pillow from my bed and then proceeded to throw the pillow out the window.* 

&#x200B;

*I then jumped out the window and landed on the pillow so I wouldn't injure my legs. I ran towards my bike but noticed that there weren't any zombie bodies on the ground. But I ignored it and got on my bike, and pedaled away.* 

&#x200B;

*As I was pedaling I looked around and saw about 2-3 groups of zombies walking towards one direction. I was curious to follow them but wanted to take advantage of no zombies being around so I kept pedaling until I was out of town. All of this happened about 7 years ago and I am now a young adult in another town.* 

&#x200B;

*I'm thinking about going back to the town to see what's happened but I don't want to risk being stuck in that town again. Although this is the end of how the zombie Apocalypse started at Millard's High School. Now im going to tell you how the zombie Apocalypse ends at my apartment.*
