((my first ever post here! I'm a fairly new writer. please give feedback positive or not! keep it nice pls)







I’ve had my fair share of clients and a fair share of stories that have kept me up at night. Specializing in paranormal trauma and schizophrenia, I had been surrounded by these tales my whole life. 



I live in a nice, modern complex, and I live alone. The building is quite old, but I had never had issues up until a few weeks ago. To keep this ethical, I will not be naming my client, let’s just call him Mike. Mike has been suffering from paranormal schizophrenia, having seen visions of gruesome deaths of his loved ones, then later seeing it happen right in front of his eyes. At the age of 8, he witnessed his fathers hanging, even attempting to stop it.



Ever since then, he has seen his father roaming around his house, a noose tied around his neck, Mike believes that his father has sinister plans to harm his mother.



Last night, I had a session with Mike. He had mentioned something about a dead twin who is looking for some sort of revenge. Possibly revenge for her killer? He didn’t know, but all he knew was that she was a twin. For the first time, I’ve actually felt.. A presence upon us, in the room. 



My limbs felt stiff. A chill ran up my spine. Mike had a shocked look on his face as he was staring at something behind me.



I had originally thought that maybe whoever he is seeing is.. Behind me. But when I looked behind me, nothing was there. It was in front of me, right up to my face. I had never seen a spirit so clearly. There was something in her eyes that presented her as… familiar. 

  
“I told you, she’s real.” is all Mike could muster up, as if I haven’t believed him all this time. I nodded, trying to look away- I tried to pull my eyes away, but I felt like I was looking at a car crash– I couldn’t look away even though I wanted to. 



*beep beep beep* I looked to the side and the alarm was going off signifying that the session was over. “So.. next week same t-” I couldn’t even finish my sentence before he rushed out of the room as he ran to the waiting room.



“Mommy, mommy!” he cried, “she told me mean things!” He buried his head in her arms, I had no idea what he meant. “I.. what?” I said, shaking my head. His mother grabbed his hand and rushed him out of the building. 



After that, I never saw Mike again. 



I did hear from him though, he would send me emails about how he was finally free from the girl who would follow him around the house, whining as she clutched her stomach.



I tried to think.. What did he mean?



Until I remembered that one day when I was 15 and..



I did it. I killed her.
