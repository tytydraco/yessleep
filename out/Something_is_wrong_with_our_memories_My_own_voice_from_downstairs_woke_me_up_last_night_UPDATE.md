If you aren't caught up with what's going on, here's the [first post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qcea76/something_is_wrong_with_my_wife_and_is_memories/)

***

After explaining what transpired in the last 2 days to my wife after her attack on our front door, it left us both with more questions than answers. I'm still not convinced something supernatural is happening to us. I was reading on a subreddit post talking about how this guy kept finding written post-it notes with creepy ass messages on them, thinking his landlord snuck into his house and wrote them. Turns out he had CO in his room and was writing the notes to himself and just had symptoms of amnesia, along with headaches (which we aren't having) that come from CO exposure.

So I got on the phone with an HVAC company. I claimed it was of utmost urgency. He said that most guys he has in my area have fully booked schedules and told me that I shouldn't hold my breath for a quick response. Not exactly willing to drop hundreds of dollars on staying at a hotel for upwards of a week, I prayed that a technician would be available sooner rather than a month from now.

***

An hour later, he called back and said they had someone available to come in the morning, and I quietly whispered *'yes!'* in a celebratory tone as the voice on the other end told me the technician's number and said to call him if I have any more questions or need to reschedule. I then hung up and comforted my distressed wife that it was going to be okay, and it would all be figured out in the morning. I asked Jaslyn if we could ask her sister to let us stay for the night, but she was reluctant, considering she lives about 3 hours from us. Which isn't great since it was around 10 PM by the time we ended the call with the technician, and going to a hotel for a walk-in probably by that point wasn't a viable option.

We decided, stupidly, to just brave the night as it was and go to sleep. We went upstairs and fell onto our bed, with my wife's favorite show playing. I drifted off to sleep quickly after, surprisingly, despite my catnap that lasted well into the evening, I slept like a brick.

***

Later that night, I was woken up by some sort of rustling. I immediately threw my arm to the left side of the bed, looking over to my wife to check if she was there. She was. Then I heard it again. It wasn't rustling, more like a *gasp* or maybe a *hiss*.

We have a water heater just outside of our bedroom that makes similar noises, but this didn't sound like it was coming from the hallway. It sounded like it was coming from farther away. Maybe from downstairs. Not sure if I was suffering from some fucked up Carbon Monoxide-induced hallucination, I got up, made sure to check my phone, 3:31 AM. '*Son of a bitch'* I whispered. Not wanting to wake my wife, I crept out of my door quietly and looked down the stretch of stairs leading to our living room. I heard another noise.

This time it was a

*"Sister"*

followed by a

*"It's gonn... be ok...ay"* then *"Three... hou-you think I'm fat?"*

and finally,

*"What the... think... thi... were you thinking?"*

It sounded like my wife and I, *kind of,* if that makes sense. I could feel sweat pooling under my arms, and my hands went numb out of fear. I've been afraid before, had a 12-gauge pointed at me once. But nothing, and I mean **nothing**, has made me feel more scared than hearing my own voice practicing how to fucking speak. See, up to this point, it was a wife out of bed, a phone on top of a bookcase, but this was beyond any kind of normal hallucination. I just stood there, looking down, terrified that the thing downstairs would eventually peek its head into the stairwell, followed by a long, gangly neck and a face that mimicked my wife. Or worse, me. I was hoping fight or flight would kick in, and I'd just run back to my bedroom and call the police, but I was stuck between wondering whether this was even real or just some hallucination. 

I don't know if it was sheer irrationality or cognitive failure, but I slowly but surely took one step down into the stairwell. I remember when I was a kid, I'd always sneak downstairs down my impossibly creaky stairwell late at night to play games on my laptop. Since my mom's room was right next to the staircase, along with her almost superhuman hearing, I had to memorize the "weak spots" on the stairs. This eventually grew into a habit that I still frequent, even as a grown man in the house that I own.

So as I put one foot onto the spots that I prayed to God hadn't developed their own creaks, I also had hoped that my memory wouldn't fail me in its hour of need. I was now halfway down the staircase when my foot touched the edge of about the 8th stair, and it made a subtle and quiet...

*nnk...*

Like the sound of adjusting in a leather office chair. That feeling I had whenever this would happen to me as a kid, the tension of impending doom when wondering if my mom had heard me and was about to yell down to ground me, was amplified by 1000. About 15 seconds passed after this nearly unnoticeable sound was conceived when the *thing* made another petrifying mimicry.

It whispered,

"*Yes!"*

Accurate to the small celebration I made earlier when I was on the phone with HVAC.

It went silent. I was in an almost mannequin-like position, the ball of my foot still resting on the edge of the stairs for what felt like days. In retrospect, this sounded completely irrational, but something ran through my head.

*If I'm going to die, I at least want to see what killed me.*

So I planted my other foot on the stair, somehow not causing another creak, and peered over the small opening in my stairwell's hall that gives a full view of the living room. It wasn't a full moon, so other than the small, variously colored power indicators emanating from our electronics, I couldn't see much until my eyes adjusted. When they did, I saw the shape of a man, maybe a woman, standing in the middle of our living room.

Remember when I said that the voices sounded *kind of* like my wife? Well, imagine your father, your mother, friends, or any faces you've seen in your life that your brain has a sort of "snapshot" of. Thing is, the snapshot of those faces isn't 100% accurate; it's your brain using memories to build a face in your mind, but it's never completely perfect. That's the best way to describe what I saw. Its face was everyone I knew, at once, faces I had in my memory, crudely put together to try and form a good depiction. It was almost like those creepy police sketches. Its body looked disproportionate in every area, yet solid, almost as if they had been assembled from memory rather than intentional anatomy. The sensation I felt is one I can't even begin to describe, and my brain couldn't begin to process seeing more than one face on someone. I just stared at it, and it stared at me. I was terrified but also perplexed.

It said,

*"Can you come down and take out the trash?"*

In my Mother's voice. Only, it sounded like it was over a phone speaker. My mom would sometimes call me to ask me or tell me something when I was in my room instead of yelling upstairs back when I was younger.

Its or their mouths didn't move when speaking, when it uttered,

*"Be grateful for your gir...l...girlfriend. You're lucky to have her—You make me so happy, Jaslyn."*

First, in the voice of my fucking psychology teacher, Mr. Wenzel. Then it shifted to *my* voice. I recognized that phrase from my old professor when I was coming to him to ask him how to be less anxious about Jaslyn when we first started dating. The second phrase, my phrase, was something I say to my wife frequently to show appreciation for the love she's given me these past 9 years.

*"Staying up this late every night is eventually gonna kill you, Reid."* Voice of my dad.

*"Oh, I can not WAIT to see you when I get back."* Voice of my wife.

I really wish I thought to grab the 9-iron Jaslyn's father gave me because what it said next sounded like a garbled threat.

*"Can you come down—so—I can—come—up-...?"*

*"I can—see you—I can—kill you, Reid."*

It said this in the voices it had just previously used, mixing them together like a terrifying version of Bumblebee from Transformers. I don't think my own existence was aware to me. It kind of felt like I was just some camera and that this THING was the only thing in the room. Then it just said my name.

"*Reid."*

*"Reid."*

*"Reid."*

*"Reid"*

*"Reid."*

In the same exact way that my dad said it. Over and over and over, without changing tone. I quickly came back to reality after this, blood returning to my feet, almost as if this was a jump-start to a dead battery.

I clobbered up the stairs like a maniac, tripping over myself and getting on all fours. Still hearing my name in that God-awful monotone sound. It felt like forever before I reached the top, where I slammed into the wall trying to make a sharp left to my bedroom. I collected myself quickly and practically rammed into the bedroom door, closing it behind me. My wife was already awake, her lamp on. I guess she heard me causing a hurricane in our hallway. I yelled "Cal-call the police!" while pushing our dresser against the door.

"Reid, wh-"

"Don't ask why. Just do it, God, I'm begging you, please!"

As I was halfway done with pushing our 150 lb armoire to the door with near ease in a fit of blood-pumping adrenaline, Jaslyn spoke after 5 seconds of silence and pushing,

"Is something in the bathroom?" She said, concerningly?

"What? What are you*—"*

I looked over and saw that my wife was on her iPad, our Roku streaming season 4 of *Scandal* on Netflix to our TV. I just surveyed the room, still in the biggest adrenaline rush I've ever had. Checking my phone, I saw that it read 10:30 PM. I had a cathartic release, breaking down crying as the reality of the situation quickly flooded my brain.

***

After about 30 minutes of trying to give a garbled recollection of what just happened in the stairwell, I finally calmed my nerves and explained in detail. I think it goes without saying that my wife was horrified by my recount.

"Well. The way it looked to me, you had your arm around me while we were watching TV and you said you were 'going to use the bathroom real quick.'"

"That doesn't make *any* sense. I was passed out the second I hit the pillow."

"What? Not at all. You said you were wide awake from that nap you took earlier."

"No, I was exhaus...*—*I don't*..."* I stumbled with my words, trying to comprehend 2 different realities at once. It wasn't like a nightmare where I "woke up" at 3:30 AM in my dream after settling into bed. No, I was fully conscious at 10 PM, walking into my bedroom when this had occurred. My question at that moment was, which of our realities was the *true* reality?

***

I know this is getting a little confusing, but trust me, it's more confusing for me. I can't decide whether or not my perspective or Jaslyn's perspective was the correct one, and not a misconstrued memory caused by what I'm *really* starting to doubt as mold or God, I keep saying this, fucking CO. People always say, "My dream felt so real, it couldn't have been a dream." Well, when I say this was no nightmare, and I was fully conscious, I mean it.

Writing this, I can hear myself sounding like a deranged madman trying to explain the voices in his head.

***

The HVAC guy came in the morning at 6:30 just as I was getting ready to leave for work. Tall, stocky dude with a beard that I envied. He asked questions while looking in the corners of our ceiling in search of signs of mold developing.

"You seeing shit?" He asked bluntly.

"I guess you could say that, just small bouts of amnesia, I guess," I said, lessening the severity, not trying to drive the man out of my home, convincing him I was a lunatic. He asked if my wife was suffering from the same symptoms, and I rubbed my eyes while muttering, "Yeah." He could see the tiredness in my eyes and could tell it was rougher than I was making it out to be*.* He didn't push.

"Carl." The technician said while extending his hand.

I reciprocated, saying my name as well. We talked about the playoffs and discussed whether Drake Maye was going to take New England to the Super Bowl. He was a Broncos fan (who's the real lunatic now).

"You got a basement?"

I exhaled pensively as I told him to follow me to the kitchen. I pointed him to the door that led to the dreadful underbelly of our home. Just as Carl was about to approach the door, he stopped in his tracks and snapped his finger, doing a 180 spin to face me. He said,

"Ah, shit, right. I forgot. You told me last night on the phone not to go down into the basement."

As I grabbed my computer bag and thermos, halfway pushing the side door of the house, I stopped and turned around and said,

"What are you talking about? I never called you."

He made a look.

"You messing with me 'cause I'm a fan of the Orange Rush?"

I didn't respond; I just stood there and furrowed my brow.

He took off his white hard hat, ran his hand through his hair, tilted his head, and said,

"Well, you told me last night, quite late, I will add, that it was going through some remodeling and that you stripped all the walls previously and that there was no mold to be found. Also said there was a CO detector already mounted down there."

"Huh, maybe I'm forgetting more than I think. Hey, I know this is a weird question, but could you, uhm, check your recently called list real quick? Just want to make sure, for sanity's sake." I said, trying to seem relatively unbothered.

He nodded his head and began searching in silence. My palms were sweating, and I was clenching my jaw, waiting for him to just hurry the fuck up. He stopped scrolling and stared at his phone.

"Hmph." Carl loudly huffed while scratching his neck. "Can't find it. Probably deleted it by accident. Or maybe your doppelgänger got on the phone!" He laughed.

I stared.

The technician awkwardly cleared his throat and said, "Well! I suppose you're fine with me going down there, renovations and all?" I was so distracted by my own thoughts that I just muttered, "Yeah, whatever." While pushing the rest of the door open and walking out.

***

On my drive to work, I kept going over it in my head. Maybe it was just a symptom, but that doesn't make sense because my phone number disappeared from his logs entirely and he hadn't ever stepped foot in my house until today, eliminating the possibility he was somehow hallucinating as well. He also said I called him last night, way before he came in contact with the house. I kept trying to reason that he was just drunk and that maybe he *thought* I called him. I thought that maybe this would pass after the cause of our issues was removed from our home, and my life would go back to normal. After my morning lecture, while I was in my office, the HVAC technician called my cell during my student visit office hours, and after jokingly telling me I did a really shit job of remodeling since it just looked like an average dank basement with pink fiberglass. I replied,

"Yeah, haha, whatever. Why are you calling? Did you find something?"

What he said next was something I was expecting but didn't want to accept yet.

"Well, my reader didn't detect any CO. And I couldn't find any mold. Good news, right?" He asked.

"Oh yeah, totally." *Fuck.*

"You want me to check for termites? Free of charge!"

"No, that's alright. Thank you for your services, Carl." Before hanging up the phone.

***

As of writing this, I'm still sitting in my office. Everyone else has gone home, and Jaslyn is on her way back from work. To be quite frank with you, I'm terrified of returning to the home I had before seen as a place of refuge. If anyone can explain what might be happening, whether it involves a spirit seeking release from this corporeal realm or a demon attempting to possess my wife or me. I'd really appreciate it. I'll make sure to try to keep updating as events progress.

***

Another thought that's been lingering in my head for the past half hour or so that bothers me the more I think about it is something that Carl said to me.

*"Or maybe your doppelgänger got on the phone!"*

This disturbs me for 2 reasons. The first reason is that Jaslyn had apparently spoken to me on the phone the second day, when things were starting to get weird. Knowing now that it wasn't a chemical-induced hallucination, the real question is, was the thing that spoke to me in the middle of the night the same thing that spoke to my wife, trying to turn her against me? And the other reason,

Why did it not want Carl to go into the basement?
