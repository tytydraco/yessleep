"See? I told you it was a bad idea. Move your hands, let me see it."

"Yeah, you were right. Ah- I stand corrected. It's fine, Alice, I just landed wrong. It didn't split."

Alice inspected the still unhealed wound on Ethan's arm that he had just landed on. The woman had a motherly instinct that would rival even Jan. In an attempt to jump to the wall of junk that blocked the top of the enclosure, Ethan had just slipped and tried to catch himself on his bare forearm. The sound of his pained grunt would undoubtedly be enough to summon the Curator back down.

"Even if you got up there, Joel's arm is still too hurt to help him up quickly, and we'd have to push some of that furniture down. The curator would hear that for certain. It'd be back down before we even got three rooms away."

"How does it always know?" Ethan questioned. "That thing had the object permeance of a toddler above, but now that we're in here, it knows every time we sneeze."

Alice shrugged. "I don't know for sure. Me and my friends thought that maybe this was its original room. Maybe it has some sort of special connection with it."

"Creatures can leave their rooms?"

"None of the ones that we saw could, but It can, and it has to be one of the creatures, wouldn't you think?"

Suddenly, we heard a violent banging and rattling from a door outside our exhibit. Right on cue. The Curator slinked into the room and scurried over to the glass, cocking its head and investigating us. Ethan and Alice were already to their feet before it had even entered and were acting completely inconspicuous. After a moment, the beast played a few notes on its throat and then exited back out of the room and up the chute it had come down.

"Man. If only we had found that elevator sooner. We could have gotten to the bottom of the house in a day." I groaned.

"Come on, let's keep thinking," Ethan said, scanning the scaffolding of the ceiling.

He was right; we desperately needed to develop a solution to get out of here. Since our first night, we had already been trapped here for another full day. If Bea was immortal in her room, she had most likely spent that time in horrible agony. If not… Well then, time was running out. The longest I had ever heard of someone who had been impaled living was a couple of days, and that was only if it hit the right places. Then there was always the option that we were wrong about the room theory altogether…

I pushed the thought out of my head and tried to focus. All of our attempts so far had been less than fruitless: standing on each other's shoulders to reach the open part of the wall, trying to pick the lock on the service door in the back with a paper clip, and now, trying to scale our way over the barricade the thing from downstairs had created. It must have been on high alert now that it had new pets because the thing barely left the room. When it did, it was only for a couple hours at a time, and if we ever made a noise too loud or concerning, it somehow knew to come back. That meant whatever we did had to be quick and quiet to give us enough of a head start.

"Maybe we can tear up some of this fake foliage and make a rope? We could find a way to hook it onto that bar up there and climb over?"

"Yeah," Alice muttered with false confidence. "That could work." We could both tell that the harder we tried to escape, the more discouraged she got.

Ethan sighed and dropped his head, "I'm sorry, Alice. I know we just crashed into your world and that there's a lot at risk with us doing this, but we really need to get out of here. Our friend needs us."

"No, no, I understand. And I'm so happy to see actual, human faces again, but it's just… Andi was the only one I've seen make it out of here, and even that was a close call. Everyone else, they... And I just can't see that happen to more people… I've been alone with the memories for so long, and if any more are added to that pile, I don't know if I can handle it." She stepped over to the glass and looked at the 'BAD PETS' cage. "I've seen two people I cared about disappear into that room, and that was the last time I ever saw them. I could hear them, though, and I wish I couldn't have…." Alice slowly reached up and brushed her fingers over her earrings.

I thought for a moment before speaking. This poor woman had suffered so much more than us, and our suffering alone had felt like hell. "This time, we'll get it." She turned to me, "We will, Alice. I can't imagine how much you've lost… We've lost people too. And all of them believed that we could find a way out of this place. And I believe them. We're going to get out of here, and we're getting you out with us, Alice. You don't deserve to be alone in here with your memories anymore."

She looked at me with uncertainty, but part of her seemed to find at least some comfort in what I said.

"Okay." She replied quietly. "Just- please, we need to be careful."

"Absolutely."

"Is there any other way you can think of to get out of here?" Ethan asked, "In all of your time here, you had to have come up with at least a few ideas."

Alice shook her head, "The more people I lost, the harder it became to think of a way out. Once I was alone, I eventually gave up. I haven't really thought about it in a long time."

Ethan looked down, "Dang it. We've come so far… This can't be it." he muttered under his breath as he kicked a loose stone on the ground. It skittered across the floor until it came to an abrupt halt against the savannah painted wall with a *Thump*!

Suddenly, like a gunshot in my head, the scene sparked a significant detail I had glossed over in all of the panic. When we were upstairs making noise to draw in the creature, Ethan had thrown a stool across the room. A stool that put a hole in the wall of the indestructible house.

Alice and Ethan continued to discuss possible escape routes while I took a few steps away from them to think. How had that been possible? Like most things with the house, I wanted to either pin it as a strange anomaly or assume that I had simply imagined the hole. But this time, I knew with certainty that wasn't the case. I knew what I had seen, and the stool leg had gone straight through the drywall.

I began to review all of the times I had ever seen a part of the house break, and the list was quickly finished. The only other instance had been when the catwalk had collapsed back at the playhouse, which with the knowledge I had now, was most likely attributed to the house itself. The way it had bent the other catwalk to trap Ethan and stab Bea meant that it could have easily tried that in a discrete attempt to kill us. However, the more I thought about that theory, the more plot holes I found in it. The House wanted us to end up in our rooms, not completely die, and if it had been the one that trapped us with the birds, it was playing an awfully risky game. That meant it had to have been an accident that the walk broke.

On top of that, the catwalk had actually shattered, seemingly organically, not just shifted into a new shape. Whatever had happened seemed way different from the void catwalk. When Ethan had been trapped by the railing and had to bend it to get out, it had seemed like-

'Oh my gosh.' I thought, my pacing coming to a dead halt. 'Ethan... Ethan bent the bars…'

Instantly, my mind was ablaze with a million realizations, a cascade of loose ends twisting together to form a rope that I grabbed tightly and followed. Ethan had thrown the stool and bent the bars. He was standing on the first catwalk with us when it fell, and suddenly the thing that the House had said suddenly made eerie sense.

"*Well, almost always indestructible. Isn't that right, Ethan?*"

It could have directed that question at any one of us, even all of us, but it had explicitly chosen Ethan, the one person who had never even seen it before. Why? And why had Ethan never seen the creature that had been tormenting all of us? I thought back to what Daniel had said about his wife being the one who let the fetuses into his house, so it seemed like he, too, had been having visits from the creature . So why was Ethan not? What was different about him than the rest of us?

A shiver rand down my spine as the last piece of the puzzle slid into place. A fact that had been insignificant to me in all of the emotion and pain of seeing Mark's final moments. It was what he had said when he was explaining his theory of the house to me. According to him, everyone had admitted doing something terrible in their life.

Everyone except for Ethan

Ethan didn't withhold his confession because he was embarrassed; he wasn't that kind of person. He withheld it because he didn't have anything to confess at all.

"Oh my gosh…." I exclaimed out loud. Alice and the subject in question both turned to me.

"What? What is it? Is everything alright, Joel?" Alice asked.

"Ethan." I started, "I think you can break the house."

Alice glanced to him, expecting to glean understanding from his expression, but he looked just as confused as she did.

"I'm sorry?" He questioned.

"I said that I think that you can break the house." I turned to the service door in the back. It had a cheap nickel handle. One that could easily be detached. "And if that theory is correct, then I think we've got our way out of here."

&#x200B;

Grace sat alone in the sunroom; in front of her, a long piece of paper was sprawled out. It was one of the finer pieces we had. Next to her, she had broken into our paint supplies as well. I approached from behind and knelt down next to her.

"Watcha' up to, old lady?" I asked, looking down at the canvas before her.

She smirked, "Just painting, you little brat. Figured we could use some new decoration around here."

"Wow, that's really good so far. I didn't realize you were a painter."

She laughed to herself, "I'm not. I dreamed of being one when I was a kid, but it became more of a hobby as I grew up."

"Well, once we get out of here, you should give that dream another go," I said, admiring her handy work. I stared down at the masterful illustration of four scarlet birds perched on a branch. "What kind of bird is that?"

"They're cardinals. You've never seen them before?"

"I'm sure I probably have; I just forgot. Though, that seems like it would be hard to do." The bright red plumes of the animal stuck out like a beacon against the white parchment.

"Oh, you should always keep an eye out for them, my dear. It's a blessing when one visits."

"How so?"

"Well, they're known for often visiting windows and tapping on them. When I was young, my mother always told me that when you see a cardinal on your sill or perched nearby, it's a loved one you've lost coming to visit from heaven. For me, they were my father."

I smiled, "That's really nice."

She pointed to one on the far right of the branch. "That one's Andi."

I sat with Grace in silence for a bit before a question burned its way to the tip of my tongue.

"What do you think it feels like to die?"

She didn't look up from the sheet, just pursed her lips and tilted her head in my direction, "Well, that's a heavy question, Joel."

"Sorry. I guess it's just something that's been on my mind lately."

"I suppose I can't blame you for that." She said solemnly. "I can't say it's something I've thought about too much. The after-death part; that's the one that comes up most often. But what it would be like going through it… Let me think about that one, Joel." Grace dipped her brush in a cup, letting a bit of black paint murk up the water, then re-plastered it in crimson and began to dash a fifth bird.

&#x200B;

Alice, Ethan, and I all sat in a different part of the enclosure, exchanging glances between each other while the curator hastily unstitched its skin and dumped out the contents beneath. It was nearly finished. My heart violently assaulted my chest, and my foot tapped rapidly with anticipation. We were so close. This was going to be the one, and we all knew it. The monster loosed an old metal desk fan that crashed down into the pile, then flicked off the radio. It turned back to us, played a few notes, then darted off into the darkness of the doorway.

'one… two… three…'

Without a word, the three of us were on our feet and at the door at the back of the enclosure. Ethan pulled the rusted screw from his pocket and began witling away at the plate that the doorknob rested on. It was rattling now from how loose it had gotten. Pieces of sealing rubber and glue flaked to the ground to the scratching rhythm while Alice and I intently listened for the Curator's possible return. I couldn't believe it was actually working.

"Wow… That's a lot to take in." Ethan had said after I told him, "So you're saying I've had all this power this whole time and never even knew?"

"Why would you have? As far as everyone else goes, the house is indestructible. After seeing it firsthand, you never had any reason to test it yourself."

As we talked, I noticed Alice was pondering the concept deeply, "I think Joel may be right. There was someone in my group before, a friend of mine. She kicked a locked door open once in a burst of adrenaline. We never figured out how, but if your reasoning tracks, then maybe she didn't belong here either."

That last part took me back, "Didn't belong here? What do you mean?"

"Well, isn't that what you're saying? If we've all done bad things, but Ethan hasn't and can break the house, it would stand to reason that he wasn't supposed to be here in the first place. The house doesn't know how to contain someone like him."

"Um, no, that's not quite what I was saying, but that actually is an excellent point, Alice."

"Hold on," Ethan cut in, "Now you guys are getting ahead of yourselves. I mean, I'm no saint. Of course, I've done bad things."

"How bad is bad?" Alice asked.

"Like, trapped in an endless rotting prison of demons bad?"

"I don't know. I mean, I bullied this one kid back in high school. That was pretty bad."

"Oh. Well, that may be pretty awful," Alice said shyly, "but I think you could chalk that up to young naivety. That's clearly not who you are anymore."

"Maybe not, but I just don't think I'm that special, guys…."

I bent over and picked up a jagged pebble from the ground, "There's only one way to find out." I said, walking over to the wall. I dug the rock into the surface and scraped it down as hard as I could. Not a single fleck of paint even came off. I turned to Ethan, then held the stone out in my hand. He rolled his eyes and took it, then crossed to the mural. Alice and I watched from behind as he dragged the point across. He paused for a moment, holding the rock in place as he stared.

"Well?" I asked.

He glanced over his shoulder to me, then slowly took a step back. Where the flawless African savannah once was depicted, now was marred by a large, grey slash revealing the brick underneath.

*Chunk!*

We all collectively gasped as the panel came popping away from the door, exposing the mechanisms of the handle within. Like statues, we waited and listened to see if the Curator had heard it. After a couple of minutes, we resumed the operation. Ethan pulled the plate back and reached the screw inside, jamming it into part of the lock and trying to dislodge it. No luck. Instead, he attempted to fidget with the screws holding it in place, but to no avail. Looking down, I grabbed one of the thin metal buttons from my flannel and pulled hard, snapping the thread. I then handed it to him. We held our breaths as he tried to fit it in the slot. After watching his hand twist a few times, he turned around with a smile and opened his palm. There were now two screws and a button.

As Ethan continued, I glanced at Alice. I could see so many emotions in her eyes. Fear, anxiety, relief, excitement. After her shock had worn off, she slowly stood and made her way to her cave. I heard her rummaging through her belongings before she returned, wearing a coat with a few pockets full of various items. One of which looked like a stuffed animal. She looked at me as she approached with questioning eyes, asking, 'is this it?'

I nodded, then stood from my crouch as well. The next few seconds of watching Ethan felt like forever until finally, we saw the handle begin to sag and then fully come off. Ethan caught the thing before slowly setting it down. Then, cautiously, he pushed on the door. It swung open with a slight creak, revealing a dark hallway behind.

We all allowed ourselves one last second of 'oh my gosh, this actually worked' before confirming glances and quickly stepping into the hall.

I looked both ways, conducting a mental map in my mind. To one side, the hall led into darkness, most likely a way back into the labyrinth of rooms. To the right, two doors lay open, light shining through both. From where they were, I knew one led into the spectator room, and the other further down was most likely the service door into the '*BAD PETS*' room. I silently started toward the first entrance. This was unsurprising to Ethan and Alice, as we had already made a vague plan of what we would do before starting our escape. We needed to get our belongings back from the curator if possible because we had no food otherwise, and according to Alice, even if we managed to get away, this floor was large and lacked any sources of nourishment.

We entered into the junk room, and the smell hit us hard. Rotting food and mildewed fabric dominated the air, accompanying the scenery of hoarded garbage. Even though the enclosure wall hadn't gone all the way to the ceiling, it must have been enough to spare us from the pungent odor. I held my breath and stepped carefully as I crossed to the center of the area, making sure to not knock anything over. One slip and a whole pile could come down. I made my way over to the rise of junk where I had seen our bags and peered in. Tucked below a bike tire were mine and Ethan's backpacks. I turned to my friend and gestured him over, then lifted the tire slowly, carefully balancing the weight that it was supporting. As I did, Ethan gently slid the bags out from the heap. He handed me my pack, and I unzipped the top pouch, ensuring that everything was still inside. I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw that nothing had been removed.

We wasted no time turning to leave, grabbing any visible food that looked still edible from the tops of piles as we went. I also spotted a flashlight that I plucked out to replace the broken one, although the light was spotty from the old batteries inside. I had been trying to avoid breathing as much as possible to avoid the putrid scent, but when I finally couldn't deal with the minimal amount of air any longer, I took a gasp in.

As I did, I caught a new smell in the air, worse than any of the others. The sharp, raunchy smell of rotting meat. I stifled a coughed at how bad it was, and my eyes were immediately drawn to the source. I was standing right next to the bad pet's cage wall. I hurried back to the hall, following Alice and Ethan, but the aroma trailed with me. I rounded the corner and looked to Ethan to see if he had smelled it too, but something else occupied his attention.

Alice was currently a few steps further down the hall, staring through the doorway of the second exhibit, a hand covering her mouth in horror.

Ethan and I quickly stepped to her, hoping to tear her away from the sight before she took in too much. We didn't know exactly what was in that cage, but we didn't have to. All of the evidence made it clear that it was not good. If only we had known how bad it was, we could have spared our own eyes.

Skin. Not just patches like on the curator. Sheets of skin. Full, humanoid sheets. They were stretched taught and strung up around the room in varying places, dry and smooth from the heat lamps above cooking them so long. The smell from the doorway was even worse than in the junk room, seeping into my skull whether I breathed or not, choking every bit of air from me. The source was obvious as I looked to the back corner of the room.

A thick cloud of black flies swarmed over a dip in the ground where an artificial pond once was. Hungrily, they swooped down to rest on the piles of brownish-red awful that the curator had disposed of neatly in the basin. I heard Ethan wretch next to me, and I had to turn away to avoid doing the same. All the while, Alice just stared with eyes full of tears, unable to move or speak. For us, this was nothing but another horrific sight, but to her, those were her friends…

I swallowed the saliva in my throat that was preparing the way for vomit and stood up, grabbing her free wrist and tugging.

"Alice," I whispered, "We need to go."

I could barely see her shake her head as she held the same position.

"Alice, I'm so sorry, but we need to move. We want to be as far away as possible before it comes back."

"I can't…" I heard her mutter, "I can't…."

"Hey, look here. Alice, look at me." I gave her arm one more pull, and it was enough to get her looking into my eyes. "I can't even begin to imagine what you're going through, but we can't stay here. *You* can't stay here. You've been through too much. Let's go, okay? Far away from this place."

She went to look back into the room again, but I squeezed her wrist hard, snapping her from its draw. looking down at the floor, she nodded as she wiped her eyes.

"Okay…" I said with a shaky breath. "Let's move."

Through the dark hallway, we began sprinting, the floor of the zoo eventually giving way to the ever-familiar moldy tan carpet. The rooms we passed through looked similar to what we were used to, but after seeing a few, I quickly noticed a few things off about them. The first was that they had no doors, just open doorways connecting one area to the other. The second was that all of the walls were the same. As a matter of fact, all of the interiors seemed the same. Above, the rooms varied in style and location, as if they were different places stitched together at random. However, it seemed that everything was just one location on this floor: white walls with tan carpet. The third thing was that they were devoid of any furniture or decoration, for the most part at least. Occasionally, we would pass a room with a lone painting on the wall or a space with a single nightstand in the corner. The whole setting was much more unsettling than any of the areas above. It was human, at least it appeared to be that way. Man-made. Yet it didn't make logical sense for a place like this to exist, and it clearly couldn't be inhabited by any living person.

"It's like this part isn't finished yet," Ethan muttered next to me at one point.

As we moved through the rooms, Alice did her best to guide us based on the patterns of the space she remembered from before. We still occasionally hit dead ends like she had mentioned; however, according to her, she was doing better than last time. Meanwhile, Ethan would sometimes use a pen from his bag to mark the doorways as we passed through them just in case we got turned around. Once the pen ran out of ink, he used the tip to etch a mark into the frame. Seeing him smile at his newfound power brought me temporary joy every time.

Wanting to contribute, I kept track of our direction the best I could to ensure that we weren't heading back toward the enclosures. I had gained a lot of experience logging movements in my head from when I was making the maps above. Part of me was worried that the rooms might still be shifting on this floor, but like I said, it seemed different from the rest, and the matter didn't seem of high priority. At least at the moment.

We moved through the floor for hours, maybe even a whole day in complete silence, although I had become numb to this routine this far down into the house. Our bodies, however, still hadn't. This rang especially true for Alice, who hadn't been able to freely move beyond a single room for over six years. At least basket runs at the house allowed us brief physical activity. We tried to put it off for as long as possible, but eventually, we all knew that if we pushed any further without rest, we would be caught with our guard down when danger inevitably came. There had to be enough distance between the Curator for a head start by now.

We found a room that seemed to offer decent escape routes should the need arise to run, then slumped up against the wall. We opened a package of crackers and split them among the three of us, then began eating with our ears on alert.

"Do you think anyone has ever actually made it out of this place?" Alice whispered softly.

Ethan and I turned to her. She looked shaken and tired, and it dawned on me that we hadn't truly given her any time to grieve over the fate of her friends.

"I'm sure somebody has. Neither of our groups were the first here, clearly. Your two friends, you said you thought they could have made it, right?" I replied.

She smiled, "I just like to imagine that they did."

"I'm sure they did." Ethan jumped in, "Your group seemed way better at this than us, and look how far *we've* come. They had to have made it."

"Thanks, Ethan." Alice chuckled, amused. I could tell she was still troubled, however. I tried to spin things more positively.

"So, what are you guys going to do? You know, when we get out of here, and things have settled down?"

"Oh, man… Ethan started. "I don't even know where to begin. Probably see my parents. I'm sure they're worried sick about me. That is, if they don't think I'm already dead. After that, I'm not sure. Maybe be a celebrity? I'll bet, 'kid who escaped nightmare dimension' will have some marketability."

I laughed, "Good idea. Although, you know the plan for when people ask where we were."

"Fair enough. It would make for a good screenplay, though. Maybe even a book. I always did want to be a writer."

"Really? I never knew that about you."

Ethan shrugged, "It never came up."

"The plan?" Alice asked. "What's the plan?"

"Well, we figured once we got out of here, people would have a lot of questions for us, and telling them we were trapped in another world would probably get us locked up in an insane asylum or quarantined in a government facility," Ethan explained. "So, we came up with a story of how our bus was hijacked on the road, and we were kidnapped. Traded around in an underground trafficking market for years until we escaped."

"That's a pretty good idea."

"Hopefully, it will be. It may not align with the evidence of what's going on outside, and who knows where we'll end up once we escape, but it's better than nothing."

"What about you, Alice?" I asked. "Any plans for your freedom?"

"Oh goodness, probably the same as Ethan. Go and see my family. I had a younger brother who was only five when I arrived here. It's sobering to think he'll be graduating high school by the time I get out. After that, I'm not too sure. Probably finish my medical degree if I can. I always wanted to start a family as well, although now I suppose I'm too late for both of those things."

"What are you talking about? You can't be that old. You look thirty at most."

"I'm thirty-three."

"Oh, pfft." Ethan scoffed, "That's not too late at all, Alice. My mom had me when she was thirty-six. Plus, you can go back to school anytime. I doubt there's an age cut off."

"Yeah, Ethan's right. You still have so much time once you're out of here."

The woman nervously brushed her hair from her face and smiled, "Well, thank you two. That's reassuring to hear that you think that."

"It's not fair that this place robbed you of so many years. You deserve to have your life still."

"God, I bet the world has changed so much since I left. Over a decade…"

"Well, if you got taken here somewhere between thirteen and twelve years, that would have made it-"

Ethan cut me off without a word by raising a hand directly in front of Alice and I's faces. I turned to him and saw he was looking off into one of the dark corridors to our left. Instant panic washed over me. I studied the ambiance closely, trying to pick up on what he heard: a thumping from a few halls down. Footsteps. Inhuman, yet rhythmic.

I scrambled for the flashlight and clicked it off, drenching us in complete darkness. I felt Ethan grab my hand, and I immediately reached out and grabbed Alice's. If we were going to be moving through a dark labyrinth quickly, the last thing we wanted was to become separated. As the footsteps continued, I felt Alice begin to lead us in the opposite direction, the sound of her hand brushing against the wall as she went. We rounded the corner into the next area when the footsteps became a new sound.

Talking. Whatever was behind us began to speak. It spoke in a female voice that was calm and normal, yet it talked rapidly and fast, with words falling out to no fluctuation.

"Dripping filthy water they tie me down and it worms back up in droves of dozens of bereft places that only eyes shut can see over and over they call but no one picks up so together they drift through bleeding windows and back into the places they bury so deep."

Suddenly, the voice went silent and was replaced by the sound of music. A distorted old song that sped up and slowed at random. The talented voice of the singer became a haunting wail as it was stretched and pulled. Then, it harshly cut out all at once, and a new voice began to ramble, this time a man's.

"Melting flowers smell so sickly sweet the pigs come, oh how they come and consume when the mouths fill the sky with their steely grins meat and flesh skin and bone all falls to-"

Another different song began blaring, cutting the voice short, although this one played backward, sending jagged gasps of incorrect language into the halls around us. All combined, it sounded like a corrupted recording, with several speeches and songs recorded over one another, constantly fighting for attention.

I never noticed how bad my hands trembled until I held two other shaking ones as we snuck through the darkness. Whatever this thing was, it radiated pure, utter horror.

We made it a few rooms away from the thing in the dark, but the footsteps continued to trail toward us alongside the twisting voices. The more they rambled on, the more their madness made my chest tighten. This creature was wrong, and I meant that in the most literal sense. Of everything known in the universe, the being defied it with only its voice. I tried hard to push back the incomprehensible images that wormed their way into my head of what it might look like, but the effort caused me to slightly stumble over my own feet. I tried to steady myself against Alice and Ethan but noticed that their grips also buckled as I leaned against them. The madness wasn't just in my head; it was effecting us all. We needed to get farther away and fast.

I released my friend's hands and whipped out the flashlight, clicking it on and praying that we were far enough away to hide the gleam. As the light illuminated the path ahead, Alice and Ethan took the cue, and together, we all began to pick up our pace, weaving silently through the doorways. Instant relief came over me the further we got, like pressure releasing as you swim toward the top of a deep pool. However, it all came back the second the distant music broke again, and the thing talked.

"Your rooms are looking for- Your rooms are looking for- nothing I just want to go home it's somewhere beneath us way way down but there were so many and I couldn't- but we're safe here."

A jumbled mixture of sentences, all from different people but sharing one single thread.

They were all things that had been said to us.

That's when we gave up the silence. Ethan and I began dead sprinting, and while Alice didn't entirely understand why she didn't waste a second joining in. Neither did the thing in the dark behind us. The noise from its strides sounded almost like a horse galloping, heavy and rhythmic. I had been forced to run for my life many times in our journey throughout the house; we all had. But at that moment, I had never pushed myself harder. The rooms became nothing but a white blur around us as the flashlight strobed from my arms pumping. I felt my legs begin to go numb from the muscles within reaching their limit, and just when I thought things couldn't get worse, the flickering beam in my hand caught the outline of something pale a few doorways away. I noticed the gaze of its perfect round eyes for only a moment, but that was all I needed to see to know who they belonged to.

Ethan saw the Curator ahead too and quickly dodged into a corridor to our left, grabbing my sleeve and pulling me as he did. I caught Alice and followed suit, and together we continued on in a new direction. A flurry of wild notes and screeches contrasted the organized madness of the thing behind us. The Curator had joined the chase. However, after a few more strides forward, a structure rattling thud echoed out behind as I could only assume the two creatures clashed.

The unknown being suddenly ceased its recounting of our memories and changed its frequency. Screams echoed out; loud, bloodcurdling screams. The kind you would only hear from someone experiencing unfathomable terror or pain. Guttural and strained, they filled my ears and stood my hair straight on its end. I remember the only conclusion I could come to at that moment was that the being was either terribly injured, or it was reading the Curator's thoughts...

We seized the opportunity to gain more distance, praying that we didn't run into a dead end. The scuffle behind us had bought some time, but once we heard the commotion stop followed by steps resuming, it was clear that the desire to catch us overturned their need to kill one another. They were once again gaining on us and fast.

"This way!" Alice cried over her gasps as she ducked right.

We followed with no hesitation and began weaving through more corridors. However, Alice stopped once we had made it a few rooms in.

"Joel, the flashlight!"

I handed it to her without question in the heat of the moment, assuming she had a plan. Had I known what it was, I would have thought twice.

"Good luck." She said with a shaky breath before shoving Ethan and me hard with each hand.

We fell into the darkness of the room next to us, and in the minimal light that bounced back onto her face, I could see hopelessness in Alice's eyes.

"Come on! Over here!" She screamed as she took off running in the opposite direction. I continued to hear her call as her voice got further and further away. Finally, the momentary shock wore off, and I realized what was happening.

Alice was sacrificing herself for us; two complete strangers she had only known a couple days. I tried to comprehend why, but then quickly realized that the beasts cornering us weren't far behind, and if I didn't get my ass up right now, it was all going to be in vein...
