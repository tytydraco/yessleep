I work in a blue collar factory with mostly  politically conservative employees. There are some who are more liberal, but it’s far few and between. I’m not here to discuss politics, I’m just here to tell you what I witnessed.

I don’t know why he thought it was a good idea. Someone would always go in the bathroom stalls with a sharpie and write “Let’s Go Brandon” or “FJB.” It still would get put up as time went on whenever a custodian would be able to scrub it off after multiple attempts .

I never knew why they kept doing it. People are to use the bathroom, not deal with politics. I couldn’t understand why it kept happening in a factory full of adults.

Management had multiple talks about why we shouldn’t put graffiti on restroom stalls or talk politics in the workplace. We all signed papers saying if we were caught, we’d be wrote up and could be terminated. It still happened.

There really isn’t much that could happen, they weren’t going to hire a bathroom attendant to check a stall after people got out, and they sure weren’t going to put cameras up, that would be a big lawsuit.

Today they made us sign a paper once again that said we wouldn’t do it, and if caught they would do what they have to. It was weird though because we also had to sign where it said our family would lose the right to sue the company.

“Sorry guys, one bad apple spoils the bunch. As long as you don’t draw on the stall walls, you’ll be alright. We’re tired of this happening. Refusal to sign will be automatic termination.”

We all signed it anyway. It’s only one guy doing it to my knowledge. I went about my normal work day until the coffee kicked in the worst way.

I ran into the bathroom and surprisingly all the stalls were available. I sat down and was doing my business. I heard another guy coming in and closing the stall next to me.

I heard him grunting along the lines of “this is bullshit, they can’t prevent this.” 

I peeked under the stall and noticed he was standing with his feet towards me. I heard a cap get pulled off. 

Whatever he was writing was a lot. I heard him giggling.

I sat quietly for a moment. Then I heard the toilet in his stall hissing. A large splash happened and I heard him let out a yell.

“WHAT THE HELL”

He began screaming and his body was bumping into the stalls and shaking. 

“Someone help me! Please.” He started screaming loudly. I heard a bunch of crunching noises.

I got out of the stall and tried to kick house door down but wasn’t having much luck. I jumped up to see if I can crawl over.

All I see was head in the toilet and he was looking up at me. Blood spewed out of his mouth. A red claw reached out from the water and drug it under too. The toilet water was filled with blood, ooze and god knows what else. Then it flushed. 

I knew who the guy was, it was Mikie. He had a fiancé and was a decent guy. I couldn’t believe it.

I went to go tell my boss what happened. He didn’t seem fazed. I kept asking him if he was going to do anything about it. He just held up the paper we all signed.

“You get paid to work, not ask questions. Get back to work.”
