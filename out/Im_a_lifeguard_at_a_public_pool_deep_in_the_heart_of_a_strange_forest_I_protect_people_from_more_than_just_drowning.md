Okay, here’s how you get there:

Take Highway 101 down past Beaver, until you see the hand painted sign that says “Charries.” Ignore the snaggle-toothed man in overalls standing next to it.  Do not, under any circumstances, buy anything he’s selling (they’re not cherries). Make a left on the road underneath the sign. If you can’t see it at first, that’s fine. It won’t look like a road until you’re on it.

Take that path till it turns to gravel, then hang the third left. Ignore your phone when it tells you to turn back (don’t bother putting it on mute, that never works). Stay on that track till it turns to dirt and make the fifth right. Be careful not to take the fourth right. The house at the end of that road is definitely owned by an axe murderer. Old shack in the middle of nowhere, ivy and spiderwebs all over the roof and eaves. They’ve been after him for years, there’s just never been enough evidence to convict.

For the rest of the way, keep your windows rolled up and ignore the voices that sound like your loved ones. Try not to look out the side windows too, or else you might see them peeking in at you. Don’t stop to give anyone a ride, no matter how much they ask.

Stay the course, ignore how thick the trees are becoming, and then you’ll be there.

Mirror Forest Pool.

You won’t miss it. I’m not talking about some hidden mountain lake. I’m talking pool. A paved parking, sunscreen saturated, public pool.

I’m Luke. Luke the Lifeguard. I work at the pool.

Technically, this public amenity where I am employed is part of the local National Park, but it’s not connected to any cabin system, hotel, or campground in the area. In fact, it’s miles away from any sort of humanity at all. If you saw it, you would think it looks like any other every-day, average, middle-class outdoor community pool (except for the fact it’s in the middle of the goddamn wilderness). Even though it’s outdoors, it’s open all year round. As a kid, my parents would take me in the winter as a treat. We were poor, and couldn’t afford much. At the pool, it could be snowing just outside the fence, but inside the property, it always felt like a toasty 80-degree day. At the time, I just thought they had real good space heaters.

The pool itself has three sections: a shallow end, a deep end, and a middle connector. Sometimes the shallow and deep ends switch places. We always take a few minutes to check which end is which when we open. That way, we can close the slide and diving board until they switch back. A lifeguard forgot to do that one time, and an old guy broke his neck when he dove off the diving board into a shallow foot of water. His wife tried to sue, but it was hard to explain to the judge the whole “deep to shallow” situation. I think she ended up dropping the case.

Two sides of the pool are surrounded by an L-shaped building. The other two sides are covered by a chain link fence. In the L-building are two locker rooms, a front desk, an office, and a boiler room that’s locked at all times. No one is allowed inside, even though that’s where the chemical works are. Rick, my coworker, thinks it’s because something lives in there. His money’s on the safety inspector. I don’t know about that. Last week I did see a set of eyes peeking out the ventilation slats at me. Might have been a trick of the light, but I swear it had glowing red pupils. Stan (our safety man) has eyes that are a nice hazel.

If the pH ever does get out of whack, we just run the hose until it hits a toasty 7 on our little tester vial. 

Outside of the pool, there’s a small playground outside for “dry fun.” At least, that’s what it says on the brochure. What the brochure doesn’t advertise is that if you go into the crawly tube between the structures, you’ll hear a little-kid voice ask: “Can you find me?” and then start counting down from thirty. Most people leave the park at that point, but one of my other coworkers, Vince, stayed until the end of the countdown. Wanted to do an “experiment.” 

The police found his body parts shoved into the hollow support tubes three days later. Never did find his head.

That happened about a month ago. The boss said construction crews were too expensive, so we just had to clean things out as best we could. The park was ready for action a week later. We did put caution tape up on the crawly tube though, just in case. And I’m happy to report, there haven’t been anymore incidents. Well, in the park at least.

You would think with all that weirdness going on we would be struggling to make ends meet, but we always seem to have steady business. We’re cheap, ain’t no way else to say it. We pass out a lot of “free swim” coupons at the Fred Meyers. I guess people are desperate for any kind of affordable pool, even ones in the middle of nowhere. 

This summer, we got the usual crowds: teenagers, stay-at-home moms, kids hyped up on their first snort of summer vacation.

We also got some less ordinary people as well.

There was this one guy. He would always show up Thursdays 12pm on the dot. He was real thin and kinda lanky. He had a huge smile and freaky wide eyes. He’d pay his $4.50 admission and go into the locker room. Ten minutes later, he’d be out on the pool deck. He’d circle the water’s edge two times. He’d go real slow, making eye contact with any patron that would look back.  Sometimes he waved at the kids. I don’t think I ever saw him blink. 

After his circling, he’d get in line for the diving board.

When it was his turn he’d jump once, twice, three times. He’d turn head over heels in the air and dive in with hardly a splash.

And then he'd never come back up.

For the rest of the day, he would just lay on the bottom of the pool, motionless.

First time I saw him like that, I freaked out. Almost jumped in and everything. But luckily Rick stopped me before I made a scene.

“He does that all the time,” he told me later in the break room. “He’ll be back next week.”

I wasn’t so sure. His body stayed at the bottom of the pool for the rest of the day. When we closed up the front desk and ran the pool covers, I could still see him, slowly drifting into the middle of the deep end. His eyes were open and he still had that big, toothy smile. It reminded me of a shark.

When I came to open the next morning, he had vanished. Next Thursday, he was back at the front desk again, ready to pay admission.

I don’t know what the patrons thought, but none of the regulars batted an eye at it. Occasionally you’d get a newcomer who’d nervously point out the body at the bottom of the pool, but we’d just stick to protocol: inform them everything’s fine and repeat rule 7 to them.

Rule 7: Do not talk or interact in any way with the Thursday Diver.

Believe it or not, Rule 7’s pretty important.

Just last week we had an olympic swimmer from out of state come in and see the Thursday Diver’s whole routine. Rick and I didn’t see what happened next, so the best we can guess is that Mr. Olympic thought Mr. Thursday needed a rescue and dove in.

What we do know for sure is that around 1pm we were pulling the olympic guy off the bottom of the pool. He’d drowned, go figure. 

While we were down there, we had to be careful not to brush up against the Thursday Diver. His hand was gripping the olympic swimmer's ankle. It was a bit of a tug of war to get him loose. When we finally got the foot away, the Thursday Diver didn’t do anything. He just kept peacefully drifting in the deep end, eyes still wide open and mouth still smiling.

Most pools get away with having one rules sign. Ours takes up two entire walls. It also has an asterisk at the end informing the public that if they want the full list, they’ll need to visit the front desk for the binder. I’m not sure why anyone would want to swim at such a strict pool, but I guess that’s why our admission is so cheap.

There’s lot of other weird rules in the binder, like making sure the locker rooms are locked from 4pm-5pm every Sunday to avoid “escapees,” and after every fifth person uses the slide, we need to send down a bag of sand.

I learned my lesson the hard way with that last one.

I was three weeks in, manning the slide, and the fifth kid had just gone down. I was getting the bag of sand ready, when the sixth kid pushed past me and raced up the steps. I tried to tell him to stop, but he just stuck his tongue out at me and threw himself into the entrance.

He never came out the other side.

There was a full investigation into his disappearance, but there weren’t any charges. There was no evidence we had kidnapped him or done anything else. After all, there was no body, no blood. It was like the kid had just ceased to exist.

I think they found him a month later in the desert. He survived. Barely. The article I read claimed he kept babbling about some cosmic highway where he was trapped for a thousand years. Apparently, his pupils and hair had also turned shock white. Not sure I believe the eye thing, it felt like the news people were just having fun with that whole situation.

Our rule binder is bursting at the seams because the boss loves making new rules. It’s basically half his job. He stays cooped up in his office, paying bills and coming up with pool guidelines. None of us ever see him leave his little room. He’s always the first there and the last to leave. We even have a special intercom that he uses to communicate with us. He never opens the door.

The pool could be burning, and I don’t think he’d even peek his head out to see where the smoke’s coming from.

Take the Fourth of July Incident for example.

We were in the middle of the holiday-weekend rush, and it was a doozy. The pool was packed to the gills with all sorts of people. Sunscreen was so thick in the air, opening your mouth would turn your tongue white. We were understaffed with only the four of us lifeguards, and it was a three guard rotation. I was barely keeping up with all the little kids throwing themselves into the deep end with the passion of suicide bombers.

I finally got my fifteen, and you better believe I hauled ass to the break room (think less a room and more a repurposed closet). I remember checking the time. 3:55 pm.

I turned on a fan (we don’t have AC in there) and stood in front of it for a hot second to relax. The clock ticked to 3:56 pm.

And everything went quiet.

Where there had been about ten thousand kids and adults screaming at the top of their lungs, there was immediate silence. I thought I had lost my hearing. I snapped my fingers a few times, and when my ears didn’t seem to be the problem, I went outside to see what was going on.

The pool was empty.

The lifeguards were standing around blinking like they weren’t sure what they were looking at. We combed the entire area over. The locker rooms, the park, even the cupboard under the front desk. Nothing. All our patrons had just vanished.

We mentioned this to our boss, and he said: “Probably went home for the fireworks.”

It was stupid hot that day, so maybe it was just a hallucination, but Rick swore he saw what happened. According to him, everything slowed down and got real still. Then, one by one, everyone jumped into the pool, and dunked their heads all at the same time. Then they just *dissolved,* layer by layer like they were in acid. Skin, muscle, organs, bones, then nothing.

I have my doubts about that story. Rick loves pulling legs, and none of the other guards saw what he did. What I will say is Rick had some dark circles under his eyes the entire next week. I don’t think the poor guy was sleeping.

Now don’t get me wrong. Mirror Forest Pool is not a terrible place. It’s an adequate pool as far as pools go. But on top of that, there's nostalgia here. It’s like all the essence of summer is infused into the air itself. Each breath feels like a step back in time. I just graduated high school, but working here, I feel like I’m back in elementary school, throwing all my papers and cheering as I hear the school bell ringing for the last time. It’s kinda addicting.

When you get here, you’ll understand what I mean.

You’ve got the directions, feel free to stop by. We’re open Mon-Sun, 8am-9pm. Tell the guy at the front desk that you know Luke, and he’ll give you a 50% discount on admission. Make sure you remember what I said about the overall guy with the “charries.” That’s important. And even if the voice of your own mother begs you for a ride on the road in, don’t open that door unless you want to see your face up on the missing person board at Walmart. We lost Claire that way.

As for me, I’ll keep you all posted on any new [rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/agoraphobic_archives/)
