There were four of us, Norman, Jason, Stuart and Me, Micheal. Norman was your typical gym rat, he was really muscular and tall. Jason was spoiled by his rich parents, he did drugs and enjoyed partying-hard. Then there was Stuart he had a traumatic childhood and rarely opened up to anyone. It was a fortnight into our summer vacations, when it started getting lousy. 

I was the one who suggested we go camping

“Yeah lets go it will be fun and anyways I have always wanted to try magic mushrooms, maybe we find a few?” said Jason, 

“Sure thing pal, I need a change of scenery anyways. What about you Stuart do you like the Forest” said Norman

“Yes, I like the Forest it is calm and peaceful.” Stuart answered.

We decided to drive to a local Forest in the morning to make the most of the day. Most of the day went towards finding a good spot and and setting up camp. We went to explore the forest in the evening, I went with Stuart and Jason with Norman. We came across that marked tree that night when we went deep into the woods. Stuart went to inspect the mark and then the moment he touched it he closed his eyes and fell to the ground. I went to check him and he was still alive, he was panting as if he had just run a marathon after a minute he opened his eyes again. 

“What happened?”

“I don’t know I think my blood sugar level dropped” 

I reached for my bag and gave him a granola bar, “Can you walk?” 

“Yes”.

We went back to our camp and started a fire. Stuart’s behavior was normal. After a few days we got bored and we went back.

 I did not see Stuart for a whole month after our trip.It was a week before our vacations ended, We were at Jason’s house that’s when I saw Stuart again. He came in through the back door.

“Whoa look who decided to show up” exclaimed Jason,

 “Where have you been” I asked. “I had to go back to my childhood home, to sell it and all of my parent’s possessions, My mother died recently you see” He replied. 

“Sorry for your loss” the three of us said in unison. 

“Don’t be she was a bitch also I got these to celebrate”  He said passing us three cans of ice-cold beer.

 I woke up tied in the dining room next to Jason and Norman who were still unconscious. 

“I see you finally woke up I almost though I gave you a bigger dosage than I meant to”. 

“What the fuck are you doing” I spat at him. 

“Do you remember when we went camping and we came across the mark?”

“Yes”

“Well you see Micheal it was no ordinary mark. When I touched it my soul was transported to the afterlife” 

“What the fuck are you talking about, Untie me” 

“I am afraid I can not, Micheal, I met the bridge-keeper of the afterlife” He said in an expressionless, cold voice “Now excuse me I must deal with Norman here. I watched him pick up Norman and lay him on the table and then he tied him down with a couple of belts. 

“You’re mad aren’t you?” I said in disbelief. 

“Oh no silly, I am not mad” He replied checking firmness of the belts

 He then came towards me and said “Its best if you say quiet for a bit” and stuck a strip of duct-tape on my mouth. I watched him take out a box-cuter and a small squeeze bottle from his bag. He squeezed the liquid in the bottle into Norman’s mouth in about half a minute Norman opened his eyes. He then put a strip of duct tape over his mouth and gripped the box-cutter tightly. “Let’s begin at the foot” He said in glee. I watched him slice Norman’s skin and peel it off. Norman’s screams of agony were muffled as his skin was flayed. By the time he reached the stomach Norman died. He unbuckled his body and tossed it on the floor. 

He walked towards me and said “I think you are wondering why I am doing this. Well Micheal you see the bridge keeper told me what happens in the afterlife, The keepers enjoy imprisoning and tormenting souls, they cant hurt them physically so they remind you of the worst moments of your life, you are trapped in them you cant escape” He looked fearful for the first time “I cant go through my childhood again, I cant watch my father hit my mother, her take out the frustration on me and my older brother and I cant watch my brother commit suicide again.” His eyes widened in malice “The bridge-keeper is kind, he told me the way to be the keeper rather than the prisoner. It is to inflict pain on fellow humans such that they can never recover from it. I hope you understand” 

He walked away to strap Jason this time. Once again the liquid was squeezed into Jason’s mouth but this time he withdrew a large bottle full of clear liquid from his bag. It was acid. He poured it on Jason’s legs then on his stomach and then finally on his chest. 

*Two down one to go.*

 I tried with all my might to break free but I could not he forced a bit of the beer into my mouth, I woke up strapped like Norman and Jason before me.  
“I have to say I am quite fond of you so I have decided not to do anything lethal on you, I will keep you as a friend” he said withdrawing a handsaw and a blow torch.   
He burned the blade red-hot and sawed my right ankle off, then the left one and slowly all my limbs were disconnected from my torso. I do not know what happened next I passed out, I suspect he buried the bodies and cleaned Jason’s house. I woke up in a suitcase after two days. 

He lets me out in the morning when he’s gone for classes and talks to me as if nothing happened that day. 

A month earlier my last hope was lost when the police officer came to Stuart’s Apartment. He questioned Stuart who apparently was deeply shaken and cried, the police officer consoled him and by the time Stuart mentioned that we did drugs the investigator was convinced that we had run away. Stuart was not guilty in the eyes of the law. That day I began writing this, I am sorry if it is not very well written and that couldn’t include many details as I am typing with my nose. I don’t know what his plan is after he gets his degree but one thing is for certain, he wont stop. I am writing this to warn you about [that cursed mark.](https://ibb.co/GxqXYkz)
