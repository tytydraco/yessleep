I sat on the couch for a while to calm down after what happened that night. I read your comments and some of you have said that the *thing* stalking me is my mother. Which, I mean, that’s insane. It can’t be. That doesn’t even make sense. Sure, it didn’t kill me and there’s a strange sense of familiarity to it, but it’s *not* my mom. It can’t be.

In an attempt to find some answers, I finally went into my dad’s old room. On his desk was a single paper. Considering the way he was acting, he probably left it out for me to find. But what I didn’t understand was why he didn’t just talk to me. Thankfully, the paper answered that question. But, even so, this left more questions than answers.

It seemed to be some sort of contract, both of my parents’ signatures written at the bottom in a brownish-red ink. Every week, a sacrifice of at least half a gallon of blood from any animal was to be left at an agreed upon location. The directions to said location were written out. Darcy Hoffman and Liam Hoffman are not to speak of this arrangement or of... someone with their name crossed out... under any circumstances. The Hoffmans are not to attack... the scribbled out name. In exchange, nobody from the Hoffman family was to be brought harm by— again, it’s scribbled out— for as long as this deal is still binding. Failure by the Hoffmans to comply with the agreed upon rules will render all protections granted to the guilty Hoffman null and void. The strength of these protections wavers the longer a sacrifice is not presented. Failure by (whoever’s name keeps getting scribbled out) to comply with the agreed upon rules will result in their eradication.

Jesus. What the fuck? As I read it over for a second time, I noticed a date in the upper right corner.

07/13/2008

I took in a sharp breath. This was around the time my parents sent me away to Brynn. So, yeah, way more questions. It seems like my dad was telling the truth when he said he couldn’t talk to me about what was happening. Not exactly optimal, but at least his behavior makes sense. And now I’m guessing they didn’t send me away for *school*. I don’t know why this person's name is scribbled out, but clearly they’re the creature that’s been stalking me. On the bright side, that means that it’s not my mom. Yay, I guess. But why did they have to make this deal in the first place? Why did this thing start bothering my parents? Where did it come from? Why was it so familiar? And what in the world is it?

I looked through the drawers of the desk, scanned every paper I could find, but none of them were related to my situation. God, why was this contract the only clue I had? I went around the rest of the room, but there was nothing of significance. This contract really was it. I didn’t know what to do, so I just tried to piece together what I could. I thought, again, about how the creature was dragged away by some strange invisible force. And then my dad had showed up covered in blood and holding a severed deer antler. My best guess is that he delivered another sacrifice that night. As for why he did it *then* and out of the blue? Well, probably the call with Brynn. He must’ve overheard her ask if I’d seen the creature again and then freaked out.

And then that thought process made me think about my mom. My dad didn’t say anything about her death to me and Brynn, but he brought her up while I was questioning him last night. My god, I already wasn’t a fan of this thing, but if it was what killed my mom— She knew about it, since she signed the contract. But her dementia. If she went outside and attacked it, that would’ve broken the contract… I felt sick. What was this thing trying to get out of tormenting us? Some sick pleasure or something else? I stayed up for hours, wondering what to do next. I had basically no information on what it was and couldn’t talk to my dad about it. It was only a matter of time before it came back, and I absolutely was not prepared for that. Despite my anxiety, my body was spent and I fell asleep trying to come up with solutions.

I had the first dream I'd had in months. Well, I mean, it was kind of better described as a nightmare. Not much happened to be honest. I just watched a lake. For hours. It was the same lake me and Maddie used to visit, but I was alone this time. Somewhere from the darkness of the surrounding woods, I was being watched. I couldn’t move or do anything, but I could feel it. It went on for the entire nightmare. Something staring at me as I stared at a lake. I’m not sure how long I was asleep for, but I woke up in a cold sweat and with the sun in my eyes. I was still on the couch but I knew something was wrong. Even after waking up, I felt watched. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I looked around. It wasn’t difficult to spot. I’d left the living room curtains open last night. Looking back at me was the creature. I screamed and scrambled backwards, but it didn’t move. It was staring at me with an intensity I didn’t think was possible for something with no irises or pupils.

I was too scared to move. Having read the contract, I knew it couldn’t attack me, but that didn’t make it any less threatening. It seemed to set off something primal in my brain, something that was blocking out all logic. I didn’t want to turn my back on it, but I also didn’t want to get closer to close the curtains. Our eyes locked for a while. I don’t know if it was angry-- It was hard to tell with no emotion on its face. But something was definitely different in its demeanor. Maybe it knew I’d read the contract. Maybe it was mad that it got dragged away before it was able to do anything to me. I didn’t know.

Out of nowhere, it slammed its hand on the window. I flinched and shrank back, but when I opened my eyes again, it was gone. The only trace it had left was a bloody handprint on the glass. I stayed frozen in the same spot for a while, scared that moving would make it come back. But when I sat up, nothing happened. I took the opportunity and rushed over, pulling the curtains closed again. What the fuck was its goal? Just to torment me? It was working. I spent that day locked up in my house, trying my best not to panic.

I felt helpless, and that feeling only grew worse when the tapping began. I’d moved to my room and, at around midnight, I heard something walking outside. It paced around for about an hour before it began tapping on my window. And it went on *all night*. Rhythmic tapping for hours. It’s not like I had much hope that I’d be able to sleep that night anyways, but it was a testament to how it had control of the situation. I cried, I yelled at it through the window, I tried moving rooms. Nothing worked. It followed me, never stopping. 

Slowly, the dread of everything was working itself into me. Was this going to be the rest of my life? Even if my dad made the trip down here every week and gave an acceptable sacrifice, he wasn’t going to be around forever. And I don’t exactly have the guts to hunt. But even then, I’d have to do it every week just to keep this thing from hurting me. And *even then*, it could still make my life hell. There’s nothing to say that it’s tied to these woods. I mean, it got Brynn into a car accident when she was nowhere near the house. Moving back to the city would just make providing the blood it wanted even harder. I suppose that’s why my parents stayed here. But how could they possibly have lived like this for so many years? It was only after around four and a half hours that I tried something. Listening. The tapping, I noticed, was delivered in patterns. I was tired and stressed, so it took me a while to think about trying morse code. There was nothing else to do anyway. Now, I’m not very familiar with morse code, so I had to look it up. But, miraculously, it worked. The creature was giving me a message.

“‘Behind the shed’” I read out loud. As soon as I did, the tapping stopped. It made me nervous at first; now I didn’t know where it was. But even then, I was just really glad that it was over. As I waited for the sun to rise, I wondered whether or not I should go check it out. This thing *wanted* me to, but that meant it could be dangerous. But if I didn’t go then I might anger it. But maybe it was already angry that I had read the contract, so this was its revenge. But what did any of it matter anyways? Either the contract would run out and it would be able to attack me, or the contract *wouldn’t* run out and I’d live the rest of my life like this. The only choices I could see were a premature death or a long life of giving blood to a demon that would torment me until I died. And I was running on very limited information, so by the time it was sunrise, I’d decided that I might as well risk it. Even after having decided that though, opening the front door was still nerve wracking. It took me a full ten minutes to get it done. I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn’t allowed to hurt me.

I took the doorknob, every inch of my body telling me to stop, and opened the door. Nothing. The sun was out and the coast was clear. I took a deep breath and walked outside, turning towards the shed. Still nothing. Okay, one step at a time. As I moved forwards, I glanced behind me at the living room window. The handprint was gone, only a few red smears left. I turned away, nauseous, as I recalled the memory of it licking blood off the floor. Almost at the shed, I braced myself, unsure of what to expect. From where I was I could hear buzzing that got louder with every step. The creature did not disappoint in the disturbing department. As I turned the corner, I saw red letters smeared onto the shed’s metal wall. The blood was still wet and I could smell it from where I was. The source of the buzzing was a small swarm of what seemed to be deer flies. I took a step back and looked past them at the blood they were feeding off of.

There was yet another message. ‘DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID?’ More than that, the old drawing I made of me and my imaginary friend had been tampered with. A bloody smile was drawn onto my face while my friend’s eyes were crossed out. I actually did throw up that time. The smell was disgusting and the sight was worse. ‘Do you know what they did?’ I didn’t even know who this thing was talking about. Someone in the comments mentioned that this may have something to do with my imaginary friend. I guess they were right. What my friend has to do with this, I have no idea. I could barely remember him honestly. I couldn’t even remember what I called him. Why is it that when I get a new piece of information, so many more questions come up because of it? I shook my head and went back inside. Then, I changed my mind, grabbing my keys and walking out to my car. I was already scared and stressed, so I didn’t feel like spending yet another day in that small house.

As I started up my car, I saw movement in my peripheral vision. Could it not just leave me alone for two fucking seconds? I ignored it and started driving. Still, it followed. I could see it moving between the trees, switching between crawling and running. My skin got goosebumps, but I continued on. Once I reached town it would probably screw off for a while. I just needed a few hours of peace. I drove for about ten minutes with no issue other than the running pest alongside my car. It was then I realized that if this thing had really wanted to catch me a few nights ago, it could’ve. I took a deep breath and— it was gone. I slowed the car for a moment and glanced to the left. Nothing. Then I sped up. Maybe it got bored? I was still twenty minutes away from town, so it wasn’t hiding from other people. But, of course it couldn’t let me be. A few miles ahead of me, I saw a figure run out onto the road. It stood there, waiting. Obviously my first instinct was to plow right through it, but as I got closer and closer, I remembered. *The Hoffmans are not to attack* ***it***. But I was too close now to break. As I did months ago, I swerved the car in an attempt to avoid a collision. Tires screeched across the pavement as my car slowed, threatening to tip over. It spun and ended up slightly off the road as it came to a jolting stop. My breathing was quick, but I looked back up at the creature, hoping my car had missed it. It seemed to be standing where it was before, only having moved to turn and stare at me. Then it took a step forward. My blood ran cold. Was it going to attack me?

Apparently that answer would have to wait. In the distance, I could hear a car approaching. The creature didn’t turn to look. Instead, it started walking backwards towards the woods. It didn’t crawl or move unnaturally, which was horrifying in its own way. By the time the car was in view, it had disappeared into the trees.

The vehicle slowed as it approached. I felt like I recognized it from somewhere. Through the windshield I spotted a familiar looking man that seemed to be about my father’s age. Once he reached me, he stopped his car and got out, walking over. Only when I moved to lower the window is when I noticed how tightly I’d been gripping onto the steering wheel. My heart was still beating in my ears and I tried to calm myself down.

“Are you okay?” He asked as he inspected my car.

I glanced into the woods, “Yeah. Just shaken,”

He looked at me for a long moment, “Have I seen you before?”

“Have I seen you?”

He chuckled but I was barely able to focus on his presence. I leaned back in my chair and took a deep breath, “Are you sure you’re okay?”

No. I wasn’t. Especially not once I spotted *it* again, half standing behind a tree on the other side of the street. But, oddly, the creature wasn’t staring at me, and it wasn’t hiding. It was staring at the man next to me. I sat back up. Was it going to do something? Why? My dad just gave it blood two days ago.

He must’ve noticed me staring off, because the man followed my gaze. He said nothing as he locked eyes with it. I turned to look at him, but his expression isn’t what I expected. He looked surprised, obviously, but there was also a hint of annoyance. Even stranger, the creature looked upset. Its expression remained unchanged, yet its rage was evident. I looked between the two of them, confused. The man was the one to break the ice, “How did you get out…?” He muttered, presumably to the creature.

“You know something about it?” I asked quickly. Despite the strange circumstances of the situation, I was immediately excited that I’d finally be able to get answers from someone.

After a few moments, the man acknowledged me, “Too much,” He said, his eyes still locked onto it, “He’s my biggest regret,”

Before I had time to process that last part, the creature charged forwards. It ran into the man, sending him flying back. I was speechless. The man slammed backwards into a tree, but the creature ran towards him yet again. I thought he would be killed, but he said something before that could happen. I couldn’t hear what it was, but the cracks in the creature’s skin flashed red, causing it to scream. Instead of trying to attack again, the creature ran back off into the woods. The sound of its running footsteps quickly faded away, leaving the both of us in silence. I wasn’t sure what to say. The man took a few minutes to recover from the first attack. When he finally walked back over, he approached my car.

“Has he done anything to you?” He asked, looking annoyed and somewhat guilty. Detailing exactly all the things that thing had done to me so far was too long of a response, so instead I just nodded, “I suppose it’s only fair I tell you about him then. We’ll talk someplace safer,”

With that, he moved back to his car. I followed when he drove off, my mind swimming with questions. Who was he? How did he know about this thing? Why did he call it a ‘he?’ And why was it his biggest regret? What did he do? What did he say to get it to back off? That twenty minute drive felt like an eternity. I didn’t see it again on the drive over. That was a good sign. When we reached town, the man decided to pull into the café parking lot. I parked next to him and quickly got out of my car, ready to finally get some answers. I reached him before he’d even closed his door.

“What’s your name?” He asked as he turned to lock the car.

“Saul,”

The man paused, looking shocked, “Hoffman?” A strange expression began to form on his face. Possibly anger.

“Um, yeah,” I said, confused by his sudden aggression.

“I knew I recognized you,” He said, a scowl settling on his face.

“I’m sorry?”

“No wonder he’s chasing you. After all the shit your parents did,” He spoke as he opened his car door, getting back inside.

“What?” I rushed over as he slammed the door shut, “You can’t just leave! What are you talking about?!” Not again. I couldn’t have my chance at getting answers just run away *again*.

At that he smiled. A shallow, vindictive smile. He rolled down the car window, just a crack, “They never told you?”

“Told me what?! Nobody’s told me anything!”

He started the car, forcing him to speak above the engine, “Well, your father’s going to have a fun time explaining all of this to you. What did they say when you had to move away?”

It took me a moment to find my answer. I wasn’t expecting *that* to be brought into this, “They said it was for school,”

He chuckled and shook his head to himself, “What a load of bullshit,” He said as he backed out of the parking space, “They didn’t want you to know what they did,” He called out before driving off.

I stood there, baffled. I’d just driven twenty minutes with this guy to be blown off for some obscure reason. Ridiculous. And incredibly annoying. What the fuck was he even talking about? I still didn’t even know who he was, but apparently he hated me. Or, he hated my parents. Eventually I went inside, angry and confused. The first thing I did when I sat down was pull out my phone and call my dad.

The phone rang for a few moments before he answered, “Saul? Is something wrong?”

“Yeah. Just met some guy that seems to hate me over something you and mom did,” I waited for him to speak, but he never did, “Did you guys do something?”

He was silent again for a long time, and I almost thought he wasn’t going to respond. The tone of his voice was simultaneously laced with guilt and anger, “Gideon has reasons to hate me… but he’s not innocent himself,”

I waited for him to continue, but he didn’t, “What did you do?”

He took a deep breath, “I assume you’ve gone into my room. This falls into the category of things that I can’t talk about,”

I clenched my jaw and tried to regulate my temper. That contract was protecting me, but it was also a massive thorn in my side. I couldn’t do anything for my situation without information

“All I can say is that we sent you to Brynn so you wouldn’t be affected by it all,”

I buried my face into my hands, already done with the conversation. Anytime anyone said anything relevant to what was going on, they made the situation more confusing. I just wanted this to stop. Anything to make it stop. My father’s muffled voice from the phone brought my attention back.

“Just stay away from Gideon. He’s not a good person,” He said seriously, “Now, are you sure you’re okay? Did something happen?”

“Yeah, I’m great,” I contemplated for a moment whether I should even bother recounting what happened, “That thing ran me off the road. The car’s a bit scratched up but that’s about it—” Just then, someone put down a plate in front of me. I looked up at Maddie, who looked very clearly concerned at what she’d overheard. I only continued once she’d left, “And Gideon did something weird. He passed by me on the road and stopped to see if I was hurt. And,” I glanced outside, unnerved by the memory, “And— *it* attacked him. But, he said something and it backed off. And, he said something weird. He said that it was ‘his biggest regret,’”

My dad cleared his throat, “It would be concerning if Gideon didn’t regret his decisions,” The vagueness of the comment was irritating, but it was likely all he could give.

Anyways, the rest of the day isn’t all that important compared to what happened at night. The rest of my call with dad didn’t yield any more information. I explained to Maddie that an animal had run in front of my car, but nothing serious happened. After a few hours of moping and simmering down, the café was beginning to close. I reluctantly made my way back to my car and started driving. Nothing seemed to be following me, though it was difficult to tell once the sun had set. The peaceful drive was misleading. I reached my house without issue, didn’t feel watched or anything, and eventually went to sleep.

The nightmare came out of left field. I was back at the lake, but things were different. Namely, instead of staring at the water, I was under it. There was a split second of shock before the panic set in. The lake seemed deeper than it should’ve been, the surface a million miles away. My lungs burned as I kicked and thrashed around, desperately trying to find an escape. Fear coursed through every inch of my body. Panic and the urge to take a breath were the only two things occupying my mind. I must’ve only been under for around two to three minutes, but each second was an agonizing eternity. My fear never once wavered, even as my movements began to slow. Eventually, I inhaled water. Once, then twice. And when my vision darkened, I stopped counting. And the worst part of that nightmare is that I knew it was not my own, nor was it a work of fiction. It was a memory.

I woke up in a cold sweat, unable to see in the darkness and my body shaking. Something was wrong. I still couldn’t breathe. Something was pressing down on my chest, making it nearly impossible to take a breath. However, as something ran down my cheek, I became aware that there was some sort of liquid filling my lungs. At first I reached towards my face, my hand touching whatever was coming out of my mouth. Not natural— it was something warm and viscous. As I moved to sit up and get rid of whatever was on my chest, a coarse hand held my head down. My head ached as my body fought to breathe, but underneath all of that chaos was one, clear message. One word being repeated over and over. One name.

*Mike*

I knew immediately where I recognized it from, but my brain didn’t process it in that moment. All it could think of was getting out of this situation. It was so hard to think and was getting progressively harder to move. Lifting my arm to fight off whoever was holding me down took far more effort than it should’ve. My muscles ached and my bones felt impossibly heavy. I gagged and coughed up some of the liquid in my throat, but it didn't help. I gripped the arm holding down my head and tried to shove it away, painfully aware of how feeble my attempts were. Under my hand was dust of some sort, which I could later recognize as ash, covering the person’s cracked and rough skin. It was then that my brain vaguely recalled who, or what, was holding me down. That fact played little part in the horror I already felt. I was certain I was going to die. Darkness crept into my consciousness and I could feel myself slipping away. My arm dropped back down to my side, lacking the energy needed to continue functioning properly.

I don’t remember when it left, only that I fell off of my bed. I was barely aware of the pain that the fall caused. Then I threw up. I hardly had the energy to lift my head more than a couple inches above the floor; it felt like trying to lift a bowling ball with my pinky. I lost count of how many times I threw up. Just that there was an impossible amount of whatever that liquid was. Absolutely everything hurt, including every inch of my brain. Everything is really blurry from that time. I passed out at some point, waking up in the same place I’d been before.

I lied there for who knows how long, processing everything that had happened. Sunlight shone through the crack in the curtains, illuminating the floor beneath me. The only remnants of whatever I’d thrown up last night were the traces of a dark black substance between the floorboards. Everything still ached. I stayed there for what must’ve been hours, eventually breaking down and crying. Sobbing, really. The gasping for air was painful, but I couldn’t stop.

It took a very long time, but I was eventually able to collect myself. I got up off the floor, changed, then washed my face.

I don’t think I’m going to survive this thing. There are still so many unknowns about it and it clearly doesn’t like me. It could’ve killed me last night. It chose not to. It wants me to suffer, I’m sure of it. I’m honestly too overwhelmed right now to think. I spent hours just processing what had happened that night before finally grabbing my phone and writing this all out. I decided that, if I die tonight, it might as well not remain a mystery.

Let it be known that, whatever happens to me, it was Mike. Mike. The name of my old imaginary friend. I don’t know what happened to him, or why he is what he is now. But I now know it’s Mike.

If I survive, or find any information, I’ll be back to update you guys.
