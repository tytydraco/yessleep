Luna is a tabby cat that belonged to my neighbour and has lived on my street for over six years. I’ve never owned a cat and the closest experience I’ve ever had to one was Luna, so frequent high-pitched meows to be petted and the occasional cloud of feathers littered across our gardens soon became the norm. I’m a student studying Biomedical science in a city that I would consider the opposite to the close-knit community of my home village where my family still live. Cheap dopamine and miraged strangers disguised as close friends has likely warped my memories of the village I once lived in but after coming home at the end of the school year… Something is seriously wrong.

 

Luna is dead. Not just dead, she’s mutilated. A concoction of flesh, bone and fur scraped across the pavement near my neighbour’s drive. When my parents picked me up and brought me home, I couldn’t believe I missed her as we entered the semi-circle arrangement of mine and our neighbour’s homes but the stench as I opened the car door was unmissable. The smell was so overpowering and unlike anything my professor could throw at us in dissections that he reasoned would “line our stomachs”. Even being outside it was like being smothered by an overpowering force of rotting meat and soured milk which accumulatively made the victim succumb to dry heaved gags to expel its toxication and desperate inhales as if you were drowning.  As I spun round in desperation looking for the source I locked vision with the unmistakable green eyes of Luna. Her body an unrecognisable pile of splayed cracked ribs and flattened limbs, her head was comparatively pristine to the rest of her body bar evident signs of deterioration around her half gaping mouth. Instinctively, as if I were twelve again alerting my parents to anything big or small that bewildered a child’s mind, I pointed at Luna darting my head towards my dad, “Lun-“

“Lunch? Did you hear that dear our little grown up isn’t so independent after all. Come on in and we’ll fix you up something to eat. You’ve been gone so long it’s a miracle you’ve lasted this long on pot noodle and burnt eggs”

 

My dad chuckled as he unlocked the door, him and my mum entering inside. An Overbearing sense of hopelessness came over me as I obediently followed them inside and sat down at the kitchen table.

 

The cat belongs to my neighbour Ida who lives opposite our house. She’s somewhere in her late 60’s early 70’s who has no husband, children or friends despite the odd visits people on my street pay to her and the awkward exchanges we shared when I delivered her the morning paper some years back. The following morning I tried walking over to Luna’s body with the intention of giving her the much-needed respect she deserved of a proper burial but was stopped dead in my tracks by Ida suddenly appearing in her front doorway. A saucer of milk in one hand and a crumpled tissue in the other Ida tried to coach her cat over to the door with an ensemble of kissing sounds and calling her by her name. Defeated, Ida placed the milk outside among an arrangement of similar looking bowls and saucers. I can’t be the one to break this woman’s fantasy. Everyone I speak to from my parents to my neighbours welcoming me home, has not in anyway spoken or hinted towards the situation of Ida and Luna.

 

The gleam of the cat’s eyes staring back at me in the moonlight hues and the evolving stench each morning became unbearable. My parents were washing dishes at the sink. Swallowing my anxiety and with a quite mumble from my seat at the table I said what no one else would.

 

“Why isn’t anyone moving Luna?”

 

My parents with their backs facing me became motionless and it was if the entire street had become instantaneously silent as if by command. The upbeat rhythm of the radio on the kitchen side was the only sound to be heard. A sudden knock at the door broke the tension and almost on cue both my parents scurried off to the door only a few mummers barely audible.

“Sorry honey me and your father forgot we made plans this evening with the Whittick family, your welcome to join but it will be quite dull for you I fear. I don’t even know why I even made plans with them myself, they can be quite a bore”.

 

With that my parents left the house. This is the closest I have come to speaking about Luna since coming home. I spoke to a friend from university about this and he suggested asking here. Please, if there’s anything you can suggest it helps a lot more then you realise. This whole thing is making me restless.
