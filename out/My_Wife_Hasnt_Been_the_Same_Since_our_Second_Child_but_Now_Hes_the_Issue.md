A break is what we needed. That break made all the difference.

I had to do mandatory anger management classes, and she had to see a therapist. The difference that made changed our world. 

She got custody of our son back, and I could set up planned visits to see him, with either her mom or mine present, while my classes were still ongoing. Upon finishing, charges were dropped, and she asked me to move back in. I was excited to be a family again. I had a few very lonely months, and paying rent on top of a mortgage was a huge financial drag. 

My wife was working again. I’m not sure what she told her boss, or if her therapist wrote a note for her, but either way, it worked. She was also cooking and cleaning. She was communicating! We weren’t sleeping in the same room (she had the bedroom and I was in the spare room), but she wasn’t sneaking around at night, looming over us in our sleep. 

Things felt normal. 

For the first time in months, I went to work, while my ready-for-the-day wife took our son to daycare. She brought him home after her shift, and had dinner on the table when I got home. I did the dishes, we played a game as a family afterwards, and she and I put our son to bed together like before. I was happy.

Knowing my wife, (and she did seem like my wife again!) I knew she wasn’t completely happy. Her half-smile gave her away, and there was still a bit of sadness in her eyes, but that’s what I was prepared for before the crazy world we had spiraled into prior to this. She still had therapy appointments booked, so I figured time would heal those wounds. 

We had several good weeks, and even fit a couple of weekend trips in our schedule for some much needed bonding time. Our son loved throwing rocks into the lake, and we did some long, evening walks downtown. Things were good. 

Then one evening, after our son was asleep, she came to me with news I wasn’t expecting. 

“I’m pregnant.” Her face lit up with excitement, such a genuine smile plastered on her face. 

My heart sank, and I felt a mixture of anger and disbelief. How could she be so happy about this? We’d been doing so great. I couldn’t mask my emotions when I finally spoke, “You do realize we haven’t been intimate since before your last pregnancy, right? I really can’t share your enthusiasm here. Who have you been seeing? Was he in *our* house while I was living in that stupid, little apartment?!”  

Her face turned sour, “No! It’s yours!”

She tried to continue, but I cut her off, “It’s obviously not! Fine if you don’t want to tell me who you were with, but don’t stack lies upon lies. Our relationship is still fragile, and trust has to be earned. This is a huge setback.”

“He IS yours!” She insisted. “It’s *him*!”

“Him? Like you already know the gender? How far along are you?!”

“HIM.” She repeated. “He wasn’t ready for this world the last time, but he is now. He said he was coming back, and I didn’t know how, but I missed a period, and took a test, and I know it’s him!”

I stared at her in disbelief. She’d been so sane the past several weeks, and it wasn’t a rage-filled crazy, but this was just a different flavor of crazy. “I need some space tonight. We can talk about this more tomorrow,” was all I could muster before holing up in my room. 

I knew another pregnancy meant the world to her, and I now knew all too well what kind of havoc a miscarriage could wreak on her. So, we talked and made-do and when it was time for the first ultrasound, I made sure to be there with her. 

She was shaking while we drove to the obgyn’s office. I put my hand on hers to try and comfort her, but knew only the sound of a heartbeat and the sight of little, kicking feet would truly calm her nerves. 

We were escorted into the same room as last time. The same chair we witnessed our first child’s little movements, and our second’s lifeless, empty sack.

Jelly was applied to her belly, and the monitor slowly moved over her, and there it was: *thump thump thump,* at the quick speed that fetal heartbeats move, and then the little head, body, limbs: moving, bouncing, alive. My wife laughed in relief, and happy tears streamed down her face. 

I was relieved for her, but still wasn’t exactly elated to see the product of another man inside of my wife, whether she admitted to it or not. She’s not the Virgin Mary. 

“Do you know how far along you are?” the ultrasound tech asked her.

“Maybe 8 weeks? It’s been about two months since my last period,” my wife answered.

“Well, Baby is measuring a lot bigger than 8 weeks. I’d guess more like 14 or 15 even!” 

“Oh wow! I’ve probably just lost track of time! I’m just so relieved to see him alive and well!” 

She was all smiles. 

We went home with a string of sonogram pictures, and she excitedly showed our son, pointing to her belly, and explaining that he’d soon have a baby brother. Though, technically speaking, the gender hadn’t been identified yet, but we’d know soon enough at the 20 week anatomy scan. 

A month later, we found out it was a boy, and to my dismay, this fueled her belief that our second child together was growing inside of her now. 

She continued having appointments, her mom and sisters put together a baby shower, and I watched as her belly grew larger and larger. Seeing a baby move inside of a woman's womb is such an alien experience, but something just felt so off about this one. The weird quivering her stomach did sent shivers down my spine. But, she insisted on it being a great sign, and would have our son come watch and feel. 

She did not like her hospital birth last time, and equated it with the trauma of the surgery to remove the last pregnancy, so she absolutely insisted on a home birth. I was not excited about this, but it's not my body. 

Our son went to stay at her mom's when my wife began having steady contractions. We had a midwife to assist, but if you've ever witnessed a birth, you know it's a painful and bloody sight. 

She paced the house, rocked on her yoga ball, sucked on ice, all the while pausing with deep, guttural groans as the contractions hit in waves. 

I also wasn't thrilled that our bed was the spot that the real process took place. The midwife helped get my wife into a good position, and the pushing began. Strained cries and screaming filled the room until finally, a tiny cry took the place of his mother's. He was born. He was alive. It was hard not to be emotional with her after the whole ordeal. 

Our son met his brother, and we moved on as a family of four. 

I wanted to wait until my wife wasn't newly postpartum and sleep deprived to request a paternity test. I knew he was not my son, but she was still living in the delusion that he was. And, I found it hurtful that she choose to use the same name as our baby that didn't make it. Not to mention how uncouth it was to have a live child with a birth certificate reading the same thing as the headstone down the road. 

We did eventually get an appointment set. She seemed annoyed when I'd asked, but not mad like I'd expected. The baby and I got our blood drawn, and now we just had to wait for the lab results. 

Those results showed up in my email a few days later: I *was* the father. An unquestionable genetic match. How?! 

“I *told* you!” My wife sneered. 

“This isn't even possible!” I stammered back. “You *know* this isn't possible, right?!” 

“But, we've just proved it *is*!” She said with a huge grin. It was very unsettling.

I sat on the couch as my head spun. There was literally no way. It'd been well over a year, maybe two at this point, since we'd done anything that could get her pregnant! The test was wrong. Somehow, it was wrong. 

Or, so I told myself. 

The baby grew quickly, and he hit milestones much faster than our first son. My wife told me this was normal for second-borns, as they have an older sibling to imitate. 

She encouraged our older boy to play with his younger brother, and he seemed to really love “his baby.” 

The blood test may have said this was my baby, but he would have nothing to do with me. He cried if I held him, wouldn't take a bottle from me, and wouldn't touch toys I'd bring to him. When he was able to crawl, he'd head to the opposite side of the room as me. 

“You know it's because he's still harboring resentment towards you,” my wife told me one day. “You didn't visit his gravesite. I did.” 

“For the love of God, please stop with that!” I spat. Sleepless nights didn't help my emotional state. 

Her face turned sour, “it's the truth.” And, she headed back to care for him. 

Weeks became months, and months became a year. 

We celebrated his 1st birthday, and he was all smiles with everyone except me. He had already mastered a few words, but “dada” was not one of them. But, everyone seemed to have a good time, and our older boy was super excited to have a party, help his baby brother open presents, and to share some birthday cake. 

Nobody else knew the impossible-ness of this baby. Nobody else seemed to think twice about his rapid developmental growth. To everyone else, we were just a happy, growing family. 

…

By a year and a half, he was walking and talking in full sentences. Our first picked up language fast, but not that fast.

We had just bought the boys a bunk bed for their room, and they seemed very excited about it. The crib plus a twin bed took up a lot of their play-space. Both boys giggled and ran around as we assembled it, washed their new bed-spreads, and put a slide on the top bunk. They loved it. 

But now, the boys’ mother was no longer the one looming around the house at night, it was *him*.  

I had gone to bed, and was starting to fade into a dream when I jerked awake. A little face, at my pillow level, was staring at me, emotionless. 

“You're supposed to be in bed.” I told him as I rolled out of my bed to walk him back to his room. 

He continued to stare and wouldn't budge, but unfortunately for toddlers, they're easy to pick up. His body was completely stiff and he didn't break eye contact as I carried him back. 

I woke up later than my wife the next day, and when we'd finished breakfast, she pulled me aside and accused me of being too harsh with the younger boy. 

She did make a good point, though: if it were our older boy, I would've asked him what was wrong and have tried to comfort him in some way. Maybe it was favoritism, but his uncanny stare was much too like his mother's, and I saw no signs of distress. Just possibly, signs of malice and ill-intent. 

This became a regular occurrence. I laid in bed ‘til he made his appearance, took him back to his room, and went on with my night. He never went into his mother's room. He never climbed up to stare at his brother. It was me with the target on my forehead. 

One night, when I picked him up, he bit me. Maybe I was too accustomed to his mother's fits, but I had no patience for that, and I did raise my voice more than I should've, “YOU do NOT bite! Do you hear me? We do not bite people.” 

Unfortunately, this seemed to have no effect on him, but it did happen to wake both his brother and mother who were very startled and upset at the outburst. 

“What are you doing to him?!” My wife demanded from her room. 

“Taking him back to his bed like I do every night! But, he bit me this time!” 

“Dad, you have to be nice!” Our older boy's voice came from down the hall. “He's just a baby!” 

“I know.” I sighed. “I'm sorry. Can we please all go back to bed?”

When I got back into my room, I could see the bloody tooth imprints on my hand; too reminiscent of his mother for my liking. 

He didn't bite after that. 

One night, though, I'd been excessively tired, and I tried to stay up for his nightly visit, but just couldn't. 

I woke myself up with a jerk from a snoring fit. I can't sleep on my back. But, I about fell off the bed when I saw him in my face, with a small kitchen knife in his tiny fist. 

“No, no, no! This is NOT for you!” I scolded, but I knew the fear was very obviously coming through as I snatched the knife and tossed it on my bedside table before scooping him up. 

After he was back in bed, I went into the kitchen to investigate. The knife drawer had a child lock, and all of the dishes should've been done and put away. Maybe a knife had been left in the dishwasher by mistake? 

Broken plastic pieces lay in and under the drawer. I guess I'd need to invest in better child locks. 

That's exactly what I did the next day. After work, I went and bought some heavy-duty, magnet locks. You had to have the main magnet in a certain spot on the cabinet door or drawer to unlock the mechanism, and then you could open it. It's a pretty cool invention. 

I put the big magnet on the top of the fridge, where only myself and my wife could reach. 

That night, he wasn't holding a knife: he'd found scissors. 

The next morning after breakfast, I pulled my wife to the side, “You can not leave scissors out where the boys can get into them! I put locks on everything for a reason!”

“What do you mean, ‘leave them out’?! I didn't! I didn't even use them to leave them out in the first place. They've been in that drawer. So, don't you go accusing me!” 

With that, I felt for the key on the top of the fridge, and it was still there. This child was 18 *months*. There was no way he could have moved a chair to the fridge, or have had the coordination to climb said chair to reach the top. I don't even think he'd have been tall enough with a chair! Not to mention, he would've had to have the thought process to put the key back to avoid suspicion. It was a ridiculous thought to entertain, but somehow he'd ended up with the pair of scissors. 

I waited for my wife to leave with the boys for daycare, and then I moved the baby monitor to the top of the fridge.  

That night, I woke to something scratching on my forehead, moving down my eyebrow and towards my eye itself! I slapped the little arm, and he dropped the ball-point pen he'd been drawing on my face with. He just stared at me, and this time I just stared back, wide-eyed, before grabbing him and putting him back in bed. 

Luckily, a bar of soap and some water took the marks off. 

When I got back to my room, I saw he'd scribbled all over the sheet leading up to my pillow, and did some more artwork on the pillow itself before finally reaching my face. 

The next night, I contemplated locking my room, but that felt negligent with small children in the house, so I didn't. 

I wish I would have listened to my better judgement.

He didn't come in as per usual. Instead, he arrived much later, after I was sound asleep. 

I woke to a stabbing sensation in my arm. I screamed and blindly grabbed around in the dark. 

I must've been close to him because the next hit was to my hand, right through the palm. 

I cried out, cursing and yelling for my wife.

“You think she's gonna help you?” his tiny voice said. That was probably the first sentence he'd ever directed explicitly towards me. 

I caught the knife with my other hand, and stabbed it through the wall, well above my head. He was not going to grab it again. 

Blood dripping everywhere, I hugged him tight, stopping his arms from moving, and pulled him onto the bed, over the bed, and carried him to his mother's room. 

At first she was horrified, thinking I'd done something to the child, but then had obvious relief when it was just me who was bleeding profusely. Fuck me, I guess.

“I can't deal with this right now. I need to clean myself up,” I spat as I dropped him onto her bed. 

She embraced him and began mumbling something to him, but it was inaudible to me. 

I shut the bathroom door and paced inside. I thought I should go to the hospital, but how would I explain it? I can’t say, “my toddler got a knife and stabbed me.” That would immediately warrant a CPS visit, and I’d be the guilty party for letting my child get a knife. 

I tried to dress the wound with what we had, but it was bleeding a lot, so I started formulating a story, grabbed my keys, and told my wife I was leaving. 

The stab on my arm wasn’t too deep, surprisingly, but my hand needed stitches. To them, a glass window shattered and a large chunk caught my hand. Maybe they knew it was bullshit, but what did it matter anyways.  

I wasn’t worried about my older son or wife, as the younger was fond of them both. It was just me. I drove around for a bit before heading home. How was I even going to address this?

When I did get back, I tried to ask my wife for suggestions; she knew him best.

“Just talk to him,” She told me. “You haven’t accepted him and he knows it.”

“As if that will work,” I rolled my eyes. “I say things to him every single night. Nothing has changed. In fact, it’s gotten worse!” I gestured with my bandaged hand. 

“You’re just mad at him. You’re not trying to figure out what’s going on with him. Talk to him.”

“He’s not even two years old! Conversations don’t get too deep at this age. He needs help; just like you had needed help.”

She didn’t like the last part I added in, and shook her head as she turned to leave. 

“No, seriously! There’s something wrong with him!” I pleaded.

“I already told you what to do.” She replied coldly.

That night, I did lock my door. If either boy needed anything, they could get their mother.

Luckily, we had finally reached the weekend. My sleep was lacking as rolling onto my left side jarred me awake from the pain, and when I was conscious, I could feel my hand pulsating. 

I got up early on Saturday due to the aforementioned issues, and took a couple of extra strength Tylenol before plopping down on the couch. Maybe I could rest a bit there. But, that was a short lived idea as I heard rustling from the boys’ room. 

It was the younger boy. 

He sat on the opposite side of the couch as me, and I asked if he wanted a show. To my surprise, he answered and even told me what he wanted to watch. So, we sat in silence together, watching cartoons.

Not too long after he got up, his brother followed, and then their mother. She took the younger boy back to his room to get him changed, and started making breakfast afterwards. My older son sat right beside me and poked at my bandage. 

“Is your hand ok, Dad?” 

“It still hurts, but it’s getting better.” I told him. 

“That’s good,” he said. Then, he scooted over to his little brother’s side, and they talked and laughed as the show continued. 

It was uncanny how calm and normal the days were compared to the nights. 

When nighttime hit again, I left the door open, and the younger boy walked in at his usual time. I told him to sit next to me, but he just stared. We would make-do. 

I showed him the monitor recording from our eventful night. The image was staticy when he entered the kitchen, and I could hear the magnet fall off the fridge, but you couldn’t make it out from the visuals. Any other video with him did not have this effect. And, after he’d grabbed the knife and left, it went back to normal. Maybe there was some sort of time skip, but later in the video, you could just see the magnet reappear at the top of the fridge. It was absolutely crazy, but he didn’t respond at all.

“What happened here?” I asked.

No answer. 

“Why do you want to hurt me?”

No answer.

“Did you make your mom hurt me before you were here?”

A small grin.

“You did, didn’t you?”

Back to a blank stare. 

“Why do you want to hurt me?” I repeated. 

Nothing. 

“I told your mom that you wouldn’t talk to me, and it’s late. You need to go back to your bed,” I sighed and started to get up to walk him back. 

“You don’t love me,” he stated monotonously. “My mom does, but you don’t.” 

A little taken aback that he spoke, I stopped and followed up with, “I care about you. I care about our family. And, I want us to all be happy and safe.”

“You wish I wasn’t here.”

“You’ve changed your mom’s world in more ways than one. I’d have done without some of the hardships of the first round, but she’s very happy you’re here.”

“You’re deflecting.” 

Where the hell did he hear that word? “I want me and you to get along.”

“I don’t want to. I just want my mom and brother. You don’t belong here.”

“Well, you’re going to have to live with me because I’m not leaving.” I retorted. 

“No,” he replied and walked himself back to his room. 

I locked the door again and replayed the conversation in my head as I fell asleep. 

To my dismay, I woke up again in the early hours of the morning, about the time his mother would have visited the gravesite. Somehow, he’d gotten past the lock and was standing over me on the bed, as domineering as such a small child could be. 

“No! Go back to bed,” I told him. 

To my surprise, he did, but he also got his point across: I couldn’t keep him out of anything. 

I couldn’t fall back to sleep, and this is where I lie in my predicament: if I leave, he wins and I lose everything. If I stay, I’m not safe, but at least everyone else in the house is. 

I finally had my wife back. I was watching my son grow up and love his little brother. Could I adapt to the craziness of it all? I might die trying.  

Maybe it was sleep deprivation, but I decided it was a risk I was willing to take.
