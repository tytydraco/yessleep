My dad forgot to pour milk in his coffee. I know that's not particularly scary, but you don't know him like I do. Personally, I don't care for the stuff. Always tasted like what I imagine liquid gunmetal tastes like. Anyway, he just sat there, slowly stirring this cup of milkless coffee. He was hypnotized by that solitary blob of foam which resides in every cup of caffeinated bitterness. Wanted to keep it spinning like the world's flattest perpetual motion machine.   


I don't think my heart *wrenched* at the sight of this. In fact, I'm not particularly sure what that would feel like. Wouldn't even want to. Sounds kind of painful. It was more like a melancholic sort of wince.   I placed my hands on his withered shoulders, silently congratulating myself on what an *empathetic* and *thoughtful* little daughter I was. Don't judge. We've all tried to comfort someone when really all we're doing is comforting ourselves.   


''Do you know how to spell miracle ? It's M-i-r-i-c-a-l, right ?'', he asked without tearing his gaze away from that cup. Having the opportunity to correct someone in their field of expertise would normally be a joyful experience for a smart-ass like myself. But this just made me feel hollowed out, an empty husk. The tinkling of the doorbell saved me from having to rectify this little lapse in theological knowledge.  


I hurried away from the sad, confused gaze that I no longer recognized. I clasped the doorknob, twisted and opened it to reveal...  
Nothing.  


No one. Zilch. I looked down and beheld a crimson box about as large as a toy chest. A big red bow was coiled around it, like a Christmas present from an old cartoon. A golden fish was emblazoned on the side. I looked around hoping to spot our gracious donor. I mean, dad is a prominent member of our tiny pisspot of a community. Or he was, anyway.   


Not a single person in sight. I did what any logical person would do in this situation. I muttered ''Screw it, it's free'' and hoisted the thing up before hauling it inside. His head jerked up at the thump of the box on the table.   


''The hell is this ?''  
''Don't know. Looks like something you'd order, though'', I replied.  He grunted at this before beginning to gingerly unwrap the thing, as if it would explode in his face if he rushed it. The bow drifted to the floor as he popped open the lid. A  cloud of dust burst forth and was blown away by nonexistent wind. I took notice of this strange occurrence but I didn't really notice it, if you catch my drift.   


We both peered into the mysterious package. A few scrolls were scattered about the inside of it like pieces of dead skin. Old, really expensive looking dead skin. I was afraid to touch one cause they looked like they'd crumble to bits if you looked at them wrong. Dad shared no such compunction. He just picked one up, unrolled it and started reading it like something he'd found at the paperback rack down at the drugstore.   
I remember seeing that lost and confused look fade as he gazed at those scrolls. A tiny smile began to spread across his face.'' What does it say ? '', I asked. '' This is theological knowledge straight from the source, Sammy'', he murmured.  
I frowned and peered over his shoulder to see what the fuss was about.  
   
The letters didn't resemble any language I'd heard of. The fact that letters are traditionally stationary and these letters were most certainly not that was also something that crossed my mind. Dad continued pawing the contents of the box, that smile permanently etched on his face. His coffee lay abandoned, cold and milkless.   


He spent the next few months at the dining room table going over what was in those books. Dad also made what I consider a staggering amount of notes on whatever they said.  I'd know when was working because the kettle would mysteriously turn on at certain parts of the night. This wasn't unusual considering his previous occupation. I was just happy that he seemed to have a purpose again.  


I didn't notice anything unusual until one night when I awoke to find him staring down at me. His jaw  moved up and down continuously. It was almost hypnotic. Now, I don't mean he was talking or muttering. I mean that his mouth was just rapidly opening and closing with no sound coming out. Eyes rolled back till only the whites showed, arms splayed to the side, creepy smile...   


You get the gist.  


This strange freaking occurrence continued occurring for about a week. He'd never remember it in the mornings. Or he pretended like he didn't remember. I always wondered if he knew that I knew that there was a possibility that he knew what he was doing at night. Dad would just smile sadly at me and we'd engage in some hackneyed conversation about how much we missed mom. I imagine our hands clasped together over the dinner table as we smiled over some fabricated, cloyingly sweet memories. Perhaps she's running along a beach with a Joker grin while I'm on dad's shoulders. Maybe he's running across the hot sand to catch up with her. You know the deal. I suspect everyone has some memories so perfect they have to be wrong.  


And the creepy occurrences seem like nothing more than the remnants of some forgotten nightmare.   


''The scrolls explain where she is, you know. And she's so happy there'', dad confides to me on one morning. I just nod at this. I reach over to clasp his shoulders and jerk my hand back. There was a sticky sort of warmth that seemed to pulse through his checkered shit. The kind of warmth you feel when you touch a fevered forehead. It's a type of warmth that stings. He grins at me and there's nothing warm about that.  


That night, I hear strange sounds drift up toward me from downstairs. I don't mean that in a druggy poetic sort of way. I mean something I can't see literally drifts up toward me and yells in my face.'' YOU'RE GOING TO SUFFER IN THE GRIP OF THE GREAT OLD ONES ONCE YOU DIE AND THIS FLESHY HUSK NO LONGER PROTECTS YOU FROM WHAT AWAITS!''.   


After receiving that helpful little factoid, I headed downstairs to see just what the hell my dad was messing with. I did not expect to find my father with gills running down his neck. He still had that same creepy smile, it was just fishier than usual. His skin had also become the color of Fanta grip. I could swear that his veins were writhing beneath his skin like a ball of snakes.  


'' Dad, I think you should put those scrolls away and go to bed. '', I said. That really was all I could think to do. ''Reading at night damages your eyes ! '', I yelled when this did not work. Sometimes throwing someone's own advice back in their face helps you get what you want. Not that time but I'm sure that  worked at some point.  


A tiny click signaled that the kettle had finished boiling.  I knew what I had to do. I poured the steaming water into the mug of instant coffee that was already waiting for me. A bonified divine *miracal*.  I was about to pour this divine justice over my dear father's head when I realized it might do permanent damage. So, I went back to the kitchen and added some cold milk.  


Then I poured that shit all over my old man's face. It was kind of funny how it seemed flow over his bald head. Made it look like what I imagine dinosaur eggs look like. He let out a single screech before his skin began turning normal. The house seemed to shake on its foundations, causing the table and the fridge to topple over. A photo of our family fell to the floor and shattered. How tragically cliché.  


He seemed normal again. Well, as normal as anyone can be. He looked at me. I looked at him. We seemed to come to some sort of wordless agreement. He went into the kitchen and came back with the kettle, which he then proceeded to pour over the scrolls. They burst into purple flame as the water made contact with him. A chorus of angry voices cursed at us before fading away and I cursed myself for not recording this.  
We both stood there breathing heavily after this was all done.   
''I think I'll just stick to books we can buy at the store'', he said.  
I still wonder about what the scrolls actually said. Especially about mom. But the oracle of clichéd advice always states that you should not believe everything you read. Except for what I just told you. That's all stuff you can believe. You may think this is an abrupt and anticlimactic ending. And you'd be
