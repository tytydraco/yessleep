Chapter One — The Voice in the Scrapyard

They called me Tommy Tank.
Strong. Hench. Hard as concrete, thicker than iron. People said I couldn’t be broken, not in a fight, not in life.

They were wrong.

The night it began was cold enough to gnaw bone. I was restless—muscles twitching, fists aching to smash something. I wandered into the scrapyard on the edge of town, where dead cars leaned against one another like corpses stacked in a trench. Their doors sagged open like slack mouths, rust spreading across their shells like rot.

The moon loomed overhead—swollen, yellow, and diseased-looking. The whole place smelled of oil and sour milk.

That’s when I heard it.

“Tommy Taaank…”

The voice was wet. Slippery. Like a tongue dragging across glass.

I spun around, fists raised, muscles tight. My breath steamed in the cold. Nothing but wrecks. Shadows.

Then one of the cars screamed.
The sound wasn’t metal—it was flesh being torn apart.

From the black husk of a burned-out Vauxhall, something climbed. A man-shaped thing, tall but crooked, its movements twitching like a puppet pulled by broken strings.

And it had no face.

No eyes, no nose, no mouth. Just blank skin stretched taut, pale and glistening under the moon. I froze. It shouldn’t have been able to speak, but a voice gurgled through it anyway, muffled and wet, as though bubbling up from deep water.

“You’re looking for it… aren’t you, Tank?”

I clenched my fists. My jaw ached with the pressure of my teeth grinding.
“Looking for what?”

It raised one trembling hand, finger thin as a twig, black nails dripping tar.

“The Goblin.”

The ground split.

The earth cracked open with a sound like a rib cage snapping wide. A stairwell yawned downward where solid ground had been seconds ago. Warm, foul air rolled up from it, thick as breath, carrying the stink of rot and coppery blood.

I staggered back—but my legs didn’t listen. My feet dragged forward, step after step, as though strings had been tied to my ankles.

The faceless man tilted his head. Though it had no mouth, I swear I saw it smiling beneath the smooth flesh.

“Go on, Tank. You’re strong enough. Go meet it.”

My boots thudded on the first step. The sound echoed wetly, as if inside a throat. I descended, the dark swallowing me whole.

The last thing I heard before the night closed in was laughter—low, slithering, bubbling inside my skull.

And it knew my name.

⸻

Chapter Two — The Goblin’s Throne

The staircase swallowed me whole.

Each step I took made the air thicker, hotter, like breathing through rotten meat. My boots sank into the surface. It wasn’t stone. It was soft. Spongy. With every footfall, I heard the squelch of flesh, the hiss of fluids being squeezed.

The walls pressed close around me, wet and pulsing. Veins bulged across them, dark and swollen, twitching faintly, as if blood was still pumping through. Black slime oozed from cracks, dripping onto my shoulders, burning my skin with its heat.

I gagged at the stench—sweet, sour, metallic. Like old milk curdled together with blood. The smell of something long dead, but still breathing.

And underneath it all, a sound.
Not echoes. Not wind.
Breathing.

The stairwell itself was alive.

⸻

I lost track of how long I descended. The air grew so heavy it clung to my lungs like tar. My head buzzed. My eyes watered. Shapes shifted in the walls—faces pressing outward, screaming silently before vanishing back into the meat. One brushed against my arm and I swore I felt teeth bite through the wall and snap at me.

The laughter began again.

Low. Slithering. Not in my ears, but inside my skull.
“Down you go, Tank. Down you go…”

My legs kept moving. They weren’t mine anymore. I clenched my fists, muscles bulging, veins swelling, but I couldn’t stop. My own body was a puppet.

The staircase ended abruptly. My boot sank into liquid. I looked down—ankle-deep in blood. The surface rippled as I waded forward, each step stirring the thick red pool.

Ahead, the chamber opened.

And there it was.

⸻

The throne.

A monument built from bones. Human bones. Hundreds of them. Skulls fused together, jaws locked in silent screams. Rib cages stacked high, still wrapped in tattered shreds of flesh. Femurs and spines intertwined like the frame of some obscene cathedral. The whole thing pulsed faintly, as if alive, as if the marrow within still remembered heat.

And upon it sat… the Goblin.

At first, I thought it was small. Pathetic, almost. A twisted little thing with limbs bent at wrong angles, bones poking against its pale, waxy skin. It twitched with every movement, joints cracking wetly. Its fingers were too long, tipped with claws black as tar, scratching against the bone throne with a sound like nails on glass.

But its head—

Christ. Its head was swollen, grotesquely large, veins crawling across it like worms beneath skin. The skull pulsed with every heartbeat, throbbing in rhythm with the chamber. Bulging eyes stared out, jaundiced yellow, twitching in different directions. Its mouth grinned impossibly wide, teeth jagged and rotten, jutting so far they pierced its own lips. Blood trickled constantly down its chin, thick and black.

When it spoke, the voice was in me. Not outside. Inside.

“Tommy Taaank…”

I staggered back, fists raised, chest heaving. My muscles flexed, my body coiled, but the air around me was thick, holding me still.

The Goblin leaned forward, bones of the throne creaking beneath its weight.

“Strong. Hench. Unbreakable.”

Its claws dragged across its chest, splitting the skin. No blood came out—only smoke, black and writhing.

“Now you’ll be mine.”

⸻

It leapt.

The Goblin’s body was small, but its mouth opened wider than its skull should allow. Its jaw snapped downward until it split. Rows of teeth, jagged and slick with slime, gaped as it lunged for me.

I tried to punch. My fist swung, but it moved too fast.

It hit my chest—not with its claws, but its whole body.

And it shoved itself into me.

My mouth tore open, wider, wider, until I felt the skin of my cheeks splitting. I tried to scream, but it was already inside, ramming down my throat.

Claws scraped my esophagus raw. My ribs cracked as it forced itself into my chest. I could feel my heart pounding, screaming, before the thing wrapped around it. My stomach heaved as its limbs burrowed, twitching through my organs. My head rang, eyes bursting with pain, as something slithered into my skull.

I collapsed into the pool of blood, convulsing, mouth frothing red.

My muscles bulged and locked. My veins turned black beneath the skin, wriggling. My chest felt like it was on fire. My eyes rolled back.

And then—

Silence.

A long, hollow silence.

Then the laughter.

“Yes. You’re mine, Tommy. Mine.”

I screamed, but my throat didn’t move.
Because it wasn’t me screaming.

It was the Goblin.

⸻

Chapter Three — The Awakening

I woke choking on my own breath.

The sheets were soaked through—sweat, piss, blood. My chest heaved, lungs clawing for air that felt too thick, too heavy, like the room had been filled with syrup. Every muscle in my body spasmed. My fists clenched hard enough that my nails cut crescent moons into my palms.

The taste of iron sat on my tongue. Rotten iron.

For a moment, I thought it had all been a nightmare. The scrapyard. The faceless man. The stairwell that breathed. The Goblin shoving itself down my throat like a parasite.

But then I looked in the mirror.

And I knew.

⸻

My reflection didn’t move right.

I leaned forward, trembling. The face in the glass leaned back slower, a fraction too late. The grin stretched wider than mine, too wide, lips splitting faintly at the corners. A thin thread of black saliva slid from the reflection’s mouth and dripped down its chin.

I raised my hand. The reflection raised its hand too—but its skin bubbled as it lifted, black veins writhing beneath like worms.

I whispered, “What the fuck are you?”

The mirror whispered back, lips moving but the sound crawling directly into my skull:
“I’m you.”

I smashed the mirror with my fist. Glass exploded, shards biting into my knuckles. Blood ran down my arm. But when I looked at the pieces scattered on the floor, each fragment still showed my face—grinning.

Grinning wider.

⸻

I stumbled back, heart hammering, head buzzing with static. My room felt smaller. The walls pressed in, the wallpaper patterns wriggling like maggots, shapes forming out of the stains—faces, whispering, mouths stretched open in silent screams.

The laughter started again.

Low. Inside my skull.

“Strong. Hench. Mine.”

I clutched my head, grinding my teeth until they cracked. “Get out of me!”

The laughter grew louder.

And then the glass on my nightstand trembled.

It rattled against the wood. It lifted, wobbling in the air. I stared, breath locked in my throat, as the water inside shivered like it was alive.

Then it dropped. Smashed into glittering shards. The water didn’t fall.

It hung.

Suspended droplets, floating in midair, dozens of them, trembling like a constellation of stars. The shards of glass rose too, hovering around me like a crown of knives.

My hand hadn’t moved.

But my mind had.

I thought of the shards flying outward, embedding themselves in the wall—
and they did.

Wood splintered. Metal cracked. My head rang with a sick thrill, a pulse of hunger that wasn’t mine.

The Goblin whispered:
“Try it on something that screams.”

⸻

I staggered to the window. Outside, the street was quiet. A man in a hoodie walked his dog beneath the streetlights, his breath fogging in the cold. So normal. So fragile.

And I thought—what if his bones snapped right now?

For a second, nothing happened.

Then the dog yelped. Its legs twisted the wrong way, bones bending inward with loud cracks. It collapsed in the snow, shrieking. The man dropped to his knees, screaming, clutching the animal.

And his spine snapped.

He froze mid-scream, body jerking, eyes bulging as his mouth hung open. He fell sideways onto the pavement, his neck bent at a broken angle, blood trickling from his nose.

I hadn’t moved a muscle.

But my mind… oh God, my mind felt stronger than my fists had ever been.

I staggered back from the window, shaking, grinning, sobbing all at once.

The Goblin’s voice purred, warm and wet inside my skull:
“Yes. More. We’re just getting started.”

⸻
Chapter Four — The Cracks in the Walls

Sleep never came again.

Every time I closed my eyes, I was back in the stairwell. The fleshy walls, the smell of curdled blood, the throne of bones. The Goblin’s grin. And the sound of it crawling inside me—its claws scraping down my throat, its laughter rattling the inside of my skull like a trapped insect.

When I did drift off, it wasn’t sleep. It was a fever.
I woke gasping, drenched in sweat, the taste of copper on my tongue, my heart thudding against my ribs like it was trying to escape.

And the walls… the walls weren’t right anymore.

⸻

At first it was subtle.

The wallpaper in my flat had always been peeling, stained by years of damp. But now the stains were changing. Faces formed in them. Pale outlines of mouths, noses, eyes—all twisted, screaming. When I blinked, they dissolved back into random blotches. But if I stared long enough, the faces began to move. Their mouths opened, silently pleading, words I could almost hear if I pressed my ear to the wall.

“Tank… let us out… Tank…”

The voices got louder at night. Muffled moans and wet chewing, like something feeding inside the plaster. One night, I pressed my palm against the wall and felt it—heat, pulse, as though veins were throbbing just beneath the wallpaper.

I ripped the paper off with shaking hands. Beneath it wasn’t plaster.

It was flesh.

Grey, clammy flesh, twitching at my touch. A patch of skin bulged, stretching outward, as if something underneath was trying to push through.

I screamed and staggered back, fists raised—
but when I blinked, it was gone. Just plaster. Just damp.

Except the blood smeared across my hand was real.

⸻

The Goblin laughed.

Sometimes it was a whisper in my ear, hot and wet like breath. Sometimes it came from behind the mirror, or from the cracks in the floorboards, or from inside my own skull, vibrating against my teeth.

“You’re seeing clearer, Tank. The walls were never walls. You’ve always been inside me.”

I punched the mirror. I punched the walls until my knuckles split. But the harder I hit, the wider I smiled. Because part of me liked it.

⸻

The hallucinations grew worse.

Walking down the street, I’d catch sight of people whose faces weren’t faces. Just skin stretched tight, featureless, like the man in the scrapyard. They’d turn their heads toward me, blank but somehow watching.

Cars passed, their headlights flickering red instead of white, illuminating the road like it was slick with blood.

Children in the park screamed as they played, but their screams didn’t stop—they looped, replaying over and over like broken recordings, until my ears rang with it.

One night, I saw my mother. Or what looked like her. She sat at my kitchen table, hands folded, smiling faintly. Her eyes dripped black tears, thick and tar-like, running down her cheeks into her lap. Her voice was calm when she said:

“Kill them all, Tommy. You’re strong enough now.”

I blinked and she was gone. But the chair was still wet with her tears.

⸻

I couldn’t tell what was real anymore.

My fists trembled constantly, aching for something to break. My muscles twitched like they weren’t mine. And in the mirror—always the mirror—I saw my reflection grinning even when I wasn’t. Sometimes it would mouth words silently, lagging behind my movements, forming phrases I couldn’t bear to read.

The Goblin whispered louder each day.

“More. We’re hungry. Feed me. FEED ME.”

I pressed my palms to my ears, screaming, “Shut the fuck up!”

The glass on my shelves rattled. Plates cracked. A chair lifted off the floor and slammed against the wall, splintering.

I didn’t touch it. I didn’t have to.

The Goblin purred:
“Beautiful. You don’t need fists anymore. Your mind is the weapon now.”

And for the first time in my life, I felt weak. Not because my muscles had failed me—
but because my own mind was no longer mine.
———

Chapter Five — Fletcher’s Last Round

The bar had always been a second home.
Fletcher ran it like a fortress. A squat, broad man with a belly built on decades of cheap lager and fried food, but fists that could still crack skulls. He’d known me since I was a kid—back when I was just Tommy, before the Tank name, before the muscle.

The smell inside was familiar: stale beer, sweat, fried onions clinging to the wood paneling. Cigarette smoke lingered even though the law had banned it years ago. The regulars sat slumped on stools, nursing pints, eyes glazed from lives they’d long since surrendered.

It should have been safe.
Normal.
But nothing was normal anymore.

The Goblin came with me.

⸻

I tried to drown it with booze.

Pint after pint, the bitter liquid sliding down my throat, filling the pit in my chest. But the voice didn’t fade. If anything, it grew clearer, sharper, buzzing beneath my skull like an insect hive.

“Look around, Tank. Look at them. All soft. All fragile. One thought, and you can fold them like paper. One thought, and the world is meat.”

I gritted my teeth, knuckles white around the glass. “Shut up.”

Fletcher leaned over the bar, frown cutting deep into his face. “What was that, lad?”

I blinked. His voice had sounded wrong—thicker, gurgling, like water bubbling through rotten pipes. His face blurred, shifting. For a second, I didn’t see Fletcher. I saw the faceless man from the scrapyard. Pale skin stretched taut, no mouth, no eyes, no nose. And yet it leaned closer, whispering directly into me:

“You brought it back with you.”

My stomach twisted. I slammed the pint glass down hard enough to crack it.

“Oi!” Fletcher barked. “Easy, Tank.”

The vision snapped. It was just him again. Red face. Thick arms. Sweat glistening on his forehead. He gave me a look that was half concern, half warning.

“Not like you, lad. You alright?”

But I wasn’t alright.
And I wasn’t lad anymore.

⸻

The Goblin coiled inside my skull, purring.
“Show him. Show them all.”

The glass in my hand lifted. I didn’t raise it. My fingers slackened, but the glass stayed afloat, trembling in the air. Fletcher’s eyes widened.

“Jesus Christ…”

The regulars muttered, chairs scraping, but they didn’t move fast enough.

I thought of the glass shattering. It did. Splinters shot outward like bullets, embedding in the walls, the tables, the soft flesh of men too slow to duck. Screams burst through the smoke.

Fletcher roared, vaulting the bar. He grabbed me by the shirt, fists like sledgehammers pounding into my ribs. Once, I would’ve gone down. Once, his fists would’ve mattered.

Now, they were nothing.

I thought of his arms snapping.

His bones cracked like kindling. Both arms bent backward at the elbows, skin splitting as white shards of bone punched through. His roar became a howl of raw agony. He fell to his knees, veins bulging purple against his forehead.

I didn’t touch him. I didn’t need to.

⸻

The Goblin was laughing, shrieking inside me, filling the room with its delight.

“MORE! Break him! Show them what Tank means!”

Fletcher tried to crawl, whimpering through clenched teeth, dragging himself with shattered arms. I watched him, grinning, sweat stinging my eyes.

I thought of him flying.

And Fletcher lifted from the floor—his body convulsing, limbs dangling, mouth wide in a scream that rattled the bottles on the shelves. He hit the ceiling with a crunch, plaster cracking, then slammed to the floor, then ceiling again, back and forth like a ragdoll.

The regulars were shrieking, scattering, but I barely saw them. Fletcher was all I saw. His eyes bulged, blood vessels bursting red into the whites, teeth snapping loose with every impact.

I thought of silence.

His jaw wrenched sideways until it split, tearing through muscle, bone grinding, tongue flopping free like a slab of meat. Blood sprayed across the floorboards.

The bar fell silent except for the gurgling sound from his ruined throat.

I let him drop.

A sack of broken bones.

⸻

The Goblin whispered through my grin:
“Beautiful, Tank. But this is just the beginning.”

I stood among the wreckage, chest heaving, sweat and blood slicking my skin. The survivors huddled against the walls, staring at me with wide, animal eyes.

I looked at them, and my mind twitched.

I wondered how many of them I could lift at once.

———

Chapter Six — The Streets Run Red

I stumbled out of the bar like a man leaving church after a sermon.
The screams still echoed behind me, muffled by the door. Fletcher’s body twitched somewhere in the dark, a sack of broken bones left to rot. My fists weren’t bloody—but my mind was dripping red.

The cold night slapped me in the face. The streets were empty at first, neon buzzing above the off-license, a light flickering in the laundrette window. Normal. Ordinary.

But my head was alive with static. The Goblin humming. The world twitching.

“Stretch your wings, Tank. They need to see what you are now.”

⸻

A couple walked past. Late twenties, holding hands, laughing too loud. Their happiness grated against my teeth.

I thought of their legs breaking.

Their knees folded inward like wet paper. They collapsed together, their screams harmonizing, hands still clutching each other as bones shredded muscle. Blood spattered the pavement as they writhed, voices shrill with disbelief.

I laughed. Out loud. The sound came from both my throat and from inside my skull, doubled, layered, monstrous.

The Goblin whispered sweetly:
“Yes. Laughter suits you.”

⸻

The noise drew others. Doors cracked open. Curtains twitched. A man stepped outside, phone raised to film.

I looked at him—and the phone burst, glass shattering, screen fusing into molten plastic that melted into his palm. He screamed, trying to peel it away, skin sloughing with it.

I thought of silence.

His mouth sealed shut. Skin knitting where lips should be. His eyes bulged as muffled shrieks rattled inside his throat, gagging on his own panic.

He dropped to his knees, clawing at his face, nails ripping flesh until his cheeks peeled open—but still no sound came.

⸻

Cars screeched. Someone shouted. The street filled with bodies, curious, afraid, phones raised. Faces staring at me like prey animals.

And I felt it.

The power. The hunger. The weight of their fragile bones, the wetness of their organs, the soft shells of their skulls—all of it under my hand though I hadn’t moved.

I stretched my mind outward.

And they lifted.

Dozens of them. Hovering a few feet off the ground, legs kicking, arms flailing, phones and bags dropping to the pavement. The air filled with screams, high and shrill, rising into a choir of terror.

Their bodies quivered in my grip. Their veins bulged. Their eyes reddened as pressure built.

“Squeeze them, Tank.”

The Goblin’s voice was velvet. Temptation itself.

And I did.

One thought—
and their heads burst.

Like ripe fruit.

Blood painted the shopfronts. Skulls split open in sprays of bone and brain. Their bodies dropped, twitching, painting the pavement red. A rain of gore fell across my face, hot and slick.

I tilted my head back and laughed as it soaked me.

⸻

Sirens wailed. Blue lights spun down the road. Police cars skidded to a stop, doors slamming open. Shouts filled the air. Guns raised.

But my grin didn’t falter.

I thought of their weapons twisting. And their rifles bent like toys, barrels snapping into useless knots. I thought of their spines bending—and they did, bodies jerking backward until their chests snapped open, ribs cracking.

The street ran red.

⸻

The Goblin’s voice roared, triumphant inside me:
“Look what you are, Tank! Not man. Not beast. God.”

I raised my arms, though I didn’t need to. The air itself was mine. The whole city felt like meat in my fist, waiting to be crushed.

And for the first time—I wanted it.

I wanted more.

——-
Chapter Seven — The Goblin’s Maze

The city was silent.

I stood in the middle of the street, drenched in blood, steam rising from the rivers of it. Sirens had cut out. Screams faded into whispers. Cars lay overturned, windows spiderwebbed, alarms stuck in throats that no longer made sound.

But silence wasn’t peace.
Silence was the Goblin breathing.

And then the world folded.

⸻

The asphalt rippled under my boots. The buildings sagged, their bricks sagging like melting wax. Neon lights bled into the air like liquid, dripping down into black puddles. My chest tightened. My breath came short and shallow.

I wasn’t in the city anymore.
I was inside the Goblin.

A corridor stretched out before me—longer than streets, darker than night, walls made of writhing flesh. The ground was slick with mucus, each step sticking like I was walking in a throat. The ceiling pulsed with veins that glowed faintly, beating in rhythm with my own heart.

And the whispers began.

Tank… Tank… Tank…

Thousands of voices, layered, shifting from high to low, male to female, child to beast. All chanting my name, all pressing into my skull.

“Where am I?” I muttered, though my voice sounded small, like a child’s.

The Goblin answered from everywhere.
“Inside. Where you always were. Welcome home.”

⸻

The corridor split into three. Each tunnel yawned wide, breathing. The left smelled like rot, the right like burning meat. The middle dripped with clear fluid that hissed on the ground like acid.

I took the middle.

The walls closed tighter as I walked. Faces bulged from them—faces I knew. Fletcher, jaw split, eyes rolled white. My mother, black tears pouring. The faceless man. Dozens more. Their mouths moved, whispering secrets I couldn’t hear.

I pressed my hands against my ears, but the sound came from inside.
Tank. You’re not man. You’re not man. You’re not man.

The faces melted into the walls, leaving only bloody smears.

⸻

At the end of the tunnel was a mirror.

It stood upright in the flesh, tall and clean, shining in the blackness. I staggered forward, chest heaving, and stared.

The reflection wasn’t me.

It was taller, leaner. My muscles gone, my skin green-black, stretched taut. My eyes glowed yellow, wide and mad. My grin split ear to ear, teeth jagged and too many. Veins writhed under my skin like worms.

And when I raised my hand—the reflection didn’t mimic me.
It beckoned.

“Come inside,” it whispered. But its lips didn’t move. The words crawled straight into my skull.

I staggered back. “No.”

The Goblin laughed, booming through the walls.
“You already have.”

The mirror shattered.

And I fell through.

⸻

Darkness swallowed me. I landed hard—on bone. The floor was a graveyard. Skulls cracked under my boots, ribs snapped like twigs. Mountains of bones stretched in every direction, piled high, shifting as though the dead still moved inside them.

On the throne of those bones sat the Goblin.

This time, I saw it clear.

A crooked, hunched thing with arms too long, nails black and dripping. Its head was swollen, veins crawling over its bald scalp, mouth splitting too wide, filled with jagged teeth. Its eyes burned yellow, holes into forever.

And its voice was silk and rot:
“Strong Tank. Hench Tank. My Tank.”

My knees buckled. My body wanted to bow.

But my mouth roared instead: “GET OUT OF ME!”

The Goblin laughed, teeth clicking like knives.
“Out? I was never out. You were born hollow. I filled you. I am you.”

The bone floor shifted. Skeletons rose around me, their jaws clacking, eye sockets burning faintly with yellow light. Hundreds of them.

I clenched my fists. My head pulsed.

And the skeletons bowed.

Every single one.

The Goblin leaned forward, grin dripping black saliva.
“See? They know their king. My Tank. Our world begins now.”

⸻

The darkness closed tighter. My chest heaved. The bones clattered in endless applause. And deep inside me, I felt it—
not just power, but acceptance.

I wasn’t fighting the Goblin anymore.
I was becoming it.

——-

Chapter Eight — Blood on the Pavement

I woke gasping.

Concrete against my cheek. The smell of iron thick in my throat. Sirens distant, like they were drowning under water.

For a second, I thought it had been a dream. The corridors of flesh, the mirror, the Goblin’s throne—it couldn’t have been real. Just a nightmare in my head.

Then I pushed myself up.
And saw the street.

⸻

Bodies everywhere.

Not just bodies—pieces.
Ripped torsos spilling their contents onto the pavement. Heads half-crushed, jaws locked in screams that never finished. Cars smashed into buildings, doors ripped from hinges, lampposts twisted like corkscrews.

And the smell. God, the smell. Like a slaughterhouse set on fire.

I staggered to my feet, boots slipping in blood. The sound came next—flies buzzing, wet dripping, a distant wail that might’ve been human or might’ve been something else.

I turned.

And there was Fletcher.

Or what was left of him. His body was split in half across the road, ribs sticking out like jagged teeth, eyes still wide. His arms bent the wrong way. His jaw still hanging by threads.

“No…” My voice cracked, but the word was useless. A denial that meant nothing.

Because I remembered.

I had done this.

⸻

The Goblin purred inside my skull.
“Don’t lie to yourself, Tank. You loved it.”

My chest heaved. My hands shook. “No, no, I—I lost control.”

The laughter answered. A wet, hissing noise, like maggots writhing in a carcass.
“Control is for the weak. You are beyond it. You are pure will. Pure hunger.”

I staggered through the carnage. My boots left red prints, every step squelching. A woman’s body twitched at my feet, her head gone but her legs kicking reflexively. I stumbled back, bile rising, but the Goblin purred again.

“Don’t fear it, Tank. This is your art. Your canvas. Look how beautiful the world is when it bleeds for you.”

⸻

Sirens grew closer now. Flashing blue lights flickered against the walls. A helicopter’s hum vibrated above.

Police cars screeched into view. Soldiers. Not just cops this time—riot shields, body armor, rifles raised.

They shouted, voices overlapping:
“On the ground!”
“Hands where we can see them!”
“NOW!”

But all I heard was the Goblin.
“Show them. Show them you’re not flesh. Show them you’re MIND.”

My head throbbed. The air quivered. The guns in their hands rattled, tore free, bent into spirals. Panic erupted in their formation. Shouts turned to screams.

And then the helicopter dipped.

I didn’t even think about it. I just looked at it, hovering above, lights glaring down, blades thundering. My blood sang with power.

And the helicopter folded in half mid-air.

It spun, shrieked, blades snapping off, bodies flailing inside. Then it came down. A roaring meteor of fire and metal that slammed into the road, swallowing cops and civilians alike in a bloom of flame.

The blast hurled me backward into a wall. Heat blistered my skin. Screams filled the night.

The Goblin shrieked with laughter inside my head:
“YES! Now they see! Now they kneel!”

⸻

I rose from the rubble. My body steaming, skin blistered but healing, stronger, heavier.

The street burned around me. Soldiers staggered, coughing, bleeding, some trying to crawl, others already motionless.

And I felt it.

Not guilt.
Not fear.

Satisfaction.

The Goblin whispered like a lover, soft and sweet:
“Told you, Tank. You were never theirs. You were always mine.”

And for the first time—I didn’t argue.



Pt.2 soon (tank out)
