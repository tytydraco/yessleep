This story encompasses my full experiences from the perspective of a 13 year old as I have recently remembered them. This is the first of many parts. this one is aptly titled: “blotches”.

 It was a warm summer day, sunlight glistening over the freshly cut grass, birds singing and squirrels dancing about. All of them could be seen enjoying the weather without a care of the future. It was around 11:00 when I finally got the motivation to get out of bed, and get ready for my day of usual laziness and boredom. The day was no different than any other, or so I thought… 


I walked downstairs, said hi to my mom. She was off from work on that Saturday so we had a chance to talk. She explained that she is going to the city at around 12:00 to run some errands, and that she wants me to come too. she knew I loved seeing all the cars and people and thought it would be a fun bonding experience of sorts. but little did she know, the events that would occur that day would end up leading  me to horrors beyond comprehension…

The drive to the city was relatively uneventful, barring the odd driving habits of the less civilized non city “people”. 

The drive concluded with us pulling in front of a small apartment complex. She then walked out of the car and around to my window  and told me to stay in the car and to not open the doors under any circumstances. I could tell she was a bit agitated by the way she spoke those last words but I took no heed to what she was saying. I was just happy to be out of the house and finally where I belong. Out in the real world. Away from the boredom of school and the brainless household tasks I had to perform. 

The time as she was gone seemed to stretch an uncomfortable period of time, a few minutes turned into thirty and my hope was draining of whether she would ever come back. and then I saw something, in the corner of my eye through the rear view mirror. Something so strange yet so normal. Something so threatening but so innocent. Such a strange feeling has not possessed me since then. What I saw in the mirror which was gazing directly at me from about 30 yards away was a man. Or, what I then perceived to be a man. 

He was slowly approaching the vehicle. Remembering my mother’s  words I double and triple check the doors of the vehicle. All locked. But then, It hit me, it being a leaf. It had blown through the window of our car. That’s when it struck me that I forgot to raise the windows up. I frantically fiddled  with the buttons and switches in attempt to raise them. The man still approaching around 15 yards now. As I can now see more details of the face of the man moving slowly towards our car, I was left with more questions than answers. 

I continued trying to close the windows now with more ferocity from the fear of the man who had looked so polarizing. as the man drew within 5 yards of the car I finally heard the door of the apartment building. My mother was back. But what about the man? I peered wearily back through the rear view mirror, and there was nothing. No strange man, no blank stare. Absolutely nothing. She asked me if I felt well and  she remarked something about me looking white. I lied, saying I felt fine. I then start to notice the reason that my mother had been in there for so long. 

She had a bag in her arms. I was confused as she handed me the bag. As I was opening it there was a knock on my window. My soul left my body. as I quickly turned to see that it was, I was yet again vexed by what I saw. There was nothing, no one. Nothing had knocked on the door. I looked over to my mom. She had a similar expression to mine. I asked her if she heard it. She asked me  with confusion what she was supposed to have heard. 
I stared blankly at her. I swear I heard a knock. she looked back at my expression in a confused parent way. 

Without exchanging another word we began to make our way back home. 

It’s not until we were home that I opened the bag. I opened the bag revealing an envelope. 
 It was addressed to me. It was from my  father who I hadn’t  seen in years. 

Inside of the weathered envelope was an ink blotch. Similar to those used by old timey therapists, except this one had extreme detail. It looked like a man. Except it looked exactly like the strange man who I had seen earlier approaching my car. Their similarities were almost uncanny. 
I was going to ask my mom about this later on that night but I forgot she had the early shift the next day  and by the time I went to ask her she was already asleep. 

So I went to bed and decided to ask her later in the week so as to not bother her with even more stress. 


This concludes part 1 :)
