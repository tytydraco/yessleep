 

**“If you are inside your home with the lights out, do not look outside, turn on your lights before looking out any window, do not leave your home, lock all doors and windows.” After I heard the announcement on the tv I ran to every window and door in my house in locked it, it went by so fast that it all felt like a blur, luckily I don't have very many family in the area so I will be alone for a while,  fortunately I have enough food to last for a while, what I'm scared of is I know i will eventually have to leave but until then I don't know what I'm going to do. The announcement didn't say very much. I want answers but I'm scared to know the truth, for right now I'm going to research what's going on.**  


**I was able to talk to my parents who are in the next city over to see what was happening and they said “we don't know what's going on but just stay inside and don't go out and we will text as soon as we find out more” I was able to make my way out to the living room i felt safe for now and i also wanted to see if the tv had changed, and it said something new it said “ if you see a person who looks identical to you run away and hide” what does this mean, i don't know, i feel as if this isn't real maybe it's just a prank or someone hacked into the news channels and set this up but whatever it is this isn't funny. Nothing has happened yet though, so it might be ok if i just go to sleep right? There's nothing online and my parents haven't texted me yet so I should be ok, maybe it is just a prank.**

**I hear something very faint. I don't know what it is, it might be knocking. I'm just going to assume that it might be the flag on my porch because sometimes when the wind picks up it slams against the wood so it must be nothing, right? My phone buzzed and it was a text from my sister, she said...**

**“Hey, have you heard from mom and dad.”** 

**“Hello?”**

**Missed call from sister.** 

**Missed call from sister.** 

**Missed call from sister.** 

**“Pls answer the phone I'm scared, and no one is answering.”**

**And that was it I called her back and nothing I text her multiple times and still nothing. I'm going to go outside. I need to know what happened to my sister, but the announcement said not to go outside, and I haven't heard anything so what should I do? Maybe I'll just take a peek out of the window and see what's out there, so I know if it's safe to go.**

**Someone's there, right there in front of my kitchen window standing still, its human but it's not I can't say why but somethings off about it, and it doesn't quite look right, like it's not a real person I was going to go outside and see who it was when I remembered the announcement “if you see a person who looks identical to you run away and hide."**
