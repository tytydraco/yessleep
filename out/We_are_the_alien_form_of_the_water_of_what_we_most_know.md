*I encore the outro:*

*The men on board, of land, finally say that it is all right; everything put back to place.* 

*What are they talking about?*

*It was always symmetrical.* 

  


I pry open the rivets of the held, hefty suit forward. The thing looks so cumbersome to even hold upon all of my weight, but its iron pound is the only object that could keep a creature of the land alive down in the depths;

They said thirty-three-thousand leagues. 

Has to be a mistake, has to be three. 

This mission was hardly even briefed to me. 

Said only to stay down there for thirty minutes. 

But the oxygen tank in this lofty thing is for only fifteen. 

The suit is now fully unfastened, bulbous, orbital glare staring back, window to the soulless darkness within, my reflection staring solemnly and overly pale. 

What am I getting myself into? 

  


*Hell arrives at every rebound of the second, limbo not enough to describe the lack of lucidity of time here. Darkness, cold, true time in the nothing. I am dead. I am life.* 

  


It is lonely in the dark, creatures befallen to other corners of the cold. Strange, how all the light of this place is inherently dangerous. No longer does the universe eye life down here, blindspot of the circadian rhythm, luminance hiding within the machinations of the creatures’ design only, borrowed strata of the deepest of the global matter. 

Roaming slowly, dark. 

Bed of an empty algae grass, all of its molecules concepting of the dark as I cannot feel but my own foggy breath and yet I know it’s all there, somehow, I know that no matter how far I walk upon this dark I find only the stark reminder that I stride lonesome and breathe for a mere nine minutes further. 

twenty-four minutes? 

  


*I see it, the other thing of the abyss to the sky: landform, reciprocal xeno to the ground so that he befalls himself to the void where once all of him arrived.* 

*I stare at I.* 

  


Darkness, cold, enveloped all of my thoughts so that the iron will of my testimony to the worldly is exempt. Everywhere, anywhere, anytime. 

A flash of light. 

Everywhere, anywhere, no time. 

The sun is infront of me, vulgar perdition, blessed enchantment, warmth founded in cold I see a luminary of time against the luminary void it is so bright and I see null for the pendulum slides at both sloped angles to the euclidean precedent. 

All of time is before me, it always was, it is so present, I see it in the dark I just never knew. 

The light starts to dissipate as quickly as its first spread of its phoenix recurrence, rebounding particles seeping into the bubbling of the water’s striking currents, stretching itself thinly so that I see the path infront of me. 

And so that I see the suit of iron. 

The chimera reflects inside that hefty weight. 

My one reflection, its hollowed out eyes staring back so that I am alive in its corpse and it stares with no eyes for it has stolen mine I see my life all in that void. 

I stare at I.

  


*I am God: We are one.* 

  


I stare at the scientist with my clumsy feeling sight, clamoring standstill as I feel myself teetering at my own enlarged weight. 

I try to keep in my nervous chuckling, staving off the soon starvation of oxygen I will feel down there. 

“We’ll drop you down and pull you back in less than forty-two. 

42

*42*

*42 hates and 42 loves and 42 deaths and 42 lives and 42 gods and 42 humans and 42 thoughts and 42 kings and 42 numbers and 42 realities and 42 saints and 42 people and 42 demons and 42 resurrected saints and 42 laws and 42 truths and 42 minds and 42 objects and 42 edifices and 42 pigments of grass and 42 celestials and 42 creators and 42 false prophets and 42 liars and 42 doctrines of truth and 42 universes and 42 cyclone materials and 42 existences and 42 voids and 42 creations and 42 eyes and 42 thieves and 42 nothings and 42 walls and 42 freedoms and 42 creatures and 42 systems and 42 artworks and 42 false measurements and 42 seconds to survival and 42 borrowed seconds for every second.*
