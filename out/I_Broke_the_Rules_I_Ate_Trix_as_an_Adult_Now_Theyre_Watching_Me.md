Look, I know this sounds silly.

I know the slogan. Everyone does. “Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids!” It’s a jingle burned into our brains from Saturday morning cartoons and stale childhood memories. I used to laugh at it. I thought it was just a marketing gimmick. A colorful, harmless bit of nostalgia.

But I broke the rules.

And I think something knows.

I'm 34. Live alone. No kids, no spouse, no pets — just a quiet apartment, a desk job, and the occasional late-night TV binge to keep me sane.

Last week, I was in the cereal aisle, tired from work and half-daydreaming. I normally go for Grape-Nuts or something equally sad, but then I saw them.

Trix.

Bright, obnoxious colors. That grinning cartoon rabbit holding a bowl like it contained the meaning of life.

I thought, What the heck? Let’s chase some nostalgia. So I bought a box.

That was mistake number one.

I didn't eat them that night. I didn’t even open the box until the next morning. It was one of those dead-silent Saturdays — gray light pouring in through the blinds, no sounds except the fridge humming and the occasional creak of old pipes.

I poured a bowl. They smelled sweet. Artificial. Like childhood and cavities.

The first bite was… fine. Nothing special. A little stale. But as I chewed, I swear the taste changed. Like it shifted into something smoother, richer. The sweetness deepened. It was almost fruity but not any fruit I could name. I felt oddly calm.

Then I looked up.

And the rabbit was watching me.

Not on the box — in the reflection.

The spoon was metal, slightly warped. I looked into the curve of it out of habit. And there, distorted in the shine, was a face.

Two long ears. Wide, expressive eyes. A calm, polite smile.

It blinked.

I dropped the spoon. Milk sloshed onto the table.

I turned around — nothing there. Just my quiet apartment, the fan ticking overhead, the blinds gently swaying.

I told myself it was a trick of the light. Maybe a smudge on the spoon. But something in me knew. The slogan. The warning.

“Trix are for kids.”

That night, I heard scratching.

Soft, rhythmic. Like claws against drywall.

It started in the kitchen and slowly moved closer. I sat on my bed, covers pulled up like I was six years old again. It stopped right outside my door.

Then I heard him.

A voice. Thin. Cheerful in the way old cartoons sound cheerful until you listen too long.

“You’re too old,” it whispered.

“You’re too old,” again.

Over and over.

I stayed like that until sunrise.

When I opened the door, three Trix pieces were sitting on the hallway floor — perfectly round, in red, green, and purple. No box nearby. Just the cereal.

Arranged like a warning.

I threw the rest of the box out. I poured bleach on it first, like a lunatic, then stuffed it in a trash bag and took it to the dumpster two blocks down. I didn’t want it anywhere near me.

But it didn’t help.

The next morning, the box was back on my kitchen table.

Open.

And empty.

I tried staying with a friend. I told him someone might be stalking me, maybe breaking into my apartment. I left out the cereal part. He said I could crash on his couch.

That night, I woke up to the sound of laughing.

From the hallway.

That same cartoon voice, giggling and whispering.

“Silly rabbit… silly rabbit… kids only…”

I ran to the hallway, but it was empty.

Except for another bowl of Trix.

Full.

Waiting.

I haven’t slept in three days. At first, I thought I was imagining things — maybe just tired. My ears felt warm all the time. Sensitive to sound. Like I could hear the neighbors two floors up dragging a chair. I heard a bird sneeze outside. I heard a dog blink.

I went to the mirror and pulled my hair back.

The tips of my ears are stretching.

Just a little. 

My front teeth have started aching.

I know he's waiting for me. He keeps whispering as I sleep, 

“Silly raaaaabit
Silly raaaaaabit
Trix are for kids”

So please. If you’re reading this:

Don’t eat the Trix.

Not if you’re grown.

Not if you’re alone.

And never, ever assume it’s just a cartoon.🐇
