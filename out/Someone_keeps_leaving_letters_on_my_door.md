I’ve been living in this house pretty much all my life, the only time I didn’t was the short period that I went to college. I grew up in the house and when my parents died 10 years ago they left the house for me to inherit.



It was strange at first, walking past all their furniture that they would never use again, and if I am being honest it most likely took me more than it should to get rid of some of the stuff.



But time marches on as they say, I got a boyfriend, I then got married to said boyfriend and we moved in together, not exactly in that order but you know what I mean.



We have been living in this house together for about 3 years now as a rough estimate, but then around 2 months ago something strange started to happen.



I came home from work at my usual time and saw a white piece of paper taped to our front door, curious I of course took it down to see what it was, after all it had to be urgent, anything that wasn’t would be put in the mailbox right?



I opened the letter up to see the very well made handwritten letter, or I guess in this instance a note was more appropriate.“Welcome to the neighborhood. ”That was all it said, confused. I turned the piece of paper around to see if there was anything else on it but no, that was all. With the letter still in hand I walked into the house and called out “Hey Honey? Anyone come by today?”



My husband works from home, so if some new neighbors we had somehow missed wanted our attention he would have surely heard them knock on the door.



“No, Why? What’s up?” Came from the kitchen, and after getting out of my shoes I went in, placing a kiss on his cheek and waving the letter gently. “This was taped to our front door, just wanted to know if you had seen anything.”



He took the letter from my hand and read it, turning it over in his hand like I had and simply shook his head.



“No idea, must be a mistake, I don’t think it was meant for us.”



Which I took as a good enough explanation, after all there wasn’t much else to it and the whole thing kind of left my mind after that.



Then 3 days later, same scenario, I come home from work, letter taped to the door, this time an eviction notice.



Even more strange as I on paper legally own the house, once more, confused I step into my home and put the letter out in front of my husband who stares at it for a few seconds and then up at me.



“What’s this?” He asks confused as he picks it up and begins reading through it, brow furrowed.



“Tapped to our door, doubt that it’s meant for us but we should still call the number just to make sure we don’t run into some legal trouble or something.” My tone was clearly tired, it had already not been a great day at work and this was the last thing I wanted to spend my off time doing.



My Husband sucked his teeth and nodded softly, “yeah, that’s a good idea, I can take care of it if you want, trade you for cooking.”



And that was an offer I was more than happy to take.



It didn’t take too long, about 40 minutes later his head popped into the kitchen with a smile “it’s taken care of, they say it’s most likely an error on their part as this hasn’t been a rental property in 70 plus years, so we don’t need to worry.”



And so I didn’t, once more the letters on my door were out of my mind.



Four days pass and as I pull into my driveway I can’t help but let out an exhausted sigh at the white square hanging on my door, at this point it was starting to become annoying.



I was starting to suspect that someone was treating our front door as a junk mail deposit.



Either way, I pulled the letter down and opened it up.



It was a written confession, a detailed handwritten letter of love designated to a man named Henry. My brow furrowed, neither me nor my husband were named that, and I knew for a fact that none of my neighbors were named that.



But the letter seemed too detailed to end up here on accident, this was clearly from a person who knew this man named Henry intimately, someone who had spent a lot of time with them and would surely know this wasn’t their address right? And it couldn’t be a mail mix up since it was taped to our door directly.



I clicked my tongue lightly as I thought, deciding in the end to just crumple the piece of paper up and throw it out, I was kind of over the whole messages on my door bit and if I am being completely honest work was draining me so much that I wasn’t much in the mood for finding whoever this Henry was.



I knew in my heart that if I brought this letter to my husband he would go through hell to find the right owner, he can’t help it as a hopeless romantic, I just didn’t have the energy, maybe we would have figured out things earlier if I had just let him see it.



The letters just kept happening, every two to four days a new one would be taped to our front door. Most of the handwritten, talking about everything from the weather to a bird they saw, a few of the notes being official looking mail, another eviction notice, something about registering to vote, one for a nearby church.



But these were all in between then handwritten ones, and at some point I stopped really reading them, I just pulled down the note and threw it out, nothing interesting was ever on it and it wasn’t enough of a problem that I cared to catch whoever it was in the act.The few times I did glance at the letters the handwriting seemed to get more and more shaky, messy, a small part of me wished I could send a letter back to whoever was doing it. My first guess was some poor old woman just looking for friends but I never made much of an effort.



It’s why I didn’t take much notice when I saw the white square on our front door, at least not till I got closer to it.



The rest of the letters had been taped delicately to the front of my door but this one had a nail driven through it, someone had nailed into our front door.



I grabbed the letter and opened the door “Why didn’t you call me or something?”



I yelled into the house as I angrily removed my shoes and stomped into the living room where my husband sat confused with his phone in hand. “About… what?” He asked with a tone that matched his facial expression.



I waved the letter annoyed in the air “Someone nailed this to our front door, there is no way you didn’t hear that!”



At that my husband practically shot up from his seat and with fast steps moved to the front door, opened it and had a look at the slightly rusty nail that had been driven into the middle of it.



“what the fuck?” He said with furrowed brows, eyes drifting over to me.



My facial expression changed, pausing, confused like his as I stared down at the letter, I opened it up, hands slightly shaky at this point as I stared at the words within, my mouth feeling dry at the handwritten note.



“You corrupted my Henry”



The letters were shaky, written as if someone who was drunk, and tapped to the inside of the letter were two photos, both of me and my husband, one in the kitchen and the second cuddling on the couch.

  


My husband could clearly see the worry on my face and reached out to take the letter from my hand, as he stared at it I saw his face go pale and he bit his lower lip like he only does when stressed. I swallowed, stared at him, waited for something, anything.



After what felt like a million years he finally looked up at me, his eyes were unfocused, he looked as if he was staring right past me.



“Daniel?” He said, his voice shaky, unsure.



I nodded, he needed to know that I was listening as I stared at him wide eyed.



“I need you to understand that I love you, I love you with all of my heart, do you know that?”Once more I nodded, I knew that, I knew that better than anyone.



“Good, Listen to me, I need you to drive out of town, Throw your phone out of the window somewhere along the way, I need you to withdraw as much money as you can, and I need you to check into the Saltwater Motel alright? Ask for room 203. ”I opened my mouth to say something but before I could even get my words out he stopped me, putting his hand over my mouth as he stared into my eyes with a more intense gaze than he had ever had.



“Please, no questions, I will come find you, I promise, please? For me?”



I swallowed, and then nodded, I didn’t know what else to do.



He gave me a kiss on the forehead and I left, I got in my car and about 6 hours later I checked into the Saltwater Motel room 203.



The only thing I didn’t do was get rid of my phone, I can’t, I need to know that he can call me, that if something happens he can get a hold of me, I hope he knows that I love him too.



Maybe that’s why I kept it, so I could write this, if I never see him again, if something happens to either of us I hope at least this is enough for someone to know that I love him too.
