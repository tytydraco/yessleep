*“A curtain of night under a bejeweled sky.”*

In a flash, I remembered Lucy was under the same sky. But not with me.

She was with Barb.

I wrenched my phone out of my pocket; the heavens tinting the screen ghostly, neon colors as I saw what I ignored while searching for *The Last Great Seer.*

4 missed calls from Lucy, followed by a text message and a picture.

*“Barb gathered nearly everyone at the chapel, except Ari. Practically everyone in town was tormented by the prophecy when they were young. They’re all acting crazy. What they’re talking about doing is insane. Come ASAP and bring Shep.”*

Although none of us are religious, we use an abandoned Pentecostal church as our town hall. It’s the biggest communal space we have.

The picture was hazy and out of focus, which I took to mean that Lucy had taken it in secret. There was a white board next to the pulpit, which was covered in things like:

***-Excavate its jades from their hallowed sockets, and their visions of Apocalypse will cease. ?Remove eyes. (5 Tally marks next to it)***

***-Excise the bull’s manhood, and Apocalypse will fall. ?Castration (2 Tally marks)***

***-Flay its carapace, and Apocalypse will be exposed. ?Skinning (4 Tally marks)***

The list went on and on.

Standing at the pulpit, I could clearly see Barb, eyes burning with frenzy, hands gesturing wildly toward the pews.

\------------

*“Barbara…you need to stand down,”* Shep growled, his words echoing up into the rafters of the vast cathedral.

Hundreds of bodies turned in the pews to face the sheriff as he and I entered. There had been lively chatter when we first walked in, with the entire town debating the most appropriate violence to inflict on Ari, our green-eyed harbinger. Now, there was only silence. A thick, suffocating quiet, made dense by the thousands of words that lingered impatiently on people’s tongues but remained unsaid.

I peered around from behind Shepard, trying to locate my wife in the frozen mob. As my eyes moved up the length of the church, I eventually found her. Ahead of the pews, there was a raised area with a pulpit and an altar. A rusty pipe organ mounted against the back wall framed the stage, with its dilapidated metal cylinders curving around the pulpit like the tendrils of a kraken twisting around the hull of a ship.

Lucy was sitting on the bench in front of the organ, deeply sequestered behind rows of townspeople and Barbara, who stood in front of the pulpit, head shaking with divine indignation like a magistrate looking upon a convicted witch at Salem.

*“Shepard, what right do you have to overthrow the will of the people? You work for us, not the other way around,”* she boomed from the safety of her podium.

Murmurs of agreement radiated throughout the crowd. Barb had clearly persuaded them, but they hadn’t completely succumbed to frenzy.

Not yet, at least.

*“Open your eyes, sheriff. That whale died on our shore. The birds aren’t flying. The town lacks electricity, and a strange light pervades the sky. All on the same day, all after Ari’s arrival. Do you think we enjoy convening by candlelight? Do you truly believe our pain had no purpose?”*

To my astonishment, I found myself agreeing with Barb. A peculiar relief poured over me as I listened. Involuntarily, I swallowed and nodded my head.

Shep turned and shot me a look of pure disgust, having sensed my wavering allegiance. As much as I treasured his respect, and as much as I knew what we were considering was morally unconscionable, I couldn’t help but find comfort in Barb’s narrative. We had all suffered at the feet of this prophecy, and we had endured that suffering alone - until today. The warmth that came from a room full of people that understood felt like morphine in my blood.

*“Alright folks, let make this all abundantly clear for you.”*

The sheriff walked forward onto the carpeted aisle as he spoke, leaving me and my smoldering collusion behind.

*“I do not deny your pain. Nor am I saying that I understand what’s happening here today. I don’t think anyone has a good explanation for what all of that is.”*

He beckoned out one of the cathedral’s tall windows at the blankets of blue-green light swimming ominously through the night sky. But there was something else on the glass that he didn’t call our attention to. Something that caused the hairs on the nape of my neck to stand on end.

Tiny beads of dripping liquid, absorbing and refracting the cosmic light as they painted long lines down the window. Every tempest starts as a drizzle of rain.

I started pacing forward to warn Shep, knowing what could be next to follow.

*“I wish I understood your pain, and I wish I understood what you experienced, truly, I do,”* he continued.

*“But here’s something I do understand. It’s simple, and it’s universally applicable: ‘Thou shalt not kill’. The activities y’all have listed up on that whiteboard - castration, skinning, hobbling, amputating, blinding - they’ll kill that poor man. And he won’t pass on quietly, neither. So, ask yourselves: something is demanding y’all do those things to Ari, but is it worth giving up your humanity to do it? I know the prophecy says a lake of fire will eat the world if you don’t hurt him, but I mean, if you become demons to save us, did you really avoid creating hell?”*

When I reached him, he was nearly at the pulpit, looking up to meet Barb’s burning gaze. Wind whipped against the church’s rickety woodwork, causing the walls to seemingly buckle and expand with the current. Hefty droplets of rainfall crashed against the rooftop like the hooves of a stampede. I grabbed his forearm and pulled myself up to my tiptoes so my whispers could meet his ear.

*“I know you don’t believe this is happening, but we need to go. The next part of the prophecy is ‘the death of a king amidst a sweeping Tempest’. We haven’t had a mayor in over a decade, so you’re the closest thing this town has to a king.”*

Barb’s voice cut through the sounds of the storm like a crack of thunder.

*“Meghan! Are you conspiring with the Sheriff? Are the both of you planning on standing in the way of what needs to be done?”*

People rose from the pews, staring daggers into Shep and I. At first, it was just a handful. But the more venom Barb spewed, the more of our neighbors answered her call.

*“They have chosen us! The universe, in its infinite wisdom, has selected us to prevent Apocalypse. Would you really deprive of us of our destiny and damn the world to conflagration, all just to protect a man who you hardly even know? An outsider, no less?”*

A crowd gathered in the aisle, preventing our only escape route. I swung my head from side to side, looking for an opening, a hole in the mob that Shep and I might be able to squeeze through, but I found nothing.

With the people closing in on us, I turned to face the sheriff, who had become eerily motionless in the preceding few seconds. When I saw his expression, my heart transformed from meat into lead and it plummeted through the bottom of my chest.

His eyes were empty and glazed over, like marbles painted to resemble human eyes. The left half of his face sagged unnaturally downward, making it look like those features were being subjected to a different, more potent force of gravity than his right. A stream of dribble fell from the corner of his mouth and down his chin, dripping on to my shirt collar as I stood paralyzed in front of him.

Before anyone actually reached us, Shepard crumpled to the floor like a discarded marionette, limp and lifeless. The crowd stopped moving, and the room once again became filled with that thick silence.

I followed him to the floor, kneeling over him with hot tears welling up in my eyes.

*“Shep - Shep…oh God…oh God.”*

No matter how much I called out to him, no matter how much I shook him, Shep didn’t wake up. He’d never wake up again, actually.

My eyes darted around the room, but no one was dialing 9-1-1.

*“Phones still work, right?!”* I screamed in disbelief.

*“What the fuck are you all waiting for? He’s having a stroke?!”* I bellowed through my sobs.

No one moved an inch.

*“Fuck all of you, fuck all of you right to hell.”*

My hand moved to pull my cellphone from my back pocket, but somebody caught my wrist from behind and held it tightly in the air.

I assumed it was Barb, so I balled my other hand into a sturdy fist and swung it towards my captor, but it never made contact. Shock and despair caused the punch to dissolve mid-flight.

Lucy was the one who was holding me back.

“*Good job, sweetheart.”* Barb cooed from behind the pulpit.

Still on the floor of the cathedral next to the dying man, my breathing became ragged and my muscles turned into puddy. Flickering candlelight danced over Lucy’s face as I looked into it for answers. Resignation and sorrow marked her expression, but it was clear that she acted calmly and deliberately. Apparently, my wife was more than willing to let Shep perish in an undignified heap on the ground with the whole town watching, a fate that mirrored the stranded leviathan in a way that twisted my stomach into knots.

*“I’m…”* is the only word Lucy vocalized before Barb started delivering commands.

*“Juan, gather the rope from your car so we can restrain Meghan. Trisha, I want you to take Jeremy, Phil, and Weijen out to the 23rd. Ari’s house is the blue ranchero on the corner. Avery, Tom, Martha - could you kindly pull the sheriff’s body out back? The church has a freezer, but there’s still no electricity. We can’t preserve him. Best we can do is an impromptu burial.”*

She then stepped forward from the pulpit slightly to crane her neck around the whiteboard.

*“Looks like the majority of us recall that last instruction to be* ***excavate its jades from their hallowed sockets, and their visions of Apocalypse will cease,*** *so I guess we’ll start there.”*

\-----------

Once the mob tied me to a folding chair, they at least had the decency to place me next to Lucy, up on the stage by the pipe organ. I think they viewed it as decency, at least. In reality, I would have preferred being tossed into the wet dirt next to a possibly still alive Shepard.

Her betrayal had cut so deep.

She tried to justify her actions, but I wasn’t having any of it. This town and its people were Shep’s life, and this is how they chose to repay him. He was there when our basement flooded, lugging water logged furniture onto our lawn in the summer heat. When Lucy’s parents died in a car crash, he sat at our kitchen table and drank coffee with us every day for a month, listening intently and giving advice where he could. When we finally thought IVF worked, only to have it end in a miscarriage, Shep was there to give me a shoulder to cry on. Lucy, perpetually avoidant of discomfort, was off drinking by herself somewhere farther into the mainland.

That was just *our* lives, though. Every person in that church probably had their own collection of stories, iterating Shepard’s wisdom, kindness, and philanthropy. And every single person in that church let him expire on the floor like a mutt. It felt unbelievable, but that was actually the better of the two potential outcomes, too. No one took his pulse as they carried him out of the cathedral, despite my pleas. He might not have died on the church floor. Instead, Shep may have died in a cold pit, mud and soil filling his lungs as he stared helplessly up into the faces of his neighbors as they proceeded to bury him alive.

From their perspective, feeling for a heartbeat was a gamble that had no upside. Barb wanted him in the ground, so he was going into that hole, dead or alive. Why risk confirming that they were sentencing the man to a premature burial?

Dwelling on it made me physically sick.

When I saw a group of them re-entering the church with Ari, his face black and blue from a beating, my anguish turned into something more useful; seething rage.

*“****Does any of this even make any goddamned sense****?”* I screamed, cheeks and chest flushed bright red.

My outburst was abrupt and unexpected. Startled, a few people nearly jumped out of their own skin. Lucy included.

*“I get the insanity of us all being tormented by the prophecy, but I mean, think about it: Ari’s been here for over a week. Its not like everything happened the moment he stepped foot in town. We live on the coast. We’ve had beached whales before, remember?*

*“We’re going to torture and kill a man over a beached whale, a few dumb birds, and some faulty wiring?”*

*“And* ***why*** *would there be these differences in the prophetic instructions? I counted sixteen separate lines listed on that white board. Does* ***anyone*** *have a good way to explain that? For fuck’s sake, what would be the point?”*

Barb turned to face me, and I swear I saw her chuckle. I think she tried to get a word in edge-wise, but that goddamned chuckle was like throwing a cannister of gasoline into a bonfire.

*“****And Shepard! Fucking Shepard****. He was the sheriff, you fucking lunatics. He wasn’t a king. They aren’t even close to the same position! Barb is forcing a square peg through a circular hole, but you all are so brainwashed that you’re not even thinking about it!”*

*“This isn’t some divine responsibility. This isn’t the universe asking us to be brave in the face of Apocalypse. No, this is…this is something else.”*

Unfortunately, I felt myself losing steam. They had just brought Ari onto the stage. Seeing his wild, fearful eyes and his bloody, swollen mouth up close was diluting my focus.

*“If…if someone can just look at my phone, I have proof. There was…there was a burn…some type of burn on the whale…I mean the Leviathan. There’s…something going on that we don’t completely understand. Shep…oh God, Shep…he drove me over to the boardwalk. We…we saw The Last Great Seer. There was a plug in the back…I think…I think that it could be used like a telephone…”*

Juan, a burly Dominican man who ran the local deli, forcefully pushed the green-eyed harbinger into a folding chair so he was facing me, only a few feet away. Ari peered up at his captor, mumbling pleas of mercy through intermittent sobs. Absentmindedly, the outsider tried to meet Juan’s gaze by swiveling his torso, rather than remaining still as instructed. Ari wasn’t trying to escape, that much was clear. He was trying to make an appeal to his humanity by looking into his eyes.

A set of knuckles careened into his jaw in response to that appeal, releasing the sickening type of crunch that accompanies bone crushing bone.

The young man toppled from the folding chair onto the floor. I watched in horror as Juan, Barb and a few others circled around him like carrion birds flying above fresh road kill. Anytime he moved, the group sent a flurry of kicks into his ribs and abdomen. Once they had tenderized him to the point of near unconsciousness, they dragged his limp body back into the folding chair and secured him with the same rope they had used to secure me.

*“You’re all fucking animals…”* I whispered.

Ari’s head hung motionless, chin to chest. The metallic scent of newly liberated blood drifted through the air like smoke. Even though I was unharmed, I could still almost taste it, wet copper lurching over the tip of my tongue.

*“****You’re all…fucking…animals-****”* my scream muffled by someone behind me stuffing a sock into my mouth.

A barrage of primal shrieks leapt up from my vocal cords, but they barely made any noise through the thick fabric. With both of their prisoners subdued, Barb, Juan and the rest of the group jumped off the stage, discussing preparations for the main event with the crowd of people that was gathering in the aisle.

Slowly, Ari lifted his head to midline. To my confusion, his expression of fear had dissipated, seemingly beaten out of him. He concentrated, perking his ears and moving his eyes from side to side, clearly trying to determine if there was anyone nearby. Satisfied that no one was within earshot, he dragged his eyes forward to meet mine.

They were almost bulging from their sockets. Not with terror. Not with confusion. His jades were agape with frenzy, somehow burning even brighter than Barb’s were.

I felt my thoughts freeze and body overheat like an old radiator as I observed the corners of Ari’s mouth curl upwards.

He smiled at me.

With no one else watching, his lips contorted into a rapturous Cheshire Cat’s grin, violent and uncanny.

Ari tilted his head forward, cloaking everything but his teeth in shadow. Quivering candles illuminated his jaw with a frail spotlight, and I couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed by a grim nostalgia.

Just like *The Last Great Seer did* forty years prior, Ari seared a series of apocalyptic words into my consciousness. But these words were new. And unlike the prophecy, these words may have truly been conjured for me alone.

*“Kings can bleed, governments can collapse, and Gods…Gods can fade. These masters can die because they’re artificial. We made them.”*

*“But superstition…superstition is immortal. Its tangled within us, to our very core. It’s undying because it’s hereditary, a ghost in our DNA.”*

*“You can’t kill the inseparable, Meghan.”*

Suddenly, as quickly as it came, the green-eyed harbinger’s grin vanished.

With his mask of fear nailed on tight, Ari placed his chin to his chest and waited for deliverance.

\-----------

I find myself unwilling or unable to detail what came next.

Just know that, by the time the town was finished with him, Ari had been thoroughly disassembled.

Until the break of dawn, they worked their way down the white board’s profane list. From what I could tell, the original plan was to only subject Ari to the violent instructions that held a majority from the town’s combined memories.

But bloodletting always begets more bloodletting.

This is the Apocalypse we’re talking about, after all. And they couldn’t be one hundred percent sure which vile act was the key to saving us.

Better safe than sorry, right?

When the sun rose, unaccompanied by conflagration, they patted themselves on the back.

They buried what remained of Ari, if that’s even his real name, in an unmarked grave next to Shepard.

And that’s what hurt me the most.

\-----------

Have you ever heard of a geomagnetic storm?

I sure as shit hadn’t, not until a man claiming to be an environmental services worker called our home the morning after our town enacted the prophecy. They told me they were looking to speak to Shep, that he had called them about a beached whale twenty four hours ago. Now, for whatever reason, they found themselves unable to reach him. They believed they had an explanation for what happened, and they wanted to pass that explanation along.

I won’t pretend like I understand the science of it all, but I can give you all the broad strokes.

Rarely, when the sun emits a wave of energy, known as a solar wind, it can reach earth and disrupt our magnetic fields. Now, stop me if any of these phenomena sound familiar.

Animals like birds, which rely on internal magnetism to guide migration, can become disoriented when magnetic fields are disrupted, grounding themselves until their physiology is restored. In some cases, whales have been known to beach themselves, as they also rely on magnetism for guidance.

Electrical systems can fail, too. Hell, some theorists have speculated that magnetic shifts can cause the formation of a transient Aurora Borelias in places that aren’t normally associated with that type of cosmic occurrence.

At first, I’m wondering why I’m being told all of this. But then, it hits me. Another grim nostalgia.

I’m listening to the hollow, monotoned voice from my childhood. They hid it at first, no doubt wanting to keep me on the line long enough to gloat. As they finished confirming my suspicions that everything our town did was not born of divine purpose, however, they let the masquerade fall.

Once I realized it was them, I hung up. I didn’t need to hear anymore.

\-----------

You might ask yourself, what’s the point? Well, here it is.

I think we were all part of some grand experiment. Someone wanted to prove that they could condition a group of people to commit heinous atrocities without the justification of patriotism, financial incentive, or religious zealotry. They wanted to show that intelligent, well-adjusted members of society could enact hell on earth in pursuit of preventing an Apocalypse, ignoring any contradictory information that may stand in their way. All they needed was a way to manifest apocalyptic conditions at the right time, which, apparently, involved a localized disruption of magnetic fields.

They may have to nudge the circumstances along, of course. Maybe a Leviathan didn’t beach itself as intended, so they sent someone down to electrocute the damn thing, and then they pulled it to shore.

They felt so confident in their hypothesis, in fact, I imagine that they said:

*“Hey - I bet these animals will do it even if we give them different instructions on how to do it. That’s how well this going to work.”*

The point is this: our group was just a prototype. A trial run of sorts. I believe we were preparation for a larger, more horrific conditioning event.

So, I’m here to provide a cautionary tale. It’s the least I can do for Shepard.

Look around you. How many of your coworkers, friends, and family members use astrology to guide their actions? We think we’ve evolved beyond myth and superstition, but that’s an outright lie, and the belief hurts us more than it helps us. We need to be vigilant against this type of control. 

Don’t believe me?

Pull out your phone, open the application store, and search for “*The Last Great Seer”.* Should be a new release, listed under astrology or cosmology.

Tell me what you see.
