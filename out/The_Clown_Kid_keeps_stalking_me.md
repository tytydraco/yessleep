It’s been six months. I haven’t seen any signs of him, and I’m ecstatic. 

I mean, what was he? Why hasn’t he shown up again? 

Regardless, I’m happy. 

After the incident, I’d kept my eyes on the news, half-expecting some poor sucker to run into the Clown Kid. End up in the hospital…or worse…

I’d had a good season of rest with Jessica and Venny afterward. Staying with them had given me purpose. 

It made me think, finally, things could go back to normal.

But then, it happened. I started seeing him again.

It occurred when I drove by the park where everything happened. But why did I go there? 

I wanted to put it all behind me. See the place and know that it was normal. Forget it had ever happened.

But that’s when I saw him, a lone boy wandering in the park, face aimed at the ground.

I knew it was him, so I gunned it past and never looked back. 

It was a stupid idea and I regretted doing it. 

I went to work the next day and buried myself in my projects. I should’ve known that it wouldn’t have helped. 

“Hey, Greg.”

I looked up from my desk. It was Art, my supervisor, appearing stressed in his white shirt and black tie. 

“What is it?”

“There’s…uh…some kid in the lobby…who wants to see you.”

“Some kid?” I said and launched up. “Is he wearing clown makeup?”

“Is he…what?!”

“Just tell me, Art.”

“No, he’s —” 

“Don’t talk to him!”

I grabbed my things. Sprinted out the back. Art calling after me. “Greg, what’s going on?!”

I burst outside. Leapt into my car. And drove off. 

I glanced back as the office shrank in the distance. I was relieved not to see anything.

That afternoon, I picked up Venny from school. Jessica was working late, so I was babysitting for the evening.

“Can I watch something, Uncle Greg?” Venny asked as we pulled into the driveway.

“Of course, V.”  

I got inside, put on a kid’s show, and went to the kitchen for a drink.

I was so anxious and exhausted. For the past six months, I’d been free of torment. But now, one mistake had brought everything back.

“Uncle Greg, a commercial popped up!”

“Coming!”

I turned to go back in and noticed something on the floor. 

It was wet and sticky —

— blood — 

“Oh no…”

I dove into the living room. “Venny!”

But it wasn’t my living room anymore. 

I was in the nursery of an old Victorian house. 

There was a woman nursing a baby, whispering, “Little Tommy, you’re so beautiful. So, so beautiful.” 

The baby cooed and pawed at his mother’s hands. 

The floorboards CREAKED and the woman looked up, whispering in a cold voice: “You should have played with him.”

I fell back into a pool of blood. Liquid washing over me.  

Standing over me was the Clown Kid. He had the face of a child but the body of a man. And he was holding me under the bloody water, CACKLING. 

I found myself gasping. Liquid pouring into my lungs. Then — 

“Uncle Greg! Uncle Greg!” 

— my eyes snapped open. A paramedic was standing over me. 

Venny was in the corner, panicked. 

The EMT asked, “Sir, can you hear me?”

A bright light shone in my face. I sat up. 

Jessica was crouched beside me.

“What happened, Greg?”

***

I asked Venny about the incident later. She said I had blacked out in the kitchen for no reason whatsoever. 

Strange.

Jessica pulled me aside the next day, asked me to leave. She was afraid I’d bring more dark energy into the house. 

Honestly, I couldn’t blame her. I felt half-insane myself. 

I put in my two weeks’ notice, packed my things, and kissed Venny goodbye.

I’ve decided to drive somewhere far away where this evil entity can’t harass my loved ones any longer.

It’s been three days and I’ve nearly reached the opposite end of the country. I’ve barely slept. 

I’m so tired. All I see is blood. And that terrifying face staring back at me.

Please, for the love of God, if you see that kid wearing clown makeup, run…
