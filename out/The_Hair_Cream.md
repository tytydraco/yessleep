Rustam was the most reliable driver I’ve ever had. Kid didn’t ask any questions, was quick at the wheel and wasn’t opposed to getting into a scuffle if needed. For five years the guy drove me and I didn’t have a single problem with him.

Once, I overheard some of the guys giving him a hard time for his inability to grow a beard but a smack and some stern talking to put those remarks to rest. Rustam was good people and he didn’t deserve the disrespect. The guys were, however, correct.

Rustam couldn’t grow a beard.

I, of course, did not care. I found his attempts endearing and if I ever asked him to shave, he did. Rustam’s facial hair did not interest me in the least bit, yet when one day I noticed his jaw covered in dark healthy stubble, I found myself curious.

I asked the Kid if he’s been to Turkey recently.

He laughs and tells me if he’d been on vacation, I would be the first to know. He tells me he found a new cream that is meant to stimulate hair growth.

I don’t make much of it, then.

Next morning, however, Rustam has a beard. A short, but thick, black beard that he could never hope to grow on his own. I ask him about this hair cream. I ask him where he got it.

He tells me a cousin gave it to him to pay off a debt.

It was a busy day, so I left it at that, but the question of the cream kept prodding at the back of my neck. In the evening, before Rustam would drive me back home, I asked the kid to take me to his cousin.

The cousin confirmed my hunch — the cream was local. It also didn’t come cheap. There was good money to be made with that cream. Being a local businessman, I felt left out. The cousin provided some leads and I sent some guys to follow up on them. By the morning, we had an address.

The cream was being sold out of a warehouse on the edge of town. The morning that Rustam drove me and the guys to investigate his beard was long and unkempt. The guys couldn’t help but comment in awe. Rustam’s smile was covered by his whiskers, but his head was raised in pride for the whole drive.

I brought two cars of muscle, but they weren’t needed. The warehouse was guarded by two dumb-looking twins. They each had a rifle slung across their chest, yet they didn’t put up the slightest bit of resistance. When we showed up, they just stepped aside without a word and let us enter the warehouse.

There were a couple laborers inside that were preparing the cream. They were taking pink plastic bottles labeled GH058 and covering them with packaging which read ‘HAIR SERUM’ in Latin letters. They, much like the mute guards, put up very little resistance to my guys. When we asked who ran their operation, they all pointed to the small office at the back of the warehouse. A certain Professor Barat was in charge.

I left my guys to further investigate the warehouse and made my way over to the office to introduce myself.

I consider myself a humble man, but I am also a realist. There are few people in the province who don’t recognize me, and even if my face is foreign my name is well known. To Professor Barat, however, I was a stranger.

The scientist was irritated that his guards had not stopped me from entering the warehouse. Even after I introduced myself, his demeanor didn’t change. The man was irritated, rude and beyond arrogant. With my patience wearing thin, I invited him to look out of his office and say hello to my guys.

It’s only once he saw that he was desperately outnumbered that Barat’s tone changed. He didn’t get scared though. Usually, when I drop in on parasites that don’t pay their tribute, they beg for mercy. Barat simply seemed annoyed. He acted as if my visit was an imposition on his valuable time.

He explained that he was a member of a scientific institution and that his sale of the hair cream was a means of raising finances for deeply under-funded research. My patience with the man was already wearing thin. When he claimed he could not pay a proper tribute because his market was wholly local, my patience ran out.

I consider myself a humble man, but I have learned long ago that letting insults fester unpunished leads to bigger problems down the line. I gave the scientist a smack and then a kick for good measure. I told the scientist I was not an idiot. The labeling on the bottles of the hair cream was meant for a Western audience. If he was going to sell local magic to the rich, I was owed due compensation.

I didn’t want to get any blood on my suit, so I called in two of my guys to help me conduct the interview. My punishment didn’t do much to change Barat’s tone. He still acted as if it was *I* that was imposing on his time. Once the guys started working on his fingers, however, he became a lot more forthcoming with the details of his operation.

The cream, he squealed, came from his laboratory. It was the result of decades of research and, if the research were permitted to continue, it could solve significantly more pressing problems than just hair loss. As the scientist spoke, my mouth grew wet with appetite. My aptitude for sniffing out business had brought me yet another boon.

I was already counting my profits when Barat revealed the name of the scientific organization he represented. The same hunch at the back of my neck which brought me to the warehouse suddenly sprang cold sweat.

Barat worked for the organization formerly known as The United People’s Institute of Science.

The United People’s Institute of Science was an underground research facility which dissolved along with the Soviet Union back in the early 90s. While the Institute still operated, it was the source of much dark gossip. The common folk spoke of missing children and secret weapons and all sorts of other theories about what was happening beneath their feet.

Once the Institute, officially, shut down the commoners still spoke of it, but the tenor of the stories changed. Tales of forbidden science and experiments that served as an affront to nature itself became common. The United People’s Institute of Science ceased to exist with Gorbachev’s fumble, but something else was born in its place.

The common folk called it the Ғылыми қондырғы.

Barat called it that too.

The moment I heard those horrid syllables I told my guys to let the scientist go. They were happy to do so. They too were familiar with the name. We left the warehouse immediately without any deals being made.

I ordered the guys to leave behind all souvenirs. Most of them were wise and did so without argument. Rustam, however, hesitated. He still put away the bottles of hair cream he took from the laborers, but he hesitated.

That night, as he drove me back home, I told him he should stay away from the cream. True, a lot of the things that were said about the Ғылыми қондырғы were old wives’ tales, but those foolish enough to investigate never came back. One would be wise not to get involved with forces they cannot understand.

Rustam was non-committal in his answer. I had hoped the kid would see the light, but the next morning he came into work his fading hair was twice as thick. Though he disregarded my advice, Rustam did at least trim his new beard to a civilized length.

I let the issue of Rustam and his beard fall to the wayside for about two months. It was his choice and, even though I didn’t agree with the source of his growth, I had more important business to contend with.

One day, however, I noticed Rustam’s hair and beard had lost much of their volume. I didn’t comment on it at first, but the next day his hair grew even more thin and sickly. Rustam himself seemed to be out of sorts as well. There was a gentle slur to his words and even his driving had lost some of its edge.

I asked Rustam how he was feeling and he put on a stoic front, but past his sickly skin and withering beard I could see he was ill. I sent the man home early and told him to get plenty of rest. He, as usual, didn’t argue. As he left the car I suggested, casually, that it might be time to stop using the hair cream. Rustam nodded, but said nothing.

The half-day did not help Rustam’s recovery. When I met him the following morning, he looked like death. Both his hair and his beard had turned the shade of bone and had the consistency of straw. His eyes were bloodshot and his skin had drained of all color. The man needed urgent medical attention.

I called off all my scheduled meetings and instructed Rustam to drive to my doctor’s house. He did not argue. Instead, he thanked me.

As we drove, I assured Rustam that he would get the best care and that he would be feeling good in no time. I had paid a good retainer for the doctor and was confident in his services. My positive outlook, however, faded.

Rustam’s beard was moving. It was *writhing*.

I decided to let Rustam focus on the road. In silence, we drove and I tried to keep my eyes on the passing scenery beyond. Occasionally, I would look over at Rustam in hopes that the movement I saw was just a trick of the light.

It wasn’t. Like a nest of gray featureless snakes — Rustam’s beard *writhed*.

The doctor always greeted me with a smile, yet when he saw the state Rustam was in he didn’t even shake my hand. He helped Rustam walk up the steps of his porch, but he kept his distance from his face. By then the strands of Rustam’s face were pulsating as if they had a life of their own.

There was more than enough business to attend to, but I spent the whole day drinking tea in the waiting room. Barat’s health was important to me. It certainly was a concern. What kept me sitting in that hall all through lunch, however, was a morbid curiosity.

I wanted to know what the hair cream did to my driver.

The answers did not come until the sun had set. The doctor was drenched in sweat and his gloves were slick with blood. He waved to me, managed the weakest of smiles and bid me outside for a cigarette.

His hands shook and so did his voice. A parasite which the doctor could not identify had burrowed deep into Rustam’s skin. His fingers tapped the cigarette as if it were morse code. At first, the doctor tried to be professional and measured with his diagnosis, but when he eventually stuttered out the word his true horror showed:

*Worms.* Rustam’s face was filled with *worms*. He had managed to take them all out, but there were hundreds of them and they were burrowed deep. The doctor said he couldn’t explain what had transpired. When I told him about where Barat’s hair cream came from, he let out a long sigh.

The doctor assured me he would do his best to make sure Rustam would make some form of recovery. When he shook my hand as I left, he didn’t seem confident. He is, however, a very good doctor.

Three weeks later, Rustam sat behind the wheel of my car and his face was covered. He apologized, deeply, for not following my advice. He had, clearly, learned his lesson.

Rustam still is the most reliable driver I’ve ever had. He doesn’t ask any questions, is quick at the wheel and isn’t opposed to getting into a scuffle if needed. He wears a balaclava when he drives, but I don’t [mind](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/comments/q2qjz1/%D2%93%D1%8B%D0%BB%D1%8B%D0%BC%D0%B8_%D2%9B%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%8B%D1%80%D2%93%D1%8B/).
