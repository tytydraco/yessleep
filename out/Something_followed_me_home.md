Has anyone heard of the game “Hounds and Hare”? I was scrolling on r/nosleep seeing what was new as I had just gotten into using Reddit;
That’s when someone named Erica made a post and mentioned the game “Hounds and Hare” in one of the posts it sounded pretty interesting and it’s pretty simple to play. you get a small group of people at least a party of two or more. 

You draw sticks and the smallest is the Hare the other or others are hounds. 
You go out into the woods and the hare gets a bottle of white powder, it can be any powder (baby powder, flour or anything like that) and you get an hour to run around the woods and powder the ground in winding paths. Once you’ve run out of powder or the time is up the hare finds a place to hide. 
At the same time When the hour is up the hounds are allowed to start their “hunt” 
The hounds use the power on the ground and foliage around to try and find the hare; the hare must stay in their hiding spot for at least 5 minutes before they can start trying to sneak their way out of the woods back to their home. 
If the hounds find the hare then the game is over and the hare loses but if hare gets back home the hare is safe. 

There aren’t many rules, only two. The first rule was the game HAD to be played either afternoon (like 4 to 6) or at night. The second rule? The hare isn’t allowed to look behind them. On the post there wasn’t a reason as to why or if there was any punishment like the hounds instantly win or something. It just said that was the only rule. 

I thought it seemed fun, so I asked a few friends to play with me, I had just moved recently and my new house had a thick patch of woods in the back. So when we were all free my friends Ace, Margo, and my boyfriend Emmet went into the woods to play the game. 
I ended up playing the role of the Hare. 

It was fun at fist, to run around feeling like a small kid again. Playing with my friends in the small creek near my school.
However it started to feel less fun as the sun started going down, we started the game around 6:30ish it was a bit dim but it wasn’t dark, but now it had gotten creepy. 
I started seeing shapes in the trees and hearing voices that didn’t sound like my friends. 
When it felt like five minutes I started to make my way out of the woods to my house, I felt like I was being watched. I listened around me trying to hear my friends or my boyfriend looking for me but I didn’t hear anything. I never knew how quiet woods were at night. You would think there would be a cricket cheeping or a bird fluttering its wing. Something. But no, nothing. 

When I had finally gotten out of the woods and started to walk towards my house, I heard my friend Margo call out to me, “I found you!” She yelled, I heard her clear as day but when I turned around to give her a congratulations she wasn’t there.  Nothing was there. Just the woods. I waited a second thinking she would walk out from the trees but no. She never came out. I started to get a sinking feeling in my chest, the same feeling I would get as a kid. I had always been afraid of the dark, but I’d never been more scared of it than I was in that moment staring into the dark emptiness of trees. 
I turned back and gunned for my back door, slamming the door behind me. And some how my gut feeling had gotten even worse. 

Ace, Emmet and Margo came around the corner and Emmet gave me an odd look; “ you were still out there?” I didn’t answer him and just kept staring at Margo; had she been with them in the house this whole time? She wasn’t outside with me? 

After taking a few minutes to calm myself down I asked Margo if she had just been outside, she said no. 

She told me how they couldn’t find me but when they were looking around the edge of the woods they saw what they thought was me running towards the house. So they assumed I had made it back and won the game. Apparently they had gotten to the house a few moments before I did. 

Which only made me feel more weirded out. 

Since then weird things have been happening around my house. 
It started small a tap here and there, or a small bang coming inside the walls from the kitchen and sometimes scratching under my bedroom floors. Just under my mattress. 

But it’s gotten worse. Recently my cat has disappeared. My cat Gizz liked to find ways to sneak out of the house, before we moved he liked to sneak out the window in the front hallway to get under the house. Or sometime hide in the bushes. 
Since we move he’d been staying inside more, not trying to snake out, not even to hide in the big bushes in our new garden. 
He just sits on the windowsill staring out to the back yard. The woods. 
 The only reason I’ve started to get concerned is because he never stays out for long; usually he’s back before sundown especially in the cold weather, but it’s been days. 3 days and counting, I call his name and he still hasn’t come back. Normally when I call his name he comes running. Not this time. 

The last straw was last night, I was finishing painting the walls in my new bedroom when I heard a bang. It came from the room next to mine. It used to be the master bedroom but I decided to not set that room as my new bedroom. It gives me a strange feeling. 
There is a door in that room. 
It’s not a closet, just a door. The place behind it isn’t another room either, it’s just an empty space; the no insulation, no done over floors, no ceiling. Just an empty space with nothing in it. 
Last night that door opened. 
Not all the way just a crack, it slowly creaked open before stopping then the tapping started again.
