I'm not sure if anyone will see this, being that I made a new account to post this in hopes of remaining anonymous. I've never told anyone what I saw that day because, well, I knew no one would believe me. Hell, if I didn't see it firsthand, I wouldn't believe it either.

That being said, bear with me — storytelling isn't exactly my forte. I just ask that you keep an open mind. What I’m about to tell you isn’t fiction. Whether or not you believe me is entirely up to you.

Part 1

It was 4:00 AM when I woke up to the sound of my mom banging on my bedroom door, reminding me that we’d be making the nearly 7-hour drive to Big Bend National Park and had to be on the road in no more than 15 minutes.

I rolled out of bed, put on my shoes, grabbed my already packed duffle bag, and half-asleep, walked outside where my two sisters and two brothers sat waiting in our family’s 2020 4Runner. The thought of being trapped in a car with my seven-person family for seven hours made me cringe as I climbed into the back row of seats, sitting between my older brother Alex and my younger brother Michael.

Our family doesn’t travel much. When we do, we almost always drive rather than fly because it’s cheaper — and, well, nothing beats staring at the dull countryside of Texas for hours.

As we made our way down I-10 West, we talked about the itinerary of our 3-day trip.

Day 1: Arrive at our cabin in Terlingua Ranch Lodge, which was a 45-minute drive from the west entrance of the park.

Day 2: Start bright and early with a full day in the park — first hike the Santa Elena Canyon, then visit the Boquillas Hot Springs.

Day 3: Me, Alex, and my dad would summit the highest peak in the Chisos Mountains, Emory Peak. The rest of the family would hike some shorter trails.

Feeling overwhelmed by the busy schedule, I put on my headphones and tried to sleep for the rest of the drive.

I was shaken awake by my oldest sister Zoe just as the paved road turned into a bumpy dirt backroad. Hoping we’d arrive soon, I asked my mom how much longer.

“We should see the entrance to the ranch any minute now,” she replied, understandably tired.

Terlingua Ranch had a front office, 32 cabins, one swimming pool, an outhouse, and a café called The Bad Rabbit. Everything sat in the center of a U-shaped cluster of mountains. Within minutes, me and my siblings were stretching our legs while our parents checked us in.

Looking up at the surrounding mountains made me feel completely insignificant — a feeling quickly replaced by excitement thinking about what the night sky might look like without the light pollution of the city.

Since there were seven of us, we got two cabins about 100 feet apart. Me and my two brothers would stay in the one closest to the café. My parents and sisters had the one closer to the outhouse.

As we unloaded the car, I joked to my sister Jasmine that they’d fall asleep smelling the outhouse. She snapped back, “Well at least we won’t have to walk as far to use the bathroom at night.” I laughed, but her words stuck with me.

I found the key in my pocket, unlocked our cabin, and stepped inside. The first thing I noticed was how still the air felt. Everything looked frozen in time — black-and-white photos on the walls and a dim outdated lightbulb hanging from the wooden ceiling that barely lit the room.

It was unsettling, but after the long day, all I wanted was a shower and a nap.

When I woke up, the sun had already set. The cabin was empty. Assuming my brothers were out exploring, I put on my coat and shoes and stepped outside.

It was colder than I expected. I figured that was a good sign — at least the cabin was well insulated. Pulling my sleeves over my hands, I walked toward the outhouse to brush my teeth and wash my face. The moon lit the trail, so I didn’t bother turning on my flashlight.

Out of curiosity, I pulled my phone from my pocket to check the time.

1:30 AM.

“Shit, how long was I asleep?” I muttered, slipping the phone back into my jacket.

I looked up and froze in place. The stars stretched endlessly across the sky — so clear and brilliant it didn’t look real. I was mesmerized.

Then I heard it. The sound of a rock rolling behind me, like someone had kicked it while dragging their feet.

I whipped around. Nothing was there. Just the faint glow from the cabin’s porch light.

Trying to shake off the nerves, I kept walking — a little faster now. I reached the outhouse, and as I stepped inside, the door slammed shut behind me.

“Damn wind,” I whispered. I looked for the light switch. Nothing. No fixture. No bulb. Just moonlight leaking through a tiny window.

As I exited, three things happened almost simultaneously:

Silence. Utter, deafening silence. No wind. No insects. Not even my footsteps. You could hear a pin drop.

Realization. My brothers were gone. At 1:30 AM, it didn’t make sense for them to still be out exploring.

Darkness. Every star in the sky vanished. Like someone flipped a switch. Only the moon remained — brighter than ever.

Before I could process it, a voice broke through the silence.

“Come closer,” it said — curious, inhuman.

I stumbled back, slamming into the metal outhouse door. My heel made no sound.

“Let me see you,” it said again.

The voice wasn’t coming from anywhere. It was inside my head.

Eyes wide, I scanned the trail. And then I saw it.

A black figure, at least seven feet tall, had appeared halfway between me and the cabin. Its metallic skin folded and swirled like it was liquid. Where its eyes and mouth should’ve been, there were slits — both sealed shut.

“Who are you? What do you want?” I shouted — just before I realized I couldn’t breathe.

It took a step forward. The slits opened.

Its eyes were pure black holes.

Then came the voice again:

“Thank you.”

Its mouth never moved.

As I stared into its void-like eyes, trying to find anything human, I sat bolt upright in bed, drenched in sweat and gasping for air.
