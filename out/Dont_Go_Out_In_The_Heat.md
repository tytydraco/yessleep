 For the last 5 days I have been drenched in sweat. This heat wave has been killing me. I looked on my calender and write down the temperature for today. 

7/26/2023: Storm
7/27/2023: 89°F
7/28/2023: 91°F 
7/29/2023: 93°F
7/30/2023: 94°F 

 As I write it down I look outside and see the scorching heat rising from the roofs of the cars.

 10:30 am. 

 The mailman pulls up in his van and gets out like he normally does. He grabs my package that i ordered for my cousins birthday party and walks down the walkway. 

 I run into the kitchen and grabbed him a bottle of water. When the doorbell rings I unlocked it and sign for the package. I gave him the water and he nods in appreciation. 

 "Thanks. Been a hot couple of days huh?" 

 Being outside is making sweat pour down my eyebrow. I nod at him. "Yeah. Hopefully the rain will pick back up making everything cool off." 

 The mailman smiles,"that sure would be nice". He then waves bye and walks off. As I go to shut the door something caught my attention. I only saw it through the corner of my eye but I still saw it. 

 There was no chance of warning him. The creature loomed only like a shimmer of rising heat but the shape resembled something around it. The ground it walked on simmered as if touched by a cattle prod but left wet spots. 

 It went to him and I can still remember his body suddenly twisting. The sound the mailman made was like breaking a celery stick. 

 Blood went everywhere. As the mailman's body hit the ground the creature started ripping into it! Immediately i slammed the door shut and locked my door. Then looked out the window. The creature looked towards my house for only a second but went back to eating the mailman. 

 I was having a panic attack! What the hell was that thing! I thought. I jumped when my cellphone rang. It was Mark. My neighbor from across the street! I answered him. 

 "What the hell was that thing!" He is panting through the phone. 

 "I don't know!" I yelled back. The creature then looked towards my house again. I shut my mouth. The creature looked at my house for a couple of seconds which felt like a marathon and then resumed eating.

 "Well what can we do!" Mark asked. 

 "We….we have to warn the neighbors that way they won't come for them!" I told him. "Good plan", Mark says, "I'll call the neighbors while you call the cops." 

 I hang up the phone and dialed 911. But i got no answer. Phone lines were busy. Shit! I yelled in my head. After watching the creature for a few minutes Mark called me back. 

 "Hey. So, I called everybody. How did it go with the cops?" I told him, he sounded kind of pissed. "How are we supposed to protect ourselves from that!" He then hung up the phone. 

 After a couple of hours I paced around the house thinking if i should call 911 again. Then suddenly i heard a door opening. It was Samuel. A beighbor from from two houses down. I tried to look from my side window and saw that he was outside! He also had a pistol on him. 

 Samuel looled around and then raced to his truck. His scared face told me he was doubting his descicion. He then reached it and shut his doors. The ignition turns on amd he races down the street. People in the other houses looked outside theor windows to see. 

 As he made it halfway, the creature that I saw eating the mailman tries to chase after him. My heart racing I wished for him to be able to make it. My hopes were then shattered after a BANG! The truck flipped onto its side! 

 On the side of the truck was a huge dent like if a bull ran into it! Samuel kicked the window that was face up to get out. Suddenly another foggy creature then emerged and tore Sam's head off! 

 Then the first creature went over and they it looked like they were sharing him! 

 Everyone that as looking out the window also looked like they had their hopes crushed and went back inside. 

 It is 9:00 pm now. Their are also 5 of them now. I think they are sleeping. None of them has moved. 

 Should I try to make it?
