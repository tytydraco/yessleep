Rushing down the stairs with an almost terrifying pace, I put back on my shoes, medal still in hand. I fumbled with the door in anger, waking the family. Mary had gotten to the bottom of the stairs before I flung the door open, calling out to me. I marched over to Gary’s house, practically banging on the door. It shouldn’t take him too long to answer. However, it was Isaac who opened the door, with his cold, blue eyes staring back at me. *Of course, the little shit already knows.* 

*“You left a fucking Nazi medal in my goddamned house?!”* I screamed, my voice raw with rage. 

Mary, who had been running after to get my attention, froze in place.

The boy in front of me barely flinched. Instead, he scoffed, his voice laced with vitriol. *“Wrong name, d-.”* 

Before he could continue, I swung across his cheek, and he crumpled to the ground. I shook off my hand, my knuckles stinging from the impact.

*“Stay the fuck away from my kids. I know what you are.”* 

A sudden movement made me turn. Gary had rushed down downstairs, a handgun gripped loosely in his hands. He lifted it, hesitation clear in his stance, before recognition flickered in his eyes. He realized it was me.

I was already backed onto the porch, my hands raising in surrender.

His expression hardened. Back to his facade. *“Get out of my house, neighbor.”* 

For a moment, I stared at him expectantly, wanting him to do *something* about his son, but he slowly shook his head, moving towards the door to shut and lock it.

I kicked the staircase railing in anger, shaking my head and turning toward my own house. But I didn’t get far.

*“You just moved in and already overstayed your welcome.”* 

An old woman stood a few feet ahead, her face deceptively kind, but her words dripped with bitter venom.

*“People like you ruin everything,”* she sneered. *“Your family is nothing but disgusting, violent pigs.”* 

Behind her, other doors creaked open. Porch lights flickered on, illuminating the street like a stage. Even further outside our little cul-de-sac, more people filed out of their homes. One by one, neighbors shuffled out in their robes and slippers, their tired eyes brimming with something darker than exhaustion. 

And then, they moved. Slowly, at first, then with purpose, closing in. 

On us.

*“Get the hell away from us, you creepy motherfuckers!”* I shrieked, as they surrounded us in a crowd. It was like we shook a nest of hornets, how they all flocked to swarm us as quickly as I hit Isaac.

At first, they shouted and spat insults, hurling every slur and vile name they could think of. But then, their heckling began to shift, merging into something akin to what I heard back at the church.

It started as a low murmur, crawling under my skin, insidious and unnatural.

*“You’re next. You’re next. You’re next.”* 

The words swelled, rising into a full-throated chant, echoing throughout the neighboorhood and rattling my skull. 

Some of them were overtaken in religious fervor, their porcelain white skin flushed red, veins bulging, froth bubbling at the corners of their mouths. Others swayed where they stood, like drug addicts.

Mary and the kids huddled close to me. I wrapped them as best I could. 

We edged sideways, pushing toward our house. I shoved past a few of them, ignoring their glazed-over stares, until we finally slipped inside. As I slammed the door shut, the crowd turned in unison, their empty eyes following us.

I dragged a heavy shelf in front of the door, bracing it against whatever might come next.

Jamie wailed, his cries piercing through the thick tension in the room. Miriam clung to Mary, burying her face in her mother’s side.

*“Are we going to die?”* she asked, her voice trembling, body shaking with fear.

Mary stroked her hair, her voice soft but steady. *“No, baby. Mommy and Daddy are going to protect you and your brother.”* She held her close, whispering reassurances in her ear.

I stepped forward and scooped Jamie into my arms, rubbing his back in slow, gentle circles—the one thing that had always calmed him down. I rocked him, whispering quiet shushes, my own throat tightening.

For a moment, tears burned in my eyes. But I forced them back. I had to be strong for them.

*“Daddy’s going to sit right here and keep y’all safe,”* I said, my voice firm. *“I need you to go upstairs, lock the bedroom door, and stay quiet. No matter what.”*

Mary hesitated, her lips parting as if to argue. But then, she just nodded.

*“Come on,”* she whispered to the kids, holding out her arms.

I handed Jamie over, now silent but clutching her shirt with tiny fists. Mary ushered Miriam upstairs, glancing back at me only once before disappearing down the hall.

I turned away and walked to the kitchen, grabbing the largest knife I could find.

Then, I dragged a chair across the wooden floor, the sound grating against my ears, and positioned it a few feet from the front door.

And I sat.

The alcohol that had clouded my judgment earlier had mostly worn off, replaced by something far worse—primal, bone-deep fear.

For hours, we were at their mercy.





At some point, exhaustion won. My head drooped, and I drifted off.

When the first light of dawn crept through the blinds, I jolted awake, momentarily blinded. My heart pounded as I checked the time. **6 AM.**

I stumbled out of the chair and rushed to the windows. Then the garage. Then the back door. No signs of forced entry. No footprints in the dewy grass.

Upstairs, I found Mary and the kids still curled up together, finally asleep.

I exhaled, tension loosening in my chest. But my relief was short-lived.

Something had to be done about those bastards.

I took a cold shower, letting the icy water jolt me fully awake. Then, I threw on a T-shirt, sweatpants, and my running sneakers. I grabbed my wallet and keys, checked every lock, and stepped outside.

The neighborhood was silent again.

They must have left sometime after I dozed off. But why?

Had they marked me for purging?

I wouldn’t know for sure until Sunday.

**It was Tuesday.**

Five days until the next procession. Five days to prepare.

First, I needed answers.

Why did Isaac bring a KKK medallion into my house? I knew there was racism here, but this?

This was something else.

Something worse.

It was like living in a goddamn horror movie, like fucking *Get Out.*

I kept a steady jog, head down, though I knew it wouldn’t do much. As I left the neighborhood, the world around suddenly whirred to life. Cars rushing past, people walking their dogs, voices carrying over phone calls.

A few glanced my way, their expressions unreadable, though some almost looked... *sorry for me.* I ignored it and pressed on.

By the time I reached the pier, it was already bustling with life. Fishermen cast their lines into the lake, families lingered along the docks, and boats drifted in the distance. I slowed to catch my breath, my body reminding me I wasn’t as young as I used to be. Still, I had run far enough to feel accomplished.

My car was right where I had left it. I rounded the hood, pulling out my keys—then stopped.

Something was tucked under the windshield wiper.

**Shit.**

Expecting a parking ticket, I snatched it up. But it wasn’t a citation—it was a crumpled scrap of paper, creased and worn like it had been balled up and smoothed out again.

There was only one thing written on it.

An address.

No name. No explanation. Just a destination.

Frowning, I pulled out my phone and punched the address into Maps. It led to a library about ten miles away.

I sighed. This was going to take up my whole day.

Without a second thought, I called in sick to work. It’d put me in hot water, but my family’s safety came first.

Before getting in, I did a full sweep—checked the trunk, the back seat, even under the seats. No signs of anything stolen. No signs of anything *planted.*

Satisfied, I slid behind the wheel, started the engine, and headed for the library.





When I arrived, I double-checked the address, unsure if I was in the right place.

The building loomed before me, its architecture ancient and imposing—much like the church, though with a more scholarly air, something straight out of *Harry Potter.*

I stepped out of the car and took a closer look. The towering stone structure had an old-world charm, its massive wooden doors worn but sturdy. Taking a deep breath, I pushed them open and peeked inside.

Warm lighting bathed the interior, casting a golden glow over the towering bookshelves and massive columns near the entrance. The air was thick with the scent of aged paper and ink, a musty but oddly comforting aroma.

Students from the nearby campus filled the space, some hunched over textbooks, others murmuring quietly among themselves.

As I took it all in, one of the receptionists waved me over.

*“Hi, do you need any help today?”*

She couldn’t have been older than twenty, her youthful features framed by a ponytail of ginger hair. Her oversized glasses looked a little too big for her face, giving her an almost bookish innocence.

*“Uh, yeah,”* I said, stepping closer. *“Do you have any books on the history of the nearby towns? Also, any news clippings from the town over.”*

She blinked. *“From how far back?”*

*“Well… as far back as possible. I’ll be here for a while, so I want to cover my bases.”*

She stared at me for a second before nodding.

*“We have records dating back to the 18th century.”* She turned to her computer, tapped a few keys, then gave me directions to the archives.

I thanked her and made my way deeper into the library, my pulse quickening.

If there were answers to be found, they’d be here.





I followed the receptionist’s directions, weaving through the towering bookshelves, keeping my gaze low as I passed clusters of students. The deeper I ventured, the quieter the library became, the hum of conversation fading into an eerie stillness.

At last, I reached a secluded section in the far back—a dimly lit archive room that felt more like an office than a library. Rows of meticulously organized file cabinets lined the walls, and shelves sagged under the weight of aging tomes and yellowed newspapers, neatly categorized by date.

Behind a worn wooden desk sat a lone librarian, flipping through a ledger. He was older than me, bald on top with wisps of gray at the sides, his reading glasses balanced precariously on the edge of his nose. He barely glanced up as I entered.

*“Help you with something?”* he rasped, his voice rough with age.

*“Yeah,”* I said, stepping closer. *“I’m looking for historical records on the town—anything strange. Unusual events, disappearances… hate groups. That sort of thing.”*

That made him pause. He looked at me, studying my face with a mix of curiosity and something else—caution, maybe—before nodding slowly.

*“We keep local newspapers and town records back here. Some of the older ones aren’t digitized, so you’ll have to go through them manually,”* he said, gesturing toward a heavy filing cabinet against the far wall. *“Start with those. The rest are in the microfilm room.”*

*“Thanks.”*

*“Hold on,”* he added, reaching into a nearby drawer. He pulled out a box of latex gloves and shook it lightly. *“You’ll want to use these.”*

I took a pair and slipped them on before moving to the cabinet. The drawer groaned as I pulled it open, releasing a stale, musty scent—the unmistakable aroma of old ink and decaying paper.

At first, the files contained the usual small-town history—construction projects, business openings, the occasional scandal.

But the deeper I dug, the more the stories began to shift:

**1915: Unexplained disappearances on the outskirts of town.**

**1928: Mass resignation of town officials—no reason given.**

**1936: Church congregation accused of “ritualistic practices.”**

**1952: Family of four vanished—house left untouched, food still on the table.**

A chill crept up my spine as I scanned the headlines, each one more unsettling than the last. Then, my eyes landed on a particular article, and my breath caught in my throat.

**"Local Businessman Found Dead in Apparent Suicide – Strange Symbol Engraved in Skull."**

The date was recent. Eight years ago. 

Beneath the headline was a grainy black-and-white photo of the man’s lifeless body. Above and slightly-right to his temple was an intricate symbol carved deep into his skull. I had seen it before.

It was the same one I had seen on the Klan medallion in my house.

My fingers tightened around the brittle newspaper, sweat beading down my forehead. My pulse was pounding in my ears.

This wasn’t just about racism.

There was something much worse lurking in this town.

There was something else peculiar about the article. Every case mentioned a trail that went cold a few miles past the nearby railroad tracks. Clothes and dolls were often found scattered near the tracks, later identified by neighbors as belonging to the missing family of four. In the case of the businessman with the engraved skull, his body had been dumped in a ditch right beside the tracks. Even in the older articles, this trend was still prevalent with the clothes of the missing persons being torn and hung over the trees.

I took the article and walked over to the old librarian.

*“Do you have directions to the railroad tracks mentioned in this paper?”*

He glanced at the article, his expression shifting from curiosity to dread. His face went pale.

*“No, you don’t want to do that,”* he muttered.

So he knew.

*“There are people in danger,”* I pressed. *“I need to find out what the hell is happening in this town.”*

He exhaled sharply, shaking his head. *“You think you’re the first brave soul to go chasing ghosts? You’re dealing with something beyond you, beyond all of us.”*

*“I don’t have a choice,”* I said. *“Last night, people were chanting outside my front door. And I found a Klan medal in my house.”*

His eyes widened in disbelief. He pulled off his glasses and rubbed his forehead. *“Oh, God…”*

For a moment, he said nothing. Then, with a heavy sigh, he spoke.

*“If you go beyond the steel refinery, about a mile out, you’ll reach the train station. Follow the tracks past the river, and keep going. You’ll know when you get there.”* His voice dropped lower. *“I’m warning you—there’s something deeply wrong with that place. It’s taboo to even take pictures of it. Bring a friend with you, let your family know where you’re going.”*





His directions echoed in my mind as I drove home, my grip tightening on the wheel. I needed to prepare. My first thought was to bring Gary, but there was a chance Isaac was still keeping an eye on him. I mulled it over while gathering supplies—food, water, batteries, flashlights, and a small medical kit. I also grabbed a portable charger. If I was going to find proof, I needed to make sure I could document it. But who would I even show it to? Would the police even care?

At home, I kept my explanations brief. I told my family I was going hiking, avoiding any details that might make them suspicious. She chose not to press, but the kids begged to come along. I told them no, promising to bring back a cool rock instead. That was enough to satisfy them, making things easier.

Rather than meeting Gary in person, I called him.

*"I found something big. Are you free tomorrow morning?"*

He hesitated on the other end. *"Yeah. I’ll pick you up. Don’t tell me anything over the phone."*

*"One more thing—bring hiking gear."*

With that, I hung up.

That night, I cooked dinner for my family—burgers and fries, something simple but comforting. If this was the last time I saw them, I wanted to share a meal before stepping into the unknown.





**Wednesday.**

The next day arrived, and I met Gary outside our homes. He had a backpack slung over his shoulder, dressed in a short-sleeved flannel over a tee, paired with shorts and gray sneakers. I opted for a gray hoodie, shorts, and durable sneakers. He gave me a nod before tossing our gear into the trunk and climbing into the driver’s seat.

*"Is Isaac gonna know?"* I asked, my voice edged with concern.

*"No. As far as I can tell, he's not suspicious of me. You, though... I don't know."* He pulled out of the driveway, heading down the road.

*"I brought weapons,"* he added casually. *"I know you don’t have a license, but if shit goes sideways, I don’t want you running around with your dick in your hand."*

He popped open the glove compartment, revealing a steel revolver and a stubby black handgun nestled inside, along with several boxes of ammo. He glanced at my expression and smirked.

*"They're not loaded. Relax."* He shut the compartment before I could say anything.

I shook my head and turned to look out the window as we drove.

For the next forty minutes, I guided him according to the librarian’s directions. Sure enough, we eventually arrived at the old train station. The parking lot was surprisingly busy, filled with cars from commuters and travelers. We grabbed our gear, loaded our weapons, and stepped out. Gary had a holster for his revolver, but I didn’t, so I awkwardly tucked the handgun into my waistband.

Standing by the tracks, we looked in both directions—railroad stretching endlessly in either direction, disappearing into the horizon.

We started walking, quickly realizing we had underestimated the sheer distance. Mile after mile passed, accompanied by the occasional stop along the way. Eventually, civilization faded behind us, replaced by dense forest pressing in on either side.

Then, we reached the river.

I stopped to take a few pictures, though there wasn’t much worth capturing. The river was murky and littered with trash, its banks lined with debris and broken branches. It reeked of stagnation.

Still, we pressed on, trudging another two miles deeper into the unknown.

*“I think we should stop here,”* Gary spoke up, pulling his pack off and squatting beside a tree to unload it. 

*"Really? I feel like I could keep going,"* I said, stretching my arms as I balanced on a rock.

*"Alright, LeBron, pack it up. Sit your ass down and eat."*

I rolled my eyes but did as he said, unpacking my bag. A quick glance at my watch made my stomach drop—2 p.m. Already?

Jesus. Six hours of just walking. We needed to find something. Soon. We were burning daylight.

We ate in silence, charging our phones and resting for about twenty minutes. The break was welcome, but there was an unshakable feeling creeping over us. Like we were being watched. Not by a person—by something else.

Gary finally broke the silence. *"So... what did you find in the library? You didn’t say much in the car."*

*"Yeah, I know. But here."* I pulled out my phone and flipped through the photos. "More messed-up shit that happened nearby. This goes way back, man. We’re talking 1800s to the late 1900s. And Matthews? He wasn’t just involved—he was full-on Klan. That medal? That was his."

Gary ran a hand through his hair. *"The 1800s? What is he, a fucking vampire? How is that even possible? I mean, I knew the guy was old, but… that’s like three centuries."*

*"Astute fucking observation,"* I muttered. "I just know it’s tied to what y’all went through. The altar you were being fed through. I don’t know how, but I’m inclined to believe the answer’s here. Every trail leads to these tracks. Every victim left behind *something*. And for whatever reason… no one has gone deeper than where we are right now."

Gary rocked back and forth, muttering curses under his breath. He knew how bad this was getting. But so did I.

I had risked his life dragging him into this, sure. But he risked mine first—leading me to that damned church, putting a target on my back.

I’d say we were even now.

For now, we hadn’t seen anything damning yet. We kept walking, just hoping to find something—anything. The forest stretched endlessly around us, trees packed so tightly they felt like looming walls.

In a car, it would’ve been comforting. Most roads in Connecticut are like this—long stretches of trees blurring past the windows.

But walking through it?

It was too quiet. Unnaturally so.

I hated how creepy it was.

We soldiered on, the woods growing thicker, the trees more mangled and twisted as if they were warped by some wicked phenomena. The overbearing silence wrapped around us like a suffocating blanket. The air had grown thicker too—sticky with humidity and a staleness that made every breath labored. We both kept our eyes peeled, scanning the forest around us, but there was nothing. No signs of life, no sounds of animals—just the soft, rhythmic crunch of our boots on the dirt.

*"Something feels off,"* Gary muttered, breaking the silence. *"This place... somethin’ ain’t right."*

I didn’t need him to tell me that. I felt it too. It meant we were on the right track. It was more than just the silence, more than just the eerie stillness of the woods. It was as if the forest itself was holding its breath, watching us. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something, or someone, was out there in the shadows, waiting for us to lower our guards.

Beside the railroad, was a different path. It curved slightly, and beyond that, the trees thinned out, revealing what looked like a small clearing. It was barely noticeable—just a small gap in the dense undergrowth. But something about it caught my eye. The closer we got, the more it felt like we were walking into something we shouldn’t.

Gary noticed me eyeing the clearing. *"You see that?"* he asked quietly, his voice tight with the same unease I was feeling.

*"Yeah."* I chose to keep quiet, but it was for sure a trap. Though, it was the only sign of proof we’ve had in miles.

We continued forward, drawn to the gap in the trees, almost as if it was welcoming us. As we stepped into the clearing, the air seemed to change. The oppressive heaviness of the forest was gone, replaced by an eerie stillness. I felt exposed here, vulnerable. Every instinct in me screamed to turn back.

In the middle of the clearing was a small, weathered shack. It was barely standing—its roof sagging, windows boarded up with planks of rotting wood. The whole structure seemed to be decaying, but it felt like it had been abandoned for much longer than it actually had been.

Gary’s eyes narrowed. "This is it, huh? Feels like a trap."

I didn’t reply. I couldn’t. I wasn’t sure what to think. I walked up to the shack, my hand hovering near the gun at my side, ready for anything. I wasn’t sure if it was the wind or something else, but I thought I heard a faint rustling sound—like something moving inside the shack.

Before I could stop him, Gary had already made his way to the front door. He hesitated for a moment, then knocked, loud and deliberate.

Nothing.

"Let’s check it out," he said, turning the knob and pushing the door open with a creak that echoed through the clearing.

We stepped inside, the air immediately thick with the smell of mildew and rot. We raised our arms simultaneously, to shield our noses. The walls were lined with old newspaper clippings, much like the ones I’d seen in the library. But these were different—torn, faded, and pinned with red string, connecting faces, events, names. Every image seemed to pulse with a disturbing familiarity.

I could barely make out a few of the headlines: *"Disappearances Continue," "Local Official Bows Out," "The Cult Returns."*

I scanned the room, my eyes quickly flicking over the clutter, until something caught my attention. A photograph pinned to the wall, just beside an old, faded map of the area. The photo was barely distinguishable, sepia-toned and worn with age. It showed a crowd of people dressed in the white robes of the Klan, their faces twisted in expressions of amusement, almost celebratory. In the background, several figures hung limply from trees, bags covering their heads. Homes were engulfed in flames behind them, the smoke filling the sky.

But what stood out to me, what made my breath catch, was the lone figure at the front of the crowd. He was different from the rest. Stoic, almost stately in his demeanor. He wore round spectacles and his gaunt face seemed almost familiar. He was younger, but unmistakable.

Father Matthews.

The connection was undeniable. The man who had been running this town’s secret cult for generations stood among a mob of murderers. And he was looking straight at the camera.

I stepped closer, my heart hammering in my chest. My fingers trembled as I reached for the picture, carefully pulling it off the wall.

"We need to get out of here," Gary whispered.

"Not yet… I needed to find this. Everything led me here. This is proof."

He stared at me like I’d lost my mind, but that hardly mattered. I snapped several photos—of the place, the group picture, and most importantly, the map. Red lines stretched from my town to where we stood, with blue-circled entry points scattered across the map, all leading back to the church. I took another picture. These locations could be key.

Still, something gnawed at me. I had no idea who led me to this library, but they knew exactly what I needed to see. They were trying to help.

Just as I turned, I heard it. Soft footsteps in the grass, picking up speed.

We froze.

I spun, yanking the handgun from my waistband, my finger twitching over the trigger.

Nothing.

"Let’s go," I muttered, my pulse thrumming in my ears. Something was wrong here. I wasn’t sticking around to find out what.

We checked the area before slipping back onto the main road. The sky was darkening—it was already 5 p.m. My phone was at 40 percent. I glanced at the map picture, spotting an entry point just half a mile away.

I looked at Gary. “Maybe we should keep going.”

He sighed, clapping a hand on my shoulder. “It’s late. We should come back tomorrow.”

I shook my head. “I have work. I’m not trying to get fired. I’ve got four days before the service—I need to nail this bastard before then.”

Gary exhaled sharply, rubbing his temples. “You’re one stupid motherfucker. You’re lucky I’m sticking with you.”

I smirked before veering off the path, pushing through the thick forest. Branches clawed at my hoodie, and I grumbled as I swatted them away. Then, I saw it—a mound in the dirt. A cellar. Its doors locked tight.

I stepped forward—then nearly fell.

Gary’s sharp inhale made my blood run cold. “Holy fuck, man. That’s an arm.”

I stumbled back, my foot revealing rotting flesh—gray, decomposed, with bone peeking through. My stomach lurched.

Then, I took in the rest of the scene.

A corpse slumped against a tree, a noose still around its neck, flies swarming. Another body—beheaded, tied to the trunk. Bones, large and small were scattered through the dirt. There were almost as much bone fragments as there were actual rocks.

I swallowed hard, forcing myself to stand. Gary wasn’t having it. He stumbled over to a tree, retching horribly.

Steeling myself, I walked over to the slumped over body, picking up a stick. Using it, I nudged the intact corpse, turning its head. There it was—the Klan sigil, carved deep into decayed skin. I snapped a picture and exhaled shakily.

Then, I turned to the cellar. 

An overwhelming dread settled over me. I couldn’t open those doors. I couldn’t see what was inside. I should just turn around, go home, see my wife and kids.

Gary wiped his mouth, stepping beside me. My hands trembled on the handle, sweat beading down my forehead.

“That’s enough for today,” he murmured. “Another day, Art.”

He was right. I wasn’t ready.

Marking trees with red spray paint, we retraced our path, heading back toward civilization. The lake came into view, familiar and almost comforting. We didn’t speak on the way back.

By the time we reached a small diner, it was 9 p.m. I stared at my untouched omelet, shame coiling in my gut.

Gary sighed. “We did good today. Except for that last part.” He shook his head. “I don’t know what’s in that cellar, but it’s beyond us. Right now, we can go to the police with this… probably.”

I frowned. “What if they’re in on it? Why wouldn’t they be?”

“Shit… true.” He stirred his coffee, deep in thought. “Write about it. Make people aware.”

“Like… a blog?”

He shrugged. “It’s what young people do.”

I hesitated. “Not a bad idea. I can post everything online as a backup… and still talk to the police.”

It wasn’t much, but it was a start.
