My wife, Neha, died three days ago.

It was a car crash. I wasn’t with her when it happened—I was at home, arguing with her over the phone about something stupid. I don’t even remember what now. All I remember is her voice cutting off mid-sentence, replaced by a scream and the sound of metal twisting.

Then—silence.

The police said she died on impact. I identified the body. Closed casket. There was no mistaking it: Neha was gone.

But last night, she called me.

It was 2:13 AM. The ringtone woke me up—her special one, the song she loved from that old Bollywood film. My heart clenched before I even looked at the screen.

**“Neha ❤️”**

I froze.

It had to be a prank. A cruel friend. Some kind of scam.

But my hands moved before my brain could stop them.

“Hello?”

For a few seconds, there was nothing. Then, in a low, broken whisper:

**“I’m cold.”**

I didn’t speak. I couldn’t. My mouth just hung open, dry.

She said it again. Louder this time. Clearer.

**“I’m so cold, Aarav. Why did you leave me?”**

I hung up. Sat there for hours, shaking, staring at the phone.

The call log was real. Duration: 18 seconds.

This morning, I told myself it was grief. A hallucination. Maybe someone had cloned her number, though how or why made no sense.

I even called the number back. It rang once—then nothing. No voicemail. No tone. Just silence.

But tonight, she called again.

Same time. Same ringtone.

This time, I didn’t answer.

She left a voicemail.

Her voice was softer this time. Not like before. There was something wet and dragging in it, like she was speaking through water.

**“Why aren’t you answering, Aarav?”**
**“You promised forever.”**
**“It’s dark here.”**

There was a strange scratching in the background. And something else.

A tapping sound. Like fingernails on wood.

I didn’t sleep.

This evening, I went to her grave.

I don’t know why. Maybe I needed to see it. Prove to myself she was really dead. But when I got there, something was off.

The soil looked… disturbed. Like someone had dug into it recently and tried to cover it back up.

I told myself it was animals.

Then I saw the scratches on the headstone.

Long, deep gouges. Like claw marks.

I came home and turned my phone off.

But it turned itself back on.

2:13 AM. Again.

This time, she sent a photo.

My hands are trembling even now. I can barely type this.

It was a picture of me. Taken from behind. In my living room.

Worse—there was a shape standing just behind me. Barely visible. Almost like a shadow made of smoke, stretched tall and wrong.

And I’m alone. I *was* alone.

The lights in my apartment flickered as I stared at the image. Then my phone vibrated again.

A message.

**“I’m coming home. Don’t lock the door.”**

I ran to the door. Locked every bolt. Every window. Shut the curtains. I don’t know what else to do. I’m writing this here because I think she’s close. I think she’s already inside.

I can hear the tapping.

From the other side of the bedroom door.

No one else would knock like that.

She had this habit, you see—when she’d get home late, she wouldn’t ring the bell. She’d tap. Three times, slow and deliberate.

Like this:

**Tap. Tap. Tap.**

And now I hear it again.

She’s not dead.

Or maybe she is.

But whatever’s on the other side of that door?

It’s wearing my wife’s skin.

And it wants in.
