I'm an 80's kid.

And what I remember most from that decade is Grandma. Scolding me. A lot.

Grandma could really be a pain in the neck.

Usually, it was because I hadn't washed my hands well enough. But it could also be due to the hole in the ozone. As a kid, Grandma and I spent a lot of time together. Both my parents worked, and Grandma and Grandpa had a small business that didn’t have a, "N*o Kids Allowed,"* sign out in front.

I’m pretty far from childhood now and I haven't seen Grandma since those days, well, that is until her wake a couple of weeks ago. But I’m getting ahead of myself.

Yeah, The ‘80s. Grandma. She was like *crazy* obsessed with handwashing.

I tried to make mine spotless, but no dice.

Grandma would always make that face.

That face like someone was force-feeding her a lemon while dragging their fingernails across a chalkboard.

Then Grandma would take me hard by the hand, marching me right back to that turquoise bathroom, with the turquoise sink in that little apartment in Bensonhurst they rented that smelled like mothballs and liver.

God, I came to despise that sink. Especially, the plastic cup that sat in the center of the turquoise toothbrush holder built into the tiled wall. The plastic cup in which sat Grandpa's teeth gooey with Poligrip. I would just stare at the teeth while Grandma reminded me what a bad, bad, bad little hand-washer I was turning out to be.

Then, Grandma would begin scrubbing my hands furiously, scolding me, muttering to the tiled walls about, well, who really knows what?

Then, when I was in the first grade Grandma and Grandpa had some kind of trouble and abruptly closed their jewelry shop in Queens. That was right about the time when my parents started arguing constantly. That was just before Dad moved out to Newark.

After Dad left, Mom blithely told me she was having an affair one night, over TV dinners and bad sitcoms. That was what passed for Family Night with Mom. She said it was with some big-shot judge and we might even be moving to a big, fancy house. She said the judge was hot. I didn’t say anything.

I remember thinking what an absolute pain in the neck my family could be.

I stopped going to Dad's tiny studio apartment after a while, mostly because he just cried nonstop and hysterically about Mom, her affairs and that he had roaches and sleep apnea. When I told Mom that Dad was pretty much coming apart at the seams, she just smirked and said, "I have a right to be happy, too, Elsa! Don't I?" Then she told me to go wash my hands.

I remember thinking if we could just maybe get a golden retriever, like my friend Amy’s parents did when they separated, then maybe Mom might stop being so grouchy all the time. And then, who knows? Amy's parents patched things up. Maybe Dad could even come back, and we could all be a family again. It didn't quite pan out that way though. But that’s what little me thought.

What happened, but a few days later, instead, was Grandpa collapsed during his own anniversary toast. Collapsed face first in his own anniversary cake. Let me tell you, there is nothing quite like witnessing a fatal and massive coronary first-hand in a catering hall with over a hundred guests. Yeah, Grandma loved big parties.

One moment, Grandpa was saying, and I quote, that, “he loved Grandma more than the devil loves buying souls and that no matter what Grandma might have done to her-“ and then, then his toast was cut short by his heart going Hiroshima and, as you now know; his face belly flopping in their anniversary cake.

It wasn't long after that, that Grandma decided she needed to trip around the world. I guess she kept on tripping because we never saw her again. That is until a couple of weeks ago. But that doesn’t count if the estranged party is deceased. However, before Grandma decided to go globe-trotting, she paid little me one final visit.

*Grandma’s Last Goodbye*

"Put down Barbie. Now!" Grandma said.

I put Barbie down and went to go give Grandma a hug. Grandma stopped me. She grabbed me by my shoulders then pushed me hard enough so that I had to take a step back to keep my balance.

"You too nice!" she scolded. "No hugs! We talking now."

"You want to play Barbie with me, Grandma?"

Grandma made with the sour puss. Then she pinched my cheek; hard enough to bring tears.

"No crying! No playing, Barbie now! No hugging, Grandma. Grandma is going away on a trip. Listen. Listen with your ears! Not your mouth! Now, let me tell you something, Elsa."

"Okay," I said.

"Men? No good! Women? No good! People? No good!

You like Grandma. Like your mother. Got it?"

As usual I didn't understand what my grandmother was on about, but I knew better than to interrupt her once she got on her horse.

"You are too young to understand me very well. But you need to work *very* hard at school and be best. Be number one. Number two for toilet!

You be sure to find a rich man. Maybe good if he ugly too. You stop being nice, okay? People, not your friends. Nice girl very bad thing. You be nice if you need but remember, you leave your house, there are ten thousand enemies waiting. You find man, rich, powerful. Then you will see. Then, you will; know.

Got it?"

I nodded at Grandma. I just wanted to play Barbie and have my family back.

"Life choke you. So, you choke it first, okay?"

I just kept nodding. Then there was a pause in the scolding and lecturing.

"Where'd Grandpa go to?" I had remembered shoehorning in.

"Hell," was all Grandma said. And that was the last time I was within speaking distance to Grandma 'till her wake four decades later.

Ironically, after Grandma disappeared into the wind, Mom and Dad did manage to get briefly back together.

I remember those months for being so happy until they weren't.

When my sister, Esther, was born something wasn't right.

Dad finally figured out that Esther wasn't his because of the red hair. There was only one ginger player in the picture and that would be the honorable, Judge \[redaction\] who sported the same shade of Bozo as what turned out to be my half-sister.

Crestfallen and cuckolded yet again, Dad suffered a nervous breakdown and Mom responded by divorcing him stat.

When Dad finally got out of the hospital, he ended up marrying one of the nurses who had cared for him. I never saw Dad again.

By the sixth grade, my mother's relationship with the judge had been discovered by the judge's wife.

After his wife was through threatening to have her husband's title changed for free to The *Dishonorable* Judge \[redacted\], my mother was unceremoniously dropped, and we never did get that big house. And Esther never did get to grow up with a father.

My mother and I really did not get along well after all that drama and still don't. I tried to have some kind of relationship with Esther, but we never really bonded, and I feel like my Mom poisoned her against me.

By eighth grade Mom and I were at each other like two cats. Finally, I just left one day for school and never came back. After some drama things shook out so that I ended up living with my paternal aunt, Vera. Vera was mostly okay but the important part was I didn't really see too much of my mother or sister ever again. But I won't lie. It was hard and lonely.

If it wasn't for meeting Blaine in high school, I don't know what I would have done for human connection. It was almost too good to be true the day he asked if the seat next to me was taken in art class.

Blaine was a kind-hearted, smart and a good athlete. From the day we met he'd do anything in the world for me. And, there was more. Blaine had had the kind of family I always thought was only in movies and on the Hallmark channel and shit. Big and loving and stylish.

They always made me feel like I belonged and when Blaine proposed to me during Thanksgiving weekend during our senior year of college I was over the moon. I looked down at him on bended knee.

"Yes," was my answer. "Of course I'll marry you!"

And, at long last, my life had found it's happy ending.

And now? Two beautiful boys; Daniel and David. A great civil service job with flexible hours. An above ground pool in the low, to medium priced, Nassau County suburbs.

And then Grandma died.

She made it to a hundred on the button right to her death day. Like scolding bookends. What a shock! I had barely thought of my Grandma all these long years later let alone expected her to leave me anything in her will. But the estate lawyer assured me she most certainly did. And it was something I was not even aware had been in my family for generations.

"Of course, she'd leave *you* the jade necklace," my mother remarked icily, yet sourly, at the wake. Sort of like a diabetic lemon Italian ice. My sister said, "Yeah. It figures."

"I'm sorry for your loss," was all I said before taking an empty seat with Blaine and the boys, far away from my mother and sister.

Yeah, it’s weird. I don’t even think much about my family, but that day? That day, when I saw Grandma just lying there all rigid yet full of sour immortality; all these feelings and memories that maybe had been repressed came rushing up to greet me all at once. To be honest; it was more than a little overwhelming to think just what we bury and forget about.

...

*Two Weeks Later*

*...*

I stood before the bedroom mirror. Behind me, Blaine's reflection placed the jade necklace I had been bequeathed gently around my neck.

I felt so much love for him. He was my savior. My prince.

"This is an amazing necklace. Clasp is kind of weird, though. Shit. The stones look like they’re shimmering. I think they’re vibrating," Blaine remarked. "It will look so beautiful on you, baby."

"I love y-," I heard myself begin to say when I felt Blaine finally get the clasp locked.

I felt a shock like someone had stepped on my grave followed by a tinge of vertigo. The room threatened to spin out of control before I heard myself saying, "Get the fuck away from me!"

"What?!" a shocked Blaine responded.

I turned around. There my husband stood before me. He was smiling uncertainly sporting a puzzled look on his face. And so much worry. His eyebrows screamed I care!

Then I shoved him. He staggered back a step to keep his balance. His hip went into the corner of the dresser hard.

“FUCK! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK, ELSA!?!”

Then Blaine released a blood curdling scream.

*“Fucking goddamned motherhumping, Legos! Dannnnyyyy!”*

I might have laughed but it was fast getting tight around my throat. My neck screamed out in pain. I tried to clear my throat. No dice.

I felt the necklace constricting. And then?

Shit. Just. Got. UNREAL.

A voice in my head said, what sounded to the inside of my head to be, ***"constrictionnnnn and frictionnnn. separationnnn and contradiction….. damnation to all mennnn…"***

And for a lonely second the necklace loosened its grip. I coughed and sputtered.

"Blaine. Run!" I heard my throat croak with extreme effort. "Just. Run!"

"What?" he asked staring blankly running nowhere perfectly.

And then I closed my eyes. I saw something that made me nauseous.

It was my next husband. He was a senator maybe. There was a flag on the walnut wood paneled walls of his office and the lapel of his fancy, tailored suit. He had silver sideburns just the right length for TV. He was clearly someone with money. Clearly someone with power. He clearly was old too, maybe late 70s, early 80s. And then I saw it. What looked like a mushroom cloud behind him.

"Elsa! You don't look so-" Blaine pleaded, snapping me back to reality.

Again, the air grew scarce. The necklace constricted. I reached behind me on the bureau. A letter opener somehow found its way into my hand. My fingers clutched it. If I could use it to get this thing off my neck.

Then Blaine put his arms around me and embraced me.

“Easy baby. It’s gonna be okay.”

I felt my arm slowly raise itself, the letter opener firmly grasped by my dominant hand.

In the mirror, I saw Blaine's back. And my hand holding the letter opener. It went up a little higher, catching the light from the ceiling fan.

"Baby! What is it?" Blaine asked. "You're white as a sheet. You’re scaring me."

Without warning, the necklace relaxed its grip again. As if echoing the sentiment my hand relaxed around the letter opener and I let it fall to the rug soundlessly.

And then, then in my mind, I saw myself downstairs in the kitchen, bathed in the morning sunshine. At first, I thought I was brewing coffee. But, upon closer inspection of hallucination theater’s marquee, it seemed I was deeply engrossed in brewing up a batch of Marlboro cigarettes into some sticky gunky brew I then poured carefully through a funnel into a thermos that said, “World’s Best Husband!”

I watched myself violently shaking my head. Then the me brewing Marlboro mud, hastily the gunk in the sink and down the disposal. I saw my head shake like a gnat landed in my ear. I watched myself break down into tears and fall to my knees. Whose thoughts were these trespassing upon my headspace?

Oh, I know! Maybe, it was the last few late-night mint-chip ice cream and *Snapped* bingeathons I kept succumbing to.

Yeah, I think it's called waking dreams or lucid dreaming or some shit. Yeah, combined with the stress of remembering my fucked-up childhood it's no wonder I'm daydreaming. No, Blaine and my boys are my safe, happy place now. Everything is fine and it's gonna stay like that forever.

All that stupid stuff Grandma was talking about? That's all behind me now. And Blaine's all the man I'll ever need. I don’t care if we aren't rich or anything. I like clipping coupons and bargain hunting.

I began to hug Blaine back and then I felt *it* again. Only more intensely. More insistent. Like icy fingers, spastic with frostbite, digging into my neck, forcing goose bump flesh into a what might prove to be a fatal short-squeeze.

Blaine said, "Heyyy. Heyyyy. Shhhhh. It's gonna be okay. But look, I promised Karen I would cover her shift tonight. You gonna be okay alone, babe?"

"Sure," I said, feeling the jade loosen its grip. "But," I heard myself begin, in a voice that sounded nothing like mine, yet, *eerily* familiar.

"Working too hard can give you a heart attack. You ought to know by now."

Now, I recognized the voice! It was Grandma. And it wasn't a very nice voice. It whispered passive-agressively in my ear: *You can take the necklace off Grandma, but you can't take Grandma off the necklace...*
